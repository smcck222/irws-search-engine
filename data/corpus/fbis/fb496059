  [Text] The first round of the inter-Tajik talks on national 
reconciliation that were held under the aegis of the United 
Nations Organization has completed its work in the city of 
Moscow of the Russian Federation. 
  The participants in the talks signed a protocol on setting 
up 
a joint commission on the problems of Tajikistan refugees. The 
protocol says that the participants of the inter-Tajik talks on 
national reconciliation under the aegis of the United Nations 
Organization arrived at the following agreement: 
  To set up a joint commission on the problems of the Tajik 
refugees on an equal basis between of representatives of the 
Government of the Republic of Tajikistan and the opposition, in 
particular, the Umed Foundation [Tajik opposition fund to render 
assistance to compatriots abroad] from 19 April 1994. The joint 
commission will work within the framework of the course of talks 
and coordinate its activity with the United Nations High 
Commission for Refugees in those countries the Tajik refugees 
are. The joint commission could set up working groups and bring 
in experts when it is necessary. The participants of the 
inter-Tajik talks on national reconciliation asked the United 
Nations to render financial assistance to the joint commission. 
  A joint communique was adopted on the results of the first 
round of the inter-Tajik talks. The joint communique says that 
the first round of the inter-Tajik talks on national 
reconciliation took place in the city of Moscow under the aegis 
of the United Nations, with participation of observers from 
Afghanistan, Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Iran, Pakistan, Russia, and 
Uzbekistan from 5-19 April of the current year. 
  The Tajikistan Government delegation was led by Shukurjon 
Zuhurov, the minister of labor and employment. The opposition 
delegation was led by Otakhon Latifi, the chairman of the 
Coordinating Council of the Democratic Forces of Tajikistan in 
the Commonwealth of Independent States. Ambassador Ramiro 
Piriz-Ballon, the United Nations secretary general's special 
envoy was a mediator in the course of talks. The talks were 
held in a working, open, and mutual understanding atmosphere. 
Both sides (?showed themselves really in favor of) a solution 
to the package of difficult political, military, humanitarian, 
social, and economic issues that appeared as a result of 
political conflict and fratricidal war in the Republic of 
Tajikistan. The talks participants have approved and adopted 
the agenda of talks during all rounds that are as follows: 
  1. Measures on the political settlement of the situation 
in Tajikistan. 
  2. Solution to the problems of refugees. 
  3. Issues relating to the construction of constitutional 
structures and strengthening of the state structure of the 
Republic of Tajikistan. 
  The sides decided to discuss all three groups of issues as a 
whole and to express their opinion on all the issues, in 
particular the agenda of talks in the working documents. The 
sides and the United Nations secretary general's special envoy 
approved the joint communique of the inter-Tajik talks and 
adopted a decision to urge the Tajikistan Government and the 
Tajik opposition forces not to jeopardize the talks. The sides 
have signed a protocol on setting up a joint commission on 
resolving the problems of Tajik refugees. 
  The sides have expressed gratitude to all the states that 
rendered assistance to the Tajik refugees, as well as to the 
United Nations High Commission for Refugees and other 
international organizations. The sides expressed their 
readiness to achieve national reconciliation only through 
political dialogue. With this purpose, on the basis of the 
previous agreement on changing the venue of talks, the sides 
decided to ask the United Nations secretary general's special 
envoy to hold meetings on the venue and date for the second and 
third rounds of the inter-Tajik talk. 
  The sides have expressed gratitude to the Russian Federation 
Government for the hospitality, assistance, and cooperation in 
organizing and holding the first round of talks in Moscow. 
  Similarly, the sides have expressed gratitude to the United 
Nations secretary general and Ramiro Piriz-Ballon, his special 
envoy, as well as to the representatives of those states who 
acted as observers at the talks for their assistance and 
cooperation in organizing and holding the inter-Tajik talks on 
national reconciliation.

  [Text] Ashkhabad [Ashgabat], 20 Apr -- Li Peng, chairman of 
the Chinese State Council, arrived in Ashkhabad this afternoon. 
He was met at the airport by Turkmen President Saparmurad 
Niyazov. 
  A written statement by Li Peng was issued in the Turkmen 
capital. It says: "China and Turkmenistan are friendly 
neighboring countries. Links between our peoples are rooted 
deeply in time. The Great Silk Road united the peoples of our 
countries more than 2,000 years ago. Once diplomatic relations 
were established between China and Turkmenistan, the traditional 
friendly relations were developed anew." 
  The statement stresses that "China attaches great 
significance to the development of relations with Turkmenistan 
and that there are broad prospects for their manifold 
development." 
  Li Peng and Niyazov left the airport for the residence 
allocated to the guest where they had a brief conversation.

<F P=106> [Vasiliy Kononenko report: "Russian Security Council Has </F>
Examined Situation in Hotspots"] 
  [Text] Russian policy toward the conflict situations in 
nearby and more distant countries -- that was the main theme of 
the Russian Federation Security Council session chaired by B. 
Yeltsin in the Kremlin 20 April. 
  The session examined two main questions: on Russia's policy 
in the Caucasus region and on the fulfillment of decisions on 
state support for the Cossacks. However, as Security Council 
Secretary O. Lobov said in conversation with your IZVESTIYA 
correspondent, Foreign Minister A. Kozyrev also briefed the 
Council on the situation in Bosnia. In view of the fact that B. 
Yeltsin's initiative to hold a summit meeting of leaders of the 
interested states on the Bosnian problem is meeting with growing 
support, it was decided to speed up its preparation. Working 
contacts have already begun in this regard. 
  A. Kozyrev gave the Security Council members a detailed 
report on the military-political situation in the region of the 
conflict between Azerbaijan and Nagorno-Karabakh and also in 
connection with the Georgian-Abkhaz conflict. The general 
opinion, O. Lobov said, is this: Russia's interests in this 
region -- first and foremost the existence of a considerable 
Russian diaspora there and the presence of a large military 
contingent -- dictate the necessity of strengthening its 
peacemaking role in those conflicts. Since organizations like 
the United Nations and the CSCE cannot send their forces there, 
Russia advocates the presence of Defense Ministry disengagement 
forces in the conflict zones, as well as the presence of 
observers from international organizations. 
  As for the problem of the Cossacks, the Security Council 
session took note of the slow solution of the questions of 
ensuring self-government in the Cossack communities and granting 
them land. In some regions there have been confrontations 
between local administrations and Cossack elected organs. On 
the other hand, the government and the president's structures 
have a common position regarding the rehabilitation of the 
Cossacks as a community [sosloviye]. A general federal program 
will be drafted in that regard. The president is going to send 
the State Duma a draft law on the return of land to Cossack 
settlements. This process will have different features in 
different regions, of course. As for the performance of 
military service by Cossacks, the Cossack formations will be 
introduced into the structures of the Defense Ministry and the 
border troops.

  [Text] Moscow, 20 Apr -- "A balance between the executive 
and representative powers is taking shape." This was stated by 
Russian Federation President Boris Yeltsin at a meeting with the 
heads of administrations of Russian krays and oblasts, when he 
was summing up the results of elections to local bodies of power 
that had been held in a number of regions. 
  According to Boris Yeltsin, "the elections were normal, 
though not everywhere was their quality good." In June there 
will be elections in the rest of the regions. "We must continue 
work to truly provide a real division of power," stressed Boris 
Yeltsin.

  [Text] Moscow April 20 TASS -- The current rate of 
inflation in Russia at about 8-10 per cent a month opens up 
prospects for credits from the International Monetary Fund, 
Russian President Boris Yeltsin said. Speaking at a meeting with 
the heads of regional administrations in Moscow on Wednesday, 
Yeltsin said that "in April the IMF will allocate Russia 1.5 
billion dollars" if the current level of inflation is 
maintained. If the economic situation improves, Russia may 
count on another 5-7 billion U.S. dollars in the future, he 
added. 
  The president stressed that "the current level of inflation 
in Russia is the lowest in the CIS." It almost meets the target 
figures, although May and June will be difficult, he said. 
Yeltsin stressed that the government is now working on a draft 
budget for 1995 and will submit it to the State Duma, the lower 
house of the Russian Parliament, in September 1994.

  [Text] Kiev -- Leaders of Ukraine's Communist Party (KPU) 
held a news conference on 19 April at which Petro Symonenko, KPU 
central committee first secretary, said the party's minimum task 
had almost been achieved. The communists won 86 seats, while 
the left bloc as a whole had more than one third of the votes in 
the parliament. In the words of Petro Symonenko, the KPU 
revealed itself as a significant political force. The communist 
faction is counting on fruitful cooperation with other factions 
and with nonaffiliated deputies. Petro Symonenko said: "We are 
entering parliament as a constructive force. We have a 
constructive platform that is aimed at creating conditions for a 
normal life for the people of Ukraine." 
  It was reported at the news conference that more than 10 
million citizens of Ukraine had voted for the communists during 
the elections to the Supreme Council, which in the party 
leadership's opinion, is proof of the adherence by a significant 
part of Ukraine's population to the ideas of socialist justice, 
internationalism, and an equal union of independent states. 
  Regarding activity in parliament, Petro Symonenko noted that 
the communists would not give in to provocations by nationalists 
who "continue to frighten the people with supposedly the 
communists will paralyze parliament's work by submitting for 
discussion the issue on state symbols." In the words of the KPU 
leader, for the communists, the Supreme Council's first steps 
will be the formation of parliamentary and government 
structures, as well as the implementation of an economic program 
that envisages the introduction of state regulation in the basic 
sectors of industry and agriculture, introduces changes to the 
taxation system that, in the communists' opinion, is directed 
against workers and changes to the financial and credit systems 
etc. After this, the communists intend to submit for the 
parliament's consideration the issue of repealing the ban on the 
KPU and on returning assets that for the most part have become 
the property of commercial structures. 
  Petro Symonenko informed journalists that in the near 
future, 
a meeting is expected to be held with Leonid Kravchuk, president 
of Ukraine, at the latter's instigation. The KPU also proposed 
that Ivan Plyushch form a working group to prepare the work of 
the new Supreme Council. This was agreed. It was stressed that 
the communists are taking part in the presidential campaign only 
for the sake of publicizing communist ideas among Ukraine's 
population. In the event of a communist contender being elected 
(Petro Symonenko's candidacy has been approved), he would do 
everything to ensure that power in Ukraine belonged exclusively 
to the councils. 
  Replying to questions from journalists regarding the 
division 
of the Black Sea Fleet, Petro Symonenko said that in order to 
resolve this problem it would be necessary to return to a 
defense union with Russia, within which the problem would be 
resolved peacefully. Replying to a question about Ukraine's 
place in the world, Borys Oliynyk, KPU central committee member, 
said relations with other states should be built on the basis of 
equality.

<F P=106> ["Text" of speech by President Geydar Aliyev at the enlarged </F>
meeting of the heads of rayon executive authorities and leading 
ministry and law enforcement officials in the presidential 
offices on 17 April--recorded] 
  [Text] Esteemed participants of this convocation; this 
meeting is of an extraordinary nature. It is related to the 
fighting in the front-line areas and the measures that are 
required in that regard. It is common knowledge that the 
Armenian military forces moved on 9 and 10 April to intensify 
their aggression and attacks on Azerbaijan's territory and our 
positions on the front lines. They have maintained their 
attacks until now. 
  We asked that talks be held to end the attacks. It is common 
knowledge that I appealed to Azerbaijan's people through the 
radio and television network on 12 April. Furthermore, I 
appealed to the Armenian leaders, the Armenian people, the 
Armenian and Azerbaijani citizens in Daghlyk [Nagorno] Karabakh, 
the international community, the CIS leaders, and international 
organizations to inform them about the situation. I stressed 
that Azerbaijan demands that the attacks be halted, peace talks 
be held, and the necessary agreement be reached. 
  The international community and foreign countries reacted 
favorably to my appeal. Regrettably, the Armenian side and the 
Armenian military forces have maintained their claims and tried 
to distort the situation. They have been trying to blame 
Azerbaijan for the attacks. 
  It is common knowledge that the CIS heads of state held a 
summit in Moscow on 14 and 15 April. I held talks with 
President Boris Yeltsin during the summit. I also held talks 
with Prime Minister Viktor Chernomyrdin; Foreign Minister Andrey 
Kozyrev; several CIS heads of state; and President Levon-Ter 
Petrosyan. I made an official speech on 15 April. That speech 
has been broadcast by the television networks and published in 
the press. You are already aware of it. I stressed that the 
CIS cannot remain indifferent toward the fighting between 
Azerbaijan and Armenia. In particular, it must take concrete 
measures to obstruct the Armenian military forces' latest 
attacks. A debate was held on my proposals. Later, a joint 
communique by the CIS heads of state was approved. That, too, 
has been published in the newspapers. It said that the CIS 
heads of state have considered the fact that the leaders of 
Azerbaijan and Armenia have expressed support for a cease-fire 
agreement. Yes, I expressed support for a cease-fire agreement. 
  Other views also were expressed. You are already aware of 
them. However, regardless of the joint communique by the CIS 
heads of state, the Armenian military sub-units fired on 
Azerbaijan's positions and attacked them from various directions 
on 15 and 16 April. Serious and bloody fighting took place 
yesterday, last night, and today. All that has shown that the 
Armenian leaders have rejected our peace initiatives. Although 
they purport to agree, they continue to maintain their approach, 
which is aimed at forcing Azerbaijan to accept an agreement 
which will be in their favor. 
  You have been informed through the television reports that I 
expressed my views on the very recent Armenian attacks during 
the closed session of the CIS heads of state. A debate was held 
on the matter. Journalists asked me and President Ter-Petrosyan 
to comment on the matter during the press conference that was 
held after the summit. I briefly explained the situation. 
However, President Ter- Petrosyan said that Armenia is not 
involved in the war and that the fighting is between Azerbaijan 
and Daghlyk Karabakh. Furthermore, he stressed that Armenia is 
prepared to sign Russia's [peace] plan together with all the 
participants of the CIS summit. However, the question is as 
follows: What right does Armenia have to sign that plan if it 
is not a party in the war? Obviously, the Armenian officials 
have exposed their approach. 
  All that may be regarded as an interesting development. 
However, not for us. What is important for us is the 
maintenance of our present positions and the defense of our 
republic's territory. Regrettably, I wish to reiterate that we 
have suffered severely from the unending Armenian attacks. We 
have lost many people. Bloody clashes took place in several 
residential areas yesterday. Some of them were lost and then 
taken back. The situation changes every day. Therefore, 
establishing what goes on is impossible. However, it is common 
knowledge that the Armenian military forces have launched very 
strong attacks. That is a fact. We must also admit that their 
attacks have been at a very professional level. 
  Meanwhile, we have been informed from the front-line areas 
that those attacks have not been organized only by the Armenian 
military forces. Observations indicate that foreign forces have 
been involved in the organization and launching of those 
attacks. That state of affairs has greatly exacerbated the 
situation in the front-line areas. 
  I must also stress on the basis of the information I have 
received that the Azerbaijan military sub-units have retaliated 
against the serious and devastating attacks appropriately. They 
are bleeding and dying to become martyrs in the effort to defend 
the homeland. Of course, they have been confronted with 
difficulties. They have been forced to withdraw in various 
places. Nevertheless, they have continued to defend our 
territory. 
  I was informed this morning that Ferhat Askerov, who was 
named a national hero in view of his services during the 
fighting in Shusha in 1992, was martyred while heroically 
fighting to defend Sumu in Agdamskiy Rayon last night. But, 
there are others as well. I have mentioned his name because he 
was a renowned national hero. Many of our people have been 
martyred while fighting to defend our homeland's territory. 
That is very natural. That state of affairs is an indication 
of our people's and Army's heroic nature and courage. It is 
also an indication of the fact that our people can block the 
Armenian attacks more effectively and skillfully in the future. 
  I urge you to observe a moment of silence to commemorate the 
memory of the sons and citizens of Azerbaijan who have been 
martyred in the latest fighting. [silence observed to 
commemorate martyrs; Aliyev continues] 
  God bless their souls. I convey my condolences to the 
families of all our martyrs. I wish to assure them on behalf of 
Azerbaijan's people that they will never be forgotten. They 
will always be remembered by Azerbaijan's people as heroes. 
Their heroic services will strengthen and elevate Azerbaijan's 
people and create the basis for the safeguarding of Azerbaijan's 
territorial integrity. 
  Regrettably, I also wish to stress that some of our citizens 
have acted in a cowardly way and deserted from the front lines. 
Some of them fled to save their lives. Regrettably, that state 
of affairs is still continuing. That is a situation that 
weakens our defenses and keeps us from retaliating against the 
Armenian attacks in an appropriate way. Undoubtedly, no one 
will treat the cowards and deserters respectfully. Furthermore, 
no one will treat their families and relatives respectfully. 
They will always be hated by the community. I am convinced 
that they will be brought to account in accordance with our laws. 
  I feel the need to reiterate a point that I stressed in my 
radio and television speech on 12 April. We have serious 
problems in the effort we are making to organize our army and 
find the necessary officers and men for the military units. 
That is due to the inefficient maintenance of the state of 
mobilization and to the cases of desertions from the military 
units, that is, in addition to desertions from the front lines. 
  The matter was seriously discussed during the meetings that 
were held by the leaders of the rayon executive authorities and 
military commissars in Beylagan and Barda on 11 and 12 April. 
We gave serious instructions to the leaders of the rayon 
executive authorities and administrative organs to strengthen 
their struggle against such cases. The main task of each and 
every individual and the officials in particular is to 
contribute toward the effort made to provide men and officers 
for the military units, establish discipline, and obstruct 
desertions. Another more serious task does not exist. Nothing 
can be done in connection with the pending economic and 
political measures and nothing can be done to meet the wishes of 
the people because we shall be defeated if we fail to defend our 
territory. The enemy forces will advance to occupy the 
remaining part of our territory. Who will survive after that is 
unknown. 
  In view of that, I am obliged to reiterate that what I have 
mentioned is our main task and problem. The developments that 
took place in the front-line areas on 15, 16, and 17 April 
indicate that we have failed to change that state of affairs. 
We face a serious situation at the present time. We have made 
several peace initiatives. We have had recourse to the CIS. 
The CIS issued an important statement on 15 April that noted 
that the leaders of Armenia and Azerbaijan have agreed to 
immediately implement a cease-fire agreement. However, the 
Armenian military forces launched strong attacks against 
Azerbaijan's positions on the same day. Apparently, the peace 
initiatives have failed to yield results. 
  President Boris Yeltsin emphatically agreed in our private 
talks and in the general convocations we had later that a 
cease-fire agreement has to be imposed. He emphatically asked 
me and President Levon Ter-Petrosyan to move to end the 
shooting. President Yeltsin also said that he would even visit 
Azerbaijan and Armenia to help us resolve the matter if we do 
not object. However, the strong attacks by the Armenian 
military forces on 15, 16, and 17 April, that is, shortly after 
the talks we had with President Yeltsin, showed that the 
Armenians do not attach importance to talks and statements. They 
only wish to pursue their aggressive intentions and maintain 
their aggressive policies. 
  We have appealed to the international organizations. My 
appeal was conveyed to them through our channels on 12 April. 
It was conveyed to the UN organization, the UN Security 
Council, the CSCE, and all the heads of state. However, the 
Armenian aggressors have not drawn any conclusion from the 
developments. They have maintained their aggressive and 
occupationist policies and their activities within the framework 
of those policies. 
  Considering that state of affairs, our most important and 
urgent task is to establish our Army, provide the necessary 
manpower for our military units, help the Army, and stop 
desertions. How many of you are here in this meeting hall? How 
many of you can sincerely say that you have effectively 
fulfilled that task? I have not been able to see anyone who has 
done that in this meeting hall. 
  Everyone believes that others must fulfill that task but 
whether he himself does so does not matter. Therefore, I wish 
to ask: Why are we trying to defend our homeland? Why should 
Azerbaijan continue to exist? When are we going to rid 
ourselves of Armenia's aggression? When are we going to 
guarantee the defense of our people? 
  We have discussed all those matters. However, considering 
the fact that the necessary result has not been achieved, I have 
decided to invite you to attend this extraordinary meeting. We 
do not need a lot of time. I do not know how things are for 
others, but each and every moment is very important for us. So, 
we must hold substantial talks in this meeting hall. We must do 
everything we can today, tomorrow, and in the next few days to 
see to it that the requirements of the state of mobilization in 
the Republic are quickly fulfilled. We must establish new 
military units from our reserves. We must also help the Army in 
other respects. We must take the necessary measures in the 
front-line areas. 
  I was informed from the front lines last night that the 
Barda 
Battalion's troops fled in the vicinity of Terter. I was forced 
to call the executive authority in Barda to ask why the men from 
that rayon fled. Barda and Terter are so close to each other 
that there is nowhere to go. I was informed by the head of the 
executive authority a few hours later that he went to the area 
and instructed his men to return to their posts. Why has that 
situation come to pass? Why should the head of an executive 
authority run here and there to collect his men from this or 
that town in the night? However, that is not the only case. 
  I have conveyed my views to you on our heroic fighters and 
martyrs, particularly on Ferhat Askerov, who became a national 
hero in Shusha. The deserters have defamed and dishonored 
Azerbaijan's people and worsened our present situation. In view 
of that, I believe that we must discuss the concrete measures we 
need at the present time. 
  The matters that should be discussed are crystal clear. 
However, I wish to outline the tasks to be fulfilled: 
  First, I wish to stress that the quarterly task related to 
the military call-up must be fulfilled. That task requires that 
the head of the executive authority, military commissar, chief 
of police, procurator, and head of the state security 
administration in each and every rayon, city, and locality 
personally control every issue, including the fulfillment of the 
quarterly task of the military call-up. Fulfilling that task 
does not mean that you will go and transfer the matter in 
question to the military commissar's office and then come back 
to report that you have fulfilled your task. No, that is not 
the way to fulfill your duties. You are responsible. You will 
see to it that recruits apply to the assembly points. You will 
follow the way they are drafted in the assembly points. 
Furthermore, you will control how they fulfill their military 
obligations in the military ranks for some time. I do not wish 
to make calls in the future to say that the Barda Battalion, 
Koykey Battalion, Mingechaur Battalion, and this or that 
battalion have abandoned their positions. I do not want any 
official to inform me two or three days later that he has done 
what was necessary. That is your obligation. You must always 
keep your duties in mind. You must follow the men from your 
rayons to establish the way they serve in the military forces. 
  I received a call before I left for Moscow. It informed me 
that the Khachmas Battalion in Agdamskiy Rayon dispersed and 
fled. I called the head of the Khachmas Executive Authority at 
0100 in the morning. I forced him to go to Agdamskiy Rayon to 
reorganize his men. Is that my job? Should I be doing that? 
Why do we have officials serving as heads of executive 
authorities if I have to instruct or force them to fulfill their 
duties? Therefore, you are responsible not only to fulfill the 
procedures required for the conscription of recruits but also to 
see to it that the conscripted recruits report to serve in the 
military units they are assigned to. You must follow the way 
they serve. That is your task until this state of affairs ends. 
Undoubtedly, each and every rayon will be instructed in that 
regard. 
  However, I wish to appeal to the executive authorities, 
leading officials, and the esteemed people of the occupied 
rayons as follows: The people of your rayons have become 
refugees. They are living in various areas. Many of them are 
unemployed. Instructions must be given to those rayons because 
they had many young men. They must join the military units and 
make an effort to liberate their occupied lands. I do not agree 
with the view that they will have to fight to liberate other 
rayons. All the Republic's citizens are equally responsible for 
the defense of Azerbaijan's territory, regardless of the city or 
rayon they come from. All the citizens are expected to fulfill 
their patriotic duty in the same way. Regarding the occupied 
rayons, I wish to say that the young men from them who are 
unemployed must join the military ranks to defend Azerbaijan's 
territory. I believe that that will be an honorable duty for 
them. 
  That is the second issue. Let me reiterate that you are 
responsible for the work in the call-up of recruits and matters 
related to the mobilization. In fact, all the rayon and city 
organizations are responsible together with you. That task has 
to be fulfilled. 
  Meanwhile, the law enforcement organs must seriously work to 
establish those who avoid the mobilization and the call-up for 
conscription. The military commissar's office has proposed that 
individual centers be established to carry out the work. That 
system was applied in the past. However, it was not successful. 
In fact, it led to negative developments from time to time. 
Therefore, I believe that that is not an appropriate system. 
Let me stress that the district police inspectors are well 
aware of the people in the areas they serve. They are well 
aware who does what, who is employed or unemployed, and who 
avoids conscription. They are well aware of all that. 
Therefore, our police organs in particular must concern 
themselves with the work to be carried out. That also applies 
to the procuracy organs. Serious and urgent measures must be 
taken against those who avoid the requirements of the 
mobilization regime and the call-up for conscription. The 
people must be urgently informed about the measures. 
  The number of deserters has increased. We have discussed 
that many times. The duty of the rayon and city executive 
authorities and their leading officials must be to establish the 
deserters in each and every rayon, district, and city and return 
them to the military forces. Serious work must be carried out 
in that regard. I have established a deadline for the 
mobilization and call-up procedures. The requirements of the 
call-up for conscription must be fulfilled in three days and 
those of the mobilization in five days. We have allowed 10 days 
for the return of the deserters to their units. All the 
deserters must be forced to return to their units in 10 days. I 
wish to reiterate that charges will not be brought against the 
deserters who return to their posts. Very serious measures must 
be taken against those who fail to do so in 10 days. 
  The number of positive cases in that regard are not few. For 
example, I can recall the meeting I had with Colonel Elburus 
Orudzh oglu on 13 April, that is, after my appeal to the people 
through radio and television on 12 April. He informed me that 
100 deserters returned to their units to serve and fight after 
my appeal. What I mean is that our life is not full of only 
negative developments. We also have many positive developments. 
However, we do not mention them often much because our general 
situation is unfavorable. I was very happy to be informed of 
the situation by Colonel Elburus Orudzh oglu 24 hours after my 
appeal. I agree that 100 men is not a large force. However, 
they wished to correct the mistake they made. They rushed to 
rejoin their military units on the front lines. They joined the 
fighting. That was a move worthy of respect and attention. 
That was not the only case. There were many more. 
  Therefore, serious work has to be carried out in 10 days. 
The deserters must be returned to their units. The matter 
requires serious attention. The procuracy and other 
investigation organs must take serious measures to bring the 
deserters who fail to return in 10 days to account. I am 
convinced that our procuracy and judicial organs will 
effectively and accurately apply the laws and the provisions of 
the Republic's criminal code. I am also convinced that the work 
they carry out will create the conditions we need to change our 
general situation. 
  I wish to particularly outline the work to be carried out by 
the military commissars. You have observed that I have assigned 
all these tasks to the leaders of the executive authorities, the 
police, procuracy, and security organs, and the military 
commanders. Actually, the matter mainly concerns the military 
commissars. They must concern themselves with that work. 
However, we have said several times that the military 
commissars have not been able to successfully fulfill their 
duties. In fact, they do not wish to do so because of certain 
reasons. In view of that, I wish to stress that I am not 
satisfied with the work of the military commissars. The 
Republic's military commissar has disclosed in this meeting hall 
that a criminal investigation has been initiated against several 
military commissars. I wish to urge that the work in that 
regard be quickly carried out and the people be informed of 
their mistakes. 
  Considering the need to establish discipline and law and 
order in that field, I have decided to take action as of today. 
That is as follows: The appointment and discharge of the 
military commissars must be subject to the approval of the 
presidential apparatus. 
  The matter was transferred to the Defense Ministry. 
Regrettably, serious shortcomings have been allowed by the 
Defense Ministry on that matter until now. Therefore, I will 
instruct the presidential apparatus to study the situation of 
all the military commissars and advise me as to which military 
commissar can or cannot work in the future. That information 
must be conveyed to me in 10 days. I will decide on the matter. 
Undoubtedly, I will do so on the basis of your detailed 
reports. You will establish who can or cannot work in 10 days. 
I will instruct the defense minister today to comply with that 
rule. I will instruct that military commissars be neither 
appointed nor discharged without the consent of the presidential 
apparatus and that the research be carried out in 10 days. 
Undoubtedly, the research must be carried out in cooperation 
with the Defense Ministry. However, I wish to recommend that 
the president's adviser also participate in that process. 
  Speaking in this meeting hall, the Republic's military 
commissar has expressed his opinion on the work of several 
military commissars. I have received information that the work 
of Lieutenant Colonel Amirov Gusayn Miral oglu, military 
commissar of Dzhelalabadskiy Rayon; Major Rakhimov Vadim Ferman 
oglu, military commissar of Kuba Rayon; and Lieutenant Colonel 
[first name indistinct] Orudzh Ferhad oglu, military commissar 
of Masally Rayon, has been very unsatisfactory. As such, they 
have been unable to fulfill their duties. I am removing them 
from their posts as of this moment. Furthermore, I am 
instructing Minister of Defense Mamedov to issue orders for 
their removal from their posts in accordance with my 
instructions in two hours. Send them to the front-line areas. 
  Complaints have been made against the work of the police 
organs. We have received information from several rayons from 
time to time that the police organs disobey the executive 
authority and that the head of the executive authority is unable 
to control them. We have also received information that 
arguments take place between the procuracy and that the police 
organs and the head of the executive authority are unable to 
resolve this or that problem. All that undermines discipline 
and law and order and worsens the situation. We cannot accept 
such a state of affairs. Therefore, I wish to underline the 
following: The head of the rayon executive authorities are the 
representatives of the president. They are accountable to the 
president on every development in the rayons. Therefore, all the 
rayon organs are subordinate to the heads of the rayon executive 
authorities and they must work together. However, that does not 
mean that the heads of the rayon executive authorities can do 
anything they like. No, that is not so. I am asking for 
businesslike relations between the heads of the executive 
authorities and the rayon organs. Under the existing grave 
conditions, I want everyone to help each other. I want the 
clashes and arguments between them from time to time to be put 
aside. 
  The heads of the executive authorities are competent 
officials. They must use their authority. However, the 
authority that has been transferred to them has placed 
significant responsibility on their shoulders. That 
responsibility requires them to set an example for all the other 
organs in every domain, including work, morale, and loyalty to 
obligations. If they fail, then they cannot fulfill their 
obligations. 
  The arguments among the administrative organs in the rayons 
must be removed. I do not wish to go into detail on that 
matter. The administrative organs must work together. They 
must cooperate to fulfill the main tasks. I expect the heads of 
the executive authorities to see to that matter. 
  Suggestions have been made to the effect that we have to 
take 
additional measures because of the serious situation in the 
Republic. Yes, similar suggestions were also made in the past. 
The Republic is in a state of war. Our life and activities 
must be reorganized in accordance with the demands of the 
military situation. The people must realize until that is done 
that everyone can be called to defend the homeland. The 
situation at the present time is that a part of the community is 
in the front line areas. They are fighting. Our officers and 
men in the military forces are fighting. They are being killed 
every day. Many of the refugees are in a very miserable 
condition. However, a certain group of people have a 
comfortable life, particularly in Baku. They are not concerned 
with the war. Nor are they concerned with the situation of the 
people who live under grave conditions. They have plenty to eat 
and drink. However, they must not display it. Entertaining in 
restaurants and other places will not help our situation at the 
present time. 
  I have stressed several times that nothing can be more 
effective than the experience we have gained in the past. The 
people lived in the same way during World War II. Consumption 
of bread was 400 or 500 grams per person. That applied to 
everyone. No one tried to get double that amount. Naturally, 
there were exceptions. However, they were very few. 
Unfortunately, certain people eat, drink, and entertain in the 
restaurants at the present time. They do not think about the 
continuing bloodshed. They do not think about the people who 
are dying of hunger. Furthermore, they make suggestions on how 
this or that should be done. 
  In view of that, I believe that the demand for the 
declaration of a state of war for the strengthening of 
discipline is justified. We must consider that state of affairs 
and take the necessary measures. Meanwhile, I wish to appeal to 
our people to conscientiously consider the way we live at the 
present time. Everyone must live in accordance with the 
conditions of war and defend our territory. Any other 
alternative does not exist. 
  The Republic's military commissar has said that several 
decrees are inappropriate. That viewpoint was also expressed 
earlier. I do not know why changes have not been made. Who is 
responsible for making proposals to have the decrees changed? 
Is it the military or the legal advisers? They should have 
done so. If the matter concerns the presidential decrees, then 
proposals should be made to the presidential apparatus. If laws 
have to be changed, then the National Assembly should take 
action to resolve the matter in three or four days. I wish to 
instruct the presidential adviser on military affairs and the 
legal department of the presidential apparatus to draw up their 
proposals in three days. 
  I wish to assure you that the serious talks we had in this 
meeting will yield results. We shall make changes in various 
fields in the near future. I wish to stress that I am convinced 
that Azerbaijan's people and the officials they have trusted and 
placed in high-level positions are aware of how grave the 
present situation is for our republic. They will draw the 
necessary conclusions and take the necessary measures. 
  Thank you. I wish you success in the effort you will make to 
fulfill your tasks.

  [Text] [Announcer] The "Alioni" program welcomes you, 
Batono Jaba [Ioseliani, chairman of the Georgian State Emergency 
Committee]. Together with television viewers we are expecting 
your report on the Georgian-Abkhaz talks in Geneva. 
  [Ioseliani] Good morning. What are you interested in? 
  [Announcer] What happened yesterday at the meeting between 
the Georgian and Abkhaz delegations? Some documents were to be 
discussed yesterday, I mean the documents worked out by UN and 
Russian diplomats. 
  [Ioseliani] This document could have been used as the basis 
but it was impossible to accept it in its present form. The 
Abkhaz side yesterday suggested a completely unacceptable plan 
-- as could have been expected -- to legalize what they gained 
after the war. They are trying to breach Georgia's territorial 
integrity and create a union of the two states, create a 
confederation which will mean that there will be Georgia and 
Abkhazia. They [Georgia and Abkhazia] would conclude an 
alliance which would have a mutual body to regulate these two 
states. This suggestion was completely unacceptable for the 
United Nations, the Security Council, for us, and for everybody. 
But there is an intermediate plan put forward by the United 
Nations and the Russians and we are working on it now. We shall 
see what will happen, although we have no great hopes because 
yesterday they [the UN and the Russians] said that it was the 
maximum that they could suggest as our [Georgians'] suggestions 
were unacceptable for them [Abkhazians] and vice versa. 
  [Announcer] Batono Jaba, are the places where the 
peacekeeping forces will be deployed mentioned in the documents, 
or is this still to be discussed? 
  [Ioseliani] The question now is the political status [of 
Abkhazia]. As you know, the issue of deployment has fallen 
through. The Abkhazians then demanded the unacceptable: If the 
peacekeeping forces were to enter the territory adjacent to the 
Inguri river -- it was specified in the agreement that the UN 
peacekeeping forces would have been deployed in the conflict 
zone -- the Abkhazians demanded that peacekeeping forces also 
enter the territories near Zugdidi. I do not think that 
anything will be resolved today but we must still work on it. 
Nothing ventured, nothing gained! And besides, the world must 
learn what we are suggesting from the point of view of the 
political settlement. Probably everything will have been 
finished by tomorrow because I think nothing will happen today. 
  [Announcer] You have been listening to a member of the 
[Georgian] delegation at the Georgian-Abkhaz talks in Geneva.

  [Text] Tallinn, Apr 20, BNS -- The agreements on the 
protection and promotion of investments, on trade relations and 
protection of intellectual property, signed by Estonian Prime 
Minister Mart Laar and U.S. Vice President Al Gore in Washington 
Tuesday [19 April], are another step in the development of 
economic relations between the two countries after the 1992 
agreement on trade and investments. 
  The first of the two agreements, on the promotion and 
protection of investments, gives both countries a most favored 
status in investments with each other. The document also 
includes guarantees against expropriation, and sets the right to 
freely transfer profits, the Estonian Embassy in Washington says. 
  It defines the investors' rights on the territory of the 
other party in the agreement, as well as rules for the 
settlement of disputes. The document determines the fields of 
the economy where the countries have the right to introduce more 
favorable conditions for local investors. 
  The second agreement signed on Tuesday contains two separate 
sections. The section on trade relations covers different areas 
of trade except for textiles and clothes -- a sphere that is to 
be regulated under a separate agreement. 
  Section Two of the document in about the protection of 
intellectual property. This is the first agreement to be signed 
by Estonia with a foreign country that in a detailed manner 
establishes rules for the protection of intellectual property 
rights.

<F P=106> [Report attributed to BNS: "Government Toughens Rules for </F>
Arming National Defense System"] 
  [Text] From now on, the national defense system will be 
supplied with arms and ammunition only by the Lithuanian Arms 
Fund. This decision was adopted by the government, which also 
approved the rules for the national defense system to acquire, 
keep account of, store, and distribute arms and ammunition. 
Under the 8 April resolution, firearms and ammunition will now 
be assigned to the national defense structure only by the 
national defense minister's order, and to units of this 
structure -- by order of their commanders and chiefs. 
  Fixed rules will be defined by the minister, following the 
national defense statutes and requirements: The account of 
firearms must be centralized, indicating their caliber, make, 
number, and price. All arms and ammunition must be kept in 
storehouses, which must be installed to ensure reliable arms 
protection. Arms can be distributed only to guards, daytime 
patrol services, as well as for scheduled exercises. 
  In other cases, arms and ammunition can be distributed only 
with the permission of the national defense minister, the Army 
chief, the chief of the General Staff, the chief of the State 
Border Defense Service, and the director of the Civil Defense 
Department. 
  The minister's order allows officials of the national 
defense 
system to always carry pistols and revolvers. The loss of 
firearms and ammunition must be immediately reported to the 
Prosecutor General's Office, a city or regional prosecutor's 
office, the national defense minister, the Army commander, the 
chief of the State Border Defense Service, and the director of 
the Civil Defense Department. A quota is set in each such case. 
  According to the resolution, important state and other 
facilities are guarded with service arms only after the 
government adopts a decision on their protection. Officials of 
the national defense system are accountable for the illegal 
possession and use of arms under Lithuanian law.

  [Text] [Announcer L. Panova] Vladimir Shumeyko, chairman of 
the Federal Assembly [as heard], held a routine traditional 
roundtable in Moscow today. The journalists who assembled there 
learned about his views on a number of currently topical issues, 
specifically, on developing cooperation between CIS countries. 
  [Begin Shumeyko recording] As chairman of the Council of 
Heads of State, the president has proposed drawing up a 
long-term plan. Two councils of ministers -- the Council of 
Foreign Ministers and the Council of Defense Ministers -- have 
been instructed to prepare an initial document, a draft plan for 
CIS development toward integration. [end recording] 
  [Panova] In Vladimir Shumeyko's view, after such a plan is 
adopted, the CIS charter will be somewhat amended. 
  [Begin Shumeyko recording] The point is that it was very 
clearly mentioned at the Council of Heads of State and at the 
Council of Heads of Government that members of the Commonwealth 
must not be in a state of war with each other. There is, 
perhaps, no other case in the whole world when members of the 
same commonwealth are fighting each other. I am speaking about 
Azerbaijan and Armenia. [end recording] 
  [Panova] Regarding Russia joining the NATO Partnership for 
Peace program, Shumeyko stressed that a clear mechanism for 
implementing decisions is the main condition to be observed here.

<F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS diplomatic correspondents Boris Krivoshey and </F>
Aleksandr Krylovich] 
  [Text] Moscow, 19 Apr -- The Russian Foreign Ministry 
believes that the incident which arose in connection with a 
publication of "an order by the Russian President Boris Yeltsin 
on setting up military bases in CIS states and Latvia" is 
closed. This was announced today at a briefing by Mikhail 
Demurin, deputy director of the Foreign Ministry's Information 
and Press Department. 
  He underlined that "all the necessary explanations have been 
provided at the necessary level. We will not provide any 
further explanations". 
  M. Demurin reiterated that "no one has seen this document" 
at 
the Russian Foreign Ministry. Therefore, he said, "it would be 
very strange to carry out some or other investigation at the 
Foreign Ministry with regard to a document prepared by the 
president's administration, if that is indeed the case."

bases in CIS states with their consent, Russian Defence Minister 
Pavel Grachev said on Wednesday. 
  The announcement was made after the signing of an 
inter-governmental agreement on military and technical 
cooperation between Russia and Turkey in Moscow today. 
  Grachev said Russia will have three military bases in 
Georgia 
and two in Armenia. In Azerbaijan, Russia plans to establish a 
military facility which is vital not only for Russia, but also 
for other CIS states. He said it will be a missile warning post 
in Gaballa.

<F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS correspondents Andrey Parlariya and Sergey </F>
Ostanin] 
  [Text] Moscow, 20 Apr -- Army General Pavel Grachev, the 
Russian defense minister, considers that the Bosnian conflict 
can only be resolved by political means. "We reject the use of 
air strikes by UN-operated aircraft, regarding it as extremely 
dangerous," the Russian minister stressed today after signing a 
Russian-Turkish agreement on cooperation in the 
military-technical sphere. He feels that this path will not 
yield any positive results whatsoever. On the contrary, Pavel 
Grachev pointed out, these "often inaccurate strikes humiliate 
the military." 
  He said that the Russian Defense Ministry does not have a 
clear view of the situation around the Bosnian town of Gorazde. 
"We do not believe in whitewashing the Bosnian Serbs. Both 
warring parties are to blame in this situation," Pavel Grachev 
noted. The minister disclosed that on Sunday he had spoken to 
General Mladic, the commander of the Serb Army in Bosnia, and 
had asked him not to attack Gorazde. As a result, the defense 
minister added, the Serbs held their fire for two days, but the 
immediate response of the other side was to go on the offensive. 
  Replying to a question on the possibilities of sending 
additional Russian peacekeeping forces to the former Yugoslavia, 
Pavel Grachev stressed that 200-300 men would not improve the 
situation. In his opinion, in order to solve the Bosnian 
problem by military means it would be necessary to enlist 
60-70,000 servicemen of the UN peacekeeping forces. "But this 
is unrealistic," he noted. "This would mean the beginning of 
large-scale combat operations, war." 
  In Pavel Grachev's opinion, the Russian president's 
initiative, which was expressed on 19 April during his telephone 
conversation with German Federal Chancellor Helmut Kohl, is 
worthy of attention. 
  It essentially means that the presidents of Russia and the 
United States, the leaders of the countries of the European 
Community, and the political and military leaders of the former 
Yugoslavia should meet in any European country to discuss the 
prospects for a way out of the crisis.

  [Text] Moscow, 20 Apr -- The bombardment by Bosnian Serbs 
of civilian targets in Gorazde cannot be justified and goes 
against the interests of the Serbs themselves and against the 
interests of Russia, Russian Foreign Minister Andrey Kozyrev 
said today, speaking before journalists after talks with 
international mediators Lord Owen and Thorvald Stoltenberg. 
  At the same time, Russia's chief diplomat continued, it is 
impossible to agree with the logic of increasing NATO air 
strikes in so far as this would run the risk of an escalation. 
It would be a mistake on the part of NATO and the Western 
states to make a decision on the possibility of further military 
escalation without at least simultaneously having a coordinated 
political approach. 
  Now, more than ever before, Kozyrev emphasized, the time has 
come for Russia, the United States, the United Nations, and the 
European Union to work out a joint political stance before the 
conflicting sides, so that they are left with no doubts 
reagarding the need to come to an agreement instead of going 
from one crisis to another. At the same time, the Serbian side 
must understand that each step along the path of a comprehensive 
cessation of hostilities will be accompanied by a corresponding 
lifting of sanctions.

  [Text] Moscow April 20 TASS -- The Russian Security Council 
discussed on Wednesday Russia's policy in the Caucasus and the 
implementation of previous decisions calling for support for 
Russian Cossacks, the presidential press service said. 
  Participants in the meeting which was chaired by President 
Boris Yeltsin stressed that Russia's policy in the Caucasus 
should aim at expanding mutually beneficial cooperation with all 
countries of the region, promoting their social and economic 
development, reaching civic accord and restoring stability in 
the region. 
  On the question of state support for Cossacks, the council 
called for working out as soon as possible a federal programme 
for their support. At present, the implementation of decisions 
in this sphere is being hindered by the passivity of federal and 
local bodies of power, lack of coordination and ineffective 
legislation. 
  Yeltsin urged the government, concerned ministries and 
departments to take practical measures to work out and realise 
Russia's policy in the Caucasus and provide state support for 
Russian Cossacks. 
  The press service said that the council also discussed the 
situation in Bosnia and Gorazde. Its members expressed the hope 
that there is still a possibility of resolving the crisis by 
peaceful means.

<F P=106> ["Press Review" -- ITAR-TASS headline] </F>
  [Text] Moscow April 22 TASS -- Central newspapers highlight 
two most important events today -- Russo-Ukrainian talks on the 
Black Sea Fleet and an anniversary of Vladimir Lenin's birth. 
  The NEZAVISIMAYA GAZETA writes that according to a 
trustworthy source, Ukraine expressed readiness to lease 
Sevastopol to Russia for a term of five years as the main base 
of the Black Sea Fleet with the subsequent extension of the 
lease and remove the headquarters and other facilities of the 
Ukrainian Navy from Sevastopol. 
  However, Kiev insists that the Black Sea Fleet marines 
abandon the cities of Ismail, Ochakov, Odessa, Nikolayev and 
Crimean settlements. Russia agrees to Kiev's proposals in the 
main, but objects to the removal of its units from the towns of 
Feodosia and Novoozerny (Donuzlava). Ukraine suggests dividing 
the fleet in half so that 15-20 per cent of warships and 
auxiliary vessels remain in the possession of the Ukrainian Navy 
and the remainder (30-35 per cent) be transferred to Russia on 
mutually advantageous terms. "It seems that only the Russian 
side is willing to undo a tight naval knot tied around the Black 
Sea Fleet and only in part concerning payments of overdue wages 
to the personnel of the fleet," said Russian Defence Minister 
Pavel Grachev. 
  "The first round of talks between delegations of the Russian 
and Ukrainian Defence Ministries ended to no avail," the 
newspaper said. 
  KRASNAYA ZVEVZDA writes that passions running high at the 
talks and their complexity leave no doubt that the final 
document "will be borne in pain", and there are no guarantees 
that mutual understanding will be reached in the course of one 
session only. 
  The delegations are planning to work an extra day on April 
22 
when a news conference devoted to the results of the talks will 
be held. "One would like to hope that emotions and mutual 
reluctance to accept each other's positions will not take the 
upper hand at the talks. Politicians have had they say on the 
matter. Now, a fair division of the Black Sea Fleet depends on 
the common sense of the military, " the newspaper said. 
  The newspaper SEGODNYA writes that "by all appearances, the 
Russian side was prepared to make serious concessions to 
Ukraine. At least, Russian Defence Minister Pavel Grachev hinted 
at a meeting with the personnel of the Black Sea Fleet on 
Thursday that former Black Sea naval bases in Odessa, Nikolayev 
and Ismail are likely to be transferred to Ukraine on condition 
that 85 per cent of ships of the Black Sea Fleet remains in 
Russia's possession. (We shall transfer 15 per cent to Ukraine 
and subsequently, buy them from Ukraine, the minister said). At 
the same time the Ukrainian delegation arrived at the talks with 
rather a tough goal: Sevastopol must remain a naval base under 
double Russo-Ukrainian jurisdiction," the newspaper said. 
  Commenting on the anniversary of Vladimir Lenin's birth, the 
newspaper RABOCHAYA TRIBUNA writes that the Lenin museum marks 
its 70th anniversary on April 22. In old days, the date used to 
be celebrated with proper pomposity, but now, the situation is 
different. "Is this fair and whether those who have embarked 
upon the road of downright blemishing their own history have 
made a mistake? All these questions will have to be answered 
yet," the newspaper said. 
  The newspaper NOVAYA YEZHEDNEVNAYA GAZETA writes that "there 
is no "nationwide April" now, no May 1 holiday, and many people 
say that there is even no Victory Day now. However, these dates 
survive by themselves and cause genuine concern. New leaders 
capable of making a crowd go against the authorities and stage 
pogroms, hiding behind the back of hungry old women, are being 
born during these days, which is seen from the example of the 
last May 1 holiday. New authorities are afraid of these 
holidays and post guards of special task force and riot police, 
the newspaper said. 
  The newspaper SAN PETERBURGSKIYE VEDOMOSTI writes that no 
emergency measures are planned to be taken in St. Petersburg by 
the command of northwest interior troops. All building and 
facilities of interior troops will be heavily guarded during 
these days. No special task force units are expected to appear 
in the streets of the city. 
  The newspaper TRUD carries an interview with deputy chairman 
of the Russian Government and minister for the affairs of 
nationalities and regional politics, Sergey Shakhray, devoted to 
the problem of Cossacks. According to Shakhray, the Russian 
Government will submit a draft law to the State Duma and adopt 
its own resolutions on tax privileges, problems of Cossacks' 
land owning and will render assistance in holding a session of 
the all-Russia Cossack union scheduled in autumn. 
  The NEZAVISIMAYA GAZETA writes about a ceremony of bidding 
farewell to Russian troops withdrawn from Germany. 
  The KOMSOMOLSKAYA PRAVDA publishes an extract from a book by 
Sergey Beriya, the son of the former Soviet Interior Minister 
Lavrentiy Beriya, executed in 1953, containing reminiscences if 
his father.

  [Text] In the course of the discussion on the draft 
Agreement on public accord held by the State Duma several 
factions spoke against its signing. 
  In particular, leader of Russia's Agrarian Party Mikhail 
Lapshin called it unacceptable. As he said, according to 
Agrarians, the draft Agreement "goes astray from the 
Constitution" because it negates the opportunities to introduce 
changes into the Basic Law, contained in it, and the 
opportunities for holding early elections. Lapshin compared the 
agreement with "a tough bridle" for political parties. He also 
qualified the present situation with peasants in Russia, their 
"humiliation and oppression" as unacceptable for a civilized 
society. 
  On behalf of the Yabloko faction Vyacheslav Shestakovskiy, 
co- chairman of Russia's republican party, expressed doubt with 
respect to "the expediency of signing these documents which 
cannot really lead to any accord." In his opinion, the proposed 
agreement is a means "to divert the Duma and the government from 
the real politics and real reforms." At the same time 
Shestakovskiy underlined that his faction is not against accord 
and is ready to start a search for it "in practical deeds and 
parliamentary work." 
  Representative of Russia's Democratic Party faction Aleksey 
Leushkin pointed out that his position with respect to the 
agreement would be determined after the national congress of the 
Democratic Party of Russia scheduled for Saturday. However, as 
he said, this document has the aim "to drive everyone into a 
trap," because the president and the government "who can do 
nothing to draw the country out of the crisis intend to place 
the responsibility for this on other people." 
  Some time earlier leaders of the Communist Party and Russian 
Pan- National Union Gennadiy Zyuganov and Sergey Baburin were 
very critical about this document; and chairman of the Liberal 
Democratic Party of Russia Vladimir Zhirinovskiy set forth a 
provision that the party would support the agreement only in the 
case that Andrey Kozyrev, Viktor Yerin, and Anatoliy Chubays 
resign. 
  In the course of the debates leader of Russia's Choice bloc 
Yegor Gaydar declared about his readiness to sign the proposed 
draft agreement. In his estimate, the agreement says that the 
public forces take the obligation to act in the framework of the 
Constitution and the acting legislation and not to act in a way 
inducive to violence and confrontation. At the same time Gaydar 
noted that "we understand that there exist certain restrictions 
when we want to reach accord with those who again want to 
introduce rationing tickets, to create long lines, and to again 
pull Russia into a Cold War." 
  Meanwhile, the presidential aide Georgiy Satarov believes 
that the agreement "proposes mechanisms ensuring political 
stability in society" and helps "to remove conflicts" in the 
relations between the authorities and political forces at the 
earliest stages.

<F P=106> [From the "Presidential Bulletin" feature: compiled by </F>
Nikolay Zherebtsov, Andrey Petrovskiy, edited by Vladimir 
Shishlin] 
  [Text] Interfax is in possession of a copy of the amended 
draft of a Yeltsin-proposed civic accord to be discussed at a 
Friday meeting between the president and leaders of various 
factions. IF Note: Yeltsin himself told regional leaders on 
Wednesday that the Friday conference would be a final one before 
the signing ceremony takes place on April 28. 
  The compilers of the draft have now renamed the paper into 
Civic Accord and deleted any reference to the 1991 and 1993 
events as a cause for a possible social confrontation. 
  However, they retained the clause binding the signatories to 
refrain from any destabilizing constitutional amendments though 
allowing possible amendments in following directions: human 
rights guarantees, improved power sharing, local self- 
management and federalization. The clause banning campaigns in 
favor of early general or presidential elections is also kept 
intact. 
  Unlike its original version, the new draft sets down in 
detail the obligations that the federal authorities will 
undertake in political and economic areas. 
  The Federal Assembly is expected soon to adopt legislation 
on 
elections, referendums, political parties, the citizens' right 
to form associations and hold demonstrations and marches or take 
other social or political actions. The two houses of parliament 
are also to be responsible for creating a legal groundwork to 
overcome the country's social and economic crisis and adopting 
statutes on the government and budget, land code and other acts. 
  For its part, the government is committed to curb inflation 
and ensure financial stabilization in 1994: secure higher 
investment and set conditions for economic growth: ensure the 
implementation of social partnership principles and so on. 
  The section of the paper dealing with national security 
matters has been enlarged. The draft now provides for Speakers 
of the two houses to be involved in national security council 
meetings and for appropriate committee heads to take part in the 
proceedings by interdepartmental council commissions. 
  The original version authorized a conciliatory commission to 
raise the question of expulsion of an offending party from the 
list of signatories for violation of the accord and bring 
proposals on the accountability of an offender little short of a 
job dismissal or withdrawal of a parliamentary mandate. 
However, the new one says the conciliatory commission to made 
up of representatives of the president, government, the two 
houses of parliament, Yeltsin's public chamber and Russian trade 
unions is called "to monitor the observance of provisions laid 
down in the accord". 
  The draft's new section on a signing ceremony indicates that 
would be signatories include the president, parliamentary 
speakers, prime minister, regional leaders and official 
representatives of parliamentary factions, Yeltsin's public 
chamber and Russian trade unions with other parties to follow. 
  Head of the compilers' team Dr Boris Topornin of the Russian 
Academy of Sciences said the softening of a wording on the 
compliance with the accord was one of the main amendments. He 
said the authors had rejected a proposal to set up a monitoring 
body to be vested with almost legal powers to punish the 
offender. 
  "The main guarantee is not legal or political responsibility 
but the electorate's attitude. If the public accepts the 
accord, the signatories could hardly risk their reputation, 
rating or authority by reneging on their commitments", Topornin 
believes. 
  He stressed that none of the representatives of 
parliamentary 
groups had raised any objection to the paper as a whole while it 
was being drawn up. Topornin referred in particular to a 
Communist Party representative and quoted him as saying that 
"when scrutinized, the latest draft can serve as a basis for 
further work". 
  At the same time, Topornin thinks the Communists are most 
likely to give a negative response to the paper. On 
preconditions set by leaders of the Communist Party and other 
groups, he said "these have no bearing to the accord as such. I 
am used to those accusations and reprimands prompted by one off 
political considerations rather than by the quality of the paper 
itself". 
  In a speech to the lower house of parliament on Thursday, 
Topornin described the paper as being the result of a compromise 
and non-partisan approach reflecting the interests of the 
mainstream public sections. 
  For his part, presidential aide Georgiy Satarov says the 
document provides for mechanisms of ensuring internal stability 
and enabling to defuse confrontation between the government and 
parties at an early stage. 
  Leader of the Agrarian Party Mikhail Lapshin said his party 
would not sign the accord because of finding it unacceptable. 
He said the accord was leading away from the constitution 
because of denying the possibility of constitutional amendments 
or early elections. He likened the paper to a stranglehold on 
political parties. 
  The mere signing of the paper can hardly result in civic 
accord, one of the leaders of the Republican Party Vyacheslav 
Shostokovskiy said speaking on behalf of the Yavlinskiy-led 
alliance. He said the proposed paper was intended to divert the 
legislators and government form genuine politics and genuine 
reforms. However, Shostokovsky denied his faction was opposed 
to any accord as such pledging commitment to seek it in 
day-to-day business and law making. 
  Leader of the Russia's Choice Party Yegor Gaydar said his 
alliance would sign the paper. However he and his associates 
"are well aware of the slim chance of reaching comprise with 
those who want to re-issue ration cards and build up the world's 
longest queues or drag the country back to the cold war period". 
  In his view, the accord is intended to bind signatories to 
act within the framework of the constitution and existing laws 
but not to resort to violence or confrontation. 
  Aleksey Leushkin of the Democratic Party of Russia which is 
opposed to the draft said his party would shape up its stand 
after a national congress on Saturday. He lashed out against 
the draft on the grounds it failed to provide answers to crying 
issues. This also includes a question whether economic problems 
are to be resolved by a review of the budget or government 
reshuffle. Leushkin likened the paper to a trap since both the 
president and government who were unable to lead the country out 
of crisis wanted to shift the responsibility on others. 
  There was also a negative reaction to the accord from LDP 
[Liberal Democratic Party] and Communist Party leaders Vladimir 
Zhirinovskiy and Gennady Zyuganov. IF Note: In a speech to 
regional leaders on Wednesday, President Boris Yeltsin said the 
number of those who opposed the accord was insignificant. "We 
will not insist they sign the accord but will make their names 
known to the public at large as people who care least about 
Russians and Russia's revival", he said. 
  His spokesman Vyachelslav Kostikov told a news briefing on 
Thursday that the president was "optimistic about the chances of 
the accord being signed". He said Yeltsin was "aware that not 
everyone will sign the paper but is confident that 
representatives of the mainstream groups will approve it". On 
some misunderstanding about the signing procedure, Kostikov made 
it clear that April 28 must be seen as the date of both signing 
and implementing the paper. In the meantime, it will be open 
for signing by all parties concerned, he said.

  [Text] The speaker of the Russian State Duma Ivan Rybkin 
stated that he not disappointed with the discussion of a draft 
treaty on civil accord in the lower chamber of parliament on 
Thursday. Speaking to journalists, he said that speeches by 
deputies were "adequate considering what is happening in the 
country." 
  Rybkin considers that it is far from certain that political 
parties at their conferences, plenums and congresses scheduled 
for this weekend will support positions of their parliamentary 
factions which spoke against signing a civil accord agreement. 
  "Having been to the most remote regions of the country, 
where 
electricity appeared only in the `70s, I get convinced that 
nobody wants conflict, people are seeking accord," the speaker 
pointed out. 
  Rybkin said that during his meeting with the president 
scheduled for April 22 at 15:00 he intends to discuss with Boris 
Yeltsin a further course of debates over the draft agreement. 
  "This is very difficult issue. We should sew with a thin 
needle, and not to take a pitchfork and thrust it in deputies' 
sides," the speaker of the State Duma noted.

<F P=106> [Report by Yevgeniy Skukin: "Passions Over Privatization"] </F>
  [Text] What will the second stage of privatization 
actually be like? After 1 July will Anatoliy Chubays and his 
team manage to channel this progress toward attracting 
investments in industry and the development of production? The 
disputes which flared up over this subject at the parliamentary 
hearings showed once again how the deputies' political positions 
differ and how firmly politics and the economy are still welded 
together. 
  Summing up the ideologically close speeches of 
representatives of several factions -- Adrian Puzanovskiy ("New 
Regional Policy"), Vladimir Lisichkin (Liberal Democratic Party 
of Russia), and Valentin Martemyanov (Russian Federation 
Communist Party) -- one can draw the conclusion that 
privatization did not have a human face to start with and will 
not have in the future. 
  The opponents of A. Chubays' program believe that not one of 
the set tasks has been fulfilled. 
  "We will not accept the idea of the suspension of 
privatization," said Sergey Ivanenko, the "Yabloko" spokesman 
and deputy chairman of the committee for property, 
privatization, and economic activity. "Such a step will have no 
political success." The bloc's concept for post-voucher 
privatization is as follows: A program is needed for the 
reorganization of enterprises which are now reminiscence of 
collective farms. For this it is necessary, first, to create a 
law on privatization and a system of voluntary bankruptcies. 
Second, we must move from the mass process of privatization to 
specific work with each enterprise. And the most important 
element is that it is essential to expand the front of 
privatization -- to begin to regulate privatization in other 
spheres." 
  Anatoliy Chubays, chairman of the State Committee for the 
Administration of State Property [Goskomimushchestvo], reacted 
with understanding to the deputies' contradictory assessments of 
his program -- this reflects the feelings of different groups of 
the population. Some say that the process is dragging one and 
that privatization must be carried out more rapidly. Others, on 
the contrary, are speaking of a privatization blitzkrieg. But, 
A. Chubays explained, the target for the pace of privatization 
was not formulated by the Goskomimushchestvo and not by the 
government but... by the former Russian Federation Supreme 
Soviet. The "privatization program" it adopted states that the 
Russian Federation Goskomimushchestvo must complete the 
transformation of small and medium enterprises into joint stock 
companies by 1 October 1992. So that the privatizers did not 
even keep to that deadline. "If the State Duma adopts any other 
laws," A. Chubays stressed, "we shall act in accordance with 
them."

<F P=106> [Igor Karpenko report: "Anatoliy Chubays: Different Kind </F>
of Privatization After 1 July"] 
  [Text] People at the Supreme Soviet used to attend 
"privatization sessions" like a bullfight -- expecting thrills 
aplenty. Echoes of the struggle for ownership were also 
manifest 19 April at the final phase of the parliamentary 
hearings at the State Duma. There were political attacks from 
Liberal Democratic Party of Russia deputies and Communists, 
extremist assessments, and so forth. 
  Nonetheless, the overwhelming sentiment was more favorable 
than before, and there was a more businesslike attitude to the 
results of voucher privatization and the problems of "monetary" 
privatization. Rather, opponents are persuaded of the futility 
of trying to change any aspect of the pace and terms of voucher 
privatization before 1 July -- when voucher privatization comes 
to an end. 
  Probably the only real threat to the privatizers' plans 
comes 
from the proposals to exclude fuel and energy complex property 
from the auction program at the final stage of the voucher 
auctions and, after 1 July, to declare a temporary moratorium on 
privatization so as to "take stock, think everything through," 
and "not repeat past mistakes." Anatoliy Chubays dealt with the 
familiar arsenal of accusations about the "wholesale" nature of 
privatization (there was even a new version -- "blitzkrieg") 
using arguments and normative document paragraphs that are also 
familiar. 
  After the hearings A. Chubays told journalists about the 
task 
set by Viktor Chernomyrdin of submitting a draft law on the 
monetary phase of privatization to the government by 1 May. 
"Work however you like -- even day and night," was 
Chernomyrdin's parting shot to the special commission, "but make 
sure that there are no shocks when the vouchers are exchanged 
for rubles." 
  To be frank, the timetable is very tight. All the more so 
as, in the opinion of commission head Chubays, two documents 
will have to be drawn up -- a law which parliament should 
ratify, and a second version, in the shape of a presidential 
edict, in the event of any possible holdups. 
  I asked Anatoliy Chubays whether it is possible to hope for 
even one-tenth of the amount of privatization at the new stage 
after 1 July. 
  "Of course," he replied, "there are some natural reasons for 
the slowing of the pace -- there is far less demand for 
privatization for money than there was for privatization by 
voucher. But this will not mean a halt; it will merely be a 
different kind of privatization. I am confident, though, that 
the reduction will not be tenfold, but far less."

<F P=106> [Dmitriy Kamin report: "Mikhail Zadornov Acquires Monopoly"] </F>
  [Text] The body of Duma deputies continues to explore 
actively the rights and functions of legislative power. 
Yesterday, the subject of a clash between Yabloko and the NRP 
[New Regional Policy] was the placing under Duma jurisdiction of 
the Control- Budget Committee, whose functional possibilities 
are very highly assessed by KOMMERSANT-DAILY experts. 
  The Control-Budget Committee (CBC) was created under the 
Supreme Soviet 18 months ago for financial oversight of the 
government. Resulting from the September 1993 events, it ended 
up, in accordance with the president's edict, under the 
jurisdiction of the Council of Ministers itself. Early in 1994, 
the government, yielding to the urging of the Duma's budget 
committee (with Mikhail Zadornov as chairman), restored the CBC 
to parliament. The Duma lent legitimacy to this action by a 
decree under which the CBC is supposed to exercise the functions 
of keeping tabs on the budget. Thus, before a special law on an 
Accounts Chamber [Schetnaya Palata] is passed, the CBC happens 
to be in charge of vetting the spending of budget funds 
(credits, grants, and subsidies), as well as the finances of 
nonbudget funds. This enables the CBC soon to become a serious 
Duma tool to influence the government. Zadornov (Yabloko) is 
planning to use the committee as a foundation on which to build 
an Accounts Chamber. 
  The Duma, however, has already elected the chamber's 
chairman 
-- Khachim Karmokov ("Independent Regional Policy"). Notably, 
the group's leader, Vladimir Medvedev, was dissatisfied with the 
actions of Mikhail Zadornov who managed, at the time of voting, 
to avoid mentioning in the CBC decree the Accounting Chamber's 
powers. At the same time, the chairman of the CBC structure 
(under the decree) cannot be confirmed unless presented and 
approved by the Budget Committee. This amounts to the Zadornov 
committee's monopoly in matters of budget control until an 
Accounts Chamber law goes into effect. Remarkably, Medvedev 
believes that Zadornov has deliberately dragged his feet on 
passing this law.

<F P=106> [Aleksandr Golovenko report: "Hard Currency Exercise, Or </F>
How Foreign Consuls and Ambassadors, With the Help of Government 
Functionaries, Dealt With Our Inspector"] 
  [Text] I may be wrong, but I think that nothing of such 
social importance to Russia as Tuesday's parliamentary hearings 
in the Security Committee has taken place in the State Duma 
since the political amnesty. At first glance the agenda 
appeared more trivial than sensational and intriguing: "On 
Instances of the Blatant Violation of Tax and Labor Legislation 
by Officials of St. Petersburg and Russia." On a superficial 
examination you might have seen a banal case of the sort that 
used to be heard in the USSR People's Control Committee. Okay, 
you would have thought, the chief of a tax inspectorate was 
fired, got himself reinstated via the courts, and was again 
fired. What does this labor dispute have to do with the 
Security Committee? 
  In fact, that was the sort of question a group of committee 
members "kicked off" with: Should we be getting involved? 
Wouldn't it be better to send the papers to judicial organs? 
And why did some of us receive the documents rather late? 
Wouldn't it be better to set up a commission and recheck 
everything again? 
  Committee head V. Ilyukhin, who chaired the hearings, swept 
aside the unjustified reproaches and called for constructive 
work. Both we journalists and the committee members were handed 
a very thick bundle of documents from which the criminal 
background to the question was perfectly clear. Incidentally, 
PRAVDA wrote about it in its report headlined "Why Does Filippov 
Enjoy Authority?" 14 December last year. New details have 
emerged today. 
  Dmitriy Nikolayevich Filippov is one of those leaders to 
whom 
the so-called "democrats" applied what is in their view an 
offensive description -- "party nomenklatura." Suffice it to 
say that he headed the Baykal-Amur Railroad headquarters on 
authorization from the All-Union Leninist Communist Youth League 
Central Committee and before the smashing of the CPSU in August 
1991 he worked as industry secretary of the Leningrad party 
oblast committee. During the "reform" years he created the tax 
inspectorate in Leningrad literally from scratch -- a totally 
new and unfamiliar job. And he repeatedly proclaimed the total 
depoliticization of this structure: All forms of ownership are 
the same to us, he said. The most important thing is to ensure 
that people observe the law and pay their taxes. The press 
wrote plenty about how those former "saviors of the economy," 
members of cooperatives, concealed income. They brought these 
same little tricks with them when they turned their shady 
concerns into small businesses, private businesses, and joint 
ventures. But how could they conceal dividends from Filippov 
and his people when they were perfectly well aware of the 
potential of every plant in the city, large and small? In the 
meantime he had also set up a tax police -- to investigate cases 
of the concealment of income -- and set about tackling the 
street "commercial stores," which in defiance of all edicts and 
decrees had not bothered to provide themselves with cash 
registers. Soon people were coming to see him from dozens of 
oblasts to hear his experience -- after all, it's a new venture! 
Even City Mayor A. Sobchak held him up as an example. Visiting 
the inspectorate collective one day, he said approximately the 
following: "The State Tax Inspectorate for St. Petersburg has 
rapidly found its feet, and it is to a considerable extent 
thanks to this that not only do we not have a budget deficit, 
but we can also do a great deal for people in the social sphere." 
  He turned out to be a livestock raiser, former sovkhoz 
director, and later an official at City Hall. The voluble 
Deputy A. Nevzorov, addressing V. Gusev, asked: 
  "You removed a first-class specialist, citing some sort of 
omissions. But he probably has no equal in the whole of mother 
Russia. And in his place you put someone with no experience of 
tax affairs or the fight against swindlers." 
  The chief tax inspector, red-faced, did not know what to say 
to the hail of questions. Why did D. Filippov, whom he had 
earlier praised and held up as an example, overnight become "no 
good"? Who made the call from the Council of Ministers that led 
to his dismissal? If he was held to be responsible for 
"omissions," why did the wording of his dismissal say "staff 
cuts"? 
  In his address to State Duma Chairman I. Rybkin the 
dismissed 
person explained the persecution as follows, in particular: 
"According to Yu.M. Ulyanov, deputy chief of the Russian State 
Tax Service, the reason was a letter from St. Petersburg Mayor 
A.A. Sobchak and pressure from First Vice Premier Ye.T. 
Gaydar...." 
  I can also quote an extremely piquant bit of the information 
supplied to committee members and journalists. It says that A. 
Sobchak, A. Chubays, Ye. Gaydar, and former Finance Minister B. 
Fedorov are implicated in the "unexplained dismissal" of D. 
Filippov. 
  See what levers of power the aggrieved ambassadors and 
consuls had to use to get rid of the overly intractable and 
incorruptible financial inspector! But neither Chubays, nor 
Gaydar, nor Fedorov, though they were invited, honored the 
committee session with their presence or were able to provide 
explanations "regarding the reasons for the dismissal." 
  In their speeches representatives of the counterintelligence 
services, the Security Council, the tax police, the Russian 
Federation Prosecutor's Office, and Deputies S. Govorukhin, Yu. 
Vlasov, A. Nevzorov, N. Krivelskaya, and others spoke of 
colossal embezzlement of the country's natural resources and 
hard currency and the huge sums ending up in foreign banks. 
Just as you can tell the chemical composition of an ocean from 
a single drop of water, the rejoinders noted, so you can tell 
from this single case that Russia is being robbed. And the most 
terrible thing of all is that an incorruptible and professional 
specialist has fallen foul precisely of government officials. 
So whom do they serve? The conclusion is obvious: We are no 
longer masters in our own country if a principled civil servant 
acting in the interests of his own country can be simply 
dismissed at the whim of a foreign consul or ambassador. 
  Summing up the debate, Committee Chairman Viktor Ilyukhin 
said the following: There is money in Russia. Enough for the 
miners, students, and teachers as well. But it is being 
artificially pumped into commercial structures. Statehood is 
being deliberately destroyed: Millions of people are suffering 
from mutual nonpayments, plants and factories are at a 
standstill. And the blame for this lies not least with the 
government, which, as we have seen, has very little interest in 
filling the state exchequer. 
  The "great deal" consisted of bread subsidies, grants to 
people on low incomes, free lunches for schoolchildren, free 
travel for pensioners, and so forth. In fact, this was indeed 
the explanation: By putting the squeeze on wheeler-dealers who 
were concealing their income and tax-dodging, Filippov's service 
was doing a lot to boost the city and republic budgets. And, it 
transpires, he was serving not the regime but the teachers, 
medics, students, and staffers of scientific establishments who 
experience constant wage arrears thanks to the government, 
forcing them to go on strike. Filippov hired proven, competent 
people, even KGB officers, it is said. 
  Of course, the checks, indictments running into many pages, 
and fines irritated the wheeler-dealers ensconced in many 
enterprises, commercial structures, and private stores. The 
city's chief financial inspector began to receive phone calls 
from City Hall advising him to "go easy." Here are just a few 
instances from his account to the committee: 
  "When we touched on a kind of sacred cow -- the property 
fund 
-- we were simply staggered by the scale of the swindling. As a 
result of the inspections we discovered 6.623 billion rubles [R] 
that had not been distributed (in other words, concealed -- 
Editorial Office). Of course, they got a fine of R400 million, 
plus 10 percent of the sum that ought to have been paid into the 
budget. As I'm sure you realize, nobody would like that sort of 
thing. Furthermore, it transpired that 44,000 vouchers had 
mysteriously vanished in this privatization establishment, and 
Fishkov, deputy general director of the fund, was arrested over 
missing checks worth R134 million...." 
  It also transpired that, in defiance of the law, the fund 
had 
privatized virtually entire neighborhoods and port 
installations. But nevertheless, it turned out that the real 
point lay elsewhere. The fund did not pay all revenue into a 
special account, but, as it were, "lent" it to commercial banks 
are a ridiculously low interest rate -- all of 2 percent! 
  "We are not children," Dmitriy Nikolayevich said to the 
deputies, "and we must realize that businessmen are not given 
such incredible benefits merely because somebody likes the look 
of their face." 
  The real storm erupted when D. Filippov set up a special 
group to inspect joint ventures. He even managed to get in 
here, where not every investigator would poke his nose. And, 
just think, the very first audit of the "Europa Hotel" uncovered 
a staggering picture of theft. This joint venture preferred to 
keep its dividends in Stockholm, naturally without paying a cent 
into our budget. The financial inspectors fined the Swedes $5 
million, but, as Dmitriy Nikolayevich said, "it will take a lot 
more sweat to make them return the $25 million working for the 
Swedish economy." 
  The inspectors also trod on the toes of the "Lenraumamebel" 
joint venture, so greatly admired by A. Sobchak. This respected 
establishment has used almost free raw materials and cheap 
energy and manpower to manufacture furniture and has sold almost 
90 percent of it abroad for hard currency. And that is where 
the currency stayed, aiding the "revival of Finland." 
  "When we made the Finns return the hard currency and pay 
taxes," D. Filippov continued, "a team of ambassadors and 
consuls was turned loose on me. They accused me of `sabotaging 
Yeltsin's policy.' My reply was: I am precisely supporting his 
policy by making you fulfill his edicts and our laws." 
  It was noticeable how journalists sitting alongside each 
other exchanged glances when the speaker disclosed the following 
detail -- The ambassadors and consults hinted to him: Who has 
got to call you for you to leave our joint ventures in peace? 
Sobchak? A member of the Russian Government? 
  The call soon came.... On 11 October, after the well known 
tragic events (as the assembled company immediately noted), V. 
Gusev, Russia's chief state tax inspector, fired D. Filippov 
without any explanation. Filippov was not intimidated and was 
reinstated via the Sverdlovskiy Rayon people's court in Moscow. 
But then there came an apparatus ploy familiar from the old days 
of reprisals against refractory people's control workers and 
other inspectors -- on 3 November a directive by V. Chernomyrdin 
himself appeared which seemingly abolished D. Filippov's post in 
St. Petersburg. His duties were entrusted to someone else, who 
was given the status of deputy leader of the Russian State Tax 
Service. What kind of a person was this?

<F P=106> [Sergey Brusin transcript of comments by Gennadiy </F>
Kalistratov, chairman of the State Duma Energy Subcommittee, 
under "In the State Duma" rubric: "Gennadiy Kalistratov, 
Chairman of the State Duma Energy Subcommittee: Law Still Not 
Written for Reactor"] 
  [Text] Nonpayments and the shortage of fuel and resources 
needed for normal operation are paralyzing the nuclear power 
industry. But even the country's first-ever Law "On the 
Utilization of Nuclear Power," which would have helped to 
eradicate many problems, passed two readings in the Supreme 
Soviet and...sank into oblivion. 
  The editorial office asked Gennadiy Kalistratov, chairman of 
the State Duma Energy Subcommittee, to tell us what, in his 
opinion, the legislative line on nuclear power should be. 
  [Kalistratov] To begin with, the draft of the stillborn law 
must be resurrected. Section 1 of it describes the evolution of 
a nuclear facility from conception to dismantlement. Mutual 
relations between the center and the regions are specified in 
the organizational and financial respect. Section 2 comprises 
compensation (moral, physical, and property) for both 
individuals and territories in the event of accidents. The 
responsibilities of components and authorities are set out. 
  A number of problems not covered in the draft law should be 
considered legislatively. For example, long-term storage of 
solid and liquid waste on the territory of stations and 
construction of regional burial sites. As well as questions of 
operating AES's [nuclear electric power stations] and market 
conditions. It is worthwhile to work out and incorporate into a 
normative document a mechanism for denationalizing nuclear power 
units. It is useful to utilize foreign experience here. Thus, 
in ancient "market" countries -- Britain and France -- the 
nuclear power industry is run by the state. This is evidently 
the most acceptable option for Russia. But the practice of 
private U.S. companies operating nuclear facilities is premature 
for us, bearing in mind the economic and technical might of 
these companies. In a period of reform and instability it makes 
more sense to leave the running of AES's exclusively to the 
state. 
  It is no less important to legislatively stimulate specific 
territories' interest in the construction of AES's. The 
three-stage coordination which exists in our country is 
retarding the solution of this question. The West has switched 
to a two-stage system: the local council and the government. 
  The funds received in the form of taxes from AES's are 
almost 
completely seized by the oblast. Sometimes the profits tax is 
shared out as follows: one-third to the republic budget, almost 
two-thirds to the oblast budget, and a mere one-tenth to the 
rayon in which the AES is located. Consequently the rayon has 
no objective interest in the AES. It undoubtedly makes sense to 
review the proportions of payments to the budget. 
  Furthermore, there is now an acute need to define the legal 
status of the 30-km zone's area and to indicate its rights in 
relation to a station and the economic foundations of 
development. 
  A special question is posed by the legislative definition of 
legal responsibility for circulating incorrect data on the 
effects of operating an AES and its effect on the environment. 
It is not only a question of ethics and politics but also one 
of economics. The point is that our country is one of the five 
world leaders in theoretical physics, technologies, and reactor 
construction, and in the spheres of enriching uranium and 
operating AES's. Russia has great export potential, and export 
earnings could maintain nuclear power collectives' prosperity 
for the entire period of market reforms and could even cover 
Western credits. Our country is now at the epicenter of a 
fierce clash between Western reactor construction competitors 
for a place in the market. A particularly keen struggle is 
going on for the East European, Near East, South Asian, and Far 
East zones of influence. An even more insidious aim is being 
set: To squeeze Russia out of...Russia itself. That is, to 
replace domestic equipment with Western equipment, payment being 
made in clean energy conveyed via a power line. And we are 
"kindly" being left with the nuclear waste. If this happens our 
domestic scientific and technological and operational experience 
will disappear forever. 
  Therefore an "ideological" struggle also lies ahead on the 
legislative level. Russia must have a national nuclear energy 
development program which matches its potential. A law 
approving this program is bound to become the mainspring of a 
whole package of normative documents in this sphere.

  [Text] Moscow April 22 TASS -- The Russian State Duma 
decided on Friday to hold parliamentary hearings on lifting 
sanctions against Yugoslavia. 
  The proposal was made by Aleksandr Vengerovskiy, deputy 
chairman of the Liberal Democratic Party of Vladimir 
Zhirinovskiy. 
  He also proposed to invite to the hearings representatives 
of 
all conflicting sides in former Yugoslavia. 
  Vengerovskiy said that, according to his information, 
representatives of Yugoslavia, Bosnian Serbs, Krajina Serbs, and 
Croatia "had already expressed the wish to participate in such 
hearings".

  [Text] The Chechen Republic does not intend to hold 
consultations with Russia, if political forces in opposition to 
the republic's president take part, Interfax was told by 
President Djokhar Dudayev, who added that today any 
Russian-Chechen negotiations and consultations are possible 
either at the summit level or between foreign ministers. "All 
the rest is indecent gambling. We have a large reserve of 
tolerance but it has its limits," he said. 
  The Russian president's chief of staff, Sergey Filatov, told 
Interfax earlier that Russian-Chechen consultations involving 
representatives of the various political forces in the Chechen 
Republic would take place in Moscow. 
  "Those called the Chechen opposition are criminals which 
settled in Moscow and are stirring up trouble to suit the 
interests of political profiteers. If Russia wants to negotiate 
with criminals, it is its own business," said Dudayev. 
  At present there is no political force in Russia which would 
fully control the situation and bear responsibility for the 
decision-making, said Dudayev. As to Boris Yeltsin, who is, 
indeed, the last and the only stronghold of legality in Russia, 
he, regrettably, is virtually barred from effecting control over 
the development of the Russian-Chechen relationships, said 
Dudayev. 
  That is why, he said, the Chechen government raises the 
question on the temporary moratorium for negotiations with 
Russia.

<F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS correspondent Tamara Zamyatina] </F>
  [Text] Moscow April 21 TASS -- Officials of the Russian 
Presidential Staff and Government are expected to meet in May 
for a series of consultations with various structures of the 
Chechen Republic to prepare talks between the Russian and 
Chechen leaderships, Chief of the Presidential Staff Sergey 
Filatov told TASS on Thursday. 
  He believes that "the public feelings in Chechnya, 
especially 
among the opposition to current President Dzhokhar Dudayev, are 
increasingly proving to the republic's aspiration for closer 
ties with Russia". 
  In contrast to Russian Minister for Nationalities and 
Regional Policy Sergey Shakhray, Filatov does not link the 
proposed talks to early elections in Chechnya. However, he 
still presses the republic for recognizing its status as a 
subject of the Federation and for concluding a bilateral 
agreement similar to that between Russia and Tatarstan. 
Chechnya has not yet clarified its stand on these two issues 
Russia lays down as the necessary condition for talks to get 
under way, the chief of the presidential staff noted. According 
to him, the Chechen side submitted its own draft of a bilateral 
agreement with Russia "which is on the whole quite acceptable 
for consideration in the course of talks", but remained rather 
inarticulate as concerns its status within the Russian 
Federation. 
  Filatov said Russia had a "tough" and a "soft" options in 
settling its differences with Chechnya. The "tough" one 
provides, in particular, for shifting the Russian railway from 
Chechen territory, since crime and plundering on the railway 
exceed all bounds. "but before resorting to tough measures, we 
should try soft ones", he pointed out.

  [Text] Vladikavkaz, 21 Apr -- The upcoming parliamentary 
hearings in the Federation Council and the meeting of the 
Russian Security Council, both of which will discuss the 
situation in the conflict zone, are yet another attempt at 
achieving a peaceful settlement of relations between North 
Ossetia and Ingushetia, Akhsarbek Galazov, president of the 
Republic of North Ossetia, said today in an interview with the 
ITAR-TASS correspondent before leaving by air for Moscow. 
  Akhsarbek Galazov said that North Ossetia is extremely 
interested in establishing normal relations with all its 
neighbors in the North Caucasus region and Transcaucasia. But 
the multinational people of the republic will not accept 
strong-arm methods to resolve these questions. Nor should one 
force the process involving the return of refugees to villages 
in Prigorodnyy Rayon. This complicated problem must be resolved 
by conciliation commissions on the basis of the Kislovodsk 
Agreements. 
  Speaking of the upcoming signing of the agreement on 
achieving civic accord in Russia, the republic's president 
stressed that North Ossetia supports the ideas of this document 
that are aimed at consolidating all the healthy forces in 
society. 
  However, Akhsarbek Galazov noted that "the sides are 
appealing to national movements and parties to declare a 
moratorium on putting forward demands for changes to be made to 
borders and existing administrative divisions." It is necessary 
to take off the agenda the issue of redrawing borders in the 
region. Galazov said that this could lead to a new tragedy not 
only in the North Caucasus, but also in the south of Russia.

  [Text] Tskhinvali, 21 Apr -- Russian troops deployed at the 
Russian-Georgian border, stepped up controls at the Roki tunnel 
near Buron village. Representatives of narcotics businesses, 
who used to smuggle vast amounts of narcotics, opposed this 
step. Making the controls tougher also caused discontent among 
the Ossetian separatists. 
  An IBERIA correspondent was told at the headquarters of the 
Georgian peacekeeping troops deployed in Tskhinvali that the 
Ossetian population of Tskhinvali had held a rally where they 
demanded that the Russian border troops be moved from the 
northern border of the so-called South Ossetia because the 
presence of the troops there means demarcating the state border 
between Russia and Georgia.

  [Text] The dumping of radioactive waste from Pacific Fleet 
submarines might be forced by the fact that there is nowhere to 
store the waste. Tankers with waste docked near the factory 
wharf of Zvezda in Bolshoy Kamen are filled to capacity, and can 
contain no more dangerous cargo. An ITAR-TASS correspondent was 
told this by Vladimir Ignatenko, representative of Russian 
president in the Maritime Kray. He said the government should 
have allocated funds to build a facility for processing the 
waste, but not a single ruble has been allocated for this 
purpose so far. Meanwhile, one of the tankers, which contains 
794 tonnes of waste, is in a dilapidated condition. Either the 
factory has to be stopped so that the already critical mass of 
radioactive liquid will not increase, or else it has to be 
dumped at sea. However, this may take place only after 
coordinating it with the Russian president, said Vladimir 
Ignatenko.

  [Text] Presently our fishermen are trying to break the 
vicious circle of mounting problems. Please listen to the tape 
sent to us by our Sakhalin journalist Lyudmila Fillipova. 
  [Begin recording] The critical situation in the oblast 
fishing industry is the center of attention of the industry 
council of trade unions. The council notes that the 
ill-conceived social and economic reform policies, the 
extortionate taxes, and the disparity between prices for primary 
products and energy resources has led to the ruination of the 
fishing industry, the sharp decline in the volume of production, 
the halt of a number of enterprises, and a huge wage debt. To 
avert the final collapse of the industry, the council of trade 
unions has sent State Duma deputies a number of proposals, for 
example: review the tax policy in respect to the Russian fishing 
industry; equate it to the advantages given to the agricultural 
industry as food producers; free the fishing industry from 
customs duties on import, export, and barter operations which 
would ensure a significant additional flow of supplies of fish 
products onto the domestic market; and a number of other 
proposals. 
  Hoping to find understanding in the State Duma, the industry 
council of trade unions has appealed to fishermen, fish 
processors, and leaders of economic and trade union 
organizations of the Far East fishing industry to show 
solidarity and support the above named demands. In connection 
with this appeal, the industry council of trade unions sent a 
letter to the Russian president, the prime minister, the 
government of Russia, and the chairman of the State Duma, which 
supports the demands stated in the decree of the 5th central 
committee plenum of the Russian fishing industry workers' trade 
union. Incidentally, the letter emphasizes that if the demands 
are not met, the trade union will be forced to take collective 
action. 
  I want to add that the Yuzhno-Kurilsk fishermen have already 
begun their strike. [end recording]

  [Text] Omsk -- The "Polet" Aerospace Association, which in 
the recent past manufactured the launch rockets for the "Buran" 
shuttle in Omsk, has obtained a license from the Russian agency 
granting it the right to launch Russian and foreign satellites. 
  "Polet" relies mainly on the "Cosmos" rocket, which is 
capable of lifting large numbers of satellites into orbit for a 
variety of purposes. Evidence from independent European experts 
testifies to the rocket's high class: Only 19 failures in 700 
launches is one of the world's best records. 
  The Russian rocket has a further advantage -- it is cheaper 
than foreign counterparts. All the same, it will not be easy to 
find buyers. The West dictates its own policy in the space 
commercial services market.

  [Text] Bashkortostan's President Murtaza Rakhimov believes 
that adoption of the agreement on civic peace and accord in 
Russia proposed by Boris Yeltsin can negatively affect the 
political and social-economic situation in the country. 
  Addressing the Wednesday sitting of the republic's 
Presidential Council, he underlined that introduction of a 
moratorium on acts of a political manner, proposed by the 
agreement, again postponed signing of the bilateral agreement 
between Russia and Bashkortostan for an indefinite time, 
Rakhimov noted that this is being done "at that very moment when 
all issues on this bilateral agreement have been coordinated in 
the course of years of difficult negotiations." 
  Members of the council called on the head of the republic 
not 
to sign this document because it is "a chauvinist document 
infringing upon the rights of the constituent members." 
According to the council, in general the agreement reminds of a 
directive from Moscow sent to the regions without minding the 
interests of the republics within the Russian Federation.

<F P=106> [Interview with Konstantin Maksimov, Kalmykia parliament </F>
speaker, by Boir Borboyev, in the "Kalmykia" column: "`The 
Problems of the People's Rehabilitation Will Be Resolved Before 
the End of This Year.' Parliament Chairman Konstantin Maksimov 
Hopes for Assistance from Moscow" -- place, date not given] 
  [Text] [Borboyev] Konstantin Nikolayevich, at what stage 
of resolution is the problem of rehabilitation of the Kalmyk 
people? 
  [Maksimov] I would like to single out three points in 
President Yeltsin's edict on rehabilitation of the Kalmyk people 
and on state support for its revival and development, signed at 
the end of last year. Kalmykia officials are working closely 
with the federal authorities in addressing these problems. 
Approximately 40 billion rubles from the Russian budget is 
needed to pay material compensation to those who suffered from 
repression, as well as members of their families. We find 
understanding in Moscow, and I think that before the end of the 
year the problem will be fully resolved. 
  [Borboyev] Does the republic itself envision any measures to 
compensate for the people's physical and moral losses? 
  [Maksimov] Yes, certainly. Our republic's president deems 
it essential to reduce the pensionable age for approximately 
30,000 persons who were formerly repressed. Our proposal on 
making additions to the Russian Law On State Pensions in the 
Russian Federation is currently being studied by federal bodies. 
The first volume of the Book of Memory (overall there will be 
two) has come out, which includes the names of all 
representatives of the Kalmyk people who died during the years 
of deportation. The republic's authorities are grateful to 
workers of the archives and libraries in Stavropol and 
Krasnoyarsk Krays, Astrakhan, Rostov, Volgograd, and a number of 
other oblasts who have shown understanding and preserved 
elements of spiritual, cultural, and religious values. This 
year the property of the Kalmyk people outside the republic will 
be returned. 
  [Borboyev] Will these benefits be extended to Kalmyks living 
outside the republic? 
  [Maksimov] Yes, this is envisioned by our legislative 
enactments because approximately 30,000 representatives of the 
Kalmyk people live in krays and oblasts of the Russian 
Federation, in particular in Siberia where they were deported 
illegally but by the will of fortune have stayed there up till 
now. 
  [Borboyev] How topical at present are Kalmykia's territorial 
claims, in particular on the neighboring Astrakhan Oblast? 
  [Maksimov] Our authorities have always -- before as well as 
after perestroyka -- been raising the question about the 
territories of Limannskiy and Dolbanskiy Rayons of Kalmykia 
which were illegally transferred to our neighbors. These are 
good pasture lands which could benefit the republic greatly. 
The problem remains, but at the present period we are for a 
moratorium on revising territorial borders. At the same time 
approximately 400,000 hectares of so- called "black" soil is 
leased from the republic by Dagestan and Astrakhan Oblast. And 
whereas a leasing agreement was reached with Dagestan last year, 
none has been made with Astrakhan Oblast so far. I consider it 
necessary to monitor the condition of our lands at the state 
level.

<F P=106> [Maks Khazin report: "Volgograd Authorities No Longer Suing </F>
IZVESTIYA"] 
  [Text] The Volgograd Oblast Administration had sued the 
IZVESTIYA Editorial Office and its own correspondent V. Kornev, 
demanding that it repudiate the information contained in his 
article "Volgograd Authorities Still Opposed to Reform" 
(IZVESTIYA No. 95, 22 May 1993). Incidentally, it took the 
authorities five months to decide whether to deny the report or 
not. Clearly, they were helped to make the "right" decision by 
the approaching elections. 
  The first judge to receive the case disqualified herself -- 
the local administration had promised to allocate an apartment 
to the Volgograd Central Rayon People's Court, and the judge 
considered that she had no right, as an interested party, to 
hear her "benefactor's" suit. Nonetheless, the case remained 
with the same court. 
  The hearing of the case was tendentious. The plaintiffs did 
not show up at all for the first two sessions, yet there were no 
consequences. On the other hand, representatives of the 
editorial office were twice fined for spurious reasons. 
Ultimately, the court itself repealed these illegal "fine 
sanctions." 
  V. Kornev submitted exhaustive materials to the court, 
indisputably demonstrating the accuracy of all the points in his 
article and the groundlessness of the suit. Before the end of 
the hearing an oblast administration representative considered 
it necessary to abandon all of their claims -- including the 
claim for 11 million rubles in damages for the "moral harm" done 
to the administration. At the same time, against all logic, the 
administration insisted on a repudiation of the article, whose 
accuracy was no longer in question. 
  The people's court has completely ended the proceedings. 
  I. Shabunin, head of the oblast administration, appealed the 
people's court ruling at the oblast court. His appeal was 
rejected.

<F P=106> [Interview with Yu.S. Matochkin, head of Russia's </F>
Kaliningrad Oblast Administration, by Lyudmila Sherova of 
POSTFACTUM; place and date not given: "Yuriy Matochkin: Our 
Oblast Has a Special Status"] 
  [Text] Kaliningrad Oblast, separated by two borders from 
the main territory of Russia, has recently moved substantially 
closer to us. Its problems have been at the center of the 
Russian authorities' attention. ROSSIYSKAYA GAZETA's 
correspondent talked of this with Yuriy Matochkin, head of 
Kaliningrad Oblast Administration. 
  [Sherova] Yuriy Semenovich, as far as is known, a treaty 
between Kaliningrad Oblast and the federal government is 
currently being prepared. Whose was the initiative, and will it 
be comparable with the treaty signed with Tatarstan? 
  [Matochkin] It is a mutual initiative. The treaty is being 
drawn up within the framework of the president's and the 
government's decision. The treaty process began to develop 
between the center and the components of the Federation after 
the adoption of the new Constitution. The first such treaty was 
signed with Tatarstan. The treaty with Kaliningrad Oblast is to 
be the second. This is connected with the fact that we have 
previously advanced proposals to grant the oblast a special 
status, taking into account its position as an enclave. 
  Naturally, we do not wish to copy the treaty with Tatarstan. 
  [Sherova] Which of the center's powers would you like to 
take over? 
  [Matochkin] Powers in respect of relations with neighboring 
states: Poland, Lithuania, Latvia, and others, i.e. with states 
through which freight for Kaliningrad Oblast passes. Not all 
the powers, of course; just sufficient to decide questions 
promptly, not through Moscow. 
  [Sherova] Do you not have this opportunity now? 
  [Matochkin] At present we have been granted such rights only 
in relations with Poland. By decision of the Russian Federation 
Government I was appointed its plenipotentiary in implementing 
the intergovernmental agreement with Poland. I act as Russia's 
representative in talks with Poland on questions of cooperation 
between Kaliningrad Oblast and Polish voivodships. 
  In addition, we would like independently to resolve 
questions 
connected with land use and ownership. We intend to include the 
following conditions in the treaty with the federal authorities: 
If the Ministry of Defense disbands some unit, the property must 
be transferred to the oblast, and if the Ministry of Defense 
decides to send in additional troops, this question must be 
agreed with the oblast authorities. 
  [Sherova] Russian territories now are frequently divided 
into subsidized and profitable territories. Which is your 
oblast? 
  [Matochkin] The oblast is said to have become a subsidized 
one, but it depends on how you calculate it. Here it is 
necessary to link the territory's significance from the 
viewpoint of its strategic position in Russia to the load that 
the oblast bears from the Ministry of Defense. For example, 
there are now 130,000 retired servicemen standing in line for 
apartments in Russia, including 17,500 in Kaliningrad Oblast. 
At the same time Kaliningrad Oblast amounts to less than 1 
percent of Russia in terms of area, population, and industrial 
potential. 
  [Sherova] To return to subsidies, does this mean that the 
taxes that are collected on the oblast's territory are 
insufficient for its needs? 
  [Matochkin] They would be sufficient for us if we did not 
transfer some of the taxes to the center. They take 35 percent 
away from us. In working on the treaty we plan to write into it 
our right not to surrender taxes to the center for five years 
but to leave them for the oblast's development. 
  We have now begun talks with the Ministry of Finance on the 
conclusion of a treaty for credit to the tune of 150 billion 
rubles. This is roughly the amount that, taking possible 
inflation into account, we will have to transfer to the center 
in 1994. In addition, we would like to keep the customs duties 
which today all go to the center. 
  [Sherova] Do you have any problems with the inviolability of 
borders? 
  [Matochkin] Our borders are violable; only the border with 
Poland is guarded according to the old Soviet system, and so it 
is reliable. There is a full system of border security 
installations there [inzhenernaya systema]. As for the border 
with Lithuania, it virtually does not exist. Today our border 
troops guard administrative points on the border between 
Kaliningrad Oblast and the Lithuanian Republic. Talks 
concerning the border are under way, but that is all. I am not 
in favor of fully equipping the border, and we do not have the 
money for this. It is necessary to set up checkpoints on the 
traditional traffic routes and conduct inspections. Endeavors 
must be made to create civilized European borders. 
  [Sherova] Yuriy Semenovich, you are now a senator. What 
interests you most of all in the Federation Council? 
  [Matochkin] For me everything connected with Kaliningrad 
Oblast is important: the budget, relations with the Ministry of 
Defense and with our neighbors. As for the Baltic countries, I 
believe that the Federation Council must adopt the text of a 
statement on the formulation of a special economic policy in 
respect of the Baltic countries, with due regard for the 
interests of Russia and Kaliningrad Oblast. Such a policy does 
not yet exist today.

  [Text] Maykop (Republic of Adygeya), 21 Apr -- From today 
there will be two state languages in the Republic of Adygeya -- 
Russian and Adygey. A law to this effect has been adopted by 
the republican parliament. While upgrading Adygey to the level 
of a state language and giving it state support, the legislative 
assembly at the same time did not downgrade Russian or discredit 
it. It did not discriminate against the Russian-speaking 
residents of the republic in any way. "Knowledge or lack of 
knowledge of a language does not provide sufficient grounds for 
any restriction of the rights of the citizens of the Republic of 
Adygeya", stipulates one of the opening articles of the law.

  [Text] Not many visitors to this museum in St. Petersburg 
have been able to see the entire exhibition. Despite the fact 
that only specialists are admitted to the exhibition halls of 
the Russian Scientific Center of Applied Chemistry, it takes a 
special permit for some doors to be opened. Old women living 
nearby claim that the atom bomb itself was built here. 
  In actual fact the State Institute of Applied Chemistry was 
and is working on other problems, also mainly of a defense 
nature. Engine fuel for space rockets from Gagarin's Vostok to 
the Buran has been developed here. 
  However, in recent years the share of orders from the 
military-industrial complex has totaled less than half of the 
Institute's orders. Now there is not enough money to implement 
ideas, equipment is not being updated, and specialists are 
leaving. Unless the situation improves, this unique scientific 
center will become a subsidiary of its own museum, and no new 
generation of would-be Russian space travelers is likely to 
blast off to remote galaxies.

  [Text] Yet another attempt is being made to reform state 
television and radio broadcasting. It is envisaged to end 
federal financing of 89 regional Russian television and radio 
companies; if local budgets are unable to support them, they 
will be auctioned off and privatized. This is a tempting 
business, and according to the plan's authors it will be of 
value to Russia. Of course, not a single reform in our country 
in the post-Soviet period has hit its mark, and has usually hit 
another target--the one it was meant to defend. Previously, 
innovators had little chance of participating in these attempts 
at reform, but now more successful people have become involved 
in this matter. Possibly they will be the first in Russia to 
promptly manage to do two things at once: break up the old and 
build the new.

<F P=106> [Boris Kolosov report: "The Volcano Has Stirred, It Has </F>
Stretched..."] 
  [Text] Petropavlovsk-Kamchatskiy -- 
Petropavlovsk-Kamchatskiy is on the alert. Having laid dormant 
for many years, the Koryak Volcano, whose white bulk is an 
integral part of the city landscape, has started to show signs 
of life.... 
  Since the beginning of March, seismological stations 
affiliated to the Institute of Volcanology have been recording 
weak but ever more frequent earth tremors at the foot of the 
mountain. This is an unusual phenomenon, because nothing like 
it has been seen in 40 years. Stanislav Balesta, doctor of 
geological and mineralogical sciences and deputy director of the 
Institute of Volcanology, explains: 
  "The fact that the cluster of earth tremors beneath the 
Koryak Volcano are occuring at a depth of between two and 15 
kilometers indicates that it is pushing magma up toward the 
surface. There are two possibilities for the further 
development of events: The volcano's internal energy may turn 
out to be insufficient, and the earth tremors will stop after a 
while; or, should there be a further strengthening of seismic 
activity, a powerful eruption will be unavoidable. It is quite 
possible that the situation will be resolved in the next few 
weeks." 
  Meanwhile, volcanologists have addressed the Kamchatka 
Oblast 
Administration in an official capacity with a warning of the 
possible danger. 
<H5>  FROM OUR FILES: </H5>
  The Koryak Volcano (3,456 meters high) is located in the 
direct vicinity of the cities of Petropavlovsk and Yelizovo. 
The 100-year silence on the part of this rocky giant may be 
proof that sufficient energy has accumulated in its bowels to 
render it capable of producing an explosive eruption. Depending 
on the direction of the explosion, it is not only the populated 
areas but also the numerous dacha sites located literally at the 
foot of the sleeping mountain which may be placed in serious 
jeopardy. 
  Around-the-clock monitoring of the status of the Koryak 
Volcano is now being carried out. Residents are advised to 
listen to local radio frequently, and as far as possible not to 
switch it off at night.

<F P=106> [Report by Aleksandr Starikevich: "Opposition in Belorussia </F>
[Belarus] Demands that Criminal Proceedings Be Instituted 
against Prime Minister"] 
  [Text] Minsk -- Belorussian [Belarusian] officials are 
continuing to keep your IZVESTIYA correspondent from performing 
his professional duty. Vasiliy Vorobyev, chief of the 
Belorussian Supreme Soviet Information Department, refused me 
the right to attend a press conference given by the 
parliamentary opposition. 
  The day before I had received an invitation from the press 
conference organizers to attend this event. However, my name 
did not appear on the list of journalists allowed entry to the 
Supreme Soviet to take part in the press conference. Mr. 
Vorobyev, who had signed this document, stated during a 
telephone conversation that he would not allow me to attend the 
meeting with representatives of the opposition. Clearly, the 
chief of the Information Department had learned how to divide 
journalists into "clean" and "unclean" back when he worked as an 
instructor of the Minsk party city committee. But people's 
deputies had a different opinion on this score: Thanks to them, 
IZVESTIYA was represented at the press conference. 
  Its main theme was the signing by Prime Minister Vyachaslaw 
Kebich of the agreement on the unification of the currency 
systems of Russia and Belorussia [Belarus]. Opposition deputies 
managed to obtain the text of the agreement only via Moscow: On 
various pretexts government officials here refused to provide 
parliamentarians with the document. It turned out that by 
signing his name to it Kebich had violated four articles of the 
new Belorussian Constitution simultaneously (or at least, that 
is what opposition members think). A group of deputies 
belonging to the Belorussian People's Front prepared an appeal 
to Mechyslaw Hryb, chairman of the Supreme Soviet, and Vasiliy 
Sholodonov, the prosecutor general, demanding that the prime 
minister be called to account under article 61 of the 
Belorussian Criminal Code (treason against the state). 
Opposition leader Zyanon Paznyak assessed this as a unique 
situation in Belorussia's recent past when a government 
surrenders its country's sovereignty in violation of the 
constitution. 
  It was not hard to predict the opposition's viewpoint on 
this 
question. At the moment it is not entirely clear how 
Belorussian Supreme Soviet will qualify the premier's actions. 
To your IZVESTIYA correspondent's question of whether the 
republic's Fundamental Law tallies with the agreement on the 
unification of currency systems, Dmitriy Bulakhov, chairman of 
the parliamentary legislation commission, replied laconically: 
"Hardly." Mr. Bulakhov refrained from further comment since he 
did not have the text of the documents signed in Moscow. 
According to him, not one member of the Supreme Soviet 
Presidium had the agreement in his hands on Friday. 
  At the press conference one of the articles of the agreement 
was cited which says that on the day that the document goes into 
force, the Central Bank of Russia will have the right and powers 
of the sole money issuing center. According to Article 145 of 
the Belorussian Constitution, the republic's National Bank has 
the exclusive right of money emission. This discrepancy 
automatically entails a violation of Article 8 of the 
Fundamental Law, which bans the conclusion of international 
treaties, which contravene the Constitution. Everyone is now 
deciding for himself just how far Kebich observed Article 1 of 
the Constitution, which says that the Republic of Belorussia 
shall defend its independence and pursue its domestic and 
foreign policy autonomously. 
  The prime minister has indirectly acknowledged his guilt in 
public. At a press conference, Kebich, brandishing a copy of 
IZVESTIYA containing Mikhail Berger's article "Belorussia Has 
Exchanged Part of Its Sovereignty for the Russian Ruble," 
rejected the accusations of bartering away independence. But at 
the same time he remarked that alterations to the Republic's 
Constitution are needed in order to legalize the Moscow accords. 
In turn, opposition deputies told journalists that they had 
asked the prime minister this question: How could he sign an 
agreement knowing that it did not correspond to the 
Constitution? To which Vyachaslaw Frantsavich gave a highly 
original reply: He told the oppositionists that he was unaware 
of the existence of Article 8 of the Fundamental Law. 
  The irony of fate is that Kebich was one of the people most 
interested in the very speedy adoption of that Constitution, 
which was successfully steered through parliament with the help 
of some dubious legal procedures. The prime minister is hardly 
threatened with sanctions from law enforcement organs that are 
under the full control of his own entourage. But there are two 
far more serious problems here: 
  First, the legislature is showing an extreme degree of 
restraint when giving political assessments of the Moscow 
accords. Mechyslaw Hryb has stated that he does not support the 
idea of making alterations to the recently adopted Constitution. 
There is nothing surprising about that IZVESTIYA has already 
written about the differences of opinion between Kebich and 
Hryb, which began immediately after the election of the last 
chairman of the Supreme Soviet. Now, when the prime minister 
has embarked upon a fairly dangerous path, the speaker has been 
given his only chance of competing with him in the presidential 
elections. Whether Hryb will make use of that opportunity will 
depend largely on the political alignment before the elections. 
  Moreover, the making alterations to the new Belorussian 
Constitution is no easy process. For that to happen the Supreme 
Soviet must twice discuss and approve the alterations over a 
period of at least three months. But in the six months before 
the deputies' powers lapse they do not have the right to revise 
the Fundamental Law. It is hard to say how much longer this 
Supreme Soviet has left since it has promised the voters early 
parliamentary elections in March 1994. But even if it lasts the 
full course (March 1995) there is only just enough time left. 
  But it has even less time left before the elections. Because 
the prime minister's promises about universal prosperity 
resulting from the unification of the currency systems have 
begun to pall a little even on his admirers. Thus on the eve of 
the extraordinary session of the Supreme Soviet, scheduled to 
begin on 27 April, ways of circumventing the constitution are 
urgently being sought. Ivan Antonovich, a former secretary of 
the Russian Communist Party Central Committee, proposed in a 
speech on Belorussian television that instead of alterations 
[izmeneniye] to the constitution an amendment [popravka] to it 
should be adopted. The aim is clear -- to simplify as much as 
possible the process of adjusting the Fundamental Law to meet 
the needs of the government. But from the legal viewpoint, 
Antonovich's idea is absurd: The Constitution allows 
alterations to be made to it but there is no mention of the word 
"amendment" at all. 
  The appearance on air of odious individuals such as Ivan 
Antonovich -- people left on the margins of Russian politics but 
who have been taken up by the Belorussian Government -- has 
become a lamentable tradition on Belorussian state television 
now. At first Antonovich was made rector of the Academy of 
Administration under the Council of Ministers, then director of 
a scientific research institute. If only matters had ended with 
Antonovich and his ilk expressing their viewpoint on this event 
or that.... But no, Russian democrats are regularly reviled on 
state television and direct insults are hurled at the Russian 
president and his team.

  [Text] The suspension of central heating in our homes has 
not yet accelerated the clearance of our debt to Russia's 
Gazprom. As we were told by the Belarusian State Company for 
Gas Transportation and Delivery Beltranshaz, over the first 
three and a half months of this year, we amassed 165 billion 
rubles [R] in debt, while our total [word indistinct] now stands 
at R331 billion. We will likely be able to service our debts 
with gas suppliers only after unification with the Russian 
monetary system. For a while, our republic receives energy 
resources in full volume, though, in line with the agreement, we 
should clear our debts by 1 June because, beginning 1 July, gas 
will be delivered to us only according to advance payments.

established on the Belarusian-Polish border in Grodno Oblast. 
The oblast executive committee has approved a list of village, 
settlement, and hamlet soviets, which crisscross the border 
zone. The Border Troops have vacated plots of land located 
within 800 meters of the state border to their engineering 
facilities, including land on which barriers and other 
facilities were previously located. 
  The oblast executive committee has also established a border 
zone ranging from between 200 and 500 meters along the 
Lithuanian border, including plots of land on which checkpoints 
have been erected. These regulations have been introduced 
according to the Belarusian Cabinet of Ministers resolution "On 
Measures for Implementing the Belarusian Republic Legislation on 
the State Border of the Republic of Belarus." Rayon executive 
committees and commanders of military units have been requested 
to explain these measures to the general population.

  [Text] On 21 April in Sevastopol negotiations began 
between government delegations of Ukraine and Russia, aimed at 
resolving the issue of dividing the Black Sea Fleet. The 
Ukrainian delegation is headed by Defense Minister Vitaliy 
Radetskyy, the Russian delegation -- by Defense Minister Pavel 
Grachev. After a face-to-face talk, the first round of 
negotiations began, in the course of which it became clear that 
Russia and Ukraine have absolutely different ideas regarding the 
number of Black Sea Fleet ships -- the figure cited by Moscow is 
substantially lower. The first attempt to coordinate the issue 
of stationing the Russian portion of ships has also failed. The 
Black Sea Fleet Press Service head pointed out that he has 
information that the Ukrainian side's proposal to deploy the two 
navies in two different Sevastopol harbors has become the 
stumbling block in the negotiations. Russia finds this option 
unacceptable. To remove the misunderstanding, expert groups have 
begun talks. They have to draft a compromising decision by 22 
April and submit it for the defense ministers' discussion. 
Crimean President Yuriy Meshkov did not participate in the 
negotiations; he was present in the square in front of the Black 
Sea Fleet headquarters, addressing the participants of a rally 
through a loudspeaker and arousing their emotions with slogans. 
  [Begin recording] [Reporter] Pavel Grachev has said that 
Russia has enough strength and means to buy the entire Black Sea 
Fleet and that he inclines toward this option. 
  [Radetskyy] Pavel Sergeyevich may say whatever he wants, 
because he is the Russian defense minister, this is his right. 
Let him speak; nobody objects. 
  [Reporter] However he said that he does not anticipate the 
negotiations to yield concrete results. Do you anticipate such 
results? 
  [Radetskyy] I anticipate concrete results. Otherwise, why 
would I fly here? 
  [Reporter] What if the Russian side continues to insist that 
Sevastopol is Russia's naval base, will we surrender it? 
  [Radetskyy] Sevastopol is a Ukrainian city and nobody is 
going to surrender it. Incidentally the Russian president 
voiced his opinion at the 15 April conference in Moscow, saying 
that Sevastopol, the political situation in Sevastopol, is an 
issue of Ukraine's domestic policy. However both Gromov and 
Grachev harmoniously say: We agree to have our base in 
Sevastopol, however Ukrainians should look for another site. 
  [Reporter] What site do they suggest? 
  [Radetskyy] I would decline to comment on this issue, 
because I do not want to create a precedent. [end recording]

coordinating matters related to the implementation of the 
Agreement on the Black Sea Fleet, signed on 15 April in Moscow 
by Boris Yeltsin and Leonid Kravchuk, are continuing. After 
private talks between Russian and Ukrainian Defense Ministers 
Pavel Grachev and Vitaliy Radetskyy, the Russian and Ukrainian 
delegations have began more general talks at the fleet's 
headquarters. 
  Vitaliy Radetskyy said to journalists after his personal 
meeting with the Russian minister that "the dialogue is 
progressing in a constructive manner." He also said that the 
Ukrainian Navy base must be stationed in Sevastopol. At the 
same time he did not rule out that Sevastopol may become the 
location for the deployment of both the main base of the Russian 
Black Sea Fleet, and the Ukrainian Navy. 
  The agreement, signed by the presidents of the two 
countries, 
mentions a separate deployment of the Black Sea Fleet and the 
Ukrainian Navy.

  [Text] Ukrainian Defense Minister Vitaliy Radetskyy has 
described the atmosphere at current Ukrainian-Russian talks on 
the future of the Black Sea Fleet as "good." 
  He told a news conference in the Crimean city of Sevastopol 
on Thursday [21 April] that there had been no serious 
disagreements during the negotiations. "There was some 
friction, but Russian Defense Minister Pavel Grachev put 
everything in order," he said. 
  Radetskyy said each side had made its own inventory of the 
fleet, which the two countries plan to divide between them. The 
inventories listed different numbers of vessels, but, if the 
difference was ironed out by Friday, a joint inventory would be 
unnecessary, he said. 
  Radetskyy said Ukraine had proposed that Russia base its 
portion of the fleet at Donuzlav, 100 km (62.5 miles) west of 
Sevastopol. 
  "The delegations had different viewpoints on that. Experts 
are now working on it. We are looking for points of contact and 
will cut that Gordian knot," he said. 
  Asked to comment on Russia's demand to base its part of the 
fleet at Sevastopol, Radetskyy said, "They cannot make any 
demands because they are on Ukrainian territory. The land, 
water and infrastructure belong to Ukraine. They can only make 
proposals, not dictate their terms." "The infrastructure is ours 
and can only be leased to Russia," he emphasized. 
  He said the two sides were looking for a solution but 
"nobody 
has yet taken any concrete decision about that or made any 
promises."

  [Text] Ukrainian Defense Minister Vitaliy Radetskyy 
believes Ukraine's navy must be based at the Crimean port of 
Sevastopol, but does not object to the city being the main base 
for the Russian Black Sea Fleet. "Crimea must not become a 
source of discord between the two fraternal nations," he said to 
INTERFAX. He said he and his Russian counterpart, Pavel 
Grachev, at a meeting they had behind closed doors in Sevastopol 
on Thursday, had discussed the life of Crimea's population. The 
40-minute meeting was followed by talks on the Black Sea Fleet 
between a Ukrainian and Russian delegations. 
  Russia's delegation was led by Grachev and included Navy 
commander-in-chief Feliks Gromov and ambassador at large Yuriy 
Dubinin. Ukraine was represented by Radetskyy and Navy 
commander-in-chief Vladimir Bezkorovaynyy. 
  "At this stage of negotiations the question of the division 
of the fleet should be solved, while the redeployment problem 
will be tackled at the second round of negotiations by the 
presidents of Ukraine and Russia," Bezkorovainy told 
Interfax-Ukraine. 
  He said that, at the present round of talks, the two 
countries were going to divide the fleet infrastructure between 
them but would not discuss the division and leasing of any naval 
bases. 
  The president of the Ukrainian autonomous republic of 
Crimea, 
Yuriy Meshkov, addressing a rally in front of Black Sea Fleet 
headquarters, protested against the deployment in Crimea of "a 
second fleet," meaning the Ukrainian Navy. "This does not meet 
our interests, because the Black Sea Fleet is able to ensure the 
security of the citizens of Crimea and protect their legitimate 
rights."

<F P=106> [Report by Nikolay Semena: "Defense Ministers Attempt to </F>
Divide Up Black Sea Fleet"] 
  [Text] Sevastopol -- A Russian-Ukrainian defense 
ministers' meeting is taking place in Sevastopol. It will 
devise a mechanism for dividing up the Black Sea Fleet in 
accordance with the presidents' 16 April Moscow decision. 
  It was learned in Sevastopol that vice admiral V. 
Bezkorovaynyy, commander of the Ukrainian Navy, was in Kiev on 
the eve of the meeting to participate in the elaboration of the 
preparatory documents. According to him, the fleet could be 
divided up in two stages. At the first stage, it would be 
decided who the fleet's personnel in service afloat belong to 
and at the second stage it would be decided to whom the 
infrastructure belongs. Ukraine, as has been said before, 
intends to share the fleet's combat might, but not the pennants 
on each auxiliary ship. 
  A fierce argument has been raging for some days now in 
Sevastopol over the future basing of the Black Sea Fleet and 
Ukrainian Navy, which could turn out to be the most difficult 
question in the course of the meeting. The presidents, as in 
known, decided that the fleets could not continue to stay in the 
same city. But who would have to leave Sevastopol? 
  The question had been submitted to a city soviet session. On 
the eve of the session Ukrainian Navy Commander in Chief V. 
Bezkorovaynyy and the Ukrainian Navy Military Council sent a 
letter to City Council Chairman V. Semenov questioning the 
advisability of conducting a session with that agenda following 
the presidents' decision. But an emergency session of the 
Sevastopol City Council, discussing the matter on 19 April, 
"deemed the presidents' decision valid" and "roundly condemned 
the practice of confrontation between the two fleets due to the 
vacillation and inconsistency of the top people in Ukraine and 
Russia in tackling the problem of the Black Sea Fleet." The 
deputies adopted a decision "suggesting to the leaders of 
Ukraine that the headquarters and other facilities of the 
Ukrainian Navy be moved from Sevastopol and stationed 
elsewhere." Moreover, the session adopted a decision to conduct 
an opinion poll in Sevastopol on the status of the city and 
approved the poll form bearing the following text: "Are you in 
favor of Sevastopol having the status of chief base of the 
Russian Federation Black Sea Fleet in accordance with the 
Ukrainian-Russian protocol of 3 September 1993? Yes or no." The 
city soviet intends to conduct the poll on 26 June, presidential 
election day in Ukraine.

  [Text] Sevastopol, 21 Apr -- Talks began in Sevastopol this 
afternoon between the Russian and Ukrainian defense ministers, 
Pavel Grachev and Vitaliy Radetskyy. They are meeting to agree 
questions connected with the implementation of the agreement on 
the Black Sea Fleet, signed in Moscow on 15 April by Boris 
Yeltsin and Leonid Kravchuk. Before the talks started, the two 
defense ministers held a private conversation. 
  During the morning, Pavel Grachev met with Black Sea 
sailors. 
He said "the Black Sea fleet was, is, and will remain our 
national pride and glory and it must be retained for Russia," 
stressing that he will do his utmost to ensure that "Sevastopol 
becomes Russia's main base on the Black Sea." Pavel Grachev 
thinks the fleet's problems must be resolved in the interests of 
Russia, Ukraine, and Crimea. "If we manage to agree to leave 85 
percent of the Black Sea Fleet to Russia, it can be regarded as 
a sensible compromise in the talks," the Russian defense 
minister stressed. 
  Crimean President Yuriy Meshkov also thinks the Black Sea 
Fleet ought to be Russian. On the eve of the talks in 
Sevastopol, in which he is not taking part, he told journalists 
he regarded the siting of the Ukrainian Navy headquarters on the 
territory of the peninsula as inadmissible and that he intends 
to ensure that the highest authorities in the Crimea give their 
consent for any redeployment of military formations. 
  The Russian side is also represented at the talks in 
Sevastopol by presidential envoy Yuriy Dubynin and Navy 
Commander in Chief Feliks Gromov.

  [Text] A high-ranking official in the Ukrainian president's 
administration reported in his interview with the agency 
INTERFAX-Ukraine that the statement by Black Sea Fleet Commander 
Vice Admiral Eduard Baltin saying that as many as 35 percent of 
the Fleet's ships had been already transferred to Ukraine is 
false. In his words, "these ships are being build at the 
Ukrainian shipyards and have nothing in common with the Black 
Sea Fleet." 
  In his interview with INTERFAX on Wednesday Vice Admiral 
Baltin declared that a total of 35 percent of the Fleet had been 
already transferred to Ukraine and "the remained 65 percent are 
to be divided." 
  The official in the presidential administration declared 
that 
"in accordance with the agreements reached in Yalta, Zavidovo, 
Massandra, and Moscow, the Black Sea Fleet ships and crafts will 
be divided on a 50-50 basis." About 20 percent of ships and 
crafts needed for Ukraine's defense will be assigned to it, he 
said. "The remaining 30 percent can be sold to any other 
country, including Russia," he pointed out.

  [Text] The talks on a gradual settlement of the Black Sea 
Fleet issue between the Russian and Ukrainian military 
delegations practically came to a halt after the first round in 
Sevastopol today. This was reported to INTERFAX by a 
participant in the talks who did not want to disclose his name. 
  He stressed that the position of the Ukrainian delegation 
which had stated its intention of setting up the Ukrainian Navy 
headquarters in Sevastopol had become a "stumbling block" at the 
talks. The Ukrainian delegation put forward a compromise 
proposal that both the Ukrainian Navy and the Russian Black Sea 
Fleet headquarters be in Sevastopol. The Black Sea Fleet 
headquarters would be in the Sevastopol Bay and the Ukrainian 
ones in the Karantinny Bay. 
  Russian Defense Minister Pavel Grachev told INTERFAX after 
the first round of talks that the parties had made known their 
positions on the separate location of the two headquarters and 
on their proposals on division of the fleet ships. 
  Grachev pointed out that the proposal that the Ukrainian 
Navy 
and the Russian Black Sea Fleet be based in Sevastopol had not 
as yet been discussed. 
  Experts participating in the negotiations emphasized that 
the 
proposals of the Ukrainian party contradicted the agreement on 
the gradual settlement of the Black Sea Fleet issues signed by 
the Russian and the Ukrainian presidents in Moscow on 15 April. 
The document states that the Ukrainian Navy and the Russian 
Black Sea Fleet will be based separately. 
  An INTERFAX correspondent learned that the Russian-Ukrainian 
talks were continuing at the level of experts in the afternoon. 
  The two full military delegations are expected to renew the 
talks on Friday morning. Russian Defense Minister Grachev and 
Ukrainian Defense Minister Vitaliy Radetskyy will hold a press 
conference on the same day. 
  INTERFAX learned from sources close to the Black Sea Fleet 
command that Ukrainian Defense Minister Radetskyy and Navy 
Commander Vladimir Beskorovainy had met before the talks in 
Sevastopol and had discussed the issue with Ukrainian President 
Leonid Kravchuk. The Ukrainian position had been worked out at 
the meeting stating that Ukraine must receive 26 warships and 
160 support vessels of the Black Sea Fleet. The total number of 
the Black Sea Fleet warships and support vessels exceeds 300. 
  However, the Ukrainian delegation did not confirm this 
information to INTERFAX.

<F P=106> [Report by ITAR-TASS correspondent Mikhail Shevtsov] </F>
  [Text] Sevastopol 21 April TASS -- The Russian-Ukrainian 
talks on the Black Sea Fleet ended in disarray in Sevastopol on 
Thursday [21 April] after the sides failed to iron out their 
disagreements. 
  The Russian delegation insists that the Russian Black Sea 
Fleet and the Ukrainian Navy should be located in different 
places. The Ukrainian side, however, believes that both can 
stay in Sevastopol, but in different harbours. 
  Russian Defence Minister Pavel Grachev who headed the 
Russian 
delegation to the talks told journalists that at the first 
plenary meeting the sides outlined their positions on the 
matter. Experts were due to resume discussions later in the 
day. The talks will continue on Friday on an enlarged basis. 
  Black Sea Fleet spokesman Andrey Grachev said the Ukrainian 
side is playing a "Massandra scenario" at the talks. Under the 
agreement signed by Russian President Boris Yeltsin and 
Ukrainian President Leonid Kravchuk in Massandra, the Crimea, in 
1993, Ukraine pledged to sell its part of the fleet to Russia in 
exchange for writing off its debt for Russian energy supplies. 
However, the deal was strongly opposed by the Ukrainian 
military. 
  Ukrainian Defence Minister Vitaliy Radetskyy's refusal to 
allow Crimean President Yuriy Meshkov and Sevastopol city 
council chairman Viktor Semenyov to join in the talks added to 
the tension. 
  Articles five and six of the law on the delineation of 
powers 
between Ukraine and the Crimea allow Crimean leaders to have 
their say in issues connected with the location of troops and 
establishment of new military units in the republic, the 
spokesman said.

  [Text] The first round of Russian-Ukrainian talks on the 
Black Sea Fleet [BSF] issue on the level of defense ministers 
was held in the fleet headquarters in Sevastopol Thursday [21 
April]. 
  The Black Sea Fleet press office told INTERFAX that the two 
sides discussed the future locations of the Russian Black Sea 
Fleet and the Ukrainian Navy, proportions for the fleet's 
division and social guarantees for the two countries' navy 
servicemen. 
  The two sides agreed that the issue should be solved in a 
civilized political way taking into account good-neighborly 
relations between Russia and Ukraine and the existing realities. 
  The two delegations recognized the fact that the Black Sea 
Fleet should not be a cause of discord between friendly states. 
  At the same time, the press office said that Ukraine's 
stance 
at the talks did not correspond to the constructive spirit which 
was characteristic of the Russian delegation's approach. 
  "An impression is being created that the representatives of 
the Ukrainian navy are trying to denounce the Moscow agreement 
of 15 April," the press office pointed out. 
  "The Ukrainian side is allowing itself dual interpretation 
of 
the Moscow agreement on separate locations for the two fleets 
and the proportions of its division. Ukraine still insists on 
placing the main bases of both fleets in Sevastopol, which runs 
counter not only to logic but also to the will of the two 
presidents and the latest decisions by the Sevastopol city 
council," said the press office. 
  "Nevertheless, the Russian delegation hopes for a triumph of 
common sense over political ambitions and is ready for further 
negotiations. Russia does not take responsibility for a 
possible disruption in the constructive dialog," the press 
office said.

  [Text] The 116th Izmail Riverine Brigade of the Black Sea 
Fleet is one of the formations, which, in keeping with the 
decree of Vitaliy Radestskyy, Ukrainian minister of defense, is 
to be reshaped and replaced under the command of that country's 
Navy. 
  Reacting to that step, the Ukrainian military commanders, 
the 
officers in the brigade, resolutely disagree with any unilateral 
actions aimed at changing the status of the formation. In a 
statement adopted at a general meeting, the officers and warrant 
officers demanded that a political decision should be adopted as 
soon as possible on the future of the Black Sea Fleet, on the 
basis of which the fate of each of them could be determined. At 
the same time they warned that, until such a decision is 
adopted, they will stop any attempts to unlawfully seize the 
ships or other facilities belonging to the brigade.

  [Text] Moscow, 22 Apr -- In connection with the reports by 
a number of agencies about the possible withdrawal of Russia's 
peacekeeping battalion in Bosnia-Herzegovina, Grigoriy Karasin, 
director of the Press and Information Department at the Russian 
Foreign Ministry, today said the following to an ITAR-TASS 
diplomatic correspondent: 
  "In the event of an escalation of tension in 
Bosnia-Herzegovina which poses a threat to UNPROFOR [UN 
Protection Force] troops, be it as a result of mass air strikes 
by NATO, or of military activities of the sides directly 
involved in the conflict, then the question could arise of 
whether it is expedient to keep peacekeeping forces in Bosnia. 
The UN secretary general's special envoy, Y. Akashi, also said 
this recently. A whole number of states with peacekeeping 
forces in the zone of conflict have said several times that if a 
real threat to peacekeepers develops, the question may arise of 
withdrawing military contingents. It goes without saying that, 
in this event, the Russian side would not sit with its arms 
folded either."

  [Text] Moscow, 22 Apr (ITAR-TASS) -- The possibility of a 
political solution in Bosnia does exist, Russian Foreign 
Minister Andrey Kozyrev declared today. Speaking to journalists 
after the talks in Moscow with his Danish counterpart, Niels 
Helveg Petersen, he called for support for the "Party of Reason" 
in Serbia and for Russia, the United States, the United Nations, 
and the EC to draw up a peace plan. 
  "We cannot condone the actions of those Bosnian Serbs who 
carry out artillery bombardments of civilian installations," 
said the head of Russian diplomacy. "It is perfectly clear that 
these people have embarked on a road that runs counter to 
Serbian interests -- those of Serbia as a whole and of the 
Bosnian Serbs -- in the most blatant manner. Russia cannot see 
that road as being anything other than barbarism and a crime. 
So what trust can there be with these people?" 
  "At the same time," the minister continued, "we think that 
there is the possibility of a political settlement. There are 
other Serbs, in Bosnia too, those whom I call `the Party of 
Reason'. There is President Milosevic in Belgrade, with whom I 
spoke for several hours on the night of 16-17 April. He has a 
very rational approach, about which he and I talked when meeting 
journalists after the conversation. 
  "The international community must now help those Serbs who 
are really concerned for the interests of Serbia and for the 
interests of the Bosnian Serbs, and put forward a peace plan. 
That, unfortunately, has not yet been done," Kozyrev emphasized. 
  He spoke in favor of a joint plan drawn up by Russia, the 
United States, the EC, and the United Nations aimed at resolving 
the Bosnian problem. That is precisely what we are seeking from 
our partners, the Russian foreign minister indicated. "While 
they are working on a war plan in NATO, we want to work on a 
peace plan with them," A.Kozyrev said. "Otherwise it may happen 
that, in a day or two's time, there will be a war plan, worked 
out in detail inside NATO, but there won't be a detailed joint 
peace plan. It seems to me that that would be a defeat for the 
international community."

  [Text] Moscow, 21 Apr -- Russian Foreign Minister Andrey 
Kozyrev today expressed the hope that neither the petty 
provocations of the Moslems, the criminal artillery shelling of 
civilian targets in Gorazde, nor the threat of the unleashing of 
an air war in Bosnia will wreck the talks in Belgrade planned 
for 22 April between the UN special envoy Yasushi Akashi and the 
Serb leaders Slobodan Milosevic and Radovan Karadzic. 
  Russia, he noted in a conversation with an ITAR-TASS 
correspondent, has done a great deal and is prepared to continue 
its efforts to establish a lasting interaction between the 
Serbian side and the UN in the hope of settling the situation 
around Gorazde and strengthening the safety zones. It is 
important to move without delay toward a comprehensive reduction 
in all hostilities in Bosnia-Herzegovina, a draft of which has 
already been prepared through the joint efforts of Vitaliy 
Churkin and Charles Redman, the co-chairmen of Russia and the 
United States. 
  I hope, the minister stressed, that the Serbian President S. 
Milosevic will this time be successful in putting into practice 
the policy that was agreed upon during the course of our 
conversation with him during the night of 16-17 April, because 
it is precisely this which meets the interests of the Serbs and 
their traditional relations with Russia.

  [Text] Russia still possesses the means to exercise 
influence in the former Yugoslavia and will go on trying to make 
the Serbs stop fire, said the Russian president's official 
spokesman. 
  Vyacheslav Kostikov told a news briefing in Moscow on 
Thursday that President Boris Yeltsin insisted that 
highest-level consultations on the Yugoslav issue between 
Russia, the United States, the European Union and the United 
Nations take no more than one month, developments in the 
embattled Balkan country being too fast. 
  Kostikov denied media reports that the latest events in 
Bosnia's Gorazde area had made Russia change its position. 
Moscow still wants a nonviolent settlement, he said. 
  Russia is taking no sides in the conflict, the spokesman 
said. Yeltsin thinks not all nonviolent means have as yet been 
tried, Kostikov said. He said he had had a meeting with Yeltsin 
before the briefing, at which the president repeated his 
objection to air strikes against Bosnian Serb forces. 
  Kostikov denied that a rift had appeared between Russia and 
America. "There are undoubtedly natural contradictions between 
states in their national interests, in economics and politics, 
but Boris Yeltsin believes the main principle underlying the 
policies of the two countries, namely their intention to develop 
cooperation and strengthen the path of democratic development 
has not been changed," he said. 
  He quoted Yeltsin as saying that attempts to "drive a wedge 
between Russia and the United States and between him and 
President Bill Clinton are doomed to failure."

  [Text] The allegations that the stand concerning the ways 
to resolve the crisis in Bosnia-Herzegovina taken by President 
Boris Yeltsin seriously differs from that of Russia's Foreign 
Ministry are contrary to reality. "They are nothing but 
conjectures," a spokesman for the ministry, Mikhail Demurin, 
said at Thursday's briefing in Moscow. 
  According to him, "when formulating Moscow's attitude to the 
ways to resolve the crisis in Bosnia, the Russian president 
takes into account the entire range of views prevailing among 
the legislative and executive authorities, including 
recommendations given by Russia's Foreign Ministry." 
  Moscow, Demurin noted, "will continue its work with the 
Bosnian Serbs." "The statement made by the special envoy of the 
Russian president, Vitaly Churkin, as to an end to all talks 
with the Serbs, was interpreted incorrectly. Churkin meant only 
the crisis in and around Gorazde. Additional contacts with 
Bosnian Serbs in regard to that problem were not required. They 
had been told everything," he said. 
  As Demurin said, "some positive shifts have emerged in 
regard 
to the possibility of defusing the situation in Bosnia." 
"According to the information arriving from Bosnia, all U.N. 
representatives have been freed, and the 18 anti-aircraft guns 
seized by the Serbs previously have been returned. The U.N. 
representatives have not yet arrived in the area of Gorazde for 
purely technical reasons," he said. 
  "The special envoy of the U.N. secretary General, Yasushi 
Akashi, is satisfied with his contacts with the leaders of 
Bosnian Serbs, who promised to halt military actions in the 
three-kilometer zone surrounding Gorazde," Demurin said. 
  With reference to the possibility of gradually lifting the 
international sanctions imposed against Belgrade, the Foreign 
Ministry spokesman stressed that "in the future this issue 
should be present in the unified stand to be taken by the world 
community." "Such stand is to be worked out yet. When lifting 
sanctions imposed on the Serbs the world community must see 
prospects for resolving the conflict," he said. 
  According to Demurin, "there are people with obviously 
militarist thinking among the Bosnian Serbs and in Belgrade." 
"The sober-minded Serbs in Bosnia and in the Republic of 
Yugoslavia should distance themselves from them. We shall 
support any efforts aimed at resolving the crisis in Bosnia 
peacefully," he concluded.

Yevgeniy Fadeyev under the "`New World Order' in Action" rubric: 
"Closing Your Eyes To Avoid Seeing the Truth: Why the Serbs 
Love the Russians and Why the Russian Foreign Ministry Does Not 
Requite"] 
  [Text] It is night. In the Balkans. Midnight and 
another, the 100th, check point along the "lifeline" from 
Belgrade to Knin, capital of Serbian Krajina, or to Pale, 
capital of the [Bosnian] Serb Republic. There are guys two 
meters tall standing there in camouflage gear, their eyes tired 
and their faces no longer wearing a smile. It is passport 
control. 
  But there are Serbian anti-vehicle obstacles. The weather is 
damp. A Serbian fighter holds out his hand for the passport. 
Light begins to penetrate the night. "Hello, brother!" say the 
border guards, old people, and even children. 
  We have been together, we Russians and Serbs, throughout 
time. You will remember "Anna Karenina." Where does Vronskiy go 
at the end of Tolstoy's novel? We have a common history, common 
memories, and even common enemies. That is the way it was. 
That is the way it is.... But how will it be in future? 
  Here is an excerpt from a recent interview in the Russian 
press by Mr. Kozyrev: 
  "Frankly, I am amazed how we suddenly fell in love with 
Yugoslavia and the Serbs, whom for over 40 years the communist 
regime simply could not abide. I can remember from my childhood 
a caricature of Tito wielding a blood-stained fascist ax. I did 
not for some reason think about the historical roots at the 
time. If we pursue a one-sided policy toward Yugoslavia, we 
take, for example, the side of Orthodoxy, what, in your opinion, 
will be the reaction of Russia? The reaction of those who are 
themselves Muslims or who are drawn toward Islam?..." 
  We arrive! The foreign minister of a still great Russia is 
absolutely ignorant of History with a capital "H," which for 
some begins with Tito but for others begins much earlier. 
  That first-rate diplomat Baron Dibich, who was sent to 
Serbia 
in the seventies of the last century on the orders of the tsar, 
wrote: 
  "The uprising of the Serbs and their struggle for 
independence is a fact of great significance to Russia. The 
well-being of these two peoples is interlinked. Russia's 
misfortune means Serbia's ruin, while Serbia's ruin is Russia's 
misfortune. Russia will never be able to count on another 
people if it leaves Serbia in the lurch." 
  However, Kozyrev, on visiting Belgrade for the first time, 
delivered speeches on indestructible historical links, but, on 
returning home, signed up to "the new political realities." 
  We supported the Muslim-Croat federation in Bosnia without 
the participation of the Serbs. While declaring our love for 
them, the Serbs, Churkin was in Washington among the leaders of 
Croatia and Bosnia. There is no need to spell out how this was 
interpreted by the Serbs. 
  Russia, having advocated sanctions against Yugoslavia, does 
nothing to get them lifted. If anyone lifts these sanctions it 
will be the United States. And then Russia will have nothing to 
do in the Balkans for 50 years or so. 
  We Russians or, more precisely, the Russian Foreign 
Ministry, 
are either unaware of what is actually happening here in the 
Balkans or are deliberately screwing up our eyes to avoid seeing 
the truth and taking the situation in hand. Judge for 
yourselves. First, Churkin states that the Russian contingent 
of Blue Berets will never enter Sarajevo. A few days later and 
our guys are there. 
  It is alleged that Washington did not notify Russia in 
advance of the bombing of Gorazde. Untrue. Our Foreign 
Ministry did know. At least Warren Christopher says so. 
  Back to Kozyrev: A few days after his amiable conversation 
in Moscow with Karadzic he reminds his counterpart from 
Sarajevo, Silajdic, that Russia is not only a Slavic country but 
one of the largest Muslim countries in the world. Such words 
were not expressed to Karadzic. 
  All the propaganda clamor about Russian diplomacy's 
successes 
is designed for naive souls. The game has long been played on 
another field. The Serbs, by the way, are not so naive. They 
are simply tactful, and the proverb "Christ is in Heaven but 
Russia is on Earth" remains in their blood. 
  It is no wonder that Karadzic should state after his visit 
to 
Moscow that "Russia is not, as is mistakenly thought in the 
world, such a defender of us as America is of the Muslims." 
  There is no provocative subtext here, merely bitter words. 
And headlines such as "Whose Side Is Russia On?" and "Is Russia 
Trading Serbian Land?" are now appearing in Belgrade newspapers. 
  As for Kozyrev's latest visit to Belgrade, there were the 
standard calls by him to Warren Christopher both before and 
after. And after his return Churkin's scandalous statement that 
it is time for Russia to...cease all discussion with the Bosnian 
Serbs. 
  Many people think that Russian diplomacy is doing quite a 
lot 
in the Balkans. At any rate, it is clear even to the 
uninitiated that it is "busy." But this "business" increasingly 
reminds one of the agitation of someone running ahead of a 
political steamroller, darting first to the left and then to the 
left to avoid being crushed. 
  In actual fact we have, to put it mildly, no diplomacy at 
all 
in the Balkans today. It is like a piece of plasticine from 
which you can fashion whatever you like. Everyone fashions 
whatever they like out of it. Everyone save us, save Russia. 
  The Serbs love us out of habit, through inertia. But for 
what do they still love us today?

<F P=106> [Sergey Moshechkov article: "Russia in Bosnia: Get Out in </F>
Order To Remain"] 
  [Text] In recent days the Western allies were unable to 
hide their "sigh of relief" when Russia left the negotiations 
with the Bosnian Serbs, saying that they do not keep their word 
and are taking a great power for a "banana republic." 
  Yet immediately after Russian Special Representative V. 
Churkin's return to Moscow, Washington and the UN mediators 
achieved certain results at the Bosnian Serbs' headquarters in 
Pale. R. Karadzic agreed to put heavy weapons around Sarajevo 
under the control of international observers, and to release 
detained servicemen from the peacekeeping contingent. Western 
news agencies are delightedly informing the world that "the 
agreements in Pale were achieved as a result of efforts by the 
international community, first and foremost the United States." 
  Have we not left the Bosnian "operating table" too soon? 
True, you have to recognize that the Serbian "patient" has 
behaved in a fairly violent manner. Just last week the Bosnian 
Serbs agreed to deal only with Russia and made generous promises 
to V. Churkin and A. Kozyrev that they would calm down in 
Gorazde, but.... As local observers report, information on 
their actions is very contradictory and their behavior very 
unpredictable. 
  Whom will Moscow believe now, which side will it take? 
Hopefully, only our own. You could spend a long time pondering 
why the Serbs set us up and who benefited from all this and why. 
At the moment one thing is clear -- by getting out of the 
Balkans Russia will definitely lose. 
  The Kremlin understands this. B. Yeltsin has proposed 
calling a summit meeting on the situation in former Yugoslavia. 
  One more thing. It would be naive to believe the claims that 
our diplomats have weak nerves. Even at a personal level. We 
should not forget that V. Churkin himself received a wonderful 
education as a young interpreter participating in negotiations 
on global international problems. It was our star diplomats who 
conducted these negotiations, people who avoid slamming doors 
and have the patience to seek compromises and take adjournments 
at the right time in order to finally achieve concrete results. 
Adjournments which, perhaps, it behooves a great country to make 
in its relations with impatient or inessential partners.

<F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS correspondent Boris Sitnikov] </F>
  [Text] United Nations April 22 TASS -- "Russia calls for a 
breakthrough towards the settlement of the bloody Bosnian 
conflict, which can be ensured only by perspective and bold 
political steps, projected into the future," Russian Permanent 
Delegate on the United Nations Yuliy Vorontsov told the U.N. 
Security Council in connection with its resolution on Gorazde, 
adopted last night. 
  "Russia is convinced," Vorontsov noted, "that there is no 
alternative to the political deblocking of the Bosnian conflict. 
In addition to urgent measures, called upon to stop the 
military escalation, we need perspective political steps, 
projected into the future, which would ensure a breakthrough 
towards the settlement of this sanguinary conflict. This is the 
purpose of Russian President Boris Yeltsin's initiative, 
envisaging a summit meeting of Russia, the United States, the 
European Union and the United Nations. It is high time for them 
to work out a joint political approach to the solution of the 
Bosnian conflict and to make it known to the conflicting sides 
so that it would be clear to them that it is necessary to reach 
an agreement and not to skip over from one crisis to another," 
the Russian delegate noted. 
  He pointed out that in the present-day conditions it was 
primarily necessary for all the sides to immediately conclude 
under the aegis of the U.N. PROFOR [UN Protection Force] an 
agreement on a ceasefire in Gorazde and on the entire territory 
of the Republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina, which should be 
scrupulously observed. "The Bosnian Serb leadership must assume 
a commitment to stop attacks and to withdraw its forces from 
Gorazde, to ensure conditions for the deployment of U.N. troops 
in that city... At the same time, all provocative actions in 
Gorazde and around it, as well as in other safety zones must be 
stopped," Vorontsov stressed. He said that the Security Council 
"cannot and shall not put up with attempts to undermine the 
political process by adventuristic and provocative actions, no 
matter who is behind them." 
  The Russian representative drew attention to the concern 
expressed in the resolution in connection with the abuse of the 
status of safety zones and pointed out that it was necessary to 
specify the concept of such areas. He expressed Russia's 
readiness to strengthen the safety zones. 
  Vorontsov stressed that the idea of lifting the embargo on 
arms deliveries to the conflict zones "runs counter to the 
efforts to achieve an early peace and is apt to add fuel to the 
blazing conflict, which is liable to spread to neighbouring 
countries".

<F P=106> [Article by Vyacheslav Yelagin, section head at the Russian </F>
Federation Ministry of Foreign Affairs Department of Information 
and the Press, and Valentin Ovsyannikov, senior counselor: 
"Back to the Cold War. Former Presidential Security Adviser Z. 
Brzezinski Calls for This"] 
  [Text] It was noted long ago that certain retired 
politicians who were once at the helm of state power find it 
difficult to renounce stereotypical thinking. They interpret 
any new trends in world affairs with a sense of nostalgia for 
the old days. It seems that precisely this applies to the 
famous American political scientist Zbigniew Brzezinski, who 
published an article in the journal FOREIGN AFFAIRS entitled 
"Premature Partnership." It is devoted to the very topical 
issue of bilateral U.S. relations with the new democratic Russia. 
  Even a reader who is inexperienced in the nuances of 
diplomacy can realize that there is today no sensible 
alternative to partnership between our two countries. 
  But these sentiments are clearly not to everyone's liking, 
on 
both sides of the Atlantic. To all appearances, Zbigniew 
Brzezinski belongs to this category. In the aforementioned 
article, he criticizes not only the very idea of a Russian-U.S. 
partnership, but also in essence the B. Clinton administration's 
foreign policy concept with regard to Russia. In his opinion, 
U.S. relations with Russia are marked by "attractive idealistic 
optimism," are based on false premises, are oriented toward 
false goals, and have potential geopolitical consequences. The 
former presidential adviser is advising Washington not to do 
business with a country in which reforms are being impeded and 
"imperial impulses" are appearing within its political circles. 
This policy, he claims, is designed to integrate the post-Soviet 
area under Moscow's full diktat in the economic and military 
spheres, with the subsequent transformation of the new formation 
into a large and powerful state with a global sphere of 
influence. 
  Z. Brzezinski's unsubstantiated accusations of "bad 
behavior" 
against Russia are no accident. They are motivated by the fact 
that Russia, in spite of the difficulties it is going through, 
does not intend to relinquish great-power status. The American 
political scientist, whose opinion is reckoned with in the 
corridors of power, is simply getting upset because Russia like 
any other country has its own geopolitical interests and zones 
of primary focus. 
  Such conclusions seem more than strange, since Russia is not 
employing the tactics of intimidation or domination in any 
region of the world, nor is it encroaching on other states' 
independence. If Brzezinski analyzed carefully the Russian 
Federation's new military doctrine, he would satisfy himself 
that it is oriented exclusively toward defensive goals. 
  You find the same with regard to Russia's peacekeeping 
efforts in the CIS "hot spots." Its mission to mediate by 
separating the warring sides is deemed to be nothing more than a 
manifestation of expansionism. Moscow's measures to strengthen 
stability in the former USSR countries, for which its economic 
assistance exceeds by many times Western aid to Russia itself, 
are dismissed out of hand. Not to mention the fact that Russian 
servicemen take on the lion's share of the difficulties there, 
come under fire, and get killed. And this is called 
"expansionism"? 
  In his essay, Z. Brzezinski did not leave out 
Russian-Ukrainian relations. His verdict here is fairly blunt: 
Moscow is, he claims, intensifying economic and military 
pressure on Kiev with a view to destabilizing the situation in 
the republic and bringing it closer to Russia. These 
conclusions are entirely contrary to common sense. It would do 
him no harm to know that the Ukrainian leaders themselves are 
coming out in favor of creating an economic area or union with 
Russia. 
  Z. Brzezinski does not hide the fact that he is an active 
supporter of NATO's expansion. In his opinion the idea of NATO 
and Russia giving security guarantees to the countries of 
Central and Eastern Europe in effect means agreeing to the 
creation of a sphere of influence for Moscow with the prospect 
of its revival as a powerful Eurasian power. He sees an 
alternative to this in admitting the "Central European 
democracies" to NATO, which will prevent a "security vacuum" 
between Russia and NATO, that is it will signal the "Brzezinski 
model of security." 
  These inflammatory arguments are borrowed from the arsenal 
of 
either the bloc or the bipolar system of security, presupposing 
the presence if not of a real enemy then of an imaginary one. 
Passing this off as an axiom of today's European policy, in the 
context of the transformations which are taking place, is 
frankly dangerous.

<F P=106> [From the "Presidential Bulletin" feature: by Nikolay </F>
Zherebtsov, Andrey Petrovskiy; edited by Vladimir Shishlin] 
  [Text] The agreement on gradual settlement of the Black Sea 
Fleet problem signed by Ukrainian and Russian presidents the 
previous Friday has become "the starting point" for the solution 
of this issue by military departments. Russian Defense Minister 
Pavel Grachev, who came to Sevastopol to negotiate with his 
Ukrainian counterpart Vitaliy Radetskyy, expressed this opinion 
to journalists on Thursday. 
  Grachev underlined: "I have come to constructively speak on 
the Black Sea Fleet problem given the will of Ukraine's and 
Russia's peoples and, of course, the fleet's mariners." Grachev 
added that Russia "has enough forces and funds to buy the entire 
Black Sea Fleet." 
  He recognized that "the positions of the Ukrainian and 
Russian delegations slightly differ," at the same time he added 
that "there are no unsolvable issues." 
  Plenipotentiary representative of the Russian president at 
the negotiations Yuriy Dubinin, who came to the Crimea together 
with Grachev, also thinks that further development of the 
agreement reached between Boris Yeltsin and Leonid Kravchuk in 
Moscow would be the major theme of these negotiations. During 
his conversation with journalists he pointed out that the 
previous agreements on the Black Sea Fleet between Moscow and 
Kiev had not been fulfilled "due to the counteraction on the 
part of the lower structures of power." 
  Addressing the Black Sea Fleet personnel in the morning, 
Grachev underlined that he would do his utmost so that 
Sevastopol would become Russia's major base on the Black Sea. 
Grachev believes that the fate of the fleet should be solved 
immediately, "we need just and precise solutions." "We must do 
everything in order to preserve the Black Sea Fleet for Russia 
as the most combat efficient and sanguineous units of the 
Russian armed forces." 
  At the same time Grachev underlined that Russia would never 
fight "with Ukraine's people. This is the major position to 
which the Russian party would adhere at the negotiations." 
  The negotiations in Sevastopol started with a private 
meeting 
between Grachev and Radetskyy. 
  A reliable source in the Black Sea Fleet headquarters 
reported to Interfax about one of the variants of the Black Sea 
Fleet division considered by Moscow -- strategic ships 
(antisubmarine crafts, cruisers) will belong to Russia and 
tactical crafts (sweepers and coast guard boats) -- to Ukraine. 
  The issue on the stationing of the fleet's Russian and 
Ukrainian units is expected to become the subject of a sharp 
discussion. 
  On the eve of the negotiations Radetskyy declared to 
journalists that "Ukraine's Navy would be deployed in Izmail, 
Ilyichevsk (near Odessa), Ochakov, Kherson, and up to Kerch." 
  In Radetskyy's words, "the presidents would be informed 
about 
the proposals worked out during this meeting with Grachev and 
would make the final decision." After that "the agreement on 
the creation of Russia's naval base on Ukraine's territory, in 
case it is reached, should be obligatory ratified by the 
Ukrainian parliament," stressed Radetskyy. IF Note: At his 
regular briefings held on Thursday the presidential press 
secretary Vyacheslav Kostikov pointed out that Boris Yeltsin 
shows "restrained and moderate optimism and hopes that Grachev 
and Radetskyy would be able to reach agreements." Kostikov 
indicated that as before Yeltsin believes that the servicemen 
should primarily remove tension and excessive emotions. 
"Yeltsin also hopes for Kravchuk's sound sense and for the fact 
that the Ukrainian leadership would mind the existing realities."

  [Text] Russian and Ukrainian military officials have held 
further behind-the-scenes talks in Sevastopol in an effort to 
overcome the dispute over the Black Sea Fleet (BSF). Defence 
ministers Pavel Grachev and Vitaliy Radetskyy met privately 
before the two delegations went into a full-scale session. 
  Experts on both sides meeting later in the day on Thursday 
had failed to reach agreement on the location of the 
headquarters of Russian and Ukrainian parts of the Fleet, one 
negotiator told INTERFAX on condition of anonymity. 
  Ukraine wants to hold back to Sevastopol as its naval 
stronghold or share it together with Moscow. 
  The source believes that a sharing out of the Fleet is the 
only issue the two sides are most likely to resolve. He said 
Kiev might settle down for 18 pct of the BSF with the remainder 
going to Russia. 
  Presidents Yeltsin and Kravchuk meeting in Moscow a week ago 
had agreed that Ukraine's share of the Fleet would run at 15-20 
pct. 
  Moscow has remitted more than 250 billion karbovantsy for 
the 
upkeep of the Fleet this week though the April bill runs at 257 
billion, member of the Russian military delegation Vasiliy 
Vorobyev told INTERFAX. He said Kiev had stopped BSF financing 
since the end of last year.

<F P=106> [Aleksandr Pilat report in the "Russia-Ukraine" column: </F>
"Pavel Grachev Will Do Everything for Sevastopol To Become 
Russia's Main Base on the Black Sea. But the First Day of 
Negotiations on the Black Sea Fleet Division Has Ended 
Inconclusively"] 
  [Excerpts] [Passage omitted] The current situation has 
been commented on by Aleksey Kalinin, former Black Sea Fleet 
commander; and Valeriy Volodin, chairman of the Coordinating 
Council of the Black Sea Fleet Officers Assemblies. The keynote 
of their statements was the impossibility of dividing the fleet. 
But if the presidents so wish, then both the main and all the 
other Black Sea Fleet bases must remain in Crimea. As for the 
Ukraine Navy base, both Kalinin and Volodin, as well as other 
Black Sea Fleet representatives, persistently urged Pavel 
Grachev not to allow its deployment in any of Crimea's populated 
areas. Kalinin proposed that the Ukraine Navy headquarters and 
its installations be located in Odessa, Nikolayev, or Ochakov, 
but "in no circumstances in Crimea." 
  Summing up the results of the meeting, Russian Federation 
Defense Minister Pavel Grachev said that he has taken note of 
everything that was said and that "we must have 80 percent of 
the fleet, and then it will be a sound fleet. We shall stick to 
our guns." [passage omitted] 
  Reliable sources say that the Ukrainian side has expressed 
its readiness to lease Sevastopol to Russia for five years, as 
its main Black Sea Fleet base, with a subsequent extension of 
the term; and to withdraw the Ukraine Navy Headquarters and 
other installations from Sevastopol. Kiev, however, insists 
that Black Sea Fleet units leave the cities of Izmail, Ochakov, 
Odessa, and Nikolayev, as well as populated areas in Crimea. 
The Russian side agrees with this in principle but is against 
redeploying its units from Feodosiya and Novoozernyy (Donuzlav). 
Ukraine proposes dividing the fleet fifty-fifty, so that 15 to 
20 percent of battleships and auxiliary vessels go to the 
Ukraine Navy while the remaining part (30 to 35 percent) Kiev 
promises to transfer to Russia on mutually beneficial terms. 
  Yesterday at 1200 talks began at the Black Sea Fleet 
Headquarters between the defense ministers of Russia, Army 
General Pavel Grachev; and of Ukraine, Army General Vitaliy 
Radetskyy. Radetskyy declared that the negotiations cannot 
proceed with the participation or even in the presence of Yuriy 
Meshkov, president of the Republic of Crimea; or Viktor Semenov, 
chairman of the Sevastopol City Council. Meshkov and Semenov 
left the room. According to information in possession of 
NEZAVISIMAYA GAZETA's correspondent, the president of the 
Crimean Republic has left for Simferopol. [passage omitted]

  [Excerpts] Now for the details we promised of the visit to 
Russia by a Turkish military delegation. Aleksandr Znamenskiy 
is at the microphone. 
  [Znamenskiy] On 20 April Turkish National Defense Minister 
Mehmet Golhan arrived in Moscow on an official visit, and 
immediately held talks with Russian Defense Minister Pavel 
Grachev. [passage omitted] 
  During the talks Army General Pavel Grachev also touched on 
the question of Russian military bases in the countries of the 
CIS. Here is what he said to his Turkish colleague. 
  [Begin Grachev recording] We are going over to the 
stationing of bases [bazovoye razmeshcheniye] of our troops on 
other states' territories. We already have accord of this kind 
from Armenia, Georgia, and Azerbaijan. In Georgia we are 
planning to set up three bases, in Armenia one base [as heard], 
and in Azerbaijan not so much a base as a military facility in 
Gaballa, which is a necessary (?post) not only for Russia but 
for all states desiring peace -- it is a ballistic missile early 
warning facility. In order for this to be formalized 
legislatively, all that is needed now is political decisions by 
the leadership of our country and a legislative base from our 
legislators. [end recording] 
  [Znamenskiy] It remains to be added that Russia's military 
presence in Commonwealth states should not be regarded as a 
display of Russia's imperial ambitions. It serves the interests 
of peace.

<F P=106> [From the "Diplomatic Panorama" feature: reports by </F>
diplomatic correspondents Igor Porshnev, Vitaliy Trubetskoy, and 
others] 
  [Text] The issues of interaction between Russia and NATO, 
in the framework of the Partnership For Peace program also, will 
be discussed during a visit to Brussels to be paid by Defence 
Minister Pavel Grachev on May 24-25. However there are no plans 
to sign the program during his visit. Interfax learned this 
from Yuriy Ushakov, the chief of the European Cooperation 
Department of Russia's Foreign Ministry. 
  According to him, the issue of Russia's joining the 
Partnership For Peace program is still being considered. "At 
the moment it's hard to say what time interdepartmental 
discussions will take. Neither has it been decided in what form 
Russia will submit its considerations concerning its joining 
NATO's Partnership For Peace program," he said. "At first we 
would like to discuss with NATO the content of our relations, 
and settle the issue of joining the Partnership program in one 
way or another only afterwards." 
  When asked whether Moscow intends to receive guarantees that 
upon signing the program Russia will not find itself in a 
position of NATO's "junior partner", Ushakov said "Yes". "We 
want to discuss the entire format of our relations with NATO in 
advance," he said. 
  As Interfax's interviewee said, Moscow is deciding "when and 
in what form it will submit to NATO its presentation document 
which concretizes the possible directions of interaction between 
Russia and NATO in the framework of the Partnership For Peace 
program." 
  When asked about NATO's reaction to the cancellation of 
Foreign Minister Andrey Kozyrev's visit to NATO's headquarters 
in Brussels planned for April 21 because of the developments in 
Bosnia, Ushakov said: "NATO's program says that a potential 
partner decides on its own when to sign the document and on what 
level. For Russia it is not important whether it will be the 
fifth, sixth, or fourteenth to join the Partnership program. 
What is important to us is to make this partnership meaningful 
in real terms."

  [Text] In accordance with the treaty on conventional 
weapons in Europe, a team of U.S., Norwegian and Danish military 
experts visited the garrisons of Russia's Northern Fleet. 
Representatives of the department for treaty implementation 
Captain Aleksandr Arbatov reports that military inspectors have 
visited the coast-guard division, located in the village of 
Lesnaya Rechka and the aviation regiment in the village of 
Katunino in the Arkhangelsk Region, where they were informed of 
the dislocation of the units and their strength and armaments. 
  This is NATO's third inspection mission to be carried out in 
the Northern Fleet since the conclusion of the treaty on 
conventional weapons in Europe and the Vienna document. After 
the treaty on the reduction of strategic offensive weapons goes 
into effect, military inspectors will visit the Northern Fleet's 
nuclear facilities in Severomorsk. The date of the visit has 
not been fixed yet.

<F P=106> [Aleksandr Shalnev report: "CIA Continues To Catch Moscow </F>
Agents"] 
  [Text] Another whole series of major scandals involving 
the exposure of Americans who had worked for the intelligence 
services of the USSR, Russia, and other countries of the former 
Soviet bloc is in prospect. This was stated by CIA Director 
James Woolsey. 
  Judging from Woolsey's statements, it is not a question of 
ordinary Americans, but of staffers at various government 
departments. Journalists are assuming that these departments 
include the State Department, Congress, the Pentagon, and the 
White House, where, according to U.S. sources, there was a 
Soviet "mole" throughout the James Carter presidency. The CIA 
director added that both retired and active government officials 
are under investigation. 
  Some people believe that most of the pointers may have come 
from Germany -- as a result of access to the archives of the 
former East German intelligence. It is not ruled out that CIA 
and FBI investigators were also able to make Ames talk -- he is 
currently doing a deal with the authorities in an attempt to 
reduce the sentence facing his wife, who is also charged with 
espionage. 
  Although, on the other hand, Ames could hardly have had 
access to information about who else among his colleagues might 
have been recruited by intelligence services behind the Iron 
Curtain. This is partly confirmed by the CIA director, who 
stated that Ames did not play a decisive role in exposing other 
spies in different government departments. 
  The most important catch so far has been an as-yet-unnamed 
staffer from the Carter White House. Under Carter U.S. 
intelligence organs -- and particularly the CIA -- were 
demoralized as a result of the decision by the then president 
and the the CIA director to considerably cut back the 
intelligence apparatus. As can be imagined, this situation 
could not fail to make it easier to recruit people from the 
intelligence organs themselves and from government structures 
directly involved in or monitoring intelligence work.

<F P=106> [Svetlana Reyter report: "CIA Director Report. Russian </F>
Crime Assumes International Scale"] 
  [Excerpts] "The increasing number of Russian criminal 
groups is becoming a global criminal problem that undermines 
President Boris Yeltsin's reform program, whereas a growth in 
the Russian drugs mafia is becoming a serious international 
threat," CIA Director James Woolsey said 20 April. [passage 
omitted] 
  Nikolay Osipov, deputy chief of the Russian Internal Affairs 
Ministry's administration for the struggle against illicit drug 
trafficking, has told your KOMMERSANT-DAILY correspondent that 
his agency does not fall under the CIA's jurisdiction, so the 
CIA chief has no right to set any requirements for it. He 
disagreed with a passage of James Woolsey's statement about the 
Russian drug mafia's assisting Colombian and Italian groups. 
When asked about the quality of his administration's work, Mr. 
Osipov declined to respond. 
  Officials at the Russian Foreign Ministry's Press and 
Information Department told your KOMMERSANT-DAILY correspondent 
that they do not see James Woolsey's report as intervention in 
Russian internal policy. In the view of department staffers, 
all that was said in the report about corruption among 
government employees was the author's insinuations, because he 
"has not caught anyone from the Russian government red-handed, 
nor does he accuse anyone specifically." 
  Yuriy Kobaladze, chief of the Russian Foreign Intelligence 
Service [FIS] press bureau, sees the CIA chief's report as very 
competent and approves of his stance on the Russian internal 
situation. In Mr. Kobaladze's opinion, the facts used in James 
Woolsey's report largely coincide with what has been reported in 
open documents drawn up by the Russian authorities, which have 
been fairly widely publicized. When asked by your correspondent 
whether the FIS considers this report as improper with regard to 
the Russian Government, Mr. Kobaladze responded that "the FIS 
also affords itself to assess actions by the U.S. Government. 
James Woolsey's statement should be seen only as an attempt to 
help the Russian Government, not to accuse it."

<F P=106> [Boris Vinogradov report: "Tajik Rubles Printed in Russia"] </F>
  [Text] The Russian Main Administration for the Production 
of State Bank Notes, Coins, and Medals [Goznak] has printed off 
330 billion rubles [R] especially for Tajikistan. In outward 
appearance these banknotes differ little from those circulating 
in Russia. National symbolic elements give them the function of 
"purely Tajik money." 
  As reported to IZVESTIYA at the Central Bank, these new 
bills 
will be issued to the client in May or June and they will become 
the basic means of payment on the republic territory. In point 
of fact we are talking about an actual national currency "in 
ruble form," but the intergovernmental agreement indicates that 
it is to play the role of a "transitional monetary unit." 
  The reference here is to an indefinite transition period 
during which Dushanbe is expected to prepare its economy and its 
approach for entry into the ruble zone. According to Viktor 
Chernomyrdin, Tajikistan could become Russia's second partner in 
the currency union after Belorussia [Belarus]. In spirit 
Dushanbe has long been ready for such a partnership. Unlike 
other CIS countries, it never left the ruble zone, nor did it 
try to introduce its own currency, even ignoring IMF 
recommendations. 
  In June 1993, when Russia introduced new money and the Asian 
CIS countries introduced their own currencies, Tajikistan became 
a dumping ground for old-style rubles which had lost their 
purchasing power. Hot money made its way into the Tajik market 
from Uzbekistan, Kazakhstan, and Kirghizia [Kyrgyzstan]. In 
January this year Dushanbe received R70 billion in new banknotes 
out of R120 billion in credits offered by Russia on the security 
of part of its gold reserves and controlling packages of shares 
in a number of industrial facilities, including the Nurek 
Hydroelectric Power Station. Some R350 billion in old money 
accumulated by Tajik branches of the Savings Bank became 
worthless. 
  The republic ended up on meager currency rations. Out of 
some 90 billion new rubles brought into circulation, a little 
over 10 percent returned to the bank. A certain amount stayed 
in the population's pockets, but the majority flowed into 
Uzbekistan. Uzbek entrepreneurs found their feet instantly, 
organizing a huge market in cheap food on the border with 
famished Tajikistan. 
  Tajik Premier Abdujalil Samadov acknowledged the 
senselessness of a ruble injection into the local economy and 
expressed support for the introduction of coupons. Now this 
role will be fulfilled by paper currency with special markings. 
These will circulate on an equal footing with Russian rubles, 
and they will be exchanged at a rate of 1:1. 
  Moscow has not recognized the old money deposited in Tajik 
enterprises' accounts, totaling around R200 billion in all, 
since 1992 and does not accept them as a means of payment. It 
emerges that, by bringing the new denominations into 
circulation, Russia is simultaneously depriving the Tajik 
economy of this sum. The fate of the "leftovers" now depends on 
whether or not Tajikistan can demonstrate the viability of the 
new ruble which has become the bulwark of the financial system, 
or whether it will meet the fate of its predecessor.

  [Text] During his telephone conversation with Latvia 
President Guntis Ulmanis Thursday, Russian President Boris 
Yeltsin confirmed that Moscow still insisted on signing the 
entire package of agreements on Russian troop withdrawal from 
Latvia. 
  The head of the Russian delegation to the talks with Latvia, 
Ambassador Sergey Zotov, told Interfax that the main 
Russian-Latvian treaty providing for the withdrawal date might 
be signed only if all the other three agreements, in the first 
place that on social guarantees for Russian military pensioners 
and their families residing in Latvia, were signed at the same 
time. 
  The Russian diplomat said that the summit could be held in 
the near future, as soon as Latvia was ready to sign all the 
four agreements at the same time. 
  The package includes the main treaty setting the withdrawal 
date as August 31, an agreement on the functioning of a radar 
station in Skrunda for another five and a half years, another 
one on social guarantees for Russian servicemen for the 
withdrawal period and the other one on social guarantees for 
Russian military pensioners. 
  The Latvian leadership declared its readiness to sign the 
first three documents, though it has been opposing the signing 
of the agreement on military pensioners.

  [Text] Moscow, April 21 (TASS) -- Russian Prime Minister 
Viktor Chernomyrdin met with visiting German Minister of 
Economics Guenter Rexrodt on Thursday to discuss prospects for 
economic cooperation between Russia and Germany. 
  In an interview with ITAR-TASS, Rexrodt said they discussed 
joint projects, all in all 15, ways to boost bilateral trade and 
increase german investments in Russia. Special attention was 
paid to the creation of a favourable climate for German 
investors. However, this will require the Russian parliament to 
adopt certain laws, he added. 
  The German minister believes that economic issues will 
feature prominently during Russian President Boris Yeltsin's 
upcoming visit to Germany scheduled for May. Some of the 
projects that were discussed today will be considered by Yeltsin 
and German Chancellor Helmut Kohl in Bonn. It is unclear as yet 
whether or not cooperation agreements will be signed during his 
visit. It is much more important that the talks in Germany 
should give a new impetus to bilateral economic relations. 
  Germany welcomes Russia's willingness to conclude an 
agreement on partnership and cooperation with the European 
Union. However, this will take some time as it is necessary to 
take into account the interests of eu countries and meet some 
conditions, including adopt certain laws in Russia, the minister 
said.

  [Text] Moscow April 24 -- The possibility of regulating 
conflicts in the Caucasus region and the Balkans is one of the 
many things which demands close cooperation between the Russian 
Federation and the Republic of Turkey, firmly declared Chairman 
of the Russian Duma Ivan Rybkin on Friday as he received 
Turkey's National Defence Minister Mehmet Gohlan. 
  According to the State Duma's press service, the speaker of 
the lower chamber of the Federal Assembly told his guest about 
the structure and work plans of the State Duma. 
  In turn, Gohlan expressed Turkey's interest in strengthening 
economic and military-technical ties between the two countries. 
The defence minister hoped to find in Moscow support and 
understanding of Turkey's efforts to solve its energy supply 
problems and desire to build heating and nuclear power plants. 
In addition, Turkey is looking to Russia for help in 
implementing a variety of projects concerning the transportation 
of energy resources from Russia to Turkey and transit through 
Turkey to other countries in the Mediterranean Sea area. 
  At the end of his meeting with the Turkish representative, 
Rybkin expressed his confidence that inter-parliamentary ties 
between the two countries would improve along with economic and 
military relations. He accepted Turkish parliamentary leader H. 
Cindoruk's invitation to visit Turkey at the head of an official 
parliamentary delegation from the Russian Federation.

<F P=106> [Pavel Felgengauer report in the "Neighbors" column: "The </F>
Push to the South Has Not Materialized. Russia's Military 
Industrial Complex Hopes To Cooperate With Turkey's] 
  [Text] On 20 April Turkish Defense Minister Mehmet Golhan 
and his Russian counterpart Pavel Grachev signed an 
intergovernment agreement On Cooperation on Military and 
Technical Matters and in the Sphere of Defense Industry. The 
document does not envision any specific transactions or 
programs. It is a framework agreement that provides legal 
underpinnings for cooperation. 
  In February, during a visit to Moscow by French Defense 
Minister Leotard, Russia signed the first such agreement with a 
NATO member country. The agreement with Turkey, however, 
according to First Deputy Defense Minister Andrey Kokoshin, is 
broader because, as follows from its title, it also provides for 
direct cooperation between the two countries' defense industries. 
  Competent sources in the Russian Federation Defense Ministry 
say that the Turks are interested in gaining access to some 
modern Russian technology in the area of creating armored 
hardware, rotary-wing aircraft, and aviation. At the same time, 
Russia would like to borrow from Turkish know-how for the 
benefit of the most backward sector of its military industrial 
complex -- the electronics industry. For the last eight to 10 
years Turkey has managed (mainly by using Western technology 
obtained within the NATO framework) to achieve fairly modern 
standards in military communication means and some other fields. 
  Combining Turkish electronic software with Russian hardware 
appears quite a promising idea. The end product may prove 
competitive, especially in "Third World" countries. 
Furthermore, Turkey has the largest army among NATO European 
member states, and therefore is itself a serious arms market. 
Ankara is ready today to buy Russian helicopters and armored 
personnel carriers because the Turkish Army is constantly 
engaged in combat operations in the east of the republic, in 
Kurdish areas, and needs a constant inflow of new equipment. 
  The Turkish defense minister said that "our good-neighborly 
relations have grown into friendship, including between armies." 
Yet not everything is that cloudless. Moscow is persistently 
urging a revision of the flank quotas (the numerical limitations 
on heavy weapons of the Russian Army and Internal Affairs 
Ministry troops in the Caucasus and in the Leningrad Military 
District), envisioned under the 1990 Paris (CFE) Treaty and the 
1992 Tashkent Treaty. The unstable situation in the Northern 
Caucasus and the Transcaucasus has compelled Moscow to reinforce 
its troop grouping in the region but Turkey, rather sharply, 
blocked all attempts to have the quotas revised. In the 
Northern Caucasus and the Transcaucasus Moscow's and Ankara's 
strategic interests have often clashed in the past two years. 
The idea of creating a chain of permanent Russian military 
bases along the former Soviet-Turkish border is not evoking any 
enthusiasm in Turkey either. 
  On 24 April, during "one to one" talks between the Turkish 
minister and General Grachev, the quota problem will apparently 
be discussed in earnest, but the possibility of a compromise 
being reached does not look too realistic so far. The flank 
quotas under the CFE Treaty are to take effect in 1995: Not 
much time is left. The good-neighborly cooperation between the 
two military industrial complexes could be scaled down having 
barely started.

<F P=106> [Report on news conference by Russian Foreign Ministry </F>
Spokesman Mikhail Demurin in Moscow on 21 April; Demurin in 
Russian with superimposed Arabic translation; Demurin remarks 
recorded] 
  [Text] Ladies and gentlemen: the official spokesman for the 
Russian Foreign Ministry, Mikhail Demurin, today held a news 
briefing for local and foreign journalists and talked about 
Yasir 'Arafat's first official visit to Moscow and said: 
  [Begin Demurin recording] In the framework of his busy 
schedule, Yasir 'Arafat met President Boris Yeltsin, Foreign 
Minister Kozyrev, Duma Speaker Rybkin, Interior Minister Yerin, 
and the Patriarch of Moscow and All Russia, Aleksiy II. During 
this visit, a Russian-Palestinian agreement of cooperation in 
the cultural and educational field was signed. A detailed 
discussion took place in Moscow on matters related to the 
development of the peace process in the Middle East, 
particularly the situation surrounding the Palestinian-Israeli 
talks. A great attention was devoted to the development of 
Russian-Palestinian relations. 
  Yasir 'Arafat expressed his deep concern over the state of 
the Palestinian-Israeli talks since this situation has prevented 
the signing of a final agreement on Palestinian autonomy in Gaza 
and Jericho. Yasir 'Arafat also expressed his deep concern over 
the increasing tension in the occupied territories where the 
wave of violence and terrorism continues unabated. The 
Palestinian leader hailed Russia's efforts in helping the 
Palestinians and the Israelis reach an agreement on the 
controversial issues on which the progress of the peace process 
depends on the whole. 
  Yasir 'Arafat also welcomed Russia's active diplomatic role 
in Middle Eastern affairs. The Russian side reiterated its firm 
intention to help the PLO and Israel reach agreements on 
Palestinian autonomy and continue efforts to ensure stability in 
the occupied territories, establish peace, and guarantee 
security in the Middle East. 
  The Russian Foreign Ministry considers Yasir 'Arafat's visit 
useful. Mikhail Demurin said at his news briefing today that 
Yasir 'Arafat's arrival in Russia was timely in view of the 
current responsible and crucial phase in the Palestinian-Israeli 
talks in particular and the peace process in the region in 
general. He added: Russia is determined to play its role with 
responsibility as one of the co-sponsors of the peace process. 
We should bear this in mind when considering the Israeli prime 
minister, Yitzhaq Rabin, is due to visit Moscow at the 
invitation of President Boris Yeltsin. [end recording] 
  Then the Foreign Ministry spokesman replied to a question 
from a Moscow reporter on the aid Russia will be offering 
towards the creation of a Palestinian national police and a 
security department and said: 
  [Begin Demurin recording] The talks between Yasir 'Arafat 
and 
Russian President Boris Yeltsin dealt with the possibility of 
offering a material contribution from Russia towards the setting 
up of structures for Palestinian autonomy, including a police 
and security force. The Russian side has agreed in principle to 
contribute by supplying the Palestinian police and security 
force with equipment. It has also been agreed that the issue 
will be examined in detail by experts as soon as possible. [end 
recording] 
  Demurin added that Yasir 'Arafat had expressed his thanks 
for 
this position on ways to resolve one of the important issues of 
Palestinian autonomy.

<F P=106> [Dmitriy Kulik and Sergey Postanogov article: "'Arafat Is </F>
Small But Smart"] 
  [Text] The visit to Moscow of Yasir 'Arafat, PLO Executive 
Committee chairman and president of the state of Palestine, has 
ended. 
  The main topic of the talks was, of course, the problem of 
the settlement in the Near East. 'Arafat emphasized that in 
spite of all the cosponsors' attempts to breath life into the 
Near East process, the peace negotiations have failed. The 
Israeli side is constantly maneuvering and trying to drag out 
the period for withdrawing its troops from the occupied 
territories, which, in his opinion, gives extremists from both 
sides opportunities to undermine the peace process for once and 
for all. If they succeed in doing this, the PLO leader stated, 
then complete anarchy and the region's Balkanization are 
inevitable. 
  On the subject of specific issues, it is necessary to point 
out that during the talks Boris Yeltsin gave instructions to 
prepare a Russian-Palestinian agreement on cultural cooperation. 
It is also not ruled out that the Russian side will assist in 
the formation and training of a police force in the future 
autonomous entity. 
  But the problem is, as we know, not only relations between 
the Palestinians and the Israelis but also the PLO's struggle 
with such extremist organizations as Hamas. In reply to our 
question about how 'Arafat intends to find a common language 
with the radicals if they continue to ignore the peace 
initiatives, he said that democracy presupposes the existence of 
various points of view. The PLO leader added that points of 
view differing from his own with regard to various problems were 
"not a weakness but a strength."

  [Text] Moscow April 21 TASS -- Great significance is being 
attached to the Panamanian Foreign Minister Jose Raul Mulino's 
forthcoming Moscow visit, which begins on April 25, in both 
Russia and that Latin American country, the Russian Foreign 
Ministry spokesman Mikhail Demurin said at a briefing today. 
  According to the Foreign Ministry spokesman, a number of 
bilateral documents are expected to be signed during Jose Raul 
Mulino's visit. They will form a legal basis for cooperation 
and give a much needed impulse to Russian-Panamanian interaction 
in different spheres, he said. 
  When ITAR-TASS asked whether recent frequent visits to 
Moscow 
by representativies of Latin American countires are coincidental 
or testify to the activization of Russia's Latin American 
foreign policy, Demurin noted that the Russian Foreign Ministry 
strives to be equally active and dynamical in all directions. 
"Being a great power, we cannot put on the brakes or step on the 
gas or dash off to one or the other region," he emphasised.

North Korean Trip. Zhirinovskiy's Falcon Did Not Singe His 
Wings In the Rays of Two Suns"] 
  [Text] The Liberal Democratic Party of Russia [LDPR], the 
Social Democratic Party, and the Workers' Party of the DPRK will 
now jointly resist "U.S. expansion." This was said at a press 
conference by LDPR deputy chief Aleksandr Vengerovskiy, who has 
just returned from the DPRK. 
  Mr. Vengerovskiy made his contribution on behalf of the LDPR 
to the all-people's rejoicing on the occasion of the 82d 
birthday of Great Leader Kim Il-song, who was handed a samovar 
with Palekh painting as a birthday present. Even the universal 
joy, however, did not help Mr. Vengerovskiy prod his North 
Korean friends into conceding whether they have a nuclear bomb 
or not. When asked bluntly, "Do you have it?," the top brass, 
making round eyes, said: "We do not know." They acknowledged, 
however, that work on delivery vehicles (missiles) is under way. 
Nor did he manage to find out the reason for the absence of the 
Beloved Leader and Great Commander -- Kim Chong-il -- from the 
festivities. In response to all his questions he was told that 
"two suns cannot shine together" or, more prosaically, "he is 
busy."

  [Text] Moscow April 22 TASS -- A high-ranking Russian 
diplomat praised Japanese Foreign Minister Tsutomu Hata, who has 
been nominated for the post of the prime minister, for promoting 
normal relations with Russia. 
  "The Russian side considers that relations with Japan are 
developing normally, at a good speed. This is a big merit of 
Deputy Prime Minister and Foreign Minister Tsutomu Hata", 
Director of the Asian Department of the Russian Foreign Ministry 
Nikolay Solovev told TASS on Friday. 
  He added that Hata had supported Russian reforms during his 
recent visit to Moscow. Our two countries, he said, should 
proceed in developing relations which will give a possibility of 
solving problems on which it is hard to reach agreements so far. 
  A new Japanese prime minister is expected to be elected by 
parliament on Monday. The ruling coalition which nominated Hata 
has a majority of 265 out of 511 seats in the House of 
Representatives.

  [Text] Kishinev [Chisinau] 21 April TASS -- Moldovan Prime 
Minister Andrei Sangheli said the Republic would settle its 
debts for the gas supplied by Russia's Gasprom gas company by 
the end of May. 
  Last week, the Russian state-run gas giant cut down 
deliveries to Moldova by one third and threatened to cut off gas 
supplies completely unless the Republic repaid its debt. 
  According to Sangheli, Moldova has already paid off part of 
its gas debt. The point at issue now is 108 billion rubles owed 
by Moldovan gas consumers, mostly from the Dniester region which 
is suffering grave economic difficulties at the moment. The 
Moldovan prime minister reported that Kishinev and Tiraspol 
experts were presently considering possibilities of finding 
money to urgently repay the republic's debt. He expressed hope 
that the issue would be solved by joint efforts and supplies of 
Russian gas would be resumed in the full volume.

  [Text] Chisinau BASAPRESS, 19/4/1994 -- The parliamentary 
commission for ensuring the performance of Ilie Ilascu's deputy 
functions, held yesterday in Tiraspol negotiations with Dniester 
leaders regarding the release of political detainees, told BASA 
Sergiu Mocanu, member of the Commission of the Christian 
Democratic Popular Front [FPCD] Alliance. Mocanu specified that 
during the meeting with Vladimir Bodnar, vice-president of the 
Supreme Soviet of the self-proclaimed Dniester republic and 
Vadim Shevtsov (Antyufeyev), president of the Tiraspol Security 
Committee, the Moldovan side suggested for discussion two 
problems: manners of discussing the problem of releasing Ilascu 
and the access of members of the commission to the detainees. 
"According to the available information, the health of our 
detainees is very bad, especially Ilascu's, one of the causes 
being the constant pressures to make them ask Smirnov for a 
pardon," mentioned Mocanu, specifying that Ilascu has not 
information sources at all. According to the quoted source, 
Bodnar refused to discuss the release of Ilascu, emphasizing 
that "he is a criminal," but Shevtsov promised to organize a 
meeting of the commission with the detainees of the Ilascu group.

  [Text] Kishinev [Chisinau] 21 April TASS -- Talks on a 
peace settlement of the Dniester conflict consequences are to 
resume in Moldova in late April, the Russian president's special 
envoy for the talks Vladlen Vasev told TASS on Thursday. 
  According to Vasev, Russia's proposals for Dniester 
settlement are based on recommendations worked out by the CSCE 
mission in Moldova and take into account the interests of both 
sides to the conflict. 
  Dniester leader Igor Smirnov said yesterday Tiraspol found 
unacceptable some aspects of the Russian proposals. The 
document was also subjected to criticism by certain Moldovan 
politicians who assessed these proposals as "pro-Tiraspol." 
  "We believe our proposals can lay down the basis for 
negotiations," Russia's envoy stressed. "However, we are not 
too self-assured and understand they may be adjusted in the 
course of discussion in order to reflect the compromises 
reached," he noted.

  [Text] We received a report today from the press service 
of the Ukrainian president and the Ukrainian Cabinet of 
Ministers. 
  Who will pay for gas? The government is referring to 
nonpayments for Russian gas used by Ukrainian enterprises. An 
agreement on settling Ukraine's gas debts in the sum of $500 
million was reached with the leadership of the Russian joint 
stock company Gasprom. [Words indistinct] over the first three 
months of the current year, our enterprises paid only 20-25 
percent of the required amount. Considering this situation, 
acting Prime Minister Yukhym Zvyahilskyy today held an extended 
meeting with leaders of certain ministries and departments, 
representatives of oblast administrations, and managers of 
production associations which amass enormous gas debts. 
Opportunities for the branches and enterprises, in particular 
the Ministry of Industry and the Ministry of [word indistinct] 
to clear their debts at the expense of their production were 
discussed. Specific measures aimed at making payments next 
month -- which must be carried out under the personal 
responsibility of enterprise managers -- were also detailed at 
this meeting. The oblast state administration was authorized to 
pressure debtor enterprises. If they fail to make these 
payments, managers of enterprises and local administrations will 
bear all responsibility for the economic and social 
(?consequences), which may follow after gas deliveries to 
enterprises, which have not cleared their gas debts, are 
suspended.

inadvisable. They believe that Leonid Kravchuk's powers should 
be prolonged until a new Ukrainian constitution is adopted. The 
immediate goal of the faction is to foster the establishment [as 
heard] of Soviets on all levels.

<F P=106> [Report by Serhiy Rakhmanin: "Esteemed Voters, Are You </F>
Ready for a Communist President?"] 
  [Excerpts] The forum of the Socialist Party of Ukraine 
[SPU], which was held on 16 April in Kiev, was supposed to be a 
conference. As it turned out, however, the delegates ended up 
turning the meeting into the fourth extraordinary congress; this 
was the only way they could nominate their candidate for 
president. From the very beginning, the candidacy of Aleksandr 
Moroz did not raise any doubts. The SPU leader is, of course, 
one of the most influential politicians in the state and the 
most authoritative person in the party. [passage omitted] 
  Active work with youth, raising the status of the SPU 
newspaper TOVARISHCH, stepping up organizational work, and 
looking for sponsors were listed among the current and most 
urgent goals of the party. In the opinion of A. Moroz, it was 
due to the lack of organizational work and finances that only a 
few SPU members became Supreme Council deputies. 
  Many of the deputies, who delivered reports at this 
congress, 
also spoke of the need to work on creating a party image, which 
remains far too vague: An ordinary person on the street is 
hardly likely to be able to intelligently answer a question 
regarding differences between the SPU and the Communist Party of 
Ukraine [KPU]. The delegates discussed the issue of holding 
theoretical conferences under the SPU umbrella, as well as the 
need to establish closer contacts with the mass media 
(especially going into the elections). An opinion was 
formulated that the Socialists should use the tactics of 
social-democrats, which could help increase their membership. 
[passage omitted] 
  KPU representatives gathered at their plenum on the same day 
in Kiev to discuss KPU participation in the presidential 
elections. According to the wish of party lawyers, the plenum 
was transformed into a conference: In the opinion of KPU 
lawyers, this made the KPU a subject of the upcoming elections. 
As one of the KPU leaders, Yriy Solomatin said, there were many 
deputies (out of some 350 deputies) who opposed party 
participation in the election campaign. According to KPU 
platform documents, the existence of presidential power in our 
state is ill-advised. After a lively discussion, a decision was 
adopted to draft a statement declaring that the KPU will 
continue to regard the presidency in our state as not compatible 
with the national mentality, however, KPU will participate in 
the elections nonetheless because the voting will take place 
irrespective of the Communists' attitude toward them. According 
to Yu. Solomatin, "given the current sociopolitical situation," 
the KPU has to participate in the election campaign. The KPU 
will use this campaign to propagate its ideas. [passage omitted] 
  As a result, the conference decided to nominate its leader, 
Petr Simonenko, as a candidate for president. Petr Simonenko, 
who already knew that the SPU congress had nominated Aleksandr 
Moroz as a candidate, proposed that his party colleagues support 
Moroz's candidacy. However, the KPU did not alter its decision.

<F P=106> [Video report by correspondent Anton Vernitskiy; from the </F>
"Novosti" newscast] 
  [Text] Today, an international conference on the problems 
of the Chernobyl nuclear electric power station began in Vienna, 
which is being held under the aegis of the IAEA [International 
Atomic Energy Agency]. Experts from that organization who made 
an inspection of that station in the Ukraine came to the 
conclusion that at the present time the state of the nuclear 
power station does not correspond to the generally accepted 
international standards. 
  [Vernitskiy] It was proposed that this conference should be 
held by IAEA General Director Hans Blix. At the beginning of 
April he visited the Chernobyl nuclear power station with a 
group of experts for the purpose of checking how safe it is. 
The conclusions of the experts were not comforting. According 
to Blix' statement, the safety norms at the station do not 
correspond to even the least stringent international standards. 
First and foremost, the state of the sarcophagus on the 
destroyed reactor of the fourth power unit gives cause for 
concern, as well as the shortage of modern equipment and spare 
parts. Besides this, the funds allocated for the elimination of 
the consequences of the radioactive contamination are constantly 
being reduced. 
  The Ukrainian authorities think that the data given in the 
IAEA representatives' report are somewhat exaggerated, although 
according to Valentin (Kupnov), who is responsible for the 
safety of the Chernobyl zone, the best solution would be the 
mothballing of the Chernobyl nuclear power station. However, 
Ukraine cannot simply close down the nuclear power station. An 
extremely acute shortage of energy resources threatens the 
Ukrainian economy with complete paralysis. 
  It is most likely that at the conference in Vienna, Ukraine 
will be offered help in financing the development of the atomic 
industry in exchange for shutting down the Chernobyl atomic 
power station.

  [Text] Speaking to journalists in Kiev on Thursday, the 
first deputy chairman of the State Nuclear Energy Committee said 
that Ukraine is ready to shut down the Chernobyl nuclear power 
station. Nur Nigmatulin went on to say that before this happened 
more power stations would have to be built in order to make up 
the deficit. 
  He said that Ukraine would have to commission a total of six 
VVER reactors at the Khmelnitsky, Rovno and Zaporozhye nuclear 
stations. This would require a total of $1.02 billion. 
  On 21 April the third reactor at Chernobyl was brought on 
line again after the 18 April incident which registered one on 
the international scale. 
  On 18 April, the safety system at the third reactor was 
activated while power was being increased after routine repairs. 
This occurred after the water level in the cooling system fell.

  [Text] Today Kazakh President Nursultan Nazarbayev received 
Max van der Stoel, high commissioner of CSCE for affairs of 
national minorities, who is currently visiting Almaty in 
connection with the seminar on human measurement. An open 
exchange of opinions on a wide range of problems of mutual 
interest took place. During the conversation Nazarbayev said 
that the Republic ascribes major importance to the activity of 
the CSCE and is ready for all-around cooperation with such a 
prestigious international forum, first of all in the 
humanitarian sphere. Nazarbayev positively assessed the growing 
attention of the heads of the Conference on Security and 
Cooperation in europe to the region of Central Asia. In his 
opinion, a CSCE seminar in Almaty very convincingly testifies to 
this fact. The seminar will undoubtedly become one more step on 
the way to developing a constructive dialogue between the 
countries of the vast European region with regard to all 
problems of security and cooperation. As far as demographic 
changes are concerned, said the president, they have occured in 
Kazakhstan during the years of Soviet power as a consequence of 
forced collectivization, industrialization, and development of 
virgin and fallow lands. From the former USSR's European region 
only, over 2 million people have moved here to Kazakhstan. But 
nobody in our country divides people into our own and strangers. 
Every Kazakhstani has equal rights and opportunities and can be 
sure of his tomorrow. 
  Van der Stoel, in his turn, highly assessed the policy 
pursued by Kazakhstan with regard to interethnic relations and 
voiced his support for the president's stance with regard to 
legal status of his citizens. At the same time the high 
commissioner expressed his wish to familiarize himself in full 
detail with the experience accumulated in the Republic as far as 
creation of the interethnic accord and stability atmosphere is 
concerned. First of all, Max van der Stoel was interested in 
the outcome of the election and correction of the violations 
noted by the CSCE observers during the election. 
  Nursultan Nazarbayev expressed his known stance on the 
matter. He said legal assessment to all deviations from the law 
will be given by the court. The court namely is working on it. 
In particular, with regard to cases noted in three 
constituencies, the court is examining the matter now. 
  Vice President Yerik Asanbayev, Deputy Prime Minister 
Tolegen 
Zhukeyev, and Foreign Minister Kanat Saudabayev also 
participated in the meeting.

  [Text] Today, a regular sitting of the Cabinet of Ministers 
took place. Heads of republican departments and oblast 
administrations, Almaty and Leninsk administration heads, and 
chairmen of the boards of leading banks were invited. At issue 
was the outcome of the Republic's social and economic 
development in the first quarter of the current year. In the 
Republic's national economy, negative trends increased in 
January-March, leading to a decrease in production and higher 
inflation. The problem of settlement of payments has become 
even more urgent. It has practically paralyzed all branches of 
the economy. As stated on 1 April, 1,084 enterprises are at a 
complete or partial standstill. As result, the gross domestic 
product in January-March decreased by 30 percent compared to the 
same months last year. The volume of production output 
decreased by 30.9 percent and that of the capital investment of 
state enterprises and organizations decreased by 68.3 percent. 
  A very serious situation is brewing in the fuel and energy 
complex. Production of electricity fell by 14 percent, coal by 
10 percent. Recovery of oil, gas, and gas condensate has also 
decreased. Oil refineries have refined 2.8 mn [million] tonnes 
of oil, which equals 64.5 percent of the total reached in the 
first quarter of last year. 
  The situation in the metallurgy complex has deteriorated. 
Decrease of light industry is ongoing. The agro-industrial 
complex is also turning a loss. Last autumn 58,000 heads of 
cattle and many horses and camels, about 1.5 mn sheep and goats 
died, although, as has been said, farm units had enough fodder. 
As a result, production of meat, milk, and eggs is lower 
compared to the first quarter of last year. 
  Preparation for the spring sowing campaign is a matter of 
special discontent. Most equipment is in poor repair. Many 
state and collective farms do not have enough good quality 
seeds. The situation with fuels and lubricants is critical. 
Not only single farm units, but also whole rayons do not have 
any fuel at all. In this connection, speakers said every 
possibilities should be found to provide all necessary things 
for farmers to carry out the sowing campaign on all planned 
areas. In the food industry the decline of production is by 33 
percent. In capital construction, at the expense of all sources 
of financing, 11 percent only of all planned facilities was 
commissioned. Residential housing construction is in dire 
straits. Despite the strict financial policy of allocating 
credits from the budget, the rate of inflation has not 
decreased. 
  Introduction of the national currency did not help curb 
inflation. Liberalization of prices for basic foodstaff of 5 
January and continuing increase of prices for spare parts, fuel, 
raw materials and equipment on the part of the CIS partners has 
significantly increased inflation. Inflation is also increased 
by the trend of producers to increase prices for their products 
as well as by inflation forecasting expectations of the 
population. The public welfare has significantly decreased. 
Last year an average monthly salary increased by a factor of 
14.2, and consumer prices increased by a factor of 23. 
Simultaneously, indexes and tariffs for paid services have 
skyrocketed. Everyday consumer services increased by a factor 
of 24 times, municipal payments, 62. Upkeep of children in 
nurseries is 31-times more expensive now than a year ago. 
Medical services cost 37-times higher. 
  First Deputy Prime Minister Akezhan Kazhegeldin, who chaired 
the sitting said: "In conformity with the government's plans 
for January-March, legal norms continue to be formed as the 
basis for the market economy. Measures envisaged by these plans 
are being implemented in general as far as the economic policy 
towards the CIS partners are concerned." Speaking about future 
prospects, the vice prime minister said that in the second 
quarter the gross domestic product is predicted to be increased 
by 6 percent and the output of the industrial production by 8 
percent. This will help to improve the situation in the social 
sphere. 
  The sitting also examined the progress of preparation for 
celebration of the 150th anniversary of Abay Kunanbayev. The 
progress is extremely unsatisfactory. In this connection a 
number of ministries, departments, and heads of oblast 
administrations were given concrete tasks to improve the 
situation.

  [Text] Dushanbe 21 April TASS -- Tajik Labor and Employment 
Minister Shukyrdzhon Zukhurov, who heads the Dushanbe 
governmental delegation to the negotiations with the Tajik 
opposition, said he was satisfied with the first round of talks. 
He stressed that, despite different approaches to several 
questions, the two sides had taken the first step towards a 
political solution to the inter-Tajik national conflict. 
  Zukhurov told a press-conference on Thursday that the 
difficult two-week negotiations had started 5 April in Moscow 
upon the initiative of the United Nations and with the 
participation of observers from several nearby republics, 
including Iran, Afghanistan and Pakistan. The two sides looked 
at three groups of questions concerning the necessity of 
bringing a halt to hostilities on the Tajik-Afghan border and 
inside Tajikistan itself. 
  A protocol on the return of refugees and a general 
communique 
on the results of the first round were signed at the round's 
finish. The head of the governmental delegation said that the 
second round had been scheduled for approximately the end of May 
and would be held in either Tehran or Islamabad.

<F P=106> [Report by ITAR-TASS correspondent Konstantin Pribytkov] </F>
  [Text] Geneva 21 April TASS -- The next round of 
Georgian-Abkhazian talks is due to be held in Moscow on 10 May. 
This was a decision passed in Geneva where the negotiating 
teams of the two conflicting sides have discussed over the 
latest three days a political status to be granted to Georgia's 
breakaway province of Abkhazia, which is the most sensitive and 
complicated problem of Abkhazian settlement. 
  During the meeting, mediated by U.N. and Russian diplomats 
and arranged in full accordance with the agreements signed in 
Moscow on 4 April, the two sides failed to come to any 
compromise. 
  "So far, we have not reached understanding", said Sokrat 
Dzhindzholia [name as received], Abkhazian prime minister and 
chief negotiator. In an interview with TASS, he suggested that 
the concluding meeting on Friday would hardly break the deadlock 
either. 
  The Georgian delegation does not pin hopes on tomorrow's 
meeting either. When asked if there were any chances of signing 
some agreement on Friday, Georgian Deputy Foreign Minister 
Mikhail Ukleba said it was hardly possible. 
  On Thursday, the mediators forwarded two draft documents to 
the negotiating teams. One of them lists "political and legal 
components of all-round settlement," the other provides for 
creation of a coordinating commission to solve political issues 
in the fields of energy supply, transport, communications and 
others. The conflicting sides are to come up with their 
preliminary remarks on the documents on Friday. However, the 
central discussion is likely to get under way in Moscow on 10 
May. 
  The main "stumbling-block" during the talks was difference 
in 
approaches by the two sides to the problem of Abkhazia's 
political status. The Georgian delegation insists that dialogue 
should proceed from the idea of Georgia's territorial integrity. 
The Abkhazian team does not agree. "We proceed from the fact 
that Abkhazia and Georgia are presently independent of each 
other," Dzhindzholia told TASS. 
  U.N. and Russian diplomats tried to span a bridge between 
these two stances by proposing a compromise wording, under which 
Abkhazia is to be "a subject vested with sovereign rights within 
a union state" built within the boundaries of the former 
Georgian Soviet Republic as of 21 December 1991. The warring 
parties are to recognize the territorial integrity of "the union 
state", the name for which will be chosen in the course of 
further negotiations. 
  As for the proposal for a coordinating commission, Russian 
and U.N. experts believe it may comprise four representatives 
from each side. It was also suggested that the commission hold 
its meeting in the Black Sea resort of Sochi, beginning from 1 
June, under the chairmanship of a U.N. envoy and with the 
participation of a Russian mediator and a CSCE observer.

<F P=106> ["Chronicler"-signed article: "For the History of the </F>
Georgian Communist Party" 
  [Excerpts] In accordance with a decree of the Republic of 
Georgia Supreme Council of 26 August 1991, the Georgian 
Communist Party was outlawed and its activities halted on an 
order from President Zviad Gamsakhurdia. In September of the 
same year, the initiative group of the communist movement began 
its activities. Organizational work was conducted in Tbilisi in 
September and October and in other towns and rayons in November 
and December. 
  At its constituent conference held in Tbilisi in February 
1992, the Georgian Workers' Socialist Party was formed on the 
basis of the Georgian Communist Party, the "Stalin" Society, and 
the Georgian Union of Communists. [passage omitted] 
  On 10 April 1994, a regular plenum of the Georgian Workers' 
Socialist Party was held. There were two questions on the 
agenda: Introducing changes to the name of the party and 
organizational [passage indistinct] 
  The plenum decreed: 
  1. To replace the word "Socialist" in the party's name by 
"Communist" and to rename the party the Georgian Communist Party. 
  2. The plenum recognized it as expedient to reduce the size 
of both the bureau and the secretariat. The bureau was reduced 
to 15 members and the secretariat to five. [passage omitted] 
  Following the April plenum, the Georgian Workers' Socialist 
Party nominated a group of comrades. They convened a 
constituent conference and announced the creation of the Union 
of Communists. They elected comrade Sergo Rigvava as the union's 
first secretary, Karlo Gardapkhadze as second secretary, and 
Mikheil Chachukashvili as secretary. The Union of Communists 
was registered in the Ministry of Justice in January 1994. 
  In January 1994, the Georgian Workers' Socialist Party held 
a 
plenum at which, at the request and on the decision of the 
absolute majority of the party's members, the name of the party 
was again changed. It was now decided to remove the word 
"Workers'" from the party's name and call it: the Georgian 
Communist Party. 
  The rules of the Georgian Communist Party were published in 
the first edition of KOMMUNISTI (19 March 1994). 
  The Georgian Communist Party has been legalized. The 
registration of the party's members and the acceptance of new 
members is currently underway. At the same time, work has begun 
on preparing the Georgian Communist Party plenum that should 
unite all parties with a socialist orientation under the banner 
of the Georgian Communist Party. 
  As promised, the KOMMUNISTI newspaper is ready to render a 
service to all parties with a socialist orientation and publish 
important information on their activities that has been approved 
by them.

  [Text] It has become known that yesterday's consultations 
in Moscow between representatives of Georgia and Russia looked 
at the composition of international peacekeeping forces in 
Georgia. In the view of one of the participants in the 
consultations, who wished to remain anonymous, the peacekeeping 
forces will be fully manned by Russian military men, but will be 
under quadripartite control of the United Nations, CSCE, 
Georgia, and Abkhazia.

counterblows on the enemy and forced it to withdraw from a 
number of heights. The fleeing enemy left behind a considerable 
amount of arms and military hardware. Our soldiers seized one 
Armenian tank, one infantry fighting vehicle, two Grad 
launchers, 11 cannons, five machine guns, seven radio sets, one 
vehicle, numerous grenade launchers, and automatic weapons.

  [Text] There were fierce clashes in the north of 
Nagorno-Karabakh's Mardakert district, to the east of the 
district center of Mardakert and near Fizuli where Azerbaijanis 
used several hundreds of troops and about fifteen tanks this 
afternoon. 
  The Nagorno-Karabakh Army press office told Interfax that 
all 
Azerbaijani attacks had been repelled. Azerbaijanis are 
suffering huge casualties both in personnel and hardware on all 
sections of the frontline. According to preliminary reports, up 
to 70 Azerbaijani troops were killed and three tanks destroyed 
Thursday alone. 
  A total of five Nagorno-Karabakh troops were killed, while 
another 14 wounded. 
  At 1700 this afternoon fighting was going on only near 
Fizuli. 
  In the meantime, the Azerbaijani Defense Ministry press 
center said heavy fighting had been going on near the villages 
of Gyullyudzha and Suma of the Agdam district since early 
morning. 
  The ministry's experts believe Armenians intend to break the 
Azerbaijani defense on the border between the Agdam and Terter 
districts of Azerbaijan. 
  According to the ministry, up to two battalions of troops 
were transferred from Armenia to the north of Nagorno-Karabakh 
every week. 
  The situation in the south west of Azerbaijan, near Fizuli, 
also remains tense, the press office said. Over the last 24 
hours, heavy fighting continued there. The press center said 
Azerbaijani units ousted Armenians from a number of 
strategically important heights and seized vast quantities of 
weapons and ammo, including a T-72 tank, an armored combat 
vehicle, two mobile launchers Grad, 11 artillery guns, five 
heavy-caliber machine-guns, seven man-pack radio sets, many 
rocket launchers, submachine-guns and an UAZ jeep.

<F P=106> [Interview with Russian Ambassador to Azerbaijan Valter </F>
Shonia by Garanfil Khalilova; place and date not given] 
  [Text] As we have already reported, a statement was adopted 
on the settlement of the Karabakh conflict at the latest meeting 
of the CIS heads of state. After that statement, Russian 
President Boris Yeltsin declared that the acceptance of any 
document, particularly with such speed, does not mean that the 
Karabakh conflict has been resolved. This is a difficult and 
complex issue. The conflict could be resolved with the active 
participation of all sides. If this happens, how is Russia 
going to carry out its mediation effort in the future? Our 
reporter Garanfil Khalilova put this question to Russian 
Ambassador to Azerbaijan Valter Shonia: 
  [Begin recording] [Shonia, in Azeri] Russia is determined to 
continue to fulfill its part of the responsibility; my country 
is ready for it. We believe that the first thing to do is to 
secure a definite cease-fire. This is our view, and we are 
working and will continue to work in this direction, no matter 
what it takes to achieve our goal. All our efforts are directed 
toward this goal. As you know, our special representative, that 
is, our president's special representative, Ambassador 
[Vladimir] Kazimirov, met with Chairman of the Minsk Group [Jan] 
Eliasson in Stockholm yesterday. They achieved a certain result; 
that is, they achieved a unanimity of views to continue with the 
two missions [CSCE and Russia] through consultations and 
cooperation. I believe that Russia will certainly continue with 
its efforts. 
  [Khalilova] [Armenian President Levon] Ter-Petrosyan stated 
during the CIS heads of state meeting that in general Armenia is 
not taking part in the war. However, Vladimir Kazimirov 
confirmed the view that Armenia is waging war with Azerbaijan. 
  [Shonia] No matter who says what, it will not change 
reality. 
The realty is already known by everybody. What I am saying is 
that mediation is a difficult job, and no one side should lose 
faith in the mediator. If such a thing happens, there cannot be 
mediation. Therefore, disregarding what others say, Russia will 
continue on the path it believes to be correct. [end recording]

<F P=106> [Report by Arif Useynov: "Privileges Granted"] </F>
  [Text] Baku -- President Geydar Aliyev has signed an edict 
on the liberalization of foreign trade on the territory of the 
Republic of Azerbaijan. 
  Henceforth, all restrictions on the export of strategic and 
nonstrategic output by all legal entities observing the law and 
customs and banking procedures are being removed. This will 
primarily make it possible to attract currency from abroad and 
speed up the formation of the republic's currency fund, so 
experts believe. 
  Obviously, this is not a question of total license, because 
a 
special commission will be strictly observing exports. 
  A reliable customs barrier has also been placed in the way 
of 
excesses: It is only possible to export output when its value 
is paid for in hard currency or the relevant banking letter of 
credit provided. The practice of holding of commodity exchanges 
is being introduced -- these will determine the value of output 
destined for export. The role of the national currency -- the 
manat -- is also being strengthened. The exchange rate of the 
manat will be established at currency auctions, which is 
reviving hopes of its convertibility. 
  At the same time as the long-awaited edict, the Azerbaijani 
Ministry of the Economy has also published forecasts for foreign 
trade activity for 1994. The commodity turnover will increase 
by almost $297 million and will constitute $727 million by the 
end of the year. Barter deals will have to be given up. Like 
in previous years, exports are mainly made up of oil and oil 
products (up to 40 percent) and raw cotton (up to 28 percent), 
as well as machine-building, metallurgical, and petrochemical 
output. Currency receipts are also expected from the export of 
caviar. 
  Iran and Turkey occupy a priority position in Azerbaijan's 
foreign economic activity. These countries also account for the 
largest volumes of food product purchases.

  [Text] Tallinn, 21 Apr, BNS -- The Estonian economy 
received in the first three months of the year 607.8 million 
kroons in foreign investments, Economics Ministry Deputy 
Chancellor Peeter Tohver told participants in a CEETEX '94 
seminar in Tallinn. 
  Tohver said there's been a conspicuous shift in the 
structure 
of investment in the first quarter. Whereas last year 61 
percent of foreign capital targeted industry, the figure for 
this year was only 23 percent. The investors displayed 
considerably more interest in the wholesale and retail trade, 
where investments jumped from last year's 35 percent to 65 
percent. The share of capital invested in the financial sphere 
fell from 11 percent in 1993 to 8 percent this year. 
  According to the Estonian Enterprise Register, Egypt rose to 
the top of the list of investors. The 273 million kroons 
invested by the Monir L Noba &amp; Abu Simbill company raises the 
share of Egyptian capital in foreign investments in Estonia to 
45 percent. 
  Tohver said this actually shows how little money has been 
invested in Estonia and how a multimillion-kroon investment in 
just one enterprise may change the correlation of forces in the 
investment market. 
  Finnish capital, invested in the first quarter in 356 
Estonian enterprises, accounted for 13 percent of total 
investments. The share of Swedish capital was the same, 13 
percent, but it was divided between 48 companies. 
  Estonian enterprises received last year a total of 671 
million kroons in foreign investments, of which Swedish capital 
formed 31 percent and Finnish capital accounted for 23 percent.

  [Text] Tallinn, 20 April -- Estonian Ministry of Foreign 
Affairs informed ETA, on Wednesday [20 April], of a decree by 
the Russian Government, that postpones enforcement of higher 
tariffs on imports to Russia, enforced first on 15 March and 
causing the Baltic states to accuse Russia of starting an 
"economic war" against them, until 1 July. 
  The Estonian Foreign Ministry said that according to the 
decree, higher tariffs that were paid already, will be paid back 
or accounted for as advance payment. 
  New tariffs were applied by the State Customs Office of the 
Russian Federation on 15 March to all states that do not have 
most favoured nations status agreements with Russia, thus 
causing the Baltic states, that do not have such an agreement, 
to pay twice as high tariffs as the rest of Europe, whereupon 
Estonian Prime Minister Mart Laar called the action "economic 
war against Baltics." Estonian Ambassador to Russia Juri Kahn 
said then that the reason for such an action was Russian 
unstable interior situation and it was aimed at protecting 
domestic markets and reducing profits made by the mediators. 
"They did not aim at putting the Baltics into a difficult 
position but as such an opportunity appeared it was taken 
advantage of," Kahn added then.

  [Text] Tallinn, 21 Apr, BNS -- Estonian Foreign Minister 
Juri Luik met today with Daniel Tarschys, the head of the 
Swedish parliament's foreign commission and the new secretary 
general of the European Union [EU], the Foreign Ministry press 
service told BNS. Tarschys is in Tallinn to attend a meeting of 
parliamentary foreign commissions of the Baltic states, the 
Visegrad states and the Nordic countries. 
  Tarschys affirmed that the European Union will in the next 
few years attach top priority to strengthening the young 
democracies of the central and east European countries. 
  The EU secretary general said expansion of the union is also 
of great importance. In this connection he voiced the opinion 
that a democratic Russia as a member of the EU would be a 
positive development and that just for this reason Russia's 
admission to the union should be conditional upon its fulfilling 
the same requirements as other states. 
  Luik and Tarschys also touched on Estonian-Russian relations 
and the problems connected with the withdrawal of Russian troops 
from Estonia.

  [Text] Tallinn, 21 Apr, BNS -- Estonian Defense Minister 
Indrek Kannik and his Ukrainian counterpart Army Gen. Vitaly 
Radetsky signed Wednesday [20 April] in Kiev an agreement on 
cooperation between the two countries' defense ministries. 
  This is a framework agreement that stipulates different 
forms 
of cooperation in defense matters, including consultations on 
the formation and financing of defense forces, and joint action 
within the NATO Partnership for Peace program and in security 
policy. 
  Kannik told reporters after signing the agreement that it 
will promote further development of Estonian-Ukrainian 
relations, which "are sound enough at present." "We have a 
number of problems in common, as we both derive from such an 
abnormal country as the Soviet Union was," Kannik declared. 
  The Ukrainian defense minister said the security of Estonia 
and Ukraine can be ensured only through joint effort. "At 
present there are no big or small, strong or weak states: all 
countries must be treated on an equal footing," Radetsky claimed. 
  The defense ministers discussed in meeting opportunities for 
exchanging information about international peacekeeping 
missions. Kannik introduced to Radetsky the Baltic states' plans 
for establishing a Baltic peacekeeping battalion. 
  The Ukrainian defense minister observed that his country 
already has experience of keeping peace, since the Ukrainian 
blue helmets have for the past two years participated in 
peacekeeping operations in the former Yugoslavia. 
  Kannik spoke about the current state of Estonian-Russian 
relations. Radetsky, on his part, acquainted the Estonian 
defense minister with the relations between Russia and Ukraine 
and the tensions stemming from the division of the former Soviet 
Black Sea fleet and the subordination of the Crimean peninsula. 
  The defense ministers' meeting touched on the reduction of 
conventional and nuclear armaments in Ukraine. Kannik voiced 
the opinion that Ukraine might consider donating or selling its 
superfluous military hardware and supplies to Estonia. "We 
decided to set up a group of experts to solve the issue, but 
made no concrete decisions as yet," Kannik told BNS. 
  The defense ministers discussed the implementation of NATO's 
Partnership for Peace program in their countries. Kannik 
affirmed that Estonia hopes the program will lead to eventual 
full membership in the NATO. The Ukrainian defense minister 
said his country's parliament has blocked Ukraine from joining 
any military bloc for the time being, including military 
organizations of the Commonwealth of Independent States. 
  Radetsky told BNS that Russian troops must withdraw from 
Estonia by the agreed-upon deadline. "Russian military bases on 
your territory are your domestic affair and you must yourself 
decide whether to let them remain or not," he stated. 
  In the Ukrainian defense minister's opinion, Estonia 
shouldn't give Russian military retirees any special status. 
"Everything must be done in conformity with the requirements set 
by international organizations," Radetsky said. 
  Kannik is scheduled to meet today with the Ukrainian Deputy 
Foreign Minister and Deputy Defense Minister Col. Gen. Ivan 
Oleinik, and several other high-ranking officers. His program 
for today also includes laying a wreath at the tomb of the 
Unknown Soldier in Kiev. 
  The Estonian defense minister will tomorrow visit the 
Ukrainian Institute of Land Forces and meet with members of the 
general staff. 
  Kannik is accompanied by the parliamentary Defense 
Commission 
Chairman Rein Helme, Estonia's charge d'affaires in Ukraine 
Andrei Birov, Defense Ministry Chancellor Tarmo Molder, and 
Defense Ministry and general staff officials. 
  The Estonian delegation returns to Tallinn 23 April.

  [Text] Moscow, 21 Apr, BNS -- The commander of the 
Estonian Defense Forces, Major General Aleksander Einseln 
discussed today in Moscow with Russian military command the 
possibility of military cooperation between the two countries. 
  "We don't think our contacts with the Russian military will 
stop with the pullout of Russian troops (from Estonia)," Einseln 
said in an interview with BNS. "We must look into the future and 
map out the course of our cooperation." 
  Einseln regards training of Estonian officers in Russia as 
one of the forms the future cooperation may take. "It would be 
useful for our officers just like training in other countries," 
he said. 
  The general didn't rule out the possibility that Estonia may 
purchase military equipment from Russia. "We are interested in 
Russian antitank and antiaircraft weapons," he said. "We 
received price lists and we shall study the offer together with 
other countries' offers." 
  Estonia is interested in buying Russian armaments, although 
it bought a large consignment of weapons from Israel and plans 
to adopt NATO standards. 
  "Estonia hasn't adopted a policy of purchasing its weapons 
from one certain country," the commander of the Estonian Defense 
Forces said. "We realize the disadvantages of having different 
types of arms in one military unit, but we still have a long way 
to go and our options are open," Einseln told BNS. 
  During his visit to Moscow that began on Wednesday [20 
April], Einseln had meetings with Colonel General Mikhail 
Kolesnikov, chief of the Russian general staff, and with several 
officers responsible for foreign relations. 
  The commander of the Estonian Defense Forces received good 
impressions during a visit on Thursday to the Kantemirov 
division stationed near Moscow. "The unit looked good," he 
commented briefly. 
  The Russian officers who met with Einseln noted that the 
talks were "surprisingly friendly." 
  "Sometimes we even forgot we faced an Estonian, not 
American, 
general," one of the participants in the meetigs told BNS. 
Einseln himself was more reserved, saying the meetings were 
"professional." 
  This was the Estonian Defense Forces commander's first visit 
to Russia. Einseln, who has spent the greater part of his life 
in the United States, assumed his present post in 1993. He 
retired from the U.S. Army in 1985 after 35 years in service. 
  Einseln leaves Moscow on Friday after a tour of the Kremlin.

  [Text] After Wednesday's extraordinary session, a complex 
situation arose in the Saeima. At today's scheduled news 
conference, Saeima Associate Chairman Aivars Berkis gave the 
following account of the session: 
  [Begin Berkis recording] I have not seen such a dramatic 
situation since the August coup of 1991 as that experienced by 
the Latvian Parliament last night. The extraordinary session 
was convened at the request of deputies of the radical right, 
For the Fatherland and Freedom and the Latvian National 
Independence Movement [LNNK], in order to block the signing of 
any of the agreements initialled on 15 March with Russia, and to 
form a new delegation for the talks. Only 26 deputies, however, 
voted for this bill, for the individual paragraphs; there was no 
(?vote) for it as a whole. 
  Thereafter, with the deputies of the Fatherland and Freedom 
and the LNNK, together with Equal Rights deputies and Popular 
Harmony Party deputies not taking part in the vote, the version 
favored by the state president and supported by the Latvian Way 
and Peasants' Union factions -- wanting the signing of the first 
three draft agreements and favoring clarification of the 
agreement on retired military personnel and its corresponding 
with the norms of international law -- was also rejected. 
  Therefore, on an issue of great importance to Latvia, its 
security and future, the Saeima was at the same time both 
against signing the agreements and against not signing the 
agreements. In such a situation the state president was 
entitled to propose the dissolution of the Saeima, which would 
mean a referendum, new elections, and a whole string of 
unforeseeable complications. Or else the simpler way out -- to 
raise the question of confidence in the government on its 
handling of foreign and security policy. Prime Minister Valdis 
Birkavs proposed such a vote of confidence. In my opinion this 
was an (?impetuous) decision, because most of the deputies in 
the governing coalition were not at the plenary session. 
However, the result was positive: Of the 87 present, 51 
supported the government's course. 
  I believe that if all those deputies loyal to the government 
had been present, then (?69) of the votes would have been in the 
government's favor (?against 30), which would be more than in 
the autumn, when the Saeima voted for the then newly formed 
government of Valdis Birkavs. In my opinion this vote is 
sufficient proof that the state president, together with the 
prime minister, can continue its dialogue with Russia. [end 
recording] 
  So, today, in the Saeima, the government received a vote of 
confidence. [passage omitted]

  [Text] From 4 April this year, the U.S. State Department 
will remove Latvia from the list of countries to which it is 
forbidden to export arms. The Latvian Foreign Ministry reports 
that the United States has officially announced that Latvia, 
Albania, Bulgaria, Cambodia, Estonia, and Romania are no longer 
to be included in the list of countries to which, observing the 
rules of international arms trade, the U.S. forbids the export 
of arms and defense equipment. This means that in future the 
United States will not require a licence for the export or 
import of defense material and defence services to Latvia.

  [Text] Riga, Apr 21, BNS -- NATO Allied Forces in Europe 
North Military Group's Commander General Garry Johnson completed 
Thursday [21 April] his visit in Latvia. During the visit, he 
met with Latvian Defense Forces Commander Dainis Turlais, 
Defense Minister Valdis Pavlovskis and different ministry's 
officials, and Foreign Ministry's Parliamentarian Secretary 
Martins Virsis, and discussed Latvia's cooperation with NATO. 
  Before leaving, Johnson said at a press conference that the 
visit was done in the framework of NATO program for cooperation 
with other states. 
  Johnson noted that Latvian officers have taken part in 
several NATO training programs, and NATO expert groups help 
Latvian defense forces' representatives with advice. Johnson 
praised Turlais's contribution to the forming of Latvian defense 
forces. He noted that Latvian soldiers, sent to take part in 
NATO training programs, were physically well prepared. 
  Answering journalists' questions, Johnson said NATO was 
ready 
to cooperate both with Latvia and Russia, and he expressed hope 
that Russian army would be fully withdrawn from Latvia till the 
complete drafting of the cooperation program. He said Russian 
army's presence in Latvian Skrunda will not influence 
cooperation between Latvia and NATO, said Johnson. 
  Johnson also said that no priorities in cooperation with 
NATO 
would be given to Russia, though Russia could involve large 
forces in NATO's activities.

  [Text] Vilnius, Apr 21, BNS -- The Chief Election 
Commission [CEC] of Lithuania on Wednesday [20 April] circulated 
a statement denying accusations that its decisions are 
politically biased. 
  The statement came as a reaction to allegations that the CEC 
unlawfully refused to register Conservative Party candidate 
Liudvikas Sabutis for a by-election in the Kaisiadorys district. 
The conservatives filed an appeal against the decision to the 
Supreme Court. 
  Vytautas Landsbergis, leader of the Lithuanian parliament's 
opposition, said CEC is manipulated by the ruling Lithuanian 
Democratic Labor Party. 
  The CEC said Sabutis was denied registration because the 
Conservative Party did not register itself specially for 
elections, although the conservatives are an officially 
registered political party. The Conservative Party says the 
commission misinterpreted the law on election, which does not 
require special registration for elections. 
  In its statement, the CEC said Landsbergis' allegations are 
"groundless and insulting." The commission said it "always 
observed and will observe the Constitution and Lithuanian laws." 
  A by-election election in the Kaisiadorys district to fill a 
vacancy left by President Algirdas Brazauskas is scheduled for 
May 15. Bakery worker Albinas Visockas, leader of the newly 
founded extreme-left Socialist Party, is the only candidate 
registered for the election. Visockas nominated himself as an 
independent candidate. 
  Justinas Karosas, chairman of the ruling LDLP faction, 
categorically denied accusations of manipulating the CEC. 
Karosas told reporters Wednesday that the party in power will 
neither support nor hinder Visockas's participation in the 
by-election.

  [Text] There is every indication that events in and around 
Gorazde have entered a decisive stage. As a senior Russian 
Foreign Ministry official has reported to Interfax with 
reference to information from that city, hand-to-hand combat is 
underway there. 
  For this reason, NATO may decide already on Friday to back 
the UN Secretary General's request for massive air strikes on 
the Bosnian Serbs. However, such a decision could only escalate 
the conflict and give the Serbs freedom of action not only in 
Gorazde but elsewhere in Bosnia, the diplomat said. 
  In his words, NATO's massive air strikes might "seriously 
complicate" the position of peacekeepers in Bosnia and 
necessitate an evacuation of the Sarajevo-based Russian 
peace-keeping battalion. 
  He declined to say how precisely Russia would respond to 
massive air-strikes, if NATO mandated them. "There are a few 
options. Let us not spur on events," he noted. 
  He said that "this time Moscow cannot complain that it has 
not been consulted." Contacts with NATO and with Americans are 
underway at various levels. It is not ruled out that they will 
ultimately lead to a summit with Russia, US, EC, and UN to take 
part, on which Moscow has been insisting. It is hardly likely 
that efforts to prepare such a summit in just one month's time 
will succeed. As for a meeting at the foreign ministers level, 
it is not only feasible but necessary, the diplomat said.

  [Text] "In case violence escalates on the territory of 
Bosnia-Herzegovina either because of massive NATO air strikes or 
combat activities of the sides directly involved in the conflict 
and (in case of) a threat to the personnel of UNPROFOR [UN 
Protection Force], it cannot be ruled out that the question of 
the necessity of further stay of peace-keeping forces in Bosnia 
will arise", Karasin said adding that Yasushi Akashi, the envoy 
of the UN secretary general, had recently mentioned the 
possibility. 
  He stressed that a number of states whose peace-keepers are 
in the zone of conflict had several times noted that in case of 
a real threat to the personnel of their peace-keeping forces the 
question may arise about withdrawing them. 
  Russia will follow suit in this case, according to Karasin.

  [Text] Moldovan President Mircea Snegur stated in an 
exclusive interview with Interfax that Moldova's membership of 
the CIS and the economic union was a manifestation of good sense 
and not a move towards the restoration of the USSR, as the 
opposition had claimed. 
  "We have gone through different stages of settling economic 
problems, we have applied different methods and we have come to 
the conclusion that we should join the CIS. Today, I want to 
confirm that together with this we will continue the reforms and 
the policy of integration with the West," Snegur stressed. 
  Snegur wanted the CIS economic space to become "transparent" 
so that all customs barriers be lifted and a single commonwealth 
be established to ensure movement of capital in all directions. 
  "Our policy provides for economic integration with the East 
and the West and for neutrality," Snegur pointed out. 
  Speaking on settlement in Transdniestria, Snegur emphasized 
that good opportunities had recently appeared not only for a 
dialogue with Transdniestria but also for settlement of all 
problems of this region. Snegur intends to take active part in 
consideration of the issues concerning the status of the left 
bank of the Dniester and to make his participation considered 
and gradual. 
  "This means to look for mutually beneficial compromises. We 
have already gone through the phase of wanting to solve problems 
from a position of stubbornness. To demonstrate our seriousness 
we agreed that Transdniestrian representatives would participate 
in Russian forums with the Moldovan delegation at the CIS summit 
in Moscow," Snegur said. He also hoped that the Moldovan 
parliament would back the desire of Gagauzia to be an autonomy, 
however, "within the composition of Moldova." 
  On the decision of the Russian Gazprom to reduce gas 
delivery 
to Moldova by one third, Snegur said the problem would be solved 
positively for Moldova in the near future since Moldova had 
prepared some production to be sent to Russia in order to pay 
for the gas delivery.

Nikolay Zherebtsov, Andrey Petrovskiy, edited by Vladimir 
Shishlin] 
  [Text] President Askar Akayev has decreed the removal of 
Finance Minister Kamchibek Shakirov for abuse of his official 
status and for issuing a loan from the state budget to a private 
firm. 
  The head of the president's press service Azim Ibraimov told 
INTERFAX that the finance minister's resignation was the first 
instance of an uncompromising decision with regard to a cabinet 
member. In his view, this was an example of the government's 
resolution to tighten state discipline over fiscal matters in 
use against officials who, regardless of their rank, had raised 
their own level of responsibility beyond that permissible by law. 
  Ibraimov pointed out that when the new premier Apas 
Dzhumagulov came to power, "the process of purging the state 
personnel system began in earnest." 
  He also said that K. Shakirov used his authority among 
government members "as a sufficiently well-versed and competent 
professional financier, who knew his business." However, 
"weakness of character led him to violate procedure and abuse 
his authorities and, succumbing to family loyalties, the finance 
minister issued a loan to his own son-in-law," Ibraimov said.

  [Text] Ashkhabad, 21 April (TASS) -- The first round of 
Turkmen-Chinese summit talks has revealed the identity of their 
stands on the main aspects of cooperation. This was stressed at 
a briefing for journalists, organised by the Chinese side. It 
was stated that Li Peng and Saparmurat Niyazov had expressed 
satisfaction over the level of the development of bilateral 
relations after the establishment of diplomatic contacts in 
1992. Both leaders pointed to mutual understanding and 
confidence, which are typical of the relations between their 
countries. They stressed that there existed a potential for 
their further deepening. 
  It was stated at the briefing that the talks had revealed 
the 
main spheres of possible economic cooperation, of which the 
transportation of Turkmen gas to China is the most important one. 
  Participants in the talks, held in Ashkhabad, pointed out 
that trade turnover between China and Turkenistan is not too 
great so far, but there are chances to make it more effective. 
The Chinese side expressed a lively interest in purchasing 
Turkmen cotton. 
  Four agreements are expected to be signed at the talks, 
which 
will be continued on Friday. They will become more specific 
after a meeting of Chiness business people with heads of Turkmen 
ministries and institutions, scheduled for Friday.

  [Text] After 10 days of successful counter-offensive, the 
Karabakh Army has reached the northern borders of the Mardakert 
area in Karabakh. It regained the Armenian communities 
Tonashen, Dastakert, Levonarkh, Madagis, Verin, Chailu, and

  [Text] Tallinn, 21 Apr, BNS -- Estonian Prime Minister

Wednesday [20 April] in a meeting with World Bank President 
Lewis Preston. 
  Laar thanked Preston for the tremendous amount of work the 
World Bank specialists have put into developing Estonian 
economy, as well as for past and future financial support. 
  The meeting discussed two concrete loan projects, one of 
which targets the implementation of reforms in Estonian 
agriculture and food industry as well as a land reform, and the 
other would open for Estonia a credit line with the World Bank 
for long-term loans. 
  Laar met yesterday also with a number of influential 
American 
politicians. He had a longer talk with Representative Richard 
J. Drubin. Durbin showed particular interest in Estonia's

<F P=106> ["News Release"] </F>
  [Text] Tallinn, 20 April -- Annual meeting of the European 
Bank for Reconstruction and Development (EBRD), that ended in 
St. Petersburg, Tuesday [18 April] night, was very successful 
for Estonia, with interest towards our economy being 
considerably great, Estonian Minister of Finance Heiki Kranich 
told ETA. 
  He told a press conference on Wednesday that the aim of the 
Estonian delegation at the meeting with the President of the 
bank Jacques de Larosiere was to point at the need for the bank 
to be more flexible and to take more risks. What Estonia 
proposed was that a risk capital fund could be created with the 
resources of EBRD, out of which direct equity investments could 
be made, so that the bank would be a shareholder in Estonian 
enterprises, Kranich said. He said that in Moscow also 
foundation of a joint Baltic risk capital fund was discussed. 
  According to the statutes of EBRD 60 per cent of credits are 
channeled into private sector and 40 per cent into public 
sector. This distribution is a problem in the former Soviet 
republics where the amount of private sector firms that own 
credit guaranties is still small. 
  An important event for Estonia was signing the agreement 
between Estonia, EBRD and Japanese Export-Import Bank on a $30 
million credit line. Kranich said that Estonia was the first 
East European state that started a similar agreement, being only 
later joined by Latvia and Lithuania. 
  Kranich said that de Larosiere expressed great interest 
towards Estonia and readiness to take Estonian proposals into 
consideration and that he hopes that the results will be felt in 
the relations of Estonia and EBRD soon. 
  Kranich added that Baltic finance ministers who met in 
St.Petersburg, are to meet again in June this year to specify 
principles of cooperation and discuss possible projects. 
  "Invest and experiment in Estonia, for we have been 
successful and we are relatively small. You have all 
possibilities of success, which will do good also to the image 
of the bank," was Estonia's message to EBRD. "Estonia is a 
strong sign for other states as well and we have all 
prerequisites in order to take advantage of it," Kranich said.

  [Text] If the opposition forces refuse to sign the treaty 
on Civil Accord, this will be a "political victory" for the 
democrats since society will see who is seeking accord and who 
confrontation. This statement was made by deputy chairman of the 
Russia's Choice faction, Boris Zolotukhin, at the faction's 
meeting. Russia's Choice leader Yegor Gaydar stated on behalf 
of the faction in the State Duma today that the faction was 
prepared to sign the document. 
  Russia's Choice member Yuliy Rybakov suggested that the 
State 
Duma would not give State Duma Speaker Ivan Rybkin a mandate for 
signing the agreement proposed by the president. Liberal 
Democratic Party (LDP) leader, Vladimir Zhirinovskiy, has 
insisted that the State Duma take a vote on whether Rybkin be 
granted the right to sign the document on its behalf. 
Zolotukhin was certain that if the State Duma did not give the 
appropriate authority to Rybkin this would expose the Duma's 
majority as a force not seeking stabilization of the situation 
in society. 
  Deputy Bella Denisenko said the draft agreement provided for 
nothing except the idea of accord itself and the faction would 
have to sign just the title since there were no real moves 
towards accord mentioned in the document. She said that the 
document had already worsened the situation and brought 
different political forces into confrontation. 
  Former social security minister, Ella Pamfilova, recommended 
that the faction seriously speak to the president in the 
presence of all members of Russia's Choice. She said it was not 
clear what the president sought and in what the faction should 
back him and whether Boris Yeltsin needed this support.

<F P=106> ["Own Information" report: "Friends of `Accord'"] </F>
  [Text] The publication of an appeal by the initiators of 
the "Accord for Russia" movement has elicited a wide response in 
practically all parts of the Russian Federation. This is borne 
out by the mail addressed to Valeriy Zorkin, Gennadiy Zyuganov, 
Mikhail Lapshin, Aleksandr Rutskoy, Sergey Glazyev, and the 
other cofounders. They receive more than 500 individual and 
collective letters every day. 
  The call to unite patriotic forces has already been 
supported 
in official statements by more than 6,000 labor collectives, 
villagers, students, and even groups of senior pupils. They are 
all prepared actively to promote the movement's noble aims and 
to set up organizing subdivisions in the provinces. The ideas 
of accord and of strengthening the Russian State are becoming a 
consolidating factor for people of not only different ages but 
also professions and political orientations, even including 
voters who recently supported "Russia's Choice." 
  The largest number of proposals to set up "Accord for 
Russia" 
organizing groups has come from Altay and Krasnoyarsk Krays and 
Volgograd, Leningrad, Moscow, Nizhniy Novgorod, Novosibirsk, 
Samara, Saratov, Smolensk, and Chelyabinsk Oblasts. The 
movement's ideas have also been supported in the Russian 
Federation republics. The influential public organization 
"Citizens of Mordovia for Social Justice, Legality, and Economic 
Stability" plans to examine the question of joining the movement 
at its next congress.

had a meeting with leaders of component Russian republics. The 
participants at the meeting expressed support for the prompt 
signing and conscientious implementation of the agreement on 
civic accord, and they adopted a corresponding statement to this 
effect. They noted the importance of constructive cooperation 
between all political forces and all federation subjects to

  The president noted that the present Constitution creates a 
firm basis for the implementation of all natural rights and 
interests of republics without detriment to the unity and 
prosperity of our common fatherland, the Russian Federation. 
Also discussed were the basic principles of the federal 
center's regional strategy and problems of regional policy and 
interregional integration. 
  The participants at the meeting exchanged views on a number 
of economic issues. The president devoted special attention to 
the problem of mutual relations between federal and regional 
bodies of authority in the budgetary sphere, and specified the 
tasks republican leaders face in overcoming the non-payments 
crisis and stabilizing the economic situation.

  [Text] President Boris Yeltsin is meeting with heads of the 
Russian Federation's republics in one of his residences 
southwest of Moscow Thursday. Opening the meeting, Yeltsin 
pointed out that the old tradition of meetings with heads of the 
republics is being revived. "We plan to hold such meetings five 
to seven times a year," he said. "Such a meeting is being held 
for the first time after the adoption of the Constitution and 
elections to the Federal Assembly. In the past months a lot of 
changes have taken place, political stabilization is gaining 
momentum. The ruinous division of power has been overcome." 
  Yeltsin particularly noted that he "practically has no 
differences" with the speakers of the Federal Assembly Chambers 
Ivan Rybkin and Vladimir Shumeyko with whom he has been meeting 
on a regular basis. Yeltsin said that after adopting the 
constitution, new federative relations started to form. Out of 
88 subjects of the Federation, the elections took place and 
"were registered" in 61, and 17 subjects did not gather the 
necessary number of votes. Yeltsin expressed hope that elections 
to local bodies will be fully completed this year. Then a full 
balance of powers will be established, the president noted.

<F P=106> ["Exclusive" report No. 16(66) of April 1994] </F>
  [Text] TWO VIEWS FROM THE VOLGA ON RUSSIAN FEDERAL 
MATTERS 
<H5>  GOVERNOR OF NIZHNIY NOVGOROD: THE SEPARATION OF POWERS </H5>
SHOULD BE BASED ON THE EQUALITY OF ALL FEDERATION MEMBERS 
  The governor of Nizhniy Novgorod region BORIS NEMTSOV, 34, 
who until recently was also the presidential representative in 
the region, belongs to the younger generation of Russian 
politicians whom analysts consider candidates to the highest 
posts in future Russia. Several months ago he told 
Interfax-Exclusive about the distinctive features of the Nizhniy 
Novgorod pattern of transition to a free market economy. Now he 
answers questions from Interfax once again. 
  INTERFAX: What do you think of the current economic policy 
of the Russian government? 
  NEMTSOV: I think that in their latest speeches the president 
and prime-minister made points that are correct from the 
viewpoint of the current situation and gave the guidelines. 
They are determined to pursue a policy of restraining budget 
spending, offering social security to people in the low-income 
bracket, restructuring the economy, stabilizing the financial 
situation and observing reasonable protectionism. However, 
guidelines are not a program of action which implies concrete 
decisions: presidential decrees, government resolutions - these 
are few so far. I have the impression that the government does 
not have a detailed program, but a declaration of intentions, 
good as they can be. For example, how is the idea of building a 
competitive market compatible with increasing customs tariffs on 
imports? And what can one say of the agricultural policy of the 
government, if on the one hand, it approves the Nizhniy Novgorod 
pattern of land privatization and on the other, decides to form 
a superholding company in Tula region? I think that despite the 
attractiveness of the proclaimed ideas, it is premature to speak 
of a clear economic policy of the cabinet - it is only in the 
making. 
  INTERFAX: Do you see any change in the intentions of the 
cabinet, if not in its policy? 
  NEMTSOV: So far I see the determination of Prime-Minister 
Viktor Chernomyrdin to continue reforms, in agriculture for 
instance. It is reassuring that he has clearly realized the 
danger of hyperinflation and contrary to the accusations by 
former cabinet members he is not giving out money just to anyone. 
  INTERFAX: What do you think is keeping the current cabinet 
from more resolute actions? 
  NEMTSOV: One gets the impression that there is no one in the 
prime-minister's team capable of forecasting the consequences of 
decisions. If the political resolution of Chernomyrdin is 
backed by concrete and correct actions, by professional experts, 
the government has a future. 
  INTERFAX: How much do the reforms in Nizhniy Novgorod fit in 
the general picture of Russian changes? Do you have any 
differences with Moscow? 
  NEMTSOV: No, there is no such problem. There are no 
obstacles to economic reforms in our region: the federal 
government regards our initiatives with approval. The big 
companies are federal property, though, and they follow the 
rules of the federal government, therefore our interference in 
their operation is minimal. It would be good if we were allowed 
to reform such important fields as oil refining, oil supplies 
and engineering. But I realize that this is the prerogative of 
the federal authorities. 
  INTERFAX: Does your region need a special status, offering 
additional powers for the success of reforms? 
  NEMTSOV: No, we do not need one, the rights we have today 
are quite enough. 
  INTERFAX: What do you think of the treaty between Russia and 
Tatarstan on are the separation of powers? 
  NEMTSOV: I closely studied it and did not see any 
exceptional powers given to Tatarstan that would lie outside the 
federal constitution. But political life is very complicated 
and much depends on the name of the document. I this case I 
find it absolutely unacceptable. Tatarstan is a member of the 
Russian Federation, hence the treaty could have been entitled 
differently, for instance, a treaty on the separation of powers 
between a member of the Russian Federation, the republic of 
Tatarstan and the government of Russia. But evidently for Kazan 
the name was the key matter. And this is one of the unpleasant 
compromises. 
  INTERFAX: Which of its clauses do you find positive? 
  NEMTSOV: I think the text itself is going to be very useful 
for offering concrete contents to Articles 72 and 73 of the 
federal constitution. In my opinion the treaty with Tatarstan 
can become a model agreement on the separation of powers between 
the federal and local governments. By the way, such documents 
are already being drafted at instructions from the government. 
  INTERFAX: Is your region ready to sign such a document? 
  NEMTSOV: If the question emerges, the region is ready to do 
it among the first ones. I have no objections. Still I think 
that the objective process of the separation of powers should be 
based on the equality of all federation members. Inequality 
might turn Russia into a shapeless structure. 
  INTERFAX: Do you mean that treaties with all regions should 
be signed simultaneously? 
  NEMTSOV: Yes. Here I support Prime-Minister Chernomyrdin. 
But first the general rules of separating powers should be 
formulated. Particulars can be described in separate 
supplements. In this context the treaty with Tatarstan seems to 
play a positive role as a model, but on the other, it is an 
unpleasant example: the one who acts fast, is going to get more 
rights. 
  INTERFAX: Ominous forecasts are made about the consequences 
of the amnesty declared by the State Duma. How grounded do you 
think they are? 
  NEMTSOV: I think that the hullabaloo raised over the matter 
is incomparable with the possible consequences. It is a pity, 
of course, that an honest person (Aleksey Kazannik - Interfax) 
was forced to resign from the post of Prosecutor General. But 
the amnesty itself should not be dramatized. It will not have 
any serious consequences. The coming changes, primarily in the 
economy, is what determines things for Russia, not the number of 
detainees or convicts released. I am convinced that such things 
as the collapse of the industry, the snowballing of crime, the 
disintegration of production are much more dangerous for the 
stability of the country than the participation of some former 
convicts in rallies and demonstrations. 
  INTERFAX: But they are not planning to give up politics. 
  NEMTSOV: Evidently the persons who were set free as a result 
of the amnesty have passed the peak of their political career 
even though many of them think they have everything ahead. 
Take, for example, one of the contenders for presidency 
Aleksandr Rutskoy. I do not think he is going to find a 
platform with which he could win the elections because his 
political niche has been occupied partly by the Democratic Party 
of Nikolay Travkin, partly by the Liberal-Democratic Party of 
Vladimir Zhirinovskiy, partly by the Communist Party of Gennadiy 
Zyuganov. Their political ambitions will not permit them to 
give up their positions. As for the others, they did not 
noticeably influence the Russian political scene even earlier. 
  INTERFAX: You are known to have been active in the defence 
of the White House during the abortive coup in August 1991. 
What is your attitude to the release of the coup leaders? 
  NEMTSOV: Pragmatic. Evidently those people were guilty: I 
saw with my own eyes how they sent tanks to Moscow. But as a 
politician predicting the consequences of the steps taken by the 
Russian leadership I think that the release of Kryuchkov, Pavlov 
and other coup leaders will not influence the situation in the 
country in any way. These people will only join the 
irreconcilable opposition without becoming its leaders though. I 
would want to single out another aspect of the problem: the 
amnesty relieved of responsibility the organizers of the tragic 
events in October 1993 "on both sides". I do not think the 
State Duma did reasonably when it refused to investigate the 
circumstance causing human losses. That is not in parliamentary 
traditions. One gets the impression that the amnesty is 
beneficial only for the opposition. 
  INTERFAX: What do you think of the idea of a memorandum on 
civic accord in Russia? 
  NEMTSOV: I do not think that my viewpoint coincides with the 
official one: to my mind the effort is totally lost. Russia 
approved such documents and memorandums back in the days of 
Ruslan Khasbulatov (the speaker of the last Supreme Soviet). 
Their historic value was minimal because they are not legally 
binding for their parties. On the other hand, the move can be 
supported as an initiative which at least morally binds the 
sides to refrain from destructive actions. But I think it is 
very naive to hope that after signing the memorandum civic peace 
is going to reign in Russia. 
<H5>  TATAR GOVERNMENT ACCUSED OF OBSTRUCTING REFORMS </H5>
  Tatarstan has won greater economic independence after 
signing 
a treaty and package of agreements with Russia. In the two 
years of talks and the republic's insistence on a special 
status, Kazan has had an opportunity of embracing economic 
policies distinct from the center's. To what extent did Kazan 
avail itself of that chance? Tatar Vice Premier Ravil Muratov 
was airing his view on this and other questions in a recent 
interview with Interfax. 
  INTERFAX: Many say the advantages of Tatarstan's choice of a 
softer transition to market are obvious: the government has 
managed to an extent to cushion off the shock from price 
liberalization and halt production slump in the farming sector. 
But all of those measures were taken at the cost of the budget 
and oil exports. The non-payment crisis and a fall in world oil 
prices have put to question those two sources of financing. 
What are the prospects awaiting the Tatar economy? 
  MURATOV: Regrettably, the government has virtually missed a 
range of promising economic development programs by focusing on 
social programs and propping the countryside or in other words, 
by fighting for the republic's survival. True, oil revenues did 
help to stave off an economic collapse to an extent. But 
relative stabilization of the economy must be seen as the 
starting point for reforms, above all in financial, tax and land 
reform. Tatarstan was one of the first to introduce bills of 
exchange in an effort to ease the crisis of non-payment and a 
lack of federal credits. But the local banks, and above all, 
the National Bank, have obstructed the measure. The National 
Bank preferred cash operations and making high profits for the 
Central Bank of Russia rather than dealing in securities. Nor 
was the measure accepted by enterprises. Kazan has lost both 
its chances and time. Russian banks which have begun to 
circulate bills of exchange are faring far better than we did. 
We have now started falling behind some neighboring regions 
which are fleshing out their own programs. In the meantime, 
local enterprises which are stuck in a mire of non-payment have 
been stubbornly holding back to old ways of account clearing. 
The government is having to allocate billions of rubles to 
Nizhnekamsneftekhim company to rescue Tatneft oil producer. But 
the trouble is, state companies are interlinked. While we think 
of appeasing oil producers until the petrochemical industry has 
sold its product, both of the sectors prefer to pile up their 
own debt. 
  INTERFAX: Where does the money come from to be able to 
sustain such plans? 
  MURATOV: The government takes up costly social programs 
which in itself is positive. But the impression is we do not at 
all care how to raise money. In the first place, the question 
is one of the budget itself. Who will pay taxes? State 
companies heavily indebted to each other can ill afford to do 
so. The burden of tax on the private sector weighs so heavily 
that the only option is to roll back production. Most of the 
collective and state farms depending on government subsidies are 
loss makers. In the meantime, we are wasting time and missing 
opportunities of embracing reforms at a least possible cost.The 
federal government continues to pour in billions of rubles to 
back up loss making farms at a time when it must carry out land 
reform, declare private ownership of the land as written down in 
the constitution and transfer it to those who can till it at a 
profit. Russia has no concept of land reform or promotion of 
private farming. As a result, the market and state price of 
meat is almost the same, but the situation is likely to worsen 
as time goes by. The government will have to spend trillions 
rather than millions of rubles in autumn when the harvest season 
is over. What sort of budget must there be to sustain such 
expenditure? What is needed is government support for those who 
are willing and able to work the land efficiently instead of 
subsidizing the bankrupts. 
  INTERFAX: Was there anything to prevent the government from 
drafting its own program of support to private business in the 
countryside and urban areas? Nizhniy Novgorod region has less 
powers than Tatarstan and yet its model of land reform is 
recommended as an example to follow. Its Governor Boris Nemtsov 
did not seek a greater say in export policies and yet, the West 
appears to be willing to invest in the regional economy and 
small size businesses there. 
  MURATOV: I should have thought it is our stuck in the mud 
approach, caution and a desire to avoid mistakes of the federal 
reform that are in the way. Despite its verbal support for 
small and medium size businesses, Kazan has taken no real steps 
to do so. A year ago, it was clear that conditions and benefits 
must be set for the priority development of infrastructures for 
business, banks, leasing, marketing and brokerage firms. 
Despite high interests, many of the smaller and medium size are 
on the brink of bankruptcy, a situation that is barely conducive 
for industrial development. Nor can exorbitant taxes help create 
a climate for business activity. One can hardly hope for the 
emergence of a middle class at a time when traders and 
businessmen are widely regarded as criminals. The Tatar 
parliament behaves in a conservative way by banning plant 
managers to engage in private business or proposing to close 
private kiosks. 
  INTERFAX: Surely, Kazan's independence in export trade 
should give it greater financial opportunities? 
  MURATOV: Much of it is still on paper. We still have to 
fight to get it. One example. The federal fuel and energy 
ministry has transferred exclusive rights for shipment and 
exports of crude oil through Odessa port to the Russian Koneks 
firm in violation of agreements with Moscow and Kiev on a free 
flow of goods through both countries. Tatarstan is entitled to 
conduct its own export policies but attempts are being made to 
dictate terms to Kazan including import and export taxes set by 
the federal government. What sort of guarantees for repatriation 
of capital could the Tatar government possibly give to foreign 
investors in a situation such as it is now? Worse still, higher 
import tariffs have wrecked some of the government programs. We 
are now unable to import telecommunications equipment into the 
republic. Away from doom and gloom, assertions about Tatarstan's 
economic prosperity are not true. Even if its economic 
indicators are a bit better than those of Tatarstan's neighbors, 
there must be no illusions - the republic is virtually at a 
standstill. Now that the treaty with Moscow has been signed, 
Tatarstan should avail itself in full measure of the rights 
provided and get all of the agreements being put in place.

<F P=106> [Interview with Russian Justice Minister Yuriy Kalmykov by </F>
Leonid Nikitinskiy; date and place not given: "What Is Stopping 
State Duma From Passing Laws. Our Correspondent Leonid 
Nikitinskiy Talks With Justice Minister and State Duma Deputy 
Yuriy Kalmykov"] 
  [Text] [Nikitinskiy] Which of your two hats would you 
prefer to wear as we begin -- minister or deputy? 
  [Kalmykov] I would like to divorce the two roles. Although 
as justice minister I can probably see the problems in 
legislation more clearly than most of my Duma colleagues. Our 
rule-of-law area is reminiscent of the diminishing ozone layer 
over the earth -- and saving it and launching a mechanism for 
reviving it will take emergency measures. 
  [Nikitinskiy] The Duma has been at work for four months, and 
not a single law in the proper sense of the word has been passed 
in that time.... 
  [Kalmykov] To a certain extent this hiatus is normal since 
it is due to the discussion of the standing orders and other 
documents regulating the work of the Duma itself. At the same 
time, each plenary session in the Duma begins with a heated 
debate on the agenda which has already been approved the 
previous day by the Duma Council. Feelings run high, and, as a 
result, we are not in a position to tackle actual legislative 
matters. I put this down mainly to a lack of experience. 
  [Nikitinskiy] Experience is something you have to earn. But 
the first and, so far, last legislative attempt to "pass" the 
law on the Constitutional Court by a two-thirds vote failed for 
purely political reasons. For certain factions and groups in 
the Duma torpedoing the Constitution is a very important element 
of their strategy of preparing for the next elections. 
  [Kalmykov] Nonetheless the majority of people in the Duma, 
as I see it, are sensible enough to stay within the 
constitutional framework. This was stated by Speaker Ivan 
Rybkin as a representative of the majority of deputies. For its 
part the government and the president have enough carefully 
prepared draft laws in reserve that they can and should 
"bombard" the Duma -- but the correct utilization of these 
drafts is being impeded by the fact that the procedure for their 
submission has not been regulated in detail and there are no set 
precedents. 
  [Nikitinskiy] Do you mean that there is political rivalry 
even in the sphere of legislative initiative? 
  [Kalmykov] I probably have to agree. I believe that, for 
instance, the president should initiate only the most important 
draft constitutional laws and major codified acts. The 
legislative initiative of factions and deputies' groups should 
in the course of time become more the exception, with the bulk 
of draft laws -- as is the case worldwide -- being submitted by 
the government. 
  [Nikitinskiy] As long as draft laws are being used for 
political advertising they will merely distract lawmakers into 
rehashing their deliberately unpalatable product. Yet there are 
many filters in different branches of power designed to prevent 
any "foreign bodies" from getting into the legislative 
apparatus.... 
  [Kalmykov] These mechanisms often do not so much help each 
other by sticking to a unified strategy as produce conflicts, 
which creates chaos in lawmaking and a loophole for lobbyists. 
Answering on behalf of the Justice Ministry, I can say that, 
owing to apparatus intrigues, it is often bypassed and prevented 
from carrying out its direct duties. Our functions are 
expanding on paper, but other structures -- primarily the State 
Legal Administration -- are constantly infringing them. 
  From the very beginning, by dint of its role, this has been 
one of the departments at the Presidential Administration 
responsible for the legal side both of its own edicts and of 
legislative initiatives. Initially, it also included 
departments dealing with awards, appeals, and citizenship. 
These were then hived off into independent Presidential 
Administration structures, but the State Legal Administration 
was not only not cut back, it grew to an absurd size. This 
structure now has a staff as big as a sector ministry, but it 
has arrogated intersector functions to itself. You get the 
impression that the State Legal Administration is not controlled 
either by the Presidential Administration or by the president 
himself -- not to mention the government, with which it is in 
constant conflict instead of organizing working contacts. 
  [Nikitinskiy] There are some very qualified legal 
specialists working at the State Legal Administration. 
According to lawyers, a comparison of their expertise with that 
of the Justice Ministry leaves the latter coming off worse. 
  [Kalmykov] The level of provision and benefits in that 
mysterious structure is an order of magnitude higher than we 
have. But many of them are not at all doing the job that should 
follow from the modest functions of the president's apparatus. 
When it comes to the legislative process the State Legal 
Administration constantly obtructs the government and even the 
president and torpedoes many draft laws merely because they 
carry an "outside stamp." We can now expect friction between 
the State Legal Administration and Aleksandr Yakovlev, the 
president's representative in parliament. 
  We recently received from the State Legal Administration a 
draft of the Labor Code with a proposal that we study it and 
make our comments. But how did it get there, bypassing the 
Justice Ministry and the government? At the same time, the 
draft Civil Code, on which long and painstaking work has been 
done by specialists at the behest of the president and the 
government -- and that was no secret to the State Legal 
Administration -- has gotten bogged down there "for 
coordination" and has not made any progress for months. This 
after having been approved by the government and receiving a 
promise from the president to support the legislative 
initiative. I suspect that the real reason for this delay lies 
once again not in the sphere of the law, but in the sphere of 
official ambition. In order to spite the specialists drawing up 
the draft Civil Code, another group of lawyers is now urgently 
working on the Trade Code. The draft of this code, which rivals 
the Civil Code, has to all intents and purposes been kept 
secret, and we can so far only speculate as to what it will look 
like. We only know that the working group is headed by 
Academician Vladimir Laptev, formerly a vigorous opponent of the

the framework of the concept of so-called "economic law."

  [Text] Yesterday the Judicial Chamber on Information 
Disputes proposed that the founders of EKSPRESS GAZETA -- 
KOMSOMOLSKAYA PRAVDA and the SEGODNYA group -- fire the weekly's 
editor-in-chief, Aleksandr Kupriyanov. The reason for this 
disgrace was a March article about all kinds of perks enjoyed by 
State Duma deputies. The chamber, in the person of its 
chairman, Anatoliy Vengerov, deemed this publication to be "a

Foundation, Viewpoint's sociological service, and the INTERFAX 
News Agency] 
  [Excerpts] Almost every tenth city resident of Russia pins 
hopes in terms of the country's overcoming the crisis, for the 
army, the Interior and Security Ministries. 
  - Those who rely on power structures are against democracy 
in 
most cases. 
  - About one-fourth of the polled do not know who in Russia 
now could be attributed to the "middle class". 
  - If in the United States more than 50 percent believe 
that the state is becoming richer as the number of rich people 
grows, in Russia more than 50 percent disagree with the thesis. 
  - If respondents can switch on Channel Four of the Russian 
television, more than 50 percent of them prefer to watch NTV 
programs and their number grows with every month. 
  - Even the emergence of computer games does not affect 
women's preferences in toys: they still believe a doll is the 
best toy. 
  - The young prefer to watch thrillers, the old ones 
comedies and soap operas. 
<H5>  RESPONDENTS SPEAK ABOUT RUSSIA'S OVERCOMING THE CRISIS </H5>
  To the question: "Which bodies of power can help Russia to 
overcome the crisis?" the answers were the following [in 
percent]: 


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 


  Taking part in the poll held early in April, were 1040 city

------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 
|Yes                                   |49                                    |

------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 


  Those who pin their hopes on Yeltsin believing he may help 
Russia to overcome the crisis, mostly believe that democracy is 
needed (77 percent). Those who rely on power structures, are 
mostly against democracy (44 percent). 
<H5>  WHAT IS `MIDDLE CLASS'? </H5>
  To the question: " Who, do you think, can be attributed to 
the "middle class" in Russia?", the answers were the following: 
[in percent] 


------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 
|Those who have a comfortable flat, a  |36                                    |

  If U.S. residents were asked the same question, there would 
be no undecided. The situation is different in Russia. Everyone 
knows from the childhood what is the working class or the class 
of capitalists. The notion "middle class" is new for the 
Russians. 
  However, while politicians are discussing who could be 
attributed to the middle class, and parties are being formed 
which declare they uphold the interests of the middle class, a 
considerable part of the population attributes to the middle 
class the owners of cars. This means that people themselves try 
to explain the notion. The poll was conducted simultaneously 
with the above one and involved the same respondents. 
<H5>  WHILE IN THE UNITED STATES OVER 50 PERCENT OF RESPONDENTS </H5>
BELIEVE THAT THE STATE IS BECOMING RICHER AS THE NUMBER OF THE 
RICH GROWS, IN RUSSIA OVER 50 PERCENT DISAGREE WITH THE NOTION 
  Residents of Russia and the United States were asked to 
answer the question: "Do you agree that the state is getting 
richer as the number of the rich people grows?" Here are the 
answers: 


------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 
|                         |Americans ()            |Russians()              | 
------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 
|Yes                      |62                       |29                       | 
------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 
|No                       |32                       |52                       |

|Undecided                |6                        |19                       | 
------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 


  Taking part in the poll were 1472 respondents in Russia. In 
the United States the poll was conducted by the Gallup 
Organization. 
<H5>  WHAT TV CHANNEL RUSSIAN PEOPLE PREFER </H5>
  To the question "What TV companies do you prefer?" the 
respondents who can watch Channel four over their TV-sets, 
answered in the following way:

------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 


  The Russians watch the Ostankino Channel more often than 
NTV, 
which is being done by the force of habit, explain sociologists. 
However, over the time that passed since the first poll, the 
number of TV viewers, who believe that programs of NTV are more 
interesting than of other channels, has almost doubled. 
  To the question: "Which TV channels do you prefer?" the 
answers were the following: 


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

  [Text] Moscow April 21 TASS -- "The necessity of solving 
the non-payments problem is one of the main points of the 
memorandum sent by Russian President Boris Yeltsin to Prime 
Minister Viktor Chernomyrdin and the chairmen of the Federation 
Council and State Duma", presidential spokesman Vycheslav 
Kostikov told a briefing in the Kremlin on Thursday. 
  According to the spokesman, "the technical solution of the 
non-payments problem is the prerogative of the government, but, 
since that question has grown into a political one, it has 
entered the competency of the president". 
  Kostikov said Yeltsin's "memorandum should stimulate the 
process of economic reform". He explained that, in the same 
memorandum, the president "calls the attention of the lawmakers 
to the fact that they have been too slow in enacting laws in the 
economic sphere".

  [Text] On Thursday Russian Prime Minister Viktor 
Chernomyrdin reported at the sitting of the Cabinet's presidium 
that the government had received a letter from the president 
which contains direct instructions regarding the situation in 
the state economy and in the country as a whole. Chernomyrdin 
noted that "the president's concern is not ungrounded" and "his 
attitude towards the instructions of the head of the Russian 
state is always a very serious one." 
  In Chernomyrdin's words, the document received from Yeltsin 
was already considered on April 19 and the issues defined in it 
would be solved in the near term. Chernomyrdin reported that 
Vice Premier and Economics Minister Aleksandr Shokhin had been 
commissioned to fulfill the president's instructions. 
  The sitting of the government's presidium approved the 
principal trends of the Cabinet's social policy for 1994. The 
social policy gives priorities to the following: prevention of 
any lowering of the population's level of incomes, preserving of 
the balance between economic interests and material 
opportunities of three major population groups: hired workers, 
entrepreneurs, and disabled citizens. 
  To this effect Chernomyrdin indicated that the tax reform to 
which he pays the greatest significance is to be the key element 
of the social policy. In his words, "taxes should not bring 
damage to people." 
  The government's presidium returned for revision the draft 
of 
the federal program on assistance in the population's employment 
in 1994 prepared by the Federal Employment Service. As 
Chernomyrdin said, the document does not properly point out 
measures for helping in the employment of those who graduate 
from educational institutions, does not take into consideration 
investment programs the implementation of which the unemployed 
can be involved. A governmental commission headed by Vice 
Premier Yuriy Yarov has been formed to revise the federal 
program.

<F P=106> [Rustam Narzikulov report: "Yeltsin Feels an Urgent Need </F>
for Chernomyrdin's Political Will"] 
  [Text] The president has sent a letter to Viktor 
Chernomyrdin "outlining the methods of resolving" the nonpayment 
problem. Initially the letter was just "a memo on the nonpayment 
problem" to be addressed to Central Bank Chairman Viktor 
Gerashchenko, which was later converted into a public message to 
the head of government. 
  The change in the document's political status has an 
exclusively political bottom line -- the president has to 
demonstrate to society his profound understanding of the 
economic situation and his concern over economic problems. It is 
not a coincidence that ITAR-TASS ended its report on the letter 
to the prime minister with a high-sounding passage: "Boris 
Yeltsin is taking on the entire responsibility for the second 
stage of reform, including the need to free the Russian economy 
from enterprises that have no future prospects." 
  The quotation very appropriately points out that the mass 
restructuring of money-losing enterprises -- in terms of its 
consequences -- is on a par with the January 1992 price 
liberalization and subsequent efforts by various governments to 
stabilize the ruble. In this case, nonpayments are a very 
simple but reliable indicator of a grave economic depression, 
from which there is no other way out than to apply the procedure 
of bankruptcies with the subsequent restructuring of an immense 
number of businesses. So the president, who has fairly good 
experts in his staff, meticulously listed altogether correct, 
standard, and, hence, long well-known methods to resolve the 
"nonpayment problem." 
  However, the first part of the above ITAR-TASS quotation -- 
unlike the second one -- is outright cunning by a most 
experienced political player. The president, even unaware of 
economic and legal nuances of the bankruptcy procedure, realizes 
all too well the political hazard of bringing what is still 
mostly state-owned property into "a healthy state" (the 
president's expression -- R.N.). 
  But this is what a government has been envisioned for in the 
Russian system of executive authority -- as a rule it is the 
government, not the head of state, who puts unpopular decisions 
into practice. If Boris Yeltsin really sees bankruptcies -- not 
the "mutual cancellation of debts," government credits, and so 
forth -- as the sole method to combat the crisis of sales, a 
method that does not have any alternative, then the prime 
minister is facing what may prove to be the most difficult time 
in his government career. It is he, not the president, who will 
bear responsibility for public displeasure with forced 
bankruptcies. 
  Viktor Chernomyrdin's economic successes of the past four 
months (the slowing down of inflation and the postponement of 
new customs duties) are attributable exclusively to an 
unorthodox and at the same time extremely efficient method of 
"delayed decisions." How this invention could be applied to 
bankruptcies is hard to imagine, because "delayed decisions" on 
nonpayments are tantamount to the conservation of unviable 
bankrupts. Given this situation, the prime minister alone can 
save himself -- if he manages to find yet another unorthodox way 
out of the political corner into which he has been pushed.

<F P=106> [Report by Irina Savvateyeva: "Bankruptcy Surgery May Be the </F>
Way to Help a Sick National Economy"] 
  [Text] On Tuesday Boris Yeltsin sent a letter about the 
problem of nonpayments not only, as it happens, to Viktor 
Chernomyrdin, but also to Ivan Rybkin, Vladimir Shumeyko, and 
Viktor Gerashchenko. While drawing attention to the urgency of 
the problem of nonpayments, the president stressed at the same 
time that the highly delicate problem of bankruptcy, which the 
authorities are showing no signs of tackling, had to be resolved 
more rapidly. 
  But the choice of the epistolary mode raises some questions. 
Aleksandr Livshits, head of the president's group of experts, 
talking about it in an interview for IZVESTIYA, said that a 
letter, unlike an edict, has no directive force, and it does not 
prescribe measures that have to be implemented. Yeltsin was 
merely expounding his own view of an urgent problem, setting it 
out, as it were, for the Federal Assembly, government, and 
Central Bank to view. 
  So the mode chosen by the president suggests that Boris 
Nikolayevich is granting the addressees the right not only to 
tackle a very acute issue independently, but also to take 
responsibility for its solution. 
  It should be noted in this connection that the head of the 
group of experts categorically rejected the statement ascribed 
to him by ITAR-TASS that, by sending the letter, "Boris Yeltsin 
is assuming full responsibility for the second step of the 
reforms, including the need to rid the Russian economy of those 
production facilities with no future." 
  "Of course, the president did not have anything of the sort 
in mind." 
  Indeed, the document itself is devoted, apparently, not so 
much to the problem of bankruptcy as to actual nonpayments. 
According to Livshits, the letter maps out various ways of 
resolving this problem, including the bankruptcy procedure. And 
each addressee is being recommended tasks that fall within his 
sphere of responsibilities. 
  The president has taken into account, Livshits stressed, all 
the proposals from various departments on resolving the 
nonpayments problem. Including the Finance Ministry's scheme 
for the return of state debts, which are often the cause of 
nonpayments (see IZVESTIYA 31 March 1994 for more detail), and a 
proposal on implementing bankruptcy procedure, put forward by 
the Federal Administration for Insolvency Cases and the 
Economics Ministry... 
  Unfortunately, IZVESTIYA journalists were unable to get a 
look at the text of the letter in order to be able to provide 
more details. The two-hour search for the document was 
unsuccessful. 
  The unflappable president's press service duty officer said: 
"It is an unofficial document and we do not have it..." Either 
the addressees' press services, offices, and general deparments 
had no idea of the letter or they were being kept out of it, as 
was the Duma apparatus: "Rybkin has the letter. What were we 
supposed to do, show it to everyone?!" 
  Yet, actually, it would not have hurt to "show the document 
to everyone." Of course, I am addressing this notion not to a 
petty official in the Duma general department, but to senior 
staffers of B. Yeltsin's apparatus. 
  The heads of the Federal Assembly, government, and Central 
Bank will have a great deal of work to do implementing the 
proposals set down in the president's letter. Not only will 
they have to adopt special decrees, but they will also have to 
amend current legislation. 
  But the existence of the letter by no means signifies that 
amendments and decrees will be adopted immediately. The 
president has merely expressed his view on an urgent problem, 
thus indicating possible ways of cooperating with the 
legislative authority. Whether this cooperation comes about is 
not dependent on him alone.

<F P=106> [Aleksey Portanskiy report: "Reform From Above Not Being </F>
Carried Out in Russia, Aleksandr Livshits, Leader of the Russian 
Federation President's Group of Experts, Claims"] 
  [Text] The author of Russia's first handbook on the market 
economy, Doctor of Economic Sciences Aleksandr Livshits, is 
already familiar to IZVESTIYA readers, since he has many times 
appeared in this newspaper as a writer. Two months have passed 
since Professor Livshits moved to the Kremlin, taking up the 
post of leader of the Russian Federation president's group of 
experts. 
  "You encounter many absolutely gripping topics here," he 
says: "There are dramas, tragedies, joys -- in a word, 
everything a man needs." From this we may conclude that my 
interlocutor has taken up his new job with characteristic 
enthusiasm. Nevertheless, summing up his one-month incumbency 
in his new post, he noted that so far he has only been laboring 
to "reduce the negative, not to create the positive." 
  February-March saw an unforeseen substantial fall in 
production. One reason is well known -- the mass defaulting 
which caused enterprises to shut down. 
  No economic mechanism can regulate the problem of debt 
defaulting smoothly, without destroying production: No coercive 
measures were drawn up, and a reversion to the past was feared. 
A virtually spontaneous, very expensive, mutual absorption of 
debts (apart from the recovery of debts by the Ministry of 
Finance) is taking place. 
  You often hear directors say that, on the whole, many people 
have adapted: Defaulting will go away miraculously, they say, 
and things are OK. But there will be no miracle. This is a 
crisis of incomplete reform. And trying to solve the problem 
once again by the methods of 1992, i.e. through credit 
injections, would mean ending up this time with inflation not of 
15-20 percent, as before, but all of 40 percent. Fortunately, 
the government understands this perfectly. 
  The payments crisis induces Prof. Livshits to observe that 
there is no controlled mechanism of economic reform in Russia. 
Reform is a change in the design of a mechanism, be it a clock 
or an economy. In this sense reform is not being carried out in 
terms of a controlled process of redesigning the economic 
mechanism from above. Nor has this been the case, in the 
estimation of the expert group leader, for at least 18 months to 
two years (reform is being carried out spontaneously from below, 
but that is another story). Even though governments and 
ministers have changed in this time -- some called reformers, 
others the reverse. 
  We are accustomed to judging how reformist a government is 
by 
what sort of monetary and credit policy it implements. In 
reality, this is no more than an illusion: Monetary policy, in 
Livshits' opinion, can create better or worse conditions for 
reforms, but it does not change the design. The number of 
monopolies is not thereby reduced, nor do civilized markets 
emerge, or changes in the forms of ownership occur. So that 
there is just one sign of a reformist government, Aleksandr 
Yakovlevich insists: whether or not it engages in reform, 
whether or not it controls the process. 
  We have contrived to lose all control over state 
enterprises, 
although we have considerable experience in this area. The 
state sector is being not just privatized but sold off 
chaotically, without premeditation, without any kind of decrees 
or laws. Therefore virtually no reform can be seen in this area. 
  Unfortunately the returns on privatization are so far 
small. Check privatization was necessary, but it brings 
virtually nothing in to the budget. With such meager investment 
resources we must seriously consider how to sell the most 
efficient property to major investors. World experience shows 
that a country which carries out mass privatization as a rule 
obtains healthy resources and does not suffer inflation. 
  Taxation. Reform in precisely this area is capable of 
influencing the design mentioned above, to wit, by stimulating 
investment activity. Instead of this, as my interlocutor puts 
it, the only result of the taxation system currently operating 
is "a Russia-wide groan from below." 
  One further argument to prove the absence of reform -- the 
wholesale markets. There are changes in this area, but they are 
fairly untypical. The painfully familiar former state supply 
bodies have now been transformed into joint-stock companies, but 
in no way ceding their monopoly status in the wholesale markets. 
In actual fact the situation has even worsened, since a state 
monopoly was hardly worse than is a private one. 
  In recent months, and even years, it has been fashionable to 
talk about the allocation of structural priorities, the points 
of growth where resources should be invested, about selective 
policy. Has this policy been elaborated in reality? You can see 
in the federal budget how resources are distributed for federal 
special-purpose programs. But here only the projects that are 
finalized earliest and best can receive priority, and these 
projects will be funded accordingly. Does this mean that a 
given project and a given sector are really accorded priority? 
Certainly not. 
  And what is the structure of priorities in our country 
today? 
There is really nothing especially clever here: It is nothing 
but the result of the real correlation of forces in the Duma and 
between the representatives of certain sector blocs. Who would 
be so bold as to claim that these are indeed Russia's structural 
priorities? 
  All the above might prompt someone to ask the legitimate 
question: But why, in point of fact, complicate life for 
ourselves? Why is all this necessary, if all over the world the 
process of forming market mechanisms has proceeded as naturally 
as the grass grows? 
  Yes, the Kremlin's chief expert suggests, this is absolutely 
true: Only the American grass was not concreted over for 70 
years. On the other hand, we made up our minds to smash the 
concrete and wait for grass to appear. It did indeed spring up, 
but through the cracks and overlying pieces of concrete. Hence 
all this grass takes on wild, distorted forms. Such are the 
outlines of our market economy today. What we really need to do 
is dismantle this concrete seriously, genuinely, but this is not 
yet being done. There is only one solution: to complete 
reform, as clearly stated in the president's message to the 
Federal Assembly. 
  Today inflation has been comparatively stabilized; however, 
this is the result not of last year's policy, but of the policy 
of the first few months of this year. And a further rapid fall 
in inflation should be viewed as a great danger. The value of 
such achievements is only significant when what is really 
important is not thereby lost. Today we are losing part of our 
high-tech industry, as my interlocutor wrote in IZVESTIYA in 
December, and this process has not been stopped. 
  In an economy like ours inflation can be beaten only 
gradually, through positional warfare. But the factor of its 
relative stabilization must be used to achieve at least, for 
example, a small reduction in centralized interest rates. That 
is to say that investors should be given some kind of signal for 
action. Of course they need guarantees and economic freedom, 
but this is again nothing less than controlled reform. 
  The systemic crisis, the incompleteness of reform -- all 
this 
cannot, unfortunately, be solved overnight. Livshits assures us 
that, whatever we do now, by the fall all the same, familiar 
problems will come our way again. But since we know in advance 
that reform will progress slowly, we must try at least to 
minimize the difficulties as much as possible. There are 
elementary ways and means connected with the elementary 
introduction of order. Why is this not being done? I think, 
because of the weakness of the state and many other factors. 
  Incidentally, there is no problem of defaulting on payments 
in the private sector. Where there is no state sector, debts 
are always extracted, albeit by primitive methods. This is 
another weed growing through the concrete. But for a state to 
be unable to cope with state enterprises -- who ever heard 
anything like it? 
  All the same, do they know behind the Kremlin walls what to 
do about defaulting? 
  Above all, there are no plans there to change the 
government; 
no direct coercive measures are being prepared, although certain 
recommendations are being made to the president. There is no 
question of hitting the kopek in anyone's pocket; but the time 
has come to compel enterprises to settle their debts, activating 
their hard currency resources if necessary. 
  Aleksandr Livshits himself believes that a clear timetable 
should be established for the elimination of budget debt not 
only for 1993, but also in terms of the resources being 
distributed now. We must find the strength to establish rigid 
controls over the passage of budgetary funds through the whole 
system. If necessary, laws should be amended. We should worry 
especially about Russian enterprises which deliver products to 
the CIS republics and are not receiving payment on time. 
  All this, of course, will not provide a radical solution to 
the default problem -- there is no avoiding bankruptcies and the 
circulation of promissory notes. But the scale of these things 
can be markedly reduced. 
  The government's strategy was made public at the beginning 
of 
March. Descriptions of it as inflationary have not been borne 
out. If it manages to adopt a series of measures to counter 
defaulting on payments, improve the situation in the consumer 
market, and seriously tackle the redesign of the economic 
mechanism, paths to survival will be opened.

<F P=106> [Aleksandr Davidyants report: "Ivanovo -- City of </F>
Unemployed? The Crisis in Light Industry and the Textile 
Industry Can Be Surmounted Only Through Joint Efforts by the 
Center and the Regions"] 
  [Text] Production volumes in the textile industry and 
light industry have fallen more than 50 percent over the past 
three years. Today only a small proportion of enterprises is 
continuing to work steadily, while a further drop in production 
is occurring in the bulk of factories. A fall in production 
volumes has been noted for literally all types of output. The 
financial position of enterprises is continuing to deteriorate. 
As a result of the government's inflexible monetary and credit 
policy producers do not have the working capital to acquire raw 
materials. Because of this many factories are on the verge of 
bankruptcy, the majority of them are going over to a short work 
day and a short work week, and they have been forced to make 
people take unpaid leave. 
  The critical situation which has taken shape in the sector 
necessitated the urgent holding in Moscow of an enlarged session 
of the board of the Russian Interregional Union of Textile and 
Light Industry Entrepreneurs. Boris Fomin, its president, 
pointed out that this is the first time the sector's problems 
have been discussed at such a high level. Representatives of 
the Russian Federation State Committee for Industrial Policy, 
the Ministry of Economics, the Ministry of Finance, and the 
Central Bank participated in the work of the conference in 
addition to leaders of enterprises. Representatives of 37 
Russian Federation kray and oblast administrations were also 
invited to the capital. 
  In Boris Fomin's opinion, the situation can be rectified if 
enterprises are given assistance out of local budgets. As is 
known, the federal budget today controls only 15 percent of all 
the funds, the rest of the money being in the regions. It is no 
coincidence that, as experience shows, the situation is far 
better where the leaders of krays and oblasts devote proper 
attention to enterprises' problems, allocate credits to them, 
and help them to acquire raw materials. But this does not mean, 
of course, that the government must entirely dissociate itself 
from the sector's problems; on the contrary, without state 
support for enterprises during this transitional period it is 
hardly possible to reckon on the successful implementation of 
economic reforms. 
  The appeal to the country's leadership adopted by the 
participants in the enlarged session of the Union of Textile and 
Light Industry Entrepreneurs says that the sector is in a very 
grave position today. Hidden unemployment, which already has 
more than 700,000 working people in its grip, the majority of 
whom are women, is escalating into real unemployment. Wages are 
not paid for several months. People can see no way out of the 
present situation and have been reduced to despair, there is 
growing indignation at the government's failure to take 
effective measures, and strike committees are being set up. The 
appeal proposes a whole number of specific measures that might 
halt the collapse of these sectors of industry. 
  The results of the conference were examined at a session of 
the Russian Federation Government Commission on Operational 
Questions under the chairmanship of First Vice Premier Oleg 
Soskovets. The Ministry of Finance was instructed to find an 
opportunity to grant to enterprises a deferment of the repayment 
of the preferential centralized credits issued in the sum total 
of 8.7 billion rubles [R], including R1.3 billion for Ivanovo 
Oblast, and to postpone the deadline for repaying the said 
credits until 1 January 1995. In addition, measures will be 
taken jointly with the Bank of Russia to prolong until 1 July 
1994 the centralized credits to the tune of R32.4 billion 
received by textile and light industry enterprises in 1993 to 
acquire raw materials at the prime rate of the Bank of Russia, 
as well as measures to prolong through the end of this year the 
credits to the tune of R44 billion allocated to Ivanovo Oblast 
enterprises on the same terms. It was also decided to grant to 
individual textile and light industry enterprises in Ivanovo 
Oblast a six-month deferment of payments of profits tax and VAT 
into the federal budget to the tune of R25 billion.

20 percent which, he thinks, would considerably liven up

from the proposed reserve standby credit ($4 billion) that may 
be received as soon as in the fall.

<F P=106> [Viktor Sergeyev report: "Voice Heeded"] </F>
  [Text] Our economy is becoming increasingly fevered. In 
the first quarter the production slump reached the record level 
of 25 percent. The unstable internal political situation in 
Russia and the deepening economic crisis, which could cause a 
powerful social explosion this year, are giving rise to growing 
Western concern. Political and business circles in the United 
States, Germany, Japan, and other states are increasingly openly 
voicing their opinion of the inability of the country's present 
leadership to find a way out of the impasse without relying on 
strong public organizations. 
  The Federation of Commodity Producers [FCP] has sent the 
Russian Federation president proposals for taking measures 
without delay to rescue Russian industrial and agricultural 
production. The message makes a hard-hitting analysis of the 
very grave situation in the Russian economy and sets forth 
specific measures to organize a system of cooperation between 
the FCP and the government with a view to working out and 
implementing specific joint actions. B. Yeltsin has examined 
the proposals and instructed V. Chernomyrdin to arrange 
cooperation with the FCP for the purpose of overcoming the 
disastrous drop in production and curbing the growth of 
unemployment. 
  The FCP's practical activity in shaping new relations 
between 
commodity producers and the government and foreign partners is a 
real step on the way to creating a self-organizing system of 
economic relations. Russia will be unable to emerge from the 
crisis without the painstaking, gradual building of working 
market infrastructures and new relations in the economy. The 
hopes of Ye. Gaydar and his supporters that an unrestrained 
market will itself set everything to rights and that the economy 
will start working efficiently have, as was to be expected, 
proved a bluff. The transition to a civilized market is a 
complex process which must be conducted sensibly and 
systematically. 
  This FCP activity is meeting with increasing support from 
Russian entrepreneurs, the corps of directors, and trade unions. 
This is of considerable importance, since Yuriy Skokov has 
declared his intention to run as a candidate in the 1996 
presidential election and needs new supporters and broad 
support. Today this cannot be achieved with fine promises alone 
-- few people believe them anymore.

  [Text] As many as 4300 Russian enterprises were forced to 
entirely or partially stop their work this February, as a 
result, they lost 20 million man-days. A total of 428 
enterprises completely stopped their work due to the shortage of 
raw materials and difficulties attributed to the sale of 
manufactured goods. This data was presented by the leader of 
the Federal Employment Service [FES] Fedor Prokopov on Thursday 
in Moscow. 
  According to the experts of the Federal Employment Service, 
possible "partial" unemployment in 1994 will constitute 5-8 Mn 
people and the number of workers at unprofitable enterprises 
could exceed 20 percent of the total number of the employed 
people in Russia. As many as 4.7 million people could be fired 
as a result of production reduction in 1994, and the amount of 
people who had no work or who lost it and are looking for a job 
could exceed 12 million people. 
  At the same time, experts believe that because of the 
discrepancy in supply and demand the unsatisfactory demand for 
working places could exceed 6 Mn people or 8.7 percent of the 
able bodied population in 1994. 
  Experts of the Federal Employment Service are convinced that 
unemployment will become the dominating problem in social and 
economic policy this year. To this effect they intend to 
undertake certain measures on the urgent introduction of 
compensation payments for approximately 970,000 people who are 
forced to work an incomplete working day or week or who are 
forced to take vacation without payment. 
  The Federal Employment Service forecasts that in 1994 it 
will 
be able to find work for 1.5 million people and 550,000 people 
will be granted an opportunity to re-train at the expense of the 
funds of the non-budget employment fund totalling 4 trillion 
rubles. The service is especially concerned about the situation 
of those leaving school, training colleges, and institutes; 
about 500,000 of them will be unemployed in 1994, including 
90,000 graduates from high schools. 
  The Federal Employment Service intends to preserve the 
quotas 
at existing enterprises to accept graduates from schools and 
institutes and to financially support employers who hire young 
people. The government's presidium agreed to the key provisions 
of the draft of the federal program on employment for 1994, 
however, it has returned it for revision to the specially formed 
governmental commission headed by Vice Premier Yuriy Yarov.

<F P=106> [Unattributed report under general heading: "The Aim Is To </F>
Stabilize Living Standard"] 
  [Text] Believing that in 1994 the problem of the 
population's employment will become the dominant one in 
socioeconomic policy, the Russian Federation Government intends 
to take active steps to curb unemployment, to create conditions 
for the expansion of employment in the nonstate sectors of the 
economy, and to ensure the protection of citizens forced into 
redundancy. That was the opinion reached yesterday by the 
participants in a session of the Russian Federation Government 
Presidium which approved as a whole the draft federal program 
for assisting the employment of the Russian federation 
population for 1994. 
  Presenting the draft program, Fedor Prokopov, leader of the 
Federal Employment Service, noted that its operation will extend 
mainly to able bodied citizens who have work but are at risk of 
losing it and to unemployed registered at the state employment 
service organs. 
  Providing information on the employment situation in 1994, 
Fedor Prokopov stated that one of the most characteristic 
features of the labor market will be the large army of partly 
unemployed people who have for a long time been under threat of 
dismissal. In February this year alone 4,300 enterprises had 
long production stoppages and 428 enterprises stopped 
completely. These enterprises have expanded the practice of 
leave at the administration's initiative. Thus the threat of 
concealed unemployment developing into open unemployment is 
intensified. Over the course of 1994 possible "partial" 
unemployment is assessed at 5-8 million people. 
  Fedor Prokopov also predicts that there will be an enhanced 
risk of citizens losing work -- the total number of layoffs of 
workers in 1994 will be 2.4-3.8 million. There will also be an 
increase in the supply of manpower on the labor market: The 
number of citizens who did not have work before or who lost it 
and are seeking work will be in excess of 12 million. As a 
result of the discrepancy between the supply and demand for 
manpower, the unsatisfied demand for jobs could be in excess of 
6.1 million people, or 8.7 percent of the economically active 
population. It is expected that the numerical strength of the 
unemployed officially registered at the unemployment service 
will reach 3 million by the end of 1994. 
  In the sphere of economic support for employment the 
government intends to curb the reduction of economically 
expedient and promising jobs and to promote the growth of 
investment activity, which creates new jobs, through the 
implementation of institutional transformations, selective 
structural policy, and the implementation of investment and 
other targeted programs. 
  Funds for the implementation of the federal program will be 
earmarked from the state employment fund and will total 4 
trillion rubles. After the draft's discussion at Viktor 
Chernomyrdin's suggestion it was decided to send the document 
for further work.

<F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS correspondent Igor Ivantsov] </F>
  [Text] Moscow April 21 TASS -- Some 100,000 billion rubles 
will be enlisted to finance investment projects in Russia. Such 
a chance will appear thanks to several measures taken by the 
Russian Government to step up investment activities, Russian 
Deputy Economics Minister Andrey Shapovalyants said here on 
Thursday. The deputy minister spoke at the international 
conference on oil and gas in Moscow, which was organised in 
connection with the international Neftegaz-94 exhibition. 
  As a result of these measures, the government plans to 
retain 
the volume of investments in 1994 at least at the level of last 
year. However, the share of federal investments will drop by 
15-20 per cent. 
  Shapovalyants called the emerging transition from state to 
project financing of all investment programmes a key measure 
capable of stepping up sharply investment processes. According 
to the deputy minister, this means the state's departure from 
monopoly participation in these programmes and transition to 
share investments. 
  The practice of funds' distribution which took place in the 
past, will be replaced with enlistment of various resources, 
apart from state funds, from local budgets as well as 
participation of private and foreign investments. Priority will 
be given to projects whose share of non-federal funds will total 
at least 50 per cent. 
  In the deputy minister's opinion, the decision to re-assess 
fixed industrial assets and their regular indexation will also 
help to boost the volume of investments. Apart from this, tax 
privileges will be given to any form of investments, including 
acquisition of securities and creation of authorised capital. 
The purpose-oriented enlistment of credits for investment will 
be also stimulated with tax privileges. In 1994, Shapovalyants 
continued, the government will preserve easy-term investment 
crediting for projects launched in 1992. The government is now 
reviewing the procedure of forming extra-budgetary funds. In 
future, they will be converted into insurance funds to protect 
investments from all types of risks. It is planned to establish 
such a fund at first in the gas industry and then to start their 
creation in other fuel and energy industries.

<F P=106> [Unattributed report "based on data from the Department for </F>
Price Analysis and Forecasting of the Economic Conditions Center 
Under the Russian Federation Government": "5-12 April: The 
Week's Prices. Train Tickets, and Everything Else Along With 
Them, Become More Expensive"] 
  [Text] The overall index of inflation for the week was 
102.7 percent, and since the beginning of the year it has 
increased 50 percent. From 5 through 12 April the inflation 
rate was 2.7 percent. 
  The increase in charges for paid consumer services continued 
to considerably outstrip price increases for food products and 
industrial goods. Food and nonfood product prices went up 1.2 
and 2.4 percent respectively. On the whole paid consumer 
services, mainly because of a twofold increase in the cost of 
railroad travel, became 18.4 percent more expensive. 
  The biggest increase in prices for goods and services was 
noted in the cities of the Urals, East Siberia, and the Far 
East. They changed least of all in the Northwest and 
Volga-Vyatka Economic Regions. 
  Food prices increased without any particular surges -- 
slowly 
but surely. Vegetables prices went up 5.1 percent and fruit 
prices went up 4.3 percent, which was not to the same extent as 
before but still more than other things. The price of salt 
continued to increase -- by 4.1 percent. Hulled and pasta 
product prices went up 2.7 percent, bread and flour product 
prices went up 2.3 percent, and the price of flour went up 2.1 
percent. Prices for dairy and fish products, butter and 
vegetable oil, eggs, and sugar changed by less than 1 percent 
during the week. Vodka became 1.6 percent cheaper than a week 
ago. The biggest price increases were for food products in the 
Volga (2.3 percent) and North Caucasus (2.2 percent) regions. 
In the North Caucasus region the biggest increases were for 
fruit and vegetable produce -- 12-14 percent -- and bread and 
flour products -- 3 percent. In the Volga region fruit prices 
went up by 11 percent and prices for dairy products and butter 
went up 5-8 percent. 
  As of 12 April the average cost of the basket of the 19 most 
important food products was 46,000 rubles [R] calculated on a 
monthly basis, an increase of 1.1 percent during the week and 50 
percent since the beginning of the year. This basket cost 
R44,400 at official trade prices and R57,500 at unofficial trade 
prices. The Far East Economic Region is still the most expensive 
in terms of the basket's cost -- R80,900. The Central Chernozem 
Economic Region has been the cheapest for two and a half months 
at R35,200. On 12 April the basket cost R50,000 in Moscow and 
R49,700 in St. Petersburg. Moscow is in 33d place and St. 
Petersburg is in 36th place in terms of high prices in the list 
of cities being monitored. 
  Industrial goods went up in price more than food products. 
Prices for certain types of fuel and medicine continued to 
increase -- by 8-10 percent during the week. The average price 
increase for wallpaper was 4 percent and that for knitted 
articles, synthetic detergents, and matches was 3 percent. 
Prices for tobacco products and cultural and domestic goods 
went up 1 percent. Besides fuel, in the past week knitted and 
sewn articles have become considerably more expensive in the Far 
East region. At 3.6 percent the increase in prices for 
industrial goods in the Central Chernozem region was higher than 
the average Russian increase. 
  For a long time now there has been a large gap between the 
maximum and minimum prices for identical goods in various 
Russian cities. Thus, since the beginning of the year there has 
been a fivefold to sixfold difference in footwear prices, a 
fivefold difference in tobacco product prices, and a threefold 
to fourfold difference in television prices.

<F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS correspondent Igor Ivantsov] </F>
  [Text] Moscow, April 21 (TASS) -- The effort to combat the 
inflation remains one of the chief tasks of the government in 
the current year. Only the stabilisation in finance will make 
it possible to intensify investment processes in the economy 
which are to become the basis for overcoming the economic 
crisis. Andrey Shapovalyants, the first deputy Russian 
economics minister, said this on Thursday, addressing the 
international conference on oil and gas. 
  A number of measures that the government plans to take in 
the 
financial area this year should arrest the growth of the pace of 
inflation, he noted. A rigid crediting policy and the course at 
limiting the expenditure of budget funds will stay. The issuing 
of credits should not increase beyond seven per cent. 
  The first three months of the current year showed the 
possibility of limiting the inflation growth to ten per cent a 
month, he said. There is every reason to believe that this index 
will remain valid till the end of the first six months. If 
considerable seasonal expenditure from the budget is avoided, 
the growth of inflation in 1994 may be cut by half as compared 
to 1993. 
  The government intends to preserve state regulation of 
prices 
of products of natural monopolies. This means a strict direct 
control over the level of prices and their change. The 
stabilisation of the financial situation will also be promoted 
by the introduction of control over the pay in the budget area, 
by the regulation of domestic and world prices through 
export-import tariffs and direct pricing of products of state 
enterprises that manufacture them on commission from the state.

<F P=106> [Reports by Aleksey Portanskiy and Sergey Krayukhin under </F>
the general heading: "In St. Petersburg Eurobank and `Dixon' 
Group Take Different Views of Our Country"] 
  [Text] St. Petersburg -- The third annual meeting of the 
board of governors of the European Bank for Reconstruction and 
Development (EBRD) was held in St. Petersburg's Tavricheskiy 
Palace on 18 and 19 April. According to its president, Jacques 
de Larosiere, the meeting was successful and its outcome 
positive. 
  One person I spoke with in the Tavricheskiy Palace was Boris 
Nemtsov, governor of Nizhniy Novgorod, where an EBRD pilot 
project to assist in the creation of small and medium-size 
businesses has been up and running for a long time. 
  "What the European Bank is aiming at above all," B. Nemtsov 
said, "is small production outfits and the services sphere, not 
trade in its present mass resale form. EBRD repesentatives 
carry out a most meticulous study of the partner, right down to 
his moral character and habits, before providing credit." 
  You could say that the EBRD's policy is not only tough (in 
terms of partner selection), but also one of high principles and 
integrity. The bank's own reputation is extremely important to 
it and, as we know, it is based on the results of what it does. 
When the EBRD okays participation in a project it means that it 
adds its own 35 percent to the one-fourth of the funds put up by 
the particular enterprise. The very fact that it is involved in 
the particular business then changes things radically: The 
quest for a third partner to make up the difference is no longer 
a problem when the EBRD is operating in tandem. 
  That, briefly, is the way the bank operates in Russia, and 
this mechanism really is working, although the volume of 
financing is not so great at the moment compared with the scale 
of activity in Nizhniy Novgorod Oblast. The experimental 
projects that are under way in Nizhniy Novgorod and Tula will 
soon spread to Tomsk, Premier Viktor Chernomyrdin confirmed in 
his speech in the Tavricheskiy Palace. 
  The Russian emphasis in the EBRD's activities markedly 
strengthened when Jacques de Larosiere became president, many 
financial experts acknowledge. The new bank chief has already 
managed to do a great deal to restore the EBRD's reputation and 
confidence in it, following the scandal resulting from 
overexpenditure on its own needs under his predecessor. 
[Portanskiy ends] 
  At the very same time (16-19 April) as the bank forum 
organized by the EBRD was taking plce with great pomp and 
ceremony in the Tavricheskiy Palace, on the other side of the 
road, in the famous Kikin Apartments, another international 
conference was in progress. The conference, organized by the 
European Investment Journal and the "Dixon" company, also 
attracted the attention of banking and business circles. 
  The idea of the "Dixon" firm's conference was simultaneously 
to present a number of St. Petersburg projects that had been 
selected for Western businessmen to look at and possibly invest 
in. The conpany's experts had carefully studied and analyzed 
more than 300 promising projects and finally selected around 20 
for this review. They inluded projects by the "Impuls," 
"Pozitron," and "Balt Elektro" science and production 
associations and a number of others. 
  The techniques and methods of assessment used by the "Dixon" 
firm differ from the EBRD's expert evaluations. The EBRD goes 
for large-scale projects, whereas the "Dixon" company's experts 
believe that, given the political and economic instability in 
Russia, Western businessmen are unlikely to put their capital at 
risk, therefore it is more realistic to expect them to 
participate in small but well planned and well costed projects. 
  Although Company President Mark Dixon criticized the EBRD 
and 
believes that its current leadership needs to overcome 
bureaucratic tendencies in its work and make more flexible use 
of the bank's potential for active involvement in the Russian 
market, he is prepared to participate in some EBRD projects. 
  Having studied the current situation, the "Dixon" company's 
experts arrived at the conclusion that around 10,000 Russian 
enterprises can lay claim to real investment support on the part 
of the West. At the same time, every year only around 500 out 
of approximately 50,000 promising projects find investors, so 
Western companies and firms need to step up their activities in 
this sphere, Mark Dixon stressed. 
  At the final press conference on the results of the meeting 
the "Dixon" company president announced that St. Petersburg City 
Hall officials had done their level best to prevent the 
conference from being held in the Kikin Apartments and even 
tried to wreck it. This is intolerable, Mark Dixon believes, in 
a civilized democratic society in which people should be free to 
express different views and opinions.

<F P=106> [Nikolay Myakinnik report: "Dual-Purpose Technology Helping </F>
to Produce Competitive Goods"] 
  [Text] Conversion 
  Having started on the new stage of conversion three to four 
years ago, America and Russia have since gone their separate 
ways. In 1989, according to the evidence of Viktor Glukhikh, 
chairman of the Russian Federation State Committee for the 
Defense Sectors of Industry, weapons formed 30 percent of the 
total U.S. export volume but by last year the figure had already 
risen to 60 percent. In our country, however, that indicator 
has fallen from 38 percent to 5 percent. A strange combination 
of processes, is it not? Who stands to gain from this? What is 
the best way to use market conditions to sustain the efficiency 
of the defense complex assuming indeed the task is not to wreck 
it entirely? 
  It seems that the program for the conversion of defense 
enterprises in the Moscow region is proving a good support for 
the corresponding all-Russia program. It could serve as model 
for it or even a prototype. This would seem natural after the 
examination of the question at a joint session of the Moscow 
Government and the Russian Federation State Committee for the 
Defense Sectors of Industry collegium which was held at Moscow 
city hall. 
  What is the basis of this proposition? Primarily the 
principled aspect of the matter. We are talking about close 
cooperation between interested departments at all stages of the 
formation and implementation of the program. There is a clear 
orientation emerging toward the economic efficiency and social 
importance of projects. The balanced nature of the sides' 
priorities is in evidence. It is proposed that national 
economic tasks be resolved not by destroying the defense 
enterprises but by making intelligent use of their potential. 
  The implementation of the "Conversion -- to the City" 
program 
will make it possible, among other things, to retain around 
15,000 jobs in the scientific sphere at defense enterprises and, 
consequently, around 65,000 jobs in production at large. All 
this will be accompanied by additional growth in the production 
of output. 
  The significance of the Moscow region's conversion program 
for the whole of Russia is also due to the fact that over half 
of the industrial potential and over one-third of the scientific 
potential of the entire defense complex is concentrated here. 
  The program's features include the extensive use of 
dual-purpose technologies in the design of military hardware and 
civilian output and the creation and modernization of capacities 
for the manufacture of competitive consumer goods. It is 
planned to resolve some major urban problems pertaining to fuel 
and energy, transport and communications, ecology, health care, 
and security. The agenda includes the flotation and 
privatization of defense enterprises, the active attraction of 
foreign investments in conversion, and the competitive selection 
and expert appraisal of projects. 
  Nevertheless, past mistakes meant that specialists had to 
focus their attention equally on ensuring the creation of 
conversion projects and on their implementation. It is the 
emphasis on part two which distinguishes the present program 
from its predecessors. Success will undoubtedly be predetermined 
by the implementation of mechanisms for supporting the promotion 
of projects, monitoring and prompt regulation, and informational 
and analytical support. 
  The "Conversion -- to the City" program includes over 1,000 
scientific research and experimental design projects. Funding 
for them amounts to 160 billion rubles [R]. There are 396 
projects envisaging starting industrial production of products 
and delivering them to the consumer. Financing amounting to 
R259.1 billion is guaranteed here. 
  The considerable increase in funding for defense projects 
compared with last year was received with satisfaction by the 
defense enterprises' general directors who took part in the work 
of the collegium. However, it is difficult to rebuild what has 
already been destroyed in the military-industrial complex, of 
course. But a thrifty attitude not only to the scientific, 
technical, and cadre potential of the military-industrial 
complex but also to the unique experience of the management of 
that complex, which effectively ensured its efficient work in 
the past, should help to guard against new losses. 
  Experience, incidentally, warns against haste in the 
implementation of the privatization program in the defense 
sphere. Taking that experience into account, Moscow Mayor Yuriy 
Luzhkov warned of the danger that state secrets will be in 
danger if the controlling block of shares in a defense 
enterprise is owned by people providing finance from abroad. At 
the very least the process of privatizing such enterprises must 
not be hurried. The best thing to do is to give the producers 
and scientific collectives the right to settle their own future 
themselves. Igor Fedorov, rector of the Bauman Moscow State 
Technical University, urged government organs to ensure that 
question of privatizing state higher educational institutions 
should not even be raised. 
  Despite the present depth of study of conversion problems, a 
depth achieved largely the hard way, there are still questions 
which need to be reviewed. Conversion, sometimes applied to 
technologies whose level is low compared with the potential of 
the military-industrial complex, is proceeding as if by horse 
and cart. But that cart can and must be like a tank, an 
aircraft, or a missile, where our technologies are unsurpassed. 
  At the same time it is necessary to bear in mind that the 
whole arms trade on which reliance is now being placed can at a 
later date turn out badly. Germany, for example, bought a 
modern tank from us and then took out dozens of patents on the 
basis of that tank. The fear is that in a few years' time we 
will have to pay for the right to use our own asset. But this 
suggests the way ahead. The intelligent organization of patents 
and licenses and the skillful protection of this country's 
inventions and know-how together with their subsequent sale in 
the market could produce more than the sale of any commodity. 
  Conversion is not a mountain stream which goes on flowing 
regardless of our will but a complex production, organizational, 
economic, and social process demanding skillful management. It 
would be best for Russia if this were done not from Capitol Hill 
(prompting us toward unilateral disarmament) but from a hill in 
Moscow.

<F P=106> [Vladislav Kuzmichev (NEGA) report in the "Privatization" </F>
column: "The Russian Stock Exchange President Charges Anatoliy 
Chubays. Formation of a New-Type Political Party Begins"] 
  [Text] Yesterday Igor Suvorov, president of the 
joint-stock company Russian Stock Exchange [RSE], held a press 
conference. According to the RSE president, the upcoming 
termination of the circulation of the voucher as a state 
security has provoked special activity by the State Property 
Committee [Goskomimushchestvo], in the person of Anatoliy 
Chubays who, while the privatization program has virtually 
collapsed, is trying to regain the initiative from the Economy 
Ministry and usurp the power to regulate the securities market 
through the infrastructure created by Goskomimushchestvo. 
  The seminar for stock market makers, to be convened on 23 
and 
24 April by the Securities and Stock Exchange Commission under 
the Russian Federation president, in Suvorov's opinion, is in 
fact the beginning of the formation of a new type of political 
party. It is sponsored by the state itself as represented by 
the ministries and departments which have discredited themselves 
in the sphere of privatization. 
  The statement also noted that Mr. Chubays is trying to 
resolve the problem of the enterprise directors corps not on an 
economic basis but by regimenting its activity and assuming the 
function of regulating investment flows. 
  According to the RSE president, the approach that is being 
imposed objectively leads to crime because it envisions a 
multi-stage scenario as a result of which the capital market 
will move from an organized to a cash basis [ot organizovannogo 
k nalichnomy], which corresponds to the interests of shadow 
structures.

<F P=106> [Viktor Litovkin report: "Russia's Missile Guard Increased </F>
by Nine Topols"] 
  [Text] Yoshkar-Ola-Moscow -- This was unprecedented. The 
until recently top-secret strategic missile regiment belonging 
to the Kiev-Zhitomir Order of Kutuzov Missile Division deployed 
in Yoshkar-Ola inaugurated the performance of alert duty in the 
presence of Mariy-El Republic President Vladislav Zotin and 
before the gaze of television journalists, pressmen, and 
photographers, among whom were IZVESTIYA special correspondents. 
  The regiment comprises nine RS-12M Topol road-mobile 
delivery 
vehicles. Journalists were shown the holy of holies -- the 
alert forces' fixed command post which controls the launch of 
missiles, the launch area equipment, its protection and defense 
system, and the guard quarters where the missilemen perform 
their alert duty -- and had all the questions that interest us, 
including where the missiles are targeted, answered. 
  Before giving you that answer I would inform you that the 
regiment was assembled out of different pieces, as it were. Its 
officer backbone is made up of men who served in the missile 
unit belonging to the 43d Vinnitsa Army stationed in the 
settlement of Lebedin, Suma Oblast, Ukraine. The regiment was 
once equipped with SS-20 Pioneer intermediate-range missiles, 
which were destroyed some years ago under the Treaty on 
Intermediate-Range and Shorter-Range Missiles. The new 
equipment was received last August from the city of Postava, 
Belorussia [Belorus], from the Topol strategic missile division 
which was disbanded there and withdrawn from the republic's 
territory. 
  These systems replaced some of the RS-12 (SS-13 according to 
the U.S. classification system) fixed-site missiles with which 
the Yoshkar-Ola division is equipped. Officer retraining took 
six months, and they entered on alert duty on their new systems 
on 19 April. 
  It is also interesting that the regiment disbanded in 
Ukraine 
was created in Akhtyrka in 1655. It was the oldest military 
unit in Russia and had taken part in the Battle of Poltava. By 
edict of Empress Elizabeth the regiment was named the Akhtyrka 
Hussars. It was commanded at the battle of Borodino by General 
Denis Davydov, who took it as far as Paris. Lermontov and 
Alyabyev served there... 
  Now its colors and combat decorations, including the Orders 
of the Red Banner, Kutuzov, and Bogdan Khmelnistskiy are kept in 
the Central Museum of the Armed Forces. 
  The missile officers, I was told by assistant commander 
Lieutenant Colonel Vitaliy Lezhanin, have asked the Defense 
Ministry leadership to restore the memorabilia and the honorary 
title to them, but only time will tell whether the General Staff 
will heed them. In the opinion of those who perform alert duty 
today, they have every right. 
  Colonel Vladimir Kashkin, the commander of the regiment, 
told 
me that he doesn't know what his missiles are targeted on. Only 
the General Staff has such information. But division commander 
Major General Musa Tsegoyev clarified the position, stating that 
under the strategic missile agreement with the United States, 
strategic missiles have "zero" targeting and that their mission 
will only be programmed at a time of threat. They maintain 
watch to deter any potential aggressor so that never comes to 
pass. 
  The missilemen's unprecedented openness in inviting 
journalists to see the regiment's entry on alert duty is, in my 
view, not just a desire on their part to report gradually on the 
execution of their international commitments. There is another 
reason for this too. As is well known, the former Russian 
Supreme Soviet did not ratify START, but the reequipping of the 
missile division in Yoshkar-Ola and the disbandment of strategic 
regiments in Belorussia and Ukraine constitute the 
implementation of that treaty. 
  Russia will keep its word, although the parliamentarians 
have 
not turned this word into law.

<F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS correspondent Yuriy Grachev] </F>
  [Text] Vladivostok, 22 Apr (ITAR-TASS) -- Following an item 
published in TOKYO SHIMBUN newspaper, Pacific Fleet commander 
Admiral Georgiy Gurinov denied reports about the danger of 
radiation from broken-down Russian submarines. "Clearly, certain 
circles in Japan have felt the need to whip up passions over the 
problems involved in burying radioactive waste," the admiral 
declared in an interview with an ITAR-TASS correspondent after 
hearing of a recent item in the Japanese newspaper claiming that 
the Pacific Fleet is keeping four nuclear submarines laid up "in 
an extremely dangerous state, since the nuclear fuel has not 
been removed from them owing to accidents and faults that 
occurred during their activities as part of the Russian Pacific 
Fleet." 
  We thank the Japanese paper, the admiral remarked, not 
without irony, for displaying its concern for Russian citizens. 
But Japan has enough problems of its own. It too discharges 
liquid radioactive waste into the sea. Yet no one creates any 
particular fuss about it on the islands. 
  But it is not only our neighbors, Georgiy Gurinov said, but 
also specialists in the United States, France, Britain, and 
other developed countries who are struggling, so far 
unsuccessfully, to solve the problem of what to do with the 
harmful waste. Like us, they too either discharge it into the 
sea or bury it in the ground. 
  As for the "four submarines", the admiral commented, first 
the figure is exaggerated, and second they are being reliably 
monitored and constitute no danger to the inhabitants of the 
Primorye and even less to the Japanese. The vessels have been 
withdrawn from the Pacific Fleet's complement of vessels, the 
reactors are idle, and, in time, they will be broken up. 
  The whipping up of passions, Georgiy Gurinov stressed, is a 
tried and tested device of some politicians. In order to 
achieve their aims, they even fail to notice the obvious fact 
that the recent tripartite expedition of the scientific research 
vessel Okean, which toured the radioactive waste dumping sites, 
convinced world opinion that the radioactive background in the 
Sea of Japan is within normal limits. 
  "I can state authoritatively," the Pacific Fleet commander 
assured the correspondent, "that there is no danger to anyone 
from the submarines in question, and, if no means of processing 
the radioactive waste on shore is found, life itself will force 
us to discharge it into the sea again."

  [Text] As has become known from informed sources, Russia's 
Foreign Ministry and the Ministry of Environmental Protection 
and Natural Resources have forwarded to Premier Viktor 
Chernomyrdin a joint statement speaking of the need to resolve 
as soon as possible the problem of liquid radioactive waste in 
the Far East. In order to prevent yet more radioactive dumping 
in the Far Eastern seas, the document suggests that radioactive 
waste processing units be urgently manufactured and delivered to 
the Far East. It is suggested that 5 billion rubles from the 
government's reserve fund be set aside to support these and 
other urgent measures.

<F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS correspondent Anatoliy Yurkin] </F>
  [Text] Moscow April 22 TASS -- "Russia has absolutely 
unique technologies for the complex reprocessing of chemical 
warfare agents and nuclear wastes, which have no match in the 
world," member of the Engineering Academy Mikhail Sviderskiy 
said on Thursday, addressing a plenary meeting of the second 
international conference for chemical disarmament -- "Moskon-94". 
  According to Sviderskiy, Russian scientists have developed 
and experimentally tested several production cycles for the 
complex reprocessing of chemical warfare agents and nuclear 
wastes. This allowed them to obtain new materials with quite 
unusual characteristics which, in the opinion of the expert, may 
be used in 21st-century technologies. 
  Sviderskiy said that the simultaneous reprocessing of 
chemical warfare agents and nuclear wastes would allow 
scientists not only to obtain materials with unique properties, 
but also to utilise huge quantities of depleted uranium 
accumulating on the planet. In order to process it into 
valuable products, Sviderskiy believes, "we need an 
international programme involving all the advanced countries. 
Excessive amounts of nuclear wastes have been accumulated in the 
United States, France, Britain, Germany, and also Russia. They 
are just as dangerous for the planet's ecology as the existing 
stockpiles of chemical warfare agents. 
  ITAR-TASS was told by Academician Valentin Fedorov, who is 
also attending the conference, that chemical disarmament should 
not only make up for the spendings made on the production of 
chemical warfare agents, but should also yield profits to the 
Russian treasury. In his opinion, only the reprocessing of 
lewisite into extra-pure arsenic will yield Russia profits 
running into many billions and will provide top-quality raw 
materials for new technologies in the most advanced sectors of 
industry. "We must not forget," the scientist stressed, "that 
Georgia, our traditional supplier of arsenic, has stopped 
selling it to Russia. In the meantime, the need for pure 
materials of this group is growing. For instance, the United 
States will need more than 100 tonnes of extra-pure arsenic by 
the end of this century only for its electronic industry. Other 
countries are also badly in need of arsenic. 
  Chemical disarmament, based on technologies proposed by 
Russian scientists, Fedorov believes, meet the national 
interests of Russia. "We must rely on our own forces, and we 
have no right to wait for somebody else to resolve our Russian 
problems," he stated.

<F P=106> [Andrey Vaganov report under the Forum" rubric: "Chemical </F>
Arms Should be Destroyed. The Whole Question Is How, Where, 
When?"] 
  [Text] The International Conference on Chemical 
Disarmament is winding up its work in Moscow today. Its 
organizers are the Committee for Conventional Problems of 
Chemical and Biological Weapons under the Russian Federation 
president, and the Russian Academy of Sciences. This is the 
second such international meeting since Russia signed the 
convention banning chemical weapons in Paris a little more than 
a year ago. As of today the convention has been ratified by 
five states -- Sweden, Norway, Fiji, Mauritius, and the 
Seychelles. In order to go into effect the convention should be 
ratified by at least 65 states (this is expected to happen this 
summer). 
  In the words of Academician Anatoliy Kuntsevich, who spoke 
at 
the conference and who until recently chaired the Committee for 
Conventional Problems, it was clear right from the start that 
implementation of the convention posed Russia a number of 
difficulties, primarily economic ones. Russia, nevertheless, 
intends precisely to act on its obligations. Our country's 
withdrawal from the convention would in fact mean scrapping the 
convention, with tragic consequences for all humanity. 
  Academician Kuntsevich also stated for the first time that 
Russia, without waiting for the convention to go into force, had 
already started unilaterally converting to other uses the 
available technical potential for the production of chemical 
weapons (this in particular true about the facilities in 
Volgograd Oblast). The equipment has been partially destroyed 
and scrapped at factories producing the saman and sorin toxic 
agents. 
  The keynote of many reports at the conference was the need 
to 
reach a public and federal accord on the destruction of chemical 
weapons in Russia.

<F P=106> [Vladimir Kartashkov report: "Marriages of Convenience. </F>
Special Services Reach Agreement"] 
  [Text] The Russian president's Security Service and the 
Federal Counterintelligence Service [FCS] signed an agreement on 
cooperation 20 April. 
  To all appearances, the agreement is a provisional measure. 
Cooperation between Russian secret services has always been 
based on oral agreements between "cloak and dagger knights," 
which has often caused conflicts over trifles. Despite all 
reorganizations, the FCS, which was proclaimed the legal 
successor to the Russian Security Ministry, still has the most 
extensive logistic base, which any former KGB department would 
be eager to use. As a matter of fact, the FCS budget includes 
money for logistic support, medical service, and training for 
all other special services. 
  First of all, the Security Service and the FCS agreed to 
cooperate and to exchange information on terrorism "instigated 
and carried out by foreign special services" and "aimed against 
the Russian Federation president and the state's security." And 
also on "unconventional forms of operations...by foreign special 
services" (the conventional forms include recruitment and 
technical intelligence, while the unconventional ones are 
exemplified by the hullabaloo over "red mercury"). To this end, 
the Security Service and the FCS undertook certain obligations. 
The FCS will help the presidential security service to screen 
those suspected of conspiring to carry out terrorist acts and to 
organize certain operational-technical (bugging, hidden video 
filming) and operational-search measures. In addition, the FCS 
will take part in the search for "means of technical penetration 
into Security Service facilities" and help the Security Service 
train its personnel in its educational and training 
institutions. The Security Service will be able to use the FCS 
library and computerized data bases free of charge. 
  The Security Service's obligations are much more modest -- 
first of all it must inform the FCS about persons who are 
reported to harbor "criminal intentions." A separate paragraph 
stipulates that when receiving compromising information about 
any FCS member the Security Service is obliged to pass this 
information to Lubyanka. The FCS, however, does not have to hand 
over to the Security Service information about presidential 
bodyguards suspected of committing a crime, because the Chekists 
deal with corrupt officials ex officio. 
  The agreement is not limited in time, but any of the 
contracting parties may abrogate it by sending a written notice. 
This confirms that the creation of a community of Russian 
special services under the president's aegis is still possible. 
For the time being, however, the special services prefer to 
conclude agreements between themselves. A week ago, the FCS 
signed a similar agreement on cooperation with the Russian 
Foreign Intelligence Service.

  [Text] Murmansk April 21 TASS -- "If Russia loses her naval 
power, she will lose her status as a great power as well. Our 
navy will, as earlier, serve as the watch-dog of the country", 
first deputy commander-in-chief of Russia's Navy Admiral Igor 
Kasatonov said on Thursday. 
  The admiral, who arrived in Murmansk to participate in the 
northern fleet's military maneuvers, heads the state commission 
on the preparation for the 300-year anniversary of the Russian 
fleet. He emphasised that the Russian fleet was created by the 
whole country, and so the celebration of its anniversary will be 
not a departmental, but a nation-wide event. 
  Speaking about the military readiness of the country's naval 
forces, Admiral Kasatonov said, "the results of the first stage 
of battle training are now being analyzed on all the fleets. On 
the whole, I am satisfied with them. But there are some things 
which need to be worked upon. In particular, we need to give 
our sailors more time on the open sea. I think we will be able 
to correct that problem during the summer", he said.

<F P=106> [Report by Colonel Robert Bykov in the "Version" column: </F>
"`Mobile Forces' in Russia. An Organization and Control Option"] 
  [Text] The deteriorating material and spiritual situation 
of the Russian people is constantly threatening a sharp social 
protest by the masses in various forms, including an explosion. 
  The authorities need a counterbalance. The OMON [Special 
Purpose Police Force], the Spetsnaz [Special Forces], Internal 
Affairs Ministry units -- these are like a sand damn against a 
big river: effective for a short period and with small-scale 
developments. 
  A more reliable barrier is needed, a new defense ring. This 
ring could be so-called "mobile forces," to whose creation 
Russian Defense Minister Pavel Grachev is devoting much time and 
effort these days. 
  The 3-4 October 1993 events showed that the action against 
the White House was actively supported only by a few prominent 
generals. At the same time the General Staff -- apparently owing 
to its unreliability -- was disconnected from lines of 
communication with the city and troops for the entire period of 
crisis. 
  It is known that an overwhelming majority of chief 
commanders 
and commanders at the Defense Ministry Collegium meeting did not 
express their support for plans to use tanks to storm a civilian 
installation. It can be assumed that many Russian officers in 
the provinces, who have not received their monetary allowances 
and food rations for two to three months, living with their 
families in dismal apartments or wooden barracks, hardly 
sympathized with those storming the White House. In the end the 
victors themselves admitted that in October everything "was 
hanging by a thread." 
  Was this not a reason why the possibility of employing armed 
forces to accomplish internal missions was included in Russia's 
new military doctrine? The concrete manifestation of this 
provision can be seen in the structure and methods of organizing 
the "mobile forces." 
  Nearly all combat-ready general-purpose divisions (brigades) 
can be formed into a single fist directly subordinated to the 
Russian president and defense minister. A special command and 
control post is set up with independent communication and 
automated control systems. (It is a good thing that they were 
designed way back under the direction of the General Staff's 8th 
Main Operations Directorate within the Warsaw Pact Joint Armed 
Forces structure). The command and control post can well be 
accommodated at the Moscow Military District's Signal Brigade. 
In the Moscow area of Sokolniki there is a ready-made complex 
of installations fit to station such a post. A "toy" of the 
"nuclear briefcase" kind could be made for President Yeltsin, 
creating the illusion of administering division command. 
  Airborne divisions will possibly be combined with military 
transport aviation divisions (regiments); airborne assault 
brigades (regiments), with helicopter units; marines, with 
amphibious ships. All effectively combat-ready motorized 
infantry divisions (currently one to two in a military district) 
will be transferred from district operational command, to be 
subsequently included into the "mobile forces." And of all this 
will be commanded by a single, independent operational 
directorate. 
  The entire "mobile force" structure will have uniform 
command 
and control signals corresponding to the main troop combat 
employment orders. In accordance with manuals and combat 
regulations (i.e., under Russian Federation laws), their 
execution is compulsory for all units and formations. 
  At any moment, in any region of the country, in any branch 
of 
the Russian Federation Armed Forces, the situation will be under 
the control of the person standing on top of the command and 
control pyramid.

  [Text] According to BELAPAN, Colonel General Pavel 
Kazlowski, Belarusian defense minister, signed an order 
activating on 25 April the statute defining conditions for 
contract service by privates, sergeants, sailors, and master 
sergeants in the Belarusian Armed Forces. Thus, all Belarusian 
citizens under 35 years of age who have already been on active 
military service and are still subject to call-up, can sign a 
contract with the Defense Ministry for two years and serve in 
the Army according to their military or civilian profession. 
The same applies to privates and sergeants who are currently 
awaiting transfer to the reserves. Experts estimate that the 
monthly salary of a contract serviceman this April will be about 
390,000 rubles, while a sergeant will make around 509,000 
Belarusian hares.

<F P=106> [Interview with Nikolay Ivanovich Cherginets, chairman of </F>
the Committee for Social Protection of Servicemen, by Nikolay 
Matukovskiy; place and date not given: "Soldier's Last Stand"] 
  [Excerpts] Nikolay Ivanovich Cherginets, chairman of the 
Committee for Social Protection of Servicemen -- privates and 
ranking officers of the bodies of the Ministry of Internal 
Affairs, veterans of foreign wars who were transferred to the 
reserves (or retired), and members of their families -- within 
the Belarusian Cabinet of Ministers has answered questions from 
RESPUBLIKA columnist Nikolay Matukovskiy. 
  [Matukovskiy] Nikolay Ivanovich, how many people do you 
oversee? 
  [Cherginets] One in every ten citizens of the Republic. 
  [Matukovskiy] Are you exaggerating? 
  [Cherginets] Rather minimizing, let us calculate.... The 
current strength of the Belarusian Armed Forces is 260,000, 
while the required strength should be 90,000 or even 60,000. 
Therefore, 170,000 servicemen should be transferred to the 
reserves. Next, multiply this figure by three (a husband, a 
wife, and a minimum of one child). The majority of them have no 
civilian professions, many of them have no housing, they will 
have to leave their garrisons. Where will they go? With what 
will they deal? Reaching age 45 is not the end of their lives; 
this is the most productive age. It is inhumane and unbecoming 
of our state. This is how I understand the reduction of the 
Armed Forces. I wish that those deputies who demand that the 
Armed Forces be instantaneously reduced, understood this 
situation. 
  However, this is our tomorrow, let us speak about our today, 
which is no easier. Thousands of Belarusians, who are 
performing their military service in various CIS regions, would 
like to return to Belarus. Many of them came back, but we have 
to absorb 8,684 servicemen including 7,453 officers. As we put 
it, 40,000 servicemen "are subject to dislocation" and we have 
to bring back 1,000 servicemen from "hot spots...." At the same 
time, we have 9,000 servicemen -- retired or transferred to the 
reserves -- who lack proper housing; a third of them live in 
Minsk alone. Yes, they have some sort of roof over their heads, 
but can we call this housing if people are sleeping in bunk beds? 
  Our Republic had 251,845 soldiers fight in World War II, and 
74,990 out of them are disabled. With every passing day their 
ranks are reduced. In addition, there are tens of thousands of 
families who lost their husbands or sons. In a word, everywhere 
there are fresh war wounds.... 
  [Matukovskiy] However, the most bleeding wound is 
Afghanistan. 
  [Cherginets] Of course. This is our ever-lasting pain. Last 
year, 30 Afghan war veterans committed suicide, more than 100 
were imprisoned. Many of them became drug addicts, 
alcoholics.... These people became outcasts. They are on the 
edge.... [passage omitted] 
  [Matukovskiy] Nikolay Ivanovich, they usually say that some 
30,000 foreign war veterans live in Belarus. Are we ashamed to 
call them Afghan war veterans? 
  [Cherginets] No, we are not ashamed. The point is that our 
countrymen fought not only in Afghanistan, but also in Algeria, 
Angola, Vietnam, Egypt, Yemen, China, North Korea, Syria, 
Mozambique, Ethiopia -- all in all, in 14 states! One 
Belarusian even fought in the Seychelles! All in all, 30,577 
Belarusians have fought on foreign soil. Fortunately, most of 
them survived.... [passage omitted]

<F P=106> [Report by Vyacheslav Khodosovskiy: "Treaty Signed, </F>
Different Monetary Systems Remain In Place"] 
  [Text] Minsk -- The text of the treaty on the unification 
of the Belorussian [Belarusian] and Russian monetary systems, 
signed in Moscow, contains a number of problems which were not 
resolved during the talks and which could have an adverse effect 
on the future of the Belorussian economy. So said Stanislav 
Bogdankevich, chairman of the National Bank of Belorussia 
[Belarus], in an interview with a RIA-NOVOSTI correspondent. 
  "The rate of exchange for `hares' [popular term for 
Belarusian currency] and rubles has not yet been agreed," S. 
Bogdankevich said. "Belorussia would like it set at purchasing 
power parity for the Russian and Belorussian monetary units plus 
the market cross-rate for these currencies against the U.S. 
dollar. The ratio then would be 3:1. But according to the 
Russian `arithmetic mean' method, the rate would be seven 
`hares' to the ruble." S. Bogdankevich believes this option 
would be lethal for the Belorussian economy, because it would 
then be necessary to reduce real pay accordingly, so that the 
prime cost of products did not rise. 
  Stanislav Bogdankevic continues to insist on the amendment 
of 
Article 5 of the treaty, whereby all Belorussian assets and 
liabilities are to be transferred to the Central Bank of Russia 
and the National Bank of Belorussia is to be abolished, becoming 
a branch of the Central Bank. The chief of the National Bank of 
Belorussia believes that questions of coordination of the 
issuing of money, the budget deficit, credit rates, and the rest 
can be decided on agreement between the two sovereign banks. At 
the same time, Stanislav Bogdankevich was positive about the 
agreement that had been reached on lifting customs barriers 
between the two countries. "As a result of this point," he 
said, "our states will now be spared lengthy talk about who owes 
whom more and they will bring their trade balances closer 
together." 
  As the text of the document says, the treaty will come into 
force "on the date of the final notice by the contracting 
parties to one another of the implementation of the intrastate 
procedures necessary for its coming into force...." What this 
implies for Belorussia is approval of changes to the Belorussian 
Constitution by an extraordinary session of the Supreme Soviet 
before the end of April. S. Bogdankevich's theory is that the 
requisite two-thirds parliamentary majority will not be 
obtained, so the question of unifying the monetary systems will 
be postponed until a referendum. At the same time, the chief of 
the National Bank of Belorussia believes that the treaty will 
not actually be implemented by Russia until the outcome of the 
presidential election in Belorussia is known. And even after 
the election certain treaty provisions may not come into force 
before next January. This applies, in particular, to the 
extension to Belorussia of Russian domestic prices of energy 
sources and basic types of products from Russian enterprises. 
Otherwise, Russian enterprises could find themselves on the 
verge of collapse.

<F P=106> [Interview with Mikhail Hardyka, senior investigator for </F>
cases of special importance at the office of attorney general, 
by Ivan Herasyuk; place and date not given: "Nobody Will Be 
Made Accountable"] 
  [Text] [Herasyuk] Perhaps we should have waited until the 
investigation on the Chernobyl case would be closed definitely, 
but certain media -- I do not know who inspired them -- have 
prematurely accused the attorney general's office of inactivity 
and even prejudice. Therefore, Mikhail Uladzimiravich, the 
public should learn about the results of your work, to prevent 
various speculations. 
  [Hardyka] As everybody knows, in June 1991, the Supreme 
Soviet of the then Belarusian Soviet Socialist Republic [BSSR] 
requested the office of attorney general to conduct a legal 
assessment of activities of certain Belarusian officials and 
other people responsible for resolving issues connected with the 
catastrophe at the Chernobyl nuclear power plant. Moreover, the 
request was formulated by certain deputies in the following way: 
It is necessary to immediately find the officials who are 
guilty and put them behind bars. In a law-governed state this 
is unacceptable however. It is necessary to determine the 
concrete fault of every single man, as well as to point out 
which article of which law has been violated. A special 
investigating team was therefore set up, and I was requested to 
head it. For more than three years, we have been studying the 
legislative basis existing at that time concerning radiation 
safety, and we have collected several thousand witnesses' 
testimonies and experts' reports. The materials have been 
gathered in almost 150 bulky volumes. All this had to be 
interpreted and systemized, and we have had to provide a legal 
assessment of activities of every official responsible for 
making specific decisions. Without exaggeration, I can say that 
it has been a monumental task. 
  [Herasyuk] The work has currently entered its final stage. 
You have resolved to close the criminal case.... 
  [Hardyka] This has been inevitable, particularly, after the 
collapse of the USSR. Since many people became citizens of 
other countries, it has been very difficult to continue the 
investigation. Additionally, official documents of ministries 
which were located in Moscow at that time could not be regarded 
as a legal basis of the new independent Republic of Belarus. Of 
course, our conclusions may disappoint many people, since 
nobody, except for well-known employees of the plant, has been 
imprisoned. Nevertheless, our work has not been worthless. We 
know precisely today what laws we should have, so people who 
break the law do not remain unpunished. 
  [Herasyuk] What has been disclosed by the investigation? 
  [Hardyka] First of all, I would like to point out that we 
did not begin in an empty space. The Office of the USSR 
Attorney General had opened a criminal case prior to ours. 
Director Brukhanov, chief engineer Famin, his deputy Dyatlov, 
shift supervisor Rogozhyn, and Laushkin, chief of the Nuclear 
Power Industry Inspectorate, had already been brought to 
account. The criminal investigation against the people 
responsible for errors in the reactor's design and workers of 
the Ukrainian Civil Defense, who failed to report the accident 
in time, had been suspended by the Ukrainian Office of Attorney 
General. 
  On 4 May 1986, the Communist Party of Belarus [KPB] Central 
Committee Bureau and the BSSR Cabinet of Ministers established 
the Committee for Liquidating the Aftermath of the Chernobyl 
Nuclear Power Plant Catastrophe. The committee included 
Dzemyantsey, Khusaynaw, [Belarusian Prime Minister] Kebich, and 
other officials. Practical recommendations were examined by a 
scientific-technical council comprised of such well-known 
scientists as Nikitchanka, Pyatrayew, and [former Belarusian 
Supreme Soviet Chairman] Shushkevich. Operational headquarters 
were opened in Homel and Mahilyow Oblasts. Yet, everything was 
coordinated by an operational group of the CPSU Central 
Committee Political Bureau. 
  M. Ryzhkov, former chairman of the USSR Cabinet of 
Ministers, 
while being interrogated as a witness, said that "taking into 
account the knowledge existing at that time, the optimal way of 
liquidating the aftermath of the catastrophe was chosen. The 
operational group examined issues and adopted appropriate 
decisions. The adopted decisions were correct." 
  M. Kavalyow, former commander of the Civil Defense and 
chairman of the BSSR Cabinet of Ministers, said the following: 
"I learned about the explosion at the Chernobyl nuclear power 
plant from Hryshahin, chief of the BSSR Civil Defense General 
Headquarters. He did not receive any reports from Moscow or 
Kiev. At the beginning, we did not have complete data about the 
radiation level, nor did we know all the details of the 
catastrophe. Our equipment was able to detect only high levels 
of radiation. There were no accurate dosimeters in Belarus at 
that time. Only after the accident, Moscow allocated money to 
purchase such equipment abroad." 
  First Rank Captain D. Zhukowski, former chief of the Homel 
Oblast Civil Defense Headquarters, emphasized that "he was 
unable to learn about complete forecasts for radioactive 
pollution in Homel Oblast from the Chernobyl nuclear power plant 
civil defense or the Kiev Oblast Administration." 
  This was confirmed by the testimony of A. Kamay, former 
secretary of the KPB Homel Oblast Committee: "The Kiev Oblast 
Civil Defense failed to provide appropriate information.... I 
have received fragmentary information about the accident from 
the local leadership on 27 April 1986." 
  USSR Deputy Health Minister noted that "the government 
should 
have informed the people about radioactive contamination in the 
entire country and in separate regions. This was a political 
step.... Local authorities were unable to provide information 
about the accident and its aftermath. At the beginning, all 
reports on the accident were considered secret...." 
  [Herasyuk] In my opinion, Gorbachev should have been the 
first one to be brought to account. He found the courage to 
mention something about the accident only two weeks after it 
happened. Since the boss kept silent, his subordinates did not 
rush to inform the people. Neither Gorbachev nor Ryzhkov, 
however, were punished.... 
  [Hardyka] As the investigation has revealed, they, as well 
as the leadership of our country, did not violate any laws. We 
can only speak about moral accountability here, but this is a 
personal matter. The Office of Attorney General must operate 
strictly within judicial categories. Thus, the case has been 
dismissed, because of the lack of elements of crime in 
activities of the people who were responsible for making 
important decisions during the days following the Chernobyl 
accident.

of Illness and Suffering"] 
  [Text] Minsk -- An international congress on "the World 
After Chernobyl" has opened in Minsk; it will sum up the latest 
scientific data from the countries afflicted by the catastrophe 
and will discuss tactics for overcoming its consequences. 
  The congress, which has attracted representatives from more 
than 20 countries of the CIS and beyond, will give priority 
attention to the situation in Belorussia [Belarus], which 
suffered most as a result of the explosion at the Chernobyl 
Nuclear Electric Power Station. Almost 1.9 million people live 
in the contaminated regions today -- virtually one in five of 
the Republic's inhabitants; the incidence of dangerous illnesses 
is constantly increasing.

  [Text] The Belarusian Party of Labor [BPP] Council has 
issued a statement devoted to the eighth anniversary of the 
catastrophe at the Chernobyl nuclear power plant. It is 
becoming increasingly clear that most of the decisions adopted 
and promises made on this issue by the Republic's leadership 
have not been implemented, the statement said. In the words of 
its authors, many Supreme Soviet deputies, who pledged some time 
ago to free Belarusians of the Chernobyl misery, and the 
government failed to protect people from the Chernobyl radiation 
and drove the people into an economic Chernobyl, bringing them 
to the brink of annihilation. The party council considers it 
inadmissible that the authorities attempt to revise legal acts 
and decisions formerly adopted regarding the protection of 
people from the Chernobyl catastrophe and the level of social 
benefits. The BPP Council calls on all progressive forces to 
rally their efforts aimed at the survival and health of the 
Belarusian people on 26 April, the day of commemoration of the 
Chernobyl tragedy.

  [Text] The absolute majority of signatories are ready to 
put their signatures under the agreement on civic accord. This 
opinion was voiced by Ivan Rybkin, speaker of the Federal 
Assembly's lower chamber, in a conversation with journalists 
after the meeting between Russian president and leaders of the 
State Duma factions. 
  He assessed the president's decision to cancel decree No 
1590 
as a move of conciliation (the participants of the meeting were 
informed about this during the meeting). As it is known, "a 
black list" of former deputies of the Supreme Soviet disbanded 
by the presidential decree No 1400 due to their participation in 
the October events in Moscow was compiled on the basis of this 
decree. 
  In Rybkin's words, they have reached an agreement that all 
leaders of the State Duma factions will be granted an 
opportunity to express their point of view regarding the 
agreement on civic accord over the first channel of the 
Ostankino TV company. 
  While informing the State Duma deputies on the results of 
the 
meeting, Rybkin reported that on April 25 the Federation Council 
should determine whether it would commission Chairman of the 
Federation Council Vladimir Shumeyko to sign the document along 
with the constituent members or whether it would be enough if 
the constituent members put their signatures under this document. 
  Aleksandr Piskunov (New Regional Policy group) reported that 
there are already 140 constituent members ready to sign this 
agreement, including all constituent members of the Russian 
Federation. As he said, it would take two days to revise the 
document. 
  Yevgeniy Novikov, member of the working group in charge for 
the preparation of the document (Party of Russian Unity and 
Concord faction) reported that the president assessed the 
question on possible political persecution of those who would 
not sign the agreement on civic accord as "absolute nonsense." 
In his words, Yeltsin declared that he would not change his 
attitude to any parties if they do not sign this document. 
  Sergey Shakhray, leader of the Party of Russian Unity and 
Concord, believes that April 28, the day of signing, is "the 
beginning of a difficult, long, and tiring process in the search 
for an accord." 
  Shakhray believes that if the Duma votes against the singing 
of this document this will be unnatural because the Duma itself 
started this process by adopting the memorandum on accord on 
February 23. In addition, when the president, the government, 
the constituent members, and trade unions sign this document, 
the absence of the State Duma could lead "to self-isolation of 
the chamber." 
  Nikolay Travkin, leader of the Democratic Party of Russia, 
believes that signing would take place and "the absolute 
majority" would sign the agreement. In his opinion, if there is 
at least one percent of something which can reconcile the 
society, it should be used." 
  Leader of the Liberal Democratic Party of Russian Vladimir 
Zhirinovskiy reported to journalists that his faction would 
consider the issue at its sitting scheduled for April 26. At 
the same time he did not declare that he does not intend to sign 
this document because, as he said, signing is quite possible "as 
a compromise for further movement forward." He reported that he 
had presented his point of view regarding the concept of the 
country's development and agreed to privately meet with the 
president. 
  "If several opposition factions do not sign this agreement 
it 
will be a norm of democratic life," Zhirinovsky is convinced. 
  The Yabloko faction definitely declared its refusal to sign 
the document at the meeting with the president. The faction's 
representative Vyacheslav Shestakovskiy underlined that the 
faction had adopted an absolutely definite decision on this 
issue.

<F P=106> [Unattributed report: "Heads of Republics Within the </F>
Russian Federation Support It..."] 
  [Text] On 21 April, the Russian president held a meeting 
with the leaders of the republics within the Russian Federation. 
The heads of the republics participating in the meeting adopted 
the following statement: 
  "We participants in the meeting with the Russian Federation 
president, representing the leadership of republics within the 
Russian Federation, aspiring to stability and the affirmation of 
the traditions of dialogue, compromise, and partnership in 
politics, declare our support for the idea of ensuring civil 
peace and accord in our multiethnic country at a crucial stage 
in its history. 
  "Together with the Russian Federation president, we believe 
that the signing of the Agreement on Achieving Civil Accord in 
Russia should demonstrate to Russians that politicians, state 
institutions, and Russian Federation components are capable of 
finding common positions for the effective settlement of urgent 
and socially important tasks within the framework of economic 
and social transformations. Political ambitions, hostility, and 
extremism in federal relations may hinder the quest for a joint 
way out of the crisis, and undermine trust in organs of power at 
all levels. 
  "We appeal to state, political, and social circles in Russia 
to assume responsibility for the stable and consistent 
development of our country, and to become involved in the 
concluding process of the preparation and signing of the 
agreement."

  [Text] Only one parliamentary faction, Yabloko, will not 
sign the agreement on public accord, presidential aide Georgiy 
Satarov declared at a briefing on Friday in the Kremlin 
commenting on Boris Yeltsin's meeting with representatives of 
Russia's leading political forces. In his words, all other 
factions and parties are looking for their own ways to sign this 
document. 
  Satarov underlined that the working group in charge of the 
preparation of this agreement for signing still receives 
proposals both from political structures and individuals. As he 
said, the final text of the agreement is due to be ready on 
April 26. On April 27 the State Duma will have to pass a 
decision on the text which cannot be changed. 
  Satarov believes that the overwhelming majority of the 
Russia's constituent regions and republics will sign the 
agreement. According to available information, a total of nine 
regions have still not reported about their decision to sign 
this document. 
  Satarov informed journalists about the conversation held 
between Yeltsin and participants of this meeting. He said that 
Yeltsin had declared that his attitude to any group not signing 
this agreement would not change so as to avoid a new spiral of 
confrontation.

  [Text] An agreement on civil accord should be signed by 
political forces at least for enabling them to resolve political 
differences "through elections, through ballot booths, through 
the press," not through the use of force, the leader of Russia's 
Choice faction in the State Duma Yegor Gaydar told Interfax on 
Friday. 
  A day earlier, during the debates over the signing of the 
agreement in the State Duma Gaydar spoke in favor of its 
signing. In his opinion, the parliamentary majority, which in 
his words, consists of opposition forces should "take 
responsibility for its like-minded persons", because "to provoke 
tensions in Russia today is a strike on security." 
  At the same time, Gaydar acknowledged that the foundation of 
possible civil accord "is very limited and there can be no 
agreement with the opposition on program issues." In 
particular, he pointed to different approaches to private 
property and the restoration of administrative control over the 
economy.

  [Text] Moscow April 22 TASS -- The Russian Civic Accord 
Agreement will be finalized by April 26, Assistant to the 
Russian President Georgiy Satarov told correspondents here today 
upon the completion of a working meeting of participants in the 
Civic Accord Agreement. Satarov cited the Russian president as 
saying "the working meeting was constructive and very useful". 
Satarov has an impression practically all Duma factions whose 
representatives attended the meeting are ready to sign the 
agreement with the exception of the Yavlinskiy-Boldyrev-Lukin 
faction. 
  The assistant described the speech of Communist leader 
Gennadiy Zyuganov as constructive. He said Zyuganov put forward 
important proposals on finalization of the agreement, including 
a suggestion to include in the document measures to decrease 
property differentiation, timely payment of wages and salaries 
and a tax reform. 
  Satarov said Zyuganov also commented on the current press 
campaign to discredit Soviet Marshal Georgiy Zhukov. In his 
words, the president is considering a possibility to unveil a 
Zhukov monument on Red Square and institute a Zhukov order on 
the occasion of the 50th anniversary of the victory in the great 
patriotic war of 1941-1945.

  [Text] Moscow April 25 TASS -- The Federation Council has 
begun to discuss the draft treaty on civic concord. Previously 
President Yeltsin sent a note to Vladimir Shumeyko, which 
expressed hope that the Federation Council would manage to 
prepare the text of the treaty for signing. Yeltsin appealed to 
"the wisdom of deputies and their understanding of common 
responsibility before Russian citizens." 
  Academician Boris Topornin, official representative of the 
Russian president and co-chairman of the public chamber, told 
the deputies that the draft treaty was the result of collective 
work and was approved by the majority of members of the working 
group, which prepared it. "The provisions, that contradict each 
other, were not included in the text, because it is going to be 
a document of concord," he explained. 
  Topornin stressed that the country cannot overcome the 
economic crisis without political stability. Authors of the 
draft treaty wanted it to be "neither a party, or group 
document, but a document reflecting common interests." The 
treaty will neither amend nor replace the Constitution and other 
legal acts. 
  According to Topornin, the item on responsibility for the 
non- fulfilment of the treaty was removed from the draft 
document, because "it cannot be based on enforcement and 
sanctions... Public control and the attitude of the population 
to it are the most reliable guarantee of its fulfilment," 
Topornin said.

    [Editorial Report] Moscow Ostankino Television First 
Channel Network in Russian at 1120 GMT on 24 April carries the 
40-minute "Live Dialogue" program featuring an interview with 
Russian Federation Council Chairman Vladimir Shumeyko and 
Russian State Duma Chairman Ivan Rybkin by correspondent Yuliy 
Semenov. 
  Semenov introduces Rybkin and Shumeyko and says the topic of 
discussion will be the agreement on civil accord to be signed on 
28 April. He begins by asking why the civil peace accord is 
needed. 
  Shumeyko explains that the Constitution was the basis for 
the 
'94 election of the chambers of the Federal Assembly. He says: 
"We must do a lot in Russia now, and without agreement it will 
be impossible. The Duma has nine factions that unite various 
political parties, but many parties have been left outside these 
bodies of state power. There are more than 100 parties all 
together. There are also many public movements, groups, and 
public organizations in the provinces. We would like to unite 
all of them around one goal, the goal of building. Russia needs 
calm today; Russia must work." 
  Rybkin suggests that Russia is in the middle of a crisis and 
accord is needed as soon as possible. He adds that there should 
be cooperation between all forces in society. He says that the 
State Duma has already released its own memorandum on accord, 
and the new document is absolutely necessary. 
  Shumeyko continues by saying that the people who worked on 
the new constitution have also contributed to the new agreement 
on accord, but the new document is less important than the act 
of signing it. He adds: "The signing of this accord means that 
every politician takes upon himself the responsibility for this 
accord. He undertakes to suspend all political battles, thus 
enabling Russia to work for at least two years, leaving aside 
the power struggle and the struggle for predomination in various 
social movements. This is an accord on the politicians' 
responsibility to find peace and a common language." 
  Rybkin says that there are also internal, interethnic 
problems facing Russia and cites relations with Chechnya as an 
example. He says he hopes that the agreement on accord will 
help to resolve these problems. 
  Semenov asks Shumeyko whether Chechnya is a constituent part 
of the Russian Federation. Shumeyko replies: "The Chechen 
Republic has been and still is a constituent part of the Russian 
Federation. The only difference is the politicians' view on this 
matter. As you know, President Dudayev has been the leader of 
the Chechen Republic for the last two years. He has been 
elected by the Chechen people. There is only one document, a 
decision by the former Congress of People's Deputies, declaring 
these elections void. And so, on the basis of this single 
document, as well as on the basis of various declarations--some 
harsh, others less so--issued by President Dudayev, everyone 
seems to have decided that Chechnya has separated from Russia. 
So this nation of 1 million, which is part of Russia, finds 
itself in a temporary, self-imposed isolation. The Federation 
Council will continue to work very consistently, but calmly, in 
order to fully reintegrate the Chechen Republic into Russia." 
  Shumeyko and Rybkin then discuss the Federation Council and 
the State Duma's future work on the civil accord and other 
pending matters. 
  Semenov asks Shumeyko about the fate of the Black Sea Fleet. 
Shumeyko replies: "Well, first of all, the fleet certainly must 
be retained. Russia, as you know, will very soon be celebrating 
the 300th anniversary of the Russian fleet. The Russian fleet 
is a Russian creation. The fleet is Russia itself. It is 
simply impossible to imagine Russia without it. Therefore, it 
is perfectly clear that it should be retained. 
  "The decisions that the presidents made--I mean, at the last 
CIS summit.... [pauses] Representatives of Ukraine and Russia 
stayed on after the summit. Boris Nikolayevich Yeltsin had 
talks with Leonid Makarovich Kravchuk, and the two presidents 
made a decision to divide up the Black Sea Fleet with a ratio of 
20 per cent to 80 percent. You see what happened afterwards, 
when talks began at lower levels of authority. 
  "I believe that the process will stabilize, but what I would 
like to see and what I would like to say by way of warning is 
that decisions here should not be made rashly. Things should be 
done more calmly. We all know this. Both the Ukrainians and 
ourselves know that the fleet should remain, and the Black Sea 
Fleet will remain and will exist forever. As to what form it 
should take, I would prefer it to remain as a complete fleet. I 
believe that this is what will happen eventually--however much 
the politicians are insisting on their short-term gains today. 
Short-term gains are very dear to certain politicians. A 
little time will pass, and the people will have forgotten about 
today's politicians, but the fleet will be remembered." 
  Semenov then asks Rybkin about possible trouble on 1 May. 
Rybkin replies: "I am convinced that on 1 May, the day of 
spring and labor--our official holiday but also the Orthodox 
Easter day--the streets in Russia will be calm. People are 
beginning to understand that there is a need for the accord that 
we have been talking about for a whole hour today." 
  Rybkin then adds: "I am sure that we will be both 
intellectually and emotionally strong enough to understand that 
we must find a way out of the crisis through joint efforts. As 
they say, Russia has always been strong through its team spirit, 
and is famous around the world for its great good deeds rather 
than for its meanness." 
  Semenov thanks the listeners and says he hopes to see the 
chairmen in the Kremlin on 28 April to sign the agreement on 
public accord.

  [Text] [Correspondent Aleksandr Gerasimov] Last week, in an 
exclusive interview with our program, Aleksandr Rutskoy--who for 
two months had been keeping a vow of silence following his 
release from the Lefortovo prison--said he was ready to unite 
and head all opposition movements inclined toward [word 
indistinct]. 
  [Begin recording] [Rutskoy] I want to do this. 
  [Gerasimov] What organizational form could this take? 
  [Rutskoy] It could be a public political movement, not a 
party; not now, because people have had enough. It could be a 
public political movement that would express the interests of 
society, the interests of the state, and the interests of the 
individual. An organization of this kind can be set up. It 
can, and it must. This is the first task that has to be dealt 
with--to set up a civilized opposition, to draw up clear and 
easily understood programs, and to publicize them. 
  I have no doubts that people will follow this public 
political movement, which would stand for the national interests 
of the state and its people. They will follow because I just 
cannot see who they can follow at present. I cannot. I cannot 
see it, looking objectively at any party, at any public 
political movement now in existence. I can give way to anyone 
as soon as I see that there is a person capable of leading, 
capable of setting up a civilized opposition, capable of 
explaining the situation clearly to the people and of telling 
and showing them how and by what means a way out of this 
situation can be found. [end recording] 
  [Gerasimov] The former vice-president intends to start 
forming the opposition movement as soon as the public accord 
treaty is signed. Rutskoy said: I will see who signs, who 
volunteers to don a muzzle, and I will try to unite those 
without a muzzle.

  [Excerpt] Moscow, 22 Apr -- The Working Moscow organization 
has declared its intention to "continue lawful counteraction" 
against the Russian authorities at a rally held on the 124th 
anniversary of Vladimir Ilyich Lenin's birthday. A statement by 
the organization's Political Council read out on Moscow's 
Teatralnaya Square today says that it is ready to join the 
agreement on public accord only "on condition that the country's 
present leaders withdraw from the political scene." 
  The organizers of today's mass action are Working Moscow and 
the Russian Communist Workers' Party. Several thousand people 
attended the rally. The slogans and appeals that have become 
traditional at all opposition rallies alternated today with 
attempts to interpret Lenin's activities. [passage omitted]

  [Text] Moscow April 25 TASS -- The Russian Federation 
Council voted on Monday to accept the resignation of former 
prosecutor general Aleksey Kazannik. 
  121 out of 130 present members of the upper chamber voted 
for 
the decision, four against and five abstained. 
  Kazannik offered to resign in February in connection with 
the 
release of anti-Yeltsin rebels after the State Duma proclaimed a 
political amnesty. 
  Yeltsin accepted the resignation and appointed Aleksey 
Ilyushenko as acting prosecutor general. 
  But Kazannik later changed his mind and the Federation 
Council, which appoints and dismisses the prosecutor, voted to 
reinstate him. 
  To end the crisis Kazannik offered to resign again. 
  The Federation Council now has to discuss the appointment of 
Ilyushenko. Prime Minister Viktor Chernomyrdin was entrusted by 
the president to press for the appointment in the Federation 
Council.

  [Text] Moscow, 22 Apr -- Rumors about Chinese expansion in 
eastern regions of Russia have been greatly exaggerated. This 
conclusion can be drawn from the results of the trip a group of 
Federal Assembly deputies made to Amur Oblast and Khabarovsk and 
Krasnoyark Krays. "There was no confirmation of expansion as a 
Chinese state policy toward Russia," Vladimir Podoprigora, 
chairman of the International Affairs Committee of the 
Federation Council, said today at a news conference in 
parliament's upper chamber. 
  However, problems do exist in Russo-Chinese relations. This 
was confirmed by meetings which the members of the International 
Affairs Committees of the two chambers held with members of the 
public, representatives of state authorities in the region, law 
enforcement bodies, and border troops. The delegation returned 
from Khabarovsk today [22 April]. Parliamentary hearings are 
scheduled for 25 April "on problems in Russo-Chinese relations 
and prospects for resolving them." Vladimir Podoprigora told 
the correspondent that the hearings intend to coordinate common 
approaches in foreign policy toward China between the government 
and parliament and between the center and the component parts of 
the federation. 
  He pointed out that the problem of state borders falls 
within 
the provenance of the upper chamber. This question will be 
raised at the hearings. In the presence of members of the 
government, experts, and scholars there will also be discussion 
of the development of economic relations, the creation of more 
acceptable conditions for border trade, conditions to ease 
border crossings for people living in border areas, problems 
about sojourns by Chinese citizens on Russian territory, and 
Russian citizens in China. 
  The deputies' trip and the hearings are also connected with 
Viktor Chernomyrdin's upcoming visit to China, during which 
about 10 agreements of various kinds are expected to be signed. 
The deputies will draw up recommendations at the parliatemtary 
hearings, but they are unwilling to give these recommendations 
without hearing various points of view. Therefore, the deputies 
refrained from assessing the state of Russo-Chinese relations at 
the news conference.

  [Text] Tokyo, April 23 KYODO -- Russian President Boris 
Yeltsin suggests in memoirs to be published next month that 
Russia may reconsider economic reform being carried out under 
the leadership of Western organizations such as the 
International Monetary Fund. 
  He says in the private notes that two years of economic 
reform carried out by former First Deputy Prime Minister Yegor 
Gaydar showed Russia's peculiarities and that "Russia must go 
its own way." 
  KYODO NEWS SERVICE has obtained a copy of his memoirs to be 
published early may in Russia and abroad. 
  In it he describes how he has watched and reacted to recent 
developments in Russia and the former Soviet Union. 
  It covers the failed coup attempt by conservatives in the 
former Soviet Union in August 1991 and the military crackdown 
against rebel members of the Russian parliament last October. 
  Yeltsin said he adopted "shock treatment" by Gaydar, once 
the 
main architect of Russia's reforms, because his theories were 
the most convincing among those of many economists. 
  Yeltsin defended the radical economic policy, saying it 
would 
have been impossible for Russia to carry out any different 
policy. 
  On hyperinflation brought about by the introduction of 
market 
reforms, Yeltsin said every nation, without exception, has 
passed through this sort of era. 
  The memoirs also give Yeltsin's account of his use of troops 
against conservatives holed up in the White House parliament 
building in Moscow last October. 
  Yeltsin reveals that he went through "a critical situation" 
because at first the military did not obey his order to attack 
the rebels. After declaring a state of emergency, he had tried 
to dispatch the military to suppress mobs attacking key city 
buildings, but the troops were slow to act. 
  By finally persuading the military to agree to attack the 
White House, Yeltsin managed to force the surrender of the 
conservatives, led by former Vice President Aleksandr Rutskoy 
and former parliament chairman Ruslan Khasbulatov. 
  In sharp contrast with bitter remarks about former political 
foes, Yeltsin praises incumbent government ministers led by 
Prime Minister Viktor Chernomyrdin. 
  He calls Chernomyrdin a man who is reliable and has never 
betrayed his expectations. 
  Describing a visit to Japan shortly after last autumn's 
turmoil in Moscow, Yeltsin said he went ahead with it out of 
concern that suspending it might have damaged bilateral ties for 
a long period. 
  "If it had not been to Japan, I could have canceled the 
visit, but I thought I must go," he writes. [sentence as 
received] 
  Before last October's visit, Yeltsin had twice called off 
scheduled trips to Japan. 
  He indicates his desire to complete his four-year term of 
office, saying he will leave politics in accordance with the 
constitution. 
  A Japanese-language version of the book is scheduled to be 
published early May, publishing world sources said. The book 
will be titled as Yeltsin's Memoirs -- Behind the Scenes 
of Collapse and Confrontation."

  [Text] The Federation Council's Speaker Vladimir Shumeyko 
has spoken out against early presidential elections in Russia. 
  He wished that Boris Yeltsin would not only carry on as 
president until 1996 but would nominate himself to next 
presidential elections and be elected for yet another five-year 
term. 
  Talking to the editors-in-chief of Russia's leading media, 
Shumeyko said that Boris Yeltsin is the only appropriate 
candidate to the presidency in the country. 
  "A change of Russian president now would be tantamount to a 
catastrophe, he believes. A new head of state would start 
changing the entire team in the center and province. His people 
would start settling scores with previous teammates." 
  In such an event, Shumeyko feels, Russia would plunge into 
such a political and economic crisis that would blast any hope 
for further reform.

  [Text] Moscow April 22 TASS -- The State Duma, Russian 
parliament's lower house, has considered multiple infringements 
of electoral rights of citizens, which allegedly took place at 
the elections to St. Petersburg City Assembly, and proposed that 
the Russian procurator-general's office and the Central 
Electoral Commission look into this matter. 
  The legislators also proposed that Russian President Boris 
Yeltsin take necessary measures in regard of St. Petersburg 
officials on the results of the inquiry. 
  According to Deputy Vladimir Ryzhkov, who has submitted the 
draft proposal in question, the elections to St. Petersburg City 
Assembly were held on March 20, 1994 in accordance with an 
instruction prepared by St. Petersburg Mayor Anatoliy Sobchak. 
However, sufficient number of voters turned up only in 25 out 
of 50 electoral districts. 
  In this connection, the St. Petersburg mayor instructed to 
prolong the election campaign by one day and lift some of the 
restrictions, which earlier barred certain categories of 
citizens from participating in the elections. Remarkably, these 
restrictions had been introduced by Sobchak himself. 
  St. Petersburg procurator has now appealed to the court with 
a statement, describing Sobchak's instruction as unlawful, 
because the mayor exceeded his powers specified in President 
Yeltsin's decree "on reforming bodies of state power in St. 
Petersburg".

  [Text] Moscow 22 Apr -- Boris Yeltsin today cancelled his 
edict "On Not Extending State Guarantees of Social Protection To 
Certain Former People's Deputies of the Russian Federation." 
This was the edict issued on 6 October 1993, enabling 
Presidential Administration Head Sergey Filatov and a special 
commission to draw up a list of 151 deputies to be deprived of 
the payment of one year's salary based on the salary they were 
paid in their final month as deputy. This sum amounts to about 
3-4 million rubles and is being paid to each black listed deputy 
from the state budget. 
  The issue of whether they should be allowed to keep the 
Moscow flats they were allocated when working for the Supreme 
Soviet is also still being debated. But on the eve of the 
signing of the treaty on civil accord, the president has decided 
to meet the opposition half way in order to achieve civil peace 
in Russia.

  [Text] Moscow, 23 Apr (ITAR-TASS) -- In order to ensure the 
implementation of the Russian president's edict of 11 June 1993 
No. 918, Russian Government Chairman Viktor Chernomyrdin has 
signed a resolution of the Russian Government: On measures to 
restore the state monopoly on the production, storage, and 
wholesale and retail sales of alcohol products. This was 
announced by the press service of the Russian Government. 
  The resolution envisages, inter alia, a number of measures 
aiming to protect the economic interests of state and consumer 
rights. These measures will be applicable to all enterprises, 
irrespective of their form of ownership or of which government 
department they come under, including joint ventures. 
  The state monopoly on the production and sale of alcohol 
products applies to ethyl alcohol derived from any foodstuffs or 
non-food products, on alcohol produce, and on wine and wine 
products. 
  State inspection bodies must adopt, within one month, a 
procedure for issuing licences to produce, bottle, store, and 
sell wholesale alcohol products. 
  In accordance with the resolution, federal state bodies 
should draw up annual predictions of alcohol products' 
production and sale volumes with the export-import share taken 
into account. Instructions have also been given that a draft 
resolution on the procedure of establishing quotas, and 
proposals on payments for the issuing of licences for the 
production, bottling, storage, and wholesale of alcohol products 
be presented to the Russian Government within two months. 
  According to the resolution, it is prohibited to use ethyl 
spirit made from non-food raw material for the production of 
alcohol products, and the procurement and processing of raw 
material for the production of spirit by bartering it for spirit 
and other alcohol products. Besides this, it is prohibited to 
lease enterprises engaged in the sphere of the production, 
bottling, and storage of alcohol products without the issuing of 
the appropriate licences. 
  The federal executive bodies have been instructed to present 
within three months proposals for a single procedure of the 
retail sale of alcohol drinks in the territory of the Russian 
Federation. 
  Law and order bodies have been instructed to present within 
two months proposals on administrative and criminal liability 
for the violation of the state monopoly on alcohol products.

  [Text] Moscow, 22 Apr -- Boris Yeltsin has backed the State 
Duma's decision on granting live broadcast time to the various 
political forces for discussion of the treaty on the attainment 
of civic accord in Russia. He announced this in the Kremlin 
today at a working conference of those participating in the 
agreement on the attainment of civic accord in Russia. 
  "Russia has an alternative to confrontation," Boris Yeltsin 
declared. According to him, the document on civic accord that 
has been prepared "is an agreement of which all the social and 
political forces are the authors." 
  The president noted that "each side will commit itself to 
implementing the treaty; everyone will have to give up 
something." "Calm in Russia is the main thing; for the sake of 
that, one must impose limitations on oneself and find a salutary 
compromise." 
  Boris Yeltsin is certain that "the country is badly in need 
of a new political culture." In his opinion, a permanently 
operating mechanism for accord must be devised. Analysing the 
draft agreement that was achieved, Boris Yeltsin noted that all 
political and social forces needed to prove in practice that 
"extremism is ineffective in politics."

<F P=106> [Irina Savvateyeva report: "The Nature of Social Policy Has </F>
Been Agreed in the Government"] 
  [Text] The latest session of the Russian Federation 
Government Presidium took place Thursday. It can be said that 
the first question was "routine": Reports from officials 
responsible for the implementation of the 9 March government 
decree "On the Situation of the Russian Economy and the 
Prospects for Its Development in 1994" were heard. In recent 
times, weekly accounts of work done have become a tradition at 
Presidium sessions. 
  But it was Labor Minister Gennadiy Melikyan who delivered 
the 
report concerning the main question: "On the Draft of the Basic 
Guidelines for the Social Policy of the Russian Federation 
Government for 1994." 
  Social problems the government intends to tackle in line 
with 
the "Basic Guidelines" are as follows: the fall in living 
standards for the bulk of the population; the dramatic 
intensification of social stratification; and the increase in 
the extent of hidden unemployment, and the threat of its 
escalation into overt unemployment.... 
  The government intends to resolve these problems within the 
framework of preserving (and ultimately improving) correlations 
between the minimum working wage, pensions, grants, and 
benefits, and the size of minimum subsistence requirement. 
  As the Ministry of Labor sees it, this can be achieved 
primarily by "protecting the fixed incomes of the population 
from inflation on the basis of various forms of indexation of 
the pay rates and salary scales of workers in budget-financed 
sectors." (It is typical that the intention is to "protect" 
from inflation, and not to fight it.) Admittedly, there is one 
condition -- that protective measures should be implemented 
"with due account of the financial possibilities of the state." 
  But it is proposed that "urgent assistance to those 
categories of the population whose per capita income is lower 
than the minimum subsistence requirement" be given to the 
regions. Along with this, the need to create economic and legal 
conditions providing an incentive for high labor productivity by 
the country's able-bodied sector is pointed out. 
  The Ministry of Labor also proposes to perfect the system of 
taxation for consumption funds and the revenues of individuals, 
which, according to the evaluations of certain experts, may 
culminate in the drastic wage control. 
  For the purposes of averting "wholesale, mass unemployment" 
it is proposed to implement a Federal Employment Promotion 
Program for 1994. Incidentally, this program was also examined 
at the Government Presidium session. 
  The Ministry of Labor also proposes setting in motion a 
mechanism for the regional regulation of employment on the basis 
of socially permissible levels of unemployment, which will be 
defined by each Federation component. When this level is 
reached, it is recommended that special measures, including 
administrative measures, be taken to restrict unemployment. 
  What is interesting is that the Ministry of Labor believes 
that the funds envisaged by the 1994 Budget for social needs 
will be sufficient to implement the proposed program. Provided, 
of course, that the financial resources of enterprises and 
extrabudgetary funds are also harnessed. 
  After a discussion, the government approved the "Basic 
Guidelines for Social Policy for 1994."

  [Text] The All-Russia Communist Party conference held in 
Zvenigorod on Sunday and attended by about 300 delegates, 
adopted a minimum-program guided by tactical considerations. 
  According to it, the Communist Party will work for the 
formation of a government of national trust accountable to the 
Federal Assembly, organize a nationwide discussion of a new 
constitution and ensure its adoption by the actual majority of 
electors. It will also work for the adoption of a new election 
law, the restoration of the Soviet system and of the union, the 
denunciation of the Belovezhskaya Pushcha agreement, and the 
implementation of an independent foreign policy reflecting the 
tendencies in world development and Russia's national and state 
interests. 
  The Communist Party will also work for changing the economic 
course, for a switch-over to state regulation and for the 
prevention of industrial decline and inflation. 
  It will ensure the restoration of the Russian citizens' 
guaranteed social and economic rights to work, recreation, 
housing, free education, health care and pensions. 
  The Communist Party opposes the practice of discrediting the 
Soviet history and Lenin's theory, and also the policy of 
Americanization, violence, profiteering and immorality. 
  As before, the Communist Party will have the red banner and 
symbol-the hammer and sickle. The party's motto is: "Russia, 
Labor, Democracy, Socialism." 
  At the end of the conference the delegates sang the 
Internationale.

  [Text] The Russian Communists said today at an all-Russian 
conference of the Communist Party of the Russian Federation that 
the memorandum on civil accord in its present form is not 
acceptable. Party leader Gennadiy Zyuganov made a speech at the 
conference and said that political measures and not declarations 
should be the basis for civil accord. Their purpose should be 
the elimination of sources of civil confrontation, which he 
believes are the sharp property stratification, the violation of 
social and economic rights of working people, the increase in 
crime, and the spiritual degradation of the public. The head of 
the party believes that a civil accord in Russia is possible but 
it should be agreed upon not by confrontational branches of 
powers but by various political forces. The communists intend 
to set up a wide coalition of left, centrist, and national and 
democratic forces in order to win the elections and to come to 
power legally.

  [Text] According to the leader of the Communist Party of 
the Russian Federation, Gennadiy Zyuganov, the national crisis 
has acquired the traits of a trench civil war interrupted by 
ever more violent attacks on the people. Zyuganov was 
addressing the party's national conference in the city of 
Zvenigorod near Moscow, on Saturday. 
  He said that owing to social degradation and the 
impoverishment of the population, mounting tensions could erupt 
in a spontaneous rebellion of marginalized elements and in an 
all-out war for the division of what remained of public property. 
  If this kind of a rebellion did take place, the party would 
aim to channel the masses' energy into the mainstream of class 
struggle for the labor masses' vital interests. The Zyuganov 
party rejected even the fairest of civil wars. 
  Zyuganov assigned strategic priority to civic peace as the 
main condition for coping with the crisis and transition to 
socialism. 
  Also, the Communist party of the Russian Federation intended 
to build a broad coalition of left-wing, centrist-oriented, 
patriotic and democratic forces which would be able to 
neutralize the party of civil war and hold it in political, 
economic and moral isolation. 
  Thirdly, the Zyuganov party aimed to lead the left-wing 
coalition to power by either carrying a general election or with 
the help of some other non-violent means. 
  The party's chief objective, according to Zyuganov, was the 
creation of an updated union of republics and the declaration of 
the Minsk decision on the abrogation of the treaty of union as 
null and void. 
  In Zyuganov's view, the executive branch of national power 
felt irresponsible because it reported to no one and the 
legislative branch - because it enjoyed no rights. He 
suggested redistribution of powers between the two branches and 
more work on the national checks and balances system. He 
called, among other things, for: 
  - moves to build bridges between the two houses of the 
Russian parliament and outline their joint authority over, 
primarily, relations with the executive branch; 
  - full operational subordination of the Ministries and 
government agencies to the prime-minister and more clarity on 
the authority and functions of the president and his men; 
  - holding the government accountable to the legislative 
branch and for the endowment of the Federal Assembly with the 
right to make decisions on the government's staff and structure, 
confirm or reject choices for prime-minister and government 
programs, as well as initiate, in case the government deviated 
from a confirmed course, moves to unseat the government;

<F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS correspondent Lyudmila Aleksandrova] </F>
  [Text] Zvenigorod (Moscow region) TASS -- The Communist 
Party of the Russian Federation came out against the memorandum 
on civic peace and accord, which is to be signed on April 28. 
Participants in the Communist Party's two-day national 
conference, which was completed on Sunday, said the party 
regarded itself as "component part of the union of Communist 
parties -- CPSU aimed at gradual consolidation of Soviet 
Communists." 
  Delegates to the conference passed a total of seven 
documents, including theses to the Communist Party's programme 
"from crisis to steady development," a resolution "on patriotism 
and attitude towards the ruling regime," a document "the 
Communist Party of the Russian Federation on the way to accord 
for Russia," as well as a reolution on the results of the recent 
meeting of communist leaders of former Soviet republics. 
  The conference was held not exactly in the way the Communist 
Party's leader Gennadiy Zyuganov expected to. Although his 
moderate patriotic line was not subjected to open criticism, the 
documents adopted by the conference contradict in certain 
respects the course pursued by the current party leadership. 
  First, some amendments were introduced into the draft theses 
to the party's programme, which shifted the "state-patriotic" 
accent towards a greater "international" character of the 
programme. Second (which was to a considerable degree due to 
member of the editing commission Anatoliy Lukyanov, one of the 
August 1991 coup plotters), excluded from the draft document 
"the Communist Party of the Russian Federation on the way 
towards accord for Russia" was a provision saying early 
elections may become unnecessary if effective agreement on civic 
peace is reached at the negotiating table. 
  The resolution on the results of the recent meeting of 
communist leaders from former Soviet republics was passed also 
on Lukyanov's proposal. The meeting was held in Zvenigorod, 
outside Moscow, on April 22. The resolution says the Communist 
Party "regards itself component part of the Union of Communist 
Parties, but retains organizational autonomy and its own 
programme and charter." According to Lukyanov, this is 
"essential advance as compared with associate membership." 
  Zyuganov did not seem very enthusiastic about the prospect 
of 
the Communist Party's joining the Orthodox Union of Communist 
Parties headed by Oleg Shenin. Instead, he backed the idea of 
setting up a new association to unite communist parties of the 
former Soviet Union, which is to be called a "Union of 
Internationalists." This issue is most likely to be raised at 
the coordinating meeting of communist leaders of former Soviet 
republics this coming May. 
  However, all this by no means proves to any split in the 
party: All documents were approved nearly unanimously. But the 
general impression was that the Communist Party obviously lacks 
unity, and its leader finds it rather difficult to combine the 
party's new parliamentary image with feelings of grass roots 
members and certain leaders.

<F P=106> [Yevgeniy Yanayev report: "Russian Communist Party Holds </F>
April Plenary Meeting. Zyuganovites Decide Whether They Should 
Support the Bolsheviks or the Communists"] 
  [Text] Russian communists have launched a whole slew of 
organizational measures that are primarily designed to resolve 
whether supporters of this movement will adhere to democratic 
rules or whether they will once again start agitation in the 
parliament. Yesterday, a plenary meeting of Zyuganov's Communist 
Party [CPRF] Central Committee opened in Zvenigorod. For a 
leader with a penchant for parliamentarianism this will be a 
test of strength on the eve of a party conference scheduled for 
next weekend. 
  The plenary meeting will focus on the communists' theses for 
a party program, which is to be approved by the All-Russia 
conference. The program itself has been purged of the slightest 
hints of Bolshevism. State-patriotic in tone, it recognizes the 
need to continue reform -- of course, with a greater emphasis on 
social aspects -- and tolerates the existence of private 
property. Some CPRF "mid-level" chiefs, however, do not share 
the state and social democratic views of their leaders. 
  Gennadiy Zyuganov's opponents are more attracted by the 
stance of the Bolsheviks from the Union of Communist Parties -- 
the CPSU under Oleg Shenin, former Politburo member. The union 
hews to unblemished principles, puts class struggle and 
internationalism above anything else, and does not have a single 
seat in the "bourgeois" parliament. Matters to be discussed by 
the plenary meeting have taken on such an urgency in the party 
that observers do not rule out the possibility of a split in its 
ranks. 
  The agenda of the plenary meeting also includes the 
consideration of an organizational matter. The meeting is set 
to remove Ivan Rybkin from the Central Executive Committee under 
the official pretext of his having too much work in parliament. 
To all appearances, however, the actual reason is related to 
his political platform, because many party members think that 
the lower chamber speaker has embarked on the path of 
opportunism. Too often have the views of Comrade Rybkin 
coincided with those of the authorities, to which the CPRF is 
still in opposition. KOMMERSANT-DAILY will report the results 
of the plenary meeting and the party conference in its 26 April 
issue.

<F P=106> [Article by State Duma Deputy Vladimir Zhirinovskiy under </F>
the general heading "Homespun Socialism, Smelling of 
Footcloths": "On the Role of Russia as Gatherer, and the Young 
Wolves"] 
  [Text] For centuries Russia used to gather land. Opening 
up new land, conquering it by war. I am not a professor of 
history and I am not about to deliver a lecture on how Russia's 
lands increased and which czar was more notable than others in 
this matter. I am more interested in the motive for this 
movement. At a recent banquet, a representative of the 
Ukrainian "Rukh" explained it all, in my presence, in terms of 
the Russians' genetic aggressiveness. That is what he thinks. 
What I think is that the crux of the matter lies in the sense 
of self-preservation of a great people. For this reason, 
military-strategic questions have been in the forefront for 
every emperor. First security, life -- and then all the rest. 
And therefore -- push the borders back as far as possible, 
build fortresses to greet the enemy on the distant approaches. 
Best of all, rely on the sea, on maritime borders, and have as 
few land borders as possible. 
  Russia had no alternative. Too much territory, too much 
wealth. Too many people who were upset by that wealth. The 
Tatar-Mongol yoke, the Turks, the French, the Germans, and all 
the other dribs and drabs.... 
  The red monarch Stalin was not born bloodthirsty. In the 
late twenties he was the perplexed leader of a vast peasant 
state with indigenous industry, and therefore with a poorly 
armed army and an administrative apparatus disintegrating under 
the influence of the NEP [new economic policy]. Stalin realized 
that Russia has no right to be weak, otherwise it will get eaten 
up, and that in order to have thousands of planes and tanks, you 
need plants, plants, and more plants.... Plus roads and mines. 
And all this in a matter of a few years. History did not allow 
decades. There were no foreign credits, the treasury was empty 
after the wars and troubles. What was to be done? And how 
could you get the peasant to part with his yard and his cow and 
go off to the city to push trolleys? Pay him millions? There 
were no millions.... So he chose the simple and terrible path 
for which, in human terms, he cannot be forgiven, the path of 
Peter the Great, Catherine, Ivan the Terrible. But the other 
scenario -- the plan of Hitler's Ostministerium -- also 
envisaged nothing cheerful for Russia in the event of its defeat. 
  We now have the same situation that Stalin had in the late 
twenties. Economic collapse, an empty treasury, the loss of the 
outlying lands. But we do not need savage repression, we are 
not in a hurry as Stalin was, because we do not fear foreign 
enemies as Stalin did. We have nuclear missiles and other kinds 
of all-out weapons. We are much calmer today than then. We do 
not now need to hold on to certain territories for 
military-strategic purposes, we do not need to keep tens of 
millions of breadwinners under arms. The army today is first 
and foremost sophisticated technical facilities and up-to-date 
infrastructure. And of course it is a pity to leave Europe and 
the Baltic -- after all, we used to keep the very best things 
there (once again, by old habit, we were thinking in terms of 
striking at the enemy on the distant approaches). Airfields, 
bases, depots -- all this cost billions. Because of this we got 
paid 200 rubles all our lives and were packed into communal 
apartments. But in politics, lamenting what is past or passing 
is a waste of time. You have to think about the present and 
future. 
  It is a total paradox that the present situation offers the 
unexpected prospect of a fourth and fifth push [brosok]. If in 
August 1991 the Communist Party -- the backbone of the system -- 
collapsed, in December 1991 the artificial construct of the 
state of "equal republics" fell apart, and in October 1993 the 
soviets were smashed, in the near future two more decisive blows 
must be struck while the autocratic power still has the 
initiative: It is necessary to "close down" the autonomous 
republics, oblasts, etc., and immediately to bring back 
guberniyas, headed by governors. With no debate about it. 
Quickly and firmly, under an appropriate edict, bring those 
sovereign presidents who are reluctant to become governors to 
dachas outside Moscow for a "little chat." Let them take a 
rest, eat plenty of sour cream, watch television, only do not 
let them leave the grounds of the dacha...for their own safety. 
When they come out in a couple of years, it will be another 
country. And without a single drop of blood spilled. 
  And the names of the guberniyas would be strictly on 
territorial principles -- for instance, Kazan Guberniya, not the 
Tatar Guberniya. Because if one nationality is incorporated in 
the name, the other nationalities are, so to speak, guests, 
living from day to day. 
  The restoration of the guberniyas within Russia's borders as 
of January 1992 is the fourth blow. This blow must be struck 
quickly, and the Federation Council should be called the Senate 
or something like that, and forget about that federation as if 
it was just a bad dream. 
  After the fourth blow, the fifth. The "former" republics 
rejoin Russia as guberniyas -- Nikolayev, Odessa, Minsk, 
Alma-Ata [Almaty], Bukhara guberniyas.... Once again this must 
be done quickly and sharply, against a background of sharp 
destabilization of the situation in the "near-abroad" (I cannot 
avoid using this idiotic term) and the use of propaganda on a 
massive scale, since television broadcasting is in Moscow's 
hands. At the moment the initiative is in Moscow's hands too, 
and we must not delay or waste time talking. The best memorial 
to those who died at the White House is not shoot-outs, but the 
re-creation of a great state, an empire, on the 1900 model. I 
know I will be accused of nationalism and extremism again. As 
usual. As it was two and a half years ago, when I ran in the 
presidential election with the slogan "I will defend Russians 
and the small peoples." At that time they called me a 
chauvinist. But now even Kozyrev is defending (only verbally, 
as yet) the Russians in the Baltic region. Where now are the 
Democratic Russia supporters with their panhuman values? Where 
now is the Democratic Russia appeal to the regions to "take as 
much sovereignty as you can carry"? It is embarrassing even to 
mention it now. And that inappropriate conversion, which I 
always criticized. And the cleansing of Moscow and other 
Russian cities of criminal southerners? Whose idea, in a 
watered-down form, has Mayor Luzhkov begun to implement? Gleb 
Yakunin's, Lev Ponomarev's? Galina Starovoytova's -- the deputy 
from Armenia? Who was the first in the entire country to start 
talking about guberniyas and the pernicious nature of the 
Sakharov draft constitution, whereby dozens of appanage 
principalities would appear in Russia? At that time the 
Democratic Russia supporters idolized Sakharov, now they keep 
quiet. They have realized that Sakharov's ideas are the way to 
wall-to-wall local wars. And people will remind me about the 
vodka, too. I was not only talking about cheap vodka, but about 
vodka and tobacco as exclusively state revenue. No imports of 
tobacco or alcohol, production only at state plants under state 
medical control, for sale exclusively at state stores and at 
firm (I emphasize, firm) prices. Low prices, so as to stop the 
manufacture of hooch. Only a fool or a CIA agent could give 
away the state's revenue from alcohol and cigarettes to 
foreigners who supply all kinds of muck in pretty bottles and 
packs. And then that fool or agent comes crying to us that 
there is no money for doctors' wages, for long-term investments, 
for road building. True, there is not. You yourself gave that 
revenue away. Tobacco, vodka, sugar, and wool should be managed 
exclusively by the state. It is the state's money, treasury 
money. Plus the railroads. They are also sacred, the state's. 
That is what I was talking about. Yet they made me into the 
"great friend of alcoholics" (although alcoholics are part of 
our society too). 
  Shall we in any case define what kind of society we are 
creating? Will there be rich people in that society? 
Certainly. Will we have a redistribution every five years, take 
various things away from people? No. We are not a proletarian 
party. Will we recognize private initiative and private 
ownership? Yes, of course. Will we let pensioners or children 
with no parents die of starvation? Never. A grant, a roof over 
their head, a medical examination, free bread and free milk 
should be found for the most unfortunate. That is socialism. 
But we will have our own brand of socialism, not Swedish and 
not Belgian, but our own, national, homespun, hempen socialism, 
laced with communal, corporative psychology and smelling of 
footcloths. With a big role for the state and civil servants. 
Gaydar wants to build a small -- compact, as he puts it -- 
state. How can that be? We have to build roads, feed the 
North, maintain a big army and security, develop new 
technologies and fundamental science. Who will provide the 
money for this? The young wolves. Those who, when the Law on 
Cooperatives came out, rolled up their pants and ran off after 
money and the chance to establish themselves. Those who took 
their computers everywhere, and then "made their way up" on 
nonferrous metals and foreign junk. I am like them myself. At 
the dawn of perestroyka I started my own thing -- in politics, 
whereas they did it in business. I traveled that path from the 
bottom -- from little groups huddled in dubious apartments, to 
victory in the parliamentary elections in Russia. They went 
from a small cooperative or currency speculation to reputable 
firms. I will help these boys. I will not stifle them with 
taxes. I will allow them to have weapons to ward off the 
gangsters. I will make the state protect them, and, most 
important, I will give them serious business -- not spirits or 
vodka or chocolate, but the exploitation of large mineral 
deposits and the construction of large plants. Chubays' 
distribution of property to his own will be stopped. It will 
all be honest and simple. If you have the money, go buy a plant 
or a hotel, if you don't have the money, save up. And 
everything openly, by auction. And every day a report showing 
how much money the budget has received from privatization. Can 
you imagine what sums the sale of facilities like the VDNKh 
[Exhibition of National Economic Achievements] or the Kosmos 
Hotel in Moscow could yield? Trillions. Where are those 
trillions? In Chubays' dacha? 
  It is time military industry was privatized. And the young 
wolves given a share. And then they will understand why we need 
a new aircraft carrier or combat helicopter. And they will stop 
worrying about customs dues on "Rasputin" vodka. Foreign policy 
must also serve the young wolves. Take the case of Georgia. 
What we should have done was to take away Abkhazia (at the 
Abkhaz' request, naturally, and under a treaty with Georgia 
itself, which will agree to anything just now) and settle 
Russian entrepreneurs, officers, and those Vorkuta miners on the 
coast, give them each a hectare of land, and let them build 
houses, swim in the sea, and eat oranges. The Abkhaz would have 
been very pleased. They would know: Since there are Russians 
here, the people from Tbilisi will not poke their noses in (or 
if they do, we will show them). Yet instead of these heavenly 
places, we are cramming our boys into godforsaken corners of 
Russia. 
  In general, the bureaucratic, red-tape mechanism of access 
to 
resources (from the leasing of nonresidential premises to the 
exploitation of natural reserves) must be smashed. Only open 
auctions, dealing not with individual facilities, but everything 
-- real estate in cities, enterprises' fixed assets, monetary 
and natural resources. Central Bank credits -- also by auction. 
No special-purpose credits. If all this is done, lease 
payments will immediately become many times cheaper and the 
interest rate on credits will fall. If the Central Bank rate 
falls to 30-40 percent, there will be long-term investments, 
which we need. The only downside is that the bureaucrats will 
lose their bribes. Well, they can go to hell. 
  The structural policy must consist of identifying areas of 
production that are competitive on the world market 
(petrochemicals, the gas industry, the aerospace sector, 
weapons, etc.) and investing sufficient resources there. In 
these "special zones" there should be a concessionary tax 
regime. Elsewhere we will tighten up, but here we will give as 
much as necessary. The government must compile a list of 
200-300 priority facilities for investment on the basis of 
existing production units. And the money must be given not 
directly, but through stable commercial banks and structures 
which can subsequently be held accountable for the money. 
  The problem of overcoming the production recession is a 
problem of the population's effective demand. The rich alone 
will not create demand for Russian industry -- they prefer 
imports. But the collapse of the consumer market could be 
halted by creating a system of consumer credit, indexation of 
the population's Savings Bank investments, and special-purpose 
bonds. During the election campaign, when I proposed 
compensation for losses resulting from price liberalization and 
the indexation of savings, all the "democratic" newspapers 
started laying into me, accusing me of wild schemes and 
demagoguery. But why, I ask you, is it not possible to 
index-link savings by issuing people with bonds -- state loan 
certificates with a term of 5-10 years (at 20-30 percent annual 
interest) -- and creating a system of depositing these bonds in 
commercial banks in order to obtain consumer credit. That would 
not lead to additional monetary emission, it would only change 
the structure of existing credit investments. But, I will be 
frank, the wisest economic plans will collapse when there is no 
elementary order, when instead of hard work people can steal 
with impunity, when there is no authority, when bribery controls 
everything. Therefore I will start from scratch. I will ask 
20-year-old Akhmet, who is driving around Moscow in a Mercedes 
600, what he actually does day after day. I will soon fire the 
militiaman who, peering at a deputy's card, states baldly: "The 
Duma is not my boss." And when billions are stolen by means of 
banking manipulations, I will simply have people shot. Civil 
servants must get on with their work for the set time -- from 
nine to six. Janitors must sweep the streets. The trains must 
run on time. Doorway lamps must work. It is elementary. If it 
does not happen, someone will answer to me for it with his head. 
Here I will act not like an economic theorist, but like a 
pragmatic Russian. 
  And as a pragmatic Russian, I would not allow the 
newspapers, 
while the president is alive, seriously to discuss possible ways 
of removing him and to "select" his replacements. Those 
newspapers would quickly be discovered to have unpaid telephone 
bills amounting to a couple of million dollars, and their 
telephones would be cut off for nonpayment. And then there 
would be a fine of 100 million rubles for using the kettles. 
And maybe as a result people would realize that it is unseemly, 
while daddy is present, to share out his legacy. 
  By the way, about daddy. His friends and colleagues are 
already quietly discounting him. Hints to the same effect are 
coming from the west, he has played his part, they say, look for 
a new one. They even sent the Government Inspector -- grandpa 
Nixon. I will tell you, as a pragmatic Russian -- they are 
writing Yeltsin off too soon. Boris Nikolayevich is an 
absolutely mystical figure. They have buried him -- politically 
and physically -- dozens of times. And dozens of times he has 
risen from the dead. He did not drown in the river on Nikolina 
Gora, or get smashed up in a plane, or die in an air crash. He 
won two putsches and outwitted and outplayed Gorbachev. Look 
what a party he smashed! He is just like a hero from a Russian 
folk tale. Did any of those who were present at the Central 
Committee plenum in 1987 and who wanted Yeltsin, ever think that 
they were looking at a future president? Yeltsin conducts 
politics not by Friedman's schemes, but by intuition. And that 
is why you cannot stop him by logic. Like me. We are both 
mystics. By the laws of logic, I also could not have won the 
parliamentary elections or come third in 1991. Therefore, among 
the candidates for the new presidency, Yeltsin is my most 
threatening rival. The others are village teachers and little 
boys from the capital's special schools. 
  If Yeltsin, to whom it fell to make the first three pushes, 
also makes the fourth and the fifth, his chances will increase 
immeasurably. He will become the czar-father. Let me remind 
you: The fourth push is the revival of guberniyas within 
Russia's present borders. The fifth is the restoration of 
Russia within the USSR's borders on the guberniya principle, 
without republics as intermediaries. And then it is not far to 
the sixth push -- to the south, to the Indian Ocean. But that 
one is my chance, my mission.

  [Text] LDP [Liberal Democratic Party] leader Vladimir 
Zhirinovskiy is planning to hand the party's own plan of 
economic recovery to the Russian president as Yeltsin and 
parliamentary leaders meet on Friday. It provides for a one 
party government led by LDP as the party winning the December 
election. If not, six of the incumbent ministers(Chubays, 
Shokhin, Shakhray, Kozyrev, Grachev and Yerin) must be replaced 
by LDP representatives, the paper says. The party also wants 
its own candidate to be elected as speaker of the lower house 
offering Yeltsin to take an indefinite leave to shed 
responsibility in the event of tension. 
  LDP also calls for a new administrative-territorial division 
of the country by abolishing national autonomies and restoring 
Russia to the former Soviet Union's borders under the 1975 
Helsinki Accord on inviolability of frontiers. It opposes the 
reduction of the armed forces and demands that the 
military-industrial complex be restored in full and arms exports 
expanded. 
  LDP demands a sharp reversal of Russia's foreign policy by 
lifting the blockade of Yugoslavia, Iraq and Libya and sending 
Russian troops to be withdrawn from Germany to the Balkans. "The 
lifting of sanctions against Yugoslavia can help saturate the 
Russian market with cheap clothing, footwear and foodstuffs", 
the authors of the plan believe. LDP is strongly opposed to any 
agreements with NATO or joint military exercises on Russian 
territory. 
  The party offers an integrated program to combat crime to 
root out all criminal rings within three months. It also calls 
for a crucial change of domestic propaganda by removing 
anti-Russian ideologists and campaigners, foreign preachers, 
advertising and erotics from the mass media. 
  "Russia is in deep crisis. The Russians are perishing while 
your entourage is deceiving you. Lying ahead is a powerful 
social upheaval followed by chaos and a total ungovernability of 
the country. Mr President! LDP calls on you to accept its 
program in the name of Russia's salvation", says the appeal.

  [Text] Moscow April 24 TASS--The hardline National 
Salvation Front does not intend to sign the memorandum on civic 
peace and accord, according to speakers at today's report-back 
election session of the Front's national council. Participants 
in the session demanded that President Boris Yeltsin step down, 
early presidential election be urgently held and the country's 
current political and economic course be changed. 
  The progress report, which was delivered by the Front's 
leader Ilya Konstantinov, said "the National Salvation Front 
lost its mainstay following last October's collapse of soviets 
which were the backbone of opposition forces". 
  According to Konstantinov, "unless steps are taken to put an 
end to the amorphous coalition of various political forces, 
which is exactly what the National Salvation Front is now, the 
movement will be doomed to leave Russia's political arena". He 
believes that opposition can be rallied into one force only if 
it nominated a single candidate for the Russian presidency. The 
Front leader declared struggle for early presidential election 
the main goal of the movement. 
  The following debates over the report revealed that the 
National Salvation Front had no allies among Russia's major 
political forces. Nor does it have enough funds to carry out 
propaganda and organizational work or leaders enjoying 
nationwide support. 
  Konstantinov declined to take part in a meeting with 
presidential aide Georgiy Satarov scheduled for April 26. The 
session elected a group of three activists to represent the 
front at the meeting. 
  The Front's council addressed the Federation of Russia's 
Independent Trade-Unions, calling "for joint actions to protect 
the social and economic interests of the population".

  [Text] Omsk April 24 TASS -- Several thousand people have 
joined the People's Conscience Party which Alexey Kazannik, 
former prosecutor-general of Russia, is founding upon his 
returning here. 
  Kazannik is again a profesor at the law department of Omsk 
University. He devotes all his spare time to the elaboration of 
programmatic documents and organisational structure of the new 
party. 
  More than 5,000 people have joined the party within three 
days in Yekaterinburg, the hometown of President Boris Yeltsin, 
Kazannik told ITAR-TASS. The most active support in forming the 
party is being given by scientists and faculty members of 
Novosibirsk and Omsk institutions of higher learning, the 
Academgorodok (science city) and other cities in Siberia, the 
Urals and the Far East, by entrepreneurs and the work 
collectives of industrial enterprises. 
  Kazannik said he was prompted to found a party of his own by 
"the immorality and inefficiency of the present authorities at 
all levels and by the impossibility to combine efforts with all 
the already existing parties and movements for moral 
considerations".

<F P=106> [Dmitriy Kuznets report in the "Law" column: "Parties </F>
Should Compete With Each Other. The State Will Maintain Only 
the Winners" -- last paragraph is Gleb Cherkasov report] 
  [Text] The draft law on political parties worked out by 
the Duma's Social Organizations Committee was yesterday 
presented to journalists. The main novelty compared to the 
analogous law of the Soviet period, according to the draft 
authors, is that political parties have been separated from the 
general mass of public organizations. As of now, to register, a 
party should have a membership of 5,000 and regional branches 
with more than 10 members in more than half the Russian 
Federation components. The draft also provides for a 
complicated system of party re-registration after each federal 
elections. Only those parties that have surmounted the 
5-percent barrier will have their registration automatically 
extended. The others must re-register for next election 
campaigns. 
  The draft, furthermore, allows registration of regional 
parties that are expected to be barred from contesting 
federal-wide elections. Which, by the authors' admission, 
clearly infringes their interests because the "will for power" 
is the main objective of all parties. 
  In full accord with this thesis, the draft builds a party 
state financing system. Funds will be made available only by 
election committees and only for purposes of conducting election 
battles. Funds will also be provided to the factions of those 
parties which have emerged victorious from these battles. 
  Parties are forbidden to receive donations from foreign 
citizens or organizations as well as from the state (with the 
above exception). 
  As has become known, a group of deputies has prepared an 
alternative draft law on political parties. According to one of 
the "alternative" authors, Vitaliy Savitskiy, who is a member of 
the Duma's Public Associations and Religious Organizations 
Committee, one of the main distinctions of the second draft is 
the predominant role of the state. Under the alternative draft, 
the main financing for public organizations is provided by the 
state while the volume of monetary infusions depends on how 
successful a particular party has been in the elections. 
According to Mr. Savitskiy, such a mechanism can contribute to 
the gradual evolution of large political organizations.

<F P=106> [Yelena Cherkasova report under the "Party Organizational </F>
Development" rubric: "Split Likely in `Democratic Russia.' 
Ponomarev and Yakunin Hate To `Lose Face'"] 
  [Text] The "Democratic Russia" movement conference for 
hearing reports and preparing for elections was held in Moscow 
on 20 and 21 April. A split developed from the very first day 
both among the conference delegates and among the "Children of 
Russia" Coordination Council. The apple of discord was the 
"Children of Russia" movement's attitude toward the "Russia's 
Choice" party being created by Yegor Gaydar. The resolution on 
providing organizational support for "Russia's Choice" obtained 
276 votes while 34 delegates were against and 13 abstained. A 
situation of uncertainty took shape. In the wake of Ilya 
Zaslavskiy's address saying that only a new reformers party with 
a rigid structure and individual membership can countervail the 
Liberal Democratic Party of Russia, "Democratic Russia" 
cochairman Lev Ponomarev stated that in such a case the 
"Democratic Russia" movement was going to forfeit its political 
independence and "face." As for Gleb Yakunin, he discerned in 
Ilya Zaslavskiy's statement and in the passed resolution on 
"Russia's Choice" the beginning of the end of the Moscow-based 
"Democratic Russia." 
  The discussion of organizational questions reconciled 
everybody for a time, however, and the delegates decided to make 
no amendments in the "Democratic Russia" rules for the time 
being. The conference did pass one amendment, though. The 
"Democratic Russia" rules say that the Coordination Council 
cannot be composed of more than 20 percent of representatives of 
one party, a collective participant, or any other component 
part. But the delegates, or more correctly, supporters of the 
creation of Gaydar's "Russia's Choice," decided that it can, 
following which Gleb Ponomarev, Gleb Yakunin, and their 
supporters walked out.

  [Text] One of the initiators of the Accord for Russia 
Movement, member of the Constitutional Court Valeriy Zorkin, has 
proposed urgent measures for Russia to overcome the crisis. 
Valeriy Zorkin made the statement Friday in an interview with 
Interfax. 
  After other leaders of the Movement discuss the proposals 
they may be part of the Movement's program. 
  Zorkin sees as the main task the restoration of the power's 
efficiency. With this aim in view he proposed to create a state 
council out of representatives of influential political forces. 
Is it worth to put cardinal transformations to the will on one 
person even if he is elected by the people because he has no 
team of professionals enjoying the people's confidence? asks 
the judge. A state council could coordinate important decisions 
taken by the executive power. This body could bear 
responsibility before the people for the measures taken, 
believes Zorkin. 
  The draft document outlines the main principles for the 
country's pulling out of the economic crisis which are based on 
the proposals by Sergei Glazyev and other economists. Zorkin is 
sure that it is necessary to regulate prices for the time being 
on key price-forming goods, to effect state control over prices 
for electricity, oil, communal services, bread, milk, butter and 
sugar. There is need to reform the taxation system to lower the 
tax burden for current incomes. 
  Also important is to stop the crime tide, said Zorkin. He 
proposed to create an anti-mafia structure, a standing body of 
cooperation between the executive and legislative branches of 
power to combat power abuse and organized crime, including in 
the sphere of state government. 
  It would be worthwhile to adopt for three-five years 
amendments to the Criminal Code toughening punishment for crimes 
against individuals, said the judge. 
  He believes that army units should operate in areas with the 
unfavorable criminal situation. Zorkin proposed to introduce 
amendments into the Law on the State of Emergency which would 
permit impose a special rule in such areas.

<F P=106> [Mikhail Lantsman report under the "The Whites" rubric: </F>
"People's Workers' Union Wants To Erect an `Ideological Core' in 
Russia. For Starters, it Proposes That Market Be Crossed With 
Collectivism"] 
  [Text] The ideological and moral principles of the White 
movement are still topical in present-day Russia, leaders of the 
People's Workers' Union of Russian Solidarists [NTS] claim. 
Despite the collapse of communism and the Soviet power, the 
oldest anti-Soviet organization does not consider its historic 
mission played out. At a press conference held at the 
Revolution Museum yesterday, NTS leaders unveiled their program 
for erecting Russia's "new ideological core." 
  The victory of the Reds in the four-year Civil War 
undoubtedly amounted to a national catastrophe that has brought 
about the corruption of morals and the social enslavement of 
Russian citizens, Dmitriy Khanov, NTS activist, said. Having 
long predicted an end to the Soviet system, the solidarists did 
not expect that the revival would take so long to complete. The 
ideology to heal the nation and create a new Russian community 
should be a theory of solidarism synthesizing a liberal market 
economy, collective traditions, and statehood, the NTS believes. 
  An integral part of the overall national revival are 
geopolitical efforts to bring the nation to a healthy state. 
The RSFSR's administrative borders inherited from Bolshevism 
cannot be seen as enduring boundaries of the Russian state, the 
chairman of the NTS executive bureau thinks. Nonetheless, the 
future merger of historical Russian lands, NTS leaders believe, 
will proceed peacefully through the natural attraction of a 
number of republics to each other. Meanwhile, the issue of 
Crimea, where a referendum has already been held, should be a 
subject of international talks. In the solidarists' view, the 
Russian leadership should courageously and openly announce its 
historical responsibility for the future of the Crimean 
peninsula. The Russian leadership, however, can acquire the 
moral right to solve territorial disputes only after it gets rid 
of the Soviet heritage. 
  The NTS, which has not been encumbered with a totalitarian 
heritage, is already preparing the ground for future talks. 
"The NTS congratulates you on the results of the referendum," 
said a leaflet distributed by solidarists in Sevastopol. 
"Crimea was the last corner of Russian land that was defended 
from the Bolsheviks by Vrangel's White Army. Your will, your 
craving for Russia is a bone in the throat of [Ukrainian] 
independence-seekers."

<F P=106> [Yelena Yakovleva report: "Nizhniy Novgorod Model of Land </F>
Reform Becomes All-Russia Model"] 
  [Text] It has become known that Prime Minister V. 
Chernomyrdin has signed documents approving the Nizhniy Novgorod 
version of land reform as the model for Russia. 
  The Nizhniy Novgorod governor, who was counting on nothing 
less than a "model for Russia," is to be congratulated. The 
scientific "curators" from the IMF are also to be congratulated 
-- this is a rare successful project in Russia. (An American 
expert told me that he had neglected some more important work 
just so that he would be able to tell his son: "I was involved 
in privatization in Russia!") Our own "practical workers and 
theoreticians" should not be forgotten either -- kolkhoz 
chairmen and scientists from the Agrarian Institute who had 
started this work earlier in Rostov and Samara Oblasts but were 
unable to present it to the public as [Governor] Nemtsov has 
done with the Americans. 
  The Nizhniy Novgorod option may be welcome to the people and 
the government because it is mild and does not presuppose 
"giving anybody a hard time"; it is a model for the natural 
growth of private farms from collective farms that is 
calculated, as Allan Bigman, one of the American leaders of the 
project, said, to take 20 years. Essentially this is a 
mechanism which regularly "opens doors" to those who want to 
leave kolkhozes and go into private farming, removes political 
resistance (the displeasure of the kolkhoz chairman), and 
overcomes economic resistance (the impossibility of building up 
a decent-sized plot of land and finding the money to cultivate 
it). 
  It is curious that people with a variety of views like the 
Nizhniy Novgorod option -- for instance the famous journalist 
Yuriy Chernichenko and the famous economist Aleksey Yemelyanov, 
who recently made opposite assessments of the same events. 
Mikhail Lapshin, chairman of the Agrarian Party and the 
"chairman body" that he personifies do not like it, but 
presumably Chernomyrdin's signature will remove the 
dissatisfaction. 
  A fly in the ointment: The Nizhniy Novgorod model can easily 
be profaned. There is a natural law in Russia that the most 
radical reformist decision can be rehashed by the people 
implementing it until it reaches its exact antithesis. What 
could be more "dangerous" than a law giving peasants plots of 
land as their own property? Yet one or two extra features in 
the decrees, one or two imperfections in the Russian Federation 
Committee for Land Resources and Land Management's solemn 
promises to do everything tomorrow -- and suddenly all the plots 
of land that have apparently been turned into private property 
can serve to secure the kolkhoz chairman against any 
encroachments on his farm. He says: On my farm the people own 
everything. Yet the majority of peasants do not even suspect 
that they have ownership rights. 
  The Nizhniy Novgorod model presupposes complex calculations, 
not always comprehensible to ordinary people, and the honesty of 
these calculations and land and property auctions can be ensured 
either by a sincere desire on the part of the kolkhoz chairman 
to seriously reform, or by careful surveillance by American 
experts. There are not that many reformer-chairmen, and there 
will not be enough Americans to go around all the Russian 
kolkhozes.

<F P=106> [Unattributed OBSHCHAYA GAZETA report under the "The Press" </F>
rubric: "Knowledgeable People Conduct Investigation on `Version 
No. 1'"] 
  [Text] The General Prosecutor's Office is continuing its 
investigation into the libel case, filed on 28 March, against 
officials to whom the author of "Version No. 1" ascribed the 
preparation of an anti-Yeltsin conspiracy. 
  The circle of people asked for questioning as witnesses 
keeps 
widening. The office of Aleksandr Gorbunov, investigator of 
especially important cases under the Russian Federation general 
prosecutor, has already been visited by both the OBSHCHAYA 
GAZETA founder and staffers of its politics desk. Aleksandr 
Yakovlev and Oleg Poptsov are expected to testify. 
  Mr. Gorbunov has stressed specially that the instituted case 
has nothing to do with OBSHCHAYA GAZETA. If one is to judge 
from his questions, the investigation's attention is centered 
not so much on the authors of the notorious document (who 
obviously have been identified) as on the need to "pinpoint" the 
channels along which it was circulated, and the persons 
interested in that. If this is how it really is, the 
publication in OBSHCHAYA GAZETA, too, pursued the same goal. 
  As is known to the editorial office, Gleb Pavlovskiy, the 
"legal" author of the analytical note, has stated that he will 
decline to testify, believing the prosecutor's office actions 
unlawful. His arguments are like this: The text of the 
"Version" speaks about an intention to remove the president from 
power, not by a forcible and unlawful way but by legal means. 
Hence the prosecutor's office has no grounds for instituting a 
libel case that entails charges of committing an especially 
dangerous crime against the State (Article 130, Part 3, Russian 
Federation Criminal Code). Pavlovskiy maintains that he and his 
colleagues are being subjected to groundless pressure primarily 
from the Federal Counterintelligence Service. It is this 
pressure, as well as direct threats, according to Pavlovskiy, 
that force him and his colleague, Simon Kordonskiy, co-director 
of the "The 20th Century and Peace" analytical center, whom 
KURANTY recently named (together with Andrey Makarov, Mikhail 
Lukin, and Pavlovskiy himself) as a co-author of the "Version," 
to hide from the authorities. In Kordonskiy's opinion, the 
scandal around the publication has generally been used by the 
Federal Counterintelligence Service to convince the president of 
its loyalty, to become stronger, and to feel around for ways to 
revive political police in Russia.

  [Text] Vice Premier Sergey Shakhray says he has invited 
Chechen President Dzhokhar Dudayev for immediate talks but 
without "any mediators or bad advisers". In an interview with 
Interfax on Friday, he spoke of being vested with appropriate 
powers to hold such talks and having a constructive position to 
offer. 
  Shakhray denied any knowledge of Moscow's secret plans to 
throw weight behind the Chechen opposition as Dudayev said in a 
recent statement. "In keeping with a Duma resolution and the 
president's instructions to the government, we will negotiate 
with the Chechen government and mainstream political groups 
there", he said. 
  Shakhray, who will lead a Russian delegation in talks with 
Grozny, is to be vested with powers to try to clear the ground 
for a meeting between Presidents Yeltsin and Dudayev, government 
sources in Moscow believe. They also said that Shakhray had 
submitted a draft agreement for benefits to be paid in stages to 
old age pensioners in Chechnya. 
  "Instead of mutual accusations spread through the media, we 
must hold face-to-face talks to try to resolve the conflict", 
Shakhray said.

  [Text] On Friday Russian Finance Ministry presented 
explanations regarding the principles of foreign investment 
taxation. On April 19 the American Trade-Industrial Chamber made 
up of about 180 companies functioning in Russia recommended to 
its members to suspend allocation of credits to Russian legal 
entities due to an incorrect interpretation of the country's 
legislation on the part of several tax bodies of the Russian 
Federation. 
  The explanation of the Russian Finance Ministry says that in 
accordance with Russian tax law value added tax and a special 
tax are imposed on funds received from other enterprises and 
organizations. Exceptions are made for funds transferred to 
authorized funds of enterprises by their sponsors and funds 
intended for joint activity. VAT and special tax are not 
imposed on operations connected with issuance and transfer of 
loans and operations related to the circulation of securities 
(shares, bonds, certificates, promissory notes, and others.) 
  Foreign investments channelled to Russia for the creation of 
joint ventures and payment for securities of Russian enterprises 
procured by foreign individuals and legal entities are not 
liable for VAT or the special tax, indicates the Finance 
Ministry. Loans and credits granted by foreign banks and credit 
offices are also exempt. In addition, taxes are not imposed on 
funds which foreign states grant to enterprises and 
organizations free of charge in the form of a grant for specific 
projects. 
  The Finance Ministry also drew attention to the presidential 
decree dated December 22, 1993 "On Changes in Taxation and in 
Mutual Relations between Budgets of Different Levels." 
According to this document, VAT and special tax are not imposed 
on goods and technical equipment imported to Russia in the 
framework of free technical aid which foreign states render in 
accordance with inter-governmental agreements.

  [Text] This year, the Russian government is planning to 
accelerate agricultural reform and develop a procedure of 
agricultural enterprises' bankruptcy, Russia's Vice Premier 
Aleksandr Zaveryukha told Interfax. 
  He said that in the first quarter of 1994, agricultural 
production decreased by 13 percent and that no signs of 
stabilization were being felt. More than 30 percent of 
collective and state farms, and joint-stock societies do not 
earn enough to pay wages to the workers, said Zaveryukha. 
  He noted, however, that the government's attempts to 
privatize loss-making collective farms according to the Nizhnyy 
Novgorod or Moscow models, were resisted. 
  He confirmed the government's determination to observe the 
voluntary principle of privatizing large state-run and 
collective farms, and announced that the president and the prime 
minister had categorically rejected the proposal by head of the 
president's analytical center Petr Filippov on compulsory 
privatization of state and collective farms.

<F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS correspondents Lyudmila Yermakova and Igor </F>
Galkin] 
  [Text] Moscow April 23 TASS -- Russian tax police reported 
32,000 violations of tax legislation in 1993 and over 10,000 in 
the first quarter of 1994. 
  The figures were cited at a session of the Federation 
Council, upper house of the parliament, on Saturday. 
  Members of the House Budget Committee stressed that "tax 
privileges have failed to act as a stimulant for industry and in 
many cases have been used for dodging taxes." 
  In 1993 tax inspectors discovered over 1,000 unregistered 
legal entities which did not pay any taxes. They instituted 
criminal proceedings on more than 600 cases and about 200 in the 
first three months of 1994. They also stressed that more and 
more often tax inspectors become objects of assaults. 
  Tax revenues could increase the federal budget by billions 
of 
roubles, tax police officials said. Last year inspections and 
raids helped recover additional 800 billion roubles and over 600 
billion in the first quarter of 1994. 
  Officials complained that the tax system is in "complete 
chaos." Non-payment of income tax and value added tax accounts 
for the bulk of all tax violations. Enterprises often report 
bigger costs of their products than they actually are in order 
to avoid paying taxes. 
  Tax police experts believe only five major taxes should be 
left in Russia -- real estate tax, income tax for individuals 
and businesses, value added tax and excise tax. They 
recommended replacing profit tax with company income tax.

  [Text] A decision by the IMF to grant Russia a regular 
credit of $1.5 billion shows that the world economic and 
financial community supports our government's line of reforms, 
Russian Vice Premier and Economy Minister Aleksandr Shokhin told 
Radio Moscow correspondent Konstantin Garibov in an exclusive 
interview. He explained that the credit would be used to back 
the budget through noninflationary means, modernize, and raise 
the competitiveness of industry and agriculture. 
  Aleksandr Shokhin noted that the IMF decision was important 
for Russia also because it paved the way for the speediest end 
of the talks with official creditors on the repayment of 
Russia's foreign debts in the current year. This decision 
offers an opportunity for talks with the IMF over a new credit 
of $4 billion. 
  According to the Russian vice premier, Russia has normal 
relations with all international organizations, as well as the 
group of the world's seven most industrially developed 
countries. Mr. Shokhin believes that the main thing for today 
is to create a favorable climate for foreign investments. He 
says he thinks that a system of guarantees should be developed 
but not at the expense of the federal budget or government. 
Guarantees shall be created at a joint projects level. The 
schemes of mortgage guarantees and guarantees of a stable tax 
regime throughout the implementation of each investment project 
should be used. Such favorable conditions for foreign investors 
will enable Russia to handle the problem of recession more 
effectively than money borrowing. 
  Speaking about Russia's participation in the forthcoming 
meeting of the IMF and the World Bank Board of Governors due in 
Washington on 22 to 27 April, Aleksandr Shokhin said Russia 
planned to launch a number of new initiatives aimed at further 
developing equal and mutual advantageous credit and financial 
cooperation. He expressed hope that they would be approved just 
like a previous Russian proposal to establish special credit 
programs for countries with a transitional economy. Russia has 
already obtained $3 billion in credits for structural economic 
changes within the framework of this program.

  [Text] Pyatigorsk, Stavropol Territory, April 24 TASS -- 
"We insist that the president, the government and the Federal 
Assembly of Russia immediately take measures to adjust taxation 
policy, streamline managerial bureaucracy, resolutely curb crime 
and ensure strict compliance with laws", said a statement issued 
here by participants in a visiting session of the Union of 
Entrepreneurs and Lease-Holders of the Russian Federation. 
  The members of the union drew attention to the urgent 
necessity to increase efforts to combat crime also because, in 
their view, a large proportion of the population come to view 
entrepereneurs -- the main taxpayers -- as a mafia-like corrupt 
set. 
  "Democracy means a strong authority, not anarchy". The 
entrepreneurs want to see a realistic transition from intentions 
to carry on reforms to specific actions, the statement 
emphasised.

  [Text] By 1999, Russia will have to bring up the standards 
of its offshore oil exploration and development facilities to 
meet the requirements of the Solace '74 international convention 
and the global maritime safety communications system, said an 
executive from Rosneft, a Russian holding company managing state 
shares in the country's oil enterprises. 
  Otherwise Russia will lose its contracts for projects 
outside 
its territorial waters, Gennadiy Elefteriadi told Interfax. 
  He said Russia would have to buy INMARSAT global satellite 
communications systems joined to the GPS-GLONAS navigation 
system, satellite monitoring systems, automatic compact ships' 
radio stations, etc. Russia today produces no such equipment 
meeting international standards, although, according to Rosneft 
experts, it is able to if it buys foreign licenses. 
  Russia nowadays possesses more than 140 vessels and other 
facilities for offshore oil exploration and development, more 
than 20 of which operate outside Russian waters, including in 
the Gulf of Mexico, the Middle East Gulf, and on the shelf of 
Vietnam.

<F P=106> [Yevgeniy Anisimov and Yevgeniy Kirsanov report: "Rebukes </F>
Whistled Past Gerashchenko's Temple Like Bullets"] 
  [Text] The latest, fourth congress of the Association of 
Russian Banks, which have recently been increasingly frequently 
called the "fifth estate," was held in Moscow Thursday and 
Friday [21-22 April]. This estate, however, can also aspire to 
a higher title: Few people today would risk casting doubt on 
the influence of commercial banks. In all, there are more than 
2,000 banks in Russia, and the association has united almost 800 
of them -- naturally, the largest and most respectable financial 
establishments primarily become its members. The banks' actual 
influence on the economy is so great that both the government 
and the Central Bank of Russia deemed it necessary to tell the 
bankers of their intentions. 
  In particular, O. Soskovets, vice premier of the Russian 
Government, announced an upcoming revision of tax policy. He 
said that it will be aimed at creating the most favorable 
possible conditions for capital investments in production. But 
he at once "gladdened" those assembled with the fact that the 
government has a project according to which they must channel 
into developing the agro-industrial complex up to one-half of 
the profits made on deals in the currency market and on other 
"speculative" deals. 
  V. Gerashchenko, head of the Central Bank of Russia, was the 
traditional target for the bankers' attacks. They criticized 
him harshly for the archaic system of transactions, for the 
inordinately high interest rate on centralized credits, and for 
many other things. There is no point in enumerating all the 
grounds for criticism, since this time too Mr. Gerashchenko 
turned a deaf ear to the rebukes. 
  Even though one of the most painful questions -- the 
admission of foreign banks onto Russian territory -- was 
discussed at the congress, it rarely found itself at the center 
of attention. To all appearances, there will be no radical 
indulgences for foreign banks in the immediate future.

Economy and Industry Are the Foundation of Russian National 
Security"] 
  [Text] Russia's national security should be founded on a 
developed economy with a robust financial system, Andrey 
Kokoshin, first deputy defense minister, stressed in his address 
at the Fourth Congress of the Russian Commercial Banks 
Association. He pointed out the need to accelerate the process 
of setting up formidable financial-industrial groups in Russia 
and the CIS in order to manufacture science-intensive industrial 
products for both civilian and military purposes that will be 
competitive on the world market. 
  The creation of financial-industrial groups will make it 
possible considerably to ease pressure on the government budget 
and to boost investment in industry. Back in 1991, Andrey 
Kokoshin, who headed a group of economists, historians, and 
industrialists at the time, put forward the initiative to create 
such groups and powerful companies drawing on rich foreign 
experience. The main elements of these "locomotives" of the 
domestic economy would be enterprises of the former USSR's 
military-industrial sector that are undergoing conversion to 
civilian uses and diversifying their area of expertise.

  [Text] Moscow April 22 TASS -- The State Duma, the Russian 
parliament's lower chamber, endorsed on Friday the government's 
bill on state pensions. According to the bill, a minimum monthly 
pension benefit in Russia is fixed at 19 thousand roubles from 
May 1 and all other pension benefits will be increased 1.3 
times. Inflation compensation of 19700 roubles will be paid in 
addition to pension benefits as before. The difference between 
maximum and minimum benefits will increase twofold (comparing to 
1.85 times at present). 
  The bill, which is also to be approved by the Federation 
Council, the upper chamber, will provide the adjustment of 
pensions to the price growth, taking into account the financial 
resourses of the pension fund. In spite of many critical 
remarks and proposals, the lawmakers decided to endorse the bill 
allowing the payment of new benefits to begin from May 1, but 
the work to improve the pension laws will continue. However, 
some proposals, including on the government's power to fully 
regulate pensions, were withdrawn from the bill.

  The satellite was put into orbit by a Zenit-2 
rocket-booster. 
  This was the first launching of a rocket of this type and 
the 
22nd since the first firing-off in April, 1985, a spokesman for 
the Space Armed Forces told ITAR-TASS. 
  The Cosmos-2278 satellite is the 1075th spacecraft launched 
from the Baykonur Cosmodrome. The first one was put into orbit 
on October 4, 1957.

  [Text] At 12:02 Moscow time on Saturday the military-space 
forces of the Russian Defense Ministry launched a reusable 
booster Zenit-2 with a space craft Cosmos aboard. 
  Commenting this event, experts of the military space forces 
point out that in the framework of the state military space 
program Russia continues to supplement the grouping of 
satellites used in the interests of the Defense Ministry. 
  The reusable booster Zenit-2 is used to boost into orbit 
different space crafts with the disposable weight about 12.5 
tonnes to the height of 200 kilometers (it was designed by the 
design bureau Yuzhnoye, the city of Dnepropetrovsk, Ukraine). 
In accordance with the Russian state order which is in force 
till early 1995 the scientific-industrial association Yuzhnoye 
in Dnepropetrovsk will produce 3-5 reusable boosters Zenit-2 
annually. 
  Zenit-2 was created in the frameworks of the program 
Energiya- Buran to be used as a side-mounting booster. 
  In addition, there are certain plans to use Zenit-2 instead 
of the returnable booster Soyuz to boost manned space crafts 
into orbit. In addition, scientists are considering the issue 
to launch space crafts of the type Soyuz-TM into the near-earth 
orbit with a decline 51.6 grades from the Russian cosmodrome 
Plesetsk. The construction of a launching site consisting of 
two launching devices of the reusable booster Zenit is being 
completed here. The first launch from the cosmodrome Plesetsk 
is scheduled for 1997. 
  Experts also do not rule out possibility to use the boosters 
Zenit in the program of the international space station on the 
project Alfa. At present only one launching site situated on 
the cosmodrome Baykonur is used to launch Zenit boosters. 
Another one was completely destructed during the explosion of a 
rocket on October 4, 1990. There are no plans on its 
restoration. 
  Experts of the military space forces assert that Zenit-2 
booster is an ecologically pure rocket (its fuel -- kerosene, 
liquid oxygen is the oxidizer). The over-all weight of the 
rocket is 259 tonnes. Until now Zenit booster was used only to 
boost space crafts into orbit in the interests of the Russian 
Defense Ministry. A new modification of the rocket Zenit-3 is 
being developed on the basis of Zenit-2. It will be used to 
boost space crafts into geostationary and planetary orbits.

    [Editorial Report] Moscow Russian Television Network in 
Russian at 1000 GMT on 23 April on the Vesti newscast carries a 
video report by correspondent A. Sladkov on the Black Sea Fleet 
issue. Sladkov says: "The Ukrainian town of Sevastopol and the 
Russian naval base there remains the stumbling block in 
resolving the issue of the final division of the Black Sea 
Fleet. Moscow insists on Sevastopol for Russia's main Black Sea 
base and rejects the idea of moving to Donuzlav. Moreover, 
Russia will not accept the alternative of having both fleets 
based in Sevastopol." 
  The video then shows Russian Defense Minister Grachev, who 
says: "We cannot drive thousands of families out of one town, 
remove them from their homes, and settle them in different 
towns--now without homes. We must think about people. We must 
think about the pensioners, who, as members of the Black Sea 
Fleet, defended our homeland. We do not have the right just to 
cast them aside." 
  The video then shows interviews with people walking by on 
the 
street. 
  Sladkov notes that the population's mood is pro-Russian but 
does not want hostility. However, he says, "the Crimean leader 
is more radical." 
  The video shows Crimean President Meshkov addressing a 
demonstration: "As president of the Republic of Crimea I 
consider it impermissible to have the headquarters of the 
Ukrainian fleet on the same territory, in the same republic. 
For us it will be constant source of tension, a source of 
conflict and confrontation."

    [Editorial Report] Moscow NTV in Russian at 1800 GMT on 22 
April on the "Today" program carries a report on the Plesetsk 
missile test center in the town of (Mirnyy) in Arkhangelsk 
oblast. The correspondent says the site is not shown on maps 
because it is where military missiles have been tested since 
1957. He says the country knew nothing of these tests for 
decades, including the successes or failures. 
  A film shows an aerial view of the town, a convoy of 
unidentified missiles on the road, and a missile transporter 
erector launcher, TEL, driving down a forest road. 
  The correspondent says these scenes are being shown for the 
first time, adding that disasters during missile launches in 
1973 and 1980 resulted in the deaths of more than 50 people. 
Video clips then show an explosion, with two soldiers dragging a 
third past flames. 
  The correspondent then interviews an unidentified lieutenant 
colonel in front of a memorial. The lieutenant says: "I took 
part in organizing the funerals. Of course, it left a big 
impression. When I come here, I can see that moment." 
  The correspondent continues: "The Plesetsk range was not 
only a testing center. Events connected with the Cuban missile 
crisis in the 1960's form a special page in its history. Soviet 
missiles had been delivered to Cuba. The United States decided 
to destroy them from the air." 
  A video recording shows TEL's maneuvering and being driven 
out of hangars and along a road. The video then shows Major 
General Nikolay Moroz, assistant commander in chief of the 
Missile Forces, identified by caption, who says. "When it 
became known that the Soviet Union had 12 missiles with the 
range to reach America, this fact had a great influence on the 
politicians." 
  The correspondent says: "Some of these missiles were aimed 
at the United States from Plesetsk. Today there is a different 
atmosphere at the range. This is the secret computer center. 
Here they follow American missile testing. Moscow and 
Washington have agreed to exchange information on these kinds 
tests, and in accordance with the agreements the Americans have 
installed this equipment in Plesetsk. The Russian specialists 
have installed their own control instruments in the United 
State. Today the soldiers at Plesetsk are not only studying 
launches of other people's missiles; they are also developing 
Russian military missiles for the 21st Century. The Plesetsk 
state missile testing range. The fourth-generation Topol 
[SS-25] missile is being developed here [as heard]. The video 
shows the correspondent standing in front of an SS-25 road unit.

  [Text] Vladivostok, 23 Apr -- Russia does not yet have the 
resources to build purification installations, but the problem 
of utilizing waste from nuclear submarines must be tackled 
immediately, said Yuriy Maslakov, the director of the Zvezda 
nuclear submarine repair yard, at a briefing devoted to the 
completion of Russo- Japanese consultations on utilizing nuclear 
waste. 
  Nikolay Yegorov, Russian deputy minister of atomic energy, 
who attended the consultations, told journalists that there were 
three possible solutions to the problem: Build a purification 
complex on the territory of the yard itself; set up the same 
system in an isolated area of the Maritime Kray; or introduce 
advanced purification plants. As has already been reported, 
Russia and Japan have signed an agreement on an allocation by 
the Japanese side of $70 million toward converting Russia's arms 
enterprises. There are plans to use part of this money at the 
Zvezda yard.

  [Text] Russian President Boris Yeltsin addressed the nation 
on the occasion of the eighth anniversary of the Chernobyl 
disaster. He said that April 26 was a day of mourning to those 
who died in radiation emergencies and disasters. 
  He paid homage to those who were exposed to radiation while 
fighting the disaster. He said that the country would not 
forget those who were still living in areas contaminated by 
nuclear radiation. 
  In an address released by the presidential press service 
Yeltsin said April 26 was a day when the danger of nuclear 
disasters was especially obvious and that everything had to be 
done to make the world a safer place. 
  "On the day when Russia bows its head in memory of those who 
died in radiation disasters I express my deep condolences to the 
Russians and citizens of other countries whose relatives and 
friends fell in a fight with a deadly force and shielded us from 
disaster," the address says.

  [Text] An accident similar to that in Chernobyl is 
impossible in Russia, a spokesman for Rosenergoatom, Russia's 
nuclear power engineering concern, running all 9 Russian nuclear 
power plants, has said. 
  Anatoliy Zemskov told Interfax that after the events in 
Chernobyl, much work had been done to make nuclear reactors in 
Russia safer. 
  For instance, at the Leningrad nuclear power station, the 
first power block has been reconstructed. Technological 
channels were replaced and so were the reactor's inside graphite 
covering and the protection system. The speed with which rods 
fall into the active zone has increased from 18 to 4 seconds. 
  "This work makes it possible to avoid negative processes 
that 
are possible at the Chernobyl-type reactors," Zemskov declared. 
"Of course, this does not rule out separate incidents, however, 
today's safety systems can localize them," he said. 
  He also reported that the term of some reactors exploitation 
would soon be up, and power units would have to be stopped in 
ten years or so. This holds true of the Leningrad, Kola, Kursk, 
and Novoronezhsk nuclear power stations. So, it is now very 
important to start designing nuclear reactors of an advanced 
type, Zemskov said. 
  He disclosed that engineers at the St. Petersburg branch of 
the Atomenergoproekt institute were completing work on the 
design of a new NP-500 reactor. In the first quarter of 1995, 
work will start on an experimental reactor with a maximum 
capacity of 650 megawatt. "The equipment used in this reactor 
has been tested in most critical situations and has proved 
reliable," Zemskov said. 
  In his words, experts are considering the possibility of 
setting up nuclear power plants in some remote regions. 
"Sakhalin, Kamchatka, Chukotka, and Yakutia ask for smaller 
yield atomic power stations on their territories," he reported. 
  In his words, there is a plan to transform some nuclear 
reactors from icebreakers to movable platforms. Besides, there 
are blue- prints for building a small remote-controlled nuclear 
power plant. Placed underground, such a station can operate for 
25 years automatically, provided fuel delivery is regular.

  [Text] Khabarovsk -- "There are no plans at the moment to 
build any underground or surface nuclear electric-power stations 
on the territory of Khabarovsk Kray," Nikolay Balyukin, general 
director of the "Khabarovskenergo" joint-stock company said, 
commenting on reports of the supposed construction together with 
Japan of an underground nuclear electric-power station in the 
area of Komsomolsk-na-Amure. In his words, the discussions 
conducted in past years about the possible construction of a 
nuclear station in the area of Lake Emoron ended in the decision 
that a return to the question is possible only after serious 
scientific studies and the holding of a referendum among the 
population.

  [Text] Moscow April 23 TASS -- Russian Federation Council 
Chairman Vladimir Shumeyko has suggested extending military 
service for warrant officers for another five to ten years with 
their consent. 
  Shumeyko sent a draft law "on military duty and military 
service" to the State Duma chairman on Saturday. 
  "There is a shortage of warrant officer specialists in the 
Russian Armed Forces," Shumeyko explained. At present, warrant 
officers retire at the age of 45. After retirement from the 
army, many of them start looking for a job in the civilian 
sector whose employees themselves are facing redundancy claims. 
  Extended military service up to 55 years for warrant 
officers 
could help partially ease the problem, provided they want to 
stay in the army, Shumeyko said.

the Chinese ambassador to Kazakhstan. They stressed that the 
mechanism of summit contacts is working efficiently. The 
forthcoming visit to Almaty by Prime Minister Li Peng testifies 
to this fact. In the opinion of both sides, this visit will 
play an important role in concrete development and 
implementations of agreements reached in October last year 
during Nazarbayev's visit to China. The signing of an agreement 
on the state border between Kazakhstan and China and other 
documents will be of great importance.

<F P=106> [Report by ITAR-TASS correspondent Boris Mainayev] </F>
  [Text] Bishkek 22 April TASS -- Chinese Premier Li Peng 
began his official visit to Kyrgyzstan on Friday [22 April]. 
The guest arrived from Ashkhabad [Ashgabat] to Bishkek in the 
evening, and was met by Kyrgyzstan President Askar Akayev, Prime 
Minister Apas Amumagulov and other officials in the "Manas" 
airport. Then the motorcade proceeded to the suburban 
governmental residence "Ala-Archa." 
  Among the items included in Li Peng's three-day visit are 
meetings with the leadership of Kyrgyzstan and the signing of 
several inter-governmental agreements on commercial and cultural 
cooperation. These documents are designed to strengthen the 
already significant legal basis for bilateral relations between 
the two countries. They have already signed approximately 40 
treaties, agreements and protocols in the last two years. 
  President Askar Akayev visited Beijing in January 1993. Li 
Peng's return visit, planned for that spring, was delayed due to 
his health problems.

  [Text] Kyrgyzstan's President Askar Akayev and China's 
Premier Li Peng "are profoundly satisfied" with the level, 
prospects, and pace of bilateral relations. This was declared 
at a briefing in Bishkek on Saturday by Akayev's spokesman Iman 
Rysaliev, who informed journalists about the talks between the 
two leaders. 
  He noted "certain progress" reached in talks on disputed 
territories between Kyrgyzstan and China. "President Akayev 
believes that these issues will be settled in the spirit of 
mutual understanding and cooperation," Rysaliev said. 
  He revealed that the situation in Tajikistan had been in 
focus at the talks. In his words, Akayev believes that the 
Tajik government and opposition should renounce hostility and 
solve all problems by political means through negotiation. For 
his part, Li Peng declared that China "treats with understanding 
the difficulties, experienced by Tajikistan." He is convinced 
that these difficulties must be overcome within the framework of 
CIS. At the same time, he stressed the readiness of China as a 
UN Security Council member to contribute to the adoption by the 
world community "of appropriate steps toward solving the Tajik 
problems." 
  In an exclusive interview with INTERFAX, Rysaliev reported 
that during the talks, Akayev had welcomed the establishment of 
proper relations between Russia and China. In Akayev's opinion, 
a successful dialogue between these two countries "is a 
guarantee of peace in Eurasia and a major factor of stability in 
Central Asia." 
  He also voiced Kyrgyzstan's desire to foster relations with 
Russia. In Rysaliev's words, "the president highly appreciates 
the fact that China understands why Kyrgyzstan gives priority to 
friendship with Russia and other CIS states."

<F P=106> [Report by ITAR-TASS correpondent Boris Mainayev] </F>
  [Text] Bishkek 25 April TASS -- Business people of China 
and the Central Asian Republic of Kirgizia [Kyrgyzstan] plan to 
step up mutually beneficial cooperation. Participants in the 
meeting of Kirgiz and Chinese entrepreneurs, which was timed to 
coincide with the visit by Chinese State Council Premier Li Peng 
to Kirgizia this weekend, came to the conclusion that each 
industry in the economies of both countries were of certain 
mutual interest. 
  Kirgiz businessmen expressed readiness to supplement the 
list 
of the already existing 75 joint ventures with new ones, which 
will use Chinese technologies in food-making, processing of 
animal farming produce, manufacture of medicines and in 
agriculture. In their turn, Chinese entrepreneurs are 
interested in joint development of economic minerals, production 
of building materials, construction of roads to connect Kirgizia 
and China. 
  The meeting revealed certain differences between the Kirgiz 
and Chinese business people. Thus, the Chinese side would like 
to purchase Kirgiz electricity at prices close to the internal 
ones, while Kirgizia intends to raise them up to the level of 
world prices. But all these problems are quite solvable as long 
as entrepreneurs of the two countries are ready to meet each 
other halfway, participants in the meeting noted. 
  The meeting resulted in signing five protocols of intent, 
which are to be put into actions as soon as certain concrete 
projects are elaborated. 
  Last year's trade turnover between China and Kirgizia 
exceeded 100 mln dollars. According to the State Council 
premier, this figure is likely to be doubled this year.

<F P=106> [Report by Sergey Knyazkov: "Who Enjoys Serving in Kyrgyz </F>
Army? Russian Officers Turn to Askar Akayev for Help"] 
  [Text] In the wake of the "privatization" of former Soviet 
Army units, some 8,000 Russians ended up in the Army of Kirgizia 
[Kyrgyzstan] (around 90 percent of its officer corps). The 
sovereign Republic was interested in having the Russians help 
put together a national army. 
  Protocols defining service regulations for the Russian 
personnel in the army of Kirgizia were initialed in Bishkek on 4 
March. Under the first protocol, effective until 31 December 
1999, Russian nationals -- officers, warrant officers, 
servicemen -- in the Kirgiz Army are entitled to all benefits 
due servicemen of the Russian Army. Kirgizia's Defense Ministry 
undertook to buy for a retiring Russian officer or warrant 
officer housing in any town (with the exception of Moscow and 
St. Petersburg, and not to ask Russians to take another oath of 
loyalty. 
  Under the second protocol, officers and warrant officers of 
the Russian Army are permitted, before 31 December 1994, to 
serve in the Army of Kirgizia upon signing the corresponding 
contract while their citizenship and benefits remain the same. 
  But, as they say, everything was fine only on paper. A 
little more than one month after the signing of the protocols in 
Bishkek, the public learned of instances where Russians were 
being ousted from the Kirgiz Army. 
  Russian officers in the Osh garrison in southern Kirgizia's 
have sent an open letter to Republic President Askar Akayev. In 
it they write that "behind the back and despite the will of 
Republic Defense Minister Myrzakan Subanov, organs of the 
military prosecutor's office have begun lately to oust 
Russian-speaking commanders from the Army." 
  "The military justice organs that have occupied themselves 
with tracking down pilferers of military and state property 
among the officers," continues the letter -- published, 
incidentally, in the newspaper SLOVO KYRGYZSTANA [Kyrgyzstan's 
Word], "think, in our view, that since we have not yet left for 
our own country, this signifies that we have some side motives 
that are holding us back. But this is utter nonsense. We are 
still here only because we are true to the oath of loyalty we 
took some time in the past." 
  The letter of the Osh garrison officers is signed by 100 
persons. This attests to disturbing symptoms. What will the 
reply to it from the military prosecutor, Kurbat Kozhonaliyev, 
to whom the Russian officers' main charges are addressed?

<F P=106> [Report by ITAR-TASS correspondent Galina Gridneva] </F>
  [Text] Dushanbe 21 April TASS -- Tajik Labor and Employment 
Minister Shukyrdzhon Zukhurov, who heads the Dushanbe 
governmental delegation to the negotiations with the Tajik 
opposition, said he was satisfied with the first round of talks. 
He stressed that, despite different approaches to several 
questions, the two sides had taken the first step towards a 
political solution to the inter-Tajik national conflict. 
  Zukhurov told a press-conference on Thursday that the 
difficult two-week negotiations had started 5 April in Moscow 
upon the initiative of the United Nations and with the 
participation of observers from several nearby republics, 
including Iran, Afghanistan and Pakistan. The two sides looked 
at three groups of questions concerning the necessity of 
bringing a halt to hostilities on the Tajik-Afghan border and 
inside Tajikistan itself. 
  A protocol on the return of refugees and a general 
communique 
on the results of the first round were signed at the round's 
finish. The head of the governmental delegation said that the 
second round had been scheduled for approximately the end of May 
and would be held in either Tehran or Islamabad.

<F P=106> [Telephone interview with Tajikistan Prime Minister </F>
Abdudzhalil Samadov by OBSHCHAYA GAZETA correspondent Yuriy 
Kushko under the "Hello" rubric: "Going to the Ruble Zone with 
a Tajik Ruble" -- date not given] 
  [Text] Whereas Russia and Belorussia [Belarus] have signed 
a treaty on merging their money systems, in Tajikistan this 
unification has been slowed down. Yuriy Kushko, OBSHCHAYA 
GAZETA correspondent, turned to Tajikistan Prime Minister 
Abdudzhalil Samadov for comments. 
  [Kushko] How correct is the report that during your meeting 
with Aleksandr Shokhin in Moscow an agreement was reached on the 
introduction of "banknotes with national symbols" in Tajikistan? 
  [Samadov] This matter was indeed discussed. Upon agreement 
with the Russian Government such banknotes will be temporarily 
introduced in our country. Tajikistan's order for printing them 
has been placed with the Russian "Goznak" factory. We will 
receive the first batch in May. 
  [Kushko] Can this money be seen as national currency? 
  [Samadov] No, it cannot. This will be a kind of a coupon 
ruble to service our domestic trade. 
  [Kushko] You have repeatedly said that the collapse of 
economic ties and civil war have pushed Tajikistan to the verge 
of survival. Can it be that the current cash crunch will push 
the Republic to the verge of death? 
  [Samadov] Presently we are on the brink of social upheavals 
among certain sectors of the population. At the same time I 
rule out the recurrence of civil war. Yes, it is hard, but we 
all have to hold out for another couple of months. 
  [Kushko] According to the terms of Tajikistan's accession to 
the ruble zone, Russia promised it a credit of 120 billion 
rubles [R]. Has the agreement been adhered to and is this money 
sufficient? 
  [Samadov] In all, we received around R70 billion. However, 
the Republic's requirements in the first quarter alone were R174 
billion, and just as much in the second quarter. But we 
understand that Russia itself is short of money. 
  [Kushko] Does the introduction of the Tajik coupon ruble 
mean that the idea of merging money systems has been given up? 
  [Samadov] This is a complex and protracted process, but it 
cannot go on indefinitely. As for the Tajik side, we are ready 
to walk our part of the way to the end. At the latest talks in 
Moscow we firmly agreed with the Russian side that our money 
systems will finally be merged.

  [Text] The Tajik opposition leader Akbar Turajonzod argues 
that Tajikistan's leadership cannot last even three days without 
military and economic help from Russia. He has stressed in an 
interview with INTERFAX that Russia could end the civil war in 
Tajikistan within a month, if it wished to. 
  He did not rule out that the opposition might put pressure 
on 
the authorities in Dushanbe to speed up negotiations between the 
various Tajik factions. In his words, he has made this known to 
Albert Tchernyshev, a Russian foreign minister's assistant. 
  He noted that Moscow, on which the fate of Tajikistan 
depended in many ways, belittle the significance and role of the 
opposition. "We do not want war and bloodshed, even though we 
are quite strong even in Dushanbe," he stressed. 
  To prevent the talks between the various Tajik factions from 
being as protracted as the Georgian-Abkhazi negotiations, he 
suggested that they should involve the Kulyab clan, which is 
represented in all the power ministries in Tajikistan. 
  He wished that Tajikistan would be a democracy, where the 
church be separated from the state. 
  In his words, the opposition does not intend to advance 
Tajikistan theocratically on the threshold of the 21 century. 
He believes that Islamic traditions in the republic could be 
restored only "by people's will through referendums." 
  "Even if we come to power through elections, we will not 
change such basic constitutional norms as the freedom of speech 
or alter the functioning of any parties", he said. 
  "We cannot understand why Russians are scared by the revival 
of Islamic fundamentalism in Tajikistan. That does not 
correspond to reality," Turajonzod declared.

<F P=106> [Report by ITAR-TASS diplomatic correspondent] </F>
  [Text] Ashkhabad [Ashgabat], 22 Apr -- Turkmen President 
Saparmurad Niyazov and Li Peng, premier of the State Council of 
the People's Republic of China (PRC), have agreed to expand 
bilateral, political, economic, and cultural links. 
  After completing his three-day visit to Turkmenistan, the 
Chinese governmental head left for Bishkek where he will have 
talks with Kyrgyz President Askar Akayev on Saturday [23 April]. 
  Although during the visit no agreement was concluded on the 
"project of the century" -- the installation with Chinese 
participation of a super gas pipe to connect wells in the 
Karakum deserts to gas rings on the islands of Japan -- the 
parties agreed to "continue to study seriously" the project. A 
protocol on intentions was signed between Turkmenistan's 
Ministry of Oil and Gas and the Chinese national oil corporation 
that envisages the creation of a Sino-Turkmen-Japanese 
commission of experts. 
  In the opinion of experts, Turkmenistan may boost its yearly 
gas extraction to 230 billion cubic meters in the next 15 years. 
  A press communique on the visit's results distributed by the 
Chinese delegation notes both countries' intention to build 
long- term, stable relations on the basis of principles of world 
coexistence emphasized at the talks. The Chinese Government 
voiced support for Turkmenistan's efforts to defend state 
independence and sovereignty and to stabilize the situation in 
the country and region. Direct links between the partners in 
the trading and economic sphere would be encouraged. There was 
a "positive attitude" to opening direct air links between China 
and Turkmenistan. 
  An agreement on granting Turkmenistan a Chinese loan and a 
protocol on regular consultations between the two countries' 
foreign ministries were signed in the presidential palace today. 
The Chinese Government will also grant material and technical 
assistance free of charge. Both the contents of the latter and 
the value of the loan are unknown. 
  Li Peng, who has already been to Uzbekistan, will also visit 
Kazakhstan and Mongolia in the course of his present 12-day 
trip.

administration in the state of emergency area in North Ossetia 
and Ingushetia, Russian Internal Affairs Ministry internal 
troops conducted an operation on Saturday to move into the 
8-kilometer security corridor. The interior troops task is to 
occupy the entire corridor. 
  All North Ossetian and Ingush law enforcement units were 
pulled out of the corridor in advance. The RIA agency reports 
that the operation aimed at occupying the security corridor has 
proceeded without any major complications. Only near the 
village of Ali-Yurt in Ingushetia did a group of local resident 
try to prevent the interior troops from carrying out their 
operational task. The incident was settled promptly and without 
bloodshed.

<F P=106> [Natalya Gorodetskaya report under the "Conflict" rubric: </F>
"Ingushetia President Curtails Parliament's Rights"] 
  [Excerpt] Ingushetia President Ruslan Aushev yesterday 
signed an edict "On Some Powers of the President and National 
Assembly of the Republic of Ingushetia." The 13 April edict 
prohibits parliament from making statements, coming out with 
appeals, and taking other actions related to domestic and 
foreign policy without approval from the republic's president. 
  As many people know, several days ago the Ingush parliament 
asked Russian Federation President Boris Yeltsin to impose 
direct federal rule in the State of Emergency zone. Yesterday, 
Ingushetia's parliamentarians appealed to the deputies of the 
Federation Council and the State Duma of Russia. In the appeal 
they describe the 1992 armed conflict in Prigorodnyy Rayon of 
North Ossetia "as a carefully planned action by the North 
Ossetia leaders to ethnically purge citizens of Ingush 
nationality from this territory." In the opinion of parliament, 
calls for reconciliation when there are tens of thousands of 
refugees are taken by the Ingush people as calls for reconciling 
themselves to the role of exiles while the Republic of North 
Ossetia leaders "are growing increasingly confident in their 
impunity." The parliamentarians are confident that peace and 
accord can be restored between the Ingush and Ossetians "only 
when those deported have returned to their homes." [passage 
omitted]

  [Text] Moscow, 22 Apr -- Belan Khamchiyev, the permanent 
representative of the Ingush Republic under the Russian 
president, told the ITAR-TASS correspondent that the latest 
events on the border of the two republics once again prove that 
the Ossetian side is aiming for mass bloodshed. According to 
him, North Ossetia is shutting off all prospects for the 
negotiation process. 
  In the situation that has emerged, Khamchiyev believes the 
entire responsibility for the failure of the latest round of 
negotiations between the leaders of the two republics rests upon 
the top leaders of North Ossetia and Russia. Given that all 
possible means for a peaceful settlement have been virtually 
exhausted, it is expedient at the next sitting of the Federation 
Council to consider the question of introducing amendments to 
the Russian president's decree on introducing a state of 
emergency and to introduce direct federal rule on the territory 
of Prigorodnyy Rayon.

  [Text] Chechen President Dzhokhar Dudayev has favored the 
need for the creation of an efficient CIS defense shield which 
would have a powerful military potential and would be as good as 
the Warsaw Pact of NATO. In an interview with INTERFAX Friday 
[22 April] he said that the need to take such a step is 
conditioned by the fact that the Euro-Asian space of the former 
Soviet Union is now subject to dangerous bargaining in the West 
and this, he said, violates the fragile balance of forces and is 
fraught with global cataclysms. 
  Too many people in Russia and the world are not interested 
in 
the stabilization of the Euro-Asian space of the former Soviet 
Union and Russia, as well as in the restoration and 
strengthening of its might, said Dudayev. 
  "After a thorough analysis of the situation I came to the 
conclusion that the restoration of the CIS defensive power and 
Russia's status as a great power is the only way out of the 
imbalance of forces taking shape in the world, said Dzhokhar 
Dudayev.

<F P=106> [Report by Gennadiy Sobolev: "Tired of Confrontation in </F>
Groznyy. Discussion of Russian President's Directive in 
Chechnya"] 
  [Text] Chechnya President Dzhokhar Dudayev has announced 
that his analysis services are carefully studying Boris 
Yeltsin's directive ordering the Russian Government to hold 
consultations with the North Caucasus Republic. In Groznyy they 
are also tired of confrontation, and, presumably, time is on the 
side of those who are prepared to seek compromises. But the 
upcoming talks will be complicated by two facts: Moscow will 
demand that Chechnya acknowledge that it is a component of the 
Russian Federation and, moreover, the Russian leaders are still 
in contact with political forces in opposition to Dudayev. But 
these facts are an increasing irritant to Dudayev and his 
associates. 
  Certainly, one cannot regard as coincidental the fact that 
in 
these past few days the Chechnya state security department has 
received an order to deploy its subunits. The point is, 
according to Ayub Satuyev, the department's deputy chief, the 
opposition could become more active next week. "The leadership 
has the strength and resources to curb the enemies of the 
people, and we will adopt the toughest measures with regard to 
the opposition," he said. 
  But the opposition, which intends to hold its own meeting in 
Moscow next week, is accusing certain circles in the Russian 
leadership of attempting, as Abdulla Bugayev, leader of the 
"Marsho" party said, to "find a compromise with the Dzhokhar 
Dudayev regime, ignoring the interests of the Chechen people and 
of the republic's entire multinational population." 
  "One should realize that the people are tired of Dzh. 
Dudayev's tyrannical regime and of Moscow's inconsistent and 
unclear position," one Chechen opposition leader said. 
"Otherwise there will be a spontaneous explosion and the 
consequences could be very serious." 
  A. Bugayev called for free, democratic elections in 
Chechnya, 
involving all social and political forces. "Chechnya democratic 
forces do not intend to retreat from this position, even if the 
Russian Federation Federation Council or some other organ of 
authority decides to declare the Dzhokhar Dudayev regime legal," 
A. Bugayev said. 
  Not that all Chechen opposition figures are that resolute. 
Yaragi Mamodayev, head of the republic government of people's 
confidence, urged the leaders of all political forces and 
movements in Chechnya to achieve national reconciliation and 
work out a common position at the upcoming talks with Russia. 
  Commenting on Boris Yeltsin's directive, Ya. Mamodayev said: 
"My government of people's confidence believes that the Russian 
side's efforts to work not only with Dzhokhar Dudayev, but also 
with opposition political movements could result in a deeper 
political split in Chechnya and could complicate the already 
fragile negotiating process. For that very reason we are urging 
all our compatriots not to split into pro- and anti-Dudayev 
factions, but to subordinate their personal or group ambitions 
to national interests in order to deliver Chechnya from total 
crisis after it has been through so much." 
  Ya. Mamodayev believes that no single political movement or 
group of forces can objectively express the will of the entire 
people. So, he said, we are proposing to hold a congress of the 
Chechen people in the very near future to get to grips with the 
problems of the relationship between Russia and Chechnya.

  [Text] Moscow, 22 Apr -- Supplies of electricity from 
Russia to Chechnya have not been halted. Electricity is being 
supplied to Chechnya as before, an ITAR-TASS correspondent was 
told today by Fedor Morozov, head of the central control room of 
the Yedinaya Energosistema Rossii Russian shareholding company. 
He said 50 MW of electricity is reaching Chechnya from Russia 
hourly. 
  Russian power engineering people did not register any 
alterations to these parameters today. Fedor Morozov thinks 
that it is so far impossible to understand the reason behind the 
recent reports that electricity supplies to Chechnya were cut 
off, since at about 1100 Moscow Time the central control room's 
communications with Chechnya went down and it has not been found 
possible to restore them. It cannot be ruled out that several 
customers may have been cut off, but a decision of this kind 
could only have been made by Chechnya's local power grid.

  [Text] An agreement on cooperation in the economic, 
scientific, technical, and sociocultural spheres has been

Luzhkov. 
  The delegation visited a number of cities in the republic, 
familiarized itself with the economy, toured construction 
projects, and visited the Caspian "Dagdizel" Plant, where a

of conversion, and opportunities for cooperation with Moscow 
plants.

<F P=106> [Viktor Kostyukovskiy report: "Kuzbass: From Strikes to </F>
Constructive Actions"] 
  [Text] Kemerovo -- A. Tuleyev, chairman of the Kemerovo 
Oblast Legislative Assembly, and M. Kislyuk, head of the oblast 
administration, have signed a treaty on accord and joint actions. 
  Strictly guided by Russia's Constitution and laws and the 
oblast's legislative acts, and steadfastly observing the 
principle of the separation of powers, they have agreed to be 
guarantors of accord and constructive activity in the Kuzbass, 
help boost the revenue section of the oblast budget, and pursue 
a coordinated social policy. The struggle against crime and 
corruption is regarded as one of the main areas of joint 
activity. Paragraph 11 of the treaty is highly indicative in 
this regard: "In criticism of one another, to strive to be 
completely proper and constructive and to prevent the use of 
information based on conjecture and rumor." 
  The heads of the authorities have urged the Kuzbass 
population to civil peace and accord which, as the document 
says, "will make it possible to transform the region from 
`striking Kuzbass' into `creative Kuzbass'." 
  But what about the responsibility for observing the spirit 
and letter of the treaty? "At the moment it is moral and 
ethical," M. Kislyuk acknowledged. Meanwhile, the mechanism of 
responsibility for the treaty and documents to develop it in the 
future will have to be elaborated by the oblast Legislative 
Assembly. 
  It is well known that A. Tuleyev and M. Kislyuk, men of 
differing and in some ways diametrically opposed political 
views, opposed each other most strenuously on virtually all 
matters of principle in the recent past, a time characterized by 
a fierce struggle between the two branches of power. However, 
approximately a year ago they agreed to work together in all the 
main areas where they have common viewpoints and to seek 
compromises in those areas where they do not -- without 
abandoning their political standpoints. Thus the present treaty 
is not a sensation but rather a further development of that 
policy.

  [Text] Vladivostok April 25 TASS -- The commander of 
Russian border troops, Colonel-General Andrey Nikolayev, 
completed an inspection tour of Russian Pacific frontiers. 
After his visit to Sakhalin, Kamchatka and the maritime 
territory, he firmly said that Russian border guards are fully 
combat-capable. 
  Nikolayev held consultations with maritime territory head 
Yevgeniy Nazdratenko on strengthening cooperation between border 
troops and civil population to guard natural resources. 
  Nazdratenko stressed at the meeting that it is high time to 
put an end to the pillage of the Russian Far East: Chinese 
poachers rapaciously pick up jinseng in the Ussurian Taiga, 
while Japanese, Polish, Chinese, North and South Korean 
fishermen illegally fish in the Russian sea economic zone. 
  However, the first days of the poach-control dragnet have 
shown that, apart from foreigners, Russian fishermen are also 
guilty of rapacious attitude to natural resources. The 
coastguard service detained several Russian ships which had no 
fishing licences. 
  Nikolayev departed for Khabarovsk on Monday.

  [Text] Cherkessk April 24 TASS -- Elections to the people's 
assembly of the North Caucasian republic of 
Karachayevo-Cherkessiya, scheduled for Sunday, became 
unnecessary. The People's Assembly, which was designed to 
radically transform the republic's legislative power, has been 
already formed: This name was assumed by the republican 
parliament under a decision taken by its session. 
  Official elections to the People's Assembly will be held 
after Karachayevo-Cherkessiya passes its constitution. It is to 
be drafted by the National Council and then submitted for the 
people's discussion. 
  The same decision by the parliament made unnecessary a 
republican referendum also scheduled for Sunday. Put to 
people's vote was the question about the need for presidency in 
Karachayevo-Cherkessiya. When passed, the constitution will 
solve this problem. 
  Primarily, the decision to hold elections to the People's 
Assembly and a referendum in the republic was taken by the 
republican parliament last year. But then it was revised at the 
initiative of the republic's major political parties and mass 
movements which decided that it would be difficult to build 
truly effective bodies of government without a constitution.

  [Text] St. Petersburg, 23 Apr -- The project to build a 
port in the Ust-Luga firth certainly is in line with Russia's 
national interests and fully meets the economic needs of the 
Russian Federation, said Yevgeniy Fedorov, chairman of the State 
Duma Security Committee, at today's parliamentary hearings in 
St. Petersburg. Leading experts of the State Duma and of the 
Leningrad Oblast government, representatives of design bureaus, 
and environmental and financial organizations took part in these 
hearings on the construction of a major port complex in the 
Russian northeast. 
  Speaking of the economic importance of the new port, experts 
recalled that due to the absence of communications networks 
allowing a quick access to wold markets, $16 billion that could 
be earned through exports are being "mothballed." 
  Ilya Baskin, chairman of the bord of directors of the 
Ust-Luga joint-stock society, told ITAR-TASS that the project's 
total cost is $2 billion and that the port will be built within 
five to six years. He said that the society is now actively 
establishing the environmental monitoring system, building a 
complex of water- cleansing and environmentally safe 
installations, creating a network of mobile facilities for 
industrial waste disposal, and building housing for specialists. 
  The deputies' corps approved, by and large, the project to 
build the port in the Ust-Luga firth of the Gulf of Finland. 
The joint- stock society Ust-Luga has been advised, however, to 
take notice of all possible environmental consequences of this 
human intervention into this region of Russia's maritime 
northwest.

<F P=106> [Sergey Krayukhin report: "Modernized Pulkovo-2 Airport Up </F>
to International Standards"] 
  [Text] St. Petersburg -- The modernization of Pulkovo-2, 
Russia's second airport in terms of importance and size, is 
complete. 
  The cost of the work, which began four years ago, has been 
estimated at $14 million. The modernization of the airport and 
its terminal was paid for by the "Pulkovo" aviation enterprise, 
which did not take a single kopek from the city budget. The 
modernization of Pulkovo-2 will make it possible not only to 
improve the quality of passenger services but also considerably 
to increase the airport's handling capacity. St. Petersburg now 
has direct flights to 27 cities in Europe and can cope with a 
maximum of 5 million passengers a year. Meanwhile the airport's 
increased capacity will be sufficient for three years. The 
construction of Pulkovo-3, a major new airport on the banks of 
the Neva, will begin in 1997.

  [Text] Vilnius, Apr 22, BNS -- More than 53 percent of 
Lithuania's people work in the private sector, but the 
contribution of private enterprises to economic growth and 
efficiency is still hardly felt, Lithuanian President Algirdas 
Brazauskas said in his speech at an international conference in 
Bucharest Friday [22 April]. 
  The four-day Crans-Montana conference, devoted to 
all-European and regional problems, is attended by 
representatives of 86 countries and 19 international 
organizations. 
  In his speech, Brazauskas said the Lithuanian gross domestic 
product constantly decreases: by 3 percent in 1990, by 13 
percent in 1991, by 38 percent in 1992 and by around 35 percent 
in 1993. He said a major problem is that the part of the GDP 
consumed inside the country is growing: 75 percent in 1991, 80 
percent in 1992 and around 85 percent in 1993. 
  The president said attempts to liven up the investment 
process in Lithuania have been unsuccessful so far. Brazauskas 
noted that profit taxes were reduced three times in order to 
stimulate investments from internal sources. In his words, the 
part of profit or income used for investments may be completely 
exempted from taxes for 2 or 3 years. Brazauskas also noted 
that Lithuania intends to adopt a new law on foreign investments. 
  Discussing the initial stage of state property 
privatization, 
the Lithuanian leader said it will have to extended until the 
end of this year, even though it was supposed to be completed by 
July. Brazauskas said the process of privatization should be 
controlled more strictly. But "assertions by some political 
forces in Lithuania that privatization is hindered, state 
property is plundered and so on, are unfounded." 
  The president said "the mass of economically poorly educated 
shareholders" that formed in the process of privatization for 
investment checks "does not have any major influence on 
improving the management of enterprises." 
  Brazauskas said the standards of living began to improve, 
although slowly, after inflation and the rise in prices were 
slowed down last year.

  [Text] Commander in chief of the joint NATO force in 
northern Europe, General Garry Johnson, currently on a visit in 
Lithuania, said NATO is ready to increase its aid to the armed 
forces of the Baltic states. The aid will include both material 
assistance and consultations provided by specialists in various 
fields. 
  On Friday the NATO official was received by chairman of the 
Lithuanian parliament, Ceslovas Jursenas. The guest said that 
NATO member states are aware of and understand the concern of 
the Baltic states over their national security. This concern 
became ever more grounded owing to the unstable political 
situation in Russia. 
  In his turn, Ceslovas Jursenas said that Lithuania would 
feel 
more safe when Russia withdraws its troops from Latvia and 
Estonia. He appealed for NATO's support so that a pullout of 
Russian troops and the demilitarization of the Kaliningrad 
reagion would be accomplished sooner.

<F P=106> [Interview with Lithuanian President Algirdas Brazauskas by </F>
Maja Narbutt; place and date not given: "The Treaty Will Be 
Assessed by Future Generations"] 
  [Text] [Narbutt] The 
Polish-Lithuanian treaty will soon finally be signed; it has 
already been initialed. Why did the negotiations take so long? 
They started almost immediately after Lithuania regained 
independence in 1991. 
  [Brazauskas] Everyone both in Poland and in Lithuania knows 
the historical contacts between our states and nations. For 
ages everything has happened between us--both good and bad 
things. Therefore, the discussion was difficult and protracted. 
  The treaty negotiations were held in special circumstances. 
There is a certain category of people who think--I would 
say--that they love their homeland more than others. These 
people react in a very special way to anything that occurs in 
interstate relations. Not only with Poland, even though this 
problem really causes the greatest emotions. I also mean the 
relations with Russia. 
  [Narbutt] However, was it really not possible to complete 
the work on the treaty earlier? Was it not possible to abandon 
the demand of condemning "the Polish occupation of the Vilnius 
area" earlier? Everyone expected the new Lithuanian authorities 
to be more pragmatic than the nationalistic Sajudis; everyone 
expected that the negotiations would be accelerated. 
  [Brazauskas] When the Lithuanian Democratic Labor Party came 
to power after last year's presidential elections, relat point. 
[incomplete word, sentence as published]. Both parties had to 
take certain steps to find a solution that would be acceptable. 
This is when I realized that one cannot look into the past and 
that Poland did not want that. Let us look into the future, let 
us think about the future. 
  If everyone in Europe thought about the past--and in the 
past 
terrible things happened, such as World War I, World War II, the 
revolution, and civil wars--it would not be possible to live a 
normal life. 
  [Narbutt] You said much earlier that as far as Polish- 
Lithuanian relations are concerned, one should look into the 
future. You said this after the parliamentary elections, which 
your party won, in the fall of 1992. 
  [Brazauskas] A treaty is not agreed upon overnight, or 
within a month. When I became president, lying on my desk was a 
Lithuanian draft of the treaty which differed a lot from the one 
that will actually be signed. There were fundamental 
differences. Step by step we were removing the controversies 
that existed between Poland and Lithuania. 
  The treaty that President Walesa and I will sign will be 
assessed by historians, and future generations as well. They 
will evaluate the importance of the treaty, its significance for 
both our states and for Europe. 
  [Narbutt] The treaty with Poland was a subject of an 
internal political game in Lithuania. The government found 
itself under strong pressure from the rightist opposition, which 
demanded that the treaty include formulations which Poland could 
not accept. Do you not fear difficulties that may arise when it 
comes to the ratification in the Lithuanian parliament, as well 
as a wave of protests against the treaty, in which the past was 
referred to in one general statement about both countries' 
sorrow because of the use of force. 
  [Brazauskas] There are certain people, certain organizations 
that do not like the treaty. We have already started to explain 
to them why the treaty must be signed. There was no other 
solution--we had to regulate the relations with Poland. 
  If need be, we will explain this over and over again, until 
this gets across to them. 
  I do not think there will be any serious problems related to 
the treaty, any major protests. I would also like to stress 
that the treaty guarantees the interests of all the citizens of 
our states, irrespective of their nationality. 
  [Narbutt] Some of the Lithuanian politicians say out loud 
that "those who oppose the treaty with Poland push Lithuania 
into the arms of Russia." What do you think of such a statement? 
  [Brazauskas] Yes, I do agree with it in a way. In 
general, all disputes, all the misunderstandings between Poland 
and Lithuania clearly serve someone. Now, Lithuania wants to 
go, and is going, in the direction of the West, toward the 
European structures: NATO, European Union, Council of Europe. 
  I want to reiterate this: establishing relations with Poland 
is of great importance to us. 
  [Narbutt] The initialing of the Polish-Lithuanian treaty has 
been received with satisfaction in the declaration that ended 
the recent summit meeting of the presidents of the Baltic 
Republics in Palanga. It was also stated there that the treaty 
should be the first step to shorten the distance between the 
Baltic states and the Visegrad Group. 
  [Brazauskas] The four states of the Visegrad Group have 
developed more than we have. This results from the most recent 
history. The states united in the Warsaw Pact had more 
possibilities at their disposal than those states that were 
incorporated in the USSR. We want to be similar to you. Not 
only Lithuania, but also all the other Baltic Republics are 
interested in cooperation with the Visegrad Group--both 
political and economic cooperation. 
  [Narbutt] It seems that since the last elections the 
situation in Russia has been heading in a dangerous direction. 
What is your attitude toward the Russian foreign policy, toward 
the statements by Foreign Affairs Minister Andrey Kozyrev on the 
Baltic states and toward the theory of "close foreign states," 
as well as the "special interests" of Russia in the Baltic 
states? 
  [Brazauskas] What right does Russia have to make any claims 
to other states? Russia is a member of almost all the 
international organizations. It wants to be admitted to the 
Council of Europe. The Council of Europe demands high democratic 
standards. Such a test must be passed. We have already passed 
it--we have been admitted. 
  Such statements are unacceptable, absolutely inadmissible in 
today's world. And they cannot be put into effect as well. If 
they cannot be implemented, why say such things? In order to 
frighten someone? Who needs this? 
  Lithuania, Latvia, and Estonia have never volunteered to 
join 
the USSR. They were invaded. This is how it should be 
understood; any claims, speaking about zones of interest are out 
of place. Russia has taken such a strange approach not only 
toward the Baltic states, but also toward other countries. 
  [Narbutt] The concentration of Russian troops in the 
Kaliningrad Oblast must be cause for European concern, Lech 
Walesa stated during his recent visit to Latvia. This brought 
about an angry reaction from the Russian Ministry of Foreign 
Affairs. Soon afterward General Grachev, Russian minister of 
defense, stated that the Kalinigrad Oblast is "a special defense 
zone" of Russia. Does Lithuania have similar concerns as Poland 
does? 
  [Brazauskas] The Kaliningrad Oblast should be demilitarized. 
I agree with President Walesa. The concentration of troops 
always causes misgivings--I discussed this at the forum of the 
UN General Assembly. 
  The special location of the Kalinigrad Oblast should be used 
economically, not militarily. 
  Maintaining its military outpost by Russia in the west is 
not 
understandable, all the more so because Russia wants to join the 
"Partnership for Peace." 
  [Narbutt] As the second post-communist state, after Albania, 
Lithuania officially applied for NATO membership. As it is 
known, none of the states of our region have a chance to be 
admitted to NATO very soon. 
  [Brazauskas] We are not so naive as to believe that once we 
submit our motion, we will be admitted right away. We like the 
idea of the "Partnership for Peace" as an intermediate stage on 
the road to NATO. If the "Partnership" is joined by various 
states, it will not be indispensable for us to join NATO 
immediately. The dangers, which might exist in the 
international relations are automatically smaller. The 
"Partnership" will create a new security system. 
  I am definitely in favor of Russia's signing the 
"Partnership." Then it would be possible to look differently at 
many issues that we have mentioned. 
  [Narbutt] Before the presidential elections, you told 
RZECZPOSPOLITA that the president should be a man who restores 
agreement, reconciles those who are at odds. You have not 
managed to do that, have you? In the speech that summed up the 
previous year you said many bitter words about the opposition. 
  [Brazauskas] Representatives of the opposition have only 
just left my office. They often come to me and we talk. As far 
as the moods among the Lithuanian opposition are concerned, it 
must be remembered that they are quite peculiar. These are 
people who have done an awful lot for Lithuania; they helped 
Lithuania regain independence. They were supported by masses; 
they were not only in power, but on a pedestal as well. And 
then they lost. 
  However, it is not all that bad. There is social peace--even 
though we have many difficulties, such as low wages and low 
living standards. There is no hatred, no open conflicts. The 
opposition in Lithuania has every possibility of presenting its 
views. Have you noticed how extraordinarily democratic 
Lithuania is? The opposition is shown on television probably 
more frequently than those who are in power. 
  [Narbutt] Yes, indeed. And it often attacks you. Despite 
the attacks of the opposition, you are invariably the most 
popular politician of Lithuania. In all the opinion polls you 
occupy the first position, then for a long time there is no one. 
  [Brazauskas] For the time being. 
  [Narbutt] It is definitely difficult for you to talk about 
this, but how could you define the reasons for such popularity? 
  [Brazauskas] Popularity. I am wondering about it myself. 
Sociologists should answer this question; however, they only 
conduct polls. Now, why is it that one politician is backed by 
52-54 percent of the people, and another is supported by 6 
percent? I do not know. I am not concealing my 
biography--everyone knows it. I was a member of the party. 
Just like many others. I was elected the first secretary of 
the party when the movement of national rebirth started in 
Lithuania. Sajudis supported me. They saw something in me, 
they believed in me. At the first congress of Sajudis I was 
received as a kind of a hero. 
  [Narbutt] Does your political past never disturb you? 
  [Brazauskas] Membership in the party is a real burden for 
me. I knew that it would be so as soon as I was elected 
president. 
  [Narbutt] However, most Lithuanians do not evaluate you that 
harshly. I am again coming back to your popularity. 
  [Brazauskas] I am over 60 and I sometimes look back. A few 
years ago no one knew me, that is, the people did not know me, 
except the people that I worked with--those linked to the 
industry. Then it simply happened. Perhaps I said certain 
things louder and more boldly than others. Yes, certainly 
louder and more boldly. I was attacked for not saying right at 
the beginning that Lithuania should be fully independent. Well, 
I wanted each step to be fully considered. It had to be fully 
considered and it was. 
  [Narbutt] Your greatest success and your greatest failure. 
  [Brazauskas] Someone might say that my greatest success is 
that I am the president. I do not agree with that. It is not a 
success; it is responsibility. 
  The most recent period in the history of Lithuania began in 
1988--it was the beginning of the fight to regain independence. 
There were various moments. Also a moment when we--I mean, my 
party--were down at the very bottom. 
  The greatest success was that when we came to power over a 
year ago, we managed to continue the reforms--but not at the 
cost of the man in the street. This is very important. Nothing 
can happen at the cost of the people; the entire burden of the 
reforms should not rest on their shoulders. So far we have not 
spoiled anything; at any rate, the situation is certainly not 
worse. 
  What will happen next--we will see. Life does not end with 
one party. Anything may happen. Maybe new forces will emerge...

  [Text] Riga, Apr 22, BNS -- Latvian Prime Minister Valdis 
Birkavs received U.S. Ambassador Ints Silins who handed over a 
letter from his country's Vice President Al Gore, the Government 
Information Agency (VIA) told BNS on Friday [22 April]. 
  Silins reiterated the unambiguous support of the U.S. 
Administration for the March 15 initialed agreements on Russian 
troop withdrawal. The signing of the documents would allow 
international organizations to involve in the control of their 
implementation, Silins said. 
  Silins reconfirmed the United States' commitment to allot 2 
million dollars to dismantle the new building of the Russian- 
operated radar facility at Skrunda as soon as the withdrawal 
package is signed. 
  VIA failed to inform BNS about the content of Al Gore's 
letter but presumably it contains the same idea as Silins said.

  [Text] Riga, Apr 23, BNS -- If Latvia refuses to sign the 
whole package of initialed troop withdrawal documents, including 
the section on social guarantees of military retirees, Russia 
may halt the pullout indefinitely, said chief Russian negotiator 
Sergey Zotov. 
  "I can officially say that the question in that case will be 
about immediate suspension of Russian troop withdrawal from 
Latvia and cancellation of decision on Aug. 31 as withdrawal 
deadline," Zotov told a Latvian newspaper Friday [22 April]. 
  "The end of August is not far away and if the signing of all 
four agreements is longer delayed we will start to suspect 
Latvia of an intention to evade the signature," Zotov told the 
nationwide DIENA newspaper. 
  The Russian delegation head asked Latvians not to 
overdramatize the situation, though. He and his delegation plan 
to tour Riga next week to meet with Latvian negotiators. No 
concrete date for the meeting has been fixed yet. 
  The trip will be aimed at preparing the visit of Latvian 
President Guntis Ulmanis in Moscow during which he will meet 
with his Latvian counterpart Boris Yeltsin, said Zotov. 
  Zotov claimed that the day of the presidential summit was 
unknown yet but Latvian media reported earlier this week that 
the presidents would meet on April 30. 
  Latvian experts spent in Moscow three days this week and met 
with Russian colleagues in a bid to soften the agreement on 
social guarantees for military pensioners, sources told DIENA. 
  A source said that Latvia can hope for little and not 
serious 
changes in the agreement on Russian war pensioners, which grant 
them broad social guarantees, like easy access to residency 
permits. 
  As reported, Russia expected Ulmanis to sign the package 
April 21 but the Latvian parliament failed to adopt a decision 
authorizing him to do so.

  [Text] Riga, 22 April (LETA) -- Thursday [21 April] in the 
Latvian Foreign Ministry a news conference was held by the 
leader of a GATT working group, Finn Teilgard, who visits Riga 
to discuss the conditions of Latvia entering this organization 
with the Latvian Administration. In the course of his visit he 
met the Latvian prime minister, Valdis Birkavs, the Saeima's 
[parliament] chairman, Anatolijs Gorbunovs, and some Latvian 
ministers and experts. 
  Mr. Teilgard said that he told the Latvian Government about 
the six basic principles of this organization which is mainly 
purposed for the promotion of international cooperation and the 
development of trade among its 124 member country. The first 
condition providing the participation in GATT is that Latvia has 
to work out the memorandum on the state political and economic 
situations plus the documents reflecting the current external 
trade procedure in the country and send them to the GATT 
headquarters. 
  The leadership of GATT shows its understanding of the 
present 
economic situation in Latvia, and will take it into account when 
the issue of Latvia's participation in GATT is under discussion, 
Mr. Teilgard said.

meeting of the Latvian Government's head, Valdis Birkavs, with 
the delegation of the European Union [EU] was what issues Latvia 
wishes to discuss at the conference in Paris scheduled for late 
May and dedicated to the European stability pact. 
  The governmental information agency reports that Valdis 
Birkavs confirmed his willingness to take an active part in the 
European stability pact. Speaking on the issues Latvia would 
like to consider during the coming conference in Paris, the 
prime minister said Latvia is interested to involve into the 
discussion with other countries of the issues of national 
identity preserving, national minorities' integration into a 
society and teaching a state language. 
  Latvia would wish to view the possibility of launching the 
ombudsman institution. The issue of the repatriation of Russian 
military retirees is of the same importance and needs 
consideration in the context of the stability pact. All these 
matters Latvia would like to discuss at the multilateral talks. 
  Mentioning the issue of the borders with Russia, Birkavs 
expressed doubt whether it is comprehensive to discuss the issue 
at the coming conference and stressed the fact that Latvia is 
forming its stand basing upon the peace pact of 1920 between the 
two states.

<F P=106> [Article by Karlis Erglis: "Government Changes Law on </F>
Foreign Citizens"] 
  [Text] Riga, 14 Apr -- During its session today, the 
government adopted changes to the law "On foreign citizens and 
stateless persons visiting and staying in the Latvian Republic," 
as well as supplements to the law "On police" concerning the 
creation of an immigration police, within the framework of the 
state police. As was explained by Inese Birzniece, chairman of 
the Parliamentary Commission for Human Rights, the amendments 
which have been adopted in accordance with Article 81 of the 
Constitution, refer to people who have entered Latvia illegally, 
and they have been adopted with the purpose of establishing 
procedures for removing these people from the state. 
  The changes in the law, which are said to fully correspond 
with the CSCE mission in Latvia, are not yet accepted in their 
full form, therefore it was impossible to learn today the 
precise procedure for deportations and possible appeals. 
However, as we were told by I. Birzniece, "it is out of the 
question that some mass deportations could take place." It is 
stated in the amendments that they do not apply to people whose 
legal status in Latvia is not clear, and regarding whom the 
legislative process has not yet been completed. I. Birzniece 
emphasized that the draft law on the status of noncitizens 
should be accepted as soon as possible. 
  According to the changes, the border guards and state police 
will have the sole right to deport the above mentioned people, 
whereas these individuals shall have the right to appeal the 
decision to the director of the Immigration Department or in a 
court of law, I. Birzniece explained to DIENA. 
  According to a report by Edvins Inkens, the minister for 
special assignments, at a press conference, 400 people were 
deported from Latvia last year. There was not a single appeal 
submitted in any of the cases, which proves that the 
deportations were correct and well based.

  [Excerpt] Tallinn, Apr 22, BNS -- Estonian Defense 
Minister Indrek Kannik ended today his official visit to 
Ukraine. During the visit Kannik and his Ukrainian counterpart, 
Gen. Vitaliy Radetskyy, signed an agreement on cooperation 
between the two countries' defense ministries. Kannik invited 
Radetskyy for a visit to Estonia. 
  Kannik told BNS today Ukraine's independence means also 
Estonia's independence. He said the relations between the two 
countries are steadily improving. 
  "Estonian-Ukrainian relations are reaching the stage of 
concrete cooperation," Kannik said. "The questions of possible 
weapons purchases will be solved on the expert level. We are 
very much interested in the agreement on conventional arms 
reduction Ukraine has signed," the defense minister told BNS. 
  "The Estonian-Russian and Ukrainian-Russian relations have 
reached very delicate dimensions, so we need one another all the 
more," the minister claimed. 
  The agreement Kannik and Radetskyy signed on April 20 is a 
framework agreement that maps out different opportunities for 
cooperation in the defense sphere, including consultations on 
the formation and financing of defense forces and joint action 
within NATO's Partnership for Peace program. 
  Other issues discussed at the meeting of the defense 
ministers included international peacekeeping operations, the 
state of Estonian-Russian and Ukrainian-Russian relations, 
division of the former Soviet Black Sea Fleet, and tensions 
around the Crimean peninsula. 
  The Ukrainian defense minister told BNS Russian troops must 
leave Estonia by the proposed withdrawal deadline of Aug. 31, 
1994. "Russian military bases on your territory are your 
domestic affair and the decision whether to retain them is up to 
you," he noted. Radetskyy did not support granting Russian 
military retirees a special status in Estonia. [passage omitted]

  [Text] Tallinn, Apr 22, BNS -- Estonian Prime Minister 
Mart Laar, who is on an official visit to the United States, met 
yesterday with the U.N. Secretary General Butros Butros-Ghali. 
  Butros-Ghali was pleased with Estonia's participation in the 
formation of the Baltic peacekeeping battalion. He promised his 
assistance to Estonia, if needed, in issues related to the 
withdrawal of Russian troops from the country. Butros-Ghali 
said the United Nations attaches great importance to forging 
ties with new member states. 
  Laar informed the U.N. secretary general about the recent 
International Labor Organization anniversary conference in 
Tallinn and Estonians' participation in peacekeeping missions in 
the Nordic countries' peacekeeping units. 
  The Estonian premier also gave a survey of Estonia's recent 
history, the reforms in society and the problems related to the 
continued presence of Russian troops in the country, such as 
increase in troop-related crime, enormous damage to the 
environment, and the danger posed by the Paldiski nuclear 
reactors. 
  Laar touched briefly on the general need to take into 
account 
and protect the interests of small countries, especially with a 
view to their security. 
  The U.N. secretary general affirmed that the organization 
represents the interests of all its member states. He 
underscored the importance of the participation of an Estonian 
delegation in the upcoming U.N. conferences and summit meetings. 
  Laar continued his visit to the United States in Boston. He 
talked at Harvard University about Estonian economy. 
  The Estonian premier is accompanied by Foreign Ministry 
Chancellor Indrek Tarand, his private secretary Toomas Kiho and 
adviser to the government Ardo Hansson. 
  Laar returns to Estonia on April 25.

<F P=106> [From 22 April EESTI SENUMID, PAEVALEHT, p 1; "News </F>
Bulletin" No. 77/94] 
  [Text] Friday, April 22 -- Representatives of 
parliamentary foreign affairs commissions of eleven countries 
met in Tallinn yesterday to discuss their role in the shaping of 
foreign policy. 
  The commission chairmen meeting held a news conference 
yesterday, describing the issued discussed and the results of 
the meeting. Chairman of the Riigikogu [parliament] foreign 
affairs commission and initiator of the meeting Vello Saatpalu 
described the topics as the making of foreign policy by the 
different arms of power, the technology of foreign policy and 
the role of traditions and laws. Estonia has an excellent 
opportunity to take over the best experience of existing 
systems, he stressed. 
  Riigikogu Vice-chairman Tunne Kelam pointed out that 
representatives of various political systems were represented, 
enabling to learn about different foreign political traditions. 
  Saatpalu criticised some examples of Estonia's recent past 
when vital decisions had been made without involving all the 
relevant institutions and cited the example of Russia where the 
positions of the president, the foreign minister and the defence 
minister can widely differ. He hoped that such meetings will 
become regular. 
  Foreign Minister Juri Luik and Tunne Kelam met Chairman of 
the Swedish parliamentary foreign affairs commission Daniel 
Tarschys, who was recently elected new Secretary General of the 
Council of Europe [CE]. They discussed the future of the CE and 
the Estonian-Russian relations. Tarschys stressed that Russia 
will have to meet the CE requirements before joining the 
organisation, including the one allowing member states to keep 
their troops in other countries only with the consent of these 
countries.

  [Text] Tallinn, Apr 23, BNS -- Ambassadors Jaak Joeruut of 
Estonia and Bela Javorszky of Hungary exchanged Friday [22 
April] in Helsinki letters of ratification of the 
Estonian-Hungarian friendship and cooperation agreement, the 
Foreign Ministry press service told BNS. 
  The two countries declare in the pact that their relations 
are based on international legal norms and the principles of 
sovereignty and territorial integrity, equal rights, 
noninterference in one another's internal affairs, 
good-neighborliness, mutual trust, and advantageous cooperation. 
  The parties keep in mind that the security of Estonia and 
Hungary is inseparably linked with the security of all states 
participating in the Conference on Security and Cooperation in 
Europe process. 
  Both states are prepared to engage in effective cooperation 
in international organizations and they attach great importance 
to developing collaboration between their legislative and 
executive bodies, the local government level included. The 
foreign ministers of the two countries must meet at least once a 
year to discuss, among other issues, the implementation of the 
effective pact. 
  The parties to the agreement pledge to coordinate their 
efforts in mutually advantageous economic cooperation and to 
promote business contacts and direct links. The agreement 
provides for all- round cooperation in transport, easing of 
passenger and goods transport regulations and passport and 
customs checking procedures, and development of tourism. 
  Close cooperation is foreseen in improving data processing 
and communications systems, in science, technology and 
environment protection, and all spheres of culture. Under the 
agreement, Estonia and Hungary will take steps to protect ethnic 
minorities. They also state their readiness for concerted action 
against organized crime, terrorism and drug traffic.

  [Text] Tallinn, Apr 22, BNS -- Estonia is ready to go 
ahead with the dismantling of the nuclear reactors in Paldiski, 
Juri Tikk, the special government representative in Paldiski, 
told BNS. 
  Tikk thought the dismantling of the reactors and removal of 
nuclear fuel from Estonia might start early in May. He said the 
Russian side has run into some difficulties with the technical 
side of the operation, which prevents it from setting things in 
motion. The Russian customs officials at Kingissepp have 
detained a container without which the dismantling cannot begin, 
Tikk claimed. 
  The government representative said that a Russian landing 
ship stands ready in Paldiski's South Port to receive the parts 
of the dismantled reactors. 
  Russia wants to conclude a joint agreement on the removal of 
fuel and on the dismantling of the reactors. Estonia stands 
firm that both operations must be regulated by separate 
treaties. "We still don't know how (Russia plans) to handle the 
dismantling of the reactors and their removal from Paldiski," 
Tikk said. But, he said, the removal of nuclear fuel has been 
finalized down to the last detail. 
  BNS has information nuclear fuel will be removed from 
Paldiski by rail. Tikk declined to conform or deny the report. 
"Whichever kind of transport is used, safety will be guaranteed 
in any case," he stated. 
  Tikk claimed the most hazardous stage of the operation is 
opening of the reactor lid. "Yet, even if radioactive vapor 
should escape, it won't pose a very great danger since the cloud 
will disperse soon," he maintained. 
  Jan Christer Lindhe, a researcher from the Swedish National 
Radioactivity Protection Institute, also voiced the opinion that 
the reactors don't constitute a big threat to the environment. 
"It's more of a political problem," he claimed. 
  "Should an accident occur, we shan't keep it secret," Tikk 
declared. Estonia monitors continuously the radiation level 
around the reactors and if something occurs there that the 
Russian side would like to hush up, Estonia will spread the news 
through all mass media channels. 
  The Estonian Government decided on April 12 to enforce a 
special regime on the Pakri peninsula where Paldiski is situated 
to ensure the safety of the dismantling operation and the 
population.

3, 4; "News Bulletin" No. 76/94] 
  [Text] The 10 right-wing parties and organisations that 
met in Tallinn on Tuesday [19 April] formed a new organisation 
"Parem Eesti" (Better Estonia), a news conference was told 
yesterday ("Parem" can mean both "better" or "rightwing" in 
Estonian and a founding member Hellar Grabbi claimed the 
ambiguity to be deliberate). 
  The activists of the new organisation stressed that they did 
not invite the ruling coalition members, since their policy has 
been disappointing. Another fringe party, the Future Estonia 
Party, refused to participate because of ideological difference. 
Negotiations with some other organisations are in progress, but 
the results have not been disclosed yet. One of the initiators, 
Juri Estam, stressed that the organisation will not cooperate 
with right-wing extremists, referring to the Patriotic Central 
Union. 
  The initiators denied having formed the organisation for 
improving their chances at the elections; the aim was to 
actually restore the Estonian nation state, the organisation 
statement read. A political party or an electoral union may be 
formed, but there is no firm decision on that issue as yet. 
  The "Better Estonia" intends to use decolonisation and 
desovietisation in order to achieve its aims. Green Party 
chairman Juri Liim stressed that they intend to employ 
"civilised decolonisation" by appealing to the Russian 
Government to recall its colonists. A thorough investigation of 
the activities of the Communist Party and the KGB and the GRU 
[Soviet Army Intelligence] in Estonia was also mentioned as an 
important part of the programme. Further items include rapid 
return of land and property to the legal owners and support to 
private ownership. 
  The organisation denounced the draft law of the Tallinn City 
Council recommending that all persons registered as permanent 
residents of Tallinn as of 1 July 1990 be granted permanent 
residence permits. The council is exceeding its authority, the 
"Better Estonia" declared.

  [Text] The government of Armenia favors the establishment 
of a universal currency for the CIS. Vardan Movsisyan, the 
republic's deputy minister of economy, said this today at a news 
conference. He disclosed that [words indistinct] was proposed to 
the members of the CIS economic union within the framework of 
the convention on the establishment of a single CIS payments 
union signed on 15 April this year in Moscow. 
  Movsisyan said the idea of establishing a universal currency 
for the CIS similar to the European ECU [European Currency 
Unit], envisages the creation of a financial reserve at the CIS 
Interstate Bank. Each republic would make a pro rata payment 
into this reserve, based on its GNP. 
  The deputy minister believes that this would enable the CIS 
states to survive the payments crisis, and would also be an 
effective way to establish exchange rates between the soft 
currencies of the CIS and to make them convertible among each 
other.

<F P=106> [Sergey Bablumyan report: "Emigration from Armenia Has </F>
Assumed Character of National Disaster"] 
  [Text] Yerevan -- The "Unity" [Yedinstvo] Armenian 
independent trade union has called on the people of Yerevan to 
take to the city's streets on 1 May to announce to the 
authorities their determination to launch a struggle for the 
nation's survival. 
  The trade union's leaders illustrated the reality of 
national 
catastrophe with some quite impressive figures. A family of 
four now needs 2,500 drams to buy bread, salt, sugar, kerosene, 
and soap. The minimum wage in Armenia is just 176 drams -- less 
than $1. 
  Unemployment is rising rapidly in the republic as a result 
of 
the collapse of the economy, and mass emigration from Armenia is 
assuming the character of a national disaster. 
  Just recently Armenia itself used to admit and accommodate 
Armenian expatriates from many countries. The last of them -- 
an Armenian from Iran -- returned home in November 1991. Since 
then the traffic has been one-way, out of Armenia. Various 
figures are cited, reflecting the process of emigration from the 
republic -- between 300,000 and 800,000 in the past year. It is 
not easy to keep a precise account of the numbers leaving 
because the majority of them retain their residence permits, 
thus confusing the sociologists' and statisticians' charts. 
However, for a republic with a population of just 3 million, 
the departure of even 300,000 people is too much. And whereas 
people closed their eyes to this fact until recently, it is now 
causing serious concern to the authorities who are worried by 
the easily predictable demographic and social consequences of 
the mass exodus. 
  The first to feel those consequences are surely the military 
commissariats, which have received less than the expected number 
of draftees and older military reservists summoned to training 
camp. But even if the national army, which is in its formative 
stage, has somehow managed to cope with this task, you cannot 
say the same for the economic sphere. 
  At the moment the majority of enterprises are in a state of 
enforced idleness. But soon, when the machinery starts working 
at last, there will simply be no one to operate it. Many plants 
in Armenia today are staffed primarily by people of 
preretirement age who are coming to the end of their working 
lives. The younger and more energetic people are going into 
commerce which, incidentally, could only benefit everyone if 
they were starting up business on their own land instead of far 
from their native land. 
  It is not only entrepreneurs who are seeking their fortune 
in 
countries far and near but also construction workers, engineers, 
doctors, and teachers. These are mainly young or middle-aged 
people who in a certain sense constitute the hope and flower of 
the nation. You can find many of them today in the consular 
section of the Russian Embassy in Yerevan. They are trying to 
legalize their residence in Russia by obtaining Russian 
citizenship. The endless lines of people waiting to receive the 
relevant stamp in their passport have forced the consulate to 
temporarily stop accepting applications. Meanwhile the number 
of applicants for Russian citizenship continues to rise.... 
  Armenian emigres prefer to settle in Moscow, Krasnodar, 
Stavropol, and Rostov. However, they are also seeking and 
finding shelter in other less promising regions in the belief 
that things cannot be worse than they are here. 
  The number of people wanting to go to the United States, 
Europe, and countries in the Near and Middle East has increased 
considerably. Besides the language barrier there is another 
obstacle on the road to the outside world, and that is the 
obvious reluctance of those countries to give refuge to these 
unfortunates with no capital of their own. 
  "In Armenia today there are 107,000 officially registered 
unemployed, 652,000 pensioners, 300,000 refugees, and around 
100,000 invalids. Another 100,000 are living below the poverty 
line and need immediate help," Ashot Yesayan, Armenia's minister 
of labor and social security, explained. 
  These difficult times for Armenia cannot go on indefinitely 
but the sooner all those who have been forced to leave their 
land return, the sooner they will end. For the moment, however, 
the windows in many homes in Yerevan remain dark even on those 
rare evenings when the electricity supply is switched on. There 
is simply no one to switch the lights on.

<F P=106> [Report by Menzere Sadikova from National Assembly session </F>
held in Baku on 22 April--recorded] 
  [Text] [Begin Sadikova recording] Chairman of the 
Parliament Rasul Guliyev informed the deputies during the 
morning session of the National Assembly that an Azerbaijani 
parliamentary delegation headed by him will visit Moscow on 25 
April for talks with the Russian leaders, who want to act as a 
mediator in a peaceful settlement of the Azerbaijani-Armenian 
conflict. Talks will also be held at the Russian Duma during 
the four-day visit. Therefore, he said, it would be appropriate 
if the assembly first debated the relevant draft document 
presented at the latest meeting of the CIS heads of state in 
Moscow. 
  The speaker's proposal was accepted. Before discussing the 
agenda, the deputies heard a report from the republic's defense 
minister on the situation at the front during the past 10 days. 
  Afterwards, the session approved the agenda, which included 
the bills on [words indistinct] and the draft agreement 
submitted by Moscow on ending the armed conflict and eliminating 
its consequences. 
  Speaking at the parliament, Foreign Minister Gasan Gasanov 
explained in detail the draft agreement on ending the armed 
conflict and eliminating its consequences, noted those 
provisions in this document unfavorable for Azerbaijan, and 
stated the position of our Foreign Ministry. Although a number 
of deputies firmly opposed the discussion of this draft at the 
parliament because many provisions in the proposed document are 
discordant with the Azerbaijani Republic's Constitution and laws 
and with the interests of the state and people, the majority 
supported its discussion. A proposal was made to draw up a new 
alternative document that would be in line with our Constitution 
and national interest. 
  During the afternoon session, the members of the parliament 
had a serious discussion of the draft agreement on ending the 
war and eliminating its consequences, which was proposed by 
Moscow and which the Armenian President Levon Ter-Petrosyan was 
ready to sign, and expressed their assessment and views. The 
general opinion was that holding peace talks is imperative and 
the necessary documents should be prepared and submitted to the 
mediating states. Our Foreign Ministry was asked to work on the 
discussed draft and bring it in line with Azerbaijan's national 
interests and Constitution. 
  Later, the National Assembly started debating the other 
issues on the agenda. [end recording]

  [Text] Baku, 23 Apr -- Azerbaijani President Geydar Aliyev 
and Sergey Baburin, the head of a Russian State Duma delegation 
and coordinator of the deputy's group Russian Path, who met 
today in Baku, spoke out in favor of restoring, developing, and 
strengthening ties between Azerbaijan and Russia. 
  On the issue of the situation of Russians in Azerbaijan, the 
president stressed that they are and always have been an 
integral part of society, citizens of the republic with full 
rights. He said that "Azerbaijan's multi-ethnicity, its 
different languages, and use of Russian in many spheres have 
played an important role in the development and making of the 
culture of the people of Azerbaijan." 
  Geydar Aliyev familiarized the Russian parliamentarians with 
the current situation in the conflict zone between Armenia and 
Azerbaijan. He said that Azerbaijan was making efforts toward a 
peaceful settlement of the conflict, but that the republic's 
interests have to be taken into account. Russia, in whom 
Azerbaijan holds great hopes, has not yet adopted a position in 
principle on this issue, he believes. 
  The leader of Azerbaijan believes that some progress in the 
peacekeeping process could be made if Russian President Boris 
Yeltsin were to visit the region. He said that this was 
proposed to the Russian leader and that Azerbaijan are ready to 
provide for his security during his stay here.

  [Text] Baku (April 22) TURAN -- Today the Milli Majlis of 
Azerbaijan began discussions concerning the settlement plan of 
Russia of the Azeri-Armenian conflict. 
  Rasul Guliyev, Speaker of the Azeri Parliament noted that 
this plan was proposed in the Moscow CIS leaders Summit on April 
14-15. 
  He also noted that he is due to leave for Moscow on April 
25, 
during which time the meeting with Armenian representatives will 
discuss the abovementioned document. 
  Gasan Gasanov, the Foreign Minister of Azerbaijan made a 
speech giving a summary of the settlement proposal. He noted 
that should Azerbaijan sign this document according to the 
version proposed by Moscow, Nagorno-Karabakh legally may leave 
Azerbaijan. 
  Gasanov also noted that "acceptance of the plan will give 
legitimacy to the ethnic cleansing of Karabakh and at the same 
time the cleansing of all local residents from the regions 
occupied by Armenians. The main fact is that the document does 
not provide for the return of Azerbaijanis to Karabakh. And it 
means that Azerbaijan will lose control of its vast territory" 
said Gasanov. 
  After the Azeri Foreign Minister's speech, most deputies of 
the Azeri Parliament called the plan "a cynical humiliation of 
the national dignity of Azerbaijan. This plan means that 
Azerbaijan will be one of humiliation before final capitulation." 
  The session of Milli Majlis will continue after the break.

  [Text] Baku April 25 TASS -- Three-hour talks between 
Turkish Foreign Minister Hikmet Cetin and Azeri President Geydar 
Aliyev were completed here late at night on Sunday. The meeting 
was mostly held behind closed doors. 
  The talks were focused on the Armenian-Azeri conflict over 
the disputed Nagorno-Karabakh enclave and ways for its 
settlement. According to the Azeri leader, efforts by 
international organizations, including the United Nations, the 
CSCE and its Minsk group, failed to produce any positive 
results. Seeking to end the protracted warfare by any means, 
the republic accepted Russia's mediatory initiatives. However, 
all attempts to solve the thorny problem have been in vain so 
far. The only obvious thing is that the Armenian side is 
forcing Azerbaijan to agree to its terms, which do not meet the 
republic's national interests, Aliyev emphasised. 
  The Turkish foreign minister believes that "the world 
community should at last understand clearly that Azerbaijan is 
forced to wage war in order to defend its territories." Cetin 
dismissed the principle of equal responsibility of both 
conflicting sides for the continued fighting, since "aggression 
is aimed against Azerbaijan." He pledged that "Turkey would 
uphold this position at all international forums." 
  The Turkish foreign minister told a news conference after 
the 
talks that "Armenia should meet the demands of U.N. Security 
Council resolutions, and to withdraw its troops from occupied 
Azeri lands immediately and unconditionally." In case it 
continues ignoring these demands, the world community should 
impose sanctions upon the republic, Cetin stressed. As for 
Turkey, it will not lift the embargo for supplies of foodstuffs 
and medicines to Armenia until the republic halts the aggression 
against Azerbaijan. 
  According to the Turkish foreign minister, the current 
deadlock in the peace process can be broken by convening a 
session of the Minsk conference. However, this is possible only 
in case of liberation of Azeri territories. Therefore, Russia, 
the United States and other Minsk group countries should step up 
their efforts to create conditions for the session to be 
convened. 
  Speaking about deployment of peacekeeping troops in the 
conflict zone, Cetin emphasised that "Turkey strongly believes 
these can be only international forces, not troops of any 
definite country." 
  The Turkish foreign minister assessed his short-term visit 
to 
the Azeri capital Baku as "very fruitful." According to his 
Azeri counterpart Hasan Hasanov, this visit testified to 
Azerbaijan's stable and consistent relations with Turkey, to 
which the republic gives top priority in its foreign policy.

  [Text] Baku (April 22) TURAN -- Last night Armenian troops 
continued attacking along the entire frontline, reports the 
press centre of Azerbaijan Defense Ministry. 
  The Armenian army attacked the southern section of the front 
(Fizuli-Beylagan) three times. The Azeri army managed to 
liberate the village of Ashagy-Abdurakhmanly and several 
strategically important heights. During the fighting three of 
Armenia's tanks and one military personnel carrier were 
destroyed and several dozens of Armenian soldiers were killed. 
The Azeri army captured five machine-guns, one flame-thrower 
cluster, four grenade discharger cups, and dozens of sub-machine 
guns. 
  Fierce fighting in the eastern direction (Agdam-Terter) of 
the front took place throughout the night where the Armenian 
army tried to break through the defense of the Azeri army. But 
attempts by the Armenian army failed since the Azeri army was 
subject to fire upon the position of Armenian troops in this 
direction. Approximately 50 Armenian soldiers were killed in 
this section of the front. 
  This morning the Armenian army fired upon the village of 
Tap-Karakayully of the Geranboy region. 
  At the same times border posts of the Azeri army in the 
Tauzskiy region were subjected to fire from the Idzhevanskiy 
region of Armenia.

  [Text] As before, the situation in the zone of the Karabakh 
conflict remains tense. The press service of the 
Nagorno-Karabakh defense army reported to Interfax that over the 
previous 24 hours active hostilities were being waged on the 
greater part of the confrontation line. Fierce hostilities do 
not stop at the south-eastern part of the Karabakh front where 
the Azerbaijani forces try to break the defense line on the 
Martunin and Fizuli directions being supported by a great number 
of armored vehicles and combat aviation. 
  According to the press service, last night Karabakh 
positions 
were attacked at two sections of Karabakh's Martunin region, 
near the populated center of Kuropatkino and in the region of 
Agburun. Experiencing great losses (according to preliminary 
information, as many as 50 soldiers were killed on mine fields), 
the Azerbaijani army managed to move forward and to seize three 
Karabakh posts. 
  However, in two hours, the Karabakh formations started a 
counterattack and by the morning of April 23 moved the adversary 
to his starting positions. The Karabakh army lost two people 
were killed and nine wounded in the course of these hostilities. 
  Simultaneously the headquarters of the Karabakh defense army 
refuted information of Azerbaijan's Defense Ministry stating 
that a great number of fighters had allegedly joined the 
Azerbaijani army. These reports have been qualified "as pure 
falsification intended to conceal facts of mass desertion of 
Azerbaijani soldiers." 
  The border of the former Nagorno-Karabakh autonomous region 
has been practically restored after the recent counterattack of 
the Karabakh forces which liberated six villages in the north of 
the Mardakert region, the leader of the Karabakh army press 
center Serzh Arushanian reported to Interfax. In his words, as 
of today only a small territory of the Mardakert region which 
includes several villages, including the largest village 
Leninavan in the north-east of the region is still under control 
of the Azerbaijani forces. 
  In addition, Arushanian said that the Shaumian region is 
still occupied though it has been part of Nagorno-Karabakh 
Republic since September 1991.

  [Text] During a successful counteroffensive on April 24, 
Karabakh formations destroyed the Azerbaijani firing points east 
of the regional center of Mardakert and the village of Talysh in 
the Mardakert Region, the Karabakh defense army's press service 
told INTERFAX. 
  Karabakh formations lost seven soldiers, a tank and an 
armored vehicle; 19 Karabakh soldiers were wounded. Azerbaijan 
lost 80 soldiers, three tanks and one armored vehicle. Another 
Azerbaijani tank was taken as a trophy. 
  According to the headquarters of the Karabakh army, the 
Azerbaijani units fighting in the northeast of the Mardakert 
Region are panic-ridden and the front has practically broken up. 
POWs say that Azerbaijani police units which acted as an 
anti-desertion force, were the first to flee. 
  According to the latest reports, in the morning of April 25 
there was no fighting in Karabakh. 
  Meanwhile, an informed source in the Azerbaijani Defense 
Ministry told INTERFAX that fierce fighting continued yesterday 
in the Geranboi, Terter, Agdam, and Fizuli regions of 
Azerbaijan. All Armenian attacks were rebuffed. The same 
source says that Armenians suffered large losses. 
  In the Fizuli Region, Azerbaijani units occupied a number of 
strategic heights not far from this regional center controlled 
by Armenians, said the source.

  [Text] Baku, April 23 (TURAN) -- A delegation from 
Russia's State Duma headed by Sergey Baburin has arrived in Baku 
at the invitation of the head of the Russian Community in 
Azerbaijan, Vladimir Zabelin. The mission, representing the 
faction of "Russia's Way" also includes deputies Ivan Anichkin, 
Anatoliy Grishnyavikov, Sergey Glotov. 
  This morning the delegation was accepted by Rasul Guliyev, 
the Speaker of Parliament of Azerbaijan where a wide range of 
discussions concerning the interparliamentary and 
intergovernmental questions were discussed. 
  Following the meeting the delegation was accepted by the 
Azeri President Aliyev. During the meeting Aliyev discussed 
future relations of Azerbaijan with Russia, and noted that "both 
countries are suffering difficult conditions where our joint 
efforts may help to eliminate the difficulties." 
  Speaking about the Armenian aggression, Aliyev said that "we 
had expected Russia to play a just and objective role". 
  Aliyev noted that the fates of more than one million Azeri 
refugees, whom many countries are helping. "Why is Russia not 
assisting the these Azeri refugees?" asked Aliyev. 
  The Azeri President also talked about the resumption of 
economic links between the two countries. "Today not only 
Azerbaijan, Russia, as well, is suffering from the break in 
economic links with us". 
  In reply, Sergey Baburin said that "today reviewing the 
Azeri- Armenian conflict there is a double standard, and I don't 
understand the position of those who speak about Azerbaijani 
aggression at the present when considerable territory of 
Azerbaijan has been seized." 
  Baburin said that the delegation is scheduled to visit to 
the 
front line and meet with refugees and report to the State Duma 
and commission leaders about the visit upon return. 
  The fact-finding mission's function is also to look into the 
situation of the Russian-speaking population in Azerbaijan. 
"Azerbaijan is the most favoured republic among the CIS 
countries in respect to this question". 
  Speaking of the establishment of economic ties, Baburin 
said, 
"that when the CIS countries re-establish contact amongst 
themselves or amongst countries abroad, and when Russia 
interferes in this process, this is bad for Russia."

  [Text] A Russian parliamentary delegation visiting Armenia 
was due to visit on Sunday the front line in the republic's 
current war with Armenia and Azerbaijan's districts along the 
Armenian border, the Azerbaijani parliamentary press service 
said. 
  It said the delegation, headed by Sergey Baburin, leader of 
the Russian Pan-National Union, planned to make a report on the 
situation in the war zone to the Russian parliament. 
  Baburin said in Baku on Saturday that he did not support 
Russia's official position on the Azerbaijani-Armenian conflict. 
He said the aggressor was easy to identify, "must be curbed" 
and leave the occupied lands. "The side which has seized the 
lands is the aggressor," he said, meaning Armenia, at a meeting 
with representatives of Azerbaijan's Russian-speaking community, 
who said both the Azerbaijani government and the country's 
society at large were friendly towards them. But they accused 
Moscow of pursuing a pro-Armenian policy, which, they 
complained, cast a shadow on that friendliness. 
  Baburin plans to return to Moscow on Monday.

National-Democratic parties. 
  "The goal of the alliance is to mobilize all forces of the

of the Azeri nation", according to the mission of the alliance

based on bribery", said the Chairman of "Boz Gurd" party, 
Bakhtiyar Akhmedov. 
  According to Iskander Gamidov, "Alliance differs from the 
Democratic Congress, other blocs and democratic parties. It 
gives first priority to the national problem."

  [Text] The final meeting in the Abkhazian-Georgian peace 
talks was held in Geneva yesterday. Despite maximum efforts 
made by Georgia, participants in this round of talks failed to 
reach a compromise over the definition of a political status for 
Abkhazia. The next round of talks will be held in Moscow on 10 
May. Russia will probably be able to influence Abkhazia at 
home. It has apparently had a chance of this before, too, but 
evidently waited for an appropriate moment and circumstances. 
  A compromise formula suggested by Russia and the United 
Nations will be discussed during the Moscow round of talks. 
This formula, which was proposed back in Geneva but not 
discussed, says that Abkhazia will be a subject which will be 
granted sovereign rights within a union state. There was not 
sufficient time for this formula to be discussed during the 
Geneva round of talks. However, sovereign rights and a union 
state sound a little suspicious. At least, this does not sound 
very encouraging for Georgia. It seems that the Georgian side 
is forced to recede from its positions both on the battlefield 
and at the negotiating table. 
  According to an official version, two documents will 
comprise 
the basis of the Moscow discussions. These will be the UN and 
Russian suggestions on the political and legislative basics of 
an all-embracing settlement and the establishment of a 
coordinating commission with the participation of the 
negotiating parties as well as UN and Russian diplomats. The 
coordinating commission is expected to be assigned to handle 
practical issues pertaining to supply, transport, and 
communications. 
  To cut a long story short, yet another round of negotiations 
is still to come and there is still something to pin hopes on. 
  Aleksandre Kavsadze, the Georgian head of state's personal 
envoy, is in hopeful mood, believing that there is a chance to 
come to an agreement about the deployment of peacekeeping forces 
in the conflict zone. He has added that Georgia insists on the 
deployment of these forces across the whole territory of the 
conflict in order to secure the safe return of Georgian refugees 
to their homes.

  [Text] Another round of Georgian-Abkhaz talks held last 
week in Geneva still did not produce any tangible results. 
Although the fact that the talks are being held at all is in 
itself a positive development. The Georgian side's position on 
the return of refugees to Galskiy Rayon remains unchanged: Their 
safety has to be ensured. As for Abkhazia's political status, 
the United Nations has produced a document on setting up a 
coordinating council, which is to operate until the conflict is 
completely settled. 
  It has also become known that Jaba Ioseliani, head of the 
Georgian delegation, has expressed resentment with the stand 
taken by the United Nations, which decided not to send its 
peacekeeping contingent to the area until this August. 
According to Ioseliani, it is quite possible that Georgia will 
accept the proposal put forward by the Russian Federation, which 
offered to send its forces to Abkhaz territory as soon as 
possible. 
  But in the view of Aleksandr Kavsadze, the head of state's 
personal envoy for the settlement of the conflict, all 
prerequisites exist even now for the UN Security Council to make 
a decision to deploy international peacekeeping forces on the 
entire territory of Abkhazia.

  [Text] Tbilisi, 23 Apr -- At nine o'clock yesterday Boris 
Kakubava, a deputy in the Georgian parliament and chairman of 
the Abkhazian Liberation Union, was abducted after he had taken 
part in an Alioni program on Georgian television. 
  Threatening to execute him, the kidnappers demanded that 
Boris Kakubava cancel the congress of the displaced Abkhazian 
population scheduled to he held in Tbilisi 23-25 April. The 
organizers of the terrorist act seem to be afraid that the 
congress could make the Georgian leaders' political course on 
the Abkhazian issue look negative. A probable tragic end has 
been prevented by the prompt intervention of the Abkhazian 
Liberation Union. 
  This, as well as other events (delegates of the congress 
have 
been denied transport by rayon authorities; transport routes 
have been closed), demonstrates a desire of the authorities to 
prevent the congress. 
  The Abkhazian Liberation Union places the entire 
responsibility for the incident and its consequences on the 
leadership of the Republic of Georgia. 
  This statement was made public by the press service of the 
Abkhazian Liberation Union at a news conference in Tbilisi on 23 
April.

Eduard Shevardnadze announced the beginning of a crackdown on 
terrorism and corruption. "Neither I nor the security service 
will rest until we catch the murderer of Deputy Interior 
Minister Giya Gulua," he was quoted as saying. 
  Shevardnadze called corruption "the biggest danger facing 
the 
country." He added that "it will devour all Georgia, and dreams 
of democracy will remain a fairy tale." 
  Shevardnadze instructed the Interior Ministry, security 
service, prosecutor's and judicial bodies and the whole 
government to develop a draft decree on tighter corruption 
controls, including specific tasks, within ten days.

  [Text] The Georgian head of state held a meeting with the 
heads of local administrations of Georgia yesterday. The 
meeting was opened by Teimuraz Pipia, head of the directorate of 
regional management, who considered problems of all rayons in 
one context. 
  Zurab Gegechkori [chairman of the state committee on land 
resources] spoke about the process of privatization. He said 
there were numerous problems in the issue of distributing land 
and moot problems pertaining to land issues that existed in 
relations between rayons had to be settled. He also pointed out 
there were instances of unlawful seizure of lands. 
  Next to take floor was Georgian Education Minister Tamaz 
Kvachantiradze, who spoke about problems pertaining to the 
system of education in rayons. He said salaries of school 
teachers had been considerably increased. Teachers working full 
time will earn 900,000 coupons [per month]. It was added that a 
promotion like this granted to teachers would not solve all 
problems existing in the system of education. The minister 
requested assistance from the heads of rayon administrations. 
  Other problems of rayons were also given consideration at 
the 
meeting. 
  In conclusion, Eduard Shevardnadze, Georgian head of state, 
made a speech. He made an appraisal of the meeting and set 
appropriate tasks and instructions for the heads of rayon 
administrations.

has received a letter from the Customs Committee of the Russian 
Federation signed by Kruglyakov, first deputy chairman of the 
committee. The letter says: Because the Republic of Georgia 
has been a member of the CIS since 1 March 1994, in accordance 
with the edict issued by the Russian Federation Customs 
Committee, the heads of its regional departments and customs 
houses have been officially instructed not to levy a tax in the 
form of VAT, special duties, and excise duties on goods produced 
in Georgia and carried from the Georgian territory retroactive 
to 1 March 1994. Money already paid for the above-mentioned 
taxes should be refunded from the customs house account or it 
can be applied to future payments.

  [Excerpt] Hanover (DDP/ADN) -- Uzbekistan is to open up to 
the market in a bigger way. The movement toward a market 
economy is to be speeded up by privatizing trade, opening up 
joint-stock companies to outsiders, and granting hard currency 
loans to private importers, Uzbekistan's Deputy Prime Minister 
Utkur T. Sultanov said at the Hanover trade fair today. 
  At the first German-Uzbek economic convention he explained 
further aspects of his government's reform package. Trading and 
service companies will in the future be sold at a new stock 
exchange which is to be established. Foreigners who acquire 
more than 50 percent of a company and manufacture consumer goods 
will be exempt from taxes for five years. The planned 
Uzbekinvest insurance company is to insure foreign investment in 
the future. There are also plans to abolish import duties from 
July 1995. 
  The economic convention was organized by the German Business 
East-West Trade Committee together with German industry's 
cooperation office. The convention's central topic was barter 
trade. [passage omitted]

  [Text] On 22 April the Ukrainian Defense Ministry press 
service issued a statement. It, in particular, says that 
despite the initially realistic nature of the sides' approaches 
to the fleet's quantitative indices at the negotiations in 
Sevastopol, the Russian side was trying to understate the 
numerical strength of the personnel of the Black Sea Fleet ships 
by more than two times. A well-reasoned stand of the Ukrainian 
military allowed to coordinate the quantitative parameters, 
including the lists of the Black Sea Fleet amphibious means, 
ships, and vessels that are to become part of the Ukrainian 
Naval Forces. 
  At the same time, the problem of the temporary basing of the 
Russian Navy on the Ukrainian territory failed to be solved, 
says the statement. The Russian side was insisting that the 
Russian Navy should be based at all the facilities in Crimea 
while Ukraine's Naval Forces should be based beyond the borders 
of the peninsula. The Ukrainian delegation provided a 
well-reasoned proof of the fact that a functioning naval fleet 
cannot be created without the Crimean bases. However, Russia's 
approaches remained unchanged. Moreover, says the statement, 
showing no wish to pay attention to common sense, to understand 
the legitimate stand of Ukraine regarding the basing of its own 
naval forces on its own territory, the Russian delegation 
terminated the negotiations and disappeared without any 
explanations. 
  The Ukrainian Defense Ministry press service is authorized 
to 
declare that the Ukrainian side regrets such a behavior of the 
Russian delegation, which does not comply with the norms of the 
international negotiations ethics. 
  Ukraine's Defense Ministry places all the responsibility for 
the breakdown of the negotiations upon the Russian side and 
reports its readiness to continue the disrupted negotiations at 
any time.

  [Text] The Ukrainian fleet is significant and it must be 
based in Sevastopol, People's RUKh [Ukrainian People's Movement 
for Perestroyka] leader, Vyacheslav Chornovil, told 
INTERFAX-Ukraine. 
  He said if Ukraine had to share with somebody military bases 
and a part of the fleet this must be carried out under generally 
recognized international principles. 
  Chornovil estimated the Ukrainian position at the talks as 
"the only right one." He considered the conduct of Russian 
Defense Minister Pavel Grachev as improper. Chornovil said this 
had once again manifested the "boorishness of a superpower." 
  He suggested that Russia's position at the talks had 
reflected its gradual pro-imperial policy. 
  Given that the U.S. possess "certain influence" and are 
interested in normalization of Russian-Ukrainian relations the 
U.S. mediation in settlement of the Black Sea Fleet issue could 
be useful, Chornovil said. 
  "Grachev would hardly slam the door if there were a U.S. 
representative at the talks," Chornovil suggested. 
  He said in Kravchuk's place he would have addressed the 
Russian president to make him show "his ministers their place." 
"A kind of demarche is definitely needed. Such an offense 
should not be ignored," Chornovil added.

<F P=106> [Report by ITAR-TASS correspondent Sergey Blagov] </F>
  [Text] Hanoi, 22 Apr (ITAR-TASS) -- The presidents of 
Russia and Ukraine have agreed that a friendship and cooperation 
treaty between the two countries must be drafted in the near 
future. This was stated in an ITAR-TASS interview today by 
Ukrainian Foreign Minister Anatoliy Zlenko who is paying an 
official visit to Hanoi. At their meeting in Moscow on 15 April 
the Russian and Ukrainian presidents instructed their foreign 
ministers to complete the preparation of the draft treaty. In 
this connection Leonid Kravchuk invited Boris Yeltsin, president 
of the Russian Federation, to pay an official state visit to 
Ukraine. The invitation was accepted. We hope that the 
interstate treaty will be signed during this visit, the 
Ukrainian foreign minister said. 
  Referring to the talks in Sevastopol between the Russian and 
Ukrainian defense ministers, A. Zlenko stressed that "the 
decisions adopted at the April meeting of the two presidents 
must be carried out." The accords already reached on dividing 
up the fleet and separate basing of the two countries' naval 
forces must be implemented. By adhering to these accords, 
without backing away from them, we can make progress toward a 
solution of the Black Sea Fleet problem. If, however, attempts 
to reinterpret the decisions made by the two presidents 
continue, I think we will again find ourselves deadlocked as we 
try to settle this "extremely complex" question, A. Zlenko noted.

  [Text] Sevastopol, 22 Apr -- An agreement in principle to

Sevastopol. 
  Of the 833 Black Sea Fleet ships and vessels, 669 units will 
go to Russia, which makes up nearly 85 percent. The Ukrainian 
side will receive 164 ships and boats. Moreover, proceeding 
from the previously reached accords, Russia will pay the Ukraine

  [Text] Sevastopol, 22 Apr -- An agreement in principle to 
divide the Black Sea Fleet was reached today at the talks 
between the military delegations of Russia and the Ukraine in 
Sevastopol. They were led by the two countries' defense 
ministers, Pavel Grachev and Vitaliy Radetskyy. 
  Of the 833 Black Sea Fleet ships and vessels, 669 units will 
go to Russia, which makes up nearly 85 percent. The Ukrainian 
side will receive 164 ships and boats (15 percent). Moreover, 
proceeding from the previously reached accords, Russia will pay 
the Ukraine compensation for 255 vessels. 
  No agreement has yet been reached on the problem of the 
separate basing of the fleets. Ukraine insists on siting the 
headquarters of its navy in Sevastopol, and does not rule out 
the basing of its ships there as well. 
  Army General Pavel Grachev, Russian defense minister, 
stressed that this stance deviates from the agreement signed on 
15 April in Moscow by Boris Yeltsin and Leonid Kravchuk. 
  The Russian minister declared that it is unlikely that a 
start can be made on dividing up the fleet without resolving the 
problem of the separate bases. 
  Pavel Grachev left Sevastopol for Moscow today.

  [Text] At the talks in Sevastopol Friday on the division of 
the Black Sea Fleet, the military delegations of Russia and 
Ukraine came to an agreement on the Fleet's division. In an 
exclusive interview to INTERFAX Ukranian Defense Minister 
Vitaliy Radetskyy said that 18.3 percent of the Fleet, or 164 
warships and other vessels, are to be handed over to Ukraine. 
  Radetskyy said that he had reported to President Kravchuk 
about the decision and the Ukrainian president backed it. 
Radetskyy said that Russia was ready to pay for the Ukrainian 
part of the fleet after it was divided 50-50. However, it is up 
to the governments to decide how payment should be effected, he 
said. 
  Radetskyy also said that Russia decided on which ships it 
needed proceeding from the tasks faced by the Black Sea Fleet. 
The remaining vessels will be written-off or sold, he said. 
  Earlier, spokesman for the Ukrainian Defense Ministry, 
Aleksandr Kluban, told reporters that the split up would affect 
833 warships on active duty and 61 reserve ships. Out of this 
number 18.3 percent or 164 ships will belong to Ukraine. The 
remaining 31.7 percent of ships out of Ukraine's 50 percent are 
to be sold to Russia, in line with the earlier agreements. 
  Ukraine, said the spokesman, proposes that the matter should 
be settled by the signing of an agreement. The draft agreement 
is ready and will possibly be signed on 22 April. 
  Radetskyy said that still unresolved is the issue of bases 
for the Black Sea Fleet and the Ukrainian naval force. He said 
that both Ukraine and Russia have proposals on that score. He 
believes that the delegations should not leave Sevastopol 
without solving the problem. 
  Meanwhile, Kluban said that there are difficulties in 
discussing the issue. Russia proposes to base its fleet at all 
Crimean bases (Sevastopol, Balaklava, Kerch, Donuzlav and 
Feodosiya). Moscow is flatly against the deployment of the 
Ukrainian naval force in the Crimea, said the spokesman. This 
is unacceptable for us, he said. 
  The spokesman also said that the Ukrainian leadership will 
elevate the cash allowance for seamen of the Ukrainian fleet to 
be equal to that of the Black Sea Fleet officers. 
  Kluban said that the problems associated with naval aviation 
were not discussed. 
  An Interfax correspondent reports from Sevastopol that on 
Friday, later in the day, the Russian and Ukrainian defense 
ministers, Pavel Grachev and Vitaliy Radetskyy, are to sign an 
agreement which will fix parameters for the fleet's division. 
Experts who are drafting the document doubt that the 
delegations in Sevastopol will manage to solve the issue 
surrounding bases for the Black Sea Fleet and the Ukrainian 
naval force.

  [Text] President Leonid Kravchuk told newsmen after the 
Ukrainian parliament closed session in Kiev, that both a Russian 
and Ukrainian presence in Sevastopol offered the best solution 
for the problem of the Black Sea Fleet. 
  However, Kravchuk felt the Russian and Ukrainian vessels 
must 
use different naval facilities. The Ukrainian fleet could be 
based in Balaklava. 
  Kravchuk said he kept in touch with the Ukrainian delegation 
to the Sevastopol negotiations. He said the Russian and 
Ukrainian Defense ministers had agreed on a formula for the 
solution of the existing problems on the basis of the Yalta, 
Zavidovo and Massandra decisions. 
  In Kravchuk's view, both the Russian and Ukrainian fleets 
must make use of Sevastopol's repair docks given that 82 percent 
of the Black Sea's infrastructure is in that city. 
  If, however, the two Defense ministers failed to reach 
agreement, Kravchuk said he would meet to resolve the problem 
with his Russian counterpart Boris Yeltsin. The problem of the 
Black Sea Fleet is to be resolved at any cost, said Kravchuk.

  [Text] The press service of the Ukrainian Defense Ministry 
today denied Moscow's ITAR-TASS report that the position of the 
Ukrainian side at the negotiations in Sevastopol allegedly did 
not correspond with the spirit of constructiveness 
characteristic of the approach of the Russian side to the 
negotiations, and also that representatives of the Ukrainian 
Defense Ministry and Navy were allegedly trying to disavow the 
Moscow agreement of 15 April. 
  The Defense ministry press service also stated that the 
ITAR-TASS report does not conform to reality and that some of 
the mass media distorted the undeniable fact that the Black Sea 
Fleet belongs to two states, rather than to Russia alone. 
  As for the reference to the fact that the position of the 
Ukrainian side with regard to a Ukrainian Navy base in 
Sevastopol contravenes military theory, the Defense Ministry 
press service is authorized to state that Ukraine has its own 
military doctrine and follows its requirements aimed at ensuring 
state independence.

<F P=106> [Report by UKRINFORM correspondent Mikhail Stetsyuk -- TASS] </F>
  [Text] Sevastopol 22 April TASS -- Ukrainian Defence 
Minister Vitaliy Radetskyy described as a complete surprise the 
behaviour of the Russian defence minister who did not return to 
negotiations on gradual settlement of the Black Sea Fleet 
problem after the break. 
  In the opinion of Radetskyy, the negotiations started rather 
successfully and the sides reached an essential agreement on the 
fleet division under which Russia will get over 600 units and 
ukraine -- over 150. 
  Speaking of basing of the Russian Black Sea Fleet and the 
Ukrainian Navy, Radetskyy said the Russian side offered 
conditions unacceptable for Ukraine, under which all Crimean 
bases shall be kept by Russia. 
  He said they are ready to discuss compromise variants and 
there were no reasons to break the dialogue.

  [Text] Kiev 23 April TASS -- The press service of the 
Ukrainian Defence Ministry circulated the following statement: 
  Talks were held between the Ukrainian and Russian military 
delegations in Sevastopol on 21-22 April. The aim of the talks 
was to examine issues on the implementtion of the agreement on a 
gradual settlement of Black Sea Fleet problems, to wit: division 
of warships and vessels as well as their temporary separate 
basing. 
  Guided by a flexible and constructive position and seeking 
to 
find a realistic and mutually acceptable solution of existing 
problems, the Ukrainian side suggested a stage-by-stage approach 
to their settlement and put forth several possible versions. 
  Despite the initial considerable difference in approaches of 
the sides to quantitative indexes of the fleet, the Russian side 
tried to lessen the Black Sea Fleet's sea-going forces by more 
than 50 per cent. The substantiated position of the Ukrainian 
side made it possible to agree all the main quantitative 
parameters, including the list of Black sea Fleet craft as well 
as warships and vessels, which should compose a Ukrainian Navy. 
  At the same time, the sides managed to settle the problem of 
a temporary base of the Russian Navy on the Ukrainian territory. 
Guided by the need for disengaging the two countries' fleets, 
provided for by the Russian-Ukrainian agreement of 1994, the 
Ukrainian side offered several versions, including separate 
deployment of the Ukrainian and Russian Navies at various 
facilities in Sevastopol. 
  The Russian side insisted that the Russian Navy should be 
based at all the Crimean facilities, while the Ukrainian Navy -- 
outside the peninsula. The Ukrainian delegation justifiably 
showed that it is impossible to create a viable Ukrainian navy 
without Crimean bases. 
  Nevertheless, Russia's approaches were immutable. Moreover, 
unwilling to heed common sense and to understand Ukraine's 
legitimate position concerning the deployment of the Ukrainian 
Navy on its own territory, the Russian delegation stopped the 
talks and disappeared without any explanation. 
  This happened at a time when experts tried to register the 
approved parameters and provisions which were numerous by that 
time. 
  The press service of the Ukrainian Defence Ministry 
expresses 
regret over the conduct of the Russian delegation, not meeting 
norms of international negotiating ethics. This is even more 
deplorable, since real outlines for settling Black Sea Fleet 
problems became more evident after the last meeting between the 
Ukrainian and Russian presidents. 
  The Ukrainian Defence Ministry imposes the entire 
responsibility for the disruption of the talks on the Russian 
side and reports its readiness to continue the negotiations at 
any time.

  [Text] Ukraine's President Leonid Kravchuk refuted the 
statement by Russian Defense Minister Pavel Grachev about the 
intentions of our state to review the accords on the division of 
the Black Sea Fleet. The last meeting of the defense ministers 
of Ukraine and Russia in Crimea was of a working nature and 
cannot be a final evaluation of the division of the Black Sea 
Fleet, Leonid Kravchuk told journalists. The statement by 
Russian Defense Minister Pavel Grachev to the Ostankino 
television company that Ukraine has changed its stand is 
groundless, he emphasized. 
  Leonid Kravchuk recalled that in accordance with the Yalta 
accord the fleet should be divided in half. But, proceeding 
from the current realities, Ukraine will take only 15-20 percent 
of the ships. The remainder will go to pay off its debts to 
Russia. 
  Touching on the issue of a base for the Russian ships, the 
president said that he is insisting on their being stationed in 
Sevastopol. Balaklava could become the base for the Ukrainian 
Navy. Leonid Kravchuk will defend this proposal at his next 
meeting with Russia's President Boris Yeltsin. 
  However, as much as I might respect the defense ministers of 
the two states, the Black Sea Fleet issue should be resolved by 
the presidents and governments, Leonid Kravchuk emphasized.

  [Text] President Kravchuk feels the two presidents 
(Ukrainian and Russian -IF note) with help from their 
governments will find a solution for the problem of the Black 
Sea Fleet. Talking to a reporter for INTERFAX-Ukraine in Kiev 
Saturday, Kravchuk warned against attempts to play up the 
Defense Ministers' failure to negotiate a solution, in 
Sebastopol [Sevastopol]. 
  According to Kravchuk, Russian Prime Minister Viktor 
Chernomyrdin agreed in a telephone conversation on Saturday that 
negotiating teams must prepare appropriate documentation but a 
political decision will rest with the two presidents. 
  Kravchuk stressed that a decision on the Black Sea Fleet 
will 
not be detrimental to the Ukrainian, Russian and Crimean 
interests and will meet security interests and encourage 
cooperation. 
  Kiev raised no objections to the use of naval facilities in 
Sebastopol by the Russian Fleet, and the conclusion of separate 
agreements on the use of facilities in Ketch and Donuzlava. 
  But, said Kravchuk, Russia cannot have as many as five or 
six 
naval facilities in Crimea. With this proviso, there will be no 
solution to the problem. 
  It had been decided, Kravchuk said, that the Fleet was fifty 
percent Ukrainian and the whole world knew that Crimea belonged 
to Ukraine. 
  Kravchuk dismissed as hardly serious Crimean President 
Meshkov's demand for the withdrawal of the Ukrainian troops from 
Crimea. The whole world recognized Crimea as an integral part 
of Ukraine, Kravchuk said. Strangely enough, the Crimean 
president failed to remember that.

  [Text] The press center of the Black Sea Fleet command 
declared that in the course of the next round of the 
Russian-Ukrainian negotiations on the Black Sea Fleet held 21-22 
April in Sevastopol the parties "have outlined the ways to solve 
the problems under discussion." The information of the press 
center stresses that the participants of the dialogue recognize 
that "the Black Sea Fleet should not become an apple of discord 
between the friendly states." 
  "At the same time we should admit that the position of the 
Ukrainian party did not meet the spirit of constructiveness with 
which the Russian delegation has come to the negotiations." 
"There was an impression that representatives of Ukraine's 
Defense Ministry and Navy try to disavow the Moscow agreement 
dated 15 April 1994 another time," says the message. 
  The press center believes that "the Ukrainian party admits 
dual interpretation of the provisions of the Moscow agreement on 
separate basing of two fleets and proportional division of the 
Black Sea Fleet. To this effect it refers to the fact that as 
before representatives of Ukraine's Defense Ministry "insist 
that Ukraine's Black Sea Fleet and Navy should be stationed in 
Sevastopol." The authors of this document assert that "this 
contradicts not only to the logic of the military theory but to 
the will of the Russian and Ukrainian presidents and to the last 
decisions of the Sevastopol city council of people's deputies." 
  The document underlines that "the Russian delegation hopes 
that sound sense would prevail over political ambitions and the 
negotiations would continue." "The Russian party takes off the 
entire responsibility for the disruption of a constructive 
dialogue," declared the press center of the Black Sea Fleet.

  [Text] "As a well brought up person I cannot evaluate the 
unexpected departure of Russian Defense Minister Pavel Grachev 
from the talks," Ukrainian Defense Minister Vitaliy Radetskyy 
stated on Friday at a press conference on the talks between the 
Ukrainian and Russian delegations concerning the Black Sea Fleet. 
  He said the defense ministers had agreed to meet at 1500 
[1100 GMT]. However, Grachev had not appeared. "He could at 
least call us and prevent that he would not come," Radetskyy 
remarked. [sentence as received] 
  On the question put by INTERFAX-Ukraine, Radetskyy stressed 
that the Russian proposal to base the Black Sea Fleet in all 
Crimean ports and the Ukrainian navy in Nikolayev, Ochakov, 
Odessa or Ismail was unacceptable for Ukraine. 
  Radetskyy suggested that Ukraine could accept basing in 
different bays of Sevastopol. 
  Radetskyy said the delegations had found understanding and 
worked fruitfully at the talks. He emphasized that the complex 
issues had been worked on by experts. 
  Radetskyy was surprised by the statement of Grachev on 
"seizure" of 126 Black Sea Fleet ships by the Ukrainian Navy. 
He said the fleet had been divided proceeding from the number 
of 864 ships registered on August 3, 1992, in accordance with 
the Yalta agreement. 
  He refuted the statement of Grachev saying that his position 
differed from that of the Ukrainian president. Radetskyy said 
in this case he would have presented a report and would have 
expressed his disagreement. 
  Radetskyy pointed out that if the Black Sea Fleet issue was 
solved, it would let lessen the tension in Crimea and tackle the 
economic problems. "However, some people find it beneficial to 
defer settlement of the problem on the Black Sea Fleet," 
Radetskyy suggested. "I think this time Russia had no desire to 
resolve the Black Sea Fleet issue," he added. 
  "It is regrettable that we did not justify the expectations 
of the presidents. This is to be blamed only on the Russian 
party," Radetskyy accentuated. 
  Ukrainian Navy Commander Vladimir Bezkorovaynyy stressed at 
the press conference that the issue on basing dealt with the 
infrastructure and "we had been deciding on separation of the 
fleet ships so necessary during the period of transition and 
giving such opportunities for maneuvering." 
  Ukraine has been financing Sevastopol for quite a long time, 
Bezkorovaynyy said while commenting on the statement of Grachev 
concerning financing of the Black Sea Fleet by Russia. "This is 
four times more expensive for Ukraine than for Russia is to 
finance the Black Sea Fleet," he added.

<F P=106> [Interview with President Leonid Kravchuk by unidentifed </F>
correspondent on 23 April; place not given -- recorded] 
  [Text] [Announcer] Over the last 24 hours the Russian mass 
media have allowed many various distortions of our state's 
stance regarding the Black Sea Fleet situation. Therefore, we 
consider it necessary to explain again what Ukraine's stance 
really is. Leonid Kravchuk, Ukraine's president, was 
interviewed by Ukrainian television today. 
  [Correspondent] Leonid Makarovych. Ostankino, let us put it 
this way, has put into the mouth of its president, Russian Boris 
Yeltsin, an opinion regarding his consultations with the 
competent bodies on the Black Sea Fleet situation -- 
dissatisfaction with the Ukrainian side's stance, as if our 
stance is changing and being interpreted in various ways. 
However, the delegation at work in Sevastopol presented the 
stance that was a result of your talks with Boris Nikolayevich. 
  [Kravchuk] The Black Sea Fleet is an issue of many aspects. 
You see how long we have been approaching it, even at the 
presidential level. This meeting in Moscow was the fourth 
meeting between Ukraine's and Russia's presidents on the Black 
Sea Fleet. 
  I have already said that those documents, which we signed in 
Yalta, Zavidovo, and Massandra, and now in Moscow, as 
instructions, as a stance, already give grounds to finally 
resolve this problem. I could never believe that two ministers, 
with their people, could assemble in Sevastopol and immediately 
manage to resolve this issue. 
  They were searches to solve, instruct, and resolve those 
stances, which had been defined, and not to fully resolve this 
problem. I am convinced that this problem -- I talked to Viktor 
Chernomyrdin today -- can be resolved only at the presidential 
level. I am always rather afraid of premature evaluations and 
would not want the work of the two ministers, their meetings and 
some kind of comments, say, by journalists and so on, to then be 
presented as a stance. This is a search. 
  Our stance is a clear one. We want Russia to agree -- and I 
understand that Russia is agreeing to this -- to dividing the 
fleet 50-50 in accordance with the Yalta and Zavidovo 
agreements. This has been stated in documents. Nobody is 
proposing anything new. But Ukraine, proceeding then from the 
current realities of its possibilities and its position, should 
take 15-20 percent of the ships of the sea-going part of the 
fleet to resolve its problems. The remaining part, which is left 
over, is that which is sold to or compensated by Russia, in 
accordance with the situation, whether for debts or whatever. 
This is a problem of forms, but this is the position. It seems 
to me that the ministers did find a solution from this aspect in 
Sevastopol, as [Defense Minister Vitaliy] Radetskyy informed me. 
  The second problem is that of basing. I abide by the idea 
and, in this particular case, support the existing reality; I do 
not see any other one. The naval base of the Russian Black Sea 
Fleet is being set up in Sevastopol on universally recognized 
international principles -- the same as they solved Baykonur and 
others. In other words, there is nothing new about this. These 
are established, tested, let us say, by the world community. It 
is not for the first time that this is being done. 
  As far as the other currently existing bases in Crimea are 
concerned, for example, Feodosiya, Kerch, Balaklava, Donuzlav... 
[pauses] it cannot be so that the chief base is in Crimea and 
then the basing. [as heard] That is to say, [Russia's] stand 
today, as far as I understand, boils down to the fact that 
Ukraine must leave Crimea. We say that the base is in 
Sevastopol and those, let us say, points of current basing can 
be used by the Russian Navy according to relevant agreements and 
treaties. In other words, we are not raising the question today 
that everything must be changed overnight; however, the Russian 
side, too, must take into account our stand. For example, we 
receive a certain number of ships. Today officers have their 
homes in Sevastopol, but we cannot leave the officers, take the 
ships without the commanders, without the officers and moor them. 
  It is necessary to tackle this in a civilized manner. One 
should not take, let us say, any statements proceeding from the 
meeting of the ministers, and even a minister's reply, or 
minister's statement, even by such a minister as the defense 
minister, either Grachev or Radetskyy, as state policy. It 
seems to me that any statements today are premature. Premature. 
I have never, and in no place been making any other statements. 
I have not been making statements to the effect that a third 
country should help us. As far as I know, this has not been 
done by any member of the government, neither [Acting Prime 
Minister] Zvyahilskyy, nor Ivan Plyushch, as the Supreme Council 
chairman. Who are they talking about? Maybe, some political 
leader or political party did this? Well, then in Russia 
political leaders make a lot of statements, but this does not 
mean they must be refuted at the level of the president. This 
is a problem... [pauses] When a president or anybody else makes 
a statement, then this is really a statement on behalf of the 
state. This is how, I believe, one should approach this.

  [Text] At the negotiations on the Black Sea Fleet the 
Ukrainian party has done its utmost in order to fulfil the 
instructions of Ukrainian and Russian presidents, Ukraine's 
deputy Foreign Minister Boris Tarasyuk said in his interview 
with journalists in Kiev. 
  In his words, Kiev was holding the negotiations 
"constructively," however, it confronted "inadequate actions of 
the Russian party." 
  Tarasyuk said that probably it is necessary to listen to the 
proposal of Ukraine's Defense Minister Vitaliy Radetskyy and to 
draw "a third party" to the negotiations, which would help to 
find a way out. 
  During a press conference on Friday in Kiev, Ivan Plyushch, 
speaker of the Ukrainian parliament, also spoke about possible 
solution of the Fleet's problem with the participation of the US 
president on analogy with the January tripartite statement on 
Ukraine's nuclear disarmament. 
  Vyacheslav Kostikov, press secretary of the Russian 
president, was critical of this point of view and declared that 
Russia would not tolerate any outer interference on the Black 
Sea Fleet issue. 
  In any case, Tarasyuk said, the major results of the meeting 
in Sevastopol is "Russia's return to the concept of the Black 
Sea Fleet division about which it "forgot" late last year." 
  He pointed out that Ukraine and Russia "have found consent 
regarding the starting point while counting the Fleet's ships." 
Russia and Ukraine also reached a consent concerning the issue 
what part of the Black Sea fleet would be transferred to 
Ukraine's Navy. 
  Unfortunately, Plyushch noted, "we cannot regard as an 
achievement the unclear departure of the Russian delegation from 
the meeting and the fact that we have failed to reach an 
agreement on separate basing of the Black Sea Fleet and 
Ukraine's Navy." 
  An unexpected departure of Russian Defense Minister Pavel 
Grachev from the negotiations in Sevastopol arouses only regret, 
Tarasyuk stressed.

  [Text] The problem of the Black Sea Fleet should be solved 
at the negotiations between Ukraine and Russia without 
interference of "any third parties," Ukrainian President Leonid 
Kravchuk said in his interview with the World service Radio 
Ukrainy on Saturday. He emphasized that he had never spoken 
about participation of any other party in this process. 
  In Kravchuk's words, during his telephone talk with Viktor 
Chernomyrdin on Saturday he proposed to the Russian premier "to 
meet at the governmental level and to solve this problem with 
the help of experts and ministers." 
  "The statements voiced by ministers are not obligatory the 
truth in its final instance," Kravchuk said given various 
interpretations of the results of the negotiations in Sevastopol 
presented by Vitaliy Radetskyy and Pavel Grachev, heads of 
military departments of both countries. He expressed hope that 
the Black Sea Fleet problem would be solved "with Russia's 
president and government." 
  Kravchuk called the meeting between Ukrainian and Russian 
Defense Ministers held in Sevastopol on 21-22 April "a search 
for ways out" and called not to make any "far-reaching 
conclusions." 
  Kravchuk reassured that Ukraine "will support Russia's 
interest to have its base in Sevastopol" and noted that "nobody 
should be granted any unilateral advantages." 
  "One cannot force Russia to leave its bases in Crimea," said 
Kravchuk. He pointed out that "we must sign corresponding 
documents on rent of this bases by Russia for a definite time." 
"The main thing is to solve on which conditions and principles 
this would be done," Kravchuk said. 
  He underlined that he does not see any other way out -- 
"this 
problem cannot be solved by dictatorship or sanctions." 
  Kravchuk said that existence of foreign bases on the 
territory of any country not obligatory threatens to its 
sovereignty. As an example, he mentioned functioning of U.S. 
naval bases in several regions of the world.

  [Text] The holding of elections for president of Ukraine 
and the chairmen and deputies of local councils in June is 
extremely undesirable and dangerous for the fate of Ukraine. 
Ukrainian Republican Party Chairman Mykhaylo Horyn said this at 
a news conference devoted to the results of the party's 
extraordinary congress. 
  The Ukrainian Republican Party leader stressed that the 
elections should take place after a new Ukrainian constitution 
or a law on power is adopted. At the same time Mykhaylo Horyn 
emphasized that, as postponing the elections is problematical, 
the [party] congress gave the Ukrainian Republican Party 
leadership the right to take a stand on its attitude to 
contenders for the post of president of Ukraine.

<F P=106> [Report by ITAR-TASS correspondent Galina Nekrasova] </F>
  [Text] Lvov 25 April TASS -- "Statements by Yuriy Meshkov 
[president of the Crimean Republic] about the Crimea's secession 
from Ukraine are poorly thought-out," Ukrainian President Leonid 
Kravchuk said in an interview with the world service of Radio 
Ukraina this morning. 
  "All the Crimean decrees contravening the Ukrainian 
Constitution and laws will be abrogated in future too. I do not 
speak about decrees on economic reform. In this case, there can 
be appropriate variations and additional possibilities for the 
economy's liberalisation," the president noted. 
  "I see Ukraine as a unitarian country," Kravchuk stressed. 
"Meshkov's statements that Ukraine should leave the Crimea, are 
not serious. The Crimea is a Ukrainian territory recognised by 
all countries in the world. If Russia has now bases in the 
Crimea for its Black Sea Fleet, it is impossible to force it to 
leave the bases. 
  "We should come to agreement with Russia, which signed 
appropriate documents providing for a lease of bases on the 
Crimean territory for a definite period of time till this issue 
is settled on a broader scale." 
  Kravchuk underlined: "I'm against aggravating the problem of 
the Black Sea Fleet beforehand. On the basis of a preliminary 
understanding, a meeting of ministers or delegations, we shall 
abide by understandings which are incorporated in the four 
documents signed by the Ukrainian and Russian heads of state. 
  But neither Russia nor Ukraine should dictate or demand a 
unilateral advantages. It is a complicated problem, and it 
should be settled reasonably and quietly in order not to quarrel 
and not to bring the situation to a conflict." 
  Kravchuk said that he had a telephone conversation with 
Russian Premier Viktor Chernomyrdin who suggested that meetings 
should be held at the level of the cabinet heads or the 
presidents and that a decision should be taken on the Black Sea 
Fleet.

<F P=106> [Report by UKRINFORM correspondents Viktor Demidenko and </F>
Mikhail Melnik for TASS] 
  [Text] Kiev, 23 Apr -- I have said more than once, and will 
continue to insist in the future, that relations with Crimea, as 
a constituent part of Ukraine, should be built on a mutually 
advantageous basis. I believe that Yuriy Meshkov's statements 
regarding the separation of Crimea from Ukraine are 
ill-considered, Ukrainian President Leonid Kravchuk said in an 
exclusive interview with UKRINFORM correspondents today. 
  It would appear that Meshkov is doing this out of emotion or 
in order to aggravate the situation. His statements saying that 
Ukraine should give up Crimea are, to say the least, not 
serious. It is a territory of Ukraine that is recognized by the 
whole world community, Kravchuk said. 
  Kravchuk believes it is unlikely that the Republic of Crimea 
would be able to lead a proper life without Ukraine. If our 
links are severed, the peninsula's population of almost 3 
million will feel it straight away. But we do not want to give 
in to emotions and arrogance, the Ukrainian president stressed. 
  Kravchuk believes that Meshkov's illegal actions could 
become 
a barrier to friendly relations and partnership between Ukraine 
and Russia. That is a great responsibility for one man, who, 
profiting from current misfortunes and difficulties, flouting 
all international norms, is trying to separate Crimea from 
Ukraine. But apart from aggravating the situation, he will not 
succeed in doing anything, Kravchuk said.

  [Text] As a European Union [EU] communique on the 
Ukrainian elections says, the EU with pleasure and enthusiasm 
assumes that the elections were free and legal. This has been 
confirmed by observers' reports, in which they praise the 
organizational efforts. The EU expects that the election results 
will allow Ukraine to continue political and economic reforms. 
The EU has voiced concern over increasing tensions in the 
Crimea. It fully supports Ukraine's territorial integrity, 
according to the UN Charter and the principles of the CSCE Final 
Act.

  [Text] Kiev, 21 Apr -- A session of the Crimean Supreme 
Council will be held at the beginning of May, which will examine 
the issue of Crimea's secession from Ukraine. This was revealed 
by representatives of pro-Ukrainian organizations who arrived in 
Kiev in connection with such an extraordinary development of 
events. Representatives of Crimea's branches of URP [Ukrainian 
Republican Party], SOU [Union of Ukrainian Officers], SUS [Union 
of Ukrainian Students], Union of Ukrainian Women, the "Prosvita" 
Society, societies of political prisoners and the repressed, the 
Ukrainian Civil Congress of Crimea, Majlis of the Crimean Tatar 
People, and organizations of the Crimean-Tatar National Movement 
decided for the subsequent and probably the last time to 
demonstrate their position to the president and Ukraine's 
Supreme Council: "Crimea should be part of Ukraine." 
  Mykola Porovskyy said, as people's deputy and leader of the 
Crimean branch of URP, that members of the delegation will 
picket the Supreme Council during the work of Ukraine's Supreme 
Council of the old convocation (from 22 April) "in order to show 
the Supreme Council what the voting on Crimea's autonomy has led 
to and what the consequences of the Ukrainian parliament's 
policy toward Crimea are." A warning hunger strike will be held 
during the picket. An appeal adopted by Crimea's pro-Ukrainian 
organizations and parties demands that Crimea's autonomy and the 
presidential institution be abrogated; direct presidential rule 
be introduced on its territory; the full return of Crimean 
Tatars and other deported peoples to their historic fatherland 
be facilitated; the rights of national autonomy be granted to 
them; the laws of Crimea be brought into line with Ukrainian 
legislation and that its implementation be guaranteed on the 
territory of the autonomy; Yuriy Meshkov and his supporters stop 
aggravating inter-ethnic hostility and anti-Ukrainian hysteria; 
Russian troops be withdrawn from the territory of Crimea; the 
problems of the Black Sea Fleet be resolved fairly; decisions of 
the Sevastopol town council concerning the Ukrainian Armed 
Forces be cancelled; and that presidential and local council 
elections be postponed being as they are too early. 
  In the event of Ukraine's Supreme Council rejecting these 
demands, the appeal's authors retain the right to turn to 
international human rights organizations in the West and to 
resort to acts of civil disobedience.

<F P=106> ["Text" of "Address of the Supreme Council of Ukraine 12th </F>
convocation to the newly-elected deputies and citizens of 
Ukraine" adopted at the parliament's final session in Kiev on 22 
April; read by Supreme Council Chairman Ivan Plyushch] 
  [Text] Esteemed colleagues and countrymen! The present 
Supreme Council of Ukraine is resigning. Fate has allowed us to 
play a truly historic role in consolidating Ukrainian statehood. 
We lived through a moment of unity when adopting the 
declaration of Ukraine's state sovereignty and the act of its 
independence. In the past four years we have laid a legislative 
foundation for the development of a democratic, law-governed 
state. Today, we have all of its integral features. Ukraine 
has been recognized by 145 states. It has been accepted as a 
rightful member of the European and world community. 
  The Supreme Council of Ukraine 12th convocation, with all 
its 
shortcomings, was a stabilizing factor in society and helped 
prevent interethnic discord. The laws it passed on the issues 
of nationality, interethnic relations, and protection of the 
rights of ethnic minorities received high appraisal from the 
world community. Calling on the newly elected deputies to 
preserve the positive heritage of the present Supreme Council, 
we would like to warn them against the miscalculations and 
mistakes we made. We failed to ensure a proper attitude to the 
Constitution and the laws in the society, as well as 
coordination between the branches of power, the center, and the 
regions. The practice of transferring legislative functions to 
executive structures proved unjustified. 
  The effective work of Ukraine's Supreme Council was often 
hindered by political confrontation. We call on the new members 
of parliament, political parties and movements, and their 
leaders to refrain from settling scores in the Supreme Council, 
and especially from involving their supporters in doing so. 
Such actions usually lead to destructive consequences for 
society as a whole. 
  We appeal to the deputies who are replacing us to 
(?preserve) 
Ukraine's statehood, its independence and territorial integrity, 
and the inviolability of our borders. Whatever political 
movements or religious denominations we are part of, whatever 
our ethnic background, we are all citizens of Ukraine, and there 
is only one Ukraine for all of us. 
  Adopting the new Constitution of Ukraine as soon as possible 
would assist in solving these problems. The most important 
thing today is to speed up the overcoming of the economic 
crisis, to stabilize and develop the national economy, and to 
strengthen its social orientation. This can be achieved on the 
road of economic reform by ensuring the equality of all forms of 
ownership and economic management. The financial, monetary, and 
credit policy and taxation require serious and essential 
changes. A further improved legal foundation is needed for an 
effective campaign against crime, first of all, organized crime 
and corruption, to strengthen law enforcement and ensure 
reliable protection of citizens' constitutional rights and 
freedoms. 
  We hope that the Supreme Council of Ukraine of the new 
convocation will continue to work on strengthening Ukraine's 
authority as a large European nation, its economic integration 
with the countries of the CIS and other states of the world. We 
call on the people's deputies and all citizens to join efforts 
in the development of Ukraine, to do their best to preserve 
peace and concord in society. This is the only way we can 
survive the difficulties and improve people's lives. We have 
faith in your power and wisdom. We wish you honest and 
constructive work for the good of the Ukrainian people. 
  [signed] The Supreme Council of Ukraine, 12th convocation, 
Kiev, 22 April 1994.

  [Text] Ukrainian President Leonid Kravchuk told journalists 
following the Supreme Soviet [as received] Friday session that 
338 deputies elected to new Ukrainian parliament were too few to 
make what he called cardinal decisions. 
  He expressed the hope that there would be a sufficient 
number 
of deputies to form a government, pass legislation and change 
the Constitution, for instance 430 or 440 deputies. 
  The run-off elections in 112 constituencies are scheduled 
for 
26 June. 
  Kravchuk did not say whether he would run for president. He 
only expressed his gratitude to those who want him to. The 
registration of presidential candidates will end on April 26. 
  He said that both the right and left-wing extremists in the 
new Supreme Soviet were ideologically Bolsheviks doing harm to 
Ukraine.

<F P=106> [Report by UKRINFORM correspondent Mikhail Melnik -- TASS] </F>
  [Text] Kiev 22 April TASS -- the Black Sea Fleet should be 
shared by all former Soviet republics, Speaker of the Ukrainian 
Parliament Ivan Plyushch said on Friday. 
  "From the very beginning the Black Sea Fleet was shared in 
the wrong way," he told a press conference. 
  According to Plyushch, the "zero option" of sharing the 
fleet 
would have settled many problems, including the Crimean one. 
  In the meantime, the Russian and Ukrainian defence ministers 
are currently discussing in Sevastopol how to share the fleet 
between the two countries. Russia wants to have 85 per cent of 
the fleet and leave 15 per cent to Ukraine. Kiev disagrees and 
insists on 20 and more per cent.

  [Text] Kharkov, 24 Apr -- Former vice prime minister 
Volodymyr Lanovyy said at a news conference on 23 April: "My 
candidacy for the post of Ukrainian president at the forthcoming 
elections is supported by Rukh [Ukraine People's Movement for 
Perestroyka], the Ukrainian Republican Party, the Democratic 
Party of Ukraine, the Party of Social Justice, the Green Party, 
the Social Democratic Party of Ukraine, and the Peasants Party 
of Ukraine." Leonid Kuchma, whom Volodymyr Lanovyy considers 
not to be a strategist, has the highest rating among the 
contenders for the presidential seat and this is caused 
exclusively by the "empty stomachs of Ukrainian citizens." 
  Mr. Lanovyy said that it is planned to create a new 
parliamentary faction in the new Supreme Council which would 
unite the political forces of the center right and center left 
as well as part of the party of power that is market-oriented. 
The basis for such a faction would be formed by nonparty 
democratic deputies. In the event of an understanding on the 
part of market-oriented deputies, the size of such a faction 
could be 130-150 persons. 
  Mr. Lanovyy noted that with regard to carrying out market 
reforms, the new composition of people's deputies would be more 
liberal than the old one. 
  Mr. Lanovyy's position concerning the Black Sea Fleet is: 
"The transfer of part of the Black Sea Fleet is a transfer of 
bases and therefore of the infrastructure, i.e. of territory. 
Apart from that, it is unwise and even criminal to settle 
economic debts with means of defense." The former vice prime 
minister expressed support for a parliamentary republic as the 
best form of statehood for Ukraine. A strong, and even tough 
presidential power should exist in the transitional period. 
Personally, Mr. Lanovyy would immediately combine two posts: 
those of the president and the prime minister.

Meshkov dismissed Crimean Justice Minister Yevhen Skisov by 
virtue of another decree. "I simply do not understand Mr. 
Meshkov," Vasyl Onopenko said in an interview with KIEVSKIYE 
VEDOMOSTI. "I think that he does not take into account the 
consequences of his actions. I will not list all Ukrainian laws 
or articles of the Constitution that have been violated by this 
decision. I will provide just one typical example: The Crimean 
minister learned about his dismissal from the Crimean radio. It 
is very sad that Yuriy Meshkov is violating the same 
Constitution by which he swore and to which he pledged 
allegiance."

  [Text] Kiev, 23 Apr -- An edict issued by the president of 
Ukraine entitles its citizens to a free share of the state 
property. According to this edict, in 1994 the citizens of 
Ukraine will be able to pay for the property to be privatized 
either from their privatization deposits in the banks or by 
privatization certificates. 
  Beginning 1 January 1995, property privatization 
certificates 
will remain the only tender in such payments. 
  The Ukraine Savings Bank is instructed to ensure that these 
certificates are issued to the citizens of Ukraine entitled to 
receive them in accordance with Ukraine legislation. 
  The property privatization certificates are valid until 31 
December 1996.

<F P=106> [Report by UKRINFORM correspondent -- TASS] </F>
  [Text] Kiev 22 April TASS -- It is incorrect to estimate 
prospects of the Chernobyl nuclear power plant only negatively; 
calls to halt the plant are unjustified, Chernobyl nuclear power 
plant director Sergey Parashin told UKRINFORM on the eve of the 
8th anniversary of the Chernobyl accident. 
  In his words, the "situation around the Chernobyl power 
plant 
has been excessively politicized and some are trying to use it 
for pressure on Ukraine." 
  Speaking of the recent demands for immediate halt of the 
power plant, Parashin said specialists "have done much from 1986 
through now to increase the plant's safety and improve all the 
parameters of its operation. We have a clear plan of further 
measures to the effect and they are been consistently taken." 
  "Professionals are working at the Chernobyl nuclear power 
plant, and all the capacities are normally operated. I am 
confident that the current state of the plant is much better 
than that of many facilities of other branches," said the plant 
director. 
  The work of plant power units is under constant control over 
the state inspection for supervision over nuclear safety and 
other state bodies, he stressed. In case of any doubts, 
international experts, including those from the International 
Atomic Energy Agency, are invited. The situation at the 
"shelter" facility (the sarcophagus above the fourth power unit) 
is also under reliable control, and it provokes no serious 
concern over safety. 
  The plant director referred to the conclusions of the IAEA 
commission outlined in the commission's draft report on results 
of its work at the plant in March 1994: "The Chernobyl nuclear 
power plant has held all the arrangements scheduled for power 
units with RBMK reactors after the Chernobyl accident. The 
safety level at the first and third power units is equal to that 
of corresponding power units at the Leningrad, Kursk and 
Smolensk nuclear power plants. 
  "Despite the fact many highly-professional plant staffers 
have quitted, there are adequate resources for full staffing of 
the plant's six shifts to operate two power units. General 
impression of the control board personnel is `professionalism'." 
  Unfortunately, said the director, "these essential 
provisions 
of the report were not included in the IAEA press release 
circulated so widely in mass media bodies."

  [Text] Moscow, 25 Apr (ITAR-TASS) -- "In the first place, 
partnership means not deceiving one another and not letting one 
another down, taking account of partners' interests and not only 
one's own, not trying to place oneself above others, and all 
interested parties participating in a process of true 
partnership on an equal basis. And those are the principles of 
the Partnership for Peace program," Russian Defense Minister 
Pavel Grachev said at a news conference today. 
  The Russian defense minister believes that NATO's 
Partnership 
for Peace program has been over-publicized, although even the 
masters of the program have not yet put forward its specific 
principles and measures. Meanwhile, hundreds of scientific 
works have already been written on this topic, thousands of 
symposiums held, and millions spent on various visits, Pavel 
Grachev noted.

<F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS correspondent Mikhail Shevtsov] </F>
  [Text] Moscow April 25 TASS -- Russian Defence Minister 
Pavel Grachev called to drop the threat of NATO air strikes on 
Bosnia, especially of the massive ones which can make "the 
conflict uncontrollable and result in its spreading outside 
Bosnia-Herzegovina". 
  "In the military sphere NATO air strikes did not bring any 
results and will not bring them at present", he told a press 
conference on Monday. 
  The minister believes the major way to settle the conflict 
is 
to hold in the near future a meeting of the leaders of Russia, 
the United States, EU countries and the UN. The summit, 
according to Grachev, can be held in any European state and 
should involve also the political leadership of the whole of the 
former Yugoslavia. 
  Grachev urged to strengthen the peace-keeping forces in 
Gorazde and to avert bloodshed in the city itself. He informed 
that a 19-men strong Russian platoon will be transferred to 
Gorazde. The minister said it is also necessary to promote 
normal humanitarian provision for the population there. 
  Grachev is categorically against the withdrawal of Russian 
peace-keepers from Bosnia. "This would be an untimely and 
inappropriate decision fraught with a further political 
isolation of Russia in the world community. It is possible to 
pull out Russian forces from the region only after the 
settlement is reached by political means", he said. 
  The Russian minister believes it is not only Serbs who are 
to 
blame for the current crisis in Bosnia. Both conflicting sides 
are to blame, according to him.

  [Text] Belgrade, 24 Apr -- Radovan Karadzic, president of 
the Serb Republic in Bosnia-Herzegovina, and Momcilo Krajisnik, 
head of the Serb Republic parliament, received in Pale today an 
official Russian parliamentary delegation, headed by Nikolay 
Bezborodov, deputy chairman of the State Duma Defense and 
Security Committee. 
  During the course of the conversation, the leaders of the 
Serb Republic expressed gratitude to the Russian 
parliamentarians for their arrival at the critical moment of the 
declaration of the NATO ultimatum to the Bosnian Serbs. 
  At a time when an agreement is being concluded with the 
representatives of the United Nations on localizing the pocket 
of conflict in Gorazde, they are again presenting us with an 
ultimatum, threatening the use of force and thus trying to 
impose on us decisions which are alien to us, M. Krajisnik, the 
parliamentary chairman, said during the conversation. 
  At the same time, he expressed the hope that the Russian 
parliamentarians would take an objective view of the situation 
and would make the correct conclusions. 
  The head of the Russian delegation said that the deputies, 
who represent the majority of the factions in the Duma, in many 
ways agree with the Serbian side's view of what is happening and 
the ways of solving urgent problems. The speediest 
establishment of peace is the chief element toards solving the 
Bosnian crisis, N. Bezborodov said. He also stressed the 
importance of lifting the sanctions, saying that once the 
delegation had returned to Moscow with its report, the Duma will 
continue its debate on the question of sanctions.

  [Text] Russian President Boris Yeltsin has sent a letter to 
Alija Izetbegovic, president of the presidency of 
Bosnia-Herzegovina. Yeltsin writes: 
  It is with great concern and disquiet that we have followed 
the developments surrounding Gorazde and Bosnia-Herzegovina as a 
whole. We strongly condemn any activity which results in the 
killing of the civilian population, Yeltsin writes in his letter 
to Izetbegovic. Russia has been taking all possible steps to end 
the bloodshed as soon as possible, to restrain the deadly 
currents of the war, and to restore a situation that would help 
in finding a political solution. To this end I sent the Russian 
Foreign Minister Andrey Kozyrev, to Belgrade. The activity of 
our special envoy Vitaliy Churkin in Sarajevo and in Pale was 
aimed at resolving the crisis. We insist on the Bosnian Serbs 
complying fully with the UN conditions regarding Gorazde, 
President Yeltsin says in his letter to Alija Izetbegovic.

<F P=106> [From the "Novosti" newscast] </F>
  [Excerpts] [Announcer] It seems to be the case that events 
in and around Bosnia regularly reach a peak at the weekend. 
Dmitriy Voskoboynikov, observer for our program and for the 
INTERFAX agency, who discussed matters earlier with Russia's 
Foreign Minister Andrey Kozyrev, now talks about where things 
have got to this time. [passage omitted] 
  [Begin recording] [Kozyrev] There will be no air strikes 
whatsoever as long as the basic reasonable demands for 
safeguarding security in the zones long declared by the United 
Nations -- six towns in all -- are met. Neither the Bosnian 
Serbs nor the Serbs of Yugoslavia have raised objections to this. 
  [Voskoboynikov] There is frequent talk of lack of agreement 
among Russia, the USA, and the European Union [EU] and at the 
United Nations on how a settlement of the Bosnian crisis is to 
be reached. Can it now be said that, following yesterday's NATO 
decision, the positions of all parties regarding the way to an 
agreement have somehow suddenly come closer? 
  [Kozyrev] No, I do not believe it should be put like that. 
The fact is that it has become quite clear of late; there are 
two directions for action. The first is the military one -- how 
to stop the Serb fighters and what will most effectively stop 
them, and what is the limit beyond which they may not be allowed 
to go. But there is a second direction too -- the working-out 
of a joint position by Russia, the EU, the United Nations, and 
the USA. In other words, you see, it has to be clear that the 
military option will lead to military disaster; whereas the 
peaceful option which also exists, is no less clear and is just 
as precisely coordinated by the international community. The 
situation to date has been that we and the EU have taken 
approaches to this matter that have been very close, in fact 
almost identical. The USA, on the other hand, has up to now 
been, as it were, out on its own. What we have managed to do 
during this time is get the USA, too, to declare that it is 
joining in the practical work. [end recording] 
  [Voskoboynikov] It would appear that Kozyrev is to meet U.S. 
Secretary of State Warren Christopher in Geneva on 26 April, but 
before that Kozyrev's deputy, Vitaliy Churkin, is to have talks 
in London with his British opposite number and the U.S. special 
representative [Charles] Redman. On the following day, also in 
London, multilateral international consultations on Bosnia are 
to be held.

  [Text] The Federation Council entirely shares the position 
of the Russian Foreign Ministry regarding the situation in the 
former Yugoslavia, Chairman of the International Affairs 
Committee of the Parliament's Upper Chamber Vladimir Podoprigora 
declared in an interview with Interfax on Friday. He underlined 
that during the visit of the Russian parliamentary delegation to 
Strasbourg he said at the sitting of the Parliamentary Assembly 
of the European Council that one should take into consideration 
Russia's opportunity to influence the situation in Yugoslavia to 
a greater extent. "One should not resort to arms until all 
other opportunities are used. Now the Russian Foreign Ministry 
is sticking to this position and we entirely share it," said 
Podoprigora. 
  He pointed out that in contrast to the State Duma there are 
no contradictions on this issue within the Federation Council 
and said that the lower chamber had sent its own delegation to 
Yugoslavia in order to clarify its position. 
  However, as Podoprigora said, "deputies should interfere in 
practical policy only in extreme cases, their aim is to 
determine foreign political strategy and decide on how to 
coordinate foreign policy with the Constitution and current 
legislation." 
  Podoprigora said that according to the Constitution the 
president determines foreign policy and the parliament prepares 
decrees. That's why the Federation council does not intend to 
consider issues on Russian policy in Yugoslavia at its sittings, 
said Podoprigora.

<F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS correspondent Tamara Ivanova] </F>
  [Text] Moscow, 23 Apr -- Reserves for extinguishing the 
Bosnian conflict by peaceful means have not yet been exhausted 
and Boris Yeltsin's initiative is more likely than bombing and 
shelling to lead to an end to the war. This opinion was 
expressed by Oleg Lobov, secretary of the Security Council, in 
an interview with an ITAR-TASS correspondent. He reported that 
the Bosnian question was discussed at a meeting of the Security 
Council which had heard a report from Russian Foreign Minister 
Andrey Kozyrev as well as detailed information about the Russian 
president's initiative. 
  Oleg Lobov considers that a top-level meeting of the leaders 
of the world's leading countries and UN and CSCE 
representatives, with the participation of the warring sides, 
could yield the most positive results. 
  The Security Council secretary said that at the present time 
drafting work is being actively carried out on the concept of 
economic security. It is planned to examine the concept at a 
meeting of the council in November. Alongside military and 
social security, economic security is one of the most important 
areas of the council's activities. 
  The aim of the economic security program, Oleg Lobov said, 
is 
to stabilize the situation in the economy and to seek ways out 
of the crisis. Meanwhile, even before the program is adopted, a 
number of questions are being urgently tackled. These are 
questions connected with privatization, providing the Russian 
populace with medicines, the ecological problem, and land 
fertility. In the opinion of the Security Council secretary 
these could be described as global problems.

<F P=106> [Interview with Vitaliy Churkin, the Russian president's </F>
special envoy to Bosnia-Herzegovina and deputy foreign minister 
by correspondent Yevgeniy Kiselev; place and date not given -- 
recorded] 
  [Text] [Kiselev] Vitaliy Ivanovich, because of the events 
in Yugoslavia you are now as famous as General Sir Michael Rose, 
the commander of UN peacekeeping forces. They say you were 
inside Gorazde at the very moment when the Serbian tanks burst 
into the town and it was only your personal intervention that 
stopped the onslaught. What happened in reality? 
  [Churkin] This thing about my personal intervention and the 
tanks breaking in is an obvious exaggeration. In reality, this 
is what happened: While Akashi, the UN secretary general's 
representative in former Yugoslavia and myself, were making 
desperate final efforts to come to an agreement with the Serbs 
that they should withdraw -- at least slightly -- their heavy 
armaments and troops from Gorazde, Rose sent us a panicky report 
that even after all undertakings to cease-fire, not only was the 
fire continuing, albeit not very intensely, but also that three 
tanks were approaching the town, which could start the shelling 
at any moment. Rose said he was unable to tolerate this any 
longer and if the tanks did not make a U-turn there and then he 
would be requesting air strikes. At that point I did indeed 
intervene, because it was Akashi who was to give the go-ahead 
for this action. I told him this was breaching the resolutions 
of the UN Security Council because the tanks were not, in fact, 
firing. 
  [Kiselev] That is you intervened, in fact, not in order to 
stop the onslaught, or the advance of these three tanks, but 
with the view to preventing the NATO strikes. 
  [Churkin] Yes, for prevention. I told him however -- and in 
this I did take rather a lot upon myself -- that if in the 
future just one tank fires even once, I am giving him the 
go-ahead, if he needs an official go-ahead from a Russian 
representative -- to ask for air support, so that these tanks 
are dealt with accordingly. 
  Because this game -- broken promises, undertakings to 
cease-fire, while continuing to shell the town, the advancement 
of tanks -- this game continued for a few days and could not be 
tolerated any longer. 
  [Kiselev] Was it the game led by the Serbian leaders? 
  [Churkin] It was the game conducted, as I understand, by 
some 
people, leaders, from among the Bosnian Serbs, mainly the 
military. 
  [Kiselev] While you have been working in Yugoslavia -- I am 
saying "working in Yugoslavia" because I think you are spending 
more time there in Yugoslavia than here in Moscow, you have 
certainly built personal relationships with many Serbian 
leaders, such relationships that give one the right to be hurt 
or puzzled, or to expect -- on the other hand -- personal 
support. How would you describe the Serbian leaders as 
personalities? 
  [Churkin] I would not like to talk about personalities right 
now. I would only say that they are strong people. There are 
also strong, major politicians in Belgrade. In fact, I have a 
personal relationship with many of them, but I have not been 
using them to replace the state policy by some kind of personal 
contacts, this would have been absurd. However, I have used 
them to speak with utmost frankness about the problems as they 
were emerging. The conversations, especially the very recent 
ones, probably went beyond the bounds of any concept of 
political and diplomatic contacts. I am actually quite sure 
they did. Both in the gravity of what was being said and, 
excuse me, even in the tone of it. This was being done 
deliberately -- because I felt that they were approaching a 
catastrophe, and that as a professional, I should be able to 
tell myself later: I have done all I could have done, said all 
I could have said, used all opportunities to bring it home to 
them that they were making a colossal mistake and that this 
absolutely must not be done, and that events must be made to 
take a different course. 
  [Kiselev] That statement, very abrupt, I would say 
unexpectedly abrupt for a tried and tested professional 
diplomat, that you made in the airport on returning to Moscow -- 
what was it, an echo of those emotions, some kind of overspill, 
or do you not regret your words? 
  [Churkin] I do not regret it at all. Furthermore, now I am 
even more convinced that it was correct, the statement was well 
considered. I will tell you why it was correct. In general, 
during my work in Yugoslavia, this is the third time I have 
resorted to this device, but perhaps in this case it was the 
most open, naked, and extreme in form. 
  With this statement I wanted to achieve three things. First, 
I wanted to tell the Serbs with complete clarity the threat they 
are facing. Second, I wanted to somehow shake up public opinion 
in Russia, so that people would stop for a moment and realize 
that something wrong is happening there, that very threatening 
events could really be approaching. Third, I wanted it to be 
clear to everyone in the world that Russia dissociates itself 
from the nightmares and horrors being created by the Bosnian 
Serbs in Gorazde. 
  [Kiselev] Alright. Your point of view -- or probably it is 
less your point of view than the point of view of the Russian 
Foreign Ministry, if I understand correctly -- how much weight 
does it carry when Russia's stance as a whole is being 
determined? After all, foreign policy is not determined by the 
Foreign Ministry alone: There is also the military, the military 
intelligence service and the foreign intelligence service, which 
also report to the president, and the president formulates the 
stance after summarizing this information. 
  [Churkin] Of course. Of course. At least [words indistinct] 
Yugoslavian but also European, in two years working as deputy 
minister I do not recall any case in which the president adopted 
a decision that differed sharply from the view of the Foreign 
Ministry. That is of course, there are sometimes certain 
nuances and the president himself can introduce a certain nuance 
into a draft decision presented to him, independently of the 
departments. But I cannot remember any cases in which there has 
been a complete reversal. 
  [Kiselev] Tell me, please, is there now in the Russian 
approach to appraising the Serb side's position, a return to the 
situation of 1992 when the Serbs used to be divided into good 
and bad? You remember, that at the time there was a policy of 
supporting not Milosevic but Panic. 
  [Churkin] Well, I have always said and keep repeating that 
extremists from all the three sides are the main difficulty and 
danger in the whole Bosnian conflict -- I have told this to the 
Serbs, too -- extremists among the Serbs, among the Muslims and 
among the Croats. It happens now that at this moment, precisely 
when peace was within reach, or maybe precisely because there 
was such a moment, that genie was let out of the bottle. What 
can we do now? I believe that we should try to single out 
commonsense in the Serb side proceeding simply from some normal 
ideas of Serbia's interests. In conversations with Milosevic, I 
have asked him more than once: Does Serbia really need Gorazde? 
What is a town with 60,000 people from the point of view of the 
entire Serb people? I must say that he agreed with me. Serbia 
needs peace, Serbia does not take part in the war, not directly, 
at least. The people are suffering from the sanctions. So, 
Serbia should be interested in lifting the sanctions and 
therefore in putting pressure on the extremists among the 
Bosnian Serbs in order to stop the conflict. But for the time 
being, as I see it, I will say the following: For the time 
being I see no signs of Belgrade's pressure on Bosnian Serb 
extremists yielding palpable results. This is a tragedy. 
  [Kiselev] That is, you are saying that they are becoming 
increasingly unmanageable? 
  [Churkin] Perhaps, yes. I see a solution here in Serbia 
finding an inner strength to separate itself from these actions 
by the militarists among the Bosnian Serbs. 
  [Kiselev] To what degree do your words apply to Karadzic, 
the 
main leader of the Bosnian Serbs? 
  [Churkin] I would not like to mention names now. I have 
clear ideas about everyone but I would not like to speak about 
this now. 
  [Kiselev] Now, perhaps the last question -- about you 
personally, Vitaliy Ivanovich: Right now in those circles of 
people keeping a close watch on Russia's diplomatic efforts in 
the former Yugoslavia there are rumors that you may fall victim 
to an intrigue directed against you within the state machinery. 
Do you think this is true? 
  [Churkin, laughing] I am probably circulating these rumors 
myself, because...no, I do not have this impression at all. I 
have not got wind of any intrigues within the state machinery 
whatsoever. But, I think I will soon have to find the right 
moment to draw a line under all my stormy activities connected 
with Yugoslavia and hand over to another, perhaps more worthy 
and less emotional person. Two years is quite enough. 
  [Kiselev] Doesn't it mean that you have simply given up? 
  [Churkin] No! No, I have not given up. Just that, we have 
this rotation system, one of the sacred traditions of diplomatic 
service, and not just of ours, it is international. But while 
there is no result, no realistic result, I think I should keep 
working. So long as no other decisions are taken in connection 
with other circumstances. 
  [Kiselev] Thank you, Vitaliy Ivanovich.

  [Text] Moscow, 23 Apr -- "Russian President Boris Yeltsin 
has been following the Black Sea Fleet situation with great 
attention," a statement received by ITAR-TASS from Vyacheslav 
Kostikov, press secretary of the Russian president, says. "He is 
concerned about the Ukrainian side's open demonstration of its 
unwillingness to adhere strictly to the understanding on the 
separate basing of the Russian Black Sea Fleet and the Ukrainian 
Navy, which was contained in the Moscow agreement. 
  "The Ukrainian side is making totally inappropriate hints 
about the possibility of resolving the contentious issue with 
the help of a third power. Needless to say, the Russian side 
will not tolerate any outside interference in the question of 
the Black Sea Fleet. One has the impression that the Ukrainian 
side does not realize what the realities are and is losing 
control over the situation. In these circumstances it is 
becoming less and less consistent and more unpredictable both in 
its actions and in its statements. This constitutes a serious 
danger. At the same time it is obvious that the Black Sea Fleet 
cannot be used as a hostage of Ukraine's internal political 
disagreements. 
  "In connection with circumstances which have taken shape 
Boris Yeltsin is holding intensive political consultations with 
competent departments."
