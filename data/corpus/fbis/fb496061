  [Text] Russia and the United States now have no fundamental 
differences on problems of an Arab-Israeli settlement, Russia's 
Foreign Minister Andrey Kozyrev stated after his meeting in 
Geneva with U.S. Secretary of State Warren Christopher. In the 
past week Moscow was the center of the Middle East peace 
process, he said: it was visited by PLO leader Yasir `Arafat and 
Israel's Prime Minister Yitzhaq Rabin. Now Washington is, as it 
were, taking over the baton from us, and it is very important 
for our actions to be coordinated, Kozyrev stressed. The 
Russian minister had in mind the visit by the U.S. Secretary of 
State to the Near East, which starts today. Christopher will 
visit Saudi Arabia, Egypt, Israel and Syria.

<F P=106> [Pavel Felgengauer report in the "Generals" column: "The </F>
Two Countries' Armies Warily Are Getting Ready to Cooperate" 
under general headline: "Israel Asks Russia To Influence the 
Arabs"] 
  [Text] Yesterday for the first time in history Russian 
Defense Minister Pavel Grachev held negotiations with Israeli 
Defense Minister Yitzhaq Rabin. The meeting lasted longer than 
planned, and General Rabin was therefore somewhat late at the 
General Staff Academy, where he gave a lecture on the Israeli 
"science of victory." 
  The Israeli Army has long been a subject of interest to some 
Russian military leaders as a possible model for organizing 
future Russian armed forces. Especially the process of raising 
extremely combat-efficient troops with conscripts and 
reservists, the organization of a really universal military 
conscription system, and other features that set the Israeli 
Army apart from the U.S. Army, which for several years has been 
proffered to our military as the key model to emulate. 
  But even more than military cooperation with the Israeli 
Army, Russia is interested in the Arab arms market. Gen. 
Grachev admitted the similarity of the two countries' military 
doctrines and accepted in principle an invitation to go to 
Israel on an official visit, although its date has not been 
fixed: "The question will be considered at expert level." 
Since last summer an Israeli military attache -- Colonel 
Mikha'el Shtiglits (before 1972, a USSR citizen) -- has been 
working in Moscow. At the same time the Russian Federation 
Defense Ministry is only planning to open its attache office in 
Tel Aviv. Gen. Grachev announced that "only after the attaches 
have elaborated on the problem will it be possible to talk about 
the prospects for military cooperation." 
  As a result, these talks between Generals Rabin and Grachev 
were devoted mainly to discussing the general political 
situation in the Middle East. A high-ranking participant in the 
negotiations on the Russian side told me that "matters of 
military and technical cooperation have not been discussed."

<F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS diplomatic correspondent Yuriy Tyssovskiy] </F>
  [Text] Moscow, 26 Apr -- The considerable similarity of 
Russian and Israeli military doctrines was stressed today by 
Russian Defense Minister Pavel Grachev after holding talks with 
Yitzhaq Rabin, Israeli prime minister and defense minister. The 
meeting lasted more than an hour. 
  During the meeting the head of the Israeli Government, who 
was a combat general in the recent past, set out the main 
principles of Israel's military doctrine. Theoretically 
Israel's defensive strategy corresponds to a considerable degree 
with our own doctrine -- both of them are based on defense, the 
Russian minister pointed out. The only difference is that we 
mould our defenses in different ways. Their effectiveness 
depends on equipment which both armies use. 
  Pavel Grachev stressed that the Russian leadership attaches 
special importance to the achievement of peace in the Near East 
since this region is in direct proximity to Russia's borders. 
Failure to settle Near East problems could have unpredictable 
consequences, including ethnic and religious ones, for the 
entire world, including Russia. In this connection it is 
essential to make every effort to bring about a political 
settlement of the Arab-Israeli conflict. This can only be 
achieved through joint efforts. 
  Pavel Grachev noted the importance of varied, including 
military, cooperation between Russia and Israel. Naturally, he 
said, from the results of the first meeting we cannot examine 
the possibilities opening up before us in detail. But a 
mechanism for implementing these plans already exists: a 
military attache from Israel is already working in Moscow, at 
the end of April or beginning of May the apparatus of a Russian 
military attache will be working in Israel. We shall charge 
them with working out the relevant program, Grachev said. Today 
our guest in his capacity as minister of defense has invited me 
to make an official visit to Israel, and there we shall outline 
a plan for our future bilateral relations in the military field. 
  Israel's prime minister stated that the Russian leadership, 
and first and foremost Russian President Boris Yeltsin, had 
assured him that Russia is striving to achieve the establishment 
of peace in the Near East. This striving, Y. Rabin said, we 
also share, although we have different contacts and relations 
with the third parties. When the aims are identical, however, 
corresponding interests also emerge that will, I hope, lead to 
the successful completion of the Arab-Israeli talks. 
  After the meeting Yitzhaq Rabin delivered a lecture to an 
audience at the Academy of the General Staff on the subject of 
military doctrine in Israel.

  [Text] Today, Yitzhaq Rabin told a group of journalists in 
Moscow that there continues to be a major chance of implementing 
the Near East peace process. Yitzhaq Rabin noted: 
  [Begin Rabin recording, in Hebrew, with superimposed Russian 
translation] At all events there is no doubt that public support 
for the peace process and agreement with the PLO [brief break in 
transmission] a consequence of certain political views. This is 
the natural result of the disillusionment of very many of our 
people. People are disappointed that, while the talks seem to 
be continuing, the number of terrorist acts is not only not 
declining but, in terms of the number of casualties...[pauses] 
More and more people are suffering. This is a direct result of 
the fact that Hamas [Islamic Resistance Movement] and the 
Islamic Jihad, which are responsible for this terror, are headed 
by extremists and religious fanatics, who will go to any lengths 
to strangle the peace process. [end recording]

<F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS diplomatic correspondent Yuriy Tyssovskiy] </F>
  [Text] Moscow April 26 TASS -- Israeli Prime Minister 
Yitzhaq Rabin told a news conference at the Russian Foreign 
Ministry's press center here today he is grateful to the Russian 
president for his invitation to come to Russia on an official 
visit. This is the first Moscow visit of an Israeli premier. 
  Yitzhaq Rabin noted the role of the Soviet Union in creation 
of the Israeli state, including military support without which, 
in the words of Rabin, Israel would hardly complete the war for 
independence with a success. Then, there was 40-years-long 
absence of any relations between the two states. 
  Rabin said the current Russian policy aims to achieve peace 
in the Middle East and other world regions. 
  Russia, same as the United States, may play a positive 
encouraging role in making Arabs and Israelis to put an end to 
violence, terror and war, said Rabin. At the same time, neither 
co-sponsor can substitute parties to the conflict or stop the 
conflict and bring peace to the region on its own. 
  Speaking of the Russian-Israeli relations, the prime 
minister 
said the Moscow negotiations resulted in signing of six 
agreements. On Wednesday the sides are expected to sign the most 
important document -- on the free trade zone. These documents 
will be a good basis for the development of bilateral 
cooperation in agriculture, science, tourism and other spheres, 
stressed the official. 
  The Moscow negotiations also discussed a possibility to 
establish broader relations and more close contact between the 
two defence systems. He said the sides will work for positive 
changes in relations of giant Russia and small, but proud and 
independent Israel. This will be a new start for the 
development of good relations between the two states. Yitzhaq 
Rabin thinks these relations will be even better under new 
conditions. 
  The Israeli Government head stressed he does not agree with 
the idea to convene the 2nd Madrid conference and thinks 
bilateral negotiations of Israel and its Arab opponents would do 
better. He hopes that the Cairo negotiations with Palestinians 
will result in an agreement to be implemented in a short period. 
  This will create a new reality and enable Palestinians to 
regulate their life themselves. It is not a complete autonomy, 
but the one without any damage to Israel, said Rabin. 
  Speaking of the reasons for delayed implementation of the 
Gaza-Jericho agreement, the official said they are unforeseen 
circumstances. The dates were changed because a corresponding 
agreement was not achieved, he said. 
  The Israeli prime minister sharply criticized the 
fundamentalist radical groups of Hamas and al-Jihad al-Islam 
which orient at "Khomeynism without Khomeyni". Their aim is to 
torpedo the peace process, stressed the Israeli official. The 
only possible response is boosted negotiations and achievement 
of a viable agreement with due account of the sides' interests. 
  Rabin called against the deployment of international forces 
from the U.S. And Russia in the Gaza Strip and the Jericho area. 
He said the co-sponsors should not risk the life of their 
citizens at this stage. 
  In the opinion of Yitzhaq Rabin, peace in the Middle East 
can 
be achieved on condition of peace between Arabs and Israel and 
control over actions of Iran, which is striving to blast the 
regional situation. 
  Speaking of the Russian relations with Arab states, the 
prime 
minister stressed they should be considered from the point of 
view of their influence on the peace process. Rabin reaffirmed 
the Israeli readiness to withdraw troops from Syrian Golan 
Heights, that is the most painful compromises in exchange for 
peace. At the same time, geographic scale of the withdrawal 
will depend on how profound the peace agreements would be, he 
said. 
  Rabin denied Israel and Lebanon have a territorial dispute. 
When the Lebanese Government provide for security of the 
Israeli northern borders from encroachments of the pro-Iranian 
Hezbollah group, Israel will be ready to liquidate this safety 
zone on the south of the neighbouring state, he said. 
  Tomorrow morning the prime minister will complete the 
official part of his visit and leave for St. Petersburg.

  [Text] In an exclusive interview to Ostankino, [Israeli 
Prime Minister] Yitzhaq Rabin expressed his satisfaction that 
the main purpose of Russian policy in the Middle East is to 
ensure peace, security, and stability. The Israeli prime 
minister believes that by making its actions in the 
international arena more active last month, our country is 
entering a new period of foreign and domestic policy. As far as 
the Middle East settlement is concerned, Yitzhaq Rabin highly 
estimated the role of Russia and the United States as mediators 
in the progress of the Israeli-Palestinian dialogue. However, 
he believes the solution of the problem depends, above all, on 
the sides involved in the conflict. The prime minister 
expressed Israel's interest in extending bilateral contacts with 
Russia and said in future they will spread to the military 
sphere. Yitzhaq Rabin believes the forthcoming visit by Defense 
Minister Pavel Grachev to Tel Aviv will be the first step in the 
development of Israeli-Russian cooperation in this field.

<F P=106> [By Diplomatic Correspondents Igor Porshnev, Vitaly </F>
Trubetskoy and others] 
  [Text] Russia is interested in the development of "good 
relations" with Israel. In this aspect the visit to Moscow of 
Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin was "fruitful," Russian 
Deputy Foreign Minister Boris Kolokolov told Interfax on 
Wednesday. 
  In his opinion, the time wasted as a result of the break-off 
of diplomatic relations "did not give Moscow more opportunities 
to promote a peaceful solution in the Middle East." 
  Kolokolov expressed satisfaction with the content of 
"detailed" talks between Rabin and Russian Foreign Minister 
Andrey Kozyrev on the problems of the Middle East settlement. 
They discussed the fate of Palestinian territories (Gaza and 
Jericho) which are now being liberated. "The main problem is 
how to organize the transitional period better so that by its 
end in two to three years normal Palestinian self-government 
structures can be formed there. We are satisfied with the 
discussion of this problem with the Israeli leader," Kolokolov 
said. 
  He noted that Rabin expressed interest in continuation of 
Israel's talks on the Syrian, Jordan and Lebanese questions. 
  Speaking about the prospect for calling a peace conference 
Madrid-2 at Russia's initiative, Kolokolov said that during 
talks in Moscow, the Israeli premier "did not deny such a 
possibility in principle." "At the same time, Russia and Israel 
understand that it is unrealistic to call Madrid-2 tomorrow or 
the day after tomorrow. It should be thoroughly prepared. The 
purpose of this conference is to summarize the results of the 
latest stage and to consider the possibility of intensifying 
activities in various directions. By the way, problems 
occurring at the bilateral talks could be a subject of 
discussions at Madrid-2," Kolokolov said. 
  Speaking about the supplies of Russian arms to Syria which 
concern Israel, Kolokolov referred just to spare parts for 
weapons which were supplied earlier. "I understand the concerns 
of the Israeli side, but Syrians are also worried about supplies 
of new Western arms to Israel. Besides, Russia is not supplying 
offensive arms to anybody. We can talk just about supplies of 
spare parts and "defense weapons" to Syria. And if we do not 
sell military equipment to Syrians, other countries can do 
that," the diplomat said. 
  He noted that Russia will do all it can to help Tel-Aviv 
find 
prisoners and missing Israeli soldiers. "We promised to get 
involved in that and to ask corresponding Arabic countries, 
where these people can be, in the first place Syria. Russian 
first vice-premier Oleg Soskovets now visiting Damascus has 
already been instructed duly," Kolokolov said. 
  Speaking about the withdrawal of Israeli troops from Gaza 
and 
Jericho, he noted that "Tel-Aviv promised to do that in the near 
future." "The delay in the withdrawal can be explained by 
technical reasons. Preliminarily, it is necessary to prepare 
the Palestinian police and that needs time and money. Israel 
has already urged a number of Western countries to ask for a 
certain sum for the formation of the Palestinian police," 
Kolokolov said.

<F P=106> [Konstantin Eggert report on interview with Israeli Prime </F>
Minister Yitzhaq Rabin: "Yitzhaq Rabin: `Russia and America 
Should Help Us, Not Reach Agreement on Our Behalf'"] 
  [Text] Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhaq Rabin received 
correspondents from IZVESTIYA, KRASNAYA ZVEZDA, and Radio Ekho 
Moskvy at the government residence on Kosygin Street. Like most 
politicians, the head of the Israeli Government basically 
preferred to talk about what he thought was important, thus 
avoiding giving answers to tough questions. 
  The premier acknowledged that in the short term the peace in 
the Near East will be a peace between leaders rather than 
peoples. "There is a big gap between peace in name only and the 
peace that passes via the hearts of people," he said. Rabin 
noted that Arab leaders agreed to talk with Israel only because 
they realized they could achieve nothing by violence against the 
Jewish state. "We are not cutting our military expenditure, 
since our military might is a guarantee of security and a 
guarantee that the talks will continue. It is a factor which 
encourages the strengthening of trends toward a peaceful 
political solution," the prime minister stated. 
  Yitzhaq Rabin addressed the topic of Islamic fundamentalism, 
which is particularly alarming to the Israelis. In his opinion, 
the danger is posed not so much by extremists from Hamas who are 
directly threatening the lives of Israelis, but by the spread of 
"Khomeyni-ism without Khomeyni," even in countries in the region 
that are located a long way from Israel. "Fundamentalism is 
undermining the stability of moderate Arab regimes as a whole, 
and this is our problem too," Rabin believes. 
  The premier refused to say how he regarded the prospects of 
his Labor Party, and his own prospects, in future parliamentary 
elections in the wake of the Hebron massacre, which demonstrated 
how far the opponents of peace among the Jews themselves are 
prepared to go. However, he acknowledged that the popularity of 
the peace process has declined throughout large sections of 
Israeli society. 
  "Many people ask me," the premier continued, "why we need 
peace when any fanatic can strap explosives around his waist and 
destroy a passenger bus? How can we be certain that 'Arafat, 
once he has assumed control of the Gaza sector with its 750,000 
Palestinians, many of whom will remain terrorists until the end 
of their days, will be able to ensure order there?" 
  "I belong to the category of politicians who are convinced 
that the risk is great, but this risk also engenders hope, and 
it should be given a chance," the head of the Israeli Government 
stated. "Needless to say, this will be a big test for Yasir 
'Arafat as well." 
  Diplomatic politeness obliged Yitzhaq Rabin to say only 
agreeable things about Russia, despite the fact that a certain 
strain was very evident in bilateral relations back in March. 
At that time his cabinet, backed by Washington, was extremely 
skeptical about Moscow's proposal to start preparing the second 
stage of the Madrid peace conference. "I see no disagreements 
between the cochairmen of the peace conference -- Russia and the 
United States," the prime minister said. "Their task is to help 
the two sides directly responsible for stopping the war; they 
can also agree between themselves, but they should certainly not 
conclude any agreements on the two sides' behalf."

  [Text] St. Petersburg April 27 TASS -- Israeli Prime 
Minister Yitzhaq Rabin, who is currently in Russia on an 
official visit, on Wednesday arrived in St. Petersburg, the 
hometown of his mother. 
  On his way from the airport, the Israeli premier laid 
flowers 
at the monument to the heroic defenders of the city during the

  [Text] St. Petersburg April 27 TASS -- Israeli Prime 
Minister Yitzhaq Rabin gave a short news conference at the end 
of his one-day visit to St. Petersburg on Wednesday. 
  Before leaving by plane for Tel-Aviv, Rabin expressed hope 
that fulfilment of the bilateral agreements signed earlier in 
Moscow will contribute to developing cooperation between the two 
countries. 
  The Israeli prime minister met with deputy head of St. 
Petersburg administration Aleksey Kudrin. The exchange of ideas 
proved useful for the Russian party, because Israel earlier used 
to tackle the problems which Russia faces now. These include 
controlling the inflation, privatization (especially, 
privatization of housing construction) and developing the 
agro-industrial complex. 
  Asked to comment on his decision to fly aboard an ordinary 
Israeli plane together with 170 emigrants from Kiev and 25 from 
St. Petersburg, rather than aboard a chartered one, like he did 
when he arrived in Russia, Rabin said he wanted to share -- if 
only for once -- the sentiments of those who had made the hard 
choice to leave their birth-places for ever.

  [Text] Damascus, 26 Apr -- Oleg Soskovets, first deputy 
chairman of the Russian Federation Government, who is on an 
official visit to Syria, today held talks with General Mustafa 
Talas, the Syrian deputy prime minister and minister of defense. 
  Yuriy Mikhaylov, the vice premier's advisor, told an 
ITAR-TASS correspondent that the prospects for bilateral 
cooperation were examined at the meeting. During the talks Oleg 
Soskovets noted that Russia continues to view Syria as a 
friendly state. "We must not waste all that we have achieved 
before in our relations," he said. "We have been friends for too 
long." 
  Mustafa Talas supported the position of the Russian first 
vice premier. Nevertheless, the general noted a certain cooling 
in mutual relations between the two states, particularly in the 
last few years. He spoke of Syria's readiness to open a new 
page in cooperation with Russia. 
  Oleg Soskovets described the agreement on cooperation 
between 
our two countries, which is being prepared for signing within 
the framework of the Russian delegation's visit, as first and 
foremost a political step. "The position of the Russian 
leadership is clear -- to enter into normal cooperation," he 
stressed.

  [Text] Damascus, April 27 (TASS) -- A Russian Government 
delegation, led by First Vice-Premier Oleg Soskovets, is to 
complete its three-day official visit to Syria on Wednesday. A 
cooperation agreement is to be signed as a result of the talks. 
  Soskovets is also scheduled to meet with Syrian President 
Hafez al-Asad later in the day. Everything seems to indicate 
that Soskovets will leave for Moscow by air on Wednesday 
afternoon. 
  When addressing members of the Syrian business community on 
Tuesday, Soskovets pointed out that the Russian delegation "is 
authorised to restore the partially lost economic and political 
contacts". 
  The two sides admitted that the current state of 
trade-and-economic cooperation does not meet the interests of 
the two states. Oleg Davydov, Russian minister for foreign 
economic relations, believes that in order to straighten out the 
historically established relations between Russia and Syria, it 
is essential to sign two agreements soon, namely, on the 
protection of investments and on the prevention of double 
taxation. Besides, Davydov suggested founding several 
jointly-run Russo-Syrian banks. 
  As far as the rather delicate Syrian debt issue is 
concerned, 
the two sides consider that a political decision on it should be 
made. For its part, Syria reaffirmed its readiness to repay the 
current debt to Russia. 
  The work on agreements, which are being prepared for 
signature, is proceding with difficulty, Yuriy Mikhaylov, 
adviser to the first vice-premier, told ITAR-TASS on Tuesday. 
He said the Russian side had expressed readiness to offset more 
than 80 percent of the Syrian debt which is known to have 
amounted to about 10,000 million U.S. dollars. 
  The Russian side suggested the following formula as regards 
the remaining 20 percent of the debt: 60 percent of this amount 
is to be repaid by Damascus in freely convertible currency and 
the other 40 percent are to be redeemed with consumer goods on a 
ten-year instalment plan. However, the formula proved 
unacceptable to Syria. For its part, Damascus would like Russia 
to offset 92 percent of the debt, Mikhaylov said. 
  At the close of the second round of the talks, the two sides 
agreed to continue work on a debt agreement at expert groups' 
level and voiced hope that it would be signed before the Russian 
vice-premier meets President Al-Asad.

  [Text] Damascus, 27 Apr -- Oleg Soskovets, Russian first 
deputy prime minister, who is here on an official visit, and 
Syrian Defense Minister Mustafa Talas, today signed an agreement 
on military-technical cooperation. 
  After the signing of the document, the Russian first deputy 
prime minister said that the Russian president considers it 
essential to resume cooperation between the two states that has 
been partially lost of late. The signing of today's agreement, 
Oleg Soskovets noted, shows the desire of Moscow and Syria to 
engage in systematic cooperation in the military-technical 
sphere. 
  Mustafa Talas appraised the agreement as "a first step in 
the 
right direction." He expressed the need for a restoration of 
the former relationship with Russia. In this respect, he 
particularly emphasized that Damascus "has strong friends in 
Moscow." "The agreement signed today is evidence of this," he 
said. 
  As for the essence of the document, an ITAR-TASS 
correspondent was told by a well-informed source in the Russian 
delegation that it is evidence of the beginning of a new 
relationship. The two sides agreed to form a working 
commission, which will set about its work in a few weeks' time. 
  Today, too, Oleg Soskovets had a three-hour meeting with 
Syrian President Hafiz al-Asad. According to the deputy prime 
minister, the Syrian head of state supported the main positions 
in the agreement on military-technical cooperation. 
  After the signing of the agreement, Oleg Soskovets left by 
air for Moscow.

  [Text] Russia is firmly convinced that supporters of terror 
in South Africa will not manage to impede the advent of a new 
society, that South Africans will make their choice in favor of 
democracy and peace in the country, a spokesman for the Russian 
Foreign Ministry, Grigory Karasin, told a briefing in Moscow 
Tuesday. 
  Karasin pointed out that for the first time in South 
Africa's 
history its people cast their ballots for a non-racial 
parliament. 
  According to Karasin, Russia, which made a considerable 
contribution to dismantling the apartheid regime, believes in a 
new South Africa's future. U.N.-sponsored Russian observers in 
South Africa and a number of official observers from Russia are 
another sign of this, the diplomat said. 
  At the same time, Karasin pointed out that in South Africa 
there remained forces which did not hope to win electors' 
sympathy in a fair struggle under equal conditions and vainly 
tried to stop the historical process and torpedo the elections. 
"This is how the explosion of a car in Johannesburg near the 
building where the ANC headquarters and affiliates of a number 
of other political parties are situated should be understood," 
Karasin pointed out.

<F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS diplomatic correspondent Andrey Golubov] </F>
  [Text] Moscow, 27 Apr -- The visit to Moscow and the talks 
held here with heads of various Russian ministries and 
departments, as well as with entrepreneurs, have borne an 
exclusively constructive character, Panamanian Foreign Affairs 
Minister Jose Raul Mulino told the ITAR-TASS correspondent 
before flying off to St. Petersburg. "Although the visit to 
Russia -- the first since diplomatic relations were set up 
between the countries in March 1991 -- was most of all one of 
fact-finding, our delegation leaves Moscow with a full portfolio 
of specific ideas that we intend to implement in the very near 
future," the head of Panama's Foreign Ministry emphasized. 
  The most important result of the trip was the signing, after 
talks, by J.R. Mulino and his Russian colleague Andrey Kozyrev 
of a declaration on principles for mutual activities and 
cooperation between the Russian Federation and the Republic of 
Panama. The foreign ministers agreed to reorganize the 
consulates general and embassies of the two countries. In the 
opinion of J.R. Mulino and A. Kozyrev, this step raises the 
level of bilateral relations to that of full diplomacy, thereby 
opening new possibilities for unhampered, mutually advantageous 
links. 
  Besides his meeting with the head of the Russian Foreign 
Ministry, J.R. Mulino during his three-day visit to Moscow, held 
talks with the heads of the State Committee for the Management 
of State Property, the Russian Federal Assembly's Committee on 
International Affairs, and other Russian ministries and 
departments. The Panamanian minister also had a meeting at 
Kredo-Bank with representatives of the capital's financial 
circles. The cultural program for the Panamanian delegation's 
stay in Moscow included visiting the Bolshoy Theater and the 
Moscow Kremlin. 
  In the opinion of the head of the Panamanian Foreign 
Ministry 
there is enormous potential for the development of bilateral 
trade and economic relations. J.R. Mulino is certain that 
Panama, which possesses one of the biggest free trade zones in 
the Western hemisphere and a powerful international banking 
center, could be of inestimable service to Russia in the sphere 
of mastering financial know-how. In addition, the Panamanian 
side could assist Russia in setting up (?free trade) zones and 
insuring their normal functioning, [words indistinct], and also 
pass on some useful experience regarding the creation of 
legislation (?to insure the normal) development of the economy. 
On the other hand, if Russia fulfills its trade and investment 
potential on the Panamanian market, J.R. Mulino considers, this 
could make it possible for Russian businessmen to do without the 
services of European middlemen when buying many goods and 
products that, in turn, will in the end make the prices finally 
charged to the consumer for these goods and products more 
acceptable. 
  The head of the Latin American country's foreign policy 
department confirmed the intention that he expressed the 
previous day about organizing a visit to Moscow by a large group 
of Panamanian bankers and businessmen within the next three 
months; they would concern themselves with drawing up and 
implementing concrete trade and economic projects. The 
Panamanian side expects a similar step by Russia. 
  "Having seen with my own eyes the difficulties that your 
country is facing in its attempts to overcome the economic 
crisis, I am still confident that the next few years are very 
promising for Russia in terms of economic development," the 
Panamanian minister noted. I sincerely wish Russia success, he 
stressed at the end of the conversation. 
  It is expected that during his one-day stay in St. 
Petersburg 
J.R. Mulino will meet the leadership of the mayor's office in 
the city on the Neva, as well as representatives of local 
business circles. After this he will return home.

  [Summary from poor reception] The DPRK has decided to 
allow the International Atomic Energy Agency [IAEA] to inspect 
nuclear facilities in Yongbyon near Pyongyang. This has evoked 
a positive reaction among countries concerned. Pyongyang had 
not permitted the agency's special inspection of DPRK nuclear 
facilities in Yongbyon, and are thus suspected of developing 
nuclear weapons. 
  As the dispute over the nuclear issue of the peninsula 
further deteriorated, the position of some neighboring countries 
became more hardline. First of all, Pyongyang, Seoul, and 
Washington respectively assumed hardline positions. Pyongyang 
complained about the IAEA's unfair attitude in dealing with the 
North Korean nuclear issue. This made the IAEA's inspection 
more difficult. 
  On the other hand, the United States and the ROK were 
attempting to apply pressure on Pyongyang by talking about 
imposing economic saanctions or resuming the Team Spirity joint 
military exercise. 
  U.S. Secretary of State Cristopher said that the change in 
Pyongyang's position toward the IAEA's inspections is a good, 
positive phenomenon. 
  Son Song-pil, DPRK ambassador to Russia, said that the IAEA 
inspection team scheduled to arrive in Yongbyon will be provided 
with all the conditions necessary for its work. 
  We can say that such a position of Pyongyang totally 
corresponds not only with the interests of the DPRK itself but 
also with the interests of other countries.

  [Text] Moscow April 28 TASS -- The Russian Foreign Ministry 
positively appraised the appointment of Koji Kakizawa on 
Thursday to the post of Japanese foreign minister. 
  A high-ranking representative of the Russian Foreign Office 
noted in an interview with ITAR-TASS that Kakizawa "was long 
known as a man who actively participated in implementing 
Japanese foreign policy in many spheres, including the problem 
of ensuring security and settlement in Cambodia. 
  As for relations with Russia, the diplomat noted, "We 
proceed 
from a premise that they will constructively develop in the 
spirit of the positive tenor which is characteristic of the 
bilateral dialogue after the Tokyo visit by President Boris 
Yeltsin last October". 
  Kakizawa who was parliamentary deputy of the Japanese 
foreign 
minister in the past, repeatedly pointed to the need for 
"serious efforts to establish closer and normal relations 
between Japan and such important neighbour as the Russian 
Federation", stressing that these should be "long-term relations 
of friendship" turned to the 21st Century.

<F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS correspondent Vasiliy Golovnin] </F>
  [Text] Tokyo, April 27 (TASS) -- The Japanese Ministry for 
Foreign Trade and Industry has asked Russia to send its special 
representative to North Korea in order to personally control the 
scrapping of Russian submarines sold to the Korean People's 
Democratic Republic, which will rule out their use for military 
purposes. Otherwise, Tokyo theatens to block the deal, which is 
being effected with Japanese mediation. 
  ITAR-TASS was informed about this action by a representative 
of the "Toen Shioji" firm, which had organised the contract to 
deliver decommissioned Russian submarines to North Korea. He 
confirmed that, in accordance with the Japanese legislation, the 
government had the right to licence deals connected with 
potential armaments and that local firms were prohibited effect 
such transactions abroad. According to available information, 
the Russian side has still not replied to the demand to send a 
special representative to North Korea. 
  A senior official of the Japanese Ministry for Foreign Trade 
and Industry refused to comment on this information. However, 
he said that the Russian side had informed Tokyo through the 
Japanese Embassy in Moscow that the decommissioned submarines 
were being sold to North Korea as scrap metal and could not be 
regarded as military hardware. 
  A representative of the "Toen Shioji" firm said that only 
one 
decommissioned and disarmed submarine was so far delivered to 
North Korea where it was already scrapped. Under the 
above-mentioned contract, twelve Russian submarines, which are 
now being kept in half-sunken condition and are heavily 
rust-eaten, are to be delivered to North Korea. However, at 
present the "Toen Shioji" will have to get a separate permission 
from Japanese authorities to deliver each of them to North Korea. 
  The hullabaloo around this deal was raised in January, when 
the American press reported that Moscow, with Japanese 
mediation, had allegedly sold to North Korea a whole fleet of 40 
decommissioned diesel submarines, capable of carrying 20 
torpedoes each and laying sea mines. U.S. special services, the 
newspaper "ASAHI" wrote, had expressed apprehensions to Tokyo 
that those submarines could be used for military purposes.

<F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS correspondent Aleksey Kuznetsov] </F>
  [Text] New Delhi April 28 TASS -- "Prospects for 
Russo-Indian cooperation in military aviation are unlimited," 
Rostislav Belyakov, designer-general of the Mikoyan Design 
Bureau, told ITAR-TASS on Thursday. He attended a session of 
the Russo-Indian commission on aviation among a 
widely-representative delegation of the Russian aircraft 
industry and a number of leading design bureaus. 
  "A specific example of such cooperation has been provided by 
the initialing of an agreement in Delhi on the establishment of 
a joint venture for the maintenance of MiG aircraft that are in 
service with the Indian Air Force and for the manufacture of 
spare parts for them," Belyakov said. 
  "Along with our design bureau, the agreement was initialed 
by 
representatives from the `Moscow Aircraft Industry Amalgametion' 
and the Hindustan Aeronautics Ltd (HAL) company. 
  "The realisation of the agreement will began immediately 
after it is approved by the governments of the two countries. 
This is expected to be done during the forthcoming visit of 
Indian Prime Minister P.V. Narasimha Rao to Moscow in summer," 
Belyakov said. 
  The two sides discussed the technical aspects modernising 
MiG-21- Bis aircraft, which are to be fitted out with Russian-, 
Indian- and Western-made equipment, at HAL enterprises. The 
aircraft will be provided with new weapons and systems to 
control them and on-board instrumentation. This will increase 
the aircraft's combat potential several-fold, including its 
target spotting capability, Belyakov said. 
  Touching upon prospects for the purchase of an additional 
batch of Russian aircraft by India, Belyakov said it showed 
interest in buying ten MiG-29 aircraft. The Russian delegation 
officially offered a MiG-at training aircraft which the Air 
Force of the republic acutely needs, and suggested that the 
Indian side not only purchase these aircraft, which by their 
performance excel the British Hawk and the French Alpha jet 
aircraft which compete for the local market, but also co-develop 
and produce them.

  [Text] Jurmala, 26 Apr -- Groups of experts from the two 
countries' delegations started work in Jurmala today within the 
framework of the preparations for the meeting of the presidents 
of Latvia and Russia. Sergey Zotov, head of the Russian 
delegation, noted that amendments cannot be made to the already 
initialled package of agreements, which consists of four 
documents. However, the interests of the Latvian side will 
possibly be taken into account during discussion of the 
mechanism for implementing individual points. 
  Reaffirming Russia's willingness to withdraw its troops from 
Latvia by 31 August, Zotov stressed that only the signing of the 
entire package of documents relating to the withdrawal of the 
army units would be acceptable to Russia. 
  In his turn Guntis Ulmanis, as was reported at his office, 
is 
insisting on the introduction of substantial corrections into 
the agreement on social protection for military pensioners 
resident in Latvia. Today representatives of the foreign policy 
departments of the two countries will set the date in Moscow for 
the meeting with President Yeltsin.

"Uzbekistan: Francois Mitterrand Meets Six Centuries of 
History"] 
  [Excerpts] Tashkent -- [passage omitted] In coming here, 
[French President] Mitterrand thinks it will be easier to 
straddle almost six centuries of history because, in the 
meantime, Uzbekistan itself had disappeared from the world 
political map. "We had not had relations for a long time," he 
said, "because Uzbekistan was not a sovereign country and the 
Uzbek people could not express themselves as such." The 
collapse of the USSR solved that. The French president's visit 
almost has the character of a historical reparation when 
Mitterrand states that it makes it possible "to update the very 
ancient ties between our two countries." At least President 
Mitterrand is the first Western head of state to visit Tashkent 
and, at a time when Uzbekistan (a sovereign country for five 
years and independent for three years) is urgently seeking an 
identity, this is significant: It is a unique diplomatic 
exercise which, according to protocol, merely returns the Uzbek 
president's visit to Paris last October. [passage omitted] 
  But, on regaining its state, Uzbekistan has certainly not 
become the home of human rights: Oppositionists are in exile or 
in prison, and the press only prints the official truth. 
Moreover, Islam Karimov, who traded his title as first 
secretary of the Communist Party for that of president of the 
Republic, displays no democratic aspirations. His favorite word 
is stability. 
  This robust Uzbek strode toward Mitterrand, confident of his 
power. About 10 French entrepreneurs, invited to launch the 
economic conquest of Uzbekistan, left the president's Concorde. 
Who knows? Mitterrand is dreaming of the metaphysical aim of 
his visit: his meditation at the tomb of Tamerlan [14th century 
amir] tomorrow evening in Samarkand.

<F P=106> [Address by President Boris Yeltsin at the signing of the </F>
Treaty on Social Accord in St. George's Hall in the Kremlin -- 
live] 
  [Text] Esteemed participants in the assembly of civic 
accord: 
  On 26 April Andrey Daynisovich Ayzderdzis, State Duma and 
Federal Assembly deputy, died in tragic circumstances. Let 
common grief become another warning against violence. Let 
common grief join us in a quest for accord and peace for the 
whole of Russia and all Russian people. Before the beginning of 
the solemn ceremony for the signing of the Treaty on Social 
[obshchestvennyy] Accord I regard it as our common duty to pay 
our respects to the fallen deputy with a minute of silence. 
  Please be seated. 
  Esteemed participants in the assembly of civil accord, dear 
compatriots: Today a historic event is taking place in St. 
George's Hall in the Kremlin. Leaders of the Russian 
Government, Federation Council, and State Duma, leaders of the 
Constitutional, Supreme, and Arbitration Courts, and 
representatives of the State Duma factions are gathered here. 
Leaders of Russia's republics and regions, leaders of trade 
unions, parties, movements, and public associations and heads of 
religious confessions are among us. Representatives of the 
Public Chamber, deputies, and Russia's well-known public figures 
are present at the assembly. 
  We have different convictions and views as to what Russia 
should be, but we have a single, most important goal, which has 
managed to unite us -- ensuring civil peace in Russia. This is 
the most important thing today. 
  Almost eight decades ago our country suffered a terrible 
tragedy. Russia was thrown into the bottomless abyss of civil 
war. Brother fought against brother, sons against fathers, and 
a bloody boundary divided people up into Whites and Reds, into 
us and them, and into enemies of each other. 
  From that time onward the curse of that war has been hanging 
over Russia. It is reflected in the genocide of the Cossacks, 
in the enforced collectivization which destroyed the flower of 
the peasantry. It is reflected in the repressions and 
deportations of peoples, in the punishment of the deprivation of 
citizenship and banishment from one's homeland. 
  The curse of civil war is reflected in the Novocherkassk 
shooting of 1962 [shooting of participants in peaceful workers 
demonstration], and in the events of August 1991 and of May and 
October 1993. 
  The bloody sequence of such events must be brought to a 
halt. 
This was not done by our grandfathers or fathers and we must do 
it ourselves. We are duty bound to do it, so as to hand a 
peaceful Russia on to our children, so as to draw the shadow of 
civil war away from Russia, a shadow that has been cast upon it 
for all these years. 
  We must turn over the tragic page of history and put a final 
stop to civil confrontation. I believe that we have enough will 
and wisdom to achieve this. 
  The Treaty on Social Accord is being signed in St. George's 
Hall in the Kremlin today. Any party, any organization, and any 
public movement may join the treaty. All those who are ready to 
take upon themselves the responsibility for civic peace and 
stability in Russia can join the treaty. The chief idea of this 
document is to refrain from using force to achieve political 
aims. All those who sign the Treaty on Social Accord pledge not 
to violate this ban. 
  Today we are all united in the view that there is not and 
cannot be any goal which could be achieved at the expense of 
blood and human life. By signing the treaty we confirm that 
only peaceful and only constitutional methods are permissible in 
Russia's policy. This is the basis of the accord, the basis of 
the state's normal work, and the basis of people's calm life. 
We are creating it through joint efforts, and I hope that our 
efforts will be supported by others. 
  The Treaty on Social Accord is being concluded for two years 
-- for the period of most complicated and painful 
transformations. We have satisfied ourselves that while there 
is a confrontation, no matter who is in power, there will be no 
real results. A fruitless and exhausting struggle will not 
allow anyone to work, it will not allow the resolution of a 
single problem. The price of it is too high for the state and 
every citizen. We need to put an end to it. 
  Today we are taking a decisive step toward this. We want 
peace in Russia. We want our democratic, united Russian state 
to be strengthened. The treaty will make it possible to unite 
the efforts of the whole of society around the most important 
problems. We will resolve them if we manage to counter disunity 
and mutual antagonism with cooperation based on dialogue. 
Russia is in acute need of this. The preparation of the treaty 
is the best evidence that cooperation is not a fruitless dream 
but a real possibility. 
  This document came into being as a result of strenuous, 
creative work in which representatives of the president, groups 
in parliament, the government, leading parties, organizations, 
and public movements played an equal part. They expressed the 
interests of virtually all sections of the Russian population. 
They reached accord during their work. Every clause of the 
treaty, every line was entered only if it met with no 
objections, no matter from whom. Every voice carried identical 
weight and was of identical significance. I have said, and let 
me repeat, that what has been done demonstrates that Russia does 
have an alternative to confrontation. We are duty-bound to 
defend this, duty-bound to continue the tireless search for 
accord, in order to emerge from the crisis, to revive the 
economy, and to restore order in the country. 
  In accordance with the Treaty on Social Accord a 
coordination 
commission is being set up. For the first time Russia will have 
a mechanism which will ensure that political contradictions do 
not reach extremes of acuteness, but can be resolved at an early 
stage. Russia is tired of the stream of mutual insults from 
various rostrums, of endless clashes in the media. We no longer 
want wars of words to turn into clashes on the streets and mass 
disturbances. Therefore, we say today that there is another way 
-- civilized rather than destructive -- of settling issues. 
  This is the search for accord and it should be the only one 
in Russia. The treaty to be signed today is only a beginning. 
It is hardly on all the points that we have managed to work out 
a common position and much work is yet ahead. In developing the 
treaty, appendices will be drawn up, protocols which will be 
more specific on separate aspects of it. I think that the 
general, strategic policies guiding the work are set out in the 
message from the president to the Federal Assembly. Our common 
task is to give these more substance and to implement them 
consistently. 
  Respected assembly participants, it took us many years to 
get 
to the Treaty on Social Accord. Several generations of people 
have come and gone. Hardly any of those who lived through the 
tragedy of the civil war are still alive. There was no 
reconciliation throughout this entire period. So, a deep wound 
has remained in our people and in our state. 
  A historic chance came to us to start a process of 
reconciliation and to restore consensus in the country. It will 
not be easy to do it. Confrontation still lives in our souls. 
Let us help one another to rid ourselves of it. Let us help 
Russia to cure itself once and for all of civil war, in the name 
of preserving the Fatherland and in the name of preserving peace 
for our children. May our combined efforts meet with success. I 
declare the ceremony for the signing of the Treaty on Social 
Accord open.

<F P=106> [Closing speech by Russian President Boris Yeltsin at </F>
signing ceremony of the Social Accord Treaty in the St. George's 
Hall of the Moscow Kremlin -- live] 
  [Text] Esteemed participants in the assembly! The Treaty 
on Social Accord has become a reality in Russian life. In 
signing it we had only one objective: to strengthen civic peace 
in the country, to make the life of Russian citizens more stable 
and tranquil. The treaty does not harm the interests of any 
party, organization, or association. Each signatory, while 
remaining committed to his own convictions and programs, will 
uphold them in an honest and peaceful political struggle for the 
votes of the electorate. 
  The treaty places additional responsibilities and 
obligations 
on all those who signed it, above all on state bodies. It 
spells out the priority tasks which must be resolved by the 
president, the government, the Federal Assembly, and the bodies 
of power in the republics and regions. These tasks must be 
resolved, not separately but in close cooperation with each 
other, with the political and public forces of Russia. 
  The most important thing now is to implement the treaty 
which 
we have signed. Every one of us who has signed it and will sign 
it undertakes the role of guarantor of implementation of this 
document. I am sure that the mass media and the Russian public 
will undertake to monitor compliance with the treaty. But the 
highest guarantee of the treaty's implementation will be our 
practical deeds in the spirit of cooperation and mutual trust. 
  On behalf of those present, I invite all those for whom the 
idea of accord and civic peace are dear to join the Treaty on 
Social Accord. Today it has been signed and comes into force. 
With all my heart, I congratulate the participants in the 
assembly and the Russian citizens on this remarkable event. We 
will spare no effort to ensure that civic peace becomes 
established in Russia forever. Thank you.

<F P=106> [Speech by Vladimir Shumeyko, chairman of the Federation </F>
Council, at ceremony of signing the Treaty on Social Accord in 
the St. George's Hall of the Moscow Kremlin -- live] 
  [Text] Esteemed Boris Nikolayevich [Yeltsin], Your Holiness 
[Aleksiy II], esteemed colleagues, ladies and gentlemen. I am 
very rarely nervous in front of any audience but today I feel I 
am overcome by emotions. I am joining all those who regard 
today as an historic day. I hope that this spring day on the 
eve of Easter 1994 will become a truly historic milestone. 
Today's document, the Treaty on Social Accord, is based on 
accord between politicians and state and public figures. But I 
hope that this treaty is not for politicians, public figures, or 
the state. I hope that this treaty, which was signed today, is 
for ordinary people, Russians, and the entire people because it 
is ordinary people who are most of all fed up with the political 
battles which have been going on for the last five years, 
tormenting our society, and precluding Russia from working 
calmly for the benefit of ordinary people. In their every 
speech politicians are saying that they express the interests of 
these people. As a participant in the legislative process of 
the past years I can tell you in all openness that this document 
is of enormous importance for us, legislators, for the upper 
chamber, the Federation Council, and, I hope, for the State Duma. 
  I know that in the past many laws were political in nature. 
I know that many Russian laws were adopted to suit specific 
political groups, to suit whichever faction was on top. Laws 
were adopted for the benefit of specific individuals or to spite 
specific individuals. This is the personification of laws. The 
worst thing that happens with legislation is when laws are 
passed for transient political purposes. I hope that this 
Treaty on Public Accord will give us, legislators, an 
opportunity to produce laws which are acceptable to our people, 
so that these laws really are geared to the development of our 
state. 
  We must all think first and foremost of our citizens. This 
Treaty will make it possible for legislators to become 
legislators in the true meaning of the word and to stop adopting 
laws amid political battles because we all have been elected by 
the people and whoever has been elected by the people, whatever 
political party, group, or public movement he belongs to, has 
been elected by the people and has the right to have his say by 
adopting a law while relying on his electorate. 
  So, the historic nature of this document has many aspects. 
Perhaps it is difficult for us to appreciate this today, at the 
moment of signing. Only after some time has passed will people 
understand what accord Russia has attained today. And I hope 
that, although signed only for a period of two years, it will 
become the basis of accord in the Russian Federation in general, 
an accord to bring together our citizens, and to urge us toward 
integration and maximum possible rapprochement of what is today 
called the Commonwealth of Independent States. 
  I would like to say again that I hope this document will 
become an historic one. Thank you.

<F P=106> [Article by Sergey Filatov, Russian presidential </F>
administration chief: "Who Is Unhappy with Civic Peace"] 
  [Text] It would seem that the idea of national 
conciliation should be welcomed by all. It has been welcomed, 
in a word. As soon as negotiations began on a possible 
agreement, however, it emerged that representatives of various 
political forces will find it rather difficult to come to terms 
on this score. To be sure, immediately voices began to be 
heard: "What is the point of launching this burdensome 
undertaking in the first place?" Indeed, is it impossible to 
pursue reform without a civic accord agreement? Of course, it is 
not. Yet is it necessary to prove how much more difficult this 
will be in the conditions of confrontation and political 
hysteria and without a mechanism for coordinating social 
interests? 
  In my opinion, we have had our share of such difficulties 
and 
can now sum up the results. The reforms have been moving not 
dynamically and consistently enough primarily owing to political 
instability. Hence the forced deviations from reform in the 
sphere of economics, the wary attitude by Western investors, the 
inefficiency of some power institutions, and many other things. 
It is specially dangerous that not only politicians have found 
themselves on different sides of the barricades, but that 
society itself has begun to divide into conflicting camps. Do 
we have the right to pass up the opportunity to pacify society 
and provide it peaceful living conditions? 
  This chance, I am sure, exists today. Parliamentary 
elections have been held; there are two years to go before 
presidential elections; a new constitution has been adopted and 
put into effect; the Federal Assembly is beginning to function 
in a steady rhythm.... 
  Yet all of this, alas, against the backdrop of an economic 
and social crisis. But if we unleash a war of public rallies 
and provoke a wave of strikes, will bread become cheaper or will 
pensioners enjoy better living standards? 
  Yes, the process of preparing and signing the accord -- and 
this is precisely a process -- will not be easy. Its 
implementation will be still more difficult. Yet the way work 
on the document has been proceeding in the past few days shows 
that the efforts by all the sides concerned are not in vain. 
  It will be recalled that the first version of the accord, 
prepared by a working group, aroused serious objections in the 
course of discussion in the Public Chamber. Some thought that 
the document should describe in detail which principles should 
underlie economic policy and specifically how reform will 
develop. No question: It would be good to agree on this.... 
Yet, after all, our task is to ensure the broadest possible 
circle of parties to the agreement, attracting sensible 
political figures of all orientations. This is why the 
conciliation pact is of a fairly general character. 
  Yet even the most general formulas did not come about 
easily. 
Some thought the accord was too rigid; others, on the contrary, 
considered it too vague.... Yes, this has been a process of 
mutual concessions and search for conciliatory formulas and 
compromise; and how can it possibly be otherwise? 
  Here is just one example. The original version envisioned 
sanctions in the event of a violation of the accord's provisions 
by one of the sides. In particular, the Conciliation Commission 
was to be granted the right to initiate the question of 
excluding the corresponding participant from among the 
signatories or to move proposals on measures of political 
responsibility, including the dismissal of "transgressors" from 
leading positions and stripping them of deputy status. Later on 
we abandoned such a rigid approach, and this immediately allowed 
the range of the agreement's supporters to be broadened. 
  Nonetheless, even today the document contains several 
provisions which are evoking sharp disagreement by a number of 
opposition movements. This is primarily the point obligating 
all sides to refrain from demands to introduce such amendments 
into the Constitution which could destabilize the situation in 
society. Or the obligation not to initiate political campaigns 
with the aim of holding early elections to federal power bodies. 
But here, in my opinion, lies the line which cannot be passed 
in the search for compromise. If we renounce these provisions, 
the document -- even if signed by all the participants in the 
political process without exception -- will be nothing more than 
a mere declaration. 
  Is there a danger that not all opposition parties will sign 
the agreement of public accord? To be sure, there is. But I 
would not regard this prospect as tragic. There is one 
circumstance which, in my view, should compel all sensible 
politicians sooner or later to put their signatures under this 
document. Possibly, with their remarks and qualifications (it 
will be recalled that the agreement is open to accession at any 
time). It is hardly likely that the president's most principled 
opponents will want to stay aside from the process of 
reconciling social interests and elaborating a coordinated 
policy. And in this sense the agreement will be just a starting 
point. It will set in motion a mechanism that will be in 
operation for the next two years: conferences, "roundtables," 
and temporary working groups with representatives of parties to 
the agreement. 
  As for those who will not want to conduct a peaceful 
dialogue.... Well, society must know the names of these leaders 
and the parties they represent. I think that this will also be 
useful: It should not be forgotten that not so much time is 
left before the next presidential elections.

  [Text] Moscow, April 27 (TASS) -- Member of the Russian 
Parliament lower house Andrey Ayzderdzis was shot and killed 
from a shotgun near his house in Moscow's satellite city of 
Khimki on Tuesday evening. 
  ITAR-TASS learnt from Igor Negrustuyev, public relations 
officer of the Russian chief criminal investigation department, 
that the shotgun was found at a house basement during the 
investigation. Ayzderdzis died of a gun wound in the right part 
of the thorax. 
  The police dog brought investigators to a nearby parking 
lot. 
Eye-witnesses are being questioned. Investigation develops five 
versions. 
  Aydzerdzis, b. 1958, was member of the "New Regional Policy" 
parliamentary faction. He was board chairman of the MDK-Bank 
(authorised capital 240 million roubles) and board chairman of 
the International Business Corporation before December 1993. 
  However, following the election to parliament, he left the 
former posts. The Moscow press printed reports on the 
controversial nature of Ayzderdzis's business activities.

  [Text] During his talks with the leadership of Kazakhstan 
the Premier of the Chinese State Council Li Peng thanked 
President Nursultan Nazarbayev for a balanced and realistic 
approach to all aspects of bilateral relations. This was 
disclosed at a Tuesday briefing in Alma-Ata [Almaty] by a 
spokesman for the Chinese Foreign Ministry. 
  He said Nazarbayev is not letting Eastern Turkestan, an 
organization of separatists from several Central Asian countries 
claiming territories in North China, to engage in subversive 
activities against China from Kazakhstan. The Kazakh leader 
also views Taiwan as an inseparable part of China. 
  The spokesman said that the calls made at a Tuesday rally in 
Alma-Ata organized by the Nevada-Semipalatinsk movement and 
Eastern Turkestan to stop nuclear tests at Lobnor test ground 
are senseless because no nuclear tests are conducted there. 
  The official said Li Peng invited Nazarbayev to visit China 
at a time suitable for him for the final settlement of remaining 
border problems.

<F P=106> [Report by ITAR-TASS diplomatic correspondent] </F>
  [Text] Almaty, 26 Apr -- The six principles on which China 
intends to build its economic relations with the states of 
Central Asia were set out today by Li Peng, prime minister of 
the PRC State Council, as he addressed representatives of 
Kazakhstan's business circles while on an official visit here. 
  In the opinion of the Chinese side, cooperation must be 
based 
on the principles of equality and mutual benefit and should be 
practiced in accordance with economic laws. Partners must heed 
each other's needs, abide by the principle of equivalent 
exchanges, maintain a balance of trade and regulate it, if 
necessary. The creation of joint ventures must be in the 
interests of the participants and aim to develop the economies 
of the participating countries. 
  Second, the forms of cooperation must be diversified. At 
present, the exchange of goods forms the greater part of all 
economic exchanges. In Beijing's view, proper trade must be the 
main tendency in this sphere. To this end, it is necessary to 
improve the conditions for the performance of banking 
operations. The Chinese Government fully shares the Central 
Asian states' desire to develop relations with various areas in 
the PRC, supplementing their links with the neighboring Xinjiang 
Uygur autonomous region. 
  Third, economic cooperation must originate from the specific 
conditions and muster all the local resources. Full account 
must be taken of the market development prospects from the 
outset of the creation of joint ventures, which must provide a 
good economic return and produce competitive output. 
  Fourth, as a new "Silk Road" is built, transport and 
communications must inevitably be improved. The prime minister 
of the PRC State Council pointed out, in this connection, the 
importance of the agreement concluded in this field during the 
current visit. In Li Peng's view, China and Kazakhstan must 
make every effort to ensure the vigorous functioning of this 
transport "bridge" between Europe and Asia. 
  Fifth, the small amount of economic aid that we have been 
able to give the states of Central Asia, the premier stressed, 
is only a symbol for the PRC people's friendly feelings toward 
their neighbors. China is itself a developing country at the 
moment and is trying to improve its economy. 
  Sixth, China intends to promote multilateral cooperation so 
that everyone may develop. The PRC is conducting an "open door" 
policy toward the developing, as well as the developed, 
countries, and particularly toward neighboring countries, Li 
Peng observed. As it develops its links with the states of 
Central Asia, China would like to see a growth in their trade, 
the strengthening of economic ties and friendly contacts with 
other countries. We are ready for honest and equal competition, 
the Chinese leader said. 
  As he concluded his speech, Li Peng emphasized that China 
did 
not see Central Asia as a target for the expansion of its sphere 
of political and economic influence.

<F P=106> [Report by KAZTAG correspondent Ivan Zakharchenko] </F>
  [Text] Almaty, 27 April (TASS) -- During a meeting with Li 
Peng, premier of China's Council of State, here on Wednesday 
morning, Prime Minister Sergey Tereshchenko of Kazakhstan 
inquired about potentialities for China's participation in a 
broadening of trade with Kazakhstan, in a joint modernisation of 
the Karaganda metallurgical complex, in the establishment of 
transit motor transportation routes across the Republic and 
shipping along the border rivers Irtysh and Ili, and a realistic 
time-frame for the establishment of a free economic area near 
the border township of Khorgos. 
  Li said it is possible to enlarge the network of Chinese 
shops in Kazakhstan and joint trading ventures only provided the 
two countries make profit. He also emphasised that the quality 
of commodities which are supplied directly by state producers 
will be much higher and cheaper than that of those being 
delivered by profiteers from China. 
  As far as China's possible participation in the 
modernisation 
of the Karaganda metallurgical mill is concerned, the Chinese 
premier said it is essential at first to carry out an expert 
examination to determine the economic efficiency of the mill and 
gauge the competitive power of its products. 
  Speaking about transit transportation from Kazakhstan to 
Pakistan, which is being effected via Turkey and Iran, Li 
admitted that routes across China would reduce transportation 
distance by half. He expressed understanding of this aspect and 
suggested that the respective ministries of the two countries 
examine the matter. 
  Li took up a similar attitude as regards shipping along the 
Irtysh and Ili Rivers and the Khorgos Free Economic Area and its 
status. 
  The premiers of Kazakhstan and China expressed satisfaction 
with this exchange of views.

  [Text] Alma-Ata [Almaty] 27 April TASS -- Premier of the 
Chinese State Council Li peng said at a news conference in 
Alma-Ata devoted to the results of his visit to Turkmenistan, 
Uzbekistan, Kyrgyzstan and Kazakhstan that his talks with 
leaders of these countries were successful and contributed to 
further strengthening of friendship, mutual understanding and 
the expansion of economic, political and cultural ties. 
  The Chinese premier pointed out that China accounts for the 
smallest number of weapons of mass destruction possessed by 
nuclear states. The existence of such weapons has a purely 
defensive character and China pledged not to be the first to use 
such weapons, the Chinese premier said, reminding of basic 
principles of the Chinese military and political doctrine. 
  The Chinese premier pointed out, in particular, that a 
document on the inviolability of existing frontiers was signed 
between China and Kazakhstan for the first time. China expects 
to sign a similar document soon with Kyrgyzstan, Li Peng said. 
  Touching upon Russo-Chinese relations, Li Peng described 
them 
as "useful and fruitful." 
  Late on Wednesday the Chinese premier had a one-to-one 
meeting with Kazakh President Nursultan Nazarbayev. 
  On Thursday morning the Chinese premier and his entourage 
will leave Alma-Ata.

  The Chinese leader said his country was now taking an active

Russia, the United States, Great Britain and France, which are 
also parties to these talks, have suspended nuclear tests. 
  The latest regular nuclear test was performed in China last 
October, after which a rise in background radiation was 
registered in Kazakh areas bordering on China.

  [Text] An agreement on the Kazakh-Chinese border, 
stretching 1700 kilometers, is the main result of the 
Kazakh-Chinese talks, Kazakh President Nursultan Nazarbayev told 
a press conference on Tuesday. 
  He said that none of the former Soviet republics bordering 
on 
China had concluded such an agreement. He also believes that 
this document reflects Kazakhstan's and China's determination to 
maintain stable, friendly relations. 
  Nazarbayev pointed out that the positions of the two states' 
leaders on the political situation in Asia were the same. 
  Both parties stated that the agreement between the Kazakh 
Transportation Ministry and the Chinese Railways Ministry lifted 
all limitations from the transit of cargo and passengers between 
China and Kazakhstan. 
  Nazarbayev announced that the agreement on the extension of 
a 
50 million yuan credit will be used to broaden bilateral and 
invigorate border trade, to reconstruct the Karaganda steel mill 
and build enterprises putting out consumer goods.

<F P=106> [Report by Tleuzhan Yesilbayev: "Kazakhstan Without Meat or </F>
Butter"] 
  [Text] Alma-Ata [Almaty] -- Painful figures were cited at a 
routine sitting of the Kazakhstani Cabinet of Ministers a few 
days ago. 
  For instance, as of 1 April, 1,084 enterprises were either 
completely or partially standing idle in Kazakhstan. 
Electricity generation had fallen by 14 percent, and coal 
extraction by 10 percent. The extraction of oil, gas 
condensate, and gas had fallen. In the first three months of 
this year, the fall in production in the Republic's food 
industry alone was 33 percent. As a result the production of 
butter, milk, cheese, canned food, whole milk and fish products, 
flour, groats, and pasta products decreased. The acceleration 
of inflationary processes has been reflected in the material 
position of the Kazakhstanis. During the past year, average 
monthly earnings increased by a factor of only 14.2, while 
consumer prices went up by a factor of 23. The price of 
consumer services jumped even higher -- by a factor of 24 -- but 
there was a record price hike in the housing sector -- by a 
factor of 62. And you now have to pay 37 times more for medical 
services than you did a year ago. 
  In a word, the crisis in the economy and the social sphere 
has affected all strata of the population. Many Kazakhstanis 
are pinning their hopes for a better future on the professional 
parliament, whose first session opened last week.

the Republic of Kazakhstan, Considers New Forms of Deepening the 
Integration of the Post-Soviet Republics"] 
  [Text] The idea of creating a Eurasian Union consisting of 
the CIS member countries belongs to Nursultan Nazarbayev, 
president of Kazakhstan. When putting this idea forward at a 
meeting with professors and students of the Moscow State 
University, Nursultan Abishevich was being consistent. Several 
times previously he had put the proposal to strengthen 
cooperation among the former Union republics to his colleagues 
in the Commonwealth. He received the Treaty on Economic Union 
with satisfaction and supported the Collective Security Treaty. 
Now there is this new initiative. 
  "It is hard to call the present CIS a Commonwealth," 
Kazakhstani Ambassador Tair Mansurov said, explaining his 
president's proposal. "In the three years of its existence over 
400 joint documents have been adopted, but more than half of 
them have not been ratified by the national parliaments and 
those which have been ratified are not operating. In addition, 
some members of the CIS are in a state of open war and many are 
waging economic battles against one another. In these 
conditions it is hard to talk about the mutual aid and support, 
characteristic of a really integrated association..." 
  My interlocutor was a builder by trade, a politician by 
necessity. For more than 10 years he built homes and industrial 
facilities, worked for the party, was elected to Kazakhstan's 
Supreme Soviet, and represented his people in the USSR 
parliament's Soviet of the Republics. At the same time he 
directed the "Kazakhstan" development fund, which performs 
educational and cultural functions. In January 1994 he accepted 
N. Nazarbayev's proposal to head the embassy in Moscow. He 
recently presented his credentials to President Yeltsin. He is 
a convinced supporter of political and economic union with 
Russia. He took part in the top-level talks during the 
Kazakhstani President's first official visit to Russia recently. 
He is proud of the fact that he has contributed to the 
elaboration of 23 draft interstate agreements signed at the 
level of presidents and heads of government, including the 
treaties on Baykonur and the simplification of the procedure for 
obtaining citizenship when residents move from Russia to 
Kazakhstan or vice versa. 
  "Nursultan Abishevich's new initiative -- on the Eurasian 
Union -- is on the same plane," Tair Mansurov explained. "The 
president's idea is that now, in conditions of the independence 
and equal rights of the republics, it is possible to create a 
completely new interstate association capable of overcoming the 
shortcomings of the present CIS...." 
  Tair Mansurov said that President Nazarbayev sees three main 
corner stones at the basis of the Eurasian Union: 
  -- Common supranational organs for the coordination 
(management) of the economy, defense, and foreign policy; 
  -- A single economic area; and 
  -- A common defense complex. 
  The supranational institutions include councils of the heads 
of state and the heads of government, the parliament, councils 
of defense ministers and foreign ministers, and the interstate 
executive committee -- a standing organ whose leader is 
appointed by the heads of state for a term specified by them. 
As for the single economic area, it can be built, for example, 
on such foundations as the coordination of economic policy and 
the adoption of obligatory joint programs, a common legislative 
base to regulate relations among the economic components, a 
supranational currency along the lines of the European ECU, the 
coordination of direct ties between enterprises, the creation of 
mixed and joint industrial-financial and transport firms, 
trading houses, and commodity exchanges. The defense and 
foreign policy complexes can be equally effective. Through its 
executive committee the Eurasian Union should receive the status 
of a fully-fledged representative in all the leading interstate 
organizations. 
  "It goes without saying that innovation is always greeted 
with caution," the ambassador said. "So it was that the 
reaction to the Eurasian Union was mixed too. It is a pity that 
Nursultan Abishevich was sick and unable to share his ideas with 
the participants in the Moscow summit. But we know that many 
projects that seemed unfeasible have in time been put into 
practice. I believe that the same fate is in store for the 
President of Kazakhstan's initiative.

  [Text] Tallinn, Apr 26, BNS -- Prime Minister Mart Laar 
today told reporters that recent speculations in the press about 
his forthcoming resignation are premature and groundless. 
  "I don't think it likely that I'll step down from the post 
of 
prime minister, despite claims to the contrary in the press," 
Laar stated. 
  Several Estonian politicians maintain that, since the last 
vote of no confidence three months ago, the correlation of 
forces in the parliament has changed and the parliament may 
force Laar to resign. 
  "When President Lennart Meri congratulated me on my birthday 
(April 22; Laar was on a visit to the United States last week), 
he said there have been writings about my resignation in the 
Estonian press he can't understand," Laar said. "Perhaps 
reporters have more information than I myself do." 
  The premier also voiced the opinion that the press have 
reached a stage when they've "run out of subjects to write about 
and therefore engage in speculation." 
  "I know that Tiit Vahi (chairman of the Tallinn City Council 
and the Assembly Party, as well as former prime minister) 
hankers after the post of premier, he has openly admitted it," 
Laar noted. "It's another thing how many members of the 
parliament want to see him fill that post." 
  The prime minister also said rumors about rifts in the 
government are "exaggerated." 
  "The coalition is doing good teamwork and even defections 
are 
not likely to rock the boat," Laar declared.

  [Text] Tallinn, Apr 27, BNS -- Dvigatel and Baltiyets, two 
former Soviet armaments factories, are to be entered on the list 
of Estonian enterprises that will be privatized with the help of 
the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development [EBRD], 
Vaino Sarnet, the director of the Estonian Privatization Agency, 
told reporters today. 
  Sarnet hoped the factories would finally be sold with help 
from Europe, but he couldn't say what they would be producing in 
the future. 
  The Privatization Agency director said EBRD plans to help 
Estonia sell several enterprises into private hands. "The bank 
will restructure the enterprises that are to be privatized, 
change their management and find investors," Sarnet said. "The 
enterprises will then be privatized in the usual way." 
  The head of the Privatization Agency did not rule out that 
EBRD may take part in the Estonian privatization process also 
financially. He said the bank may either buy part of the shares 
in the companies that are to be sold into private hands to whet 
investors' appetite, or it may even extend credit to them. 
  Sarnet said EBRD has already earmarked a little over one 
million ECU for privatization consultations, as well as 10 
million ECU for buying shares or giving loans to privatized 
enterprises. He expressed hope that the bank will increase 
those sums.

<F P=106> [Report by ITAR-TASS correspondent Vadim Byrkin] </F>
  [Text] Moscow 26 April TASS -- President Yuriy Meshkov of 
the Republic of the Crimea, Admiral Eduard Baltin, commander of 
the Black Sea Fleet, and Viktor Semyonov, chairman of the 
Sevastopol City Council of People's Deputies have issued a joint 
statement urging the presidents of Russia and Ukraine to resume 
the interrupted Russo-Ukrainian talks on the Black Sea Fleet and 
"to act as the guarantors of peace in the Republic of the 
Crimea," a spokesman at the fleet press centre told ITAR-TASS by 
telephone. 
  The authors of the statement expressed utter regret and 
concern over the frustration of the Russo-Ukrainian talks on 
dividing the fleet. They believe that the "struggle for 
political power and the presidency of Ukraine becomes a factor 
which can turn the process of negotiations on the problems of 
the Black Sea Fleet into a military conflict." 
  Attempts are being made to lay the blame for a possible 
break-up of Ukraine's statehood on the Republic of the Crimea 
and severely punish it for that. It is no problem by means of 
provocations to bring about an unstable situation in the 
republic and, making use of that, introduce a state-of-emergency 
regime, putting Russia-Ukraine relations on the brink of war, 
the authors of the statement maintain.

<F P=106> [ITAR-TASS report: "Totskiy Training Ground"] </F>
  [Text] Vyacheslav Kostikov, the Russian Federation 
president's press secretary, has unexpectedly announced that 
President B.N. Yeltsin understands the doubts expressed in the 
State Duma regarding the advisability of holding joint 
Russian-U.S. command and staff exercises at the Totskiy training 
ground in Orenburg Oblast. Having studied a pertinent 
submission from members of the State Duma, the opinions of 
deputies and military experts, and the assessments of the 
opposition, the president has instructed the Ministry of Defense 
to hold additional consultations with the U.S. side regarding 
this issue and to reconsider the matter with due regard for both 
the stance of the Russian lawmakers and comments made in this 
connection by the general public. 
  But meanwhile.... 
<H5>  Pentagon Pressure </H5>
  U.S. Secretary of Defense William Perry has called Russian 
Defense Minister Pavel Grachev and urged him to make efforts to 
ensure that the joint Russian-U.S. command and staff exercises 
planned earlier by Moscow and Washington go ahead in Orenburg 
Oblast This was announced by U.S. Department of Defense 
spokesman Kathleen de Laski, commenting on a report from the 
Russian president's press service passed to the Pentagon by 
ITAR-TASS's Washington desk regarding the possible cancellation 
of the joint exercises. 
  The Russian defense minister noted the concern expressed by 
W. Perry regarding the exercises and promised to relay this 
concern to the government, deLaski said. As far as we know, the 
Russian Government has not yet made a final decision on the 
exercises, which are slated for July this year. In the opinion 
of the U.S. Government, these exercises will represent a very 
good start to broadening contacts between the two states' armed 
forces. We naturally hope that the plans to hold them will 
materialize. 
  The cancellation of the joint Russian-U.S. military 
exercises 
at the Totskiy training ground near Orenburg "would be a blow to 
U.S. efforts to develop cooperation with Russia," THE WASHINGTON 
POST writes. 
  According to Pentagon spokesman David [as published] Boxx, 
U.S. Secretary of Defense William Perry regards the joint 
exercises as "an important symbolic first step toward 
cooperation between the military departments of Russia and the 
United States." 
  Citing a high-level representative of the U.S. Defense 
Department, the newspaper indicates that "the issue of holding 
the joint exercises, and also Russia's participation in the 
Partnership for Peace program, will be discussed next week 
during a visit to Moscow by a high-level delegation of Pentagon 
representatives who are traveling to Russia for planned 
consultations with the Russian side on a wide range of problems 
associated with ensuring security."

  [Text] Vilnius, Apr 28, BNS -- Lithuanian Foreign Minister 
Povilas Gylys on Tuesday [26 April] signed an agreement between 
Lithuania and the United States on trade relations and 
protection of intellectual property. The accord confers the 
most favored nation trade status to both countries. 
  In Washington, the Lithuanian minister met Nichol Burns, 
senior director of the National Security Council, and Peter 
Tarnoff, state under secretary for political affairs, the Voice 
of America [VOA] said. 
  In an interview with VOA, Gylys said the meetings concerned 
a 
number of issues, including cooperation in the Baltic Sea 
region, Lithuania's relations with Poland, Belarus and Russia. 
The minister said relations between Lithuania and the United 
States and possibilities to expand them were under discussion, 
as well. 
  Jonas Paslauskas, adviser to the Lithuanian Embassy in 
Washington, said special attention was paid to Lithuania's 
relations with its neighbors. Paslauskas said of possible 
development that could damage Lithuania's intersts were 
discussed. In his words, Gylys emphasized that Lithuania is 
very concerned about certain processes in the East. 
  According to the report, Tarnoff expressed satisfaction that 
relations between Lithuania and the United States are good and 
businesslike. 
  High-ranking U.S. officials also made specific proposals 
regarding U.S. assistance in the creation of a Baltic 
peacekeeping battalion, but no details were reported.

  [Text] Vilnius, Apr 28, BNS - The Lithuanian-Polish 
agreement on friendship and cooperation that was signed in 
Vilnius April 26 caused controversial reaction among Lithuanian 
politicians, although they all agree that the signing is a 
positive step toward expanding relations between the two 
countries. 
  The parliament's Foreign Affairs Committee on Wednesday [27 
April] postponed discussion of the treaty. The committee's 
chairman, Kazys Bobelis, told reporters that committee members 
decided to get acquainted with agreement's text in Polish. 
  Arvydas Bajoras, a member of the ruling Lithuanian 
Democratic Labor Party, said he sees no negative aspects in the 
accord. MP [member of parliament] Algirdas Kuncinas, vice 
chairman of the ruling LDLP faction in the parliament, said the 
agreement lacks a number of things, and shortcomings will come 
to light in the future. 
  Social democrat Nikolai Medvedev told the RESPUBLIKA 
newspaper that he is fully satisfied with the treaty because it 
guarantees Lithuania's territorial integrity and the 
inviolability of its borders. 
  Conservative Gediminas Vagnorius said he misses an 
evaluation 
of recent history (1920 occupation of Vilnius), which would 
eliminate possibilities for speculations. 
  Centrist Romualdas Ozolas, who sharply criticized the treaty 
while it was still in preparation, said the agreement means "a 
strategic defeat and a tactical victory." In his view, the 
parliament should adopt a statement on certain aspects that were 
left out along with the agreement's ratification. 
  Saulius Peceliunas, leader of the Democratic Party, said he 
will vote for the treaty's ratification if the parliament adopts 
a statement saying that a different interpretation of history is 
not a pretext for Polish social organizations to claim the 
property that they owned in the occupied Vilnius and its region.

  [Text] Today in Jurmala, groups of experts of the Latvian- 
Russian interstate talks completed the coordination of an 
additional protocol to the agreement on social guarantees for 
the discharged Russian military that was submitted by Latvia. 
With this, there are no obstacles now to the delegations 
signing the package of documents on the withdrawal of the 
Russian Army, Sergey Zotov, head of the Russian delegation, 
believes. 
  Aivars Vovers, deputy head of the Latvian delegation, also 
admitted that there are no obstacles now for a meeting between 
the Latvian and Russian presidents, from the point of view of 
the readiness of the agreements. The protocol provides for 
several ways to tackle the issues related to emigration to 
Russia or other states by the Russian officers discharged in 
Latvia, if they wish to do so. 
  It is envisaged to tackle the issue of the amount of payment 
for rent of the Skrunda radar station at the presidents' 
meeting.

  [Text] Riga, Apr 28, BNS -- The United States has allotted 
160 million dollars to build homes for Russian officers 
repatriating from the Baltic states and Eastern Europe, said 
representatives of the U.S. State Department and the U.S. 
International Development Agency [USAID]. 
  The group toured Riga this week to acquaint Latvians with 
the 
implementation of two housing programs for Russian military. 
  The first experimental apartments will be ready next week in 
the Novgorod and Pskov regions of Russia, said George Deikun, a 
spokesman for the USAID. All 350 flats in this program will be 
completed in the near months, he noted. 
  To accommodate 450 officers, 100 vouchers will be issued to 
enable the officers to acquire apartments in Russia in 90 days. 
From the 450 apartments, 80 percent are designed for those 
withdrawing from the Baltic region. 
  The second project foresees to build 4,000 apartments and 
distribute 1,000 vouchers. The general contractor for the 
implementation of this project will be found until July. 
  Under a U.S.-Russian agreement, the construction is carried 
out by American or Russian privately-run firms, or U.S.-Russian 
joint ventures, said Deikun. 
  Unfortunately, Deikun said, the homes are and will be built 
in compliance with Russian and not with American standards. The 
apartments, however, will become private property of the 
officers. 
  The U.S. delegation also met Wednesday [27 April] with 
representatives of Russian Northwestern Army Group command to 
discuss the implementation of the projects. 
  The officers basically want to return to their native 
districts or places where it is easy to find jobs. USAID drafts 
the list of officers who need accommodation together with the 
Russian Interministerial Housing Committee, Russian local 
governments and army command. 
  U.S. Ambassador to Latvia Ints Silins reconfirmed the 
intention of the United States to donate 2 million dollars to 
help Latvia dismantle the new block of the Skrunda radar 
facility. 
  BNS asked Silins whether the United States will participate 
in the financing of the Russian military retirees' repatriation 
foundation, which will also deal with the rehabilitation of the 
Skrunda environment. Silins answered he lacked information 
about the goals of the foundation and, consequently, abstained 
from comments.

  [Text] Moscow, Apr 27, BNS -- A group of Latvian experts, 
headed by Foreign Ministry State Secretary Maris Riekstins, met 
with Russian counterparts on Wednesday [27 April] to discuss the 
date of the anticipated visit of Latvian President Guntis 
Ulmanis to Moscow. 
  The date of the presidential summit could be announced on 
Thursday, a spokesperson for the Latvian Embassy in Moscow told 
BNS. 
  The embassy official named April 30 as a potential date for 
the summit but he said that it was not for sure. 
  Currently, Latvian and Russian negotiators are coordinating 
a 
supplementary protocol to the agreement on social rights of 
Russian military retirees, said the spokesman. "There is a hope 
that the protocol will be approved as an annex to the 
agreement," he said. 
  The protocol, which Latvians submitted to the Russian 
delegation this week in Jurmala, Latvia, foresees an option for 
demobilized servicemen to repatriate and a chance for Russia to 
participate in the setup of a repatriation foundation. 
  During the trip of Ulmanis to Moscow, he and Russian 
President Boris Yeltsin are expected to sign the package of 
agreements on Russian troop withdrawal, including sections on 
Aug. 31 as withdrawal deadline; on temporary operation of radar 
facility at Skrunda in Latvia; on protection of withdrawing 
troops; and on social rights of retired servicemen. 
  Latvia wants to amend the section on war pensioners, while 
Russia insists on the signature of the whole package together.

  [Text] The issue of the possibility for the Latvian and 
Russian presidents to meet will, to a great extent, be decided 
at the meeting of experts of the Latvian-Russian interstate 
talks in Jurmala, Aivars Vovers, the deputy head of the Latvian 
delegation, told reporters today during the talks between the 
experts. Vovers explained that during the experts' talks the 
main attention was paid to an additional protocol to the 
agreement on the discharged Russian military personnel 
initialled on 15 March, the draft of which Latvia submitted on 
Tuesday [26 April]. 
  The draft protocol provides for the possibility of 
repatriation of the discharged Russian military personnel who 
wish to return to Russia, as well as setting up a repatriation 
fund. The Russian experts have agreed to the idea of such a 
fund. However, the standpoints of the two sides are 
controversial on many points of the additional protocol, Vovers 
said. 
  The Russian side has submitted a list of approximately 150 
military who were discharged by 28 January 1992 but have not 
carried out all the corresponding formalities until now as a 
supplement to the above-mentioned agreement. 
  According to the initialled agreement, in the event of 
signing the list [as heard] these people will have the right to 
remain in Latvia, Vovers explained. He added that to tackle 
repatriation problems the Latvian side would need the list of 
all the discharged Russian military living in Latvia. 
  Sergey Zotov, the head of the Russian delegation, who today 
discussed these problems with Latvian Prime Minister Valdis 
Birkavs, for his part expressed the view that the talks were 
very difficult because the Latvian side shows excessive 
stubbornness and does not wish to unilaterally give in on 
several issues.

<F P=106> [Interview with Maris Grinblats, leader of the Fatherland </F>
and Freedom faction in the Latvian Saeima, by V. Mikhaylov; 
place and date not given: "Are the Elders Leaning More to the 
Right?" -- first paragraph is STRAZH BALTIKI introduction] 
  [Text] After Maris Grinblats was elected a deputy to the 
Saeima [parliament], his powers as chairman of the Latvian 
Congress of Citizens were suspended. However, the leader of the 
now parliamentary opposition has not been left without work, of 
course. Today, he is not only the leader of the radical 
right-wing Fatherland and Freedom faction, but also head of the 
"Union of 18 November." This party, as known, is a leading 
force on the path toward the unification of Latvia's nationalist 
forces. Thus, there is every reason to call this philosopher 
from Madona a leader of the entire national radical wing of the 
Latvian Republic. Excluding, of course, the Movement for 
National Independence of Latvia [LNNK]. By the way, our 
interview began with a question about the differences between 
the LNNK faction and Fatherland and Freedom. After all, it is 
beyond the comprehension of mere mortals. 
  [Grinblats] There are certain differences. For instance, 
there were two different draft laws on citizenship. The LNNK 
wanted to begin naturalization before the withdrawal of 
occupation troops, whereas we opposed such an approach. True, 
by now, after two months of mutual discussions, we have arrived 
at a single compromise draft. 
  [Mikhaylov] How is it so that the positions are similar, but 
the numbers of seats in the legislature are so different? 
  [Grinblats] The LNNK is more familiar to the people, while 
our union was created only a year ago, literally on the eve of 
legislative elections. Thus, the results of the elections were 
not surprising. 
  [Mikhaylov] You are in opposition to the governing 
coalition. Does this mean that all your ideas are being swept 
aside by "wayfarers" and "peasants?" 
  [Grinblats] No, some of our ideas regarding the restoration 
of laws adopted in the Latvian Republic in the 1920's and 1930's 
are being accepted by Saeima. These are the laws on state 
control and a referendum, both of which are being adopted 
according to our conception. With regard to laws on land reform 
and denationalization of housing, we have managed to make only 
certain alterations here. The psychology of the ruling 
coalition is as follows: The process has been activated, and no 
special changes are needed. 
  [Mikhaylov] You have your own draft law on foreigners and 
stateless people. The draft divides these people into four 
groups. What are they? 
  [Grinblats] In the first place, the question concerns people 
who are not allowed residence permits. These are people who 
entered Latvia illegally, even from the point of view of Soviet 
laws, and are not registered. They include criminal elements 
and servicemen from the Russian Army. The second group of 
people, who are allowed residence permits for one year, includes 
pensioned servicemen and their families. The third group 
includes the main bulk of civilians who have the right to reside 
in Latvia for five years. In addition, both the second and 
third categories can extend residence permits for one year and 
five years respectively, if they are not acting in any way 
against Latvia's independence. The fourth group, which has the 
right of permanent residence, includes all Latvians and 
Livonians who do not currently have Latvian citizenship; 
foreigners and their families, who came to Latvia before 1940 
and have residence permits dating from that time; spouses of 
Latvian citizens who live in Latvia for a definite period of 
time; and, possibly, former citizens of Latvia and Estonia. 
  [Mikhaylov] What about the system of quotas? 
  [Grinblats] We think that such a system is necessary, 
regardless of what we might call it. Yet the extent of a quota 
should be determined not by the government, but by a legal norm. 
Within these quotas, naturalization can be applied only to 
Latvians who have yet not been granted Latvian citizenships for 
some other reason. 
  [Mikhaylov] How would you evaluate Latvia's participation in 
the "Partnership for Peace" program? 
  [Grinblats] It is a positive step. The West, as it is 
becoming clear by now, does not intend to interfere in our 
problems too much. They are not very interested in them. 
Latvia, in the end, is not oil-rich Kuwait. Thus, the 
"Partnership" is an option that could not be rejected. Though, 
I am more hopeful to strengthen the close ties in security 
matters with Lithuania and Estonia with the support of such 
countries as Denmark and Sweden. These countries are very 
concerned with the illegal transit of immigrants through Baltic 
states. It is a matter of vital interest for them whether our 
"sieve" has holes or not. 
  [Mikhaylov] One last question: If your version of the law 
on citizenship is not adopted and these 70,000 pensioned 
servicemen with their families stay in Latvia, what will you do? 
Will you accept the situation? 
  [Grinblats] We will seek another means to achieve our goal. 
  [Mikhaylov] Thank you for the interview.

  [Text] Tallinn, Apr 28, BNS -- The final version of the 
plan for Estonia's participation in the NATO Partnership for 
Peace program is expected to be ready in the middle of May, 
officials at the Estonian Foreign Ministry said. 
  Estonia by now has prepared in most part the text of the 
document it is going to propose from its side. Still to be 
agreed upon are the issues pertaining to the military resources 
to be given to NATO's disposal by Estonia. Work is going on 
over these issues at the defense forces Central Staff in Tallinn. 
  After all necessary amendments have been made in the 
Estonian 
text of the plan, the government will get a draft budget of the 
expenses connected with Estonia's participation in the program. 
If the government approves the budget, Estonia will submit its 
program to the NATO leadership for approval. 
  The Foreign Ministry says Estonia will be ready to take part 
in the program in the second half of this year. Cooperation 
under the Partnership for Peace program will follow the 16+1 
formula, i.e. 16 NATO members plus that particular non-member 
partner. But the program also provides for extensive bilateral 
cooperation between NATO members and the partner countries. 
  The cooperation project is being prepared in Estonia by a 
work group, led by the head of the Foreign Ministry's political 
department, Toivo Klaar. 
  Officials at the Foreign Ministry said Estonia has been 
working closely particularly with Denmark, but also with Germany 
and the United States while drawing up the program. Exchanging 
of information goes on steadily with Latvia and Lithuania, the 
ministry officials said. 
  Enn Tupp, the head of the defense policy department at the 
Estonian Defense Ministry, told reporters on Wednesday [27 
April] that the country above all is interested in the 
possibilities that the partnership program offers in the field 
of military training. "This is one of our main aims while 
participating in the program," Tupp said. 
  Estonia in the documents pays much attention to the 
strengthening of its coast defense. The country expects from 
the NATO members not only assistance in the form of consulting, 
but also "certain material support," Tupp said.

  [Text] Tallinn, Apr 28, BNS -- Higher import tariffs in 
Russia for certain Estonian-made goods will be effective from 
July 1, 1994, the Estonian Foreign Ministry press office quoted 
an official statement by the Russian Embassy as saying. 
  Tariffs as valid before March 15 this year will remain in 
effect until June 30. This means that exporters in Estonia who 
have already paid the Russian tax under the higher rates can get 
back their money or leave it as pre-payment for next 
consignments, the ministry adds in its remarks. 
  The Russian Government in a ruling from March 14 imposed 
higher tariffs on some articles of imports from Estonia. The 
new tariffs for farm products, confectionery and bakery 
products, textiles, were established at two times the rate used 
for imports from other European countries. 
  Russian Deputy Prime Minister Oleg Soskovets in an interview 
with the Interfax news agency earlier this month said Moscow is 
not going to revise the new tariffs in the near future.

  [Text] Moscow, Apr 28, BNS -- Russia was not guided by 
political motivation, but proceeded exclusively from economical 
reasoning when introducing the new import tariffs, to become 
effective from July 1, Russian Agriculture Minister Victor 
Khlystun told his Estonian counterpart at a meeting in Moscow. 
  Khlystun said Russia is trying to protect its domestic 
market 
against dumping and that the introduction of customs tariffs was 
a necessary precondition for Russia's membership in the GATT. 
  Russia's new higher tariffs will be effective as to Estonia 
because the Russian parliament has not ratified a trade 
agreement signed between the two countries. But the Baltics are 
not the only countries exports from which will be hit by the 
higher tariffs; the new regulations also affect Georgia, for 
instance, the Estonian minister quoted his Russian counterpart 
as saying. 
  Leetsar said the Russian minister had agreed to immediately 
start talks on reducing the import tariffs for products coming 
from the sector governed by the Agriculture Ministry. Talks 
could be started over raw products, such as meat, potatoes, 
cheese, etc. Leetsar said there was little interest toward 
Estonian-made butter in Russia, but added that Estonian cheese 
and pork continued to be much-wanted articles. 
  The talks of the Estonian minister with Russia's farm sector 
leaders, which focused on the new tariffs, also dealt with more 
general topics, such as financing of the farm sector, state 
subsidies, pricing. Discussed was the possibility to set up 
joint ventures and even possible joint participation in 
international corporations. 
  Russia proposed Estonia to take part as observer in the work 
of Russia's Federal Market Center. Leetsar in his comments in 
support of the idea said this would enable Estonia to be better 
informed about the developments on the Russian market. Estonia 
also wishes to participate in the creation of an international 
farm exchange in St. Petersburg, a town traditionally a major 
market for Estonian farm products. 
  Leetsar, in his further remarks on the visit, said a deep 
crisis in Russia's farm sector is continuing and that the 
country doesn't expect to get out of it even in the coming year. 
Debts of the farm sector are huge, and 14 percent of the 
collective and state-governed kolkhoz and sovkhoz enterprises 
have gone bankrupt. 
  The Estonian minister also invited his Russian counterpart 
to 
visit Estonia. Khlystun's visit is expected some time in the 
second half of May.

  [Text] Tallinn, Apr 28, BNS -- Estonian border authorities 
have provided to Russia materials to prove that the group of 
Kurds which arrived in Estonia on April 6 had come from Russia. 
The Russian side didn't accept the proof, claiming it was 
impossible to cross the border illegally from their side, since 
they are guarding the border 24 hours a day. 
  Three students from Afghanistan, currently studying in 
Moscow, on Wednesday [27 April] applied for an Estonian visa at 
the country's embassy in the Russian capital. The students said 
their parents were among the group of Kurds who came to Estonia 
illegally. 
  Estonia refused to issue visas to the Afghan students, 
saying 
it still insists that Russia would take back the Kurds who 
crossed the border illegally.

<F P=106> [Unattributed account of "undelivered speech" by Federation </F>
Council Deputy Petr Romanov under the "Talking About the Treaty 
Aloud and to Yourself" rubric: "Facing Up to Life" -- first 
paragraph is introduction] 
  [Text] As we have already reported, the Federation Council 
approved the Treaty on Social Accord without discussion and 
instructed Speaker V. Shumeyko to sign it. Deputy Petr Romanov, 
who voted against, sent his undelivered speech to the editorial 
office. 
  The problem of choice has always faced and will always face 
each and every one of us, and very often we have to choose 
between loyalty and honor. The ancients used to say: "Loyalty 
cannot prevail over honor." Unfortunately, we sometimes forget 
this piece of wisdom, as we have in the Federation Council. 
  I recall with shame our meeting with the prime minister. 
Instead of demanding from him an account of what had been done, 
of what the government intends to work on, and of the help it 
needs from us, we began vying with one another in expressions of 
loyal sentiment. First, we spent time deciding, with a most 
serious expression on our face, where best to seat our cherished 
guest, then, with utter inappropriateness, we burst out with 
applause in response to his proposal to abolish public holidays. 
As if this will solve the problem when the country is already 
working a three- or four-day week. You get the impression that 
many of us are more concerned about loyalty to the regime than 
the honor and dignity of the Federation Council and its 
accountability to the people and history. 
  And today, in the process of working on the agreement, you 
get the impression that we have been away from Russia for a 
couple of years and that now this treaty is for us the light at 
the end of the tunnel. But no, these are the lights of an 
oncoming locomotive, the driving force of which is supplied by 
the awakened working class and peasantry. In the last century a 
classic author uttered these remarkable words: Politics is the 
concentrated expression of economics. I think these words would 
sound more appropriate now if reversed: "Economics is the 
concentrated expression of politics." In other words, the 
economy we have is nothing but the fruit of the political 
actions of the current leadership of the country. It is now 
necessary to talk about and include on the agenda the following 
item: The political crisis of the regime and, as its 
consequences, the collapse of the economy, the collapse, that 
is, rather than a temporary stoppage of the economy. We should 
all appreciate that if the political conditions are not changed, 
no changes will be achieved in the economy. Therefore we must 
not sign the treaty because: 
  first, it brings political stability to the president and 
government, guarantees of loyalty to them and security, and 
trust in the authorities; 
  second, the treaty does not bring economic stability to 
Russian producers, the regions, and Russia; 
  third, the president and the executive branch avoid giving 
any guarantees on their own part. 
  Such guarantees could be: 
  a) the swearing of an oath of allegiance to the new 
Constitution by the president; 
  b) a clear and unambiguous rejection of any attempts 
whatsoever to violate the Constitution by the president and 
government; 
  c) the consideration by the Federal Assembly and possibly by 
referendum of the basic principles of the reforms under way with 
the aim of fashioning a course which would be supported by the 
overwhelming majority of the population. I would very much like 
the work of the First Russian Federal Assembly to be remembered 
by the people in the same way as the reforms of Petr Arkadyevich 
Stolypin or the results of the postwar restoration of the 
national economy. 
  I conclude this speech with the words with which I began it: 
Loyalty to the regime cannot prevail over honor, especially when 
it is the honor of the Russian parliament.

<F P=106> ["Abridged Statement" by State Duma Deputy Vladimir Ivanov </F>
under the "Talking About the Treaty Aloud and to Yourself" 
rubric: "They Have Overcome the Country" -- last paragraph is 
conclusion] 
  [Text] There are cases like ours in world history, where a 
moratorium on political forces has brought the country a respite 
by channeling the energy of the masses away from conflict to 
constructive cooperation. 
  This is where the similarity ends. Today who in our country, 
destroyed as it has been by "perestroykas" and tormented by 
"reform," can guarantee that a political diet will create the 
climate of unity which, in the opinion of the people who have 
drawn up the "treaty," is all that the country lacks to complete 
"reforms"? The word "overcome" predominates in the terminology 
used by the "great Yeltsin." Semantics reflects his approach: 
Now that everything has been overcome in the country and a 
total -- economic, ideological, and political -- deadlock has 
been reached, the team of "reformers" are asking for a respite. 
It is hard to destroy things even in such a huge country as 
ours. Moreover, once again they are doing things their way, 
twisting the arm of everyone in succession -- political leaders, 
deputies, trade unions, and the hungry, embittered people. 
  The concept of a "treaty" requires the interests of all 
sides 
to be taken into consideration, while what B.N.'s team is 
proposing is called capitulation. They are once again trying to 
upset everything, once again speculating on the "people's 
needs." But the people need the team of "reformers" to stop 
mocking the country, it is they who have to surrender. That is 
what they are doing, but at our expense. 
  Why should we voluntarily deprive ourselves of political 
activity for a whole two years when we already lack premises, 
vehicles, communications, and access to television and radio? 
Despoiled and without rights we are being deprived of the last, 
virtually imaginary chance of defending our voters' rights. 
  Why should Zhirinovskiy and Zyuganov lose prestige? Do they 
want the false mass media which no one in the country has 
trusted for a long time now? Should the wave of anger that is 
threatening to sweep everything aside really be stopped? Even 
without the "treaty" one of them will occupy the president's 
post. 
  Might the "treaty" allow the development of the shattered 
military-industrial complex, stop the slump, improve the 
economy, and revive the agricultural sector? No. This marks a 
breathing space before the country is decisively finished off, 
an attempt to avoid the storm that will sweep aside the regime. 
They are unable to introduce a state of emergency regime in 
proper form, it is therefore being introduced under a different 
banner, in essence. That is the tactic of fighting on two fronts 
-- fighting the growing political opposition bloc on the one 
hand and the spontaneous protest of the masses on the other. 
The protest must be deprived of a leader and personalities and 
rendered chaotic. It must be discredited by being criminalized 
in the eyes of society. 
  That is why the Duma has been harassed for four months: It 
had to be rendered compliant and tractable. It is meanwhile 
being said that horse trading is inappropriate and that what is 
at issue is national calm. It is not only appropriate and 
essential, since we are not just talking about the people's 
calm, but ours as well, Ladies and Gentlemen, and the people are 
already fed up with the graveyard calm. 
  Nor will a change of leaders stop this: Deprived of one set 
of leaders they will soon find others who are more decisive and 
more radical. 
  In fact the "treaty" boils down to exacerbating the 
situation, to an attempt to transfer the country's political 
life to a criminal development scenario since a person can 
affect the situation in society either politically or criminally 
and, robbed of political levers, resorts to illegal ones. 
  We think that the quest for social peace is extremely 
necessary but that Yeltsin's team should conduct that quest in a 
real rather than an imaginary political area, honestly, without 
guile and without shirking. And, who can say, without their 
leader perhaps. Especially since many people have already 
realized this and drawn the right conclusions. 
  We think that fulfillment of the following terms constitutes 
the social base of a political partnership for signing this 
"treaty": 
  1. The return to the State Duma of all the former Supreme 
Soviet property and all its rights for deputies' full four-year 
term. The creation of conditions for deputies to take a real 
part in public life. 
  2. An end to mass media persecution of all opposition 
leaders and equal access to radio and television. The opening 
of banned patriotic press publications. 
  3. The replacement of the people's most hated ministers with 
the political leaders of parliamentary factions and the creation 
of a coalition government of people's confidence. 
  4. Early presidential elections. 
  On those terms alone can society arrive at civil peace. 
Those conditions alone can guarantee calm for the team that has 
crippled the country. It has no choice: All other options will 
inevitably bring about civil war and the total annihilation of 
antipeople forces. Political struggle is a normal civilized 
form of struggle, so better that than the chaos of all-out, 
ungovernable fratricide that this "treaty" will inevitably bring 
about. The situation in the country can only be changed once 
there has been a change of "reform" course and in the attitude 
toward political opponents. There is no other way. 
  After reading out his statement from the rostrum, Deputy 
Ivanov said indignantly that when it was being xeroxed certain 
"voluntary censors" had noticeably cut it.

  [Text] The State Duma Committee on Budget, Taxes and 
Finances considers it necessary to limit Russia's foreign loans 
in 1994 to 4.7 billion dollars instead of 5.7 billion dollars 
proposed by the government. 
  The committee prepared a corresponding draft law and a 
report 
on the need to reduce foreign loans. 
  This year the Russian government intends to repay 4.7 
billion 
dollars of foreign debts. The State Duma Committee believes 
that the reduction of loans by the same amount would make the 
size of attracted credits dependent upon the ability of Russia's 
economy to service the foreign debt. 
  Russia's foreign debt without taking into account the debt 
to 
East European countries and delayed commercial payments exceeded 
80 billion dollars by the beginning of 1994. Annual payments 
which Russia is to make according to the schedule of servicing 
and repayments of the principal amount of the debt exceeded 20 
billion dollars in 1992-1993. Holding talks with the clubs of 
Russia's creditors allowed it to reduce repayments of the 
foreign debt to 2 billion dollars in 1992 and 2.2 billion 
dollars in 1993. The servicing and repayment of the foreign 
debt in 1994, taking into account the amount delayed from last 
year, demands the granting of 32 billion dollars.

  [Text] Orenburg April 29 TASS -- Russian Premier Viktor 
Chernomyrdin who arrived in Orenburg on Friday to celebrate the 
250th jubilee of the Orenburg region (gubernia in the past), 
said at the airport to journalists that the government will make 
payments, first of all, to peasants after the federal budget is 
approved by parliament. 
  "Concerns, now experienced by all Russia, are characteristic 
of the Orenburg region too," he stressed. "Let us try and 
settle at least some of them," he added. 
  Journalists welcoming Chernomyrdin at the airport also asked 
him other questions. They were interested when a package of 
documents on press support is put into operation and what its 
essence is. 
  The premier replied that the government is also interested 
in 
this question. He expressed doubt that Russian people need the 
press and television in such amounts as now. "The state will 
maintain several newspapers and tv channels," the cabinet head 
assured. 
  "However, this is for the time being. Experience will show 
what to do in future. I'm against commanding the media. The 
government plans to issue a special decision on questions of the 
press, which do not brook any delay. The decision will be 
issued before the adoption of a press law which will be soon 
approved." 
  Asked by ITAR-TASS about his attitude to the Russian 
president's decision to suspend till July the execution of the 
cabinet's decision on raising customs duties on imports, 
Chernomyrdin noted: "We postponed this decision ourselves, since 
we `outdid' ourselves." 
  "There are international norms: When changes are made in 
customs duties, three months are given to conclude new contracts 
and to establish contacts. We should also abide by this 
three-month norm by some items." 
  The premier's trip to the Orenburg region will last three 
days.

roundup -- from the FINANSOVYYE IZVESTIYA section page I] 
  [Text] The Russian Government owes Moscow 126 billion 
rubles [R]. The failure to pay this money is creating problems 
for the Moscow Government in paying wages to workers in 
budget-funded organizations and financing subway construction. 
A few days ago Moscow Mayor Yuriy Luzhkov noted that Moscow is 
honoring its commitments to the federal budget impeccably, 
adding that it would be more correct if the city were allowed to 
retain part of the taxes for itself "instead of transferring 
them to the federal budget and then waiting for money to come 
back." Luzhkov asked the tax services to examine this option 
for collaborating with the federal authorities in the budget 
sphere.

<F P=106> [Viktor Belikov report: "Saving `Moscow-City' Project; the </F>
Capital's Government Has Taken Over Control of It"] 
  [Text] There has been a change of leader in the "City" 
joint-stock company, which is engaged in the construction of the 
Moscow International Business Center [MIBC] in Presnya -- the 
capital's largest construction project. V. Silin, deputy leader 
of Moscow's construction department, has become the company's 
president in place of A. Khazhakyan (who came to the post in 
1992 after being managing director of the Russian Commodities 
and Raw Materials Exchange). The former has taken charge of 
"City's" board of directors. These personnel changes are 
subject to confirmation at the annual shareholders' meeting 30 
April. 
  The tempting idea of having something akin to New York's 
Manhattan in the Russian capital was conceived two years ago. 
Since then an architectural design for the center has come into 
being, a plan of its transport links has been prepared, and many 
negotiations have been conducted with possible major foreign 
investors, of which one has, it seems, agreed to finance phase 1 
of the construction operations. And that is all as regards 
specific results of the activities of the joint-stock company, 
which has among its shareholders 99 organizations, companies, 
and other legal entities, as well as more than 17,000 individual 
share holders. 
  Evidently, such a slow pace in implementing this project 
which affects the global prestige of Moscow, its government, and 
Mayor Yu. Luzhkov personally, provoked the justified concern of 
the city authorities. 
  Deputy Minister I. Ordzhonikidze brought the government's 
concern to the notice of the joint-stock company's board of 
directors, after which practical conclusions were made -- A. 
Khazhakyan was dismissed. 
  The creation of MIBC ("Moscow-City") continues to be one of 
the city's priority programs. 
  Apart from the construction of a metro line, the clearance 
of 
site of the future center, the laying of underground roads, 
utilities, and main sewers, this work also involves the 
construction of three buildings. They include an office and 
hotel complex costing $150 million built by the "Reforma" fund 
together with foreign partners, a 300-400-room four-star hotel, 
and an administrative and business block. The city government's 
patronage will soon be officially recorded in documentary form 
as a special decree signed by the premier, in which the 
government's present task is formulated as "participating in the 
preparation of infrastructure to attract foreign investment." 
  In other words the city authorities are establishing strict 
control over the execution of "Moscow-City" project, with a view 
to there being something to show on Krasnopresnenskaya 
Embankment by as early as fall 1997 -- the 850th anniversary of 
the Russian capital.

"Tatarstan"] 
  [Text] Leaders of four public organizations -- the Tatar 
Public Center, the Tatarstan Communist Party, the Republican 
Party of Tatarstan, and the People's Front of Tatarstan -- have 
announced the creation of a new democratic opposition 
organization, the Anti-Bureaucratic Front of Tatarstan [AFT]. 
The front stands for the resignation of the bankrupt Sabirov 
government, cuts in and the reorganization of the government 
staff, a merger of the presidential staff with that of the 
Cabinet of Ministers, the abolition of the posts of vice 
president and deputy prime ministers, election of all 
administration chiefs, open decisionmaking by the government (no 
secrets from the people), the publication of all secret 
agreements, the freedom of the mass media, and demands that 
every step, every decision, and every thought of bureaucracy be 
placed under people's control.

  [Text] Another border crossing will be added to the two 
existing major cargo and passenger crossings at Grodekova and 
Poltavka in the Maritime Kray. The crossing, to be opened at 
Turiy Rog settlement in Khankayskiy Rayon, will establish the 
shortest route to the Chinese city of Mishan for thousands of 
tourists and businessmen. 
  The traffic capacity of the new point will be comparatively 
small -- four tourist groups per day. However, according to 
Aleksandr Berestavov, chairman of the Kray Committee for 
Tourism, the opening of motor vehicle access across the border 
will make it easier for many Russians to become acquainted with 
China. 
  In turn, tourists from China, whose numbers have risen 
sharply with the introduction of visa-less exchanges of tourists 
between the two countries, now have one more window into 
Russia's Far East.

"Failed Attempt To Put Soviet Power in Mordovia Together Again"] 
  [Text] An attempt of sorts to revive Soviet government in 
Mordovia -- a decree of the Supreme Soviet Presidium of the 
Republic of Mordovia of 11 April 1994 on the so-called 
"conferences of deputies in the regions" -- did not yield the 
action's organizers the desired results. According to 
unofficial reports, it was impossible to hold these conferences 
in any rayon around Mordovia owing to the absence of a quorum. 
For example, as few as 45 deputies gathered in the Saransk City 
Soviet whereas a quorum requires 93. Mr. Biryukov, speaker of 
the Mordovia parliament, decided to take personal part in the 
restoration of Soviet government in Temnikovskiy Rayon -- it is 
in this rayon that he has the greatest number of like-minded and 
relatives. The speaker still failed to secure a quorum. 
  Biryukov's appeal to the rayon's internal affairs department 
chief to induce the deputies to get together with the help of 
militia did not help. This time around the militia decided 
against meddling in politics. 
  In the meantime, people in Mordovia are awaiting a 
commission 
to arrive from Moscow which was created under Russian Federation 
President Boris Yeltsin's directive No. 193 RP of 18 April 1994. 
Composed of representatives of Russia's Justice Ministry, the 
president's Main Legal Administration, and the president's staff 
for the work with territories, this commission is to see if the 
laws and the other legal acts passed in the Republic of Mordovia 
of late correspond with the Constitution of Russia.

<F P=106> [Report by ITAR-TASS diplomatic correspondent Mikhail </F>
Kalmykov] 
  [Text] Ashgabat 29 April TASS -- French President Francois 
Mitterrand said he believes there is an undoubted link between 
the 50th anniversary of the landing of the allies in Normandy 
and France's recent initiative to conclude a pact on European 
stability. Mitterrand said this in answer to a question from 
ITAR-TASS upon the conclusion of his two-day state visit to 
Turkmenistan. Mitterrand noted that he had participated in the 
war and in the events of 50 years ago. 
  "In a certain sense those events inspired us to form a 
structure which we now describe as the European Union. 
Countries that were at war twice within one century have 
arrived at the conclusion that they should base their future on 
accord and durable union, even if with former adversaries. The 
creators of post-war Europe scored success." Mitterrand noted 
that he now tries to continue their undertaking. 
  In the past, the balance of forces in the world was based on 
the existence of two opposing blocs, Mitterrand noted. The cold 
war that was in progress could have turned into a full-scale war 
any time. After the Soviet Union's dissolution, the military 
bloc opposing NATO disintegrated too. Many countries that were 
in that bloc and some former Union republics turned out to be 
"unprotected" to a certain degree. Europe is not a large 
continent and it is inhabited by many peoples. World history of 
many centuries is full of the clashes of their interests. What 
can be a guarantee against this in future? New states try to 
achieve real independence and ensure their security. 
  "There exists the CSCE mechanism," Mitterrand said. "It 
expands beyond Europe and is based on a good idea. Remarkable 
documents have been signed. Still this is a cumbersome, 
intricate organisation with slow decision-making. Hence, it 
does not offer enough opportunities to avert new wars, cannot 
take multistage measures to prevent conflicts," Mitterrand said. 
The French president believes "CSCE is not flexible enough and 
not prompt enough in decision-making as this process requires a 
consensus. But can there be accord between countries that are 
ready to fight one another? The conflict in former Yugoslavia 
shows that such an accord is impossible." 
  "This is why the French Government, Prime Minister Edouard 
Balladur, in coordination with the president proposed a draft 
treaty described as a pact of stability. Its purpose is to 
avert possible conflicts. The pact must be open to all European 
countries and must become a pact of universal security under 
which no one will have advantages. 
  The head of the French Government assessed the initiative of 
Paris as one of the most important intitiatives in security area 
in the past five years.

  [Text] According to a source at the Russian Federation 
Government, during talks in Brussels, EC and Russian experts did 
not manage to eliminate existing differences on nuclear fuel 
exports from the Russian Federation. In particular, France 
opposes the proposal that nuclear fuel be included in the list 
of commodities mentioned in the framework agreement between 
Russia and the EC. The French side is intent on having a 
restricting quota imposed on natural and enriched uranium 
exports and setting the minimum price for these commodities. At 
the same time, the French do not object to Russia's exports of 
uranium-enrichment services. Russia, for its part, insists that 
nuclear fuel should be included in the agreement, the source 
said.

  [Text] Moscow, 26 Apr -- Trends in the development of the 
CIS clearly show that processes within the CIS member states are 
geared to creating steadily greater supranational features in 
the commonwealth and removing unjustified barriers to economic 
and cultural ties. This was stated by Sergey Filatov, head of 
the Russian Federation president's administration, at the 
opening of an international conference on "Legal problems and 
information aspects of creating a single economic space within 
the CIS." 
  The main aim of the forum which opened today is to 
standardize legislation in the independent states of the former 
USSR to the greatest degree possible, in order to create a 
single economic space within the CIS, but without harming their 
individual sovereignty in any way. The conference is being 
attended by delegations from all the commonwealth member states, 
the Baltic states and representatives of the European Community. 
  Vladimir Shumeyko, Chairman of the Interparliamentary 
Assembly of the CIS Member Countries, is taking part in its work. 
  Russian President Boris Yeltsin and Prime Minister Viktor 
Chernomyrdin have sent greetings to the conference, which will 
last two days.

<F P=106> [Report by Marat Salimov: "Shaping of CIS Legal Space. </F>
Information-Legal Integration May Become Reality"] 
  [Text] The results of the conference that ended yesterday, 
on "Legal and Information Problems of Creating a Single Economic 
Space of the Commonwealth of Independent States," may have a 
certain impact on the progress of integration processes in the 
CIS. If the governments of the CIS countries go along with the 
conference participants' initiative on the creation of a 
specialized coordination council, a single information and legal 
space may be created on the territory of the former USSR. 
  International experience shows that at present, cooperation 
between states in the sphere of information may provide the 
basis for boosting integration processes in the economic area. 
It is quite possible that the international conference, "Legal 
and Information Problems of Creating a Single Economic Space of 
the Commonwealth of Independent States," sponsored by the 
Russian State Legal Administration under the president's staff, 
has already laid the "cornerstone" in the foundation of an 
economic union. The conference participants' good intentions to 
make their contribution to the construction of the 
Commonwealth's building, however, can hardly be implemented 
without government support. This support more likely than not 
is in evidence at the level of the Commonwealth's interstate 
organs. One indirect evidence is the participation in the 
conference of CIS Executive Secretary Ivan Korochenya. 
  The conference participants passed an "Appeal of the 
Conference Participants to the Heads of States and Parliaments 
of CIS Member Countries." It proposes to develop a single 
conception of an interstate exchange of legal information within 
the Commonwealth framework. Importantly, in the opinion of the 
conference participants, the main components for an effective 
exchange of legal information should be suitable coordinating 
structures to be formed within the CIS framework, and personnel 
skilled in the management of state affairs, highly skilled free 
market economy specialists to be trained at an interstate level. 
  The conference decided to organize work on an interstate 
basis to evolve a conception for the forming of a single 
information and legal space whose result should be the creation 
within the Commonwealth's framework of an interstate system of 
legal information that would foster the formation and 
development of the Commonwealth's economic space. A decisive 
contribution to information integration could be made by a 
coordinating council on the provision of legal information 
around the CIS whose creation was proposed by the conference 
participants. The council is supposed to be made up of 
representatives of all CIS member states. The council is 
supposed to carry out the legal analysis of normative-legal 
documents in effect on the territory of the CIS member countries 
and submit the results of this analysis to the state organs of 
the Commonwealth countries.

<F P=106> [Report by ITAR-TASS correspondent] </F>
  [Text] Moscow 28 April TASS--Chairman of the CIS 
Interparliamentary Assembly Vladimir Shumeyko spoke in favour of 
setting up a permanent council of heads of former Soviet 
republics' news agencies. He believes this council can be 
created within the framework of the already existing CIS 
institutions. 
  "We should not lose the single information space," Shumeyko 
told today heads of CIS news agencies, who had gathered in a 
meeting in Moscow. Even if we make significant economic 
progress, we will not achieve integration without preserving the 
single information space, the interparliamentary assembly chief 
stressed. 
  Taking part in the meeting, which is being held at ITAR-TASS 
news agency, are delegations from Armenia, Georgia, Kazakhstan, 
Kirgizia [Kyrgyzstan], Moldavia [Moldova], Russia, Tajikistan, 
Turkmenia [Turkmenistan], Uzbekistan and Ukraine, as well as 
embassy officials. 
  Peoples should be drawn closer together, Shumeyko said, by 
no 
means infringing upon the sovereignty of newly-independent 
states. Economic development of each country is the basis of the 
economic union, and the interparliamentary assembly is to play a 
significant role in this process. The commonwealth has already 
advanced considerably. Over 500 documents have been passed over 
the past two years, although some of them do not work. For this 
reason, Russian President Boris Yeltsin suggested "revising 
these documents and developing a concept of the commonwealth," 
according to Shumeyko. The draft concept is expected to be 
considered this coming autumn. Shumeyko believes, the 
parliaments of CIS member-countries should bring their 
legislative acts in line with one another with a view to 
facilitate customs, visa and other conditions to promote mutual 
integration.

<F P=106> ["Press Review" -- ITAR-TASS headline] </F>
  [Text] Moscow 29 April ITAR-TASS -- Today's national 
newspapers led with reports about the signing of memorandum on 
civic peace in Moscow. 
  "Immense work has been done to draft the accord, taking into 
account the interests of different sides," presidential council 
member Aleksey Salmin wrote in the newspaper ROSSIISKIYE VESTI. 
"It has not yielded a balanced result in every instance, 
regrettably, and the text itself could do with more editing. 
But the main thing is not what the end result of text work is 
but what the accord is going to bring about, how it will work." 
Salmin thinks that it is necessary to create a mechanism of 
implementing the accord. "An important and necessary step has 
been taken, but the most important thin lies ahead -- the 
concept behind the idea of the document has yet to me 
materialized." 
  "The great number of signatories is creating an illusion of 
unity of the country's political forces," PRAVDA says in a 
commentary. "But this is not really so. Not only the communists 
and the Yabloko faction have refused to sign. The socialists, 
democratic christians and a great number of trade unions 
declined to sign. This should make the president think why." 
  "What we watched yesterday (during the ceremony of signing 
of 
the accord) was only the beginning of a complex and even painful 
process of search for concord in Russia", the newspaper TRUD 
said. 
  One other event is highlighted by many newspapers -- the 
killing of a Duma deputy, Andrey Aizderdis. The newspaper 
RABOCHAYA TRIBUNA writes: "We would not like to dwell on 
versions of the murder, for the motive for the crime by no means 
reflects its substance. The substance is related to the reform 
course against which no minister and no fine programmes of 
combating crime can protect us. The redistribution of property, 
the formation of a new elite are not amusing trifles, as the 
ideologues of the course and their supporters would have us 
believe. There are more contestants of room at the top of 
Russia's new society than there is room for them. They are going 
to compete tooth and nail." 
  ROSSIISKIYE VESTI publishes a number of versions of the 
murder of the State Duma deputy, including political 
assassination, contract killing for economic reasons and mafia 
revenge. "It is known that Aizderdis was the publisher of the 
newspaper "KTO EST KTO" (WHO IS WHO) in Moscow's suburb of 
Khimki. In one of its recent issues, the newspaper published a 
list of "underworld leaders." The newspaper prefaced the 
publication with a statement that it is "the first ever 
publication of a near exhaustive list of criminal authorities, 
which was not available to law enforcement operatives until now." 
  The newspaper TRUD said, citing sources in the Russian 
Interior Ministry's chief directorate for combating organised 
crime, that the murder was prompted by Andrey Aizderdis' 
commercial and banking activity. According to ROSSISKIYE VESTI, 
before his election to the State Duma, Aizderdis was MKD bank 
president and headed a cooperative which built roads and 
housing." 
  KOMSOMOLSKAYA PRAVDA reports on the work of the president's 
security service. Commenting on former President Mikhail 
Gorbachev's "unscheduled meetings with crowds," a presidential 
security service member, Andrey Oligov, said "former members of 
the Ninth Chief Directorate (the former KGB's personal security 
department) know that "all unplanned sorties of Mikhail 
Sergeevich to shake hands with common people were simply 
stage-managed. Out in the street he would sometimes, without 
being aware of the fact, talked with KGB agents who were 
strategically placed in the right place at the right time." 
  PRAVDA carries an interview with Vyacheslav Kebich, head of 
the Belarusian Government. The Belarusian premier said the only 
way out of the crisis was "only through creating, in close 
alliance with Russia, an effective model of the economy and fair 
and just society."

<F P=106> [Report by Vladimir Nadein: "Russia's Position Prompts </F>
Optimism in West's Financial Big Shots. Aleksandr Shokhin on 
the Conference of G-7 Finance Ministers"] 
  [Text] Washington -- Although a Russian delegation's 
participation in the conference of G-7 finance ministers became 
a kind of tradition some time ago, our representatives have not 
for a long time enjoyed such a cordial, approving, not to say 
welcoming, atmosphere as the one that prevailed last Sunday [24 
April] at the IMF building in Washington. Ironically 
apologizing for using an "excessively Soviet" word, Deputy Prime 
Minister A.N. Shokhin said that the support for the present 
Russian Government's course was "unanimous." 
  "I was glad to see so much optimism around the table," U.S. 
Treasury Secretary Lloyd Bentsen, chairman of the conference, 
commented on its conclusion. For the first time in quite a long 
time, Russia contributed its share of optimism to the discussion. 
  A few days before the conference, to which world financial 
circles traditionally attach very great significance, IMF 
Executive Director Michel Camdessus had, in several public 
statements, imparted pleasant impressions of his prolonged visit 
to Russia. Whether he had been too alarmed beforehand by 
newspaper reports in which the broad shoulders of V. 
Zhirinovskiy overshadowed the country's entire political scene, 
or whether the departure of several young reformists from the 
government had been seen as a fatal blow to market freedom, in 
any case the contrast proved striking, and M. Camdessus' remarks 
exuded what in Soviet times used to be called a "sense of deep 
pride and legitimate satisfaction." Not only did the "long 
hours of talks" with Prime Minister V. Chernomyrdin convince the 
IMF executive director of the government's commitment to 
reforms, but also the meetings in the State Duma, far from 
ruining this general impression, actually added to the optimism, 
since he recognized that there are some very responsible and 
knowledgeable people in the Duma. 
<H5>  No Doubts About the Course of Reforms </H5>
  "At Sunday's G-7 meeting unanimous support was expressed for 
the Russian Government's course," A. Shokhin said at a meeting 
with Russian journalists on Tuesday [26 April]. "This was 
expressed in the fact that the IMF board of directors granted 
the second part of the credit for systemic transformations, and 
also in the general tone of the discussion compared with the 
meeting at Kromberg in February of this year. At that time the 
discussion concerned whether the (Russian) government intended 
to continue the course of reforms at all. But this time what 
was discussed was pragmatic problems such as providing the 
conditions for an influx of private investments into Russia, the 
creation of favorable tax and customs regimes for such an influx 
of investments, and the problem of insuring investments in 
Russia against political risks." 
  A second group of questions under discussion was connected 
with the creation of nondiscriminatory regimes in commodity 
markets that are fundamental for us --aluminum, uranium, space 
launches, etc. "It is a question of creating a universal legal 
base whereby Russia would be seen as a country with a 
transitional economy, not a country with a centralized state 
system of trade and economy," A. Shokhin explained. "That way 
exactly the same criteria would be applied to it as to any other 
country." 
  In this connection the Russian delegation expressed an 
"urgent desire" for Russia finally to be freed from the 
Jackson-Vanik amendment. Its political aspect consisted in 
pressure on governments that do not allow their citizens freely 
to leave their country and return there. In A. Shokhin's 
opinion, this simply does not apply to present-day Russia. But 
the economic aspect of the amendment is that a discriminatory 
regime could be applied against our country at any moment. And 
that creates an off-putting atmosphere for investors. 
<H5>  World Bank for a Plant Kindergarten </H5>
  The third of the main questions at the conference concerned 
reorienting the package of support for the Russian reforms. The 
package was announced earlier, but a significant part of it was 
not brought to bear on developing the system of social 
protection for the population. 
  "We discussed a possible mechanism for this switch. 
Specifically, it was said that for a transitional period local 
budgets should receive specific financial help, and backing 
should be given to federal programs such as a program of support 
for coal-mining regions," A. Shokhin said. This had been said 
before, but the novelty of the vice prime minister's information 
was that henceforth, World Bank credits will be applied to such 
purposes. 
  The Russian delegation submitted a number of proposals in 
connection with the activity of the so-called Paris Club -- 
representatives of the group of creditor countries. "At the 
moment we have a temporary situation, we are making payments for 
1994 in line with the 1993 agreement, which has been extended to 
1 May. In the light of our budget's potential, we need a better 
agreement than the one that existed in 1993." By "better" the 
vice prime minister clearly meant more favorable terms for 
Russia, but would the creditors agree to this? "There is an 
understanding," A. Shokhin said, somewhat vaguely. 
  Russia also raised the question of its new status in the 
Paris Club as not only a debtor country, but also a creditor 
country. "Very many developing countries have debts to us, as 
the Soviet Union's successor," A. Shokhin said. "We are the 
chief creditor of, for instance, Vietnam, Ethiopia, and others. 
In this connection we do not insist on full membership, but, 
for instance, observer status. That would be appropriate to 
Russia's real position." 
  A. Shokhin said that, in discussing questions of 
collaboration with ministers from the world's seven most 
developed countries, "we emphasize in every way that Russia 
holds a special position. On the one hand it is, so to speak, 
petitioning for support for the reforms and systemic 
transformation in Russia, but on the other hand it is a donor -- 
in particular to countries that were formerly republics of the 
Soviet Union. The scale of this aid is vast, and it is a heavy 
burden on the budget, and this is done not because of any 
imperial ambitions on Russia's part, but for very simple reasons 
-- you cannot cut off the gas in winter, you cannot leave those 
states without heat or electricity. Therefore, Russia is 
obliged to "supply them with relatively cheap and sometimes free 
resources." [quotemarks as published] 
  "In this context we would also like to support a system 
proposed by the IMF executive director," A. Shokhin continued. 
"What I am referring to is that Russia could offer credits to 
the CIS states jointly with other willing countries, but 
formally it would be in the form of credits from international 
financial organizations. We would thereby clear ourselves of 
possible accusations of imperial aspirations, and on the other 
hand increase repayment guarantees, because the credits would 
have the status of credits from international financial 
institutions." 
  Near the end of the session, a piece of news that everyone 
found alarming arrived from Moscow. News agency cables reported 
that the Duma, with the government's consent, had increased the 
country's expenditure budget by 8 trillion rubles -- such a 
substantial sum that the threat of inflation could have spoiled 
the good impression that everyone had received of the new 
approaches in Russia. "We spent half the day today explaining 
what all this meant," A. Shokhin said with a smile. "We 
explained to everyone, including Camdessus himself." 
  "It is true that the budget figures have `changed 
somewhat,'" 
the vice prime minister noted. But what happened was in the 
main a technical adjustment. We decided to release credits to 
agriculture -- about 6 trillion rubles -- not through the 
Central Bank and commercial banks, which is a long road, and 
experience shows that here there are many abuses and improper 
use of the credits. The commercial banks make the credits work 
for them before directing them to the countryside. And we have 
decided to do it in the form of budget appropriations. Overall 
monetary emission is not changed, but these credits, being 
recorded under the budget heading, increase the apparent budget 
deficit, but in principle, this is IMF methodology. The IMF 
has long been making us show these concessionary credits in the 
budget. Now we can dictate the terms for the expenditure of 
these resources." 
  The Russian delegation set forth its position on attracting 
investments to Russia. "Unless, in the next few months, we can 
organize this influx, contradictions will arise between a 
relatively rigorous credit and financial policy and a deepening 
recession in production." A. Shokhin said that the granting of 
$1.5 billion for systemic transformations in the near future 
does not cause the slightest euphoria in the government, since 
this money is "already accounted for in the budget, we have 
already spent it" -- because the government was sure of 
receiving it. The question of the need to go over to 
medium-term payment balances -- otherwise there will be payment 
peaks. 
  "For instance, this year, out of the sum of over $4 billion 
allocated for servicing and extinguishing the foreign debt, we 
are forced to spend a large proportion on servicing Russia's 
debts -- not the former Soviet debts. In this connection we are 
actively suggesting to G-7 that the borrowed credits be applied 
without Russian Government guarantees. Outlines have already 
been drawn up. In accordance with framework agreements signed 
in September by the U.S. `Eximbank' and the corresponding 
Russian organizations, the Central Bank of Russia and the 
Finance Ministry offer so-called comfort terms for foreign 
investors. True, at the moment this only applies to the oil and 
gas sector. But the comfort is expressed in the fact that 
guarantees can be offered against credits, these guarantees can 
be sold for rubles, rubles can be converted into foreign 
currency, and foreign currency can be repatriated." 
  Thus, instead of government guarantees, which are expressed 
in the formula "if an enterprise does not pay for itself, we 
will pay," new guarantees are appearing: You can demand that 
the enterprise, the Central Bank, and the Finance Ministry 
fulfill quite specific conditions. In particular, the Finance 
Ministry must, under this contract, compensate foreign investors 
for less favorable taxation conditions or other things connected 
with a change in legislation. "Many people are prepared to work 
with us on these terms. We are now holding talks with the 
Italians and the Germans," the vice prime minister concluded, 
clearly satisfied with the results of the conference of the G-7 
finance ministers in the U.S. capital.

<F P=106> [Report by ITAR-TASS correspondent Aleksandr Mineyev] </F>
  [Excerpts] Brussels, 29 Apr -- Russia and the European 
Union are completing their consultations on the partnership and 
cooperation agreement, Russian Deputy Prime Minister Aleksandr 
Shokhin told an ITAR-TASS correspondent during his brief 
stopover in Brussels on his way from the United States to Moscow. 
  A number of barriers blocking the progress toward agreement 
have been removed, said the deputy head of the Russian 
Government. He added however that a meeting between him and 
Leon Brittan, deputy chairman of the European Commission, would 
be necessary to reach a final agreement on questions of 
principle. Among other things, they will discuss trade in 
enriched uranium. Russia has proposed compromise solutions, 
which will have to be developed into approved texts. If this is 
achieved, then the agreement could be initialled while Greece is 
still chairing the EC -- that is, before the end of June -- and 
it could be signed when Germany takes over the chairmanship. 
  Aleksandr Shokhin, the official head of the Russian 
delegation at the talks in Brussels, was delayed in the United 
States by the funeral of Richard Nixon, so that his stay in the 
"capital of Europe" has been curtailed to just one night. His 
meeting with Leon Brittan will take place in Moscow where the 
latter is going on 1 May. [passage omitted] 
  As it deals with global issues, Russia is striving to build 
relations on a partnership basis; it does not merely ask for 
help but insists that there should be universal rules, 
beneficial both to her and to other countries, said Deputy Prime 
Minister A. Shokhin. "This will be the leitmotiv in our contacts 
both with the G-7 and with international financial organizations 
-- not aid in exchange for reforms but creating general 
mechanisms of interaction between partners," Aleksandr Shokhin 
stressed.

  [Text] Moscow, 29 Apr -- "The visit by Russian President 
Boris Yeltsin to the Republic of Korea in 1992 marked the start 
of our relations," Russian Defense Minister Pavel Grachev said, 
opening talks with Yi Pyong-tae, ROK national defense minister, 
who is in Russia on an official visit. "We are offering South 
Korea cooperation in various fields, including the military." 
  Yi Pyong-tae, for his part, noted that, during the flight 
from Tokyo to Moscow, the South Korean delegation "crossed the 
huge territory of Russia and we sensed the great potential of 
your country." 
  As already reported, the defense ministers of Russia and the 
ROK are exchanging views on the development of the situation in 
Northeast Asia and, primarily, on the issue of the 
nonproliferation of nuclear weapons in the Korean peninsula. P. 
Grachev and Yi Pyong-tae will discuss ways of expanding 
Russian-South Korean military cooperation. A document on mutual 
understanding over measures to develop ties between the Defense 
Ministries of Russia and the ROK in 1994-95 is expected to be 
signed. 
  During his stay in Russia, the head of the South Korean 
defense department will also meet high-ranking representatives 
of the Russian Government and will visit miltary units and 
defense enterprises.

  [Text] At the end of today's talks, Pavel Grachev and Yi 
Pyong-tae signed a memorandum on mutual understanding between 
the Defense Ministries of Russia and the Republic of Korea and a 
declaration on military cooperation between the two countries. 
In the words of Russian Defense Minister, these documents 
reflect the sides' intention to develop broader cooperation and 
determine the main events within the framework of ties between 
the two countries' military departments in 1994-95. 
  Pavel Grachev told journalists after the documents were 
signed that he had received an invitation from his South Korean 
counterpart to visit the Republic of Korea in 1995. We hope, 
said the Russian defense minister, to sign additional documents 
there on closer cooperation, perhaps in the military-technical 
sphere. He did not rule out the possibility of an agreement on 
preventing various kinds of unauthorized military actions being 
signed in Seoul.

<F P=106> ["Exclusive" report No. 17 of 67] </F>
  [Text] According to politologists, the negotiations between 
Russian and Ukrainian Defense Ministers on a stage-by-stage 
settlement of the Black Sea Fleet problem held on April 21-22 in 
Sevastopol were fruitless. The delegations of two countries 
have not signed any documents. At the same time the Russian 
party refused to sign the protocol of the negotiations "due to 
non-constructive position of the Ukrainian delegation," as one 
of the members of the Russian delegation said. As experts 
assert, Kiev's position presents the major stumbling-block 
because it deems it possible to preserve the Black Sea Fleet in 
Crimea only on a temporary basis and insists on a joint basing 
of the Black Sea Fleet and Ukraine's Navy in Sevastopol. At the 
same time the parties reached an agreement stipulating that Kiev 
would receive 18.3 percent of the Fleet's ships and Russia would 
buy the remaining part. To this effect Admiral EDUARD BALTIN, 
commander of the Black Sea Fleet, answered the questions put by 
our Interfax correspondent Sergey Safronov. 
  IF: The first and the major question which I would like to 
put to you is the division of the Black Sea Fleet. All 
Russians, but not only servicemen, are deeply concerned over 
this fact. 
  E.BALTIN: This problem is unclear until now. The Ukrainian 
side puts forward quite different variants regarding the Fleet's 
division, including the 50:50 proportion. However, it is not 
clear for me what this means. It is necessary to take into 
account the value of the property destined to division but not 
only its quantity. We should introduce definite factors. For 
example, the value of one naval engineer college in Holland is 
equal to the value of a half of the Black Sea Fleet because 
there are many mechanisms and equipment in the college, 
including atomic reactors for submarines of two generations. 
  At the present stage Ukraine proposes to Russia to divide 
the 
Black Sea Fleet after its inventory as of December 1, 1992, that 
is as of the day I took the office of the Black Sea Fleet 
commander. However, it is known that before this date Ukraine 
had already misappropriated 35 percent of the Fleet, including 
material reserves of the Black Sea Fleet's rear service. 
According to available information, total losses of the Black 
Sea Fleet are 101,658 million rubles in 1991 prices. 
  IF: What are the largest sites misappropriated by Kiev? 
  E.BALTIN: First of all, I'd like to note that Russia has 
lost two naval colleges and a unique center for re-training of 
naval aviation pilots - it was the sole center in the USSR; the 
country paid several billion rubles for its construction. The 
center was used for training of carrier aviation pilots. There 
was a unique equipment for aircraft's landing, a runway strip 
with warming, a springboard, etc. A factory for the repair of 
all major kinds of the Fleet's aviation equipment was in the 
center in addition to the training base. Now Kiev tries to let 
this center to Russia. In my opinion, it would be erroneous to 
rent it because for Moscow it would be a gold rent - a company 
of SU-27 aircraft assigned to the 60th corps of Ukraine's air 
defense forces, an aviation grouping near the city of Saki, and 
the Ukrainian garrison will be maintained at the expense of this 
rent. 
  In addition, there is an agreement between the governments 
of 
the Russian Federation and Ukraine on the cooperation in the 
sphere of ship building and ship repair signed on January 15, 
1993 by the former Ukrainian premier Leonid Kuchma and Russian 
Premier Viktor Chernomyrdin. In accordance with this agreement 
the Russian party pledges to supply Kiev with accessory 
equipment, material resources, armaments, and other military 
equipment for the ships being built by Ukraine's Navy. 
  Kiev has received a missile cruiser Slava, minor 
antisubmarine and assault landing crafts, and a patrol boat. 
These ships were almost ready for exploitation (their readiness 
was 65-85 percent). The time has passed but Ukraine has not 
built a single ship. However, it has re-named the missile 
cruiser two times, at first it was called Bogdan Khmelnitskiy 
(the initiator of Ukraine's reunification with Russia in XVII 
century - Interfax) and now - Vilna Ukraina. It is almost 
ready for 90 percent and Kiev has no force to finish its 
construction. Meanwhile, the cruiser has 16 rocket launchers 
with the range 500 kilometers. There are no such ships either 
in the Black or in the Mediterranean Seas, or in the composition 
of the 6th Fleet of the US Navy... 
  Besides, the Ukrainian party started to dismantle the 
cruiser 
Varyag at the Nikolayev shipyards which was almost ready for 
service; Ukraine intends to cut the cruiser for metal. The 
cruiser Ulyanovsk can face the same fate. Destruction of the 
Fleet is practically underway. I believe that in this case 
Ukraine has inflicted damage not only to Russia because these 
ships were the national treasury of all peoples of the Soviet 
Union. 
  IF: It's not quite clear, why do we need to make inventory 
of the Black Sea Fleet if a strict registration of all material 
resources is obligatory held at the Fleet... 
  E.BALTIN: I believe that this inventory is nothing more but 
an attempt of the Ukrainian party to prolong solution of this 
issue and to avoid the agreements reached by Russian and 
Ukrainian presidents earlier and a strive "to dig in an alien 
bag." Both Russian and Ukrainian military departments know 
everything about the Black Sea Fleet, they know about every 
screw, not speaking about the ships. 
  I'd like to note that in contradiction to the Yalta 
agreements, since last August Kiev stopped to finance training 
of the Ukrainian Navy personnel which is being carried out on 
the base of the Russian Black Sea Fleet and takes much money. 
For example, in the US Navy training of one naval conscript, 
which is to last 48 days on international standards, costs more 
than 5000 dollars. Ukrainian mariners are undergoing a more 
serious training in the training detachments of the Russian 
Black Sea Fleet and receive military professions almost free of 
charge. 
  The majority of Ukrainians (thousands of them are on service 
in the Black Sea Fleet) finish their training in the rank of 
petty officers and are well-trained. As a commander, I do not 
have any claims to mariners who swore the oath of allegiance to 
Ukraine, they serve splendidly. Especially strong personnel is 
being called up in Ukraine's western regions where conscripts 
undergo moral training in military commissariats. The 
conscripts are explained that they will be Ukraine's "gold fund" 
and the Ukrainian people need them badly. There have been no 
inter-ethnic conflicts among rank-and-file personnel. Ordinary 
people understand everything. 
  IF: But it is quite natural that Ukraine needs its own Navy. 
  E.BALTIN: I believe that Ukraine claims for a part of the 
Black Sea Fleet ships only in order to immediately sell them 
abroad as scrap amounting to 120-140 dollars per ton. At the 
same time, currently Kiev is experiencing the deepest crisis and 
does not understand what threat for the country pose those 
thousands of mariners who will be thrown into streets. 
  IF: Once upon a time you said that there is little water in 
the Black Sea and much politics... 
  E.BALTIN: The situation has not changed. As a matter of 
fact, there is too much politics around the Black Sea Fleet but 
economy decides everything. I believe that extreme political 
decisions are adopted at the time when the country's leaders 
understand that the economy is experiencing a crisis. This 
results in a confrontation between peoples. 
  IF: Over the last period of time several Ukrainian 
politicians, including high-ranking ones, have voiced their 
statements to draw "a third party" to solve the Black Sea Fleet 
problems, they even called a concrete address -- the United 
States. What is your attitude towards this fact? 
  E.BALTIN: I can express only my perplexity on this case. 
Personally I categorically oppose Washington's participation. 
  It's primarily Russia's problem. Given historic and 
political realities, Moscow is negotiating with Kiev. It's 
hardly probable that the Russian Federation will negotiate on 
the Fleet with the involvement of the American party. 
  In general, I believe that having interpreted the Moscow 
agreement signed by presidents Kravchuk and Yeltsin on its own 
way, Kiev has violated one of the major articles of this 
agreement, namely on separate basing of the Russian Black Sea 
Fleet and Ukraine's Navy. I am convinced that the presence of 
two Fleets and headquarters in one place of stationing 
disorganizes the work of the servicemen and destabilizes the 
situation in Sevastopol. 
  In case the situation does not change, consequences can be 
unpredictable. 
  In my opinion, absence of money for the construction of its 
own base is the major reason of this position on the part of 
Kiev. It's easier to live for somebody's money. 
  IF: What influence can exert the present situation in the 
Black Sea Fleet on the international situation? 
  E.BALTIN: The activity of the West's forces on the Black Sea 
is being strengthened because any vacuum in the political space 
should be filled. Last year NATO's 15 ships visited the Black 
Sea in accordance with planned exercises, with the participation 
of Bulgarian and Romanian fleets as well. There has been no 
such an intensive pressure before. According to available 
information, a conference of NATO's Allied armed forces was held 
late October which passed a decision to include the Black Sea 
into the zone of NATO's interests. 
  According to the unanimously adopted document, a formation 
of 
NATO's ships consisting of 8-9 crafts should be created in this 
region; it will exert control over the activity of other fleets 
in the Black Sea. 
  Turkey has procured eight Knox frigates which are equipped 
with missiles. The Turkish fleet has enormously increased its 
missile potential. 
  IF: What is your attitude towards joint exercises which are 
conducted between the fleets of the Russian Federation and NATO? 
  E.BALTIN: Such an exercise was conducted in the Norwegian 
Sea 
not long ago. One destroyer participated in it on the part of 
the Russian North Fleet. A three-star admiral was aboard this 
destroyer, However, a Norwegian rear admiral was commanding at 
the exercises, it corresponds to the level of a brigade 
commander... 
  IF: The Republic of Crimea has its first president - Yuriy 
Meshkov. How you would build your relations with him? 
  I'd like to note that in contradiction to the Yalta 
agreements, since last August Kiev stopped to finance training 
of the Ukrainian Navy personnel which is being carried out on 
the base of the Russian Black Sea Fleet and takes much money. 
For example, in the US Navy training of one naval conscript, 
which is to last 48 days on international standards, costs more 
than 5000 dollars. Ukrainian mariners are undergoing a more 
serious training in the training detachments of the Russian 
Black Sea Fleet and receive military professions almost free of 
charge. 
  The majority of Ukrainians (thousands of them are on service 
in the Black Sea Fleet) finish their training in the rank of 
petty officers and are well-trained. As a commander, I do not 
have any claims to mariners who swore the oath of allegiance to 
Ukraine, they serve splendidly. Especially strong personnel is 
being called up in Ukraine's western regions where conscripts 
undergo moral training in military commissariats. The 
conscripts are explained that they will be Ukraine's "gold fund" 
and the Ukrainian people need them badly. There have been no 
inter-ethnic conflicts among rank-and-file personnel. Ordinary 
people understand everything. 
  IF: But it is quite natural that Ukraine needs its own Navy. 
  E.BALTIN: I believe that Ukraine claims for a part of the 
Black Sea Fleet ships only in order to immediately sell them 
abroad as scrap amounting to 120-140 dollars per ton. At the 
same time, currently Kiev is experiencing the deepest crisis and 
does not understand what threat for the country pose those 
thousands of mariners who will be thrown into streets. 
  IF: Once upon a time you said that there is little water in 
the Black Sea and much politics... 
  E.BALTIN: The situation has not changed. As a matter of 
fact, there is too much politics around the Black Sea Fleet but 
economy decides everything. I believe that extreme political 
decisions are adopted at the time when the country's leaders 
understand that the economy is experiencing a crisis. This 
results in a confrontation between peoples. 
  IF: Over the last period of time several Ukrainian 
politicians, including high-ranking ones, have voiced their 
statements to draw "a third party" to solve the Black Sea Fleet 
problems, they even called a concrete address -- the United 
States. What is your attitude towards this fact? 
  E.BALTIN: I can express only my perplexity on this case. 
Personally I categorically oppose Washington's participation. 
  It's primarily Russia's problem. Given historic and 
political realities, Moscow is negotiating with Kiev. It's 
hardly probable that the Russian Federation will negotiate on

  IF: The Republic of Crimea has its first president - Yuriy 
Meshkov. How you would build your relations with him? 
  E.BALTIN: Meshkov has made several resolute political moves 
and this testifies to the fact that he is a resolute man; as any 
military man I respect resolute people. At the same time I 
believe that Meshkov has not made any constitutional violations. 
  IF: How the polemics around the Black Sea Fleet has 
influenced its combat efficiency? 
  E.BALTIN: The level of combat efficiency has not lowered 
compared, say, with 1990. The Black Sea Fleet has received 
various awards for rocket firing, torpedo firings from 
submarines, and for the operations of the tactical group of 
missile boats. The marine infantry battalion on fire 
preparation, which is the best in Russia, serves at the Black 
Sea Fleet. 
  IF: What is your opinion concerning the plans to create a 
Russian naval base in the Georgian port of Poti? 
  E.BALTIN: I see no sense in this idea. This zone is 
deserted by the war; does Russia need this burden, is it not 
beneficial to build a base on its own territory? There are 
suitable places for this, say, in the region of Anapa. There 
exist well developed infrastructures there. One should bear in 
mind two notions, military necessity and economic expediency. 
Any operation, even if it is thoroughly prepared, will fail if 
it has no material support. Economy but not a military commander 
is the major winner in a war. 
  IF: Are Russian ships on service in the Mediterranean Sea 
now? 
  E.BALTIN: The Black Sea Fleet is permanently stationing 
there 
but given our economic opportunities the number of Russian ships 
in the Mediterranean Sea is a minimum one, there are less than 
ten ships there. 
  IF: Has the Black Sea Fleet suffered due to the fact that 
Ukraine stopped power supply to Crimea for some time? 
  E.BALTIN: Of course, the Fleet has experienced several 
losses, we were forced to use our own power supply systems, 
diesel generators, and boiling-rooms, as a result we have spent 
a great amount of fuel. It is known, that Ukraine is provided 
with its own resources only for 30 percent, it receives the rest 
amount from Russia. Consequently, Kiev has no right to speak 
about possible energy blockade of Crimea. 
  In case it takes place, the Black Sea Fleet can lay several 
underwater power cables via the Kerchenskiy bay to Russia within 
two or three months and solve this problem. It is quite 
possible from the technical point of view. 
  IF: They say that you perfectly shoot from any kinds of 
arms... 
  E.BALTIN: This is my hobby. I think that every officer, 
irrespective of the fact where he serves, should possess good 
skills in order to shoot any kinds of arms.

  [Text] Moscow April 28 TASS -- "Missile retargeting" 
planned for this coming May is not to impair the combat 
readiness of Russian missile forces, according to their 
commander-in-chief, Colonel-General Igor Sergeyev. 
  In an interview with TASS after today's meeting with some 
foreign military attaches, Sergeyev said the "retargeting" will 
be performed in full accordance with the Moscow declaration 
signed by the Russian and U.S. Presidents. Under this document, 
Moscow and Washington are obliged to retarget their strategic 
nuclear missiles by May 30, 1994, so that they should not be 
targeted at each other. This initiative was also joined by 
Great Britain. 
  According to experts, the scheme of retargeting is not 
complicated: geographical reference of the targets in Russia and 
the United States put in the computer working memory are 
expected to be replaced by those of some desert areas of the 
world ocean.

<F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS correspondents Dmitriy Gorokhov and Gennadiy </F>
Kulbitskiy] 
  [Text] Bonn, 28 Apr--The foreign ministers of Russia and 
Germany, Andrey Kozyrev and Klaus Kinkel, discussed a number of 
extremely important subjects today at the German Government's 
Petersberg residence on the Rhine River: Russian Federation 
President Boris Yeltsin's planned official visit to the Germany 
on 11-13 May of this year, ways of settling the Bosnian problem, 
the situation in the Near East, and the situation in the 
Republic of South Africa. 
  "I have had talks with Russia's foreign minister, or rather 
my friend, Andrey Kozyrev...." In this unexpectedly friendly 
manner, Kinkel began his statement at the closing news 
conference. He stressed that people in Germany are awaiting the 
arrival of President Yeltsin with interest and joy, and 
preparations are on the whole complete, with only a number of 
technical matters to be clarified. 
  The main thought expressed by the head of the German 
department was that Germans considers it important for Russia to 
be fully involved in the process of seeking a settlement in 
Bosnia and that all decisions on this question should be adopted 
only with the participation of the Russian side. This applies 
not only to Bosnia but also to the Near East. 
  After his introductory statement, Kinkel was frankly bored, 
shifting his weight from one foot to the other while the Russian 
minister was given a hard time, as virtually the entire hail of 
questions fell on him. The journalists learned that Russian 
views on a Bosnian settlement coincided to a considerable extent 
with the Kinkel-Juppe initiative that was put forward by the 
foreign ministers of the FRG and France within the framework of 
the European Union [EU]. "The task now is to make this 
position, which is becoming consolidated, more precise--taking 
into account the experience of recent months--and also to get 
the United States involved in it." 
  "As a result of a series of meetings and conversations that 
took place this week", Kozyrev said, "I feel considerable 
satisfaction in connection with the fact that our Western 
partners are not confining themselves to settling the problem by 
military means, which are an extreme measure in extreme 
circumstances. Along with Russia, the West is prepared to 
double the pace and quality of work specifically on the 
political approach to settling the conflict in Bosnia. The 
forthcoming meeting of foreign ministers could prove to be a 
decisive stage on the path to holding a summit conference." 
  At the same time, there were tough notes, normally not 
associated with the foreign minister, to be detected in 
Kozyrev's words, especially with regard to the actions of the 
parties to the Bosnian conflict. "We need to see how events 
develop, but the foreign ministers of Russia, the United States, 
the EU, and the United Nations could also discuss the Bosnian 
problem without the involvement of the conflicting parties. It 
seems to me," he continued, "that the important thing now is for 
Russia, the United States, the EU, and the United Nations to 
work out a coordinated approach. This is necessary in order to 
make the conflicting parties in Bosnia aware that there is a 
reasonable alternative to war and that they will not succeed in 
playing on differences between various states." 
  "The conflicting sides in Bosnia should get it clear: They 
can no longer continue the game in which one side or the other 
puts forward deliberately unacceptable demands, for example, on 
territory. There will be no more of this," Kozyrev said. 
  ... the military part of the Cologne-Bonn airport, then by 
helicopter to "Petersberg", three hours later back to the 
airport. [sentence as received] The aircraft set out for 
Moscow. The latest visit by Russian Federation Foreign Minister 
Andrey Kozyrev to the FRG has ended. It was a working visit.

Gorokhov] 
  [Text] Moscow, 28 Apr--A ministerial level meeting 
involving Russia, the United States, the European Union [EU], 
and the United Nations to discuss matters regarding a Bosnian 
settlement could be held as early as the beginning of May. This 
was stated by Andrey Kozyrev on Thursday [28 April] evening upon 
his return to Moscow from his trip to Geneva and Bonn, where he 
had talks with the leaders of the foreign policy departments of 
the United States, France, and Germany. 
  "There is a fairly big chance that success will be achieved 
in organizing a ministerial meeting during the course of next 
week," the Russian foreign minister told journalists. He said 
that a possible venue for the meeting was Geneva. 
  According to Kozyrev, much will depend on how things go in 
the contact group of four that has been established at the level 
of special representatives to prepare a full report on the 
situation in Bosnia-Herzegovina. It has emerged that Russian 
Deputy Foreign Minister Vitaliy Churkin, who represents Russia 
in the group, will have a meeting in Oslo within the next few 
days with Thorvald Stoltenberg, the cochairman of the 
coordinating committee of the International Conference on 
Yugoslavia.

<F P=106> [Report by Aleksandr Sychev: "Moscow Considering Writing </F>
Off Syrian Debts"] 
  [Text] "The Syrians have acknowledged their debt to Russia 
and our political succession. That is major progress. The 
talks will continue," according to Viktor Posuvalyuk, the 
Russian president's special representative in the Near East and 
member of the government delegation which has been conducting 
talks in Damascus under the leadership of Oleg Soskovets, first 
deputy chairman of the Russian Federation Government. The 
delegation members prefer not to go into the details of the 
continuing talks, but the idea of writing off part of the Syrian 
debt was apparently discussed in Damascus. 
  The problem of the debt, which stands at approximately $10 
billion, is the most acute one in our relations with Syria. A 
large part of the debt results from major purchases of Soviet 
weapons in the seventies and eighties. 
  Skokov's [as published] trip to Syria was supposed not only 
to revive the frozen relations with a partner in the Near East 
who was once important to the USSR. The visit was part of the 
revitalized Russian policy in the region, which Moscow sees as 
the second most important area after Yugoslavia in which it can 
demonstrate Russia's new role in world affairs as a great power. 
  Russia is pretty well placed in the region. It has the 
opportunity to establish qualitatively new links with old 
friends. It has many former compatriots in Israel. The first 
test was the request made by the Russian delegation in Damascus 
to help find Israeli servicemen missing during the Israeli 
invasion of Lebanon in 1982. Moscow could also be of use in the 
process of the settlement of the Syrian-Israeli conflict over 
the Golan Heights. captured by Israel in 1967. U.S. Secretary 
of State Warren Christopher intends to pass to Damascus a 
proposal on the stage-by-stage return of the occupied 
territories over a period of 10 years. 
  Russia's growing importance in Near East affairs was 
acknowledged in Moscow by Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhaq Rabin. 
Evidently, it was this that prompted him to settle for Moscow's 
promise not to sell new offensive weapons to Syria, a matter 
that was broached in connection with the agreement on 
military-technical cooperation signed by Soskovets in Damascus. 
Moscow will resume supplies of spare parts and also purely 
defensive weapon systems. It is to be hoped that this treaty 
will not lead to a further increase in Syria's debt to Russia, 
which is facing massive financial problems.

<F P=106> [Report by Aleksandr Sychev: "Russia Lets Syria Off $8 </F>
Billion. Moscow Casts Doubts on This Report from Damascus"] 
  [Text] Russia is prepared to write off for Syria over 80 
percent of its debt. This was reported by the ITAR-TASS agency, 
according to Yuriy Mikhaylov, adviser to First Vice Premier Oleg 
Soskovets, who is head of the Russian government delegation to 
Syria. 
  Talks are under way in Damascus on a wide range of issues 
that have built up over the past few years, which have been 
marked by a sharp downturn in relations between Syria and 
Russia. Annual trade between the two countries now stands at 
only $50 million. Once a major consumer of Soviet weapons, 
Syria buys practically nothing from Russia. The Syrian debt 
stands at approximately $10 billion, and a large part of the 
payments on it is already overdue. 
  The government delegation is empowered to tackle the whole 
range of Russian-Syrian relations. According to Soskovets' 
adviser, Russia is suggesting that the remaining 20 percent be 
paid off as follows: Damascus would pay 60 percent in hard 
currency and the rest in consumer goods over a period of 10 
years. In other words, despite being in financial straits 
itself, Russia is giving away $8 billion and offering very easy 
terms for the repayment of the remaining part of the debt. 
  Does the Russian package of proposals the delegation took 
with it to Damascus really contain these offers? Igor Gryzanov, 
chief of the Syria department at the Foreign Economic Relations 
Ministry suggested that IZVESTIYA wait for the delegation to 
return. 
  The Foreign Ministry doubted the possibility of such a large 
part of the debt being written off. It would require a decision 
by the government or president. "I doubt whether we would make 
such concessions," a Foreign Ministry aide said, "although I 
cannot speak for the first vice premier. We want to achieve a 
solution, but not to Russia's detriment." 
  How useful it would be for Russia to waive part of the debt 
in order to revitalize economic relations with Syria it is hard 
to say. If Damascus is finding it difficult to pay the debt, 
then the likelihood is that trade with Syria will not be very 
worthwhile for Russia in the future.

Diplomatic Correspondents Igor Porshnev, Vitaly Trubetskoy, and 
others] 
  [Text] In the near term Russia should ratify the agreement 
on the leasing of the Baykonur cosmodrome signed with 
Kazakhstan. Early May the Russian Space Agency (RSA) and the 
Russian Foreign Ministry intend to prepare all the necessary 
documents related to the agreement on the leasing of the 
cosmodrome so that Russian President Boris Yeltsin would present 
them to the State Duma for consideration. A top-ranking 
employee of the RSA reported to Interfax that the text of 
Yeltsin's letter which explains the need to ratify the agreement 
as soon as possible should be prepared by Friday. 
  The RSA representative underlined that "the presidents' 
signatures dated March 28 are not enough to hand over the 
cosmodrome for lease." "The sum totalling 115 million dollars 
(for the lease) is a large amount money and the decision on its 
allocation should be included into the budget of the Russian 
Federation," stressed he. "If this does not take place Russia 
will remain without Baykonur," he said.

<F P=106> [Report by Oleg Panfilov under the "Tajikistan" rubric: </F>
"Republic's Foreign Ministry Knows More than Anyone Else: Its 
Reports Are More Reminiscent of Intelligence Data"] 
  [Text] The Tajikistan Foreign Ministry's information 
department distributed a number of sensational pieces of news on 
25 April. INTERFAX's correspondent reported from Dushanbe 
citing department chief Zafar Saidov that according to the 
Foreign Ministry (!), "in March-April of this year a 
redeployment of armed groupings belonging to the Tajikistan 
Islamic Revival Movement has been reported on Afghan territory 
in the provinces of Qonduz and Tahar." The Foreign Ministry also 
learned that the opposition units have been supplied with food 
and transport by General Abdol Basir Haled, commander of the 
29th Infantry Division of the Afghan Defense Ministry, and that 
in the Tajik province of Badakhshan an opposition armed grouping 
of up to 1500 hit-men has been massed under Khadzhi Abdulrashid 
Badakhshi, a confectioner (!). The same Zafar Saidov unveiled 
the opposition's plans, telling journalists that "the hit-men 
are going to reach the territory of the Gornyy Badakhshan 
autonomous oblast and to approach the area of the Khaburabad 
pass to carry out military operations against Tajikistan 
Government forces." 
  INTERFAX's anonymous military source confirmed that a 
breakthrough across the border was planned in the Ishkashim 
district of Gornyy Badakhshan. At the command staff of the 
Russian Border Troops in Tajikistan it was confirmed that on 23 
April guards clashed with three border violators, who were 
killed in the ensuing skirmish, in the 2d border post's zone of 
action in the Ishkashim district border. On 24 April, another 
two intruders were shot dead in the same zone. In the same 
breath, the INTERFAX report speaks about an active discussion of 
the new draft Constitution, although the text was published only 
22 April. 
  Apart from military information, reports about candidates 
for 
president should also be expected from Tajikistan. Now it is 
known at least that the election campaign has already started 
among the population: Names mentioned most commonly include 
Supreme Soviet Chairman Emomali Rakhmonov; his first deputy, 
Abdumadzhid Dostiyev; Abdumalik Abdulladzhanov, former prime 
minister and current ambassador to Russia; and also Major 
General Yakub Salimov, internal affairs minister. 
  There are a number of inconsistencies in the latest reports 
of the Foreign Ministry information department. First, 
Makhmadsakhi Azizkhonov, chairman of the Ishkashim district, 
does not know anything about the armed clash; Badakhshan 
administration officials deny it, too. In reality, a resident 
of the Ishkashim district told your NEZAVISIMAYA GAZETA 
correspondent that on 23 April local residents held a rally 
outside the building of the district executive committee to 
protest bread shortages. Earlier they also complained about the 
catastrophic situation with food supplies by sending to Khorog a 
telegram, the text of which was published in the local ZINDAGI 
newspaper. 
  Second, the Tajik Foreign Ministry information department 
did 
not know anything about a KRASNAYA ZVEZDA publication on 
Saturday (23 April) that gives -- presumably citing military 
intelligence sources -- an absolutely different account of the 
strength of opposition hit-men and a different name of the armed 
group's commander. Third, the diplomatic ministry has put 
itself in a fairly awkward position by divulging unique 
information and showing that it is perfectly familiar not only 
with the situation in military circles, but also with detailed 
plans of the opposition. If this is really so, it turns out 
that the Foreign Ministry is engaged in intelligence and 
counterintelligence operations, thus assisting the Tajikistan 
Security Ministry and the Russian Main Intelligence 
Administration. 
  During the talks between a government delegation and the 
opposition that were held in the first half of April in Moscow 
an oral agreement was reached that both sides should refrain 
from disseminating propaganda. Apparently, the Tajikistan 
Foreign Ministry information department has not acceded to the 
accord.

<F P=106> [Report by ITAR-TASS diplomatic correspondent Sergey Oleynik] </F>
  [Text] Moscow, 28 Apr -- "I would describe the current 
state of Russian-Irish relations as excellent," said Irish 
Deputy Prime Minister of Foreign Affairs Dick Spring, in an 
interview with an ITAR-TASS correspondent. Spring is in Moscow 
on an official visit. 
  "I expect to see progress in two directions as a result of 
the present visit: on the political front and in the economy," 
Spring stressed. "For the first, a broad range of international 
problems -- among them, reform of the UN, disarmament, 
nonproliferation of nuclear weapons, and the latest events in 
Russia and the region -- are to be discussed at tomorrow's 
meeting with Russian Foreign Minister Andrey Kozyrev. On many 
of these issues, our positions are very close and we hope to 
strengthen the mutual understanding we have achieved and to map 
out prospects for future work." 
  One important practical result of the visit should be the 
conclusion of a bilateral agreement on avoiding double taxation. 
"Today, I had meetings with representatives of Irish business 
circles in Moscow," Spring said, "and all of them drew my 
attention to the importance of adopting a document of this kind. 
  "Generally speaking, we are very proud of the successes of 
Irish business in your country," Spring emphasized, "and are 
doing everything we can through diplomatic channels to assist 
it." Muscovites are well aware of Irish company Aer Rianta's 
joint ventures -- the Irish House on Arbat Street and the Duty 
Free shops at Sheremetyevo II and in a number of the capital's 
hotels. Other Irish companies are following Aer Rianta's lead. 
I note the expansion of the Garden Ring supermarket chain in 
Moscow. 
  Ireland is also involved in projects to develop Russian 
management and rebuild the food sector, the municipal economy, 
and the services sector, including those being implemented 
within the European Union's programs. "But the main thing is 
that Irish businessmen are optimistic and are ready to expand 
their activities in Russia. I share their optimism," the deputy 
prime minister concluded.

  [Text] Moscow, 28 Apr -- The visit to Russia by Finnish 
Foreign Minister Heikki Haavisto planned for 30 April is being 
postponed, Grigoriy Karasin, the director of the Information and 
Press Department of the Russian Foreign Ministry, stated at a 
briefing today. 
  He noted that Haavisto's visit had been postponed at the 
request of the Russian side and the request was properly agreed 
with the leadership of the Finnish Ministry of Foreign Affairs. 
"This postponement is purely technical and has no political 
overtones. It is simply a matter of foreign minister Andrey 
Kozyrev's `timetable'," Karasin said.

<F P=106> [Commentary by Aleksey Pushkov, MOSKOVSKIYE NOVOSTI deputy </F>
editor in chief, under the "In the World" rubric: "The 
Arrogance of Strength and the Presumption of Weakness"] 
  [Text] A tide of anti-Americanism is swelling in Russia. 
According to a long Russian tradition, the sobering with regard 
to the United States is beginning to boil over. Now it is not 
only Zhirinovskiy's supporters, but those who have fairly 
recently been moderate intellectuals that accuse the United 
States of planning to "exterminate the friendly Serb people" and 
of harboring intentions to impose a new "Pax Americana," and 
urge Russia to fence off NATO so as to counter the bloc with "an 
independent center of strength" in the form of the CIS. 
  These sentiments have not seriously affected Russia's 
official policies so far. Moscow's recent departure from its 
initial stance of unquestionably following in Washington's steps 
rather reflects its desire to balance relations with the United 
States. Still, it was not without heeding these sentiments that 
Moscow recently put off indefinitely its accession to the 
"Partnership for Peace" program, and it reminds the Americans on 
every occasion that "Russia is a great power;" and Andrey 
Kozyrev keeps talking, insistently so, about Russian plans 
"aggressively to defend its interests," thus awakening 
reminiscences in the West about Cold War terminology. 
  Of course, Russia currently lacks either the strength, 
capabilities, or even the desire to set itself against America. 
The goings-on, however, are fairly dangerous. Under certain 
conditions, Russia's desperate -- but still unsuccessful -- 
search for its role on the world scene instead of the one it has 
lost may result in the return to a fairly familiar, nearly 
genetic anti-Americanism. In this case it will be more show 
than real, more posturing than policy, but even this posture can 
do great damage to Russian interests. 
  All the more so because a counter-tide is mounting in the 
United States itself. It has not given rise to anti-Russian 
actions yet, but the shagreen leather of restraint is shrinking 
fast. Passages about "Russia's neoimperial ambitions" have 
already become a commonplace in the statements of U.S. 
high-ranking officials. The fact that the United States is 
providing Russia with moderate financial assistance gives the 
Americans additional reasons constantly to remind it that as of 
today the United States is the sole superpower in the world. 
And also to give Moscow instructions as to what deals it may 
conclude with India or Iran, how it should behave itself in the 
Middle East or in its disputes with the Baltic states. 
  "There should be no anti-Americanism, but neither should 
there be pan-Americanism," believes a high-ranking official of 
the Yeltsin administration, who appears to be expressing the 
general viewpoint of our government bureaucracy. This is an 
understandable wish, albeit one that can scarcely be fulfilled 
completely: Any powerful system -- and the United States is 
precisely one -- seeks to become a monopoly. Still, this should 
not give rise to yet another surge of anti-Americanism, but 
serve as a reason to work out a counterpolicy that would make it 
possible to maintain constructive relations with the United 
States and at the same time enable Russia to defend its 
legitimate interests. 
  This symbiosis is realistic for two reasons: First, the 
United States -- as shown by its failures in Somalia and Haiti, 
not too strong positions in trade wars with Japan, and 
continuous overtures to China despite Beijing's human rights 
violations of all possible sorts -- is far from omnipotent. 
Second, it needs Russia for objective reasons -- insofar as it 
uses, not rejects, Russia's remaining possibilities to influence 
international processes. 
  The evolution of the situation around Bosnia is a case in 
point. If President Clinton were certain that the strategy of 
bomb strikes is bound to succeed, he would not have called Boris 
Yeltsin on the phone last week, nor would Warren Christopher 
have met with Andrey Kozyrev in Geneva. The course events took 
after Russia's diplomatic defeat in Gorazde only emphasized that 
it is still one of the key players on the Balkan scene against 
which both the United States and NATO prefer to measure their 
actions. 
  The West needs Russia to an even greater degree to control 
the course of events on the territory of the former USSR. 
Although in the United States scenarios of playing "the 
Ukrainian card" are being contemplated with a determination 
worthy of a better purpose, in reality the United States is 
unable actually to oppose Russia in that space. 
  Anti-Americanism is flawed at least because it attributes to 
the United States the possibilities it does not have. Moreover, 
there is no better way of giving a strong boost to 
anti-Americanism than to project the image of a Russia hostile 
to the United States and the West. On the contrary, it should 
act accurately and carefully as it takes part in numerous 
international games -- from the Bosnian one to the partnership 
with NATO -- and prudently use its influence on a case-by-case 
basis either on the American side or in favor of emerging 
alternatives. 
  Neither pro-Americanism, which is fraught with its unbridled 
antithesis in Russia, nor anti-Americanism, which is rolling our 
country back to what is has left behind with such difficulties 
are acceptable for it. Russia should stop measuring itself 
against this leading, but not omnipotent pole of world politics. 
Only by so doing will it be able to overcome its historical 
inferiority complex with regard to the United States, to come to 
the balanced realization of its national interests, and to help 
diffuse the American influence if and when it runs counter to 
its needs.

<F P=106> [Report by Vladimir Mikheyev: "Duma Deputies Assess Lessons </F>
of Gorazde on the Spot"] 
  [Text] The crisis in Bosnia abated slightly after the 
Bosnian Serbs had fulfilled the UN and NATO ultimatum, and 
withdrawn their heavy armaments from the 20-km "safe area" 
around Gorazde. 
  Two soldiers from the Russian "blue helmets" battalion had 
been taken as hostages, but they were released the next morning. 
The warring and interested parties are in a state of some 
confusion. The "lessons of Gorazde" are still being assessed, 
and this they are doing in the State Duma. 
  The flames could have been extinguished before the bomb 
attacks, Vladimir Lukin, chairman of the Duma International 
Affairs Committee, believes. Before the Bosnian Serbs were 
"forced to show they were not afraid" in response to the 
"deterrence strategy." 
  The latest spiral in the crisis in Bosnia, Lukin believes, 
demonstrated the "ineptitude" of the U.S. Administration, which 
is linking bombing raids in former Yugoslavia to the domestic 
political situation at home, the fact that the West Europeans 
are "easily persuaded," since they opted for a "diplomatic 
facade rather than political decisions," and also the "weakness 
and incoherence of Russian diplomacy." 
  The deputy paid tribute to the flexibility of the West, 
which 
had "given the Serbs a way out," and to Boris Yeltsin's timely 
intervention, which was carried out not through "Russian 
diplomats in the field," but directly, although "within the 
framework of nonpublic diplomacy." 
  Although the departure of the president's special envoy from 
the trouble spot was seen as a positive contribution, Moscow's 
actual participation in the efforts to unravel the Balkan knot 
of tension was not called into question. Bosnia has 
demonstrated, though, that neither the West nor Russia "will be 
able to handle it alone." 
  There was criticism in the Duma of the Clinton 
administration, which is following ideologized precepts: The 
Serbs are an enemy who must be punished, but U.S. soldiers must 
not die and the U.S. taxpayer must not bear the extra cost. 
Lukin, Russian ambassador in Washington, observed: "The 
methods of indoctrination employed in the United States often 
remind me of the methods used in North Korea." 
  The head of the parliamentary committee suggested that 
Russian shuttle diplomacy should not be so closely linked to the 
"personal factor," so that "people like me do not begin to 
suspect that ambition plays too great a part in it." "Personal 
resentment and disappointment" must not be allowed to come into 
it, a diplomat must not lose his cool," Vladimir Lukin said, 
although he did not once mention the name of Vitaliy Churkin. 
You might say the gist of the speech was that you have to "play 
as a team." 
  The Duma delegation, made up on a factional basis, which 
toured the republics of former Yugoslavia, showed how to play as 
a team. 
  In a statement for ITAR-TASS in Belgrade, Duma Deputy 
Konstantin Zatulin expressed regret that "mature diplomats 
preferred vexation to patience," by echoing the "rhetoric on the 
benefit of ultimatums." Delegation head Nikolay Bezborodov 
expressed his colleagues' view that the Duma must raise the 
question of lifting sanctions against the Serb Republic of 
Yugoslavia and pass it to the United Nations for a final 
decision. 
  It is believed that, before ending up on the president's 
desk, the Duma's recommendations will absorb two traditional 
elements from the diplomatic arsenal -- "pressure and 
encouragement"; the latter will incorporate a proposal on a 
stage-by-stage lifting of sanctions.

  [Text] Sofia April 28 TASS -- "We had meetings with 
representatives of all sides involved in the Bosnian conflict 
and, judging by their stands, now it is difficult to expect any 
definite solution to the dramatic situation", Deputy Chairman of 
the Duma's Defence Committee, Head of the Russian State Duma 
delegation Nikolay Bezborodov told in an interview with 
ITAR-TASS. The delegation made a brief stopover in the 
Bulgarian capital on its way from Belgrade to Moscow. 
  According to Bezborodov, "a way out" might be found at a 
summit meeting between representatives of the international 
community, the possibility of which is now being discussed. 
However, such a meeting must not be reduced to "dictate from 
the position of force", he said. 
  Commenting on mass media reports on manifistations of "great 
Serbian chauvinism", Bezborodov said that such reports are often 
of a propagandist character. "We have seen no such 
manifistations", he said. On the contrary, we can speak of 
biased coverage of the situation in former Yugoslavia, when all 
the blame is put on one side only, the lawmaker stressed. Other 
deputies also share this point of view saying it is necessary to 
assess the situation in former Yugoslavia on the basis of a just 
and objective approach. 
  The Russian lawmakers believe that now another problem is 
becoming more acute, i.e. lifting of U.N. sanctions against 
the Republic of Yugoslavia which affect not only Yugoslavia but 
other Balkan countries as well.

<F P=106> [Report by Mikhail Lashch: "New `Greenpeace' Action. </F>
Finnish Police Break Up Antinuclear Action"] 
  [Excerpts] The international ecological organization 
"Greenpeace" held a protest action yesterday in the Finnish town 
of Loviza (110 km from Helsinki) in connection with the 
impending transporting to Russia of nuclear waste. The same day 
the Moscow branch of "Greenpeace" circulated a statement on the 
illegal nature of transporting nuclear waste from Finland to 
Russia. [passage omitted] 
  Talking to your KOMMERSANT-DAILY correspondent, Dmitriy 
Tolmatskiy of the Moscow branch of "Greenpeace" clarified some 
of the questions on bringing nuclear fuel to Russia. "The 
agreement on cooperation in the area of nuclear power 
engineering of 14 May 1965 between Russia and Finland contains 
not one word to the effect that the radioactive waste of 
processed fuel is supposed to be buried in Russia. The thing is 
that nuclear fuel becomes totally Finland's property the moment 
it crosses the border, and Russia bears no responsibility 
whatever for it. More, commitments on the return of fuel are 
not stipulated in the agreement." Mr. Tolmatskiy also 
underlined that literally every page in the agreement says that 
nuclear materials may only be used for peaceful means whereas 
the "Mayak" combine (the biggest nuclear waste processing 
enterprise) is a military facility, which, up to now, has been 
producing weapons-grade plutonium from used nuclear fuel.

<F P=106> [From the "Diplomatic Panorama" feature: Reports by </F>
Diplomatic Correspondents Igor Porshnev, Vitaly Trubetskoi and 
others] 
  [Text] Russia "resolutely condemns the senseless subversive 
activity of those, who seek to cast shadow on the elections to 
the first non-racial parliament in South Africa," said the 
Foreign Ministry spokesman, Grigory Karasin, at Thursday's [28 
April] briefing in Moscow. 
  As he said, the reports arriving from South Africa "make it 
possible to hope that the elections to be concluded on Thursday 
will be a success." However the forces, which tried in vain to 
derail the negotiating process, are still resorting to 
sabotage," Karasin said. 
  The recent terrorist act -- bomb explosion in Johannesburg's 
airport -- injured 16 people, including two Russian diplomats. 
  "We believe that such actions will not break the will of the 
majority of South Africans, who voted for a democratic future 
and for a prosperous South Africa," the spokesman for Russia's 
Foreign Ministry concluded.

<F P=106> [Report by Yuriy Leshkevich: "Belarus `Cleans Up' </F>
Legislation"] 
  [Excerpt] [passage omitted] During its session yesterday, 
the Belarusian Supreme Soviet also adopted a number of 
resolutions which bring Belarusian legislation in line with that 
of Russia, as is required by provisions of the monetary merger 
agreement between the two states. In particular, the law "On 
Export and Import Tax" was abolished; from 1 May 1994 to 1 
January 1996 (until the expiration of Russia's customs tariff on 
exports), a temporary customs tariff is being introduced. 
Changes were also introduced to legislative acts concerning 
taxation. In the first place, they concern tax policy toward 
facilities used by Russian strategic troops deployed on 
Belarusian soil.

<F P=106> [Report by Mikhail Rudkowski] </F>
  [Excerpts] Today, at the beginning of the Supreme Soviet 
session, secret voting for candidates to the Constitutional 
Court was held. The candidacies were put forward at the evening 
plenary session yesterday. Ten were listed. After the speeches 
in the traditional miscellaneous section on the agenda, people's 
deputies conducted the secret voting, electing the following 
members of the Constitutional Court of the Republic of Belarus: 
Vasilevich, Padhrusha, Pastukhow, Serada, Fadzeyew, Filipchyk, 
Khoma, Tsikhinya, and Tsishkevich. Immediately, in the session 
hall, the newly elected judges were sworn in. [passage omitted 
including the act of swearing and speaker's congratulations] 
  We, the journalists, add our congratulations to all those 
voiced in the session hall. I congratulate Valeryy Ryhoryevich 
Tsikhinya: Valeryy Ryhoryevich, please accept my warmest 
congratulations on your election to the Constitutional Court. 
  [Begin recording] [Tsikhinya in Russian] Thank you for your 
congratulations. I feel that the Supreme Soviet has done me a 
great honor today. I will try to justify the Supreme Soviet's 
trust. 
  [Rudkowski] With what will the Constitutional Court begin 
its work? 
  [Tsikhinya] First of all, we have to implement the adopted 
law on the Constitutional Court by working out a statute of the 
Constitutional Court. We have no right to begin our work 
without this statute. Therefore, a month after electing the 
Constitutional Court -- and it was elected today in its 
competent body -- we have to work out and adopt the statute of 
Constitutional Court proceedings as well as to resolve all other 
questions stemming from the law on the Constitutional Court. 
  [Rudkowski] As is known, the chairman of the Constitutional 
Court will be elected by our president [pauses]. 
  [Tsikhinya] I cannot fully agree with you. Why? Because 
the chairman of the Constitutional Court is elected not by the 
president, but by the Supreme Soviet at the president's 
recommendation. That is, the president may propose a chairman 
from this body of judges, or propose a new candidate for the 
Supreme Soviet to elect him or her as head of the Constitutional 
Court. 
  [Rudkowski] We know what the fate was of Russia's 
Constitutional Court. There were very difficult political 
moments there. Can the same situation take place in Belarus? 
  [Tsikhinya] Prognosticating is a very hard task. 
Nonetheless, I will say that we are not going to play politics, 
because political issues should be resolved by political means, 
while juridical ones should be resolved with the help of the 
law. Therefore, beginning today, I suspend my membership in the 
Party of Communists of Belarus and do not intend to join any 
social organizations which pursue political goals. This is 
demanded by the law on the Constitutional Court. My only 
superior will be the Constitution of the Republic of Belarus in 
force in 1994. 
  [Rudkowski] God bless you. I wish you every success. 
  [Tsikhinya] Thank you. [end recording] 
  This way the extraordinary -- 14th -- Supreme Soviet session 
closed its work.

  [Text] Today, a number of Belarusian newspapers have 
published an open letter to the readers signed by the chief 
editors of such leading Belarusian newspapers as NARODNAYA 
GAZETA, ZVYAZDA, and SOVETSKAYA BELORUSSIYA. "The Belarusian 
press is on the brink of disaster," the letter reads. 
"Expenditures for publishing a large-circulation newspaper 
amount to 1 billion [not further specified] a week. Funds 
coming from subscription fees will be enough for the next few 
days. ...Neither advertisement nor other forms of commercial 
operations, with which editorial boards have been forced to 
deal, will ensure further existence of the press." Beginning 29 
April, as the letter points out, publication of newspapers will 
be halted, except for the 1 and 9 May issues which will be 
devoted to Victory Day. "Although this is not a strike," the 
authors note, "there are grounds to hold one. ...The editorial 
boards are ready to resume publishing as soon as a solution to 
the current deadlock is found."

  [Text] Chisinau BASAPRESS, 26/4/1994 -- The military 
delegation of the Republic of Moldova, which had been invited to 
today's reunion of the heads of major general staffs of NATO 
countries and partner states, did not leave for Brussels, 
announced to BASA informed sources from the Minister of Defence 
(MD) from Chisinau. Anatol Cosciug, the chief of the military 
policy and treaties section of the MD of Moldova, said that the 
fact that the Moldovan delegation did not attend the reunion in 
Brussels is not connected with the refusal of Russia to sign the 
"Partnership for Peace" NATO program. Cosciug, excluding any 
political aspect, indicated that the Embassy of Belgium in 
Moscow didn't manage to issue the necessary visas. The Moldovan 
delegation was to be headed by Pavel Chirau, the chief of the 
General Staff of the Military Forces of Moldova.

  [Text] Chisinau BASAPRESS, 26/4/1994 -- Yesterday the 
ambassador of the Republic of Moldova in Moscow, Anatol Taran, 
submitted his resignation. Taran declared to BASA that until 
President Mircea Snegur signs the order accepting his 
resignation, diplomatic ethics do not allow him to present 
details concerning the reasons of his request. Asked if he was 
sure that Snegur will accept his resignation, Taran said it was 
highly probable; in case of rejection he intends to insist upon 
acceptance. According to Taran, after the Easter holidays, 
during which he intends to visit to take his leave of the 
president, government and colleagues from the diplomatic corps 
accredited in the Russian Federation; he will then return to 
Chisinau. Informed sources from Chisinau announced to BASA that 
a possible candidate for the resigned post would be Grigore 
Eremei, current ambassador of the Republic of Moldova in Minsk.

ambassador to Moldova, Faruq Mustafa `Ali, with permanent 
residence in Bucharest presented his credentials to President 
Mircea Snegur, states the presidential press service communique. 
The Sudan diplomat stated during the meeting that the people he 
represents respect the Moldovan people's choice expressed on 
February 27th. He called this "a choice to erect a democratic, 
independent and sovereign state." Snegur pointed out that 
Moldova has overcome a series of difficulties inherent in the 
transition to a market economy, mentioning the stability of the 
national currency and reduction of inflation. According to 
Snegur, Moldova's foreign policy will be founded on certain laws 
that will be examined and adopted in the near future. He said 
that "the present Parliament that has a majority faction 
displays constructivity in its activity. It is very likely to 
eliminate the conflicts in Eastern and Southern Moldova," said 
Snegur. Both Snegur and Faruq Mustafa `Ali pointed out that the 
economic relations between the two states can be developed, 
particularly in agriculture.

  [Text] A border demarcation agreement between Kazakhstan 
and China crowns their bilateral ties, Kazakh President 
Nursultan Nazarbayev declared at farewell ceremony for the 
Chinese Premier Li Peng in Alma Ata [Almaty] Thursday [28 April]. 
  "Not a single former USSR state, including Russia, has 
legally demarcated frontiers with China," Nazarbayev stressed. 
  In his opinion, the bilateral accords on transport give 
Kazakhstan access to all Chinese provinces and to Central Asia. 
He spoke highly of his talks with Li Peng on global issues, on 
the situation in CIS, and on Kazakh-Chinese relations. 
  He called fruitful the exchange of reform-making experience, 
which has, as he put it, an Asian flavor. Nazarbayev was 
pleased with Li Peng's support of his initiatives to build up 
trust and set up a common market in Asia.

  [Text] Some very interesting facts were made public today 
in Moscow's Artillery and Missile Forces Academy. A film crew 
from the Segodnya program were the only journalists present. 
  [Correspondent Ivliyev] The nuclear strategic missiles based 
in Kazakhstan belong to Russia -- this is the sensational news 
reported today by the Colonel General Igor Sergeyev, commander 
in chief of strategic missile forces, at a briefing for foreign 
military attaches, which took place in the Dzerzhinskiy Military 
Academy. 
  [Begin Sergeyev recording] A month ago, on 28 March, an 
agreement was reached during the Russian-Kazakhstan talks on 
giving Russian status to the formations and units of strategic 
missile forces stationed temporarily on Kazakhstan territory. A 
timescale was also agreed for the withdrawal of nuclear warheads 
to Russian territory. [end recording] 
  [Ivliyev] The agreement reached means that the personnel of 
the missile forces receive Russian citizenship. After the stage 
by stage withdrawal of missile force units from Kazakhstan is 
completed, the launch shafts will be dismantled, apparently by 
Russian specialists. Thus, all three CIS states -- Ukraine, 
Belarus, and Kazakhstan -- on whose territory nuclear weaponry 
remained after the collapse of the USSR, now have a treaty with 
Russia on its removal. In a few years, if these countries 
fulfill their obligations, Igor Sergeyev stressed, they will 
become non-nuclear states.

  [Text] Alma-Ata [Almaty] 29 April TASS -- "We shall march 
together. There is no other alternative," said Kazakh Defence 
Minister Sagadat Nurmagambetov here on Friday, commenting on the 
treaty on military cooperation and some other agreements on 
military affairs, which were recently signed by the Russian and 
Kazakh presidents. 
  He made this statement, speaking before servicemen of a 
guards garrison and the Alma-Ata Higher Army School. 
  Reporting this event in its latest issue, the Kazakhstan 
SARBAZY (KAZAKH SERVICEMAN) newspaper quotes the words by the 
defence minister on the future of the armed forces of his 
republic and the Commonwealth of Independent States. 
  "There was the Soviet Union. There is the Commonwealth of 
Independent States now," he said, adding that not a single state 
of the former union can exist independently. "Therefore," the 
minister stressed, "our president has repeatedly advocated 
political consolidation and economic integration."

<F P=106> [From the "Itogi" newscast: Video report from Kazakhstan by </F>
Aleksandr Gerasimov] 
  [Text] [Gerasimov] "Zone of consequences of the politics 
of the absurd" -- this is probably the most apt description of 
the stationing locations of Strategic Missile Forces units in 
Kazakhstan. This is the fourth year since the disintegration of 
the Soviet Union, and the leaders of the nuclear republics have 
still not reached agreement on the division of nuclear weapons. 
These weapons, used as a deterrent until recently, are being 
turned into an instrument of political blackmail. Those who 
stand to lose from this are our own security, and the thousands 
of servicemen serving in the missile forces. 
  Formally, anything located on Kazakhstani territory belongs 
to Kazakhstan. At the same time, Alma-Ata [Almaty] has acceded 
to the offensive arms reduction treaty and does not regard 
itself as the owner of nuclear missiles. However, as a result 
of the cooling of relations between Kazakhstan and Russia, which 
followed the rejection of Nazarbayev's concept of the ruble 
zone, nobody is currently able to clearly define the nuclear 
weapons' status. 
  The nuclear weapons concerned are 104 of the world's most 
powerful strategic missiles -- the SS-18 -- deployed in two 
divisions on the territory of Kazakhstan. The prevailing view 
is that these are Russian divisions. However, unlike in other 
armies, no state flag is flying above the headquarters. 
Admittedly, the main orders and the wages come from Moscow. 
Both the officers who have sworn allegiance to Russia, and the 
men who have taken the Kazakhstani oath and whose knowledge of 
Russian is poor, but who serve under Russian service 
regulations, are being paid in Russian rubles. 
  [Unidentified Russian officer addressing servicemen] No. 12 
Platoon don gas masks! 
  [Gerasimov] At the same time, Alma-Ata is also issuing 
menacing orders. Their implementation has resulted in the 
accumulation at nuclear bases of an impermissibly large number 
of warheads which have come to the end of their guaranteed 
service life. 
  [Akhmet Khashchegulgov, missile division commander] The 
accumulation of nuclear warheads in the missile division is in 
excess of the set norms. This is primarily the result of a 
decision by the leadership of the Republic of Kazakhstan banning 
the removal of nuclear warheads, missiles, missile fuel 
components, and other types of hardware from the territory of 
Kazakhstan. 
  [Gerasimov] According to our information from the Russian 
Government, the explanation for this stance adopted by Alma-Ata 
is President Nazarbayev's intention during his upcoming visit to 
Moscow to demand compensation for the highly enriched uranium 
contained in nuclear charges. In addition, strategic missiles 
offer a good bargaining chip in the political horse-trading 
between the two states whose relations are far from 
straightforward. 
  Officers here take the view that nuclear safety can be 
guaranteed only if their divisions are given the status of 
Russian military bases. For some reason, they believe here that 
this will be resolved during the upcoming meeting between 
Yeltsin and Nazarbayev. 
  Perhaps when this meeting has taken place, the local 
Kazakhstani authorities will stop cutting off the electricity 
and water supply to the military garrisons. In that case 
officers' children will no longer have to freeze in schools and 
kindergartens, and the officers on duty will no longer have to 
struggle to maintain the survivability of the nuclear missiles. 
Commanders will be able to find the money needed to repair heat 
supply networks, and the pipes for this work will no longer have 
to be flown in from Moscow. 
  To Senior Lieutenant Mikhail Kryukov and Major Vasiliy 
Salashnov, who are on alert duty deep down under ground, empty 
shelves in the garrison's stores are nothing new. Just like 
their comrades, they are constantly ready to implement orders. 
Nonetheless, most of the officers are dreaming about returning 
to Russia where conditions of service are more comfortable. 
Many of them remain in Kazakhstan only because of speedier 
promotion and because 12 months of service counts for 18 months 
here. 
  Meanwhile, certain circumstances seem to indicate that 
Kazakhstan's leadership is not really seeking to improve 
relations with Russia. So, for example, a strategic 
installation -- a Kazakhstani air defense unit located near the 
missile division at Derzhavinsk -- is completely snowed under. 
When the Kazakhstani air defense troops were still Soviet 
troops they protected the nuclear missiles from air attacks. 
Now the station is deserted. 
  A Kazakhstani-U.S. joint venture for extracting high-grade 
metals from missile silos, which are being taken out of service, 
is being set up in Alma-Ata. It appears that the Kazakhstanis 
trust Moscow less and less. The Russian authorities, in turn, 
are taking no steps toward a rapprochement with Kazakhstan.

<F P=106> [Report by ITAR-TASS special correspondents Lyudmila </F>
Glazovskaya and Mikhail Kalmykov] 
  [Text] Ashkhabad [Ashgabat] 28 April TASS -- Continuing his 
state visit to Turkmenistan, French President Francois 
Mitterrand said today that possessing huge oil and gas deposits, 
Turkmnistan can maintain a strong position during talks with 
French industrialists. 
  The topic concerning prospects of French-Turkmen business 
cooperation in different spheres was raised during talks between 
Francois Mitterrand and Turkmen leader Saparmurad Niyazov, as 
well as at meetings of economists from both countries. 
  A large group of French industrialists, including 
representatives from such internationally established firms and 
banks as "Gas de France," "Thomson," and "Credit Commercial de 
France" are also accompanying the French head of state. They 
are not making a secret of their interest in joining large top 
priority economic projects, which are being worked out by the 
Turkmen Government, in their possibly early stage. 
  In turn, Turkmenistan, which strives to join world leaders 
on 
the international oil and gas market, sees in enhancing 
cooperation with French enterprises an opportunity to modernize 
the technical basis of this leading branch of its national 
economy, and expedite the realization of the multi-billion gas 
pipeline laying project which will supply Turkmen gas to Europe. 
  Such French industrial giants as "Elf Aquitaine," 
"Bouygues," 
and "Thomson" have already stuck firm roots in Turkmenistan. 
Besides this, great hopes are being laid on French assistance 
in the creation and development of modern infrastructure for 
transport, modern communications and banking services. 
  Judging by all accounts, these hopes have a good base. 
France, according to Francois Mitterrand, is already prepared 
to earmark over 220 million francs as credits for these 
purposes. A number of economic agreements, which, according to 
Saparmurad Niyazov, must "provide a new impulse to the 
Turkmen-French development," are planned to be signed at the end 
of the talks today.

  [Text] Ashkhabad [Ashgabat], 28 Apr -- All influential 
forces concerned about the Bosnian crisis -- the United States, 
Russia, the European Union, and the United Nations -- should 
work together to propose a general plan for a peaceful 
settlement to the conflicting sides, Alain Lamassoure, the 
French minister delegate for European affairs, said here today. 
Answering a question from an ITAR-TASS correspondent on the 
prospects for a Bosnian settlement, he expressed satisfaction 
with the fact that a kind of contact group has already been set 
up at the level of experts. "France is in favor of convening a 
meeting of representatives of the European Union, Russia, and 
the United States with the participation of the United Nations." 
Such a course should enable progress to be made in the search 
for ways to a peaceful settlement in Bosnia, he believes. 
  Some aspects of the Bosnian crisis were touched upon at 
talks 
between official delegations and expert groups from France and 
Turkmenistan within the framework of Francois Mitterrand's 
working visit to Ashkhabad, which ended today. The French side 
set out its approach to the Bosnia problem and expressed regret 
in connection with the fact that Foreign Minister Alain Juppe 
had not come to Turkmenistan. He was unable to leave Europe 
because French diplomacy is currently undertaking active efforts 
in the Bosnian sphere.

<F P=106> [Report by ITAR-TASS correspondents Lyudmila Glazovskaya and </F>
Mikhail Kalmykov] 
  [Text] Ashkhabad 29 April TASS -- The central event of the 
French President Francois Mitterand's visit to Turkmenistan was 
a treaty on friendship and cooperation between the two countries 
signed on Thursday evening, the treaty laid the foundation to 
further development of Russo-Turkmen contacts. 
  Besides, intergovernment agreements on cooperation in mutual 
protection of investments and cultural exchange were signed 
between foreign ministries of the two countries. A document on 
preventing double taxation was coordinated by the two sides as 
well. 
  During the talks the sides discussed a wide range of 
problems, paying particular attention to the situation in the 
Central Asian region and primarily, in Tajikistan and 
Afghanistan. 
  Turkmen officials have reiterated their position of 
non-interference into regional conflicts. They believe that the 
Afghan and the Tajik people can decide their fates themselves. 
The Turkmen side believes that Tajikistan needs national accord 
and consolidation. Any attempt to impose any variant from the 
outside might worsen the situation, said Boris Shikhmuradov, 
vice-premier of the Turkmen government in an interview with 
ITAR-TASS. 
  "We do not join coalition forces for the maintenance of 
peace 
in Tajikistan. We proceed from the assumption that there is no 
external enemy there," Shikhmuradov said. "Present clashes on 
the Tajik-Afghan border is not the cause, but rather the 
consequence of internal instability in Tajikistan," the Turkmen 
vice-premier said, adding that the Tajik point of view was 
brought to the notice of the French side. 
  France expressed satisfaction over the fact that despite a 
difficult situation in the vicinity of its borders Turkmenistan 
managed to preserve a certain balance of interests, a balance of 
forces. France looks upon stable Turkmenistan as a 
peace-keeping factor in the region. 
  For its part, Turkmenistan regards the French president's 
visit as a sign that the country is prepared to make its 
contribution to regional peace-keeping activities. 
  During the talks the sides discussed joint economic projects 
in spheres of priority importance for Tajikistan, including the 
development and transportation of oil and gas. Turkmenistan 
believes that having won the financial and technological support 
of French companies, it will soon turn into one of the leaders 
of the world energy exports. 
  The completion of the central Asian tour made by the French 
president heralds doubtless success of the Uzbek and French 
diplomacy. It was announced in Ashgabat that France would soon 
open its permanent diplomatic mission there which was 
persistently requested by the Turkmen leader.

<F P=106> ["Own Information" report: "Dialogue Which Helps </F>
Friendship"] 
  [Excerpts] A meeting of leaders of the leading Russian 
mass media and Turkmenistan President Saparmurad Niyazov took 
place in Ashkhabad [Ashgabat] recently after the former had come 
to the republic at his invitation. Such meetings with leaders 
of CIS countries have already become a good tradition. 
  A central place in the program for the Moscow guests' stay 
on 
Turkmen soil was taken up by a "roundtable" talk with the head 
of state. [passage omitted] 
  The SELSKAYA ZHIZN representative was interested primarily 
in 
the agrarian reform which is being conducted in Turkmenistan. 
  "Our policy, known as `the New Countryside,'" the president 
noted, "is of a balanced and gradual nature as regards changes 
in the agricultural sector. It proposes a diversity of forms of 
ownership and economic management of the land. Strong, 
flourishing collective and state farms will undoubtedly be 
retained. Unprofitable farms and farms operating in the red will 
be transformed into peasant and private farms and various 
associations of landowners. Some 150,000 hectares of land have 
been distributed for private ownership in the country. Every 
family has the right to 50 hectares. State support is being 
rendered to the development of the agro-industrial complex." 
  The task of overcoming grain dependence on the foreign 
market 
is being resolved as a priority. The grain purchased from CIS 
countries is costing Turkmenistan very dear. That is why the 
aim of achieving self-sufficiency with regard to grain has been 
set. Areas sown to wheat are being expanded and this year 1 
million tonnes of grain will be obtained. As of 1997, the 
Republic intends to switch to the population's free provision 
with bread. According to calculations, 164 kg of flour is 
needed per inhabitant. 
  The talk, which lasted over two hours, was of a relaxed and 
congenial nature.

  [Text] Yerevan April 29 TASS -- A ceasefire in the zone of 
the Karabakh conflict is not observed, ITAR-TASS learnt here on 
Friday from Manvel Sarkisyan, adviser of the Nagorno-Karabakh 
foreign minister. 
  He noted that the Karabakh side agreed on Thursday [28 
April] 
to cease fire during the last night, provided the mediator -- 
the Russian Federation -- receives a similar reply from the 
opposing side -- Azerbaijan. 
  In the meantime, there was no confirmation of such a reply, 
Sarkisyan said. Besides, the diplomat stressed, the Azeri side 
massed combat materiel and weapons near the north-eastern border 
of Nagorno-Karabakh and was regularly shelling the Mardakertskiy 
district from artillery during the last night and this morning. 
  Despite the cloudy weather, the situation is very tense at 
that section of the front, noted the adviser representing his 
ministry in Armenia.

until late at night, Azerbaijani units periodically shelled the 
Armenian border villages of Vagan in Krasnoselskiy rayon, 
Chinari in Taushskiy rayon, and Sevkar and Berkaber in 
Idzhevanskiy rayon using all types of weapons. The ITAR-TASS

from the territory of the Nakhichevan Autonomous Republic. 
  In all cases, the Armenian side did not return fire and 
there 
were no casualties, the Armenian Ministry of Defense stressed.

  [Text] [no dateline as received] "AZATAMART" weekly 
published an interview with the Chairman of the State Committee 
on defence of the Republic of Nagorno-Karabakh Robert Kocharyan. 
  In Karabakh leader's opinion, one of the obstacles hindering 
the settlement of the conflict is the existence of two parallel 
initiatives - CSCE's and Russia's - which gives the sides an 
opportunity to maneuver. Kocharyan also noted that before 
December 1993 there had been contacts with Azerbaijan on the 
highest level. However, after the beginning of the latest 
Azerbaijani offensive, the official Baku broke up those contacts. 
  During that two-month large-scale offensive the mediators, 
in 
Kocharyan's words, made no efforts to influence the attacking 
side. Instead, they patiently waited for the results of military 
actions. 
  Touching upon Turkey's and England's position, the Karabakh 
leader noted, "The attitude of those countries towards Karabakh 
was obvious since the very first days of the conflict. As to 
the oil agreements with Azerbaijan, they will only prolong 
confrontation". When asked what kind of future he sees for 
Karabakh, Kocharyan answered, "Autonomy with the widest range of 
rights within a united Armenian state".

<F P=106> [Interview with Ukrainian Ambassador to Austria Yuriy </F>
Kostenko by Lidiya Yakovenko in Vienna; date not given: "When 
Russian Envoy Begins To Reprimand an Estonian, Latvian, or 
Lithuanian, I Feel I Have To Counter This..."] 
  [Excerpts] 
  [Yakovenko] Yuriy Vasylovych, you represent our 
country not simply in the capital of a European state. Vienna, 
as everybody knows, is also the center of international 
diplomacy. A UN mission and other influential international 
organizations are located here. This is a very important spot 
to Ukraine. How has the work of the Ukrainian diplomatic corps 
been developing, and what has already been achieved? 
  [Kostenko] Yes, you are right. Vienna is of particular 
importance to Ukraine, simply because the Ukrainian diplomatic 
representation in international organizations has been located 
here for 10 years. Thus, after the declaration of independence, 
the development of diplomatic structures in Vienna was quite 
different than in capitals of other countries. We had to 
transform our representation into an embassy smoothly and 
quietly. This was not an easy task, since Ukraine had virtually 
been oriented toward multilateral diplomacy until 1992. 
Bilateral diplomacy had always been Moscow's prerogative. We 
did not have skilled cadres. For instance, we did not have 
enough German speaking specialists. On the other hand however, 
we had a sort of foundation -- a small group of personnel which 
could be trained for bilateral diplomacy. In August 1992, we 
began by opening our consulate. For Vienna, Austria it was 
actually the discovery of Ukraine. 
  Since then, we have managed to establish fairly stable 
political relations between the two countries. 
  [Yakovenko] There is an opinion that Austria can 
become a bridge to the West for Ukraine, and the fact that 
Ukraine was once a part of the Austro-Hungarian empire, and a 
certain interpenetration took place -- which helps to achieve 
mutual understanding, rapprochement, and cooperation -- could 
play a certain role in this. At the same time, Ukrainian 
businessmen, who are trying to establish contacts with their 
Western colleagues, are complaining that Western businessmen 
consider Ukraine one of the most unsuccessful countries among 
those which rose from the rubble of the Soviet Union. Have you 
noticed such a mood in Austria? 
  [Kostenko] The development of economic relations is very 
complex. When we signed an agreement on trade and economic 
cooperation with Austria last year, we expected a breakthrough 
in this area. Unfortunately, this has not happened. There is 
indeed this kind of mood that we have mentioned. We are not 
trusted enough. Our political and economic instability should 
be blamed for that. Although we have already established about 
70 joint venture enterprises, there have not been any serious 
joint projects that could be considered achievements. We have 
only been continuing those projects that were developed when 
Ukraine was a part of the USSR. For example, we are still 
shipping coal through the Danube for Austria's steel casting 
industry. 
  [Yakovenko] Do the UN sanctions against Yugoslavia 
hinder this business? 
  [Kostenko] They do very much. The Ukrainian Danube 
Steamship Company has its office here, and we closely cooperate 
with it. This is, by the way, one of the few state companies 
which have their offices in Austria. So, returning to the 
development of economic relations, we have been trying to obtain 
a substantial loan from Austria. There was even a moment when 
the Austrians were ready to grant us such a loan. Over the last 
six months however, so many prime ministers and deputy prime 
ministers have been replaced that they have become confused. I 
do not blame them. They send, for example, a letter to one 
deputy prime minister, they wait for a response for a month, and 
when it finally comes, it is signed by another person, whom they 
do not know. 
  There are also problems connected with the fact that we have 
not settled the issue of debts. The debt of the former Soviet 
Union to tiny Austria amounts to $5 billion. The Austrians have 
linked the issue of debts to the possibility of receiving new 
loans, knowing that we do not have funds to repay them. 
  They also know about another matter. I have had a 
conversation with one of the leaders of the currently ruling 
Social Democratic Party. He said the following: "You are not 
serious when it comes to the issue of debts. You say that you 
do not have funds to repay them, but we know that you have 
delivered to South Korea goods we would have bought with 
pleasure, including reinforced steel and chemicals." 
  Russia, despite its unsettled debts, still receives 
multibillion loans from tiny Austria. Austrian business is not 
the only one in Austria. It is a center where many contracts 
are signed. They grant loans to Russia, because Russia can 
repay them in gas, oil, or other products for which there is a 
high demand here. Whereas they are not afraid that the money 
will be wasted by Russia, our situation is very similar to that. 
  They can grant a loan only under the government's guarantee. 
Nevertheless, we have not managed to accomplish anything with 
Austria in this area. Austrian businessmen are complaining that 
our people have not yet been accustomed to fulfilling their 
commitments and developing contacts. 
  As for science and technology, the situation is more 
promising here, predominantly because certain politicians and a 
part of society remember the fact you have mentioned before, and 
this historic nostalgia helps. For example, at the Ministry of 
Science and Research headed by Austrian Vice Chancellor Erhard 
Busek, the so-called stipend system was created three years ago, 
which gives our specialists the opportunity to come to Austria 
for training for either two weeks or one year. There are many 
contacts between institutes. [passage omitted] 
  [Yakovenko] Yuriy Vasylevych, let us turn to another 
aspect of your work -- as a permanent representative at 
international organizations. What is currently important to 
Ukraine in this area? 
  [Kostenko] In general, for a young state that is currently 
looking for self-affirmation, all aspects are important. Let us 
have a look at the participation in the International Atomic 
Energy Agency [IAEA]. At the February session of the IAEA 
management board (Ukraine is one of the 35 countries which 
comprise the board), we discussed very acute political 
questions. One of them, for instance, considered the nuclear 
potential of North Korea. Ukraine, with its population of 52 
million, should have its own stance on every issue, particularly 
now since we took an important step toward nuclear disarmament, 
and we intend to sign the Nonproliferation of Nuclear Arms 
Treaty. The system of guarantees will be developed exactly by 
the IAEA. Unfortunately, many unflattering opinions have been 
voiced against this organization over the last few years, 
because its leadership has not come forward with a clear stance 
on Chernobyl. Our well known politicians have accused the IAEA 
of being the world's "nuclear" lobby. Maybe, this is true. 
But, there are different kinds of lobbies. If a lobby leads to 
another Chernobyl, I am against such a lobby. If a lobby 
advocates, however, that 70 percent of energy be produced at 
safe nuclear reactors, as in France, I support such a lobby. 
  Ukraine is currently obtaining up to 35 percent of its 
electricity from five nuclear power plants, including the 
damaged Chernobyl one. Therefore, it is an issue of national 
security to receive information from the IAEA, and to ensure 
safe operation of our 15 power units. 
  We must establish a national system of inventorying nuclear 
materials with the help and cooperation of the IAEA. A 
civilized state should know how many nuclear materials it has, 
because if this is unknown, the country will be pilfered. 
Later, it will be a great discredit if someone is caught with a 
nuclear container in Austria or Germany.... 
  Finally, there is the third aspect of our activities -- the 
participation in the Vienna negotiations of the CSCE. There is 
a meeting every day. Currently, such vital issues as 
international peacekeeping operations in Europe are being 
discussed there. Russia has come forward with claims to the 
role of a dominant power in our region, as well as to the right 
to conduct peacekeeping operations on territories of the former 
USSR. 
  [Yakovenko] How have relations between Ukrainian 
diplomats and their Russian colleagues been developing here in 
Vienna? 
  [Kostenko] This is a very uneasy topic. As you recall, I 
have been a diplomat for a long time. I worked for many years 
in the Soviet Union delegation in Geneva on negotiations on 
chemical weapons and disarmament. I know many diplomats, and I 
have a few things to compare. I am now very grateful to Soviet 
envoys with whom I worked and who taught me a lot. Here, I have 
to say that, unfortunately, Russia is currently losing the 
experience of Soviet diplomacy. Talented and reasonable people 
either have joined other structures or have begun to work for 
international organizations where they receive better salaries. 
[passage omitted] 
  We do not currently have such relations as the ones we had 
after Ukraine had pronounced its independence. There is a 
certain alienation between us. This is connected with the fact 
that we have very different stands on a whole range of issues. 
This relates not to relations between Kostenko and Popov or 
Zaytsev (the former is the Russian ambassador to Austria; the 
latter is Russia's permanent representative at international 
organizations), but between Russia and Ukraine. We cannot agree 
(this relates to the CSCE talks) that Russia will play a 
dominating role on territories of the former USSR. We cannot 
agree that Russia is assuming a leading role in the CIS. 
Similar disagreements, and this is connected with my speeches 
and statements at the talks, repel us from each other. 
  Everyone understands that Russia, as a nuclear state and the 
largest republic of the former USSR, whether we want it or not, 
will play the leading role. The point is, however, that it 
should not offend others. When a Russian envoy begins to 
reprimand an Estonian, Latvian, or Lithuanian, I feel I have to 
counter this. Sometimes, I try to support my Baltic colleagues, 
when Russia tries to impose its opinion. It is very good that 
we have reached consent at the Vienna talks. Either my word or 
that of my Estonian colleague can block any decision. [passage 
omitted]

<F P=106> ["Ukrainian Presidential Directive on Urgent Measures for </F>
Eliminating the Consequences of the Chernobyl Catastrophe in 
Kiev Oblast's Polissya Rayon" issued in Kiev on 22 Apr] 
  [Text] 1. Ukraine's Cabinet of Ministers must see to it 
that, until 1 September 1995, residents be evacuated from the 
populated areas of Kiev Oblast's Polissya Rayon that are 
categorized as zones of unquestionable (mandatory) evacuation. 
To do so, it is necessary, by 1 May 1994, to find a possibility 
for allocating additional capital amounting to 1 trillion 
karbovantsi from the Fund For Carrying Out Measures on 
Eliminating the Consequences of the Chernobyl Catastrophe and 
Social Protection of the Population in 1994 to the Kiev Oblast 
State Administration for building housing; 
  --with the participation of the Kiev Oblast State 
Administration, to take urgent measures for a radical 
improvement of the material and technological provision of 
medical and educational institutions and for establishing 
telephone communications and vehicle traffic between the 
populated areas of Polissya Rayon and Kiev; 
  --to elaborate and adopt, by 1 July 1994, a separate program 
for eliminating the consequences of the Chernobyl catastrophe in 
the populated areas of Polissya Rayon from which residents are 
not evacuated; 
  --to submit, by 1 July 1994, for the consideration of 
Ukraine's Supreme Council, proposals on the creation of a single 
body for managing exclusion zones and for unquestionable 
(mandatory) evacuation, as well as on placing those citizens who 
had, on the day of the accident, permanently resided and 
continue to reside and work in populated areas situated in the 
zone of unquestionable (mandatory) evacuation, into category two 
of the participants in the liquidation of the accident at the 
Chernobyl Nuclear Electric Power Station [AES]. 
  2. Ukraine's Ministry for Issues of Protection of the 
Population from the Consequences of the Accident at the 
Chernobyl AES, with the participation of Ukraine's Academy of 
Sciences, Ukraine's Ministry of Agriculture and Foodstuffs, and 
the Kiev Oblast State Administration, must submit, by 1 July 
1994, for the consideration of Ukraine's Cabinet of Ministers 
the following: --proposals on the procedure of using land 
in Polissya Rayon, proceeding from the intensity of radioactive 
contamination, the fertility of the soils, the demographic 
situation, and the production costs and demand for the rayon's 
produce; 
  --on the expedience of preserving and maintaining buildings 
and structures, as well as on the further utilization of land in 
the exclusion zone. 
  3. To draw the attention of Ukraine's Minister of 
Agriculture 
and Foodstuffs Yu. Karasyk to the unsatisfactory fulfillment of 
Article 6 of Ukrainian Presidential Edict No. 348 of 21 August 
1993 "On Additional Measures Regarding the Elimination of the 
Consequences of the Chernobyl Catastrophe" in what concerns the 
organization and control over the supply of clean foodstuffs to 
those zones that have been affected by the catastrophe at the 
Chernobyl AES and to oblige him to eradicate the existing 
shortcomings as soon as possible. 
  4. The State Control and Auditing Service at Ukraine's 
Ministry of Finance and Ukraine's Ministry of Internal Affairs 
must, by 15 June 1994, carry out an inspection of the 
utilization in 1992-94 of the funds that were allocated for the 
liquidation of the consequences of the Chernobyl catastrophe and 
submit the materials of the inspection to the Ukrainian 
Presidential Administration.

  [Text] Ukrainian President Leonid Kravchuk visited two 
international exhibitions on 28 April, arranged on the grounds 
of the National Exhibitions Center--INMED-94 and CONSIMED-94. 
The head of state paid considerable attention to goods 
manufactured by Ukrainian enterprises participating in the 
exhibitions and noted that they were making significant efforts 
to represent Ukraine worthily worldwide. 
  Journalists asked the head of state to comment on some 
aspects of political life in Ukraine. He was asked, in 
particular, to make more specific his stance on the upcoming 
presidential election, which is known, as well as to state what 
the president would do if the new parliament disagreed with his 
arguments. Kravchuk said the following: 
  [Begin Kravchuk recording] First, you do not know my whole 
position. I always emphasize the following: No matter what our 
assessment of the situation in Ukraine is at present--either 
mild or strong--there is constitutional chaos and constitutional 
crisis, which is a fact because Ukraine is perhaps the only 
former Soviet Union state that has not adopted its constitution 
or formed new real bodies of judicial power in four years--i.e., 
let us say, any branches of power. Even Belarus, it seems, has 
already finished recently and has adopted a Constitution. 
Belarus is holding elections after this, with the structure of 
power, branches of power, and system of power having been 
determined expressly and clearly at the constitutional level. 
We, unfortunately, have not gotten this far. 
  We have been busy all the time but have never gone all the 
way. We did not finalize the issue of a local executive power at 
a specific time in the past. We formed presidential structures 
but also began granting executive powers to representative 
bodies. Thus, instead of, let us say, softer, gradual transition 
from diarchy to the centralization of, shall we say, executive 
power, we have constantly been causing diarchy to worsen. 
  Now, if you are carefully following speeches, you can hear 
the accents and voices: Power must be in one pair of hands. 
This is so. Let me raise the question, however: Where exactly 
in one pair of hands? If it is Kiev, one can assume, for 
instance, that executive power is transferred to one pair of 
hands, either to the president or to the Cabinet of Ministers. 
To do this, however, changes to the Constitution should be 
made. Power in one pair of hands in Kiev, however, does not at 
all mean that it is in one pair of hands in Ukraine, because 
what is being proposed now--forming power at the regional 
level--in villages, towns, cities, rayons, and oblasts--is on no 
account taken care of by the argument or the formula of power in 
one pair of hands. Power will be in a hundred pairs of hands. 
Whereas power would be in one pair of hands in Kiev, there once 
again would be no vertical structure of power locally, and once 
again there would not be what we have wanted to achieve. 
  So, the interesting thing is this: If the president has the 
whole of power, (?himself being in Kiev) as some propose, this 
now sounds more like a presidential republic. But where? At 
the center. What kind of power is there locally? It is 
representative, soviet. Once again, the diarchy would be laid, 
which is exactly what all of us are saying. 
  That is why this is exactly what I am talking about: To 
begin 
with, one should make a decision with regard to these problems, 
make a decision at the constitutional level. When I am talking 
about elections and when I am saying that I will ask the new 
parliament to make a decision, it is not that I would like to 
shift responsibility to someone else. 
  I would only like the new parliament to confirm whether it 
agrees with what we have done over the past four years. I have 
in mind the Supreme Council, and not only the Supreme Council 
but the executive structures as well. I do not remove the 
responsibility from anyone, for it dots the i's and crosses the 
t's and says that we have to begin, to get down to the final 
solution of this issue by means of the election, having formed 
all the institutions at the constitutional level or at the level 
of some law on power. 
  We have to begin the adoption of laws because the following 
situation may arise, which I have spoken about more than once: 
The president is elected according to this law, and he is the 
head of state and the head of the executive power, and the power 
structures are not determined. Everything will begin all over 
again. 
  Well, look at our Constitution. Take Article 97 of the 
Constitution and Article 114--two articles only, to say nothing 
about the other articles--and you will see nothing there but 
contradictions and discrepancies. That is a fact. Therefore, I 
appeal to the new Supreme Council with a proposal to consider 
all this. It will be its right, its power. I am not 
encroaching on anyone's powers--this is clear--to make its final 
decision and have its say, because the 12th Supreme Council has 
already passed on the responsibility, and this Supreme Council 
is assuming it. This is how it should do this. Such is my 
stand. I hope that this is a normal stand, that it complies 
with all the norms of legislation and the creation of a 
law-governed state. If the Supreme Council fails to confirm or, 
for example, confirms the decision of the old Supreme Council, 
it will thus again initiate this chaos. In that chaos, it will 
be necessary to make decisions concerning both the presidential 
election and the election to the local bodies of power. I will 
also have to make a decision. Before the Supreme Council holds 
its session, I am following the road of law, legitimacy, and 
observance of the Constitution. If this is absent, I also have 
the right as the president now to make a decision concerning the 
election. That is to say, I have not yet made a decision before 
the Supreme Council session. I will make a decision after the 
Supreme Council session. [end recording]

  [Text] The newly-elected people's deputies of Ukraine have 
appealed to the people and the president of Ukraine. The appeal 
reads as follows: 
  The election to the Supreme Council of Ukraine, despite 
various pessimistic forecasts, took place in the overwhelming 
majority of the constituencies. This is evidence of the growing 
political consciousness of the citizens of Ukraine. Their faith 
makes us, people's deputies of Ukraine, especially responsible 
before the people. The new Supreme Council is called to make 
decisive steps that would change the state of affairs for the 
better, because the situation that took shape in our country is 
a crisis situation. 
  Taking into account the fact that the new Supreme Council 
will assume plenary powers in one month's time only, and time is 
pressing, we appeal to the people of Ukraine and all the 
people's deputies in this critical moment to estimate the 
seriousness of the political situation and its possible 
consequences. 
  We call on the president of Ukraine to suspend, within the 
framework of his plenary powers, the effect of Article 3 of the 
Law of Ukraine on the early election of the Supreme Council of 
Ukraine and the president of Ukraine of 24 September 1993, and 
the effect of Article 2 of the Supreme Council resolution of 3 
February this year on enforcing the Law of Ukraine on the 
formation of local bodies of power and self-government, until 
the new Constitution of Ukraine is adopted. 
  We are convinced, says the appeal, that such a step is 
utterly necessary in the interests of the state and the people 
of Ukraine. 
  One hundred and twenty people's deputies of Ukraine from 20 
oblasts and the Crimea Republic signed the appeal.

<F P=106> [Report by Svitlana Synyakova: "Levko Lukyanenko: `Neither </F>
I Nor Chornovil Have a Chance'"] 
  [Text] This is the conclusion made by the chairman of the 
Ukraine Democratic Association at the news conference held on 21 
April. According to Lukyanenko, the current alignment of forces 
in Ukraine provides no grounds for illusions. The nine years of 
national democrats' activities did not change much -- the people 
are scared by the nomenklatura. Some time ago, there was hope 
that the democrats would unite during the presidential elections 
and nominate one candidate, namely [former Defense Minister] 
Kostyantyn Morozov. However this time Levko Lukyanenko voiced 
his reservations against General Morozov. He believes that the 
nomenklatura throughout Ukraine will rise as one man against 
this candidate, as it happened in the Artemivskyy constituency 
No.1 during the spring legislative elections. 
  Incidentally, Kostyantyn Morozov himself does not believe 
that he had irrevocably lost the legislative elections. Both he 
and his team demand that the results of the elections in that 
constituency be declared invalid. They have handed over to the 
Central Electoral Committee an appropriate motion and a number 
of documents testifying to numerous violations of the electoral 
law. However, the general is waging the war for the restoration 
of justice without any party's assistance. He tends to 
underline this because, according to him, it is still unclear 
what political forces fought against him in the electoral 
district. General Morozov pointed out that he would treat the 
proposal to take part in presidential elections only provided 
that it is backed by all democratic forces. This would be an 
important step toward consolidation of democrats, while the 
election itself would either bring about a victory or the 
forming of a powerful opposition. 
  Thus far, democrats have only demonstrated unity in ignoring 
presidential elections. According to Levko Lukyanenko, the 
democrats will launch a campaign against Leonid Kuchma, 
Oleksandr Morozov, and Petro Symonenko, rather than back any one 
candidate. Worldwide Coordinating Council Chairman Ivan Drach 
does not rule out that we will have to choose between Moroz and 
Kuchma. It should be pointed out that Drach did not take part 
in either legislative or any other elections this time, and is 
not going to do this. He explains that he has enough 
possibilities to be heard, while preference should be given to 
young politicians. This is just: New times demand new people. 
  Meanwhile, higher echelons demonstrate a wish to preserve 
the 
status quo. Perhaps this is why Oles Shevchenko, Ukrainian 
Republican Party [URP] deputy chairman, asked the reporters to 
be patient, refrain from discussing the presidential election 
and wait until 25 April. 
  Other symptomatic news: We were not invited to attend the 
URP congress scheduled to start on 23 April. Rumors have it 
that the congress will be held behind closed doors and not all 
the members of the URP leadership know where. This is hard to 
believe. It will be even harder to believe in what will be said 
at the news conference on the results of the congress.

<F P=106> [Interview with Yevgeniy Saburov, vice premier of the Crimea </F>
government, by Vladimir Pasyakin in the "Topical Issue" column: 
"Today Crimea Is Reminiscent of a Sinking Ship" -- in 
Sevastopol, date not given] 
  [Excerpts] [Passage omitted] [Pasyakin] How is the 
formation of the Crimean Cabinet of Ministers proceeding? 
  [Saburov] As for the government, there is one big difficulty 
here. We may differ in our attitude to the "empire" but it 
needs to be said that it had one very unpleasant quality: The 
center worked like a vacuum cleaner. If an intelligent 
specialist appeared somewhere in the provinces, he soon ended up 
in Moscow. Therefore I have been confronted with the task of 
attracting good cadres. 
  For instance, Economy Minister Andrey Vasilyevich 
Chernyavskiy is one of the best forecasters in Russia. The 
economic analysis he has provided throughout the entire course 
of reform is valued very highly. Lyudmila Mikhaylovna Zaytseva 
-- a fairly prominent Russian economist, who has dealt with 
public finances -- in other words, what in socialist jargon was 
called the social sphere -- has agreed to become finance 
minister. [passage omitted] 
  [Pasyakin] How do you relate to the fact that the Ukrainian 
president's representative has been sent to Crimea? After all, 
his emergence means effectively the formation of a third branch 
of power. 
  [Saburov] The current situation in Crimea is absolutely 
fantastic. Elections have been held; a legitimate head of the 
executive branch has been elected; and after all this a 
Ukrainian presidential representative is appointed.... This is 
legal nonsense. If he is the executive branch, then apparently 
the results of the elections in Crimea are not recognized. 
  [Pasyakin] What is the situation in Crimea at present? What 
is your action program for the near future? 
  [Saburov] Crimea is currently reminiscent of a sinking ship. 
The economic reform program provides for improving financial 
relations with Russia, promoting banking, elaborating an optimal 
privatization program, revising the tax system, attracting 
foreign investors, and so forth. But for economic reform to be 
successful, a minimum favorable political climate is needed. 
The complicated situation in Crimea is a serious obstacle to 
reform. 
  [Pasyakin] Presumably, pursuing unorthodox economic reform 
in Crimea calls for certain boldness? 
  [Saburov] We shall have to resort to unpopular measures to 
lead the economy out of the deadlock. This will naturally cause 
discontent. Yet they cannot be rejected for this reason only. 
It is enough to recall Ludwig Erhard, the classic example of 
brilliant reform in post-war Germany. Everybody criticized him 
but he did not turn off his path.

  [Text] Simferopol [no date as received]--Yevgeny Saburov, 
deputy prime minister of the Crimea Republic, recently gave 
assurances in an exclusive interview with a UNIAN correspondent 
that it is not the policy of either the Crimean or Ukrainian 
leadership that threatens most of all the practical 
implementation of his concept of reforming the economy, but it 
is the "fear of unpopular methods with which the people are 
filled." 
  "I sensed the same fear during the meeting with Leonid 
Kravchuk in Kiev, and this is very dangerous. I warned him that 
I could not coordinate my economic actions with the incompetent 
people who led Ukraine to such a state. I know that Yukhym 
Zvyahilskyy is not a supporter of my economic concept and will 
never become one. This is why I asked Kravchuk to check the 
observance of the laws of Ukraine that delimit the powers of 
Ukraine and Crimea," he said. 
  Replying to a question on the possible time of introducing 
the reforms in compliance with the decrees, Saburov said that he 
did not dare to affirm when these would get under way because 
they touch upon many structures in Ukraine, the National Bank in 
particular. Meanwhile, to implement the decrees on currency 
regulation and on banking activity, permission is necessary to 
licence the activity of not only Ukrainian banks but foreign 
banks as well. 
  Saburov reported that he was not yet familiarized with the 
economic programs of Ukrainian economists, but "there will be no 
problems" as far as the coordination of actions with the future 
Government of Ukraine is concerned, "if the sides abide by the 
laws on the delimitation of powers and coordinate their actions 
on this very basis". 
  The Crimean deputy prime minister resolutely rejected any 
connection between the introduction of economic reforms and the 
political situation on the peninsula. In his opinion, the mass 
media unjustly assessed "the fuss in high places during the 
election campaign" as political instability in Crimea. "It is 
normal for politicians to win over to their side. I believe 
that the tragic nature of the situation in Crimea is far-fetched 
in many respects. There is no Abkhazia here," he assured, and 
also emphasized the "gross violations by Ukraine of its own law 
on the delimitation of powers between Ukraine and the Crimea 
Republic, according to which all economic activity, including 
the signing of international agreements, is the prerogative of 
Crimea." 
  Saburov spoke out for the necessity of setting up joint 
working groups of Ukraine and Crimea to conduct negotiations and 
work out the documents acceptable to both sides, "as this has 
been done by Russia and Tatarstan," and to search for a 
compromise, which "always requires a certain amount of courage." 
  In reply to the question, "Who would you like to see as the 
president of Ukraine?", Saburov said that he had seen neither 
worthy politicians nor appropriate economic programs at the 
election in Ukraine." 
  "They were blaming Russia, although one could at least see 
the differences between political forces there. As far as 
Ukraine is concerned, political life here is in embryonic 
state," he said. 
  In Saburov's opinion, Leonid Kuchma and "insignificant, 
little-known persons, who represented the interregional Bloc of 
Reforms, gained victory only because they had a certain program 
and people were voting for it."

<F P=106> [Interview with Crimean Minister of Finance Lyudmila </F>
Zaytseva by Irina Karpenko; place and date not given: "Will 
This Corner of Paradise Become Heaven on Earth? ROSSIYSKIYE 
VESTI's Observer Irina Karpenko Converses with Crimean Minister 
of Finance Lyudmila Zaytseva"] 
  [Text] Crimea's president has issued an edict appointing 
Lyudmila Zaytseva the republic's minister of finance. Lyudmila 
Mikhaylovna is a mathematician by training, but has worked as a 
professional economist for over 20 years. She participated in 
the elaboration of the program of Russia's economic development. 
Before her new appointment she was in charge of the Russian 
Federation Government's Center for Information and Social 
Technologies Sector for Financing the Non-Production Sphere. 
She has written articles on topical problems for our newspaper, 
and promised to give ROSSIYSKIYE VESTI her first interview as 
minister of finance. 
  [Karpenko] This is nice, Lyudmila Mikhaylovna, you have kept 
your promise. And a finance minister's promise carries quite 
some weight. Congratulations on your appointment. But are you 
not afraid? What is the Crimea's current financial and economic 
situation? What is the status of the coupon, the ruble, and the 
dollar? 
  [Zaytseva] As regards being afraid -- yes and no.... In for 
a penny, in for a pound. Now that I have been appointed, there 
is no point worrying about it, I have to get down to work. As 
for the Crimea's financial and economic situation, it is the 
same old story. Russia, Ukraine, and the Crimea all face the 
same problems. 
  But it goes without saying that the Crimea's economic 
situation is largely dependent on Ukraine's political and 
economic course. This must be borne in mind, and so must the 
fact that the majority of our enterprises are geared to either 
delivering their output to Russia or purchasing components from 
Russia. Thus, Russia's economic role in the Crimea is also 
highly significant. 
  Turning to the coupon's rate of exchange against the ruble 
and the dollar (and the coupon is now recognized as the sole 
legitimate means of payment and is accepted without restrictions 
throughout the Crimea), it is obvious that here too we are most 
strongly dependent on Ukraine's policy. And the dollar's rate 
of exchange in the Crimea is actually tied in with the 
ruble-dollar rate of exchange. 
  [Karpenko] Does this mean that your hands are absolutely 
tied as regards your own actions, and that the government's 
original program for the Crimea's economic development would be 
pointless? Would it not be simpler not to "rush in where angels 
fear to tread" and cope with events as they develop? 
  [Zaytseva] No. The external conditions in which we exist 
have to be taken into account, but this does not mean that we 
will not pursue our own economic policy. We also have the legal 
basis for this. An edict by the president of Ukraine in 1993 
granted the republic the broadest powers in the sphere of 
financial, budget, currency, and credit relations. This enables 
us to transform shortcomings into assets and utilize the 
Crimea's unique geographical and natural position and its 
agricultural and industrial potential which must be made to work 
efficiently for the Crimeans' benefit. 
  [Karpenko] So, how will your program differ from Ukraine's 
program of sluggish reforms or from Russia's stunningly bogged 
down reforms? 
  [Zaytseva] Of course, we are in a much more advantageous 
position than those who launched their reforms in 1991. 
Unfortunately, we are learning from mistakes. There is no 
doubt that Russia's experience of reforms will be taken into 
account. Even in the Crimea -- we are, after all, not starting 
altogether from scratch -- market processes are already under 
way. But the strength of the state's impact on economic 
processes, and consequently the degree of the economy's 
manageability, is much greater here than in Russia. This is a 
more advantageous situation, and we must exploit it. 
  We are choosing a softer option of reforms. We will, without 
any question, take into account the negative experience of the 
taxation burden. Incidentally, taxes in Ukraine are much higher 
than in Russia. Therefore, the first avenue of our economic 
policy will be to reduce the tax burden and cut the amount of 
taxes. We intend to increase budget revenue by increasing the 
number of subjects of economic activity. The second, and 
equally important, avenue is the social orientation of financial 
policy. Thus, we have taken the risk of lifting restrictions on 
the consumption fund. Such restrictions exist both in Ukraine 
and in Russia. We in the Crimea have decided that there is no 
need to impose restrictions on the wages fund. And this 
principle has already been implemented. 
  [Karpenko] Are you not afraid that this might lead to higher 
inflation? 
  [Zaytseva] The point is that the Crimeans' wages today are 
very low -- 600,000 coupons on average (at the rate of 1 ruble 
to 22 coupons), while food prices are only one-half of what they 
are in Russia. If we continue along the path of curbing wages, 
we will only aggravate the situation: Our Crimeans will be 
simply unable to buy the output they themselves produce. And 
this means that we will strangle our own agriculture and 
industry with our own hands. Boosting the population's 
purchasing power, and simply making people's life easier -- this 
is one of the first steps. The bread and milk problem will also 
have to be solved. Prices of these categories of produce have 
hitherto been artificially held back in the republic. Subsidies 
are already greater than costs. We appear to be helping the 
Crimeans, bit at the same time we are also feeding all the 
tourists, whose numbers in 1993 equaled those of the Crimea's 
population. We cannot yet afford such generosity. Would it not 
be better to cut the subsidies and channel the funds thus 
released directly in the Crimean residents' pockets by raising 
pensions, allowances, wages.... 
  As regards the budget and inflation.... During the great 
depression, U.S. President Roosevelt said that a balanced budget 
is a crime against the people. I regret the fact that the 
Crimea does not have the power to issue its own currency. A 
deficit-free budget must not be a dogma. Inflation will be 
pumped across to us from the mainland -- from Ukraine, from 
Russia. Imagine a tiny ship in a stormy sea. How can the 
ship's helmsman influence the elements, does the strength of the 
wind or the height of the waves depend on him? We can only sail 
with the wind, steer the ship so as to eventually reach the 
promised shore. 
  [Karpenko] Nonetheless, you are probably feeling the 
temptations facing all financiers: Cut the budget deficit and 
solve the most acute production problems by harsh savings in the 
so-called budget-funded sphere, in other words at the expense of 
science, culture, education.... 
  [Zaytseva] There can be no argument: The expenditure of 
state funds must be very strictly monitored. But savings for 
savings' sake -- in other words cutbacks in the financing of 
science, culture, education, health care -- this is a policy 
which has no right to exist. But the whole point is that it is 
impossible to look at only one aspect of the problem. After 
all, if we leave the situation as it is today and budget 
revenues are reduced, we will have to reduce budget 
appropriations. Therefore, there is only one way out: Channel 
all our efforts into ensuring a boost of the economy, which will 
lead to an inflow of budget appropriations. The temptation will 
simply vanish then. 
  [Karpenko] But life is life.... Which of the factors 
capable of hindering Crimea's successful reform do you consider 
to be the most dangerous: The political ones, or Ukraine's 
dispute with Russia over the Black Sea Fleet, or the criminal 
forces? 
  [Zaytseva] I hope that we will have normal relations with 
the Ukrainian authorities. Speaking about the domestic 
situation, I cannot yet see any serious forces which would not 
be interested in improving the Crimea's economic situation. 
  Of course we are worried about the Black Sea Fleet's future, 
but this question must be resolved in a civilized manner. Both 
Russia and Ukraine will have to pay the Crimea for the 
deployment of military installations since, under the law on the 
delimitation of powers between Ukraine and the Crimea, the land 
is the republic's property. The Crimean budget was supplemented 
from this source in 1991, even though to an insignificant 
extent. In 1992, on the Crimean Supreme Council's initiative, 
military units were granted preferential treatment until 1 
January 1994. But the deadline has expired and no payments have 
been received. Thus, this issue will have to be revisited. 
  There is something else that is worrying: As a result of 
Ukraine's harsh economic measures, and for self-preservation's 
sake, a series of our enterprises were forced to seek roundabout 
ways to, for example, "modify" the coupon's extremely low rate 
of exchange against the ruble and the dollar. We ought to make 
sure that nonpayment of taxes and the utilization of semilegal 
structures become more disadvantageous and dangerous than 
conducting business honestly. 
  [Karpenko] The Crimea has always been perceived as a corner 
of paradise, and was dubbed a sanatorium in Soviet times. Could 
the Crimea's recreational facilities yield high revenues? 
  [Zaytseva] Very high. This is how it should be, but so far 
this contribution is far below what is desirable. It is our 
strategic goal to substantially increase it. Of course, this 
needs political stability in the first place. I would like to 
take advantage of this occasion and say that the political 
situation in our country is calm now, any comparisons of the 
Crimea with Karabakh or the Dniester Region are totally out of 
order -- there is no need to scare people off. Therefore, be 
not afraid to come on vacation to the Crimea. 
  Unfortunately, by no means all people in Ukraine or Russia 
can afford such a trip. Thus, we are vitally interested in 
seeing that all people in Ukraine, in Russia, and in all other 
CIS countries live in peace and tranquility, but primarily the 
Crimeans.... 
  [Karpenko] Does all you have said mean that it is still 
possible to build a more or less prosperous life in a given 
region on its own? 
  [Zaytseva] We hope so. Provided the politicians and the 
powers that be do not mess things up.... We all should act with 
greater wisdom.

  [Text] Nagorno-Karabakh is prepared for a cease fire from 
00:01 hours of April 29, 1994, says a letter sent on April 28 by 
Karabakh Foreign Minister Arkady Gukasyan and the commander of 
the Karabakh Army, Samvel Babayan, to Russian Defense and 
Foreign Ministers, Pavel Grachev and Andrey Kozyrev, as well as 
to Russian presidential envoy, Vladimir Kazimirov. 
  Thus, Nagorno-Karabakh accepted the proposal put forward on 
April 26 by Russian Defense Minister Pavel Grachev on the 
cease-fire in the zone of the Karabakh conflict. The proposal 
was backed by Azerbaijan on the same day. The Minister proposed 
to declare a truce from 00:00 hours of April 28. However, 
Stepanakert was unable to give an official answer before 
Thursday. 
  The letter says that Nagorno Karabakh is prepared to observe 
a cease fire based on the protocol signed following the results 
of the meeting in Moscow on February 18 by defense ministers of 
Russia, Armenia and Azerbaijan, Pavel Grachev, Sarzh Sargsyan 
and Mamadrafi Mammadov. The document provides for a cease-fire 
in Nagorno-Karabakh, the withdrawal of the conflicting sides and 
talks on the Karabakh status. 
  The letter by the Karabakh leaders says that because of the 
absence of observers, the mutual distrust of the conflicting 
sides, and in an attempt to exclude possible attempts to use a 
temporary lull to prepare for another large-scale offensive, and 
to help make the peace process irreversible, the leaders of 
Nagorno-Karabakh believe it necessary to make use of the 
mechanism of the above protocol. 
  The implementation of the entire complex of 
military-technical measures, says the document, may guarantee a 
lasting cease-fire and create favorable conditions for solving 
political problems. 
  The letter says that leaders of Nagorno-Karabakh are 
prepared 
to order a cease-fire after the mediator (Russia) confirms the 
reception of an identical document from the conflicting side. 
  Interfax was informed about the letter of the Karabakh 
leadership by an aide to the Armenian president, Levon 
Ter-Petrosyan.

  [Text] Baku (April 28) TURAN -- "We welcome the stepped-up 
activity of the CSCE Minsk Group and all the efforts you have 
made in the past. We would like to see your work succeed", said 
President Aliyev during his meeting with the CSCE Minsk Group 
delegation headed by Mathias Mosberg. 
  According to Geydar Aliyev, Baku is striving for cease-fire 
and is seeking ways to establish peace in the region and it is 
in connection with this that the Chairman of the Milli Majlis, 
Rasul Guliyev, is actively negotiating with Moscow. 
  "After the meeting with Rasul Guliyev, Russian Defense 
Minister, Pavel Grachev, said that he will take measures to 
cease hostilities on April 28 at midnight, but Armenia continues 
to attack", said President Aliyev. 
  Azeri President mentioned that the peacemaking mission of 
the 
CSCE Minsk Group will lead to no effect without a cease-fire. 
The leader of the delegation, Deputy Chairman of the Minsk 
Group, Mathias Mosberg, agreed with this point of view. 
  "A cease-fire is the key element to the settlement of this 
problem. The aim of our visit to the region is to achieve a 
truce and we will make every effort to bring that about", 
stressed Mosberg. 
  Today, the delegation is scheduled to visit the war zone and 
then will return to Baku. After that the delegation again will 
visit Khankendi [Stepanakert] and Yerevan.

  [Text] Baku, 28 Apr--This evening (at about 1800 hours 
local time) a delegation of the CSCE Minsk group on Nagornyy 
Karabakh [Nagorno-Karabakh] was fired upon by Armenian armed 
formations at Terter, in the center of Terterskiy Rayon in the 
southwest of Azerbaijan. 
  After arriving in Azerbaijan two days ago, the delegation 
went this afternoon to this frontline rayon to acquaint itself 
with the situation on the spot and to study the possibility of 
deploying CSCE observers there. 
  According to a confidential source, two missiles from a Grad 
launcher fell close to the building housing the local 
administration at the time when the CSCE representatives were 
there. According to preliminary information, there are no 
casualties.

  [Text] In Karabakh, despite Russian Defense Minister 
Grachev's proposal, backed by Azerbaijan, to start a cease fire 
as of 00:00, April 28, the two sides have continued to shell 
each other's positions. However, major battles, as both 
Stepanakert and Baku claims, have come to a halt, which is 
explained by rain and fog in Karabakh . 
  As INTERFAX has learned from the Karabakh army's press 
service, Azerbaijani troops after midnight struck Karabakh 
positions at Talish, a community in the north of the Mardakert 
region. Casualty figures are as yet unavailable. 
  Armenian units, in turn, according to Azerbaijan's Defense 
Ministry, fired rockets into Terter and nearby villages, 
bordering with Karabakh. Villages in the Tauz region of 
Azerbaijan were also shelled from Armenia. 
  The spokesman claimed that despite the Armenians provocative 
actions, the Azerbaijanis did not retaliate. 
  Meanwhile, a spokesman for Azerbaijani President Gaydar 
Aliyev has dismissed as unfounded Stepanakert's demand that 
Aliyev address a formal truce offer to the Karabakh authorities. 
The Karabakh leadership has declared that only after such a 
request, can it respond to Grachev's proposal to cease fire. 
  As a senior official has told INTERFAX, "there can be no 
more 
formal statements other than those made by Azerbaijan's head of 
state two days ago and the statement made by the Russian defense 
minister." 
  In his words, "If the opposite side sincerely desires peace, 
such a statement by an Azerbaijani leader, reaffirmed by a top 
Russian mediator in the peace process would be taken as an 
overture of peace." 
  He believes that by turning down the offer to cease fire, 
Armenia is rejecting yet another Russian peace initiative.

<F P=106> [Svetlana Turyalay report: "The Unexpected -- Next. It </F>
Turns Out That Moscow's Services Are Not Needed in Azerbaijan at 
the Moment"] 
  [Text] Baku -- Deputies were plunged into shock by 
Azerbaijan Foreign Minister Gasan Gasanov's speech at the 
National Assembly on the Russian plan for settling the 
Armenia-Azerbaijan conflict. The draft peace agreement contains 
at least 18 articles which are unacceptable to Azerbaijan. 
First, it is proposed that Baku completely renounce the right 
to monitor the military potential of the former autonomous 
republic and recognize the existence of the "armed forces of 
Nagorno-Karabakh." It is proposed to give Azerbaijan's 
Lechinskiy Rayon the status of a "corridor" under the full 
control of the Armenian side, that is, to enshrine de jure what 
has already existed de facto for two years now. According to 
the plan the city of Shusha -- the historical and cultural 
center of Nagorno-Karabakh -- remains under Armenian control. 
The Armenian forces are to vacate the remaining occupied 
territories but without monitoring by international observers. 
  According to the plan which has been proposed, Azerbaijan is 
to lift the blockade on all communication routes leading into 
Armenia and Nagorno-Karabakh even while the negotiation process 
is going on. But Russia is proposing that the main question -- 
on the status of Nagorno-Karabakh, the cause of the six years of 
bloody war between Armenia and Azerbaijan -- be resolved this 
way: When the peace agreement is concluded so-called 
international guarantees of the special ownership of this region 
will be given, as happened in the case of Cyprus, Nakhichevan, 
and the state of Kashmir. 
  The Azerbaijan Foreign Minister called the present 
settlement 
plan a plan designed to preserve the conflict because if the 
military potential of Nagorno-Karabakh is maintained there is no 
guarantee that hostilities will not resume. National Assembly 
deputies were far harsher in their comments: This is the 
capitulation of Azerbaijan. In this regard opposition deputies 
and those deputies loyal to the authorities achieved a rare 
unanimity: The Russian plan is not even worthy of discussion and 
amendment. They instructed Gasan Gasanov to prepare an 
alternative draft, which is to be presented to Russia and 
Armenia. 
  Meanwhile, anti-Russian feelings have increased sharply in 
Azerbaijan. Various parties have made a succession of 
statements to the effect that they will take up arms against the 
Russian Army if the latter is brought into Azerbaijan even in 
the capacity of peacemakers. And the Islamic Party has flatly 
stated that it will declare a jihad (holy war) against the 
Russian authorities.

<F P=106> [Report by Fazil Aleskeroglu: "Unity of Outlook and </F>
Positions Needed"] 
  [Text] The meeting between Minister of Foreign Affairs 
Hasan Hasanov with the new U.S. ambassador to Azerbaijan, Mr. 
Richard Dale Kozlaric, lasted more than two hours. 
Unfortunately, to journalists' questions the ambassador gave 
only one reply--that all aspects of Azerbaijani-American 
relations have been discussed meticulously and in detail and a 
mutual understanding has been reached that...in order to achieve 
complete clarity, many additional meetings will be needed, which 
will indeed be held. He added that he would refrain from 
answering other questions until he presents his credentials to 
the head of the republic. 
  So it was the minister who ended up answering many 
questions. 
First and foremost, he appraised highly the fact of appointment 
of Mr. Kozlarich as the U.S. Ambassador to Azerbaijan. The head 
of the foreign policy department emphasized that this 
appointment is a very positive fact and undoubtedly will 
facilitate rapprochement between our countries. 
  "I have known Mr. Kozlarich since 1992. I have a good 
impression of him. The ambassador has had a very long and 
serious diplomatic career. At the time he was dealing with all 
issues associated with the republics of the former Union. The 
positive impression I developed then was reaffirmed during our 
current meeting. The main point is that he is a man with a long 
service in diplomacy, well informed on the subject of Armenian 
aggression. All of this is evidence that the U.S. State 
Department, by appointing him the ambassador to Azerbaijan, 
counts on positive changes in the resolution of many issues. 
They sent here a person who is a man of goodwill, is sincere, 
and has a good grasp of the situation. Much will also depend on 
us, however. Because as a rule an ambassador interacts with 
everyone: the population, the government, and journalists. 
  Our republic, which is engaged in a war against Armenian 
aggressors, desperately needs unity; unity of outlook and 
position of both the government and the opposition. This is the 
only way we can get out of the crisis situation in which we 
currently find ourselves. 
  The minister also was asked how he feels about the proposal 
of some U.S. senators and congressmen to invite Ter-Petrosyan, 
as the most democratic of the presidents of the countries of the 
former Union, to America. Hasan Hasanov characterized this 
proposal as primarily another action of the Armenian lobby, and 
emphasized that it is seriously erroneous. 
  In the minister's opinion, the head of a republic that 
conducts an aggressive, bloody war that violates all human 
rights on the occupied territory, conducts regular ethnic 
cleansing, and violates all international norms and universal 
moral norms, cannot be considered a democrat. Especially 
considering that he also is de facto commander-in-chief of the 
Armenian armed forces.

<F P=106> [Arif Useynov report: "Azerbaijan: Panic on the Black </F>
Market"] 
  [Text] Baku -- It would appear that the situation that had 
been long predicted has become a reality: The U.S. dollar has 
shot up to 1,000 manats on the black market. Thus the 
population is 20 percent poorer, since the day before the same 
dollar could be bought for 800 manats. The same has happened 
with the exchange rate of the Russian ruble -- on the black 
market it is expressed in terms of the dollar rate and has 
reached 1 manat to 2 rubles. The manat is clearly dropping away. 
  Correspondingly, prices of basic necessities also shot up, 
getting beyond the reach of the majority of the population. The 
opposition press believes that what is happening on the currency 
market is the consequence of serious economic upheavals. In 
particular, the opinion is being expressed that the financial 
magnates who manipulate black market transactions are ready to 
blow the situation in the republic apart from within. It is not 
yet clear according to what scenario events will develop. The 
population has been agitated by the explosion of prices on the 
market -- a minimum salary today will only buy 1.5 kg of beef.

<F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS correspondents Tamara Zamyatina and Anna </F>
Melnikova] 
  [Text] Moscow April 28 TASS -- The civic accord signed at 
the Kremlin today is reviving the ancient Russian tradition to 
resolve arising problems together. 
  Now Russia is facing a new task: to broaden the framework of 
this memorandum, make it a pact not only between authorities and 
political forces but also an agreement among all citizens of the 
country. This was said today by participants of the ceremony of 
signing the accord at St. George's hall at the Kremlin. 
  Those chapters of the document in which the parties pledge 
to 
strengthen the federal system and national relations, are giving 
the hope for the soonest and peaceful settlement of inter-ethnic 
conflicts. 
  "The accord is opening the way to peace in Caucasus," 
President of Ingushetia Ruslan Aushev told ITAR-TASS in an 
interview. He expressed the wish that the conciliatory 
commission which would control the implementation of the terms 
of the accord, should pay close attention to the "working out of 
a mechanism for its enforcement so that this document would not 
repeat the sad fate of many earlier concluded agreements". 
President of North Ossetia Aksarbek Galazov shares Ruslan 
Aushev's standpoint. 
  President of Tatarstan Mintimer Shaimiyev expressed a 
specific attitude to the signed accord: He will insist on 
additions to the document concerning Tatarstan. 
  President of Ingushetia is counting on concluding a 
bilateral 
treaty with Russia. 
  It is noteworthy that even those several political leaders 
who did not sign the accord -- leader of the communist Party of 
the Russian Federation Gennadiy Zyuganov, and chairmen of 
representative bodies of power in the Kemerovo and Vladimir 
Regions, Tuleyev and Vinogradov, were present at the ceremony 
not wishing to be considered opponents of the accord. 
  "Our party has made a decision to continue a dialogue no 
matter what the situation is because civil war is not our 
choice. We are participating in all processes which lead to 
reconciliation, and are prepared to cover our part of the road 
for reaching this all- national purpose," Gennadiy Zyuganov told 
ITAR-TASS. 
  Participants in the ceremony of signing the document were 
unanimous to think that the signed accord is not a tribute to 
the momentary political situation but a prologue to the revival 
of a strong great power.

<F P=106> [Unattributed report: "Report on Results of Signing of </F>
Treaty on Social Accord 28 April 1994"] 
  [Text] The Treaty on Social Accord was signed by 245 of 
the 248 participants in the Assembly. 
  The following did not sign the Treaty: 
  N.Ye. Vinogradov -- chairman of Vladimir Oblast Legislative 
Assembly; 
  A.M. Tuleyev -- chairman of Kemerovo Oblast Legislative 
Assembly; 
  G.A. Zyuganov -- chairman of the "Communist Party of the 
Russian Federation" faction. 
  The following signed the Treaty with reservations: 
  M.Sh. Shaymiyev -- president of the Republic of Tatarstan; 
  A.Kh. Galazov -- president of the Republic of North Ossetia; 
  Yu.G. Biragov -- chairman of the Republic of North Ossetia 
Supreme Soviet; 
  F.Kh. Mukhametshin -- chairman of the Republic of Tatarstan 
Supreme Soviet; 
  V.Ye. Veshnyakov -- chairman of Chita Oblast Duma; 
  N.M. Semenenko -- chairman of the Medical Workers Trade 
Union; 
  M.A. Voroshilov -- cochairman of the Russian Metal Workers 
Trade Union; 
  V.V. Shulga -- cochairman of the Russian Trade Union of 
Drivers and Urban Transport Personnel. 
  The republic leaders' reservations generally relate to the 
Treaty's taking into consideration agreements concluded 
previously as well as official amendments to the draft Treaty 
submitted previously (Republic of Tatarstan). The leadership of 
North Ossetia objects to the inclusion in the Treaty of a clause 
regarding the creation of mechanisms to implement the Law on the 
Rehabilitation of Repressed Peoples. 
  The trade union leaders' reservations mainly boil down to 
objections at the inclusion in the text of the Treaty of a 
reference to the General Agreement for 1994.

<F P=106> [From the "Presidential Bulletin" feature: compiled by </F>
Nikolay Zherebtsov, Andrey Petrovskiy, edited by Vladimir 
Shishlin] 
  [Text] In his interview with journalists in the Kremlin 
leader of the communist party faction Gennadiy Zyuganov, who has 
not signed the Agreement, declared that his presence at the 
ceremony explains that he, in principle, supports the idea of 
accord. He stressed that his faction in the State Duma is ready 
to participate in the dialogue with those forces which would 
sign the Agreement. Responding to Interfax, Zyuganov reported 
about his intention to participate in the activity of "round 
tables" and working groups on concrete problems, that is, in the 
work of those mechanisms which have been mentioned in the 
Agreement on Civic Accord. 
  According to Vladimir Lukin, one of the leaders of the 
Yabloko faction, "a bad peace is better than a good quarrel," 
however, one should not sign this document because such a 
non-democratic figure as Vladimir Zhirinovskiy, who heads a 
non-democratic organization, would participate in its signing. 
"Today he signs it and tomorrow he will piss on his signature," 
Lukin declared. 
  Amangeldy Tuleyev, chairman of the Kemerovo regional 
council, 
explained his refusal to sign the Agreement by his 
non-confidence in the people who have initiated it, in 
particular, in the government which, to quote Tuleyev, "has been 
bogged down in corruption." "I believe that I would have 
accomplished a disgraceful deed if I had signed this document," 
Tuleyev said. 
  During conversation with journalists the presidential press 
secretary Vyacheslav Kostikov called the Agreement's signing 
"the beginning of a mighty process of public reconciliation." 
"Now the politicians are to implement everything what have been 
done by representatives of the forces which are present here," 
he said. 
  Kostikov underlined: "The process is open and everybody who 
wishes, who is mature enough, can sign it today, tomorrow, or in 
half a year." 
  Sergey Shakhray, leader of the Party of Russian Unity and 
Concord, declared that one should solve all problems at the 
negotiations table but not on barricades. Secondly, it is 
necessary that concrete protocols and decisions on concrete 
problems, primarily in the sphere of economy, social protection, 
and crime fighting, should follow this document. 
  Ingush President Ruslan Aushev called the articles on the 
need to create mechanisms aimed at the implementation of the 
decree on rehabilitation of repressed people is the most 
important one in this Agreement. 
  For his part, leader of North Ossetia Akhsarbek Galazov 
believes that the need to search for an efficient mechanisms to 
achieve all- republican accord but not this concrete article is 
the most important part of this document. 
  Tatarstan's President Mintimer Shaymiyev indicated that the 
republic would join the Agreement on several provisions. In 
particular, he said about Tatarstan's proposal to change the 
name of the document and to entitle it Declaration on Civic 
Accord. Shaymiyev expressed satisfaction with the fact that the 
working group in charge for the preparation of this document had 
taken into consideration Tatarstan's remark and removed the 
provision stipulating that the republics' constitutions should 
be brought in line with the Constitution of the Russian 
Federation. 
  Leader of the Russia's Choice faction Yegor Gaydar believes 
that signing of the Agreement represents a move in the right 
direction, it has given a new impetus to the stabilization of 
the political situation in Russia. "I have never had any 
illusions that is it possible to solve serious problems of the 
Russian life with the help of even a very important document, 
but now, at last, there has appeared a base with the help of 
which we can try to transfer the programmed confrontation from a 
non-civilized into a civilized one."

<F P=106> ["Own Information" report: "Hoping for Mutual </F>
Understanding"] 
  [Text] What is your view of this highly important document 
for the future of Russia and Russia's citizens? The following 
answer this question: 
  Sergey Shakhray, Russian Federation [RF] Government vice 
premier and leader of the Party of Russian Unity and Accord: 
  If there were no political confrontation in society, if it 
had traditions to ensure the automatic operation of the 
Constitution, and if the mechanisms of juducial power were in 
operation, there would have been no need to devise this 
document. But we have a very acute form of political 
confrontation, a profound socioeconomic crisis, and a lack of 
institutions of power, including judicial power, capable of 
defending civil rights and peace in society. There is therefore 
no alternative to the Treaty on Social Accord. 
  Petr Filippov, head of the RF Presidential Administration's 
Information Support Administration: 
  It would be the height of naivete to expect the Treaty to be 
signed by all the opposing forces. The Treaty is a text that 
will enable public opinion to identify those people who are in 
fact in favor of settling disputes by means of civil war. If 
there are two major political camps in the country that switch 
to hostilities without finding a compromise, that is a 
catastrophe. But Russia is not threatened by that situation 
today. However, if the chance of accord is missed, that will 
postpone and complicate the positive economic changes in the 
country. 
  Economist Pavel Bunich: 
  A host of reservations can be made about the text of the 
Treaty, but they can be made throughout life, till the end. The 
Treaty is a fairly realistic basis for further work. 
  Georgiy Satarov, RF presidential aide: 
  Any democracy has two foundation stones. The first one being 
the Constitution and the laws, the second -- political culture 
and political traditions. Permanent mechanisms for accord will 
train us in normal political culture. When we speak of the 
Treaty's tasks, we bear in mind the second foundation stone, 
which is based on democracy and the culture of seeking accord 
and compromise.

<F P=106> [Article by Federation Council deputy Oleg Smolin: "Trap Is </F>
Ready"] 
  [Text] There is no denying that everyone in Russia has 
grown tired of political "talking shops." And the tanks firing 
on the parliament building, Russian officers firing on Russian 
deputies, are still before many people's eyes. Yearning for 
civil peace and a normal, calm life in society is undoubtedly 
growing. That is why April's main domestic political event was 
the discussion of the "treaty on social accord" proposed in the 
president's name. 
  From the formal legal viewpoint the draft clearly does not 
stand up to criticism. Primarily what is disputed is the 
proposed "signatories" -- those acceding to the agreement. Of 
course if they want to political parties and social and 
religious organizations and trade unions can take part in this 
matter if they want.... But the state? What its role is is 
unclear. If the proposed agreement reiterates the Constitution 
then there is no need for it. There is still less need for it 
if it goes beyond the framework of the Constitution. 
  Let me be frank. I have never been a supporter of the former 
constitution, which was not democratic enough. Still less am I 
a supporter of the present, entirely authoritarian constitution. 
The history of all kinds of unconstitutional agreements did not 
begin today and should seemingly have taught us something. An 
imperfect law is better than any lawlessness. 
  If the Federation COuncil and the State Duma want to express 
their support for civil peace, then let them adopt the relevant 
appeal to the Russian peoples, political movements, religions, 
and organs of power, including the president himself. 
  The facts make us doubt how seriously the authors of the 
proposed agreement on accord are treating not only the 
Constitution but also the agreement itself. Let me remind you 
that article 5 of the Constitution stipulates the equality of 
the components of the Federation as regards the federal organs 
of power. The proposed draft agreement proposes a moratorium on 
the conclusion of bilateral treaties on the demarcation of 
powers between these organs and components. But what is 
actually happening? 
  At the same time a treaty is being successfully concluded 
between the Russian Federation and Tatarstan and the preparation 
of a similar treaty with Chechnya is being announced. The 
assessment of their expediency is a separate issue. But the 
talks run counter to the Constitution and the draft agreement. 
That is a medical fact, as they say. And will the agreement's 
initiators punish themselves for violating it? And now? 
  On the social plane the document also gives rise to doubts. 
Some agreement is being proposed "for everyone's attention." 
The need to base it only on mutual concessions is perfectly 
obvious. But the draft contains no real steps to meet the 
demands of the "dissenters." For instance, trade unions are 
given the duty of renouncing the organization of strikes 
connected with the redistribution of budget funds. It would 
seem that they might expect in response a promise to step up 
social guarantees for hired workers. Nothing of the kind! The 
president and government are "tossing" into the Duma a draft 
budget which can only be assessed as antisocial, anti-education, 
and anticulture. At a joint session of the State Duma and 
Federation Council committees studying questions of education, 
science, and culture, in my presence it was decided to vote 
against the draft budget. And how could they do otherwise? 
  The president is not fulfilling his own edict no. 1. The 
government is not fulfilling the president's edict and the 
Russian Federation legislation on education and culture. My 
conscience does not permit me to urge my colleagues who are 
workers in education to abandon the struggle for their 
legitimate demands by all legal means. The signing of the 
agreement for the trade unions is tantamount to political 
suicide! 
  A general political assessment should be based on the 
feasibility or otherwise of the practical embodiment of the idea 
involved. And so the country has been presented not with a 
declaration on the mutual accord of the political forces but 
with a protocol on universal agreement with the president! 
Instead of uniting the country is now split into two camps: 
those who agree with accord and those who do not. I do not 
rule out the possibility that after the agreement has been 
signed there will be a persecution of the "dissenters." 
"Penalties" are already envisaged for them in the document. 
  If the president's side is really thinking of civil peace 
and 
not of propaganda campaigns it should suggest to the opposition 
real countersteps: a new course in the economy, a government of 
national trust in politics. Otherwise the draft is a noose. 
The opposition should use it to tie its own hands, leaving its 
opponents complete freedom of maneuver. 
  Without a new economic course and a government of national 
trust a pact on civil accord in Russia is either another Utopian 
idea or a trap for all those who disagree with their country's 
destruction.

  [Text] Moscow April 28 TASS -- Russia's Federation Council 
sent an appeal to President Boris Yeltsin on Thursday, approving 
his address to the Federal Assembly on strengthening the Russian 
state and basic guidelines of the domestic and foreign policy. 
  The appeal said that the council has thoroughly studied the 
address and "welcomes the president's will" to "continue the 
course of reform." It said "We consider the memorandum of civic 
peace and accord as an important step towards implementing the 
president's address." 
  The Federation Council supported Yeltsin's proposals to set 
up a joint constitutional commission and a joint working group 
to coordinate and increase the effectiveness of law-making in 
Russia. 
  The upper house also supported other initiatives and 
proposals outlined by the president in his address. 
  "Stressing our strong agreement with the spirit and the 
letter of the address, the Federation Council appeals to the 
president and the Government of the Russian Federation with an 
urgent request to ensure strict observance of the provisions and 
norms of the popularly-adopted Constitution of the Russian 
Federation, the federation treaty and Russian laws, and create 
favourable conditions for unswerving implementation of these 
provisions and norms," the appeal said.

<F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS correspondent Mikhail Kolesnichenko] </F>
  [Text] New York, 29 Apr (ITAR-TASS) -- There is no danger 
of a fresh coup attempt in Russia. Russian Federation President 
Boris Yeltsin expressed confidence of this in an interview with 
the American ABC television network. There is, of course, 
opposition but it is weak, he said. It consists of nothing more 
than small groups. All state and administrative structures -- 
the army, internal troops, the Ministry of Internal Affairs -- 
are on the president's side. People have now changed. B. 
Yeltsin pointed out that he foresees no situation in which he, 
as president, could not control the situation in the country. 
  Asked whether the idea of retiring has occurred to him, the 
Russian leader said that he has thought of this, but "each time 
I found myself remembering how much I still have to do before 
June 1996." Asked about his long-term plans, B. Yeltsin merely 
said that his aides advise him to stop saying that he will not 
seek reelection. 
  During a discussion of international problems the Russian 
president was asked: "Are you not shocked, as many others 
throughout the world are, by the ethnic cleansing being carried 
out by Serbs in Bosnia?" "Not only am I shocked," B. Yeltsin 
replied, "I condemn the Serbs for not keeping their word." At 
the same time he expressed hope that a situation in which Serb 
positions would be subjected to fresh air strikes will not 
arise. "We have a partnership with the United States. Even if 
there are areas over which we disagree, we still must not react 
brusquely to them or conduct a dialogue from a position of 
strength," the Russian leader added. 
  In another part of the program he was asked about his 
health. 
"I am a healthy man," B. Yeltsin said. "This problem is being 
brought up by the opposition, especially the communists. They 
simply want to spoil my mood."

<F P=106> [Russian Federation Foreign Intelligence Service Press </F>
Bureau report on "Speech by B.N. Yeltsin at Meeting with 
Leadership and Staff of Russian Foreign Intelligence Service": 
"Rights and Duties of Intelligence Officers"] 
  [Text] Russia is currently going through one of the most 
crucial stages in the formation of its statehood, the Russian 
Federation president said. 
  The Constitution has been adopted by a nationwide vote. The 
country has received the legal basis for continuing its profound 
economic and political transformations and for organizing normal 
activity by state institutions. 
  One of the main tasks today is to expand the Russian 
Federation's legislative infrastructure and develop the 
mechanisms for cooperation among power structures at federal, 
regional, and local level. 
  Without this we will be unable to resolve Russia's numerous 
problems or to overcome the economic crisis. 
  Our state is obliged to ensure stability and to guarantee 
the 
security of the country and of citizens. That is why it must be 
strong. 
  The Foreign Intelligence Service [FIS] is directly involved 
in solving this problem. 
  Some two or so years ago the decision was made to split the 
former KGB into separate services. Serious reform of the 
Russian special services began. A number of fundamental issues 
have been successfully settled. 
  For the first time in its history Russia has a law on the 
foreign intelligence service. A statute on the FIS has been 
ratified. Thus, a firm legal base has been provided for your 
activities. Guarantees have been created for the legal status 
of and social support for intelligence officers and for the 
confidentiality of information about them. 
  The necessary reorganization has been carried out. A number 
of new subunits have been set up. Important steps have been 
taken within the FIS structure in the direction of greater 
openness on the part of the intelligence service toward society. 
Taking account of specific situations, of course. 
  The recently adopted Constitution has consolidated the new 
procedure for regulating the questions of safeguarding the 
state's security. These come under the exclusive jurisdiction 
of the federal authorities. Leadership of the relevant organs 
is provided by the president. 
  The FIS too is directly subordinate to the president. The 
supreme purpose of Russia's foreign intelligence is to serve 
Russia's national and state interests. We will be strengthening 
the service and enhancing the prestige of those who work for it. 
This is not only the president's principled view, it is my 
policy. 
  The country's leadership has a clear and unambiguous opinion 
-- at a time when military budgets are being cut, intelligence 
information is becoming a most important guarantee of security. 
This means that the role of intelligence should and will 
increase. 
  Extensive use is made of the methods of secret diplomacy in 
the practice of international relations. 
  We should be able to look under the cover of these secrets 
so 
as not to be caught napping. 
  Your service has direct access to the Russian leadership, 
and 
this means it is obliged to supply it with objective, 
up-to-the-minute, and full information. 
  I must say that the FIS has a high reputation within the 
system of Russian state power. I expect that henceforth your 
operational information, analytical conclusions, and 
recommendations will receive only high assessments. 
  The time when the intelligence service's merits were mainly 
measured by how vigorously it served ideological precepts and 
expanded zones of ideological influence on different continents 
is a thing of the past. 
  We expect foreign intelligence to produce the intelligence 
information needed for the adoption of fundamental state 
decisions on the issues of Russia's foreign and domestic policy, 
the implementation of our economic policy, and the securing of 
scientific and technical progress. 
  I am well aware that the FIS has probably never faced a more 
complex period than it does at present. And this is determined 
above all by the present-day international situation. 
  Its main feature is the scale and high speed of the changes 
which are continuously complicating an already complex world. 
  The vector of world development is, on the whole, favorable 
for Russia, but we should bear in mind that its direction can 
change. The world is at a crossroads, largely because one of the 
greatest powers -- Russia -- is in transition. 
  You know just as well as I that there are forces abroad 
which 
would like to keep Russia in a state of controlled paralysis. 
But I am convinced that only a strong, democratic, and 
prosperous Russian state will be a factor in helping the world 
acquire a new outlook. Making Russia just such a factor is our 
common task. 
  The period of global confrontation in international politics 
is over, but its inertia is still strong. The Cold War has left 
behind a smattering of burning and smoldering conflicts. The 
norms of international law are proving difficult to assert. 
Strong-arm military factors could be brought into play at any 
time. 
  The priority task for the FIS is to anticipate problems 
which 
the state may encounter in the immediate and more distant 
future. Consequently, intelligence should be one of the leading 
think tanks for stabilizing the situation in the world and for 
averting any threats to Russia's national security. 
  We are improving the activeness of Russian foreign policy 
and 
doing the groundwork for the 21st century. 
  Relations between Russia and the Western countries have been 
improving radically of late. We have achieved a level of 
partnership with some of these countries. But now it is 
particularly important to differentiate between partnership and 
attempts to dominate us and to impose on us actions that run 
counter to Russia's interests. This is unacceptable to us. 
  The fundamental point in Russia's military and foreign 
policy 
doctrines is that they view no state as an enemy. This approach 
should also underpin Russia's intelligence doctrine. 
  We have concluded important arms reduction agreements and we 
want to be confident that our partners are strictly observing 
them. It is the intelligence service's constant duty to issue 
warnings about attempts to create [o popytkakh sozdaniya] new 
types of weapons or about breakthroughs by other countries 
[otryv drugikh stran] in the military-technical sphere. 
  This is all the more important because the majority of 
countries working on the development [sozdaniye] of nuclear and 
other types of weapons of mass destruction are located 
relatively close to Russia. Our direct duty is to prevent any 
escalation of this danger and to avoid it turning into a direct 
threat to Russia. 
  Russia has its own view of its foreign and domestic policy 
priorities, and it has its own interests in the international 
arena. This is graphically visible in the settlement of the 
Bosnian crisis, and in our actions in nearby foreign countries 
and on other issues. 
  Recently we have clearly seen that this activeness on 
Russia's part sometimes gives rise to irritation. A clear 
illustration of this is the political campaign over the 
so-called "Ames affair." The real motives and goals of this 
anti-Russian action have clearly political overtones. U.S. 
intelligence is stepping up its efforts to acquire agents in 
Russia. But the U.S. special services believe that the FIS and 
its military counterparts have no right to act in the same way. 
  I can assure you that Russia does not intend to put up with 
this kind of discrimination any more. We are prepared to take 
every measure provided for by international law in order to 
rectify the situation. 
  Russia advocates equal and mutually advantageous cooperation 
and mutual respect. And I believe that our partners will learn 
to take our position into account. 
  I see the occasional outbreaks of nervousness as evidence of 
a gradual recognition of the fact that the newly independent 
states are areas of vital interest to Russia [novoye 
nezavisimoye gosudarstvo -- zona zhiznennykh interesov Rossii]. 
  We want there to be a zone of stability, mutually 
advantageous cooperation, and good-neighborliness around the 
perimeter of the Russian border. And nobody can rebuke us for 
that. 
  We are interested in stepping up integration processes 
within 
the CIS framework and we are striving to play a more active role 
in them. 
  It is no secret that certain politicians in the West see 
this 
as evidence of a revival of Russia's former imperial ambitions. 
  We can clearly see that this far-fetched thesis is being 
used 
to artificially exacerbate relations between the CIS and Baltic 
countries and Russia. Some of the newly independent states are 
also trying to derive an advantage for themselves. They are 
rushing to demonstrate their readiness to accept dubious 
proposals from outside [so storony]. 
  The FIS faces the crucial task of acquiring preemptive 
information on the corresponding plans and intentions of the 
leading Western countries in respect of our neighbors. And of 
providing timely proposals for neutralizing schemes of this kind. 
  Rejecting the concept of "global" and "total" intelligence, 
it is necessary above all to systematically monitor the 
situation along the entire perimeter of our borders. 
  Russia faces near its borders a direct threat from armed 
conflicts which threaten here and there to spill over into 
Russian territory. A great deal of effort will be needed to 
find ways to neutralize conflict situations in adjacent 
countries. 
  The intelligence service is obliged to expose in good time 
the driving forces behind each conflict and the potential for a 
political, compromise settlement. 
  Guarantees for Russians living in neighboring countries are 
a 
special issue. We will vigorously protect their interests in 
the Baltic countries and in other states. 
  We need profound and accurate assessments of foreign states' 
attitudes to Russia itself and to the processes taking place in 
it. It is important to expose and skillfully thwart any 
attempts to influence the situation in our country from outside. 
All the more so if these actions are aimed at stepping up 
disintegration processes. 
  International financial and economic support for our country 
is a special issue. I have already said and I repeat that we do 
not reject it but nor are we linking the fate of reform to 
foreign support. 
  Intelligence can also make a weighty contribution to 
safeguarding Russia's economic security. It is far more 
important for Russia's economic interests to ensure free access 
to other countries' markets for goods and other Russian 
products. The solution of this problem is an important task for 
both our foreign policy and our intelligence service. 
  Organized crime has already gone beyond the confines of the 
country and is establishing links with European and U.S. 
criminal clans. The intelligence service and Russian law 
enforcement organs must expose these links and prevent them 
becoming part of an established criminal system. 
  A useful role in combating global threats may be played by 
partnership ties with foreign special services. The FIS has 
such powers and, as is well known, is making successful use of 
them. The fact that you are organizing collaboration and 
exchanges of information in a number of areas -- the struggle 
against international terrorism, the illegal trade in 
radioactive substances, drug trafficking, organized crime, and 
so forth -- can only be welcomed. 
  In conclusion I would like to note that foreign intelligence 
should help to consolidate positive trends in Russia, in the 
world, and in relations with our new partners. 
  Under no circumstances should we leave any loopholes for 
those who are interested in our secrets or who are trying to 
infiltrate Russian state institutions. Firm barriers must be 
put in the way of that. In short, we expect a lot from you, as 
we do from your military counterparts. 
  The FIS is a special organization. Its ranks boast 
top-notch specialists with rare and valuable skills. People who 
have confirmed their lofty patriotism and devotion to Russia 
through their intensive work abroad are employed here. Your 
work requires exceptional efforts. For my part, I wish to 
assure you that the state will provide every possible support 
for the FIS. 
  All intelligence officers, wherever they may be, can be 
firmly confident that their homeland needs their work, and 
Russia will always show proper concern for them and their 
families.

  [Text] The Public Relations Center of the Federal 
Counterintelligence Service [FCS] is going to move to a new 
office, although within the same well-known building the service 
inherited from the NKVD-KGB-Security Ministry. The move has 
been prompted by an increase in the press group personnel and, 
therefore, the need to improve their working conditions. The 
specific location of the center's new office has not been 
disclosed yet, but it is known that its staffers will have 
spacious rooms and a separate entrance, something that will ease 
access to the bulwark of counterintelligence for journalists and 
other interested citizens. To whom it may concern: the center's 
telephone numbers will not change.

<F P=106> [Article by Irina Savvateyeva: "Counterintelligence Intends </F>
To Probe Officials. Why?"] 
  [Text] As the paper TRUD reported the other day, during a 
routine meeting between Boris Yeltsin and the staff of the 
Federal Counterintelligence Service (FCS), the president issued 
instructions for a probe of all officials of the president's 
apparatus, government apparatus, and all top power structures 
for corruption. 
  When approached by IZVESTIYA, the FCS refused point-blank to 
comment on the subject -- even to provide information on whether 
the "instructions" were verbal or in the form of a document. 
The FCS Public Relations Center announced that no one would 
talk with us about the president's directive. The actual FCS 
chief, Sergey Stepashin, perhaps... Stepashin's day was 
described as "very busy," of course -- today and in the 
immediate future. 
  But this report, made in passing, appears highly important 
and worthy of attention. And since there is no official 
informatiom to be had on the subject we will have to use 
guesswork. 
  Hypothesis number one. The president really is intent on a 
"shake-up" at the top in order to fight corruption. The fact 
that there are indeed things to combat militates in favor of 
this scenario. Moreover, this kind of activity brings political 
dividends: Fighters against corruption invariably enjoy public 
esteem. 
  But this tidy scenario is spoiled by the simple 
consideration 
that mass measures of a similar nature, embarked on on more than 
one occasion before, have generally got nowhere. They have been 
ineffective at any rate. And the people who thought up the 
latest "purge" are certainly aware of this. It occurs to one 
that these people had some special intention, somehwat different 
from the stated intention. What is it? 
  Hypothesis number two. 
  If one assumes that the president and his analysts are aware 
of the ineffectiveness of mass "purges," then one deduces that 
they are taking an interest not in all the "top structures of 
state power" but only a certain segment of them. 
  Analysts tend to believe that it is likely to be the 
government apparatus. To be precise, Chernomyrdin's immediate 
entourage. 
  The beginning of the year has clearly been marked by a 
strengthening of the premier's position. The January government 
reshuffle and the recent appointment of two new vice premiers 
graphically demonstrated the extent of the Cabinet of Ministers 
chief's independence. But the premier is finding a common 
language with parliament. At any rate, he is treated very 
fairly both in the Duma and in the Senate. His rating is 
steadily rising. 
  Observers point out that the "Gazprom" concern could be 
significantly strengthened in the very near future -- if it 
succeeds in taking over part of the infrastructure and some of 
the oil refineries in Ukraine which are seriously in debt to the 
Russian oil industry. Clearly, this will also strengthen the 
premier's positions. 
  If this scenario is correct, then, experts believe, the 
people bound up with the oil structures will have a claim to be 
"leading figures" in anticorruption cases. The reasoning behind 
this is that there have been more and more reports in the press 
of late about offenses being committed by those specializing in 
oil exports. According to this scenario, there will very 
probably be major oil scandals in the very near future. 
  It is also thought that currently influential vice premier 
Oleg Soskovets could also feature in Chernomyrdin's "oil" 
entourage. He had had a lot of oilmen "attacking" him of late. 
Suddenly all the "attacks" stopped, Soskovets turned out to be 
their friend, and even arranged for some benefits for the oilmen. 
  But there is also the suggestion that the cases of 
corruption 
will not result in serious scandals. The president's current 
instructions, made public quite deliberately in the media, will 
simply "frighten" certain people and do the job that way. 
Although it is not inconceivable that the fight against 
corruption could result in some government changes.

<F P=106> [By Crime Press correspondent Larisa Kislinskaya] </F>
  [Text] Moscow, 28 Apr--The forces maintaining public order 
over the Easter and 1 May holidays will be increased 
considerably, Militia Lieutenant General Vyacheslav Ogorodnikov, 
head of the chief directorate for the maintenance of public 
order of Russia's Ministry of Internal Affairs, told a Crime 
Press correspondent. 
  Reinforced detachments will be posted around cemeteries and 
churches where services and religious processions are to be 
held. Measures for maintaining public order will be in operation 
outside churches until six a.m., the finishing time for the 
religious processions. 
  Reinforced posts will be mounted on 1 May at sites of mass 
public demonstrations, rallies, and marches. According to our 
information, these include Triumphal Square, Tverskaya Street, 
Manezhnaya and Kaluzhkaya Squares, and the University Metro 
station area. 
  As Ogorodnikov emphasized, the maintenance of public order 
will be implemented entirely by Moscow militia forces. Ministry 
of Internal Affairs troops are only being kept in reserve should 
unforeseen circumstances arise.

<F P=106> [Article by lawyer Gennadiy Krasyukov: "May Day Coming: Be </F>
Vigilant!"] 
  [Text] Only recently the Russian and Moscow City Hall 
leadership took part in May Day celebrations with pleasure but 
later for some reason they lost interest in this holiday. 
Perhaps because their convictions changed or perhaps because 
they introduced their "own" holidays. 
  But as they say, if they do not want to take part in 
organized events themselves, they should not prevent others from 
doing so. Especially as by their inept activity they have 
brought millions of workers, employees, peasants, and 
intellectuals to an impoverished existence, deprived many of 
them of work, and now also want to deprive them of the 
opportunity at least to communicate occasionally. And this is 
being done in violation of the present very far from perfect 
Russian Federation Constitution, which they themselves signed 
and which they frenziedly urged working people to adopt and 
which they swore to observe. Article 31 of the Russian 
Federation Constitution clearly says: "Citizens o the Russian 
Federation have the right to assemble peacefully, without 
weapons, to hold gatherings, meetings, demonstrations, 
processions, and pickets." The same thing is said in article 20 
of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights approved and 
proclaimed by the UN General Assembly 10 December 1948. 
  Our executive power leadership does not tire of repeating 
that it respects international law and that it is a component of 
the Russian legal system. But words are often at odds with 
specific actions. It has become a rule for far-fetched pretexts 
to be used to forbid applicants to hold processions at all or to 
determine a route which can only be called an insult to citizens 
and their rights. 
  After the end of the notification and conciliation stage and 
immediately before the relevant date through the mass media and 
radio and television representatives of the city hall and other 
state services put various forms of psychological pressure on 
the organizers of and future participants in particular events 
staged by the opposition. And in addition to everything else 
even before the start of the meeting and procession large 
detachments supplied with bulletproof waistcoats, helmets, 
shields, rubber truncheons, and often weapons as well and 
detachments of the special militia and other militia subunits 
are brought in to the venues. Then various types of vehicles 
close nearly all adjacent streets and avenues. In general terms 
the meeting's participants are "surrounded" on all sides. 
  After the proclaimed "peace initiatives" allegedly aimed at 
civil accord in society, a hope appeared that there would be an 
improvement in the attitude toward the above-mentioned topic. 
But unfortunately everything is continuing according to the 
usual scenario. Again the city hall representatives have 
started haggling with representatives of the parties and 
movements over assigning a venue and the means for holding 
events to mark May Day. Again psychological pressure is 
beginning on those who are intending to take part in them. In 
particular on 14 April VECHERNYAYA MOSKVA published in a small 
note information to the effect that joint exercises by militia 
and special militia subunits involving a total of 1,500 men had 
been held on the territory of the "Luzhniki" sports complex 
under conditions as close as possible to combat conditions. 
They were rehearsing operations in the event of the outbreak of 
mass riots and all this was linked directly with the approaching 
May Day. 
  An even more alarming report was heard on that day on radio 
to the effect that it is intended to bring large special militia 
detachments from various regions into the capital in the next 
few days, allegedly to fight crime. 
  This report cannot fail to perturb Muscovites because many 
of 
them still have fresh in their memory the illegal actions of the 
out of town special militia members when, armed "to the teeth," 
they subjected unarmed and defenseless citizens to fierce 
beatings during the September-October events in Moscow. 
  If the question of sending the regional special militia to 
Moscow has already been resolved then a number of questions 
arise. From where will the special militia subunits come, how 
many will there be, how long will they stay, and where and 
against whom will they act? If it is to render aid to the 
Moscow militia in the struggle against crime then why are they 
being transferred on the threshold of the May Day holidays? 
Does that mean that previously the crime situation in the city 
was better than it is now, or is it that things are going well 
in the struggle against crime in the regions from which it is 
intended to send them to Moscow? 
  I suggest that the State Duma on the basis of the committees 
for security and legislation create a special commission which 
would monitor the political events in Moscow, the activity of 
the special militia, and other militia subunits. First of all 
it is essential to prevent their use by the authorities against 
the people's masses. Unfortunately we have grown accustomed to 
creating commissions after the event, that is when blood has 
already been shed, the public has already been aroused, and no 
culprits can be found. 
  The actual participants in the May Day events must display 
heightened vigilance and through their efforts ensure proper 
order and discipline during a possible procession. If 
provocateurs do appear it is essential to establish their 
identity and hand them over to the militia, finding out 
afterward what steps have been taken with regard to them. It 
would be useful if those who have them were to take cameras and 
video cameras with them so that they can film everything that 
happens and if necessary make use of what they have filmed. 
  Peace to May Day and a good mood for all Russia's citizens!

  [Text] On Thursday the speaker of the Russian State Duma 
Ivan Rybkin sent a letter to President Boris Yeltsin urging him 
to discuss the defense budget at the next session of the 
Security Council attended by representatives of the ministries 
of defense, finance and economics as well as the defense 
committee of the lower house of parliament. This was reported 
in an interview with Interfax by the chairman of the committee 
Aleksandr Piskunov. He also heads a working group for the 
classified part of the government-made draft of the federal 
budget which includes defense spending. 
  Piskunov said the need for addressing the president was 
prompted by the conclusions drawn by his group and by the 
Wednesday meeting with representatives of the leading munitions 
company Barrikady from Volgograd. 
  According to Piskunov, the working group compared government 
estimates concerning the defense budget for 1994 with actual 
spending during the first quarter. It discovered that during 
the first three months of the year the debt of the Defense 
Ministry to the defense industry increased from 2.1 to 4.7 
trillion rubles. 
  Proceeding from this it is suggested spending 55 trillion 
rubles on defence in 1994. In this case, Piskunov said, it 
would be possible to support the presidential proposal on 
spending ten percent of the defense budget on research and 
testing. Overall investments in the defence industry would then 
go up from 20.7 to 28 percent of the general volume of defense 
spending, which would be a return to the 1992 situation. 
  At the same time the working group invited the Defense 
Ministry to take emergency steps to stabilize the situation in 
the armed forces. According to Piskunov, this could be achieved 
through minimizing defense spending this year through stopping 
the contract system for privates and retired officers and 
changing the whole system of military training proceeding from 
actual needs. Besides, combat units should be fully staffed and 
their combat capability should be guaranteed by taking the 
remaining units into reserves or disbanding them.

<F P=106> [Report by Vladimir Seleznev: "Frontier Posts; Cossacks </F>
Appeal to the Russian President for Help"] 
  [Text] According to the Russian Federation Presidential 
Administration's Operational Information Center, a conference 
has been held on Staraya Ploshchad with the leaders of Cossack 
formations stationed in the territory of the Russian Federation. 
The conference was attended by representatives of the Union of 
Cossacks and the Union of Cossack Troops of Russia and Abroad. 
There was a detailed discussion on the Cossacks' problems and on 
the need to give Cossack formations independent state-legal 
status. 
  An appeal to Russian Federation President B. Yeltsin was 
adopted as a result of the discussion, in which the leaders of 
Cossack formations offered their own proposals to take the 
Cossacks to a new level of cultural, economic, and military 
development. The text of the document and the circumstances 
which made its appearance necessary were commented on by Comrade 
Ataman Vladimir Naumov from the Union of Cossacks, who took part 
in the conference: 
  "No legislative act concerning a state formation of the 
Cossacks has been properly implemented so far. The greatest 
concern is caused by time wasted developing the entire state 
service system, despite the fact that Cossack regions ensured 
the latest draft into the Russian Army. Cossack posts are being 
brought up to strength at the most dangerous points along the 
Russian border. Cossack communes have received their first few 
thousand hectares of land and have become a force capable of 
protecting Russia's borders. The Cossacks need state status in 
Russia, because their present status as a social organization 
has exhausted its possibilities. 
  "Meanwhile, some rather dubious organizations are operating 
on the land markets of the Don and the Kuban; they have already 
bought up considerable areas of land, while the Land Bank of 
Russia, which once backed Stolypin's agrarian reforms, does 
nothing. But the Cossacks will not serve without land. That is 
why it is necessary to finally adopt normative documents on a 
special procedure for Cossack land use, following on from the 
presidential edict `On the Regulation of Land Relations.' What 
is happening in the Don region and the Kuban could lead to 
social uproar. 
  "The situation is critical: There has now formed a potent 
mix of several former representatives of state services and 
criminal `authorities,' who have begun to pin all kinds of 
general's shoulder straps, sabers, and orders on one another. 
  "There are certain forces trying to set the Cossacks in 
opposition to the Russian state. Imposters are appearing: 
Laughable figures in Cossack uniform with a rich criminal past, 
promising everyone everything immediately in their quest for 
Cossack chieftainship. But, as historical experience shows, 
those who swear loyalty with excessive fervor are the first to 
betray you. 
  "Of course, many want power and the benefits that go with 
it, 
but giving power over paramilitary organizations to all and 
sundry is unwise, to say the least. This was clearly 
demonstrated by the scandalous meeting in Omsk in January. 
  "The president of Russia has clearly said that Russia is a 
great country, and the Union of Cossacks is prepared to do state 
service for the good of a great Russia. 
  "With the power of the center weakened, only the full 
development of state service will make it possible to end the 
oppression of the Cossacks in the North Caucasus, Tataria, 
Khakasia, and the former Soviet republics. Unfortunately, the 
State Duma's draft laws have yet to note the special status of 
Russia's border regions and the stabilizing role which the 
Cossacks could play. Very many new faces have recently appeared 
in the parliamentary arena, but will state wisdom finally appear 
in the State Duma? The Cossack villages of Taldy Kurgan have 
been blockaded for more than a week now, and there are other 
deplorable examples. Every opportunity must be taken to protect 
the Russian population. It is dangerous to delay. In our view, 
the first step must be to set up a state committee for Cossack 
affairs under the government."

<F P=106> [Article by Natalya Davydova: "The Ministry Responsible For </F>
the Future"] 
  [Text] Under the new Constitution, we all have the right 
to a healthy environment and reliable information on its 
condition. The president's recent message to the Federal 
Assembly "On Strengthening the Russian State" laid special 
emphasis on the duty of all organs of power to create conditions 
conducive to improving the environment. After all, 
environmental safety is an integral part of Russia's national 
security. For a long time our country fought vigorously with 
nature, subjugated it, and transformed it, and now the time has 
come to settle the accounts. We are paying with our health and 
the future of our children. If we were to calculate the 
monetary equivalent, ecologists estimate that our country would 
need fantastic sums of money to bring the environment up to 
Western standards. Many readers write and ask who exactly in 
Russia watches over citizens' constitutional right to clean 
water, air, and soil. The question is more than relevant. 
Everyone has heard of the "Green" movement, "Kedr," and similar 
social organizations, but we also have state structures. How 
many are there, what do they do, and what are their 
responsibilities? We will discuss this under our new rubric, 
"Nature and Power." 
  The Russian Federation now has an established system of 
bodies responsible for environmental protection: a federal 
ministry, territorial subdivisions for the protection and 
rational use of natural resources, and a number of state bodies 
whose functions include monitoring and inspecting the use of 
certain natural resources and pollution of the environment: the 
State Committee for Sanitary and Epidemiological Supervision; 
committees for land resources and land management, geology and 
the use of mineral resources, fisheries, and water resources; a 
federal service for hydrometeorology and monitoring of the 
environment; and a federal forestry service. 
  A Higher Environmental Council is being formed in the State 
Duma. In addition, a Council for Environmental Policy has been 
set up under the Russian Federation president, and the Russian 
Federation Security Council has an interdepartmental commission 
for environmental safety. The General Prosecutor's Office has a 
department for supervising implementation of environmental 
protection legislation. In fact, there are special subdivisions 
responsible for environmental protection in the organizational 
structures of every branch of power. 
  We will start by acquainting ourselves with the country's 
main environmental department: the Ministry for Protection of 
the Environment and Natural Resources. 
  It enjoys the status of a federal ministry in the structure 
of organs of executive power approved by presidential edict in 
January. However, the work of the ministry, whose objectives 
are incorporated in its name, is not very well known to a broad 
audience. Moreover, the social status of our environmental 
department does not correspond to the status of similar 
structures in Western countries. 
  The structure of the ministry's central apparatus is as 
follows. The leadership forms the upper level. Below are the 
main administrations: environmental expert assessment; mineral 
reserves; science and technology; environmental safety; use of 
natural resources; environmental programs; nature reserves; 
natural biological resources; international cooperation; legal 
normative regulation; financing and development of materials and 
equipment; protection of the atmosphere; protection of the water 
table; the environmental protection maritime service; protection 
of soil and land resources; and protection of the environment 
from industrial and consumer waste. 
  A federal environmental fund and a public reception center 
are attached to the ministry. As a whole, the structure of the 
central apparatus corresponds to the main areas of environmental 
protection activity. There are also shortcomings typical of 
state bodies in our country: the organization and 
administration department, for example, whose staff is more than 
double that of far more important subdivisions. I should point 
out for the sake of objectivity, however, that it is proposed to 
improve the ministry's structure. 
  Protection of the environment is one of the main national 
priorities of developed countries, where state environmental 
services have been in operation for decades. In our country, 
however, the environmental department is still in its infancy, 
as the RSFSR State Committee for Nature Protection was set up 
only in 1988; this was later transformed into a ministry, and 
the law "On Protection of the Environment," which is essentially 
the basis of the ministry's activity, came into effect only in 
1992. Our main environmental protection department has 
undergone several reorganizations in the last five years, 
apparently whenever the ministry has been finding its feet and 
starting to monitor monopolistic departments responsible for 
pollution. Clearly, such reorganizations are not conducive to 
resolving environmental problems at state level and prevent the 
environmental protection department from fulfilling its basic 
tasks. 
  The Ministry for Protection of the Environment and Natural 
Resources should be responsible for general coordination of the 
activity of ministries, departments, enterprises, institutions, 
and organizations in the field of protection of the environment 
and natural resources; conduct an integrated science and 
technology policy in this sphere; develop and improve economic, 
legal, and administrative mechanisms for the use of natural 
resources; organize and set in motion state commissions of 
environmental experts; and much more. 
  The ministry has a sufficiently sound research base: Under 
its jurisdiction it has more than 20 institutes and centers, 
whose main function is to form science and technology policy in 
the field of environmental protection. In addition, it can 
enlist the scientific potential of the Russian Academy of 
Sciences and state universities. 
  The ministry draws up specially targeted environmental 
programs. The best known is the federal science and technology 
program entitled "Russia's Environmental Safety," the drafting 
and implementation of which have had strong repercussions in 
environmental circles. Environmental protection problems are 
also reflected in other major programs: "The Revival of the 
Volga," "The Oka -- a Clean River," "Waste," "Conversion -- 
Ecology," "Radon," "Dioxins," and others. 
  First Deputy Minister Professor A.F. Poryadin has 
highlighted 
the following priority areas of the ministry's activity: First, 
it is vital to secure legislative and normative support for 
environmental protection activity and to adopt a complex of laws 
and legally binding acts in this sphere. The law "On Protection 
of the Environment" has undoubtedly played a positive role, but 
it is impossible to improve the environment in Russia without 
the system of environmental legislation that exists in Western 
countries. Second, there must be financial and economic support 
for environmental protection activity, so that the thin, 
constantly interrupted stream of budget funding is augmented by 
resources received on the basis of the principle "there are no 
free natural resources" and "polluters must pay." Finally, 
optimum organizational and structural support based on Russia's 
specific features will have considerable importance for the 
efficiency of all environmental protection activity in our 
country. There is no developed system of organization and 
collaboration between all the structures functioning in the 
environmental protection sphere. There are no clear 
responsibilities, while at the same time, for example, 
territorial environmental protection bodies are subordinate to 
the ministry, on the one hand, and to the local administration, 
on the other. In such cases there is always "confusion and 
hesitation," financial complications, a lack of responsibility, 
and the possibility of arbitrariness. 
  Ecology is part of the economy and politics, so drawing up a 
strategy in the environmental protection sphere is the state's 
prerogative. In this sense, the recent presidential edict "On 
the State Strategy of the Russian Federation To Protect the 
Environment and Ensure Its Stable Development" is more than 
topical. Having said that, it will require colossal efforts -- 
mainly on the part of the Ministry for Protection of the 
Environment and Natural Resources and territorial environmental 
protection bodies -- to achieve a breakthrough in the 
environmental situation in our country. 
  We will continue to acquaint you with various environmental 
protection structures and talk about their work and the problems 
facing them in coming issues.

  [Text] Moscow April 28 TASS -- Russia's commission on human 
rights is preparing a report on human rights in Russia which 
will be presented to President Boris Yeltsin. 
  The commission, set up by the president after the October 
1993 revolt in Moscow, will inform him about human rights abuses 
in the country, commission chairman Sergey Kovalev said on 
Thursday. 
  The commission plans to finish a national human rights 
programme by the end of May. The programme has been developed 
in cooperation with the Russian Foreign Ministry. The 
commission also handles complaints about violations of civil 
rights. 
  Kovalev, who has been appointed by the State Duma a 
commissioner on human rights, said that a draft law regulating 
the status, rights and duties of the commissioner on human 
rights is now being discussed in the Duma Committee for 
Legislation. 
  He believes that after the law has been adopted, the 
commission on human rights will have to continue working in 
order to keep the president informed about human rights in 
Russia.

<F P=106> [Report by Oleg Savelyev of the All-Russia Center for the </F>
Study of Public Opinion on Social and Economic Questions: 
"Today Russians Would Vote Differently to 12 December"] 
  [Text] As the date of the elections to the Federal 
Assembly recedes, the discrepancy between the actual deeds of 
the various blocs and parties represented in the State Duma and 
the promises which they lavished during the election campaign is 
becoming increasingly obvious. 
  In order to measure trust in the political blocs and 
parties, 
the following question was posed during an opinion poll 
conducted recently by the All-Russia Center for the Study of 
Public Opinion among approximately 4,000 Russians from a 
representative sample of the adult population of the Russian 
Federation. If elections to parliament were held next Sunday, 
for which bloc or party would you vote in these elections? The 
answers to this question were distributed (in percentages) as 
follows:

  The Communists and Agrarians had the most stable supporters

supporters of Travkin's party (44 percent) and the "Women of 
Russia" political bloc (35 percent) showed the least constancy.

<F P=106> [Article by Doctor of Legal Sciences Vladimir Pustogarov, </F>
leading scientific associate of the Russian Academy of Sciences 
Institute of State and Law, carried under the "Authority of the 
Regions" rubric: "Without Guidelines: No One Regulates the 
Components of the Federation's International Ties"] 
  [Text] The republics, krays, and oblasts of the Russian 
Federation are exhibiting ever-increasing autonomy today. 
Yaroslavl Oblast, for example, has concluded treaties (mainly 
economic in nature) with Belarus, Kazakhstan, Moldova, 
Uzbekistan, Ukraine, individual regions of Turkey and Germany, 
and certain other foreign partners. Yaroslavl Oblast has signed 
a total of more than 20 such treaties. 
  Tatarstan and Bashkiria have equally extensive international 
ties. Yakutia's trade and economic agreement with Ukraine, 
signed at the end of 1993, extends over five years and embraces 
a broad range of items. Yakutia reportedly plans to conclude an 
agreement with Japan and open a trade mission there. 
  What is the significance of such large-scale treaty activity 
on the part of Federation members? Primarily it meets the needs 
of regions "neglected" by the federal authorities in their 
relations with other states. 
  Some rules have gradually been elaborated governing the 
international activity of Federation components. For all their 
disparateness, they have quite a lot in common. First and 
foremost, Federation components should be guided by the 
principles and standards of international law and the 
international commitments of the Federation, they should operate 
within their constitutional authority and in agreement with 
federal executive authority, and they should refrain from 
encroaching on the sphere of diplomatic and consular rights. 
  For us, however, international ties are a new venture both 
for republics and oblasts -- indeed for all 89 components of the 
Russian Federation. We are only just beginning to get familiar 
with this new kind of activity. The Russian Federation's 
components still have to learn the rules accepted throughout the 
world and make them tally with their own interests. The task is 
clearly no easy one: The overwhelming majority of components 
have neither the experience nor the trained cadres. Moreover, 
they do not have the legal guidelines to follow when embarking 
on a largely unknown path. 
  But the problem is that the Russian Federation's components 
are unable to rely sufficiently on the existing Constitution 
when structuring their foreign activity, as the Constitution 
fails to mention the components' actual right to pursue 
international ties. This right is obliquely referred to in 
Article 72, where "the coordination of the international and 
foreign economic ties of Russian Federation components " falls 
within areas of joint jurisdiction. If we are talking about 
coordinating international ties, then the right to establish and 
develop them also exists. However, this sole provision cannot, 
naturally, regulate the entire large and complex system of 
international ties involving Russia's components. 
  Consulting the Federation Treaty is of little avail in this 
regard either. The only additional information to be gleaned 
from it is that the components of the Russian Fedeartion are 
"autonomous parties in international and foreign economic ties." 
  "Autonomous party in international ties".... The wording 
looks very impressive, but on closer scrutiny its content is 
completely unclear. What specifically can a Federation 
component to develop its international ties? How does its 
autonomy square with the extensive powers enjoyed by the 
Federation in the sphere of international relations? Are these 
powers retained by Federation components? 
  Since all this is vaguely worded, it is not at all easy to 
identify the specific areas where Russian Federation components 
can operate as "autonomous participants in international ties." 
It is, of course, possible to cite the existing practice of 
certain republics and oblasts, but the question is whether this 
practice is congruous with the Constitution and existing 
legislation. 
  In other words, there is a large legal vacuum today which 
offers scope for the most arbitrary interpretations and thereby 
generates conflicts, as it were, both inside and outside the 
Federation. The fact that the development of Russian Federation 
components' international ties seems to be allowed to go its own 
sweet way could have the most adverse consequences for both the 
durability of the Federation and the integrity of its external 
relations.

<F P=106> [From the "Diplomatic Panorama" feature: Reports by </F>
Diplomatic Correspondents Igor Porshnev, Vitaliy Trubetskoy, and 
others] 
  [Text] The arrest of a leading member of Kazakhstan's 
Russian speaking community, Boris Suprunyuk, gave rise to 
"serious concern" in Moscow, a spokesman for Russia's Foreign 
Ministry, Grigoriy Karasin, said at Thursday's briefing. 
  According to him, his ministry has already requested 
Kazakhstan's Foreign Ministry to inform it urgently of what 
Suprunyuk is charged with, as well as of investigation and other 
actions taken against him. 
  As Karasin said, Alma Ata [Almaty] "has resorted to the 
thesis that Suprunyuk must be subjected to psychiatric 
examination." "This cannot fail to evoke memories of the 
notorious methods of combating dissent. Nevertheless we hope 
that the Kazakh authorities will display an objective and 
unbiased approach, that they will be guided by their commitments 
in the area of human rights, including those made in the 
framework of the CSCE," Karasin said.

<F P=106> [Rustam Arifdzhanov report: "Yet Another Oil Company Lowers </F>
Its Prices In Order To Increase Its Survival Chances"] 
  [Excerpts] The second largest Russian oil company -- 
"Yukos" -- has decided to lower its prices of petroleum products 
for Central Russian farmers until 15 June. This decision was 
made following a tour of eight Russian agrarian oblasts by the 
company's president, Sergey Muravlenko. The necessary quantity 
of petroleum products for the sowing campaign has already been 
dispatched to the regions. 
  There is quite a serious subtext to this -- at first sight, 
paradoxical and populist -- decision. Around one month ago 
another oil giant -- "Lukoyl" -- resorted to the same step, 
lowering its prices for three months. The oil companies' 
decision is in many ways to be explained by the nonpayments 
crisis. The consumer debt to "YUKOS" already amounts to more 
than 500 billion rubles. The three biggest debtors are 
agrarians, metallurgical workers, and the military-industrial 
complex. [passage omitted] 
  Contracts have been signed with agrarians on barter exchange 
-- petroleum products for agricultural produce. Companies 
require at least some kind of guarantee that their product will 
be paid for. Otherwise, if there is a repeat of last year's 
nonpayments crisis, the oil industry will be ruined. 
  The threat of the breakup or reorganization of companies is 
compeling them to adopt various counter tactics. The spring 
price reductions are unexpected only at first glance. In the 
face of the threat of a return to the times of state monopoly 
and state control, oil companies are showing that the market 
mechanism allows one to act swiftly and flexibly in the oil 
industry too.

"The Government Presidium Has Decided To Fight Forest Fires and 
Trade in Wool. Discussion of Situation in Russia's Economy Has 
Been Postponed"] 
  [Text] The latest session of the Russian Federation 
Government Presidium yesterday began with Prime Minister Viktor 
Chernomyrdin proposing that it not discuss the implementation of 
the Council of Ministers resolution On the Situation of the 
Russian Economy and Prospects for Its Development for 1994 but, 
"owing to its special importance," devote to this subject a 
special session set tentatively for 3 May. Therefore the 
ministers had to consider a draft federal program titled 
Reducing the Level of Radiation of Russia's Population and 
Production Personnel from Natural Radioactive Sources in 
1994-1996 (radon program) and map out urgent measures to protect 
forests and reindeer pasture lands as well as preserve the sheep 
breeding and processing industry. 
  There are two federal programs in Russia to protect forests 
from fire and on reforestation, said Valeriy Shubin, chief of 
the Russian Federation Forestry Service, but due to a shortage 
of funds preparations for the summer period "have practically 
been thwarted," in spite of the fact that some 600 pockets of 
forest fires (approximately 6,000 hectares) have been 
identified. The Forestry Service was to get 135 billion rubles 
this year to implement the programs, but so far has received 
only a small portion and managed to conclude contracts with only 
six out of 19 air units -- and even those have only 11 percent 
of the required fuel stocks. Mr. Shubin demanded, in addition 
to funds, the creation of a "rapid reaction" fire fighting 
reserve and to provide forestry employees with firearms and 
ammunition. The government presidium deemed these demands quite 
reasonable and decided to finalize the draft resolution on 
measures to protect forests and reindeer pastures from fires and 
present it for signing to the government in three days. 
  It was also decided to finalize and submit to government 
approval the radon program. To protect Russians from radiation 
(sources: radon gas and construction materials, primarily 
granite slates), whose aggregate dose exceeds by 300 times the 
level produced by the accident at the Chernobyl nuclear power 
station, the first stage of the program calls for research to be 
conducted, technological charts to be drawn up, and standards 
worked out. The second stage envisions a campaign of public 
awareness and training in methods of protection against natural 
radiation. The overall cost of the project is 41 billion 
rubles, including 20 billion from the federal budget. 
  The presidium related with full understanding also to the 
draft resolution moved by the Agriculture Ministry on urgent 
measures to preserve the domestic sheep breeding and processing 
industry. Vice Premier Aleksandr Zaveryukha said that the sheep 
population in Russia has been halved compared to 1990, while 
woolen fabric production has fallen by 80 percent. At the same 
time agricultural producers, according to him, cannot find a 
market for 60,000 tonnes of wool, to which amount the upcoming 
sheep shearing will add another 70,000 to 80,000 tonnes. 
Therefore Mr. Zaveryukha asked the government to help market 
the surplus wool because "this is a matter of survival for those 
Russian Federation ethnic groups that traditionally engage in 
sheep breeding." First Vice Premier Oleg Soskovets supported 
the country's number one agrarian and called on the ministers 
not to shun agrarian questions and "not stigmatize the agrarians 
as anti-marketeers, but let the Agro-Industrial Complex into the 
market."

<F P=106> [Yaroslav Shimov report: "President's Experts Hunt for </F>
Economic Idiocies" -- from the "Expert Analysis" section] 
  [Text] The Russian president's group of economics experts 
was organized in the fall of 1991 by Professor Igor Nit, now 
sadly deceased. For the first time academics who had contrived 
to study the problems of the market economy for several years in 
a country where official theory invariably coupled the word 
"market" with the term "capitalist," which had a universally 
negative sense, were included among the president's expert 
advisers. 
  The group was and remains very small: There are six people 
directly involved in work connected with the formation of 
economic policy. The majority are young people aged between 25 
and 40. In the words of the group's current leader, Doctor of 
Economic Sciences Aleksandr Livshits, two qualities serve as the 
criterion for the selection of experts: professionalism and 
personal integrity. Mr. Livshits calls his staffers "ammunition 
carriers," not, however, investing this term with any scorn. In 
the final analysis, no weapon will fire without shells. 
  The 47-year-old leader of the expert group has been in his 
current post for just six weeks. Before this, having graduated 
from the Plekhanov Institute of the National Economy, he spent 
many years in academic work. He devoted his doctoral 
dissertation to market problems -- to "Reaganomics," the economy 
policy of the U.S. Administration in the first half of the 
eighties. 
  The experts handle three things. First, "they support the 
president's current work on economic questions." To put it 
simplistically, they endeavor to make presidential edicts 
concerning the economy as rational and useful as possible. 
Second, they make short-term forecasts of the country's 
economic development. Third, they assess decisions on economic 
questions made by the president, the government, and the 
legislature. 
  Objections to these decisions arise among the experts quite 
frequently. One recent example is the issue of changing customs 
tariffs. On this score the expert group has its own opinion, 
which it will endeavor to bring to the president's notice. The 
experts also had a hand in B. Yeltsin's recent letter to V. 
Chernomyrdin and to the Federal Assembly and Central Bank 
leaders on the subject of the defaulting problem. 
  Although the expert evaluations do not always please 
everyone, the group's leader claims that there have been no 
significant conflicts between government structures and the 
experts. Relations with the State Duma are also developing just 
fine. 
  The president sees his own experts rarely. However, for them 
it is not personal contact with Boris Yeltsin that is of 
greatest significance but the frequency with which the president 
reads the analytical memoranda and other documents that the 
expert group sends him. After all, right now in Russia economic 
policy is above all the result of a struggle between powerful 
lobbies whose deep bass is capable of drowning out the quiet 
voice of the specialists. 
  However, on so important a document as the draft state 
budget 
the experts did manage to exert their influence. Their remarks 
and proposals were sent to B. Yeltsin in Sochi, where the 
president vacationed in March. In the words of Aleksandr 
Livshits, a significant number of these observations were taken 
on board by those who finalized the draft. As a result more 
attention was devoted in the budget to the social sphere. 
  The experts themselves are also people of flesh and blood, 
with their own prejudices in economics and politics. However, 
according to their own claims, the expert group endeavors to be 
as objective as possible, keeping within the limits of strictly 
economic calculations and forecasts. As for attempts to lobby 
the president via the experts, few have been made. The group 
leader refused to cite specific examples, referring to the fact 
that "the interests of the most diverse forces are mixed up in 
this business." 
  The Kremlin's comfortable offices dispose one to speculative 
constructs: Let us do such-and-such, they say, and rivers of 
milk and honey will flow from Moscow to the borders. 
Understanding this, the president's experts endeavor to behave 
fairly openly, meeting with a very wide variety of people. 
Among those who have visited them recently are "black-hands" 
(representatives of the independent mine workers' trade union), 
bankers, and farmers. Incidentally, most visitors complain that 
reforms, especially in the provinces, are at a standstill, and 
bureaucracy is as all-powerful as ever. 
  Apparatus traditions should be anathema to the president's 
analysts themselves, even though their group belongs to the 
Russian president's staff of aides. None of the Kremlin 
economics experts worked under old system with the state leaders 
who preceded B. Yeltsin. Overall, the chief of the expert group 
sums up his work as follows: "Perhaps we have not done so very 
much. I cannot say precisely that we have managed to save 
Russia from a mass of economic idiocies which might have been 
committed."

  [Text] Flight Control Centre (Moscow Region) April 29 TASS 
- Another space week is nearing completion for Viktor Afanasyev, 
Yuriy Usachev and Valeriy Polyakov aboard the Mir space station. 
  The flight programme for the last two days included 
geophysical and astrophysical investigations as well as routine 
servicing of some systems of the station and modules. 
  Using videospectrometric equipment installed on the 
stabilised platform of the Kvant-2 module, the cosmonauts made 
several snapshots of the Earth's surface. The main tasks of 
this work were investigations of the ecological situation in 
major industrial hubs and areas of oil and gas production. 
  To study further mechanisms of generation of elementary 
high- 
energy charged particles in the earth's radiation belts and 
near- earch space, the crew fulfilled several experiments with 
the use of a magnetic spectrometer. 
  Under a medical checkup plan, the ship commander and flight 
engineer will undergo an echographic investigation of the 
cardiovascular system on Friday under the supervision of the 
crew doctor. 
  The station's flight continues under a preset programme. The 
cosmonauts are healthy and feel well.

<F P=106> [Pavel Felgengauer report in the "Army" column: "Nuclear </F>
Warheads Return to Russia. Russian Missilemen Use Ukraine 
Equipment But Moscow Controls Nuclear Weapons in Any Event"] 
  [Text] Ukraine honors its obligations and is evacuating 
nuclear warheads to Russian in accordance with an earlier 
coordinated schedule, Colonel General Igor Sergeyev, commander 
in chief of the Strategic Missile Forces, told foreign military 
attaches in Moscow yesterday. By this time 180 Ukrainian 
warheads have arrived in Russia to Nuclear Industry Ministry 
installations for subsequent dismantling. In response the 
Russian nuclear department is shipping to Ukraine deliveries of 
fuel elements for Ukraine's nuclear power plants. 
  The planned withdrawal of missile regiments from Belorussia 
[Belarus] continues. On 28 March during a summit in Moscow 
Presidents Yeltsin and Nazarbayev signed an agreement on 
military cooperation and the status of strategic nuclear forces 
whereby missile divisions in Kazakhstan were moved under Russian 
Federation jurisdiction, and also coordinated a schedule for the 
evacuation to Russia of all nuclear warheads within 14 months. 
After that, within three years, all launchers and strategic 
missiles in Kazakhstan are to be abolished. The procedure for 
the abolition, however, has not so far been finalized (the 
details of the Russian-Kazakhstan nuclear agreement did not 
become known until recently). 
  The process of "nuclear divorce" of Russia with Ukraine, 
Belorussia, and Kazakhstan is proceeding amazingly smoothly. 
Yet problems remain: On 25 April General Staff Academy 
official Nikolay Kostin publicly expressed doubts about "the 
circle of people today possessing information about strategic 
arms command and control systems." 
  In response to SEGODNYA's correspondent, Gen. Sergeyev 
stated 
that in his troops "everything is under control." Should any 
attempt be made to reveal nuclear codes, emergency warning 
panels will flash in all related headquarters, including the 
General Staff. Maybe Kostin meant the warheads of the air-based 
strategic cruise missiles of the 45th Army stationed in Ukraine? 
  The equipment used to command and control strategic nuclear 
missiles was indeed manufactured in Kharkov. Russian 
specialists are apparently concerned over the possibility of 
leaks of strategic information from there (inducing to other 
foreign countries). Yet Gen. Sergeyev is calm because the 
control system's software is of Russian origin. "Without the 
software, the hardware is of little value," Mr. Sergeyev 
stressed. 
  Under the START I Treaty, 403 strategic missiles (including 
Ukrainian) and 302 launchers have been destroyed. Even so there 
are approximately 67 percent of domestic strategic carriers in 
the Strategic Missiles Forces (1,150 units, of which 350 are in 
neighboring states) and more than 75 percent of the Russian 
Federation's aggregate megaton charge.

<F P=106> [Unattributed photofeature: "Spring Draft: What Will </F>
Response Be?"] 
  [Text]Defense Ministry's Position 
  Major General Vasiliy Smirnov, deputy chief of the Russian 
Federation Defense Ministry's Main Organization and Mobilization 
Directorate: 
  "There have been no extra changes to the legislation under 
which the draft is organized. 
  "The right to a draft deferment is granted for the duration 
of a citizen's studies within the limits of the normative 
timetable for the assimilation of basic educational programs 
under the set standard provisions for state and municipal 
educational institutions...." 
  In other words, students at commercial nonstate higher 
educational establishments have no right to a deferment until 
the educational establishments receive their state accreditation! 
  It should be recalled that deferments are issued once only 
-- 
in order for people to complete their studies! If a student 
gives up his studies or merely transfers to another higher 
educational establishment, his deferment ends. Even if there is 
a military faculty at the new establishment. That is the law. 
  Currently there is no mechanism for implementing alternative 
service. This service is mentioned only in one place -- Article 
59 of the Russian Federation Constitution. But there are 
currently no other acts of legislation on this service (where it 
should take place, or what the mechanism for its implementation 
should be). 
<H5>  Legislators' Position </H5>
  The questions of the Russian Army draft are regulated by the 
law "On the Military Draft and Military Service" previously 
adopted by the Russian Federation Supreme Soviet. Subsequent 
changes relating to the military draft procedure were made to 
this law by a Russian Federation presidential edict. The State 
Duma's Defense Committee believes that, following the adoption 
of the new Constitution, the law should be brought into line 
with the fundamental law. The committee is now doing 
corresponding work in this area. Moreover, work is under way on 
a legislative substantiation of the constitutional provision on 
alternative service. Some draftees who refuse to be drafted on 
religious or other grounds are currently subject to criminal 
prosecution in the absence of an appropriate law. The scale of 
this phenomenon is such that, in the opinion of certain 
representatives of the Duma Committee for the Affairs of Public 
Associations and Religious Organizations, it is possible to talk 
about "prisoners of conscience" in this country -- which is a 
direct consequence of the lack of a federal law on alternative 
service. 
<H5>  Opinion of the Committee of Soldiers' Mothers </H5>
  "The law on education and the constitutionally guaranteed 
right to a professional education were violated last year," 
Valentina Melnikova, press secretary of the Committee of 
Soldiers' Mothers, says. "Edict No. 1573 `On the Military Draft 
of Russian Federation Citizens of Draft Age Studying By Day at 
Initial and Secondary Vocational Educational Establishments' was 
issued in October. The spring draft to the Army will again 
deprive many young people of an opportunity to get an education. 
And if this continues, then, in the opinion of sociologists and 
economists, the system of vocational and technical education in 
the country will be completely destroyed." 
  Independent Lawyer's View 
  "Under the new Russian Constitution citizens have the right 
to substitute community [grazhdanskiy] service for military 
service," Sergey Sorokin, chairman of the "Movement Against 
Violence" public organization, said. 
  "The right to alternative service has been recognized -- 
back 
on 22 November 1991 -- and it is necessary to observe the law. 
There is no alternative service in Russia today, nor should 
there be! A draftee who wishes to opt for alternative service 
should stay home and wait for the notorious law on alternative 
service to see the light of day." 
<H5>  From the Resolution of the International Conference under </H5>
the Slogan "Rights of People in Uniform" 
  It shall be deemed necessary to set up an organ of military 
reform, transforming the Defense Ministry into a political and 
administrative department headed by a civilian; 
  the wording of contracts shall be revised with a view to 
increasing the state's responsibility for carrying out its 
obligations to servicemen; 
  the number of combined and other units staffed by men from 
other units shall be reduced; 
  the number of military educational establishments and the 
number of officers graduating from them shall be reduced; 
  with a view to eliminating bullying and bringing about the 
spiritual revival of the Army and Navy in the transitional 
period prior to the reformation of the Army into a professional 
army, professional schools for noncommissioned officers or 
sergeants shall be established to ensure that they serve only on 
a contract basis; 
  we shall strive for an end to the Army and Navy draft of 
young people with medical problems; 
  we shall strive for the adoption in 1994 of a law on 
alternative service. 
<H5>  Facts and Figures </H5>
  According to figures from the Russian Federation Defense 
Ministry Main Organization and Mobilization Directorate for 1993: 
  The plan for the draft was 90.3 percent fulfilled, which is 
approximately the level of previous years. 
  This year it is planned to draft 216,000 people to active 
military service in Russia (in the Russian Federation Armed 
Forces, the Ministry of Internal Affairs, the Russian Border 
Troops, and so forth). 
  As of March 1993, 41,000 people had dodged the draft in 
Russia. The same year 470 people were convicted of draft-dodging 
and administrative proceedings were instituted against more than 
10,000 draft-dodgers. 
  As of today the Russian Armed Forces are at 58.9 percent of 
their full strength with soldiers and sailors. 
  In 1993 some 120,000 "contract servicemen" were drafted to 
the ranks of the Armed Forces in Russia as a whole. In 1994 a 
Russian Federation presidential edict has given the Defense 
Ministry permission to draft 150,000 "contract servicemen." 
Some 20,000 have already been drafted as of today.

  [Text] Only 16 out of every 100 Russian young men aged 18 
are called up for army service. In 1988 the figure was 70. All 
the rest are relieved because of poor health or are deferred. 
Last year the Russian Army had only half of the prescribed 
strength. The spring-time call-up is also having problems. 
  These facts were reported on Thursday at a joint meeting in 
Moscow of the leaders of the medical service of the Army, the 
conscription group, the parliamentary committees for defence and 
health protection, the interior and education ministries and the 
Russian Academy of Medical Sciences. 
  Participants accounted the current miserable situation with 
conscription to the actual decline in health standards among 
young people. Last year 26.4 pct [percent] of young men were 
relieved of army service on account of poor health. Diseases of 
internal organs ranked first, mental diseases second. However, 
speakers felt that the outdated system of medical examination 
allows to call up actually sick people and simultaneously 
permits various forms of fraud. The conference formed a working 
group to draft a plan to improve health care and prepare young 
people for army service.

<F P=106> [Report by ITAR-TASS correspondent Aleksandr Mineyev] </F>
  [Text] Brussels 29 April TASS -- Russia and the European 
Union have entered the home stretch in bilateral consultations 
ahead of the signing of an agreement on partnership and 
cooperation, Russian Vice Premier Aleksandr Shokhin told 
ITAR-TASS during a brief stopover in Brussels on his way from 
back home from Washington. 
  Shokhin said a number of barriers have already been cleared, 
but a final accord can be reached only after his meeting with 
Deputy Chairman of the European Commission Leon Britten, during 
which trade in enriched uranium will be discussed among other 
things. 
  Russia has already tabled compromise versions which can be 
finalised into an agreed upon text. If this is done, it would 
be possible to initial the agreement before the end of June 
while Greece is holding the chair in the European Union and sign 
the agreement when Germany takes over. 
  Aleksandr Shokhin, the official head of the Russian 
delegation which was conducting talks with the European Union in 
Brussels, was appointed to represent Russia at the funeral of 
the former U.S. President Richard Nixon and subsequently had to 
cut short his stay in the Belgian capital to just one night. 
His meeting with Leon Britten will take place in Moscow next 
Sunday. 
  According to Shokhin, the preparation of the agreement with 
the European Union took longer than expected because last autumn 
in Russia, after President Yeltsin failed to attend the meeting 
with the leaders of the EU countries in Copenhagen, rejected the 
"lighter-weight" version of the accord proposed by the European 
Union. That version was signed by Ukraine, whose economy was 
described as "an economy with a state-run system of trade." 
Russia continued to work towards greater benefits than those 
provided for in the rejected version. 
  Speaking about his impressions from the trip to the United 
States, where he led a delegation to a session of the 
provisional committee of the International Monetary Fund and the 
World Banks' development committee, Aleksandr Shokhin pointed to 
an interesting peculiarity: These world financial organisations 
are worried more by problems of security and crime than by 
economic issues in Russia. It means that they no longer doubt 
that Russia would pursue a normal economic policy and create a 
favorable investment climate. 
  Shokhin also held a meeting in Washington with 
representatives of the big seven. His previous meeting with 
them in February was mainly in the nature of finding out more 
about the situation in Russia, but in April "we got down to 
business," Shokhin said. "We discussed the investment climate 
and soliciting investments." The gathering also discussed 
questions relating to the forthcoming G-7 Summit in naples. 
During the funeral of ex-President Richard Nixon, the Russian 
vice-premier had a conversation with President Bill Clinton, who 
said Russia would not have any particular problems concerning 
its participation in the "political Group of Seven." Problems 
remain concerning the economic format, and these problems must 
be discussed. The G-7 leaders are prepared to expand the agenda 
of their meeting in Naples, and Russia proposed discussing not 
only financial support of economic reforms but also global 
economic problems in the solution to which Russia is interested 
and can actually contribute. One is the creation of a 
non-discriminatory trade order. Along with this the 
normalisation of the situation on the commodity markets calls 
for working out measures, on a multilateral basis and with the 
participation of Russia, to take due account of mutual interests 
of parties involved. 
  As concerns negotiations with the Paris Club, it was agreed 
that in late May or early June it would consider a variant of 
agreement with Russia for 1994 (the four-month extension of the 
terms of the accord for 1993 is now in effect). 
  In the International Monetary Fund, Russia continues to work 
in favour of the initiative calling for the additional issuance 
of the fund currency (special borrowing rights giving access to 
these resources to Russia and other countries, which did not 
take part in the distribution of these funds earlier. If the 
unfair approach is removed, Russia and other Commonwealth, east 
and west European countries will be able to get about one 
billion dollars. 
  Russia is working towards partnership relations in handling 
with universal problems, it is not just asking for help but is 
upholding universal rules with the help of which both Russia and 
others can benefit. "This will be our leit-motif in contacts 
with the Group of Seven and international financial 
organisations," Shokhin stressed. "It is not aid in exchange for 
reforms that we want, we want to create universal mechanisms of 
partner interaction."

  [Text] Kishinev [Chisinau], 28 Apr -- Meeting near 
Tiraspol, the leaders of Moldavia [Moldova] and the leaders of 
the Dniester region today confirmed their adherence to 
negotiated forms of resolving the conflict in the Dniester 
left-bank districts. The outcome of their talks was a 
communique signed by Moldavian President Mircea Snegur and the 
leader of the Dniester region Igor Smirnov. 
  The document emphasizes that a new socio-political situation 
has been created in Moldavia. This situation is a "serious 
prerequisite for a successful resolution of the Dniester region 
crisis by negotiations and in accordance with the interests of 
the entire people." 
  The sides pledged to take into consideration at the talks 
the 
recommendations on a settlement to the conflict that were 
prepared by the CSCE mission and the proposals of the Russian 
Federation. Yesterday, the Russian president's representative 
Vladlen Vasev, who took part in the talks, told an ITAR-TASS 
correspondent that the proposals of Russia, which is acting as 
mediator in the talks between Kishinev and Tiraspol, are very 
close to the CSCE's recommendations. They propose to grant the 
Dniester region a special legal status, broad 
self-administration and economic independence within the 
framework of a unified Moldavia, as well as rights to 
self-determination in the event of Moldavia's loss of statehood. 
  Today the sides agreed without delay and without any 
preconditions to begin talks, remove barriers in the way of the 
normal implementation of economic and socio-cultural ties and to 
ensure their restoration and development. They agreed on the 
need to determine the Dniester region's status under state law, 
the stage-by-stage establishment and implementation of state-law 
relations, the delegation and demarcation of the powers of the 
sides and the creation of a system of mutual guarantees. 
  Taking part in the meeting were Petr Luchinskiy, the 
Moldavian parliamentary chairman; Prime Minister Andrei 
Sangheli; Grigoriy Marakutsa, chairman of the Dniester region 
Supreme Soviet, and Richard Samuel, the head of the CSCE mission 
in Kishinev.

  [Text] Tokyo April 29 TASS -- Japan is the first of the 
world's seven leading industrialized nations to get, ahead of 
the G-7 summit in Naples, an official document prepared in Kiev, 
Ukraine, which asks the group of seven countries for massive 
economic assistance. The document was delivered to Tokyo by 
First Deputy Minister of Foreign Affairs of Ukraine Nikolay 
Makarevich, who revealed to the press that Ukraine was expecting 
subsidies amounting to nearly 20 billion dollars. 
  Informed diplomatic sources told ITAR-TASS that during his 
Tokyo visit from April 26-28 Makarevich met Deputy Foreign 
Minister of Japan Hiroshi Fukuda and representatives of the 
ministries of foreign trade and industry. During these first 
bilateral working consultations the parties discussed aspects of 
economic aid to Kiev and future bilateral relations. 
  Tokyo welcomed on the whole Ukraine's intention to open its 
embassy in Japan, but no specific accords were reached. No 
specific decision was made concerning President Leonid 
Kravchuk's visit, which Japan asked to schedule for the 
beginning of next year because its present diplomatic schedule 
for this year is overcrowded. 
  Japan and Ukraine agreed to continue consultations between 
their foreign ministries and arrange a return visit by the 
Japanese deputy foreign minister for the end of this or the 
beginning of next year, diplomatic sources said. 
  Considerable attention during the Ukrainian deputy 
minister's 
visit was drawn to the document, brought by him, concerning 
economic cooperation between Kiev and the leading industrialized 
countries. The draft protocol,which is now being circulated to 
the other members of the groups of seven countries ahead of 
their July summit in Naples, contains Ukraine's request for 
major assistance in overcoming its present energy crisis, 
switching to a market economy and stabilising currency. 
  Nikolay Makarevich told journalists that according to 
estimates, Ukraine will need at least 20 billion dollars in 
subsidies to accomplish its outstanding tasks. This amount 
includes coverage for the losses Ukraine sustained as a result 
of U.N. sanctions against Serbia, the cost of freezing the 
Chernobyl nuclear power station, as well as expenses connected 
with the withdrawal and elimination of nuclear weapons.

<F P=106> [Oleksiy Breus report: "Calm Is Not Envisaged"] </F>
  [Text] A few days ago, a conference under the 
auspices of the International Atomic Energy Authority [IAEA] was 
held in Vienna where representatives of "atomic" countries 
discussed today's state of safety at atomic electric power 
plants [AES] using high-power reactors [RBMK], in particular, 
the Chernobyl Plant. That particular plant was the reason for 
convening the conference. 
  One month earlier, an international group of experts visited 
the Chernobyl AES to study the safety of the plant's operation. 
Eight specialists commissioned by the IAEA studied design 
characteristics of the plant and certain aspects of its 
operation. The assistant general director of the IAEA for 
questions of nuclear safety, Morris Rosen, discussed the results 
of that work with top leaders of Ukraine's State Committee for 
Atomic Energy and State Atomic Supervision Agency. 
  Speaking about the meeting a few days latter, chairman of 
Ukraine's State Committee for Atomic Energy M. Umanets said that 
international experts had expressed certain criticisms regarding 
the Chernobyl AES, but had not demanded that the operating units 
be halted. Therefore, the independent expert opinion, which had 
long been demanded by the public, did not object to the 
continued operation of the atomic plant. Having referred to the 
IAEA principled stand in Iraq and Korea, M. Umanets called upon 
the press to finally exonerate that agency. Perhaps, because he 
did not yet know about the letter, which would sit on the desk 
of the Ukrainian president in another hour or two and which 
would come as an absolute surprise for the leader of Ukraine's 
atomic department. 
  In that letter, IAEA General Director Hans Blix told the 
president about the results of work of the same group of eight 
experts: Numerous shortcomings have been revealed in the 
operating units of the Chernobyl AES; the obsolete design of the 
first unit is particularly alarming. Safety is also affected by 
the difficulties in the provision of the AES's with spare parts, 
the departure of skilled personnel, the difficult conditions of 
work of the personnel, and, in addition to all of these, the 
state of the "Ukryttya" [Shelter] Facility is deteriorating. In 
view of the conclusion drawn by specialists to the effect that 
international safety norms are not adhered to at the Chernobyl 
AES, H. Blix proposed that a conference of representatives of 
interested countries be convened in Vienna in order to improve 
the situation. 
  Commenting upon that letter, first deputy chairman of the 
State Committee for Atomic Energy N. Nigmatullin called it 
unobjective. According to him, today, the safety of Chernobyl 
units is not inferior to that at Russian AES's using RBMK's, for 
example, the Kursk plant. This was also known to IAEA experts, 
just like all those measures taken at the Chernobyl AES for 
raising its safety. Therefore, if Chernobyl reactors do require 
the attention of "interested" countries, this must also apply to 
other RBMK's -- Russian and Lithuanian. Accordingly, the 
attitude of the Vienna conference must be changed. Otherwise, 
it may harm Ukraine's image. The State Committee for Atomic 
Energy informed [President] L. Kravchuk about this point of view. 
  Regarding the Chernobyl AES, in N. Nigmatullin's opinion, it 
is rather social and psychological and not technological 
problems that are largely associated with it; also political 
ones. N. Nigmatullin took the liberty of suggesting that the 
IAEA conclusions reflected the interests of certain circles in 
particular countries, which, in this manner, take care of their 
free market of energy. They simply carry on "their own game," 
although not always in accordance with the rules of decency. 
  This political assumption from the lips of the leader of a 
nonpolitical department would not sound strange, if one recalls 
that the Chernobyl AES has long become an object of precisely 
political battles. Isn't it true that, for several years, they 
have been particularly adversely affecting the plant's safety? 
However, the IAEA does not mention that fact. It would suffice 
to picture an operator, who, for a long time, fails to 
understand what his work is all about -- is it for the good of 
the people or is it treason? If he is capable of alienating 
himself from external influence, this is by no means better, as 
there must be a citizen and not an introspective Yoga adept at 
the control panel of any potentially dangerous installation.... 
  Speaking of operators, it might be relevant to recall that, 
in addition to the IAEA experts, the EC Commission also sent its 
group of experts for coordinating international technological 
assistance to work at Ukrainian AES's. They specialize in 
training the personnel of AES's operating in Eastern European 
countries. They studied problems involved in our system for 
training operators and Ukraine's needs in that sphere. After 
that, on 1 April [1994], at a meeting with Ukrainian atomic 
specialists, the extent of methodological and technological 
assistance on the part of the EC Commission to all Ukrainian 
AES's was discussed. Not a single word on the inexpediency of 
expenditure for the Chernobyl AES or on boycotting it was 
uttered. When the chairman at the meeting, head of the group of 
experts Mr. Defrenn [name as transliterated] gave the floor to 
IAEA representative A. Kosilov of Russia, thorough procedural 
actions were taken, to be on the safe side, to place A. 
Kosilov's speech outside the framework of the meeting (despite 
that, A. Kosilov also spoke about assisting the AES's in raising 
their safety, but on the part of the IAEA, which allocates an 
annual sum of about $50 million for that). Well, even abroad, 
opinions on the Chernobyl AES safety differ. However, there, 
just as in our country, there also exist extreme opinions. 
  This was confirmed at the beginning of April by the visit to 
Ukraine of representatives of the U.S. Department of Power 
Engineering and the Subcommittee on Nuclear Regulation who 
studied problems of our power engineering. It seems that they 
found the safety of the Chernobyl units to be, perhaps, the most 
important problem and stated that the Chernobyl Plant needed to 
be closed down in the very near future. Vice Premier V. Shmarov 
remarked that it was first necessary to introduce new power 
engineering capacities to compensate for closing down the 
Chernobyl Plant. Taking into account Ukraine's electric energy 
needs, the Americans agreed with his statement without, however, 
giving up the idea of closing down the Chernobyl units. 
Incidentally, from the point of view of acquiring a free market 
of energy, such a position differs little from the demand that 
the Chernobyl AES be closed down immediately.... 
  In short, as soon as passions around the operation of the 
Chernobyl AES subsided in Ukraine, they started flaring up 
abroad. It might be good, had there been good intentions behind 
it. The results of the Vienna conference also indicate that 
they will not be final. The question of whether the measures 
for raising the RBMK safety really prevail over those of its 
shortcomings that cannot be eliminated still remains unsolved 
abroad. 
  However, there is nothing new about the fact that these 
reactors were not only created in conformity with the laws of 
nuclear, but also of "political" physics. It is not only 
technological decisions that may be listed among the causes of 
the catastrophe. However, the Chernobyl AES was "revived," 
first and foremost, by political decisions, when specialists 
found it expedient to commission new atomic units, in 
particular, the fifth Chernobyl power unit. Because we turned 
out to have too many specialists in that "political" physics. 
  In all probability, their number has not decreased in the 
new 
parliament. It is unlikely that we will get fast and entirely 
independent expert opinion from abroad, as they have their own 
interests, which are not always common to all of mankind. 
Therefore, despite the decision adopted by the parliament and 
the time that has passed since then, it would be futile to 
expect calm around the operation of the Chernobyl AES. Perhaps, 
this will continue for as long as the plant operates.

  [Text] Baku (April 28) TURAN -- Leadership of SOCAR 
[National Petroleum Corporation of Azerbaijan] has been actively 
negotiating with the Turkish company BMB ASh [joint stock 
company] and the American "BMB United Group, Inc." over the 
agreement on "production sharing". The agreement stipulates 
that these companies will participate in the development of the 
Western Caspian oil-fields. 
  A representative of SOCAR said that companies will conduct 
geological and research on several oil fields of that region as 
well as an increase in oil output of two oil fields already 
developed by SOCAR. 
  SOCAR has two agreements concerning creation of joint 
ventures to develop offshore oil fields. One of them has been 
concluded with the Turkish company "Atilla Dogan". This joint 
venture is created under "Neftchala" oil-extracting department. 
The second one is engaged in the development of the Kelmaddin 
oil field, (150 kilometres south of Baku, on the Apsheron 
Peninsula) which is created under "Shirvanneft" oil-extracting 
department.

<F P=106> [Report by ITAR-TASS; "Treaty on Social Accord" -- ITAR-TASS </F>
headline] 
  [Text] Moscow, 28 Apr -- We transmit the text, distributed 
by the press service of the Russian president, of the Treaty on 
Social Accord, the signing of which took place today in the 
Kremlin: 
  Today, Russia needs social accord as never before. The tasks 
facing society are too complex and too difficult for its 
resources to be dissipated in political antagonism. Dialogue, 
the search for points of contact and common ground, and 
reasonable compromises must be the basic standard in public and 
political life. 
  It is our common aim to make the Russian Federation a 
flourishing state, enjoying a high level of authority in the 
international arena, a state inhabited by free people, proud of 
their history and looking toward the future with confidence. 
This aim can be achieved only through a social accord that 
grows out of respect for the dignity of the human being, for 
different political convictions, and for national, cultural, and 
religious traditions. 
  For the sake of social accord, the president of the Russian 
Federation, the Federation Council of the Federal Assembly of 
the Russian Federation, the State Duma of the Federal Assembly 
of the Russian Federation, the Government of the Russian 
Federation, the components of the Russian Federation, the Public 
Chamber under the president of the Russian Federation, political 
parties, trade unions, other public associations, and religious 
associations (henceforth referred to as the parties to the 
treaty), acting in accordance with the Constitution and laws of 
the Russian Federation, placing common interests higher than 
group, party, departmental, and religious interests, ruling out 
the possibility that the problems arising in society can be 
resolved through violence, whatever forms it takes, conclude the 
present treaty. 
<H8>  I. Attaining Political Stability in Society </H8>
  1. The parties to the treaty pledge to abide strictly, in 
their activities, by the primacy of human rights and freedoms, 
respect for the rights of peoples, the principles of democracy, 
the law-governed state, the division of powers, and federalism. 
  The parties to the treaty proceed from the view that the 
political life of society must develop within the framework of 
the Constitution of the Russian Federation. 
  The parties to the treaty consider that the only amendments 
that should be made to the Constitution are those that will be 
conducive to stabilizing the situation in society. To this end, 
the parties to the treaty will make use of conciliation 
procedures when drawing up proposals. The parties to the treaty 
consider the main areas for amending the Constitution to be: 
strengthening human rights guarantees, improving the system for 
the division of powers, local self-government, and the 
development of federalism. 
  The parties to the treaty undertake not to initiate 
political 
campaigns in favor of holding early elections, not envisaged by 
the Constitution, to the federal organs of power. 
  2. The Federation Council and the State Duma undertake to 
pass, in the near future, legislation on elections, laws on the 
referendum, parties, citizens' right of association, and laws 
laying down the procedure for staging rallies, processions, and 
demonstrations. 
  3. The parties to the treaty pledge to take all necessary 
measures to ensure stability within the country, without which 
it is impossible to emerge from the economic crisis. 
  The organizers of rallies and demonstrations and local 
organs 
of power and law-and-order bodies accept moral and political, as 
well as legal, responsibility for ensuring that these actions 
are peaceful in nature and that they are conducted in strict 
accordance with current legislation. 
  4. The parties to the treaty consider that the president of 
the Russian Federation and the leaders of federal state bodies 
must maintain a constant dialogue with society, political 
parties, movements, and other public associations. 
  5. The parties to the treaty consider that the grandeur of 
Russian history, with its heroic and tragic pages, obliges one 
to avoid simplified or insulting appraisals of the past and to 
prevent the distortion of historical fact. 
  6. The parties to the treaty pledge to do their utmost to 
promote the strengthening of Russia's international authority 
and defense capability, and the conducting of a unified foreign 
policy for the country. 
<H8>  II. Surmounting the Socioeconomic Crisis </H8>
  1. In order to stabilize the socioeconomic situation, the 
Government of the Russian Federation pledges in 1994, on the

  -  To 
seek to boost investment activity and to create the 
preconditions for an economic upsurge; 
  -  To develop a blueprint 
for taxation that stimulates the development of production; 
  -  To

the formation of a competitive environment; 
  -  To extend the 
structural reorganization of the economy, which means 
surmounting the structural deformations, adapting to solvent 
demand with a minimum of losses and expenses, and integrating 
the Russian economy into the world economy; 
  To create acceptable economic conditions for the 
functioning of the agroindustrial complex, and to carry out 
reforms in the countryside, mainly through economic methods, 
excluding administrative measures as much as possible;To adopt 
measures to end the budget debt as regards the payment of 
wages;To pursue an active social policy aimed at stabilizing 
and subsequently raising standards of living, adapting the 
working population to new conditions, targeting and protecting 
its most vulnerable strata against the negative manifestations 
of transitional processes, reducing the level of differentiation 
in people's incomes, and implementing the principles of social 
partnership;To draw up a federal program to promote employment, 
as well as other social programs, and to organize their 
implementation. 
  2. The president of the Russian Federation, the Federation 
Council, the State Duma, and the Government of the Russian 
Federation pledge to stimulate the processes of integration 
within the CIS and to strengthen Russia's position in the world 
market. 
  3. The Federation Council and the State Duma pledge, on the 
basis of a plan for law-drafting activity, agreed with the 
president of the Russian Federation and the Government of the 
Russian Federation, to pass laws intended to ensure that the 
socioeconomic crisis is surmounted, including a constitutional 
law on the government, a law on the budget for 1994, a civil 
code, a land code, a code of labor laws, a law on free economic 
zones, laws on banking and the organization of an efficient 
payments system, laws aimed at improving the tax system, and 
laws on the securities market and the minimum wage. 
  4. For the time during which the measures to stabilize the 
economy are being carried out: 

  -  The trade unions and associations of them pledge not to 
conduct, and not to help organize, any strikes for the purpose 
of bringing about a redistribution of budget finance or the 
allocation of subsidies and benefits regarding state credits or 
taxation to individual industries or territories for other 
purposes, having no direct connection with the issues of pay, 
working conditions and job protection; 
  -  State economic bodies and 
associations of manufacturers and entrepreneurs pledge to 
refrain from unjustified stoppages of production, not to breach 
commitments made to staff, suppliers, and purchasers, the budget 
and banks, and to take part in the conclusion of collective 
contracts and agreements; 
  -  The organs of state power and the 
associations of manufacturers and entrepreneurs pledge to use 
conciliation procedures to settle labor disputes, to provide the 
trade unions with adequate information about the state of 
relevant budgets and the position of enterprises, and to give 
the unions the organizational opportunity to pursue their 
legitimate activities. 
  5. The parties to the treaty attach great importance to the

revenue or an increase in the expenditure of the regional 
budgets. 
  2. The Federation Council and the State Duma pledge, within 
the current year, to pass federal laws: 

  -  On a more detailed delimitation of the objects of 
jurisdiction and powers between the Russian Federation and its 
components; 
  -  On general principles for organizing the 
representative and executive power of the components of the 
federation. 
  3. The parties to the treaty stress that it is only possible 
for the components of the federation to exercise their rights if 
the state integrity of Russia and its political, economic, and 
legal unity is ensured. 
  4. The parties to the treaty acknowledge the need to extend 
the economic independence of the components of the federation by 
strengthening the tax base of their budgets and by bodies in 
dealing with matters of local importance; support for local 
self-government by an independent tax base and by the right to 
fix norms for payments to its own budget, given guarantees of a 
budgetary minimum from the state; and the right of local 
self-government bodies to take part in tackling pan-regional and 
pan-Russian problems. 
<H8>  IV. Ethnic Relations </H8>
  1. The parties to the treaty undertake to: 

  -  Support the equal rights of all peoples to their ethnic 
development; 
  -  support ethnic cultures and languages; 
  -  Support 
ethnic associations, unions, societies, and other ethnic and 
cultural groups; 
  -  Provide for the development of a multiethnic 
Russian society in which there is dialogue, peaceful settlement 
of conflicts, where no territorial claims are made within the 
state, and where force is not used to settle disputes, except 
where this becomes a necessary measure by the state following a 
violation of human rights; 
  -  Set up the mechanisms needed to 
implement the law on the rehabilitation of repressed peoples. 
  2. The parties to the treaty are called upon to observe 
strictly the principle that the base of power throughout the 
Russian Federation is its multiethnic people. No single ethnic 
group has an exclusive right to control territory, the 
institutions of power, or resources. 
  3. The parties to the treaty stress the need to protect the 
interests of small peoples. The implementation of socioeconomic 
changes in areas where they have traditionally resided should be 
accompanied by a range of measures to preserve the cultural, 
historical, and natural environment of these peoples. 
  4. The parties to the treaty deem it necessary to heighten 
state and public monitoring of the observance of human rights in 
the sphere of ethnic relations and to prevent and curb any 
manifestations of discrimination along ethnic, racial, and 
religious lines. 
  5. The state authorities recognize their obligation actively 
to protect the rights and interests of Russians living in other 
states, to accept and accommodate Russians who are compelled to 
resettle in Russia, providing them with comprehensive support.

  1. The parties to the treaty regard ensuring the personal 
safety of citizens and the fight against organized crime and 
corruption as a task of the utmost importance. 
  The Federation Council and the State Duma pledge during the 
current year to create the necessary legislation, including that 
required to strengthen the law enforcement bodies. 
  2. The parties to the treaty, in line with the Constitution 
of the Russian Federation, oppose the creation by political 
parties, movements, and public associations of any armed and 
paramilitary formations, and favor their immediate disbandment 
should such formations exist. 
  3. The participants in the treaty consider attempts to draw 
the power structures of the state into supporting political 
programs and demands to be unlawful and immoral. 
  4. The participants in the treaty consider an urgent task 
the working out of specific measures in the following areas: 

  -  Strengthening and raising the efficiency of the work of 
the state's power structures in accordance with the real demands 
for ensuring the security of the citizen and the 
state; 
  -  Providing legal and material back-up for the work of the 
state's power structures and establishing civil control over 
them, including the reform of legal proceedings in the military, 
shaping cadre policy, and ensuring the openness of budget 
expenditure in accordance with international norms; 
  -  Ensuring 
rigid control over the movement of freight and individuals 
across borders with the purpose of eliminating the illegal 
export of material and cultural treasures, and the import of 
weapons, drugs, and ecologically dangerous cargoes; 
  -  Creating the 
necessary material conditions and stepping up the responsibility 
of the law protection bodies for ensuring legality and law and 
order; 
  -  Improving the environment in ecologically unfavorable 
areas. 
  5. In order to formulate an agreed state policy in the 
sphere of security the parties to the treaty consider it 
advisable that the chairmen of the Federation Council and the 
State Duma should participate in the work of the Russian 
Federation Security Council and that the chairmen of the 
corresponding committees of Federal Assembly chambers should be 
recruited to work in interdepartmental commissions of the 
Federation Council. 
  6. The bodies of state power provide for the possibility 
of participation by the political parties, movements, and public 
associations in working out a conception of national security. 
<H8>  VI. Morality, Science, Education, and Culture </H8>
  1. The parties to the treaty stress that love for the 
Fatherland and freedom, moral duty to society, creative labor, 
all the values common to the whole of mankind, and the spiritual 
and moral traditions of the multinational people of the Russian 
Federation should become the basis for its revival. The parties 
to the treaty pledge to uphold, in word and deed, the norms of 
moral behavior in politics, the economy, and public life. A 
special role in this belongs to the mass media, education, 
science, and culture institutions, and to religious 
organizations, the efforts of which should be supported by the 
state and society. 
  2. Parties to the treaty pledge to conduct an agreed policy 
in the field of the moral, spiritual, cultural, patriotic, and 
aesthetic education of children and young people. To seek out

relevant actions of public associations and other organizations 
should be encouraged. 
  3. Bodies of state power in subjects of the federation 
pledge to assist in preserving the system of free, complete 
secondary, secondary specialized, and vocational and technical 
education, as well as not to permit the existing level of

establishments to train specialists for vitally important 
spheres of the economy, public life, science, culture, and 
education.

finance scientific and cultural establishments to a sufficient 
level. 
  5. The Federation Council and State Duma undertake to adopt 
laws which will secure tax and other privileges for scientific, 
cultural, educational, and public health establishments and 
organizations for veterans and the disabled, as well as a law on

a nationwide fund to support Russian talent, whose activities 
will be financed by state forces and public, commercial, and 
other structures.

program to secure cultural and other links with ethnic Russians 
living abroad and their public associations.

<F P=106> [Unattributed report under the general heading "Accord </F>
Treaty Is Open Book": "Political Passions Should Be Brought 
Under Control"] 
  [Text] "The document on civil accord is not an argument 
against any protest actions or events, it is a vital necessity," 
Vyacheslav Kostikov, Russian Federation president's press 
secretary, stated. "Events show what an excited state Russia's 
political circles are in at present. The Civil Accord Treaty 
[Dogovor o Grazhdanskom Soglasii] will help to bring political 
passions in our country under control." 
  The situation which developed in the State Duma 27 April in 
connection with the murder of a deputy, and the nervousness and 
political hullabaloo which reigned in the Duma, is further 
evidence of how much civil accord is essential to us all, he 
emphasized.

<F P=106> [Speech by Ivan Rybkin, chairman of the State Duma, at the </F>
ceremony of signing the Treaty on Social Accord in the St. 
George's Hall of the Moscow Kremlin -- live] 
  [Text] Esteemed Boris Nikolayevich [Yeltsin], Your Holiness 
[Aleksiy II], esteemed colleagues, ladies and gentlemen, 
comrades. As chairman of the fifth State Duma in Russia's 
history, I express -- I do not hide -- my profound satisfaction 
at the signing of this treaty. Ever since it started its work 
the Duma has actively and consistently advocated the achievement 
of civic peace and accord in our society, regarding it as 
fundamentally important and extremely necessary. Though not 
going the full way, perhaps, to meeting our needs, it is 
indispensable in overcoming the crisis and bringing about the 
genuine revival of Russia. 
  When the State Duma adopted the memorandum on accord on 23 
February this year, a new stage, basically, was initiated in the 
relationship between the authorities and public organizations in 
our country. It created the prerequisites for ending the state 
of political sectarianism, which is unnatural in a parliamentary 
democracy, for ending the division of society into reds and 
whites, into them and us, into radicals and conservatives. Our 
society can see for itself that confrontation offers nothing, 
that confrontation and violence create far more problems than 
they resolve. People are tired of empty promises. But they are 
even more weary of intrigue, ambition, and uncertainty about the 
present and especially the future. 
  While welcoming the signing of the treaty, I cannot fail to 
stress that this is not a panacea for all our problems, but the 
extent of the treaty's force is strictly limited by the law and 
social practice. Perhaps this is where its moral and ethical 
aspect, authority, lies. Our age-old tradition of solving 
problems all together [vsem mirom] is being revived. There are 
differing attitudes in contemporary Russian society to the 
present treaty. But it is in the interests of accord not to 
dramatize the situation. Let us be wise and patient. Different 
assessments reflect profound social differences and 
disagreements which cannot be overcome at one go. We are 
dutybound to listen to different views and positions, to heed 
the anguish and alarm which they reflect, while specific 
objectives in ending the crisis and seeking realistic mechanisms 
for settling real contradictions are worked out. 
  One other thing is obvious. No matter how the programs of 
those taking part in the treaty may differ, they are close to 
each other in that they agree on the main thing. Society must 
be relieved of the burden of social tension. Normal relations 
between the branches of power must develop on the basis of 
unconditional observance of law and order. After all, 
separation of the powers certainly does not mean alienation from 
each other, let alone confrontation. Our routes must meet at a 
crossroads. The country's statehood must be transformed into 
something which benefits Russia and its citizens. The economic 
reforms must be deepened in the interests of the entire people 
rather than those of some small select group of people. The 
democratic thrust of foreign policy must be safeguarded, while 
ensuring that the national distinctiveness and geopolitical 
interests of Russia are rigorously observed. 
  We all need these things very much, and it is important to 
think on the fact that the time has come not to hack as we used 
to do before, but to patiently and knowingly untie the Gordian 
knots into which Russian problems have become knotted. Of 
course, the path toward the accord is thorny and long. Today we 
are merely taking the first step on this path. Our ancient 
ancestors used to say: He who has begun something has already 
half done it. I subscribe to what Boris Nikolayevich said. The 
main thing is to win the struggle within ourselves, and then at 
a certain stage we can recall the words of the unforgettable 
Konstantin Simonov, who said some time ago: Yes, we did not gain 
the victory easily. Yes, our enemy -- our internal enemy -- was 
strong. The greater is our glory. Thank you.

<F P=106> [Interview with former President Kurt Waldheim by Claus </F>
Lutterbeck in Vienna; date not given: "At Daggers Drawn With 
the Nazis"] 
  [Text] The U.S. Justice Department kept it secret for 
seven years. Now, the documentation that accuses former UN 
Secretary General Kurt Waldheim, 75, of evil war crimes has been 
published -- among other things, he is accused of having 
participated in the execution of British prisoners of war and 
the deportation of Greek Jews. 
  STERN correspondent Claus Lutterbeck interviewed the former 
Austrian president in Vienna. 
  [Lutterbeck] Mr. Waldheim, did you "aid and participate" in 
war crimes? 
  [Waldheim] This is an abomination that is intended to 
destroy the reputation of a man who has never in his life been a 
Nazi or committed war crimes. 
  [Lutterbeck] The report describes your role in Army Unit 
E.... 
  [Waldheim] ...just with assumptions and claims. There is 
not a single piece of evidence on 204 pages that I was 
personally involved in these events. Not a single historian in 
the world has proven something like that. A British Government 
committee in 1986 noted that I was not guilty of any crimes. 
Only the Office of Special Investigations in the U.S. Justice 
Department claims that. 
  [Lutterbeck] The report describes your responsibility quite 
precisely. According to the report, you, as an assistant 
adjutant, were a key figure in this army unit. 
  [Waldheim] Nonsense, I was a lieutenant -- later a first 
lieutenant -- without any authority to give orders and I dealt 
with situation reports in the army staff. 
  [Lutterbeck] Curiosity about your case was aroused because 
in your official biography, you did not mention your wartime 
past in the Balkans.... 
  [Waldheim] ...in the official curriculum vitae, which I 
presented to the Foreign Ministry in 1945, I mentioned the 
Balkans. Later on, I did not see any reason to constantly repeat 
that. 
  [Lutterbeck] Your way of dealing with the past in Hitler's 
army is strange. Why does one not hear a word of repentance and 
shame from you? 
  [Waldheim] I openly expressed my grief and sympathy here in 
parliament in 1986. 
  [Lutterbeck] Was it not perhaps this Austrian method of 
always considering oneself only as one of Hitler's victims and 
not as a perpetrator? 
  [Waldheim] Of course, there were Austrians who were among 
the biggest Nazi criminals, but there were also many victims. 
My family and I were at daggers drawn with the Nazis. 
  [Lutterbeck] You are always the victim. 
  [Waldheim] My family was persecuted by the Nazis, my father 
was imprisoned, and my mother spit at in the street. I am 
deeply aggrieved that it is intended to turn precisely a man 
with this fate into a super Nazi and war criminal. 
  [Lutterbeck] However, this did not turn you into a man that 
opposes Nazis. 
  [Waldheim] It is easy to say that for the generation who did 
not live through it. "Why did you not let yourself be beheaded 
for your convictions?" We were young people and wanted to 
survive. 
  [Lutterbeck] President Von Weizsaecker was also an officer. 
Why did it hit you and not him? 
  [Waldheim] These are two completely different cases that you 
cannot compare. I once had the problem of holding the highest 
office in the world. It was intended to hit the UN secretary 
general, who, during his term of office, also made decisions 
that some governments did not like.

<F P=106> [Article signed JCS: "Police Scandal Discredits Two </F>
Netherlands Ministers"; as released by The Hague ANP Database] 
  [Text] The Hague, 24 Mar (ANP) -- Netherlands Justice 
Minister Ernst Hirsch Ballin (CDA) [Christian Democrat Appeal] 
and Foreign Minister Ed Van Thijn (PVDA) [Labor Party] have been 
discredited by an Amsterdam police scandal. Opposition parties 
claim that neither minister remains completely untainted by the 
scandal surrounding the disbanding of the IRT [Interregional 
Investigation Team] criminal investigation unit. 
  The IRT, which operated in the provinces of North Holland 
and 
Utrecht between 1987 and the end of last year, was unfairly 
disbanded according to a report made public on Thursday [24 
March]. According to the Netherlands national investigation 
unit, it was incorrect to claim that the special police unit was 
shut down owing to its "controversial methods," as Hirsch, on 
advice from the public prosecutor and the Amsterdam police, had 
reported to Parliament in January. 
  In its report, the national investigation unit described the 
actions of the team as "well-considered, careful, and 
responsible." The national investigation unit believes the real 
reasons for disbanding the team to be the result of jealousy: 
The heads of the Amsterdam criminal investigation unit wanted 
to do away with the IRT as it could not accept its independence. 
  Van Thijn, former mayor of Amsterdam, does not want to 
accept 
any resignations of senior members of the public prosecutor's 
office or the Amsterdam police. Prime Minister Ruud Lubbers is 
of the same opinion. 
  The liberal opposition parties, the VVD [People's Party for 
Freedom and Democracy] and D66 [Democrats 66], together with the 
Ecologist Left opposition, are demanding a full explanation of 
this police affair. "Seldom has the belief in the ability to 
successfully combat organized crime suffered such a blow," 
stated D66 spokesman Kohnstamm.

<F P=106> [Article by Andrew Marr: "Making a Prime Minister of the </F>
President"] 
  [Text] The balance of probability is that Michael 
Heseltine will be Prime Minister by the end of this year. This 
startling view is spreading on the Tory benches and was 
reinforced by a day in which John Major failed to reassure his 
parliamentary party about either his tactics or his personal 
style. Mr Major is not "finished": he is a resilient and 
determined man. But from today he is fighting against, rather 
than with the parliamentary odds: if he survives the year as 
Prime Minister, it will be as Britain's Comeback Kid. 
  Yesterday was one of those days which gives the lie to the 
argument that the House of Commons no longer matters. Its 
significance was a sniff in the air, a change of mood. As the 
Prime Minister tried, perfectly reasonably and perfectly coolly, 
and showing his usual command of the detail, to respond to a 
series of sceptical questions about the European voting 
compromise, there was an ominous silence, a grim, folded-arms 
passivity on the Tory benches behind him. 
  Then Tony Marlow, regarded by mainstream Conservatives as 
being beyond the pale, openly told Mr Major he was no good and 
should go. There was the predictable noise of offence being 
taken on the Conservative side of the House. But it was low and 
muted, a mild susurration in the backwoods rather than an 
outraged gust of anger. Nor, when Mr Major quite sharply jabbed 
back at a man he detests, was there much relief Nobody follows 
Mr Marlow, though he was among the first publicly to demand that 
Margaret Thatcher go. But the social standing of the person who 
says the emperor is nude is hardly the point. 
  One eminent backbencher said afterwards: "It was terribly 
embarrassing. What Marlow said was embarrassing. The Prime 
Minister's reply was embarrassing. And the reaction was 
embarrassing." Another said: "Tomorrow's headline must be `Naked 
Emperor to Soldier On.'" 
  Of the middle-roader Tory MPs I spoke to during the evening, 
the majority felt that Mr Major's position was slipping beyond 
the point where it could be retrieved. Gruff and genuinely sad 
expressions like "not up to it" and "I'm sorry -- I voted for 
the guy" were abundant. Earlier, in the chamber, the party had 
looked as if it had had the stuffing knocked out of it by the 
latest twists of rhetoric and compromise. At one point it 
seemed as though the government side was going to run out of 
questions to ask during Prime Minister's Question Time -- an 
unheard-of thing. One senior MP who had witnessed the Suez 
debates compared the mood with that. 
  Discussions have been going on among different factions of 
Conservative MPs about potential replacements and about the 
mechanism for a change of leader. The assumption is that Mr 
Major will not, under any circumstances, stand down willingly 
and that a contest would have to be forced. Unlike Margaret 
Thatcher he would probably fight on beyond a poor first-ballot 
result and force cabinet colleagues to stand against him. That 
would take some nerve. It is very early days. We still have 
months of manoeuvring, elections and unpredictable events to 
come. But these details of a challenge are being openly talked 
about already. And in those discussions, ministers have been 
involved, though not cabinet ministers. 
  Kenneth Clarke, who only a few months ago seemed 
unchallengeable as the crown prince, has been losing ground fast 
to Mr Heseltine. A series of influential figures on the right 
of the party have been quietly canvassing their friends on Mr 
Heseltine's behalf, and partisans of Michael Portillo, the 
darling of the right are already peeling off into the Heseltine 
camp. 
  The President of the Board of Trade has been impeccably, 
even 
flauntingly, loyal -- which is precisely the right attitude for 
someone in his position. But his case is being made for him 
across the spectrum of Tory politics. One argument is that the 
centre of gravity in the party is moving on the European issue 
to embrace a policy that could be described as British Gaullism. 
But for that, you require a British de Gaulle. And there is 
only one contender for that job. More generally, 
middle-of-the-road MPs are saying that after 15 years of power, 
the Conservative movement is tired, demoralised and ragged, and 
requires a giant shot of adrenalin if it is to win a fifth 
victory. A Heseltine premiership carries the prospect of an 
exhilarating, dangerous cavalry charge that could transform the 
mood. The Labour leadership views the possibility with 
trepidation. 
  Those are the arguments flowing round the corridors and 
parliamentary offices. The Clarke camp, which had attracted the 
strong interest of right-wing dissidents last summer when Mr 
Heseltine was out of action after his heart attack, has kept 
quiet. But if the Chancellor assumes that Mr Heseltine is 
damaging his standing by showing his hand too openly, he may be 
making a serious tactical mistake: there is a yearning for hope 
in the party that precludes worry about the niceties. One 
former cabinet minister once criticised Mr Heseltine as "rather 
too much the thwack of crop upon leather." To many Tories these 
days it seems an appealing thought. 
  What, finally, about the loyalist Major camp? There are 
people still ready to work hard for him and there are various 
wheezes to make life easier. The appointment of a tough press 
officer, Christopher Meyer, has helped a little. The latest 
suggestion is that the equally tough and respected Health 
Minister, Brian Mawhinney, should be made Downing Street's 
boot-boy in chief, a partisan fighting for Mr Major on the 
rebellious back benches. Then there is the dilemma of the 
summer reshuffle. Should Mr Major ruthlessly kick out half a 
dozen cabinet ministers who have failed to live up to 
expectations, and try to remodel his government that way -- or 
would that merely create another rebellious group on the back 
benches and increase the likelihood of a putsch in the autumn? 
Betting is a fools' game. But if you are that kind of fool, lay 
a spare tenner on the President.

<F P=106> [David Hencke article: "Tougher Aid Rules `Fate to UK </F>
Trade'"] 
  [Text] Three leading industrialists yesterday accused the 
Overseas Development Administration [ODA] of leading British 
exporters towards "a massacre" by imposing tighter rules on aid 
and trade subsidies in the wake of the Pergau dam scandal. 
  John Lippitt, a director of GEC [General Electric Company], 
told the Commons Foreign Affairs Select Committee which is 
investigating the 1 billion pound aid-for-arms deal, that the 
restrictions to come into force next year were "fundamentally 
flawed." 
  Mr Lippitt was giving evidence with Sir Robin Biggam, 
chairman of BICC [British Insulated Calanders Cables], the 
parent company of Balfour Beatty, which won the 417 million 
pound dam contract, and Allan Gormly, a director of Cementation 
International. 
  All three condemned a review conducted by the ODA which from 
next year will limit aid to exporters to creditworthy countries 
with average annual income below 760 pounds per capita and to 
schemes costing less than 48 million pounds. This compares with 
2,465 pounds per capita with no limit on the cost of schemes 
under the OECD rules agreed by Britain's competitors. 
  Mr Lippitt pointed out that such a policy would remove 
support for all big schemes like power stations and dams. In 
addition every country in Southeast Asia would become ineligible 
for aid except China and Indonesia. 
  "We don't mind following the rules which apply to other 
countries but the Overseas Development Administration is 
proposing to take our troops 50 miles ahead of everybody else. 
We know what happens when troops are put in such a position -- 
they are massacred." 
  He also accused the German government of breaching the rules 
to win bids which Britain was poised to sign over the Shanghai 
and Canton metros. 
  "Chancellor Kohl who was visiting Beijing at the time was 
determined to win every single metro contract in China," he 
said. As a result the Germans gave grants of 51 per cent and 68 
per cent. OECD rules limit grants to 35 per cent. 
  Earlier Sir Robin criticised the ODA,s handling of the 
Pergau 
project, which secured 234 million pounds of British taxpayers, 
aid. 
  He said the department's two day assessment of the scheme 
was 
"absurd" and could not have been accomplished without visiting 
the site. 
  Questioned by Labour MPs, the directors denied that 
donations 
to the Conservative Party from GEC and Trafalgar House increased 
their chances of winning contracts.

  [Text] Bonn -- German observers staying in Turkey during 
the Nevruz Kurdish new year celebrations were severely 
maltreated by Turkish security forces. Several spokespersons of 
human rights groups and pro-Kurdish organizations said in Bonn 
on Wednesday [30 March] that Germans attending the Nevruz 
celebrations and municipal elections were harassed, arrested 
temporarily, interrogated for hours, and beaten up. A total of 
250 Germans had travelled to Kurdish areas. 
  Joerg Hilbert from Braunschweig, who wanted to go near Mt. 
Ararat with 15 people from Lower Saxony and Thuringia, spoke of 
"punches in the face and kicks to the kidneys." In spite of 
obstructions, the group repeatedly tried to reach their 
destination, for which they were "kicked, spat at, and beaten 
up" by security forces. A female interpreter was slapped in the 
face. A member of the group was kicked down stairs at a police 
station. 
  Hilbert and Franciscan monk Juergen Neitzert reported a 
"massive military presence." They took photographs of German 
arms being used against Kurds; among others they spoke of tanks 
from the former GDR National People's Army (BTR-60, BTR-80). 
Neitzert said that members of the German Embassy in Ankara knew 
about the use of FRG arms. The "Christian Organizations Against 
Arms Exports" want to make enquiries with the Foreign Ministry 
in this context. The spokespersons called upon the government 
not to deport Kurds from Germany to Turkey, as they face 
torture, displacement, and death.

  [Text] Bonn -- The Social Democratic Party of Germany 
[SPD] has called for sending civilian United Nations observers 
to the Kurdish areas in Turkey. This would help to protect the 
lives of threatened people more efficiently, Deputy Chairperson 
Heidemarie Wieczorek-Zeul told journalists in Bonn on Wednesday 
[30 March]. 
  In addition, the Federal Government and the other 
governments 
of the European Union [EU] should increase pressure on the 
Turkish government. The association agreement between the EU 
and Turkey is a good means of doing this. The SPD politician 
emphasized that foreign policy must not be confined to 
"ingratiating oneself" with Turkey.

  [Excerpts] Bonn -- Security near the Israeli Embassy in 
Bonn was further increased on Wednesday [30 March]. In the 
afternoon, cars using roads near the embassy were checked very 
thoroughly. It seems that several locations were chosen where a 
great number of police have been posted. [passage omitted] 
  According to police, stepped-up security is to be in force 
over the next three to four days. After that, these activities 
will not be stopped altogether but decreased to a "normal 
level." An Embassy spokeswoman said that security standards are 
very high, anyway.

  [Excerpts] Bonn (DPA) -- In addition to the Alliance 
90/Greens and the refugee relief organization Pro Asylum, the 
Hesse Office for the Protection of the Constitution has also 
warned against deporting Kurds to Turkey. [passage omitted] 
  Greens politicians Angelika Beer and Claudia Roth said that 
a 
possible agreement between the FRG and Turkey on the deportation 
of violent Kurdish demonstrators is "fatal": Such an agreement 
is "inconceivable" for constitutional reasons and because of 
German commitments from the Geneva Refugee Convention and the 
European Human Rights Convention. Pro Asylum spokesman Herbert 
Leuninger stated that negotiations on the "return" of Kurds are 
the "official admission that human rights are being disregarded 
at the Bosporus." 
  On Wednesday [30 March] the Bonn Interior Ministry rejected 
a 
report of FRANKFURTER RUNDSCHAU that, within the framework of an 
agreement with Ankara, it is planning to establish "special 
prisons" for violent Kurdish criminals to be deported. Minister 
Manfred Kanther (Christian Democratic Union) neither proposed 
this nor has such plans, a spokesman stressed. Moreover, the 
"formation of opinion" on opportunities for the speedy 
deportation of Kurds has not yet been concluded within the 
Federal Government, it was stated. 
  Hesse Interior Minister Herbert Guenther (Social Democratic 
Party of Germany) and Ferse, director of the Office for the 
Protection of the Constitution, called on the Kurds living in 
Germany not to leave the public definition of the image of the 
Kurdish people to the extremist Workers Party of Kurdistan 
(PKK). In the past few months, PKK adherents have proved 
themselves to be a group with "extraordinary aggressiveness." 
However, Ferse also accused the Turkish intelligence service of 
illegal activities on German soil in connection with 
investigations into the surroundings of the PKK. "Therefore, we 
have to be careful that our employees are not working for the 
Turks at the same time," Ferse said. [passage omitted]

  [Text] Bonn -- The Social Democratic Party of Germany 
[SPD] and the Free Democratic Party of Germany [FDP] have again 
rejected a proposal made by the Christian Democratic Union [CDU] 
to use Bundeswehr troops in the event of threats to German 
internal security. Juergen Ruettgers, CDU/Christian Social 
Union [CSU] Bundestag group manager, said in the KOELNER 
STADT-ANZEIGER on Wednesday [30 March] that the CDU/CSU wants to 
effect an amendment to the constitution after the Bundestag 
elections that shall allow Bundeswehr missions within Germany as 
a "risk reserve" for emergencies. Bundestag Group Chairman 
Wolfgang Schaeuble had made a similar suggestion late last year. 
SPD defense expert Walter Kolbow called this proposal "absurd." 
  In view of last week's riots by militant Kurds, Ruettgers 
said that the fight against Kurdish terrorism is in good hands 
with the police and judicial authorities. "But it is obvious 
that the security situation in our country is changing," 
Ruettgers said. Conflicts in other countries are also affecting 
Germany. This can easily bring about situations where the 
capacities of police and border police are depleted. FDP 
Secretary General Werner Hoyer stressed that Ruettgers 
"unfortunately let himself be carried away to show a thoughtless 
overreaction." There is no need for Bundeswehr missions in 
Germany going beyond the possibilities clearly defined in the 
Constitution. 
  Hoyer warned that the "incredible discussion" about amending 
the constitution could jeopardize the consensus on the 
Bundeswehr's tasks, diminish citizens' confidence in the armed 
forces, and undermine the troops' self-image. FDP Deputy 
Juergen Koppelin emphasized that the Bundeswehr is not to be 
seen as reinforcement of police and border police. SPD Deputy 
Kolbow said that following a militarization of foreign policy 
the government now wants to militarize domestic policy. Anybody 
making proposals like Ruettgers' threatens compulsory military 
service. Anybody who wants to improve internal security in 
Germany has to increase the presence and efficiency of the 
police and border police.

  [Text] Stuttgart (DPA) -- The talks between He Guangyuan, 
Chinese minister of the machine-building industry and 
electronics, and Baden-Wuerttemberg Economics Minister Dieter 
Spoeri (Social Democratic Party of Germany) focused on 
cooperation between the Mercedes-Benz AG and the Robert Bosch 
GmbH (both Stuttgart) with Chinese companies. The Stuttgart 
ministry reported on Wednesday [30 March] that diesel engines, 
passenger cars, car electronics, and injection pumps are at 
issue. Spoeri also promised accompanying help for the projects 
on a federal level. 
  According to its own information, Bosch is negotiating with 
six to eight Chinese firms on participation and cooperation, 
among other things, in the field of gasoline and diesel 
injections and generators. The negotiations are expected to be 
concluded before the summer. Mercedes did not want to comment 
on the projects.

  [Text] Bonn -- According to the Social Democratic Party of 
Germany [SPD], the British Government should contribute more 
toward financing the European Union [EU]. The discount granted 
to Great Britain in 1985, involving 6 billion German marks [DM] 
annually, is no longer justified today, the deputy chairwoman of 
the SPD and spokeswoman for European affairs, Wieczorek-Zeul, 
stated at a news conference in Bonn today. She pointed out that 
the German net payments currently amount to over DM23 billion. 
  Ms. Wieczorek-Zeul presented a 10-point catalogue with her 
party's demands for the German Presidency of the EU Council of 
Ministers, which begins in the second half of 1994. According 
to the SPD, the fight against unemployment must be given top 
priority. As the election results in Italy have shown, in view 
of 20 million jobless throughout the European Union, measures 
are urgently required to combat the increasing danger of 
right-wing radicalism. The realization of the trans-European 
transportation system would be a suitable project in this 
respect. During the German presidency, the SPD also expects 
initiatives designed to prevent the "social dumping" by foreign 
companies in the sphere of services -- above all, in the 
construction industry. Closer cooperation with the European 
Union in the fight against right-wing extremist criminals is 
also required. A female EU commissioner is going to be 
appointed to promote equal rights for women in European 
institutions. 
  According to the SPD politician, the German presidency will 
assume particular significance. The changeover takes place at a 
time when members of the government parties seem to be lacking 
the willingness for further European unification. She was 
optimistic that the SPD will assume power in Bonn during the 
German presidency of the European Union.

  [Excerpt] Bonn (DPA) -- In the current controversy over 
the distribution of larger tax burdens as of 1995 by means of a 
solidarity surcharge or a supplementary tax, FRG Economics 
Minister Guenter Rexrodt (Free Democratic Party of Germany) is 
already aiming at the reduction of the top tax rates as of 1996. 
In order to promote economic development, the top income and 
corporate tax rates are to be standardized and brought below 45 
percent in a three-stage tax reform. This is urgently necessary 
in international competition, the minister told DPA on Wednesday 
[30 March]. Moreover, those taxes that are independent of yield, 
such as the trade capital tax and the property tax, have to be 
reduced. The Social Democratic Party of Germany, however, 
confirmed its intention to increasingly burden "major property" 
by a land tax, a property tax, and an inheritance tax. 
  In 1993 the top income and corporate tax rates were further 
split. They are currently 45 percent for corporations, such as 
stock corporations, and 47 percent for trade or business income 
from partnerships, while the tax on private income, which also 
includes income from leasing and renting, is still 53 percent. 
According to Rexrodt, the planned tax cuts still have to be 
coordinated within the FDP and the coalition. However, "from 
the economic minister's point of view, 1996 is the date when the 
top rates have to be cut," including the taxation of private 
income. 
  However, the financial situation has to be taken into 
account. Therefore, a reform in several stages as in the 1980's 
is required. This also includes increasing the fiscal 
subsistence minimum, for which the Constitutional Court has 
called. The question of when the solidarity surcharge can be 
removed also depends on the financial situation and the economic 
development in eastern Germany, he said. [passage omitted]

  [Text] Bonn -- The dispute between the Social Democratic 
Party of Germany [SPD] and the coalition on the SPD's government 
program, in particular its fiscal policy, continued on Wednesday 
[30 March]. Finance Minister Theo Waigel (Christian Social 
Union) criticized "a number of proposals for tax increases 
covered up as subsidy cuts." Stepping up registration of 
speculative profits would make housing construction collapse and 
cause major shifts of securities to other countries, Waigel 
pointed out. 
  These measures would not hit big capital but the employees 
depending on German capital for job-creating and securing 
measures. The finance minister also criticized that the SPD's 10 
percent supplementary tax would put a burden on corporations and 
joint-stock companies "right from the first mark." 
  Joachim Poss, the SPD Bundestag Group's monetary policy 
spokesman, defended the intention to increase taxes on "high 
assets." In the case of inheritance and property tax, tax-free 
allowances should be increased to a level where only people 
paying high amounts should face higher burdens. With 
real-estate tax, small and medium assets should not be charged 
more, either. Waigel is suggesting to taxpayers that the SPD 
wants to abolish the system of taxable values and to apply full 
values without adjusting tax-free allowances in future taxation 
of real estate and property. Although taxable values should be 
moved closer to actual current values, they must not reach the 
full amount, Poss said.

  [Text] Bonn -- Economics Minister Guenter Rexrodt (Free 
Democratic Party of Germany) considers east German small- and 
medium-sized companies with some 440,000 self-employed people 
and some 3 million employees the "pillars" of economic 
development in the new laender. Speaking to the press in Bonn 
on Wednesday [30 March], Rexrodt said that he wants to examine 
the various possibilities of subsidies and programs, from 
research promotion to write-downs and investment subsidies. A 
package that is to be valid until 1997 is to be worked out to 
give companies security in planning. 
  Referring to the dispute with the European Commission on the 
use of 27 billion German marks to be provided from the European 
Union [EU] structural funds over the next five years, the 
economics minister confirmed his position. He wants the money 
to be invested directly in the labor market within the joint 
task of regional economic policy. Financing sewage plants, 
research companies, or other technologies is also important, but 
they should be paid from different funds, Rexrodt demanded. The 
funds are frozen. A decision must be made in Brussels before 
the end of this month. 
  Rexrodt contradicted the Social Democratic Party of 
Germany's 
belief that the policy conducted by the government and the Trust 
Agency is leading to a deindustrialization in the new laender. 
The industrial centers are maintained, with a million jobs in 
industry. At the same time, the foundations have been laid for 
new companies. He sees particular progress within the small and 
medium-sized businesses, especially in the fields of trade, 
commerce, and services. What often creates problems is a lack 
of capital resources. The minister, therefore, called upon 
banks not to demand too much security for credits. 
  The Federation of German Industries (BDI) on the other hand, 
considers the situation of small and medium-sized industries in 
the new laender rather "unstable." The framework for subsidies 
needs to be improved. Funds have to be used more efficiently. 
The BDI once again demanded tax privileges for net product in 
the new laender (net product preference). This is verified by 
the fact that, together with the small capital resources, the 
opening of new markets is still a priority, [the BDI said].

  [Text] Munich -- A member of the Young Christian 
Democratic Union [CDU]/Christian Social Union [CSU] brought 
charges against [Republikaner chairman] Schoenhuber on Wednesday 
[30 March]. According to his own information, Fritz Eckl, 
member of the Bavarian Land Executive Committee justified his 
step toward the Public Prosecutor's Office at the Landshut Land 
Court by "all sorts of legal aspects." The abuse of the free 
expression of opinion by Schoenhuber is extremely disgraceful 
from the legal point of view and it severely harms Germany's 
"reputation in the world."

  [Text] Hamburg (DPA) -- Former Social Democratic Party of 
Germany [SPD] Chairman Hans-Jochen Vogel has also come out in 
favor of criminal investigations against Franz Schoenhuber, 
chairman of the right-wing extremist Republikaner. Following 
his statements about Ignatz Bubis, chairman of the Central 
Council of Jews in Germany, the Munich public prosecutor's 
office must examine whether or not Schoenhuber committed the 
crime of incitement. The statements by the former television 
journalist are "indeed apt to disturb public peace," Vogel said 
in an interview on Saarland Radio on Thursday [24 March]. 
  Yesterday SPD Deputy Chairwoman Herta Daeubler-Gmelin and 
Christian Democratic Union Secretary General Peter Hintze 
demanded criminal sanctions. Leading Free Democratic Party of 
Germany politicians were outraged about Schoenhuber's "shameless 
language and insulting comments." The right-wing extremist had 
accused Bubis of "instigating people," because Bubis had said 
that right-wing extremists were the "intellectual arsonists" of 
the attack on the synagogue in Luebeck. Even though Bubis does 
not want to file a complaint against Schoenhuber, if 
investigations are carried out for the crime of incitement, as 
Vogel demands, the public prosecutor's office could act even 
without a formal complaint.

  [Text] Bonn (DPA) -- Franz Schoenhuber, chairman of the 
right-wing extremist Republikaner, maintains his accusation of 
"instigating people" against Ignatz Bubis, chairman of the 
Central council of Jews. "I do not retract one word here and 
now," Schoenhuber stated in Bonn on Tuesday [29 March] and 
added, "I am calmly expecting a lawsuit." 
  Schoenhuber justified his accusations by pointing to 
statements by Bubis at the beginning of March, when the latter, 
in the view of the Republikaner chairman, blamed followers of 
his party for being coresponsible for arson attacks. As a 
result, Schoenhuber filed a criminal complaint with the Bonn 
Land Court on 4 March, accusing Bubis of instigating people and 
slander. The proceedings are underway but it was passed on to 
the Mainz public prosecutor's office, obviously because of 
competence. 
  After the attack on the synagogue in Luebeck Schoenhuber had 
repeated the accusation and called Bubis one "of the worst 
instigators of people in Germany," after Bubis, for his part, 
had called right-wing extremist parties "intellectual arsonists" 
and blamed them for the attack on the synagogue.

  [Text] Munich -- The Landshut Public Prosecutor's Office 
has initiated preliminary investigations against Republikaner 
Chairman Franz Schoenhuber for slandering Ignatz Bubis, chairman 
of the Central Council of Jews in Germany. A decision as to 
whether there is sufficient reason for initiating investigations 
cannot be expected before Easter, Senior Public Prosecutor 
Bernhard Brenneis told DPA on Tuesday [29 March]. 
  Before investigations are started, the European Parliament 
will have to lift Schoenhuber's immunity. Schoenhuber's 
accusation of "instigation" against Bubis has been met with 
dismay from all parties.

<F P=106> [Unattributed article: "Three Sentenced in Iraqi Supergun </F>
Case"] 
  [Text] (ANSA) Terni, March 30 -- Three Italians charged 
with manufacturing parts for Saddam Husayn's planned Supergun 
today received suspended sentences in this Umbrian city, home to 
the Societa' delle Fucine company which made 75 [metric] tonnes 
of components for the Iraqi dictator's Babylon Project. The 
trial of another four defendants, two Britons and two Iraqis, is 
scheduled for November 8. 
  One of the two British engineers, Christopher Cowley, 55, 
has 
testified to the Italian parliament's commerce and industry 
committee that he designed the cannon according to 
specifications provided by Canadian ballistics expert Gerald 
Bull, killed in mysterious circumstances in Brussels on March 
22, 1990. Cowley says Bull was murdered by the Israeli secret 
service, Mossad. 
  The other Briton to be tried on November 8 is John Heath, 
58. 
Both worked for Ati, a Belgian company that allegedly 
sub-contracted parts of the project to firms around Europe. 
  One of the three Italians sentenced today is an engineer 
from 
the northern city of Brescia, Aldo Savegnago, 71, appointed by 
Ati to monitor Societa' delle Fucine's execution of its part of 
the work. The other two are the company's attorneys Paolo 
Castellazzi, 51, from Milan, and Umberto Varazi, 51, from Terni, 
who allegedly negotiated the sub-contract with Iraqi officials. 
  All three received sentences of less than two years in 
prison 
(with Savegnano also fined 800,000 lire, or 485 dollars) after 
plea-bargaining on charges of "aiding and abetting the 
construction of unlicensed weapons of war." 
  The two Iraqis are Al Mishedani Shakir, 39, and A.K. Azzawi 
[names as received], Iraqi industry ministry officials on 
secondment to the Iraqi embassy in Rome to draw up the contract 
and follow its execution. Italian authorities have been unable 
to trace them. 
  The seven defendants were indicted last July after months of 
investigations in Spain, Greece, Belgium, Britain and 
Switzerland. 
  The case broke in May 1990 when Carabinieri police seized 
the 
75 tonnes of parts in the port of Naples just before they were 
shipped to Iraq. The Iraqi government maintained they were to 
be used for an oil pipeline, but Italian investigators pointed 
to a match with similar cannon parts, posing as heavy machinery 
or tubes, seized elsewhere in Europe including Britain. 
  Before the trial, Societa' delle Fucine had consistently 
maintained that it acted in good faith, saying it had "no idea" 
that the parts could be used to make a huge-caliber long-range 
cannon.

<F P=106> [Unattributed article: "Martinazzoli Quits"] </F>
  [Text] (ANSA) Rome, March 30 -- Mino Martinazzoli today 
tendered his resignation as secretary of the (ex-Christian 
Democrat) People's Party with a letter to party chairman Rosa 
Russo Jervolino. Jervolino will address a press conference at 
1800 local (1600 GMT). 
  From initial reports, it appears that the party -- the bulk 
of the once-dominant Christian Democrats -- will be led by a 
collegial body coordinated by Jervolino. 
  Earlier this year, Martinazzoli's moderate line and 
perceived 
over-cautious approach to overhauling the party was contested by 
the party's right wing, a small number of whom split to form the 
neo-conservative Democratic Christian Centre (CCD), a Berlusconi 
ally in the Freedom Front that is shortly expected to form a 
government. 
  But the relatively poor showing of the People's Party and 
the 
success claimed by the CCD in garnering 44 seats in the general 
elections was believed to have little to do with Martinazzoli's 
decision. He did not stand in the election, and had for some 
time intimated that after completing the party's transition he 
would return full-time to his lawyer's practice in the northern 
town of Brescia.

<F P=106> [Dino Vaiano report: "And Biggest Rumor Points to Di Pietro </F>
as Justice Minister"] 
  [Text] Rome -- The tam-tam had started before polling had 
ended. With the first whiff of the pole for freedom's victory, 
the heavy maneuvers began for the new nomenclature. Who will 
enter [Forza Italia leader] Berlusconi's government? Who will 
man the Second Republic's control room? The parliamentary curb 
market is providing a continuous stream of candidates. Offices 
of every kind. Ministers, presidents of commissions, even 
possible undersecretaries. The paths of power are already 
thronged just 24 hours after the vote. The MSI [Italian Social 
Movement] is preparing its ministerial suits, the League has its 
sights set high -- [League lower house floor leader] Roberto 
Maroni has put himself forward for prime minister and [League 
Senate floor leader] Enrico Speroni for the presidency of the 
Senate -- whilst Forza Italia is orchestrating the future 
governmental and institutional positions. The most widely 
tipped persons for ministerial posts are obviously Berlusconi's 
most loyal supporters. Political scientist Giuliano Urbani is 
garnering in the jobs. He is said to be in the running for the 
post of minister of institutional reform, the job of 
Berlusconi's undersecretary, and even the presidency of the 
Chamber of Deputies. Economist Antonio Martino, Mr. personal 
income tax, is likely to disembark at the Finance Ministry, 
magistrate Tiziana Parenti at the Ministry of Justice, and 
General Luigi Caligaris at the Ministry of Defense. But the 
biggest of all the rumors circulating yesterday was that of a 
possible highly secret attempt to place Judge Antonio Di Pietro 
in the Justice Ministry. A few months ago, however, the Clean 
Hands judge had clearly expressed his preference for the judge's 
robe rather than political adventure. 
  Economics minister? As treasury superminister, the pole for 
freedom would like to see Mario Monti, Rector of the Bocconi 
University, but it is also looking at the Bank of Italy General 
Director Lamberto Dini, a personality well known on 
international markets. The new government will certainly 
include Marco Pannella -- Berlusconi has already said as much so 
in advance -- who is said to be in the running for a number of 
ministerial positions: minister of foreign affairs, of justice, 
or of community policy. Candidates for the Foreign Ministry 
include [former president] Francesco Cossiga and Sergio Romano 
(but there are also people who see Martino in this job). And 
the former president of the republic is seen as a possible 
candidate to lead a center-right government should Berlusconi 
fail to stitch up an agreement with his electoral allies. But 
yesterday [National Alliance Secretary] Gianfranco Fino refuted 
rumors about Cossiga. The spotlights are also pointed on the 
election of the presidents of the Chamber and the Senate. Could 
they be [liberal] Alfredo Biondi and [Senate spraker] Giovannia 
Spadolini? 
  The "ministry sweepstake" is waiting to be filled in 
political Rome. The Interior Ministry, after years of being 
headed up by a Christian democrat, could be taken over by League 
politician Roberto Maroni who, along with Giancarlo Paglierini 
and Vito Gnutti, incarnate the Lombards' ministerial vocation. 
The pole position for finance is held by Antonio Martino, 
followed by Paglierini and tax lawyer Giuli Tremonti (as a 
technician, as he is a Pact for Italy follower). Paglierini, 
together with economists Carlo Scognamiglio and Pietro Armani 
(economist close to the National Alliance), is in line too for 
the Budget or Industry Ministry. Another candidate who put 
himself forward yesterday for an economic position is Stefano De 
Luca (Center Union), and a large portion of the names indicated 
in the various lists are also circulating as possible 
chairpersons of the parliamentary committees, key posts for the 
future economic policy, of which in the Cencelli Manual 
[power-sharing system] of the First Republic there were nearly 
as many as there were ministerial positions. 
  MSI politician Domenico Fisichella could go to the Ministry 
of Public Education, and Christian Democratic Center politician 
Ombretta Fumigalli Carulli to Posts and Telecommunications. 
Also League politician Vito Gnutti to the Ministry of Labor, 
National Alliance politician Publio Fiori to the Ministry of 
Health, and Raffaele Costa (Center Union) to the Ministry of 
Transport and Public Works. Further potential MSI ministerial 
candidates are Domenico Mennitti, Giulio Maceratini, and General 
Luigi Ramponi.

<F P=106> [Editorial by Paolo Franchi: "The Knight's Shield"] </F>
  [Text] Not so much an earthquake: At the 27 and 28 March 
elections, at the first exit polls, something fairly similar to 
a revolution took shape. For the person who, during the past 
two years, has made poked fun at the Left with the fire of this 
grand and terrible word, it looks like a bitter awakening. But 
also those people who were more attentive to this country's 
history, more concerned about the extreme difficultly of 
governing a convulsive transition phase in a democratic fashion, 
had become intuitively aware of the danger, and indeed had 
little reason to express satisfaction. 
  There is no getting round the fact that this is not the way 
we thought we should move from the night of the First Republic 
to the dawn of the new one. With a disordered and crazily 
ferocious election campaign. With a vote which makes the 
conflict even more radical. 
  In the coming hours we will see the dimensions of the pole 
for freedom's success, in particular in terms of parliamentary 
seats. The new electoral system can play brutal tricks, even on 
the best opinion pollsters, and a relative majority, however 
large, is something totally different from an absolute majority. 
We shall also see whether, and to what extent, and if necessary 
how, [Forza Italia leader] Silvio Berlusconi, who had stated his 
readiness to renounce the soccer title for Milan for the sake of 
this victory, will be able to hold together his highly litigious 
allies: the League which, according to the forecasts, is in 
difficulty, and the MSI [Italian Social Movement]/National 
Alliance, which on the other hand is getting ready to enjoy the 
pleasures of a triumph which is probably above anything they had 
expected. 
  But in the meantime that victory of the Right, or rather of 
three different and potentially complementary rights, is there. 
Revealing in part deep and ancient tendencies in the country, 
which have been kept under control for almost 50 years during 
which Italy was governed by a center which, whilst looking 
leftward, took good care not to lose its ability to represent 
the majority of the moderate and conservative electorate, and to 
keep it as far away as possible from the reactionary camp. 
  But an excess of history is of little use in helping us 
understand. Because Forza Italia is not interpreted by the 
majority of Italians, nor even less by those voting for it, by 
the yardstick of a recycled repetition of the five-party system, 
as the adversary propaganda noisily and ineffectively pretended. 
Because Bossi's League was not only a striking sign of the 
collapse of the ancien regime, but also a highly active and 
original political player in the process. Because Gianfranco 
Fini's MSI-National Alliance, with all the concerns which its 
major step forward arouses, is something different from Giorgio 
Almirante's at times squad-like and at times smart-suited MSI. 
  In other words, Italy's three rights have roots which are 
more or less old and deep, but which represent, each on its own, 
and all together, a new phenomenon. As if public opinion, and 
finally [philosopher] Norberto Bobbio, have perceived the 
recipes which these parties have formulated, more or less 
completely, for overcoming the Italian crisis by paths opposed 
to the traditional consensus approach as being new, and in any 
event newer than those suggested by the Left. It would be 
surprising if such a large number of novice rhetoricians were to 
evince surprise and indignation at the revolution which has come 
out of the vote. 
  Right now, in any event, the first job of the pole for 
freedom's heterogeneous components and of Berlusconi, before 
even getting down to proving in practice the efficacy of the 
therapy in question, is to demonstrate that they are able, 
together, to reap the benefit of their joint victory. In brief, 
to give the country a government, individually and in 
conjunction with the other parties. And the task, judging from 
the virulent polemics of the past weeks and the first "hot" 
reactions of Bossi and Fini, is not an easy matter. 
  If the numbers of the new parliament prove them right, and 
if 
they succeed in this enterprise, everyone of the Right which has 
become a governing force and who is looking for a democratic way 
out of the crisis must renounce every temptation to crush, and 
must fully respect the rules of the game and the rights and the 
reasons of the defeated. And at the end of an election 
campaign, one of the most poisonous fruits of which has been the 
rampant tendency to transform the figure of the adversary into 
that of a mortal enemy, divested ultimately of his legitimacy 
not only to govern, but even to exist, and into an incarnation 
of evil, and in a situation of serious political and social 
tensions, the same applies identically to the Left. 
  What is at stake, naturally, is the fate of Italian 
democracy, which has become fragile. But, looking at the 
situation closely, what is at stake is the very future of the 
Left, which is guilty as much, if not more than the Right, of 
the mortal sin described above, and which will probably pay a 
very high price for this. Just last December, on the day after 
the second round of the local elections in Rome and Naples, 
[Democratic Party of the Left (PDS) Secretary] Achille Occhetto 
and his allies considered themselves, and were almost 
universally considered to be, the certain victors of the general 
elections, being confirmed in this position first of all the 
incommunicability between the League and the National Alliance 
and the desertification of the center. Against any recomposition 
of which, forgetful of the less antiquated part of the same 
[former communist leader] Togliatti tradition, they then took 
steps to fire point-blank. From this unjustified euphoria the 
progressives were entirely unable to free themselves after the 
direct entry onto the stage of Berlusconi, even though clearly 
destined to radically change the situation. Gradually the 
quasi-certainty of victory receded, a situation which, however, 
they translated into virulence, extremism, and denunciation of 
mortal risks for democracy, for the ability to live together, 
and for the fight against criminality in the case of a victory 
by the opposition. 
  With at least the first indications of how the voting went, 
the outcome appears to be that they have convinced fairly few 
electors outside their own traditional field of influence: a 
result certainly made no less disappointing by the success of 
the PDS list. It would be the worst thing possible for the same 
Left if, rather than to withdraw and seek to understand the 
reasons for the defeat, it were to persevere in error. Shouting 
about plots and the bogeymen. 
  It would be wrong for them to seek a way out of the awkward 
situation by seeking to radicalize social combat, or by 
exchanging judicial initiatives for the continuation of the 
political battle by other means. In preparing a responsible 
approach, the Italian Left could draw inspiration from the 
French left. Certainly, Silvio Berlusconi has nothing of a 
Charles de Gaulle about him. But it was precisely in the years 
of the government of the right that, in France, a left, finally 
emancipated from the consensus vices of the Fourth Republic 
succeeded in building, not a gay and therefore useless war 
machine, but a leader, a program and a winning line-up.

<F P=106> [Interview with General Fiore, commander of the Italian UN </F>
troops in Somalia, by Gianfranco Simone in Bergamo on 23 March: 
"Somalia: Goodbye in Anger"] 
  [Excerpt] [Passage omitted] [Simone] What are your most 
pleasant and most painful memories of Somalia? 
  [Fiore] The children, in both cases, because it was nice to 
meet them and very nasty to have to leave them, regretting a 
good job that we were unable to finish. (And Fiore embraces 
Muraja, a Somali child who has been turned over to a Bergamo 
couple.) 
  [Simone] I see some Somalis leaving the plane. How many are 
there? 
  [Fiore] Nineteen collaborators, to protect them from 
possible 
retaliation. They are mostly Abgal. Included, too, is Mrs. 
Murta, Ali Mahdi's wife, who will be in Italy for 10 days. 
  [Simone] Are you still convinced, after having seen the 
pictures of [RAI journalists] Ilaria Alpi and Miran Hrovatin, 
that our colleagues were killed by Muslim fundamentalists? 
  [Fiore] Yes, but not because of what the pictures showed. We 
had known for some days that they were planning to kill a 
Westerner and we warned all journalists, because they are the 
weak link in our presence in Somalia. However, our troops have 
a reputation of impenetrability. 
  [Simone] Are there any of our troops left in Somalia? 
  [Fiore] There are still 16 guards at the Embassy, which is 
now located in the UN Command Building. 
  [Simone] Why did we give up the old embassy building with 
its 
mascot tortoises? 
  [Fiore] Because to defend it would have required 200 people 
and 5 billion lire a month. The Scire department was 
transferred to Merca Hospital. 
  [Simone] Are the policemen whom we trained and armed and who 
were left at the old embassy still efficient? 
  [Fiore] ... (silence) 
  [Simone] How many Italian soldiers passed through Somalia in 
those 15 months? 
  [Fiore] Including my battalion, 5,000, including the 
Lightning Battalion 8,000. 
  [Simone] Italy lost 12 men, soldiers of peace, charity, and 
information. How many losses did we inflict upon the Somalis as 
of 6 February 1993, when paratroopers and marines shot two 
bandits? 
  [Fiore] About 100, during my stay. Those were street 
bandits. As regards the Lightning and San Marco Battalions, I do 
not know. 
  [Simone] According to Aidid, the Lightning Battalion has 
killed 56 of his men alone. So, can we speak of several hundred? 
  [Fiore] I think so. 
  [Simone] Is it true that Balad, where our command and 
logistical center was located, is a den of bandits? 
  [Fiore] At least 40 of the bandits that we killed, not only 
in Balad, but also in Giohar and Itala, which is far away, were 
from there. 
  [Simone] And did we install our command and logistical 
center 
especially there, because there were bandits? 
  [Fiore] No, it was to use the barracks and because the Uebi 
checkpoint controls the road going north to Moga. 
  [Simone] When will the other Italian troops arrive? 
  [Fiore] The command paratroopers, including my deputy 
commander, Colonel Cantoni, will arrive tonight in Pisa with the 
C-130 that with us departed from Mombasa. Four hundred more 
Army infantrymen, 120 marines of the San Marco Battalion, and 20 
marine raiders will arrive by ship before 6 April. The Navy has 
done an excellent job. I am very proud of them because for the 
very first time the Navy has been put under the command of an 
Army general. On board the Garibaldi they handed me an embossed 
plate as a present, inscribed: "To the General-Admiral." 
  [Simone] Goodbye Somalia, or see you later Somalia? 
  [Fiore] Goodbye for us, see you later for Italy: Somalia is 
a country that definitely needs help.

  [Text] (ANSA) Beijing, March 25 -- An export credit line 
worth 75 million dollars has been granted to the Industrial and 
Commercial Bank of China by a group of Italian banks led by 
Crediop, part of the San Paolo di Torino group. 
  The credit line is part of a 300 million dollar financing 
operation for Chinese purchases of European tools and 
technology, aimed at enhancing Sino-Italian trade which last 
year more than doubled. 
  A first tranche of 150 million dollars went to the Bank of 
China, and the second, of 75 milion dollars, went to the 
People's Construction Bank.

<F P=106> [Unattributed article: "Anti-Mafia Commission Members </F>
Resign, Back Violante"] 
  [Text] (ANSA) Rome, March 24 -- Two members of parliament's 
joint Anti-mafia Commission, including its vice chairman, 
resigned Thursday [24 March] in support of the commission's 
chairman, Luciano Violante, who stepped down yesterday after the 
commission became embroiled in an electoral dispute because of 
ongoing investigations. 
  The vice chairman of the commission, Socialist Senator 
Maurizio Calvi, and Republican Senator Giovanni Ferrara Salute 
both announced they were resigning to protest the "attacks" by 
Silvio Berlusconi against Violante and therefore against the 
entire commission. 
  Berlusconi, leader of the right-wing Forza Italia coalition, 
had requested Violante's resignation after the Turin daily, LA 
STAMPA quoted the commission chairman as saying that a top 
executive of Berlusconi's media, retail and advertising empire 
may be under investigation in Catania for alleged links with the 
mafia. 
  The Catania public prosecutor's office has been 
investigating 
ties between organized crime, business, politicians and 
freemasonry. Violante, a member of the Democratic Party of the 
Left, denied the statements published by LA STAMPA but agreed to 
step down because, he said, he did not want the commission's 
work and its stature to be undermined. 
  (The Catania prosecutor's office has refused to release 
information about the investigations and today reiterated it 
would not confirm or deny whether the executive, Marcello 
Dell'Utri of the Publitalia advertising agency, was under 
investigation. "If we deny we have to intervene because when we 
do not deny, people think we are confirming," said one Catania 
magistrate.) 
  A third commission member, the Lower House Left Democrat MP 
Gaetano Grasso, also resigned later, saying that "the attack 
against Violante...raises doubts on the entire commission and 
the work it has carried out over the years." 
  All the commission members belonging to the Progressive 
Alliance later announced they, too, were resigning in support of 
Violante and to protest the allegations made by Berlusconi. 
Five of the nine resigning members belong to the Democratic 
Party of the Left, the others are from the Democratic Alliance, 
Network, Green and Communist Refoundation parties.

<F P=106> [Unattributed article: "Government Fires ENEL Boss"] </F>
  [Text] (ANSA) Rome, March 29 -- Another top head rolled as 
a result of the ongoing Clean Hands anti-corruption enquiries 
with a communique Monday evening [28 March] announcing the 
firing of 68-year-old Franco Viezzoli as chairman of ENEL 
[National Electric Power Board], Italy's national electricity 
board. 
  Viezzoli was one of 33 persons placed in preventive custody 
on January 18-19 as part of investigations into contracts for 
the power station at Gioia Tauro on Calabria's western coast, in 
an area where the presence of 'Ndrangheta and some Mafia 
organised crime gangs is heavy. 
  Other top ENEL executives were also detained in connection 
with kickbacks allegedly paid for contracts at the still 
unfinished plant. Charges levelled against some of their 
co-defendants include Mafia association and ties because most of 
the contracts were handed out to alleged Mafia companies. 
  Monday's communique said the Treasury, Industry and Budget 
ministers met at the Treasury on Thursday and decided that 
Viezzoli's judicial position was "not compatible" with his 
position at the helm of the electricity agency -- now a 
joint-stock company with the Treasury as the sole shareholder 
and set for a market flotation some time in the not-so-distant 
future. 
  For the near future, current plans see the signing of a 
convention with ENEL SPA to regulate its role as heir to old 
government agency. This would involve a new licencing 
arrangement with the government and would pave the way for 
creating a new authority to regulate electricity production. 
The door would then be open for the placement of the first 
stock, perhaps early next year, although some sources are still 
hoping for the end of this year. 
  The removal of Viezzoli is just one step in this complex 
process. Viezzoli entered IRI [Institute for Industrial 
Reconstruction] in 1950 with a degree in economics and commerce 
and rose to be the public-sector holding company's 
director-general in 1964. In July 1976, he became chairman and 
managing-director of Finmeccanica, the IRI manufacturing and 
engineering arm, picking up a strategy to relaunch it in the 
field of advanced technologies by aeronautical agreements 
linking up with Boeing and Aerospatiale and energy production 
cooperation with Westinghouse and General Electric. At 
Finmeccanica, he was also responsible for the much-disputed sale 
of Alfa Romeo to Fiat, the first case in which a major 
public-sector company was sold off to the private sector. 
  He became ENEL's chairman in January 1987 and has run it 
ever 
since, steering what is billed as the world's second-largest 
producer of electrical energy through shoals such as tariff 
policy and the difficulties of building new power-stations in a 
country where environmental feeling is strong enough to have 
imposed a moratorium by referendum on the construction of 
nuclear power-stations and other forms of power generation also 
come under close scrutiny. 
  In a statement, Viezzoli said he was "obviously available" 
to 
fall in with whatever the government should see fit as regards 
the top posts in the body.

<F P=106> [Interview with PSOE Organization Secretary Cipria Ciscar by </F>
Adolf Beltran in Valencia; date not given] 
  [Excerpt] [Passage omitted] [Beltran] Half of Spain is 
wondering who this new PSOE [Spanish Socialist Workers Party] 
organization secretary is and how long he has been in political 
life. 
  [Ciscar] I am in politics because of a commitment which 
dates not from now but from when I was 18, at the time of the 
struggle against the dictatorship. That original commitment, 
which many of us young people had at that time, led me to 
political commitment, also to the struggle against inequalities. 
Later, in 1978, my link with the Socialist Party was 
established. 
  [Beltran] Are you a Guerraist? A renewalist? With which 
currents within the party have you identified? 
  [Ciscar] I committed myself from the outset to a blueprint, 
which is the Socialist blueprint, without further labels. I 
have always believed that that blueprint must be tackled on the 
basis of renewal, and I have worked for reflection on ideas and 
proposals which interest people not to be abandoned. In any 
event, that attitude is already implicit in my commitment to 
democracy and as a Socialist. 
  [Beltran] What circumstances made possible your becoming 
organization secretary? 
  [Ciscar] Election as organization secretary or as the person 
responsible for any other area of the Federal Executive 
Committee occurs for two reasons. The first is that the 
secretary general has decided to have you at his disposal. The 
second is that the delegates have supported the proposal. It is 
indisputable that the secretary general takes into account the 
opinions which emerge in the party. 
  [Beltran] And did not the fact that you belong to a 
federation -- the Valencian Federation -- which went to the 
congress united under the flag of integration carry weight? 
  [Ciscar] There is no doubt that the Valencian delegation, 
led by Joan Lerma, played a constructive role, both in 
contributing ideas and in securing agreements for setting the 
congress on the right course. Moreover, the fact that Lerma 
chaired the congress made it necessary to play that role more 
diligently. 
  [Beltran] What does integration mean in a party polarized 
between Guerraists and renewalists? 
  [Ciscar] Felipe Gonzalez stated that the congress must be 
one of renewal of ideas at the same time as one of integration 
in order to ensure that the party does not lose its cohesion. 
Thus there was an extensive renewal in the sphere of ideas, 
thanks primarily to a fluid debate which made it possible from 
the precongress stage to accept proposals by a very large 
majority. As was natural, there were also changes in order to 
form a team of people who can carry out those ideas. At the 
same time, it was made very clear that society's concerns and 
the party's run in the same direction. 
  [Beltran] What is your opinion of the work of Jose Maria 
Benegas -- your predecessor in the post? 
  [Ciscar] He has worked very hard for several years, and now 
he has accepted another post within the Executive Committee. 
  [Beltran] And how do you view his performance as 
organization secretary? 
  [Ciscar] Work in the Federal Executive Committee is 
teamwork; it must be performed jointly. It is true that each 
area has some tasks, and also that everybody has his temperament 
and way of doing things. I believe that the organization 
secretary must encourage openness, tolerance, and dialogue 
within the party and at all levels. 
  [Beltran] What is your opinion of the new Executive 
Committee? 
  [Cscar] It has very considerable support. It is clearly led 
by Felipe Gonzalez, and it contains a large contingent of people 
with responsibilities in the government, autonomous community 
premiers, and federation secretaries general. It is broadly 
representative. 
  [Beltran] Must the door be opened up to society? 
  [Ciscar] The party must be consistent with the renewal of 
ideas, and should avoid acting in a dogmatic and secretive way. 
I will make an effort to ensure that the congress resolutions 
are implemented, and although I have never before held directly 
organizational responsibilities, but rather institutional and 
parliamentary responsibilities, I will work to achieve this 
hopefully on the basis of transparency, dialogue, and openness. 
  [Beltran] You are taking over the organization at a time of 
poor election prospects. 
  [Ciscar] Over the past few years Spain has experienced very 
considerable changes. Democracy has been consolidated, our 
commitment to Europe has been reaffirmed, and the foundations of 
the welfare state have been laid. Our aim must be to intensify 
that work. 
  [Beltran] Corruption and the controversy over the parties' 
funding have recently marked political life. How will you 
approach this matter from your new post? 
  [Ciscar] The Socialist Party is the most closely watched of 
all, and this is natural because it holds the greatest 
responsibility. It is also the most open, but this is not 
enough; it should be much more so. Felipe Gonzalez has spoken 
of promoting the party's clear and transparent functioning, and 
I have been called upon to work on the basis of that approach.

<F P=106> [Article signed LVE/MTH/PHF: "Willy Claes More Optimistic </F>
on Fate of Arrested Kurdish Deputies"; as released by Brussels 
BELGA Database] 
  [Text] Istanbul, 29 Mar (BELGA) -- Belgian Foreign Minister 
Willy Claes came out of his meeting on Tuesday [29 March] with 
Husametin Cindoruk, speaker of the Turkish Grand National 
Assembly, reassured with regard to the fate of the six Kurdish 
deputies who were arrested at the beginning of the month after 
their immunity was lifted for collusion with the Workers Party 
of Kurdistan (PKK). 
  Mr. Claes said at the end of his meeting with Cindoruk: 
"This meeting showed me the light at the end of the tunnel. I 
have every hope that major and relatively long-term progress 
will be made, and I had the feeling, after listening to Mr. 
Cindoruk's explanations, that there is less risk of very stiff 
punishments being imposed." 
  The six deputies, members of the Democratic Party [DEP], 
stand accused of "separatism" and of "endangering the integrity 
of the state," charges laying them open to the death penalty. 
  The Belgian foreign minister refused to give further details 
on the assurances he had received from Cindoruk "in the 
interests of the six deputies themselves." 
  Even though he does not know with certainty whether the 
Turk's undertakings were based on concrete facts or a on 
personal analysis, Mr. Claes expressed the hope that "the fate 
of the deputies will not be decided in the way we feared." 
  Mr. Claes had already raised the issue on Monday with his 
Turkish counterpart, Mr. Hikmet Cetin, and the head of state, 
Suleyman Demirel. He stressed at the time that sentencing the 
deputies could only lead to negative reactions from the 
international community and would adversely affect Turkey's 
credibility. 
  The foreign minister is to return to Belgium on Wednesday 
evening.

<F P=106> ["laho"-signed report: "Talks With European Union </F>
Concluded"] 
  [Text] Brussels -- The accession talks of the European 
Union [EU] with Austria, Sweden, Finland, and Norway were 
concluded on Wednesday evening [30 March] when the last open 
chapter on institutions was settled. An improvement for Austria 
was achieved regarding its representation in the EU bodies. It 
will be allowed to send 21 (instead of 20) deputies to the 
European Parliament, and 12 each (instead of 11) to the Economic 
and Social Committee and the Committee of the Regions. 
Austria's ambassador to the European Union, Manfred Scheich, 
stressed that the compromise on the blocking minority in the EU 
Council of Ministers adopted earlier is the "result of political 
common sense."

  [Text] Sweden's negotiations on membership of the European 
Union [EU] have now definitely been concluded. In the Council 
of Ministers, the highest decision-making body in the EU, Sweden 
will get four votes; Sweden had asked for five votes in the 
negotiations. In the European Parliament Sweden will have 22 
votes. If the result of the national referendum is "yes" in 
November, Sweden can become a member of the EU on 1 January 1995.

  [Excerpts] Brussels, March 30 (AFP) -- The successful 
conclusion of membership negotiations with four new members is a 
"message of hope for the future of the European Union [EU]," the 
Greek presidency of the EU said Wednesday [30 March]. 
  But the "Greek compromise" on voting procedures which 
unblocked the process of enlargement, formally agreed by the 12 
current and four new members on Wednesday, was not legally 
binding as Britain has claimed, Greek ambassador to Brussels 
Yannis Kranioditis said. 
  The compromise formula, an annex to the main membership 
treaties, was only a political declaration, he said. [passage 
omitted] 
  A date for signing the treaties, which should take place 
before the EU summit on June 24 and 25, will be set at the next 
meeting of foreign ministers, Kranioditis said. 
  Wednesday's session also agreed on the number of deputies 
each new member would have in the European Parliament. Sweden 
is to have 22, Austria 21, Finland 16 and Norway 15 out of a 
total 639 deputies. 
  In the expanded new Council of Ministers, Austria and Sweden 
will each have four votes and Norway and Finland three each, 
under rules which allocate seats according to population size. 
  Hungary and Poland will officially present their 
applications 
for EU membership in Athens on April 1 and April 8 respectively, 
Greek European Affairs Minister Theodoros Pangalos added on 
Wednesday. 
  Kranioditis said that after the EU expanded northwards and 
eastwards, Greece would like it to open the door to new members 
in the south, and the candidature of Cyprus and Malta was to be 
considered at the start of 1995.

<F P=106> [Commentary by Gilbert Gobin: "Is the European Union Facing </F>
a Hidden Crisis?"] 
  [Text] "Better a crisis than a bad compromise," Jacques 
Delors said last week about the institutional arguments dividing 
the 12 members of the European Union (EU) on the consequences of 
its enlargement to include Austria and the Scandinavian 
countries. The European capitals, including London, ended up 
giving the green light to the compromise concocted last weekend 
by the foreign ministers. But is it a good compromise? And will 
it allow crisis to be avoided both in the EU and the United 
Kingdom? This is far from sure. 
  Certainly, by choosing to tone down the dispute which has 
been agitating them for several weeks, the EU governments are 
indicating that the enlargement process can continue according 
to the planned time schedule. Two and one-half months away from 
the European elections, that could be interpreted as a sign of 
confidence in the future, addressed to public opinion. And in 
the perspective of the referendums which are to be organized in 
the new member countries, it could cover over the poor 
impression left by their indecision. 
  But before reaching that point, they must manage to convince 
the European Parliament (EP) that the modifications are 
acceptable. And it is far from certain that the MEPs will be as 
conciliatory as the ministers themselves. After all, warnings 
have been fired off from all quarters in recent weeks, far 
exceeding nationalities and political families. The compromise, 
proposed in Ioannina on Sunday [27 March] by the Greek 
presidency and backed yesterday by the EU governments, allows 
for the blocking minority to be adapted arithmetically from 23 
(out of 76) to 27 (out of 90 votes) after the enlargement to 16 
members, as 10 countries were demanding. But, in order to 
answer the opposition from the British and Spanish, a vote of 
between 23 and 26 could nevertheless allow negotiations to be 
continued for a "reasonable period." What is this period and 
how can it be defined? The question is unanswered and will 
certainly be controversial. 
  Even if the principles of the supporters of a federal Europe 
have been apparently safeguarded, it is no less true that the 
rot has set in. That, to use the expression of the Commission 
president, the solution contains a real danger of creating 
"negative jurisprudence" which could have implications for the 
more fundamental institutional reform which will take place in 
1996. And that there has been an increase in the threat of 
Community decisionmaking procedures being diluted. Even if 
crisis does not break out today, it could well emerge in the 
near future. 
  And, while we are waiting, it is far from certain that John 
Major will manage on his side to overcome his domestic problems. 
By choosing in the end to follow the most European-minded of 
his cabinet, the British prime minister managed to avoid any 
break with the continent. But now he is going to have to save 
his head, which has had a price put on it by the Eurosceptics in 
his party who are speaking only in terms of "surrender" and 
"capitulation." That will certainly not be the easiest part.

<F P=106> [Unattributed article: "EU Support for Albania, Moldova, </F>
Bulgaria"] 
  [Excerpt] The European Commission (EC) has earmarked 
financial aid for Albania, Moldova, and Bulgaria. This was 
decided at a meeting of the group of 24 rich countries to 
discuss macroeconomic aid to Central and East Europe. 
  The EC proposes to make ECU35 million available to Albania. 
This EU [European Union] loan is to support the country's 
balance of payments and covers about one half of the financing 
deficit incurred during the first year of implementing the 
reform and stabilization program. 
  Over recent years, Albania has already received a loan of 
ECU70 million from the European Union. The EC is, however, 
insisting that this East European country should normalize its 
relations with commercial credit institutions so that the 
financing of private trade and direct foreign investments can 
quickly begin. 
  Moldova is to receive a long-term loan of ECU45 million from 
the EC. The Twelve agreed back in December on the principle of 
granting assistance to this former Soviet republic. The loan 
covers one third of the Moldovan financing deficit for 1994. 
  The support for the Bulgarian balance of payments is to be 
increased to ECU150 million, following the green light from the 
EU Council. An increase in support for the Romanian balance of 
payments is also likely, according to EU Commissioner Henning 
Christophersen. This European assistance comes on top of 
financial aid from the IMF and the World Bank for the economic 
reform program in Romania and Bulgaria. [passage omitted]

<F P=106> [By Trevor Mason, PRESS ASSOCIATION parliamentary chief </F>
reporter] 
  [Excerpt] Foreign Secretary Douglas Hurd insisted again 
today that Britain had won important concessions from the 
European Commission before agreeing to endorse the so-called 
Greek compromise on voting rights. 
  Despite denials in Brussels yesterday, Mr Hurd told the 
Commons that the EC had confirmed undertakings in relation to 
health and safety issues and social affairs. "These assurances 
have been given by the Commission with the full authority of 
Commission President Jacques Delors, and reconfirmed this 
morning," he told sceptical Opposition MPs at question time. 
  His comments came as the Prime Minister was facing his 
biggest test yet over what has been portrayed as a "humiliating 
climbdown" in the row over EU [European Union] voting rights. 
  The "concessions" offered by the EC were pivotal to the 
Cabinet's decision yesterday to accept the compromise proposal 
-- a move which led one Tory backbencher, Tony Marlow 
(Northampton N), publicly to call for Mr Major to quit. 
  In the Commons today, Nigel Spearing (Lab Newham S) said 
that 
when the Commission's undertakings were put to Mr Delors 
yesterday, his response had been "no, no, no!". He demanded: 
"How do you reconcile that statement with what we were told 
yesterday?" 
  Mr Hurd said: "The Commission have confirmed that their 
legislative programme does not envisage the use of the health 
and safety articles of the treaty other than for measures 
directly and demonstrably relevant to health and safety at work. 
The Commission have also confirmed that proposals in the social 
chapter will not apply to the UK. For the purposes of the 
agreement, the UK should be considered as a third country." 
  Foreign Affairs Select Committee chairman David Howell (C 
Guildford) said there had been "confused and mixed reports" 
about what the Commission had agreed to. 
  He asked for confirmation that "undertakings have been given 
to relinquish back to national level, where they are far better 
handled, very important regulations and controls over important 
health, safety and social affairs legislation." 
  Mr Hurd said: "The assurances given are the ones given by 
the 
Prime Minister yesterday, which I have detailed again today, and 
were given by the Commission with the full authority of Mr 
Delors and reconfirmed this morning." 
  Tory Winston Churchill (Davyhulme) said that while welcoming 
enlargement of the EU, there was "an overwhelming majority of 
people in the UK and a significant element among our EU partners 
that does not wish to see us end up in a centralised federal 
Europe." 
  He asked: "Will you undertake to fight all the way to ensure 
that when this matter comes up to be decided again in 1996, we 
have as many allies as possible to ensure that national rights 
and sovereignty are not ridden over roughshod." 
  Mr Hurd said he was right and that there was a "growing 
number of people right across Europe who reject the idea of a 
centralised super state. There was a time when people felt that 
in order to be a good European you had to believe that executive 
power should be moved step by step to the centre. That is no 
longer the belief of sensible people -- for example Chancellor 
Kohl (of Germany)." 
  To Labour jeers, he said this would be a principal issue in 
the forthcoming European elections, because it separated the 
Tories from Labour. 
  Shadow foreign secretary Dr Jack Cunningham accused him of 
misrepresentation. There was no question of his party 
supporting a federal Europe, or abandoning the position of 
requiring unanimity on economic, foreign and defence policy 
issues, he said. 
  Mr Hurd said Labour leader John Smith had signed up to the 
Euro Socialist manifesto and said that majority voting should be 
the norm. "It is not the norm now," he said. 
  He told Tory James Paice (Cambridgeshire SE) that in 1996 
"we 
will be looking forward to a community not of 16, but 
considerably larger and the kind of arguments which have been 
tossed about in this House in recent months and years will be 
well out of date by then. I cannot imagine that the EU will be 
able to accommodate more members than 16 without a very radical 
look at many aspects of its institutions and policies, such as 
the common agricultural policy." [passage omitted]

<F P=106> [By Ian Graham, PRESS ASSOCIATION] </F>
  [Text] The IRA tonight announced a three-day ceasefire from 
Tuesday next week as Prime Minister John Major arrived in 
Northern Ireland for a visit. 
  Speculation had been rife that a ceasefire was imminent and 
that it could be open-ended. In the end, they said they were 
suspending offensive military action for 72-hours from midnight 
Tuesday, April 5 to midnight Friday, April 8. 
  The IRA said: "Our statement of March 13 reiterated our 
continued willingness to be positive and flexible in exploring 
the potential for moving the situation forward. As further 
evidence of this, we will unilaterally suspend offensive 
military action for 72 hours from midnight Tuesday, April 5 
until midnight Friday, April 8. There are no conditions attached 
to this unilateral initiative, but we hope that the British 
government will accept this further opportunity in the spirit in 
which it is offered and utilise it to the best advantage of the 
British and Irish people." 
  The IRA made it clear that what they wanted was 
clarification 
of the Downing Street declaration signed by Mr Major and Albert 
Reynolds on December 15 and not immediate negotiations. 
  It is understood the thinking behind the statement was that 
the IRA wanted to make what they considered to be a gesture of 
goodwill in an effort to break the current impasse. 
  The Government has repeatedly insisted that there can be no 
talks with Sinn Fein until the declaration was accepted and a 
permanent end to violence called and seen to be in operation. 
  The IRA statement also said: "Making peace is a difficult 
business for all involved but the difficulties must be overcome. 
That too is the responsibility of all involved but particularly 
the British Government. We hope that the further opportunity 
here provided is used to that purpose and effect." 
  Mr Major, arriving in Belfast shortly before the IRA's 
announcement tonight, said he thought a ceasefire over the 
Easter period would be cynical. What people wanted was a 
permanent end to violence, not just a brief public relations 
gesture. 
  The Prime Minister said he had heard reports and speculation 
but had not received confirmation about a ceasefire, and added: 
"I have to say I think a ceasefire over the Easter period would 
be cynical. What people in Northern Ireland want is not a 
ceasefire over two or three days, but a permanent end to 
violence. That is very much what I want, I believe it is what 
all people in Northern Ireland wish to see. That is the message 
we wish to hear, not just a brief public relations gesture."

<F P=106> [By Chris Moncrieff and Ian Graham, PRESS ASSOCIATION] </F>
  [Text] The Prime Minister today accused the IRA of using 
its "self-serving and cynical" three-day ceasefire to deceive 
the gullible into believing it was a road to peace. Mr Major, 
on a lightning tour of Northern Ireland, said: "The fact is the 
gullible ought not to be deceived." 
  He was speaking at the start of a hectic day in which he 
will 
make a whirlwind tour of the province. He did not answer 
questions about the Tory leadership crisis and the row in London 
over the Euro votes "climb down." But he used the opportunity 
at Hillsborough Castle to underline his stark denunciation of 
last night's ceasefire announcement, due to take effect from 
Tuesday. 
  He rejected suggestions that he and Dublin Premier Albert 
Reynolds were no longer in step on this issue. "I think the 
Taoiseach's [Prime Minister Reynolds] view and my view over the 
course that the IRA need to take is quite clear. They need to 
stop the violence and they need to stop violence for good," he 
said. "We committed ourselves to that in the Joint Declaration. 
I have repeatedly said that since and so has the Taoiseach." 
  Mr Major was also critical of those -- including Sinn Fein 
president Gerry Adams -- who said that people should build on 
this three-day ceasefire. "The ceaefire is a very cynical 
exercise.... What effectively the IRA are saying is that on 
Tuesday, Wednesday and Thursday they will decide not to attack 
people and not to kill people," he said. "On Friday, Saturday 
and Sunday they will then go back to killing people. I do not 
think that is satisfactory." 
  But Mr Adams asked: "What is the alternative? Are we going 
to continue to be locked into armed conflict in perpetuity? Is 
this what is opening up for us, is it going to continue forever? 
I would hope that Mr Major -- who made a kneejerk reaction last 
night -- would reflect on his position, will send the right 
signals, will make it easier, rather than more difficult for 
Republicans to engage in the peace process." 
  Senior Sinn Fein official Martin McGuinness said: "We are 
still very much interested in the establishment of a meaningful 
peace process. What we're trying to do is lay down the 
foundation stones on which the bricks of peace can be built." 
  In Washington where President Clinton came under a barrage 
of 
criticism for allowing Mr Adams a visa earlier this year, the 
White House said it hoped the ceasefire -- the first in 19 
years, apart from the traditional Christmas truces -- would be a 
step towards an IRA renunciation of violence. It also urged the 
IRA and Sinn Fein to accept the Joint Declaration. 
  Meanwhile, Mr Major said: "The only message we want to hear 
from them is that they have decided to give up violence for 
good. I am sure everybody would wish to see that. I would like 
to see them entering the democratic process. The Joint 
Declaration opens the door for them to do precisely that. They 
know what needs to be done. If they genuinely wish to play a 
democratic part in the future of politics in Northern Ireland 
there is a route they can take, there is a road for them to go 
down. They have thus far failed to do so." 
  Referring to the Joint Declaration, he said: "As far as 
clarification is concerned the document stands on its own 
merits. It is perfectly clear to everyone else what it means. 
It is perfectly clear to Sinn Fein as well. What they are 
trying to do is to encourage the Government to believe that 
there is some extra step to draw the Government into 
negotiations. The fact is the gullible ought not to be 
deceived." 
  Mr Major added: "At the moment the IRA and Sinn Fein are 
under pressure. I intend to stand by the Joint Declaration. I 
hope everyone else will keep up the pressure. A three-day 
ceasefire is not going to change the future of Northern Ireland. 
They must stop the violence permanently and then in due course 
enter the constitutional talks. They should stop killing people 
permanently. They should stop wrecking people's lives 
permanently."

<F P=106> [Statement by Sinn Fein president Gerry Adams] </F>
  [Text] "Sinn Fein welcomes tonight's development. It 
represents an important initiative and has created an 
opportunity to break the stalemate in the peace process. 
  ``This stalemate was created and is sustained by the British 
Government's repeated refusal to provide clarification to Sinn 
Fein about the Downing Street Declaration and the processes 
envisaged in it. Such clarification has been provided to all 
the other parties. It should now be provided to Sinn Fein as a 
matter of urgency. Direct dialogue is the obvious and most 
effective method of doing this. I call upon John Major to 
authorise direct and immediate talks between our party and his 
Government representatives so that the peace process can be 
moved forward. 
  ``Just as importantly, direct dialogue would also indicate a 
genuine interest on the part of the British Government in 
developing a real peace process through the esential recognition 
of Sinn Fein's rights as a political party, the validity of our 
mandate and the democratic integrity of our electorate. 
  ``Sinn Fein has no great concern to be engaged in bi-lateral 
discussions on constitutional matters with the London 
government. I have publicly outlined my position is this regard 
on a number of occasions. This is, properly, the business of 
future talks involving the two governments and representatives 
of all the Irish people, including Sinn Fein. 
  ``This, however, is not the point of our reasonable calls 
for 
clarification. Clarification clearly is not negotiation. 
Clarification is required so that Sinn Fein, and everyone else, 
can properly and fully explore how the peace process can be 
moved forward at this time and, specifically, how the Downing 
Street Declaration fits into this. 
  ``I understand that Mr Major faces many difficulties. 
Tonight's announcement clearly eases some of these. It should 
be built upon. The search for peace requires imagination and 
determination.''

<F P=106> [By Chris Parkin, PRESS ASSOCIATION, Dublin] </F>
  [Excerpt] The Dublin government reacted with caution and 
disappointment tonight to the IRA's declaration of a three-day 
ceasefire. The terror group's announcement was welcomed -- but 
only as a potentially interim step. 
  Prime Minister Albert Reynolds stressed that what was really 
needed was a permanent end to the Northern Ireland-linked 
violence. That was the only way, he said, that the political 
process could be moved forward. 
  The hope was that the development could be built on to 
create 
a long-term cessation of terrorism, officials in the Irish 
capital added. 
  That prospect was envisaged earlier this month by deputy 
Irish Prime Minister and Foreign Minister Dick Spring. He 
controversially looked ahead to a temporary IRA ceasefire 
providing a foundation for moves towards a political settlement 
of the Ulster conflict. 
  In subsequent comments, though, Mr Spring made it clear that 
only a permanent rejection of violence by the hard-line Irish 
Republicans would permit them to enter the constitutional 
political arena. 
  The Dublin sources made no attempt to cloak their 
disappointment that the IRA had not gone the whole way in 
tonight's statement. And, speaking ahead of the anticipated 
development, Irish Prime Minister Albert Reynolds said he would 
study the contents of any announcement that was made. But he 
added: "While any reduction in violence would be welcome, a 
short term one, or one of short duration would be disappointing. 
I would be disappointed because what the situation demands at 
this stage is -- in order to move the peace process forward -- a 
cessation of violence." [passage omitted]

<F P=106> [Report by Richard Savill: "Dublin Closes Terrorist </F>
Extradition Loophole"] 
  [Text] Belfast -- The Irish Senate yesterday approved 
extradition legislation designed to close loopholes that have 
caused friction between London and Dublin. 
  The Extradition (Amendment) Bill, 1994, due to become law 
within two months, extends the range of offences that cannot be 
regarded as political. 
  Westminster MP's were furious when the Irish High Court 
recently freed Joseph Magee, 27, from Armagh, who was wanted in 
England in connection with the murder of Sgt Michael Newman, 34, 
in Derby on April 14, 1992. 
  Two of the three grounds given for quashing the extradition 
order were that the offence was political and that the procedure 
followed when his extradition was ordered by the lower District 
Court had been unfair. The legislation is designed to close 
both loopholes. 
  The new law would mean that people committing violent crimes 
involving firearms and explosives would no longer be able to 
claim their offence was political.

<F P=106> ["C.G."-signed report: "Argument With Yang Xiao Over Human </F>
Rights"] 
  [Text] Bonn, 28 Mar -- Differences over human rights were 
confirmed during a meeting between Justice Minister 
Leutheusser-Schnarrenberger and Chinese Minister Yang Xiao in 
Bonn. The Chinese minister responded to Minister 
Leutheusser-Schnarrenberger's calls that human rights be 
observed by drawing a distinction between individual and 
collective human rights. It is "only natural" that, "because of 
differences related to the social order, economic development, 
and cultural background," views about human rights should 
differ. Yang Xiao said that human rights possess both a general 
validity and a validity under special circumstances. "In the 
Chinese view, human rights constitute a dialectic unity, and 
collective human rights are a precondition for guaranteeing 
individual human rights." Mrs. Leutheusser-Schnarrenberger gave 
Yang Xiao a list of 12 human rights activists who have been 
imprisoned. Yang Xiao assumed that the list was the same one 
that had been handed over by Chancellor Kohl during his visit to 
Beijing in November 1993 and according to information provided 
by the prison service, 11 of the 18 people [on Kohl's list] do 
not exist, two are in prison, and the others have either been 
freed or placed on probation. Others are receiving medical 
treatment outside prison after bonds had been paid. Mrs. 
Leutheusser-Schnarrenberger insisted that the list had been 
prepared on the basis of "concrete information." 
  Mrs. Leutheusser-Schnarrenberger said that "a basic 
consensus 
on fundamental and human rights issues" is the essential basis 
for cooperation between the two justice systems. China has 
acceded to UN agreements and like all member states, it must 
adhere to them. Even dialogue between states is a fixed element 
in international law. That is why German reminders do not 
constitute interference in China's internal affairs. Germany 
respects regional and national differences and can also 
understand the viewing of legal matters in collective terms. 
  Nevertheless, there is a generally applicable basic human 
rights core. "I would welcome it if the Chinese Government gave 
a clear indication that it would strengthen the political will 
to achieve a real change in the human rights situation in 
China." It is true that there are signs that the independence 
of the courts is being enhanced and law enforcement functions 
exercised by bodies not connected with the courts are being 
reduced. However, reports provide grounds for concern. People 
accused must have the opportunity to defend themselves. 
International norms on eliminating torture and other inhumane 
or humiliating forms of treatment must be adhered to. 
  Following talks at Bonn's Justice Ministry, there was 
another 
confrontation at the Petersberg. The bloody crushing of the 
peaceful demonstration on the "Heavenly Peace Square" in Beijing 
in 1989 and the wave of arrests and prison sentence have had a 
very negative impact on relations, said Mrs. 
Leutheusser-Schnarrenberger at the dinner. "The basis, which 
had developed over years, of exceptionally great trust and 
intensive, successful cooperation between our countries was 
endangered and open to serious questions." Now, "present 
obstacles" must be freely discussed and eliminated. "Objections 
about impermissible interference in internal affairs only 
eliminate discussion and not the actual obstacles to fruitful 
cooperation." It is not a question of patronizing. It is 
possible that a liberal view of man involving guarantees for 
individuality, independence, decisionmaking freedom, and 
personal responsibility cannot be transferred to the Chinese 
Constitution, which has a collective character. 
  More cooperation in the judicial sphere can only be achieved 
"if the indissoluble link between economic and political 
freedom, between closer political ties and progress in the field 
of human rights is more apparent and adhered to." 
  Yang Xiao responded that states have the right, in 
accordance 
with their laws and within the framework of their legal order 
"to combat all criminal acts, including counterrevolutionary 
crimes." No one has the authority, not even the Chinese justice 
minister, to interpret laws or change them at their discretion: 
"The state has the right to use coercion within the framework 
of its laws." However, "China is ready on the basis of equal 
rights" to hold discussions with Germany about "differences of 
opinion." China is working on developing its legal system as it 
creates "a socialist free market economy." Beijing wants to use 
the experiences of other countries in "developing a legal system 
connected with a free market economy." The legal order is an 
important instrument for safeguarding peace and promoting 
development. Cooperation between the Chinese and German Justice 
Ministries should be geared toward jointly combating 
international crime, protecting investments, and safeguarding 
"interests in the civilian field."

<F P=106> ["ulf"-signed report: "The Billion-Dollar Deal With Iraq Is </F>
Being Investigated"] 
  [Excerpt] Frankfurt, 29 Mar -- According to new 
information, German authorities suspect that the apartment block 
where the firm "Ary Design Jewelry" resides -- the company has 
applied to the Iraq Sanctions Commission for a permit to export 
goods worth $1 billion to Baghdad -- is also being used as a 
base for a Middle Eastern intelligence service, which is 
suspected to be the Mosad. That could explain why the UN Iraq 
Sanctions Commission noticed inconsistencies in the export 
application from a German company. Other circles maintain that 
the owner of the firm "Ary Design Jewelry" is a certain Ariel 
Schweininger, who has frequently attended international 
conferences on the proliferation of nuclear, biological, and 
chemical weapons, including ones in Stockholm. Schweininger, who 
uses only the Christian names Axel and Andreas in Germany, could 
not be reached on Tuesday [29 March]. Apparently -- it is 
rumored in New York -- a Middle Eastern intelligence service has 
lodged applications with the Iraq Sanctions Commission on 
several occasions, some of which have been approved. Now, the 
people in New York have become "suspicious." 
  According to information from the German authorities, the 
Mannheim company's application for the export deal with Iraq is 
being checked with "great skepticism." On Tuesday, a spokesman 
for the Federal Export Agency in Eschborn said the authorities 
had submitted certain questions to the owner of the company but 
these had not been answered as yet. The Federal Office of 
Foodstuffs and the Federal Office for the Agricultural Market 
also reported that the business was "very dubious." The 
Mannheim state prosecutors office has launched a preliminary 
investigation in connection with the affair. The Foreign 
Ministry denied that there had been omissions in its handling of 
the export application from the Mannheim firm "United Oil 
Company" as this newspaper reported on Tuesday. [passage omitted]

<F P=106> ["rex"-signed report: "Bonn Supports War Against Kurds"] </F>
  [Excerpt] Bonn -- With weapons deliveries, Chancellor 
Helmut Kohl is supporting the terrorism of the Turkish Army 
against the Kurds. This accusation was leveled by Tilman 
Zuelch, president of the Association for Threatened Peoples. 
Between 1985 and 1991 alone, military equipment worth 3.6 
billion German marks was exported to Turkey. 
  Together with Kurds, the Association for Threatened Peoples 
continued the vigil in front of the Defense Ministry in Bonn 
yesterday. They wanted to protest against Bonn's hostile 
foreign policy vis-a-vis the Kurds, a statement read. 
  Zuelch accused the Bonn government of having given away free 
a large quantity of military equipment of the former People's 
Army to Turkey. It included 300 armored personnel carriers and 
350 armored vehicles, 100,000 bazookas, 250,000 submachine guns, 
and 500,000 rounds of ammunition. Foreign Minister Klaus Kinkel 
confirmed on Monday [28 March] that the Federal Government has 
been assured that German weapons are not being used in 
Kurdistan. The Turkish Government is doing "everything possible 
to keep this promise," Kinkel stressed. [passage omitted]

<F P=106> [Report by Ferdos Forudastan: "Special Prison for Kurds?"] </F>
  [Text] Bonn, 29 Mar -- Interior Minister Manfred Kanther 
(Christian Democratic Union) seems to be considering concluding 
an agreement with Turkey under which deported Kurds would be 
detained in special prisons to which human rights organizations 
would have regular access, FRANKFURTER RUNDSCHAU has been told 
by government circles. With this measure, Kanther wants to 
remove obstacles to deporting Kurds that participated in the 
recent riots. Since these people are threatened with being 
tortured or sentenced to death in Turkey, deporting them is 
legally difficult, if not impossible. 
  This idea met with skepticism by part of the government. The 
idea of a "transparent model human rights prison" in Turkey is 
"not very convincing" and not very realistic, they said. 
  On Tuesday [29 March], the interior minister's suggestion 
was 
also discussed by representatives of his own ministry, and the 
Foreign and Justice Ministries. Officials wanted to have a 
general discussion on the chances of an agreement with Turkey. 
After the talks, the Foreign Ministry said that a special 
agreement with Turkey is "not considered appropriate" as Turkey 
is bound by international agreements against torture in any 
case. Nevertheless, all possibilities should be investigated. 
  Turkey has shown an interest in a deportation agreement for 
Kurdish rioters. Oezdem Sanberk, state secretary in the Foreign 
Ministry, said on Tuesday that it is important that such an 
agreement does not "violate the law in Turkey or Germany." 
  Hartmut Baeumer (Greens), president of the Giessen regional 
administration, does not share the view of Hesse Interior 
Minister Herbert Guenther (Social Democratic Party of Germany). 
Baeumer told FRANKFURTER RUNDSCHAU that he does "not consider" 
deportations "to be the right solution." Deportations might be 
held up for six months. In order to protect the "real victims" 
of the civil war in Turkey, German politicians must now "have 
backbone, even if it is difficult," Baeumer said.

<F P=106> ["pra"-signed report: "Stammheim at the Bosporus?"] </F>
  [Text] The political reaction to the Kurdish protest has 
lost all perspective. The Kurds are accused of breaking the 
law. The deportation at any cost, which is propagated by the 
FRG interior minister, is nothing else -- namely the 
announcement that international agreements will be violated. To 
what extent the rule-of-law self-poisoning has progressed is 
shown by the plans that were discussed at the level of ministry 
officials in Bonn: The German Kurds are to be imprisoned in a 
special prison in Turkey, some kind of prison for terrorists. 
  Minister Kanther has denied that he is tending toward such 
ideas. Nevertheless, such considerations are a symptom of the 
time because they take the unscrupulousness of the official 
policy to its end. Turkey is interpreting this (not without 
justification) in its own way, namely as follows: Bonn supports 
our war against the Kurds. 
  If the Lower Saxon farmers block the A-1 highway for a day, 
this is despair. If the Kurds block the highway, this is a 
serious violation of the law relating to civil disorders and 
rioting, dangerous interference with road traffic, and 
resistance. If German truck drivers block the border 
checkpoint, the politicians express understanding and share 
their concern for their economic existence. However, if the 
Kurds despair because of the killing of their families in 
Kurdistan, they are killed as terrorists. 
  The point is not condoning crimes. Rather, the point is to 
punish them appropriately. Bonn politics does something else: 
It uses the Kurdish protests to fan the mood for destroying the 
remnants of a humane aliens and asylum law.

<F P=106> [Interview with German Republikaner leader Franz Schoenhuber </F>
by Andrea Tarquini; place and date not given: "The Wind From 
the Right Will Blow Throughout Europe"] 
  [Text] Bonn -- Republikaner leader Franz Schoenhuber 
is the only German political exponent to be satisfied with the 
results in Rome. A former Nazi SS shock trooper, he currently 
risks being brought to trial. The magistrature is considering 
this possibility because, following the attack on the Luebeck 
synagogue, he confirmed that, in his opinion, Jewish community 
leader Ignatz Bubis was an instigator of ethnic hatred and 
responsible for antisemitism. 
  [Tarquini] What do you think of the vote in Italy? 
  [Schoenhuber] It is the beginning of a Europewide turn to 
the 
Right, which will be particularly marked in East Europe. 
  [Tarquini] Why in the East particularly? 
  [Schoenhuber] Because, having traveled widely from Russia to 
the Baltic, and Ukraine, I am convinced that a national ethos 
will play an increasingly important role, especially in the 
East. This will also be a reaction, on the part of national 
consciousness, against communist internationalism; and I believe 
that, in general, Europe as a whole is looking to the Right. 
  [Tarquini] Why? 
  [Schoenhuber] It seems to me that the Christian parties, in 
particular, have lost all credibility. They have lied to the 
people for decades, and they must now pay for the consequences, 
as happened in Italy. 
  [Tarquini] Do you believe National Alliance will play a 
leading role in government? 
  [Schoenhuber] I cannot tell from here, as a German. I can 
only say that my fellow members of the European Parliament in 
Strasbourg who are in the MSI [Italian Social Movement], are 
democratic and reasonable, and they have all my respect. 
  [Tarquini] Are you hoping that there will be repercussions 
in 
Germany? 
  [Schoenhuber] The political situation in Germany will 
become, 
in a sense, italianized. In our country, the establishment 
parties will also have to foot the bill, though it may not be as 
steep as in Italy. They have received an ominous message from 
the Italian elections. 
  [Tarquini] What sort of Italy and what sort of Germany do 
you 
expect to see two years from now? 
  [Schoenhuber] To begin with, a democratic Italy and a 
democratic Germany, with a stronger national consciousness. The 
way that Italians are trying to solve their political problems 
is setting an example throughout Europe. Secondly, the 
traditional and left-wing party alignments are now outdated in 
the whole continent. 
  [Tarquini] Does the right turn involve the risk of social 
tensions? 
  [Schoenhuber] Life is full of risks in itself. You cannot 
live without risks, but they must be calculated risks. 
  [Tarquini] Do you believe that it is correct to reopen 
territorial questions in Europe, including, say, Alto Adige and 
former German territories in the East? 
  [Schoenhuber] The territorial question will be posed, though 
democratically. There is no room in my party for advocates of an 
Alto Adige annexation. I am demanding the right of every people 
to self-determination, not annexations.

  [Text] The Russian military has admitted that it blew up 
ammunition earlier this month at the military training ground of 
Colbitz-Letzlinger Heide. The explosions caused earthquake-like 
tremors and alarmed people living in and around Stendal and 
Gardelegen. A Russian major general said the withdrawing troops 
had destroyed ammunition which was old and unsafe to transport. 
They had neglected to obtain an explosion permit.

<F P=106> [Interview with Wolfgang Piller, president of the National </F>
Association of the German Aviation and Aerospace Industry, by 
Peter Schmalz; place and date not given: "Europe Is Not Ready 
To Follow the German Model"] 
  [Text] [Schmalz] As early as one year ago, Fighter-90 was 
supposed to take off. It has now been given the name of 
Eurofighter and still has problems flying. Is this project, 
which involves enormous sums, too big for the industry? 
  [Piller] Let us talk about the name. The name Fighter-90 
developed -- similar to the term "great bugging campaign" -- as 
a result of public discussion. Eurofighter is not the final 
name either. One should always give things a name that 
describes the contents properly. What is important is that it 
is a European air defense aircraft. 
  [Schmalz] But the air defense aircraft is not yet able to 
fly. Is the project too complicated? 
  [Piller] It is complicated because it is one of the most 
extraordinary high-technology projects in Europe. However, it 
is certainly not too big a challenge for the European aviation 
industry in the technological sense. Quite the contrary. With 
projects like the Tornado and the Airbus, the Europeans have 
proven that they are capable of top achievements. The Tornado 
is the best fighter aircraft of its kind, and the Airbus family 
belongs to the technical vanguard in the civilian aviation 
industry. Yet the difficult political process of arriving at a 
decision did not promote the project. You can imagine how 
difficult it is to tell a crew of thousands of technicians and 
engineers alternately to stop and to continue their work. 
Moreover, there was the crash of the Gripen interceptors... 
  [Schmalz] ...a Swedish prototype. 
  [Piller] ...which requires great care. We must not forget 
that aircraft of this kind are aerodynamically unstable. Only a 
highly complicated control mechanism keeps them in the air. The 
software is of decisive significance here because we do not want 
to take any risks. Also, there is no hurry because, if the 
European combat plane is to be bought by the Bundeswehr in the 
year 2002 or even 2003, it will still be early enough if the 
maiden flight takes place some time this year. 
  [Schmalz] The problem regarding software seems to be that 
numerous countries and an even larger number of firms are 
involved in the development. 
  [Piller] I am not sure whether this is the reason for the 
delay. Cooperation is difficult because it took such a long 
time for the four responsible countries to agree on the tasks 
that the aircraft has to fulfill. The borders in Europe were 
also a problem. Goods are involved here that fall under the war 
weapons control law. I have repeatedly been informed about 
delays that were linked with the German foreign trade law -- if 
components had to be transported to other European countries, 
for example, that had to be integrated into a subsystem. In 
fact, we always claim that we no longer want any borders, but we 
Germans are doing a great deal in this sphere to maintain the 
borders and to prevent European harmonization regulations. 
  [Schmalz] When will the first European fighter fly? 
  [Piller] We are confident that the first prototype built by 
us in Manching will make its first flight late in the spring. 
  [Schmalz] The industry is being accused of juggling with the 
prices. Might this still lead to a failure of the fighter plane? 
  [Piller] I do not think so because, on the basis of the 
offer submitted by the industry, the prices mentioned at the 
time are being adjusted according to a certain procedure. This 
is one aspect. On the other hand, however, one must bear in 
mind that a development project extending over several years is 
involved here upon whose completion a decision will be made as 
to whether it will be purchased or not. This is an unusual 
case. Moreover, the responsible officials have not made any 
final statements as to what the aircraft should look like and, 
above all, how many units are to be produced. 
  [Schmalz] Will the aircraft be produced on a large-scale 
basis? 
  [Piller] I proceed from this premise because I still believe 
in a certain rationality among politicians. If politicians 
think rationally, they must be aware that national defense and 
fulfilling the duties within the alliance are not possible 
without national armed forces. As the example of Yugoslavia has 
shown, these duties cannot be fulfilled without a functioning 
air defense. 
  [Schmalz] Is the awareness of the need for defense 
decreasing? 
  [Piller] Yes, indeed. Yet the pendulum has starting 
swinging in the other direction again. Shortly after 
reunification and the collapse of the Soviet Union, 85 percent 
of the Germans were convinced that eternal peace would break 
out. However, a glance at the newspapers shows that we are 
confronted with a larger number of conflicts that also affect 
Europe today than at any time in the past. 
  [Schmalz] A man like Zhirinovskiy might also open people's 
eyes... 
  [Piller] As a citizen of this country, I hope that we will 
realize our interests, opportunities, and dangers without such 
phenomena. However, the awareness that vigilance and readiness 
for defense continue to be necessary is certainly being promoted 
by people like Mr. Zhirinovskiy. 
  [Schmalz] Your employer is the German Aerospace Company, 
which offers a considerable range of military products. How do 
you feel about the term "weapons concern"? 
  [Piller] I have two different feelings. First, the 
precondition for your question does not exist because the share 
of defense technology in the German Aerospace has dropped to 27 
percent. Second, I believe that stability and peace must be 
paid for and defended if need be. To ensure that, products are 
required that must be developed and produced. In Germany, the 
term weapons industry belongs to the arsenal of rhetorical and 
semantic warfare. It certainly has a negative connotation in our 
country. However, I would like to use it in a positive way and 
claim: Possessing weapons means having the required instruments 
for all vicissitudes of life. In the private sphere, this is a 
matter of course for us. We take out insurances for household 
equipment and against fires and old age insurances, and we 
attach utmost significance to a good education for our children. 
Should all this be wrong in the public sector? 
  [Schmalz] A controversy erupted at the international 
aviation and aerospace exhibition in Berlin two years ago over a 
wooden model of the Fighter-90. This year the German Aerospace 
does not participate in the exhibition. Is there a link? 
  [Piller] The decision was exclusively made on economic 
grounds. The management believed that the costs for the 
participation were too high in view of the closure of works and 
the reduction of jobs. 
  [Schmalz] The threat was heard in German aerospace circles 
that production might be transferred abroad. Has Germany become 
too expensive for you? 
  [Piller] There can be no talk of a threat because we are 
confronted with natural economic laws that cannot be avoided. 
If we close plants and reduce jobs, this means that we are 
adapting our structures to competition and the economic 
development in the world. 
  [Schmalz] If the economy should recover, industrial jobs 
that have been eliminated under great difficulties will 
certainly not be restored easily. 
  [Piller] You are right. We are slowly starting to realize 
that numerous legal stipulations, collective agreement 
provisions, and other regulations have become unintended 
barriers that have a negative impact on the economy. Jobs that 
have been abolished under difficult conditions and high costs 
will in all likelihood not be recreated in Germany. The wage 
cost factor is only one aspect. The ossification of old 
structures and the difficulty to change and adapt them are an 
equally strong factor. 
  [Schmalz] You just mentioned the war weapons control law. 
Do you consider it to be part of the ossified structures? 
  [Piller] The German position on the export of military 
equipment and goods that can be used for civilian and military 
purposes is increasingly turning out to be the big obstacle to 
European integration. In fact, we like to stress day in, day 
out, and particularly in Sunday speeches the need of 
integration. Yet the unilateral German measures are a barrier. 
The aviation and aerospace industry suffer particularly. 
  Contrary to the tank and shipbuilding industries and the 
production of ammunition, up to 80 percent of our projects are 
carried out on the basis of international cooperation. If we 
want to survive, we will have to prove our ability to cooperate. 
However, this means that our partners must be able to rely on 
our deliveries. Experience has shown that particularly the 
French and the British no longer want to depend on internal 
German developments. European cooperation is increasingly 
taking place without the German industry. We know that the 
British and the French are already developing technologies for 
the successor generation of the Tornado and the European air 
defense aircraft. Initial talks have already taken place without 
the Germans because we are no longer considered reliable 
partners. If we stick to our position, there will no longer be 
a German defense industry over the medium term. And there will 
certainly no longer be a military aviation and aerospace 
industry, because an industry that is not able to cooperate will 
cease to exist in this area. 
  [Schmalz] You are cooperating intensively with the French 
on the helicopter project Eurocopter. There is considerable ill 
feeling over our "dual use" regulations. 
  [Piller] The helicopter is a classical "dual use" example. 
Like numerous other products, a civilian helicopter can also be 
used for military purposes. There will never be a satisfactory 
solution to this problem. Yet we should stop convincing Europe 
that we have the only right standards and yardsticks. Europe is 
not willing to follow the German model. 
  [Schmalz] You sound as though you were announcing the death 
of the German high technology industry. 
  [Piller] In any event, the situation is very serious. 
However, I am confident that the awareness of these dramatic 
developments is also growing in Bonn and, above all, in the 
Foreign Ministry. 
  [Schmalz] Thus, you are still hoping? 
  [Piller] My hope is based on some signs that can only be 
discerned with a very sensitive instruments. 
  [Schmalz] Have you discussed this topic with the candidate 
for chancellor of the Social Democratic Party of Germany [SPD]? 
  [Piller] I had the opportunity of holding a longer 
conversation with him. I have the impression that the awareness 
of this problems is also increasing in the SPD on a broad basis. 
  [Schmalz] Both the United States and France are proud of 
their successes in the aviation and aerospace industry. In 
Germany, one has the feeling that the strategic significance of 
this industry is not being recognized. 
  [Piller] Unfortunately, your description of the situation is 
not wrong. Yet we are convinced that the aviation and aerospace 
industry belongs to the great technological potentials of the 
future. 
  In the United States, in Japan, but also in China and other 
Southeast Asian countries, and naturally in France and Great 
Britain, it is being recognized as an integrating part of the 
economy for structural, technological, and political reasons. 
In Germany, this awareness does not exist, but we are all 
making efforts to promote it. 
  [Schmalz] Who is "all"? The teachers, for example? 
  [Piller] This is an important point: I believe that we must 
also set new priorities in the sphere of education. Natural 
science and technical training are not accorded the required 
significance. In Japan, the share of engineers and natural 
scientists among younger people is three times as high as in 
Germany. This has an impact on the acceptance of technology. 
  [Schmalz] Is that a hidden call for political leadership? 
  [Piller] I have a very old fashioned concept of political 
leadership which was shaped when I was still cooperating closely 
with Franz Josef Strauss. For me, political leadership is 
convincing people of what is necessary. This requires the 
courage to tell people that we need an economic basis for a 
national weapons industry, and that we urgently need the 
technological potentials of the aviation and aerospace industry. 
  [Schmalz] If a teacher called you, asking you for advice on 
how he can convince his students, what would you tell him? 
  [Piller] I would advise him to take his students on a mental 
journey and to ask them to imagine a world without aviation and 
aerospace industry. It is the driving technological force of 
the national economy in the industrialized countries and an 
indispensable precondition for ensuring our living standard in 
the future, because this is only possible with the help of the 
most advanced technology of the aviation and aerospace industry. 
In a science fiction film oriented on the past, one would have 
to do without the usual weather chart, and the live transmission 
of a tennis match from Flushing Meadow would be impossible. 
Without satellite communication, without the mobility ensured 
by airplanes, and without the exploration of space, our lives 
would be completely different. I am firmly convinced that we 
only discovered the vulnerability of the earth's atmosphere 
after we started moving outside our planet. The mental trip 
would also make the students realize that the world would be 
different politically and economically. The GDP would only be 
50 percent of the current volume, and starvation, oppression, 
and dictatorship would stand at twice the current extent. For 
me, it is no historic coincidence that the Soviet Union and many 
other dictatorships collapsed at a time when it became possible 
to spread information on freedom and justice across borders with 
the help of telecommunications. 
  [Schmalz] Let us return from the mental journey to the 
tough reality. The conflict over subsidies between the European 
and the North American aviation industries was not resolved in 
the GATT round. Will a hot trade war break our in the air? 
  [Piller] I hope not. Yet the following must be clear: The 
GATT negotiations represent a defeat for the European aviation 
industry because distortions of competition that threaten the 
existence of European aviation and which favor U.S. air carriers 
have been adopted. The United States is no longer interested in 
serious negotiations because it achieved its goal without talks 
-- the abolition of direct European subsidies. The United 
States will continue or even increase its extensive indirect 
subsidies for the civilian aviation industry, which currently 
amount to $2.7 billion annually, because these subsidies -- and 
particularly the military subsidies -- are not covered by the 
existing GATT disciplines. In view of the U.S. interests, it is 
imperative to create a suitable set of promotion instruments 
within a German or European framework. The simplest solution 
would be for the United States to stop subsidizing the research 
and technology projects of their industry with enormous sums. 
  [Schmalz] The Europeans are also supporting the Airbus with 
sizable sums. 
  [Piller] Historically, the direct promotion system has 
developed in Europe as a result of the numerous national states. 
This means that in Europe the development and production of 
large civilian aircraft is primarily being promoted through 
repayable loans and state-covered credits. In the United 
States, the indirect promotion of research and technology has 
developed. Billions of dollars are being provided by the 
defense budget for new technologies, engines, new wings, and 
experimental aircraft every year. The results are placed at the 
disposal of the industry. 
  [Schmalz] What sums are involved? 
  [Piller] This is difficult to say because there are also a 
great number of black boxes in the United States involving 
presumably between $2-3 billion -- projects that are subject to 
utmost secrecy. We estimate the annual subsidies for our 
competitors Boeing and McDonnel Douglas at $1 billion. This is 
a massive distortion of competition that cannot be justified in 
a private economy. 
  [Schmalz] What is the solution? 
  [Piller] The European Union should either persuade the 
Americans to stop this promotion, or the European Union should 
ensure that the Europeans receive the same subsidies. 
  [Schmalz] Boeing now wants to develop a super jumbo together 
with the German Aerospace Company. Have the Americans chosen a 
junior partner whom they would like to swallow? 
  [Piller] No, certainly not. This is not correct. The fact 
that Boeing talks with the Europeans at all shows that we are 
growing up and that we are being taken seriously as partners. 
The project itself -- an aircraft with up to 800 seats -- 
requires enormous investments which neither the United States 
nor the Europeans would be able to provide on their own. Only a 
trans- Atlantic cooperation can handle the comprehensive 
technological problems and the financial risks. 
  [Schmalz] The fact that the United States has chosen the 
German aviation industry as a partner shows that it is not 
completely at the end... 
  [Piller] No, but it is necessary to point out the 
distortions of competition stipulated in the GATT agreement in 
favor of the U.S. aviation industry and to remind the 
authorities time and again that the political framework 
conditions of the German aviation and aerospace industry have to 
be improved if it is to remain efficient.

<F P=106> ["DW"-signed report: "Bavarian Police Intensify Contacts </F>
With Neighbors"] 
  [Text] Munich -- According to Bavarian Interior Minister 
Guenter Beckstein (Christian Social Union -- CSU), the Bavarian 
police can now cooperate directly with the security authorities 
of Bavaria's eastern neighbors, the Czech Republic, Slovakia, 
and Hungary -- through a partner who speaks foreign languages 
and can be reached by phone. This is an enormous improvement 
over the existing situation, for instance in fighting the 
smuggling of cars. 
  So far, four to six ministries, the embassies, and other 
authorities had to be used in prosecuting offenses beyond 
borders, Beckstein said yesterday after speaking to his 
Hungarian colleague Imre Konya. 
  The CSU politician said that establishing an international 
investigation pool is an objective to be put into practice in 
the medium term. Only through access to other countries' car 
registration data can international car smuggling gangs be 
stopped. 
  Stolen cars are mainly taken across the eastern borders. 
Beckstein estimates that this is true for 50 percent of the 
150,000 cars reported stolen in Germany last year. The cheaper 
cars went to Romania, the more expensive ones to the former 
Yugoslavia, Ukraine, and Belarus. 
  At the Bavarian borders, 15,688 foreigners were seized for 
trying to cross the border illegally. This figure is 22 percent 
higher than last year. At the border with the Czech Republic 
alone, 13,191 persons were discovered; in addition, border 
police arrested 4,256 persons that were smuggled into the 
country, which is an increase of 89 percent over 1992. A total 
of 1,698 people were arrested for smuggling foreigners into the 
country (126 percent more than in 1992). 
  Of the 29,378 persons arrested at Germany's borders last 
year, 65 percent were seized by Bavarian border authorities. 
The interior minister considered this to be a proof of the 
particularly "intensive investigation work" done by Bavarian 
border police.

<F P=106> [Interview with Justice Minister Leutheusser-Schnarrenberger </F>
by unidentified correspondent in Bonn; date not given: "There 
Must Be an End to Minimization"] 
  [Text] [DIE WELT] Should Republikaner leader Franz 
Schoenhuber be allowed to call the chairman of the Central 
Council of Jews, Ignatz Bubis, one of the "worst instigators of 
people" in Germany with impunity? 
  [Leutheusser-Schnarrenberger] With his statements, 
Schoenhuber has unmasked himself. One who makes such a 
statement publicly after the shocking attack on the synagogue in 
Luebeck, repeats it, and is impertinent enough to bring a charge 
against the chairman of the Central Council of Jews for the 
instigation of people not only reveals what sort of person he is 
but also what political movement he stands for. There must be 
an end to the minimization of the Republikaner! The competent 
judicial authorities will have to examine whether Mr. 
Schoenhuber's statements are punishable or not. 
  [DIE WELT] Expressions of dismay about Schoenhuber's 
statement after the attack on the Jewish synagogue in Luebeck 
have come from all the democratic parties. Is verbal 
condemnation sufficient? 
  [Leutheusser-Schnarrenberger] Of course verbal outrage is 
not enough. Yet it would be a mistake to believe that an open 
political dispute can be avoided through criminal prosecution. 
In a democracy, political dispute is based on words, and 
therefore it is important to use these words in a conscious and 
responsible manner. Politicians who use terms like "mixture of 
races" and "infiltration with foreign elements" in a careless 
manner appear to have no sense of responsibility about the form 
of political dispute and the political climate in the country. 
They more or less accept that public statements like that of 
Mr. Schoenhuber, which are clearly reminiscent of our worst 
past, are possible again today. 
  [DIE WELT] Do you join those who call for legal 
investigations against Schoenhuber? 
  [Leutheusser-Schnarrenberger] I believe that Schoenhuber's 
statements might be punishable. The authorities responsible 
have already started investigations. 
  [DIE WELT] Have the politicians made mistakes if such 
statements are again possible 50 years after the holocaust? 
  [Leutheusser-Schnarrenberger] I do not believe that it would 
appropriate to speak of mistakes. However, there are alarming 
developments and politicians are partly using a language 
conducive of a climate that makes statements like Mr. 
Schoenhuber's possible again. Thus, it is important to continue 
consistently and increase the political argument against the 
right and to point out developments that might pave the way for 
demagogues. 
  [DIE WELT] Are Schoenhuber and his Republikaner right-wing 
radicals or right-wing extremists? 
  [Leutheusser-Schnarrenberger] I think that Schoenhuber's 
statements speak for themselves. No politically minded person 
will find it difficult to assess them.

<F P=106> ["Eu" report: "No All-Clear Possible Yet"] </F>
  [Text] Potsdam -- At the moment one cannot yet give the 
all-clear in the field of right-wing extremism. Despite the 
fact that the wave of violence in Brandenburg, which reached its 
climax at the end of 1992, has abated, right-wing extremism 
remains a central challenge to state and society. This was 
stressed by Interior Minister Alwin Ziel (Social Democratic 
Party of Germany) on the occasion of presenting the 1993 
Constitutional Protection Report. The paper provides detailed 
information about the activities and scope of political 
extremism as well as on the role and structure of the 
Constitutional Protection Office in Brandenburg, which is still 
in the process of being established. It is the first report of 
this kind that has been presented so far. Combating right-wing 
extremism will characterize the work of the coming years, 
Wolfgang Pfaff, head of the Brandenburg Office for the 
Protection of the Constitution, said. One needs long-term 
measures, which must also nip the problem in the bud by means of 
an appropriate youth and social policy. With this the impetus 
of the moment could be reduced. Above all the so-called Central 
German Youth Promotion Project (FMJ) continues to be the target 
of all efforts. The number of members is given as 100, with an 
upward trend. The organization openly picks up the usual topics 
of Nazi propaganda, the Constitutional Protection Report says. 
They are committed to Hitler's person and "work." Anti-Semitic 
instigation and the denial of the holocaust are evidence of the 
cynical racism that is cultivated in the FMJ. 
  Constitutional Protection also watches increasingly the 
development of left-wing extremism. Since Berlin is so close, 
it is also encroaching on Brandenburg, which is proved by the 
militant squatters' scene in Potsdam, Pfaff said. Therefore, 
the personnel dealing with leftist violence in his office will 
now be increased, he said. At the moment, there are hardly any 
activities by the Red Army Faction (RAF). The RAF has other 
priorities, but that might change very quickly. 
  Pfaff said that there are about 500 rightist Republikaner in 
Brandenburg. In the past their activities were rather limited 
because of controversies among the leaders. However, there are 
signs that the Republikaner will gain in importance in the 1994 
election year. According to Pfaff, "in the surroundings" of 
right-wing extremist organizations there are also members that 
are moving toward the Republikaner. Nevertheless, the 
Republikaner cannot necessarily be considered a collection pond 
of the rightist scene, because they are taking great care not to 
accept "real neo-Nazis" into their ranks.

<F P=106> [Klaus Rost article on opinion poll conducted in eastern </F>
Germany by Infratest Burke Berlin: "CDU Registers Some Gains in 
the East"] 
  [Text] 
<H5>  Which Party Do You Like Best Now? </H5>
  In March, one-third of those polled said "no party." That is 
4 percent fewer than a month ago, but those who are dissatisfied 
are still well ahead of the rest. The SPD [Social Democratic 
Party of Germany] still enjoys the most support among citizens 
in the new laender, although with 21 percent, it has lost 3 
percentage points since February. The CDU [Christian Democratic 
Union] was able to increase its support from 14 to 18 percent. 
This might be due to the CDU congress in Hamburg, which was 
based around Helmut Kohl. Alliance 90/Greens have overtaken the 
PDS [Party of Democratic Socialism] (8 percent) and are third 
with 10 percent. The FDP [Free Democratic Party] is still well 
behind with 3 percent, only 1 percent ahead of the Republikaner. 
  The SPD (22 percent), Alliance 90/Greens (16 percent), and 
PDS (14 percent) fare best among the better educated. The CDU 
only has 11 percent. The CDU enjoys the greatest support among 
those with a low level of education (29 percent). The Alliance 
90/Greens are the least convincing for this group and only 
obtained 3 percent. 
  The growth in support for the CDU is primarily due to gains 
in Saxony-Anhalt and Saxony. In both laender, the CDU beat the 
SPD. The SPD obtained its highest rating in Brandenburg (31 
percent). Berlin and Brandenburg are still strongholds for the 
PDS; Alliance 90/the Greens fare better in Berlin, 
Saxony-Anhalt, and Thuringia than in Mecklenburg-Western 
Pomerania and Saxony. 
<H5>  What Is the Most Important Problem in the East? </H5>
  The high level of unemployment occupies first place for the 
citizens in the new laender in March: Eighty-two percent want 
convincing solutions for combating unemployment. Nineteen 
percent of those polled complain about a lack of social security 
and justice in Germany as well as about poor economic growth. 
Seventeen percent stress a lack of internal security and rising 
crime in Germany; 12 percent stress a shortage of housing and 
excessively high rents. As in February, wage parity between east 
and west Germans occupies sixth place, but it is only considered 
an urgent problem by 8 percent of those polled rather than 12 
percent. 
  Difficulties stemming from the unification of east and west, 
environmental problems, hostility toward foreigners, right-wing 
extremism, and asylum-seekers are considered a "serious problem" 
to a much lesser extent are mentioned by between 6 and 2 percent 
of those polled. 
<H5>  In Which Party Do You Have the Most Confidence for Solving </H5>
these Problems? 
  Confidence in the ability of political parties to solve 
these 
problems has risen compared to the previous month. In February, 
between 40 percent and 55 percent did not believe in the ability 
of the parties to solve such problems. In March, the lack of 
confidence was between 35 percent and 45 percent. 
  The two major parties have gained the most in confidence: 
The SPD is still in the lead in every area. In the case of 
combating crime and the housing shortage, it has even gained 5 
percentage points. The CDU has made gains with regard to 
economic policy. Compared to the previous month, 7 percent more 
of those polled believe in the ability of the CDU to promote 
Germany's economic development and 3 percent more believe that 
the CDU can tackle unemployment. There was an increase of 9 
percent in those who think that the CDU can bring about income 
parity, and even in the case of providing more social security 
and justice, the CDU could gain 4 percentage points. The PDS by 
contrast has registered a loss of confidence in its ability to 
solve social and economic problems. 
<H5>  Questions and Views Concerning the PDS </H5>
  The main result of the poll is that the SED [Socialist Unity 
Party of Germany] successor party, the PDS, has by and large 
lost its negative image in the new laender. Of east Germans, 55 
percent consider it a good thing if the PDS were represented in 
the Bundestag in the fall. A quarter are opposed to the PDS 
being in the Bundestag and 17 percent are not sure. The 
majority of those polled consider the PDS to be a new, 
democratic party. Only 44 percent think that the PDS hardly 
differs from the former SED in its goals. Somewhat more than a 
third still view the party as being "yesterday's people 
forever," a majority of 77 percent, however, rejects the view 
that the PDS is a party that is as hostile to democracy as 
right-wing parties. 
  Now that the party's image has changed in this way, the PDS 
has created conditions for acquiring a relatively broad 
electorate. Of east Germans, 24 percent say that they would 
consider voting for the PDS in the next elections. A further 18 
percent do not rule out such a possibility. The PDS 
particularly appeals to the more educated. Of east German who 
have finished high school, 30 percent would contemplate voting 
for the party. The workers and low ranking white-collar workers 
in the former worker-peasant state are more cautious and only 16 
percent would consider the PDS. In regional terms, the largest 
potential electorate is in the north: In Brandenburg, the PDS 
has the support of 38 percent and of 36 percent in Mecklenburg. 
Support for the PDS is lowest in the south: 14 percent of the 
inhabitants of Thuringia and 18 percent of the inhabitants of 
Saxony would vote for it. 
  The PDS' appeal seems to be based on emotional matters and a 
lack of confidence. The party evidently draws support by its 
efforts to preserve the "east German identity and interests." 
In addition, 83 percent of its potential voters are of the 
opinion that the PDS represents hope for a society that is more 
just. 
  This stands in stark contrast to the PDS' poor image when it 
comes to concrete political work: Only a quarter of those 
polled agreed with the view that the PDS does a good job at the 
local level. A total of 56 percent are of the opinion that the 
PDS promises a lot, but offers few solutions. A total of 54 
percent have doubts about the PDS' ability to deal with economic 
policy and the same percentage believes that if the party were 
successful in the elections that would frighten away investors. 
Overall, the PDS does not seem to represent a political 
alternative to the established parties. It would appear to 
stand for a kind of east German identity and serves as means of 
threatening the politicians in Bonn so that they do more. 
<H5>  Which Politicians Enjoy the Most Credibility? </H5>
  What is striking is that compared to their fellow citizens 
in 
western Germany, east Germans are not guided to the same extent 
by traditional party ties. They are more influenced by current 
party policies and the credibility of their representatives. As 
in February, Regine Hildebrandt, Brandenburg's minister of labor 
and social affairs, fared the best and was unrivaled. 
Irrespective of party and land boundaries, over 70 percent of 
east Germans were convinced that she is doing her job well. 
  In second place is Minister-President Manfred Stolpe, who 
has 
50 percent. However, the new accusations and the collapse of 
the SPD-FDP-Greens coalition only occurred after the poll, so 
whether this has affected the support given Stolpe by 78 percent 
of Brandenburg's voters and to what extent remains an open 
matter. 
  The head of the government in Saxony, Kurt Biedenkopf, and 
Berlin Mayor Eberhard Diepgen have both lost credibility. 
However, they were still well ahead of their colleagues 
Bernhard Vogel, Berndt Seite, and Christoph Bergner, who are 
considered as performing their functions well by hardly anyone 
outside their laender and by only a minority within their own 
laender. 
  At the federal level, things are looking up for CDU/CSU 
[Christian Social Union] personalities. Helmut Kohl in 
particular has gained support (26 percent). He has thus reduced 
the gap between himself and his challenger Scharping, for whom 
support has fallen from 35 to 31 percent. Labor Minister 
Norbert Bluem is particularly popular among the elderly 
population in eastern Germany, especially as a result of the 
efforts that he has made for nursing-care insurance. Along with 
Bundestag President Rita Suessmuth, he enjoys the highest 
approval rating (38 percent) among federal politicians. 
  Leading federal politicians from the new laender are treated 
with reserve by their countrymen. Gregor Gysi and Wolfgang 
Thierse have seen their support drop, now 32 percent and 29 
percent respectively. However, they are still well ahead of 
Angela Merkel, Helmut Kohl's CDU deputy chairman, who obtained 
20 percent. 
<H5>  Who Is the Best Candidate for President </H5>
  As in February, 36 percent of east Germans would vote 
Johannes Rau into the office of president. Jens Reich, the 
candidate from the new laender, was able to obtain second place 
with 12 percent. He made gains among the better educated. He is 
followed by Hildegard Hamm-Bruecher (11 percent) and Roman 
Herzog (8 percent). Herzog, who is something of an unknown 
"political newcomer" in the new laender, receives no bonus 
points. He evidently lacks credibility, even CDU supporters 
view him with reserve.

<F P=106> [Interview with Thuringian Minister-President Bernhard Vogel </F>
by Bettina Baeumlisberger and Heiner Emde; place and date not 
given: "Patronizing Westerners"] 
  [Text] [FOCUS] Why is the rift between east and west 
Germans so large? 
  [Vogel] I doubt that it is so large. What is large is the 
difference in people's lives in the two parts of Germany over 
the past 40 years. This difference cannot be balanced 
overnight. Furthermore, occasionally I get the feeling that some 
west Germans now have expectations that they never had in the 
past. People from Schleswig-Holstein and Bavaria are not 
constantly hugging each other, either. The Saxons and the 
Thuringians will still retain certain individual characteristics. 
  [FOCUS] Nevertheless, the east Germans are complaining that 
the wages are adjusted too slowly and the west Germans are 
complaining about excessive burdens.... 
  [Vogel] People in Germany like to complain, in the west more 
than in the east. It is not completely incomprehensible that 
the east Germans are impatient. Frowning over this impatience 
in western Germany is largely due to ignorance regarding the 
real situation. The occasionally patronizing attitude that says 
"For us it also took 40 years" is very little consolation for 
those who have already waited for 40 years. 
  [FOCUS] The 1989-90 vision spoke of "flourishing 
landscapes"; the reality are prefabs, industrial ruins, and old 
ecological burdens. When will the landscapes finally start to 
flourish? 
  [Vogel] I will not give you any specific date, but things 
are flourishing, as one can see, and they are flourishing more 
in the south than in the north of the new laender. In a few 
years we will have fields where we will certainly be 
competitive. We will soon have caught up with Saarland; 
catching up with Bavaria will take a bit longer. 
  [FOCUS] How do you want to stimulate Thuringia's economy? 
  [Vogel] With a broad range of economic instruments, such as 
the newly founded reconstruction bank and the industry 
participation fund. This helps companies that have good 
prospects to overcome their difficulties with liquidity for a 
certain time. For instance, we must not immediately say that 
young companies are doomed to fail because they have starting 
difficulties, such as too little capital. Thuringia's great 
chance lies in the technological lead in state-of-the-art 
production facilities. The disadvantage: The number of jobs is 
lower than in the usual facilities. 
  [FOCUS] Where do the differences between the south and the 
north in the new laender come from? 
  [Vogel] Because the south is the classical industrial region 
in Germany and here the structural preconditions are much more 
favorable. One cannot be located more centrally than Erfurt, 
right in the center of Germany. We have a lot to do to be able 
to use this inheritance. Railroad tracks and roads must be 
built to make use of the advantage of a central location. 
  [FOCUS] The classical industrial region also has ecological 
burdens. Where are the billions for cleaning up the old burdens 
supposed to come from? The 3.8 billion German marks [DM] in tax 
revenues are already devoured by the personnel costs that the 
land has to pay. 
  [Vogel] The Federal Government pays between 60 and 75 
percent of the removal of the large old burdens. At the moment 
our budget situation is as follows: Of DM100 that we pay, DM25 
is tax revenues, which experience a gradually upward trend, DM25 
is borrowed, and DM50 comes from the west, in particular from 
the Federal Government. 
  [FOCUS] And now there is the election campaign. Are you not 
sometimes suffering from insomnia in view of the latest election 
disasters of the Christian Democratic Union [CDU]? 
  [Vogel] We are doing a lot of work. Therefore, I sleep 
well. By the way, the two most recent elections were quite 
certainly not successful for the CDU, but they did yield a few 
gratifying messages. 
  [FOCUS] Which ones? 
  [Vogel] We have a high turnout once again. The Republikaner 
had nothing to say, not even in Lower Saxony. And the 
concentration of the voters on the two people's parties is quite 
clear. We no longer have 60 percent as in Hamburg, but we are 
back at 80 percent. In addition, it is a good message that the 
governments are being confirmed: Minister-presidents are 
winning elections. 
  [FOCUS] Do you still expect to have your coalition partner 
in the next Thuringian Landtag, since the Free Democratic Party 
of Germany [FDP] does not achieve 5 percent anymore? 
  [Vogel] I assume that the FDP will again enter the Erfurt 
Landtag. However, I do not believe that the CDU should speak of 
an absolute majority. We did not achieve it in 1990, when 
conditions were quite extraordinary. Achieving it in 1994 is 
not realistic. It is our goal to become the strongest party. I 
would like to continue the coalition with the FDP. The FDP 
wants that, too. 
  [FOCUS] No grand coalition? 
  [Vogel] I do not want that, in particular because it would 
result in a weak opposition. 
  [FOCUS] The Thuringian Landtag elections take place at the 
same time as the Bundestag elections, on 16 October. Are you 
not afraid of the negative effect that Kohl might have? 
  [Vogel] One cannot avoid the Bundestag election and its 
influence by holding elections 14 days before or 14 days later. 
The decisive thing for me is that the turnout at Bundestag 
elections is, on average, 10 percent higher than at Landtag 
elections. This means, we will have a smaller proportion of 
left-wing extremists and right-wing extremists. After all, they 
go to the ballots in every kind of weather. 
  And regarding the alleged negative effect that Kohl might 
have: I have known Helmut Kohl since 1954. Ever since then I 
have heard similar things at certain intervals. For that he has 
been ruling for a relatively long time! There is no reason to 
hide Helmut Kohl. 
  [FOCUS] Does one have to pursue a different election 
campaign in the east than in the west? 
  [Vogel] This must not and will not be done. But the new 
laender must recognize themselves. Because there is hardly 
anything that annoys me more than when texts are formulated or 
plans are made with a patronizing attitude without us. 
  [FOCUS] How does the CDU want to overcome the negative 
trend? 
  [Vogel] By concentrating on just a few topics, such as 
economy, work, and internal security as well as credibility, 
because the disenchantment with politics has an essential place 
in the manifold lack of credibility. It is also necessary to 
listen more and to provide more political leadership. Anyone 
who always runs behind the voters just sees them from behind.

<F P=106> ["hal" signed report: "Discussion About Tax Plans Within </F>
SPD"] 
  [Text] Bonn, 27 Mar -- Views within the Social Democratic 
Party of Germany [SPD] on the party's tax policy in the event 
that the SPD wins the upcoming Bundestag elections continue to 
differ. Whereas Rudolf Scharping, SPD Chairman and chancellor 
candidate, rejected an increase in the gasoline tax in an 
interview with FRANKFURTER ALLGEMEINE SONNTAGSZEITUNG, 
Schleswig-Holstein Minister-President Heide Simonis (SPD) told 
ZDF that, over the long term, one should think about "whether 
one could use an increase in the gasoline tax to initiate 
certain developments." Thus, it is important to shift local 
traffic from private cars to public transportation. Scharping 
told BILD that he does not want to set a time limit for the 
10-percent unification surcharge for high-income earners. The 
charge will be levied until the "old inherited burdens from the 
shadow budgets of the current Federal Government are removed." 
Frau Simonis pleaded in favor of increasing the property and 
inheritance tax. Those who possess property have been spared so 
far and made sizable profits. These people "must now also 
realize slowly" that they must make a contribution to financing 
the state. According to an Emnid poll among 1,000 citizens, 55 
percent support the unification surcharge for high-income 
earners, suggested by the SPD. A total of 34 percent endorse 
the general solidarity surcharge of 7.5 percent, planned by the 
government for 1 January 1995. Klaus Kinkel, chairman of the 
Free Democratic Party of Germany, described the SPD proposal as 
a "frontal attack on the top performers in the country." The 
high-income earners already provide over 90 percent of the 
overall tax revenue.

<F P=106> [DIE WELT report: "North Rhine-Westphalia: Mafia Causes </F>
DM102-Million Damage"] 
  [Text] Duesseldorf -- Drugs, pimping, and gunrunning are 
the focal points of organized crime in North Rhine-Westphalia. 
This is demonstrated by the "1993 situation report on organized 
crime," that was presented yesterday by Interior Minister 
Herbert Schnoor (Social Democratic Party of Germany) in 
Duesseldorf. 
  According to Schnoor, in 87 investigation proceedings the 
police exposed 5,589 individual offenses last year. The damage 
is estimated at more than 102 million German marks [DM]. 
  Schnoor announced that North Rhine-Westphalia will double 
the 
number of offices for combating organized crime before the end 
of the year. Organized crime harbors a "tremendous danger 
potential" and has to be combated by all the means of the 
rule-of-law state. 
  According to Schnoor, of 2,115 identified persons who are 
suspected of crimes, 58 percent come from Germany and 42 percent 
from abroad. There are leads to 33 states in Europe, Asia, and 
North and South America. "No field is so international as 
organized crime," Schnoor said. In one of the proceedings the 
suspects came from 13 different countries. 
  The largest group of perpetrators comprised 412 persons; 
four 
other proceedings were aimed against groups with more than 100 
persons. The greatest success: German and Dutch investigators 
broke up a drug ring that produced so-called Ecstasy tablets 
with a market value of at least DM250 million for the entire 
European and North American market. 
  According to the minister, the police have already achieved 
initial successes as a result of the money-laundering law that 
came into force in late November. Last year, 158 suspicious 
money transactions were reported by financial institutions to 
the land office of criminal investigation. In 115 cases the 
suspicion of money-laundering was confirmed, he said.

  [Excerpt] Bonn/Cologne (DDP/ADN) -- The Federal Association 
of German Industry (BDI) does not share Economic Affairs 
Minister Guenter Rexrodt's positive assessment of medium-sized 
business in eastern Germany. The situation of medium-sized 
industry in the new federal states is still very volatile, 
particularly in the sectors which face international 
competition, the BDI said in Cologne on Wednesday [30 March]. 
Unfortunately there is as yet no question of a marked 
improvement. The main problems are too high wage costs, 
inadequate self-generated capital, and the difficulty of opening 
up markets for sales. 
  Rexrodt said on the same day in Bonn that medium-sized 
business in the east has successfully established itself and is 
the main pillar of economic development. At present there are 
440,000 self-employed people there, employing some 3 million 
people. That is almost half the entire number of those employed 
in eastern Germany. Manual trades, commerce, and services are 
developing especially dynamically. 
  According to him, only 550,000 jobs are left of the original 
2 million in industry. However, one can still not call this 
deindustrialization, the minister stressed. Core industrial 
areas have been preserved and there are certainly the beginnings 
of new enterprise. Rexrodt said this process, described by the 
BDI on several occasions as decimation, is the necessary and 
inevitable acclimatization to the demands of the market economy.

<F P=106> ["hsm" report: "Eastern Pensions Almost at Western Level"] </F>
  [Text] Dresden -- The pensions in the new laender have 
almost reached the west German level; pensions of women are 
sometimes even considerably higher, says the first social report 
of Saxony, which was presented by Saxony's Health Minister Hans 
Geisler (Christian Democratic Union) on Monday [28 March]. 
Because of the clearly higher employment quota at the time of 
the GDR, an east German retired couple today gets an average of 
2,505 German marks or 99.7 percent of the pension in the west, 
even though the relation of basic pensions is only about 75 
percent. While the comparable figure for men is only 86.6 
percent, women get about 130 percent. 
  However, Minister Geisler pointed out that elderly people in 
the former GDR hardly had any major assets and are, therefore, 
covering their vital needs largely from the benefits paid by the 
legal pension insurance. In order not to let the difference in 
the widow's pensions become too big, the resulting higher claims 
in the east should "perhaps be reduced" in future increases by 
some percentage points, Geisler said. 
  The minister said that he is surprised by the relatively 
high 
number -- 17 percent -- of single fathers in Saxony. Of the 
818,000 families with children, 23 percent are so-called 
single-parent families.

<F P=106> ["Kg." report: "DM3,000 Premiums for Part-Time Work </F>
Planned"] 
  [Text] Bonn, 28 Mar -- The Federal Government and the 
coalition groups are discussing financial incentives for the 
promotion of part-time work. These deliberations are under a 
time constraint because corresponding measures would have to be 
included in the draft of the 1994 employment promotion law, 
which is to be decided by 14 April. The committee discussions 
have not yet been concluded. On Monday [28 March] government 
spokesman Norbert Schaefer announced that the chancellor will 
invite the top associations of industry and the trade unions for 
a talk on expanding the supply of part-time jobs. 
  Over the weekend, FRG Labor Minister Norbert Bluem advocated 
providing financial aid of about 3,000 German marks [DM] per 
part-time job, thus winning over employers for the creation of 
such jobs. A one-time investment is economically more useful 
than the expenditures for a jobless person, who costs about 
DM2,000 per month, Bluem said. However, considerations do not 
just revolve around the DM3,000 premium for the companies. 
Rather, the intention is to pay the same amount to employees if 
they change from full-time work to part-time work. The 
unemployed are also to receive a premium of DM3,000 if they 
accept a part-time job and not a full-time job. In practice, 
the creation of a part-time job or the division of a full-time 
job could require three times the premium of DM3,000 -- for the 
employer, for the employee, and for the unemployed person hired 
in addition. The premiums are to be paid by the Federal 
Employment Office. 
  Chancellor Helmut Kohl seems to support these conditions, 
because the government spokesman expressly "indicated additional 
incentives to create more part-time work." The chancellor let 
it be said that a "part-time offensive with imagination" is 
needed. The Federation of German Employers' Associations (BDA) 
and the trade unions are discussing how more part-time jobs 
could be mobilized by means of a joint campaign. BDA Main 
Manager Fritz-Heinz Himmelreich said that the employers' 
associations are very interested in such an initiative. 
However, Himmelreich was skeptical regarding material 
incentives to promote part-time work. There is the danger of 
follow-up effects. It would probably also be difficult to 
persuade a former full-time worker who gets unemployment 
benefits to take a part-time job.

<F P=106> [Dirk Hoeren report: "Stasi Wanted To Sell Gold Worth 2 </F>
Billion"] 
  [Text] The mystery surrounding the secret pecuniary 
sources of the leaders of the former German Democratic Republic 
[GDR] seems to be resolved. In 1990, shortly after the collapse 
of the communist system, Stasi members tried to sell gold worth 
up to 2 billion German marks [DM]. Investigations are now under 
way as to what happened to the money. 
  A secret note by the Federal Intelligence Service (BND) 
revealed the following: The Stasi cover company Impag offered 
the Swiss company Jenzen AG 50-100 tonnes of gold. At the time 
the gold was deposited with "West European banks." 
  The Stasi submitted the following offer: "The delivery will 
be carried out in the form of 12.5-kg bars." The market value 
of the gold was DM1.05 billion to DM2.1 billion. 
  The Stasi offered a discount of 10 percent of the gold price 
quoted at the stock exchange to obtain the money quickly. 
  Strangely enough, the secret document has disappeared in the 
safes in Bonn. Investigations are not being carried out.

<F P=106> [Frank Wehner commentary: "Inappropriate"] </F>
  [Text] Did Kohl want to go to Normandy or did he not? 
After long guesswork, now there came a clear German no. The 
chancellor never thought of attending the celebrations on the 
50th anniversary of the Allied landing; it would be 
"inappropriate." 
  Well then: On 6 June, almost all of Europe will celebrate, 
and the supreme European ducks his head and lifts it only two 
days later for the reconciliation event in Heidelberg. 
  One does not feel comfortable about that. However, on the 
other hand, this is better for everyone. Kohl would just feel 
uncomfortable at Omaha Beach, and one would hardly know what to 
do with him. At home all those would be angry with him who 
still consider the "invasion" as an ignominy. Those, on the 
other hand, who see D-Day as an important step toward the 
liberation from fascism would have to be afraid that Kohl does 
something embarrassing. 
  Or does anyone remember that he has ever been brilliant at 
any event that dealt with the fascist past? As much as one 
ponders, the only thing that comes to mind is the ghostly event 
at the soldiers' cemetery of Bitburg. Yes, if there were still 
Willy Brandt or if there were still any politicians who never 
had problems in Volgograd! Kohl, however, likes to present 
himself in many shapes, but no one has ever got the idea of 
seeing him as the personification of antifascism. If he had 
ended up at the Atlantic beach on 6 June, he would indeed have 
stood around there as the representative of the vanquished. 
  No, June is not a good month. Only in late summer will Kohl 
thrive again. Then he will wave farewell to the last Russians, 
forgiving them for their grandfathers' having once come to our 
country. Shortly afterwards, Berlin will be completely free from 
the Allies. This is a way of coping with history that Kohl likes. 
  However, in May 1995 things will get delicate again. Oh, why 
do we not have a chancellor whom we can show on all days! It 
would be appropriate.

  [Excerpt] Paris, March 31 (AFP) -- Interior Minister 
Charles Pasqua on Thursday [31 March] warned students against 
allowing hooligans into their ranks ahead of a nationwide mass 
demonstration celebrating a government climbdown. 
  Students decided to maintain their protest Thursday even 
though Prime Minister Edouard Balladur on Wednesday scrapped a 
controversial plan to pay young people less than the minimum 
wage. 
  Pasqua, interviewed on the RTL radio, said the 3,000 
security 
forces who will be on duty had been given strict instructions to 
prevent trouble. 
  He called on students to ensure they are distinguishable 
from 
trouble-makers and to eject anyone caught stealing, looting or 
attacking the police. 
  Demonstrators "must be aware of the risks they are taking," 
he said. 
  In the past month of demonstrations against the job plan, 
more than 400 policemen have been injured when violence has 
erupted. 
  Pasqua admitted that there had been no point in persisting 
with the plan, which had been rejected by "students, employers 
and the trade unions." [passage omitted]

  [Text] Paris, March 30 (AFP) -- A French right-wing 
parliamentarian resigned Wednesday [30 March] in protest at 
France's unemployment crisis, saying the government was impotent. 
  Jean-Louis Borloo, an independent conservative who is also 
deputy mayor of the northern city of Valenciennes, said in a 
newspaper interview to appear Thursday that the current scale of 
joblessness was ruining the nation's young people. 
  "Resign is not the right word. I disclaim it. By giving up 
my mandate as a lawmaker, I want on the contrary to remain 
faithful to my mission," he said, adding he could no longer look 
at voters "in the eye." 
  Calling for a counter-offensive to put France back on its 
feet, he said: "The list of public impotence is too long. I 
want to continue to fight with my head held high." 
  Some 3.3 million people are jobless in France -- 12.2 of the 
active population -- of whom 20 percent are under 26. 
  French youngsters have taken to the streets in recent weeks 
to protest against a new draft law aimed at reducing 
unemployment by paying first-time employees 20 percent less than 
the minimum wage. The nationwide protests earlier this week 
prompted Prime Minister Edouard Balladur to effectively shelve 
the plan.

  [Text] Paris, March 30 (AFP) -- Ten sailors died in an 
accident Wednesday [30 March] aboard the French Navy 
nuclear-powered Emeraude submarine off the Mediterranean naval 
base of Toulon, military sources said. 
  They said the accident aboard the sub, armed with ballistic 
missiles, took place in a turbo engine room where electricity is 
produced with steam and in no way damaged or affected the 
nuclear part of the vessel. 
  The 10 men were in the engine room when the accident 
occurred. No further details on the cause of the disaster were 
immediately available. 
  The submarine surfaced after the accident and sailed back to 
base under its own steam. 
  Defence Minister Francois Leotard and Navy Chief of Staff 
Admiral Alain Coatanea were on their way to the base, the 
sources said.

  [Excerpts] [Announcer Patrick Poivre-d'Arvor] We now go 
live to correspondent Denis Brunetti, who has the latest from 
Toulon on the accident that struck the Rubis-class submarine: 
  [Brunetti] [passage omitted] I have beside me Defense 
Minister Francois Leotard, who came down to Toulon as soon as he 
heard of the accident. 
  [Poivre-d'Arvor] This accident is the most deadly in recent 
years in France, but there were two other incidents recently. 
Last August, a Rubis-class submarine collided with a tanker, 
and the Amethyste touched bottom at the beginning of this month. 
Is this why you have decided to recall the three other 
nuclear-powered attack submarines currently out at sea? 
  [Leotard] No, this is quite a normal measure designed simply 
to check that all possible precautions are being taken, as 
indeed they are every day. The two previous accidents that you 
mentioned are accidents that were caused by errors in command. 
The people responsible for these errors were immediately 
punished. Today we are facing a tragedy that puts the Navy and 
the nation as a whole in mourning. [passage omitted] 
  I would like to remind everyone that France's naval 
presence--and in the Mediterranean, in particular--is a national 
imperative. [passage omitted] 
  [Brunetti] Can you confirm to us that there is no risk of a 
nuclear leak? 
  [Leotard] There is absolutely no risk on the nuclear front 
in 
this accident. There was a tear in a steam pipe, which has 
nothing to do with the submarine's propulsion mechanism and 
which has nothing to do, I would remind you, with nuclear 
weapons--with which this kind of submarine is not equipped. 
There is no risk. Let us not forget, however, that this has 
been a terrible accident in which two officers and eight crew 
members have been killed and which has plunged the Navy into 
mourning. 
  We will start work on two inquiries--a judicial inquiry, 
which has already begun--and an inquiry into the command of the 
vessel. The naval chief of staff has announced this inquiry, and 
its conclusions will, of course, be public. The French people 
have to know who is to blame and know the technical reasons for 
this tragedy.

Iparretarrak, announced in a communique on Wednesday evening [30 
March] that it will continue the "armed struggle" for as long as 
"its essential aims have not been achieved." 
  Iparretarrak has, however, said that it might be prepared to 
reconsider its activist policy in the case of "an unconditional 
amnesty of all Basque prisoners and a dialogue." 
  Iparretarrak has been blamed by police for setting an 
explosive device against a military truck in Dax on Monday 
evening.

<F P=106> [Report by Paul Silvani: "Police Make Important FLNC Arrests </F>
Near Bonifacio"] 
  [Excerpts] Ajaccio -- Fourteen heavily armed Corsican 
nationalists were arrested Sunday night, 27 March, while they 
were preparing to blow up a luxury tourist spot near Bonifacio 
(southern Corsica). Several members of the commando are 
well-known members of the FLNC [Corsican National Liberation 
Front]-Historic Channel, a source close to the investigation in 
Paris explained. They apparently include a journalist from the 
Marseilles press and a nationalist wanted for a 1988 Christmas 
murder committed in a bar in Ajaccio, who went underground after 
being sentenced in absentia. 
  Should the operation mounted by the island's gendarmerie and 
police, backed up by the RAID [Research, Assistance, 
Intervention, and Dissuasion Unit of the national police force], 
on the night of Sunday 27 March in Bonifacio be seen as a kind 
of tit-for-tat response, as is being suggested in Corsica by 
some observers who think that the government has so far tried to 
play for time by handling the nationalists carefully? On 16 
February, the FLNC-Historic Channel announced the end of the 
truce in assaults which it had observed since 22 June 1993. 
[passage omitted] 
  However, the first major operation by the FLNC in Corsica 
failed on Sunday 27 March because of the steps taken by Police 
Chief Jean-Pierre Lacave. Several dozen men were asked to take 
part in a major assault intended to destroy the village of 
Piantarella (26 residential apartments) built in the tourist 
center of Sperone, which contains the island's only big golf 
course. The operation seems to have been meticulously organized 
and the deployment of these men involved the use of land and sea 
resources. But police headquarters had specific information 
which justified the dispatch of the RAID to Corsica. 
<H5>  Impressive Arsenal </H5>
  In all, 120 police and gendarmes were involved. First, four 
individuals responsible for neutralizing the guards were 
detained, then 10 others who were to plant explosives in the 
development. Shots were exchanged without anybody being injured. 
Some members of the commando group were probably able to flee. 
During the day, two vehicles, one of which had been set on 
fire, and an 11-meter motor boat, also set on fire -- it had 
probably been used to bring some of the commandos to the spot -- 
were discovered in the area. An impressive arsenal was seized: 
60 bottles of butane gas, around 60 kg of explosives (dynamite 
and plastic explosives), six assault rifles, and 10 handguns, 
grenades, and detonators. 
  The success of this operation, the first of its kind since 
Corsica has suffered clandestine nationalist violence, suggests 
that following the lengthy period of dialogue launched by Pierre 
Joxe and continued by [Interior Minister] Charles Pasqua, the 
government is now determined to put an end to erroneous methods 
which do not have the public's approval. The supporters of the 
FLNC, who are found within Cuncolta Naziunalista and its 
satellite organizations, gathered outside the Ajaccio police 
headquarters where the 14 people detained are being held. 
During the night of Monday 28 March, they were dispersed by the 
police, who used tear gas in response to stone-throwing and 
trash can fires. The detained activists will be transferred to 
Paris to appear before the 14th section of the public 
prosecutor's office responsible for terrorist cases.

  [Text] Paris, March 30 (AFP) -- General Philippe Morillon, 
who headed UN forces in Bosnia-Hercegovina in 1992-1993, was 
named head of the French Army's Rapid Deployment Force Wednesday 
[30 March]. Morillon was nominated for the position by Defence 
Minister Francois Leotard, a military spokesman said. 
  The 58-year-old Morillon will replace General Bertrand de 
Lapresle who became head of the UN Protection Force (UNPROFOR) 
in ex-Yugoslavia on March 5. 
  Morillon came to public attention a year ago for his 
outspoken criticism of the shortcomings in international 
intervention in the stricken country. 
  General Morillon will begin his new job on April 5. Under 
his command will be 35,000 men, made up of four divisions and a 
logistics brigade.

<F P=106> [Interview with Economics Minister Edmond Alphandery by </F>
Claude Jacquemart; place and date not given: "Alphandery: 
`Unemployment To Fall by End of 1994'"--first paragraph is LE 
FIGARO introduction] 
  [Text] The economics minister convincingly defends the 
Balladur government while stressing that "one year is long 
enough for our inheritance to be forgotten and too short to 
harvest tangible results." To those who believe that the 
government has not gone far enough down the road to reform and 
has been too cautious, he replies: "Rarely have 12 months seen 
as many reforms." After pointing out that the budget deficit 
"we found when we arrived in office was twice the size reported 
by the Socialists," he states: "Privatization has made it 
possible to find the resources needed to fight unemployment and 
to ensure social progress and jobs." 
  [Jacquemart] Many people say, and not just in the 
opposition, 
that the Balladur government has not reformed France to any 
great extent, especially in fields such as state education, 
where urgent changes are needed. If the government could be 
criticized for something, would it not be for being too cautious? 
  [Alphandery] What more do you want? Rarely have 12 months 
seen as many reforms! In a difficult economic context and 
without any room for maneuver, we have implemented more reforms 
in one year (and a year is a short time) than our predecessors 
managed in five years. Moreover, recent polls have shown that 
the majority of the French people agree with our actions. 
  We have implemented reforms in every domain: pensions, 
taxation, justice, decentralization of authority toward the 
regions, the environment, etc. Where I am concerned, at [Prime 
Minister] Edouard Balladur's request, I have devised the tax 
structure for the largest loan ever issued in France, worth 110 
billion French francs [Fr]; I have started to modernize taxes on 
savings; and reformed the status of the Banque de France, the 
Banque Nationale de Paris [BNP], Rhone-Poulenc, and Elf. 
  [Jacquemart] Let us talk about that. Will not this 
privatization be used, above all, to plug the gaps in the state 
budget? 
  [Alphandery] A baseless accusation! We need to both respect 
the property interests of the state and those of investors. The 
price set in each case corresponds to a medium-term price. Do 
not forget that the price of shares rises and falls on the stock 
market. As a result, we have to keep a margin when we float the 
shares. Recent experience has shown that we were right not to 
listen to what many people were saying at the time. I should 
add that we are subject to a bottom rate set by the 
privatization committee, whose independence is recognized by 
everyone and was clearly established by a law I had recently 
adopted. This is another aspect of privatization in France. 
Then again, and I am not afraid to repeat it, this 
privatization has proved a considerable success. 
  [Jacquemart] But you should have used the profits to offset 
the national debt. 
  [Alphandery] In the last six months we have made Fr76 
billion. This money was vitally needed, in particular to shore 
up economic activity, recapitalize public companies, and 
therefore, at the end of the day, to fight unemployment. 
Believe me, I would have preferred to have used the money 
generated from this privatization to offset the national debt, 
but we scarcely had any choice -- necessity knows no limits! 
The budget deficit that we found when we arrived in office was 
twice the size reported by the Socialists a few months earlier. 
In any case, I would like to point out the coherence that 
exists between the government's financial and social policies. 
Privatizations make it possible to find the resources needed to 
fight unemployment and to ensure social progress and jobs. 
<H5>  Developing Popular Partnerships </H5>
  [Jacquemart] You are therefore privatizing through necessity 
rather than conviction. We have come a long way since the 
motivations of [the last right-wing government in] 1986! 
  [Alphandery] Not at all! We have not lost sight of the 
essential reasons that encourage privatization. It is precisely 
because the French people know full well that the switch to the 
private sector is good for companies and therefore good for the 
economy, and that privatization is no longer a subject of 
ideological controversy. 
  Privatized companies now have more elbow room, in particular 
to face up to their financing requirements. Privatization is 
expanding the Paris stock market. Above all, it gives us the 
opportunity to make the French people the owners of our major 
companies by broadening the public shareholding and employee 
participation. Finally, let me add that I agreed that the state 
should assume its responsibility as a shareholder, both for Bull 
and Credit Lyonnais, solely with a view to their privatization. 
  [Jacquemart] Of all the reforms implemented by the Balladur 
government, which, in your opinion, was the most decisive? 
  [Alphandery] The Giraud law, even if it is the current trend 
to criticize it. After all, it tackles the unemployment problem 
at its roots. Why does France have a higher rate of 
unemployment than its partners? Because there is not enough 
flexibility in the job market; because the labor costs, 
especially for unqualified labor, are too high; and because 
there is insufficient vocational training for young people and 
French companies have taken too little interest in this aspect, 
unlike German companies. What we have been doing in the last 12 
months has been aimed at solving these problems. That is the 
direction taken by the Giraud law. It introduced more 
flexibility by annualizing working time and introducing services 
checks [to create more services jobs]; it reduced labor costs 
for low-paid jobs by including family policy in the budget -- an 
idea that I have pushed for for a long time -- and it aims to 
get companies more involved in youth training schemes. 
  [Jacquemart] People were expecting a government for jobs. We 
are still awaiting the results. When will the trends begin to 
be reversed? 
  [Alphandery] Of course, that is the crucial question. But 
let us tackle one hurdle at a time! First we have to restart 
the economy. When I announced last autumn, in a period of 
general gloom, that activity should take off again at the start 
of 1994 and that we would achieve growth of 1.4 percent this 
year, my forecast gave rise, at the very least, to a degree of 
skepticism. Today, this figure is being confirmed. I could 
even be accused of having been too pessimistic! Of course, 
growth of 1.4 percent is nothing to write home about. However, 
we should remember that we have only been in office for 12 
months. One year is long enough for our inheritance to be 
forgotten and too short to harvest tangible results. We need 
time before an economic policy can make its effects felt, 
especially where unemployment is concerned. Thanks to the 
combined measures of supporting the economy and the structural 
provisions of the five-year law on employment, it is reasonable 
to anticipate that we will see a reversal of the trend toward 
the end of the year. Thus, the national accounts show that 
France will again see real job creation starting next summer. 
That is an optimistic note for the currently difficult social 
climate. Moreover, France has perhaps gone too far in improving 
productivity in services. Look at the countries that are 
standing up best to unemployment, Japan and the United States. 
You can see that they have retained many service jobs in shops, 
car parks, and public transport. The government is thinking 
about how best to create more jobs in these sectors. 
  [Jacquemart] What are you most proud of? 
  [Alphandery] In a country where unemployment is rife, that 
is 
not the question that concerns me the most. However, I am 
pleased that I have been able to design a financial policy that 
aims to mobilize short-term savings for the sake of economic 
recovery. Can this money be plowed into the manufacturing sector 
-- where the jobs are created -- and be used to kindle the 
economy? That question has given rise to various measures whose 
overall coherence has not always been appreciated: Monetary 
policy that aims at obtaining a durable fall in short-term rates 
faster than the fall in long-term rates; the tax instrument of 
the Balladur loan, which I wanted to accelerate the 
consolidation of savings; a reform of savings tax to redirect 
short-term savings toward long-term investments; and the 
ambitious program of privatization which we have already 
mentioned: All those measures are intended to spark growth and 
curb rising unemployment. 
  [Jacquemart] What has been the greatest failure in your 
domain? 
  [Alphandery] In a way, our greatest failure is not having 
been able to find the right words to dialogue with young people. 
Unfortunately, the same holds true for all governments in all 
countries, irrespective of their political leanings. How can 
you convince them that the CIP [youth job training contract] is 
first and foremost their passport to their first job in the 
company and that, in that way, it is the key to social 
integration?

  [Text] Paris, March 31 (AFP) -- The number of people 
unemployed in France rose by 0.2 percent to a total of 3,312,000 
official seasonally-adjusted figures showed on Thursday [31 
March]. 
  In each of the three previous months the number of people 
unemployed had risen by 0.1 percent. In September the number 
had increased by 0.8 percent and in October by 1.2 percent. 
  The figures for February, which were published by the Labour 
Ministry, showed that the number of people unemployed continued 
to increase beyond the point of three million which was reached 
in January when it rose to 3,307,100. 
  The rate of unemployment, on the basis of a calculation used 
by the International Labour Organisation, remained steady at 
12.2 percent of the workforce. 
  Figures published by the official French INSEE statistical 
institute, which were also published on Thursday and which are 
based on an ILO calculation, showed that 3,061,000 people were 
unemployed in February compared with 3,055,000 in January and 
2,787,000 in February 1993, representing an increase of 274,000 
in 12 months.

  [Text] Paris, March 30 (AFP) -- Major French insurance 
group AGF reported Wednesday [30 March] that it made a 
group-share consolidated net profit of 977 million francs (170 
million dollars) last year, down 35 percent from 1.49 billion 
francs in 1992. 
  New chairman Antoine Jeancourt-Galignani said that banking 
activities (losses of Comptoir des Entrepreneurs and of Banque 
du Phenix) had depressed the group result by 2.5 billion francs. 
  He said the goup's over-all result should improve this year.

<F P=106> [Editorial: "French Inconsistencies in Haiti"] </F>
  [Text] Does France have a policy toward Haiti? One could 
doubt it in view of the latest government inconsistency. A 
minor inconsistency, but one which says much about the absence 
of a long-term vision. Lucette Michaux-Chevry, minister 
delegate responsible for humanitarian action and human rights, 
had decided to send a ship carrying 530 tonnes of food to Haiti 
to relieve the suffering of the population, in particular 
children. On Friday, 25 March, the military succeeded in 
preventing the ship from berthing, and threated to attack 
members of the local French community with the clear design of 
forcing Paris to retreat. 
  It would be annoying and embarrassing if the handful of drug 
traffickers, military people, and corrupt policemen who exercise 
power in Haiti were to achieve such an easy success. Last 
October, a few vociferous neo-Duvalierian "demonstrators" were 
enough to dissuade Washington from disembarking 200 U.S. and 
Canadian blue helmets tasked with guaranteeing the return to 
democracy and that of the country's legal president, 
Jean-Bertrand Aristide, overthrown in a coup two years earlier. 
The same scenario is being repeated. 
  The "neo-Duvalierians" nonetheless have certain reasons to 
denounce the "cynicism" of France, which is trying to ease its 
conscience with humanitarian aid while demanding, ever since the 
American about-face, a total international embargo on Haiti -- 
right now only arms and oil are targeted. 
  In the name of humanitarianism, Paris has demonstrated a 
democratic intransigence toward Haiti which it has scarcely 
exhibited toward General Gnassingbe Eyadema's Togo or Omar 
Bongo's Gabon. 
  The first president in his country's history to have been 
elected by universal suffrage, Jean-Bertrand Aristide, whose 
life was saved during General Cedras' coup thanks mainly to the 
French ambassador's intervention, has received unfailing support 
from Paris, which has readily minimized the errors or mistakes 
of a personality who, while very popular in the shantytowns of 
Port-au-Prince, lacks the stature of a statesman. 
  Paris has frequently found itself at odds with Washington 
over Haiti. France, whose strategic and economic interests in 
Haiti are not as great as those of the United States, is neither 
willing nor able to send a contingent of soldiers to the country 
to reestablish a semblance of democracy in Port-au-Prince.

  [Text] Let us start by looking at Silvio Berlusconi's march 
towards the premiership. Giovanni Masotti reports. 
  [Masotti] There were smiles and optimism, which was an 
unexpected development. Only yesterday Umberto Bossi had said 
no for the umpteenth time to Berlusconi's bid for the 
premiership. But today, following a 90 minute meeting, Bossi 
gave Berlusconi the go-ahead. 
  [Begin Berlusconi recording] In this alliance Forza Italia 
is 
the major force. Berlusconi is the leader of Forza Italia, he 
practically created this movement. So I cannot see how there 
can be any doubt on this matter, and this will be confirmed to 
you by the Northern League and its representatives. [end 
recording] 
  [Masotti] Berlusconi is pushing ahead, and hinted at what an 
organizational chart might look like. He also revealed that he 
has contacted the Center. Berlusconi did not rule out that the 
deputy premiership could go to a Northern League politician. He 
added that the National Alliance would be part of the 
government, although party leader Gianfranco Fini would not join 
the government by his own choice. 
  Bossi has also spoken of a first, reasonably clear and 
positive signal. He said that they are starting from a fixed 
position -- that of federalism. Bossi will meet Berlusconi 
again on Friday [1 April], and the meeting could be decisive.

Berlusconi said today, following his first [postelection] 
meeting with Umberto Bossi. Berlusconi said they will meet 
again on Friday [1 April], adding, "There is a very friendly 
climate. We are on the right road." 
  Bossi and Roberto Maroni also thought the meeting was "very 
positive." Bossi said: "We spoke, we started to thrash things 
out, and, if everything goes as it should, we will be able to 
give the country a government soon."

floor leader, by Stefano Caviglia in Rome; date not given: 
"Maroni: `A Right-Wing Government Is Close at Hand'" -- first 
paragraph is L'INDIPENDENTE introduction] 
  [Excerpt] Rome -- [passage omitted] [Caviglia] A great 
electoral success as far as the number of those elected goes, 
Honorable Maroni, but a little less in percentage terms. 
  [Maroni] It was the most difficult electoral test of our 
history. We did not succeed in explaining to everybody what we 
wanted, but we retained our identity up to the end of a battle 
in which anything could have happened. Did you see what 
happened to Rete? We, instead, are firmly on our feet. This 
means that the federalist battle is very much alive and will 
continue throughout the north. 
  [Caviglia] And that you will be able to govern... 
  [Maroni] Of course, but not at any cost. We will see if they 
accept our conditions. 
  [Caviglia] Which also includes a request regarding the prime 
minister's seat, for which [Northern League Secretary] Umberto 
Bossi has proposed you as a candidate. Is this not slightly 
excessive given that Forza Italia and National Alliance got more 
proportional representation votes than you? 
  [Maroni] You cannot base your reasoning on numbers alone. 
You must also look at political positions. We want guarantees 
that the values we have always fought for will not be betrayed. 
For this reason we are asking for the seat of prime minister. 
For us it is the best guarantee of a free enterprise and 
federalist government. But it is not a final condition. 
Instead, I really think we can come to an agreement. 
  [Caviglia] In short, there are no longer any conditions 
regarding the participation of National Alliance in the 
government. 
  [Maroni] The only condition that we cannot renounce is that 
of federalism. We could not become part of a government whose 
members are contrary to federalism. But I think there is no 
hint of this. The Social Movement has such a great desire to 
increase its votes after all these years that I do not think it 
will object. Moreover, we do not want everything immediately by 
any means. We know that one has to proceed gradually. 
  [Caviglia] And which are the first measures that should be 
taken in order to satisfy the League? 
  [Maroni] Well, to begin with, tax reform with the autonomy 
of 
local bodies is necessary. Something like that would be a first 
step. 
  [Caviglia] Well then, the government of the center-right 
pole 
is at hand. 
  [Maroni] I would say so. The others are certainly what they 
are. Did you see the scenes of [National Alliance leader] 
Gianfranco Fini's election meeting in Piazza del Popolo? It was 
full of Roman [Fascist] greetings. Our role is important 
precisely because of this. We are the anchor that is preventing 
this pole from sliding into a reactionary status. Today's 
result moreover is just the beginning. The objective is to 
create a great lineup, which is not only electoral, as soon as 
possible: An authentic liberal-democratic pole, the modern, 
liberal, and federalist Right that comes from the north. 
  [Caviglia] And what about the controversies with your allies 
[Forza Italia leader] Silvio Berlusconi and Fini over the past 
weeks? 
  [Maroni] These belong to the past. We have put these away in 
the cellar, or if you prefer, in the attic.

<F P=106> [Interview with National Alliance Secretary Gianfranco Fini </F>
by Aldo De Luca; place and date not given: "Fini: `Bossi Is 
Playing at an Increase'"] 
  [Excerpts] [passage omitted] [De Luca] If [League 
Secretary] Umberto Bossi agrees to forming a government, which 
ministries does National Alliance have its sights on? 
  [Fini] We are only interested in programs.[passage omitted] 
  [De Luca] But after the programs, the ministries... For 
example, do you have some interest in the Postal Communications 
Ministry? 
  [Fini] The telecommunications sector will be strategic in 
the 
near future. 
  [De Luca] And what about the Ministries of Internal Affairs 
and Justice: Have you thought about these? 
  [Fini] All the ministries without exception are important, 
because if one is not important there is no reason to keep it. 
  [De Luca] But some are more important. Or not? 
  [Fini] If a government coalition that includes us is formed 
we will evaluate this with our allies. 
  [De Luca] Will there also be Minister Fini at Palazzo Chigi 
[prime minister's seat]? 
  [Fini] I personally do not hold a claim to any candidacy. I 
have no intention of assuming any government position. 
  [De Luca] And who will be the National Alliance men in the 
government? 
  [Fini] I have a duty to speak to my men first. However, 
there are many that are up to the task. Names? None for the 
time being. 
  [De Luca] RAI [Italian Broadcasting Corporation]. Must it 
change? 
  [Fini] Certainly.... 
  [De Luca] How do you see the new RAI? 
  [Fini] It must guarantee a public service in respect to 
pluralism. It must be managed and administered in a transparent 
manner. It must cost less, a great deal less than what it costs 
now. It must act in the market under the same conditions. 
  [De Luca] But should it be privatized or can it remain 
public? 
  [Fini] It must be a public company but managed with private 
sector measures. 
  [De Luca] Will the three channels remain? 
  [Fini] As far as I am concerned, yes. However, they cannot 
remain three channels subcontracted out to three parties or as 
was the case recently, to only one. 
  [De Luca] Umberto Bossi keeps on shouting in your face that 
you are the reactionary Right and that he will never form a 
government with you. 
  [Fini] Each barrel gives the wine it contains... 
  [De Luca] But what game is Bossi playing: Is he merely 
raising the stakes or is he serious? 
  [Fini] We will see in a few days' time, be patient... 
  [De Luca] But what is Fini's opinion? 
  [Fini] Bossi is entirely unpredictable, it is his virtue but 
also his vice. Venturing any forecast on his behavior is always 
a risk. Everything, however, leads one to think that he is only 
playing at raising the stakes. 
  [De Luca] What are your conditions for accepting the League 
in the government? 
  [Fini] Three conditions that we cannot renounce: national 
unity, solidarity between north and south, and a prime minister 
who cannot be one of them. The latter because the League is a 
regionalistic political force and therefore not representative 
of the country. 
  [De Luca] If Bossi does not let go, will there be an 
institutional government? 
  [Fini] If I have read the numbers correctly, no 
institutional 
government can be formed, unless there is a chance that the 
League will forge an alliance with the Italian Popular Party and 
the progressives. But at that point Bossi would lose 99 percent 
of his supporters, it would be a blatant case of betrayal. 
  [De Luca] If the League does not change his mind, back to 
elections then? 
  [Fini] I think so, but I believe that this very evaluation 
of 
the facts will induce Bossi to change his mind. 
  [De Luca] The other night in Piazza del Popolo, your victory 
was celebrated with some Roman [Fascist] greetings. This is not 
a laughing matter... 
  [Fini] At a moment of joy like that, some boy raising his 
arm 
cannot worry anybody...I hope.

  [Text] Rome, March 30 (AFP) -- The leader of Italy's 
neo-fascist National Alliance Gianfranco Fini confirmed 
Wednesday [30 March] that he will not be a member of Italy's new 
government despite this week's landslide vote to a right-wing 
alliance. 
  Fini told reporters at a meeting of his movement that he had 
spoken to Forza Italia (Go Italy) party leader Silvio Berlusconi 
by telephone after the TV magnate met Northern League leader 
Umberto Bossi in Milan. Following that meeting, Berlusconi 
claimed the prime ministership, making it understood that Bossi 
no longer opposed his holding it. 
  The right-wing alliance of the Northern League, National 
Alliance and Forza Italia parties won a landslide victory in 
legislative elections on Sunday and Monday. Berlusconi and 
Bossi are due to meet again in Milan on Friday.

<F P=106> [Report by Silvio Buzzanca: "Christian Democratic Center </F>
Exultant: `There Are Plenty of Us'"] 
  [Text] Rome -- "People treated us like children, but we 
gained percentages similar to those gained by the Italian 
Popular Party [PPI]," Clemente Mastella said, with a smile. 
"They told us that there were no more than four of us, but in 
fact there are 44 of us," Ombretta Fumagalli Carulli said, 
referring to the number of seats won by the Christian Democratic 
Center [CCD]. Together with Pierferdinando Casini and Francesco 
D'Onofrio, they made their appearance at the Jolly Hotel, the 
headquarters of Forza Italia's allies; they thanked [Forza 
Italia leader] Silvio Berlusconi who, with an act of "great 
generosity," took them under his wing, and they celebrated their 
success and at the same time [PPI Secretary] Mino Martinazzoli's 
sad and lonely defeat. 
  They have won, but they remain obsessed with the PPI and 
their former party comrades. Casini urged them to consider the 
results, which "show that D'Onofrio was right to describe the 
birth of the CCD and the PPI as the birth of twins. At the time 
we were described as naive. I think that whoever said that must 
now eat their words; perhaps they alone were naive." 
  The CCD savored the subtle pleasure of being able to say: 
"Look, we were politically right; the election results have 
confirmed our option." Casini said: "The DC's [Christian 
Democratic Party] traditional centrality is over; in a bipolar 
arrangement, people opted for the pole of freedoms." This 
assertion was used to justify another blow to the PPI. "When 
people at PPI headquarters still talk about votes for the 
National Alliance as votes for the neo-fascists, it means that 
the leadership has still not realized that those are former DC 
votes. I hope that the PPI is now reappraising a line that was 
strongly tilted to the Left, and that was therefore mistaken." 
  This, because, the CCD says, they are the real center -- the 
liberal Catholics who opted to stand with Berlusconi in order to 
prevent the likely victory of the Left. An unhealed wound 
remains from the split over alliances, a rift that has not 
closed at all, in view of the fact that Casini said: "Tomorrow 
we will hold a meeting of our leadership to request membership 
of the Christian Democratic International." The deputy for 
Bologna gave to understand that he derives the right to do so 
from the election result -- a right which Helmut Kohl and the 
other European Christian democratic leaders cannot pretend not 
to recognize. 
  Someone drew attention to a statement by Formigoni [PPI], 
who 
spoke about a reflection, a prompt decision by the PPI on what 
political position to occupy, and a possible turn toward the 
moderate Right. Mastella immediately opened the door to a 
dialogue with the PPI: "I hope that they will be calm and free 
of any preconceptions. Be that as it may, they must know that 
it is not impossible to engage in discussions with us, and they 
must keep it in mind after their initial period of mourning." 
  At the start Clemente Mastella said that he would speak out 
only now after a lengthy silence. However, his silence did not 
prevent him from being elected. Now he can say: "We took a 
gamble, a gamble on a risky venture. We were treated like 
children that might suffer erosion or the risk of lack of public 
understanding; but the results confirm that we were something 
more than a handful of children spread around Italy, and that we 
enjoy a representativeness that is in some respects equal to 
that of the Popular Party." 
  Mastella wanted to talk about the future too: "I realize 
that this country needs to be governed," he said, identifying 
Berlusconi as the next prime minister: "He has scored a clear 
victory, and achieved a political miracle. To ignore this," he 
said, "would be unjust, partly because he, more than anyone 
else, believed in the building of this pole." However, he leads 
us to understand that now it is necessary to move on from 
electoral alliances to political and government alliances. He 
stressed that there is no longer any "discrimination" against 
the Right. Hence the need for "much more clearly defined 
political convergences." This sounded like an appeal to 
[Northern League Secretary] Umberto Bossi: "If factors of 
division were to prevail," Mastella said, "the election victory 
could turn into a political defeat. We have taken on an 
obligation to the voters, and we must find the way to honor it. 
I say to the League that it must overcome its anxieties about 
its allies in the south. Everyone now is agreed that the south 
no longer needs a welfare policy."

  [Text] Diyarbakir, Mar. 31 (A.A.) -- Social Democratic 
Populist Party (SHP) mayoral candidate Vahit Yigit and 
independent candidate Esref Tanriverdi filed a formal protest to 
the election board as great numbers of stamped ballots were 
found in a dump. 
  Yigit and Tanriverdi requested the nullification of the 
election. 
  Officials of the Motherland Party (ANAP) filed an official 
complaint because 6,000 ballots in the Black Sea city of Trabzon 
were found. As the local election board rejected the objection, 
ANAP officials said that they will apply to a higher board. 
  The candidate of fundamentalist Prosperity Party (RP) had 
won 
over the ANAP candidate with by narrow margin of 2,130 votes. 
  The former president of the high election board Orhan Aydin 
said, after reports on huge amounts of ballots in dumps and 
schools that the March 27 local elections might be canceled if 
the ballots found would change the result.

  [Text] Ankara, March 30, (IRNA) -- Foreign Ministry 
Director General for CIS and Transcaucasia Countries Morteza 
Bank here today said that the countries of the region should 
increase bilateral and multilateral contacts and play a more 
active role for settling the Karabakh dispute in order to 
maintain security in Caucasia and Central Asia. 
  He added that Iran and Turkey had many political and 
economic 
commonalties which required continuous contacts between the 
officials of the two countries. 
  Bank also said that during the talks with the Turkish 
officials the issue of Karabakh was raised and the two sides 
were informed on each other's stances in this regard. 
  Iran, Turkey and Russia maintain their own views regarding 
the Karabakh issue, but the commonalties of the countries of the 
region require more closness of these views, he added. 
  He noted that the Armenian and Azeri officials seriously 
feel 
that the ongoing war of attrition had gravely affected their 
economy, therefore, both countries were prepared to maintain 
peace. 
  Bank also added that the interference of some foreign 
elements as well as particular approaches of certain Armenian 
factions had caused the continuation of the war, however, he 
said, peace needs to be restored in the region.

<F P=106> [Interview with Tansu Ciller, prime minister of the Republic </F>
of Turkey, by Petur Bochukov; place and date not given: "`It is 
Our Sincere Wish To Strengthen Mutual Confidence and Cooperation 
Between Turkey and Bulgaria'"] 
  [Text] [Bochukov] Madame Prime Minister, I hope you 
remember that, on the occasion of the CSCE Conference in Vienna, 
you promised us an interview for the daily DUMA. I take 
advantage of your kindness today. Your first visit to Bulgaria 
is soon expected. What are your feelings in anticipating your 
Sofia visit? 
  [Ciller] Apart from a short period in the recent past, 
relations between Turkey and Bulgaria have always been good. If 
you consider the list of current mutual visits between officials 
of both countries, you cannot fail to notice the intensity of 
our mutual relations. I can confidently claim that relations 
between Turkey and Bulgaria have achieved a remarkable level. 
  Turkey attaches great importance to friendship, good 
neighborly relations, and cooperation with the Republic of 
Bulgaria. We are convinced that the good, friendly relations 
between the two countries are not only contributing to peace in 
the Balkans, but in Europe as a whole. 
  [Bochukov] How could the remnants of past distrust and 
mutual suspicions between Turkey and Bulgaria be eliminated, 
according to you? 
  [Ciller] I think that the problem deserves a very careful 
and objective examination. I would like to stress that our 
relations with Bulgaria have entered a new stage, leaving behind 
the past. On the Turkish side there is no hesitation whatsoever 
to normalize our relations with Bulgaria. I also would like to 
remind you that, following 1989, our mutual relations were 
promptly promoted to the highest level. We are actively working 
for an atmosphere of mutual confidence and security between 
Turkey and Bulgaria. We signed the Sofia and Edirne documents, 
whose contents are by far exceeding the Vienna document of 1992, 
which once more confirms Turkey's good will toward Bulgaria and 
our sincere wish to intensify mutual confidence and cooperation 
between our two countries. Turkey has also withdrawn military 
units from our common border with Bulgaria. 
  Turkey supported Bulgaria's efforts to join the European 
political and military structures. This clearly shows that no 
distrust and suspicions whatsoever exist on our side. 
  [Bochukov] Do you admit that not all people who profess the 
Islamic faith in Bulgaria are ethnic Turks? 
  [Ciller] From the first moment of its establishment, the 
Republic of Turkey has wholeheartedly supported a foreign policy 
based on the principles of common sense. 
  In accordance with such principles, we are willing to 
establish good neighborly and friendly relations with all 
countries, to develop relations and cooperation in all spheres 
in the peoples' interests, to respect mutual independence, 
sovereignty, and territorial integrity, to refrain from 
interfering in other countries' domestic affairs, to consolidate 
peace and understanding. These are only a few of the principles 
that we are observing. The aforementioned principles are also 
applied in our Balkan relations. 
  "Human relations" exist between Turkey and the region. We 
have Turkish minorities living in Balkan states. Numerous 
Turkish citizens have emigrated from the Balkans to Turkey. We 
regard the Turkish minorities as a bridge between Turkey and the 
country in which they are living as loyal citizens. 
  I would like to remind you that Christian Turkish minorities 
also exist. 
  [Bochukov] Do you see any other solution than the force of 
arms regarding settling your government's problem with the 
Kurdish Workers Party [PKK]? 
  [Ciller] The PKK is a terrorist organization aimed at 
dividing Turkey on an ethnic basis. Like every other government 
in the world, the Turkish Government is trying to restrain the 
terrorist activities of this organization with its own legal 
security forces. This fact is confirmed by the mass 
assassinations of women, children, and old people who are 
Turkish citizens of Kurdish origin. Our government is involved 
in a democratization process and in the defense of human rights. 
The right of living in freedom is one of the fundamental human 
rights. The violence of the PKK shall be eradicated by the 
joint efforts of all our citizens, those of Kurdish origin 
included. 
  [Bochukov] How do you see the future development of 
bilateral economic and trade relations between our two countries? 
  [Ciller] We consider the economic and trade relations 
between Turkey and Bulgaria as very promising. There is no 
doubt that a well balanced economic cooperation between the two 
countries would be of mutual interest. Hence, we should work 
for its development. 
  The present level of our mutual trade does not reflect the 
real potential of our countries. I am convinced that much more 
could and should be done. In this respect I would like to 
stress that the number of Turkish-Bulgarian joint ventures has 
attained 279. Naturally, they could be more. Our government is 
doing everything to encourage Turkish businessmen and investors 
to work with Bulgaria. We are soon expecting to sign an 
agreement in this field. Undoubtedly, this will be to the 
advantage of Turkish and Bulgarian businessmen alike, providing 
an opportunity for mutual investments. We are currently working 
on an agreement to eliminate double taxation. 
  Accepting that regional cooperation is a step toward 
European 
integration, the Balkan countries should develop their trade and 
economic relations. Proceeding in this direction, both Turkey 
and Bulgaria could obtain opportunities for larger markets. A 
similar idea was at the basis of the project to establish a 
Black Sea economic cooperation zone. 
  [Bochukov] Which economic spheres are the most interesting 
for Bulgarian-Turkish cooperation? 
  [Ciller] Considerable structural changes were recently 
introduced in Turkey. We have good opportunities for 
cooperation with Bulgaria in all spheres that your country 
prefers, and particularly related to infrastructure and building 
projects in third countries.

  [Text] Ankara -- Defense Minister Mehmet Golhan said that 
reports that military service in Turkey would be extended to 19 
months were groundless, the ANATOLIA NEWS AGENCY reported on 
Friday [25 March]. Speaking at a press conference Golhan 
discussed the reports of an extension of military service that 
had appeared on television and in newspapers. 
  Golhan said, "There was a potential threat that led to the 
decision to extend military service by four months for those 
soldiers who were supposed to be discharged in February and May. 
Apart from this it is out of the question for military service 
to be extended to 19 months." The reason for extending service 
for the two groups was explained by Golhan: 
  "Our struggle against terrorism would have been adversely 
affected if these soldiers had been released just when they had 
become fully familiar with the area of operations. New soldiers 
would not know the conditions and structure of the region. This 
is why we chose to extend their service. 
  ``Our government was planning to totally wipe out the 
vicious, outlawed Workers Party of Kurdistan (PKK), a party 
which smuggles drugs and is enslaved to Armenia. Thus we had to 
plan operations aimed at finishing off the PKK, a group which 
does its training in the winter months and attacks in the 
summer, by the summer of 1994. Furthermore, we also had to take 
security precautions in the region for the local elections due 
to take place on March 27. And as things stand, with the 
operations they carried out, our brave soldiers have broken the 
backbone of the organization. They suffered heavy casualties. 
  ``We have reached pretty far with our operations. I am not 
insinuating that we have put an end to PKK terrorism, but we are 
nevertheless half way there.'' Stressing that the PKK terror 
would be brought to an end in the summer months, Golhan said 
that an "economic terror" was also prevalent in Turkey. Golhan 
noted that it was now time to prevent economic terror, and said, 
"Turkey has a bright future ahead. Let's not be pessimistic 
about it. It is said that the automobile sector is currently 
undergoing a crisis. But, I watched the news on TV last night, 
and it was said that there has been a great increase in 
automobile sales. 
  ``I don't understand how there could be a crisis when sales 
are increasing. As for the increase in the dollar, it is no 
more than a result of having kept it under pressure for many a 
year. All of these problems will be overcome. Terror in the 
economy will also be eliminated.''

in Greece. It has been ascertained that Hasan Dag, head of ERNK 
[Kurdish People's Liberation Front], which is the PKK's 
political wing, and Retired Admiral Andonios Naksakis, who 
facilitates PKK's activities in Greece, appealed to the 
Governor's Office in Athens to approve the establishment of the 
society. It has been reported that the society will be based in 
building Number 72 on Ipokratis Street in Athens if the appeal 
is approved. 
  Turkish officials have been informed that the Governor's 
Office has not yet responded to the PKK's appeal. However, they 
assessed the initiative as being aimed at "facilitating Greece's 
financial aid to the PKK by having ERNK recognized by the Greek 
Government." Stressing that the approval of the appeal for the 
establishment of that society for humanitarian purposes will 
create an opportunity for Greece to support the PKK more easily, 
the officials said: "The realization of their project will 
facilitate Greece's contacts with the PKK through that society, 
which will supposedly be a humanitarian establishment. 
Consequently, Greece will find it easier to resist 
international reaction." 
  It is common knowledge that Greece has given material aid to 
the PKK and allowed it to establish camps in that country for a 
long time. The file that was submitted to Prime Minister Tansu 
Ciller on the PKK in December 1993 said that Greece paid 30,000 
drachmas monthly to ERNK members. It also said that Greece has 
supplied Aris antitank missiles to the PKK and deposited 100 
drachmas in the National Bank for each PKK member. The file 
informed Ciller that Greece provided $10,000,000 for the PKK in 
the form of aid in accordance with former Foreign Minister 
Andonios Samaras' instructions. Meanwhile, the PKK received 
another $1,000,000 to undermine tourism in Turkey. 
  The file also informed Ciller as follows: 
  A. The Lavrion refugee camp, which is 70 km southeast of 
Athens, has been given to the PKK. PKK activities in Greece are 
carried out by ERNK and the Kurdistan Committee in Athens. 
  B. An account has been opened in the Kaningos branch of the 
National Bank of Greece for PKK members in the Lavrion camp. 
The account number is 129/62639077. PKK members Samil Asmaad 
and Sinan Aslan are responsible for the affairs of Kurds in 
Greece. 
  C. The radio channel known as "Phonitou Kourdhistan" [Voice 
of Kurdistan] is operated by the PKK in Greece. 
  D. The Greek Ministry of Foreign Affairs has given 
scholarships to 33 PKK members in Greece.

<F P=106> [Article by Yusuf Ozal: "Economic Situation Is Critical"] </F>
  [Text] The reason we are where we are today is that we did 
not take the necessary measures at various stages in the past 
and did not adapt correct economic policies. [Prime Minister 
Tansu] Ciller says "I did not do it all by myself." This is 
partly true. However, she also says "I am trying to undo the 
mistakes of the last past 10 years." It would be hard to agree 
with that statement. I am going to give you an example to 
explain how critical is the situation we are in. The total 
balance of payments deficit between 1982 and 1992 -- Ozal 
governments and the Yildirim Akbulut, Mesut Yilmaz, Suleyman 
Demirel, and Ciller governments -- is less than the total 
balance of payments deficit in 1993. The situation is that 
serious. 
  The recent economic situation is a big fiasco. In other 
words, in this chaotic situation, one prime minister went 
through two governors of the central bank. This is 
unacceptable. This is a crisis. I know both [former governor] 
Rustu Saracoglu and [former governor] Bulent Gultekin. They are 
decent and professional officials. Gultekin has a very good 
background and he knows his job. I do not think the prime 
minister is known outside of the country as well as Gultekin 
from an academic career perspective. To make a comparison, we 
can say that these bureaucrats know their jobs better than 
Ciller. The head of the central bank reached a point where he 
was not able to do his job. Actually, this was the cause of his 
frustration. 
  Saracoglu stayed on the job because of [President Suleyman] 
Demirel. Otherwise, he would have been replaced earlier. Ciller 
does not know and understand the issues. Instead of approaching 
the issues properly, without being influenced by the others, her 
approach to issues is "I will give the orders and the job will 
get done." If this had not been the case, she would have 
appointed a minister responsible for the economy. This 
situation conflicts with modern methods of administering. She 
has no ability to administer. She says that she is a professor. 
This is true and I am sure she teaches her students about 
general economics. However, this is different from 
administering a government's economy which requires special 
knowledge. She cannot understand this. As a matter of fact, it 
is clear that she does not know the job. The recent foreign 
exchange crises happened because of her inability to manage. 
Because she said, "I will do the job myself" she did not 
appoint an economy minister. So, she is the main reason for the 
situation. However, the major opposition party leader is also 
exploiting the situation. State employees are being encouraged 
to resign. This is not patriotism. This is our own government 
we are hurting. Let people decide for themselves if they want 
to resign. There is no reason for Yilmaz [general chairman of 
the Motherland Party] to provoke them. Because this provocation 
will harm the country.

<F P=106> [Unattributed article: "Paavo Lipponen: Agriculture Cannot </F>
Get Subsidies for All Eternity"] 
  [Excerpts] That Finland got the right from the European 
Union (EU) to pay extra support to agriculture does not also 
mean that this is going to be paid for all eternity at the 
maximum level. This was stated by Social Democratic Party (SDP) 
Chairman Paavo Lipponen in Uusikaupunki and Pietasaari on 
Saturday [12 March]. 
  He was evasive as to whether the SDP should participate in 
drafting new legislation and the appropriation bills that might 
be needed. [passage omitted] 
  Lipponen repeated his proposal that the computations for 
farm 
subsidies should be determined in the same way as in the 
national wage talks, namely, by a group representing all 
interests, including the taxpayers and consumers. 
  According to Lipponen, the EU agreement's agricultural 
policies correspond in central points to goals of the SDP. The 
SDP saw that an immediate conversion to EU producer prices would 
be more advantageous than a gradual price reduction (ACA 
[expansion unknown]) that the government was seeking. 
  Lipponen asserted that the Center Party and Farmers 
Association (MTK) wanted to have a gradual reduction so that it 
would be possible to conceal the enormous price subsidies to the 
farmers and to that part of the food-processing industry owned 
by the farmers. "Now all this will be more transparent, and 
therefore the calculations regarding budget costs have shocked 
so many," he said.

<F P=106> [Finnish News Agency report: "Freedom From Alliances in the </F>
Shade"] 
  [Text] Claes Andersson, Left Alliance [VL] Chairman, is 
attacking Finland's foreign policy leadership for not having 
acted with sufficient determination in the EU [European Union] 
negotiations to keep the country out of military alliances. In 
Helsinki on Saturday [12 March], Andersson asserted that the 
country's striving for freedom from alliances had been mentioned 
when Finland first applied for EU membership. 
  "An attempt has been made to conceal the freedom from 
alliances [doctrine] in order not to jeopardize the membership 
talks," he said. 
  According to Andersson, the strengthening of Russian troops 
on Finland's eastern border is partly because Russia is 
preparing against a change in Finnish security policy in the 
event Finland becomes an EU member and that organization 
develops its own defense policy cooperation.

<F P=106> [Report on interview with incoming Conservative Party leader </F>
Jan Petersen by Heidi Borud; place and date not given] 
  [Text] Jan Petersen is giving advance warning of a strong 
EU [European Union] offensive. "There will be no Norwegian EU 
membership if the Conservative Party does not do its part of the 
job." 
  The day of the Conservative Party's national conference is 
approaching and the party's incoming leader made it clear that 
the EU question will be center-stage when Conservatives gather 
in Bergen on 8-10 April. 
  He also made it crystal clear that the Conservative Party 
shares the Labor Party's view on the timing of the referendum: 
  "It should be held after Sweden and Finland have reached 
their decisions. In a situation in which many people think that 
it is a key consideration that we should have an answer to the 
question of what our neighbors are doing, it is obvious that we 
cannot deprive them of this information." 
  Jan Petersen was the Young Conservative leader in the 
campaign year of 1972 [year of Norway's pervious referendum on 
EU/EC membership]. He is now looking forward to leading the 
Conservative Party into a new referendum: 
  "We lost last time. This time we are going to nail this 
thing," Petersen said. 
  Like Labor Party leader Thorbjorn Jagland, he hopes that the 
debate will pass off a little more calmly this time: "We should 
argue rather than agitate." 
  Petersen will have an easier job than Jagland when it comes 
to maintaining control over his own party members. Even though 
there are EU doubters in the Conservative Party too, they do not 
constitute a dominant group among the 17 percent of voters who 
currently profess Conservative sympathies. 
  Petersen himself said: "Given the good results from the 
negotiations I am counting on unambiguous support for them at 
the Conservative Party national conference. Conservative 
themselves are impatient to get started." 
  The country's incoming Conservative Party leader is generous 
in his praise of the government: "It has done a good job. We 
Conservatives have always stressed that Norway should speak to 
the rest of the world with one voice. Both the government's 
negotiators and the EU's people have done a good job. The EU's 
negotiators have shown themselves to be sensitive to our special 
requirements. This makes me optimistic," Petersen. 
  He believes that the credibility of the "no" side will now 
be 
put to the test:"This applies both in respect to the results of 
the negotiations, and the EEA [European Economic Area] 
agreement. According to the `no' side, there was no limit to 
the catastrophes the four freedoms [of movement for goods, 
services, labor, and capital] would bring down on us. We have 
now been part of the EEA for three months and so far no 
catastrophe has occurred. 
  ``What the `no' side has tried to do is to portray the EU 
countries as something totally alien and unknown. In this 
respect the EEA agreement was a useful lesson for us. We went 
through 12,000 pages of EU laws and it turned out that the EU 
countries' social systems are very like our own.'' 
  In the Storting the lawyer from Oppegard has chiefly 
concerned himself with foreign policy. He is deputy chairman of 
the Storting Foreign Affairs Committee and he is leader of the 
delegation of Norwegian parliamentarians to NATO. 
  However, as the incoming Conservative leader he knows that 
he 
now has to be an well-rounded. He has to be a match for Prime 
Minister Gro Harlem Brundtland. 
  Are you able to understand why in the last election many 
Conservatives voted for the Labor Party because there was no 
other government alternative? 
  "I can only note the fact that a few did so. But it is the 
voters who must give us the political weight which can give us 
government responsibility again." 
  So in the run-up to the 1997 Storting election the 
Conservative Party together with other nonsocialist parties will 
come forward as an alternative to the Labor Party? 
  "Our aim is to seek political power. But the Center Party's 
shift to the left is the problem. Naturally the Conservative 
Party wants to be a real alternative to the Labor Party."

<F P=106> [Report by Geir Salvesen: "EU Clarification on Agriculture"] </F>
  [Text] "All doubts have now been removed," Agriculture 
Minister Oyangen said after the EU's [European Union] 
clarification regarding northern agriculture. 
  The dispute after the remarks from the EU commissioner 
responsible for agriculture, Rene Steichen, is now over -- at 
least as far as the Norwegian authorities are concerned. At the 
end of last week Steichen told several Norwegian newspapers that 
the criteria applying to northern agriculture would only remain 
in force for a transitional period. He also claimed that 
support for farmers south of the 62d parallel would only apply 
to farms at least 800 meters above sea level. 
  In its presentation of the results of the negotiations the 
Agriculture Ministry, headed by Gunhild Oyangen, has given the 
impression that national support for "northern agriculture" can 
be provided for large areas south of the 62d parallel as long as 
these are affected by special growing conditions. 
  Norway asked for a clarification of the EU's position after 
Steichen's remarks. Yesterday evening his press spokesman 
issued a short statement on the view taken of the results of the 
negotiations. 
  The notes states, for example, that "Nordic agriculture" 
will 
apply to regions north of the 62d parallel. In addition "it 
will be possible to include similar regions with mountainous or 
hilly terrain south of this line of latitude, with a low 
population density, a low agricultural profile, and where 
proportion of land devoted to food growing is small" (unofficial 
translation). The note also states that there is no time limit 
on agricultural support for these regions. It states that 
national support can be given to these regions where the EU 
Commission has given the go-ahead. 
  Agriculture Minister Gunhild Oyangen is now interpreting 
this 
as a satisfactory clarification after the row surrounding 
Steichen: "It clarifies what we have said are the results from 
the negotiations, in a situation in which many people have 
questioned more or less every aspect of this agreement. In this 
respect it was a much needed clarification," she said. 
  But is there not still a difference in interpretation about 
how far south of the 62d parallel the "northern regions" can 
stretch? 
  "No, we do not think so. Nothing that we have heard 
indicates that the EU side is working on the basis of facts 
different from those we have." 
  But if everything is settled, why is it necessary to 
continue 
looking at this in further negotiations after Easter? 
  "We will make available more detailed information about 
these 
regions, and that is what we will be putting forward. We have 
taken 20-30 years to develop a system of differentiated support 
in Norway and in the light of this I am hoping for patience for 
a few weeks more." 
  One sigh did, however, escape the agriculture minister: "At 
some point or other we must start to look at areas for new 
developments in agriculture, and not just at what subsidies 
people can receive."

<F P=106> [Article by Olav Trygge Storvik: "Defense Cuts May Lead to </F>
New Base Policy"] 
  [Text] Norwegian base policies and other self-imposed 
restrictions will have to be reevaluated. 
  This is the opinion of Hans J. Rosjorde (Progress Party), 
chairman of the Storting Defense Committee. He is strongly 
supported by Ingvald Godal and Are Naess, the defense policy 
spokesmen for the Conservative Party and the Christian People's 
Party, respectively. 
  "We are reaching a point where we have to be willing to 
reevaluate our whole defense strategy. At such a time it will 
also be necessary to reevaluate both the base policy and the 
self-imposed restrictions," Rosjorde said. 
  A considerable gap between defense appropriations and the 
recommendations of the Defense Committee is making a 
reevaluation necessary, according to Rosjorde. The shortage in 
appropriations has made it even less likely that the goals of 
the Defense Committee can be realized. As a result the Armed 
Forces' combat structure must be reexamined. 
<H5>  2 Billion Short </H5>
  According to the government, the gap is a good 1 billion 
kroner, but Conservative Ingvald Godal thinks it is more than 2 
billion. The difference is explainable in terms of which year 
is taken as the base for the calculation, and in terms of 
whether it is the government's proposed or passed budget that is 
considered. 
  "We cannot continue this way. If the appropriations are not 
increased, we will have to reevaluate our whole defense 
strategy," Rosjorde said. He pointed out that the missing 
appropriations are making it very difficult for the Defense 
Forces to maintain a defense against invasion in North Norway. 
"If, for instance, the Army is not able to maintain division 
structure in the north, there will be doubts in the future as to 
the professional qualifications of Norwegian officers to lead 
large Army units," Rosjorde said. 
  Until now Norway has required that all allied reinforcement 
forces be put under Norwegian command while in Norway, but it is 
not certain that the requirement can be maintained in the 
future. Rosjorde thinks that allies who send reinforcements to 
Norway will not be willing to put their troops under Norwegian 
command because of the Norwegians' lack of professional 
competence. 
  "If we do not want to make the appropriations needed to 
maintain the kind of defense that the Defense Committee decided 
on, we will have to take the consequences and assess all the 
restrictions we have imposed upon ourselves in our security 
policy. This will apply both to bases for foreign troops in 
peacetime as well as restrictions on exercises and the 
curtailment of flights east of a certain longitude," Rosjorde 
said. The only thing he would exclude from such a reevaluation 
is the ban on deployment of nuclear weapons in Norway. 
<H5>  Next Budget Decisive </H5>
  "I have been thinking the same as Rosjorde," Are Naess 
(Christian People's Party) said. He does not want to take 
responsibility for whatever political signals there are in 
Rosjorde's statements, but agrees on what the consequences would 
be if the defense budgets are not made to meet the stated goals. 
"The next budget will be decisive," Naess said. "If they 
continue the trend of accumulated deficits they will either have 
to demonstrate a rationalization effect that has not been 
demonstrated earlier, or else we will have to look at out entire 
defense concept." 
  Ingvald Godal (Conservative) said that the Conservative 
Party 
will have a major defense policy conference in early April to 
discuss all aspects of the problems related to the shrinking 
defense budgets. "I think it likely that the opinions expressed 
by Rosjorde will be echoed. The Conservative Party wants to 
carry out the Defense Committee's recommendation. We take a 
serious view of the situation we now find ourselves in because 
of the Defense Forces not being in step with the world we live 
in," Godal said.

<F P=106> [Commentary by Nils Morten Udgaard: "Jan Henry's Battle With </F>
History"] 
  [Excerpts] [passage omitted] It is not unwieldy fishermen 
from the far north but, rather, a solid Norwegian citizenry in 
the south whose thinking for decades has been out of step with 
the concept of European integration. That is why the road to 
Brussels today is so long and so arduous. 
  Ever since 1905 Norway has been close to Great Britain in 
foreign policy philosophy. Two world wars and a joint battle 
against a Nazi Europe in 1940-45 joined the Britons and the 
Norwegians. As a result it was a major break with custom when 
the Britons in 1972 went into the EC (albeit backwards) while 
Norwegian voters chose to remain on the outside. [passage 
omitted] 
  What is interesting about Norway is that once the Danes and 
the Britons bid farewell and disappeared into the EC, we needed 
other countries to be travel guides towards the EC/EU [European 
Union]. The Swedes declared their intent to apply (in passing) 
in October 1990 when they unveiled a drastic economic crisis 
program that spelled the end of the "Swedish model." It was no 
longer possible to continue to extend and extend the welfare 
state, East Europe did not want to choose the Swedish "third 
way" between capitalism and communism, and Sweden wound up 
placing its bets on Europe both politically and industrially. 
With increased unemployment, a debt crisis, and devaluation the 
country was highly motivated economically. 
  The Finns were close behind. Less than 100 days after the 
dissolution of the Soviet Union, a Finnish application for EC 
membership was on the table in Brussels. That was March 1992. 
Finland entered by the "window of opportunity" to become a 
member of the greater European family. The Finns had, and have, 
their very strong reasons. 
  Oil-rich Norway has not been under any strong economic 
pressure to become a member, as the Swedes and the Danes have 
been, nor do they have the same security threat overshadowing 
them as the Finns have. As a result such values as the meaning 
of life, Norway, and the world gain in importance. And this is 
where we notice that Norway has lacked that sense of European 
citizenship that has been a driving force among the countries of 
the continent. 
  It is a broad citizenship that sees itself as part of a 
larger Europe through family tradition and the pursuit of 
profession, extending beyond the national and the regional. 
This sense of citizenship we know in Norway primarily from the 
centuries-old tradition of Danish senior civil servants [in 
Norway]. This indoctrination of European thought patterns was 
very important for Norway, but the ranks of senior civil 
servants were never large and for a long time these persons were 
not regarded as 100-percent Norwegians. It is only in the very 
last years that historians are looking at the 400-year "night" 
with the Danes with new eyes. Now they are saying that it "was 
a good night." 
  Norway's deep-rooted Euroskepticism was seen perhaps the 
most 
clearly when in 1929 French Foreign Minister Aristide Briand 
unveiled a plan for a European union. In the League of Nations, 
Norway took a strong stance against such "group arrangements," 
preferring to escape into nonbinding support for a "universal 
coalition of all the world's nations." [passage omitted] 
  The skepticism is seen all through and beyond the war years 
when thoughts of European integration once again arose in 
conjunction with initial doubts about the Marshall Plan. It 
even made British Finance Minister Hugh Dalton ask in 1947 
whether Norway really belongs in West Europe. "The Norwegian 
people are...skeptical to integration plans...with the 
Mediterranean countries," Foreign Minister Halvard Lange said 
two years later, after Norway had joined NATO. 
  [Fisheries Minister] Jan Henry T. Olsen today has to do 
battle not only with the Mediterranean countries with regard to 
"not one fish," but also with the modern tradition of Norwegians 
mentally distancing themselves from the rest of Europe.

  [Excerpts] There is now an overwhelming majority in the 
parliament in favor of Sweden beginning cooperation with the 
NATO military alliance--the so-called Partnership for Peace. 
This became possible after the Social Democrats accepted a 
motion on the government's proposal on NATO cooperation. 
[passage omitted] 
  In NATO's Partnership program, each country decides how 
extensive the military cooperation will be, and every country 
pays for the cooperation in which it takes part. According to 
Pierre Schori, the foreign policy spokesman of the Social 
Democrats, we can never have Swedish soldiers fighting in a NATO 
[word indistinct]. 
  [Begin recording] [Schori] No, we will not choose that. That 
is directed toward the East and Central Europeans, who want to 
join NATO, but cannot. They are offered something that looks 
like cooperation with NATO, but it is not. 
  [Correspondent Herman Melzer] But is this not cooperation 
that we are prepared to begin, cooperation with NATO on several 
different points? 
  [Schori] Well, the initiative came from NATO.... 
  [Melzer, interrupting] Is it not false then that we say that 
we are free of alliances, when we are now going to cooperate 
with NATO? 
  [Schori] Well, you are stuck on NATO. This is a proposal 
that comes from NATO, but this is not direct NATO activity. 
This is a manifestation that the world changes, and NATO 
actually also changes. NATO must find something else; 
otherwise, it has no justification for its existence. 
  [Melzer] Still, there is no other military alliances with 
which we cooperate. 
  [Schori] No, there is actually no other military alliance 
any 
more, so we will have to begin with what we have. The aim is 
joint security and, from our point of view, the basic choice in 
our activities is freedom from military alliances. [end

<F P=106> [Report by Thomas Michelsen: "Surplus Threatens To Grow"] </F>
  [Excerpt ] The grain surplus could increase by 50 percent 
when Sweden becomes a member of the EU [European Union]. The 
surplus is expected to grow from today's 1 million tonnes a year 
to 1.5 million tonnes. 
  When we join the EU, farmers will again be able to cultivate 
areas of land that are currently undergoing so-called 
conversion. These are fields for which farmers have received 
compensation from the state to remove from production. But once 
inside the EU these fields could again be used for grain 
production under EU rules. The surplus could be sold to other 
countries using the EU's export subsides. 
  However, the EU will also demand that a certain percentage 
of 
farm land be allowed to lie fallow. Nevertheless the net 
increase in land used for growing grain could be 130,000 
hectares, with the increased harvest around 500,000 tonnes. 
  This emerged at a farmers' day hosted by Agriculture 
Minister 
Karl Erik Olsson in Katrineholm yesterday. 
  Olsson's message to the farmers present was twofold: On the 
one hand the Swedish conversion system was useful and would 
continue to be needed in the future. It was a good thing that 
fields have been taken out of food production. On the other 
hand farmers should be actively involved and compete within the 
EU -- that is, increase their production once again. The 
agriculture minister also expressed the hope that the increased 
grain harvest can be used to feed even more hogs and chickens. 
Here too production could be increased. 
  The agriculture minister is very satisfied with the results 
of the negotiations in Brussels. However, the Skane farmers 
complained that they did not get the increased sugar quota they 
had wanted. 
  "But once they have received payment for their beets they 
will be happy," Olsson said, as the price of sugar will rise 
dramatically when we join the EU. 
  "I am sufficiently satisfied with the negotiations to 
recommend membership in the EU," the agriculture minister said. 
"And there are 10 million farmers in the EU. There is 
therefore no need to fear any shortsighted or abrupt changes in 
the EU's agricultural policy." 
  Olsson praised the results of the negotiations and said that 
they are economically advantageous for Swedish agriculture: We 
have not sought membership in the EU to become poor, but to do 
well economically. 
  He also defended the favorable economic package against the 
Social Democratic criticism of the past few days. 
  "It is unfair, as Goran Persson has proposed, to target 
punitive measures on Swedish agriculture. The results of the 
negotiations are not that good. It is only fair that Swedish 
farmers should be allowed to produce on the same terms as the 
EU's farmers," Olsson said. [passage omitted]

<F P=106> [Sune Olofson report: "Missile Deal Causes Conflict"] </F>
  [Text] French Prime Minister Edouard Balladur has written 
a frank letter to Prime Minister Carl Bildt on the sensitive 
issue of the purchase of missiles for the Jas-39 Gripen 
aircraft. After the failure of two major deals France is 
expecting to win the missile order. 
  Balladur's lengthy letter is dated 2 March, and Carl Bildt 
replied on 10-11 March. According to information from French 
sources, Carl Bildt's more than three page reply in French was 
perceived as "cool" and "gave rise to gloom" in Paris. Both 
letters have been classified as secret in the Cabinet Office's 
computer system. 
  The last day for tenders in the missile deal was 15 March. 
The value of the deals totals 3 to 5 billion kronor. Three 
companies are fighting for the order: France's Matra with the 
Mica missile, British Aerospace with Active Skyflash, and the 
United States' Hughes/Raytheon with the Amraam missile. The 
Defense Materiel Administration, FMV, has begun evaluation of 
the bids. 
  France is mourning the failed Volvo-Renault fusion and the 
loss of the tank deal, which was worth 7 to 10 billion kronor. 
Now the French want revenge and have clearly placed the missile 
deal at the highest political level. 
  According to SVENSKA DAGBLADET's sources in France and 
Sweden, Balladur's letter to Bildt can be taken as sarcastic in 
places, but at the same time it is diplomatic and cleverly 
written. However, there is a clear underlying message that now 
it is France's turn. 
  Balladur gives Bildt an account of the missile's advantages 
and of the industrial gains that can be achieved through 
Swedish-French missile cooperation -- this chiefly affects Saab 
Missiles in Linkoping and Ericsson Radar Electronics in Molndal. 
Ericsson already has a contract with Matra regarding the radio 
link between the aircraft and the missile and is negotiating 
with the French to also manufacture the target seeker. If these 
negotiations succeed and Saab Missiles becomes involved in the 
comprehensive work of integration and in the fitting of the 
robot and its electronics systems on the aircraft, this will 
lead to more secure employment in the hard-pressed Swedish 
missile industry. 
  In his reply to Balladur Carl Bildt points out that an 
official purchase procedure is taking place involving the 
customary bidding practices and that the Swedish Government will 
reach a decision on the basis of the Air Force's needs and the 
merits of the various missiles. In the formal letter Carl Bildt 
leaves no room for a generous interpretation of France's 
advantage. 
  Competition for the missile deal is tough. Some time ago the 
U.S. Pentagon announced that the FMV had asked to buy 500 Amraam 
missiles valued at 3.7 billion kronor. The FMV subsequently 
announced that no decision has been reached and that scrutiny of 
the bids will continue. 
  In January the head of the FMV's air force materiel 
department, Major General Sven-Olof Hokborg, became defense 
attache in Washington. He is said to be fighting hard for the 
United States to win the order and a few weeks ago a group of 
missile experts from Hughes/Raytheon paid a study visit to 
Sweden. 
  An important question is whether the United States really is 
prepared to allow the further export of Jas-39 Gripens equipped 
with Amraam missiles. The U.S. Congress keeps careful check on 
further exports and has in the past been particularly 
restrictive. The United States has not even permitted the 
testing of Amraam on foreign soil, both Britain and Germany have 
been refused permission. 
  It is still unclear how many missiles Sweden is planning to 
buy. But according to SVENSKA DAGBLADET's information, it is 
likely to be quite a lot less than 800. 
  Neither Amraam, Mica, nor Active Skyflash is likely to be 
able to resist the missile threat which is growing rapidly in 
the world. Modern wars are to a large extent about air 
supremacy and missiles as weapons to be used against important 
central military installations and attack systems. It is 
possible that the government will decide to buy a smaller number 
of missiles now and then invest in the next generation. 
  Intensive discussions are taking place between Matra and 
British Aerospace about a possible merger. Saab Missiles and 
Ericsson are waiting in the wings. The four companies could 
come to play an important role in the next generation of radar 
attack missiles. 
  The choice facing the government is to continue along a 
traditional transatlantic path with regard to the purchase of 
military materiel from the United States, a technological 
superpower, or choose a European path with the possiblity of 
cooperation and mergers with Europe's defense industries. 
  FMV is expected to nominate the winners of the missile deal 
in the course of the spring and the government will probably 
reach its decision before the summer recess.

    [Editorial report] In a report in the 7 March Stockholm 
business weekly VECKANS AFFARER on pages 17 and 18, Ewa Hedlund 
looks at with which EU [European Union] countries Sweden will 
likely find common cause and how well it will do implementing 
the rules of the single market. Sweden will have the most in 
common with Germany, Denmark, and Britain. It is expected to 
cooperate with Germany, Denmark, and the Netherlands on 
environmental issues, and with Germany and Denmark on labor 
market policy. On social policy, its likely partners will be 
Denmark and Belgium. In addition, it is expected to find common 
cause with Germany on industrial policy and budgetary matters, 
and with Britain on free trade, competition policy, and state 
subsidies. It will probably only be able to form alliances with 
the southern European countries on single issues: for instance, 
with Spain on regional policy and Greece on veterinary matters. 
Sweden will be closest to the French position on foreign and 
security policy issues. Portugal will be an ally on matters 
concerning the influence of smaller countries, as will Belgium. 
  In an interview with Hedlund, Christer Asp, the deputy 
permanent representative in Brussels, promised that Sweden would 
be diligent in instituting the rules of the single market. "We 
will very much uphold the common rules and laws. The strength 
of cooperation is achieved by having set rules." He predicts 
that Sweden will soon surpass Britain, currently on top, in the 
number of regulations implemented. Asp also notes that Sweden's 
foremost aim as a member of the EU will be to defend the 
interests of small countries and "not get squeezed between the 
large trading countries."

<F P=106> [Interview with Anders Sundstrom, Social Democratic Party </F>
member, by Margaret von Platen in Pitea; date not given: 
"Clinton Provides Inspiration for Social Democrats"] 
  [Text] Pitea -- If the Social Democrats win the 
parliamentary elections in the fall, then the new government's 
economic policy will be inspired by the United States and 
President Clinton's government. Many Social Democrats have 
recently visited the United States, including Willy Bergstrom, 
Mona Sahlin, Allan Larsson, Par Nuder.[.sup]1[/] Anders 
Sundstrom will also try to squeeze in a trip to the United 
States before September. He is a local councillor in Pitea and 
the party's spokesman on economic policy. In a new Social 
Democratic government he will probably be the economic affairs 
minister. Anders Sundstrom wants greater centralization and 
planning in the style of Bill Clinton -- but with a few homespun 
ideas from Pitea. His plan for economic policy includes 
sectoral planning, control over research, a technical and 
scientific council, and an investment bank. 
  [Sundstrom] I do not think it was very clever to close down 
the National Investment Bank. Ericsson's CEO Lars Ramqvist has 
reported that the success of the mobile telephone market was due 
to cofinancing with the Investment Bank. I am not promising to 
introduce a new investment bank -- we would need money to do 
that. However, I thought it operated well. I have looked at how 
it used to work and I am impressed. 
  [von Platen] How important is it for a Social Democratic 
government to gain the confidence of the markets and major 
companies so that investments are made in Sweden? 
  [Sundstrom] I believe it will be hard for us to get the 
bosses of major companies to say that a Social Democratic 
government is better than a government supported by the Swedish 
Employers' Confederation. However, I do not believe that anyone 
will leave Sweden merely because of our rise to power. 
Companies have not had a great time of it under the right-wing 
government. 
  [von Platen] Are there limits to what a Social Democratic 
government can do? 
  [Sundstrom] The main constraint for the state is its 
economic 
room for maneuver. We cannot present any proposals that would 
increase the budget deficit. 
  [von Platen] Why do you consider Swedish membership of the 
EU 
[European Union] to be so important? 
  [Sundstrom] Sweden will never be attractive to investors if 
it remains outside of Europe. 
  [von Platen] What kind of emergency plan have the Social 
Democrats made if the people say no to EU membership in the 
referendum? 
  [Sundstrom] The Social Democrats have no ready-made plan of 
what to do if we do not become members. 
  [von Platen] What have you learned from the financial 
crisis? 
  [Sundstrom] That inflationary economies lead investors 
astray. [Sundstrom ends] 
  His economic policy looks something like this. Its 
objectives are: to make it easier for small companies to get 
their hands on capital; to investigate the banks' high profit 
margins; to establish aid for small companies in the private 
sector that are facing competition; to allow the state and 
companies to finance several projects jointly. 
  [Sundstrom continues] As economics minister I shall ensure 
that small companies can make the most of their competitiveness 
on the capital market. Small companies in Pitea know that they 
are obliged to use their bank in Pitea. That is not how things 
should be. I believe that there is weak competition on the 
banking market. Specialized banks will be set up. Information 
on them will be available in data bases. It is wrong that small 
companies should have to pay interest rates between 4 and 5 
percent higher than large companies -- despite the fact that 
small companies are highly solvent. Nowadays, subsidies for 
enterprise are rather too general. For example, if a 
hairdresser gets a subsidy to open up his own salon and then 
drives someone else out of business, then we have not achieved 
very much. Small companies faced with competition at 
international level must be given help to grow. 
  A great deal of support is being given to companies, but it 
is being managed by the wrong people and flowing through the 
wrong channels. Several hundred million kronor are being lost 
on the way. For instance, the aid awarded to inventors at 
national level is less than that awarded by Vasterbotten alone. 
Cofinanced projects are totally lacking in Sweden. The state 
must support new companies, helping them to develop new 
production capacities. However, the state must not take a share 
unless it does so via guarantees and loans, just as in the 
United States. 
  I will increase export subsidies for small companies. Today, 
export credit guarantees work well for large companies, but not 
so well for the smaller ones. 
  The Social Democratic Party will become more active and 
develop sectoral programs for areas in which Sweden has unique 
growth opportunities, both in terms of resources and the climate 
of innovation. For instance, some German states have sectoral 
programs to supply venture capital. We have already indicated 
that in view of its significance for the balance on our current 
account, forests and the lumber industry comprise a priority 
branch. 
  As economic minister, I will strengthen Nutek, the 
industrial 
authority. There must be a central authority for research and 
development. Today, there are too many state authorities 
without any semblance of unity. For instance, it is wrong to 
take the workers' funds in several independent foundations for 
research purposes. The shares in Atle and Bure should be in one 
hand. Aid awarded under the terms of economic policy aid is 
split. There is no strong single authority. 
  I will facilitate access to venture capital for innovations 
before they are marketed, and I shall allocate more funds to 
industrial research. Other countries have resources to develop 
their inventions. Take Japan. We are net exporters of 
inventions. 
  Sweden ranks last, together with Turkey and Greece, as far 
as 
support for industrial research is concerned. The present 
government has vacillated, cutting grants for technical 
attaches. However, we need scouts throughout the world looking 
out for new inventions. 
  I intend to make universities into centers where ideas can 
be 
commercialized. Someone, for example the prime minister himself 
or someone close to him, will be responsible for resources 
earmarked for training. Today, these funds are distributed by 
various departments. Growth-related issues will be grouped 
together. 
  I have my eye on the United States. President Clinton 
presides over a technical and scientific council that has the 
same status as the National Security Council or defense council. 
  At present, training is only being done by major companies. 
I want to stimulate small companies into offering training, 
too. This will be based on the same principle as the 
occupational funds. 
  [von Platen] Which country has the best policy for 
supporting 
small companies? 
  [Sundstrom] Germany and northern Italy have developed very 
well. What fascinates me there is the entrepreneurial spirit. 
Over there it is a good thing to be an entrepreneur. Here in 
the town, the inhabitants of Pitea are proud of entrepreneurs. 
It is important that we, as leaders, call attention to them and 
say that they are important for our nation and municipality. 
[Sandtrom ends] 
  Pitea District Councillor Anders Sundstrom is one of the 
Social Democrats' future stars and one of the candidates most 
certain to receive a post in the new government. However, he 
will not enter parliament in the fall, even if the party wins 
the election. He is not on any list in the parliamentary 
election. He himself explains this by saying that he prefers to 
stay home with his sons, who are 10 and 13 years old. However, 
it is also well known that he is not very popular among all 
Social Democrats in the north. He is not a candidate on the 
Norrbotten parliamentary list because Boden threatened to set up 
its own parliamentary list -- without Anders Sundstrom, because 
the people living there do not like him. In a compromise 
between Boden and Lulea, he decided that the new hospital should 
be located between the two towns. It turned out to cost 100 
million kronor more than it would have cost to rebuild the old 
hospital in Boden. In the course of that conflict he lost some 
popularity. 
  Anders Sundstrom comes from the small town of Sikras in the 
district of Kalix. His father's father was a fisherman, farmer, 
and longshoreman. He founded the transport department and the 
first Social Democratic association in the district. 
Sundstrom's father was an electrician who worked for the 
customs authority and then became a teacher at the vocational 
school in Pitea. 
  Judgements of Anders Sundstrom vary. He is Ingvar Carlsson's 
favorite, but weak and sensitive; he is clever, and has created 
a whole new economic climate in Pitea; he is no visionary, he is 
fairer than the other Social Democrats, and can take critcism; 
he has done his homework and asks smart questions in the 
committees on which he sits. 
  However, when I asked the taxi drivers what Anders Sundstrom 
is doing for them as self-employed people -- Sundstrom has been 
voted the most popular district councillor in the business world 
-- I received only negative answers. The taxi drivers are 
furious with him: In a public call for tenders to run 
transportation services for old-age pensioners the "wrong" 
company won out. One of the owners of the winning taxi company 
sits alongside Sundstrom in the social committee's working group. 
  Anders Sundstrom became a district councillor in Pitea at 
age 
27 -- Sweden's youngest ever. Now he is 42 years old and still 
in the same post. He is a member of some 10 boards of 
directors, including in Alvsbyhus (Sweden's most progressive 
housing company), in the NAB (technical consultants), and 
PITEATIDNINGEN (the town's only -- and Social Democratic -- 
newspaper). Until the change in government, he was also a board 
member of Doman, LKAB, and Vattenfall. In addition, he is a 
member of the party's executive committee, and the Social 
Democratic leader in the Norrbotten district.

  [Text] In a statement after meeting Prime Minister Andreas 
Papandreou, Romanian President Ion Iliescu supported the Greek 
positions on The Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia [FYROM]. 
Iliescu noted that the Greek position on FYROM appears to be 
correct, adding that his country is not against the existence of 
FYROM. He said he hopes Greek-FYROM differences will be 
overcome through a dialogue. Iliescu added that no Balkan 
country--including Turkey of course--should participate in the 
UN peacekeeping force in the former Yugoslavia. 
  The Greek prime minister and the Romanian president 
described 
bilateral relations as warm and constructive and stressed the 
two countries' willingness to strengthen relations in the 
political, economic, and social spheres. 
  Papandreou referred to the ancient ties of friendship that 
link the two countries and added that Greece will do everything 
it can to help Romania in approaches to the European Union. 
  Iliescu and Papandreou also discussed developments in Europe 
and the problems in the Balkans. Earlier today Iliescu met 
President Konstandinos Karamanlis and discussed the latest 
developments in the former Yugoslavia.

<F P=106> [Report by Filis Kaitatzis] </F>
  [Text] The 90 tons of toxic chemical waste in the cargo of 
the ship Europetrader is a threat to the Greek sea and the 
Mediterranean. 
  According to the Turkish chapter of Mediterranean SOS 
[expansion unknown], on Saturday 26 March, 90 tons of toxic 
chemical waste were loaded from the U.S. Incirlik Air Base in 
Turkey. The chemicals were loaded in five large containers and 
a smaller one and were taken to the port of Mersin escorted by 
three vehicles, two American and one of the Turkish police. 
  The travelling documents say "toxic chemical waste destined 
for Britain for processing and destruction." 
  According to the Turkish chapter of Mediterranean SOS (SOS 
Akedeniz), at the Mersin port the containers were loaded aboard 
the Europetrader, flying the Bahamas flag, which sailed at 2000 
on Saturday for Izmir. The ship was expected to reach Izmir 
last night. 
  SOS Akedeniz asked to inspect the cargo before the ship 
sailed from Mersin. However, the authorities refused on the 
grounds that "Turkey did not have the necessary uniforms and 
equipment to open and check the containers," which do not have 
any information about the material inside them. 
  The Greek chapter of Mediterranean SOS contacted the Turkish 
chapter and was informed that "the cargo could be radioactive 
waste that will not reach Britain but will possibly be dumped 
somewhere in the Mediterranean." 
  This view is enforced by the path of Europetrader, which 
instead of sailing for Britain left for Izmir. The above was 
told to ELEVTHEROTIPIA by the Greek chapter of Mediterranean 
SOS, which asked the Ministry of Merchant Marine to continuously 
follow the ship's path to prevent it from dumping the dangerous 
waste in the sea. 
  The Greek chapter of Mediterranean SOS also asked the 
Ministry of Merchant Marine to be in continuous contact with 
authorities of other Mediterranean countries, as is required by 
the international accords on the transportation of dangerous 
waste. 
  Nikolaos Khrisoyelos, member of the Greek chapter of 
Mediterranean SOS, said that now that Greece is presiding over 
the European Union it should act decisively to prevent the 
transfer of dangerous waste, "especially under conditions that 
do not provide for inspection and clarity in the transportation 
of these dangerous wastes."

<F P=106> [From the "Comments" column: "Robert Lamb's Statement"] </F>
  [Text] We do not know whether we should feel satisfied with 
Robert Lamb's [U.S. State Department special coordinator on 
Cyprus] visit and statements. But the basic conclusion is that 
the Americans and others refuse to realize that the talks have 
reached a real impasse. They refuse to blame the side 
responsible for the impasse, that is, the Turkish side. 
  Lamb's positions create the impression that the talks are 
advancing, that there has been agreement on many points, and 
that agreement is possible soon. If his positions do not 
indicate ignorance of today's reality, and they do not indicate 
such ignorance, then they represent an effort to dispel the 
impressions created not only by our positions, but also by the 
statements of the UN representatives. 
  We voice our concern that we will return to the ups and 
downs 
of meaningless talks and that again the Turkish side will not 
bear the responsibilities of another impasse. This will make 
Rauf Denktas even bolder; he will filibuster every effort for 
progress in the Cyprus issue. 
  We are faced with an impasse and the inability of the 
international community to blame the side that led to this 
situation. We understand that the government is awaiting the UN 
secretary general's report before taking any further steps. We 
just want to repeat that if we want to prevent particular 
situations and create developments instead of following them, we 
should act immediately. We should show our disappointment and 
disgust that Denktas--with the support of Ankara--fools 
everyone. We should also stress that we will not put up with 
this insulting mockery.

<F P=106> [Editorial: "The Game of Words"--all punctuation as </F>
published] 
  [Excerpts] We do not underestimate the last-minute effort 
by Robert Lamb, U.S. State Department special representative on 
Cyprus, to salvage the talks on the confidence-building 
measures. However, we cannot understand the game of words with 
which he covers and expresses the Turkish intransigence. 
  Yesterday we heard Mr. Lamb describe his meeting with 
[Turkish Cypriot Leader] Rauf Denktas as "productive." And 
this, because the Turkish Cypriot leader "appeared to understand 
some things better!!".... 
  We also heard yesterday Ankara's statement that the European 
Union cannot help with a solution to the Cyprus problem. This 
is because, supposedly, the European Union considers the Turkish 
Cypriot side non-existent!!.... 
  In both cases, the words do not express reality. On the 
contrary, they twist, violate, and tamper with the rules of 
dialogue on internationally acceptable principles. 
  Specifically: 
  1. We cannot accept Lamb's meeting with Denktas as 
"productive," since it did not produce the outcome advised by 
the UN Security Council permanent members within a specified 
timeframe for "achievement of an agreement without delay." 
Today is the expiration date of this effort and there are no 
indications of a change in Denktas' position, which leads to a 
new impasse.... It is therefore natural that we do not expect 
any last-minute surprises because these moves must be considered 
an effort to dispel the negative impressions of the other side 
to avoid international condemnation. Denktas was in a position 
many years ago to realize what today he appears to "understand" 
to gain international tolerance and extension. Denktas' failure 
to abide by the resolutions and advice of the Security Council 
has exceeded all limits. [passage omitted] 
  We are right when we talk about a bad game of words and 
provocative mockery. If the Security Council respects itself 
and its decisions and deadlines, it ought to change its policy. 
Otherwise, the impasse will continue and international tolerance 
will be associated with acceptance [of faits accomplis].

  [Text] The Greek Cypriot Administration has allowed the 
Workers Party of Kurdistan [PKK] and Armenian terrorists, who 
are trying to divide and fragment Turkey and who do not hesitate 
to shed the blood of their brethren in order to achieve their 
objectives, to establish a base in the Trodos Mountains in 
Paphos district. 
  It has been ascertained that the PKK terrorists and the 
ASALA 
[Armenian Secret Army for the Liberation of Armenia] militants 
have been training in guerrilla warfare on the Trodos Mountains 
since 1988. The mountains are under Greek Cypriot sovereignty. 
Meanwhile, it has been reported that the PKK--which is trying to 
get support from Greece and the Greek Cypriot administration, 
who are hostile to Turkey--has established financial links with 
the Armenian terrorist organizations. Reliable sources say that 
the PKK has given material aid worth $1.2 million to the 
Armenian terrorist organizations in accordance with PKK leader 
Abdullah Ocalan's instructions. They also say that the PKK gave 
material aid to the Armenian terrorists because they are 
fighting for similar objectives. 
  It has been reported that the PKK and the Armenian terrorist 
organizations--who get the funds they need from drug trafficking 
and arms smuggling and from foreign underground organizations 
that believe they stand to gain from the attempt to fragment 
Turkey--are trying to establish a new base in Paphos district. 
In fact, the foundations of that base have already been laid. 
  Turkey and the TRNC [Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus] 
have been worried by the Greek Cypriot Administration's close 
relations with the PKK and the Armenian terrorist organizations. 
Meanwhile, several circles in Azerbaijan are also concerned. 
They too are worried over the open support Greece and the Greek 
Cypriot Administration have given to the Armenian terrorist 
organizations, which, together with the Armenian bands that have 
occupied Nagorno-Karabakh in Azerbaijan, dream of creating a 
Greater Armenia. 
  The support Greece and the Greek Cypriot Administration have 
given to the PKK and the Armenian terrorist organizations has 
been assessed as a dangerous move that may further worsen the 
problems between the Azerbaijani and Armenian peoples, the Turks 
and Greeks, and the Turkish Cypriots and Greek Cypriots.

<F P=106> [Report by Anthos Likavyis] </F>
  [Excerpt] The Greek Cypriot side considers the increasing 
Turkish claims regarding the supposed presence and training of 
Kurdish and Armenian fighters in Cyprus as an obvious and 
outright attempt to step up pretenses. 
  An official source described these claims as unfounded and 
dangerous. Political circles note: 
  First: The Turks give details regarding the supposed 
presence of such foreigners in Cyprus to create more convincing 
impressions for third parties. 
  Second: There is an effort to involve other countries, such 
as Armenia and Azerbaijan, and cause wider concern. 
  The goal is to divert attention from impressions of the 
murder of Theofilos Yeoryiadhis [chairman of the Committee for 
Solidarity With Kurdistan] by the Turkish Secret Service and to 
justify its activities in the free areas of Cyprus with the 
usual pretenses. 
  According to Foreign Ministry officials' statements, these 
pretenses are systematically cultivated in the Turkish press and 
are reproduced in the Turkish Cypriot newspapers to convey them 
later, through propaganda bulletins, to other quarters. 
  These claims were brought back to light by [the Turkish 
Cypriot newspaper] YENI DEMOKRAT, which published the 
"information" regarding facilities offered by the Cypriot 
Government to "Kurdish and Armenian terrorists." [passage 
omitted]

  [Text] Nicosia, Mar 29 (CNA)--The Central Bank of Cyprus 
granted Tuesday [29 March] an authority to Russian Joint Stock 
Bank "Kubanbank" to establish an offshore office in Cyprus. 
  "Kubanbank" is the 30th foreign bank and the second from the 
Krasnodar region to establish an offshore presence in Cyprus. 
  According to an official announcement, Krasnodar's economic 
development is of particular interest to Cyprus and the presence 
of "Kubanbank" is expected to strengthen even further the close 
economic relationship between the two parties. 
  The "Kubanbank" offshore office will be conducting liaison 
activities between its head office and non-resident customers, 
and will be gathering financial and commercial information. 
  The same announcement said that "Kubanbank" was founded in 
Russia in 1937 and was part of the USSR State Industrial Bank, 
based in the Krasnodar region. 
  As from 1990, it operates as a commercial bank in the 
Russian 
Federation and it is primarily involved in the financing of the 
industrial and construction sectors. 
  It is one of the largest banks in southern Russia where it 
maintains 23 branches, mainly in the Krasnodar region. It has 
also established representative offices in Germany and Italy.

  [Text] Geneva, March 31 KYODO -- The following is the full 
text of a ministerial declaration draft to be announced in 
mid-April by ministers from GATT member countries at Marrakech, 
Morocco, obtained Thursday [31 March] by Kyodo News Service: 
<H5>  Marrakech Declaration of 15 April 1994 </H5>
  Ministers representing the (124) governments and the 
European 
Communities participating in the Uruguay Round of multilateral 
trade negotiations, on the occasion of the final session of the 
trade negotiations committee at ministerial level held at 
Marrakech, Morocco from 12 to 15 April 1994, 
  Recalling the ministerial declaration adopted at Punta del 
Este, Uruguay on 20 September 1986 to launch the Uruguay Round 
of multilateral trade negotiations, 
  Recalling the progress achieved at the ministerial meetings 
held at Montreal, Canada and Brussels, Belgium in December of 
1988 and 1990 respectively, 
  Noting that the negotiations were substantially concluded on 
15 December 1993, 
  Determined to build upon the success of the Uruguay Round 
through the participation of their economies in the world 
trading system, based upon open, market-oriented policies and 
the commitments set out in the Uruguay Round agreements and 
decisions, 
  Have today adopted the following declaration 
  1. Ministers salute the historic achievement represented by 
the conclusion of the round, which they believe will strengthen 
the world economy and lead to more trade, investment, employment 
and income growth throughout the world. In particular, they 
welcome 
  -- The stronger and clearer legal framework they have 
adopted 
for the conduct of international trade, including a more 
effective and reliable dispute settlement mechanism, 
  -- The global reduction by 40 percent of tariffs and wider 
market-opening agreements on goods, and the increased 
predictability and security represented by a major expansion in 
the scope of tariff commitments, and 
  -- The establishment of a multilateral framework of 
disciplines for trade in services and for the protection of 
trade-related intellectual property rights, as well as the 
reinforced multilateral trade provisions in agriculture and in 
textiles and clothing. 
  2. Ministers affirm that the establishment of the World 
Trade Organization (WTO) ushers in a new era of global economic 
cooperation, reflecting the widespread desire to operate in a 
fairer and more open multilateral trading system for the benefit 
and welfare of their peoples. Ministers believe that the trade 
liberalization and strengthened rules achieved in the Uruguay 
Round will lead to a progressively open world trading 
environment, and express their determination to resist 
protectionist pressures of all kinds. Ministers undertake, with 
immediate effect and until the entry into force of the WTO, not 
to take any trade measures that would undermine or adversely 
affect the results of the Uruguay Round negotiations or their 
implementation. 
  3. Ministers confirm their resolution to strive for greater 
global coherence of policies in the fields of trade, money and 
  Finance, including cooperation between the WTO, the IMF and 
the World Bank for that purpose. 
  4. Ministers welcome the fact that participation in the 
Uruguay Round was considerably wider than in any previous 
multilateral trade negotiation and, in particular, that 
developing countries played a notably active role in it. This 
has marked a historic step toward a more balanced and integrated 
global trade partnership. Ministers note that during the period 
these negotiations were underway significant measures of 
economic reform and autonomous trade liberalization were 
implemented in many developing countries and formerly centrally 
planned economies. 
  5. Ministers recall that the results of the negotiations 
embody provisions conferring differential and more favorable 
treatment for developing economies, including special attention 
to the particular situation of least-developed countries. 
Ministers underscore the importance of these provisions for the 
least-developed countries, and declare their intention to 
continue to assist and facilitate the expansion of their trade 
and investment opportunities. They agree to keep under regular 
review by the ministerial conference and the appropriate organs 
of the WTO the impact of the results of the round on the 
least-developed countries as well as on the net-food- importing 
developing countries, with a view to fostering positive measures 
to enable them to achieve their development objectives. 
Ministers recognize the need for strengthening the capability of 
GATT and the WTO to provide increased technical assistance in 
their areas of competence, and in particular to substantially 
expand its provision to the least-developed countries. 
  6. Ministers declare that their signature of the "final act 
embodying the results of the Uruguay Round of multilateral trade 
negotiations" and their adoption of associated ministerial 
decisions initiates the transition from GATT to the WTO. They 
have in particular established a preparatory committee to lay 
the ground for the entry into force of the WTO agreement and 
commit themselves to seek to complete all steps necessary to 
ratify the WTO agreement so that it can enter into force by 1 
January 1995 or as early as possible thereafter. Ministers have 
furthermore adopted a decision on trade and environment. 
  7. Ministers express their sincere gratitude to his Majesty 
King Hassan II for his personal contribution to the success of 
this ministerial meeting, and to his government and the people 
of Morocco for their warm hospitality and excellent organization 
they have provided. The fact that this final ministerial 
meeting of the Uruguay Round has been held at Marrakech is an 
additional manifestation of Morocco's commitment to an open 
world trading system and to its fullest integration to the 
global economy. 
  8. With the adoption and signature of the final act and the 
opening for acceptance of the WTO agreement, ministers declare 
the work of the trade negotiations committee to be complete and 
the Uruguay Round formally concluded.

<F P=106> [Unattributed article: "Commission Boosts China Links on </F>
Energy Technology"; as released by Brussels EUROPEAN REPORT] 
  [Text] Efforts to stimulate links between the European 
Union energy industry and its Chinese counterpart received a 
boost from the European Commission on March 17-18. The 
Commission's Directorate-General for Energy (DG XVII) organised 
a two-day conference to bring together top Energy industrialists 
and officials from the EU [European Union] and China to examine 
ways of applying EU technology in clean coal combustion, 
electricity, oil and gas to China's problems. As a follow-up, 
Chinese participants will make a business tour to facilities in 
the Netherlands, Germany, France and the UK on March 21-24 to 
see EU energy technology in operation and establish joint 
venture agreements. They then return to Brussels for further 
discussions with DGXVII on how best to bring the contacts to 
fruition. 
  China ranks third in terms of world energy production and 
consumption and fostering Sino-European energy technology 
cooperation is a strategy designed to bring benefits to both the 
European and Chinese energy sectors. DGXVII has co-operated in 
the energy field for more than 10 years with the Chinese State 
Science Technology Commission through the EU's Thermie programme 
for the promotion of energy technology, and Synergy, for 
development of energy policy and management in non-EU countries. 
With the theoretical bases well established, the Commission 
felt the time was ripe to stimulate their practical application.

London: "Europe's Chemicals Sector Hopes To Pool Research"] 
  [Text] An initiative to promote industry-wide 
collaboration on research and development in Europe's chemical 
sector is to start next month, it emerged in Brussels yesterday. 
  It would mark the first attempt by companies to pool their 
research resources to combat the growing U.S. an Japanese threat. 
  The sector has been suffering from chronic overcapacity 
especially in petrochemical and bulk chemicals. Some 
unprofitable European plant are protected from closure by 
national governments even though their prices are deeply 
undercut by newer plants especially in Asia. 
  Mr. Dirk Hudik, ICI's manager of European affairs, said 
yesterday that research directors from European companies would 
meet next month to identify suitable areas for sector-wide 
research. 
  Programmes would probably centre around environmental 
research, to develop waste management technologies, greater 
energy efficiency and sustainable production. Another 
possibility could be the use of information technology in 
process control, Mr. Hudik added. 
  Two more meetings are likely over the next six months, and 
the companies aim to submit concrete proposals to the European 
Commission by the autumn in the hope of attracting funding. 
  Under its research programme, the Commission usually 
provides 
half the funding for joint industry projects which have hitherto 
been limited to pre-competitive research. 
  With the European chemical industry facing shrinking margins 
and mounting research development costs, there has been growing 
interest in exploring collaboration. 
  Mr. Peter Schwarz, head of research at the Italian chemical 
group Enichem, said yesterday: "We believe co-operation will be 
a large part of operations in the future, particularly in the 
situations of high risk of financial exposure which are present 
in the chemical area."

  [Text] Brussels, March 30 (AFP) -- The following is the 
text of the Brussels declaration on voting rights in an enlarged 
European Union [EU]. 
  1. Declaration of the 12 present Member States of the 
European Union. 
  The representatives of the 12 states referred to above have 
adopted the following declaration at the end of the Conferences 
having elaborated the text of the Treaty on Accession of Norway, 
Austria, Sweden and Finland to the European Union: 
  a. The 12 present Member States of the European Union have 
agreed that, in the hypothesis where four new Member States will 
join the Union, the threshold necessary for a qualified majority 
required by the treaties shall be fixed at 64 votes. They have 
also agreed that the question of the reform of the institutions, 
including the weighting of votes and the threshold of the 
qualified majority in the Council, shall be examined during the 
Conference of representatives of the governments of the Member 
States which shall be convened in 1996, in accordance with 
article N, paragraph 2, of the Treaty on European Union. 
  b. Besides, they have agreed to invite the European 
Parliament, the Council and the Commission to establish a report 
on the functioning of the Treaty on European Union. These 
reports will provide input for the work of a Reflection Group of 
Representatives of the Foreign Ministers which should be created 
by the European Council in Corfu and start its work in mid-1995. 
This Group will work in association with the European 
Parliament. It will, inter alia, prepare options based on the 
positions and arguments of all Member States on the weighting of 
votes and on the threshold of the qualified majority decisions, 
taking into account future enlargement. 
  c. They have taken note that the Council has decided that, 
if Members of the Council representing a total of 23 to 26 votes 
indicate their intention to oppose the adoption by the Council 
of a decision by qualified majority, the Council will do all in 
its power to reach, within a reasonable time and without 
prejudicing obligatory time limits laid down by the Treaties and 
by secondary law, such as in Articles 189b and 189c of the 
Treaty establishing the European Community, a satisfactory 
solution that could be adopted by at least 68 votes. During 
this period, and always respecting the Rules of Procedure of the 
Council, the President undertakes with the assistance of the 
Commission any initiative necessary to facilitate a wider basis 
of agreement in the Council. The members of the Council lend him 
their assistance. 
  d. They have finally agreed that the different elements of 
the present Declaration shall continue to be in operation until 
entry into force of an amendment to the Treaties, following the 
1996 Conference. 
  2. Declaration by the four applicant States. 
  The four applicant States, i.e. Finland, Norway, Austria and 
Sweden, have expressed their agreement on the above texts of the 
Declaration by the 12 Member States of the European Union as 
well as on the text of the Decision by the Council.

<F P=106> [Report by unidentified correpondent on address by Foreign </F>
Minister Klaus Kinkel in the Bundestag debate on 11 Mar 94: 
"There Is No Alternative to Help for the Eastern Neighbors"] 
  [Excerpt] [passage omitted] According to Foreign Minister 
Klaus Kinkel, Russia is of central importance for Europe. 
Therefore, there is no alternative at all to further support 
for President Yeltsin. If stability and economic progress is 
achieved there, the whole of Europe will benefit from it. 
Russia must be fully integrated within the world economy, where 
the division of labor exists, which also applies to the other 
CIS states. In particular, Kinkel mentions Ukraine, whose 
government he requests to accede to the Nonproliferation Treaty. 
Then the minister spoke about his recent meeting with the three 
Baltic ministers in Bonn: 
  Of course, the three Baltic states are a special concern for 
us. Ties in the Baltic area that have been buried for years have 
to be revived again. Of all former Soviet republics, the Baltic 
states can show the most impressive reform successes. Yes, the 
dimensions are small, but they are nevertheless impressive. 
  One objective of our presidency in the second half of the 
year will be to conclude an association agreement with the 
prospect of association also with Latvia, Lithuania, and 
Estonia. The talks that I held with the three Baltic foreign 
ministers in the past few days focused on leading these states 
to the European Union [EU]. Politically and economically stable 
Baltic countries are an advantage for the whole of the region, 
and, by the way, also for Russia. 
  It is the priority task of the European policy of these days 
to join the parts of Europe that have been separated for more 
than four decades. It presents particular challenges to 
Germany, the country in the center. We are particularly 
affected by all the risks, but, on the other hand, especially 
favored with the chances, too. Since the end of 1989, we have 
particularly supported the reform states in Central and East 
Europe. 
  However, the historic chance that lies ahead of us, that is, 
to help the chances of freedom in our east to be transformed 
into jobs and thus into permanent political institutions, far 
exceeds Germany's powers. Also for this reason, it is so 
important that the EU continues to advance consistently on the 
road toward its enlargement, as was outlined in Copenhagen. 
  Of course, the European-Atlantic institutions must not be 
overstrained or overtaxed when stability is extended to Central 
and East Europe. This would not help those who want to become 
members, either. Therefore, we have to beware of a course of 
action that only permits the choice between entry and isolation. 
The right course is a flexible system of increasingly close 
pan-European cooperation in addition to the option of entry. 
  I do not want to fail to mention the Foreign Ministry's 
cultural promotion for the German minorities in Central and East 
Europe. For example, several representations were newly 
established in regions with German minorities. The foreign 
representations in Almaty, Bishkek, Tashkent, Gdansk, Szczecin, 
and soon Novosibirsk and Saratov are dedicating a considerable 
part of their work to the concerns of the German minority in 
their administrative districts. This is good and very important. 
Help for self-help, from the training and advanced training of 
teachers through syllabuses and textbooks to media promotion, is 
primarily the issue here. With this policy, we want to build 
additional bridges to these countries through our minorities, 
but we do not want to create artificial loyalty problems. 
  We must not forget one thing: Europe is more than growth 
figures and foreign trade statistics and also more than the mere 
maximization of affluence. Europe is a cultural area. Whoever 
wants to put it together again has to restart above all the 
intellectual-cultural exchange. A tremendous amount of things 
still have to be done in this respect. 
  Personally, I very much deplore the fact that we have 
relatively few funds for this purpose at a time when we have 
problems and difficulties. Above all I deplore it so much 
because we -- this has often been said in the Bundestag -- have 
an enormous chance as far as our language is concerned. It is 
not unimportant for the Germans -- it is particularly striking 
for me as their foreign minister -- that colleagues, friends, 
and partners who speak German come from these countries to the 
numerous conferences that we hold and where French and English 
have hitherto been the only languages. This is a chance that we 
should use. I ask the German Bundestag again to help me when 
money is at issue and to give a proper impetus. [passage 
omitted]

  [Text] Paris, March 30 (AFP) -- French prime minister 
Edouard Balladur has decided to withdraw the government's plan 
for a youth jobs plan based on hirings at less than the normal 
minimum wage, his office announced on Wednesday [30 March]. 
  The plan, known as the "professional insertion contract" 
(contrat d'insertion professionnelle, CIP), had aroused 
widespread opposition, particularly among young people 
themselves, who staged a number of demonstrations in various 
French cities against the plan. 
  The announcement said the decision to withdraw the measure 
was based on "the results of discussions" held since Monday with 
representatives of unions, young people and employers by the 
head of the National Employment Office, Michel Bon. 
  It added that government aid would be paid to any company 
hiring, for at least 18 months, "a young person who has not yet 
had a stable job." 
  The aid, 1,000 francs ($174 a month) will be paid for nine 
months, and "the aid will be doubled for any hiring before 
October 1."

<F P=106> [Interview with Silvio Berlusconi, leader of the Forza </F>
Italia party by correspondent Bruno Vespa at Berlusconi's home 
in Rome on 29 March; from the "Beyond Words" election program -- 
recorded] 
  [Excerpts] [Vespa] Maybe Umberto Bossi is dragging his 
feet. On the contrary, Silvio Berlusconi seems to agree 
completely with Gianfranco Fini. We have just been to his house 
in Rome, near Piazza Navona, where he gave us this exclusive 
interview: 
  Your alliance came out of these elections well. Do you think 
you will be able to give this country a government soon? 
  [Berlusconi] I hope so, because voters gave a very clear 
indication. I think that for the first time Italians were able 
to choose between two clear proposals. The first, the one on 
the freedom and good government alliance, is a liberal, 
free-market proposal. There is great stress on the economy, on 
the need to relaunch the country, to reduce unemployment, and to 
reduce state spending. The other, the left's proposal, called 
for state intervention [in the economy]. But at least they [the 
left] had a clear program. This had never happened before. I 
think that this first happened thanks to Forza Italia. For the 
first time since 1948 a political force has come forward saying 
clearly what its intentions are and presenting a clear and 
wide-ranging program. The other forces responded to that and I 
think that, for the first time, Italians could choose between 
two forces. One won. I think that the winner received a clear 
indication that it should give the country a government. I hope 
we will be able to do so. 
  [Vespa] If we finished the interview here, viewers would go 
to sleep convinced that there will be a government tomorrow. 
Instead, you have already started arguing. Once again Bossi 
has said, as he said during the election campaign: No, the 
prime minister must be a League candidate. Why is he out to get 
you? I have asked you this question before and I will ask it 
again. 
  [Berlusconi] I must correct you. It is not true that we have 
already started to argue. Bossi is following the same line he 
followed during the election campaign. He voices his doubts and 
marks his territory. I think that this is the way he acts in 
politics. I think that political life should change, that when 
one strikes a deal one should keep his word, that one should 
speak clearly, and that one should not become a theorist of 
double-crossing strategies. But I hope that beyond all that, 
Bossi is also aware of the promise we all together made to the 
country. I am sure that many of the candidates indicated by the 
League are aware of that. 
  [Vespa] Is it the usual horse-trading among allies when a 
government has to be formed? 
  [Berlusconi] I cannot say that it is usual, as it is the 
first time I have tried. I do not want to talk about a usual 
thing because it clashes with my style. I think that we will 
have to sit around a table very soon with a precise program and 
that we will have to discuss that program. All I did today was 
work on the program I will submit to my allies. I held talks 
with many of these allies. I am looking forward to meeting 
Bossi and the people of the League. 
  [Vespa] During the campaign there was talk of forming a 
government by cutting off the wings and of leaving Gianfranco 
Fini out. 
  [Berlusconi] I think voters showed there is a 
liberal-democratic bloc and the whole bloc must be in the 
government. 
  [Vespa] Do you intend broadening it? Are you looking toward 
the center or do you think you can make it by yourself? I would 
like to remind you that you do not have an absolute majority in 
the Senate. 
  [Berlusconi] Yes, but it is a gap that can easily be filled 
with other forces. 
  [Vespa] Which ones? 
  [Berlusconi] There are senators from the Trentino Alto-Adige 
region, of the Sud-Tiroler Volkspartei. There are also the life 
senators. I do not think we will have any problem in finding 
extra votes in the Senate. I really do not think it is going to 
be difficult. As far as I am concerned -- as I have always said 
and as I told Mario Segni and Mino Martinazzoli before the 
elections -- since our programs are not so far apart, I am 
convinced that it will be possible to work together. 
  [Vespa] As we are talking about programs, Achille Occhetto 
told us a short while ago that he hopes Berlusconi will keep the 
promises made to voters. This is what voters want as well, I 
must say. 
  [Berlusconi] This is what Berlusconi wants, more than anyone 
else, if I may say so. 
  [Vespa] You somehat exaggerated. You said: One million new 
jobs. 
  [Berlusconi] I did not exaggerate. I am convinced that it 
is feasible. Let us send a reassuring message to Mr. Occhetto, 
so that he is left with no doubts. I met the people in charge 
of coordination and program this morning, and this morning we 
assigned the tasks to transform the various points in the 
program into bills. We did not do that before because we were 
superstitious. But as of today, we have started to work. 
[passage omitted] We want to be ready to have these points in 
the program transformed into bills immediately after the 
chambers start working. As for employment, I am absolutely 
certain that...[pauses] This morning I spoke...[pauses] I 
spoke so much today. I kept in touch with people from the 
business community, with politicians and journalists. It was a 
big day indeed. I spoke to many industrialist friends, 
industrialists from large concerns and with those from medium 
and small businesses. [passage omitted] They are all eager to 
receive a precise signal they can trust. They want to be 
stimulated by the government. I think that we have very clear 
ideas about what measures are needed to give that signal. These 
will be the first steps taken by the government. You will see 
that what I announced will be realized. All Italians will be 
able to see. We are poised for a recovery and new jobs. We 
will also save the jobs that today are considered to be under 
threat. If we have the possibility to govern, if the opposition 
is with us in desiring good for our country, then I think that 
we will be able to do a lot. We will be able to go in an 
absolutely positive direction, in the direction of economic 
welfare. 
  [Vespa] Did not any of these people with whom you talked 
tell 
you: Mr. Berlusconi, you have too many interests of your own to 
be a steady prime minister. 
  [Berlusconi] They do not tell me these things directly. 
  [Vespa] Second hand information maybe? 
  [Berlusconi] I have just seen a television interview of a 
politician who was saying precisely that. I think that I made 
it clear that I have resigned from all the managing positions in 
my group. 
  [Vespa] You are still the owner though. 
  [Berlusconi] Yes, but I feel very detached from concrete 
problems. I have heard that some people have said that if I 
want to be prime minister, I must sell my companies. Let them 
come forward. If there is someone willing to buy them from me, I 
have nothing against it. It is a joke but it may well become 
true, if it were possible. But I want to assure all those who 
voted for me and also those who are worried at the thought of 
our future government -- if we have the responsibility of 
forming a government -- that as far as I am concerned, I will 
work in everyone's interest. I will certainly work more in 
everyone's interest than in the interest of those who are on our 
side. I will remember that a government must be everyone's 
government. My personal interests will be left behind, they 
will eventually be forgotten, I think. 
  [Vespa] Let us carry on with your joke. If someone came to 
you with the money and said can you sell me a television 
channel? What would you say then? 
  [Berlusconi] Here it is, it is ready. Of course if there was 
no expropriation, no confiscation, and if the price is right, if 
it reflected the true value of something that had been built 
with blood, sweat, and tears . [passage omitted] 
  [Vespa] Do you have any ideas about who the ministers will 
be. 
  [Berlusconi] Yes, of course. I do not think that this is the 
right time to give names. The names must be found with the 
agreement of all the allies. But I think that more than the 
names of ministers, what is important is the points of the 
program on which all the allies will find agreement. I believe 
this will happen very soon. I am about to start work on that. 
  [Vespa] Will the ministers be technocrats or politicians? 
  [Berlusconi] A long-lasting government, as I think the next 
one will be, must be a government formed by responsible people, 
with a political responsibility given to them by the voters. 
This does not mean that there will not be any experts, they 
will probably be advisers. They may also have government 
responsibilities. But this must be a political government 
because this is what the voters clearly asked for. 
  [Vespa] Fini said that it seems acceptable to him to discuss 
with the opposition who the next speakers in the chambers will 
be. Do you agree? 
  [Berlusconi] I have not spoken about this with him. I cannot 
rule out the possibility of electing very experienced 
institutional figures. These are posts that require a lot of 
experience. But we did not discuss that detail. I think that 
the result indicates that there is a majority that forms the 
government and a minority that must be the opposition. I 
personally think that the people responsible for the various 
institutions must be chosen from the people within the ranks of 
the majority. 
  [Vespa] If you realized that your bid to be prime minister 
is 
a hindrance to forming a government, would you step aside? 
  [Berlusconi] I would step aside immediately if the 
alternative solution proposed were the better solution. 
  [Vespa] Thanks Mr. Berlusconi. 
  [Berlusconi] Thank you.

<F P=106> [Announcer-read report] </F>
  [Text] Ministers of State Necmettin Cevheri and Bekir Sami 
Dace, National Defense Minister Mehmet Golhan, and Interior 
Minister Nahit Mentese have resigned. According to a statement 
issued by the Prime Ministry Press Center, the ministers 
submitted their resignations to Prime Minister Tansu Ciller. 
Assessing the election results in their letters of resignation, 
the ministers noted that the True Path Party has emerged 
victorious despite difficult conditions. The ministers added 
that they chose to resign to enable the prime minister to act 
freely in the event a change might be deemed necessary in the 
government. 
  In a statement she issued, Ciller said that a change in the 
government is not currently considered, adding that she views 
the resignation of the ministers as a postelection gesture.

<F P=106> [Article by Sten Jensen: "Aid Without Failure"] </F>
  [Text] The Danish Government will concentrate its aid for 
developing countries on those areas in which it has already 
achieved some expertise, according to a new strategic plan for 
DANIDA [Danish International Development Authority] through the 
year 2000. One of the plan's goals is to decrease the number of 
failed projects. 
  The strategy behind the Danish development aid is to change 
tactics in the fight against poverty. Figuratively speaking, the 
shotguns will be traded in for larger caliber precision weaponry. 
  Instead of shipping off 9 billion Danish kroner worth of 
shotguns in all directions -- and hoping for a few hits -- the 
targets in developing countries will be made smaller, while at 
the same time hoping for hits by a few large bullets. The result 
hopefully will be more bull's-eyes than today. 
  We are not talking about nickels and dimes. Denmark still 
tops the list when it comes to cash support for the poor regions 
of the world. Since 1992, 1 percent of the GNP has been 
allocated for development aid, and this year it is expected to 
top 9 billion kroner. 
  In passing it can be mentioned that one out of five people 
in 
the world has less than seven kroner a day for all of life's 
necessities. About 1.1 billion people live under such conditions. 
  Denmark's development aid corresponds to approximately a 
little more than one day's pay for one-fifth of the world's 
poorest people. 
  How this aid will benefit the poor and the needy is what an 
expert commission in the Ministry of Foreign Affairs has just 
outlined in a strategic plan for Danish development aid through 
the year 2000. 
<H5>  Concentration </H5>
  More than 25 years' experience with Danish involvement in 
developing countries will be reviewed in the plan. 
  The main thrust is that the government's aid organization 
DANIDA is to concentrate its efforts and stick to areas in which 
it already has some expertise. 
  Implicitly this will reduce the number of failed projects -- 
the so-called white elephants. 
  This will happen by giving aid to selected sectors that 
enjoy 
the benefit of Denmark's bilateral, that is direct, support. One 
example is the massive support for the health sector already 
taking place in Zambia in southern Africa. 
  Simplistically said, by the year 2000 an end will have been 
put to the practice of constructing a silo here, a school there, 
and a water pump here. 
  The aid is to be better directed. 
  This also goes for that half of the development aid given to 
multilateral support for international organizations. 
  Last year Denmark contributed 3.9 billion kroner to the UN's 
many affiliated organizations like the World Food Program and 
the UNDP [United Nations Development Program], and also for 
various development banks and funds. The results of the effort 
have not always been well received in the Ministry of Foreign 
Affairs. 
  By the year 2000 Denmark wants to, to a far larger extent, 
donate money to those organizations that the government in 
Copenhagen thinks are following the guidelines that Denmark has 
drawn up for its aid efforts. To be on the donor list will not 
be a goal in itself. 
  At the same time the proposed strategy determines that 
Denmark should use its multilateral billions as leverage to get 
more Danes employed in the UN organizations and to use their 
influence strongly in those areas where they are represented. 
  The main recipients of the bilateral Danish development aid 
today are called planned partner countries. The goal is to have 
20 countries. The great majority of these have been chosen from 
the list of the poorest in the world. Eighteen have been chosen, 
and the last two will have been decided on before the Folketing 
adjourns for the summer -- at which time it probably will have 
accepted the strategic proposal. 
  One of the cornerstones in Danish aid policy for several 
years has been the concept of "poverty orientation"; that is 
Danish money is to benefit the poorest groups in the receiving 
countries. 
  In the strategic plan, however, the idea is that the poverty 
orientation can be relative. This will happen in future years as 
a plan for giving aid is made for each country. Those meetings 
will hardly be dull. Knud Vilby, the head of the aid 
organization International Cooperation, says: "Even though this 
is only a draft I cannot see that there is any guarantee that 
the aid will be in relation to the poverty criteria." 
<H5>  New Concepts </H5>
  One of the aid policy's key concepts so far has been aid for 
a particular project. That covers the strategy up to the present 
time of giving bilateral aid aimed at particular projects in the 
developing countries. This concept will frequently still be 
appearing in DANIDA's internal working language toward the year 
2000, but with a somewhat devalued meaning, and it might be 
displaced by concepts like: "General program aid" and 
"sector-program aid." 
  To the extent that Danish aid for a particular project will 
continue to be given, the projects shall not be very large, but 
clearly innovative and something that can serve as a model, 
according to the strategic proposal. That means that some of the 
current aid projects will be phased out by the year 2000. In 
return, organizations like International Cooperation can get 
money to establish projects in the respective countries. 
  Through the year 2000 the focus is on state bilateral aid in 
return for: 

  -  Support for the receiving countries' staggering balance of 
payments, debt relief, and aid in the form of goods and 
materials, as well as for easing the effect of the enormous 
social decline the countries experience as they are exposed to 
demands from the World Bank to change over to a free market 
economy. 
  -  Support for the development of reforms in a 
well-defined area like, for example, the health sector, or for 
the establishment of an effective administrative system. 
  These two new concepts serve notice of new times ahead for 
both DANIDA's employees, their delegates, and the receiving 
countries as well as for the voluntary aid organizations, the 
NGO's [nongovermentals]. 
  The partial reorganization of aid-giving will involve, among 
other things, that DANIDA will send out experts for shorter 
periods of time. The receiving countries will to a larger extent 
than before be responsible for development -- and the money -- 
and the experts will remain more in the background. The show 
will be run by the local powers. 
  On the other hand the proposal also stresses that abuse and 
corruption will result in Denmark's immediate shutoff of the 
money. 
  For the NGO's the change in strategy means that they will be 
ensured of having a larger influence in DANIDA's decisionmaking 
process and that humanitarian organizations, among other things, 
will have the possibility of starting development projects as a 
replacement of direct aid. 
  The business sector, which at times has had a tense 
relationship with DANIDA, will also be invited to join in 
working out aid strategies for the planned partner countries. In 
the strategy proposal it has even been determined that a major 
aspect of the cooperation with Danish business is that export 
possibilities will be derived from it. In the future businesses 
will come in from the cold with promises of more orders, more 
credit, and increased possibilities for cooperation with private 
enterprise in the planned partner countries. 
<H5>  Women and the Environment </H5>
  It is known that the role of women in poor countries is 
closely connected with the countries' development potential and 
DANIDA has, along with the NGO's, for many years supported 
projects that will benefit women. It is therefore not unexpected 
that the female aspect of this is one of the areas that will 
receive the highest priority toward the year 2000. Before an aid 
project can be launched, plans for how a particular project will 
improve the situation of women must be worked out. 
  The environmental aspect, which will be incorporated into 
Danish aid from now on, will receive similar top priority. 
  According to the strategic proposal, this is to be taken so 
literally that environmental effects will be surveyed in 
connection with all physical development projects started with 
Danish support. One can hear an echo here from the UN Conference 
on Environment and Development in Rio in 1992. 
  The proposal also mentions the so-called Environment and 
Catastrophic Fund; an outgrowth of the development aid that will 
gradually toward the year 2000 be receiving 0.5 percent of the 
GNP. At that time it will amount to 4 billion kroner. Some 2 
billion kroner have been earmarked for restoring the global 
environment and is to be administered by the Ministry of 
Environmental Affairs and the Ministry of Foreign Affairs. The 
remaining 2 billion will be spent on asylum-seekers in Denmark 
and on humanitarian aid. 
<H5>  Overpopulation </H5>
  Toward the year 2000 Denmark will also concentrate more on 
development programs whose goal is to permanently reduce 
population growth. This is a very emotional issue, and Denmark 
has not previously given direct bilateral aid to population 
policy programs. There have been fundamental doubts about 
getting involved in anything that hints of population control. 
  When planning ahead, strategies for DANIDA's efforts in the 
area of population must be worked out this year. Just the 
wording of the plan mirrors the sensibilities involved: "The 
strategy will be based on activities aiming to strengthen the 
individual woman's and the individual couple's possibility to 
choose how many children they want and to plan [the size of] 
their family." 
  Just wait until September when the UN has its international 
conference in Cairo on Population and Health. 
  Here Denmark's strategy will form a part of the declarations 
along with, for instance, those of strict Islamic and Catholic 
countries. And then even the vaguest hints of contraception 
might create some commotion. 
  While we are talking about wording, it is worth ruminating 
on 
one of the final remarks of the proposal: "The strategy of 
Danish development policy toward the year 2000 is to make up a 
superior framework for how to transform the general goals into 
practical efforts in the coming years. The carrying out of these 
goals is not a goal in itself, but a means that constantly much 
be adjusted to the development." 
  This strategy is to be evaluated again -- in 1997.

<F P=106> ["Text" of document Turkish Cypriot leader Rauf Denktas </F>
submitted to Gustav Feissel, UN secretary general's assistant 
special envoy in Cyprus, on 29 March -- all punctuation as 
published] 
  [Text] Subparagraph 4 of Paragraph 38 of the UN secretary 
general's report, dated 1 July 1993, says the following: "The 
Turkish and Greek Cypriots will be able to enter the fenced area 
in Maras [Varosha] freely and without any formality." 
  The Turkish Cypriot side showed goodwill by agreeing to the 
addition of the words "safe travel to and from the fenced area" 
to the first key issue in the talks that were held to establish 
the key points for the implementation of the package of 
confidence-building measures. (14 February 1994) 
  Regardless of the specific provisions, the UN documents 
dated 
9 and 21 March, which are referred to as nondocuments, have been 
observed to contain an inclination to deviate from the package 
of confidence-building measures and create a new dimension by 
placing an area outside the fenced area in Maras (that is the 
road between the southern perimeter of the fenced area in Maras 
and the buffer zone that is under UN control) under UN 
jurisdiction. 
  Placing the area between the southern perimeter of the 
fenced 
area in Maras and the buffer zone that is under the protection 
of the United Nations under UN jurisdiction conflicts 
fundamentally with the guarantees the UN secretary general and 
his representatives have given several times to the Turkish 
Cypriot side in Nicosia and New York. 
  Considering the contents of the package and the guarantees 
of 
the UN secretary general and his representatives, and acting 
with the wish to maintain a positive and constructive approach 
and remain open to the idea of cooperation, the Turkish Cypriot 
side proposes the following: 
  A. The Turkish Cypriot side undertakes to create the 
conditions that will enable the Greek Cypriots to travel to and 
from the fenced area in Maras freely and securely, without 
formality or obstruction. 
  B. The entry point of the road between the buffer zone that 
is under UN control and the fenced area in Maras will be 
controlled by Turkish Cypriot police units, which will guarantee 
unrestricted, unobstructed, and safe travel. 
  C. No formality will be required whatsoever for travel to 
and from the entry point referred to. 
  D. The UN observation post in the buffer zone that is under 
UN control will be able to observe activity at the Turkish 
Cypriot entry and exit point. 
  E. UN personnel who travel in the area between the southern 
perimeter of the fenced area in Maras and the buffer zone that 
is under UN control will be able to observe the unrestricted, 
unobstructed, and safe travel on the road referred to. 
  F. The Turkish Cypriot side undertakes to put into effect 
all appropriate measures that may be required to further 
reassure the Greek Cypriots who travel to and from the fenced 
area in Maras about their security. 
  Considering the fact that (1) the two sides in Cyprus have 
undertaken to remain sincerely committed to the package of 
confidence-building measures in "the arrangements that will be 
made to resolve the problems related to the implementation of 
the package," (2) the UN officials will submit a report to the 
UN secretary general on the implementation of the package of 
confidence-building measures every six months, and (3) the 
detailed package that has been drawn up by the UN secretary 
general establishes a balance between gains and risks, the 
Turkish Cypriot side is convinced that the above-mentioned 
arrangements, which will allow the Greek Cypriots to freely 
travel to and from the fenced area in Maras without any 
restrictions or obstructions, fully comply with the word and 
spirit of the package of confidence-building measures that the 
UN secretary general outlined in his report to the UN Security 
Council dated 1 June 1993.

  [Text] Paris, April 1 (AFP) -- France and the United States 
are cooperating in the effort to get a clause on workers' rights 
added to the new General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT) 
accord, French Trade Minister Gerard Longuet said Thursday [31 
March]. 
  The idea is being fiercely resisted by developing countries, 
who see it as a protectionist measure by industrialized nations, 
and threatens to mar the April 12 opening at Marrakesh of a GATT 
conference scheduled to climax in the signing of the biggest 
trade liberalization package ever. 
  Longuet, speaking to members of the French employers' 
organisation, said he had discussed the question with U.S. Trade 
Representative Mickey Kantor Wednesday. 
  French government sources said they had agreed that Longuet 
would lobby European Union Trade Commissioner Leon Brittain and 
also Germany, which is particularly unenthusiastic, while Kantor 
would approach GATT Director-General Peter Sutherland, who 
supports the developing countries. 
  Longuet said it was a matter of "making people realise that 
freeing up the world economy must be counterbalanced by the 
respect for the mimimum standards of the International Labour 
Organisation on child labour and forced labour by those 
benefitting from free trade." 
  In addition, countries that have reached a certain level of 
development have an obligation to harmonise over the long term 
with developed nations on labour questions, he added. 
  "Experience proves that when France and the United States 
share the same point of view, there is a chance not necessarily 
to settle the problem but at least open the door, or put a foot 
in it so that it can not be closed." 
  In Geneva on Wednesday failure to agree on the question of a 
social clause led the United States to block the final draft of 
a Marrakesh ministerial declaration and a document on the 
mandate of a preparatory committee for a new World Trade 
Organization. 
  European Union negotiators proposed a compromise wording 
referring to the possibility of raising "new issues" without 
mentioning the trade-workers' link, but Washington and Paris 
dismissed it as too weak.

<F P=106> [Interview with IAEA Director General Hans Blix by Gerhard </F>
Bitzan; place and date not given: "`No Alternative to Nuclear 
Power'; Blix Also Trusts Temelin"] 
  [Text] [Bitzan] Mr. Director General Blix, the nuclear 
power plants in East Europe are criticized by many people. How 
do you assess the safety standards of Temelin? 
  [Blix] You would have to discuss this in detail with our 
safety experts. All that I can say is that the Temelin reactor 
is not a Chernobyl type. It is a heavy-water reactor whose 
construction and design resembles a Western one. Less 
sophisticated electronics were normally used for it. As is 
known, however, the Czechs entrusted Westinghouse with the 
development of additional control systems. I am sure that 
Prague's objective is to have a safety standard like in the West. 
  [Bitzan] Do you think that Vienna's attitude, that is, 
massive influence on the nuclear policy of a neighboring state, 
is right? 
  [Blix] I do not want to get involved in a bilateral 
Austrian-Czech conflict. Basically, every country is free to 
have the nuclear policy that it wants. If Austria -- in 
addition to Ireland, Luxembourg, and Denmark -- wants to be 
nuclear-free, this is its business. However, I am personally of 
the opinion that nuclear power will be indispensable in the 
future. Look at the Czech Republic. They know that their only 
alternative is more coal power plants. The Greens will tell you 
that the future power demand can be met by savings, wind power, 
and biomass. However, even such organizations as the World 
Energy Conference say that such views of the Greens are naive. 
  [Bitzan] In your opinion, why does nuclear energy involve 
less danger than conventional energy? 
  [Blix] In the long run, we only have the nuclear option. It 
was resolved in Rio to reduce the carbon dioxide emissions to 
the level of 1990 by 2005. But the reality is different. If 
the world fears the greenhouse effect, only nuclear power can be 
the answer. 
  In addition, safety is today far greater than in 1986, for 
example, when Chernobyl happened. As far as nuclear waste is 
concerned, its volume is so small that it can be completely 
isolated and returned to the soil. This is in contrast to the 
enormous amounts of fossil residues that remain on the surface 
of the Earth and are forever toxic. They do not even have a 
half-life period.

  [Excerpts] Brussels, March 31 (AFP) -- NATO Thursday [31 
March] called on Russia to discuss what it said were 
misunderstandings over the functioning of a joint partnership 
program after reports that Moscow was reconsidering plans to 
join the deal. 
  "Reports hint at a misunderstanding over the reason for the 
existence of the Partnership, its objectives and functioning, 
said a NATO official who refused to be identified. We are ready 
to begin a dialogue with the Russians on the issue." [passage 
omitted] 
  "NATO has understood that Russia wants to effectively join 
the Partnership and (Russians) actually indicated possible 
dates" for joining, the NATO official added. [passage omitted]

  [Text] After Cote d'Ivoire, it is now Cameroon's turn. 
Indeed, the country has been granted a reduction of its public 
debt by the Paris Club, which includes various Western 
creditors. Thus the Cameroon public debt is being rescheduled 
in accordance with the so-called London terms, which are the 
most favorable conditions that the Paris Club can grant. 
Norbert Navaro reports: 
  [Begin Navaro recording] It is the first time that Cameroon 
has been granted a collective reduction of its debt. This debt 
totals 45 billion French francs, equivalent to 4.5 billion CFA 
francs. Two-thirds of this sum make up Cameroon's public debt, 
the only one the Paris Club is interested in. 
  The Paris Club has granted preferential treatment to 
Yaounde. 
Like Cote d'Ivoire, Cameroon is one of the four countries with a 
so-called intermediary income in the franc zone. The two others 
are Congo and Gabon. Until Cote d'Ivoire set a precedent last 
Friday [25 March], the annulment of 50 percent of debts was 
granted to the poorest countries only. 
  The Paris Club is only concerned with little less than 900 
billion CFA francs of Cameroon's debt on this occasion. This 
corresponds to the financial commitments that were not honored 
in the past, plus those that will come up in the next 18 months 
-- this is the duration of the agreement between Yaounde and the 
IMF which was reached on 15 March. Fifty percent of a small 
part of these 900 billion CFA francs will be annulled, and the 
remainder will be spread over 23 years. 
  The Paris Club was admittedly more generous with Cote 
d'Ivoire last Friday, but this unprecedented -- and unexpected 
-- help toward Cameroon comes in addition to the annulment of a 
debt worth 400 billion CFA francs granted by France to Dakar on 
12 January, the date of the devaluation. [end recording]

<F P=106> [Article by French Prime Minister Edouard Balladur: "For a </F>
Stability Pact in Europe"] 
  [Text] In 1989, Europe was suddenly inspired by a great 
hope of freedom, democracy, and social progress. Our now 
reunified continent had to face an exhilarating challenge. 
Opening up before it was the chance to overcome historical 
divisions and to return to the forefront of the international 
stage. 
  In three years, our hopes faded. The transition in the East 
proved more difficult and more expensive than had been foreseen, 
the economic crisis caused unemployment to rise, and the drama 
in the former Yugoslavia reminded everyone how difficult it is 
to assume the heritage of history. Confidence in the future 
gave way to concern. Today, it is up to Europe's leaders to 
react against this wave of pessimism and to restore confidence 
to our continent. 
  This is why, as soon as I took office in April 1993, I 
proposed to organize negotiations with a view to adopting a 
stability pact in Europe. Its main aim is to put into practice 
the major principles which all the countries of the European 
continent have accepted for many years, notably by signing the 
Paris Charter of the CSCE. 
  Today, everyone recognizes the territorial integrity of 
states and the inviolability of borders, everyone recognizes the 
right of each individual, even if a member of a minority, to 
benefit from universal human rights. 
  Many institutions, such as the CSCE or the Council of 
Europe, 
play a remarkable role in ensuring that these rights are 
respected. But everybody also knows that, in our Europe marked 
by a long and troubled history and, as a result, by wars and 
population movements, questions and uncertainties still remain. 
The continent of Europe must put these problems of minorities 
and of borders behind it, once and for all. 
  The time is opportune as, thanks to the wisdom and 
moderation 
of many governments, these difficulties are now contained. But 
what would happen if a crisis flared up tomorrow, caused by 
whatever economic or social circumstance? 
<H5>  Project Launch on 26 and 27 May </H5>
  Good neighbor relations must therefore be established so 
closely between the people of Central Europe that their borders 
will never again be the subject of dispute. Respect for the 
rights of individuals belonging to minority groups must be 
perfectly guaranteed, so that these groups will automatically 
accord their loyalty to the countries of which they are citizens. 
  It is time to demonstrate our confidence in the future and 
to 
show our political commitment in favor of stability in Europe. 
I have proposed that the European Union (EU) and all those 
countries which are interested in the stability of our 
continent, and in particular the United States and Russia, 
should offer the countries of Central and East Europe a 
political framework within which to organize in the best 
possible way relations between neighboring countries so that 
problems of borders and of minorities shall never again arise. 
This initiative was accepted at the European summit in Brussels 
in December 1993. It is only natural for this to be the first 
joint foreign policy and security action by the EU. It 
demonstrates the will of the EU to place its economic strength 
and stability in the service of the continent as a whole. 
  At the Copenhagen summit in July 1993, the Twelve decided to 
open the door to the prospect of membership for the countries of 
Central and East Europe. Everybody understands that this 
enlargement will be made easier if the sources of instability 
are no more, and our economic and political structures aligned. 
Everybody also understands that this enlargement must also 
involve the field of security. 
  This is the thinking behind the proposal made to countries 
seeking to join the EU to create a status of associate member of 
the WEU [Weestern European Union], in conformity with the EU 
aims to avail itself of a joint defense and security policy. 
The new organization of the continent of Europe that we are 
seeking must extend to all aspects of our common life. We must 
all work together on this, and as of now. 
  The conference to launch this stability pact project will be 
held on 26 and 27 May. I believe this conference should be the 
start of a diplomatic process, the need for which everybody is 
now aware, to judge by the number of bilateral accords currently 
being negotiated but which sometimes prove difficult to 
successfully conclude. It must refocus attention on the 
commitment of all the participating countries to the principal 
existing texts and launch several tables of bilateral 
negotiations, or of regional negotiations in order to deal with 
the regional aspects of good neighborliness between these 
countries. 
  It is not therefore a question of writing new texts, of 
creating a new institution, and even less of seeking to replace 
the free will of the interested countries. I believe that the 
presence of moderators at these negotiating tables will serve to 
reassure all parties, offering them support and, if possible, 
the objectivity of a third party. These third parties could be 
the EU, or an institution, or member countries, and France is 
ready to lend its assistance to anyone who may request it. 
Because the fact remains that the question of good 
neighborliness often involves tackling matters of extreme 
sensitivity in the area of domestic policy. 
<H5>  A Signal of European Will </H5>
  Everybody must therefore commit themselves to this process 
with every assurance that justice will be respected. There will 
no longer be large or small countries, but rather partners in a 
common cause. The relations of the past 30 years between France 
and Germany testify to the extraordinary results which bilateral 
accords can achieve when inspired by strong political will and 
when they create the appropriate procedures. Franco-German 
consultations are so close and frequent at all levels of the 
state and society that, for example, the border between the two 
countries which was formerly so heavily emotionally and 
symbolically charged has today become a symbol of rapprochement. 
  The accords which the parties will reach will be grouped 
within a stability pact to be signed by all the participants at 
the conference which will conclude this process. They will thus 
be lending decisive support to the legitimacy of these accords. 
The signatures of countries seeking to join the EU will be a 
fundamental element in drawing closer to the EU. 
  Respect for these accords will guarantee harmonious progress 
of the European enterprise. It may be supposed that the formal 
nature of this pact will constitute in Europe a very strong and 
significant signal in favor of stability. This signal will be 
understood by all those who govern the economy, together with 
all the other powers in the world who will see in it both 
Europe's will to once again serve as an example for the respect 
of the human values which were born in our continent, and an 
area of progress for the people who live on European soil.

<F P=106> [Article by Christophe Lamfalussy: "Charlemagne Building </F>
Under Surveillance"] 
  [Excerpts] Soon, official documents will be classified and 
security investigations will be carried out. The transparency 
of the Twelve is not without its limits. The 2,000 officials 
working at the Council of Ministers, most of whom work in the 
Charlemagne Building in Brussels, will soon be subjected to 
security regulations aimed at reducing access to confidential 
documents and screening the trustworthiness of some of its 
staff. [passage omitted] 
  The Council is where European policy is coordinated and 
where 
the memoranda of each government end up. The implementation of 
the Maastricht Treaty, which makes the Council responsible for 
the Common Foreign and Security Policy (CFSP) and for 
cooperation on issues of justice, has effectively increased its 
power. [passage omitted] 
  The Twelve envisage creating four categories of document -- 
top secret, secret, confidential, and restricted -- which would 
remain classified for five years. The top secret documents 
would contain information that unauthorized divulgence would 
have extremely serious consequences for the essential interests 
of the Union and its member states. 
  The Staff Committee simply wants to abolish the "restricted" 
category, the definition of which is so broad that its 
implementation would mean that neither the media nor the members 
of the European Parliament would no longer have access to 
significant information. 
  Another focus of discontentment is that the Twelve intend to 
make the secret services responsible for conducting security 
investigations of all those officials authorized to consult 
confidential documents. [passage omitted] 
  Since there is no European secret service, the Staff 
Committee has suggested that the Belgian secret service do the 
investigating. Such procedures have existed within the European 
Commission since 1958 due to the Euratom Treaty, which delegated 
powers in the area of nuclear safety.

<F P=106> [Article by Ruediger Moniac: "Europe Will Get Eyes in </F>
Space--If Germany Pays; Its Own Reconnaissance Satellites Are 
Supposed To Create Independence From the United States"] 
  [Text] The endeavor to make Europe into an independently 
acting entity is making progress, especially in the use of space 
for gaining information, an area in which France has 
traditionally coveted independence. The utility of space ranges 
from the commitment of armed forces to the achievement of 
general political objectives (such as observation of the 
environment, exploration of natural resources, surveillance of 
borders, and inaccessible regions). 
  On 13 May, the agenda of the Council of Ministers of the 
Western European Union [WEU] includes consideration of the 
decision to pursue the development of an independent European 
system of observation satellites. A report on implementation 
possibilities has already been completed; everybody is waiting 
for Bonn. The Federal Republic has to decide before the May 
session whether it wants to commit considerable capital to such 
an "Eyes in Space" system. 
  One argument frequently heard in Germany is: Why spend so 
much money on European satellite-supported reconnaissance, when 
we can rely on our American partners. The United States own the 
most efficient systems and German government offices have 
received information from U.S. sources on specific occasions. 
  However, the whole truth includes the fact that this is 
based 
on reciprocity. The United States expect something in return. 
However, such a policy is not permanently compatible with the 
interests of European countries since the United States is 
currently redefining its foreign and defense policy priorities 
while Europe wants to play a partnership role in the 
Euro-Atlantic structure on the basis of independence. 
  Europe needs an independent capability to receive unfiltered 
information and to assess developments outside its borders. 
Meanwhile Defense Minister Ruehe in a white book released this 
week by the Cabinet has also accepted this view. This document 
contains the following clause: "For the early recognition of 
regional crises,...and to defend its interests in developing 
joint plans within alliances and the United Nations, the Federal 
Government requires an accurate, up-to-date view of the 
situation." This calls for various types of information, 
including information gained from satellites: Reconnaissance to 
assist in the formulation of policy, not in lieu of policy 
decisions. 
  Here is an example from 1986: For several days uncertainty 
prevailed whether a second nuclear power plant in Chernobyl was 
threatened with meltdown. If European countries had possessed 
satellites with multispectral sensors, there would have been no 
uncertainty and the European countries could have taken 
precautionary measures based on information thus gained. 
  However, the Federal Republic is still undecided which 
department should become "responsible" for such an observation 
system since there is, so to speak, no "natural and primary 
user" for this type of information. Independent experts, 
therefore, have suggested appointing an intergovernmental 
commission, which reports to the office of the chancellor, to 
prepare for the decision in May and to develop guidelines for 
reorganization within the government. Time is passing rapidly. 
The two specific issues are 20-percent participation in the 
Helios 2 Project (daylight observations) developed by France 
and, second, majority participation (50 percent or more) for a 
high-resolution radar reconnaissance satellite. Because of its 
technological capabilities as well as its political status in 
Europe's center, no other power is as suited as Germany for an 
SAR system (active microwave radar). The cost? It has not been 
accurately determined. Experts say: In the initial phase 
"several hundred million a year."

<F P=106> [Interview with European Parliament President Egon Klepsch </F>
by Frank B. Meyer; place and date not given: "The Community 
Should Be Able To Function"] 
  [Text] [Meyer] On 12 June new elections will be held for 
the European Parliament. Important and experienced Europeans 
will not run again. These include Vice President Hans Peters and 
the chairman of the budget committee, Thomas von der Vring. Nor 
are you on the list of candidates--why not? 
  [Klepsch] That is a difficult question. Let me say this: 
There were special considerations in my party's land 
organization in the Rhineland-Palatinate to which I did not turn 
a deaf ear. 
  [Meyer] That means lines were drawn and you fell through the 
cracks. Could one say it that way? 
  [Klepsch] I could have resisted, but after having been a 
member of Parliament for 29 years.... 
  [Meyer] The president of the European Parliament is newly 
elected every two and a half years. He will, therefore, never be 
as well-known as the president of the Commission. Does 
Parliament thus forego the chance to create a personality that 
would reinforce the public's awareness of Parliament? 
  [Klepsch] I think it is a good arrangement. It strengthens 
the integration of Parliament and allows all parliamentary 
positions to be reexamined every two and a half years. I also 
think that the question depends on the individual. I am quite 
well known in the European Community. A prophet always has the 
greatest difficulties in his own country. 
  [Meyer] The 18 east German delegates will not become full 
members until the newly elected Parliament convenes. Paris 
wanted to prevent this, in case you do not want to sign the 
lease agreement for the planned new Parliament building in 
Strasbourg. Will you give in and sign? 
  [Klepsch] The German media have sometimes given the 
impression that the issue revolved only around the 18 east 
German delegates. The real issue is the implementation of a 
system of graded proportionality for the entire Parliament. The 
package also included the determination of the number of 
European Community seats in a dozen cases and, especially, the 
final determination of seats for the Council and for Parliament. 
These decisions must now be ratified internally by the national 
parliaments. I think a favorable decision will be made shortly. 
  [Meyer] Does that mean you will sign the lease? 
  [Klepsch] Under the right conditions. 
  [Meyer] Following the Nordic countries and Austria, Estonia, 
Latvia, Lithuania, Poland, Hungary, the Czech and Slovak 
republics, and probably Slovenia are also seeking to join the 
European Union [EU]. These countries would benefit greatly from 
membership. What would be the advantage for West Europe? 
  [Klepsch] I think the most important question remains the 
following: To what extent is the community's ability to function 
guaranteed? Such a guarantee exists for the Nordic states and 
for Austria if some minimum conditions are observed. The 
question will, of course, be carefully evaluated for each new 
membership. 
  But there are, after all, many different intermediate 
stages. 
The European Economic Area, for instance, is suitable for those 
who do not want to sacrifice sovereignty to integration. There 
are association agreements, such as those we have with the 
Visegrad countries, in which the Baltic countries are 
interested. To come to a decision within a reasonable time 
should not be a problem as I see it--the same holds true for 
Slovenia. 
  [Meyer] Can we expect a uniform right of asylum in the EU 
and 
a joint asylum policy? 
  [Klepsch] There are strong indications. The Maastrich Treaty 
was a beginning. It is in the common interest to establish a 
joint policy. 
  [Meyer] The institutions of the EU are constantly asked to 
become democratic. Yet, the preconditions for a European 
democracy are simply not present: There is no single European 
nation, no common European language, and there definitely are no 
European parties... 
  [Klepsch] But these are problems for a nation state. Where 
do we live? We are not a nation state; we will never be a nation 
state. I still think the best way to define the European Union 
is to call it a "sui generis" [one of a kind] object. Even all 
this talk about a confederation or a federation in Europe is 
really an internal German debate about constitutional law 
triggered by our own constitutional structure, and so forth. It 
is irrelevant to others. 
  [Meyer] Why, then, did the Christian Democratic Union [CDU] 
decide in favor of a federal model for Europe? 
  [Klepsch] The CDU has correctly opted for a federal 
solution. 
If I look at the whole structure, I see that it moves steadily 
and continuously toward what we call a federal structure. There 
is an obvious reason: For our future survival and to solve our 
problems, we must act jointly. 
  [Meyer] Why should our male and female citizens bother 
voting 
in the European election at all? 
  [Klepsch] For the same reason they vote in any election: To 
pick their representatives, the delegates who, on their behalf, 
can control how and by whom power is exercised and the extent to 
which the exercise of power can be limited and influenced. 
<H5>  [Box, p 7] </H5>
<H5>  Parliament Must Consent </H5>
  Article 228 (Agreements With Third States or Organizations) 
of the treaty concerning the European Union discusses the role 
of the European Parliament:.. the consent of the European 
Parliament is required for agreements as defined by Article 238 
(Association) and agreements that...create a particular 
institutional framework, for agreements that have a considerable 
financial impact on the Community, and for agreements that 
require amendments to a...legal instrument. In urgent cases, the 
Council and the European Parliament may agree on a deadline for 
such consent. 
  Article O (Admission of New Members) stipulates: Every 
European country may apply for membership in the Union. The 
country addresses its application to the Council; the Council 
then decides unanimously after hearing from the Commission and 
after Parliament, which decides with an absolute majority of its 
members, has agreed.

<F P=106> [Unattributed article: "EU/Macedonia: EU Hands Greece Final </F>
Deadline"; as released by EUROPEAN REPORT] 
  [Text] Hans Van Den Broek, the European Commissioner for 
External Relations, on March 28 gave the Greek Government a 
final deadline for ending its embargo against The Former 
Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia (FYROM) before proceeding to the 
Court of Justice of the European Union. Following talks with 
Greek Prime Minister, Andreas Papandreou, and Foreign Minister 
Karolos Papoulias in Athens, Mr. Van Den Broek indicated that 
the European Commission would make a decision in the matter 
after the Easter recess. The Greek Government thus has until 
April 6 to respond to the Commission. 
  Mr. Van Den Broek, making available his good offices for 
talks between Greece and the FYROM, travelled to Athens after 
the informal Council of Foreign Affairs Ministers, meeting in 
Ioannina, Greece on March 26 and 27, asked Greece to lift its 
embargo against FYROM. The Commission, which is responsible for 
enforcing the EU Treaties, must ensure that Community law is 
upheld, Mr. Van Den Broek commented. He added that the 
Commission will use its political influence to find a permanent 
and satisfactory solution to the controversy. He went on to say 
that he would join forces with Cyrus Vance, the UN negotiator, 
and Matthew Nimetz, President Clinton's special envoy, who are 
working on the same issue. Mr. Papoulias is expected to meet 
with Mr Vance in New York shortly. 
<H5>  Greek Outrage </H5>
  A spokesman for the Greek Government, Evangelos Venizelos, 
dismissed the informal Council's criticisms of Greece, which 
were made by the other European Union Member States, remarking 
that such criticisms will only encourage FYROM to harden its 
position and will not help Mr. Vance's cause. Greece found 
itself isolated from the other eleven Member States, which 
rejected the claims of an "external danger" which it uses to 
justify the embargo begun on February 16. The Greek Government 
cited Article 224 of the Treaty, which concerns problems of 
public order or external security . 
  Klaus Kinkel, the German Foreign Minister, commented 
following the meeting that Greece's arguments had no valid 
basis. He added that it is clear that a solution must be found 
if legal consequences are to be avoided. He gave the Greeks 
some friendly advice: To settle their political and semantic 
quarrels with the FYROM before the end of their Presidency of 
the EU. Greece could find itself before the Court of Justice of 
the European Union if it continues to ignore its EU partners' 
warnings. 
<H5>  Appeal by the FYROM </H5>
  Macedonia President Kiro Gligorov has written to [EC 
Commission President] Jacques Delors outlining the political and 
economic dangers to his country, seven weeks after the Greek 
embargo began. While reiterating his willingness to negotiate 
with the Greek authorities, Mr. Gligorov remarked in his letter 
that it is inconceivable that a small, democratic country and a 
member of the United Nations, which managed not to be drawn into 
the war in the former Yugoslavia, could be subjected to economic 
strangulation. Who should take responsibility for this 
situation, if not the European Union? Is the EU ready to face 
another Bosnia? he asked. 
  Greece moved on February 16 to block all trade with the 
FYROM, particularly through the port of Thessalonika, through 
which 80 percent of the country's oil and 70 percent of its 
other imports and exports must transit. Greece wants the FYROM 
to give up the name of Macedonia, amend certain articles of its 
Constitution and change the symbols on its flag.

<F P=106> [Article signed AZ: "Federal Counselor Cotti's Visit to </F>
Athens -- No Official Guarantee on the Opening of Swiss-EU 
Negotiations"] 
  [Excerpts] Athens, 30 Mar (ATS) -- Federal Counselor Flavio 
Cotti did not get any official guarantee today about the opening 
of bilateral negotiations between Switzerland and the European 
Union (EU). During his one-day visit to the Greek capital, the 
head of the Federal Department of Foreign Affairs (DFAE) 
explained to his hosts Switzerland's position regarding European 
integration. 
  At a press conference, the head of the DFAE underlined the 
"friendly" atmosphere in which the talks with his Greek 
counterpart, Karolos Papoulias, took place. Mr. Cotti also met 
with the Greek European Minister Theodoros Pangalos. Regional 
issues were also raised, namely, the situation in former 
Yugoslavia, Greek-Turkish relations, and the partition of Cyprus. 
  "Switzerland would be pleased if bilateral negotiations with 
the EU began during the Greek presidency," which will come to an 
end in June, according to Mr. Cotti. The head of the DFAE 
stated that, if those negotiations began "quickly enough," this 
would "create excellent psychological conditions in 
Switzerland." The long-term "strategic goal" of Switzerland is 
indeed a "full and complete" membership in the European Union, 
the federal counselor added. 
<H5>  No Official Guarantee </H5>
  Questioned by ATS, Greek Minister Theodoros Pangalos 
remained 
reserved about the opening of bilateral negotiations between 
Switzerland and the EU during Greece's EU Presidency. 
Nevertheless, Mr. Pangalos said it was likely that those 
negotiations would begin before the end of the year. [passage 
omitted] 
  Mr. Papoulias for his part said that Mr. Cotti's visit, the 
first by the head of the Swiss diplomatic corps since 1976, 
testified to the "political will" of both countries to develop 
and strengthen bilateral relations. He "thanked" Switzerland 
for its contribution to the financing of the UN peacekeeping 
forces in Cyprus.

<F P=106> [Article signed JLV/MAR: "European Commission: Ioannina </F>
Compromise `Not Legally Binding'"] 
  [Excerpt] Brussels, 30 Mar (BELGA) -- [Passage omitted] 
British Prime Minister John Major on Tuesday [29 March] gave the 
Commons his view of the Ioannina compromise. According to Mr. 
Major, the compromise guarantees countries opposed to a decision 
"a considerable reprieve" and is "legally binding." 
  Mr. Major threatened: "Any dispute can be settled by the 
European Court of Justice in Luxembourg, taking whatever time is 
needed." 
  On Wednesday, the European Commission (EC) presented to a 
meeting of European Union (EU) country representatives its 
vision of the Ioannina compromise. In its opinion, it is merely 
a "political declaration of goodwill" which is "not legally 
binding and cannot therefore serve as the basis of any recourse 
to the European Court of Justice." 
  The EC added that the Ioannina compromise did not affect the 
current internal rules of the European Council of Ministers. 
The regulations state that "a vote can be taken whenever a 
Member State or the EC so requests, and a simple majority (seven 
states out of 12) are agreed." 
  The EC stressed on Wednesday: "The EC will not hesitate to 
use this right. The European Parliament will without doubt 
ensure this." 
  The European executive body was again keen to point out that 
the Ioannina compromise is in no way an omen for the 1996 
intergovernmental conference, which is to prepare the EU for a 
future enlargement toward Central and East Europe.

<F P=106> [EC Document No DOC/IP/94/264: "Meeting of the G-24 </F>
Brussels Network on Macro-Financial Assistance to Bulgaria, 
Romania, and Albania"] 
  [Text] The Brussels network of the G-24 industrial 
countries, co-ordinating official financial assistance to 
Central and East Europe at a meeting, held in Brussels on 28 
March and chaired by the European Commission, made good progress 
in providing balance of payments assistance to Bulgaria and 
Romania complementary to financing provided by the IMF and the 
World Bank in the context of those countries' new macro-economic 
programmes to be supported by IMF stand-by arrangements. The 
group also reviewed the situation with respect to G-24 
macro-financial assistance in favour of Albania. 
  In view of the results of this meeting, Vice-president 
Christophersen indicated that the Commission will now submit to 
the Council of the European Union a proposal increasing the 
Union's balance of payments assistance to Bulgaria to up to 
ECU150 million. The vice-president also indicated that the 
Commission is ready to consider proposing further assistance for 
Romania and he urged the Romanian authorities to immediately 
complete the agreed prior actions. Mr. Christophersen finally 
confirmed that the Commission has now adopted a proposal for a 
new balance of payments grant of up to ECU35 million in favour 
of Albania. In the case of Bulgaria the G-24 noted with 
satisfaction that all the policy measures considered as prior 
actions by the IMF were now in place and that subject to 
adequate financing assurances from the EC/G-24, the stand-by 
arrangement will be considered by the IMF board on 11 April 
1994. The G-24 noted that some USD157 million committed by Japan 
and several EFTA countries under the previous G-24 assistance 
package will be disbursed in the coming weeks on the basis of 
the approval of the stand-by arrangement and the new Paris club 
rescheduling agreement that would follow. Furthermore, subject 
to final approval by the governments of the donor countries, the 
European Commission on behalf of the European Union and 
representatives from Japan, Austria, Switzerland, Sweden, 
Norway, Finland and the Netherlands indicated their intention to 
provide additional macro-financial assistance of up to 
approximately USD260 million in support of Bulgaria's 1994-95 
macro-economic programme. 
  These financing assurances were necessary for the executive 
board of the IMF to consider the new stand-by arrangement and a 
second drawing under the systemic transformation facility 
(overall some USD420 million during the programme period). 
Along with assistance from the IMF and the World Bank, the 
EC/G-24 complementary financing will facilitate Bulgaria's 
adjustment and reform efforts, will allow for the successful 
implementation of the debt and debt service reduction 
arrangement recently agreed between Bulgaria and its commercial 
creditors, and will alleviate part of the cost of the UN 
sanctions against Serbia and Montenegro, from which Bulgaria has 
considerably suffered. 
  In the case of Romania, the G-24 took note of the 
information 
provided by the IMF representative on the progress with respect 
to the implementation by the national authorities of the policy 
measures considered as prior actions for the new stand-by 
arrangement. The European Commission and several G-24 
representatives indicated their positive stance and their 
readiness to consider new macro-financial assistance in favour 
of Romania on the proviso that all the agreed prior actions 
required for the IMF programmes are promptly and fully 
implemented. The group agreed to hold a pledging session on 
Romania as soon as these actions are in place. 
  Concerning complementary balance of payments assistance to 
Albania, of which the principle was agreed at the G-24 high 
level meeting held in November 1993, the group noted with 
satisfaction that the performance under the enhanced structural 
adjustment facility (ESAF) arrangement agreed with the IMF on 
July 1993, was satisfactory and that the authorities were 
pursuing the agreed macro-economic policies with determination. 
The group examined the implementation, in terms of effective 
disbursements, of the 1992-93 G-24 assistance package and noted 
that some US28 million committed by Japan and several EFTA 
countries were expected to be disbursed shortly. Furthermore, 
the European Commission indicated its intention to propose 
further balance of payments assistance to Albania in the context 
of the 1993-94 assistance package and a number of 
representatives from EFTA countries also pledged to participate 
with additional financing. It was recognized that further 
commitments were necessary and that the group should meet again 
in the coming months for this purpose.

<F P=106> [EC Document No DOC/IP/94/261: "Signature in Brussels on </F>
Tuesday 29 March 1994 of the 1994-1995 PHARE indicative 
programme for the cooperation between the European Union and the 
Republic of Hungary"] 
  [Text] The 1994-95 indicative programme was signed today, 
29 March 1994, by Dr.Laszlo Bogar, state secretary, Ministry of 
International economic relations, on behalf of the government of 
the Republic of Hungary, and by Mr. Alan Mayhew, principal 
adviser, directorate general for external relations, on behalf 
of the European Commission. 
  Since 1990 Hungary has received substantial assistance (to 
the tune of ECU417 million) from the European Union to support 
its transition to a market economy and to promote civic society 
goals. 
  The indicative programme (IP) has been drawn up against the 
background of important developments, notably the signing of the 
Europe Agreement in December 1991, and its entering into force 
on 1 February 1994, the PHARE [Economic and Reconstruction Aid 
for Poland and Hungary] guidelines for 1993-97 approved by the 
EU member states in November 1992, and the conclusions of the 
European Council of June 1993 in Copenhagen. 
  For Hungary, the PHARE 93-97 guidelines and the conclusions 
of the EU council of Copenhagen, have had a number of 
implications which were already incorporated in the 1993-1994 
indicative programme, including: (a) a continuing strong 
emphasis on institutional development, and concentration of 
efforts on a limited number of core areas of activity; and (b) 
adapting the assistance framework to promote directly 
growth-oriented objectives by drawing on the range of PHARE 
instruments available, as well as through close donor 
coordination and (where appropriate) co-financing with external 
and domestic sources of finance. 
  In light of the government's priorities and taking into 
account the principles guiding the PHARE assistance, the 
following three main areas of assistance have been agreed by the 
government of Hungary and the European Commission: 
  (i) private sector development including financial sector 
reform, enterprise restructuring, investment and trade 
promotion, agricultural reform, sme development and regional 
development. 
  (ii) infrastructure development including development of 
transport infrastructure, improvements of border crossing, 
environment and energy. 
  (iii) human resources development including support to the 
TEMPUS programme and public administration reform. 
  In addition support will be provided for the implementation 
of the Europe Agreement.

<F P=106> [Philip Stephens article: "In Peril on Stormy Seas"] </F>
  [Text] The present storm may abate. Parliament's Easter 
recess offers Mr John Major the hope of a breathing space. But 
still blacker clouds have gathered already on the horizon. His 
premiership is in serious peril. If the ailment is chronic 
rather than acute, it is no less dangerous for that. 
  Mr. Major has been assailed before from the Tory 
backbenches: 
sterling, ejection from the European exchange rate mechanism, 
the row over coal industry closures, and the civil war over the 
Maastricht Treaty provide only a small sample of such occasions. 
  But this week it was different. The attacks came not from an 
embittered group of irreconcilable Eurosceptics. Nor were they 
confined to the Europhiles on the Tory left who have become 
increasingly agitated by Mr. Major's efforts to appease the 
right. This time it was the usually loyal centre described by 
one senior minister as the party's lumpen proletariat -- that 
deserted their leader. 
  The sullen silence in the Commons chamber when he announced 
the compromise over European Union voting rights offered far 
more eloquent testimony to the depth of his troubles than the 
public attacks on Mr. Major by the maverick Tory MP, Mr. Tony 
Marlow. 
  The word swirling around the bars and tearooms of 
Westminster 
was that Mr Major had lost the confidence of his party. 
Conservative MPs would no longer give him the benefit of the 
doubt. 
  Ironically it was not the substance of the deal with 
Britain's European partners that dismayed the government's 
supporters. Many Tory MPs hardly bothered to look at the 
details. 
  What was damning in the eyes of a demoralised and dejected 
party was the perception that Mr Major had caved in -- that a 
week after he had derided Mr. John Smith, the Labour leader, as 
the poodle of Brussels, he had assumed that very role himself. 
  It made no difference that those who follow European affairs 
knew in their hearts that, however strident Mr Major's rhetoric 
had been last week, he would be forced to cut a deal with his 
European partners. Britain, the champion of enlargement of the 
European Union, could not delay indefinitely the entry of 
Austria, Sweden, Norway and Finland. 
  Mr. Major,s decision to accept the deal had the backing of 
18 
of the cabinet's 22 members. Mr Douglas Hurd, the foreign 
secretary, would probably have resigned if the cabinet had 
rejected it. If that had happened, Mr Major would have had 
trouble surviving in office for the rest of this week. 
  But such awkward realities were overlooked on the 
backbenches. Instead the focus was on the four cabinet ministers 
Mr. Michael Howard, Mr. Michael Portillo, Mr. Peter Lilley and 
Mr. John Redwood -- who had urged him to hold out for further 
concessions. 
  This time many believed that, once he had staked out an 
uncompromising position, Mr. Major should have stuck on the side 
of the men he had once called the cabinet's "bastards." As one 
erstwhile supporter of the prime minister commented: "I don't 
give a damn about the technicalities. What I want, what the 
party wants, is some leadership." 
  The front pages of the Tory tabloids yesterday -- mocking 
the 
prime minister with a brutality usually reserved for leaders of 
the Labour party reinforced the message. 
  So the conventional wisdom among Conservative MPs is that it 
is no longer a question of if Mr Major will go, but merely one 
of when. 
  That judgment may well be wrong. It has been in the past. 
In such febrile times, the reflex at Westminster is to project 
the present into an indefinite future. Mr. Major is a more 
resilient man than he is given credit for. He has told friends 
that panic on the backbenches or "vilification" in the 
newspapers will not force him to fall on his sword. He will 
fight to stay in 10 Downing Street. 
  He has other advantages. For all Mr. Marlow's insistence 
that a leadership challenge will be mounted in the autumn, there 
is no obvious candidate on the Tory backbenches. Mr. Michael 
Heseltine and Mr. Kenneth Clarke, the principal contenders for 
the succession, cannot challenge him from within the government. 
  But elections loom. The local elections in May, five 
parliamentary by-elections and the European Parliament poll in 
June will provide the most important test of national opinion 
since the 1992 general election. The opposition parties intend 
to make them a referendum on Mr. Major's premiership. As one 
cabinet minister admitted, the debacle over voting rights has 
ensured that the background to the campaigns could not be worse. 
  If the Conservative defeats are as bad as the opinion polls 
predict, Mr Major's determination may not be enough to save him. 
More than one ministerial colleague has recalled recently that, 
only hours before she quit, Lady Thatcher declared her intention 
to fight to the bitter end. If Mr. Major lost the confidence of 
his cabinet, he too would be forced to resign. 
  The name of the 61-year-old Mr Heseltine, written off after 
his heart attack less than a year ago, is suddenly on everyone's 
lips. Encouraged by his Gaullist rhetoric, the Tory right has 
made the mistake of believing the president of the board of 
trade has ditched his fervent Europeanism. 
  Even those who swore they would never forgive him for 
toppling Lady Thatcher are beginning to view Mr. Heseltine in a 
different light. As one middle-ranking minister put it: "I 
would never trust him, but at least he would give us a fighting 
chance of winning the election." 
  Mr. Clarke's star has waned in recent weeks. 
His-less-than-adroit handling of the row with opposition 
parties over impending tax increases has removed some of the 
lustre. His robust attitude to Brussels has not persuaded the 
party's sceptics that he has joined the ranks of nationalists. 
But Mr. Clarke remains the champion of the mainstream Tory 
centre-left. If there is a contest, he will be a hard man to 
beat. 
  There is much more, though, to all this than Mr. Major's 
style of leadership. Those few Conservatives -- including a 
handful in the cabinet -- who are willing to think more deeply 
about the present crisis are gripped by foreboding. 
  The fault-line in the party over Europe is much deeper than 
many of them realised gven a year ago during the parliamentary 
battle over the Maastricht treaty. 
  The sceptics are not in the majority -- far from it. But 
there is now a destructive minority which clings to the belief 
that the past 30 years of Conservative history has been a 
disastrous aberration -- that the party should never have become 
the champion of the European cause. 
  They would be happy to see the government lose the next 
general election -- and then to be reborn in opposition as the 
party of nationalism, under the leadership of Mr. Portillo. It 
is a vainglorious dream. 
  Mr. Hurd demolished the argument in a speech last week, 
setting out in stark terms the economic and security realities 
binding Britain to a European future. But the Europhobes are

convictions. He too often confuses tactics with high principle.

the habit of loyalty. 
  But Europe looks once again like an anvil on which the 
modern 
Conservative party will break itself. Day by day it seems more 
likely that Mr. Major will be the first victim. He might yet

put serious money on his prospects. But in any event his 
departure would not solve his party's problems.
