  [Text] Goettingen (DPA) -- On Thursday afternoon [31 
March] about 150 members and sympathizers of the Goettingen 
"Solidarity Alliance for Kurdistan" tried in vain to block the 
Superhighway A 7 near Goettingen with bicycles. Police closed 
off the access points to the superhighway. 
  According to the police, among the demonstrators there were 
numerous autonomous persons, but only very few of the about 400 
Kurds living in Goettingen. Three Germans were temporarily 
detained. The action was to be aimed against German arms 
supplies to Turkey and the threatened deportation of Kurds. 
  Having played cat and mouse with the police for several 
hours, the demonstrators ended their attempts to get to the 
superhighway via industrial roads and slopes with a protest 
demonstration in front of the headquarters of the police task 
force in the evening.

  [Text] Bonn -- In the first quarter of 1994, the number of 
resettlers, most of whom come from Russia, has increased over 
the previous years. Speaking in Bonn on Friday [1 April], Horst 
Waffenschmidt, head of the Federal Government's agency for 
resettlers, said that during the first three months of 1994, 
49,254 resettlers have come to the FRG, 47,500 of whom are 
Germans from Russia. Over the same period of 1993, the total 
number was 44,703, while in the first quarter of 1992 it was 
47,702. 
  In March, authorities registered 16,495 resettlers, which 
was 
2,563 more than in February (13,932). Waffenschmidt emphasized, 
however, that the number of applicants wanting to resettle in 
Germany has gone down by more than 15,000 (from 72,293 in the 
first quarter of 1993 to 57,095 at the moment). Also, the 
number of people of German origin moving from Central Asia to 
German areas in western Siberia is higher than the number of 
people moving to Germany from there. In the former Soviet 
republics in Central Asia, there is "growing insecurity" among 
the Germans still living there, Waffenschmidt said.

<F P=106> ["Summary" of an interview with Alain Juppe, French minister </F>
of foreign affairs, by YOMIURI SHIMBUN's Shin Sato in Paris on 
28 March] 
  [Text] Paris, 28 Mar -- The following is a summary of 
remarks made by French Foreign Minister Juppe during an 
interview with YOMIURI SHIMBUN: 
<H5>  UN Security Council Reform </H5>
  Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa is scheduled to visit 
France 
in early May. We are also looking forward to a visit by His 
Majesty, the Emperor. 
  I would like to touch on the reform of the UN Security 
Council in particular, since this is also related to the 
political dialogue between Japan and France. As the 20th 
century draws to an end, the expansion of the UN Security 
Council has become imperative. We would also welcome a greater 
number of permanent members. I think granting both Germany and 
Japan permanent memberships would be the natural thing to do. 
We are not in favor of creating new permanent memberships under 
a new framework. It would be fine to have permanent members 
which possess all the rights and duties, and those which do not. 
<H5>  North Korea's Suspected Development of Nuclear Arms </H5>
  France is seriously concerned about the DPRK (North Korean) 
attitude of not respecting the International Atomic Energy 
Agency's (IAEA) official duties. This is a threat to regional 
stability and international security. IAEA should be able to 
inspect all nuclear facilities freely, regardless of whether 
they have been formally declared [by the DPRK]. We have stated 
this point many times. North Korea's attitude is unacceptable. 
If Pyongyang continues to refuse inspections, the UN Security 
Council has to place the issue of sanctions on its agenda. 
<H5>  Trade Issues </H5>
  The creation of the World Trade Organization must bring 
about 
a more impartial order in international trade. Japan has a 
significant role to play in the achievement of this goal. The 
important thing is to eliminate all basis for such customary 
practices as using weapons such as the "Super 301 Provision" to 
threaten a trading partner and draw unilateral concessions, or 
for the principle of might is right. At the same time, it would 
be desirable for Japan to clearly indicate its intention to open 
its market to various nations through resolute promotion of 
deregulation and market liberalization measures. 
<H5>  The European Union (EU) and Japan </H5>
  The monitoring quota for Japanese car exports to the EU is 
completely within the framework of GATT. EU also hopes for more 
procurement of auto parts from Japan. For this reason, we are 
watching with great interest negotiations between Japan and the 
United States in this sector. If Japan succumbs to threats and 
grants unilateral preferential treatment to U.S. companies, this 
will close Japan's door to European companies which are 
similarly highly competitive. That will be unacceptable for 
France. 
<H5>  Cooperation Between Japan and France </H5>
  Many issues need to be discussed in Tokyo. There are 
regional issues for which our two countries need to coordinate 
our actions, such as Indochina, Africa, and Algeria. There will 
be an international conference on AIDS in Yokohama this summer, 
and in Paris this fall. It might be good to consider joint 
action by France and Japan.

<F P=106> [Unattributed article: "Change Sought in Choice of </F>
Speakers"] 
  [Text] (ANSA) Rome, March 30 -- The long-standing practice 
of electing parliamentary speakers from opposition parties took 
a knock Wednesday [30 March] when the right-wing victors of 
recent elections said they would be aiming to put one of their 
own number in the speaker's chair. 
  The debate on electing speakers -- the first item on the 
agenda when the 12th legislature sits for the first time, April 
15 -- was sparked by rumours, later strongly denied, that Forza 
Italia and the National Alliance favoured centrist reformer 
[Pact for Italy leader] Mario Segni for the Lower House 
speaker's job. The rumour, said Forza Italia spokesman Antonio 
Tajani this evening, "is without any basis in fact." 
  National Alliance Secretary Gianfranco Fini, in joking mood, 
told journalists that "I would like to wait until the day after 
tomorrow before formally presenting Segni: then the Italian 
people will know it is an April Fool's trick." 
  Forza Italia chief Silvio Berlusconi, in an impromptu press 
conference this afternoon, agreed that "the concept will be of 
people from the majority parties," while Marco Taradash, the 
Pannella List-Reformers member considered close to Forza Italia, 
said "the speakers offices...must return to the governing 
parties." 
  For Francesco Speroni, the Senate whip for the Northern 
League, the opposition should not only be kept out of the 
speakers' chairs, but should not be allowed to head permanent 
parliamentary committees either. "As the League sees it, the 
winners get things now, and the losers will get things next time 
if they win," he explained.

<F P=106> [Unattributed article: "Right Seeks Premier as Left Asks </F>
What Went Wrong"] 
  [Text] (ANSA) Rome, March 30 -- Forza Italia and the 
Northern League made their first attempt to seek common ground 
for a governing coalition, Wednesday [30 March], but conflict 
over who will occupy the premier's office remains. 
  Forza Italia chief Silvio Berlusconi reiterated today that 
he 
feels he is the best person for the job, saying that the leader 
of the largest force in parliament should be given that 
privilege. The League, on the other hand, is throwing its 
weight behind its own Lower House whip Roberto Maroni. 
  While Left Democrat Secretariat member Franco Bassanini 
repeated his party's line that TV and publishing tycoon 
Berlusconi would have too many conflicts of interest were he to 
enter government, the name of former President Francesco Cossiga 
as a possible premier refused to lie down. 
  The controversial former head of state received a cold 
reception from League Senate whip Francesco Speroni who said 
"what an ugly name. Cossiga is really the oldest of the old," 
but in the neo-fascist National Alliance, the other major 
element of the Forza Italia-League right-wing Freedom Pole, the 
rejection was not quite so categorical. National Alliance chief 
Gianfranco Fini reminded journalists that Cossiga, a life 
senator, has decided to bow out of active politics, but "should 
he decide to return to the field, he could not, of course, play 
a minor role." 
  From outside the political world came what seemed to be 
encouragement for Berlusconi, with Fiat Chairman Gianni Agnelli 
saying that in older democracies "it is always the leader of the 
party which took most seats who heads the government." 
  Luigi Abete, head of the private employers' association 
CONFINDUSTRIA [General Confederation of Italian Industry], 
agreed: "These elections were one more step towards the 
modernisation of the country's political system, and the line-up 
which won on points has the right and duty to govern." 
  Some confusion has arisen, however, over just which party 
did 
take most seats: though Forza Italia and its close minor allies 
the Christian Democrat Centre took a total of 186 seats in the 
two houses, to the League's 176, by subtracting Christian 
Democrat Centre votes, Forza Italia's share stands at 142. 
  Whoever ends up governing, however, the unions today 
promised 
that they would not take a back seat. According to CGIL 
[Italian General Confederation of Labor] assistant secretary 
general Guglielmo Epifani, "we want to get the power of trade 
union confederations back into the game," pushing such topics as 
employment, pensions and the welfare state to the fore of the 
government's agenda. 
  While the right haggled to find a government programme and 
leader, the left tried to work out where the Progressive 
Alliance went wrong, and began looking to the future. 
  Isolated voices, such as that of Socialist Party Senate whip 
Fabrizio Cichitto, calling for the resignation of Left Democrat 
Party chief Achille Occhetto were countered by Left Democrat 
spokesman Claudio Petruccioli who said that "the issue of 
Occhetto's resignation did not even arise" in a party 
secretariat meeting today. Occhetto's Left Democrats were by 
far the largest element in the Progressive alliance, which took 
335 seats in the two houses. 
  Constitutional expert Augusto Barbera of the Left Democrats 
suggested that Occhetto stay put until he had succeeded in 
forging a Progressive Party, taking on board all the centre-left 
forces which joined in the Progressive alliance in the March 
27-28 vote, then step down to inject younger blood. 
  For Fausto Bertinotti, chief of the Communist Refoundation 
Party, a Progressive Party would be going too far, but regular 
consultations between the alliance members to decide on strategy 
in parliament will be necessary. Bertinotti came down strongly 
against a suggestion that the Progressive allies form a single 
parliamentary group. 
  From Sicily, Palermo's Mayor Leoluca Orlando of the 
anti-Mafia Network put the left's defeat down to a frantic but 
pointless search for unity on programmes: "The right certainly 
did not waste much time seeking unified proposals, and they took 
a larger percentage of votes in all kinds of social areas." 
  Outside Italy, the elections prompted a furious reaction 
from 
one Socialist EuroMP who will be trying to have those Italian 
Socialists who went with Berlusconi's Forza Italia thrown out of 
Strasbourg's left caucus. 
  A comment by Greece's minister for European Union affairs 
Theodhoros Pangalos, who talked in a TV interview of 
"Berlusconi's rabble" seizing power through "media magic," got 
diplomatic hackles up, and Italy's ambassador to Athens was 
dispatched by the Rome foreign ministry to tick Pangalos off. 
  Having dealt all day with the thorny issue of who should 
become premier, Silvio Berlusconi found himself faced with 
another leadership problem this evening when he went to watch 
the AC Milan soccer team, which he owns, play Anderlecht in a 
European Cup bout in Milan. 
  Should conflicts arise between his political role and that 
of 
chairman of Milan, Berlusconi is prepared to set aside his 
footballing hat, but in this case, finding an alternative will 
not be difficult: "Whatever happens," he told journalists, "I 
think I would hand the team over to someone from the family."

<F P=106> [Unattributed article: "Italian Institute for Financing </F>
Personal and Real Property Sees Resumption of Profitability"] 
  [Text] (ANSA) Rome, March 30 -- Italian company accounts 
for 1993 should show some resumption of profitability after the 
black year of 1992, according to analysts at the Istituto 
Mobiliare Italiano (IMI [Italian Institute for Financing 
Personal and Real Property]), the recently privatised corporate 
finance and merchant bank. 
  A report released by the bank's research division suggested 
today that, with stable inflation and exchange rates, costs and 
prices in the manufacturing sector should hold steady at this 
year's levels for the next couple of years. 
  The IMI study said that, in 1994-95, pre-tax operating 
results should come out at about 10 percent for 1994-95. The 
study also confirmed a forecast from ISCO [National Institute 
for the Study of the Economic Sitation], the short-term economic 
analysis unit, of an increase of about 1.3 percent in gross 
domestic product this year. 
  According to IMI, even though industrial activity closed 3 
percent down in 1993, this may turn out to have been 
underestimated by a number of other research units, which would 
put a number of the other projections out of line, making them 
too pessimistic. 
  The IMI study suggested that fixed investments had begun 
moving ahead "firmly" and output was increasing, also to rebuild 
stocks to the basic minimums. Other important factors were said 
to be continued fair weather on the trade account; stronger 
domestic demand, and further progressive reductions in interest 
rates. All this, said IMI, should enable firms to reduce their 
debt. 
  The study suggested that the biggest winners would be home 
appliances, paving tiles, plastic and rubber products, chemical 
products for retail sale and, profiting by strong foreign 
demand, machine tools and automation and numerical control 
equipment. 
  The sectors which IMI said had failed to profit by the 
lira's 
devaluation were steel, basic chemicals and fibres, vehicles and 
paper products. Car sales, in particular, could only be 
expected to pick up when family expenditure does, while the 
chemical industry has its old problems plus the world crisis in 
the sector to deal with.

<F P=106> ["I.C." report: "Spanish Advisers Believe That Cuban </F>
Economic Liberalization Proposal Does Not Go Far Enough"] 
  [Text] Madrid -- The ideas submitted by the Cuban leaders 
to their Spanish interlocutors for reviving their economy are 
rather stopgaps for a crisis and are far from being a 
comprehensive and rapid reform plan, leading to a market 
economy, according to administration sources. A Cuban 
delegation led by Carlos Lage -- the regime's number three -- 
has been in Madrid since Monday [28 March] in order, according 
to Prime Minister Felipe Gonzalez, to discuss "the measures 
which will serve to transform that system, liberalize the 
economy, and surmount the crisis situation." 
  State Finance Committee Chairman Lage is accompanied by 
State 
Council Vice President Jose Luis Rodriguez. Their main 
interlocutor in Madrid has been former Economy Minister Carlos 
Solchaga, who is supervising a team of experts comprising Bank 
of Spain officials and Argentaria executives, who are advising 
Cuba. 
  The two Cuban officials also met Tuesday with Gonzalez and 
with Economy Minister Pedro Solbes. Yesterday, they met in turn 
with Foreign Minister Javier Solana and with European Commission 
Vice President Manuel Marin, and, before returning to Havana, 
they have a meeting arranged today with Trade Minister Javier 
Gomez Navarro. 
  At a joint press conference with Kazakh President Nursultan 
Nazarbayev, Gonzalez did not analyze in detail the differences 
between the Cubans and their advisers on the path which the 
regime should take. However, he explained that the Spanish side 
"insists that the measures should be internally consistent." 
"They should not be disconnected from each other in such a way 
that the system is inconsistent." One of the Cubans' 
interlocutors specified that Lage, who is in effect Fidel 
Castro's prime minister, has not set himself overall economic 
aims steps to be taken accordingly, in accordance with a 
detailed timetable [sentence as published]. "They are tending to 
undertake uncoordinated initiatives in order to alleviate the 
situation," the same source added. 
  The new measures submitted by Lage to his hosts include, for 
instance, the introduction of taxation in a country devoid of 
taxes, and a greater opening up of the island to the outside 
world by facilitating air and telephone communications. 
According to Gonzalez, "greater freedom of movement outward and 
into the island itself" will be granted. He also wishes to 
encourage the setting up of small- and medium-sized enterprises. 
Some initial liberalizing measures were put into practice last 
summer. The liberalization process is being conducted very 
slowly. "On the Cuban side, they are trying to do this with the 
least social cost," Gonzalez explained. "They are concerned 
about the rate of the reform," he added. 
  The [Spanish] prime minister expressed once more yesterday 
his desire for the economic reform to bring about political 
change eventually. "A free economy calls for a society with a 
greater degree of freedom," he emphasized, although he 
acknowledged that there are exceptions such as Franco's Spain 
and, more recently, General Pinochet's Chile. 
  Nevertheless, he highlighted "signs of interest" on the part 
of the Cuban regime, such as the meeting which Robaina will hold 
in April with part of the moderate opposition. However, Lage 
did not announce any political change to his interlocutors. 
  For his part, Solana offered his services to the Cuban 
number 
three in order to inform U.S Secretary of State Warren 
Christopher of the economic changes which Cuba intends to set 
under way.

<F P=106> [Article signed "SM/AZ": "Disarmament Conference in Geneva </F>
Heads Toward Stopping All Nuclear Tests"] 
  [Text] Geneva 30 Mar (ATS) -- Nuclear tests have been 
partially prohibited since 1963. The Disarmament Conference 
devoted most of its winter session, which ended in Geneva on 
Wednesday [30 March], to drawing up a treaty that would prohibit 
all nuclear tests. The stage of declaring good intentions is 
now past, and a treaty could be ready within the next 12 to 18 
months, affirmed Mexican Ambassador Miguel Marin-Bosch. 
  Mr. Marin-Bosch, who is the chairman of the committee 
responsible for negotiating such an agreement reiterated that 
since the signature of the Treaty of Moscow in 1963 -- banning 
nuclear tests within the atmosphere, in extra-atmospheric space, 
and underwater -- more than 2,000 nuclear tests had been carried 
out by the United States and the former USSR. Both these 
countries, along with Great Britain, are signatories to the 
agreement on a partial stop to tests. 
  Mr. Marin-Bosch underlined that a treaty prohibiting all 
nuclear tests constituted a "very important" part of a universal 
regime aimed at nuclear non-proliferation. In particular, this 
regime involves negotiations on certain fissile materials, and 
an agreement protecting those countries which have no nuclear 
weapons. 
<H5>  Ratified by 160 Countries </H5>
  Some 160 countries have now ratified the treaty partially 
banning nuclear tests. Moreover, the United States and Russia 
have decided on a moratorium of their underground tests, 
prolonged until 1995. Great Britain is de facto applying the 
same rule. 
  For France, President Francois Mitterrand stated that his 
country would also observe a moratorium for as long as he 
remained president. China may shortly go ahead with a test in 
the atmosphere. However, when deciding on its moratorium, the 
United States probably estimated that fresh Chinese tests would 
not undermine their technological progress, asserted Mr. 
Marin-Bosch.

<F P=106> [Interview with Liberal Party leader Bengt Westerber by </F>
Ragnar Roos; place and date not given: "Farther and Farther 
Apart"] 
  [Text] The political signals from Liberal Party leader 
Bengt Westerberg during the past week make future government 
cooperation with the Social Democrats appear more and more 
realistic. However the question is whether the rest of the party 
will go along with him. 
  It is true that Westerberg says the main goal is a 
nonsocialist majority government. At the same time he rejects a 
continued four-party coalition government with support from the 
New Democracy Party. If the Social Democrats and the Left Party 
do not win a majority either, he wants to try a bloc-spanning 
government. 
  It is clear that Westerberg now feels there is less 
ideological distance to the Social Democrats than to the 
moderates. He designates the question of whether or not Sweden 
will uphold the welfare state as the most important ideological 
issue today. Now that he has stepped out as the champion of the 
current model of the welfare system there is almost no common 
ground for continuing to rule with the moderates during the next 
four years. 
  The situation was different at the time of the 
liberal-moderate program, "A New Start for Sweden," in the 
spring of 1991. There was no mass unemployment, no waiting 
period for benefits and no reduced compensation level for social 
insurance. Most of the program has now been implemented. And 
that marks the end of Westerberg's participation when it comes 
to cuts in the public sector. 
  It is different for the moderates. They want to keep going 
where Westerberg calls a halt. SVENSKA DAGBLADET's editor in 
chief, Mats Svegfors, has chosen him as the number one defender 
of the system, a more ardent proponent of today's welfare state 
than the Social Democrats themselves. 
  But the Moderates, the young conservatives and the Timbro 
intellectuals are not the only ones the Liberal Party leader is 
at odds with. He accuses practically the entire corps of Swedish 
economists of having a simplified view of taxes and the public 
sector. This means he is also attacking a number of liberal 
economists whose political home is in his own party. 
  In some respects Westerberg goes farther than right-wing 
Social Democrats. Among other things he thinks Sweden must 
safeguard a large public sector. The current size is good when 
it comes to activity and employment, but expansion is said to be 
impossible due to financing problems. He flatly dismisses the 
theory that a public sector as large as the one we have now 
hampers growth. 
  Westerberg also defends the general welfare policy and 
rejects any ideas about basic coverage. 
  But what about the runaway budget deficit? That will be 
cleared up if unemployment is cut in half and the government's 
reorganization program is implemented. According to Westerberg 
the OECD economists are quite wrong when they maintain that the 
savings goal must be doubled from 80 to 160 billion kronor to 
achieve stable economic growth. 
  Nor does the Liberal Party leader accept the economists' 
solution to mass unemployment--opening up low-paying jobs in the 
private service sector. He feels that if we maintain the public 
sector and concentrate on industries that are research- and 
development-intensive, a labor market B team will not be 
necessary. And, finally, he flatly rejects the domestic-servant 
deduction. 
  The current refrain may seem a long way from the early 
1980's 
when Westerberg launched the "Market Economy Alternative." He 
himself claims that he has had the same assessments all along. 
It is the debate that has changed and with it his emphasis on 
different aspects of social liberalism. 
  But at the moment his leftist-liberal side seems to have the 
upper hand. There is great affinity with the Social Democrats 
and the women associated with the Women's List with regard to 
the public sector, family policy ,and equality. With his present 
political course Westerberg should be able to appeal especially 
to employees in the public sector who are frustrated by the cuts 
in recent years. Westerberg stands up for a group that 
undoubtedly feels mistreated and tired of concepts like the 
"draining sector." 
  Two-thirds of all public employees are women. Westerberg's 
strong involvement in equality issues and his flirtation with 
the Women's List make the target orientation even more obvious. 
  However the question is whether the right wing of the 
Liberal 
Party will go along with him in a possible alliance with the 
Social Democrats. Leading "socialist eaters" like Anne Wibble 
and Birgit Friggebo have previously blocked such ventures. There 
is always a risk that ordinary nonsocialist voters will issue a 
harsh verdict. 
  With today's low poll figures, the Wibble-Friggebo wing can 
strengthen its position and once again change the party's course. 
<H5>  Westerberg: `Maria-Pia Close to Us' </H5>
  Bengt Westerberg is not giving an inch. Despite a sharp drop 
in the polls he maintains the line that he has now made the 
Liberal Party's: the public sector must not be trimmed, the big 
savings have already been made and he is open to cooperation 
with the Social Democrats. 
  He also praises Maria-Pia Boethius, the initiator of the 
Women's List. 
  [Roos] You have said there is no possibility that the 
Liberal 
Party will be part of a nonsocialist minority government again 
after the election. If the nonsocialists do not win a majority 
would you then recommend a Social Democratic-Liberal government? 
  [Westerberg] I think it is urgent that the present 
government 
remain in office, but it must win its own majority. If it does 
not achieve this and neither do the Social Democrats and the 
Left Party combined, I think a bloc-spanning government should 
be tried. But it is too early to say which parties should be 
included. 
  [Roos] You are said to have written the following in an 
internal memo dated 12 March 1990: "In my opinion the liberals 
are closer to the Social Democrats (than to the moderates) 
ideologically and programmatically, provided that the Social 
Democrats do not renew their socialist demands." Does that still 
apply? 
  [Westerberg] There must have been a longer train of 
reasoning 
behind that statement. But there is no doubt that the decisive 
difference between the Social Democrats and the liberals has 
been how we view the market economy. If the Social Democrats 
gradually abandon their demand for a planned economy... 
  [Roos] But haven't they already done so? 
  [Westerberg] Yes...then it would make cooperation easier in 
the future. 
  [Roos] Haven't you now moved quite a long way from the 
ideological tone that characterized the liberal-moderate 
program, "A New Start for Sweden," in the spring of 1991? 
  [Westerberg] No, as members of the government we have 
implemented most of what stood there. But the debate is somewhat 
different today. Now a lot of debaters have entered the arena 
demanding that we scale down the welfare state. I think the 
general welfare policy with the income loss principle and 
inexpensive social services for those who are in need is good. 
  [Roos] In other words, the public sector does not need 
further trimming. 
  [Westerberg] No, not as far as its activity and employment 
are concerned. In this respect we support a large public sector. 
Then of course we would like spending pressures to diminish, but 
they will when the economy improves and unemployment declines. 
  [Roos] Many economists maintain that the present size of the 
public sector and the accompanying tax burden hamper growth. You 
don't think so? 
  [Westerberg] No, the economists who say that it will provide 
more jobs if we shrink the public sector and replace it with 
private activity are wrong. I am more inclined to think that it 
will have the opposite effect, that there will be fewer jobs. 
Many economists have a simplified view of how the economy 
functions. They do not give enough consideration to the social 
effects. 
  [Roos] And you don't think it is necessary to open up 
low-paying jobs in the service sector? 
  [Westerberg] No, I think the economists are greatly 
influenced by the current situation in their analyses. I think 
they underestimate the dynamics once the economy gets going. 
  [Roos] Have the big structural savings already been made? 
  [Westerberg] Yes, but part of the reorganization program we 
approved remains to be implemented. 
  [Roos] And that will also be enough to overcome the budget 
deficit? 
  [Westerberg] The most important contribution will be to 
bring 
unemployment down. In combination with the budget-strengthening 
measures I think it will be enough. 
  [Roos] You have said that many of your basic assessments are 
very close to those of Maria-Pia Boethius. Is she a liberal 
politician? 
  [Westerberg] I will say that in many respects she stands 
very 
close to the Liberal Party, for example where equality is 
concerned. 
  [Roos] But what has become of the market liberal Westerberg 
of the early 1980's? 
  [Westerberg] My basic assessments are the same today as they 
were then. It is the debate that has changed. Then it was about 
wage-earner funds. Today it concerns whether or not we will 
uphold the welfare state.

  [Text] Athens, ROMPRES, 31/3/1994 -- President Ion 
Iliescu, now on a visit in Athens, had meetings on 30 March 
evening with numerous political, economic and banking 
authorities, in a bid to crystallize possible directions to 
follow in order to boost the relations between Romania and 
Greece. After a meeting of information with representatives of 
the Industrialists' Association and of the Chamber of Commerce 
and Industry, talks were conducted with Hellenic Foreign 
Minister Karolos Papoulias, with the defense minister G.Arsenis 
and other members of the Hellenic cabinet. Offers were made by 
either party as well as proposals. The evaluations are 
encouraging. President Ion Iliescu said in his toast proposed 
at the official dinner offered by Premier Papandreou that "for 
more than one millennium, the two peoples have lived through the 
same joys and misfortunes, in a region that has only rarely knew 
quiet, rather relative at that. The friendship between the two 
peoples is neither new nor changing. It has been built upon the 
community of historical past characterized by equal wish for 
freedom and equal sufferings for getting it. 
  ``Our political, economic, cultural-scientific relations and 
in other domains of mutual interest have recorded a positive 
evolution, beneficial to both peoples these last few years. 
  ``The talks conducted have singled out the two countries' 
potential to intensify the Romanian-Hellenic collaboration. I 
am thinking especially of the economy, where our collaboration 
resources are still not taken best advantage of. I am sure that 
during our visit and, in a few days, during the proceedings of 
the joint Government Commission in Athens, new ideas will be 
singled out as well as specific measures to expand the economic 
collaboration and intensify commercial exchanges. I think you 
will agree that the total volume of $153 million in 1993 -- 
which is the value of our commercial exchanges, is rather small. 
We think nothing prevents us from expecting a far bigger 
volum.'' 
  The president assessed as exquisite the collaboration 
between 
the two countries on a regional and international plane. 
  "This time too, I am emphasizing our satisfaction at the 
generous support given by the Greek friends to Romania in its 
efforts for integration in the Euro-Atlantic structures", the 
President said. "Greece has made an important contribution to 
the Romania-European Union Association agreement and to our 
country's admission to the Council of Europe. We are grateful 
to the Hellenic Parliament, that was the first to ratify the 
agreement of Romania's association with the European Union." 
  Referring to the very complex situation in the Balkans, the 
Romanian president singled out the Romanian-Hellenic joint 
preoccupations and efforts for the cause of peace, stability and 
cooperation. 
  "The political settlement of the Yugoslav crisis is our 
common desideratum," Iliescu said. "We think the same of the 
undeserved tragedy of the peoples in the area of the 
ex-Yugoslavia, and also the serious upsetting of the stability 
in the area and even of peace more generally. You too, just 
like us, have observed the economic embargo imposed on the 
federal Republic of Yugoslavia -- Serbia and Montenegro - for 
all tremendous costs our economies have incurred. But, in the 
spirit of equity, our countries have justly requested that the 
burden of the sanctions should be shared as equitably as 
possible. 
  ``Romania is also vitally interested in the development of a 
viable system of security in the continent, relying upon the 
institutions of European vocation that have proven their ability 
to ensure peace and quiet in Europe. We see the NATO decision 
on Partnership for Peace as an element of consolidating our 
security, equal security for all states in this part of the 
continent in the new conditions created by the changes come 
about in Central and East Europe.'' 
  Referring to the Balkan Region, President Iliescu noted the 
two countries' mutual wish that once the grave and complex 
issues faced by the countries there are settled, there should be 
a comeback to a normal situation allowing for broad regional 
cooperation, of course, not separately, but as part and parcel 
of the general processes of Euro-atlantic integration. 
  President Ion Iliescu hoped that the current top-level 
political dialogue would open a new page in the history of the 
excellent Romanian-Hellenic relations. "We are very confident 
in the future of the relations of friendship and collaboration 
between our countries."

  [Text] Sinn Fein president Gerry Adams today stepped up 
pressure on the British government to open talks with his party. 
  Welcoming the IRA's three-day Easter ceasefire, he insisted 
Sinn Fein had a right to be treated in the same way as Northern 
Ireland's other political parties. 
  At a news conference in Belfast, Mr Adams sat alongside 
leading Sinn Fein official Martin McGuinness and said the 
ceasefire was a move along the road towards a lasting peace. 
  Mr Adams said he had faxed the Prime Minister at No. 10 
asking him to "authorise direct talks with Sinn Fein." These 
should be in the context of "clarification -- not negotiation." 
But he said Mr. Major was under considerable political 
pressure, adding: "We know that he has problems within his own 
party but he should take time to reflect on how the situation 
can be moved forward. 
  ``The IRA's initiative creates an opportunity to break this 
stalemate which has been created by London's refusal to provide 
clarification for Sinn Fein in the same way as it has been 
provided to all other parties. There was now an opportunity to 
move on and enter into the next phase of the peace process. 
  ``Mr. Major should see this way to be flexible. To refuse to 
talk, to be exclusive, to try to marginalise any section of our 
people, may be safe but it will not bring lasting peace,'' Mr. 
Adams declared. 
  He shrugged off criticism that the ceasefire was a cynical 
public relations gesture, claiming that reaction was 
"predictable." But he stressed the vast majority of people in 
Ireland and Britain wanted peace and welcomed all advances in 
the peace process.

<F P=106> [Interview with Sinn Fein President Gerry Adams by Jon Snow; </F>
Adams in Belfast, Snow in London; from the "Channel Four News" 
program; Adams words spoken by an actor -- recorded] 
  [Text] [Snow] What was the minimum condition required to 
extend next week's 72-hour [IRA] cease-fire? 
  [Adams] Well, I don't think we should judge this in terms of 
the time frame involved. I think we need to see it in terms of 
the significance, in the potential, that it opens up. So 
therefore, in my view, the opportunity provided should best be 
utilized by the British Government dealing directly with Sinn 
Fein on terms, not of negotiation or even of other matters, but 
only in terms of clarification, and then all of the other 
potentials open up. The whole potential for demilitarization, 
because none of us are really interested in short stoppages by 
one known group -- I mean the Loyalists are going crazy here at 
the moment, the British Army is here in very large numbers. 
What we need to do is to get the whole process moved away 
beyond this stalemate, and that's the significance of this 
initiative, that it provides the potential to break the 
stalemate, to move us out of this critical phase of the peace 
process into a more productive phase. 
  [Snow] What do you say to Douglas Hurd who says this is a 
cynical exercise, your merely saying to people we're not going 
to kill you now, we'll start killing you next Friday? 
  [Adams] Well, I could say the same of Mr. Hurd. I mean Mr. 
Hurd's troops have been in my country for a very long time and 
the last time I met Mr. Hurd we discussed this matter, and 
unfortunately we're still stuck in the same situation. So what 
I want to do -- and remember the British Government wouldn't 
even be focused on this issue of Ireland if it wasn't for 
initiatives coming from Ireland itself -- so what I want to do 
is to utilize, to make the best of, to seize the potential to 
move forward, because we have to move forward sooner rather than 
later. 
  [Snow] Could you distill for me, very briefly, precisely 
what 
you want clarified? 
  [Adams] Three areas -- tactical matters and the declaration 
itself, conflicting interpretations of the declaration, and the 
processes envisaged in it; the three areas need clarification. 
  [Snow] How long would that clarification take? 
  [Adams] As long as it requires me or my colleagues to put to 
someone authorized by Mr. Major those questions, and for them to 
provide us with the answers. 
  [Adams] John Hume has said it could take an hour? 
  [Adams] Well, it may take even less than an hour, it might 
take more, but the point is that the clarifications are required 
and we wouldn't seek to protract. We don't want to see some 
public climb-down, or by the British Government. One of the 
ironies, one of the paradoxes of this situation is that all of 
this comes at a time when the British prime minister is in a 
weakened position, and you know, if I could turn an old, almost 
cliche on it's head, in this case it may be that Ireland's 
disadvantage could be England's or John Major's opportunity. So 
we seek simply to get this clarification issue behind us and to 
move into a new phase. 
  [Snow] Do the mechanics exist for the British Government, 
the 
Irish Government, to talk to you discreetly? 
  [Adams] Well, the Dublin Government has seen fit to quite 
rightly provide us with clarification, and that has been 
satisfactory, and I think they should be commended, and if the 
London government had the same position on 15 December we would 
now be far beyond the current critical stage. So the mechanisms 
certainly do exist.

  [Text] Britain has expelled a Russian diplomat in a 
tit-for-tat measure after a man accused of being an MI6 spy was 
asked to leave Moscow. The British diplomat, named by the 
Russians as John Scarlett, was reported to be head of MI6 in 
Moscow and was expelled last month. 
  The Foreign Office today confirmed expulsion of the Russian 
as a reciprocal move. The expulsions follow a television 
appearance in Russia by a man who claimed the British recruited 
him as a spy. 
  "We were asked by the Russians to withdraw a diplomat," an 
FO 
[Foreign Office] spokesman said. "We regret this demand, which 
is at odds with the bilateral relationship we are trying to 
build. In response, we asked the Russians to withdraw the 
diplomat from London. Neither diplomat has been declared 
persona non grata. We hope this is an end to the affair." 
  It follows recent damaging revelations that top CIA agent 
Aldrich Ames had been working for the Russians.

<F P=106> [By Charles Miller, PRESS ASSOCIATION defence correspondent] </F>
  [Text] Defence chiefs will next week begin the 
controversial decommissioning of the Royal Navy's brand new 
1-billion-pound fleet of Upholder submarines, the Press 
Association disclosed today. 
  The 2,400-ton HMS Unseen will officially leave naval service 
at a sad ceremony at Devonport on April 6 after just a few 
months of operational work. HMS Upholder will be 
decommissioned shortly afterwards and the other two vessels -- 
Ursula and Unicorn -- will follow later in the year. 
  There is widespread dismay in the Navy that swingeing 
defence 
cuts has forced admirals to part with the conventionally powered 
Upholders -- the most advanced submarines of their type in the 
world. But the boats, which were originally designed for Cold 
War operations in the Greenland/Iceland Gap, will be either 
sold, leased or put into storage. 
  A significant number of countries have expressed a keen 
interest in buying or leasing the submarines. They are 
understood to include India, Pakistan and Malaysia, which 
despite the current row over the arms for aid allegations still 
has a military requirement for submarines. 
  Saudi Arabia is also very interested as it is anxious to 
acquire underwater capability in the Gulf, because of Iran's 
decision to buy three Russian Kilo submarines that could 
threaten a third of the world's oil supplies. The Iranians are 
also building mini-submarines that could be used for 
terrorist-style attacks as part of a huge programme to rearm 
their war machine. The Upholders would be ideal for 
operations in the shallow waters of the Gulf, as naval experts 
agree that nuclear submarines are more suited to deep water. As 
the Upholders are highly sophisticated vessels, the Navy could 
provide most, if not all, of the 44-strong crew if a leasing 
plan is approved. 
  The move would be warmly welcomed by the Gulf states, such 
as 
Kuwait, Bahrain and the United Arab Emirates. It would have the 
knock-on benefit of releasing Royal Navy frigates and destroyers 
tied up on the Armilla Patrol, which was set up in 1980. There 
is already a precedent for British forces operating for a 
foreign power. An infantry battalion of Army Gurkhas is based 
in Brunei, with the costs paid for by the Sultan.

<F P=106> [Report by Ferdos Forudastan and Eckart Spoo: "Kanther </F>
Denies Plan for Kurds"] 
  [Text] Bonn/Hannover, 30 Mar -- The FRG Interior Ministry 
has denied that Minister Manfred Kanther (Christian Democratic 
Union) is considering an agreement with Turkey that would permit 
imprisoning deported Kurds in a special prison that would be 
made accessible to human rights organizations at regular 
intervals. Thus, Kanther's spokesman, Detlef Dauke, refuted a 
report by FRANKFURTER RUNDSCHAU on Wednesday [30 March]. Dauke 
stated that the interior minister has neither suggested special 
prisons nor does he have any plans of this kind. 
  However, Bonn government circles confirmed to FRANKFURTER 
RUNDSCHAU that Interior Ministry officials have introduced a 
corresponding proposal into the internal discussion about 
possibilities of deporting violent Kurds more quickly. The idea 
was also broached at a meeting of representatives of the 
Foreign, Justice, and Interior Ministries on Tuesday, where the 
Kurdish problem was discussed. It may be that the proposal did 
not come from Kanther himself. However, it remains a fact that 
the officials, who were assigned by the minister to the Kurdish 
problem, have, it was said, considered such an agreement with 
Turkey. 
  Kanther had demanded a general agreement with Ankara in 
which 
Turkey affirms that deported Kurds are not threatened with the 
death penalty. The aliens' law and international conventions 
ban deportations to a country where torture and the death 
penalty are actually threatening. Turkey is considered a state 
where imprisoned Kurds are regularly mistreated. 
  Heidemarie Wieczorek-Zeul, deputy chairwoman of the Social 
Democratic Party of Germany [SPD], demanded that if the Turkish 
military continues to act against the Kurdish People, the 
European Union (EU) should demand that civilian UN observers be 
sent to Turkey "to protect the lives of endangered people." In 
addition, the EU should "use all instruments of its foreign and 
foreign trade policy" to "prevent the further oppression of the 
Kurdish people in Turkey." 
  As members of the Executive Committee of the International 
Association for Human rights in Kurdistan, Lower Saxony's 
Justice Minister Heidi Alm-Merk and Hannover Mayor Herbert 
Schmalstieg (both SPD) demanded that a Kurdish conference be 
held on neutral territory, possibly in Norway. The goal must be 
to commit Ankara to the fact that the protection of minorities, 
which has been guaranteed by Turkey, also applies to the Kurds. 
The situation in Kurdistan endangers Europe, the Middle East, 
and NATO, the two politicians said. They criticized the course 
of the local elections in Turkey. "It is a farce to speak of 
free elections when in the southeast of the country candidates 
were prevented from running for the elections by formidable 
obstacles and violence," Schmalstieg said. By claiming in the 
election campaign that each vote for her party would mean a 
bullet against the Workers Party of Kurdistan, Prime Minister 
Tansu Ciller has not contributed to easing tensions. Schmalstieg 
rejected the mass deportation of Kurds.

  [Text] Nuremberg (DDP/ADN) -- German Foreign Minister Klaus 
Kinkel has voiced skepticism about the CDU/CSU [Christian 
Democratic Union/Christian Social Union] call for easier 
deportation to Turkey of Kurds who have committed offenses in 
Germany. I would advise "extreme caution" on the matter, Kinkel 
told journalists in Nuremberg today. There must be no 
deportation of Kurds threatened with human rights violations in 
Turkey. 
  In spite of his reservations, he is prepared to consider 
changes to legislation in cases where the right to hospitality 
has been abused, Kinkel added. Nor would he tire of urging the 
Turkish Government, "in the spirit of friendship," to prevent 
human rights violations in Turkey. The European Union and 
Germany should spell out to its NATO partner, Turkey, "what we 
expect of it." 
  Kinkel announced he wants to learn the truth about reports 
stating that German weapons are being used against the Kurds in 
Turkey. However, so far he has received no evidence of this 
despite intensive enquiries. If the reports are true, the 
German Government will "lodge massive diplomatic protests to the 
Turkish Government."

  [Excerpt] Nuremburg (DDP/ADN) -- During the six months of 
its EU presidency, which begins on 1 July, Germany will be 
making efforts, in particular, for the inclusion of the Central 
and East European countries in the European Union. This was 
stressed by German Foreign Minister Klaus Kinkel to journalists 
in Nuremburg today. Other goals were the enlargement of the EU 
with the admission of the Scandinavian countries and Austria by 
the deadline on 1 January 1995, and employment policy at 
European level. 
  Kinkel strongly criticized the policy on Europe pursued by 
Bavarian Prime Minister Edmund Stoiber. EU "defeatism" in 
Germany was particularly uncalled for in that there was no other 
country that was as dependent on Europe as the Federal Republic. 
The FDP [Free Democratic Party] would set itself up as a "party 
for Europe" in the forthcoming election campaigns. 
  Kinkel described the outcome of the elections in Italy as 
"worrying." However, developments concerning the formation of 
the government were still awaited. Germany and France have to 
have very great interest in a rapid emergence of a stable 
government in Italy. [passage omitted]

<F P=106> ["C. G."-initialled report: "Ability of European Union to </F>
Achieve Compromise Praised"] 
  [Text] Bonn, 30 Mar -- The Federal Government has 
expressed satisfaction about the fact that, following the 
compromise with Great Britain, the expansion of the European 
Union [EU] by Austria, Sweden, Finland, and Norway will become 
possible at the beginning of 1995, if the ratification 
procedures are concluded in time in the individual countries. 
Chancellor Kohl, who is on vacation in Austria, expressed 
relief. Foreign Minister Kinkel stressed that the only thing 
that is required now is the approval by the European Parliament. 
He hopes that the referendums in the would-be member countries 
will be positive. The accession of the four countries will 
enrich the European Union politically, economically, and 
culturally. Great Britain and Spain have committed themselves 
to the European Union at a "moment that is important for the 
European Union's survival." The European Union has proved its 
ability to achieve compromises and to make decisions. The larger 
the European Union becomes, the more difficult the procedure 
gets at voting. Nevertheless, Germany feels that it is the 
advocate of the states in Central and East Europe. Regarding 
the applications for membership by Poland and Hungary, Kinkel 
said: "These countries need to see light at the end of the 
tunnel." However, their inclusion will "proceed slowly." One 
has to "bring" the states of Central and East Europe "close" to 
the European Union "carefully." 
  In contrast to the government, Mr. Lamers, foreign policy 
spokesman of the Christian Democratic Union/Christian Social 
Union Bundestag group, expressed disappointment at the result of 
the negotiations on the blocking minority for decisions in the 
extended Council of Ministers. The British behavior 
demonstrates "a basic attitude toward European unification, 
which is incompatible with the goals of at least the European 
Union's founding members and lets bad things be expected also 
for practical decisionmaking in Brussels." It is not okay that 
London "on the one hand, rightly demanded the strengthening of 
the European Union's ability to act and, on the other, did 
precisely the opposite -- namely made the procedure more 
difficult." This cannot go on. Predictability and credibility 
of the British European policy must be doubted. The events show 
the difficulties that will have to be faced at the negotiations 
of the EU government conference in 1996 about a comprehensive 
institutional reform. The states, which want to proceed further 
in political cooperation, must not be hindered from doing so. 
  In order to prepare for the German EU Presidency, which 
begins on 1 July, Mrs. Wieczorek-Zeul, deputy chairwoman of the 
Social Democratic Party of Germany, advocated giving priority to 
combating unemployment and to the "implementation of a social 
Europe." The Federal Government must give up its "blocking 
attitude" toward the proposals of the EC Commission presented in 
its white book "Growth, Competitiveness, and Employment." As 
quickly as possible "Europol" is to be developed into an 
effectively functioning European police force, which can be used 
to combat border-crossing organized crime. Mrs. Wieczorek-Zeul 
said: "We want to put particular emphasis on combating 
right-wing extremist violent criminals and their border-crossing 
terrorist activities in European cooperation." The European 
Union must implement a foreign policy based on partnership: 
"Above all, the point is help for reconstruction in the 
destroyed former Yugoslavia." The Federal Government should 
work for common EU advances in implementing a "stability pact" 
with the countries in Central and East Europe. Bilateral 
neighborhood treaties are to be concluded between the countries 
involved, which guarantee protection for the respective 
minorities and affirm the recognition of the borders. The 
results should be included in the CSCE. The states in East and 
Central Europe should be able to participate in discussion about 
the common foreign and security policy: "They must be given an 
all-European prospect." During the German presidency, the 
public discussion of the EU reform planned for 1996 should begin.

  [Excerpt] Landshut, Germany, March 31 (AFP) -- Numerous 
Germans have lodged complaints of an inflammatory statement by 
the leader of the extreme right-wing Republikaner party, Franz 
Schoenhuber, the Landshut prosecutor's office said Thursday [31 
March]. 
  A senior official said they had received complaints from 
outraged private citizens "by the pound" and expected to receive 
more, after Schoenhuber's remarks about the president of the 
Council of Jews in Germany, Ignatz Bubis. 
  He said prosecutors were studying the possibility of legal 
action against the former Waffen-SS officer and member of the 
European Parliament, who Saturday accused Bubis of being "the 
worst inciter of race hatrid in Germany." [passage omitted]

<F P=106> [Golo Schmidt report: "The Rightist Scene Works `According </F>
to Plan'"] 
  [Text] Bonn -- Last year, the right-wing extremist scene 
further intensified its efforts to establish organizational 
links. 
  This is concluded by the Federal Office for the Protection 
of 
the Constitution (BfV) in its 1993 annual report, following an 
analysis of neo-Nazi and xenophobic riots. The report was 
handed over to the Interior Ministry in Bonn last week, which 
will, however, take time until the summer for "detailed 
coordination" and publication. 
  According to the report, the BfV noticed an increasing trend 
toward establishing networks in the right-wing extremist scene, 
which, however, is under way not so much between individual 
organizations but, above all, between individual persons from 
various groups. Corresponding beginnings were noticed in 1992 
for the first time. Indications of increased organization since 
then have also been given by the fact that several xenophobic 
attacks were "prepared according to plan." 
  The BfV has also noticed an expansion of structures among 
the 
"Anti-Antifa" [anti-antifascist], a right-wing extremist group 
against leftists. In the right-wing extremist scene, this has 
been accepted as a "promising approach for broader 
cooperation," it is said. 
  Regardless of this development, Interior Minister Manfred 
Kanther currently does not see any reason to ban any more 
right-wing extremist organizations, nor are any further orders 
to watch right-wing extremist parties in the offing at the 
moment. According to a spokesman, such steps are, however, 
"constantly examined." At the end of 1992, Rudolf Seiters, 
Kanther's predecessor, banned the right-wing extremist 
organizations "National front" (NF), "German Alternative" (DA), 
and "National Offensive" (NO). In mid-1993, Kanther applied for 
a ban of the "Liberia German Workers Party" (FAP). The Federal 
Constitutional Court has not yet discussed the matter. Because 
of the great number of pending proceedings, it cannot be ruled 
out that a decision will be made as late as 1995, it was said in 
Karlsruhe. 
  The BfV views such bans with mixed feelings. Such bans do 
make work more difficult for the affected organizations, but 
since substitute groups develop and the fascist grass roots hold 
their meeting in secret, observation is made more difficult for 
the BfV, stated the BfV. 
  The number of crimes with proved or suspected anti-Semitic 
background has tripled since 1990. According to preliminary 
information by the BfV, last year 577 of such crimes were 
registered, including 46 acts of violence committed against 
Jews. Three years before, the total of such crimes was 206. In 
1992, the record so far was reached with 620 crimes. 
  After the attack on the synagogue in Luebeck, security 
circles fear that this deed will be imitated by others. Experts 
point out that this phenomenon was observed after the xenophobic 
arson attacks in Moelln and Solingen. Yesterday, the 
investigating public prosecutor's office was not able to provide 
any more specified findings about the attack in Luebeck. Expert 
circles have meanwhile pointed out that the arson attack on the 
synagogue in Hamberg in 1960 was not clarified, either.

<F P=106> [Peter Scherer report: "Hesse Minister Demands Kurds </F>
Distance Themselves From PKK"] 
  [Text] Wiesbaden -- The Hesse Office for the Protection of 
the Constitution sees indications of actions aimed against the 
constitution among the Republikaner. This can be seen from the 
"Situation Report on Extremism" in Hesse, which was presented by 
Interior Minister Herbert Guenther (Social Democratic Party of 
Germany) yesterday. Despite assertions to the contrary, such 
indications are found both in programs and fliers of 
Schoenhuber's party as well as in statements by various 
functionaries. 
  According to the report, the number of right-wing extremist 
crimes rose to 972 last year, compared with 888 the year before. 
About 4,600 persons are organized in the right-wing extremist 
scene in Hesse. The efforts to link the various organizations 
with the help of the so-called Anti-Antifa Campaign 
[Anti-Antifascist Campaign] and to call for actions against the 
political opponents are watched with concern, Guenther said. 
  The minister noted that it is alarming that left-wing 
extremists are increasingly using violence against right-wing 
extremists. Of 151 violations of the law with left-wing 
extremist motives registered in Hesse, 87 were acts of violence 
against rightists. The concentration of such excesses after 
spectacular actions by right-wing extremists -- e.g. after the 
neo-Nazi march in Fulda -- shows "that an unacceptable form of 
lynch justice is being exercised here." 
  Concerning the Red Army Faction (RAF), Guenther noted: "Even 
after the latest announcements by the RAF, an end of the `armed 
struggle' is not in sight." 
  The minister called on the large number of Kurds, who live 
peacefully in Germany, to distance themselves from the banned 
PKK [Workers Party of Kurdistan]. Only 600 of the 40,000-50,000 
Kurds in Hesse are PKK members.

<F P=106> [Torsten Knoedler report: "Minister Rexrodt and the End of </F>
the Debate"] 
  [Text] Bonn -- After the heavy election defeat of the 
liberals in Lower Saxony, Honorary Chairman Hans-Dietrich 
Genscher claimed the floor in the Free Democratic Party [FDP] 
Presidium: Economics Minister Guenter Rexrodt does not show 
enough liberal profile, the FDP elder asserted. 
  FDP Chairman Klaus Kinkel does not completely agree either 
with the way in which Rexrodt is fulfilling his role: The man 
regards himself too much as a minister of the FRG Government and 
too little as an FDP politician, he said. 
  Bad words for Rexrodt come from the coalition partner. In 
Norbert Bluem's Labor Ministry it is stated: "A lightweight who 
does not work things out properly before he takes them to the 
outside." Behind his hand, a liberal party friend referred to 
the minister as follows: "A big mouth who does not get anything 
done." Rexrodt gives in too frequently to the chancellor and the 
Christian Democratic Union [CDU], it is stated in the FDP 
Presidium. 
  -- Pensions example: Rexrodt announced in the news magazine 
FOCUS in late 1993: "Pensions will definitely not be safe as of 
2010." The economics minister recommended increasing the 
working life span and thinking about the pension system 
structure. Kohl: "Pensions are taboo." End of debate. 
  -- Health policy example: In the paper "Securing the future 
of Germany as an economic location," Rexrodt demanded in August 
1993 that, in the future, patients pay for their medicine in 
pharmacies themselves. The money will be later refunded to them 
by the sick fund. Seehofer (Christian Social Union -- CSU) said 
no. End of debate. 
  -- Coal subsidies example: Rexrodt announced in October 
1993: "In the long run, we can no longer afford to spend 7 
billion German marks [DM] on German power production from German 
hard coal every year." After miner protests in the Ruhr area, 
Rexrodt gave in to the coalition round. Annual financial 
assistance of DM7 billion for the German mines from 1997 to 2000 
was resolved. End of debate. 
  -- Shop closing times example: The liberal economics 
minister said: "The law regulating the closing time of shops is 
deadwood." In addition to the FDP, CDU Secretary General Peter 
Hintze, segments of the CDU/CSU Bundestag Group, Defense 
Minister Volker Ruehe (CDU) supported him. However, Helmut Kohl 
rejected it and the retail trade and trade unions protested. 
End of debate. 
  -- The law governing discounts example: The economics 
minister put this basic element of liberal pricing on the 
Cabinet agenda. But Kohl simply removed it again. End of debate. 
  The criticism vented on Rexrodt finally even startled the 
party leadership. With a view to European elections in June, 
which are particularly problematic for the FDP, nobody wants to 
repeat the deliberately spread criticisms of the Presidium. 
  Yesterday the following was said in the Thomas Dehler House: 
"Rexrodt? He becomes better day by day!"

<F P=106> [Unattributed article: "Crane and Piano--Existential Anxiety </F>
Dominates the Liberals"] 
  [Text] Klaus Kinkel doubtless recognized the seriousness of 
the situation: the FDP [Free Democratic Party] is threatened 
with the bitter fate of possibly "no longer being needed," the 
chairman warned his people last week. But, he implored his party 
friends, "the conclusion is not that we should cry and run away." 
  Has the FDP reached its end? Will the Bundestag election on 
16 October also seal the fate of Helmut Kohl? 
  Since last Sunday [20 March], when the FDP with 4.4 percent 
of the votes in Lower Saxony failed to get over the 5-percent 
hurdle, the time of nervousness has begun for the Free Democrats 
as well as for the coalition. The liberals have become the 
greatest security risk for the chancellor. 
  The debacle at the very beginning of a series of elections 
and precisely in one of the most solid land associations heralds 
a continuing disaster. In the opinion of the Election Research 
Group in Mannheim, their forecast has been confirmed: the FDP 
does not have a secure voter base anywhere, neither in the 
laender nor at the national level. Dieter Roth from the Research 
Group: "It is in danger everywhere." 
  It is no longer represented in the parliament of Hamburg and 
Lower Saxony. It is threatened with a shameful result in the 
Europe elections in June and with extinction in Bavaria a few 
months later, according to the Research Group. Nationally the 
Mannheim pollsters put it at less than 5 percent. 
  The decline in the east is threatening. The FDP is still 
safely over the 5-percent mark in Saxony-Anhalt, where they will 
vote in June. There Hans-Dietrich Genscher from Halle brought 
his party to 19.7 percent in 1990 and the liberal Uwe-Bernd 
Luehr won an electoral district directly. 
  "That is only a sham boom," analyzes Roth. Just as the 
Union, 
the Free Democrats were among the winners from unification--good 
fortune that cannot be repeated. 
  The glance into the abyss makes the liberals shudder. 
Appeasers and dramatists are feuding with each other. They are 
looking for culprits and offering formulas. But they have not 
yet discovered the cure-all. 
  They are now arguing whether some flexibility in the care 
insurance was the cause of the dismal result. Was the strategy 
wrong not to issue a clear statement on the coalition and to 
wait until quite late to wink at the SPD [Social Democratic 
Party of Germany]? And what are the consequences for the 
alliance in Bonn? 
  They are all in agreement that the party lacks something 
unmistakable and that is a profile. What does the FDP stand for? 
At the present time, it is for slogans, for a few target groups, 
and, as always, for participation in power. 
  General Secretary Werner Hoyer dreams of the "fascination of 
freedom." He wants to rediscover a "liberal feel for life" in 
his party. At the same time, Minister of Justice Sabine 
Leutheusser-Schnarrenberger, who is seeking a liberal signature, 
is being hidden from the public--she could scare away 
conservative voters. 
  Former Minister of Justice Kinkel also extols his party as 
the "guardian of the rights of liberty." But he is worried 
enough to state that citizens are more fearful of criminals than 
of encroachment by the state. Liberty instead of populism--the 
Greens have taken over this role. Kinkel knows that it is "an 
ideal catch basin for the dissatisfied." "Industrial site 
Germany" is another catchword. What is meant, in the version of 
the FDP, is the concern for their mid-level clientele. 
  "The themes and target groups do not fit together," 
criticizes Irmgard Schwaetzer, minister for regional planning, 
housing, and city planning. And this omission is attributed 
above all to the minister for economics. 
  Old chairman Hans-Dietrich Genscher mounted a massive attack 
against Guenter Rexrodt in the presidium last week, saying that 
he was continually presenting proposals that soon afterwards 
disappeared in some drawer. He is bustling about in secondary 
theaters of war instead of serving the specific needs of his own 
clientele. Genscher called Rexrodt's idea of taking away tax 
privileges for carnival promoters and their associations an 
especially horrible example. 
  According to Genscher's tastes, Gerhard Schroeder, the 
election winner for the SPD, showed in an exemplary way how 
economic competence can be gained--a lesson for Rexrodt: sharpen 
themes for target groups, repeat them, and "make them more 
acceptable to hearts and minds." 
  But most of the blame for the party's dilemma is being 
assigned to Chairman Klaus Kinkel: he is too close to the Union 
and adapting rather than setting apart. 
  Whereas party chief Genscher understood very well how to 
link 
conflict, self-presentation, and independence of the FDP, his 
successor pays more attention to style, decency, and 
dependability. The result: the profile of the party is being 
blurred. "Peace in the coalition is no objective for the 
election campaign," criticizes Bonn FDP Chairman Guido 
Westerwelle. And when Kinkel warned against "unfaithfulness" in 
the executive board last week, Juergen Moellemann, the land 
chief of North Rhine-Westphalia, suggested that the term be 
"restricted to married life and not transferred to party life." 
Unfaithfulness might even be "expedient" in politics. 
  Moellemann, who as an "antipope" is waiting for his hour, is 
vehemently demanding what Kinkel wants to avoid: the FDP ought 
to separate itself from its partner and finally "run away." 
  But Moellemann's paper on "fundamental change" likewise 
contains only a collection of old proposals. His slogan is this: 
"Keep conflicts cooking." At times the FDP ought to act as 
though it is not even part of the government: "One must have 
chutzpa." 
  His advice: "Hit Kohl, Waigel, and Scharping between the 
horns every day." 
  The troublemaker fears that the FDP will go down together 
with the Union if it does not finally seek its distance: "More 
and more people see a need for reform that cannot be 
accomplished by this coalition." After the election, he 
threatens, "it is time for a general operation in any case." 
  Kinkel praises himself as someone who at critical moments 
"remains calmer and more composed than others"--pure 
self-conjuration. For the man who was once the great hope of the 
liberals is irritated and nervous. The election defeats are 
getting under his skin and Moellemann's continual intrigues are 
bothering him. 
  He angrily reviles the "know-it-alls" who pound the table 
hysterically and cry "separation, separation." According to 
Kinkel, it "does not agree with anyone" to leave for new shores 
when things are going downhill. 
  The successor learned the business of politics at Genscher's 
side but he did not learn his sovereignty. The then-party chief 
spent the largest part of a three-day party congress in Berlin 
in the hotel. He got out of bed only long enough to stand before 
the television cameras. But Kinkel, party friends complain, 
"allows every local chairman to invite him to a cookout." 
  The double office of party chairman and foreign minister is 
too much for him. He sometimes loses sight of the big picture in 
all that is going on between Norwegian fishing quotas, German 
negotiations on nursing care insurance, and municipal elections 
in Schleswig-Holstein. He reacts impulsively and 
undiplomatically, as in the negotiations in Brussels for the 
accession of Norway, where he is said to have threatened to 
break the back of the Spanish. Last week he formally called 
French Ambassador Francois Sheer to the Foreign Office. Kinkel 
made a German-French affair out of a couple of critical remarks 
of the diplomat. 
  His predecessor loved to let things take their course before 
he made a decision. He kept all the options open for himself. 
His trainee, on the other hand, "asks immediately where the 
piano is," complains a diplomat in the foreign ministry, "and 
does not look for the crane." 
  In the election of the federal president, Moellemann wants 
to 
give a demonstrative signal for the desertion with his vote for 
SPD candidate Johannes Rau. Such an option would we quite all 
right with Genscher as well: "There is still a lot there." So 
much independence goes too far for Kinkel. He hopes for a 
majority for the Roman Herzog, the candidate for the CDU 
[Christian Democratic Union]. His message is more of the same 
with Helmut Kohl. 
  Still, the successor is holding back with a statement in 
favor of the continuation of the coalition--a remnant of 
willfulness. "The more they talk about it, the less interested 
we are in making a decision," says General Secretary Hoyer. 
  In reality, the decision for the Union has already been 
made. 
"If there are enough votes, that is the key principle," says 
Irmgard Schwaetzer. And it is a banality. 
  The party chief believes there are. In the end, the voters 
will take the safe side and avoid any experiments. In comparison 
with the CDU-chancellor who is esteemed worldwide, the candidate 
from the SPD does not look good, in Kinkel's opinion. "The 
disenchantment effect is inevitable." 
  Kinkel does not think much of the Greens, a "democratic 
force 
that must be taken very seriously." They are "not able to solve 
practical problems." His conclusion: "too unreliable to 
participate in the government." 
  The chancellor sees the situation more realistically. The 
Greens no longer serve as a bugaboo, according to an adviser: 
"There is no miracle weapon, we must work with small change."

<F P=106> [Article by Juergen Leinemann: "`Afterwards, You're </F>
Bismarck'"] 
  [Text] When he comes, he usually is not seen. Then a 
folding door opens somewhere in the background of the hall, and 
in comes a group of tall gentlemen. With wary looks and strained 
movements, they shield a dynamic empty space in their midst, 
into which a respectful crowd, now standing, tries to stare from 
above: therein he--Wolfgang Schaeuble, 51--rolls toward his 
stage. 
  He smiles while he vigorously propels his vehicle forward. 
Immediately--recently in Wolfenbuettel just as everywhere 
else--an emotionally charged local matador of the Union will 
greet him as a man "who has done his duty for our German 
fatherland to the limits of human capacity." 
  Now many eyes are moist. A cool Schaeuble attentively 
observes the reactions. Only his right middle finger twitches 
rhythmically on his hands folded in front on his chin. 
  Must he not see himself as a "hero"? That is what Wolfgang 
Schaeuble asks Wolfgang Schaeuble in the friendly seclusion of 
his parliamentary group office in Bonn. Of course not; who is he 
after all? The "chief" has gained enough distance to laugh at 
himself. On the other hand, "I do not suffer from excessive 
modesty either." And as though he wanted to prove that, the 
ambitious man from Baden suddenly mentions the name of Bismarck 
in his subdued comtemplation of himself and his political role. 
  Since he cannot have meant that as he only could have meant 
it, he tries to touch it up: "One cannot want to be Bismarck," 
he says hastily. Then, for an interval of silence, the gaze of 
the man who is so proud of the unification that he negotiated is 
reflected inward. "Only afterwards are you Bismarck," he nods. 
  It was not just a painful subject that Wolfgang Schaeuble 
had 
stumbled into but an uncomfortable one as well. After all, he 
would first have to become chancellor if the comparison is to 
make any sense. But the "crown prince" of the incumbent does not 
want to talk about that in the 1994 election year. He certainly 
knows that the "rascals" in the press and opposition are just 
waiting to put him up against Helmut Kohl. 
  But that attempt does not work with Schaeuble and "for 
heaven's sake" it must not be successful. They should all go 
ahead and make fun of him as the chancellor's "paladin" or 
"puppet." "We have no need for debate and are not interested." 
  Party friends believe that it is quite possible that 
sometime 
in the last year Wolfgang Schaeuble, who is always aiming for 
success and measurable results, has toyed with the idea of an 
early replacement of Helmut Kohl. In the coming series of 
elections, however, he will give his full support to Helmut Kohl 
without, of course, backing away from his own ambitions. 
  The chief of the parliamentary group has accepted the fact 
that he can come to the chancellorship only through Helmut Kohl 
and not against him. So in the past days he has been making 
himself scarce in Bonn--although he finds the election losses of 
the CDU [Christian Democratic Union] bearable in the scope of 
the relative situation--so that he will not have to talk about 
the chancellor's uncertain future. This week, however, he is all 
the more present: in Washington. Chancellor candidate Schaeuble 
is presenting himself on a goodwill tour just as Rudolf 
Scharping, chief of the SPD [Social Democratic Party of 
Germany], will do in three weeks. 
  A Bismarck in a wheelchair? American experts on Germany such 
as the historian and former Secretary of State Henry Kissinger, 
remembering their lame President Franklin D. Roosevelt, will 
certainly be less offended by his physical handicap than by his 
Bismarck-attitude. 
  Is it not true that of late Schaeuble has been awakening a 
lot of memories of the clanking mixture of national braggadocio 
and feverish promoterism with which the Germans triumphed 
internationally after Bismarck founded the empire? "We Germans," 
"our nation," "our German fatherland," the "protective community 
of fate Germany," their soul, their set of values, and their 
code of duties--who in the last decades would have dared to be 
as provocative in Bonn with strong words of German nationalism 
as the slight man from the Black Forest? 
  Wolfgang Schaeuble finds the charge that he has changed from 
a pragmatic political manager into a nationalistic ideologue 
"very amusing." And is he not really more of a chatty speaker 
than an emotional declarative orator ? "There is nothing at all 
martial or theatrical about me." 
  When Schaeuble wants to use such self-descriptions to deny 
similarities with Franz Josef Strauss, one cannot contradict 
him. But not just Hans-Ulrich Klose, the chief of the 
parliamentary group of the SPD, knows that the SPD delegates in 
the Bundestag react to him downright "allergically 
aggressively." Wolfgang Schaeuble knows that too. And that is 
exactly the way he wants it. 
  At the same time, the cool negotiation talents of the jurist 
Schaeuble are still undisputed even today. Even in politically 
explosive negotiations such as on the asylum law or nursing care 
insurance, compromise-manager Schaeuble is impressive through 
his nimbleness and competence. He relaxes the atmosphere with 
irony and sportsmanship and one can count on his agreements, 
laud social democrats and liberals. 
  Schaeuble had long since gained a solid reputation in this 
area in Bonn when he was abruptly and brutally pushed into the 
lamplight of the broad public. First the sudden unification and 
then the assassination attempt turned the managing helper, who 
was pulling the strings for Kohl behind the scenes, into a 
responsible leader. Unhappily since then he has been obsessed 
with the idea of wanting to improve the political and 
atmospheric state of the lurching republic. 
  "Politics is always a matter of balance between individual 
freedom and a relationship with the community," he lectures from 
behind his desk in Bonn, a portrait of Konrad Adenauer to his 
side. "The trend is now tending more toward an unraveling and 
splitting of the community." And as he learned in his youth in 
the cold-war state of the "old man," he is insisting on the 
melding force of enemy images. 
  "Only in conflict does it become clear what one stands for 
or 
against." That is Wolfgang Schaeuble's conviction. Thus, for 
example, he stands for Berlin and adds something to that: "It is 
a matter of Germany." And then he waits to see who howls. That 
will be the enemy against whom the people must unite. 
  Is that really the "conservative revolution" that 
Schaeuble's 
leftist party friend Warnfried Dettling sees coming as Helmut 
Kohl's legacy? Will this "turn back the clocks of modernity in 
Germany," as the sociologist Ulrich Beck fears? Is Wolfgang 
Schaeuble thereby initiating the downfall of the Union as a 
people's party? 
  Actually the chief of the parliamentary group has entered 
into a "very fruitful and sensible division of labor" with the 
chancellor, which is happening without any need to talk a lot 
about it. The game is called: We against them. "Freedom instead 
of socialism" was the classical agitation formula, which since 
the disintegration of Moscow's camp does not serve so well to 
mobilize fears, however. 
  So "we"--that is, as Helmut Kohl likes to say, "all Germans 
of goodwill"--need other emotional signals of community to be 
forearmed against "the others." "History," "the nation," and 
"the fatherland" must be reflected in suitable symbols. 
  This may not be difficult for Helmut Kohl, the emotional 
stager of Verdun and Bitburg. The chancellor, who knows very 
well how to condense politics from the fund of this own 
sentimentalities into kitschy highpoints, has a rather 
dependable feel for the radiant energy of symbols. 
  But Schaeuable, the cold man of the intellect who sees 
emotions only as an exploitable weakness of his fellow man "that 
must not be left to the enemy," was completely unable to pull 
off such productions. Even his own people are disturbed by the 
strange mixture of national pomposity and academic lecturing 
with which the chief of their group in the Bonn parliament 
attacks the veiling action of the artist Christo in that he 
stylizes the unfortunate Berlin Reichstag into the "most 
symbolic and significant political building in Germany." 
  It has been clear since this speech that Wolfgang Schaeuble 
is incapable of establishing a following. To be sure, he manages 
his own parliamentary group with sharp and bitter parsimony and 
is always well prepared but generally curt. His associates find 
him rude and arrogant. Words like "rubbish" and "nonsense" are 
quick to come across his lips. His delegates live in the fear 
that "as soon as someone babbles something without thinking, it 
will quickly become icy." 
  When the Union leader is nevertheless able to produce a "we" 
feeling--as at the party congress of the CDU in 1993, for 
example--it is the result of a calculated confrontation with 
self-produced enemies. "Nothing is worse than peace with the 
socialists," Union parliamentarians have quoted their chairman. 
Polarization is the strategy that Schaeuble himself affirms with 
obvious pleasure. "There must be conflict for it to be 
interesting." 
  But the combative Schaeuble is also becoming dreadful for 
many in his environs--and not just among his adversaries. 
Concern and even fear are slipping into many respectful 
statements about the lonesome politician, who is able to defend 
himself so vehemently against the fate that befell him. A zone 
of icy thin air seems to keep people at a distance as soon as 
the chief of the parliamentary group comes to larger gatherings. 
  Is that just because of the wheelchair? Is it the security 
zone around the especially intensively protected man that 
frightens people away? Certainly. But above all there is around 
Wolfgang Schaeuble an electrically charged atmosphere of 
aggressiveness and controlled rage, which can be discharged at 
any time in a way that can cut to the bone. 
  Wolfgang Schaeuble knows that. "Somehow I seem to be sharp," 
he admits not at all troubled. On the contrary, it almost seems 
as though the fear that he provokes when he speaks, the 
powerless agitation that his gibes produce in his opponents, 
gives him a pleasurable sensation. The only thing that makes him 
angry is the charge that the wheelchair has made him hard, for 
which he will never forgive Jochen Vogel, the former chairman of 
the parliamentary group of the SPD. 
  The fact is that the physically small but competitive and 
athletic Wolfgang Schaeuble charged through the political world 
in Bonn from the first day of his career like a taut bow. "One 
had to expect arrows at any moment," says an opposition 
politician who remembers the former parliamentary business 
manager of the Union. 
  What may have been a sport then is now a vital struggle. The 
man whose existence has been narrowed almost completely to 
politics literally has no more latitude. For him it is always a 
matter of everything or nothing. Everyone senses that and many 
are frightened by it--especially since the content and maxims 
that are behind all of Schaeuble's actions are rather arbitrary 
within a vague conservative framework. "Just no mental blocks," 
he says. 
  Afterwards phases of insightful contemplation and frank 
dealing with his own vulnerability and the wounds of others have 
obviously appeared to Wolfgang Schaeuble to be weaknesses that 
he cannot afford in the tough business of politics. When he 
became chief of the Federal Chancellorship in 1984, minister 
with a "special responsibility," he was "somehow terrified" by 
the burden, he says. "I no longer get frightened. I am now 
hardened." 
  This is supposed to sound casual and self-ironic. But the 
steel core of his will to power shines through such jokes. His 
public speeches are weapons that he uses with provocative 
self-righteousness. Schaeublich always makes it clear--sometimes 
with tremulous pathos and sometimes with quiet pungency--that he 
thinks he has the whole truth. He is democracy. He is wisdom. He 
is Germany. 
  Thus he increasingly turned his speeches in parliament into 
a 
series of verbal duels with the opposition and then he 
complained sorrowfully about the many disruptions. He makes hard 
statements with a soft voice. He stirs up in his listeners the 
feelings that he does not permit himself to have. 
  The fact that he gets people stirred up makes Wolfgang 
Schaeuble dangerous. The fear of his patriotic bombast seems 
justified precisely because he is no devout German nationalist 
but at most a conventional gentleman. "He is absolutely unaware 
of the danger from the Right," believes one of his friends and 
admirers. 
  Possibly, as he asserts, the CDU-politician really thinks 
that in this way he can keep in check the rightist tendencies in 
his own camp. Possibly he actually does want to move the Union 
to the right to recapture the Republikaner. In any case, he has 
faith in the restraining force of the will over collective 
desires, fears, and feelings of hatred, which would be reckless 
in any democracy. It is perilous in Germany. 
  But moodmaker Wolfgang Schaeuble has no antenna for this 
explosiveness. If necessary, he is nonchalantly able to 
reinterpret his popular campaign for patriotism into a purely 
sportive affair. In a national match against France, does he as 
a constitutional patriot cheer for the Germans? So it is. 
  Whenever Wolfgang Schaeuble is tempted to consider himself 
rather marvelous--and that is not so infrequent--he remembers 
the film with the late Don Camillo, who as a zealous earthly 
warrior against communism had to be told by his Lord God: "Don't 
take yourself so seriously." 
  Wolfgang Schaeuble knows that that is advisable not only for 
reasons of humility but above all for tactical reasons, for vain 
appearances of a chancellor rival would be the last thing that 
the Union could use in its fight for the vanishing power on the 
Rhine. 
  This was the only reason why Schaeuble, a celebrated hero at 
the Berlin party congress, gave such a plain speech in Hamburg. 
And he cannot say often enough that Helmut Kohl is federal 
chancellor and will be once again. To emphasize that, he adds: 
"Our good God will take care of the rest." 
  But the strange thing is that this statement of submission 
sounds almost like a threat in the mouth of Schaeuble, whose 
life has unmercifully suffered ups and downs in recent years.

<F P=106> [Interview with Gerhard Schroeder, minister-president of </F>
Lower Saxony, by Olaf Petersen and Klaus Wirtgen: "`Take a 
Chance'--the SPD's Lower Saxony Election Winner on His Party's 
Strategy in Bonn"] 
  [Text] [DER SPIEGEL] Mr. Schroeder, have you already 
thanked your chairman Rudolf Scharping for the fact that he has 
improved the attitude toward the SPD [Social Democratic Party of 
Germany] throughout the nation and that you can continue to 
govern in Lower Saxony with the absolute majority of seats? 
  [Schroeder] I have done that several times and even 
effusively for me. 
  [DER SPIEGEL] Do you share our impression that your election 
victory was not exactly celebrated enthusiastically by the 
national SPD? 
  [Schroeder] They are all very businesslike people. They are 
incapable of enthusiasm, because in the past there was hardly 
any reason for it. Something like that has to be relearned. 
  [DER SPIEGEL] The party chairman warned his friends against 
holding their noses so high that it rains in. Was that aimed at 
you? 
  [Schroeder] No, there is no danger of that with me. I can 
say 
in all modesty that people will be able to judge the political 
implications of our election result correctly only when they can 
look back six months. 
  In Hamburg, the SPD lost almost 8 percentage points. We 
actually gained a little and won the absolute majority of seats. 
That must be repeated in the coming elections. All SPD 
representatives have direct electoral districts. We did not have 
that before here. 
  [DER SPIEGEL] In the party headquarters in Bonn, your 
comrades were not at all happy with the fact that in the final 
phase of the election campaign you suddenly issued the catchword 
"absolute majority." 
  [Schroeder] That is what I heard too. 
  [DER SPIEGEL] They were for red-green not just in Lower 
Saxony. In the contest for the party chairmanship, you 
recommended this alliance as a model for Bonn as well. 
  [Schroeder] In the first place: coalitions are always 
second-best solutions. When a party like the SPD that can gain a 
majority of its own--and mine was within reach according to the 
polls--does not formulate this ambitious goal, it gives up a 
piece of itself. 
  In the second place: at the time of the membership polling, 
I 
said that anyone who wants to do something in Bonn must specify 
a power-transfer alternative to the current coalition. Mine is 
red-green and I stand by that. The party decided against me and 
against my strategy. And now it must be done by the one who was 
chosen by the party. 
  [DER SPIEGEL] Scharping must finally say how he wants to 
come 
to power? 
  [Schroeder] I will not give Rudolf Scharping any public 
advice on his strategy to come to power. I was annoyed by 
recommendations and by the statement from the federal business 
manager Guenter Verheugen that it was dumb of me to strive for 
the absolute majority. 
  [DER SPIEGEL] If you had failed to reach your election goal, 
the chancellor candidate would also have suffered. 
  [Schroeder] One cannot abandon an achievable goal out of 
fear 
of failure. The trouble with politics is that very few are still 
willing to take a risk. 
  [DER SPIEGEL] When Johannes Rau propagated his "own 
majority" 
in 1986, you were among the critics of his strategy. 
  [Schroeder] The election goal must be achievable and it must 
remain realistic. 
  [DER SPIEGEL] Do you consider it realistic that the SPD 
wants 
to postpone the question of a coalition in Bonn until after the 
election? 
  [Schroeder] Whether that can be done depends on at least two 
preconditions. The first is the discipline of the party 
leadership, which must not force a debate on the chairman. And 
the second is whether people like you, that is, the media, will 
permit such a strategy. I cannot judge either one. 
  [DER SPIEGEL] But you are familiar with both circles. 
  [Schroeder] I have read that three Bundestag representatives 
have publicly advised Rudolf Scharping to bet on red-green. It 
would have been better for these honorable people to have done 
this internally. But once a member of the party leadership 
starts such a debate, Rudolf Scharping would have a problem. I 
do not want to give him one. 
  [DER SPIEGEL] What has now changed about your assessment of 
a 
red-green coalition? 
  [Schroeder] For me personnaly only one thing has changed, 
namely that Rudolf Scharping is party chairman and chancellor 
candidate and not I. For this reason, he alone has the right to 
set the strategy publicly. 
  [DER SPIEGEL] The SPD received only 33.5 percent in the 1990 
election and gives the impression that it could come to power 
through its own strength. Is this credible? 
  [Schroeder] Even if you dig through the cellar, you will get 
nothing from me. It is a matter of the strategic orientation of 
the candidate and his specific credibility. And if he is not 
allowed to do what he has conceived, then he cannot fight the 
way that someone must fight who wants to remove Kohl from his 
chair. He is literally heavy in his armchair. 
  [DER SPIEGEL] Are you not afraid that sometime you might be 
accused of failing to help Scharping? 
  [Schroeder] That is a theme that is relevant in criminal law 
but it plays no role in politics. Moreover you are 
underestimating the strategic mental capacity and the 
intelligence of the party chairman if you think that he himself 
would not do what is necessary at the right time. If it were 
otherwise, he would not have won against me. 
  [DER SPIEGEL] In Lower Saxony, you began as a reform 
government with the Greens four years ago. Is red-green at all 
attractive at the national level if they are really just seeking 
crisis management there? 
  [Schroeder] It is a mistake to believe that crisis 
management 
per se must have nothing to do with reform policy. Crisis 
management relates, after all, to the overcoming of the economic 
crisis. And besides the conventional instruments there are 
always those that go farther. We in Lower Saxony never forgot 
the ecological dimension in large projects of industrial 
policy--I admit that from time to time I personnally had to put 
them through against the Greens. It is still that way in the new 
SPD government as well. 
  [DER SPIEGEL] You reject the speed limit that was originally 
included in the first SPD draft for a government program. That 
will certainly not be interpreted in your favor as an ecological 
accomplishment. 
  [Schroeder] That is right. But for me reform policy does not 
mean that one constantly drives old horses through the arena. I 
am against a general speed limit. Where a speed limit is 
necessary, we do that in Lower Saxony as well. Besides, 
Scharping sees that the same as I do. 
  [DER SPIEGEL] You also oppose a further increase in the 
mineral oil tax? 
  [Scharping] If driving a car in this country becomes 
something that only the upper half or even the upper third of 
the income pyramid can afford, then something is wrong. 
Certainly the mineral oil tax has an ecological dimension but it 
also has a social dimension. In an extensive land, one can never 
organize the local public transportation of passengers so well 
that the worker in eastern Friesland who drives 80 km or more to 
Volkswagen in Emden can get along without his car. 
  This consideration of the broad strata of the working 
population in plants and management has brought about our 
election success--naturally along with the first-class national 
policies of the SPD.... 
  [DER SPIEGEL] ...that wants to increase the mineral oil tax. 
  [Schroeder] It was increased by just 16 pfennig. We cannot 
go 
any higher. Besides the mineral oil tax, the contributions for 
health insurance and for retirement have also increased, the 
value-added tax has been raised, the municipal taxes and rents 
are rising, and we are imposing a supplementary levy instead of 
the social surcharge. How can the people bear it? And then we 
come along and tell them that our reform policies are adding 
something to that. That cannot go well. 
  [DER SPIEGEL] It was relatively simple for you to push for 
jobs in the election campaign: you left the ecological part to 
the Greens. Is such a double strategy also suitable for the 
election campaign for power in Bonn? 
  [Schroeder] I am not giving any recommendations for 
Scharping's strategy in this respect. The SPD must not forget 
the ecological dimension. I know that is difficult. Once in 
power, the SPD itself must come up with a rational concept for 
coordinating economy and ecology. 
  [DER SPIEGEL] What benefit can the opposition leaders in the 
Bundestag or the chancellor candidate derive from the successful 
formula of the Lower Saxon minister-president? 
  [Schroeder] This is the reason why it is sensible for an 
acting minister-president to be chancellor candidate. He can 
show competence and a capacity to act at the land level for a 
sector of politics. He will say: now I want to do on a large 
scale what I have already done on a small scale. He has the task 
of taking the ideas from the laender and putting them into 
effect credibly as our concept at the national level and to 
expand it beyond himself and Lafontaine. 
  [DER SPIEGEL] You are a public symbol of a successful 
red-green policy. In reality, you achieved your election victory 
with a policy that could have come from a trade union chairman 
in Lower Saxony. 
  [Schroeder] You are right as far as industrial policy is 
concerned but you are wrong with respect to ecology. 
  [DER SPIEGEL] The Greens have taken care of that. 
  [Schroeder] We had our part in it too. Nothing could have 
been done against us. But it is quite clear that the Greens have 
had a major role in setting the ecological questions. 
  [DER SPIEGEL] The conservative FRANKFURTER ALLGEMEINE writes 
that Lower Saxony red-green has "truly lost all of its terror." 
Nevertheless Chancellor Kohl is continuing to foment fear of 
this combination. 
  [Schroeder] He will fail, because, in the first place, 
Rudolf 
Scharping and the SPD--we are once again in the midst of a 
coalition debate--will not let themselves be tied to this 
coalition.... 
  [DER SPIEGEL] ...because they will not follow you.... 
  [Schroeder] ...and second, because this question does not 
frighten anyone anymore. 
  [DER SPIEGEL] The radical resolutions of the Greens on 
withdrawal from NATO, the Bundeswehr, and nuclear energy ought 
to suit the plans of the chancellor candidate: in this way, the 
Greens graze on the left fringe and the SPD can become indignant 
and take some votes away from the Union. After 16 October, the 
votes will be counted together. 
  [Schroeder] I do not want to put myself in Scharping's role 
out of respect for the party chairman's prerogative to make 
decisions. 
  [DER SPIEGEL] You are not otherwise averse to mental games. 
  [Schroeder] That is true but this mental game is especially 
dangerous, not so much for me as for Rudolf Scharping and the 
SPD. If it were dangerous for me, it would have an appeal, even 
a different appeal than just to think about it. But one cannot 
deal with these matters so tactically. All of these games can 
arise out of a certain situation but it cannot be planned. 
  [DER SPIEGEL] The second red-green alliance in the country, 
in Hesse, is approaching an early end. 
  [Schroeder] I believe that especially in a red-green 
coalition, as in no other, the SPD must make it clear how it 
stands for work and male and female employees. Secondly, it must 
be clear who is leading: Who is the dog and who is the tail? And 
the SPD must not want to be greener than the Greens in important 
parts of the land party. The fascination will then come by 
itself. 
  [DER SPIEGEL] You won the election with economic policy 
themes. Are you resigned to the fact that the economy and 
finances are being determined only by axis powers Scharping and 
Lafontaine? 
  [Schroeder] That is the result of the party's decision last 
summer. 
  [DER SPIEGEL] Will you remain silent if your leaders 
Scharping and Lafontaine say that between the so-called key 
planks--no tax increase and no additional debts--there is no 
place for aid to the aircraft industry, but there probably is 
room for coal subsidies? 
  [Schroeder] No, by no means. Then the danger of losing the 
election with such policies would be too great. Imagine that we 
refuse to subsidize the shipyards for high-tech products and 
support hard coal with 11 billion annually--that would be a 
strange economic program. 
  [DER SPIEGEL] The axis must not harm your terrain. 
  [Schroeder] It will not make any decisions that are 
obviously 
irrational. But you did select a nice example. 
  [DER SPIEGEL] No one believes that you have already 
fulfilled 
your political life goals in Hannover. 
  [Schroeder] I know those who would prefer to have me with 
the 
United Nations. 
  [DER SPIEGEL] How much longer will you be satisifed with 
Lower Saxony Land? 
  [Schroeder] I know a soccer coach who is still uncommonly 
successful, Franz Beckenbauer from Bavaria Munich. He always 
says: "Let us take a look and we will see." 
  [DER SPIEGEL] Mr. Schroeder, we thank you for this 
conversation.

<F P=106> [WELT-NACHRICHTENDIENST report: "Germans Expect Lean Times"] </F>
  [Text] Wiesbaden -- Germans consider Germany as a business 
location jeopardized. They also seem to be preparing for lean 
times. This is indicated by a study conducted by the Emnid 
research institute for the Chemical Industry Employers 
Association. 
  Only 4 percent of the more than 3,000 persons polled said 
that they expect prosperity to grow in the next few years. 
  According to the study, those polled think that Germany has 
dropped from first place to fourth in the listing of most 
attractive business locations. The continuing debate has led to 
growing insecurity among the people, the study says. Japan, 
Korea, Taiwan, and Singapore are considered either better off or 
the same as Germany. Only one in four puts Germany first. 
  Two-thirds of those polled (67 percent) said that Germans 
will have to work longer hours and make do with lower wages, if 
they want to meet international standards. A total of 43 
percent were convinced that German products have become too 
expensive in the international markets and are thus no longer 
competitive. Two out of three said that Germans will have to 
prepare for the growth in prosperity coming to a halt.

<F P=106> [Article by SPD Chairman Rudolf Scharping: "The State Must </F>
Be More Thrifty"] 
  [Text] The modernization of the state retail sector is a 
continuous political task. This does not just apply to Germany, 
but is a particularly valid point considering the stagnation in 
this sphere in Germany over the past few years. In the process 
of expanding EU institutions, the need to restrain the extent of 
public services in good time must also be given greater 
consideration in Brussels. 
  Every EU country is currently holding a debate on the 
application of EU law on its terrirory, and on accelerating 
approval procedures. New concepts of efficiency in the state and 
in the administration are being developed. New trade forms are 
being worked out that conform to a more modern management of 
services, also taking into account the experiences of the 
private economy. But solutions for modernizing the state sector 
are not being introduced at the expense of this sector's 
efficiency. The state sector's efficiency must protect the 
common good from group interests. Therefore the question is not 
whether the state must act, but where and how it must act. 
Also, the objective is not the reduction of state sector 
activity to zero, but to adapt the state administration to 
modern requirements in good time. 
  Modernization means setting clear goals, permitting 
efficient 
activity, making a more economical use of resources, reaching 
decisions faster, and concentrating state activity on important 
matters. This means "purifying" state and communal activity 
and giving it a more efficient shape. The public sector is 
reformable as long as everyone -- the citizens, working people, 
trade unions, and politicians -- wants it reformed. Public 
administration must continue to develop in accordance with 
changing requirements. This includes a reorganization of the 
administration to bring it closer to the people, so that the 
administration can become a public-oriented service. But it 
also includes accelerating and simplifying decisionmaking 
processes and administrative procedures. Genuine reform also 
includes a regular critical appraisal of tasks. The laender and 
communuity administrations must check whether a particular task 
really has to be performed by the public services. New 
"management" [preceding word in English] is required in the 
public sector, together with an elimination of the excessive 
hierarchical structures there, and a far-reaching 
decentralization involving the distribution of the 
decisionmaking process among smaller "autonomous" administrative 
units. 
  I am not committed to the idea of the provision of services 
by private firms, but I wish to make it clear that no general 
decision can be made whether and to what extent public tasks and 
services will be performed by private structures and what form 
these private structures should take. That can only be decided 
on a case-by-case basis. Nevertheless, careful consideration 
leads one to conclude that in the process of transferring from 
publicly to privately provided services, one must avoid at all 
costs the emergence of private monopolies in the provision of 
particular services. In addition, privatized services should be 
offered constant protection. One must also consider whether or 
not the quality of services should be retained as it is or 
improved, and whether working people should be protected against 
excessive costs thereof. Privatization also involves social 
security. 
  Rhineland-Palatinate is also at the beginning of state and 
communal modernization. But its government, in office since 21 
May 1991, has already gone from theory to practice on several 
points. We have embarked upon the path of greater state 
efficiency and are including private industry in state 
processes. Our new Investment and Structure Bank is aimed at 
implementing the government's industrial and 
structural-political objectives. An amalgamation of the 
instruments and companies that promote the economy is expected 
to produce a synergy effect. Government employees have already 
joined the Investment and Structure Bank, and personnel savings 
can be achieved in the district governments. 
  Once the rules governing the administration of districts 
have 
been amended, most state tasks can be transferred to the 
districts. This involves turning state employees into district 
employees. Rhineland-Palatinate has accelerated this process 
with its "Tax Office 2000" project. Income tax declarations 
will no longer be processed in up to 15 separate stages by as 
many different employees, as is the case at present; instead, 
they will be handled by just one employee, who will at the same 
time have broader authority. A test conducted in February 1993 
resulted in a shortening of the average length of time in 
processing a tax declaration from nine weeks to just three 
weeks. Eleven tax offices are now participating in this 
experiment. 
  The public administration can be made even more efficient 
and 
economical when greater use is made of the experience and 
creativity of employees. For this purpose, a competition for 
the best ideas on simplifying administrative procedures is being 
prepared, and will be held throughout Rhineland-Palatinate. I 
expect it to provide results before the end of the year. 
  The following is also established practice in 
Rhineland-Palatinate: A new tax office in Neuwied and police 
precinct in Alzey have been built with the use of private 
capital and the experiences of private industry in construction 
projects. 
  Our ministry for the economy has developed a unique way of 
financing road construction programs out of private capital in 
view of the tight budget. In contrast to past methods of 
private financing, smaller enterprises will no longer be 
accorded second place before larger ones. 
  Rhineland-Palatinate has scored a hit on a national level 
with the construction of the Langenlosheim Bridge (Bad Kreuznach 
region), which was only possible with private capital. The next 
project involves the building of a bypass in the Westerwald 
region. The decisive advantage of the "Mogendorf model" is that 
when tenders are awarded, enterprises with medium resources, 
facing high costs because of the need to obtain loans to finance 
a project, are no longer at a disadvantage compared to large 
enterprises with a lot of capital. In this way, the lending 
bank can offer the borrowing enterprise attractive interest 
rates by means of certain refinancing opportunities on the 
capital market. Thus, an enterprise can receive attractive 
interest rates, just like the state can. 
  Rhineland-Partnership has also set an example of partnerlike 
cooperation between the state and private sectors in another 
sphere -- the elimination of problem waste. In the company that 
handles this waste, the state has 51 percent of the shares, and 
private waste removal organizations have 49 percent of the 
shares. For the processing of special waste in two additional 
furnaces, Rhineland-Palatinate was able to establish cooperation 
with the firm BASF within the framework of "public-private 
partnership" [preceding two words in English]. 
  Steps have been taken to reorganize state construction in 
Rhineland-Palatinate. A personnel management concept has been 
drawn up to prevent an excessive expansion of posts and permit 
the reduction of present posts. 
  The combination of state, communities, and industry will be 
intensified even further on the basis of experience. Since 
1991, a permanent link between the state, industry and science 
has been guaranteed in the form of the "Rhineland-Palatinate 
Future Initiative" association. This association has involved 
itself mainly in practical dealings. Its chairman is the 
president of the largest enterprise, and his deputy is the prime 
minister of Rhineland-Palatinate.

<F P=106> [Interview with Hans Peter Stihl, president of the </F>
Federation of German Chambers of Industry and Commerce, by I. 
Zaunitzer-Haase; place and date not given: "`Kohl Is My Man'"] 
  [Text] [Zaunitzer-Haase] Who should be the head of the 
next government? 
  [Stihl] I would like it to be Helmut Kohl. 
  [Zaunitzer-Haase] Rudolf Scharping is out of the question? 
  [Stihl] There were positive signals from industrial circles 
before the Social Democratic Party of Germany [SPD] presented 
their draft government program. With these ideas, the Social 
Democrats have dropped back in terms of economic policy. The 
new taxes proposed in the SPD program have a deterrent effect on 
the economy and on me personally. 
  [Zaunitzer-Haase] Does Helmut Kohl meet with your full 
approval? 
  [Stihl] "Full" would be an exaggeration. Let us put it this 
way: Industry is basically content with the coalition's overall 
achievements. Just a few examples: European Union [EU] 
enlargement, the GATT agreement, the privatization of railroads 
and postal services, the first moves toward securing Germany as 
a business location. These are positive results. 
  [Zaunitzer-Haase] Is there a "but" hidden somewhere? 
  [Stihl] The government has made a dramatic mistake recently: 
The compromise on the nursing care insurance is unacceptable. 
You can take my word for it: Industry will not stop resisting 
this. 
  [Zaunitzer-Haase] What are you planning to do? 
  [Stihl] Well, we are not going to block highways. But we 
will take suitable measures. You can rely on that. 
  [Zaunitzer-Haase] Let us come back to the "cabinet of your 
choice." Helmut Kohl should remain chancellor. Who will be 
economics minister? 
  [Stihl] For me, the best economics minister of the past 20 
years was Otto Count Lambsdorff. I would not mind his return. 
  [Zaunitzer-Haase] You are have not participated in the 
recent attacks on Economics Minister Guenter Rexrodt. 
  [Stihl] On the contrary. I have even protected him. When 
he speaks out against the law on shop-closing hours I applaud 
him. I hold two views on this issue: An official one that 
advocates limited extension of opening hours. And a personal 
one that says: Abolish the outdated shop-closing regulations. 
  [Zaunitzer-Haase] Finance Minister Theo Waigel is said to be 
tired of his office. They say he does not want to hold this 
office beyond the current legislative period. 
  [Stihl] If this is true -- but only on that condition, 
because Waigel has done his job quite well, considering the 
existing difficulties -- if it is true that he no longer wants 
to be finance minister, I have an idea who could become his 
successor. 
  [Zaunitzer-Haase] Who? 
  [Stihl] Karl Otto Poehl, the former Bundesbank president. 
He would certainly be a good choice. 
  [Zaunitzer-Haase] But Pohl is a Social Democrat. 
  [Stihl] What counts for industry is professional competence. 
It takes priority over party membership. 
  [Zaunitzer-Haase] Can you imagine the Greens in the 
government? 
  [Stihl] A government including the Greens is unthinkable for 
industry, because they have disqualified themselves even further 
by their recent party program. 
  [Zaunitzer-Haase] How can we get out of recession? 
  [Stihl] No additional taxes! No further tax burdens beyond 
the 7.5 percent surcharge from 1995, no reunification tax, or 
whatever. Industry misses convincing austerity measures on all 
levels. 
  [Zaunitzer-Haase] Where and how? 
  [Stihl] The Bundestag has too many members. We have too 
many ministries. Their number has to be reduced. 
  [Zaunitzer-Haase] That will not be enough! 
  [Stihl] The number of laender must be reduced. It is 
impossible that several of our 16 laender cannot support 
themselves financially. The so-called financial crisis of the 
laender is simply due to insufficient austerity resolutions. 
This has to be changed. 
  [Zaunitzer-Haase] The financial crisis in most of the local 
governments is undisputed. 
  [Stihl] I am not so sure about that. I hear nothing but 
complaints. But at the same time, taxpayers are stripped of 
their money. All the taxes are constantly being increased. 
This is an unacceptable situation!

<F P=106> ["adh" report: "Metalgesellschaft Recovering Slowly and </F>
Painfully"] 
  [Text] Frankfurt/Main -- In the view of its board of 
directors, Metallgesellschaft AG, Frankfurt, has made "good 
progress in many fields" over the past few months. During the 
first five months of the 1993-94 (30 September) business year, 
the corporation achieved a yield of 55 million German marks [DM] 
before taxes; the year before the yield was DM3.4 billion. The 
operational result has also improved, Kajo Neukirchen, chairman 
of the board of directors, stressed at the shareholders' 
meeting. The operational loss declined to DM50 million (the 
year before DM80 million). These figures, however, do not 
include the losses of DM1.5 billion suffered by the U.S. 
subsidiary, MG Corporation, which caused the financial disaster 
of Metallgesellschaft AG. During the first months of this year 
the turnover was DM7.1 (7.2) billion. The number of employees 
in the corporation declined to 41,357 (43,988) employees. 
  The cleaning-up and restructuring work at MG is also 
documented by numerous sales. After the sale of Kolbenschmidt, 
Korf, and Methanex, a 65-percent share of Metal Mining 
Corporation is obviously to be sold soon. "The necessary 
investments in the raw material production far exceed the 
financial capacity of the Metallgesellschaft corporation," 
Neukirchen said. Solving the mining problem is also pursued 
with "high priority." 
  Yesterday the shareholders' meeting had to decide on the 
second part of the recovery measures, which were adopted at the 
extraordinary shareholders' meeting on 24 February. The focal 
item was the issuing of convertible participation rights, with 
which claims by the banks are converted.

<F P=106> ["er." report: "Toepfer Calls For Import Stop"] </F>
  [Text] Duesseldorf -- In a sharp manner, Environment 
Minister Toepfer has called for an import halt on 
chlorofluorocarbons from third countries to the European Union 
[EU]. The Christian Democratic Union politician called on 
Brussels to no longer grant import permits for the "ozone 
killers" as of 1995, even if this is legal. According to 
Toepfer, imports of up to 26,000 tonnes of chlorofluorocarbons 
to the European Union are again permitted this year, but only if 
the material is reprocessed or used. However, with this import 
permit, the European Union is exposing itself to the suspicion 
that "in practice" it is not taking its commitment to the 
protection of the ozone layer "seriously," Toepfer complained. 
While Germany will abandon chlorofluorocarbons in 1994, Brussels 
is opening "the door to imports." The Commission should 
discontinue the allotment of quotas, as soon as the production 
of chlorofluorocarbons is terminated all over the European Union 
at the end of 1994, he said. Moreover, guarantees from industry 
that all substances used in the meantime "do not endanger the 
ozone layer" are necessary. Behind the scolding are 
investigations regarding illegal chlorofluorocarbon imports from 
East Europe to France via Germany.

<F P=106> ["dos"-signed report: "German Oil Production Too Expensive"] </F>
  [Text] Hannover -- Despite great efforts to reduce costs, 
oil production in Germany has become extremely unprofitable. 
According to the Economics Association for Oil and Natural Gas 
Production (WEG), the structural disadvantages of domestic 
production are having a greater effect now in view of the 
decline of international prices for oil. In this sector, all 
companies are showing very high deficits, said Gerd Eichhorn, 
chairman of the WEG Board of Directors. 
  In 1993, approximately 3.1 million tonnes of oil were 
produced from domestic reservoirs, which is 7.6 percent less 
than the year before. Among other things, this was due to the 
early closing of 15 fields and wells, which had become 
unprofitable. Meanwhile, almost 40 percent of the 2,940 usable 
production wells have been closed. This trend will continue this 
year with the planned closing of 12 oil fields. 
  The situation is more favorable in natural gas production, 
which remained almost stable at 17.7 billion cubic meters. A 
total of 92 percent was produced in Lower Saxony and another 7 
percent in Saxony-Anhalt. Domestic production contributes 22 
percent to covering the domestic demand of natural gas. The 
most important suppliers are the CIS with a share of 32 percent, 
the Netherlands with 31 percent, and Norway with 14 percent. As 
in the case of oil (50.5 million tonnes, following 57 million 
tonnes), domestic natural gas reserves went down by 7.5 percent 
to 303 billion cubic meters. Eichhorn: "We are beginning to 
live off the substance." 
  The need to reduce costs has not only lead to a further 
reduction of employees by approximately 1,000-8,000 on annual 
average. Expenditures for exploration and field development have 
also been reduced. One indication is the decline of drilling by 
13 percent to a new record low of 70,600 meters. Utilization of 
drilling equipment is 62 percent. 
  WEG harshly criticized the "completely insufficient" 
reduction of the production royalty on natural gas from 16 to 14 
percent. It is certain that the revenues for natural gas will 
clearly shrink in 1994 in the course of adjustment to the prices 
for heating oil. This is one of the reasons why a "substantial 
reduction" of the production royalty (in 1993, 214 million 
marks) would have been useful to stimulate exploration. The 
liberalization of the European network of pipelines, which 
permits third parties to transfer gas through the country, is 
not acceptable either, it was said.

<F P=106> ["uf."-signed report: "BMW Business Remains Energetic"] </F>
  [Excerpts] Munich -- A balance sheet of success for Bernd 
Pischetsrieder. During the term of office of the 45-year-old 
head of BMW, who succeeded Eberhard von Kuenheim in May 1993, 
the top position of the Munich corporation has been expanded 
further. 
  "We are the only German automobile producers," BMW Financial 
Director Volker Doppelfeld said, summarizing the past business 
year, "that has avoided working short hours and still achieved 
good operation results." This is a special economic development 
in the crisis-torn automobile industry, which BMW head 
Pischetsrieder wants to continue this year. "We expect slight 
increases in production, sales, and yield," his cautious 
prediction says. Even though the international deliveries of 
BMW stagnated at 137,300 cars during the first quarter of 1994, 
the turnover of the corporation rose by 2.7 percent to 7.5 
billion German marks [DM] during the same period. 
  As a result of the acquisition of British automobile 
producer 
Rover, which was sealed a few weeks ago, the BMW corporation is 
growing into new dimensions: The acquisition led to doubling of 
the European market share to 6.4 percent. At the end of 1994, 
the turnover of the BMW corporation, together with the 
consolidated Rover group, will amount to at least DM40 billion. 
  The assessments of the British automobile producer (turnover 
in 1993 was 4.3 billion pounds, sales were 442,000 vehicles), 
which are linked with the consolidation, are in full swing at 
the moment. "Rover is even better off than we originally 
expected," Doppelfeld says about the results of his examination. 
In addition, it is certain that the British BMW company, which 
is operating independently, can contribute a positive result. 
To expand its traditional position in the small-car sector 
(Metro, Mini) and cross-country-vehicle sector (Range Rover), 
BMW head Pischetsreder announced "increased investments" in the 
improvement of the range of models. 
  With a total of 534,397 sold vehicles last year, the number 
of deliveries to customers exceeded production (532,960 units), 
which means that stocks were reduced. [passage omitted] 
  Despite the difficult economic situation or the strains 
because of currency fluctuations, the BMW corporation shows a 
yield of DM16 (726) million after taxes. [passage omitted] 
  In addition to material expenditures, it was also possible 
to 
reduce expenditures for personnel (the total number of employees 
all over the world went down by 3.4 percent to 71,034).

<F P=106> [Commentary by Dietrich Zwaetz: "Too Much at a Time"] </F>
  [Text] The United States' complaint that China is behaving 
like another Japan may sound exaggerated, but it shows how 
sensitive the United States is in dealing with the two trading 
nations in the Far East, for 70 percent of the U.S. export 
deficit, which increased to $116 billion in 1993, was 
accumulated in trade with Japan and China. The United States do 
not regard the reason for failing in trade with these two 
countries to be their own, possibly not quite competitive, 
product range; but they consider it to be these countries' 
alleged closing of their markets to U.S. products. 
  It is, therefore, hardly surprising that U.S. Trade envoy 
Mickey Kantor calls the Japanese proposals to open the markets 
in 11 key areas "a half-finished job." In Kantor's view, the 
Japanese prime minister's proposals are not sufficient to 
dissipate Bill Clinton's reservations. What is more: Tokyo's 
concessions have not been enough to resume the suspended 
negotiations. But Kantor is giving Tokyo another chance: "We 
are not disappointed. The Japanese Government has called the 
proposals a first step, we consider them improvable." 
  The current suspension of U.S.-Japanese talks shows that 
neither threats of trade sanctions, nor top-level meetings, such 
as the unsuccessful meeting between Clinton and Prime Minister 
Morihiro Hosokawa, can bridge the gap. The reason is the 
different starting point of the two adversaries. The United 
States wants to open Japanese markets forcefully -- not only for 
its own benefit, but for the good of other nations as well. 
Washington feels it has been kept waiting too long by Japan; 
for instance when former Prime Minister Kiichi Miyazawa, 
threatened by being voted down already, conceded the U.S. 
President's framework agreements at the July 1993 Tokyo World 
Economic Summit, which his successor Hosokawa did not want to 
keep. 
  But when Tokyo finally takes a small step forward -- this is 
how the Americans see it -- the slight progress is offset by 
setbacks in other areas, or it is not put into practice at all. 
This explains Clinton's unfriendly reaction to Hosokawa's 
proposal, which the prime minister personally presented to the 
President, who is vacationing in California at the time. 
Clinton's cool reply: The Japanese market will be "carefully 
examined." 
  But perhaps the two adversaries will benefit from a break 
for 
contemplation while the talks are suspended. Kantor's way of 
negotiating is somewhat hectic anyhow. The U.S. trade envoy 
always wants too much at once. He gives the impression of 
constantly being pressed for time. For Kantor the talks with 
his Japanese adversaries are a very important experience. What 
is unfortunate for the United States is that the trade envoy's 
learning process is harming domestic industry.

  [Text] Arcore, Italy, April 1 (AFP) - Key talks on forming 
Italy's new government between mediate magnate Silvio Berlusconi 
and aides to his nominal election ally Umberto Bossi failed to 
get under way here as scheduled Friday [1 April] morning. 
  The meeting between Berlusconi, head of the Forza Italia 
party, and a delegation from Bossi's federalist Northern League 
was due to start at 10:00 a.m. (0800 GMT) at the media magnate's 
residence in this town near Milan. 
  Berlusconi's spokesman Antonio Tajani told hordes of 
journalists at the scene that "the meeting will not take place 
here. I can add nothing more other than to say that 
negotiations are continuing and everything is going well." 
  Meanwhile Roberto Maroni, the head of the League's 
parliamentary group, said on radio that the meeting would take 
place Friday morning, but at a secret location away from media 
attention. 
  The confusion over arrangements for the meeting followed a 
statement Thursday by the League challenging Berlusconi's claim 
the premiership. 
  The federalist movement said in a statement that "the 
Northern League is the premier political force in the country," 
claiming the right to run Italy's next government. 
  The statement confirmed deep-seated rivalries between the 
two 
parties, allied with the neo-fascist National Alliance in the 
right-wing coalition which won the elections Sunday and Monday. 
  A day earlier the League had reportedly agreed to let 
Berlusconi become prime minister. 
  The League has threatened to split the rich, industrialized 
north from the rest of Italy if more autonomy is not granted to 
the regions.

  [Text] The long-awaited meeting between Forza Italia and 
Northern League delegations is reportedly under way at an 
undisclosed location. Berlusconi and Bossi are expected to come 
to an informal agreement over the formation of the next 
government. This will not be easy because Bossi has already said 
that he wants a Northern League politician [Roberto Maroni] to 
be prime minister, while Berlusconi is himself bidding for the 
job. 
  Berlusconi's spokesperson reports that the meeting is 
proceeding well, while Maroni has said that a joint communique 
will be issued at the end of the talks.

<F P=106> [Report by Silvio Buzzanca: "Bertinotti, Consultation Pact </F>
on the Left"] 
  [Text] Rome -- On the day after the major defeat of the 
Left, Communist Renewal has the serene face of [Secretary] 
Fausto Bertinotti and the calm eloquence of [Chairman] Armando 
Cossutta. The two leaders are satisfied with the result and are 
stating openly that they will form an autonomous group in 
parliament with the task of providing "an effective opposition." 
To Achille Occhetto [secretary of the Democratic Party of the 
Left, PDS] and the other allies they are proposing solely a 
consultation pact. 
  When all is said and done they have won their battle, and 
are 
now ready to gather in fruits aimed at "visibility" and 
"diversity," setting them apart from the progressive chorus 
defending Prime Minister Ciampi. In order to mark this 
diversity, the neo-communists in parliament and in the Senate 
will be acting as a separate group. Because, Bertinotti 
explains, pouring everyone into one melting pot would represent 
a diminution of the plurality and the richness of the political 
scene to the Left. And then because unity must be constructed 
from the bottom up, paying attention to and building on the 
concerns and sensitivities of progressive voters. If not, it 
would be like trying to build a house starting with the roof and 
not the foundation. 
  For this reason Bertinotti and Cossutta are proposing the 
consultation pact between all elected progressives as a way of 
"reaching agreement on the battles which must be fought jointly 
inside and outside parliament," and of "remedying the deficit of 
unity during the election campaign" and of recovering the 
collegial spirit which has not worked in recent months. A pact 
which, they continue to underline, should start with the needs 
of people and with real problems, and which therefore requires a 
clear opposition, the renewal of social conflict as the only way 
of regaining the consensus of the popular masses. 
  Also because the Right, Bertinotti says, "is a Right which 
constitutes a very serious threat to the country's social 
model," a threat which also manifests itself "as a new form of 
dorotheism [former Christian Democratic faction]." Hence the 
need to prepare for opposition, also because Cossutta does not 
believe in the breaking up of the pole of the Right. Even if 
there were the possibility of creating a left-center government, 
with a [Northern League Secretary] Bossi landing in the opposing 
camp, Communist Renewal would be opposed. 
  Bertinotti does not wish to talk of rumors which say that 
Occhetto's future is in question within the PDS. And to those 
who remind him that, ultimately, Occhetto is the progressives' 
leader, he replies that "Renewal has never recognized 
leadership" within the grouping. Cossuta, on the other hand, 
opened the question of the forthcoming institutional 
appointments, pointing out that, since 1976, there has been "the 
practice of entrusting these delicate tasks" to persons who are 
not necessarily members of the majority but who enjoy "prestige 
and recognized competence." But, for Renewal's chairman, this 
too is open to discussion. 
  The serious political problem, on the other hand, is the 
chairmanship of the committees, in particular the bicameral ones 
entrusted with investigation and oversight. And here Cossuta 
proposes that "following the practice in many Western countries" 
the chairmanship be entrusted to the opposition. In this way 
the Renewal's leader has excluded the possibility of examining 
at this point in time the topic of the presidency of the 
Republic. "The legitimacy of President Scalfaro should not be 
questioned," Cossuta said, even if he recalled that in his party 
"considerable criticism has been expressed recently of certain 
choices made by the head of state."

be extended 30 miles to the east, toward the Italian coastline 
and 53 miles -- that is nearly 100 kilometers -- to the west, 
toward the Spanish coast. 
  Fisheries Minister Vicente Albero underlined that Algeria is 
sovereign in its decision to extend its territorial waters. 
According to Albero, in order to continue fishing, one will have 
to sign fishing agreements with Algeria and create joint 
ventures with capital from Algeria and from a Community country.

<F P=106> [Unattributed report: "Half of Spanish People Believe World </F>
Is Less Secure Today"] 
  [Text] Madrid -- Almost half the Spanish people (48.2 
percent) believe that the world is less secure today than 10 
years ago in terms of the possibility of wars or large-scale 
conflicts, and 23 percent have noted no changes. 
  According to a CIS (Sociological Research Center) opinion 
poll on "perception of the international political scene," 56.7 
percent of the Spanish people believe that the greatest danger 
to international peace and security that currently exists is the 
inequality between poor and rich countries, followed by the 
larger number of states possessing nuclear weapons (35.6 
percent). The resurgence of nationalism is cited third by 23.6 
percent. 
<H5>  Threat From East </H5>
  This poll, conducted last November among 2,500 people, shows 
that Russia and the former USSR as a whole, together with the 
East European countries, is the area that represents the 
greatest threat to world peace, according to 32 percent of the 
interviewees, while 26.6 percent cite the Arab countries, and 
22.6 percent the United States. 
  Half of the interviewees believe that, out of the possible 
sources of international conflict, the political instability in 
North Africa is the one that could most affect Spain's security, 
while 34.4 percent mention the former Yugoslavia. 
  Nevertheless, three out of every four Spanish people do not 
find that any country poses a direct threat to Spain, as against 
8.4 percent who say yes. Out of these, 39.4 percent cite 
Morocco, and in second place, with 14.5 percent, comes the 
United States. 
<H5>  Allied Countries </H5>
  Some 35.7 percent of the interviewees do not believe that 
Spain now has any allied country in particular, the United 
States being the one cited most often, by 9.2 percent, followed 
by France with 7.8 percent. 
  Two-thirds declare themselves in favor of a multinational 
force's being able to intervene in third countries' internal 
affairs under a UN mandate and with humanitarian aims. The 
percentage remains in the majority (52.9 percent) if it is an 
intervention not explicitly justified on humanitarian grounds. 
Despite his disappearance from the political scene, Mikhail 
Gorbachev remains the best-rated international leader (with 6.57 
out of 10). John Paul II takes second place with 6.25, followed 
by German Chancellor Helmut Kohl, with 5.76. Clinton comes 
after French President Mitterrand, with 5.56, and Boris Yeltsin 
scores only 4.47. Hassan II [of Morocco] scores 2.83, and Fidel 
Castro 2.80. 
  With respect to the most popular areas, on a scale of 0 to 
10 
the European Union (EU) scores 6.48, and Latin America takes 
second place with 6.19. The West European countries outside the 
EU score 5.97, East Europe 5.65, and Russia 5.46. Interest and 
liking fall to 5.39 for the United States and 5.10 for Japan, 
and North Africa, India, and China rate below 4.0. 
  Within the EU, the most popular country is Germany for 33.9 
percent of the interviewees, followed by Italy with 33 percent 
and France with 31.7 percent. Liking for the other countries is 
felt only by less than 20 percent, and the percentage of 
interviewees showing no liking for any of the other EU countries 
is 16 percent. At the world level, Italy is the most popular 
foreign country (cited by 11.7 percent), followed by Germany 
with 10.5 percent and France with 9.4 percent. 
  Assessing the country with the best model of democratic 
functioning and greatest respect for human rights, 6.5 percent 
cite the United States, followed by 5.7 percent who mention 
Germany, and France with 5.2 percent. Spain is cited by 2.6 
percent, behind Britain, Sweden, and Switzerland. For a quarter 
of the interviewees, no country stands out in this sphere. 
  Some 61 percent believe that Spain should cooperate 
internationally in order to assist the less developed countries' 
problems, even if this entails a financial cost. 
<H5>  Throne's Important Work </H5>
  According to the CIS poll on "perception of the 
international 
political scene," 45.4 percent of the interviewees describe 
Spanish foreign policy over the past few years as "very good" or 
"good" overall, while 30 percent rate it as "average." In the 
opinion of three-quarters of the interviewees, the throne's work 
has been "very" or "quite" beneficial for Spain's relations with 
other countries. The percentage falls to 47.1 percent if it is 
a matter of rating Felipe Gonzalez; 29 percent regard his work 
as "average" and 13 percent "poor" or "very poor." 
  Overall, 33 percent state that our country's international 
situation has improved in the past decade, and 57.3 percent 
believe that Spain's standing on the international scene is 
"very good" or "good." 
  In addition, 40.8 percent of the Spanish people currently 
believe that Spain was right to join NATO, while 31.8 percent 
believe that it was not, and 25 percent do not know. Some 42.7 
percent approve of Spain's staying in the Atlantic alliance, and 
28.7 percent disapprove. 
  Concerning the foreign policy aims for our country, 45 
percent mention as a priority progress in European integration, 
while the second most mentioned aim (18.4 percent) is the 
intensification of relations with Latin America. 
  According to the interviewees, the best relations are 
enjoyed 
with Germany, followed by France and the United States. Some 
47.7 percent state that Spain maintains a special friendship 
with the Arab countries, while 26.6 percent believe that this is 
not so. Out of these, 60 percent believe that it should strive 
to achieve it.

<F P=106> [Unattributed report: "Narcis Serra Believes Gonzalez Is </F>
Congress' Main Winner"] 
  [Text] Madrid -- Deputy Prime Minister Narcis Serra 
asserted yesterday that "if anybody could say that he won this 
congress, because it proceeded as he forecast and the leadership 
he secured is the one he proposed, that somebody is Felipe 
Gonzalez, but he will never do so." 
  In statements to the Spanish Radio Broadcasting Company, 
Serra said that the 33d Socialist congress "gave its support, by 
96 percent, to theses and a leadership team vastly different 
from the previous one, which will carry out those theses because 
it is perfectly attuned to Gonzalez and because it is a team of 
people with influence in the party and the ability to mobilize 
it." 
  The deputy prime minister also highlighted the support that 
the party gave at the congress for the government's activity. 
"The government's policy, including the labor reform policy, 
our proposals for emerging from the crisis, the democratic 
impetus proposal -- all this was fully endorsed at the congress. 
The new Federal Executive Committee is better able to 
coordinate activity with the government and to listen in the 
government." 
<H5>  Support Gonzalez </H5>
  In Serra's opinion, the congress is an extremely clear step 
forward toward cohesion in the party, which acquires a powerful 
and representative Executive Committee that supports the 
secretary general's decisions. "I believe that for many years 
we have not had a means to resolve the problems that arise in 
any party," he added, referring to the new Executive Committee. 
  Brand-new Organization Secretary Cipria Ciscar also assessed 
the congress' consequences on the following day. Ciscar said 
that he prefers "to be called a Socialist as such, and that is 
enough. I do not consider exactly the numbers in the Executive 
Committee, because that committee has people who are very 
representative of the party," he said. 
  Ciscar agreed with Serra that at the Federal Congress 
"Felipe 
Gonzalez' arguments won, since renewal went ahead, and there 
were important changes; he wanted party integration and 
cohesion, and that is what won." 
  In statements to Onda Cero, Ciscar also stated that "we must 
be glad that we all believe that we won, because that also shows 
that there is a desire to work satisfactorily." 
  Ciscar said that the formation of the Executive Committee 
was 
"an important change," and added that there was a "basic renewal 
in the sphere of ideas, which establishes a clear connection 
between party and government policy." 
  The new organization secretary stated that Jose Maria 
Benegas, his predecessor in the post, "is somebody who has 
worked hard and has his own political significance," and added 
that he "is glad about that," but this "causes no complex." 
  He asserted that there have been problems over the past two 
years and that the precongress process was "lively," but 
following this congress, he added, "I believe that the agreement 
that occurred and the commitment to work in the Executive 
Committee are sincere, and it should be loyal."

<F P=106> [Report by Julio Riquelme: "Pujol Will Not Change His </F>
Strategy of Ad Hoc Agreements With Government"] 
  [Excerpt] Madrid -- Convergence and Union [CiU] will not 
change its strategy of ad hoc agreements with the government, 
because it believes that the 33d PSOE [Spanish Socialist Workers 
Party] Congress did not serve to end the Socialist Party's 
internal conflicts and that therefore "nothing has changed as 
far as we are concerned," according to CiU leadership sources. 
  The latest proposal by Raimon Obiols, Socialist Party of 
Catalonia secretary general, for CiU to agree to form a 
coalition government with the PSOE was rejected yesterday both 
by Pujol and other leaders of both Convergence and Union 
consulted by this newspaper. In this case, there is agreement 
between Democratic Convergence of Catalonia and the Democratic 
Union of Catalonia in stating that "the solution that the PSOE 
has given to its crisis was just a mere exercise in internal 
balancing in order to make this legislative term last as long as 
possible -- in short, in order to stay in power." 
  For CiU it is therefore inconceivable for it to involve 
itself more in government activity with a party -- the PSOE -- 
that remains "in a precarious political situation." In fact, 
the CiU leadership will follow closely the course of the 
Socialist regional congresses because it believes that "although 
the Catalan Socialists have already held theirs, the struggle 
between renewalists and Guerraists could be repeated -- 
especially in Andalusia and Madrid -- and then we will know 
Gonzalez' real control and Guerra's real intentions." 
  Jordi Pujol himself told this newspaper following his first 
postelection meeting with Gonzalez: "With which PSOE would I 
reach agreement? With Felipe's, with Alfonso's, or with 
Felipe's and Alfonso's?" Those close to Pujol believe that the 
33d congress did not resolve that uncertainty. 
  Hence the CiU leadership, after analyzing the Socialist 
congress results, has decided to maintain its strategy of ad hoc 
parliamentary agreements with the PSOE, based on two parameters 
-- continuing to contribute to the legislature's stability and 
securing the greatest possible quids pro quo for this support.

<F P=106> [Monitored in progress] </F>
  [Excerpt] ...A UN report on Somalia, which so far has been 
kept secret, has been leaked. The report, written by General 
Gustav Haegglund, the future commander in chief of the Finnish 
Defense Forces, and two others, criticizes peace enforcement 
projects such as Somalia and recommends remaining within the 
traditional peacekeeping operations. The controversial report 
was written in February, but it has not been presented to the 
Security Council. Johanna Gallant reports from Washington: 
  [Begin Gallant recording] According to the 200-page report, 
the UN and the United States share responsibility with clan 
leader Mohamed Farah Aidid on the bloody confrontations in 
Mogadishu last autumn. The report also criticizes the unclear 
command structures of the UN troops that took part in the 
Somalia operation. The troops from the United States and Italy, 
in particular, operated too independently and did not let 
themselves be placed under the command of the UN. The United 
States had its own military base with its headquarters in 
Mogadishu and the Americans were leading the attempt to disarm 
the supporters of Aidid. This unsuccessful attempt turned into 
a three-month bloody war in the town. The report accuses both 
the United States and the UN of a policy that was too aggressive 
and led to suffering among countless civilians. The report 
recommends compensation to the civilian victims of the conflicts 
between the UN and the Somalis. The Commission also recommends 
that the UN should return to traditional, neutral peacekeeping 
after the failed peace enforcement attempt. 
  The United States had had enough of the Somali operation 
last 
October when 18 U.S. soldiers died in Somali ambushes in 
Mogadishu. At the initiative of the Americans, the Security 
Council set up a commission of three men to investigate the 
events of last autumn. In addition to Gen. Haegglund, the 
commission includes a judge from Zambia and a general from 
Ghana. The report by the commission was presented to the UN 
Headquarters on 24 February, but the Security Council has not 
been allowed to discuss it. The report has been kept secret, 
and according to newspaper reports, the secretary general has 
asked the commission to change the report -- in vain, because 
the commission has refused to change a word. There were 
suspicions that the report was kept secret and publication was 
delayed because negotiations between the clan leaders were under 
way at the time the report was concluded and the idea was not to 
disturb them. Another reason might be that there was an 
unwillingness to annoy the countries that came in for criticism, 
such as the United States, just as troops from these countries 
were asked to perform peacekeeping operations in Bosnia. 
Johanna Gallant, Washington. [end recording] 
  Gen. Gustav Haegglund has announced that he will comment on 
the report only when the contents have been made public. 
Defense Minister Elisabeth Rehn, who has just returned from the 
UN, also refuses to comment on Haegglund's report. Rehn says 
that peace enforcement operations such as in Somalia have 
normally failed. [passage omitted]

<F P=106> [Editorial by Bo Stenstrom: "Playing Security Policy EU </F>
Solitaire"] 
  [Text] As commander in chief of the Armed Forces, 
Gustav Haegglund is accepting a position of unusually great 
responsibility in the midst of this transitional phase of our 
security policy, writes Bo Stenstrom. 
  When General Haegglund succeeds Admiral Klenberg as 
commander 
in chief of the Armed Forces this fall, he will be doing so in a 
highly unusual phase of transition. Just as the exchange rate 
floats among other European currencies, so the security policy 
is bobbing up and down among the various overlapping and 
concurrent European security policy elements. 
  No one knows how it will end. 
  Much depends on whether the EU's [European Union] Common 
Foreign and Security Policy (CFSP), the Western European Union 
(WEU), NATO, NATO's North Atlantic Cooperation Council (NACC) 
with the former Warsaw Pact states, NATO's new Partnership for 
Peace (PFP) network, and the Conference on Security and 
Cooperation in Europe (CSCE) can continue to seek their 
respective main emphases and roles in the new arrangement under 
peaceful conditions or whether, on the other hand, a new and 
primarily political state of conflict will emerge in Europe. 
  But at least on the domestic level, Haegglund knows the 
stand 
Finland has taken on the EU. Even if Finland says no in a 
referendum, we will not be back where we started before our 
membership application in March 1992. 
  Not only have we expressed our readiness to determine 
whether 
we can join in the CFSP, but we have done so through a 
negotiating process. Our foreign policy leadership has confirmed 
this. 
  Unlike Denmark, we have pledged to remain loyal to a 
possible 
expansion of the EU's defense dimension beginning with the 
government conference in 1996. Denmark's exemption means that 
the Danes will not participate in making the decision. What have 
we ourselves actually promised concerning 1996 on the basis of 
our statements? 
  "Free of alliances and with an independent defense" is the 
formula of the day in both Sweden and Finland. In Sweden there 
is one report after another saying that Sweden was not neutral, 
but the self-perception among large segments of the Swedish 
electorate has nonetheless come to be one of neutrality. Among 
the same groups that are most critical of the EU. 
  In Finland, the break with the old pattern set by the Treaty 
of Friendship, Cooperation, and Mutual Assistance was so abrupt 
that a large segment of the public is still disconcerted, while 
leading politicians have been unwilling, and not without reason, 
to speculate too much about future security policy models. 
  We do not know how Finland will fit into a West European 
model of some kind or how that in turn may be integrated into an 
all-European security arrangement. 
  The report on the effect that the EU will have on our 
foreign 
policy was leaked to SUOMEN KUVALEHTI. It talks about a new 
intermediate step between "alliance free" and "allied." The 
negotiations with the EU have already put us in the position of 
being politically allied with a strong actor in the 
international arena. 
  The same will apply if (as Haegglund outlined in his lecture 
at Helsinki University) we become observers in but not members 
of the WEU. 
  If the people say yes to the EU, we presumably ought to 
become at least observers in the WEU. The WEU has become 
increasingly linked to both the EU and NATO. It could not be 
otherwise, since the central countries are the same in all three 
cases, and all three organizations have a very strong political 
dimension. 
  The WEU has been called a paper tiger, and people have joked 
about the fact that it has only a little over 100 employees, but 
a division of labor is currently taking shape in such a way that 
NATO will be the defense alliance in case of a major military 
conflict, while the WEU will take charge of more limited crises 
and conflicts with the help of various European and NATO forces. 
  The ultimate consequence of this is that if we became 
members, the WEU's full defense guarantee would have to be 
fulfilled by NATO -- even though we would be members not of NATO 
but of the CFSP, which would handle conflicts on behalf of the 
EU in international top-level politics. How does one solve that 
equation? 
  At the same time, we would have to be prepared to make 
(volunteer) troops available for WEU operations. All too many of 
us Finns believe that we would only be on the receiving end or 
that we could join the PFP, the WEU, and even NATO with no 
increase in our current defense spending. Actually, the result 
would probably be a tripling of that spending. 
  That also says something about the concept of independent 
defense in the prevailing doctrine. 
  An interesting link in the EU-WEU-NATO triangle is that the 
WEU has a cooperation forum with the Baltic states, Poland, the 
Czech Republic, Slovakia, Hungary, Romania, and Bulgaria for the 
purpose of giving them "a special relationship with the European 
defense dimension." 
  Considering the gap between the WEU's cooperation forum and 
the PFP, in which Russia, Belarus, and Ukraine are to 
participate, there is reason to wonder whether the sides of the 
new European security triangle may develop so far out of step 
with each other that the whole will be affected if and when the 
WEU's role is in fact strengthened. 
  In Finland, a parliamentary commission is to "revise" our 
foreign policy doctrine perhaps before the March elections. If 
such central elements as the EU agreement are settled by then, 
such a timetable may be more justified than if too many elements 
remain unresolved. 
  The new commander in chief, if anyone, is going to have 
experience with parliamentary defense commissions. In other 
respects as well, Haegglund's background is unusually well 
suited to the demands of the moment. That is what is needed, 
since there are probably not many who have had so many open 
European cards to play security policy solitaire with.

<F P=106> [Report by Hans-Inge Olsson: "Kazakhstan Privatizing Mines </F>
Worth 55 Billion"] 
  [Text] Mining giants in the West will now have a chance to 
buy themselves into former Russian mineral deposits. 
Kazakhstan's plans for a vast privatization program include the 
sale of the country's mining deposits worth up to 55 billion 
kronor [SKr]. 
  "Taking over the mines will probably not involve large 
costs; 
the big money is needed for the investments to start the 
operations," Trelleborg Group CEO Kjell Nilsson said. 
  Previously inaccessible markets are now being opened up. One 
of the reasons is that the authorities need foreign capital for 
the investments required by their projects. The long-discussed 
privatization plan has now been presented by the Kazakhstani 
authorities. It seems set to become the largest privatization 
operation ever in any of the former Soviet Republics. 
<H5>  A Region Rich in Minerals </H5>
  The program involves 14 of the largest mining deposits in 
the 
richest mineral region in the world. Outside experts have 
estimated the deposits to be worth $7 billion. In other words, 
the value of these privatizations is five times higher than the 
estimated value of the Trelleborg-owned Falconbridge Company. 
These planned sales could thus have momentous consequences for 
the mining industry throughout the world. 
  "But it is not necessarily a bad thing for interested 
parties 
from the private sector to get into the mining industry. It 
would make people start thinking in terms of profitability and 
kindle an awareness of unprofitable areas," Kjell Nilsson said. 
  He pointed out that a lot remains to be done in the former 
Soviet mining industry before foreign investors begin lining up, 
not least a change in the laws to provide a clear definition of 
ownership. 
<H5>  Many Different Projects </H5>
  "We are discussing a number of different projects, but there 
are no concrete talks about any projects in Kazakhstan," Kjell 
Nilsson said. Kazakhstan, however, is nothing new, because the 
Trelleborg group and its subsidiary, Boliden Contech, are in the 
process of building a precious-mineral processing plant for 
Balkhashmed. 
  The Balkhashmed copper mine, with 13,000 employees, is one 
of 
the concerns earmarked for sale. Another project is the largest 
chrome deposit of the former Soviet Union, in Donskoy. "If one 
really gets one's teeth into a good one, there is an excellent 
chance of finding interesting morsels among these projects," 
Boliden Contech CEO Staffan Jaehkel said. Boliden Contech 
specializes in selling Swedish technical solutions abroad. This 
year's turnover appears set to reach SKr250 million, and news 
about the outcome of plans for a giant project for Norilsk on 
the Kola peninsula is expected soon. 
  Boliden Contech, together with the Norwegian companies Elkem 
and Kvaerner, has submitted the best offer for a project that 
may be worth SKr2 billion over a four-year period. 
  Some 5 km from the Norwegian border, the main task will be 
to 
stem the discharge of sulphate dioxide from the nickel-smelting 
plant. This plant discharges six times more sulphate dioxide 
than the whole of Sweden in a year.

  [Text] Robert Lamb, the U.S. State Department's special 
coordinator on the Cyprus issue, said the United States will 
continue to work hard toward both sides in Cyprus accepting the 
confidence-building measures. In a statement made this morning 
before leaving for Athens and Ankara, Lamb said significant 
progress has been made. He added that just a few problems 
remain, but he believes they can be resolved. 
  Asked whether responsibilities will be attributed for the 
deadlock, Lamb said the problem is not responsibility or which 
side will receive more advantages over the other. He said: The 
issue is to break the deadlock and find a solution.

  [Text] The Turkish side is trying to create tensions in 
Cyprus following the final deadlock in the proximity talks due 
to the intransigent stance maintained by Rauf Denktas. The 
fabrication of false reports about the existence of camps for 
the training of Kurdish guerrillas in Troodos is part of this 
attempt. According to CyBC's [Cyprus Broadcasting Corporation] 
reliable information, the Attila [Turkish troops in Cyprus] and 
pseudostate forces have been placed on a state of alert in order 
to make an impression. 
  A competent government source told CyBC this evening that 
the 
Turkish claims about the existence of camps for the training of 
Kurds in the free areas of Cyprus are absolutely unfounded. The 
source also stressed that these are fabrications that aim at 
serving Turkish propaganda and diverting public attention from 
the Turkish side's responsibility for the deadlock in the 
proximity talks. The same source recalled that in the past 
Turkish propaganda also tried to present Cyprus as a center for 
the training of Armenian commandos. If the Turks have any 
evidence, the source stressed, let them submit such evidence to 
the United Nations for investigation.

  [Text] President Rauf Denktas received Ambassador Robert 
Lamb, U.S. special coordinator on Cyprus affairs, today. 
Minister of State and Deputy Prime Minister Ozker Ozgur; 
Minister of Foreign Affairs and Defense Atay Ahmet Rasid; 
Foreign Ministry Under Secretary Ozer Koray; presidential 
advisers Necati Munir Ertegun and Ergun Olgun, and U.S. 
Ambassador Richard Boucher attended the meeting, which lasted 
for nearly an hour and a half and continued during a working 
luncheon. 
  In a statement before the meeting, Ambassador Robert Lamb 
said that the objective of his contacts was to ascertain the 
views of the Turkish and Greek Cypriot sides on the package of 
confidence-building measures [CBM's]. He stressed that he did 
not intend to submit new proposals to the two sides. Describing 
the CBM's as a very important opportunity for Cyprus, Lamb said 
that the United States is determined to do what is necessary to 
eliminate any possible difference of views between the two sides 
on the CBM's. 
  Speaking after the meeting, President Denktas said: 
  [Begin Denktas recording] Mr. Lamb informed us of the 
meeting 
he held with Glavkos Kliridhis. Nothing has changed on the 
Greek Cypriot side. The Greek Cypriots have not changed their 
viewpoint. Our viewpoint is clear. We have discussed that. 
With Good will, a way can be found to resolve the matter. I am 
forced to reiterate that we cannot make any progress if the 
Greek Cypriot side maintains the attitude that it is the 
government and can say that it does not agree to this or that. 
[end recording] 
  President Denktas replied to correspondents' questions as 
follows: 
  [Begin recording] [Unidentified correspondent] Mr. 
President, 
the UN officials have damaged the CBM's with their interim 
proposals. Furthermore, they have used pressure to force you 
to agree to their proposals. 
  [Denktas] They are approaching both sides. 
  [Correspondent] Are they taking sides? 
  [Denktas] No, they say that they are trying to help the two 
sides. 
  [Correspondent] Have they submitted new proposals? 
  [Denktas] No, but they tried to learn our viewpoint on 
whether or not this or that can be changed. Naturally, the 
changes called for depend on what the Kliridhis Administration 
agrees or disagrees on. 
  [Second unidentified correspondent] Mr. President, you 
disclosed yesterday that you are being forced to hold a 
referendum. What conditions compel you to do so? 
  [Denktas] We shall wait to see the [UN secretary general's] 
report. We shall wait to see what else will be done. If we say 
something, it should not be taken to mean that we shall do it 
the next day. We are trying to convey certain hints on where 
the matter is going. We have to wait for the report. What will 
the UN Security Council do later? Will it adopt a new 
resolution? We shall wait to see all that. 
  [Correspondent] The report may be postponed? 
  [Denktas] Yes; I read a newspaper report on that, but we 
have 
no official information. 
  [Third unidentified correspondent] Mr. President, will the 
developments on the CBM's depend on the Greek Cypriot approach? 
  [Denktas] The solution of the Cyprus problem depends on the 
Greek Cypriot approach. Naturally, the ball will always be in 
the Greek Cypriot court if they continue to say: We are the 
legal Cyprus Government; things have to be done the way we want 
them; we are justified in demanding everything; nothing happened 
between 1963 and 1974; the Cyprus problem began in 1974; and 
Greece and Cyprus can adopt joint decisions and cooperate on 
this or that. 
  [Fourth unidentified correspondent] Mr. President, there was 
a danger of a deadlock in the talks at the beginning of the 
week. You said that the package had been pierced and that a 
state of uncertainty existed. 
  [Denktas] They are trying to find a way. 
  [Correspondent] Have new proposals been submitted? 
  [Denktas] No, new proposals have not been submitted. They 
are trying to establish whether the two sides can agree to alter 
their positions on several basic issues and to what extent are 
they prepared to do so. It is quite clear that there has been 
no significant change in the positions of the two sides thus 
far. Therefore, efforts will probably continue. [end recording]

  [Text] Some movement around the Skopje [The Former 
Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia-- FYROM] issue continues due to 
the successive visits by U.S. envoy Matthew Nimetz to Skopje and 
Athens. Mr. Nimetz arrived in Athens from Skopje again this 
afternoon and held a meeting with Foreign Minister Karolos 
Papoulias, thus continuing the new round of contacts with the 
Greek side. Our correspondent Mirela Kalostipi has the 
following dispatch from the Foreign Ministry. Good evening 
Mirela. 
  [Kalostipi] Good evening, ladies and gentlemen. The new 
round of talks between Foreign Minister Karolos Papoulias and 
Bill Clinton's special envoy on the Skopje issue actually 
concluded a few minutes ago. Mr. Nimetz arrived in Athens this 
afternoon, and at 1900 he came to the Foreign Ministry and 
talked with the Greek foreign minister for approximately 1 hour. 
After this meeting, Mr. Nimetz will be returning to New York. 
  Some statements were made, but the most important point is 
that Mr. Papoulias has accepted the invitation of Cyrus Vance, 
the international UN mediator, to a meeting in New York from 9 
to 11 April. Here we should say that, according to reliable 
press reports, a similar invitation has also been accepted by 
Skopje Foreign Minister Stevo Crvenkovski. 
  [Announcer] For the same dates? 
  [Kalostipi] For the same date, for 11 April. There is a 
statement by Mr. Crvenkovski that he will also visit New York to 
meet with Mr. Vance. In any case, Mr. Papoulias said that Mr. 
Kiro Gligorov and the Skopjeans persist in their well-known 
intransigence. We will see how this story develops. In any 
event, in a statement after his meeting with Mr. Papoulias, Mr. 
Nimetz said that continuous in-depth and intensive discussions 
are going on both in Athens and in Skopje. They are discussing 
all aspects of the problem and, according to Mr. Nimetz, it is 
obvious that both sides have both the desire and the will to 
reach a solution. We are concerned that a solution to the 
problem be found. However, he added, there are still 
difficulties, and the negotiations and talks should continue in 
order to find some way out. 
  [Anouncer] Mirela, do you assess the fact that both sides 
have accepted the invitation to meet with Cyrus Vance in New 
York on the same dates as a positive development showing that 
the negotiations are on the right track? 
  [Kalostipi] Clearly, this shows that something positive is 
happening. At least there is a persistent movement to find a 
solution soon; and when we say soon, we mean prior to the prime 
minister's visit to the United States. But there is nothing 
clear concerning the question of ending Skopjean intransigence. 
However, I suppose--and this is a guess--that for both Mr. 
Crvenkovski and Mr. Papoulias to decide to visit New York in 
order to meet, most probably separately, with the international 
mediator means that they have something to say of which we do 
not yet know. Probably--and I am still guessing--the Skopjeans 
are ready to make some practical concession, but all this is 
conjecture. What we know as a fact is that Mr. Vance will meet 
with both Mr. Crvenkovski and Greek Foreign Minister Karolos 
Papoulias in the next few days.

  [Excerpt] Eyup Asik, Motherland Party [ANAP] whip, said 
that the tricks and fraud involved in the local elections of 
last Sunday [27 March] had not been seen in any elections since 
1950, and that the justice minister is mainly responsible for 
this. 
  At a news conference in parliament, Asik charged that just 
before the election schedule was announced, the justice minister 
replaced the leaders of the Justice Committees in 49 provinces. 
The Justice Committees appoint election officials. 
  Asik pointed out that in all the places where there was 
fraud, the Social Democratic Populist Party and the Prosperity 
Party contested the positions. The great majority of the votes 
found in garbage dumps, he charged, were votes for ANAP. 
  Asik stressed that the government parties lost close to 15 
percent of their vote. This shows that the people do not like 
the government policies, he said. [passage omitted]

  [Text] Justice Minister Seyfi Oktay said that Election 
Councils are separate from the Justice Ministry, and that the 
government cannot influence these bodies. 
  Replying to reporters' questions in parliament today, the 
justice minister said that the allegations being made are aimed 
at undermining the regime. Circles that are opposed to the 
democratic regime, he said, come up with such allegations. 
  Asked to comment on reports that ballot boxes and ballot 
slips were found in garbage dumps, the minister said that it is 
the High Election Council and the officials on duty during the 
elections that are accountable for that. The public prosecutors 
will investigate the allegations on this issue, he said, and the 
judiciary will do whatever is necessary.

  [Text] The True Path Party [TPP] has announced that it 
wants the coalition government to continue until 1996, and that 
it will not be the one to destroy this coalition. 
  The TPP leadership council, whips, and administrative 
council 
members met with Tansu Ciller, party leader and Prime Minister, 
in Ankara today. 
  In a statement after the two hour meeting, TPP deputy leader 
Esat Kiratlioglu said: The citizens gave us the responsibility 
to solve the problems of terrorism and economy. They want us to 
find solutions. Aware of our responsiblity, we are determined 
to solve these problems and lead our country in a spirit of 
unity and solidarity and in stability to the elections in 1996. 
  Kiratlioglu stressed that within this framework, the TPP 
follows the principle of finding solutions to the country's 
problems over and beyond political considerations. He added: 
We want the coalition to continue. We do not want it 
destroyed. We want it to fulfill its duties until the scheduled 
elections. We will not be the ones to destroy the coalition. 
We will certainly not be the ones to destroy it. At this 
stage, the country needs stability, not a search for a new 
government. 
  Asked to comment on the fact that certain TPP deputies were 
collecting signatures, Kiratlioglu said that this signature 
campaign was not aimed at ending the coalition, but at bringing 
counterproposals to the one that might be posited by the Social 
Democratic Populist Party [SDPP]. 
  The TPP deputy leader stressed that at this stage, the party 
is not seeking a coalition with the Motherland Party. If the 
SDPP leaves the coalition, he said, every combination within the 
parliament will be considered.

  [Text] Istanbul, Mar. 31 (A.A.) -- Parliament speaker 
Husamettin Cindoruk said today that a change in the existing 
government was unlikely, despite the sweeping election victory 
of the Prosperity Party (RP). 
  In a press conference here, after the fundamentalist RP 
headed for a victory in Sunday's [27 March] local elections, 
Cindoruk said that the bans on youth organizations, foundations 
and similar organizations should be lifted so the political 
parties can have broader-based relations with the people. 
  Stressing the superiority of the Consitutional Court, the 
republic's prosecutor and justice, Cindoruk said, "if a 
political party begins acting against the law, the justice and 
the laws and the Constitution will do whatever necessary." 
  "No political party can enter an action which would spoil 
the 
basic structure and principles of the state," he said. 
  Cindoruk, also gave some advice to the new mayors, in his 
address. 
  "The municipality is not a place to worship, but a place to 
implement. In Turkey, there is a freedom of religion. Everyone 
is free to live the way he pleases. If these facts are not 
observed, then there will be a social resistance," he said. 
  "My second piece of advice is to keep in mind that a local 
administration cannot bring a (new) social order, because it 
cannot impose taxes, make laws. Local administrations should 
not be used as if a new government came into power," he added. 
  He also stressed that whoever implements backward methods 
when in office will not be reelected in the next elections.

relations were raised to their highest level through the support 
extended by Libya during the Cyprus Peace Operation and 
continued as a result of Turkey's contribution to Libya's 
development and advancement. He noted that the monies owed to 
Turkish contracting firms in Libya are being paid according to a 
system that uses oil as payment. Cetin added that all debts are 
expected to be paid within this year. Al-Muntasir stressed that 
Libya attaches great importance to its relations with Turkey and 
that it wants to cooperate in all fields. He will continue his 
contacts this afternoon as well and will leave the country on 2 
April.

<F P=106> [Unattributed report: "Attention! They Are Going To Dump </F>
Toxic Waste Into the Mediterranean"] 
  [Text] Trailers loaded earlier with 90 tons of chemical 
waste from Incirlik Air Base have arrived at Mersin port. The 
waste, which is in barrels inside containers, was loaded on the 
Panamanian-registered 1731 ton Eurotrader. The ship belongs to 
Lionel Maksume, a ship owner in Antakya. 
  The appeal of the environmentalists in Mersin to the 
governor 
of Adana remained unanswered. The governor replied by merely 
saying: "I have no authority to open the consignment." Governor 
of Adana said: "It can be opened only with special permission 
from the General Staff. Special protective clothing is 
necessary. I cannot open it because we do not have such 
clothing." 
  The need for special clothing indicates that the waste is a 
radioactive material. That is, it is nuclear waste. According 
to covertly obtained information by environmentalists, the 
customs declaration describes the ship's cargo as "toxic waste." 
The barrels are placed inside containers on which there are no 
markings. 
  Officials say that the 90 tons of waste belongs to Incirlik 
Base and that it is being sent to Britain for destruction. 
However, the experts say that such a large amount of waste 
cannot belong to Incirlik alone and most probably it was flown 
into Incirlik from the United States. A police car and two U.S. 
teams escorted the 90 tons of waste from Incirlik to Mersin. 
  The Eurotrader will leave Mersin on Monday with its toxic 
cargo for Izmir. Officials say that the ship will take on cargo 
in Izmir and then leave for Britain. However, the 
environmentalists in Mersin say: "They will dump the 
poison-filled barrels into the Mediterranean somewhere between 
Mersin and Izmir. They are now trying out the Mersin route 
because the Black Sea route was exposed and a new shipping 
accident occurred in the Istanbul straits." 
  Environmentalist are saying: "Apart from its numerous 
dreadful roles, it now appears that Incirlik Base was also being 
used for such dirty work. This ship must be tracked, the 
dumping of the poison into Mediterranean must be prevented, and 
the public must be awakened to this fact."

<F P=106> [Unattributed article: "Ciampi and Kohl Review European </F>
Union Enlargement, G-7"] 
  [Text] (ANSA) Rome, March 31 -- Italian Premier Carlo 
Azeglio Ciampi on Thursday [31 March] met in Bad Hofgastein, 
Austria, with German Chancellor Helmut Kohl for informal talks 
which focused on the enlargement of the European Union [EU] and 
participation of Russia in the summit of the West's Group of 
Seven (G-7) most industrialized countries, which Italy will host 
in Naples in July. 
  The premier's office here said that Ciampi had gone on an 
invitation from Kohl who is vacationing at the Austrian resort 
and would also review the results of the recent G-7 summit of 
finance ministers in Detroit, which focused on employment. 
  The talks on EU enlargement were expected to have dealt with 
the changes in voting procedure, especially veto powers, once 
Austria, Norway, Sweden and Finland join the European Union, 
January 1, 1994 if current time-tables are respected. 
  Both Ciampi and Kohl, the premier's office, share the view 
that the "concept of Europe" must be re-launched with steps made 
towards advancing European integration and in the fight against 
unemployment. 
  The G-7 summit will be held July 8-10.

<F P=106> [Carmen Parra report: "Government Puts Through Labor Reform </F>
With Support of Only 52 Percent of House"] 
  [Excerpt] Madrid -- The labor reform was approved 
yesterday at the Congress [of Deputies] plenary session with the 
votes of the Socialist Party and the Catalan and Basque 
nationalists. In short, it has the actual support of 52 percent 
of the house, a support different from the voting which took 
place a week before the 27 January general strike -- against 
that reform -- when 90 percent of the deputies rejected the 
amendments proposed to the bill as a whole by United 
Left-Initiative for Catalonia and the Canary Islands Coalition. 
The leading opposition group -- the People's Party -- abstained 
in the voting on the urgent job promotion measures bill, 
creating apprenticeship contracts, and supported only a part of 
the reform of the Workers' Statute. 
  The alliances for approving the new trade union election 
regulations were different. Here the PSOE [Spanish Socialist 
Workers Party] had to rely basically on the votes of United Left 
and the Canary Islands Coalition, in view of the all-out 
opposition of Convergence and Union [CiU] and the People's Party 
to the text agreed on by the government and the main trade 
unions, the Workers Commissions and the UGT [General Workers 
Union] -- the only agreement that they have reached in the past 
four years. 
  The reform of the Workers' Statute and, within it, the new 
regulation of collective bargaining and dismissal had the 
support of the PSOE, CiU, and, in part, the PNV [Basque 
Nationalist Party]. The People's Party asked for the voting on 
the articles to be broken down, and also supported one part of 
the bill and abstained on another. 
  With the Socialist Party's support, CiU managed to get it 
deemed not a fraud in law to dismiss in successive three-month 
periods a number of workers below the threshold set by the bill 
-- 10 percent of staff -- if the causes cited are different in 
each 90-day period. In addition, dismissals affecting the 
entire staff of enterprises with five workers or less will not 
be deemed mass dismissals. 
  For its part, the urgent employment promotion measures bill 
was finally approved following the setback which it suffered 10 
March at the so-called scandalous plenary session, at which the 
People's Party reported irregularities in the voting. The bill 
was sent from the lower house to the Senate with 177 "yes" votes 
(the PSOE, CiU, and the PNV), 24 "no" votes (United Left, the 
Canary Islands Coalition, and the Republican Left), and 134 
abstentions (the People's Party). [passage omitted]

<F P=106> [By Chris Parkin, PRESS ASSOCIATION, in Dublin] </F>
  [Text] Irish Prime Minister Albert Reynolds tonight urged 
Sinn Fein to spell out exactly what was meant by its latest 
demand for clarification from Britain of the Downing Street 
Declaration. 
  As he left Dublin airport for London on the first leg of an 
Easter trip to Cyprus, Mr Reynolds said Sinn Fein had a 
responsibility to explain itself. 
  Responding to a statement issued by Sinn Fein's president, 
Gerry Adams, the Irish premier said he was unsure what points 
the hard-line Republican party needed clarifying. 
  He said London and Dublin had always been at one on their 
approach to the Declaration and added: "If one studies their 
(Sinn Fein's) latest statement, it is difficult to know what 
they mean." 
  The Irish premier, whose aides have stressed his 
close-to-anger disappointment with the IRA's limited ceasefire, 
also made clear once more that he did not think 72 hours was an 
adequate period to prompt developments toward peace. 
  "There is a momentum for peace and three days is not 
sufficient, in my view, to allow something significant to 
happen. I would like to see the momentum continue so that the 
three days could be extended and something beneficial take place. 
  ``Let's hope this small step of a three-day ceasefire can be 
the forerunner of many other steps that will ultimately lead to 
a cessation of violence,'' he said. 
  "That is what both communities in Northern Ireland and the 
vast majority of Irish and British people want. The sooner we 
get clarification from Sinn Fein the better." 
  Mr Reynolds' words were seen in Dublin as his sharpest 
criticism yet at Sinn Fein's handling of the position thrown up 
by the Declaration. 
  But it was also learned tonight that Irish concern over Sinn 
Fein delays in responding to the joint statement of December 15 
was relayed through intermediaries well ahead of last night's 
IRA ceasefire announcement. 
  Mr Reynolds will be away from Dublin for a week but 
officials 
said he will be kept in constant touch with all developments 
surrounding the Anglo-Irish peace initiative and the IRA 
ceasefire.

<F P=106> ["msl/DW"-signed report: "Bomb Threat Against Israeli </F>
Embassy"] 
  [Text] Bonn -- A large area near the Israeli Embassy in 
Bonn has been sealed off for several days following bomb threats 
against Israeli institutions. German security authorities have 
been informed of Palestinian groups planning terror attacks on 
the embassy. 
  There is "very serious evidence" of possible bomb attacks 
"by 
the Hezbollah" on Israeli targets in Germany, a police spokesman 
said in Bonn yesterday. He did, however, not indicate whether 
the threats came from the pro-Iranian Hezbollah operating from 
South Lebanon or from another group. A terror commando is said 
to have already entered Germany. 
  The Israeli Embassy itself has not received any threats. 
Yet, the security authorities are speaking of "a danger that 
has to be taken very seriously." 
  The Interior Ministry did not want to release any details on 
the security measures taken. "The security authorities are 
taking appropriate measures," a spokesman said. 
  In Frankfurt/Main, where there are many Israeli 
institutions, 
a police spokesman only said that these buildings are 
permanently being observed. He did not say whether security has 
been stepped up following the bomb threats.

<F P=106> ["deu" report: "Witnesses: German Tanks Used Against </F>
Kurds"] 
  [Excerpt] Bonn -- The Foreign Ministry is increasingly 
confronted with accusations by Alliance 90/Greens, human rights 
organizations, and church groups that it is one-sidedly 
supporting the position of the government in Ankara in the 
conflict between Kurds and Turkey. Representatives of such 
organizations and politicians of Alliance 90/Greens called on 
Foreign Minister Klaus Kinkel (Free Democratic Party of Germany) 
in Bonn on Wednesday [30 March] to exert pressure on Ankara to 
come to a political solution. 
  After their return from Turkey, observers of the local 
elections last weekend and other eyewitnesses reported again in 
Bonn that, in contrast to its assurances, Ankara is using German 
weapons against Kurdish civilians. A Franciscan monk said that 
he observed a "massive presence" of BTR-60 armored personnel 
carriers in the battle area, took photographs of the vehicles, 
and passed the pictures on to the German Embassy in Ankara. 
Bonn had delivered 300 of these vehicles of the National 
People's Army (NVA) to the NATO partner. 
  Despite the many pieces of information, the Foreign Ministry 
insisted that it has no proof that German weapons are used 
against Kurds in violation of the previous agreement. If there 
are no photographs, "we have a different situation," Foreign 
Ministry spokesman Michael Gerdts said. If the accusations 
prove to be true, Bonn will "react immediately." Responding to 
repeated admonitions by Kinkel, the Turkish Government assured 
that it will use the delivered weapons only within the framework 
of the NATO treaty, that is only for defense in case of an 
attack from the outside. In October 1993 a picture that showed 
a Kurd being dragged behind a BTR-60 armored vehicle had caused 
international excitement. However, since 10 BTR-60's in Turkey 
came from Russia, it was not possible to clarify the origin of 
this one vehicle without any doubt. 
  Tilman Zuelch, chairman of the "Society for Threatened 
Peoples," also accused the Foreign Ministry of always brushing 
off information that German weapons are used against Kurds. "We 
no longer take the Foreign Ministry's behavior seriously," 
Zuelch told SUEDDEUTSCHE ZEITUNG on Wednesday: "A dialogue is 
completely pointless." 
  Since 1990 alone Bonn provided Ankara with armament materiel 
worth more than 1 billion German marks. Among other things, 240 
Leopard tanks and 13 Phantom combat planes came from western 
Germany; in addition to the 300 armored personnel carriers and 
60 million rounds of appropriate ammunition, materiel from the 
NVA stocks includes 256,000 Kalashnikovs with 100 million rounds 
of ammunition, 5,000 machine guns, as well as more than 100,000 
antitank guns. The GSG-9 trained 3,000 men of the Turkish 
special unit "Black Bugs." German election monitors claim that 
they came into contact with this special unit in the Kurdish 
area in southeastern Anatolia last week. 
  In a response to an inquiry by Alliance 90/Greens, the 
Federal Government now admitted that it knows about the exports 
by a grenade-producing facility from Germany via the Netherlands 
to Turkey. Bonn approved the export of the entire facility from 
Lower Saxony to the Netherlands. Now the government stated that 
the application by the Dutch "included the indication that a 
`temporary loan' of the facility to a Turkish company is being 
considered." The Federal Government has "no official knowledge" 
of the fact that German experts are now erecting the facility in 
Turkey. [passage omitted]

<F P=106> [Report by Sebastiano Messina: "Ministerial Sweepstake </F>
Begins"] 
  [Text] Rome -- Now that the League's obstacle to the first 
Silvio Berlusconi government has been removed, Forza Italia's 
leader is working in top secret on his list of ministers. He 
does not yet have a list, of course, but the choice of names to 
submit for President Oscar Luigi Scalfaro's approval and 
signature, in accordance with the Constitution, is rapidly 
taking shape. One new factor emerging from yesterday 
afternoon's Berlusconi-Bossi [Northern League leader] meeting 
could affect Roberto Maroni, the League's lower house floor 
leader, whom the League leader has proposed for prime minister. 
  Three possible posts await him, and he will of course gain 
one of them. The first (and most likely) is deputy prime 
minister, a post without any direct powers, but nevertheless 
symbolic of the League's influence over the next cabinet. The 
second is the very powerful position of interior minister -- a 
post that the DC [Christian Democratic Party] has held 
uninterruptedly since the beginning of its era. "I would gladly 
fill it in order to clean up the secret services and to take 
part directly in the federative reform," Maroni told his aides 
yesterday, and Clemente Mastella [Christian Democratic Center] 
has granted his approval to this possibility. The third post is 
that of minister for the regions and institutional reforms -- a 
position that seems bound to play a key role in the reform of 
local government that the League so keenly desires. 
  If it does not go to the League, the Interior Ministry could 
go to the National Alliance's general, Luigi Ramponi. True, the 
police would not be overjoyed to see a former chief of the 
Finance Guard, but Ramponi's past in the senior leadership of 
Sismi would be enough to grant him the necessary authority. 
Gianfranco Fini [National Alliance leader] decided not to keep 
Berlusconi in suspense any longer when he told him that he does 
not want to stand as a candidate for the prime ministership, but 
nevertheless a party that commands 13.4 percent of the vote does 
demand some visibility in government. The most likely solution 
is that the ministers of the Right will be chosen from among 
National Alliance members rather than among MSI [Italian Social 
Movement] members. Thus, Pietro Armani, formerly of the IRI 
[Institute for Industrial Reconstruction], could become foreign 
trade minister, while Publio Fiori could become labor or 
transport minister. 
  The allies of the Christian Democratic Center do not yet 
know 
whether they should negotiate with Berlusconi as an autonomous 
parliamentary group (with their 34 deputies) or as a component 
of a unified Forza Italia group. In any case, their candidates 
are ready: Clemente Mastella, formerly in the running for the 
prime ministership, is a potential defense minister, while 
Pierferdinando Casini could secure the very delicate position of 
minister of posts, and Francesco D'Onofrio is being mentioned as 
the likely minister of institutional reforms, in view of his 
recent experience. Ombretta Fumagalli Carulli is being 
mentioned again as a likely justice minister, ever since both 
Fini and Mastella discreetly vetoed Tiziana Parenti ("It is 
better that a magistrate not fill that post"). 
  The main stumbling block at the moment is the Foreign 
Ministry. Whoever fills that post must represent Italy abroad in 
the years ahead -- the center-right Italy that is already 
prompting debate in Europe and America. Someone well-known and 
reassuring is needed, a profile that does not exactly match that 
of [Radical leader] Marco Pannella, who according to some people 
is among the candidates for the post. Berlusconi seems more 
inclined to choose an "outsider," an expert diplomat such as 
former Ambassador to Moscow Sergio Romano, the commentator for 
LA STAMPA. The alternatives are General Luigi Caligaris (who 
could also become defense minister, by virtue of his 
experience), and the Liberals' Alfredo Biondi (who, however, 
seems likely to become speaker of the lower house). 
  The lion's share will of course go to Forza Italia members, 
whom Berlusconi will make responsible for implementing the 
program on which he focused his election campaign: a reduction 
in income tax, a million new jobs, and the reorganization of the 
health sector. No one is likely to deprive Antonio Martino of 
the post of finance minister, while Carlo Scognamiglio, head of 
the LUISS [International Free University of Social Studies] and 
pioneer of privatization, seems the natural candidate for 
industry minister. Giugliano Urbani, Berlusconi's much heeded 
adviser, is expected to fill a leading ministerial position, 
though no one yet knows which -- perhaps at the Interior 
Ministry? 
  As always, the greatest uncertainty concerns the economic 
ministries. For the Treasury and Budget Ministries, a number of 
names are being mentioned, including such illustrious experts as 
Lamberto Dini, President of the Bank of Italy; General State 
Accountant Andrea Monorchio; head of the Bocconi institute Mario 
Monti, and even economist Giulio Tremonti -- who, though a 
candidate on the Pact's lists, is nevertheless well regarded for 
his research on fiscal decentralization. The candidates for the 
economic ministries will probably also include the Northern 
League's top economic expert, Giancarlo Pagliarini, who was one 
of the founders of Arthur Andersen. 
  Absolutely everything in government will change. But there 
is one minister who will remain in the government, perhaps 
returning to the Health Ministry: That is the Liberals' 
Raffaele Costa, the only outgoing minister who could get back in.

  [Text] After his meeting with U.S. Secretary of State 
Warren Christopher in Washington, Spanish Foreign Minister 
Javier Solana underlined the normality of relations between the 
United States and Spain. 
  Solana said that during their meeting they covered the 
international situation and more specifically the situation in 
Bosnia and the EU [European Union] enlargement process. 
  Solana underlined that the Spanish Government is very 
concerned with the reconstruction process in Bosnia. Solana 
briefed Christopher about the EU enlargement process and added 
that the recent agreement concerning minority voting rights is a 
balanced compromise that allows the defense of Spain's 
interests. 
  Furthermore, Solana -- who is traveling on to Egypt and 
Lebanon next week -- said that the latest events in the Middle 
East meant that the peace process was going to go through a 
difficult phase. 
  Solana and Christopher also discussed various Latin American 
issues. 
  In his statements to the press in Washington, Solana said 
that the Spanish Government is awaiting an official announcement 
from the Algerian Government about its apparent decision to 
extend its territorial waters to 53 miles and to increase 
pressure on foreign boats fishing illegally in its waters. 
  The Spanish foreign minister underlined that there is no 
actual or specific Algerian document saying what this means and 
that he would rather not comment until an official declaration 
from the Algerian Government was available. Then, he added, we 
will give an appropriate answer. 
  Meanwhile, Vincente Albero, the Spanish agriculture, 
fisheries, and food minister, said that although the government 
was awaiting more information about the measure, it had told the 
European Commission about Algeria's decision to extend its 
territorial waters toward the Spanish coast.

  [Text] Ankara, Mar. 31 (A.A.) -- Ankara Chief Prosecutor 
Nazmi Sarvan said today that his office took under protection 
ballots which were found in various places and launched a 
preliminary investigation. 
  As the fundamentalist Prosperity Party emerged as the victor 
of Sunday's [27 March] local elections, huge amounts of stamped 
ballots were found in various places, casting a shadow on the 
election results. 
  Sarvar told the Anatolian Agency that experts were to 
examine 
the authenticity of the ballots and will also receive the 
testimonies of officials who were on duty at the precincts 
during the election. 
  "The necessary announcement will be made at the end of the 
investigation," he said.

  [Text] Paris, March 31 (AFP) -- A group of Bosnian business 
leaders came to Paris Thursday [31 March] looking for help in 
rebuilding Bosnia-Herzegovina's economy, following a peace deal 
bringing Moslems and Croats together in a new federation. 
  Everything needs to be rebuilt in that devastated country, 
making Bosnia the biggest market in the world for public works, 
President of the Sarajevo Chamber of Commerce Mensur Smajlovic 
said Thursday. 
  A cooperation agreement was signed Thursday by Smajlovic and 
his Paris counterpart Bernard Cambournac to help the ravaged 
economy and the emergence of a private sector. 
  Projects should include cooperation in trade and 
manufacture, 
the transfer of engineering and banking know-how, advice to 
companies on reorientating themselves to Western markets, and 
training programmes. 
  Further talks were expected Thursday evening with French 
companies at a meeting organised by the employers' confederation 
CNPF. 
  A group of French industrialists is due to visit Sarajevo in 
the next few weeks to assess priorities, with advice from the 
French military which has a large presence in Bosnia's UN 
Protection Force. 
  A delegation has already been sent by the French ministry of 
defence to work out ways of assessing damage quickly, a ministry 
official said. 
  Thursday's Paris visit also came a day after the United 
Nations named the American William Eagleton as international 
coordinator for reconstruction of Bosnia-Herzegovina. 
  The Bosnian delegation, invited to Paris by French Defence 
Minister Francois Leotard, outlined the terrible toll taken by 
three years of economic blockade and two years of war. 
  Smajlovic estimated the loss to the country's gross domestic 
product at more than $15 billion and the loss of world exports 
at $5 billion over three years. 
  In Sarajevo alone, 500,000 apartments have been destroyed 
and 
most roads, bridges, tunnels and water supply systems in the 
republic are unusable. Several hundred factories are also out 
of use. 
  Damage on the railways is put at between $300 and 500 
million. Rebuilding the most important line, between Sarajevo 
and Ploce, would cost around $15 million, he said. 
  The director-general of Bosnian telecommunications, Hajrudin 
Suman, put the damage to the telephone network at a total $2.5 
billion. Around $100 million worth of aid has already allowed 
some parts of the system to go back into operation, he said.

<F P=106> [Report by Beatrice Taupin: "First Job -- A Bonus Replaces </F>
the Youth Job Training Contract"] 
  [Excerpts] Without waiting for Tuesday's government 
statement to the National Assembly on youth employment, 
announced by Nicolas Sarkozy, the government spokesman, after 
the Council of Ministers meeting, the Matignon [prime minister's 
office] yesterday decided to abandon the CIP [Job Training 
Contract] and unveiled an alternative measure. The government 
has proposed granting aid to companies "employing, for a minimum 
of 18 months, a young person who has never before had a stable 
job." This aid, paid over nine months, will be worth 1,000 
French francs [Fr] per month. It will be doubled for any young 
people taken on before 1 October. A decree will implement the 
measure as of next week. 
  The prime minister made his decision after discussions with 
the employment minister and after hearing the report of 
discussions held by Michel Bon with the social partners. 
[passage omitted] 
<H5>  Cost of Fr6 Billion </H5>
  The National Council of French Employers [CNPF], whose hobby 
horse is lowering labor costs, also approves of this measure: 
"This clear and simple decision eliminates all ambiguity 
concerning the levels of payment and the nature of any possible 
training. In our eyes, it is a serious factor in calming the 
concerns expressed by young people." 
  With the exception of the Workers' Force union [FO], which 
contests the very principle of lowering wage costs, a fairly 
general consensus is being reached on how to reduce charges 
which, moreover, was also gone into by the Five-Year Plan [on 
employment]. Since it is not now possible to directly alter 
wages, the only alternative is to give aid to the companies -- 
whatever the cost. 
  The cost of the measures announced yesterday is evaluated at 
around Fr6 billion in 1994 for 500,000 young people. No details 
were given as to the source of this funding, which will further 
widen the budget deficit, unless the windfall from privatization 
is used, as it has been to recapitalize certain public companies! 
  By deciding to grant a fixed sum for everyone entering their 
first job, whether or not they are qualified, the government is 
steering clear of the pitfall of segregating young people, while 
nevertheless favoring the low-paid. However, it is risking the 
job placement of older workers, as occurred with Martine Aubry's 
Exo-Jeunes scheme. However, the government undoubtedly has no 
other alternative.

<F P=106> [Report by Marielle Court: "Youth Job Training Contract To </F>
Be Replaced by New Law"] 
  [Text] Back to square one! While the CIP [Job Training 
Contract] has not been officially suspended, Employment Minister 
Michel Giraud, speaking yesterday to the parliamentary committee 
on the five-year law, announced that "new legislative measures" 
on employment will be adopted. 
  The minister stated that the aim is "to reconsider the job 
training contract. We are envisaging adopting a different 
approach which can only come through parliamentary debate." 
Shortly before this, Charles Million, president of the 
Rhone-Alpes regional council, and Michel Pericard, president of 
the Assembly's Social Committee, had both asked for a new 
employment law, the latter stressing that "only a law can undo a 
law." 
  Michel Bon has continued to consult with trade union 
organizations in drafting the proposal which will then serve as 
the basis for the law. On several occasions, the director 
general of the ANPE [National Employment Agency] has repeated: 
"At the moment, I am listening," and has refused to comment 
further. The CFDT [French Democratic Confederation of Labor], 
however, stated at the end of the meeting "that it will not 
accept a new measure that forces young people to pay a job 
entrance fee," and said that it was "completely opposed to the 
ANPE-youth project: There is no reason to apply a measure that 
would discriminate against young people." 
  The CGC [General Confederation of Executives] was dancing to 
the same tune, asking for a "contract for the integration of 
young people into the labor market," as was the CFTC [French 
Confederation of Christian Workers], which considers it 
essential that "we avoid any confusion between training and the 
activity of integration." 
  At the end of the day -- when Michel Bon was meeting with 
the 
employers' organizations -- a certain degree of unanimity 
seemed, in any event, to have been reached among the social 
partners, recalling that they had signed a document proposing 
"contracts for guidance, adaptation, and qualification," and 
increasing exemptions on social charges for employing young 
people.

  [Text] Paris, March 31 (AFP) -- A total of 48 policemen 
were wounded, seven hospitalised, and 300 people arrested as 
marches Thursday [31 March] to celebrate victory over Prime 
Minister Edouard Balladur ended in violence, police said. 
  Two of the policemen were stabbed, officials said. 
  More than 200 vehicles were damaged, a dozen fires started 
as 
several groups of marchers got out of control, smashing up to 
sixty shop front windows and looting several shops, police said. 
  The rallies were called to celebrate a climbdown by Balladur 
over a cut-price youth wage scheme. Police estimated the number 
of Paris marchers at 26,000. 
  "Despite repeated appeals from the organisers and the 
security forces for people to disperse, several hundred 
individuals refused to leave," police said in a statement. 
  In Nantes in western France, up to a thousand youths were 
continuing to confront police late Thursday after several hours 
of head-on battles. 
  Earlier, around 20,000 people had marched through the town, 
organizers said, though the police put the figure at 16,000. 
  One person had been arrested and several shop fronts had 
been 
smashed in the clashes, police sources said. 
  Police charged the demonstrators and scattered many of them 
with tear gas cannisters and water cannon.

<F P=106> [Report by Jacques Fleury: "Rally for the Republic Calls </F>
For Giraud's Head"] 
  [Excerpt] [Prime Minister] Edouard Balladur yesterday 
decided purely and simply to withdraw the "youth job training 
contract" [CIP] and to replace it with a scheme giving aid to 
companies providing young people with their first job. 
Moreover, he announced that an interministerial committee on 
youth would be held on 26 April. The withdrawal of the CIP is 
aimed at calming social unrest -- a demonstration will be held 
this afternoon in Paris in response to a call made by all the 
trade union organizations -- and also at placating the anger 
being manifested by the majority. 
  While in principle you do not change a winning team, it is 
nonetheless necessary, for reasons of appeasement, to change one 
that is losing. What is true in sport is also true in politics. 
On the eve of the Paris demonstration against the CIP, the 
deputies of the majority, and in particular those of the RPR, 
brandished pitchforks and pickaxes to pillory the ministers they 
hold responsible for the street demonstrations and the 
increasing ill-humor of the French people. As they see it, at 
least one head must roll: that of Labor Minister Michel 
Giraud, who stands accused of having inflamed the universities 
and the suburbs with his "controversial" decrees instituting the 
CIP. [passage omitted]

  [Text] Paris, March 31 (AFP) -- Rail workers in the CGT 
[General Confederation of Labor] labor confederation have called 
on employees of the national SNCF [French National Railroad 
Company] rail system to stage protest actions on April 7 to 
defend employment, the CGT Federation announced on Thursday [31 
March]. 
  It said the forms of the protests were to be discussed 
locally, but could include work stoppages. 
  Referring to protests by French young people against a 
government plan for low-wage youth employment, now dropped, the 
CGT communique said that "By acting to halt job cuts" at the 
SNCF and "in defending the future of rail facilities," the rail 
workers "are carrying on a struggle similar to the one waged by 
young people, who demand only the right to live and the right to 
stable and useful employment."

Thursday [31 March] at a nuclear research center in southern 
France left four people injured but there was no radiation leak, 
officials said. 
  They said the explosion occurred in a building where an 
ageing experimental nuclear reactor was being taken apart. 
There was no danger of radioactive contamination, they added.

<F P=106> [Report by Dominique Garaud: "Death on Board Nuclear </F>
Submarine Emeraude"] 
  [Text] French nuclear-powered attack submarines [SNA] 
really have been dogged by bad luck. Until now, however, the 
SNA accidents have not had fatal consequences. Yesterday 
morning, at 1045 [0845 GMT], 10 submariners were in the SNA 
Emeraude's turbo alternator compartment. According to Rear 
Admiral Philippe Roy of the Naval Chiefs-of-Staff, the reasons 
are still not clear: "A leak occurred. The immediate reaction 
was the isolation of the cooling circuits. Steam poured into 
the compartment and the 10 seamen were killed by asphyxiation or 
burns." The explosion of one of the two condensers projected 
steam at 250 degrees and 45 bars of pressure, and would have 
resulted in instant death. 
  According to initial data released, the explosion caused no 
damage to the vsessel's structure and the disaster was 
restricted to the compartment protected by two airlocks. The 
Defense Ministry stated: "This accident in no way calls into 
question the nuclear safety of the vessel." The 48-megawatt 
nuclear reactor located next to the compartment is itself 
contained in a sealed-off area. When the accident occurred, it 
shut down automatically and was cooled by its own primary 
circuit. Unlike missile-launching submarines [SNLE], SNAs are 
equipped with only conventional weaponry. 
  According to Rear Admiral Roy, the 10 submariners killed 
"were from all personnel staff." The victims included two 
officers. While normally the turbo alternator compartment is 
only subject to routine inspection, yesterday the Emeraude's 
crew was carrying out a "section inspection" which is done at 
six-monthly intervals on all naval vessels in the presence of 
the captain or his second-in-command. According to a source 
cited by AFP, the Emeraude's captain was among the victims, 
although no conscripts were killed. 
  The Emeraude has a crew of 66, including eight officers and 
two conscripts. Like all submarines, it has two crews, termed 
"red" and "blue," alternating for periods of six weeks at a 
time. Together with the SNLEs, part of the nuclear deterrent 
force, the mission of the SNA's is to sweep the seas and oceans 
to flush out intruders and, using highly-sophisticated 
equipment, to monitor the activities of other vessels. 
  The incident took place during an exercise with surface 
vessels (Casex, in NATO jargon), 50 nautical miles off Toulon in 
the south of Corsica. Diving when the explosion occurred, the 
Emeraude managed to make it back up to the surface. The bodies 
of the victims were winched off by helicopter to one of the 
accompanying frigates and then flown back in a helicopter to 
Toulon. The Emeraude returned to Toulon yesterday evening at 
low speed (four to five knots, instead of the normal 25 knots), 
propelled by a backup electric engine. 
  A legal inquiry and a Naval Command inquest have been 
opened. 
At the same time, the Navy has decided to inspect the other 
five SNAs currently in service. Three of these are out on 
missions, two in the Mediterranean and one in the Atlantic. 
They have been recalled to Toulon. 
  The Navy is already denying any comparison with the 
accidents 
on the SNAs Rubis in August 1993 and Amethyst last March. In 
both cases, these incidents were collisions which can probably 
be attributed to navigational errors and which have already 
resulted in reprimands. In the case of the Emeraude, it will be 
necessary to determine the basic cause of the problem, 
unprecedented on this type of vessel which has been in service 
for six years. 
  Defense Minister Francois Leotard visited Toulon yesterday, 
accompanied by the head of the Naval Chiefs-of-Staff, Alain 
Coaranea. He reiterated that "there is no nuclear risk." 
Stressing that the French people had to be informed of the 
"responsibilities and the technical causes" of the accident, he 
indicated that the conclusions of the inquiries will be made 
public.

claiming responsibility for the commando action at Sperone 
(Southern Corsica) during which 14 people were arrested. 
According to the statement there is "no question of giving up

  As far as the FLNC is concerned the Sperone tourist complex 
is "one of the symbols of the despoilment of Corsican land by a 
speculators' mafia."

<F P=106> [Report by Alexandra Schwartzbrodt: "Future Large Aircraft </F>
Expected To Be Included in Military Programming Law"] 
  [Text] After long months of procrastination, the Defense 
Ministry is said to have decided that the European FLA [Future 
Large Aircraft] transport plane, currently at the feasibility 
study stage, will be included in the 1995-2000 military 
programming law. Given the election schedule, this decision does 
not really commit the current authorities in that no financing 
is needed in 1995. A few hundred million French francs [Fr] 
will, however, be assigned to defining the aircraft's 
specifications in 1996, with development planned in the second 
half of the period covered by the law. 
  The aim of this move is to profit from the time lapse to 
reduce the specifications as far as possible and thus reduce the 
cost of the aircraft, and then to launch the program as part of 
a Franco-German cooperation project within the scope of the 
Airbus consortium. In this way, they hope to attract the 
participation of Britain, which needs 60 such aircraft. This 
project was agreed on in principle last weekend in Berlin by 
General Arms Delegate Henri Conze and the head of the Joint 
Chiefs-of-Staff, Jacques Lanxade, at a meeting with their German 
counterparts, Joerg Schoenbohm and Klaus Naumann. They are also 
said to have come to an agreement on lowering the cost of the 
NH-90 European helicopter and, above all, on initiating a 
process of closer Franco-German cooperation with regard to a 
European antimissile defense program. 
  The launch of the FLA is considered by many French and 
German 
figures to be essential, starting with French Democratic 
Union-Republican Party [UDF-PR] deputy for the Var region, 
Arthur Paecht who, in a report published last February on the 
subject, argued that a large part of Europe's aeronautics sector 
depended on this aircraft being built. Moreover, it is no 
coincidence that the Airbus consortium is being considered to 
host the project. The aim is to feed the production chains that 
are running out of steam and draw maximum benefit from the 
experience built up in the civil domain in order to save on 
costly development work. The FLA is, in addition, one of the 
rare programs that make it possible to lay the foundations for a 
real project for Franco-German cooperation and, over and above 
that, to supply the joint agency set up by Henri Conze. While 
the cost of the aircraft will be minimal between 1995 and 2000, 
it may be likely to present a major financing problem at the 
turn of the century, when FLA production will clash with the 
delivery of and, above all, the payment for the Rafale fighter 
aircraft. The recent decision by Euroflag, the European 
consortium in charge of the project, to opt for a turboprop 
aircraft will scarcely contribute to reducing its cost. There 
is currently no suitable engine available "off the shelf," and 
Europe will have to begin development of a new program.

  [Text] Paris, April 1 (AFP) -- French Defence Minister 
Francois Leotard on Thursday [31 March] asked a dozen public and 
private armaments businesses to cut equipment costs as France 
finalises its military spending programme for 1995-2000. 
  The demand for "an effort to control industrial costs," made 
at a ministry dinner, was well received by the industrialists, 
ministry officials said. 
  French arms manufacturers recognise that Defence Ministry's 
equipment orders are "exceptional" by comparison with other 
European countries -- more than 104 billion francs (18 billion 
dollars) in 1994 -- and that the ministry supports their export 
efforts, the officials said. 
  A new bill on military programming is to be presented to 
parliament shortly, with 613 billion francs (107 billion 
dollars) dedicated to equipment spending over six years, the 
sources added. 
  However the sum is not expected to cover the spending needed 
for all present programmes and Leotard called for discussions 
between military chiefs, armaments officials and industrialists 
over how to make economies. 
  "The arms industry is going to be confronted by the fact 
that 
previously armaments programmes were launched every 10 years and 
now it will be every 20 years," Leotard said. 
  Among areas considered for cutbacks, the European NH-90 
transport helicopter is likely to face a 20-30 percent reduction 
in costs from a total of more than nine billion francs. 
  Defence industry groups commented Thursday that they had 
already made major efforts to control costs by reducing their 
workforce, reorganising their production and seeking alliances 
with other European manufacturers.

  [Text] Bucharest, April 1 (AFP) -- North Korea's 
unwillingness to allow inspections of its nuclear installations 
could leave the country very isolated, the International Atomic 
Energy Agency [IAEA] warned in the Romanian capital Friday [1 
April]. 
  "Without nuclear transparency, there will not be confidence 
in the outside world, and I'm sure isolation will increase if 
there is a lack of confidence in their nuclear programme," IAEA 
director general Hans Blix said Friday at a press conference 
during a four-day visit to Romania. 
  The warning, the latest during a long standoff on the issue, 
came after the UN Security Council Thursday urged Pyongyang to 
allow international inspections of suspect nuclear facilities, 
saying the Vienna-based IAEA should report back on compliance. 
  Foreign observers fear that the country, one of the last 
hardline communist regimes, is developing a military nuclear 
capability under the cover of its energy programme. 
  Blix said that if North Korea responded favourably to the UN 
request, he was ready to take up inspections again if they could 
be carried out in a "thorough" manner. "I hope they will be 
ready to do it," said Blix. 
  Allowing IAEA access was not a "privilege" to the Agency but 
a "service" to the country which would allow it to dispel 
suspicions, he added. 
  During a mission at the start of March, IAEA experts were 
stopped from taking samples at a radiochemical laboratory in 
Yongbyon, around 100 kilometres (60 miles) from Pyongyang. 
  In Tokyo, French Foreign Minister Alain Juppe dismissed 
North 
Korea's attitude over inspections of its nuclear installations 
as "unacceptable." 
  Juppe, who raised the issue in talks with Prime Minister 
Morihiro Hosokawa, told a press conference that Pyongyang's 
attitude was "unacceptable and greatly increased the risk of 
(nuclear) proliferation."

<F P=106> [Article signed WVDV: "French Prime Minister Balladur </F>
Questioning Van den Brande About Anchoring: Mitterrand Mainly 
Concerned About Future of European Union"] 
  [Excerpts] In a sun-drenched Paris yesterday, Flemish 
Minister-President Luc Van den Brande was welcomed by France's 
two political leaders: Prime Minister Edouard Balladur and 
President Francois Mitterrand. With Balladur, Van den Brande 
mainly talked about the Flemish anchoring, an issue which was 
brought up by the French prime minister himself. Mitterrand was 
more concerned about the future of the European Union (EU). 
[passage omitted] 
  As announced, the new Belgian reality was an important item 
on the agenda. "Balladur and Mitterrand took due note of the 
new federal Belgium, but clearly stated that it is not up to 
them to express their opinion on the subject," Van den Brande 
said later on during a meeting with Flemish journalists. "The 
federal Belgium is recognized by them," he added. 
  Van den Brande also discussed the matter of the Flemish 
anchoring with both French leaders. Balladur raised the matter 
spontaneously, the Flemish minister-president said. "I made 
things clear to him by giving an example. Would it be 
acceptable if France Telecom were taken over by British 
Telecom?" So was there any sympathy for the Flemish anchoring? 
"Balladur was very well informed about the issue. I also 
reminded him that the idea of anchoring is a French idea. The 
examples that I gave spoke volumes," Van den Brande said. 
  Mitterrand spontaneously expressed his concern about the 
future of the EU. He did so because of the problems which 
arose with regard to the voting procedures in the enlarged EU. 
"He is extremely worried that the enlargement might jeopardize 
the EU achievements," Van den Brande added. [passage omitted] 
  In addition, Van den Brande approached his counterparts 
about 
the possibilities of practical cooperation in projects 
throughout Central and East Europe as well as in the border 
regions. [passage omitted]

<F P=106> [Interview with Budget Minister Herbert Van Rompuy, Flemish </F>
Christian People's Party chairman, by Guy Daloze and Pierre 
Loppe; place and date not given: "The Budget and the `Affairs'"] 
  [Excerpts] 
<H5>  Reconquering Hearts and Spirits </H5>
  [LA LIBRE BELGIQUE] There is the risk of a political problem 
arising: We may have to find another prime minister. What do 
you think of a European career for Prime Minister Jean-Luc 
Dehaene? 
  [Van Rompuy] No comment. 
  [LA LIBRE BELGIQUE] If necessary, could you succeed Dehaene? 
  [Van Rompuy] Become a colleague of Berlusconi? [laughs] No 
comment. I will be seeing Dehaene after the Easter holidays, 
but still, I am not going to give him my advice now through 
other people. 
  [LA LIBRE BELGIQUE] Our polls show that the CVP [Christian 
People's Party] is recovering. 
  [Van Rompuy] I am pleased.... Two things are coming 
together. First, the fate of the CVP has always been linked with 
the fate of the government. The government has been doing 
better in recent months since it implemented its global plan and 
refused to give in to pressure. Second, we have been able to 
manage a transition of renewal in the CVP. I have accepted my 
responsibilities, and I think I have played a major role in 
helping us get over the crisis. I think I was right, even in 
the choice of prime minister. I sparked the renewal of the 
party which, as I had wanted, can only come through renewing the 
personnel. 
  [LA LIBRE BELGIQUE] Do you think you will again catch up 
with 
the Flemish Liberal Democrats (VLD)? 
  [Van Rompuy] The European elections are very important. I am 
confident, and if the CVP could remain the leading party in 
Belgium, it would be a psychological blow for the Liberals. 
Today they are so euphoric and arrogant, as if the country 
belonged to them (with just 15 percent of the national vote in 
the polls). 
  [LA LIBRE BELGIQUE] Are the traditional political parties 
capable of withstanding the "affairs?" Is not a major upheaval 
necessary? 
  [Van Rompuy] You should see what remains of this upheaval in 
Italy. It makes me shudder to see that the fascists look likely 
to be included in the government.... 
  However, there are other trends: In the French regional 
elections, the alternative parties were unsuccessful. 
  The traditional parties must be aware that we are going 
through a very serious period of crisis in political legitimacy. 
They have to reconquer hearts and spirits and once more give 
people confidence in the system with a series of global measures 
for renewal. The political system must abandon its immobility 
and its feeling of ingratitude and conspiracy (the feeling that 
"everyone is against us"). Of course, there are excesses and, 
when I see the Flemish press printing complete lies, I am 
shocked that people are being discredited merely to improve 
circulation figures and to make money. However, I also know that 
there are serious files implicating the worlds of politics, 
insurance and trade unionism, and the worst thing we could do is 
deny the existence of these problems. 
  The people must see that we are ready for change. The 
current climate is the worst, since no one knows what the future 
holds in store. An economic crisis could strengthen extremist 
reactions and if, at that time, democracy is not entrenched 
sufficiently with the population, certain elements could profit 
from the situation. 
  [LA LIBRE BELGIQUE] The opinion of the Central Committee on 
Competition is worrying. What political conclusions can you 
draw? 
  [Van Rompuy] The situation is perhaps not as alarming as 
people make out. The National Bank does have a significant 
balance of payments surplus. We should therefore relativize the 
"share of the market" reasoning. Let's wait for September's 
report. The government has recently decided on the global plan. 
We must assess its effects and impact on the economy at the 
beginning of fall. It is still too early. 
  [LA LIBRE BELGIQUE] The measures proposed in the plan have 
been affected by measures taken in other countries, and 
especially the wage moderation granted in Germany.... 
  [Van Rompuy] Yes, but with the notable difference that in 
Belgium we had to impose moderation.... 
  [LA LIBRE BELGIQUE] What do you think of the divisions among 
your partners on this crucial subject? 
  [Van Rompuy] Since October, the consensus has been that the 
economy is in serious crisis. This is always the case when 
harsh measures have to be taken. The situation has worsened 
since the failure of the social pact. 
  [LA LIBRE BELGIQUE] Do you think that the Belgian social 
model is threatened? 
  [Van Rompuy] In a time of crisis the threat is always there. 
Remember that in 1981 an interprofessional agreement was signed 
imposing a wage freeze. Two months later, [former Prime 
Minister] Martens launched an additional rescue plan. In 1982, 
when the currency was devalued, no social agreement was 
achieved. In such cases, it is up to the government, as 
guardian of the common interest, to take action. 
  [LA LIBRE BELGIQUE] Will Dehaene's team accept its 
responsibilities? Will it do so in September? 
  [Van Rompuy] Everything will depend on the new opinion of 
the 
Central Committee and the attitude of the social partners. Will 
they manage to reach an agreement this time? They will have a 
month to do so. After that, we will intervene. 
  [LA LIBRE BELGIQUE] If the current scenario were to occur 
again, would you act.... 
  [Van Rompuy] We are obliged to by law.... 
  [LA LIBRE BELGIQUE] Do you share the relative optimism of 
the 
governor of the National Bank who considers that we are "out of 
the crisis?" 
  [Van Rompuy] I was the first to say so! Our darkest postwar 
year was 1993. In December, the Bank recorded its first jump, 
which was then confirmed in January and February. Technically, 
it is true, we are out of recession, but with 1 percent in 1994 
we are not yet on the road to normal growth. Employment only 
takes off again when the economy has recovered. By the end of 
1994, I would like to see a reduction in the federal debt 
accompanied by the first signs of an improvement in the 
employment situation. Until now, our crime is that we have been 
over-pessimistic. We have forgotten that there is an economic 
cycle.... 
  [LA LIBRE BELGIQUE] Hearing you speak, anyone would think 
the 
employers have been overdramatizing things.... 
  [Van Rompuy] The Belgian Employers' Federation (FEB) is 
still 
dominated by a few major industrial groups who are justifiably 
concerned. I do not want to accuse anyone merely on the basis 
of assumptions, but the employers know full well that the public 
authorities can impose measures. It is therefore in their best 
interests to dramatize the situation. 
  [LA LIBRE BELGIQUE] Positive discourse can also help get us 
out of difficulty.... 
  [Van Rompuy] Very true! We can see a note of confidence 
returning to consumers and investors. If we have to point out 
what is going badly, to be truthful we also have to say what is 
going well. Crisis is also a psychological thing. 
  [LA LIBRE BELGIQUE] Is it to avoid compromising the recovery 
that the government implemented such a "soft" budgetary control? 
  [Van Rompuy] The social pact, which guided my actions in the 
government, has turned into the global plan. We have listened, 
but we have also stood up to them. We have not given in. The 
country has felt governed despite the various malaises. 
  Look at the figures. The difference between income and 
expenditure is 17 billion Belgian francs [BFr], while the 
reduction target is BFr60 billion. With the global plan, the 
measures applied on 1 April, and the slow economic recovery, it 
would be unreasonable to take further measures affecting 
spending power. Budgetary control has made it possible to 
resolve the problems without overdramatization. The new 
technique has borne fruit. We will consider the budget for 1995 
in the summer. Everything will depend on changes in the 
short-term interest rate. This has yet to reach its lowest 
level. The government is banking on 6 percent. Maybe we will 
go below that, with a stronger franc. [passage omitted]. 
  [LA LIBRE BELGIQUE] You are starting to plan the 1995 
budget. 
You also mentioned the economic and psychological aspects of 
budgetary control. In July, a third aspect will come into play, 
a political aspect with the approach of the local elections. 
That will expose you taking an even "softer" approach. 
  [Van Rompuy] We will see when the time comes. We must 
consider the economic situation. Let me also point out one 
thing: The budget will be worked out between the European and 
local elections. 
  [LA LIBRE BELGIQUE] It will, then, be a difficult budget, 
politically speaking. 
  [Van Rompuy] Everything depends on the gap we will have to 
make up. 
  [LA LIBRE BELGIQUE] Will you ask the towns and the regions 
to 
contribute to this effort? Some people are reluctant.... 
  [Van Rompuy] They will have to make the efforts determined 
by 
the High Finance Committee. However, we live in a system where 
there is no hierarchy of standards, and where the executives and 
assemblies act totally independently. They therefore will have 
to participate in the effort of their own free will. We agreed 
that the different bodies would work together, and that there 
will be no disputes over the figures and the method if the 
Finance Committee issues a new opinion. Everyone then will have 
to accept their responsibilities, and we will see who is 
responsible if we do not respect the standards laid down in the 
Maastricht Treaty. The increase in spending of the towns and 
regions considerably exceeds the spending of the federal 
authority and even social security spending, which is a 
situation that cannot be allowed to continue in the future. Of 
tax and nontax revenue, 60 percent is kept by the federal 
authority while BFR40 billion goes to the towns, regions, and 
social security. However, public opinion seems to think that it 
is the federal authority that receives the full weight of the 
increase in taxation. We are justified in feeling a little 
frustrated.

Respect Human Rights"] 
  [Text] Brussels, 31 Mar (BELGA) -- Following the arrest 
last week in Turkey of six Turkish deputies of Kurdish origin 
and the lifting of their immunity, the European Union (EU) 
states, in a press release published in Brussels, "that the 
right to freely express your ideas is a fundamental liberty for 
all, a fortiori for members of Parliament." 
  The EU points out that "this right also forms the basis for 
parliamentary immnunity of representatives elected in democratic 
states." 
  More generally, the EU expresses in this text its "concern" 
at the worsening human rights situation in Turkey and states 
that "the fight against terrorism must be conducted with full 
respect for the law and human rights." 
  The EU wants to renew its "appeal in favor of a political 
solution to the problems posed in south-east Turkey" and is 
earnestly requesting the Turkish Government "to honor its 
commitments regarding constitutional reforms in the field of 
human rights."

<F P=106> [Unattributed article: "OECD/Hungary Hungarians Sign Up To </F>
Chemicals Safety Programme"; as released by Brussels EUROPEAN 
REPORT] 
  [Text] Hungary has just signed up to the part of the 
Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development's 
Chemicals Programme involving Good Laboratory Practice and the 
Mutual Acceptance of Data on chemicals safety testing. 
Hungary's agreement to participate in this important chemicals 
safety cooperative effort puts it on an equal footing with OECD 
member countries and brings advantages to both Hungary and OECD 
member countries. For instance, members of the 24-nation 
Western club will be able to establish and maintain the 
appropriate formal contacts and information exchange procedures 
with the Hungarian laboratory practice monitoring authorities. 
This, says the OECD Secretariat, will "underpin confidence in 
the Hungarian compliance monitoring programme necessary to 
assure OECD member countries of the quality of data generated in 
Hungarian laboratories." As a consequence, much-needed further 
testing capacity will be opened for use by OECD member countries 
and their industries, which can be confident that data generated 
in Hungary will be accepted in OECD member countries. Since June 
1991, Hungary has been participating in the OECD's Partners in 
Transition Programmes, one section of which involves taking part 
as an observer in numerous committees and other subsidiary 
bodies.

prospect of the Paris conference of 26-27 May," (the official 
launching of that initiative) stated to a Romanian press 
correspondent in Brussels the Belgian deputy premier and foreign 
minister Willy Claes. 
  In a statement made after his departure to Sofia and 
Bucharest where he is expected to pay formal visits over 6-9 
April, the Brussels head of diplomacy stressed that "Belgium 
follows attentively the process of reform and privatisation in 
Romania." 
  In a gesture "with a symbol value for the joint cultural 
values of our united Europe" and as an undeniable illustration 
of the special friendly character of the visit, Willy Claes, who 
is also a talented musician, will conduct a concert of the 
Romanian radio symphonic orchestra. 
  Belgian and Romanian sources in Brussels are noting among 
other things "the double character of the visit, the bilateral 
and the European one," as well as its "considerable" duration, 
taking into account the busy schedule of the Belgian deputy 
premier who is also the acting president of the Ministerial 
Committee of the Council of Europe. 
  According to the same sources, Belgium "is aware of the 
economic and social difficulties implied by the Romanian 
transition, but it is determined to reassert -- through its head 
of diplomacy -- its support, as to its possibilities, for a 
democratic and European Romania."

<F P=106> [Article signed RKX: "Tobback Criticizes New Netherlands </F>
Asylum Policy"] 
  [Text] The Hague, 1 Apr (ANP) -- The tightened-up 
Netherlands policy on asylum amounts to a panic measure. These 
were the crushing words aimed at the Netherlands Cabinet by 
Belgian Interior Minister Louis Tobback on Friday [1 April] in 
an interview with Netherlands radio. Tobback, who is the 
Belgian coordinator for asylum-related policy, does not believe 
it is realistic on the part of the Netherlands Cabinet to try 
and send asylum seekers back to the respective country which 
first took them in, which is often Belgium. Moreover, he says 
that he is certainly prepared to consult with both the 
Netherlands and Germany on the possibility of an early entry 
into force of the Schengen Accord. In the Netherlands, the 
population appears to be convinced that the government cannot 
cope with the asylum problem any longer, that the government no 
longer has the situation under control, and that the problem is 
getting out of hand, claims Tobback. Consequently, he warns the 
Netherlands Government about this, saying: "If that is the 
case, then you are lost, because that is when panic reactions 
occur; then you will have extremist reactions." 
  Tobback claims that sending asylum seekers back to the 
country which first took them in is neither a tenable nor a 
workable solution. Furthermore, he does not want to let himself 
to be tied down to such an approach by the Netherlands. "Anyone 
who reaches Belgium via an overland route comes from either 
France or Germany, or from the Netherlands or Luxembourg. So, I 
can send all those asylum seekers back again straight away, 
because only 5 percent of all asylum seekers arrive at Zaventem 
Airport. No more than that. So you see, that is one extreme of 
the argument. In this way, we will always only be passing them 
on to the next country." 
  The plan drawn up by Netherlands Secretary of State for 
Justice Kosto to have flying brigades operating behind the 
borders, was also forcefully rejected by Tobback. According to 
him, such flying brigades will not help matters. "If one of us 
takes action against illegal immigrants, then the other will 
merely find themselves saddled with more illegal immigrants." 
  Tobback's criticism comes a few days after Netherlands 
Development Aid Minister Pronk -- albeit in slightly less 
caustic tones -- openly criticized the policy of the Netherlands 
Cabinet. Pronk also spoke of a panicky policy, saying that 
although he appreciated that the more foreigners come to the 
Netherlands, the more supervision is required, "if you suddenly 
start talking about much more than just 1,000 extra policemen, 
then you are going to give rise to the impression of some sort 
of panic that definitely will occur."

<F P=106> [David McKittrick article: "Major Given Hint of More </F>
Concessions by Sinn Fein"] 
  [Text] Sinn Fein leaders used yesterday's traditional 
Easter platforms to hint that more republican concessions might 
be on the way if the British government responded to this week's 
three-day IRA ceasefire. 
  With the limited ceasefire due to come into effect at 
midnight tomorrow both Gerry Adams and Martin McGuinness called 
on London to end the present stalemate by agreeing to direct 
talks with Sinn Fein. 
  Both used the current republican buzzword -- "potential" -- 
to plant the suggestion that a new situation would result from a 
decision by John Major to clarify aspects of the Downing Street 
Declaration. 
  Mr Major's dismissal of the ceasefire as a cynical exercise 
has been contradicted by some nationalist leaders. In 
particular Dr Cahal Daly, the Catholic Primate of All-Ireland, 
has urged the Government to regard the ceasefire as a genuine 
effort by the IRA, and to attempt to build on it. 
  Mr Adams, speaking at a Belfast rally, was at pains to deny 
that the republican call for clarification was a ploy to get 
into negotiations. He declared: "We have questions to ask of 
London and we require direct dialogue, not protracted 
deliberations or negotiations." 
  There is as yet no public sign of movement from the British 
side on this demand. The Irish government, which is showing 
increasing signs of impatience and disillusion with the ability 
of Mr Adams to deliver the republican movement, has bolstered 
the British position by refraining from echoing the call from Dr 
Daly. 
  Dick Spring, the Irish foreign minister, said he did not 
believe direct talks between the British government and Sinn 
Fein were possible. He said: "We are very disappointed at the 
IRA's token gesture. We believe that we have made enormous 
efforts over the last number of months. I don't see any 
prospect of a meeting between the British Government and Sinn 
Fein at this stage." 
  A statement from Downing Street reiterated the Government's 
position: "What is needed is not a three-day ceasefire, after 
which the killing would begin again, but a permanent end to 
violence." 
  At the same time, no one knows all of what is going on 
behind 
the scenes at this moment. There will almost certainly be 
surreptitious activity from potential go-betweens anxious to 
bridge the gap and move the peace process along. 
  Logistical considerations within the IRA probably preclude 
an 
extension of this week's ceasefire, which is scheduled to end at 
midnight on Friday. Sinn Fein has already made it fairly clear, 
however, that It accepts that no early London move towards 
clarification is likely. The impression is being given, 
however, that a break in the clarification stalemate could 
create new opportunities. 
  Mr Adams gave an interesting insight into republican 
analysis 
when he declared: "The British may not yet be planning to leave 
Ireland. But they will. I am firmly convinced that they can be 
persuaded to end the union and to do so in a manner which will 
permit all of the people of Ireland to come to agreement on a 
new and stable society on this island." 
  Because of this, he said, republicans need not be in a 
defensive mindset, and should seek to maintain the political 
offensive. If these issues were addressed properly, he said, 
then substantial progress was possible.

<F P=106> [Liam Clarke report: "Hume Presses Major To Call Sinn Fein </F>
Bluff"] 
  [Text] John Hume, leader Of the Social Democratic and 
Labour party, yesterday urged John Major to call Sinn Fein's 
bluff by agreeing to its demands for a clarification of the 
Downing Street declaration. 
  Hume, whose talks with Gerry Adams, the Sinn Fein leader, 
opened up the latest peace process, said that if the party was 
shown to be bluffing he would turn his back on it and ensure 
Sinn Fein's total isolation from democratic politics. 
  The veteran nationalist leader said there were two possible 
consequences if the government agreed to Sinn Fein's demand. 
"One is a total cessation of violence with all its enormous 
positive consequences or, as some people believe but I don't, if 
Sinn Fein is bluffing then its bluff will have been called and 
it will be isolated in a way it has never been before." 
  Hume said he was disappointed that the ceasefire, due to 
last 
from Tuesday to Thursday, was so short. "I wanted a complete 
cessation of violence," he said. 
  An Irish government spokesman said Albert Reynolds, the 
taoiseach [prime minister], shared dismay at the failure of the 
IRA to deliver a permanent end to violence. "The feeling has 
been growing that if we or the British give them one more 
concession they will just demand more," he said. 
  The spokesman emphasised that Reynolds was bringing no 
pressure on the British, either privately or publicly, to meet 
Sinn Fein. He said: "John Hume speaks for himself on this one. 
He must be deeply disappointed." 
  Republican sources said yesterday that the IRA had 
originally 
intended to hold the ceasefire in June. It appears to have been 
rushed forward following pressure from Hume and prominent Irish 
Americans, many of whom were disappointed by the failure of 
Adams to announce concessions on his visit to the United States 
earlier this year. 
  Bill Flynn, the New York businessman who invited Adams, has 
voiced growing impatience with Sinn Fein in recent weeks. This 
weekend Father Sean McManus, another key Irish-American 
activist, said he did not believe that a three-day suspension of 
hostilities was enough to satisfy the growing demand from Irish 
Americans for an end to the conflict. 
  Yesterday, Adams appeared to soften Sinn Fein's position. He 
gave the party's clearest indication yet that a British 
declaration of intent to withdraw from Northern Ireland was not 
a pre-condition for a complete cessation of IRA violence. "At 
the end of the day, republicans want to see an end to British 
jurisdiction in Ireland. But we have to take on board that the 
Unionists have an opposite view," he said. 
  However, an IRA source said the movement's leaders were 
claiming to be on the brink of victory. They have told internal 
meetings that the government last year gave assurances that it 
secretly wanted Irish unity. Martin McGuinness, the Sinn Fein 
leader involved in secret contacts with the government, is 
expected to allude to these alleged assurances at a republican 
rally in Dublin today. 
  There are growing fears in security circles that if the 
government does not budge there will be an escalation of 
terrorism. 
  IRA members have been told to prepare for a renewed terror 
campaign, while loyalist paramilitaries have ended their 
informal contacts with the Irish government and are threatening 
to start a bombing campaign throughout Ireland. 
  The British and Irish governments appear to have accepted 
that there is unlikely to be an early end to violence. They 
have begun drawing up a joint document on the future government 
of the province and Anglo-lrish relations. 
  An Irish government source said the document would be 
unveiled when events had "cooled down" after the European 
elections in june. 
  Sir Patrick Mayhew, the Northern Ireland secretary, said: 
"The two governments are working on a joint structure scheme 
that will represent, in their view, the best means by which a 
satisfactory package could get broad support."

<F P=106> [Colin Brown article: "Cabinet Allies Close Ranks But Bring </F>
Scant Relief to Major"] 
  [Text] Cabinet ministers rallied behind John Major 
yesterday by insisting there would be no leadership election 
this autumn. But the concerted show of support failed to dispel 
doubts among Tory MPs about his chances of staying in office. 
  Right-wing MPs confirmed the findings in an INDEPENDENT ON 
SUNDAY/NOP [National Opinion Poll] poll that Michael Heseltine 
was the favourite to replace Mr Major, if he is forced out. But 
they are calculating that Michael Portillo will run hard to 
secure Eurosceptic policies from the eventual winner. 
  Some of Mr Major's closest allies were seething with anger 
at 
Mr Heseltine and Kenneth Clarke, the Chancellor, for "posturing" 
before the damaging retreat last week by the Prime Minister over 
Britain's veto powers in the enlarged European Union. "Why were 
Clarke and Heseltine trying to sound more Portilloesque than 
Portillo? The answer's pretty obvious," said one Cabinet 
minister. 
  The leadership is hoping that over the Easter recess the 
Conservative constituencies will urge their MPs to stop the 
damaging in-fighting which they believe is overshadowing the 
Government's fightback on the economy, law and order and 
education. 
  That message was reinforced by three Cabinet ministers who 
broke their Easter Sundays to support Mr Major. John Patten, 
the Secretary of State for Education, said: "He is a man of very 
great resilience. It must be tough for him. No one likes the 
level of criticism he has been getting. But he will be carrying 
on a 20- to 30-year programme begun in 1979 through to the next 
general election." 
  Michael Howard, the Home Secretary, said: "There is no 
prospect of any leadership contest. John Major is going to lead 
the Conservative Party successfully into the next general 
election." He dismissed one poll of 100 MPs which showed that 
41 of them believed there would be a change of leadership. 
  Lord Wakeham, Leader of the House of Lords, used a letter to 
his former constituency of Colchester South to issue a general 
call to Tories for loyalty to Mr Major. "Our support for him 
should not only be loyalty to a proven winner, but also backing 
for a man who has ideas, ambitions and ability to take Britain 
to success in the 21st century," Lord Wakeham said. 
  Their calls were described as "ritualistic" by one leading 
right-wing Tory MP. "John Major has done himself great damage. 
There will not be a coup next week. It will depend on how we 
do in the local and European elections. But there will be a 
stalking horse candidate this autumn. There's little doubt 
about that," he said. However, Tory right wingers said last 
night that they would support Mr Major because there was no 
credible right-wing candidate. Mr Portillo, 40, was too young 
and they still regarded Mr Heseltine as an interventionist 
left-winger. If a challenge does take place, they will press Mr 
Portillo to stand to secure key commitments, including no 
British entry into a single European currency. 
  Three of the Tory MPs who have been rumoured as possible 
stalking horses -- Teresa Gorman, Tony Marlow and Sir Richard 
Body -- appeared to rule themselves out. 
  The odds against Mr Major surviving have shortened from 
evens 
to 11/10 against over the past 24 hours. The Prime Minister 
told journalists at his Huntingdon Conservative Club at the 
weekend that he would not be forced out by the speculation. "It 
hasn't stopped me in the past two years. It isn't going to stop 
me now."

<F P=106> [Editorial: "A Terminal Plight"] </F>
  [Text] John Major's political fortunes have been 
consistently in the doldrums since the general election two 
years ago, his future as Tory leader constantly a matter for 
speculation. The writing has been on the wall for the prime 
minister for so long that it would be easy to dismiss the latest 
crisis as just another setback. But the events of the past week 
are not merely more of the same. The prime minister's stock has 
plunged to such a low that the question which now dominates 
discussion among senior Tories is no longer if Mr Major will be 
forced to resign, but when. It is not just his enemies on the 
right who believe he will have to go; the solid centre of the 
Tory party is rapidly coming to the same conclusion. Even those 
he can still count as friends and allies admit as much in 
private, whatever their protestations of loyalty in public. It 
is, of course, impossible to predict the manner and exact timing 
of his demise. But that he will go seems now to be as likely as 
anything can be in the uncertain world of politics, and probably 
before the year is out. 
  Mr Major has been written off before, though his position 
has 
never been as dire as it is now. His remarkable resilience in 
adversity and his steely determination to claw his way back from 
hopeless positions may yet confound his critics. But we now 
know enough about Mr Major's strengths and weaknesses to make 
two safe conclusions: he and those around him are incapable of 
mounting a credible strategy for a sustained recovery in his 
political fortunes; and, even when things are looking up a bit 
for him, he has the unerring knack of digging a hole for himself 
and jumping into it. Taken together, they suggest his plight is 
terminal. 
  Mr Major has made repeated attempts to relaunch himself, 
usually through set-piece speeches to the Tory faithful; none 
has got beyond the starting blocks, partly because rousing 
speeches are not his forte. More fundamentally, he cannot bring 
himself to draw a line under past mistakes and start again. 
This has been seen above all in the crucial area of economic 
policy. The chance to go for economic growth and jobs after 
White Wednesday, the defining disaster of his administration 
from which he has never really recovered when the pound was 
ignominiously ejected from the European exchange-rate mechanism 
(ERM), has been largely botched because Mr Major could not bring 
himself to admit that his previous economic strategy was in 
ruins and it was time for a fresh start. The price of his 
desire to depict consistency and business as usual, when all 
around him was erumbling, has been a stuttering, half-hearted 
recovery which has left voters in a mood too curmudgeonly, after 
a long, painful recession, to give the government any credit for 
what economic growth there has been. 
  Mr Major's inability to shake off his past mistakes is 
compounded by his facility for making new ones. When this 
newspaper wrote that if he saw a banana skin on the other side 
of the street he would cross over to slip on it, his supporters 
said that was harsh and exaggerated. After the debacle over 
European voting rights last week, when Mr Major created a drama 
and then turned it into a crisis, all to no purpose, nobody can 
now doubt its essential accuracy. But it was only the latest in 
an impressive track record of finding banana skins to slip on 
that a more astute politician would have easily avoided: from 
pit closures to Europe to back-to- basics to the ERM to 
promising tax cuts then imposing the biggest tax hike in British 
history, Mr Major's habit has been to stake out untenable 
positions, then retreat from them, leaving chaos and disillusion 
in his wake. It is an unedifying, sometimes ludicrous, sight. 
There are enough senior Tories concluding that it cannot 
continue to make his days numbered. 
  A fair number of Tory MPs still believe their party would be 
signing a suicide note if it changed leaders in mid-term for the 
second time in four years. They have a point. The election of 
a new leader would not necessarily transform the political scene 
overnight. There would be no sudden revival of Tory fortunes in 
the opinion polls, of the sort that occurred when Margaret 
Thatcher was deposed. But a majority of Tory MPs, especially 
those in marginal seats facing political oblivion, are coming 
round to the view that changing horses might be the lesser of 
two evils. A new leader would at least give them a fighting 
chance of holding on to their seats, when at present they have 
none. 
  The contest for the next Tory leader is, in effect, already 
under way. It will not reach its climax before midsummer at the 
earliest. Nobody wants to succeed Mr Major this side of the 
local and European elections in May and June. Of course, his 
prospects would be transformed if the Tories were to do 
unexpectedly well; on present evidence that is the least likely 
outcome. Mr Major must brace himself for renewed calls for his 
departure in the wake of Tory electoral disasters. He insists 
he will not be driven out, no matter how bad the results. He 
could hardly say otherwise. But if he does dig in he faces a 
challenge from a stalking horse which he would win, but probably 
so humiliatingly that he would be a lame-duck leader. It might 
not come to that: by late summer/early autumn, the weight of 
party opinion urging him to go could prove irresistible. Mr 
Major says the "men in suits" will not force him. But Richard 
Nixon thought he could hang on, even though Watergate had 
crippled his presidency, until a crucial meeting with Barry 
Goldwater forced him to conclude the game was up. We do not yet 
know the name of the British Tory Goldwater; but as the year 
goes on there is likely to be no shortage of volunteers. The 
emergence of Michael Heseltine as clear frontrunner to succeed 
Mr Major in our poll of 100 Tory MPs is nothing short of 
remarkable, though it was anticipated in this column several 
weeks ago. His only problem is of peaking too soon. He has to 
continue to look and sound prime ministerial without appearing 
disloyal to his present boss. He is astute enough to walk that 
tightrope. On Europe, where the right distrust him most, he has 
to sound increasingly Gaullist: pro-European but a staunch 
defender of Britain's national interests. He would capture more 
of the right if he made it clear at some stage that Michael 
Portillo would be chancellor in a Heseltine administration. 
  When Mr Heseltine mulled over his challenge to Mrs Thatcher 
in 1990 he used to say that, when it came to the Tory 
leadership, he had only one bullet in his gun; if he missed he 
would never get another chance. Well, he did miss and he was 
wrong. As much to his surprise as anybody's, it turns out there 
is another bullet in the chamber.

<F P=106> [Interview with Chancellor Kenneth Clarke by David Smith: </F>
"Clarke Rejects Tax and Inflation Fears"] 
  [Text] [Smith] Can I take you back a couple of years and 
ask you whether, before the April 1992 election, you ever 
thought there might have to be tax increases during this 
parliament? 
  [Clarke] No, I didn't think during the campaign it was 
likely 
there would be tax increases because I then shared the general 
view that the recession was shortly going to come to an end and 
we were not far from recovery. I think all three potitical 
parties campaigned on the same expectation, which was reinforced 
by quite a good proportion of the economic commentary we had. 
Also, I didn't actually say anything during the election 
campaign that has been held against me, which, given that I 
campaigned fairly prominently, shows I was not too misled by my 
expectations then of the recovery. But nevertheless I did not 
foresee that we'd have to have tax increases as we've had. 
  [Smith] What was your reaction as a non-Treasury minister 
when you first heard of the tax increases Norman Lamont was 
planning? 
  [Clarke] By that time it was beginning to be clear there was 
a crisis in the public finances. I believed it was necessary 
for Norman to tackle that straight away because if he didn't 
tackle it in that budget it would be too late. I was actually a 
supporter of the proposition that he should delay the tax 
increases as far as possible until April of 1994 because I was 
one of those still not certain that the recovery was strong 
enough then, in April 1993, to be able to carry it. Politically 
that proved to be a mistake but I am not sure that with 
hindsight I would necessarily change my mind because it was wise 
from the point of view of the economy to delay it for 12 months. 
  [Smith] Do you think there is any danger that you have 
indulged in overkill on tax, in two senses: one in that the 
PSBR (public-sector borrowing requirement) looks as though it 
may undershoot, and second, in terms of the risk to the recovery? 
  [Clarke] That's the serious judgment one has to make and 
that 
I made in preparing the November budget. I believed we needed 
to do a little bit more on tax, despite the fact we'd had an 
extremely effective autumn spending round. I just felt it was 
necessary in November to get completely on top of the problem of 
public-sector borrowing. My judgment remains that the increase 
in taxation this year is both necessary to sustain the recovery 
and also will not itself damage the recovery, which is now very 
much stronger than 12 months ago. 
  You're right, the PSBR may undershoot; I always realised 50 
billion pounds was an estimate but it was the best estimate 
anybody could make in the summer. At the moment we still don't 
know because the last month of the year can produce quite 
substantial figures. But it could be a little under 50 billion 
pounds. If it undershoots, so much the better. it does not 
make me regret the fiscal judgment I made at the time of the 
budget. 
  Next year and beyond? In my opinion, the Treasury has tended 
to underestimate the effects of recovery on public finances. 
And it could be that the decline in public-sector borrowing 
might be rather faster than in the Red Book (the Treasury's 
budget report). 
  [Smith] You were quoted once as saying the tax increases 
could check the recovery. That is no longer your belief? 
  [Clarke] If you increase taxation it will take some of the 
edge off consumer spending compared with what it would have been 
if you had not raised taxation. In so far as it does take a 
little money out of the consumer's pocket, I do not believe it 
will damage the recovery. My forecast of 2.5 percent growth in 
GDP this year is regarded as completely credible by most of the 
commentators and by the markets. 
  I hope to see a balanced recovery so I would like to see 
further improvements in investment and a good strong export 
performance alongside the consumer demand we already have -- 
which is, at the moment, satisfactorily up compared with 12 
months ago. 
  [Smith] Do you see this as a useful side-effect of the 
necessary, as you would regard it, fiscal adjustment -- a 
rebalancing of the economy away from over-reliance on consumer 
spending? 
  [Clarke] It is a usefull side-effect but it is a 
side-eftect. 
It was not the principal motive. The principal motive was in 
order to get healthy public finances again and to make it quite 
clear that the public sector deficit was under control. 
  You've been suggesting recently that the impact of the tax 
increases has been exaggerated, particularly by your political 
opponents. Is that purely a political point or does it reflect 
a concern that the public may be over-anxious about the impact 
of the tax increases, reflected in the fall in consumer 
confidence we've seen? 
  It's largely a political exchange because I do think the 
Labour party in particular has been producing figures that cause 
serious alarm and obviously do political damage to the governing 
party. I also think that people have discounted the effect of 
the tax increases to a certain extent already but, plainly, I 
don't want over-the-top political campaigning to start 
unnecessarily damaging consumer confidence. 
  I have always thought that surveys of consumer confidence 
tend to reflect what people have read in their morning 
newspapers. And if you look at consumer behaviour it has been 
pretty satisfactory in recent months. 
  [Smith] You've said you will not make tax cuts for political 
reasons. Can you tell me what your criteria will be for tax 
cuts? Does the budget have to be back in balance before you 
make any tax cuts? 
  [Clarke] No, we have an aim of balance in the medium term, 
which I always supported before I came into office and have 
continued to support since. But any further tax cuts will 
depend on my judgment of the effects on the public finances, on 
confidence and on the markets, and whether they would regard any 
further move to improve incentives and reduce marginal rates in 
the economy as responsible. 
  At an uncertain stage like this when a recovery is 
beginning to grow, one of the key things is to build up a 
reputation for credibility and confidence and, politically, to 
retain the government's reputation for competence in economic 
affairs. 
  Going back to tax cuts, I always think the public are more 
intelligent than most people give them credit for. They can 
judge whether tax cuts are the act of a chancellor who is trying 
to win votes, or the act of a chancellor who is pursuing an 
economic policy that he actually believes and thinks he is now 
able to do something with genuine desirable effects on people's 
behaviour. I intend to be in the second category. 
  [Smith] Is it now your expectation that you will not have to 
make further big tax increases during this parliament? 
  [Clarke] You're asking me to make my fiscal judgment for the 
next budget rather a long way in advance. At this stage, 
comparatively soon after the last budget, I am quite confident 
of the path I set out then. Also, I wouldn't be so unwise as to 
be drawn by your understandable interest in what I might do in 
the future. 
  [Smith] You did say then that the budget sorted out the 
problem of the public finances once and for all? 
  [Clarke] That was my aim, yes. My aim was to have one budget 
to sort out the problems of the public finances. I hope and I 
remain confident that that will not be the dominant issue in 
future budgets. 
  Of course I might have had to decide that I couldn't do 
that. 
In the autumn of last year, looking at the recovery, I might 
have had to decide, well, there would have to be more than one 
bite before we get on top of this. But I didn't think so, and I 
still don't think so. 
  Here we are at the beginning of April. The next two or 
three months are the critical time, which I believe will confirm 
my judgment that the recovery can take it and that we will 
continue on course towards our medium-term objectives. 
  [Smith] What happens if the recovery can't take it? 
  [Clarke] Given that I don't think that is going to happen, 
I'm not going to speculate on what I would do. Chancellors 
start earning their money when the economy starts behaving in a 
way they did not expect, nor did most other people. There have 
been times since I've been chancellor, particularly immediately 
after the budget, when there was something dangerously near 
consensus that Britain was now set for a period of sustained 
recovery. If that dominant body of opinion proves wrong, that's 
when the chancellor has to earn his corn, but I see no point in 
speculating about it. So far, I have not got a prickly feeling 
in my palms that it might happen. I cannot see what is going to 
stop the recovery being sustained. 
  [Smith] Do you see yourself as a long-serving chancellor 
and, 
if so, what would you like to do? 
  [Clarke] I would very much like to be a long-serving 
chancellor, not least because I think I was reshuffled too 
quickly from my last two jobs. What do I see myself as? I would 
like to see myself presiding over a sustained period of 
recovery, that's obvious, all chancellors would like to. I 
think I have a chance as chancellor for a few years where we 
regain the strong economic performance of the mid 1980s. 
  More than that obvious ambition, the other thing I would 
really like to do is to be a chancellor in a Treasury that is an 
economic department which, alongside the departments of trade 
and employment, sees itself as interested in supporting the real 
economy, interested in making a positive contribution to 
improvements on the supply side in this country. 
  [Smith] That suggests a more interventionist approach? 
  [Clarke] No it doesn't. Because I'm generally not in favour 
of interventionism or industrial policies of the old-fashioned 
kind. The way I would describe it is that it involves a wider 
approach to the job. I take a close interest, obviously, in ihe 
behaviour of the markets I take a close interest in all those 
features of macro- economic policy which are necessary to set 
the right climate here, but the real acid test of the economic 
policy of the government is: how do you create a combination of 
circumstances that enables British industry to become more 
competitive and to become more prosperous and thereby, create 
jobs and prosperity? 
  I do tend to judge the impact of what I am doing by thinking 
what is this doing to help those people responsible for managing 
British industry, selling British goods and services and 
creating jobs in this country? Most people in the Treasury are 
concerned with the control of public expenditure. This is the 
time when they've got to be good at the job. 
  I have never joined publicly in the criticism of the 
Treasury 
in the past, so I don't see why I should now. I've done battle 
with it often enough. The system of government we have in this 
country does lead to a more effective system of public spending 
control than most other countries. But no good business is run 
solely by its finance director. This department should be 
concerned with economic affairs generally. 
  [Smith] What about some of the issues that past chancellors 
have attempted to grapple with, not always successfully; I'm 
talking about an integration of tax and social security and a 
bigger shift from direct to indirect taxation? Are those the 
sort of challenges that appeal to you? 
  [Clarke] Yes but what I never do is speculate about things I 
am looking at, until I've reached the stage where I want to 
speculate about them publicly. I've had a long-standing 
interest in the relationship between the tax and the benefits 
system, and a long- standing interest in work incentives at 
every level of society and their effect on people's performance, 
so while I am at the Treasury I don't expect my interest to 
lessen. 
  [Smith] Direct to indirect taxation? 
  [Clarke] Yes, I have always supported that, it is something 
we set out and embarked on when we came in in 1979, and we've 
made quite considerable advances. My public statements on the 
subject I have tended to regard as a reaffirmation of the 
long-standing basis of policy. 
  [Smith] Do you hope to repeat the technique used 
successfully 
last November, when you ended up with a reduction in the 
spending total? 
  [Clarke] Well, I haven't refined my techniques yet, but we 
have until July to set the spending remit again and in the 
autumn we'll discover how we're going to hit that remit and 
whether it's necessary and possible to beat it again. You 
should never revisit the scene of a disaster, which is one rule 
of politics. 
  Another is: never expect success to repeat itself twice in 
precisely the same way. Michael (Portillo) and I will hope to 
repeat the success of last year but won't just go in for a 
straight replay on the assumption that it will work again. But 
it was a good operation last autumn and a very necessary 
reassertion of proper control over the level of public spending. 
  What gave me the greatest pleasure was imposing real 
constraint over spending plans and at the same time preserving 
stated political priorities. 
  [Smith] Many people in the markets say the government's 
political difficulties will impact badly on sterling. You are 
very much in favour of a stable exchange rate, so would you be 
rather concerned about any substantial weakening? 
  [Clarke] Stability of exchange rates is preferable. 
Political events do have an effect on the markets and if 
governments are perceived to have political difficulties we tend 
to see, for a day or two, an effect on the markets whatever 
country you're in. Personally, I think as far as the 
fundamentals are concerned that kind of thing has no lasting 
effect. Were we to have any flutter in the markets I'd have to 
make a judgment about whether this was just three days' reaction 
to perceived political rows or whether it had any likelihood of 
lasting. 
  [Smith] So you wouldn't necessarily respond to something 
that 
you thought was whatever the opposite of froth is? 
  [Clarke] I don't think I should. I shouldn't make decisions 
on the basis that I wake up one morning, gaze at the Reuters 
screen and think: the newspapers have taken the edge off 
sterling, what am I going do about it? I do join in the process 
of asking why this is happening, is it going to last, and the 
key thing that makes it easier to react to events is if the 
markets share my feeling that the fundamentals are right. 
  The markets have grown a little more worried about inflation 
in recent weeks. 
  That's surprising. It comes slightly on the back of the 
markets being unsettled anyway by the Fed putting up interest 
rates in America, plainly as a precautionary measure against 
inflationary pressures there. Then we had a bad reaction to 
last week's inflation figures here. I didn't share that 
reaction. They were very much in line with what I expected. 
One or two commentators rosily expected they'd be even better 
than they were and the markets reacted badly. Long-term 
(interest) rates were very low before. They'ye now gone up quite 
sharply but we wait to see. 
  [Smith] So you don't think, in the case of Britain, that 
inflation fears are justified? 
  [Clarke] No. If the market has fears about inflation, I see 
no cause for that. 
  [Smith] Can I ask you finally about your relations with the 
Bank of England? You said a little while ago that you were 
agnostic on the question of full independence. Has anything 
happened in the intervening months to shift your opinion? 
  [Clarke] To change my public agnosticism? I remain on 
extremely good terms with the governor and the Bank and I 
operate at present so that decisions on monetary policy are in 
the end mine, after listening to the Bank, listening to the 
Treasury and all the other advice that pours in. 
  I have tried to introduce step-by-step, slightly more 
transparency into the relationship. If you try to retain an air 
of total mystery, all that happens is that you get idle 
speculation and gossip which unsettles the market. But I'm 
genuinely agnostic about the right relationship between 
parliament, government and the Bank. A little more transparency 
might show that there's nobody infallible in this world. 
  [Smith] You said you make the decisions, Are there 
circumstances when you'd perhaps overrule the Bank's advice? 
  [Clarke] It seems to be constitutionally my role to do so if 
I feel it necessary. I always say I'll take responsibility for 
anything that's actually within my control. In the end, you 
make your own decisions but not in any impulsive or macho way. 
I continue to be more attracted by the idea of a little more 
openness in the whole thing. 
  [Smith] So you've been in full agreement with the Bank? Some 
people say that in February you wanted a half-point cut, the 
Bank wanted nothing, so you settled on a quarter. 
  [Clarke] Speculation surrounding that decision has made me 
interested in a little more transparency. At the moment we 
operate on the basis of total secrecy. Nobody is contemplating 
total openness because it is market-sensitive. Last February 
there was the kind of half gossip which seemed to me the least 
attractive. I think a quarter-point reduction then could hardly 
be described as harmful. 
  [Smith] So if people knew the full story, they would realise 
it was genuinely a collective decision? 
  [Clarke] All politicians believe that, if only people knew 
the full story all would be for the best and the best of all 
possible worlds. I actually think it was a good decision. In 
this job more than most, it's when you look back and see what 
actually happened that you can make the best judgment of 
decisions, which is usually a fairly frightening prospect for 
most chancellors of the exchequer eventually. 
  The timing was rather strange. If you'd decided it, people 
would have said it was a politician who didn't understand the 
markets, timing it on that particular day. 
  Well, the actual timing was decided by the Bank, on a 
decision that had been taken a week before. I decided on the 
reduction before the Fed increase. To be fair, I did decide 
after the Fed increase not to pull it. But as part of the new 
spirit of openness I left the exact timing to the governor.

  [Text] In Bavaria, the first deportation orders have been 
issued against Kurds that participated in the recent riots. 
Interior Minister Guenther Beckstein (Christian Social Union) 
said on Friday [1 April] that the authorities took the decision 
"after carefully considering all existing evidence." 
  The Greens' parliamentary group in the Bavarian Landtag had 
said before that deportations could be expected during the 
Easter holidays. Preparations are already running at full 
speed. The Greens quoted an official in the Interior Ministry, 
who had turned to them because of "serious legal doubts." 
  A spokesman of the Federal Justice Ministry said in Bonn 
that 
he could not imagine that the Bavarian government would violate 
Germany's clear obligations under international law by "illegal 
deportations." 
  Beckstein said that the deportation orders are "possible and 
necessary under the legal situation that is in accord with the 
constitution." Anyone violating the peace of a country cannot 
expect to be protected by that country. Those deported do not 
face "inappropriate treatment or death penalties." 
  According to the Greens, the deportation of Kurds during the 
Easter holidays was agreed by Beckstein with his Bonn colleague 
[Federal Interior Minister] Manfred Kanther (Christian 
Democratic Union). "The interior ministers seem to be aiming at 
an affront to Federal Justice Minister Sabine 
Leutheusser-Schnarrenberger (Free Democratic Party), who had 
clearly rejected deportations," Diet Group Chairman Hanns-Dieter 
Reichhelm said. The Bavarian Interior Ministry spoke of a 
disinformation campaign by the Greens. "Nobody dealing with 
this matter in the Bavarian Interior Ministry has made a 
relevant comment to them," reports from the Ministry said.

  [Text] Saarbruecken -- The Turkish ambassador to Germany, 
Onur Oymen, welcomes the planned deportation of militant Kurds 
from Bavaria. "I find it absolutely right, and I welcome the 
ruling of Bavarian Interior Minister Beckstein," Oymen said on 
Saarland radio on Saturday [2 April]. 
  The Kurds who are to be deported from Germany are neither 
threatened by capital punishment nor torture in Turkey, Oymen 
said. Turkey is a "law-governed state just like Germany." In 
the last 10 years, the Turkish Parliament has not passed a 
single death sentence. Moreover, Turkey is a member of the 
European Anti-Torture Convention, Oymen stated.

  [Text] Munich (DPA) -- Criticism of the deportation of 
Kurds from Bavaria has continued on Easter Sunday [3 April]. 
Participants of a delegation of observers from Munich to the 
Turkish local elections have criticized Interior Minister 
Guenther Beckstein of the Christian Social Union for "directly 
playing into the hands of Turkish torturers." Ankara's promise 
that the deportees neither had to fear torture nor death is 
worth nothing. Critics of the Turkish regime were being 
systematically persecuted, arrested, tortured, and murdered, 
they said. 
  Deportation decrees against militant Kurds were even issued 
over the Easter weekend. Bavaria was the first to draw 
conclusions from the blockade two weeks ago, Heinz Grunwald, the 
responsible official in the Bavarian Interior Ministry, told 
DPA. He added that the authorities dealing with issues related 
to foreigners would work through the weekend. 
  It is still unclear when the first Kurds will be deported. 
Those affected have the right to appeal against the decrees. 
According to the Justice Ministry, 15 participants of the 
Augsburg highway blockade two weeks ago are being detained in 
Bavarian prisons. A total of approximately 500 people are under 
investigation.

  [Excerpt] Bonn/Hamburg (DPA) -- The Federal Government 
expects that all arms supplied by Germany to Turkey will be used 
in line with bilateral agreements. This was emphasized by a 
Foreign Ministry spokeswoman in connection with the discussion 
on the use of German arms in Turkey. This means that Turkey 
must use German arms only within the framework of NATO orders, 
the spokeswoman said. This was also laid down in an exchange of 
letters between the foreign ministers of the two countries in 
1992. 
  According to Christian Democratic Union [CDU] Bundestag 
Deputy Klaus Francke, the Bundestag's Foreign Committee will 
deal with the issue on the use of German arms in the Kurdish 
conflict on 13 April. The Federal Government will subsequently 
comment on the issue, Francke said on North German radio NDR on 
Saturday [2 April]. If Turkey were to use German arms in its 
actions against Kurds, this would be a violation of the 
arrangements made with Turkey. Arms supplied within the NATO 
framework must not be used in internal conflicts. [passage

<F P=106> [Interview with Forza Italia leader Silvio Berlusconi by </F>
Maria Latella in Rome on 31 March: "Berlusconi: There Are Still 
Matters To Discuss"] 
  [Excerpt] Rome -- [Passage omitted] [Latella] Mr. 
Berlusconi, have all the problems with [Northern League 
Secretary] Umberto Bossi and the League really been resolved? 
  [Berlusconi] No, no. We have a whole series of discussions 
and meetings planned. I am confident, as always, but there is a 
whole series of different issues that need to be discussed. 
  [Latella] Newspaper editorial offices are busy guessing 
about 
the composition of the government, rumors are circulating... 
According to the latest one, Ambassador Sergio Romano is to 
become foreign minister. 
  [Berlusconi] Well, I can tell you this: There has been no 
discussion about ministers with anyone. All the rumors that are 
circulating are without foundation. Nothing of what I have read 
corresponds in the slightest to the possible ministers suggested 
by the three leaders or, rather, by the three, four, or five 
leaders of the alliance. 
  [Latella] Is it possible to make a suggestion of how many 
ministries will go to the League? 
  [Berlusconi] The League will have its ministers, the 
National 
Alliance will have its ministers, and we will have our 
ministers, but they will all be people who do not feature among 
the names that have appeared in the newspapers. You see, we 
have not yet talked about individuals, because we are talking 
about substantive matters. I think this is the right time to 
discuss matters of substance; the names will come later. 
  [Latella] What will be the differences between the 
government 
that you intend to form and its predecessors? Is it true that 
you will reduce the number of ministries? 
  [Berlusconi] I have a very clear idea, and if I am to be 
prime minister, because there could be an "if," the differences 
will be many and profound. I have a clear program, but it is 
still to early to talk about that. [passage omitted]

<F P=106> [Unattributed article: "Businessmen Want Berlusconi Premier </F>
But With Controls Over Conflict of Interest"] 
  [Text] (ANSA) Rome, March 31 -- The majority of Italian 
businessmen believe that Forza Italia leader Silvio Berlusconi 
should be given a mandate by Head of State Oscar Luigi Scalfaro 
to form a new government, but also want guarantees set down to 
separate his political, performance from his business 
activities, according to a poll to be published by the economic 
weekly IL MONDO. 
  The poll, which interviewed 202 executives and businessmen, 
found that 38.7 percent wanted President Scalfaro to give a 
mandate to Berlusconi, while 30.4 preferred someone close to the 
winning alliance forged by the owner of Fininvest but more 
independent. The choice of National Alliance head Giancarlo 
Fini as premier was the choice of 10.1 percent of those 
interviewed, while 3.6 percent indicated Northern League leader 
Umberto Bossi. 
  Berlusconi was preferred more by businessmen, while company 
executives indicated other solutions. 
  A total of 34.5 percent of those interviewed saw as "very 
realistic" Forza Italia's program, which included lowering 
taxes, more jobs and the privatization social services. Another 
13.7 percent saw it as "realistic enough." This opposed to 
33.9 percent, almost all executives, who saw it as "not very 
realistic," and 14.9 did not think it was at all realistic. 
  Those in favor of specific guarantees to separate 
Berlusconi's business and political interests, such as the 
institution of a blind trust, accounted for 64.9 percent of 
those interviewed.

<F P=106> [Interview with Italian Popular Party ideologue Rocco </F>
Buttiglione by Maurizio Caprara in Rome; date not given: 
"Buttiglione: This Right Does Not Know How To Govern"] 
  [Excerpt] Rome -- [Passage omitted] [Caprara] Mr. 
Buttiglione, now that the election campaign is over, we do not 
need to pretend any longer. Tell me, do you really believe in 
the possibility of reviving the center? 
  [Buttiglione] I believe that the line set out by [Italian 
Popular Party, PPI, Secretary] Mino Martinazzoli is basically 
correct. 
  [Caprara] What does "basically" mean? 
  [Buttiglione] That the way in which we have implemented it 
has proved inadequate. We did not succeed in making the country 
understand it. 
  [Caprara] What is your interpretation of that line? 
  [Buttiglione] In a democracy in which rotation occurs, there 
is normally a left-wing force and a center force. The Right is 
smaller. We began amid a strong anti-DC [Christian Democratic 
Party] tide that disqualified the center. There was Bribe City, 
and for too long the center has been an entity without ideas. 
An entity for joint administration, chiefly with the Left. 
However,... 
  [Caprara] However, what? 
  [Buttiglione] ...however, we should have laid the 
foundations 
for a major center force that would have the Left as its 
antagonist. Because of our own shortcomings, the center vote was 
swallowed up by the Right. 
  [Caprara] Are those all the faults? 
  [Buttiglione] We committed a serious fault in the past by 
failing to expel certain crooks promptly. 
  [Caprara] Could you name some names? 
  [Buttiglione] A number of crooks. 
  [Caprara] Where does Martinazzoli stand in this analysis? 
  [Buttiglione] He made a major contribution, especially in 
the 
final stage of the election campaign. But evidently it was 
insufficient. 
  [Caprara] Pardon me, Mr. Buttiglione, but are you mourning 
the DC now that it is dead? Some of its adversaries are doing 
so. 
  [Buttiglione] I was never a member of the DC, though I 
always 
voted for it. Be that as it may, the verdict of historians will 
be different from that given by the newspapers now. The DC 
guaranteed the country the longest period of peace in its 
history, a certain level of development, and great tolerance. I 
think that some of the anti-DC sectarianism is ungenerous. 
  [Caprara] If often comes from former Christian Democrats. 
  [Buttiglione] Yes. The turncoats are asserting themselves by 
stabbing their brother in the back. 
  [Caprara] After Martinazzoli's resignation, you said that 
you 
feel more isolated. Are you looking for new friends? 
  [Buttiglione] Friendships are built by means of an exchange 
of views on history and by establishing ideological common 
ground on the basis of this exchange. I hope that history will 
enable us to find many friends. 
  [Caprara] Berlusconi maintains that while the PPI asserts 
Christian values, your program embodies "the same emphases" and 
that some of the Pact's proposals are "the same" as some of 
Forza Italia's. Do you agree? 
  [Buttiglione] Certainly, and I am pleased. Martinazzoli used 
to point out, in order to curb my academic enthusiasm for 
ideology, that although programs are important in politics, so 
too are the individuals and the forces that advocate them. We 
will discover through legislative activity whether points of 
contact exist. 
  [Caprara] The PPI's Forleo says that you will take care of 
providing Berlusconi with a majority in the Senate. 
  [Buttiglione] I have heard some rumors that I am supposedly 
jumping on the Forza Italia bandwagon. Many people have also 
asked me to do so, and I am grateful for their esteem. But I 
have always had an irresistible love for lost causes. I would 
find it difficult to jump on the victor's bandwagon. 
  [Caprara] The Left of your party is not afraid of your 
leaving. It is afraid of your taking the party with you. 
  [Buttiglione] We must not jump on the victor's bandwagon. I 
believe we must stay in opposition for a while. 
  [Caprara] Precisely: They are afraid that you will hang on 
to them until the congress. Then, everyone over to Berlusconi. 
  [Buttiglione] No, so that it becomes obvious that this 
Right is incapable of governing. It must be broken up by 
shifting some parts of it to the center. Meanwhile, we must 
build the party. This means bringing together many people who 
are bound by a common ideal and who trust each other. 
  [Caprara] That is a wonderful picture. It is a shame that 
the PPI is at present the opposite of that -- not many people, 
and almost nobody who trusts anyone else. 
  [Buttiglione] I agree with you. But the renewal could not 
have been carried out properly under the blows of an aggression 
and with such frequent elections. Keep in mind that if someone 
embraces a lost cause it is because he is convinced that it can 
prove victorious. 
  [Caprara] Immediately after Martinazzoli's resignation, Rosa 
Russo Jervolino said that she tried to contact Martinazzoli but 
that she did not manage to speak with him. Did you try to 
contact him? 
  [Buttiglione] That is my own affair, if I may be permitted 
to 
say so. Politics must be transparent, but everyone has the 
right to a private sphere of personal relations. 
  [Caprara] I did not consider that an embarrassing question. 
Be that as its may, yours is a political reply. In his 
farewell message Martinazzoli described the MSI [Italian Social 
Movement] Right as "encumbered by the burden of its origins and 
its ideology." Do you consider that an intolerable burden? 
  [Buttiglione] [National Alliance leader] Fini made a good 
decision when he decided to dissolve the fascists. And he made 
a mistake when he failed to do so. This, perhaps because he 
achieved good results in the municipal elections. My friend, 
Fisichella, and many other National Alliance voters are not 
fascists. But it is others who are in charge of the MSI. Real 
changes are painful and entail a certain residue being left out. 
  [Caprara] Could [former President] Cossiga have a role to 
play in a party such as the PPI, which cites Catholic principles 
and which some people consider liberal? 
  [Buttiglione] I think that he has carved out a different 
role 
for himself. It is partly an institutional or 
semi-institutional role, as a resource to turn to at times of 
crisis. I am not talking about a party but about the entire 
democratic system.

<F P=106> [Unattributed article: "No Comment From Chief of Staff on </F>
UN Report"] 
  [Text] (ANSA) Rome, March 31 -- Italy's army chief of staff 
Bonifazio Inciso di Camerana refused to comment, Thursday [31 
March], on unconfirmed reports from New York that the conduct of 
Italian troops in Somalia was criticised in a United Nations 
document. "This is a political problem," he said. "This is the 
responsibility of governments, they are international 
responsibilities.... We soldiers just do our job and carry out 
orders given to us by governments." 
  According to well-informed sources close to UN headquarters 
in New York, a top-secret document drawn up last November 
criticised the conduct of United States and Italian troops in 
the peace-making operation in Somalia, saying that they both 
acted on their own initiative, failing to take orders from the 
UN command. 
  The report is also said to demand that the United States pay 
reparations for loss of life during a campaign to capture 
warlord Mohamed Farah Aidid.

<F P=106> [Unattributed article: "Trade Balance in the Black in </F>
January"] 
  [Text] (ANSA) Rome, April 1 -- The Italian trade balance 
continues to be healthy and in January Italy posted a surplus of 
912 billion lire, some 560 million dollars, compared to a 
deficit of 464 billion lire in January 1993. 
  The exchange office said here Friday [1 April] that payment 
made for Italian exports totaled 17.519 trillion lire, up 15.1 
percent, while payment for imports came to 16.607 trillion lire, 
for a 5.9 percent gain. 
  Italy's trade balance with its European Union partners also 
improved, from a 610 billion lire deficit in January 1993 to 214 
billion lire this past January, while there was a significant 
increase for Italy's trade balance with non-European Union 
countries, which went from a 532 billion lire deficit in January 
1993 to a surplus of 506 billion lire this January. 
  The improvement was said to have been recorded for all goods 
sectors and especially, regarding trade with European Union 
countries, mechanical products which shifted from a deficit a 
year earlier of 712 billion lire to one of 512 billion lire, and 
for textiles and clothing, for which the surplus rose from 873 
to 967 billion lire from one January to the next. 
  On the opposite end of the scale, the trade balance got 
worse 
for food products, with the deficit growing from 737 billion 
lire to 929 billion lire. 
  Outside the European Union there was a significant reduction 
in the trade deficit for food goods, from 200 billion to 82 
billion lire, and the surplus improved in the textile-clothing 
sectors from 124 to 289 billion lire, as well as the mechanical 
sector, to 165 billion lire, and steel products, up 113 billion 
lire. 
  On a nation-by-nation basis, the improvement in the trade 
balance was most evident towards France, Germany and the United 
States, with the surplus climbing, respectively to 92 billion 
lire, 326 billion lire and 526 billion lire. 
  Italy's surplus shrank, however, from January to January, 
with Spain, from 272 to 166 billion lire, Portugal, 175 billion 
lire to 121 billion lire, and Greece, 379 to 166 billion lire.

<F P=106> [Unattributed article: "Jobless Rate in Italy Remains at </F>
11.29 Percent"] 
  [Excerpt] (ANSA) Rome, March, 31 -- The jobless rate in 
Italy remained at 11.29 percent in January, the same as in 
October of last year, with 2,524,000 people looking for work, 
according to the report issued here Thursday [31 March] by the 
national statistic bureau ISTAT [Central Statistics Institute]. 
  The ISTAT report went on to confirm how unemployment was 
highest in the south but showed a slight decline, 18.80 percent 
in January compared to 18.94 in October, and was significantly 
lower in Central Italy, where there was a minor decline from 
9.84 percent to 9.5 percent, and while lowest in the north saw 
an increase from October to January, 7.16 percent against 6.87 
percent in October of last year. 
  An analysis by ISTAT claimed how rising unemployment 
appeared 
to have leveled out after its steep hike from January 1993 to 
October of that year, when it leaped 9.39 percent to 11.29 
percent. In absolute terms, however, the quarter under 
examination saw a net decline in jobholders equal to 210,000 
units, once seasonably adjusted. 
  ISTAT also drew attention to the alarming fact that, between 
October of last year and January of 1994, there was a marked 
increase in the number of people looking for employment with 
work experience, while those looking for their first job 
declined, but probably only due to discouragement, ISTAT said. 
Looking over the 12-month period, the number of unemployed rose 
by 835,000, of which 452,000 were men and 383,000 women. 
  ISTAT data also showed how Italy's work force in general has 
shrunk from 40.59 percent of the population to 39.8 percent. 
  The greatest number of jobs lost was recorded by ISTAT in 
industry, down 404,000 posts, and the tertiary sector, off 
334,000 and that employees were the hardest hit, down 628 
percent [as received]. 
  Examination of the ISTAT report on a regional basis saw 
unemployment two and a half times greater in the south than the 
north, while more than a quarter of the female work force was 
out of a job. [passage omitted]

South"] 
  [Excerpt] (ANSA) Rome, March 31 -- The rise in Italy's 
crime rate came to a sudden halt in 1993, with murders down by 
27 percent and robberies by 2.9 percent, and major improvements 
in the south, according to Interior Ministry figures released 
Thursday [31 March]. 
  The number of murders committed in southern regions fell by 
301 to 736 last year, against a drop of just 89 in the rest of 
the country. 
  The southern regions remain, however, at the top of the 
charts as far as murders per 100,000 people go, with Calabria 
boasting six, and Sicily five. On a province level, Reggio 
Calabria comes in first with 12 slayings per 100,000 people. 
  Robberies were also down in the south, falling 32.4 percent 
in the north-western region of Val D'Aosta, 18.6 percent in the 
southern Calabria region, and 7.5 percent in Sicily. 
  Sicily still leads the field as far as robberies are 
concerned, however, with 137 per 100,000 inhabitants. Puglia 
follows, with 65. Forty-seven percent of all Italian robberies 
took place in the south. [passage omitted]

<F P=106> [Unattributed article: "Regions Forecast Rising Health Care </F>
Deficits"] 
  [Text] (ANSA) Rome, March 31 -- The government continues to 
underestimate financial needs for regional health care spending 
and the sector's deficit, now at more than eight trillion lire 
(five billion dollars), will probably double by the end of this 
year, according to a report released Thursday [31 March] at the 
State-Regional Conference. 
  The new government, said the report, will have to face yet 
another financial "emergency," that of inaccurate estimates for 
regional health care needs and the subsequent overspending. The 
regions want the next executive to calculate needs according to 
"realistic" data but "without imposing balanced state finances 
as a pre-requisite." 
  They want the government to identify the level of health 
care 
services that can be provided with existing resources and want 
regions to be given greater independence in levying and 
collecting health taxes. Among the proposals forwarded by the 
conference was to link regional per-capita income averages to 
spending standards and to have part of the national health care 
funds set aside for the poorer regions. 
  Figures for 1992 and 1993 show deficits in regional health 
care finances of 2.632 and 6.093 trillion lire respectively, for 
a total 8.725 trillion lire (5.25 billion dollars). The 
shortfall for this year, according to the report, will be some 
two trillion lire higher last year's, or 8.290 trillion lire 
(4.99 billion dollars), because spending will amount to 90 
trillion lire instead of the 81.71 trillion lire forecast by the 
government. 
  The criteria used by the government to make its estimates, 
said the report, "are not totally realistic or acceptable," and 
will lead to a drop in health care standards.

  [Text] Following an invitation by Bulgarian President 
Zhelyu Zhelev, who is in London on a visit, President Berisha 
was received at the Bulgarian Embassy in London this morning. 
  Presidents Berisha and Zhelev exchanged opinions on the 
conflict in former Yugoslavia and the relations with their 
southern neighbors. 
  Concerning bilateral relations between the two countries, 
both expressed the opinion that there are possibilities to 
encourage them further. 
  Today President Berisha also held a meeting with Jacques de 
Larosiere, president of the European Bank for Reconstruction and 
Development [EBRD], and later with the board of bank directors. 
In his speech, Berisha gave a brief account of the economic 
reforms in Albania and stressed our country's needs and 
priorities, which cooperation with the EBRD can further 
strengthen. 
  In the presence of President Berisha, at the British Foreign 
and Commonwealth Office, bilateral agreements between Albania 
and Great Britain were signed -- an agreement on the 
encouragement and protection of investments, an agreement on air 
transportation, an agreement on tourism, and an agreement on 
education, science, and culture. These agreements were signed 
by Deputy Prime Minister Kopliku for the Albanian side, and, for 
the British side, by Douglas Hurd, secretary of state for 
foreign and commonwealth affairs. 
  After signing the agreements, President Berisha met with Mr. 
Hurd. At this meeting, Berisha again stressed that Albania is 
committed to further strengthening of cooperation with Great 
Britain. He also assured Mr. Hurd that Albania is a factor of 
stability in the region and that it will continue to work for 
stability there. 
  At 1500, 1600 Albanian time, as London is one hour ahead, 
President Berisha left London for home.

  [Text] Britain is to open a new embassy in war-ravaged 
Sarajevo, the Foreign Office [FO] announced today. The move 
reflected progress made towards a negotiated settlement of the 
conflict, said a spokesman. It also underlined the Government's 
commitment to humanitarian aid as life returns to normal in the 
city after the UN-brokered peace. 
  Britain first established diplomatic relations with Bosnia 
in 
April 1992, but the security situation was not thought safe 
enough until now to consider opening an embassy. 
  Foreign Secretary Douglas Hurd has appointed Robert Barnett 
as charge d'affaires at Sarajevo. He will take up his post next 
month. 
  Mr. Barnett will initally work alone at the embassy but will 
be supported by British aid officials in the area and diplomats 
in Zagreb. 
  Married with two sons, he was previously assistant head of 
the Eastern Adriatic Unit at the FO.

  [Excerpt] [Announcer] Shaykh Salim Sabah al-Salim, chairman 
of the National Committee for the Affairs of the Prisoners and 
the Missing continued his talks today with high-ranking 
officials in the British capital, London. 
  The talks concentrated on the issue of the Kuwaiti prisoners 
detained in the prisons of the Iraqi regime and the means to 
exert more pressures on that regime to force it to release them. 
More details are included in the following report: 
  [Correspondent] Shaykh Salim al-Sabah, chairman of the 
National Committee for the Affairs of the Prisoners, met Douglas 
Hogg, British minister of state for foreign affairs. 
  The meeting was attended by Khalid al-Duwaysan, Kuwaiti 
ambassador to the United Kingdom. 
  Shaykh Salim told agencies after the meeting that it was 
very 
fruitful and that he briefed the British minister on the recent 
developments in connection with Kuwait's primary issue, the 
activity of the Kuwaiti Government and people to release more 
than 625 Kuwaiti prisoners and detainees and the circumstances 
surrounding their arrest. 
  Shaykh Salim pointed out that Hogg expressed great interest 
in this issue and asked his officials to inform the British 
Mission in New York of this meeting and the information 
presented so that the prisoners' issue can become one of the 
points that will be specifically discussed in the forthcoming 
meetings of the Security Council. [passage omitted]

ASSOCIATION] 
  [Excerpt] Sinn Fein leaders Gerry Adams and Martin 
McGuinness both called on the government today to respond to the 
"potential" offered by this week's IRA ceasefire. 
  Mr Adams said the three-day ceasefire from Tuesday [29 
March] 
created the opportunity to remove the stalemate that had 
developed around clarification of the Downing Street 
declaration. Its significance lay "in the potential it 
creates," he told a rally in Belfast. The British Government 
had brought about a stand-off in the peace process and "erected 
a roadblock around the issue of clarification." Now, the 
ceasefire initiative provided the chance "for Sinn Fein and the 
London government to remove the clarification roadblock so that 
the peace process can move forward." 
  "We are not concerned to force a public climbdown by John 
Major," said Mr Adams. "We will be flexible. But we will not 
accept anything less after 25 years of hard, relentless 
struggle, than the right of our supporters to be treated like 
all other citizens. We ask for no more or no less." 
  Mr McGuinness, speaking in Dublin, told supporters "the 
potential of the IRA's initiative must not be underestimated." 
It was a "significant and unprecedented initiative" which had 
created a substantial opportunity to move the situation "out of 
the current stalemate and on to the next phase of the peace 
process." 
  Mr McGuinness said: "This is the beginning, not the end of 
the process. We in Sinn Fein have asked for meaningful 
discussions with the British Government. Discussion and 
dialogue are essential elements in any peace process." [passage

  [Text] Irish Government officials made no attempt today to 
disguise a deep sense of frustration over the IRA decision to 
limit a post-Easter ceasefire to just three days. 
  After further consideration of the terrorist's move -- and a 
meeting between Dublin Prime Minister Albert Reynolds and his 
deputy Dick Spring -- a senior source said: "To say we are 
disappointed is putting it mildly. Ministers are really annoyed 
that the IRA did not come up with something more meaningful." 
  Mr. Reynolds, in particular, was understood to have been 
partcularly angered at the brief length of the ceasefire. Mr. 
Spring reported after the ministerial exchanges in Dublin's 
government buildings: "The prospect of people not being killed 
in Belfast for three days is to be welcomed. 
  ``But at the same time, it is very disappointing. We have 
been working with the British Government in the context of the 
Downing Street-Northern Ireland peace declaration to bring about 
a permanent cessation of violence, and that is not happening." 
Unless there is a permanent cessation of violence there cannont 
be any negotation between Sinn Fein and either government.'' 
  Mr. Spring, also the Irish Foreign Minister, said the best 
chance of progress might now lie with the communities of 
Northern Ireland: "If people can see over three days what 
happens without it, they can convince the men of violence it 
should come to an end." 
  Irish Goverment aides made it clear that Dublin felt there 
was little more they could now do in response to last night's 
IRA statement. 
  Andrew Hunter, chairman of the Tory backbench Northern 
Ireland committee, said: "We're not interested in ceasefires...I 
don't think that a tactical pause in murder is something to be 
welcomed." 
  Sinn Fein president Gerry Adams said the IRA move 
"represents 
an important initiative" and urged Mr. Major to authorise 
immediate talks with his party. 
  Ken Maginnis, Ulster Unionist MP for Fermanagh and South 
Tyrone, said: "This is a tactic that has to do with placing the 
IRA and Sinn Fein in a stronger position than they are presently 
in." 
  John Hume, leader of the nationalist SDLP, said: "It's a 
very 
risky road but it's a worthwhile road if the ultimate objective 
is a total cessation of violence and therefore no stone should 
left unturned." 
  Prime Minister Albert Reynolds called it "a very small step 
in the right direction."

<F P=106> [Report by Frank E. Lippold: "Taiwan Hoping for German </F>
Activity"] 
  [Text] Berlin/Taipei -- In view of Germany's restrictive 
arms export law, Taiwan has given up hope of a business deal in 
the field of maritime arms technology that would be lucrative 
for both sides. Taiwan will now build the needed warships 
itself. On Monday [28 March], the second of eight frigates 
carrying missiles of the Hsiung Geng-II type was put into 
service. 
  Nevertheless, Taiwan wants to improve bilateral relations, 
especially trade relations -- in spite of the Federal 
Government's pro-Beijing policy. They feel encouraged in this 
view by the fact that with the current German ambassador to Sri 
Lanka and Bangladesh, Claus Franke, a diplomat will become the 
new head of the German trade mission in Taipei. Posting the 
62-year-old does not, however, mean that -- as has been reported 
in Taiwan -- this office "has for the first time been given to 
an official representative of the Foreign Ministry." NEUE ZEIT 
has been told by the Foreign Ministry in Bonn that Franke will 
be given leave to take on his future work for the Federation of 
German Chambers of Industry and Commerce [DIHT], which runs the 
Taipei office. 
  But even without upgrading the German representation, April 
might take a special place in the history of German-Taiwanese 
relations. First, Economics Minister Guenter Rexrodt wants to 
visit the republic before going to mainland China, and second, a 
partnership agreement is to be signed by the districts of 
Greifswald (Mecklenburg) and Nantou (Central Taiwan) in the 
second week of April. 
<H5>  Closer Cooperation Between Local Authorities </H5>
  The agreement, which is to be signed by Councillors Herbert 
Kautz and Yuang-Lang Lin, is the second such agreement between 
districts in the Republic of China and the new laender. In the 
summer of 1993, Annaberg (Saxony) and Kaohsiung agreed on 
cooperation. The visit to Halle in mid-April of Po-Rung Lin, 
the mayor of Taichung, might bring about another agreement. 
Several important representatives of industry are expected to 
accompany the head of the third largest community in Taiwan.

<F P=106> [Interview with Karsten Voigt, SPD foreign policy spokesman, </F>
by Wolfgang Gast; place and date not given: "`Military Aid Is 
Obsolete Anyhow'"] 
  [Text] [Gast] Mr. Voigt, the government wants to conclude 
an agreement with Turkey that rules out the use of the death 
penalty and torture on deported Kurds. Is such an agreement 
possible? 
  [Voigt] Foreign citizens violating laws in Germany must 
expect to be punished or deported. But they must, of course, 
not be deported if there is a danger that they face a death 
sentence or torture. 
  [Gast] This is exactly what the agreement should prevent. 
  [Voigt] In the last instance, the decision will be made by 
German courts. I cannot imagine them only considering the 
contents of such an agreement, but they will take into account 
what these people are actually going to face in Turkey. 
  [Gast] The reason for the Kurdish protests in the FRG is 
oppression in Turkey. The Turkish Government has been receiving 
military aid from the Federal Government for years. What are 
the government's possibilities of stopping military aid and thus 
pressing Turkey to improve the situation of the Kurds? 
  [Voigt] The military aid that the government offered several 
NATO partners during the time of the Cold War is obsolete and no 
longer justifiable. This goes for Turkey, as well as for Greece 
and Portugal. I very much doubt whether stopping arms supplies 
is enough to get Turkey to change its treatment of the Kurds, 
which is primarily motivated by domestic policy considerations. 
Supplying arms is obsolete in foreign policy terms anyhow; 
apart from that, it cannot be justified in terms of human 
rights. Turkey's policy toward the Kurds will not change unless 
the government and population realize that this course leads to 
a dead end. They will realize that the Kurdish problem cannot 
be solved by military means and that the operations in southeast 
Anatolia ruin the country economically. The totally 
unacceptable military operations against the Kurds have 
increased pressure from outside and aggravated the economic 
crisis in the country. Nevertheless, the parties advocating 
particularly drastic measures gained votes in the recent 
elections. That is why one has to acknowledge quite 
realistically that pressure from outside cannot replace the 
learning process that must gain ground in the country -- 
realizing that the Kurds problem cannot be solved by military 
means. 
  [Gast] But, irrespective of that, the Federal Government has 
to make sure that the arms it supplies are not used in internal 
conflicts. 
  [Voigt] This is a promise that the Turkish Government has 
given the Federal Government already.... 
  [Gast] ...and which it does not keep. 
  [Voigt] This is a dilemma the government faces, because it 
advocates arms supplies and relies on this promise. We have 
been opposed to such supplies for years.

<F P=106> [Interview with Klaus Haensch, SPD top candidate for the </F>
European Parliament elections, by Karl-Otto Sattler in 
Strasbourg; date not given: "Influencing Politics"] 
  [Text] The Social Democratic Party of Germany [SPD] 
wants resolutely to oppose nationalist groups in the European 
election campaign. On the other hand, it wants to preserve the 
consensus of the large democratic parties concerning European 
unity. In the opinion of Klaus Haensch (55), it is detrimental 
for Europe to list prominent candidates for the balloting on 12 
June only because of their names--the SPD is supported by tested 
parliamentarians. In 1989 the SPD received 37.3 percent of the 
votes. Karl-Otto Sattler interviewed in Strasbourg the SPD's top 
candidate for the European elections and the deputy chairman of 
the strongest caucus, with its 199 deputies. 
  [Sattler] Germany is facing a super election year in 1994. 
Won't the European elections be drowned out? You even have to 
share 12 June with a lot of municipal elections. 
  [Haensch] It is nothing new or unique to the European 
elections that several elections will take place on one day. 
That has often been the case in the past. In North 
Rhine-Westphalia this time the municipal elections coincide with 
the Bundestag elections. In a super election year like this one, 
every election stands in the shadow of the others. 
  [Sattler] Many people feel that nothing is at stake in the 
European elections and that they can therefore safely give their 
vote to smaller parties, even right-wing parties. The SPD could 
hardly benefit from displeasure with the Union. 
  [Haensch] People who think this way are simply mistaken. 
First, the results of the European elections will have a direct 
influence on the policies of the European Union [EU]. Since 
Maastricht, the Parliament has had actual shared responsibility 
for the legislation of the EU and for the establishment of the 
Brussels Commission. Which majorities are elected to the 
European Parliament will therefore be important. I think the 
people will take this into consideration. 
  [Sattler] At the last SPD election party congress, Gerhard 
Schmid, chairman of the German SPD Eurodeputies, wasn't even 
elected to the Executive Committee. No prominent person from the 
front ranks of the SPD is campaigning in the 12 June elections. 
Apparently the European Parliament does not enjoy a great deal 
of importance among the SPD. 
  [Haensch] That is a false conclusion. The SPD has put those 
politicians on the list who have performed reliable and 
recognized service in the Parliament. To place prominent 
politicians on the list who bring nothing but their prominent 
names would perform a disservice to Europe. The voters would not 
take this seriously. 
  [Sattler] What are the important issues in the SPD campaign? 
  [Haensch] The most important point is that the EU has to 
help 
combat the massive unemployment in Europe. This involves 
increased efforts to reestablish the competitiveness of the 
entire European industry in world markets. Next, during a period 
of limitless destruction of the environment, policy must know no 
limits in protecting the environment. It is no longer possible 
to have an effective environmental policy confined to national 
boundaries. Moreover, in a time when international crime is 
organizing, we need an international organization to fight 
crime. We Social Democrats want to strengthen Europol as a 
European police with real authority. Finally, we Social 
Democrats want to see to it that the EU, as a model of the 
voluntary unity of European nations, remains a factor for 
stability and safeguarding peace in Europe. 
  [Sattler] In the past the European election campaigns were 
quite dull because there were no controversial issues of note. 
Everyone was for Europe in the end. Are things going to be 
different? Will there be fundamental struggles for Europe? Green 
Europoliticians complained about Maastricht, likewise Manfred 
Brunner. Edmund Stoiber has reservations toward Europe. Not to 
mention the nationalist Republikaner. 
  [Haensch] For decades in the Federal Republic there was the 
basic agreement among the large democratic parties that they 
should work for European unity. And in the European election 
campaign, I will not set the whole house on fire just to cook an 
election campaign soup. The election debates will make it clear 
that there are parties and groups that want to return to a 
Europe of nationalism, racism, and instabiltiy. We will oppose 
these groups. 
  [Sattler] Maastricht expanded the responsibilities of the 
European Parliament. Nevertheless, this body is still quite 
powerless. Have you ever had a real feeling of success as a 
European deputy? 
  [Haensch] I wouldn't be here if I hadn't. There are a great 
number of such successes. For example, with Maastricht we were 
successful in providing a political dimension to European unity, 
at least in the initial stage. Another example: Maastricht 
strengthened the rights of the Parliament. In the past in a 
series of legislative processes, we were able to carry the 
position of the Parliament even though there was no legal 
obligation. This was the case, for example, with the first 
Europeanwide exhaust gas regulation for cars, or with various 
environmental guidelines, such as safeguarding drinking water. 
In this case, the Social Democratic caucus was able to carry its 
position. And, finally, it is a fundamental accomplishment to 
ultimately find a common denominator for the various European 
national interests--even if only after difficult negotiations in 
many cases.

<F P=106> [Report by Diethart Goos: "Four RAF Members Escaped Police"] </F>
  [Excerpt] Schwerin -- During the police operation of Bad 
Kleinen in June 1993 against leading Red Army Faction [RAF] 
members Wolfgang Grams and Birgit Hogefeld, the security 
authorities obviously uncovered another four suspected 
terrorists. However, they were not arrested for "tactical" 
reasons in connection with the investigations. This was 
confirmed yesterday by Herbert Helmrich, justice minister of 
Mecklenburg Western Pomerania, in an interview with DIE WELT. 
  At the station of the small town in Mecklenburg Western 
Pomerania, suspected terrorist Grams shot dead policeman Michael 
Newrzella before he was killed himself. According to 
investigations by the state prosecutor, Grams either committed 
suicide or died accidentally by his own gun. Birgit Hogefeld 
was arrested. 
  Justice Minister Helmrich told DIE WELT that an observation 
group of the Wiesbaden-based Federal Office of Criminal 
Investigations [BKA] was in Bad Kleinen in early June, about two 
weeks before the police operation. The BKA had information 
according to which several top terrorists of the RAF's command 
level were planning to vacation in Mecklenburg. With 
remote-control cameras -- one was installed in a trash can, 
another one in a Volkswagen van -- a suspicious couple was 
filmed. The cameras provided surprisingly clear pictures. The 
suspected terrorists were not rounded up because the BKA wanted 
to get more information. 
  On 27 June 1993, some 90 minutes before the shoot-out at the 
station, apart from Grams and Hogefeld, another couple was being 
observed as behaving conspicuously. According to information 
from Schwerin, this couple has been identified. They were not 
rounded up either for tactical reasons. The two young people 
managed to disappear. [passage omitted]

<F P=106> ["na" report: "Industry Considers Creation of 15 Million </F>
Jobs by the Year 2000 an Illusion"] 
  [Text] Duesseldorf, 30 Mar -- In a joint statement, the 
Federation of German Industry (BDI) and the Federation of German 
Employers' Associations (BDA) said that the goal of creating at 
least 15 million new jobs in Europe by the end of the century, 
which the European Union [EU] Commission set down in its white 
paper, "Growth, Competitiveness, Employment -- Challenges of the 
President and Paths Into the 21st Century," is too ambitious 
and, unfortunately, unrealistic. 
  The EU white paper gives mass unemployment in Europe as 
being 
17 million, about 11 percent of the working population. The 
European Council followed the most important recommendations of 
the white paper without automatically adopting all proposals. 
It is primarily the business of the member countries to put 
these guidelines into political practice. The proposal of a new 
common loan financing for infrastructure networks was strictly 
rejected in particular by Germany and Great Britain. 
  The two German top associations express the fear that 
political pressure will increase and that it will be stepped up 
at the national level if the specific measures planned by the EU 
Commission and envisaged by the action plan of the European 
Council are ineffective. 
<H5>  Tax Burden on Lower Wage Groups </H5>
  Industry set down its ideas regarding the strengthening of 
Europe's competitiveness in a report by UNICE [Union of EC 
Industries], the umbrella organization of the European industry 
and employers' associations, published in December 1993. 
  The two top associations of German industry unanimously pay 
tribute to the analysis of the reasons of high unemployment in 
the EU, which the white paper undertakes. The EU white paper 
distinguishes between economic, structural, and technological 
unemployment, and explains that in the field of structural 
unemployment the reason is often to be found in sociopoltically 
influenced decisions, such as: 

  -  relatively high costs for 
low-qualified work, which favor investments in 
rationalization, 
  -  a lack of flexibility of the labor markets and 
limitation of entrepreneurial flexibility regarding training, 
labor law regulations, work contracts, social security, and 
internal management organization. 
  The two top associations also expressed approval for the 
statement by the Commission that in most member states the tax 
burden is disproportionately large for the lower-wage groups and 
that this burden is about 25 percent higher in the EU, compared 
with Japan and the United States. 
  The basic political orientation of the white paper and the 
global strategy, in particular the rejection of expenditure 
programs and the commitment to the EU's openness to the outside, 
to reducing labor costs, to promoting education and training, 
and to establishing more flexibility on the labor markets and 
regarding work time is welcomed by the top associations. Their 
statement says that with this the Commission follows the view 
that has long been advocated by industry, namely that Europe's 
competitive weakness can be overcome only by eliminating its 
structural reasons. 
  However, industry criticized that many proposals of the 
white 
paper put too great an emphasis on strengthening economic 
demand, on levying new taxes, and, generally, on the role of the 
state in abolishing unemployment. The recommendations of the 
white paper focus on creating more employment, primarily with 
the help of state measures, and not so much on improving the 
competitiveness of European industry by reducing the costs for 
the companies. 
  The economic associations miss proposals that are aimed at 
improving the entrepreneurial framework conditions in the 
interest of investments, growth, and employment. They criticize 
the fact that, in contrast, there are recommendations that would 
result in new burdens on the companies. They also criticize the 
fact that the commitment to a multilateral trade system is 
linked to conditions that can at least be interpreted in 
different ways, and more or less veiled threats regarding a lack 
of good behavior by trading partners in other fields of 
politics, the environment, human rights, etc. 
  The medium-term strategy for growth, competitiveness, and 
employment that has been developed by the Commission is aimed at 
halving unemployment in Europe by the year 2000. This 
corresponds to the creation of at least 15 million jobs. In 
their statement, the two German top associations explain why the 
frequent reference of the white paper to the employment increase 
in the European Community during the second half of the 1980's 
and the U.S. employment miracle is misleading. 
<H5>  Against the Introduction of Environmental Taxes </H5>
  The Commission gives the following priorities for 
employment: 

  -  Education and training as well as life-long 
learning; 
  -  Raising external and internal flexibility; 
  -  Stronger 
decentralization and promotion of the individual's 
initiative; 
  -  Reducing the relative costs of low-qualified 
work; 
  -  Setting the course for a new employment policy; and 
  -  A 
response to new needs. 
  The top associations primarily criticize the last three 
items. They oppose the Commission's proposals to reduce taxes 
and social security contributions for low-qualified employees by 
30 to 40 percent. In the Commission's view, this could result 
in an increase in the number of jobs by 2 percent in countries 
with very high social security contributions. In the EU 
Commission's view, losses in revenues could be compensated by 
raising revenues in nother places -- in particular by 
introducing a tax on carbon dioxide emissions or by "taxing 
capital income at the source." 
  German industry doubts that such model calculations would 
correspond to reality. However, they already criticize the 
starting point of these considerations. Instead of paying 
low-qualified work for what it is worth, indirect subsidies are 
supposed to be provided via allowances for social security 
contributions. This would not correspond to the principle of 
equivalence in the insurance system. 
  The idea of shifting the tax burden from work to other 
factors, in particular the environment, would not improve the 
international competitiveness of European industry, either. The 
cost-neutral introduction of environmental taxes with a 
simultaneous reduction of labor cost would be a mock solution. 
The guiding and financing effects of such a tax would 
contradict each other, in the view of the economic associations. 
For economic and ecological reasons they reject the 
introduction of an energy tax on carbon dioxide emissions and 
other environmental taxes. 
  In particular with a view to the latest increase in 
petroleum 
tax and the decided increase in taxes on income in the form of 
the solidarity surcharge as of 1 January, there is no more 
leeway in Germany for a further increase in the tax burden. 
Losses in revenues, for instance in social security, must be 
compensated rather by budget savings and a restructuring of 
social services. The associations also reject a further taxing 
of capital yield as a possibility to compensate for a reduction 
of labor cost. 
  The associations criticize the Commission's proposals for a 
new employment policy. They could be misunderstood as a right 
to work and training. Furthermore, more intensive public labor 
exchange will hardly have any effect, at least not in Germany. 
  The associations are skeptical about ideas to use new needs 
for the so far allegedly undeveloped reserves of new employment 
opportunities and reject these ideas. These considerations are 
aiming at a new "social economy." Many recommendations are 
dangerously close to establishing work subsidized by the state, 
that is, a second labor market. 
<H5>  Warning Against Social Economy </H5>
  Instead, the top associations demand a policy to reduce 
labor 
costs with the following elements: 

  -  Raising the flexibility 
of the labor market; 
  -  Reducing the ancillary wage costs, 
including social security contributions; 
  -  More leeway in wage 
contracts to differentiate wages and salaries; 
  -  Reducing minimum 
wages; and 
  -  Making hiring easier and reducing costs for dismissal. 
  The EU's proposals for measures at the EU level focus on 
infrastructure and information. The top associations say that 
the Commission's proposal to establish efficient trans-European 
networks, in particular in the field of transportation and 
energy, is the correct priority. However, in the view of German 
industry, planning, financing, and construction of 
infrastructures should basically remain with the member states. 
<H5>  List With 26 Large Projects </H5>
  The commission has drawn up a list of 26 large projects that 
require investments of ECU82 billion by 1999. During this 
period, ECU13 billion will be used for energy networks. The 
Commission estimates that the priority projects of the European 
information structure will require ECU67 billion by 1999. To 
finance these projects, the Commission suggests allocating ECU20 
billion annually until 1999 from the EU budget and, at the same 
time, suggests the introduction of a new way for the EU to 
finance loans. 
  German industry calls this proposal particularly 
problematic. 
It says that financing the "infrastructure" offensive by raising 
means on the capital market via EU loans or convertible bonds by 
private or public project managers would result in a further 
increase in the EU's debts, which must, in the end, be paid by 
the member states. Furthermore, any source of income outside 
the budget counteracts the stability criteria anchored in the 
Maastricht Treaty. In addition, the associations expressed the 
fear that this "financial innovation" could mean the beginning 
of further expenditure programs financed by loans. In Europe's 
very own interests, German industry rejects loan financing by 
the EU. Above all, the expansion of telecommunications and 
energy projects should be carried out primarily by private 
investments. The associations call for giving private models 
priority also in the transportation sector.

<F P=106> [Report by Horst Engelhardt: "Large Enterprises Not in </F>
Demand"] 
  [Excerpt] The Berlin Trust Agency has practically closed 
the chapter of "international relations." The countdown has 
started: At the end of May, the last foreign office will close 
down in Paris. At the end of this month, the remaining Trust 
Agency commissioners for Austria and Switzerland will close 
their offices. 
  The worldwide network for the marketing of former GDR state 
enterprises was established in 1991. Since then, agreements 
with almost 900 foreign investors involving about 20 billion 
German marks [DM] have been concluded. A total of 146,000 jobs 
have been promised. This is approximately 10 percent of total 
investments and jobs in the Trust Agency's privatization balance. 
  Large enterprises were not in great demand. "The foreign 
investors acquired mainly medium-sized enterprises with a work 
force of 800-1,000," the director for international relations, 
Wolfgang Vehse, said. The great majority of investors in the 
new laender has come from neighboring European countries. 
  The number of Asians who signed take-over agreements with 
the 
Trust Agency is almost negligible. "Despite a permanent office 
in Tokyo, we have not managed to change the traditional 
procedure of the Japanese," Vehse said in an attempt to explain 
this phenomenon. In many cases, they took a long time for 
extensive examinations. Other investors reacted considerably 
faster, thus attaining some offers from rival contenders from 
the Far East. 
  Trust Agency Director Vehse expressed a certain respect for 
the Americans who concluded an astonishingly high number of 70 
agreements. For U.S. enterprises, in particular, the contract 
regulations prevailing in Germany, such as investment rules and 
the restraint on alienation, have been difficult to understand 
at times. For some U.S. Trust Agency customers, the investments 
in eastern Germany were in many cases the first leap across the 
Atlantic. [passage omitted]

<F P=106> ["jl" report: "The Traffic Light Is Yellow"] </F>
  [Text] Following the stabilization in western Germany, 
indications of a nascent recovery are mounting. In eastern 
Germany, growth has intensified; the upswing is no longer solely 
supported by transfers, but increasingly by independent driving 
forces. For the first time since the upheaval, investment 
dynamism in the new laender is having an effect on the labor 
market: The decline in employment and the increase in 
unemployment have meanwhile stopped. Next year, there will be 
more employed and fewer unemployed for the first time again. 
  In the old laender, one of the longest and most profound 
recessions of the postwar period has been overcome. After 
demand and production had followed a downward trend for the past 
two to three years, in the course of last year the economy got 
out of its slump thanks to comprehensive rationalization 
measures, cost reductions, and first stimuli of demand, in 
particular from the foreign markets. The traffic light of the 
economic development is meanwhile yellow all over the economy. 
It is, above all, export that has the best prospects. These 
prospects have improved not only the expectations by companies, 
but also the inclination toward investments. In contrast, 
private consumption will probably remain "waiting" for the time 
being: The decline in purchasing power because of continuing 
tax increases is too big. Since further burdens -- such as the 
nursing care insurance -- can be predicted and the expectations 
for income are primarily oriented toward the still unfavorable 
labor market prospects, private consumption can be expected to 
provide stimuli probably only in the later course of the 
recovery of the economic development. 
  For the development of industry, the FAZ [FRANKFURTER 
ALLGEMEINE ZEITUNG] economic indicator, which unites early 
indicators such as orders received, business climate, interest 
structure, foreign value of the German mark, share index, and 
offers of jobs, has been pointing upward for the past 10 months; 
most recently it has pointed upward quite intensively. The 
duration and scope of the upward movement now "clearly" indicate 
"a change," the assessment says. The upswing became "visible" 
first in the orders received from abroad, which have increased 
since the beginning of 1993. During the first quarter of 1993, 
orders from abroad were almost 9 percent higher in real terms 
than during the same period of the previous year. At the 
beginning of 1994, this development continued. As a result, 
export deliveries stabilized, following the preceding serious 
slump in the course of 1993, and slightly recovered during the 
second half of the year. Research institutes and the Council of 
Experts expect a clear real increase in exports this year. 
  In contrast, the production branches that are primarily 
oriented toward domestic economy are mostly still in a period of 
consolidation. However, domestic orders in the processing 
industry have also pointed toward stabilization since the second 
half of 1993. In January, they were 1.5 percent higher in real 
terms than in December 1993. At the beginning of this year, 
output in the producing industry was higher than at the same 
time last year for the first time since spring 1992. Capacity 
utilization, which had declined since autumn 1990, slightly 
increased during the last quarter of 1993. 
  The "clearest increase in utilization" was noted by the 
Munich Ifo Institute regarding preproducts, "an indicator of 
industrial development, which was reliable in the past." 
According to Ifo, the producers of preproducts look toward the 
further development of business "with increased confidence." In 
chemical industry orders received reportedly increased strongly 
in January, following a slight recovery during the fourth 
quarter of 1993. The latest official figures seem to confirm 
the observation of the institute: in January, orders received in 
the basic materials and producer goods industry increased above 
average compared with December. In the two-month comparison 
with last year (December/January), orders were 7 percent higher 
in real terms. Output in the basic material sector exceeded the 
corresponding level of the previous year by about 3 percent in 
real terms. 
  According to the economic development test in January, in 
the 
investment goods sector, too, the positive expectations have 
increase, above all because of the stimuli from abroad. While, 
however, there was still "skepticism" in electrical engineering 
and among the producers of delivery vans and trucks, 
machine-building, which was particularly hard hit by the 
recession until the middle of last year, now reports a further 
increased number of orders received, precision mechanics/optics 
seems to experience a gradual recovery. In the automobile 
industry, following the slump last year, the production and 
export of industrial vehicles seem to have been higher again in 
January/February than during the same period the previous year. 
The production of passenger cars for the first time stabilized 
in February at a very low level. According to the association, 
domestic orders received have improved slightly; however, 
domestic demand for industrial vehicles remains low. 
  Volkswagen has affirmed that it intends to make the planned 
investment of 5 billion marks [DM] in eastern Germany, even 
though a bit delayed. According to the "Ifo investors 
calculation for eastern Germany," the gross fixed investments of 
west German, east German, and foreign investors all over the 
economy will increase by another 15 percent in 1994. The 
(expected) amount of more than DM160 billion will then be almost 
twice as much as in 1991.

<F P=106> [F. Neumann report: "Investment in the New Laender: </F>
Slowdown in Industry, Expansion in Services"] 
  [Text] The Ifo Investors' Account for eastern Germany 
gives an overview of sectoral developments of investments in the 
new laender. For 1991, 1992, and 1993 the figures were 
calibrated to the (provisional figures) of the official 
statistics. In the total amounts the Ifo calculations for all 
these years are slightly above the official values. This is 
primarily due to a somewhat more positive assessment of trends 
in the important tertiary sector. For the 1994 projection, the 
basis of information was the investment plans of west and east 
German investors in the major economic sectors. These Ifo 
survey results were supplemented by assumptions on further 
trends in business startup investments and completed with the 
help of various information on foreign investment activity, 
investment in the Trust Agency realm and the vital area of 
green-field investments. 
<H5>  1993: Strong Investment Growth Persists </H5>
  In 1993, investments in the new laender (including eastern 
Berlin) grew vigorously. As the results of the Ifo Investors' 
Account for eastern Germany show, overall investment in plants 
and equipment in 1993 was more than DM140 billion and thus about 
one-fifth higher than in 1992. Investment activity in the new 
laender was therefore much more favourable than in western 
Germany. Compared to 1992, when investments in eastern Germany 
increased by one-third, the growth rate, as expected, 
decelerated. In the tertiary sector investments expanded at an 
above-average rate (by about two-fifths). This expansion was 
mainly attributable to the sectors "housing" and "other 
services." The emphasis in housing was on renovation, although 
new housing construction is gaining in importance. 
  The umbrella category "other services" contains various 
activities such as hotels and gastronomy, liberal professions, 
human and veterinary medicine, leasing and investment management 
companies, commercial developers, consumer services (e.g., dry 
cleaning and laundries), and commercial services (e.g., 
engineering consultants, business consultants). In this diverse 
sector there was a strong upturn in construction activity (new 
hotels, establishment of industrial estates). 
  Construction also displayed above-average investment gains. 
Despite complaints of sluggish approval procedures and delays in 
public contract awards, contractors are profiting from pent-up 
demand in the infrastructure realm and especially from necessary 
renovation of the housing stock, which is providing strong 
stimulus to small and medium-sized businesses. 
  In the other sectors, investment growth has slowed down 
considerably. Investment in plant and equipment in 
manufacturing, transportation, communication and the public 
sector (including nonprofit organizations) exceeded last year's 
levels by about one-tenth. The originally much more positive 
investment plans in manufacturing were thus not fully achieved. 
The slowdown in transportation and communications was, not 
surprising, considering the unusually strong expansion in 1992 
by the German Post Office (Telekom). Budget constraints slowed 
down investment growth in the public sector. In the energy 
sector (including mining) the long-standing conflict over east 
German energy-supply contracts has curbed an originally much 
more positive development. 
  Ascertaining investments in commerce is particularly 
difficult. On the one hand, the expansion and modernization of 
existing locations is continuing, especially by western Germany 
retail chains, and logistic facilities are being expanded. 
However, extensive new construction volume and considerable 
(and controversial) expansion of commercial space is going to 
newly constructed, green-field industrial estates. In most 
cases, these major projects are not built by the trading 
enterprises themselves but by special project groups, real 
estate funds, or developers, and then leased out. With the 
normal determination of investments according to the ownership 
principle, a large portion of investments used by trading firms 
(especially real estate) does not appear under commerce but 
under the owner in the service sector. For this reason the 1993 
investment figures for commerce will at best match last year's 
levels. 
<H5>  Decelerated Growth in 1994 </H5>
  The Ifo calculations point to continued investment growth in 
the new laender, albeit at a slower pace than in 1993. 
  Present plans indicate that 1994 investments will amount to 
over DM160 billion, nearly 15 percent more than in 1993. The 
service sector will continue its above-average growth, whereas 
investments in the producing sector (energy and water supply, 
mining, manufacturing, construction) will only expand by 
one-tenth due to the expected stagnation of capital expenditure 
in the manufacturing industry. 
  In 1991 and 1992, investment in manufacturing grew rapidly, 
but in 1993 it was clear that west German investors especially 
were holding back due to the economic downturn. Some planned 
investments were postponed, others delayed. In 1994 for the 
first time, west German spending in the industry of the new 
laender will no longer reach the volume of the previous year. 
  The favourable demand situation in construction, however, 
should lead to continuously increasing investments. The 
energy/mining sector should increase its capital expenditure by 
a relatively strong 20 percent in 1994, especially as a result 
of the noticeably stepped-up investment activities in 
electricity supply and district heating and, in the wake of 
initial privatization successes, also in mining. 
  Spending in the transportation and communication sector 
will grow by about one-tenth to DM26 billion. Deutsche Bahn AG 
in particular will further intensify its investment activities 
in the new laender (expansion and modernization of the railway 
system). The investments of Bundespost will show slight growth 
after having reached new heights last year. Increased spending 
is also expected in the sector of "other transportation" 
(private road haulage and parcel deliveries, airports, travel 
agencies). 
  Service enterprises will again strongly increase their 
capital expenditure (by one-quarter, on average). Whereas the 
banking and insurance investment boom, which began immediately 
following the mid-1990 Economic and Currency Union, is now over, 
expansion in other services continues. 
  In the housing sector, a spending plus of nearly 30 percent 
is expected, with a stronger focus on new housing construction 
alongside modernization and renovation. A strong pace of 
expansion is again anticipated in the sector of "other 
services." True, the nearly one-third growth will not be as 
high as in 1993, but a later upward correction cannot be ruled 
out due to difficulties in assessing exactly when investments 
will be made in existing and new industrial estates. 
<H5>  Per Capita Investment in Eastern Germany Surpasses the </H5>
Western Level 
  The stronger expansion of investment in the new laender has 
meant that in 1993 for the first time per capita investments in 
eastern Germany (nearly DM9,100) were higher than in western 
Germany (nearly DM9,000). For 1994, calculations indicate per 
capita spending of DM10,350 in the east compared to DM9,300 in 
the west. The sectoral distribution shows that the per capita 
western levels were visibly surpassed in 1992 in the sectors of 
transportation and communication, state, and producing 
industries. In contrast, per capita spending in housing still 
remains clearly below the western level. Also clearly below 
western levels is per capita spending in the services. 
<H5>  Slower Pace of Western Involvement </H5>
  The restructuring process in the new laender is primarily 
being supported by the engagement of western investors, who are 
transferring not only capital but technical know-how and 
managerial experience. With the growing economic linkages 
between the two parts of Germany, a separate determination of 
west German investment in the new laender is becoming 
increasingly difficult. 
  The latest calculations of the Ifo Institute indicate that 
west German and foreign firms (excluding housing) invested 
nearly DM50 billion in the new laender, nearly a 20-percent 
increase in 1992. West German and foreign investment is also 
expected to increase in 1994, albeit at a weaker pace. Present 
calculations forecast spending of nearly DM55 billion, about 
one-tenth more than in 1993. In the sectoral distribution of 
spending, the trend observed in 1993 holds on. Whereas spending 
continues to expand in the energy/mining and construction 
sectors, current plans indicate that west German and foreign 
investment in manufacturing will fall slightly below last year's 
levels for the first time. This slight decline conceals a 
relatively strong plunge in west German firms' investments, 
whereas the "genuine" foreign investment activity will most 
likely increase as a result of special developments in 
chemistry, iron and steel, and paper and board production. Due 
to a high starting level, western investments in the 
transportation and communication sector will only increase 
slightly, and commerce should record a decline. Strong 
expansion of western investment is again expected in the 
services (excluding housing). This development is solely 
attributable to the area of "other services" (especially 
industrial estates, new hotel construction, and other major 
projects). 
  Although the investments of western companies will expand at 
a slower pace, they will continue to make a major contribution 
to growth in total capital expenditure in the new laender. In 
1993, 57 percent of investments in the east German business 
sector (excluding housing) came from west German and foreign 
investors (1991: 44 percent, 1992: 56 percent). Of note is that 
investments of Deutsche Bahn AG in the new laender (Reichsbahn) 
have come from a special federal fund and have not been included 
in western business investment. If this area is included, the 
share of western investment in the business sector increases to 
more than 60 percent.

<F P=106> [Commentary by Lothar Ruehl: "Help From China"] </F>
  [Text] China's success in the United Nations in connection 
with North Korea is a severe setback for the authority of U.S. 
diplomacy and the credibility of the United Nations itself: 
Beijing prevented a UN Security Council request to the address 
of Pyongyang to open all its declared nuclear technology 
facilities to international inspectors. The council had to 
content itself with a mere "appeal to all parties involved" to 
comply with their international obligations. Thus, any 
one-sidedness toward North Korea was avoided, the only "party 
involved" in the controversy that is suspected of noncompliance 
with the Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty. The UN secretary 
general, the U.S. secretary of state, the Japanese prime 
minister, and the South Korean president were told in Beijing 
that pressure on North Korea would only be "counterproductive." 
  Russia agrees with China on this issue. Thus, China has 
backing for the political protection of North Korea in its 
conflict with the United States. North Korea is not isolated, 
which is what Washington and West Europe had hoped, but U.S. 
policy has been blocked in the same way as the United Nations 
itself. West Europe and Japan are neutralized in this 
constellation, France and Britain, the two West European veto 
and nuclear powers in the Security Council, have been 
outmaneuvered. 
  If the United States, whose Defense Secretary Perry only 
recently stated that his country would even "wage a war" to 
prevent North Korean nuclear arms, is unable to enforce 
compliance with this treaty, North Korea will remain free to 
build nuclear bombs. It will even be able to pass them on to 
other countries, particularly the Middle East, thus receiving 
valuable foreign currency and initiating proliferation. In view 
of the hesitant and wavering U.S. policy, China and Russia, both 
of which are not interested in a nuclear buildup in North Korea, 
will take over mediating efforts in Asia, thus getting closer to 
their parallel objectives -- namely to force back Western 
influence.

<F P=106> [Commentary by Thankmar von Muenchhausen: "Between Ill </F>
Feelings and Understanding"] 
  [Text] Ill feelings in an alliance is one reason to look 
at what has been achieved and to create clarity for the future. 
This also applies to the recent irritation between Germany and 
France that was cleared up after some discussion. Those who 
were involved in Paris and Bonn are being reminded of the 
importance of cooperation that proved its worth in the past 
three decades. Yet, the two partners are also becoming aware of 
the difference in interests. 
  Trying to analyze the ill feelings that have been revealed 
by 
the controversial statements of the French ambassador in Bonn 
brings back to mind former concerns in connection with German 
unification and the emergence of a larger Germany that could be 
heard from the political class in France after the fall of the 
wall. It was the old fear of the "German uncertainties" and a 
special German course toward the East. 
  Those who are looking for confirmation for this latent fear 
in France will have no trouble finding it. Foreign Minister 
Genscher's pressing for international recognition of the 
constituent republics of the disintegrating Yugoslavia was seen 
as German efforts to acquire a status of supremacy in the 
Balkans. Similarly, one could challenge the federal 
chancellor's efforts to facilitate the Central and East European 
countries' move to get closer to the West: Where Germany pleads 
for cooperation on behalf of European stability, it might be 
trying to protect its own "lebensraum" on the basis of 
institutions. The discussion on enlargement and/or deepening of 
the European Union [EU], which is also being conducted between 
Bonn and Paris, is more than splitting hairs. It indicates 
differences in the dynamism. 
  After the shock caused by unification, the terrified French 
found solace in the fact that the cost of it had a greater 
impact on Germany's economic strength than they had envisaged, 
and that they were hence left with fewer means for 
economic-political expansion. Those who looked further ahead 
realized very soon that such a consolation would become less 
significant as the years went by, and that what started out as a 
handicap would be transformed into a competitive advantage 
before long. Even now, trade with the East accounts for 6-7 
percent of German foreign trade, while in the case of France, it 
is only 2.5 percent. The hesitation of the French oil concern, 
Elf Aquitaine, to tackle the reconstruction of the Leuna 
refinery, the biggest foreign investment in the new laender, is 
only one example of the difficulties on the new markets. France 
lacks the economic possibilities of restimulating the "Little 
Entente," the French sphere of influence between the German 
Reich and the Soviet Union in the era between the two wars. 
Independent of historic experiences and sympathies, governments 
and enterprises in the former East bloc are principally banking 
on the Germans. 
  In this unusual situation after the end of the bipartition 
of 
Europe, the German Government has only one chance of weakening 
latent distrust, which exists not only in France: the readiness 
for close cooperation with the partners, especially with our 
neighbor France. Foreign Minister Kinkel emphasized this 
readiness in a programmatic speech in Paris and rejected "solo 
actions and special paths" and "thinking in terms of spheres of 
influence." The four-year-old offer for Franco-German 
coordination in the sphere of ostpolitik, which has not been 
sufficiently used so far, was extended by the German foreign 
minister to the EU: a rewarding task for the desired identity of 
united Europe, which is to go beyond the level of trade. 
  What has been defined as the horizon by the German planners 
in careful agreement with Paris is not limited to the Central 
European reformist states and the Baltic Republics but, taking 
economic facts into account, also includes Russia and Ukraine. 
Time is short. The year in which Germany and then France will 
have the presidency in the Union provides the timeframe. With 
some exaggeration, one could conclude that de Gaulle's vision of 
a Europe "from the Atlantic to the Urals" is being taken more 
seriously today in Bonn than in Paris. Still, the German side 
is trying to avoid the impression of being fixed too much on 
ostpolitik. The federal foreign minister has, therefore, called 
for an active European policy in the Mediterranean, which was 
the declared objective of President Mitterrand when he first 
took office. The Islamic danger in Algeria shows that this 
cause is most urgent but also very risky. 
  It is one of the good sides in the Franco-German 
relationship 
that the worries about the effects of German ostpolitik, which 
date back to the era of Bismarck, also have a positive effect 
for France: the understanding that Germany may pursue interests 
of its own in the East without bad intentions. Out of "reason 
of state" and a sense for "realpolitik," French politicians, 
based on their own experience, do show understanding, even with 
a slight connotation of resignation. The fact that the German 
view has changed since the dissolution of the East bloc is a 
matter of course for the French and has been accepted. In the 
view of the French, joint action has become very important, 
particularly because new possibilities have emerged for the 
Germans.

<F P=106> [Interview with Foreign Minister Alain Juppe by Charles </F>
Lambroschini; place and date not given: "Employment in France 
Also Depends on Asia" -- first paragraph is LE FIGARO 
introduction] 
  [Text] Alain Juppe left Paris yesterday for a tour of Asia 
which is intended, he said, to make up for the "negligence" 
which Paris has shown toward some countries in the region. The 
foreign minister will visit Japan, India, and China. On 6 
April, he will join Edouard Balladur in Beijing for a visit 
which is particularly significant because it is doubly symbolic. 
The prime minister's visit will take place within a few weeks 
of the 30th anniversary of the restoration of diplomatic 
relations between France and China by General de Gaulle. 
Following the normalization jointly agreed on in January, this 
visit will also confirm the end of the quarrel started by the 
sales of arms to Taiwan under the Socialist governments. 
  [Lambroschini] You are starting a vast tour of Asia. Do you 
really think that France can play a role on a theater of 
operations which is so far removed from its natural sphere of 
influence, namely Europe? 
  [Juppe] I think so. For several years, we have shown, if 
not indifference, then at least a degree of negligence toward 
some Asian countries. For instance, the last bilateral visit by 
a foreign minister to Japan and India date back to 1987. 
However, in this region, France can play a dual role. First, 
it must have an increased economic presence in the most dynamic 
area of the world. Employment in France also depends on Asia. 
Overall, our market share in the area is around 2 percent, in 
other words half that of Germany. Second, France must also play 
a political role. We have had a political dialogue with China 
for 30 years. I think that France can also add a dimension to 
its relations with Japan which is not exclusively commercial. 
Finally, it is important not to forget countries with smaller 
populations but in which we have a very longstanding tradition: 
I am thinking of the countries of former Indochina: Vietnam, 
Laos, and Cambodia. For this last country, France has played an 
essential role, in the UN framework, in the organization of 
elections which, after 25 years of war, have paved the way for 
peace. 
  [Lambroschini] You are going to participate in Edouard 
Balladur's visit to China which will confirm the normalization 
of relations between Paris and Beijing. Now that the dispute 
created by the arms sales to Taiwan has been removed, what 
positive effects can France expect from China? 
  [Juppe] The prime minister's visit will mainly be a 
political visit which falls within the framework of the 30th 
anniversary of the establishment of our diplomatic relations. 
When the government was formed last year, I noted that our 
relations with China were not good. We know what had cast a 
shadow over them: a number of arms sales to Taiwan. My 
objective was to reestablish the political relationship between 
France and China, because it is in our interest to do so. The 
aim was not to abandon our relations with Taiwan, but to return 
to a degree of restraint which had been forgotten. We have 
achieved that because, by common consent, we decided to restore 
warmer relations in January. That will be demonstrated by the 
prime minister's presence which, I repeat, has a primarily 
political dimension. Second, we hope that our economic 
relations will be developed in a whole series of sectors in 
which China needs cooperation -- telecommunications, 
transportation, aeronautics, urban development, energy, and so 
forth. 
  [Lambroschini] But France's commercial lag cannot be 
explained only by the Taiwan affair. Do you not think that our 
businesses are more timid than the German or Italian competition? 
  [Juppe] The deterioration in the political situation has 
played a role, but this is probably not the only explanation. 
Our businesses must also be encouraged to show more dynamism. 
Our trade deficit with China is 12 billion francs [Fr]. This 
is therefore a challenge to us. I think that if the French 
Government shows real determination, the industrialists are 
capable of mobilizing. With Singapore, we have a trade surplus 
of Fr2 billion. With Korea, our relations are balanced. 
  [Lambroschini] In 1964, France was the first Western country 
to restore relations with Beijing. Why did French businesses 
not profit from this advantage? 
  [Juppe] This advantage has been very useful. Even if 
Germany is doing twice as well, we already have a market share 
which is not negligible: It is at the same level as that of 
Britain. And yet, since 1964, we have perhaps rested too much 
on the idea that it was enough to have good political relations 
for trade to follow. China has changed. It has swung into a 
different system -- that of a market economy in which, aside 
from a few big contracts which are the result of a largely 
political choice, the decisionmaking process is much more 
decentralized. We must adapt our working methods to this new 
Chinese situation and encourage businesses to engage in direct 
dialogue. 
  [Lambroschini] Is it not humiliating for France to note 
that there are double standards? The United States has also 
sold "offensive" weapons to Taiwan. And yet, the reprisals only 
affected France. 
  [Juppe] I do not want to go back over that. We have opened 
a new chapter, let us not go back over it. But, you know, 
international relations are still based on power relationships. 
  [Lambroschini] Having said that, the Chinese reacted very 
badly when U.S. Secretary of State Warren Christopher preached 
to them on human rights. 
  [Juppe] France has absolutely no intention of turning a 
blind eye to the human rights problems in China. During Mr. 
Balladur's visit, we will speak clearly on this subject. When 
Mr. Christopher went to China, there was obviously great 
tension, but I would nonetheless like to point out that the aim 
of the visit was not to find out whether or not the United 
States would grant China most favored nation status. It already 
has it. The aim was simply to find out whether it was going to 
be called into question. Let us not have any complexes. We will 
say what we have to say. But we do not need any lessons in 
morality from anybody. 
  [Lambroschini] How do you reconcile the defense of human 
rights and the preservation of economic interests? 
  [Juppe] This is a problem which is not specifically Chinese. 
We have numerous commercial interlocutors and partners who are 
not irreproachable in terms of human rights. If I started to 
draw up the list, I do not know where I would stop. Our 
attitude is therefore very clear. We remain loyal to our 
principles, saying to our interlocutors that we are not 
satisfied with the existing situation. At the same time, we are 
defending France's interests. 
  [Lambroschini] When you say that the prime minister's visit 
is primarily a political visit, what strategic impact can France 
have in this region? 
  [Juppe] It is true that China may seem remote and that 
Europe's security is our main priority. But we have reasons for 
affinity with China. Our two countries are permanent members of 
the Security Council. This responsibility often leads us to 
compare our views and sometimes to coordinate them. Second, 
France and China are nuclear powers, and sometimes have the same 
kinds of concerns. A political dialogue between our countries is 
therefore useful. I would like to add that we are interested in 
the stability of the whole region because France is a world 
power. I cannot neglect this area in which it has cultural and 
historical interests. The fact that Vietnam, Cambodia, and Laos 
are envisaging joining ASEAN shows quite clearly that we stand 
to gain from having a presence and having dialogue with China. 
  [Lambroschini] Do you see China as a stabilizing factor in 
the region? Or do you think that this new economic power will 
necessarily become a military power which could be tempted by 
hegemony? 
  [Juppe] China is already a power. The fact that this area 
is not protected from strong tensions is perfectly clear. There 
are often clashes in relations between China and Japan. 
Moreover, we must not disregard North Korea and the danger 
which its rejection of the nonproliferation rules could present 
for the region, particularly South Korea. For the time being, I 
see China as a factor of stability. At all events, it must be 
encouraged to move in this direction. 
  [Lambroschini] What do you hope that your visit to Tokyo 
will achieve? A reduction in the enormous trade deficit between 
Japan and France? 
  [Juppe] This is our main trade deficit, on the order of Fr23 
billion. We must clearly not resign ourselves to this 
situation. A few spectacular successes show that French 
businesses can penetrate the Japanese market. And not only the 
big ones or the luxury industries. There are also successes for 
small- and medium-sized businesses. Through a system of 
information and support for our companies, we hope to extend 
this trend. I also note that, for three years, our trade 
balance with Japan has been improving. 
  [Lambroschini] But Japan must make parallel efforts. The 
authorities are doing nothing to encourage the entry of foreign 
products. Do you think that you will be heeded this time? 
  [Juppe] I am not sure that a visit is enough to ensure that 
you are heeded. But, in the future, we will also be able to use 
the instruments created within the framework of the Uruguay 
Round negotiations, especially the World Trade Organization 
[WTO]. We must ensure that the rules of the game are more 
clearly defined in a number of fundamental spheres. 
  [Lambroschini] Japan is agreeing to import rice because the 
national harvest has been bad. But a campaign of denigration 
was immediately started: "This rice tastes bad or has weevils." 
The same blocking technique was formerly used against our 
cheeses. How can the creation of the WTO, to take over from 
GATT, persuade the Japanese to import more? 
  [Juppe] The Japanese tenacity is well-known. For years, the 
Americans have been thrown off course by it. That is no reason 
to give up. These practices are unfair, they are not in 
accordance with the philosophy of GATT. We will therefore take 
advantage of this new international body which contains a 
procedure for the prevention and settlement of trade conflicts. 
If that does not suffice, it would be useful for the European 
Union [EU] to equip itself with equivalent retaliation methods. 
In the international sphere, only the language of power is 
understood. 
  [Lambroschini] But the EU has a great weakness. In reality, 
Japan is facing 12 countries which are competing with each other. 
  [Juppe] Theoretically that is not the case, because, with 
regard to international trade issues, the EU is united. But the 
facts are there. Japan has political superiority: It is easier 
to negotiate when you are expressing the viewpoint of just one 
government than when you are expressing the viewpoint of 12 
states. In addition, it must be admitted that, culturally, 
Japanese society agrees to make sacrifices to protect itself. 
Domestic prices are very high: This makes it possible to find 
flexible export margins. Some of the Twelve are almost allergic 
to regarding the EU as an entity. For many of our partners, 
this Union is merely a market. For us, it must be a power. It 
is a market which must have the capacity to organize and defend 
itself. 
  [Lambroschini] Paradoxically, France and Japan are in the 
same camp opposite the United States which, despite the recent 
GATT agreement establishing the foundations of the WTO, is again 
using the reprisals of the 301 provision against Tokyo. 
  [Juppe] We have vigorously condemned this practice which is 
contrary to the spirit of the WTO. Even if, legally, this WTO 
does not yet exist. You are aware of the battle which the 
Twelve fought to improve the instruments of EU commercial policy. 
  The decision was made on 15 December, but experience shows 
that having the documents is not enough, you also have to have 
the will. However, I am not sure that it still exists among the 
European officials of this sector. 
  [Lambroschini] In the strategic sphere, the impression is 
that Japan feels more confident. Do you see this increase in 
power as a stabilizing factor in Asia or, instead, as a danger? 
  [Juppe] I do not want to give an evasive answer, but it may 
be both. It is an illusion to imagine that a country which has 
this economic power can remain a political dwarf. There is a 
logic in the lives of nations and states. This logic and this 
desire for power must be channeled in the right direction. That 
is why the political dialogue with Japan strikes me as so 
important. 
  [Lambroschini] Do you think that Japan might one day be 
tempted by the acquisition of nuclear weapons? After all, it 
has neighbors who have the bomb -- China and India -- and 
another, North Korea, which dreams of having it. 
  [Juppe] Japan has given constitutional pledges and I see no 
reason to think that it is tempted to change its line. 
Moreover, the aim of French diplomacy is nonproliferation. And 
this is also something which we must express clearly to our 
Japanese interlocutors. In Tokyo, I will explain why we have 
such a firm attitude on the question of North Korea. For us, 
the fact that this country has withdrawn from the 
Nonproliferation Treaty (NPT) and that it refuses to keep its 
promises to the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) is 
unacceptable. 
  [Lambroschini] Are you in favor of Japan joining the 
Security Council as a permanent member? 
  [Juppe] This is not 1945. We must take account of the new 
situation in the world. We have no objections in principle to 
Japan joining the Security Council, but we would add two or 
three considerations. The first is that being a Security 
Council member does not only give you rights. It also implies 
duties and obligations. In particular, participating in 
peacekeeping operations. Japan has already agreed to that with 
its involvement in Cambodia. The second consideration is that 
there are regional balances to be respected. If Japan and 
Germany join, it is obvious that the big countries of the south, 
even if they are less economically developed, also have a reason 
to join. 
  [Lambroschini] Is political cooperation between France and 
Japan limited to the nuclear problem and the United Nations? 
  [Juppe] Not at all. For instance, with regard to Third 
World aid, I think that we need to create a synergy. France is 
one of the few countries in the world to reaffirm that 
development aid must remain a priority. At the last G-7 summit, 
it was Japan which, with France, was the country which was most 
receptive to this idea of an additional effort for Africa. 
  [Lambroschini] For a long time Japan has been told: Pay and 
shut up. But should we not expect problems when Japan wants a 
say? 
  [Juppe] That is precisely what I mean by political dialogue. 
That consists of saying: Let us talk and pay, each according to 
our abilities. 
  [Lambroschini] You are also going to Delhi. Do you hope to 
develop relations between France and India, which are still 
limited? At a time when that huge country is starting on the 
path to economic liberalization, France is only India's eighth 
biggest commercial partner. 
  [Juppe] Our relations with India are inadequate. In the 
economic sphere, we have some difficult disputes which are not 
encouraging our businesses. They must be settled. There is the 
dispute over the construction of the HBJ [expansion unknown] gas 
pipeline or the problems connected with the construction of the 
Dulmasti dam in Kashmir. It is not easy to find a solution, but 
we must make an active effort to do so, because we stand to gain 
from developing our bilateral relations. Mr. Rao, the current 
prime minister, has undertaken a policy of economic 
modernization which is producing good results. The 200 or 300 
million inhabitants who have already entered the consumer 
society represent a very big market. 
  [Lambroschini] It is said that the Chinese market is 
commercially more exciting but that the Indian market is less 
dangerous politically. 
  [Juppe] In all cases you have to take risks and show 
perseverance. It is true that our commercial relations with 
India are balanced, whereas we have a Fr12-billion deficit with 
China. Our market share in India is larger than the one we have 
in China. 
  [Lambroschini] Like China, India is experiencing great 
tensions: religious, ethnic, and social. How do you view the 
dialectic between this economic growth which is taking shape and 
the archaism of some of India's structures? 
  [Juppe] With modesty... It is not for France to try to 
outline social development in such a huge and complex country 
with such strong cultural traditions. Our role is to tell India 
that we are ready to work with it. I think that we have 
something to contribute here too. The preferential dialogue 
between Moscow and Delhi is no longer what it was, because one 
of the partners -- the former USSR -- has changed profoundly. 
That gives us a window of opportunity which we must use.

<F P=106> [Article by Jacques Cordy: "A Good Neighbor, Van Den Brande </F>
Pays Homage to France"] 
  [Excerpts] Forty-eight hours in France: The visit by 
Minister- President Van Den Brande began on Tuesday [29 March] 
with extensive contacts with the French business world, at a 
lunch organized by the Belgo-Luxembourg Chamber of Commerce in 
Paris. 
  On Wednesday, he is to meet with President Mitterrand at the 
Elysee [office of the president] and Prime Minister Balladur at 
Matignon [prime minister's office], and also with European 
Affairs Minister Alain Lamassoure and Foreign Trade Minister 
Gerard Longuet. The Paris agenda also includes meetings with, 
among others, OECD Secretary General Paye; the Belgian 
ambassador to France, the Belgian ambassador to the OECD, and 
the Belgian ambassador to UNESCO. 
  Mr. Van Den Brande is to meet many business managers and 
representatives of major companies. [passage omitted] 
  The minister-president of Flanders, accompanied by his 
colleagues and about 20 Flemish journalists, outlined the aims 
of this visit. It comes after visits already made to the 
Netherlands, Luxembourg, and Great Britain, and will probably be 
followed by a visit to Germany. He evidently intends to acquire 
international status. In addition to the economic and cultural 
contacts established by these meetings, he also expects to win 
political recognition for himself at the European level. It is 
in a spirit of "good neighborliness" that he has headed south 
as, as he puts it: "Flanders is France's newest and youngest 
neighbor." He also wants to indicate that France is Flander's 
second most important trading partner after Germany (202000060100f 
Flemish exports). 
  Concerning recent takeovers of Flemish companies by major 
French groups, he intends to remind his interlocutors that 
Flanders believes that "certain sectors must remain in Flemish 
hands," and that cooperation with foreign companies must be done 
"on an equal footing." He will also add that : "The Belgian 
facade presented by a number of these companies does not 
constitute a certificate of safe conduct allowing them to 
operate in Flanders." [passage omitted]

  [Text] Paris, April 1 (AFP) -- For the first time since 
Edouard Balladur became prime minister a year ago, a majority 
(54 percent) of Frenchmen do not believe the conservative 
government is moving in the right direction, a survey showed. 
  The survey, carried out after local elections last weekend 
and due to appear in the PROFESSION POLITIQUE magazine dated 
April 8, shows a 10 percent rise in dissatisfaction with the 
government since a similar survey carried out at the beginning 
of March. 
  In the intervening period, there has been criticism of his 
handling of plans to cut the minimum wage for young people which 
led to a wave of violent protests across France. 
  The survey was carried out among a representative sample of 
805 adults contacted by telephone on Monday [28 March]. 
  It found that the government's rating fell fastest among 
right-wing voters (from 82 to 69 percent) while his rating among 
people with left-wing sympathies remained practically unchanged 
at 18 percent.

<F P=106> [Report by Alexandra Schwartzbrod: "Francois Leotard Calls </F>
On Arms Industry"] 
  [Excerpts] Convened at lunchtime yesterday by Defense 
Minister Francois Leotard and General Arms Delegate Henri Conze, 
French arms manufacturers were treated to a lecture on 
cost-effectiveness. This lecture should be followed in the 
coming weeks by a series of private lessons destined to examine 
with a fine-tooth comb each program included in the military 
programming law for 1995-2000. 
  There were a dozen people around the table, representing the 
major contractors and the professional unions: Louis Gallois 
(Aerospatiale), Serge Dassault (Dassault Aviation and GIFAS 
[Associaton of French Aerospace Manufacturers]; Alain Gomez 
(Thomson-CSF), Noel Forgeard (Matra Defense), Jean-Francois 
Bigay (Eurocopter), Emile Blanc (SNPE [National Powders and 
Explosives Company] and GIAT [Industrial Group for Ground 
Weapons] Industrie; Jean Climaud (SPER [Professional Association 
of Electronic and Radioelectric Industries]); Jean-Claude 
Albrecht (Giat Industries), Herve Cheneau (Directorate of Naval 
Constructions), and Herve Ardity (of the Richelieu Committee of 
small- and mid-sized companies). [passage omitted] 
  The industrial representatives yesterday were all given the 
opportunity to air their views on the subject and to explain 
their working methods. They agreed that a decree should be 
passed obliging them to work together to a greater extent , to 
avoid overlap, and therefore that they should work more closely 
with the military chiefs of staff. Most of them reiterated the 
need for orders covering several years at a time. For his part, 
the general arms delegate asked the primary contractors to avoid 
taking responsibility away from their subcontractors or imposing 
cost cutting on them, in order to preserve the fabric of small- 
and medium-sized companies. 
  The discussion, started yesterday by the Defense Ministry, 
will continue at a swift pace and should result in the unveiling 
of a number of measures by the summer. In the meantime, unless 
there is a last-minute change of plan, the military programming 
law should be submitted to the president of the Republic at next 
week's Defense Council meeting, before being put before the 
cabinet on 20 April and presented for parliamentary debate at 
the end of May.

<F P=106> [Report by Patrice-Henry Desaubliaux: "General Morillon </F>
Appointed to the Rapid Deployment Force"] 
  [Text] General of the Army Corps Philippe Morillon will be 
appointed at this morning's Council of Ministers meeting to take 
command of the FAR [Rapid Deployment Force]. He will take over 
at the head of this large unit from General Bertrand de la 
Presle who, a few days ago, himself took over from General Jean 
Cot as head of the UNPROFOR [UN Protection Force] troops in the 
former Yugoslavia. 
  We all remember the "Philippe of Bosnia," or "General 
Courage" of one year ago. General Morillon, with the backing of 
Paris, took the front seat in a perilous mission to evacuate 
thousands of wounded people from the Muslim enclaves of Cerska 
and Srebenica. He did this in the face of hostile Serbian 
besiegers. He also did this, it should be admitted, scorning UN 
guidelines for "good" conduct. We all remember his voice, 
serious, warm, and full of emotion, and his words of resistance 
transmitted essentially to the West on the only radio that then 
connected him with the outside world. 
  General Morillon had to leave Bosnia a few months later 
when, 
in the summer, General Cot was asked to take charge of the 
UNPROFOR troops. After being granted leave for recuperation and 
to write "an account of the most absurd war" entitled To 
Believe and To Dare, the Chronicle of Sarajevo, he was 
employed as an adviser to the Defense Ministry. This was a 
holding post for a soldier today aged 50. 
  The initial plan of the French chiefs of staff was reported 
to be that General Morillon, with his experience of leading men 
and peacekeeping operations, should be made available to the 
United Nations to strengthen the limited resources of the 
international organization's chiefs of staff in New York, a body 
that is far too small. Butrus Butrus-Ghali did not accept 
France's proposal, doubtless because he did not want to 
displease certain diplomats, whom he could have upset not so 
much from the point of view of their comfort, but rather their 
very anglo-saxon habits and style. 
<H5>  Tenth Anniversary </H5>
  The FAR is celebrating its 10th anniversary this year. 
Created when the Land Army was still composed of three corps, 
it replied to a major concern that was largely political: 
demonstrating France's desire to be, in the event of major 
conflict in central Europe, not just solidly behind the allies 
but immediately at their side. The force had to be capable of 
being deployed "quickly and far." 
  Now, this idea of rapid deployment is gaining ground. It 
lies at the heart of the thinking behind the new white paper on 
defense. Since the threat from central Europe has diminished, 
the Land Army has, to some extent, been called upon to "deploy 
itself far and wide" since all of its operational resources -- 
120,000 men in eight or nine divisions -- must be capable of 
"reaching out" over long distances. 
  The FAR will thus increasingly share its unique mission with 
the mechanized armored corps. As a reserve force, it will 
retain its airborne capacity and as a result will be equipped 
with lighter resources. It will comprise 45,000 men and, for a 
few weeks, will still consist of five divisions: the 11th 
Parachute Division, the 6th Light Armored Division, the 9th 
Marine Infantry Division, the 4th Airborne Division; and the 
27th Alpine Division. It is the latter which, on 1 July, will 
be subordinated to the 3rd Army Corps where, with increased 
equipment, it will become the 27th Mountain Infantry Division.

  [Text] Pontedilegno, Italy, April 2 (AFP) -- Northern 
League leader Umberto Bossi Saturday [2 April] rejected Silvio 
Berlusconi, his erstwhile electoral ally, as a candidate for the 
post of prime minister. 
  Speaking from this northern Italian town where he is taking 
a 
few days holiday, Bossi said his federalist party was insisting 
on one of its members becoming premier. 
  "We cannot give in on this point. I repeat, Berlusconi 
cannot be president of the Council (prime minister)," he said. 
  But he did seem to allow for a way out to the dispute 
between 
the three parties which emerged victorious from last week's 
general elections, by saying: "If it is not possible to find a 
solution to the problem of making a square out of a circle, the 
League can do many things, such as offer external support 
without entering the government." 
  Bossi, who did not take part in initial talks Friday in 
Milan 
between his own party and Berlusconi, leader of the Forza Italia 
(Go, Italy) party, said he would attend the next meeting 
scheduled for Wednesday. 
  "The League must be in a position to influence and easily 
foster change," Bossi said. 
  The Northern League and Forza Italia are in a fragile 
alliance with the right-wing National Alliance. 
  But the National Alliance, led by the neo-fascists, favours 
greater central control while the Northern League wants greater 
autonomy for the rich industrial north of the country.

  [Text] The Easter break will be a short one as far as the 
politicians are concerned. Silvio Berlusconi has retreated to 
his villa at Maccherio; Umberto Bossi has gone to Ponte di 
Legno; Gianfranco Fini has gone to Anzio; Achille Occhetto has 
gone to Monchiano in the Maremma area of Tuscany. The leaders 
will rest for a further 24 hours before returning to Rome on 
Tuesday [5 April]. 
  On Wednesday, there will be a fresh round of meetings in 
order to form a government -- a task which has proved to be more 
difficult than at first thought. Bossi has said that he does 
not want Berlusconi to be the prime minister and once again he 
has stressed his federalist demands. He is also threatening to 
boycott the government, and to this end he has set up a number 
of meetings with the electoral losers. Fini has warned Bossi 
not to make too many demands; Berlusconi is keeping quiet but 
the Forza Italia clubs have asked for Bossi's loyalty. The 
strategies at the center of the Freedom Alliance seem to be 
diverging. Giuseppe Mazzei reports: 
  [Mazzei] Victory was easy, but government is more difficult 
for the center-right coalition. It now emerges that the losers 
have also rejoined the game. Who would have thought it? 
  The Alliance enjoys a big majority in the Chamber of 
Deputies 
and has practically put a working majority together in the 
Senate; everything seemed clear. Five years of stable 
government under the leadership of the victor, Silvio 
Berlusconi. However, Bossi has taken it upon himself to wreck 
the party; he has taken center stage away from Berlusconi, 
claimed it for himself, and is seeking to keep Fini out of the 
game altogether. He is scared that his influence will wane in 
any long-term government, and so he is brandishing his sword: 
federalism now, coupled with constitutional changes, and in one 
year's time, according to Gianfranco Miglio's reckoning, Italy 
will be transformed into another country. 
  On this point nobody can attack Bossi, and so he plays his 
trump card; in order to win he is prepared to ally himself with 
the devil. He wants to hold talks with Mario Segni and even with 
the left. For Occhetto and his friends, who are still in shock 
at the election defeat, Umberto the Terrible could offer an 
escape route. He will tell them that, if they do not want five 
years of unassailable center-right government, they should form 
an alliance for federalism with him. A constituent government 
would be formed, and a fresh election would be called within a 
year. 
  For the losers this will be a temptation hard to resist. The 
chess match has still to get under way.

  [Text] "The meeting was positive. We will form a 
government." This was said by Forza Italia leader Silvio 
Berlusconi at the end of the much-awaited meeting between Forza 
Italia and the Northern League. He is optimistic about how long 
it will take, but said that they had not yet discussed "the 
premiership or names of ministers." However, an agreement has 
been reached to reduce the number of ministries and 
undersecretaries. 
  The Northern League's Francesco Speroni pointed out that 
"the 
debate about the Constitution is continuing. We will meet again 
after Easter. National Alliance leader Gianfranco Fini can 
relax -- we will speak to him too." Umberto Bossi's candidate 
for the premiership, Roberto Maroni, reiterated that "federalism 
remains the most important point," while the Northern League's 
Gianfranco Fini played down Bossi's absence from the meeting.

<F P=106> [Interview with National Alliance leader Gianfranco Fini by </F>
Marco Ventura in Rome; date not given: "I Will Not Accept Any 
Teasing" -- first paragraph is IL GIORNALE introduction] 
  [Text] Rome -- Well then, secretary, will the three-party 
meeting with [Forza Italia leader] Berlusconi and [Northern 
League Secretary] Bossi be held in Milan? "It would be 
ridiculous to have any geographical prejudices: It does not 
matter whether it is in Milan or in Palermo. If the principles 
are these, what poor principles they are! The meeting will be 
held however." MSI [Italian Social Movement] and National 
Alliance leader Gianfranco Fini lights a cigarette in his office 
in Via della Scrofa, under a conspicuous tricolor flag which is 
the "bone" of contention with Bossi "from the Po." He states: 
"There were three obstacles and only the first communication 
problem has been overcome. This seems to be a trivial matter, 
but it is not, given the insults made during the election 
campaign. A real accord will only be possible after having come 
to an agreement on a program, without making any bungles, 
pretenses, or reciprocal teasing." 
  [Ventura] The first obstacle is communicating. The second is 
the program. And what about the third? 
  [Fini] Choosing the ministers. If the government is born, it 
must not have any children or stepchildren; there must be 
dignity on an equal footing between the allies as sanctioned by 
the voters. 
  [Ventura] There is talk of [League lower house floor leader] 
Maroni as the deputy prime minister and also minister of 
internal affairs. 
  [Fini] Independent of the names and ministries it is a 
matter 
of finding an accord. And a program. 
  [Ventura] To what extent will you concede to Lombard 
federalism? 
  [Fini] The starting point is the accord signed by Maroni and 
[Pact for Italy leader] Segni, and torn up by Bossi: Italy is 
one and undivided. We will then see if the Northern League will 
accept compensating federalism with the presidentialist 
republic's guarantee of unity. [League ideologue] Miglio was 
against this, but we also have to reckon with parliament because 
the rewriting of the Constitution will require a two-thirds 
majority. 
  [Ventura] Miglio proposes the institution of macroregions. 
  [Fini] We agree with the elimination of the regions and the 
provinces and the creation of an intermediate body that we could 
call, department, district, macromunicipality, or microregion. 
The important thing is for the state to retain the primary 
jurisdiction over defense, foreign affairs, the Bank of Italy, 
justice, but also education and internal affairs. My son has 
the right to study the same subjects whether he lives in Belluno 
or in Trapani, and any hypothesis of a regional police force as 
there is in the United States is entirely unacceptable. 
  [Ventura] Where is the compromise then? 
  [Fini] The microregion would have legislative authority over 
matters that are strictly linked to its territory. We also 
concur on fiscal autonomy: Part of the taxes paid must remain 
in the area where the wealth was produced. There are two 
conditions: part, not all of the taxes, and that these should 
not be extra taxes but substitutive taxes. We support unity and 
solidarity: we will defend the rights of the South, not in an 
ethnic, but in a national context. 
  [Ventura] The election results are bringing up the issue of 
the rigid structure of the public bodies.... 
  [Fini] There has been a political turning point in Italy, we 
will therefore have to renew not only the government but also 
the nomenclature, because the power has been guaranteed by the 
entire management structure of the state: from banks to the RAI 
[Italian Broadcasting Corporation], to state-controlled 
enterprises...everything. 
  [Ventura] With a spoils system of the opposite sign? 
  [Fini] Anything but this. The criteria will no longer be 
party membership, but capabilities, merits, and competence. As 
far as I am concerned the current superbureaucrat can remain in 
his job even if he is a Christian Democrat or a Socialist, 
provided that he is good at it and honest. However, if he is 
only there because of his party membership, he will have to go 
home. 
  [Ventura] The same applies to those replacing him.... 
  [Fini] Of course. We are leaving a regime to free ourselves, 
not to enter into another regime. 
  [Ventura] There is a double problem in RAI: nomenclature and 
legislative reorganization.... 
  [Fini] I am not in favor of privatization but RAI, a public 
body, must be managed like a private company, with competent 
managers and balance sheets that correspond to the rules of a 
free market economy. The television fee, publicity, and 
leveling off the deficit at the end of the year at the expense 
of the taxpayer can no longer continue. 
  [Ventura] Will the "professors" move out of Via Mazzini [RAI 
headquarters]? 
  [Fini] The entire management structure must be reexamined, 
including all the news and channel directors. We must not be 
tempted to purge and to perform indiscriminate head chopping. 
The old regime chased away the unreliable people to put 
reliable idiots in their place. From now on no more DC 
[Christian Democratic], progressive, or right-wing news. It is 
the party spirit that must be canceled. 
  [Ventura] There is already somebody who his trying to 
recycle 
himself.... 
  [Fini] Jumping on the bandwagon is Italy's national sport. 
  [Ventura] Will the universities also change? 
  [Fini] Privileges must gradually be eliminated. I do not 
care whether the professor is red, white, gray, or tri-colored, 
the selection must be based on merits, and without 
preestablished competition. 
  [Ventura] The center is showing signs of breaking up. Would 
you be ready to accept moderates from the Italian Popular Party 
[PPI] like Buttiglione and Formigoni? 
  [Fini] The progressives clearly will become the opposition 
while those from the PPI run the risk of becoming minor members 
who therefore will have to choose: either one side or the other.

<F P=106> [Interview with Achille Occhetto, Democratic Party of the </F>
Left secretary, by Alberto Leiss in Rome; date not given: "Now 
What Is Needed Is a United Opposition" -- first paragraph is 
L'UNITA introduction] 
  [Excerpts] Rome -- "For me having survived the fall of our 
myth, a fall that we are not responsible for historically 
speaking, is already an achievement. The Left must get down to 
working at an ideal form of reconstruction that cannot be 
achieved in just one day. And it must do this as in unity. 
This was the profound inspiration of our turning point." 
Achille Occhetto, two days after the elections that suddenly 
made an absolute right-wing majority emerge in Italy, wants to 
further analyze and reason over what has happened. We met the 
leader after his long meeting with the party secretariat. The 
meeting was a little special, and in a way historical. In 
addition to the majority executives closest to the party 
secretary, who participated in the meeting, such as Claudio 
Petruccioli, or Fabio Mussi, as well as Massimo D'Alema, 
Giuseppe Chiarante, and Walter Veltroni, there were even 
representatives from the "old guard" such as Tortorella, 
Reichlin, Macaluso. Occhetto seems to be quite satisfied with 
the meeting. The rumors and hints that were circulating over 
these past few days as to a possible crisis in his leadership 
have been dismissed. A discussion that is destined to become 
more detailed has been launched. A meeting of the political 
coordination committee and the regional secretaries is scheduled 
for today. "Their contribution will be important," says 
Occhetto, "also because of the great differences in the election 
results in the various parts of the country. However, we then 
will have to use all our cultural resources to start searching 
for a national reality that we must get to know again, in a 
Gramsci-like way." 
  [Leiss] I feel that I cannot do without asking a question, a 
radical one: If this victory of the Right, of this kind of 
Right, is the outcome of a political phase that began in 1989, 
with the turning point at the Bolognina [party meeting where 
Occhetto launched the reorganization of the party structure], do 
you not think that a fundamental error was made? 
  [Occhetto] I am convinced that, if we had not changed 
immediately and radically, we would have lost even more, and we 
would have started losing earlier. The change enabled us to 
remain in the game, to achieve the success of the progressive 
mayors in the towns: an inheritance that remains. This enabled 
us to enter into a new phase of the republic with the strongest 
organized party appealing to the masses. And, above all, of 
having forged an alliance with various progressive and leftist 
forces. We must now maintain and develop this unity. On the 
Left, and also with all the forces of the center, that will 
place themselves in opposition to the Right. [passage omitted] 
  [Leiss] Are [Forza Italia leader] Berlusconi, [National 
Alliance leader] Fini, and [League Secretary] Bossi better than 
the CAF [Craxi-Andreotti-Forlani]? 
  [Occhetto] It is better for all of us to try to emancipate 
ourselves after the end of the great Christian Democratic 
mother. It is better to leave the comfortable shelter of 
consociations, and to fully and authentically commit ourselves 
to assuming full responsibility for the government. Our turning 
point means that we can carry out this role in all its 
legitimacy and dismiss an insidious campaign designed in every 
way to depict us as also being responsible for the old system. 
[passage omitted] 
  [Leiss] Let us come to "what must be done." You insist on 
the unity of the progressives. Today, however, Communist 
Renewal has turned down the idea of forming a single 
parliamentary group, and has advanced the proposal of a 
permanent "consultation pact." 
  [Occhetto] We have been talking about constituting a single 
parliamentary group ever since our first meetings during which 
the progressive alliance was formed. Even at that time there 
was some resistance and difficulty. I insist upon the need to 
choose any form of organization that can facilitate this unitary 
process. We can discuss things over. But we must not abandon 
our objective. Rather I will say more: We must be fully aware 
of the fact that we are operating in a new majority system. 
There are no longer any right-wing or left-wing oppositions and 
a center government. There is a right-wing government and an 
opposition that must know how to link up all its components. I 
am therefore insisting in my appeal to the Italian Popular 
Party. We must all start working together now to build an 
effective opposition and a democratic alternative to the 
government. 
  [Leiss] But what are the organizational prospects for the 
progressives and the Left? That of a single pluralistic 
political force? 
  [Occhetto] We must go ahead realistically. In the meantime 
we will try to form a single parliamentary group. If we do not 
succeed in this objective, it is already difficult to think of a 
single party as of now. Of course, this remains our fundamental 
inspiration. The idea of a great democratic force of the Left, 
and of the progressives, laymen, and Catholics, lay at the basis 
of our turning point. And we are determined to keep this door 
open. We hope that many will decide to cross this threshold, 
leaving behind them any negative residues of a divided past and 
any fears of the prevailing hegemony of the others.

<F P=106> ["f.v." report: "Squabbles, Accusations, and Resignations </F>
-- Rete Is Going Through a Storm"] 
  [Excerpt] Palermo -- Rete is in the midst of a storm. 
After the electoral defeat, polemics are raging. Carmine 
Mancuso, who was reelected senator by a narrow majority, was 
asking for the "head" of the movement's regional coordinator, 
Pippo Russo. Antonino Caponnetto resigned from his post as 
chairman of the town council, although he still remains a 
councillor. 
  In no uncertain terms, Mancuso accused Rete's coordinator 
and 
"some friends of his" of having used all means at their disposal 
to push him aside. "In the meeting of Rete's town councillors," 
Mancuso stated, "Russo said that I should be massacred 
politically; I was supposed to be a sacrificial victim, that has 
not been sacrificed." And again: "The day after my defeat, the 
Mafia would have liquidated me." These are heavy words which 
testify to the somber mood within Rete where, according to 
Mancuso, there are some "characters whom I know very well, who 
have proved they have no charisma and no personality, and who 
have boycotted me systematically." These characters "believe 
that democracy is made only of words, and are only aiming to get 
a seat, in order to wield more power. They must now step down." 
Mancuso's polemic and accusations, however, made no reference 
to [Rete Secretary] Leoluca Orlando and the Jesuit Ennio 
Pintacuda. Antonino Caponnetto handed in a long letter of 
resignation, in which he explained that "I have given matters a 
lot of thought before reaching a decision which is right and 
proper -- and is irrevocable, irrespective of any considerations 
on the outcome of the elections." Caponnetto said: "An 
irrefutable fact clearly emerges from all this: the 
determination shown by the majority of voters in excluding, from 
the new parliament, the men who are most representative of a 
commitment and a struggle which today more than ever must be 
pursued vigorously and resolutely -- men like myself, Alfredo 
Galasso, Claudio Fava, Gaspare Nuccio, Pina Grassi, and, in 
Milan, Nando Dalla Chiesa." [passage ommited]

  [Excerpt] Milan -- [passage omitted] [Calabro] Arguments 
are one thing, but what can you tell me about conflicts of 
interests? 
  [Confalonieri] Let us not exaggerate. Let us take an 
example: You progressive forces have an idealized view of the 
Kennedies, but as far as I know, the Kennedy family, which had 
vast and widespread economic interests, was never deprived of 
its property during John's presidency, nor did anyone suspect 
that the U.S. Government favored his family's business affairs. 
  [Calabro] But Berlusconi is not Kennedy. In any case, let us 
try to take our discussion beyond the level of smart rejoinders. 
Already, on the eve of the elections, when you drew attention to 
the dangers of a conflict of interests, Berlusconi replied that 
he had taken measures to relinquish his Fininvest activities. 
Two days ago he repeated: "I am prepared to sell off some 
companies." Mr. Confalonieri, what will you be selling off? 
  [Confalonieri] We are working to meet the program we 
established for ourselves prior to the elections, irrespective 
of Mr. Berlusconi's political decisions: to merge Mondadori -- 
which has been quoted for some time -- with Silvio Berlusconi 
Editore, so as to have a major company on the stock exchange. 
Also, to make limited companies out of Big TV, the television 
enterprise, the financial products, and Fininvest itself. Do 
you consider that insufficient? 
  [Calabro] These plans have been announced but never carried 
out. When will you be quoted on the stock exchange? 
  [Confalonieri] At the end of the process of restructuring 
and 
reorganization of our group, which is a very complex one. 
  [Calabro] Your critics say that hitherto you have not quoted 
anything on the stock exchange because Fininvest's accounts are 
not in order.... 
  [Confalonieri] An end must be put to the suspicions about 
our 
accounts, the electoralist polemics. I hope we will see the 
start of a period in which our accounts can be examined calmly, 
and these accounts are in order. Our firms' performance 
improved in 1993: Fininvest's operating surplus increased by 20 
percent in 1993, and its turnover increased by 11 percent to 
11.6 trillion lire. 
  [Calabro] Let us return to the sell-offs. Being quoted on 
the stock exchange does not at all mean "relinquishing" firms in 
order to avert conflicts of interest. 
  [Confalonieri] We proceed from the fact that none of the 
Fininvest enterprises can be sold off overnight, as though it 
were a packet of bread sticks. Do you expect Standa [department 
store chain], the investment funds, or a television network to 
be put on the market today and a purchaser will appear 
miraculously tomorrow with a good offer? Apart from that, to be 
quoted on the stock market is no minor decision: It means 
undergoing a lengthy and strict series of inspections by 
minority shareholders, by the market, and by CONSOB [National 
Commission for the Supervision of Companies and the Stock 
Exchange]. And these inspections will ensure that there are no 
conflicts of interest. 
  [Calabro] But it was Berlusconi himself who said two days 
ago 
he is willing to sell off a television channel. Is the prime 
ministership worth Rete 4 or Italia 1? 
  [Confalonieri] Let us talk about it without any smart 
comments. You have to consider the assets, the integration 
between the various activities, the overall context, the 
publicity and new market, and what RAI [state broadcasting 
service] does. Not to mention the very future of the entire 
sector, what with possible cabling proposals, satellites, and 
digital broadcasting. We shall see. 
  [Calabro] Pending stock exchange quotations and inspections, 
let us try to consider some imminent conflicts of interest. 
Prime Minister Berlusconi privatizes STET [Turin Telephone 
Finance Company]. But Berlusconi the businessman has an 
investment funds firm called Programma Italia, that STET would 
very much like.... 
  [Confalonieri] No, such insinuations are unacceptable. 
Otherwise, what should we say about [Prime Minister] Ciampi and 
the portable phones issued to Olivetti? It is impossible that 
Berlusconi would do anything to benefit one of his firms. If 
anything, paradoxically, the opposite is more likely. Be that 
as it may, there has been a sharp separation between Berlusconi 
and Fininvest since the start of the election campaign: He 
resigned all his positions, he no longer manages anything, he 
has no responsibilities. 
  [Calabro] Yes, but he remains the owner, the boss. And the 
issue of conflicts of interest remains unresolved. The 
Berlusconi government will have to appoint the heads of the 
banks, but Berlusconi's Fininvest is negotiating with the banks 
for new credit lines.... The Berlusconi government will have to 
discuss antimonopoly measures, but Berlusconi's Fininvest owns 
three television networks.... The Berlusconi government will 
have to renew the top management at RAI, of which Berlusconi's 
Fininvest is the leading competitor.... And so on. 
  [Confalonieri] Let us be clear about this: Fininvest is 
Fininvest, not an offshoot of Berlusconi. It is a holding 
company that has built up a role for itself in Italy and abroad 
thanks to Berlusconi's business abilities but also thanks to the 
intelligence, self-sacrifice, and initiatives of his staff and 
his managers -- the Gallianis, Dell'Utris, Foscales, 
Bernasconis, and Dorises. It is a group that deserves attention 
and cannot be regarded as the plaything of a single person. 
Just as RAI is a great enterprise, with excellent professional 
standards, that must be respected. So what if Berlusconi does 
become prime minister? Fininvest will continue its work. And 
whoever manages it -- from me, its chairman, to its managing 
director, Franco Tato -- will do so in total, responsible 
autonomy. 
  [Calabro] These are mere words, and declarations of 
principle. The anxieties about conflicts of interest still 
remain.... 
  [Confalonieri] The deeds, the specific conduct and political 
decisions of Berlusconi as a man of government, and Fininvest's 
autonomous initiatives will show that those anxieties are 
groundless. To think otherwise would be rather like returning 
to the Middle Ages when the monarch's wealth was the same as the 
wealth of his kingdom. Does this group seem Medieval to you?

  [Text] Rome, April 2 (AFP) -- An Italian lawyer lodged a 
formal complaint Saturday [2 April], alleging that comments by 
neo-fascist leader Gianfranco Fini praising former dictator 
Benito Mussolini are against Italian anti-fascist laws. 
  Giosue Calabria, a barrister in the central northern city of 
Bologna, claims the comments that Mussolini was "the greatest 
statesman of the this century" breach a 1952 law banning any 
public apology of fascism. 
  Calabria said the 1952 law could lead to prosecutions 
against 
"anyone who publicly exults the officials, the principles, the 
facts or the methods of fascism," and should therefore apply to 
Fini's comments. 
  Fini, whose National Alliance was in the three-party 
rightwing coalition which swept to a landslide victory in 
historic general elections on March 27-28, made the comments in 
an interview published Friday. 
  In the daily LA STAMPA newspaper, Fini said Mussolini was 
"the greatest statesman of this century," adding that Silvio 
Berlusconi, whose Forza Italia dominates the winning alliance, 
was no match for Il Duce. 
  "Berlusconi will have to run hard to show he is part of 
history like Mussolini," he said in the interview.

<F P=106> [Article by Aslak Bonde: "Majority Yes Opens for New Battle"] </F>
  [Text] Norway will not automatically become a member of the 
EU [European Union] even if there is a majority in favor in the 
referendum. 
  The EU battle in Norway will not be over with the 
referendum. 
If the majority say yes to the EU there will be an intense 
battle in the Storting around the final decision. 
  In Norway a referendum is only advisory. The final decision 
as to whether to adopt the government's recommendation to become 
a member of the EU lies with the Storting. According to Article 
93 of the Constitution, it requires a three-quarters majority of 
the Storting for Norway to join. 
  In the election campaign last year the Socialist Left Party 
and the Center Party made it clear that they would not vote for 
EU membership if the yes side in the referendum won by a slim 
margin. Together the two parties have 45 members in the 
Storting: more than one-quarter of the seats. 
  The problem became apparent long before last year's 
election, 
and the Conservative, Labor, and Progress Parties have as a 
result proposed various constitutional amendments that would 
make it possible to bypass the three- quarters requirement. 
  To amend the Constitution only requires two-thirds majority. 
  The problem the yes parties face is that there are more 
opponents to the EU than those in the Center Party and the 
Socialist Left Party. In addition the Christian People's Party 
had made it clear that they do not wish to "change the rules of 
the game in the middle of the game." So far this has been 
interpreted as the Christian People's Party's not wanting to 
lend support to any of the proposed amendments. 
  The Christian People's Party, the Socialist Left, and the 
Center Party have 58 Storting representatives together: two 
representatives more than they need to block a constitutional 
amendment. 
  The EU agreement this week, coupled with the assumption that 
there will be a referendum in November, has given new life to 
speculations on how the Storting in the final analysis will view 
the referendum. 
  Labor Party leader Thorbjorn Jagland has previously stated 
that there will be some in the Center and Socialist Left Parties 
who will respect a slim majority in a referendum. The belief is 
that the pressure from the public to respect the people's 
decision will become so strong that many will yield. 
  Other EU supporters in the Storting think some in the 
Christian People's Party will decide, at the decisive moment, to 
vote for a constitutional amendment, thus leaving it up to the 
cabinet, not the Storting, to make the final decision about EU 
membership. 
  It will be a while before the issues are fully thrashed out. 
For tactical reasons the parties will want to wait as long as 
possible before taking a stand. Additionally, there may be 
instances where individual representatives break with their own 
parliamentary groups.

<F P=106> [Article by Harald Stanghelle] </F>
  [Text] The voters are stable: Several weeks of intense 
attention to the EU [European Union] talks have not affected 
Opinion's party preference poll for March. 
  The poll was conducted by telephone with 1,002 persons from 
Monday [21 March] to Wednesday, that is, in the middle of the 
hectic final talks in Brussels. To the question of which party 
they would vote for if the Storting election were now, 72.7 
percent of the interviewed gave a reply. 
  For the first time in a very long time there are no 
fluctuations beyond what the normal margin of error would allow 
for. 
  The Center Party advances by 0.9 percent, but in February 
suffered a considerable decline, so that the March progress may 
signify an adjustment upward to what the party's real level is. 
  Another thing to note is that the number of undecideds is 
increasing. The background data indicate that this is true for 
voters from all parties. The Labor Party, in spite of a decline 
of 0.8 percent, is stable at a very high level; it is clear that 
they benefit from a very high mobilization of their voters. 
  The Conservative Party's decline has stopped. The party has 
stabilized at a level very close to the election outcome of last 
September. All the attention the media has given to the 
Conservatives' search for a leader does not appear to have 
caused the party's faithful to waver. This will be a good 
foundation for the party's new leadership to build on. 
  There are two other parties it will be exciting to follow in 
the coming months: the Christian People's Party and the 
Socialist Left. The former is struggling at an alarmingly low 
level and is having problems holding on to its voters. With 
regard to the Socialist Left, we can see from the background 
data that there are clear warning signals for this party also. 
Loyalty has dropped by 20 percent, and even though the March 
poll figures are almost identical to the election results last 
September, there are indications that the Socialist Left voters 
have become less stable. 
  Time will tell whether the Socialist Left and the Christian 
People's Party will be able to do anything about their problems 
with the voters. Today's poll prompts these questions, but we 
cannot draw any firm conclusions. 

  -  Poll results 16 March: Labor 39.3, Conservatives 17.4, 
Center Party 16.8, Socialist Left 8.0, Christian People's 6.1, 
Progress 5.6, Liberals 3.1, Red Electoral 1.0, Others 2.7.

<F P=106> [Editorial: "EEA Argument"] </F>
  [Text] What position should Norway take in regard to the EU 
[European Union] if the outcome of the upcoming referendum is a 
rejection of EU membership? The two parties opposed to the EU, 
the Christian People's Party and the Center Party, have become 
embroiled in a discussion of this matter. The positions taken 
confirm our impression that the leadership in both parties is 
lacking in political realism. The one who most clearly 
demonstrates this is, surprisingly, former Foreign Minister 
Kjell Magne Bondevik. 
  It does not at all come as a surprise when Center Party 
leader Anne Enger Lahnstein thinks we should cancel the EEA 
[European Economic Area] agreement, even in a situation where 
Sweden and Finland become members of the EU, and Norway remains 
outside. Bondevik, the Christian People's Party leader, for his 
part strongly warns against abolishing the EEA agreement in the 
case of Norway remaining outside the EU. 
  Given the current conditions, it does not look as if a 
majority in the Storting can be obtained to support the Center 
Party's stance on the EEA issue. It is, however, quite 
unrealistic and nearly dishonest when the leader of the 
Christian People's Party tries to make the voters believe that 
if the referendum goes against EU membership we can just fall 
back on the EEA. 
  Bondevik, too, should admit that we will have a very 
difficult and unclear situation in our relationship to the EU if 
only Norway remains outside the EU together with Iceland. In 
that situation, Norway would have neither the power nor the 
authority to determine the further fate of the EEA. Should 
Norway say no to the EU, the chances of effecting a continuation 
of the EEA in its present form in the ensuing negotiations would 
be very small.

  [Text] Foreign Minister Alekos Mikhailidhis said the 
government understands U.S. coordinator Robert Lamb's latest 
efforts for an agreement on the confidence-building measures 
[CBM's] but it considers the results preordained because of the 
clearly negative position of the Turkish side. 
  Commenting on Lamb's statement that the process is 
continuing, Mr. Mikhailidhis also noted that he does not share 
the conclusions that portray the Americans as ignoring UN 
appraisals on the failure of the process. He added: The 
Americans know very well what is actually happening. The 
government is waiting for the UN secretary general's report 
while it completes plans for actions it will take after the 
report is submitted.

<F P=106> [Editorial: "Butrus-Ghali's Report"] </F>
  [Text] The UN secretary general's latest report on the 
Cyprus issue is expected to be submitted to the Security Council 
in the next few days. Press reports on Butrus-Ghali's report 
are contradictory. Some say that the UN secretary general will 
criticize the Turkish side about the deadlock and some say he 
will not. The Cypriot Government believes that Butrus-Ghali 
will condemn the Turkish side for its stance and it seems that 
is has received some assurances about it. Nothing is certain, 
however, because it is well known that 
behind-the-scenes-intervention--particularly by the 
Anglo-Americans--which is common in such cases, could overturn 
everything! The possibility that the same factors will 
intervene in this case and the report will be modified is not 
ruled out. 
  Rumors are already circulating that there is a difference of 
views between the United Nations and the U.S. diplomats, 
particularly Robert Lamb, the U.S. State Department's special 
coordinator on the Cyprus issue, who refuses to admit that the 
Cyprus issue has reached a deadlock. At the same time, Lamb 
claims that "significant progress" has been achieved in the 
proximity talks. Of course it is well known that the U.S. 
official is not telling the truth, but due to his position and 
his mission he can influence things, and his intervention could 
cause the UN secretary general's report to be extensively 
modified. 
  It is worth noting that the Cypriot officials are not at all 
satisfied with Lamb's whole position and behavior. This man 
does not give a clear and objective picture of the facts, hides 
the truth, and tries to cover up the Turkish intransigence and 
provocativeness. In any case, for obvious reasons the Cypriot 
Government cannot come into an open confrontation with Lamb, who 
is attempting to present Turkey's stance as heroic in order to 
mask Turkish intransigence. 
  The U.S. coordinator went to Ankara yesterday for a new 
round 
of talks on the Cyprus issue. Without doubt, when he leaves 
Ankara Lamb will say that the Turkish Government gave new 
assurances that it will cooperate with the United Nations to 
implement the confidence-building measures! 
  We do not believe that with the policy they are following 
the 
Americans contribute effectively to promoting a Cyprus solution. 
On the contrary, their stance confuses things. This is because 
if the Turks know that the United States, the only country that 
can seriously affect them regarding Cyprus, not only is not 
pressuring them but on the contrary is covering up their 
intransigent and provocative stance, then why should they agree 
to make any concessions? We believe that it must be pointed out 
to the Americans that they must look at the Cyprus issue from a 
different angle and at a higher level than Robert Lamb! And the 
Cypriot people expect U.S. President Bill Clinton--who rules the 
planet--to act on his promises. We must also make our own 
decisions. Unfortunately, we are confined to words, statements, 
and declarations. This is the bitter truth.... [as published]

  [Text] The National Guard has adopted additional security 
measures along the confrontation line because of the continuing 
state of alert by the Turkish occupation troops and the 
pseudostate's forces. The National Guard has also made 
representations to the United Nations. 
  The aim of the Turks is to create a climate of tension 
following the deadlock in the proximity talks because of Rauf 
Denktas' intransigence. According to CyBC [Cyprus Broadcasting 
Corporation] information from military sources, the Turks have 
taken special measures of readiness in the Nicosia area and at 
points that they consider of vital importance, such as arms and 
ammunition warehouses and radar installations. The military 
personnel at guardposts along the confrontation line have been 
doubled. Senior officers of the occupation army carry out 
continuous patrols along the entire length of the Attila 
[Turkish troops] line. 
  Within the framework of measures adopted by the National 
Guard, strict orders have been given to the national guardsmen 
along the confrontation line to be particularly careful.

  [Text] The Greek Cypriot National Guard has taken 
additional measures along the confrontation line. President 
Rauf Denktas described this provocative act by the Greek Cypriot 
Administration as an effort to create suspicion against the 
Turkish Cypriots and fear against Turkey, and then to build on 
that. The president charged that the Greek Cypriots never 
wanted the confidence-building measures [CBM's] in the first 
place, but try to blame the Turkish Cypriots and claim it is the 
Turkish Cypriots who do not want them. He said: Unless the 
Greek Cypriots remember that they started the Cyprus problem in 
the first place, and that the only thing they think of is to 
usurp the rights of the Turkish Cypriots, they will not find the 
right path. 
  The Greek Cypriot radio reported this morning that the Greek 
Cypriot National Guard took additional measures along the 
confrontation line. The Greek Cypriot Administration is waging 
a campaign to blame the Turkish Cypriots for the lack of 
progress in the talks on the implementation of the CBM's. This 
latest decision is another dangerous link in that campaign. The 
Greek Cypriot radio said that the Greek Cypriot National 
Guardsmen were instructed to be very careful. As a pretext for 
this provocative act, the Greek Cypriot Administration alleged 
that the Turkish Cypriots took additional measures along the 
border.

<F P=106> [Report by Sotiris Mikhail] </F>
  [Text] Within the framework of a budget submitted to the 
House of Representatives and the new Greek-Cypriot defense 
doctrine, the government is ready to purchase new, modern arms 
systems, including heavy battle tanks. 
  The purchase of heavy weapons, which will cost several 
million pounds, falls within the framework of increasing the 
country's defense capabilities to bring them in line with Greek 
capabilities. 
  According to exclusive information, the purchases may be 
made 
directly and from new sources because many countries are now 
willing to sell heavy weaponry. 
  The Cypriot Government has already sounded out several 
countries that are willing to sell Cyprus the most modern arms 
at very competitive prices. 
  A senior official said that there is great competition today 
in the arms industry sector and many countries are trying to 
sell their arms systems. 
  We have been informed that Cyprus began discussing the 
possibility of purchasing arms systems from France, Italy, 
Spain, South Africa, Singapore, and the former socialist 
countries. It appears that Russia has been contacted about the 
purchase of a specific modern arms systems by the method of 
counterbalance trade. That is, Russia is willing to sell arms in 
exchange for products it needs, such as citrus fruit and grapes. 
  The same officials added that the prospects are very good 
and 
it is hoped that the two countries will reach an agreement. 
<H5>  The Procedure </H5>
  The House of Representatives Defense Committee yesterday 
discussed the new procedure for purchasing arms systems that has 
been prepared by the Defense Ministry. The defense and finance 
ministers attended the meeting. The new procedure provides for 
the establishment of a Senior Design and Programming Council, 
which will make suggestions about the needs of the National 
Guard at a ministerial committee. 
  The Finance Ministry will become directly involved because 
it 
will be handling the payments for the arms. For the first time 
it was asked that the National Council's consent not be 
necessary for the purchases. An advisory committee will be 
established for all issues.

  [Text] The Cypriot Embassy in Sofia is trying hard to 
obtain the release of a ship under the Cypriot flag that is 
being detained in Bulgaria. 
  The ship Adventstar, of Greek ownership, has been detained 
in 
Burgas for the past 14 months because Bulgarian authorities 
suspected it of transporting merchandise to Serbia in violation 
of the embargo. 
  The company that owns the ship demanded that the cargo, 
which 
is valued at approximately $3 million, not be unloaded. The 
Bulgarian Supreme Court then issued a warrant preventing the 
ship from being unloaded. However, the issue was later 
discussed in the Regional Court, which ordered the unloading of 
the cargo. There are concerns that implementation of this 
decision would endanger the ship's cargo. 
  Efforts are being made on many levels to avoid such a step 
and to obtain a permit allowing the ship to sail. According to 
regulations, when a ship is detained because of suspicions that 
it is violating the embargo against Serbia, it should be 
released when nothing is proven within a reasonable amount of 
time.

  [Excerpts] Matthew Nimetz, President Clinton's special 
envoy on the Skopje [The Former Yugoslav Republic of 
Macedonia--FYROM] issue, has left Athens for the United States. 
According to a statement by the U.S. Information Service, Mr. 
Nimetz has drawn the conclusion that both sides desire a 
relationship based on cooperation and mutual respect for each 
other's independence and territorial integrity, and they also 
admit the dangers to stability in the region if the dispute 
continues. However, the statement points out that the 
differences between the sides are complicated and not easy to 
overcome. The statement further stresses: Mr. Nimetz will 
submit a report to Washington, present his views to UN mediator 
Cyrus Vance, and continue his efforts to support the 
negotiations within the UN framework. Mr. Nimetz will return to 
the region when this is deemed appropriate. [passage omitted] 
  Prime Minister Andreas Papandreou expressed the hope that 
there is progress on the Skopje issue before his visit to the 
United States. He noted this in response to a correspondent's 
question while he was going to the meeting of the PASOK 
[Panhellenic Socialist Movement] Central Organizing Committee. 
Mr. Papandreou described the initiative by President Clinton's 
special envoy Matthew Nimetz as positive but pointed out that 
[FYROM President] Kiro Gligorov remains intransigent and 
pressure should be exerted in this direction. 
  Government spokesman Evangelos Venizelos described the U.S. 
side's initiative toward resolving the Skopje issue as 
successful and serious.

  [Text] Andreas Papandreou, prime minister and PASOK 
[Panhellenic Socialist Movement] chairman, sent a message to our 
European Union [EU] partners that the Skopje [The Former 
Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia--FYROM] issue cannot be weighed 
on the scales of quid pro quos or negotiations. Mr. Papandreou 
conveyed the message in his opening address at the PASOK Central 
Committee meeting for the organization of the party congress, at 
which he also presented the party's new outlook. Referring to 
the Skopje issue, the prime minister said: 
  [Begin Papandreou recording] Greece has made it clear in 
every way that it is obliged to defend its national interests 
and national security with all its strength. We hope that our 
partners in the EU will fully understand this. Until now, there 
are no such indications. There are issues that cannot be 
weighed by the scales of quid pro quos or negotiations. I 
believe that with our actions we now express the feelings of the 
entire people and the national sensitiveness of all Greek 
people, of all of Hellenism. 
  The same also goes for the unified defense area on our 
eastern borders. We are seeing the dramatic return of extreme 
right-wing forces in Italy who are exploiting a long political 
crisis. Moreover, we are seeing the rise of Islamists in 
neighboring Turkey, particularly in Istanbul, which is a sign of 
further concern for our already disturbed region. 
  In this atmosphere, the change that took place in our 
country 
on 10 October [1993--PASOK's election victory] is not merely an 
oasis in a dark landscape, it is a significant and I would say 
historic development in the region and, of course, a big moment 
for Greece. [end recording]

  [Text] Prime Minister Andreas Papandreou has strongly 
attacked Greece's EU [European Union] partners and the Vatican. 
Departing briefly from a prepared speech yesterday, he accused 
them of having triggered a crisis in the Balkans, of which the 
Skopje [The Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia--FYROM] issue 
was only an extension. 
  Addressing the organising committee for a PASOK [Panhellenic 
Socialist Movement] party congress later this month, Mr 
Papandreou said: "We want to remind everyone that the drama of 
Yugoslavia is the creation of the European Union, particularly 
Germany and the Vatican...Europe should recognise that Greece is 
its furthest eastern point, to understand our pending national 
issues and especially our role in the Balkan region, whose 
crisis has sorely tried efforts to forge a common EU foreign 
policy. We Greeks know this better than anyone else." 
  On Skopje, Mr Papandreou stressed: "We hope the EU would 
understand that we are forced to defend our national interests 
the best way we can." 
  The premier's remarks coincided with U.S. envoy Matthew 
Nimetz' return to Washington. The Greek and Skopje foreign 
ministers will meet separately with UN mediator Cyrus Vance in 
New York on April 11.

  [Text] Government spokesman Evangelos Venizelos described 
as unfortunate, unsubstantiated, and a very bad example of 
journalism yesterday's THE WASHINGTON POST report in which, 
among other things, journalist (Dean Falkland) referred to an 
excessive massing of Greek troops on the border with Skopje [The 
Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia--FYROM]. 
  Mr. Venizelos stressed that he was struck by the lack of 
historical basis in the text and how far away it was from the 
actual facts. It is obvious to everyone who has an elementary 
knowledge of the area and its history, Mr. Venizelos noted, that 
Greece is the basic guarantor of security, stability, and 
normalcy in the southern Balkans. It is well known, the 
government spokesman added, that Greece is the most friendly 
state toward Skopje; this is proven by our proposals submitted 
to Cyrus Vance on finding a solution to the problem.

<F P=106> ["Text" of interview with Romanian President Ion Iliescu by </F>
Marianna Polikhroniadhou; place and date not given] 
  [Excerpts] [Polikhroniadhou] Who is responsible for the 
crisis in the former Yugoslavia and how do you believe this 
crisis can be resolved? 
  [Iliescu] It is true that during the past two years foreign 
factors encouraged the elements of dispute in the region instead 
of promoting dialogue toward achieving a peaceful settlement. 
  We believe, and so does Greece, that the solution to the 
crisis cannot be achieved by force. This is interpreted to mean 
that neither the path of military intervention nor embargoes are 
acceptable solutions; instead of settling things they complicate 
the situation even more and can only lead to a deteriorated 
situation. 
  So, the only way to a settlement is by promoting political 
solutions between the negotiating parties that are involved in 
the crisis. After all, one should not forget that these 
communities have coexisted for decades; they withstood German 
pressure and, in certain cases, jointly resisted the Germans. 
[passage omitted] 
  We welcome efforts such as those exerted recently by the 
United States and the European Union [EU] to persuade the 
conflicting sides to find a path to a dialogue that can lead to 
a political solution. 
  [Polikhroniadhou] Does the dispatch of Turkish Blue Helmets 
contribute toward the peaceful settlement you have mentioned? 
  [Iliescu] No, because the dispatch of troops violates the 
principle of nonparticipation of bordering states. The official 
position not only of Romania and Greece but also of the United 
Nations is that bordering states should not be used. Such a 
dispatch would be harmful primarily now when some steps are 
being made toward a dialogue and relaxation of the crisis. 
However, we see that the United Nations "has frozen" this 
dispatch and we hope that this will be its final decision. 
  [Polikhroniadhou] During the current critical times that the 
Balkans are passing through, some quarters talk about the 
promotion of Muslim arrows and circles that aim at striking 
against Orthodoxy. Do you agree with such conjectures? 
  [Iliescu] No, all this merely intensifies nationalistic 
stress. I do not believe it is a question of Orthodox, 
Catholic, or Muslim states. Why is Poland, which is a Catholic 
country, facing huge problems? Why is the same also happening 
in Hungary? The whole of Europe is now facing a lot of problems 
with the increasing economic crisis, unemployment, and 
inflation. So, let some quarters not hurry to oversimplify 
their judgments. [passage omitted] 
  [Polikhroniadhou] On your country's accession to the EU, 
what are the prospects and what do you expect from the EU's 
Greek presidency? 
  [Iliescu] My country recently managed to overcome the 
prejudices that many Western countries had about it by signing 
the Partnership for Peace agreement with NATO, which took place 
last year, and the recent Romanian-IMF agreements. Today, many 
foreign analysts agree that Romania will play an extremely 
interesting role in the region. This is because Romania has 
natural resources, which under government guidance can be 
utilized exceptionally; its geographic position also allows 
Romania to play the role of a link between Europe and the Middle 
East. 
  Concerning our accession to the EU, we are on a good path 
because promising conditions have been created for Romania's 
integration into Europe and the development of its relations 
with all European Community [as published] countries. 
  We express our satisfaction for the support of Greece, which 
is now holding the presidency, and believe there will be 
positive developments. 
  [Polikhroniadhou] With regard to the Skopje [The Former 
Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia--FYROM] issue, what is your view? 
  [Iliescu] We consider your country's position as reasonable. 
Your country does not have any claims against this republic and 
respects the will of this newly established state to exist as a 
sovereign entity. 
  We also consider as positive your country's stance on 
assisting this state's economic development so that it will 
become viable. So, as long as Greece has crystal-clear positions 
and good intentions toward this state, the latter should also 
have equally clear positions and not express some tendencies 
against the status of the existing borders. Relations of mutual 
trust that safeguard the existence of good-neighborliness should 
be achieved through dialogue. 
  [Polikhroniadhou] Some quarters claim that some powers, by 
strengthening [FYROM President Kiro] Gligorov's intransigence, 
aim at destabilizing the region. 
  [Iliescu] I do not believe there are such interests. I do 
not understand what the prolonged preservation of a conflict in 
this region would serve. It could have only negative results 
for everyone. On the contrary, I believe the interests of both 
the United States and the European countries should be directed 
toward resolving this dispute, something that would lead to 
stability in the region.

  [Text] Threats by Islamists against the Istanbul 
Patriarchate have caused a chain reaction. The government has 
talked about an attempt to create artificial tension and the 
official opposition leader today called for lodging a demarche 
with Turkey. Our correspondent Roula Kambouryianni has the 
following report: 
  [Begin recording] [Kambouryianni] Official opposition leader 
Miltiadhis Evert today said: Any new aggressive action against 
the patriarchate must be considered by Greece as casus belli, 
that is a cause for war. Mr. Evert called upon the government 
to lodge a demarche and seek action by the World Council of 
Churches. 
  [Evert] On the verge of the 21st century, it is not possible 
that similar actions are taking place in any part of the world, 
no matter how backward it may be. 
  [Kambouryianni] Commenting on Evert's statement, government 
spokesman Evangelos Venizelos pointed out that the patriarchate 
knows very well how to conduct intrachurch relations. He added 
that the Greek Government's absolute support for the 
patriarchate is a given fact. Mr. Venizelos further noted that 
the initiative by Archbishop Iakovos [of North and South 
America] to brief U.S. President Clinton on the issue falls 
within the same framework. The government spokesman then 
recalled the historic presence and international status of the 
patriarchate and stressed that many circles in Turkey are trying 
to cultivate a climate of artificial tension between the two 
countries. 
  Commenting on the Islamic provocations against the 
patriarchate, Public Order Minister Stilianos Papathemelis 
emphasized today that a firm answer is needed from our side. 
The Ecumenical Patriarchate and Patriarch Vartholomeos have 
become the target of the Islamist municipal authorities. 
Islamist Mayor of Istanbul [name indistinct] said: I will pass 
through the "gate of hatred." He meant the patriarchate gate 
that has been closed since 1821 when [Patriarch] Grigorios V was 
hanged there. The Istanbul mayor added that he will not allow 
the revival of the Byzantine state that the patriarch allegedly 
seeks. [end recording]

<F P=106> ["Exclusive" interview with Hasan Dag, head of the National </F>
Liberation Front of Kurdistan, ERNK, by Dina Vayena in Athens; 
date not given] 
  [Excerpts] "Last year's campaign against Turkish tourism 
was only a warning. The true campaign will begin this year and 
will take on the characteristics of war." 
  Hasan Dag ("Dag" means mountain), head of the National 
Liberation Front of Kurdistan (ERNK) office in Athens, speaks 
with the same calm, reserved, but determined tone that he adopts 
every time he talks to press representatives. [passage omitted] 
  Our discussion came after the bomb explosion in the yard at 
St. Sophia a few days ago that injured three foreign tourists 
and for which the PKK [Workers Party of Kurdistan] claimed 
responsibility. We also discussed future developments in the 
Kurdish movement for independence within the political scene 
being formulated in Turkey after the recent communal elections. 
  "Why St. Sophia, a major symbol of Orthodoxy?" I asked him, 
and his expression was not apologetic in the least when he 
turned around and said: "It is our party's decision to strike at 
tourist targets in Turkey. We will strike one by one at all the 
tourist targets, including St. Sophia and the area around it 
which is also a tourist target inside the Turkish state. Our 
action had no other sort of meaning." 
  There were human victims in earlier PKK operations as well 
as 
in this one. Hasan Dag says that "the attacks against Turkish 
tourism are part of our war operations and it is natural that 
there are human victims. We regard the whole of Turkey as a war 
zone and for this reason there cannot be tourists in a country 
where war is being waged. There is war going on in Bosnia, 
Nagorno-Karabakh, and South Africa, and there are no tourists in 
these area. So, why should tourists visit Turkey?" 
  The warning also concerns the Greeks: "In a belligerent area 
we cannot distinguish the targets. What we are interested in is 
that no tourist exchange enters Turkey. Consequently, the 
Greeks must not visit Turkey. The Greek tourist agencies must 
not organize tours there and the Greek ship owners must not 
organize cruises to the Turkish coasts but rather to the Greek 
islands." [passage omitted] 
  The strict order from the Kurdish Democratic Party and the 
outlawed PKK to the Kurdish population was general abstention or 
casting invalid votes in the Turkish communal elections. The 
PKK particularly stressed this order by executing some local 
candidates of big Turkish parties who were of Kurdish origin. 
[passage omitted] 
  --Were the PKK's execution of Kurdish candidates not cruel 
actions? [Vayena question as published] 
  "When we boycott the election, those candidates cannot 
fulfill the desires of the Kurdish people. They were traitors. 
They were the men of the Turkish state and mercenaries. Do not 
forget that the Turkish Army has not stopped its attacks against 
our villages even for a single day." [passage omitted] 
  Hasan Dag also talks about the reinforcement of the Turkish 
military forces in Kurdistan, whom he estimates to total 400,000 
well-armed men. He also notes the firm tactical armed 
resistance by the Kurdish guerrillas: "At this time we have 
30,000 men and women fighters and there is provision for more 
than 50,000 by the end of 1994. On the Kurdish mountains we 
maintain 70 military training camps. In the next few months we 
will transfer the war to the big Turkish cities, to Istanbul, 
Ankara, Izmir, and we will be all the more dynamic. We will 
strike fatal blows at the Turkish economy, which is already 
facing a crisis." 
  Hasan Dag admits that this is a war with unequal forces both 
in terms of men and weapons. However, as he put it, "we have a 
different approach. Our strongest weapon is our people's will. 
When we began the armed struggle in 1984 with 300 men in all, 
the Turkish generals boasted that they would annihilate us in 72 
hours. 
  ``Today, 10 years later, we continue the war and we have 
gained our people's respect.'' [passage omitted]

  [Text] You must certainly remember that, as soon as it came 
to power, the New Democracy (ND) government set up a bipartisan 
commission on terrorism, which, however, never functioned. Now, 
Public Order Minister Stelios Papathemelis has chosen immediate 
contacts with political parties by directly informing their 
representatives on this thorny issue. He has thus decided that 
party representatives will be asked to come at regular intervals 
to the offices of the National Intelligence Service (EIP), where 
data resulting from the investigation of terrorist incidents 
will be submitted to them. However, the question is--especially 
if these contacts become permanent--whether party 
representatives will have access to the secret files that the 
General Security keeps (or at least should keep) on terrorism. 
The solution that was found is indeed worthy of Solomon: "There 
is no problem," Papathemelis answered when the question was 
asked: "The party representatives will not understand anything 
from reading these files." Now, of course, you will ask in turn: 
Is there anything from the investigation of terrorist incidents 
that remains secret if one takes into account the fact that the 
antiterrorism services once were considered a sieve? 
  And speaking of terrorism, I will reveal to you that 
Papathemelis will soon announce that a cooperation agreement on 
terrorism has been signed between Greece and Germany. Which 
means that the EIP offices will be visited, not only by CIA 
agents, but by officials of the German security services 
cooperating with the antiterrorism services in developing 
"leads" and exchanging information.

  [Text] Istanbul, April 1 (AFP) -- The leader of Turkey's 
Islamic-based Prosperity Party Friday [1 April] said his party 
aimed to set up a "world union of Islam" after taking power in 
Turkey. 
  Necmettin Erbakan, addressing some 10,000 supporters after 
Friday prayers at the Eyup Sultan mosque, did not spell out what 
he meant by a "world union of Islam," but he praised Eyup, an 
Arab soldier who fell during a siege of the town in 668, saying 
he was a "great example of Islamic jihad (holy war)." 
  Erbakan, whose party won municipal elections here, in Ankara 
and in some 25 other towns last weekend, joined in prayers with 
new Istanbul mayor Tayyip Erdogan and 17 other local district 
mayors before they took up their posts. 
  "We have taken power at the local, geographical and 
demographic levels in two-thirds of Turkey and now we are 
marching to take central power in the near future," the leader, 
perched on a bus, told his supporters. 
  In the municipal elections, the Prosperity Party "soared 
into 
the sky like a missile," while centre parties "which copy the 
West plummeted from the sky," he said. 
  Meanwhile, the Turkish pound was again under pressure here 
Friday as the country awaited the know whether Prime Minister 
Tansu Ciller's mainstream secular True Path Party, which 
obtained the most votes of any single party in the election, 
with around 22 percent of the vote, would continue to govern. 
  It could continue in a coalition with the centre-left Social 
Democratic Populist Party or ditch it in favour of an alliance 
with the opposition Motherland Party. 
  On the local free currency markets, the Turkish pound was 
trading at 27,500 to the dollar, down from 25,500 on Thursday. 
  The Turkish currency has lost 60 percent of its value 
against 
the dollar since the beginning of the year. 
  In Athens Friday, Greek Prime Minister Andreas Papandreou 
expressed concern at the Islamic success in the Turkish ballots, 
"particularly" in Istanbul. 
  He told a meeting of his ruling PASOK [Panhellenic Socialist 
Movement] party that the Turkish election results were "a 
worrying sign, especially in this already troubled region."

  [Text] Interior Minister Nahit Mentese has announced that 
anybody who shows disrespect to Ataturk or deviates from 
Ataturk's principles and innovations will be subject to legal 
procedures without fail. Mentese stated that nobody should give 
the impression that winning certain mayoral posts in the local 
elections will bring a new order; that a new order is in office; 
or that the applications, institutions, or regulations of 
democracy will change. Mentese's statement to the Turkish Radio 
and Television regarding the issue is as follows: 
  [Begin Mentese recording] Local administration elections 
were held under the supervision and inspection of legislative 
bodies according to Article 79 of the Constitution. The 
elections were held in peace and security. Participation was 
high. The elections were observed by the foreign and local 
press, the media, and the world. Our judges and prosecutors are 
assessing the allegations of fraud. 
  Those who won the elections should not overreact and those 
that lost the elections should respect the results. Nobody 
should give the impression that by winning certain mayoral posts 
in the local elections they will bring a new order, a new order 
will come to office, or that democracy's applications, 
institutions, or regulations will change. Those who won the 
mayoral posts in certain areas have only the right to serve and 
take care of regional and local needs as stipulated by law. 
The winning of the mayoral elections in certain areas does not 
give them the right to have their say, to rule, or to govern 
provinces, districts, or for that reason the country. 
  In order to govern the country it is necessary to gain 
control of the legislative authority, the right to make laws, 
and also to capture the power named the executive power. In 
order to govern the country, it is necessary to be a government. 
It is out of the question that this power and authority can be 
acquired by winning certain mayoral posts and local council 
memberships. 
  Furthermore, according to the Constitution, local 
administrations are under the jurisdiction and control of the 
general administration. They are obliged to operate according 
to the existing laws and cannot overstep their authorities, 
transgress the laws, or conduct arbitrary procedures. 
  All of us in this country will live according to the 
principles of Ataturk, the Constitution, and democracy with its 
institutions and regulations. Our citizens should respect each 
other whatever their way of life or views and should approach 
each other with love. Nobody should think that he can impose 
his political tendencies, believes, or ways of life upon others 
and nobody should behave in that direction. 
  Anybody who opposes the laws, trespasses his authority in 
the 
line of duty, or deviates from great Ataturk's path by 
dissociating from his principles and innovations, will be sent 
to the concerned independent judicial authorities for the 
implementation of necessary legal procedures and punishment.

<F P=106> [Statements to the press by Prime Minister Tansu Ciller, </F>
True Path Party leader, and by Deputy Prime Minister Murat 
Karayalcin, Social Democratic Populist Party leader, at the 
residence of the prime minister in Ankara on 3 April -- recorded] 
  [Text] [Ciller] As you all know, elections were held a 
week ago. They were local elections, not general elections. 
However, as we, the coalition partners, have stated before, 
they were peaceful elections where everyone was able to express 
his free will everywhere. We are very pleased about that. 
Contrary to expectations, the elections were held in a peaceful 
atmosphere in the west, the east, the north, and the south. 
  The largest party of the Right and the largest party of the 
Left emerged as just that from these elections. The two parties 
have assessed the results and decided on what to do in the 
future. We said that the True Path Party [TPP], the major 
partner of the coalition, would not disband the coalition. 
Meanwhile, the Social Democratic Populist Party [SDPP] has 
authorized Mr. Karayalcin to decide on the future of the 
coalition. The appropriate bodies of the TPP authorized me 
today in the same way. With this authority vested in us, Mr. 
Karayalcin and I have decided to continue with the coalition. 
We will convene the Council of Ministers this evening. 
  The country is faced with very important problems. We will 
tackle these problems together. We will tackle them with 
confidence and support. We take the responsibility to solve all 
the problems facing the country. Whatever these problems are, 
the country has a government, a government whose two partners 
support each other. This government will continue on its path 
with confidence. This is an extremely important development for 
the stability of the country. Now is the time to find solutions 
to the problems before us. It is not a time to wait. With this 
understanding, the Council of Ministers will discuss the most 
urgent problems this evening. We will tackle all the issues 
together. These issues will be reviewed in accordance with the 
needs of the country. 
  Meanwhile, let me say one thing: Naturally, local 
administrations are local administrations. Local 
administrations carry out municipal duties such as building 
roads, running buses, collecting garbage and so on. Other than 
that, we are the guarantee that a state based on law functions 
everywhere in the same way. We are the guarantee of the secular 
Turkish Republic. We are the guarantee that principles of law 
are implemented everywhere in the same way. I ask our people to 
be confident and relaxed in this respect. 
  Meanwhile, we have received reports that certain injustices 
occurred, that there were cases of fraud, in the elections. The 
concerned authorities are looking into these reports. The 
government is not directly responsible for this, but it will 
make sure that the decisions of the concerned authorities are 
implemented. Voting concerns the honor of the state. We will 
follow this issue. 
  We take responsibility for every problem facing the country. 
We will solve them all. We all know that a coalition emerged 
from the previous elections, from the 1991 elections. This 
coalition will continue and it will solve the country's 
problems. I want and ask our people to be relaxed and confident 
about this. 
  [Karayalcin] The honorable prime minister has made the 
necessary announcement. I do not have much to add. Keeping in 
mind past implementation and assessing results, the government 
will tackle the problems facing the country with renewed elan, 
with renewed enthusiasm, and with renewed determination. We are 
certainly not averse to tackling Turkey's problems. We will 
solve them. A new era has now begun. I hope the decisions we 
will implement will bring beneficial results for our country, 
our nation, and our working people. I sincerely believe that 
this will be so.

The people, he said, gave us the message to set up a just order 
as soon as possible. 
  Addressing a mayors meeting organized by his party in 
Ankara, 
Erbakan stressed that the local elections closed one era and 
opened the era of a just order, of the national view, and of the 
PP. Turkey's showcase was handed over to us with the mayoral 
positions we won in the big cities, he said, adding: We will 
make Turkey a leading country. 
  Erbakan charged that upset by the elections results, certain 
circles carried out various acts of provocation. He stressed 
that the acts against women carried out in certain cities were 
not the doing of the PP. He added that he sent a letter to the 
Interior Ministry explaining the situation and demanding the 
culprits be captured. 
  [Begin Erbakan recording] We are coming to save Turkey. We 
are coming to bring happiness to 60 million people. Our path is 
one of tolerance, brotherhood, and love. We do not bring bans. 
We will not interfere with what people eat, drink, or wear. We 
are coming to bring happiness to 60 million people. Mayoral 
positions as well as government positions are places of service 
to the 60 million. We do not discriminate among parties or 
faiths. We consider every single member of our 60 million 
strong nation a brother. [end recording]

  Atun and a delegation of Turkish Cypriot young businessmen

that they are aiming at economic integration between Turkey and

Atun indicated that economic strengthening will give them more 
power at the negotiating table. 
  Answering reporters' questions, Atun said that the Greek

undermine the efforts toward a Cyprus solution and will create 
great political drawbacks which will harm the Cyprus issue. 
  Later, the TRNC Young Businessmen Association and the Aegean

<F P=106> [Dogan Heper Commentary: "Power Race in the Balkans"] </F>
  [Text] Turkish troops are going to the Balkans. Even if 
it is merely symbolic, our troops are returning to our former 
lands. This time they are going there for a universal mission 
within the framework of international cooperation, as a peace 
force for the security of their brothers the Ottoman Empire was 
forced to leave behind. 
  The Turks first set foot in the Balkans with an 18-month 
raid 
in 1321. The Ottoman conquest of the Balkans began when 
Suleyman Pasa crossed over to Rumelia. The United Christian 
Army tried to stop the Ottoman gains and to evict the Ottomans 
from the places they had taken. That Army was defeated by 
Turkish troops under the command of Sultan Murat I at the Kosovo 
Battle in 1389. After this Turkish victory, Serbia came under 
Ottoman rule. 
  Despite all its efforts, Europe could not stop the Ottoman 
Empire from advancing. Sultan Yildirim Beyazit badly defeated a 
crusader army in Nikopol. After Sultan Mehmet II took Istanbul, 
the Ottoman conquests in the Balkans gained speed. In the end, 
the entire region became Turkish land. 
  The Turkish advance in Europe stopped toward the end of the 
17th century. With the Karlovac Treaty in 1699, the Ottoman 
Empire started to lose territories in the Balkans. 
  Russia played the major role in these losses. 
  These days, Russia, with Yeltsin, has become a place where 
big dreams are dreamt. 
  Meanwhile, the West wants to see Moscow as a center of 
democracy following the dissolution of the Soviet Union. 
  Yeltsin is implementing every reactionary attitude from Slav 
racism to exploiting the Orthodox Church for various advantages. 
  He is destroying the Parliament with gunfire. 
  He has the capability of obtaining an approval for the 
constitution he wants with coerced referendums. 
  Yeltsin is turning towards the Balkans and the Caucasus. He 
is making use of every opportunity to have his say in the Middle 
East. 
  Turkey is the one mostly concerned with Russia's 
expansionist 
desires and the danger which emerged with the Slav-Orthodox 
alliance. 
  Turkey, which historically has suffered the most from 
Russia, 
should possess the military alliance, the political power, and 
the maneuvering capability to be able to prevent Moscow's 
expansionist moves. 
  We also have a neighbor called Greece. Greece made 
antagonism toward Turkey part of its national identity. 
  Athens is quick to support anybody who wants to harm Turkey. 
  Athens is the devil's advocate in international forums where 
Turkey is being discussed. 
  Greece is the one challenging Turkey by adding fuel to the 
fire where Cyprus is concerned and including it in its defense 
area. 
  Greece is the one exploiting Turkey's southeast issue and 
embracing terrorism against Turkey. 
  Greece is the one encouraging Serbian barbarism in the 
Balkans and undermining Ankara's peace efforts. 
  Theodhoros Pangalos, Athens' European Union term president, 
criticized Europe's good relations with Turkey and made the 
following disrespectful statements: 
  "The Turks are walking all over Europe with their 
blood-covered boots." 
  Two powers emerged in the Balkans with the help our 
neighbors 
Athens and Moscow. 
  On the one hand, Russia, Greece, and Serbia. 
  On the other, Turkey, Macedonia [The Former Yugoslav 
Republic 
of Macedonia -- FYROM], Bosnia-Herzegovina, and Albania. 
  Moscow placed its soldiers in Bosnia-Herzegovina. Turkey's 
request to send Turkish troops to Bosnia-Herzegovina was refused 
for a long time. 
  Athens, especially, has done everything in its power to 
prevent Turkish troops from entering Bosnia-Herzegovina. 
  But Athens did not have enough power. 
  Turkey, with the support it has attained, can expand its 
successful initiatives in the Balkans by furthering relations in 
Macedonian and Albania. 
  The Turkish soldier, who will arrive in Europe in the coming 
days, will have the opportunity to prove the importance of 
Turkey's presence in the Balkans as well as the significance of 
serving for peace in these lands where he has returned after all 
these years.

<F P=106> [By Mustafa Necati Ozfatura from the "Foreign Policy" </F>
column: "NATO"] 
  [Text] NATO is a military alliance against Russian and 
communist imperialism. The Soviet Union is dissolved. The 
Warsaw Pact is annulled. The West-East Cold War is over and 
communism has collapsed; but NATO, devoid of its functions, 
remains. On 18 February 1952, Turkey joined NATO, which was 
established on 4 April. Turkey trusted NATO and has come out a 
loser. Turkey, which maintained the largest number of soldiers 
to defend against the Soviet Union after the United States, 
remained underdeveloped because of the burden NATO's military 
expense placed on the country. While Turkey fulfills all its 
responsibilities toward NATO, NATO has not fulfilled most of its 
responsibilities toward Turkey. NATO member countries have not 
supported Turkey but in fact acted antagonistically toward it. 
Turkey's extremely West-oriented policy and support of NATO has 
left it isolated in the world. Turkey which pinned its hopes on 
NATO has been let down. Superpowers can never have friendships. 
They can only relate to self-interest. Turkey, which made 
extraordinary sacrifices for NATO from 1952 to 1990, was stabbed 
in the back by NATO members who supported the PKK [Workers Party 
of Kurdistan] and deployed the Poised Hammer. 
  The West betrayed Turkey which receives little aid from NATO 
but carries the Alliance's heavy load. And this is a 
characteristic of the West. The West is no different from a 
scorpion or from a snake. Countries which side with the West are 
bound to get its poison at their weak moments. The West sees 
its interest in Turkey's disaster. The U.S. and European Union 
[EU] policy toward Turkey is to destroy it mainly economically 
and morally and then to use it. In short, the Western policy 
toward Turkey can be described as "collapse it and use it." 
  The United States and the EU supplied the basic intrigue to 
begin the chain of Turkey's disasters. The West remained 
silent when the Greeks massacred Turks in Cyprus with NATO arms. 
However, when Turkey saved its brothers in Cyprus in line with 
existing agreements and international law, the West imposed an 
arms embargo on Turkey. President Lyndon Johnson gave Turkey a 
memorandum, saying: "I would like to tell you in all sincerity 
that the United States will not agree to the use of 
U.S.-supplied military equipment in any intervention Turkey 
might undertake in Cyprus." 
  Unfortunately, intellectuals and politicians raised in 
Western culture pinned their hopes on the United States and 
Europe. However, had we tried to stand on our own two feet with 
our own resources we would have found our true identity, our 
true place in the world. Following in the footsteps of the West 
(the formula of the late Ismet Inonu) has been the reason for 
our disaster. 
  According to the United States, all the world's resources 
are the common property of mankind, but the sources of the 
United States belong to the United States only. There is no 
basic difference between 1945 Yalta and 1990 Malta. The only 
difference is in the method. In Yalta, the United States and 
Russia [as published] divided the world into their areas of 
influence. They divided the world into East-West, Warsaw Pact 
and NATO, thereby preventing progress for the developing 
countries and continuing to exploit developing countries by 
selling arms to them. They deceived the world through Cold War 
scenarios. When the world realized how deceitful the scenarios 
were, Bush and Gorbachev decided in Malta to go on with the Cold 
War, but this time to disband the Soviet Union and replace it 
with Russia. The United States and Russia, who were enemies in 
the past, are now in the same ranks. The only superpower in the 
world today is the United States, and its greatest supporter is 
Russia. The West which did not allow Russia to come down to the 
Adriatic for centuries, has just placed it in Bosnia-Herzegovina 
which the West prepared. Do not be surprised if, soon, through 
U.S-Russian cooperation, Russia is placed in Turkey's straits. 
Maybe the East-West Cold War ended in Malta, but a cold war 
between the North (Christianity) and the South (Islam) was 
decided on there. 
  The new enemy of the West and of NATO is Islam which is 
hiding behind a fundamentalist mask. At the time, NATO's enemy 
was red, now it is green, in other words, the color of Islam. 
NATO's true face emerged when it remained a silent observer 
before the Serbian cruelties in Bosnia-Herzegovina. Today, NATO 
has adopted a front against the Islamic world.

  [Text] A foreign tourist was killed and 12 people, 
including foreigners, were injured when a bomb exploded at the 
Closed Bazaar in Istanbul today. 
  The bomb, which was placed next to a water pipe on Keseciler 
street in the bazaar, went off at 1050. Thirteen people, 
including Spanish, Belgian, French, and Lebanese tourists, were 
wounded. The Spanish tourist, Xavier Castro, could not be 
saved. The other 12 are being treated at various hospitals. 
  The security forces have started a search operation to catch 
the culprits whose descriptions have been obtained. 
  State Minister and Government Spokesman Yildirim Aktuna

<F P=106> [Article signed EE/BN: "The `New Forum' Replaces COCOM -- A </F>
Good Decision According to the Swiss Delegation'"] 
  [Text] Amsterdam, 31 Mar (ATS) -- The COCOM [Coordinating 
Committee on Export Controls] has been dismantled. The 
coordinating committee on the unilateral control of exports of 
high-technology weapons to the former East bloc countries will 
now be called the New Forum. Its structure has been slightly 
modified. The decision was made at the two-day conference in 
Wassenaar near The Hague. The Swiss delegation welcomes this 
arrangement. 
  Rolf Jeker, a member of the Federal Office for Foreign 
Economic Affairs (OFAEE), said that this was a reasonable 
decision as far as security policy is concerned. Some 
transparency in the export of weapons is a good thing, the Swiss 
delegation head told ATS. 
<H5>  Swiss Membership </H5>
  So far, Switzerland has cooperated with COCOM only on an 
independent basis. Following the example of Sweden, Finland, 
Ireland, and New Zealand, it became a fully fledged member of 
the New Forum, however. 
  Last November, at the first "high-level meeting" [preceding 
three words in English], COCOM's 17 member countries (Japan, 
Australia as well as all NATO countries excluding Iceland) 
acknowledged that the organization had no more reason to exist 
given the end of the Cold War. At the second meeting in the 
Netherlands, the members decided definitively to disband it. 
<H5>  Interim Period </H5>
  The disbandment of the organization will leave no 
international convention on military property and dual-purpose 
items (that also can be used for defense) during the interim 
period, until October, when the New Forum is set up. During 
this period the member states will have to reinforce the 
controls on their national exports. 
  A working group will draw up a new list of products, while 
another will set up a information exchange system. The New 
Forum will have to expand as quickly as possible. Russia could 
be present at the next meeting in October. China, Poland, 
Hungary, the Czech Republic, and Slovakia are seen as important 
possible new members.

  [Text] Nuremberg (DDP/ADN) -- In the view of Foreign 
Minister Klaus Kinkel, the practical significance of the 
minority blocking vote in the EU [European Union] Council of 
Ministers, which has until recently been strongly disputed 
because of the membership negotiations of the EFTA [European 
Free Trade Association] states, is being overestimated. In any 
case, in the EU the principle of unanimity governed complex 
matters, and the qualified majority vote was decisive for issues 
concerning the internal market, Kinkel told the DDP/ADN news 
agency in Nuremberg. 
  Moreover, the EU foreign ministers had undertaken to 
reexamine the whole procedure, which has now been decided, in 
1996. It had at any rate been right not to let the accession of 
the Scandinavian countries and Austria collapse over this 
matter, Kinkel said. 
  Kinkel rejected criticism from the CSU [Christian Social 
Union]-led Bavarian Government to the effect that German 
interests were not being represented at national and 
international level as matter of factly as other countries. In 
view of its past, Germany was being "viewed critically" as a 
reunited country, Kinkel said. However, there was "no reason to 
slink around on velvet paws." Germany had so far done well out 
of its "policy of restraint."

<F P=106> [Report by Marc Deger: "For Paris, Social Clause Not Worth a </F>
Crisis"] 
  [Text] Faced with the growing reticence of developing 
countries toward the introduction of a social clause in the 
future World Trade Organization (WTO)'s remit, Paris will not 
take the risk of provoking a North-South crisis during the GATT 
ministerial session at Marrakesh from 12 to 15 April. Gerard 
Longuet [foreign trade and industry minister], who will be 
making the journey to Morocco to sign the final Uruguay Round 
agreement on behalf of France, made this clear yesterday to the 
general meeting of the International Committee of the CNPF 
[National Council of French Employers], pointing out that what 
was essential for the French Government was first of all to 
"open the door to a debate and hold it open, so that the door 
cannot be shut on this problem." 
<H5>  U.S. Threat To Boycott Marrakesh Ministerial Declaration </H5>
  In fact, French diplomacy has been taking a position visibly 
different from Washington, which has suddenly adopted a "to the 
bitter end" attitude. Until the recent G-7 summit on employment 
in Detroit, however, the United States had been remarkably 
absent in the debate on the social clause, while France had made 
this a major issue for a long time. 
  Today the Americans are threatening to boycott the 
ministerial declaration at Marrakesh if it fails to make 
reference to "social standards" in defining the work program of 
the future WTO, which will take over from GATT in the first half 
of 1995. This week, the U.S. delegation presented an amendment 
aimed in this direction to the draft ministerial declaration, 
which provoked a categoric "no" from developing countries. 
  Developing countries who have only their low salaries as a 
comparative advantage see this desire to include a social clause 
in international trade rules as a fresh maneuver by 
industrialized countries to dominate them. Aware of the dangers 
of politicizing the debate between imperialism and a pro-third 
world stance, France explained that there was no question of 
requesting developing countries to adopt the same level of 
social protection and salaries as rich ones. 
  For Gerard Longuet, it is a matter of making people realize 
that "the globalization of the economy must be counterbalanced 
by the respect for minimum standards, such as a ban on child 
labor and forced labor." Alluding in particular to the newly 
industrialized countries, he pointed out that "countries which 
have achieved a certain level of development should have a 
certain obligation toward social convergence in the long term." 
  On Tuesday 2 April, [Prime Minister] Eduard Balladur will be 
calling together the ministers concerned by GATT to define 
France's position toward the Marrakesh meeting. "The objective 
is to come up with a proposal which can still create a link 
between trade and social issues," it was being said at the prime 
minister's office. 
  The fact remains that the Marrakech conference has been 
called in particular to cross the final "t's" on seven years of 
Uruguay Round negotiations. A ministerial declaration is not 
formally required by 15 April and could be made at a later date.

<F P=106> [Report by Marco Ansaldo: "The Greek Minister Speaks of </F>
`Fascist Danger'"] 
  [Excerpt] Rome -- Theodhoros Pangalos struck again. The 
Greek European affairs minister, notorious for his opinions 
which are often outspoken to the point of being brutal, not 
content with the violent polemic which broke out two days ago 
with Italy over some scathing remarks of his on the Right's 
electoral success, again returned to the attack. Despite the 
official note which [Foreign Minister] Beniamino Andreatta had 
immediately addressed to the minister's office, requesting him 
to maintain "a respectful and reserved attitude toward internal 
developments in Italy," yesterday Pangalos again expressed his 
"concern" at the outcome of the Italian elections and the 
possibility of "a fascist party joining the government." 
  "There is nothing wrong in the fact that a member of the 
European Union takes an interest in the matter," he explained in 
Athens, after meeting with the Spanish European Community 
affairs undersecretary. "We have the situation in Italy very 
much at heart, and it is in our interest to see a democratic 
government in Italy. All our parties have condemned fascism, and 
the involvement of a fascist party in the government worries 
us," he added. "Clearly, the instability of Italian politics 
may create problems. We hope," he went on to say, "that Italy 
will have a democratic government, guided by the European ideal" 
and capable of "making an important contribution to the Union." 
Finally, he concluded his latest statement by asserting that 
the Greek political community, which recently experienced a 
military dictatorship, "condemns fascism and neofascism." The 
Greek comments were considered inappropriate in diplomatic 
circles, considering also that the Athens government currently 
holds the European Community's presidency. 
  Pangalos, however, wished to minimize Andreatta's firm 
intervention. It was a "friendly action," he explained, 
"motivated more by his concern over internal developments than 
by concern over my statements." 
  However, according to some sources at the Farnesina [Foreign 
Ministry], Pangalos is now trying to tone down the meaning of 
the comments he made on Wednesday [27 March], and, in any case, 
"Andreatta's intervention was firm, and there is no need now for 
further clarification." Following instructions from the Italian 
foreign minister, yesterday Italian Ambassador to Greece 
Giovanni Dominedo addressed a note of censure (in diplomacy, 
this is somewhat less than an official protest) to the Greek 
Government. 
  [Radical leader] Marco Pannella also made a statement 
yesterday concerning the polemic: "Given that the Greek 
European affairs minister insists on commenting on Italian 
political problems (which, in itself, is not necessarily a bad 
thing), including arbitrary ideological judgments on this or 
that `fascist' danger or shame which could result from the new 
political situation in Italy, Athens should also bear in mind 
that the key question that must be judged, in Europe and for 
Europe, is that of the European or non-European nature of the 
policies pursued by the various countries and the Community's 
various political forces." According to Pannella, "if Italy and 
Europe were to compare the policies of the Greek Left with those 
of the Italian Right, they would not hesitate to consider the 
Italian Right as the most genuinely European and 
Community-oriented of the two." [passage omitted]

<F P=106> [Article by Harald Stanghelle] </F>
  [Text] The EU [European Union] agreement does influence the 
way the voters look at Norwegian membership in the EU, according 
to a poll Opinion has done for AFTENPOSTEN. 
  The poll was taken from Monday [14 March] to Wednesday this 
week. There are noticeable differences in the replies given 
before the agreement had been concluded (Monday and Tuesday) and 
after the EU agreement with Norway finally became a reality 
(Wednesday). 
  The poll was conducted with 1,000 interviewees, 680 of whom 
were interviewed on Monday and Tuesday. Of these 680, or 51 
percent, said no to Norwegian membership in the EU, 28 percent 
said yes, and 21 percent belong to the don't-know group. 
  The picture is quite different with the 320 who were 
interviewed on Wednesday. There continues to be an undeniable 
majority for no -- 43 percent -- but 35 percent do say yes to 
Norwegian membership in the EU. It is interesting to note that 
among the voters who were asked after the EU negotiations had 
been concluded, there still is a large group of undecideds: 22 
percent. 
  The overall numbers are quite clear, though: Following 
recent months' polls where the no side has been dropping and the 
yes side advancing, the March opinion poll shows a different 
trend. The yes side dropped by 6 percent from February (from 37 
to 31). The no side advanced by 1 percent (from 48 to 49). The 
dropouts from the yes side have joined the undecideds. In 
February 15 percent said they were not sure how they would vote 
in a referendum, in March 21 percent were not sure. 
  The background data of the March poll show increased 
uncertainty among the voters, in spite of the intense focus the 
media has put on the EU negotiations in recent weeks. The 
explanation would appear to be that the EU thriller is confusing 
to the voters. 
  A very interesting trend as the battle for the voters 
intensifies is that more and more voters are abandoning their 
surefire stands both on the no and the yes side of the issue. 
More people are choosing the options "probably no" and 
"probably yes." 
  In February 24 percent said "definitely yes." Now 16 percent 
are saying this. On the no side 37 percent said "definitely no" 
one month ago. Now 34 percent are saying this. Taking a 
long-term view, we find that absolute certainty is on the 
decline: Ten percent fewer said "definitely no" in March than in 
November (44 vs. 34 percent).

  [Text] The Government has stressed that it is not willing 
to have any further discussions of the informal UN documents, 
because Turkish Cypriot leader Rauf Denktas has not accepted 
them. Government spokesman Ioannis Kasoulidhis said any further 
discussions or an extension of the deadline would be 
counterproductive if there is no Turkish political will to reach 
a solution. Kasoulidhis was commenting on a statement by a U.S. 
official to the Cyprus Broadcasting Corporation [CyBC] that he 
expects the Turkish side to be given two weeks to reply. 
  Kasoulidhis said the Cypriot Government expects the UN 
secretary general's report to be submitted in accordance with UN 
Security Council Resolution 902. He stressed that the report 
should fully describe the facts, which speak for themselves. He 
said there is no indication that the report and its conclusions 
is a temporary measure. 
  In his statement to CyBC, the U.S. official said that if the 
Turkish side continues its negative stance after the two-week 
deadline, the UN Security Council will consider alternative ways 
to implement its resolutions. The U.S. official said Robert 
Lamb, the U.S. State Department's special coordinator on the 
Cyprus issue, intends to discuss with the Turkish Government 
ways to overcome the latest obstacles. According to the same 
official, the basic obstacle is access to Famagusta. On this 
issue, Denktas demands satisfaction regarding who will guard the 
access and from what distance. The U.S. official said that 
eight of the 70 issues that Denktas asked clarification on are 
still pending.

  [Text] Ankara, April 1 (A.A.) -- Social Democratic 
Populist Party (SHP) [SDPP] leader and deputy prime minister 
Murat Karayalcin said today that his party will apply to the 
High Election Board to void the results of the local elections. 
  Karayalcin told a press conference prior to his party's 
group 
meeting, which will decide on whether to continue the coalition 
government, that his party was receiving a great number of 
documents, complaints and evidence, showing that the elections 
were fraudulent. 
  Karayalcin advised the citizens, already perplexed by the 
overwhelming victory of the fundamentalist Prosperity Party 
(RP), not to be provoked. 
  "Turkey is a state of law and the warranty of our freedoms 
is 
the legislation, not the municipalities," he said. 
  Karayalcin went on to say that no one had the right to 
intervene into the way people dressed, to the length of dresses 
women wore. 
  Karayalcin stressed that the country definitely did not have 
a Moslem-secularist conflict.

  [Text] Ankara, April 1 (A.A.) -- The Foreign Ministry said 
on Thursday [31 March] that Amnesty International was distorting 
the law and facts once again. 
  Foreign Ministry Spokesman Ferhat Ataman told the Anatolian 
Agency that Turkey was one of the countries who received the 
highest number of requests for asylum because of the tension in 
neighboring countries over the last 15 years. 
  "Without receiving assistance in many cases, Turkey has 
graciously extended help to these people, by going beyond its 
legislation," he said. 
  Ataman stressed that the accusations of Amnesty 
International 
that those asking asylum in Turkey were harassed by the police, 
were untrue. 
  "The policy of Turkey is not to send any person back, unless 
there are forcible reasons," he said. 
  Ataman also stressed that claims that foreign delegations 
were treated badly in Turkey were a distortion. 
  "The death threats of the separatist terror organization on 
voters and candidates in the southeast have created a serious 
terror and security problem in the region," he said. 
  "Our security units have naturally taken into account the 
security of the so-called observer delegations and the risks 
posed by the provocations of some of these in the region," he 
said. 
  Ataman stressed that it was very meaningful for Amnesty 
International to refrain from accepting terrorism as an activity 
which should be banned. 
  He added that by calling terrorists "guerrillas" Amnesty was 
legitimizing the terror organization.

<F P=106> [Report by Julio Riquelme: "People's Party Excluded From </F>
Democratic Impetus"] 
  [Excerpt] Madrid -- Following lengthy talks that finally 
proved fruitless, the government will go ahead with its 
"democratic impetus" plan. It involves filling the vacancy for 
an ombudsman -- a post that has been vacant for over a year -- 
and vacancies in the General Council of the Judiciary, the board 
of directors of the Spanish Radio and Television Company, the 
Nuclear Safety Council, and the Universities Council. 
  As Alfredo Perez Rubalcaba, minister of the Prime Minister's 
Office, announced following the cabinet meeting yesterday, there 
is an agreement between the Socialist parliamentary group and 
those of United Left, Convergence and Union, the Basque 
Nationalist Party, the Canary Islands Coalition, and the mixed 
group to present the Congress [of Deputies] in plenary session, 
following the Easter Week break, with a number of parliamentary 
initiatives winding up a lengthy series of talks in order to 
complete the above-mentioned "impetus." 
  Last, the leading opposition group -- the People's Party -- 
is excluded from an agreement that, according to Perez 
Rubalcaba, could no longer be postponed in order to prevent the 
above-mentioned bodies' "institutional deterioration." [passage

<F P=106> [Interview with Interior Minister Franz Loeschnak by Robert </F>
Stoppacher; place and date not given -- recorded] 
  [Text] Tens of thousands of people from Bosnia-Herzegovina 
have left their country and found refuge in Austria since the 
beginning of the war. Two years ago, federal and provincial 
authorities created the so-called de-facto refugee organization, 
intended to house and feed the refugees. The operation costs 
approximately 75 million schilling per month for some 40,000 
people. Another 20,000 have been accommodated by friends and 
relatives. All of them allegedly intend to stay in Austria. 
Interior Minister Franz Loeschnak has said that this is too 
many. Together with the UN High Commissioner for Refugees, he 
would like to organize the resettling of refugees. Yet, for the 
time being, the aid for the Bosnian refugees should continue. 
The operation, which has been sponsored by the Interior 
Ministry and provincial authorities, was scheduled to expire at 
the end of June. 
  [Loeschnak] We are planning to extend the operation to the 
end of the year. We are aware of the fact that, even if the war 
were to end within the next few days or weeks, the operation 
cannot be phased out by late June because several thousand will 
probably be unable to return. We have to continue our efforts 
to integrate a part of the war refugees. 
  [Stoppacher] For months, you have been appealing to 
provincial and local authorities to take action. Has some 
progress been achieved as far as integration is concerned? 
  [Loeschnak] This is really a slow process, and one has to be 
persistent. I hope we have that persistence. At least as far 
as work permits are concerned, we have found jobs for a few 
thousand people. 
  [Stoppacher] How many exactly? 
  [Loeschnak] A total of 9,500 within one year. This is quite 
an achievement. 
  [Stoppacher] Some 9,500 out of a total of almost 60,000. 
  [Loeschnak] That is not quite right. We assume that only 
20,000 of the 60,000 refugees are fit for work. The remainder 
-- the great majority -- are elderly people and women with many 
children. So, we start from a number of 20,000, half of whom 
have found employment. We will try to find jobs for a few 
thousand more over the next few months. As far as housing is 
concerned, the situation is not as good. A few weeks ago, we 
had intensive discussions with the provinces on several 
alternatives. I hope that the provinces will take up one or the 
other initiative. 
  [Stoppacher] Could you elaborate on that? 
  [Loeschnak] We have mainly considered refurbishing existing 
housing stock in the provinces with Federal Government support. 
We are now waiting for the provincial authorities to take some 
action, the funding of which could be discussed with the finance 
minister. If peace were really to be restored, we would have to 
consider a repatriation operation in coordination with the UNHCR 
to encourage the people to return to their home country. 
  [Stoppacher] Repatriation always sounds a bit dangerous. 
Would that mean on an absolutely voluntary basis? 
  [Loeschnak] All those allegations that have been made 
ranging from deportation -- as it was called -- to forced 
repatriation have never been justified because such actions have 
never taken place in Austria. We have always talked with the 
people, even when the armed conflict, for example in Croatia, 
was over. Of the 28,000, a total of 26,500 returned at that 
time. Some 1,000 could not or would not return, and we were 
able to make the necessary provisions for them.

  [Text] Paris, March 31 (AFP) -- Poland and Hungary asked 
Thursday [31 March] to be considered for early associate 
membership of the Western European Union [WEU]. 
  Poland's ambassador to France, Jerzy Lukaszewski, told a 
press conference with his Hungarian counterpart Janos Szavai 
that they wanted their countries' membership in the military 
alliance to be considered at a WEU ministerial meeting in May. 
  The two countries are already members of the Partnership for 
Peace initiative, which gives former Warsaw Pact members closer 
cooperation with the North Atlantic Treaty Organization, 
ultimately with a view to full NATO membership. 
  Thursday's press conference was called ahead of the two 
countries' official applications to join the European Union, 
both due to be handed in in early April. They hope to become 
members by 2000. 
  Lukaszewski said EU membership would provide "the best 
way...of ensuring a democratic future and security" for his 
country, as well as "something useful for the European Union."

  [Text] Foreign Secretary Manuel Tello said yesterday Latin 
America could face a trade deficit with Europe--the first time 
in 30 years--if Europe does not clear certain "confusions that 
could lead to a type of protectionism." 
  During opening ceremonies of the 10th San Jose Mechanism 
Ministers Meeting in Athens, Greece, Tello demanded the European 
nations broaden their new preference system for Latin America in 
order to improve trade relations between the two regions. 
  Tello told the foreign ministers of Europe and the Group of 
Three [G-3] (Mexico, Colombia, and Venezuela) that Latin America 
has become one of the most dynamic markets for European exports 
over the last three years. 
  Latin America's entry into that process, he added, is based 
on an open regional strategy, and the economic reforms taking 
place on the continent have contributed significantly to the 
process of worldwide trade liberalization. 
  Exports from Latin America to Europe have declined since 
1989, and, if this trend continues, we will be faced with a 
rather high deficit for the first time in three decades. 
  He believes the European Union [EU] should establish a new 
system of general preferences that are effective for longer 
periods. 
  He added that the new system should eliminate any type of 
"confusion" regarding health matters that might suggest some 
form of protectionism. 
  According to the official, exports coming from the EU into 
the region have increased by about 33 percent, totaling 
approximately $20 billion. 
  He announced the G-3 will sign a free trade agreement in 
1994, while integration efforts in Latin America could conclude 
by 1997. 
  At the meeting, attended by representatives from Guatemala, 
Honduras, El Salvador, Costa Rica, Nicaragua, Panama, the EU, 
and the G-3, Mexico suggested action be taken to allow Central 
America greater access to the global scene.

<F P=106> [Unattributed report: "Numbers of Unemployed Down"] </F>
  [Excerpt] As a result of recent figures, Social Affairs 
Minister Josef Hesoun has spotted a turn of the tide on the 
labor market. 
  "Unemployment is decreasing significantly," Hesoun said. At 
the end of March, 228,865 people were registered as unemployed, 
thus 4.3 percent fewer than at the same time last year. Apart 
from the stimulation of the labor market through the spring 
season and the mild weather, there was also a stimulation of the 
economy, Hesoun noted. With an unemployment rate of 4.6 
percent, as calculated according to OECD methodology, Austria 
retains the third best international position. Only Luxembourg 
(2.7 percent) and Japan (2.7 percent) have more favorable rates.

  [Text] Here in the Netherlands an aircraft belonging to the 
Dutch airline KLM has crashed while landing at Amsterdam's 
Schiphol airport. At least three of the 24 people on board have 
been killed; 13 others were seriously injured and eight people 
received slight injuries. 
  The aircraft, a Swedish-made Saab 340, had taken off from 
Schiphol bound for Cardiff in Wales. Shortly after departure, 
however, the pilot reported engine trouble and returned to the 
airport. While landing, the plane overshot the runway, crashed 
into a nearby field, and broke in two. Eyewitnesses report 
seeing an explosion but no fire. Air traffic to and from 
Schiphol was temporarily stopped after the accident.

<F P=106> [Piet Lambrechts commentary: "Time Bomb"] </F>
  [Text] Jean-Luc Dehaene, Willy Claes, and their colleagues 
in the other EU [European Union] member states can polish off 
their Easter eggs in peace and quiet. For the European Union 
(EU) has once again been saved, thanks to a compromise which, 
though the product of a Greek brain, deserves, more than 
anything else, to be classified as Belgian. After all, a 
compromise on the voting procedure following the EU enlargement 
was finally reached with the awkward British and Spanish. The 
fact that this settlement places European decisionmaking and 
integration on unsteady footing is evidently a worry to the 
members of our government. 
  Normally speaking, the blocking minority in the European 
Council of Ministers, after the accession of four new member 
states, should increase proportionately from 23 to 27 votes. 
However, the United Kingdom and Spain managed to negotiate an 
understanding that if member states together accounting for 
between 23 and 26 votes oppose a decision, then that decision 
will be subjected to a "reasonable" delay. In other words, the 
British Government wants to be in a position to block any 
further step toward European integration, while the Spanish 
Government is seeking to protect its financial interests. The 
British Government, in particular, succeeded in making British 
obstinacy a "European problem." After all, the question as to 
how Europe intended to resolve the British problem was asked 
openly. In that context, it once again emerged that the British 
attitude was connected not only with the intention of 
maintaining its present position of power, but also with the 
uncertain position of John Major as party leader and head of his 
government. 
  Instead of putting the British under fire, telling them that 
they should jolly well solve their own problems, and that they 
certainly had no right to change the rules governing European 
decisionmaking with the help of the Spanish, the other member 
states were brought to their knees by the threat of British and 
Spanish intransigence. The excuse made by those 10 member states 
was that, if no concession had been made, then the accession of 
the candidate member states on 1 January 1995 would have been 
put at risk, as if the postponement of accession was a more 
daunting prospect than weakening the EU itself by undermining 
the decisionmaking process. The Ten maintain that the blocking 
minority in fact was set at 27 votes, and that a minority of 
between 23 and 26 votes can only delay any particular decision 
for a "reasonable" period of time. To begin with, the concept 
of "reasonable period of time" is extremely open to 
interpretation. Furthermore, the possibility of such a delay 
contains all the germs of fresh crises and stalemates. While 
any member state and the European Commission can call for a vote 
at any moment, will this really happen if a number of countries 
steadfastly refuse to allow it? 
  The EU is reaping what it has sown. The irresponsible 
refusal to address this issue before the talks on accession 
began has meant that the so painfully secured rule of voting by 
a qualified majority is now at risk once more. Even if no use 
is ever made of the famous compromise in practice, it is still 
irresponsible to lay such a time bomb underneath the Union's 
decisionmaking process. And the fact that the compromise will 
only apply until the upcoming Intergovernmental Conference 
scheduled for 1996 is pure nonsense. What British or Spanish 
Government will then relinquish the rights it has only just 
acquired? There is one thing that the governments of the Twelve 
can certainly not deny: Nothing has come of their solemn 
promise to see the EU enlargement be accompanied by its 
deepening. On the contrary.

<F P=106> [U.D. Jonker commentary: "British Sickness Seeps Further </F>
Into European Union"] 
  [Text] The crisis that was not a crisis has found a 
solution that does not resolve anything. Europe can continue on 
its way. The question is, where is it headed? In an enlarged 
European Community, 16 member states will cover all the points 
of the compass if they all indicate the way ahead. What 
political buoyancy there was following the trauma surrounding 
the ratification of the Maastricht Treaty to agree on the terms 
of its implementation was worn out over the past month. 
  Irascibility runs high. A new treaty does not make old 
dividing lines fade away. As the French say, the British are 
remaining British and the Germans are remaining German, even if 
they have been posing as good Europeans for the last 49 years. 
For France, the vim and vigor with which German Foreign 
Minister Klaus Kinkel forced the accession of Austria, Finland, 
and Sweden upon his EC partners was needless proof of Germany 
being sure of itself. The open resentment of this, and the 
public reconciliation which followed, point to excessive 
flexibility in the axis around which the EC has to keep rotating. 
  The climate is not being improved by the hints of threats 
aimed at the small member states by Spain, Italy, and the United 
Kingdom. This is the last enlargement in which they will get off 
so lightly. "It would be absurd if France, Germany, and the 
United Kingdom could be outvoted by small member states," said 
Prime Minister Major last week. Neither Bonn nor Paris would 
disagree. 
  London was counting on it proving easy to sow the seed of 
dissent. However, it set itself up as an unsuspecting lightning 
conductor in a charged atmosphere. "Everyone has the feeling 
that this will not happen again, the British simply saying no 
and subsequently getting their own way," said one diplomat as 
early as last week. 
  This was the unequivocal message delivered to British 
Foreign 
Secretary Douglas Hurd when he was offered a final compromise in 
Ioannina this week. "Take it or be damned," was the edict, 
which was not meant to be taken personally. European Commission 
President Jacques Delors had already expressed his amazement at 
the way in which the amiable and irreproachable Hurd "dazzlingly 
advocated the impossible." 
  "The flexibility has gone, they are at their wit's end," 
said 
Hurd. According to insiders, the tenor of the argument with 
which Hurd forced his prime minister in the direction of Europe 
on Monday and Tuesday was that "if we say no again, then we will 
cause irreparable damage." John Major would appear to have 
suffered irreparable damage. However, his political decline 
would threaten to drag down the EC with it. 
  The difficulties arising in the debate on enlargement can 
only become more serious now that the European Parliament is 
showing its teeth. In Strasbourg, the members of parliament are 
fuming over the concession made to the United Kingdom. They 
cannot let their final opportunity to grab the Council of 
Ministers by the scruff of the neck before the June elections 
pass them by. Enlargement is a high price to pay, but it is 
worth it to save their own credibility, believes a sizeable 
proportion of the members of the European Parliament, 260 of 
whom must vote in favor of accession. 
  They are not wrong. The Ioannina compromise on the voting 
procedure in an enlarged EC can be viewed as a concession of 
merely cosmetic value to the British. Formally speaking, 
however, they can only delay a decision by teaming up with one 
large member state and one small one. They cannot prevent it 
altogether, as is currently the case, unless they get at least 
one more small member state on their side. Accordingly, their 
voice has already been weakened, and the 10 member states [which 
successfully reached agreement on the voting issue] are getting 
things their way. 
  And yet the so-called British virus which was already 
lodged in the structure of the Community when the Maastricht 
Treaty was signed, is beginning to multiply on the quiet. It is 
a selective virus, which is merely out to smother political, 
social, and economic cooperation. Market integration would 
appear to be largely unaffected. 
  Furthermore, one notable symptom is that it rears its head 
whenever its own body has been weakened. The virus causes the 
British sickness and is accompanied by bouts of deep depression 
in Brussels, and sends waves of nausea sweeping through large 
groups of people in the rest of Europe. 
  The EC itself, the main pillar of the European Union, which 
is poisoned by it, was not altogether free of pain, as things 
were. However, decisions could still be made in major areas in 
line with the supranational idea that the member states of the 
Community would relinquish part of their sovereignty even 
against their better judgement. Now and then that proves 
painful. However, the political consolation is that the balance 
of both the negative and positive effects of integration is, by 
definition, almost positive. 
  For that reason, Austria, Finland, Sweden, and Norway are 
knocking at the door of the EC. Remember, even the United 
Kingdom joined back in 1973. It is just that London is inclined 
to calculate the advantages and disadvantages in terms of 
clanking coins. Most other countries also take account of the 
nonmaterial achievements of the EC, which safeguard their 
freedom within the process of European unification. That is 
also the most valuable feature of the Union's umbrella in the 
eyes of the countries of Central Europe. Since the Norman 
invasion, the United Kingdom has never been enslaved by another 
European people, and it therefore views the political dimension 
of the Union merely as a threat to its freedom and independence. 
  "We are all islands shouting lies at each other across seas 
of misunderstanding," would appear to be an accurate and 
up-to-date British definition of the EC, even if the writer 
Rudyard Kipling was actually speaking about himself and his 
fellow countrymen. A miscaculation was made in the latest 
crisis. The continental Europeans did not allow themselves to 
be jostled apart. However, they did make the EC slightly less 
European and slightly more British. 
  If they want to bring the British sickness to a halt, then 
there is an effective remedy. Even if Spain and the United 
Kingdom are both against a proposal, they still need another 
member state to form a delaying majority. If the Ten were to 
declare that they will not participate in forming a delaying 
majority of 23 votes, but only a real blocking minority of 27 
votes, then they will take the wind out of the United Kingdom's 
sails. 
  They can then count on receiving the sympathy of the 
European 
Parliament and thus guarantee that enlargement can take place on 
1 January. It goes without saying that the Netherlands and 
Belgium will together be the first to make a unilateral 
declaration of this kind. They do not recognize the Luxembourg 
compromise whereby France called a false veto into being, 
either. After all, the Hague says that it will go along with 
the compromise merely to preserve the consensus. In this way, 
the British could be shown that the EC member states are not 
just islands.

<F P=106> [Unattributed report: "Germany as a Business Location"] </F>
  [Text] The European operations of the Iranian secret 
service, VEVAK, are now obviously being controlled from Bonn. 
Western intelligence services have identified Vahid Attarian, 
an Embassy councilor who was recently sent to Germany, as the 
mullah regime's highest ranking agent in West Europe. 
  Attarian is unknown to counterintelligence. Experts noted 
with astonishment that Bonn is his first permanent post in a 
Western country. 
  At least as interesting for Iran experts is that the new 
legal resident replaces 'Ali Reza Hakikian, who was linked with 
the Berlin "Mykonos" murders of 17 September 1992. During the 
attack four opposition politicians of the Democratic Party of 
Kurdistan-Iran (DPK-I) were killed. Hakikian left Bonn after 
five and a half years in October 1993 -- shortly before the 
beginning of the "Mykonos" trial in the Berlin courts. 
  The suspicion did not hurt Hakikian. At VEVAK's headquarters 
in Tehran, which is officially called "the Information 
Ministry," he is now reportedly working with Amir Iravani, head 
of the West Europe Department. 
  Germany's Western partners are watching the oriental spy 
carousel with mocking comments: "Proof of trust for Germany as 
a business location...." 
  The "all too familiar dealings" of Germany's intelligence 
service coordinator, State Minister Bernd Schmidbauer, with 
Iran's intelligence service chief, 'Ali Fallahian, are uncanny 
for some friends on this and the other side of the Atlantic. At 
the beginning of last October Schmidbauer even received him in 
the chancellor's office. 
  The subject of the conversation: Bonn offered itself as 
mediator for an exchange of hostages in the Middle East. 
According to Schmidbauer's own statements -- to the secret 
Control Committee of the Bundestag -- he resisted the guest's 
suggestions that Bonn manipulate the "Mykonos" trial for Iran's 
benefit.

  [Text] The export deal with Iraq, which a man from 
Mannheim initiated via the German Mission to the UN in New York, 
has been suspended for the time being. For the export 
application, Ariel Schweininger, the wire-puller of the deal, 
used a new procedure established for "fair trading" that permits 
making parallel permit applications. The applications were made 
in New York beforehand and, only four weeks later, at the 
Federal Export Office in Eschborn. In addition: Eschborn has 
received applications for deliveries worth 85 million German 
marks, and New York has received applications for exports worth 
$1.3 billion. At the moment, the federal authorities are 
checking whether Schweininger is to free some of Iraq's frozen 
foreign currency reserves with this deal.

<F P=106> [Article by Sylvie Maligorne] </F>
  [Text] Paris, April 5 (AFP) -- Prime Minister Edouard 
Balladur starts a three-day visit to Beijing Thursday [7 April] 
determined to revitalize trade after a row over French aircraft 
sales Taiwan cost French firms hundreds of millions of dollars 
on the Chinese market. 
  "The goal is to open the door and to ensure that 
discrimination (against French companies) is eliminated," an 
aide to the prime minister explained. 
  Authorities here do not expect Balladur to return bearing 
fat 
contracts. But they do want to see the ice broken. 
  "In China, as elsewhere, contracts are won by constant 
presence and frequent visits," the aide explained. "Nothing can 
be done without such an opening." 
  Forced onto the sidelines for more than a year, during which 
the Chinese economy flourished, French exporters are eagerly 
awaiting the first fruits of a normalization in Franco-Chinese 
relations. 
  The two countries ended their rift in a joint communique 
issued January 12. 
  China recorded economic growth of 13.5 percent last year, 
when imports shot up 27 percent. The surge in buying was worth 
nearly 100 billion dollars for foreign companies. 
  But French firms were in essence ruled out of the 
competition 
for the lucrative Chinese market after the 1992 sale to Taiwan 
of 60 Mirage 2000-5s. 
  In Canton, where the French consulate was shut down, France 
lost a subway contract to Germany. Funds totalling two billion 
French francs (340 million dollars) to finance contracts for the 
telecommunications group Alcatel-CIT have also been frozen. 
  Sources here estimated that French companies last year lost 
between three and six billion francs (517 million and 1.03 
billion dollars) in Chinese contracts. 
  As a result France recorded a trade deficit with China that 
came to 12 billion francs (2.06 billion dollars) in 1993, 
against 11 billion francs in 1992. 
  Before the row over the aircraft sales, France's share of 
the 
Chinese market came to three percent, a figure that had fallen 
to 1.6 percent in 1993. The German share last year was nearly 
six percent and the Italian 2.6 percent. 
  But with normalization of relations French firms should once 
again be able to compete in such key sectors as automobiles, 
railways, grain, water treatment and construction. 
  Aides to Balladur stress that China's needs are great, 
noting 
Chinese energy and telecommunications requirements account for a 
quarter of demand in such sectors worldwide. 
  In addition, they added, China is seen as a reliable payer.

  [Text] Arcore, Italy, April 4 (AFP) -- A row escalated 
Monday [4 April] between Silvio Berlusconi, whose Forza Italia 
led Italy's general election, and his critical Northern League 
ally, making the chances of forming a government together 
increasingly remote. 
  The media magnate, who launched Forza Italia (Go Italy) only 
a few months before last weekend's election, broke his 
diplomatic silence Monday and attacked Northern League leader 
Umberto Bossi after failing to make headway on a new cabinet. 
  Bossi has rejected Berlusconi as a candidate for the post of 
prime minister, demanded greater local autonomy as a condition 
for joining the government and declined a further meeting with 
him in favour of talks with opposition parties. 
  "Umberto Bossi seems to want to give way to the temptation 
of 
falling into the old rut" by including in the process groups 
which were "rejected" by electors, Berlusconi said in a 
statement from his home at Arcore, near Milan. 
  Bossi immediately reacted by calling an impromptu press 
conference at his home in nearby Ponte Di Legno. 
  "A party which does not exist has won the elections thanks 
to 
manipulation of television, creating a Kafkaesque situation," 
said Bossi. "Citizens should understand that in such a 
situation, only the League can guarantee democracy." 
  Berlusconi had warned the League in his statement that its 
new deputies, elected thanks to the Forza Italia campaign, 
should remain "loyal to its electors and allies." 
  "We will never forget that Forza Italia is the movement 
which 
gave voters the means to demolish" the discredited old political 
system. "We will continue to look for an agreement" with Forza's 
electoral partners, he said. 
  The Northern League and Forza Italia are in a fragile 
alliance with the right-wing neo-fascist Italian Social Movement 
(MSI), which favours greater central control. 
  But Bossi Monday repeated earlier protests against a 
possible 
inclusion of the MSI, stating two conditions for participating 
in the government -- "No to Berlusconi as prime minister, and no 
to a government with MSI." 
  The MSI spokesman Francesco Storace, joining the fray Monday 
evening, said Bossi "could have realised before now that 
Berlusconi posed a threat to democracy." Voters had "chosen the 
alliances selected by Berlusconi," he added.

<F P=106> [Article by Ole Bang Nielsen: "EU Skeptical as to Danish </F>
Job-Creation Reform"] 
  [Text] The Danish reform of the job market is far from 
solving Danish unemployment problems, according to a EU 
[European Union] report concerning the Danish economy. 
  Even though the Danish labor market reforms and the new 
annual leave system have considerable merit, they will not 
permanently solve Danish unemployment problems, according to a 
report on Danish economic conditions written by the EU 
Commission. 
  "The system of unemployment compensation and the entire 
social welfare system overall are behind many of the structural 
problems in the Danish labor market system," it says in the 
report. 
  The advantages of the Danish labor market reforms, according 
to the EU report, are that the unemployed are forced back into 
the labor market at an earlier stage than before. However, 
Denmark needs to go farther in liberalizing its labor market 
system, the report says. 
  In general an optimistic note is struck concerning the 
Danish 
economy. As an open economy, Denmark has the best opportunity to 
take advantage of the integrated European economy and thus lower 
unemployment, according to the report. 
  Should the EU be expanded to include the other Nordic 
countries and also open closer economic ties to the East 
European and Baltic countries, Denmark's role as an investment 
target for foreign companies will increase. As regards domestic 
consumption, the EU does not see any great opportunities for 
growth. The Danish economy will grow in future years due to 
growing Danish exports, according to the report. 
  The weakness of the Danish krone on the European currency 
market, however, will continue to create problems for the Danish 
economy. For years Denmark's real interest rate has been much 
too high (that is, the real price of borrowing money after 
making adjustments for the effect of inflation) compared to the 
strength of the Danish economy, according to a survey in the 
report. 
  If the currency rate of the Danish krone is to be maintained 
relative to the German mark, that will necessarily be harmful to 
the growth of the Danish economy, it is stated.

  [Text] The United Nations awaits the results of the 
contacts of Robert Lamb, U.S. State Department special 
coordinator on Cyprus, in Ankara before making public the UN 
secretary general's report to the UN Security Council [UNSC] 
regarding the talks on the confidence-building measures. A U.S. 
official told Apostolis Zoumbaniotis, CyBC [Cyprus Broadcasting 
Corporation] correspondent in New York, that the UN secretary 
general's report is expected to finally be given to the Security 
Council tomorrow. 
  The CyBC correspondent also reports that all indications are 
that the Turkish side will be given 15 days to accept the 
latest proposals of Joe Clark, the UN secretary general's 
special representative for Cyprus, regarding the means of 
implementing the confidence-building measures. The CyBC 
correspondent reports the possibility of the Security Council 
putting substantial pressure on the Turkish side is very slight 
due to strong objections by the United States. 
  Security Council circles told the CyBC correspondent that it 
can not be ruled out that after the expiration of the 15 day 
time limit, President Glavkos Kliridhis and [Turkish Cypriot 
Leader] Rauf Denktas will be invited to go to New York, either 
to sign an agreement or for a coordinated effort to find a 
compromise with the participation of the UN secretary general 
and the five permanent members of the Security Council.

<F P=106> ["Address to the Nation" by Prime Minister Tansu Ciller on 4 </F>
April 1994; place not given -- recorded] 
  [Text] My dear citizens, the local elections are behind 
us. I am happy that, contrary to expectations certain circles 
tried to create, the 27 March elections were held in peace, 
without incidents. I am at peace before you. The True Path 
Party emerged as the first party from these elections. We are 
the first party throughout the country. I extend my gratitude 
to our nation for the trust it showed in us. 
  The Turkish people have faith. They are attached to their 
traditions. Nobody should try to use religion as a tool for 
politics. We are the guarantee for freedom of religion and 
freedom of conscience. We are also the guarantee of the basic 
tenets of the state, mainly secularism. Do not worry. The law 
of the Turkish Republic is binding and valid for everyone and 
everywhere in Turkey. 
  Now is not the time to look back any more. We must look 
forward. I am saying it clearly: We will fulfill our promises. 
  I saw once again that our people always know the right thing 
to do. Our people are aware of our struggle against terrorism. 
They appreciate that we managed to do in seven to eight months 
what was not done in eight years. With your contributions, with 
your trust in us, 1994 will be a final turning point in the 
struggle against terrorism. I will fulfill my promise. 
Terrorism will fall far back on Turkey's agenda. 
  My dear citizens, we are now ready for another struggle. A 
struggle as important as the one against terrorism. The 
struggle against an economy which over many years has been 
turned into a big tangled knot. 
  Tomorrow, together with Mr. Karayalcin, our coalition 
partner 
and leader of the Social Democratic Populist Party, we will 
disclose a brand new economic implementation plan. Tomorrow 
will be the start of a new era, the harbinger of improvement 
that will follow. We will carry out radical reforms no 
political government or leader dared implement before us. We 
will lay the foundation of structural changes in the economy. 
Before all else, we will carry out a revolution of mentality, 
of mind sets. 
  These are difficult decisions. Maybe, in the first stage, 
they will hurt. However, we do not have an alternative. This is 
not a matter of choice. It is certainly not a political 
maneuver. Nor does it have any arbitrary aspects whatsoever. 
  Together, we will make a sacrifice for the future of our 
country, for the future of our children. Everyone will put his 
share in this sacrifice in line with his or her economic 
ability. We will make social justice and social consensus 
sovereign. You gave me your consensus in the fight against 
terrorism. We made progress. Now it is the turn of the 
economy. We will break the chains of the economy. We will 
break the chains of its difficulties. We will eliminate the 
vicious circle of debts, interest, and foreign exchange. We 
will save our youths from being jobless in the future. We will 
really crush the head of the monster called inflation. We will 
make the people's money the people's money. We will make the 
Turkish money, our national monetary unit, trustworthy. We will 
grow economically with sound resources. We will do this so that 
Turkey's future will not be blocked, so that it will be open and 
well-lit. 
  This will be a very comprehensive program. It will be a 
restructuring, a kind of rejuvenation, never tried before and 
involving all the sectors. I am not hiding it: In the 
beginning we might have difficulties. Protests might come not 
only from our civil servants, workers, shopkeepers, and farmers, 
but from the wealthy sectors as well. However, you should know 
that if our nation is to put these difficulties behind and look 
to the future with confidence, we must take this medicine. We 
might have temporary difficulties, but we will certainly gain a 
healthy constitution. We will erase all the bad elements of 
this inherited responsibility. We will break our links to the 
past, to the mistakes of the past, and start a new era. I trust 
your patriotism. 
  That is what makes us different. This is the spirit and 
mentality which defines our political character. 
  My dear citizens, I am calling on you: Let us win this war 
together, hand in hand. Let us get rid of the dark clouds 
hovering over the country. Let us make our current difficulties 
the harbingers of a happy future. Let us emerge victorious from 
the economic liberation war. Our nation is strong enough to 
succeed in that. Now is not the time for politics, for petty 
calculations, or for egotistical interests. We are responsible 
before history. Let us write our history. We are responsible 
for our future. We are responsible toward our children. We all 
have a duty to perform at this historic turning point. As 
individuals, as a nation, we will succeed in performing this 
difficult duty. History will cite 5 April 1994 as the turning 
point of Turkey's economic liberation. Together, with 
dedication, we will end this dark period and create light. 
  Everything for a proud and powerful Turkey. Everything for a 
modern, dynamic, and peaceful Turkey. Everything for a 
developed, faithful, stable, leader that is Turkey. 
  I greet you all with respect.

  [Text] Prime Minister Tansu Ciller briefed political party 
leaders on the economic stability package. 
  Ciller, True Path Party leader and prime minister, is 
continuing to seek a consensus in connection with the economic 
stability package. She first visited Motherland Party [ANAP] 
leader Mesut Yilmaz at his office in parliament. 
  In a statement before the meeting, Ciller said that the main 
aim of her visit was to seek a consensus in connection with the 
economic measures. She said she would explain her views and 
listen to the views of the opposition leader. She said: 
  [Begin Ciller recording] We are starting an important 
struggle. We want a consensus from every sector of the society. 
We will listen to the views of the opposition leader. 
Naturally, different views might be expressed. However, I 
consider this a national problem, therefore I think it is 
appropriate for me to set off with this approach. I will also 
have the opportunity to ask him for his opinion on other issues. 
[end recording] 
  In a statement after the meeting, ANAP leader Yilmaz said 
that Ciller briefed him on the economic measures she will 
disclose tomorrow. He said that Ciller asked that this 
information not be divulged until she announces the measures 
tomorrow. Yilmaz said that he will express his views on the 
economic measures after the prime minister announces them. 
  Asked if the prime minister asked for his support for the 
economic measures, Yilmaz replied: 
  [Begin Yilmaz recording] She did not ask for our direct 
support. However, she stressed that these measures are 
inevitable given the current state of the economy, that they 
are, in fact, late in coming. She said that she expects us to 
approach the issue with this understanding. [end recording] 
  Yilmaz pointed out that at the end of their meeting, the 
prime minister asked him his opinion about a unification of the 
right. Yilmaz said that he reiterated his earlier remarks on the 
issue. 
  [Begin Yilmaz recording] I pointed out that there is a 
coalition government at the moment. I said that we do not 
consider it right, in principle, to discuss the issue as long as 
this coalition is in power. I said, however, that if this issue 
becomes actual in the future for whatever reason, if Turkey is 
faced with such a necessity, we will approach this issue 
constructively. [end recording] 
  Prime Minister Tansu Ciller met with Prosperity Party 
leader Necmettin Erbakan. Before the meeting, the prime 
minister said that she would brief Erbakan on the economic 
package and listen to his views. She stressed that a first step 
will be taken tomorrow in implementing a series of important 
economic measures. Within this framework, she said, I will 
visit all the party leaders, adding: This is such a struggle 
but it can succeed if all the sectors in the country are united 
in supporting it as much as possible. 
  In a statement after the meeting, Erbakan said that the 
package is nothing but new price hikes, taxes, and the closing 
of factories. He maintained that this will crush the people and 
said that he warned the prime minister that there will be social 
explosions in the end. He alleged that the economic package 
will further exacerbate the rate of inflation and unemployment. 
  Asked if the prime minister asked for his party's support, 
Erbakan replied: 
  [Begin Erbakan recording] We listened to the outline the 
prime minister gave us. It became clear once again that what 
they call a package involves nothing but price hikes, the 
closing down of numerous institutions, and new taxes -- 
everything to be carried out in periods of three months. We 
warned her about what these measures might lead to. [end 
recording] 
  Prime Minister Ciller then briefed the True Path Party 
Assembly group on the economic measures. It was a closed 
session.

  [Text] Berlin (DDP/ADN) -- German Foreign Minister Klaus 
Kinkel has called upon North Korea to open its nuclear 
installations immediately to inspections of the International 
Atomic Energy Agency. He was very concerned about North Korea's 
continuing refusal to meet its obligations under the nuclear 
Nonproliferation Treaty, Kinkel told the daily newspaper DIE 
WELT (Tuesday [5 April] edition). Any state's violation of the 
treaty was a serious danger to world peace. 
  As a state which had renounced the production of ABC 
[atomic, 
biological, chemical] weapons under international law, Germany 
supported the nonproliferation of all weapons of mass 
destruction. In this connection, Kinkel referred to his 
suggestion of a worldwide cooperative policy of nonproliferation 
of 15 December 1993. Kinkel said that he strongly supported the 
unlimited extension of the nuclear nonproliferation treaty, 
which was due for renewal in 1995.

  [Text] Bonn (DDP/ADN) -- Foreign Minister Klaus Kinkel has 
again urged Turkey to use weapons supplied through German 
military aid exclusively within the scope of the NATO mandate of 
the Turkish armed forces. In a letter to his Turkish 
counterpart, Hikmet Cetin, published in Bonn today, Kinkel wrote 
that Cetin should see to it that the relevant agreement of June 
1992 was complied with. 
  The German foreign minister referred to the fact that 
politicians and the media kept claiming that weapons supplied by 
Germany were being used inside Turkey in the fight against the 
banned Workers Party of Kurdistan (PKK) contrary to the terms of 
the agreement. The Turkish Government knew "that this problem 
has considerable influence on the shaping of bilateral 
relations," Kinkel said.

  [Text] Bavarian plans to deport militant Kurds to Turkey 
are not supported by Federal Justice Minister 
Leutheusser-Schnarrenberger. As long as there is even the 
slightest danger that the affected people will be threatened by 
torture and death, they must not be deported, she stated in 
Bonn. The minister pointed out that many Kurds have been 
recognized as asylum-seekers, and that, within the framework of 
the negotiations on the asylum compromise, Turkey was regarded 
by all parties as an unsafe country of origin.

criticism by Justice Minister Leutheusser-Schnarrenberger 
concerning the planned deportation of militant Kurds. In an 
interview with western German radio this morning, Beckstein 
accused the justice minister of a lack of legal knowledge, 
stressing that the existing laws cover his action. 
Leutheusser-Schnarrenberger criticized the fact that a simple 
statement by the Turkish ambassador on the security of deported 
Kurds should be sufficient. She rejected the deportations as 
long as it cannot be ruled out that those affected do not face 
torture or death in Turkey.

<F P=106> [Unattributed report: "Double Strategy"] </F>
  [Text] After the violent Kurdish protests of the past 
weeks, security experts now expect a more quiet period. In the 
view of the security authorities, the banned Workers Party of 
Kurdistan, PKK, is not interested in a more serious conflict 
with the German authorities. 
  "The PKK has succeeded in putting the Kurdish problem in the 
limelight again," a high ranking official told FOCUS, "now they 
are trying to gain ground on the political and diplomatic 
stage." This includes congresses in other West European 
countries, organized by camouflage organizations or 
suborganizations of the PKK and staffed with renowned scientists 
and politicians. 
  "One cannot speak of giving the all-clear," the official 
continued. There is no indication at all that the PKK is 
retreating from its double strategy -- constantly alternating 
between attacks and diplomatic efforts. 
  The security authorities still have problems with the 
strictly closed cadre structures of the PKK -- and the power of 
the functionaries to mobilize crowds in the shortest possible 
time. The fact that demonstrators do not always come 
voluntarily is shown by latest findings of the Augsburg police 
about the highway riots last week: Even Kurdish children were 
forced under threat of physical violence to get on the buses for 
Augsburg.

    [Editorial Report] Berlin N-TV in German at 1810 GMT on 4 
April carries the first edition of a new daily program called 
"Newspunkt," introduced by N-TV editor in chief Hans-Peter. 
  In the studio, Staisch reviews the historical background and 
at 1820 GMT broadcasts a prerecorded interview with Foreign 
Minister Klaus Kinkel. Staisch's first question concerns why 
Europe is hardly involved in the peace efforts. 
  Kinkel responds: "I do not think that with regard to the 
Middle East peace process one can say that we are completely out 
of the picture. On the contrary, within the framework of the 
European Union [EU] we have done all we can politically, but 
also, very important, economically, for the region. We have 
supported the peace process. For example, we have tried to call 
upon those who still oppose this peace process to join in and to 
give up their resistance. And we have done everything possible 
within the framework of the multilateral opportunities to help, 
and that is not a little." 
  Staisch asks: "To what extent is our overheated domestic 
situation, with regard to antiforeigner feeling, to new 
escalations against the Jews -- I am thinking here about the 
debate, one can hardly call it a debate, the slandering of 
Ignatz Bubis [chairman of the Jewish Community in Germany]. To 
what extent is this domestic situation a brake on our 
effectiveness in becoming involved in this peace process?" 
  Kinkel replies: "I am very glad that this awful event in 
Luebeck [the firebombing of the synagogue] was received 
relatively calmly in Israel. But of course the violence from 
the extreme Right here is something which burdens our foreign 
policy as a whole. I always try to put it as simply as this: 
Moelln and Solingen [scenes of earlier antiforeigner attacks] 
have not been forgotten, not by any means. And of course the 
attack on the synagogue in Luebeck gives the whole matter 
another negative, unpleasant [word indistinct]. 
  ``In my talks at home and abroad, my partners raise this 
topic again and again and it is very difficult to explain how 
such a thing can happen in Germany again.'' 
  Regarding the deadline for the agreement reached on Maundy 
Thursday 13 April, about nine days away, Staisch asks Kinkel 
whether he is "optimistic" that on 13 April this peace process 
will get a huge boost. 
  Kinkel says: "Well I hope that what was agreed on Maundy 
Thursday will actually be put into practice. I think it is 
necessary. After the awful events in Hebron it looked for a 
long time as if the process had come to a standstill. The week 
before last I had a long talk here with the Syrian foreign 
minister. I talked to other colleagues about it; we had a full 
discussion of the topic last weekend at our European Union 
meeting in Greece, and we thought about how we could help. I am 
glad that the talks have been resumed and we must trust that, 
above all, American influence, which is the most important in 
this Middle East peace process, helps to ensure that there is 
decisive progress." 
  Staisch's final question: "It looks as if the interests of 
the Israelis and the Palestinians now coincide more than they 
have ever done before. The Israelis want out of the 
Gaza-Jericho power vacuum. They do not want to push escalation 
any further, they want to withdraw from it, and the Palestinians 
want to take on responsibility very quickly. Ideal conditions 
for a final agreement. Do you share this assessment, which is 
made by many observers?" 
  Kinkel: "Basically, that is how it should be, but the 
Israelis have of course quite considerable security interests. 
That applies particularly to the situation vis-a-vis Syria. 
The Palestinians, on the other hand, would of course like to 
take on as soon as possible responsibilities of their own in 
Jericho and the Gaza Strip. Basically, the interests are the 
same, but there has been too much in the past for things to go 
very quickly now. We hope -- and I think it's a realistic hope 
now -- that things will progress. We should continue to try to 
help 'Arafat, above all now directly in Jericho and the Gaza 
Strip, because he needs support there. The people who believe 
in him, put their hopes in him, who must also agree to the 
political line he takes, must see successes for themselves. 
They must be able to say, yes this peace process brings us 
something personally. If that is not the case we will endanger 
'Arafat's position, which cannot be in our interests. 
  ``Thus, what is important again is a rational stance on both 
sides. We have no direct opportunities to exert influence, but 
nor do the other European countries have a direct involvement. 
It is essentially the Americans' affair. Previously, the 
Russians were far more heavily involved in the region, but those 
times are past. Now it's very much up to the Americans, and we 
must ensure that by means of bilateral, multilateral, and 
economic aid we show above all that we are committed.''

<F P=106> [Report by Axel Hofmann and Guenter Stauch: "Clearing the </F>
Way for It To Be Shot Down"] 
  [Text] A fighter becomes the one being hunted. The 
multinational combat fighter, the Eurofighter 2000, is fighting 
on all fronts. So long as the high-tech plane, which is coveted 
by the military, did not manage to get off the ground, the 
project was criticized by both opponents and supporters. The 
latter targeted the billion-mark project because any delay makes 
the fighter more expensive and thus even more problematic in 
public. 
  Hardly had the new bearer of hope completed its first 
flights 
over Manching in Bavaria, when the jet flew into even worse 
turbulence. For the opposition the first flight, which was two 
years late, was the starting signal to shoot the plane down. 
  Just one day later Walter Kolbow, defense policy spokesman 
of 
the Social Democratic Party [SPD] Bundestag group, called for 
the attack. 
  Surprised by the press release from Deutsche Aerospace 
(Dasa) 
about the successful first flight, the German participant in the 
project declared stubbornly: An SPD-led Federal Government will 
do without a new fighter plane. "A plane that costs 100 million 
German marks [DM] apiece does not fit into the financial policy 
landscape." Furthermore, it has not yet been proven that a new 
combat fighter is needed in the first place. 
  Suddenly the Free Democratic Party [FDP] Bundestag group 
also 
got a bellyache in view of the plane's steep climb into the 
white-blue [Bavarian] sky, after the FDP defense politicians had 
long remained silent about the Eurofighter; the party leaders 
were worried about relations in the coalition. FDP Defense 
Policy Spokesman Juergen Koppelin was the first to break cover 
and note critically that more partners should have been sought 
for the four-nation project (Germany, Britain, Italy, and Spain) 
to keep down costs. 
  Koppelin also attacked the Defense Ministry. At the 
beginning of the week he complained it was outrageous that "at 
no time did the Defense Ministry know exactly what the new 
fighter would cost." 
  The FDP politician is also angry about project partner Dasa: 
"Regarding the cost estimates, I get the feeling that we are 
being cheated by Dasa." Koppelin's suggestion for a solution: 
"We should have a group of neutral experts look into the costs." 
  Such tones are nothing new for Dasa; the reaction is 
therefore rather calm. Spokesman Eckehart Rotter, responsible 
for aviation projects, said: "We do not participate in 
political discussions. The decisions about financing must be 
made by the Defense Ministry." 
  The Ottobrunn headquarters has long adapted itself to 
political interference. Thus, the modern plane flew into heavy 
turbulence even during the stage of development, which almost 
caused it to crash. In the spring of 1992 Defense Minister 
Volker Ruehe (Christian Democratic Union), who at the time had 
just assumed office, cleared the way for the then Fighter 90 to 
be shot down. 
  Industry cried out. Half a year later, however, the "slimmed 
down" version with the stylish name Eurofighter 2000 emerged. 
Dasa chief Juergen Schremmp pulled the thrift version "light 
fighter" out of his pocket. Money was saved regarding radar or 
the possibility of flying 10 targets simultaneously. Air Force 
jargon: The sports plane is coming. 
  Volker Ruehe, still not exactly an ardent supporter of the 
new fighter, lost a few feathers, because he attracted the ire 
of his foreign colleagues, the fans of the fighter, and the 
armament lobbyists among his party colleagues. 
  The metamorphosis of Fighter 90 to Eurofighter 2000 was 
incredible not only in the eyes of the opponents. Many deputies 
and experts think that the renaming is simply cheating. FDP 
security expert Koppelin: "This was and is pure deception." 
  From the very beginning Dasa has been under pressure to 
succeed. With the successful first flight of the German 
prototype DA-01 last Sunday [27 March], the armament corporation 
made points -- just in time before the Bundestag elections in 
October. 
  The Defense Ministry's decision about the acquisition of 140 
planes is to be made in 1995. Before that, however, the 
question of overall costs for serial production must be 
clarified. This is not an easy undertaking in view of the 
threatening red pencil of Finance Minister Theo Waigel, who has 
demanded another DM1.25 billion in savings from the defense 
budget. 
  Dasa provides information about the cost analysis in the 
same 
way as it pursues public relations work for the Eurofighter: 
bit by bit. Spokesman Rotter only reveals: "Our fly-away 
price is DM57.8 million." 
  What he means is the purchase price of the "naked" fighter. 
Dasa does not like to talk about the additional costs for 
maintenance, armament, and personnel. Then -- according to 
security experts -- the new star in the sky will cost up to 
DM130 million.

<F P=106> [Interview with Air Force Inspector Hans-Joerg Kuebart by an </F>
unidentified FOCUS correspondent; place and date not given: 
"The Fighter Is Indispensable"] 
  [Text] [FOCUS] Were you worried about the delays in the 
development of the "Light Fighter?" 
  [Kuebart] The Air Force needs a new fighter plane as of 
2002. The decision about procurement is to be made in 1995. 
Therefore, it is important that there are no delays in the 
development of the new fighter, which would call the date of 
such a decision into question. 
  [FOCUS] Do you need a fighter plane at all? 
  [Kuebart] The fighter plane is an air defense means with 
specific strengths, which other air defense means do not have to 
the same extent. I just mention the particular flexibility, the 
great range, and the speedy deployment of flying air defense. 
In particular in the new air defense concept, which is oriented 
toward area protection and focal points in the future, the 
fighter plane thus becomes an indispensable element. In the 
future, too, a credible and effective air defense will be 
possible only in a construct that unites ground-based and 
air-based weapons systems. 
  [FOCUS] Do you think the procurement of 140 planes is 
sufficient -- particularly with a view to out-of-area missions? 
  [Kuebart] The Bundeswehr needs a modern and efficient 
fighter plane as a successor to the F-4F Phantom to exercise 
German rights of sovereignty in the air space, to make an 
appropriate contribution to the alliance, to sufficiently secure 
the effectiveness of NATO's air defense in Central Europe 
together with the allied armed forces, and to contribute to the 
protection of the allies in crises. The number of planes, which 
has been considerably reduced compared with the original Air 
Force plans, takes the changed security policy conditions into 
consideration. 
  [FOCUS] Will the "thrift" fighter have to be reequipped 
sooner or later? 
  [Kuebart] In the view of the Air Force the operational 
demands on the new fighter plane, which have been changed as a 
result of the reorientation, are acceptable and do not require 
short-term corrections.

<F P=106> [Unattributed report: "Submarines for South Korea Crisis </F>
Area"] 
  [Text] German submarines are to dive under the South 
Korean flag. Despite the escalating crisis between North and 
South Korea, the Federal Government is sticking to the deal it 
decided this year. 
  Bonn has guaranteed 696.36 million marks for three 
submarines, which will probably be built at Nordseewrke in Emden 
and Howaldtswerke-Deutsche Werft AG in Kiel. The Federal 
Government has accepted a basic promise of coverage for another 
52.3 million marks, Economics State Secretary Johann Eekhoff 
announced. Two years ago South Korea was taken off the "H 
country list," which lists all risk countries to which armament 
goods are not to be exported. 
  The Social Democratic Party [SPD] has announced that it will 
put South Korea back on this list of risk countries if it wins 
the Bundestag elections. South Korea was taken off the list 
following pressure from industrial circles. The latest 
developments in the Far East show, however, how wrong this 
decision was, said Elke Leonhard-Schmid, foreign trade 
spokeswoman of the SPD Bundestag group.

<F P=106> [Christian Sturm report: "Beard and Bald Head"] </F>
  [Text] The pictures are slightly blurred. The hand that 
guided the video camera must have shaken, probably from 
excitement. Through the lens the official of the Federal Office 
of Criminal Investigations [BKA] sees RAF [Red Army Faction] 
member Birgit Hogefeld. Beside her walks Klaus Steimetz, 
liaison man of the Office for the Protection of the Constitution. 
  The film was made on 24 June 1993 at Bad Kleinen railroad 
station -- three days before the shoot-out during which RAF 
member Wolfgang Grams and GSG-9 man Michael Newrzella were 
killed. 
  The video tape also shows another couple, who were clearly 
on 
good terms with Hogefeld and Steinmetz. 
  Only after the failed antiterror operation did the BKA start 
a nationwide search for the unknown couple -- exactly at 1850 
hours [1650 GMT]. Too late, the two had long disappeared. 
  Today it is clear that the BKA investigators let slip 
through 
their fingers two people who are linked with the assassination 
of Trust Agency chief Detlef Karsten Rohwedder on 1 April 1991. 
  An internal BKA paper notes soberly: When evaluating the 
video tape, the experts discovered that the man might be the 
unknown person seen during the attack on Rohwedder. 
  Some days before the attack a suspect -- 190 cm tall, 
bearded, and bald -- was observed spying on Rohwedder's villa in 
Duesseldorf from nearby gardens. According to the BKA, this is 
the man filmed in Bad Kleinen chatting with Hogefeld and 
Steinmetz. 
  A so-called covert search is currently under way all over 
the 
country -- so far without the involvement of the media. At the 
beginning of March the BKA sent photos of the unknown couple to 
all police stations, with a warning in bold print: Pay 
particular attention to your own safety! 
  According to information obtained by FOCUS, another 
suspicious couple got in front of the BKA observation group's 
hidden camera on 27 June 1993, five hours before the shoot-out 
at Bad Kleinen railroad station. 
  Only later did it become clear who wanted to meet with 
Hogefeld and Grams there: RAF member Daniela Klette and 
Ernst-Volker Staub, both wanted on an arrest warrant since 1991 
for suspected participation in the attacks on Trust Agency chief 
Rohwedder and State Secretary Hans Neusel. 
  What is embarrassing is that the RAF couple noticed the 
officials and, as the BKA report says, "took photos of them in 
return."

<F P=106> [Dietmar Seher report: "Austerity Measures for the </F>
Military"] 
  [Text] Bonn -- After the privatization of the Postal 
Administration and the Railroads, the Bundeswehr, the largest 
state enterprise, is still left. Numerous employees will have 
to be laid off in the next few years, and several institutions 
will have to be closed down. Resistance has developed to these 
plans. 
  In the middle of an election year, the defense experts of 
the 
Bundestag will have to deal with a explosive document. After 
internal talks among the Bundeswehr leadership, budget and 
defense experts of the parliament in Bonn are to discuss the 
document before the elections in October. The report by 
Luftwaffe General Lorenz Huber might become the basis for a 
major austerity offensive within the Bundeswehr. 
  It is becoming clear that the soldiers might not be the 
"main 
victims." The analysis that the representative for 
rationalization measures, drafted together with economic 
advisers, will hurt the army of civilian employees. The 370,000 
soldiers are currently being supported by 151,000 civilians. 
Moreover, it is still unclear whether the 660 Bundeswehr 
barracks can be maintained. 
  Huber's assumption is as follows: Administration is 
inefficient and highly unproductive in large parts of the armed 
forces. Thus, repairs are being carried out with too many 
personnel. 
  The comprehensive report mentions several critical 
areas: 

  -  Stocks are too large: The arsenals of the 
Bundeswehr are worth 55 billion German marks [DM], with 
ammunition alone involving DM16.5 billion. A total of 70 
percent was not requested in the last two years. 
  -  Expenditure is 
too high: In 1983 operating costs alone amounted to 77 percent 
of the defense budget. They could be reduced by 10 
percent. 
  -  There is too much unproductive employment: A total of 
130,000 people, including 35,000 civilians, are responsible for 
supply and service support. 
  It is becoming clear that deep cuts could be carried out in 
the arsenals of the navy. The auditors believe that the 
workshops could do their jobs with 35 percent fewer people, thus 
saving DM850 million by 2002. In the army, 4,000 jobs might be 
reduced if no new jobs are created for those in repair units. 
In the hangers of the air force [as published] and its stores, 
60 percent of the 3,000 employees would be superfluous if 
industrial yardsticks were applied, the working groups called 
Combat Team Huber at the Bundeswehr found out. 
  A comparison between an air force hanger and Dasa reveals 
the 
following: The enterprise that belongs to the Daimler concern 
works with 50-percent higher productivity and at costs that are 
30 percent lower. 
  One of the major reasons for this deplorable state of 
affairs 
is that there are too many levels -- up to 10 -- of 
responsibility. 
  The working group has not issued any specific 
recommendations 
for the reduction of jobs, which is very difficult to carry out 
anyway: Many civilian positions are held by employees with 
tenure. Moreover, there are firm plans to reduce civilian jobs 
from 19,000 to 13,000. 
  Yet there is always room for more cutbacks: Expenditure on 
education measures (involving over DM2 billion) could be reduced 
considerably if civilian training institutions were also used. 
  As in every civilian enterprise examined by auditors, the 
middle management of the Bundeswehr rejected Huber's proposals 
for cutbacks. Annoyed about reductions concerning other items 
in the defense budget, some generals have refused to cooperate. 
Huber signed the report, handed it over formally, and then 
asked to resign. He claimed he was not receiving sufficient 
support. Defense Minister Volker Ruehe was not exactly happy. 
Huber is to receive a practice-oriented job -- as the head of 
the Procurement Office of the Luftwaffe.

<F P=106> [Unattributed report: "Instigation Against Jews"] </F>
  [Text] According to information obtained by the North 
Rhine-Westphalian Office for the Protection of the Constitution, 
the anti-Semitic attacks by Republikaner Chairman Franz 
Schoenhuber against Ignatz Bubis, chairman of the Central 
Council of Jews in Germany, are part of a systematic campaign. 
Fritz-Achim Baumann, chief of the North Rhine-Westphalian 
Office for the Protection of the Constitution, said that the 
Republikaner are relying on anti-Semitic instigation because, as 
a result of the tightening of the asylum law, the issue of 
foreigners' policy can no longer be used to polarize the 
population, in the view of the right-wing extremists. 
Constitutional Protection knows of so-called sample speeches, 
which "have obviously been formulated by the party's Executive 
Committee." In these speeches representatives of the Jewish 
communities are denounced as "chief German haters." One of 
these sample speeches says that Chancellor Helmut Kohl "put on 
the cap to satisfy Mr. Galinski." Heinz Galinski was Bubis' 
predecessor as chairman of the Central Council of Jews in 
Germany.

  [Text] We Republikaner actively advocate the fundamental 
principles of the liberal-democratic basic system: 

  -  The 
right of the people to exercise state power in elections and 
referendums and through special organs of the legislature, 
executive, and judiciary, and to elect representatives by 
general, direct, free, equal, and secret ballot; 
  -  The linking of 
the legislature with the constitutional system and linking the 
executive power and judiciary with law and order; 
  -  The right to 
education and to exercise parliamentary opposition; 
  -  The 
possibility to replace the government and hold it responsible to 
the people's representatives; 
  -  The independence of the 
courts; 
  -  The exclusion of any kind of rule by force and 
despotism; 
  -  The observance of the human rights that are specified 
in the Basic Law; 
  -  Our community as a social state. 
  We Republikaner advocate a pluralistic rule-of-law state. 
The freedom of the individual is limited where it endangers the 
freedom of others. 
  In order to strengthen and develop our democracy in the 
sense 
of more direct participation by the citizens, we Republikaner 
demand: 

  -  Direct election of the German president by the 
people; 
  -  Submission of constitutional amendments that are adopted 
by the Bundestag to the people for decision 
(referendum); 
  -  Introduction of petitions for a referendum and 
referendums at federal level, on the example of the constitution 
of the Free State of Bavaria; 
  -  Adherence to the principle of 
division of powers. Holders of a political mandate of the 
Bundestag and the landtage may neither hold another paid office 
nor be a member of the management or board of directors of a 
profit-oriented company. This excludes management functions in 
one's own company; 
  -  Prevention of the abuse of state institutions 
by political parties and groups, and a struggle against 
party-book mismanagement in connection with filling posts in 
public administrations; 
  -  Legal obligation of the responsible 
authority to apply within three months to the Federal 
Constitutional Court to ban any party that orders observation of 
another party by means of the intelligence service, and the 
right of a party itself to apply for a ruling on itself being 
banned as soon as it is mentioned in a report by the offices for 
the protection of the constitution; 
  -  In addition to the approval 
of two-thirds of the members of the Bundestag and the Bundesrat, 
an amendment to the Basic Law requires majority approval within 
the framework of a referendum.

<F P=106> [Report on conversation with Otto Schlecht, chairman of the </F>
Ludwig Erhard Foundation, by Heinz Heck: "`The Economy Is 
Waiting for Something Concrete'"] 
  [Text] Bonn--The SPD [Social Democratic Party of Germany] 
has stopped at the halfway point in its effort to free itself 
from the stigma of the party of redistribution and to 
demonstrate economic competence. These are comments by Otto 
Schlecht, chairman of the Ludwig Erhard Foundation and long-time 
undersecretary in the Ministry of Economics, on the SPD's latest 
tax plans in a conversation with DIE WELT. Schlecht appeals to 
the coalition and the opposition to improve the basic tax 
provisions in the interest of international 
competitiveness--thus to reduce the tax burden--and recommends 
as a "second best solution." tax preferences for risk-intensive 
tangible assets. 
  "Growth and jobs must come before redistribution and 
increases in income. Businesses have to be confident that they 
will not be burdened excessively," Schlecht suggests. For 1994 
and 1995 the per capita tax load is moving toward 50 percent. 
"That is statism. We have not only reached the end of the flag 
pole; we have to go back to the 45 percent of 1989." We have to 
make room for spending through energetic savings. In this 
connection, he accused the government of "political inaction." 
  Both sides, the coalition and the SPD, have not yet detailed 
their future tax policy. "But this is urgently necessary. The 
economy is waiting for this." The government should stipulate a 
time limit for the solidarity surcharge and not pass any new tax 
increases. 
  Schlecht makes a fundamental distinction between the 
coalition's solidarity surcharge and the SPD's special levy. 
From the government's viewpoint, the solidarity surcharge of 7.5 
percent of the tax liability is "a necessary evil, an emergency 
measure for a few years." The SPD, however, wants the 10-percent 
special levy to be "permanent" as a social instrument of 
redistribution. 
  If 25 percent of the tax payers paid 70 percent of the wage 
and personal income tax, there could be no talk of a "fairness 
gap." To prevent any further transfer of jobs abroad, we have to 
level the tax differences with respect to European and other 
competitors by reducing the profits tax rates and eliminating 
taxes unrelated to profits (industrial capital tax and 
industrial property tax). 
  If this "best solution" does not meet with success owing to 
a 
lack of votes in the Bundesrat, Schlecht recommends as the 
"second best solution" tax preferences for risk capital--not 
only for corporate profits. "We have a lack of risk capital for 
new investments." There should also be more and more examples of 
employee participation in investments (participation wages). 
Management and labor are chiefly to blame for the fact that this 
"has never worked" in the past, he says. "We need a moderate 
wage policy for years to come."

<F P=106> [Interview with Antje Vollmer, top-ranked Alliance 90/Greens </F>
Bundestag candidate for Hesse, by Eva Grosskinsky and Herbert 
Weber; place and date not given: "`Armies Are Still Needed'"] 
  [Text] Antje Vollmer: 
  1943--Born in Luebbecke, Westphalia. 
  1973--Earned a doctorate in theology. Minor in adult 
education. 
  1984--Elected as caucus spokesperson for the Greens in the 
Bundestag. In 1990 turned down another candidacy for delegate. 
  1994--Running as top-ranked candidate for the Bundestag on 
the Hesse land slate. 
  [FOCUS] Ms. Vollmer, after four years you are returning to 
big politics like Phoenix from the ashes. Why? 
  [Vollmer] People have always known that I love politics. And 
Phoenix from the ashes--it was more precisely the rotation 
decisions of the Greens that applied in my case. 
  [FOCUS] What does the Alliance 90/Greens need that you can 
provide? 
  [Vollmer] In their initial phase, the Greens had an 
unbelievably large number of concepts and ideas from artists and 
intellectuals, universities and churches. I believe I am 
especially able to tie these threads together again, to 
remobilize lost confidence. 
  [FOCUS] What are Antje Vollmer's political requirements? 
  [Vollmer] A fundamental reform plan that will reach to the 
end of the millennium has to have at least three themes: a 
peaceful order in Europe linked with a liberal immigration law. 
Domestically, the central theme is a "cultural revolution of 
labor." We need a reassessment of labor and a just distribution 
of jobs. The third is an ecological tax reform. 
  [FOCUS] That will affect people's wallets: trash taxes, 
commercial traffic taxes, an increase in petroleum taxes. Hubert 
Kleinert has calculated that that would cost a teacher an 
additional 1,000 marks a month. How can you sell that in these 
times of crisis? 
  [Vollmer] The general consensus holds that times of crisis 
like these make people feel insecure and that society 
instinctively moves to the right. I feel differently: Precisely 
in these times of crisis, the middle classes of society trust 
those who can offer them a real reform debate. I think the gut 
feeling among these classes is that things cannot go on this 
way. The question is simply this: Do we put the burden on those 
now living or do we put the burden on the next generation? 
  [FOCUS] The fact is, however, that the Greens, because of 
their party congress decision on the dissolution of NATO, for 
example, are still considered a threat to security and not 
capable of forming a coalition. Shouldn't the party congress 
have made some headway? 
  [Vollmer] In the economic and social policy areas and with 
regard to immigration legislation, we have taken a giant step 
forward. But not in foreign policy. There we have not found the 
argument that will persuade the party in its identity. The 
Greens are pacifists. But we are not yet clearly aware that 
pacifism has redefined itself following the Cold War. It must be 
made clear to the party: A pacifist is someone who does not take 
up arms; but pacifist policy is one that ensures that no one 
takes up arms. To this end, unfortunately, we still need police 
and armies. 
  [FOCUS] We really cannot blame Rudolf Scharping if he 
doesn't 
want anything to do with red-green--with maximum demands like 
abandoning nuclear power, dissolving the Bundeswehr. Is all this 
concessions to the party Left? 
  [Vollmer] In passionate struggles over the years, we have 
learned that we have to build a consensus between the wings of 
the party. Everyone made mistakes there in the past, including 
me. We would do well not to give up on this compromise any more. 
And then there are debates over the pace of changes. Here I 
belong to those who would like to see a speedy development. But 
that is not a rejection of compromise. 
  [FOCUS] How do you propose to help the left wing reach 
coalition compromises? 
  [Vollmer] Let's look at this in practical terms: Members of 
the left wing took part in the government of Lower Saxony. And 
Gerhard Schroeder gave them high marks for constructive 
politics--even saying that he was able to get his industrial 
policy through. At the same time, there is the example of the 
environmental and social policy of the Realos in Hesse. Thus two 
instances of participation in government by the Greens. Both are 
good examples of reliability and constructiveness. 
  [FOCUS] Do you think the SPD [Social Democratic Party of 
Germany] under Scharping is capable of sharing your reform plan? 
  [Vollmer] I think the SPD is capable of that. But I don't 
think it is capable of carrying the debate forward in a 
sufficiently decisive manner. As far as Scharping is concerned, 
my original assessment has changed somewhat. Precisely because 
he is not so conceited, I believe that he needs to consider 
himself the ideological mind of the reforms, that he is 
dependent upon the dialogical nature of politics. This could 
offer us a chance. 
  [FOCUS] Wouldn't it be more logical to concentrate on 
opposition politics? 
  [Vollmer] We are trying for participation in government 
because we, most of all, have the power as the draft horse of 
reforms. As far as the role of opposition is concerned, we don't 
have to prove any longer that we can do that. But opposition 
over the long term is also a dumb thing. Instances of the 
Greens' participation in government and administration on all 
levels were always growth spurts in the Greens' development 
program. 
  [FOCUS] There was a lot of talk at the election convention 
about your program, but not about names. Do you have enough 
manpower? 
  [Vollmer] In contrast to the FDP [Free Democratic Party], 
with its lack of manpower, the Greens can fall back on all the 
extraparliamentary reform manpower going back 25 years in 
Federal Republic, as well as on the civil rights activists in 
the east. 
  [FOCUS] With what team could the Greens move into a 
government? 
  [Vollmer] Something has taken place over the past four years 
which gives even me, who had meanwhile become very resigned, the 
impression that this is a different party. I can only explain 
this as a result of the need to adjust to the new issues coming 
out of the east. What is important here is that those who helped 
most to bring about this change will not disappear. 
  [FOCUS] Joschka Fischer has chosen you as the prominent 
figurehead for the Greens. That could change following critical 
reports concerning your naive attitude toward the SED [Socialist 
Unity Party of Germany]. 
  [Vollmer] The Greens always held this position toward the 
GDR: Maintain contacts with the opposition above all, but--to 
the extent possible and necessary--with the government as well. 
I can't imagine what could be wrong with that. I find a bit 
naive all those who think that we could have talked, thought, 
and acted in 1983 or 1984 like we do now, 10 years later. 
Neither Mr. Kohl nor Mr. Schaeuble nor the wise Egon Bahr were 
able to do that. How much less, then, the Greens. I readily 
admit that this is not sufficiently apparent from today's 
viewpoint. But it is simply not true that anything was covered 
up here. The SED leadership was greatly interested in 
influencing the left-wing organizations, the peace movement, and 
thus also the Greens. It didn't succeed, for the Greens' 
structures were such that they were not at all predictable for 
this kind of long-term influence.

<F P=106> [Article by Barbara Gillmann: "On the Team of Institutes, </F>
the DIW in Berlin Plays Left Wing--The German Institute for 
Economic Research"] 
  [Text] Berlin--The minister for economics calls it "that 
socialist institute in Berlin." The president of the Bundesbank 
is annoyed by that "bunch of political activists." The German 
Institute for Economic Research, the DIW, is viewed as being on 
the far Left among the empirical economic research institutes. 
Just the same, DIW President Lutz Hoffmann cannot complain about 
a lack of research jobs. 
  The reason for Economics Minister Guenter Rexrodt's friendly 
slap at the DIW was that the institute registered a dissenting 
opinion in the fall report by the six economic research 
institutes. The other five prophesied a GDP growth rate of 1 
percent in western Germany for 1994 whereas the Berlin institute 
is still holding to its forecast of a 0.5 percent decline to 
this day. The reason the institute gave for its conclusions was 
that the interest structure is skewed in that short-term 
interest rates exceed long-term interest rates and that interest 
rates generally are still too high. 
  Hoffmann, 59, says that the disagreement is not political 
but 
"about basics." Uncertainty about when the upturn will occur is 
a "very delicate situation" for all economic researchers. Under 
similar circumstances in 1992 the Institute for World Economics 
(IfW) dissented from the majority in the spring and the 
Rhine-Westphalian Institute for Economic Research (RWI) 
dissented in the fall. 
  The DIW, Hoffmann says, is the only institute which compiles 
overall economic data on a quarterly basis. On this basis, "we 
believe we have a slightly greater sensitivity" for the 
mechanics of the economy. 
  From a political point of view the institute continues to 
pay 
tribute to the Keynesian, demand-oriented approach but the 
spectrum of opinions "has broadened," the advantage being that 
there are frequent "vehement discussions." 
  In spite of its sometimes unpleasant findings, e.g. the 
early 
warning of large-scale unemployment in eastern Germany, the 
institute's clients limit their critique to snide remarks. "We 
are not discriminated against when it comes to requests for 
expert opinions," Hoffmann says. 
  The DIW also is skeptical with regard to the debate over 
Germany's viability as an industrial base. The institute's 
economic divison reached the conclusion that there is "no sign 
of a structural or cost crisis" in western Germany and that 
findings for western and eastern Germany are being mixed 
together "in inadmissible fashion" in public debate. Hoffmann 
would like to get away from the "hackneyed wage cost debate" by 
designing an indicator for technological competitiveness. By 
this fall this approach is to answer the question of whether the 
United States and Japan "have or have not outdistanced" Germany 
as an industrial power. 
  In 1925, Ernst Wagemann, the president of the Reich 
Statistical Office, founded the "Institute for Economic 
Research." The institute received its present name in 1941. At 
the end of 1993 it had a staff of 215, including 100 social 
scientists, 61 of whom hold a doctorate. 
  Lutz Hoffmann has headed the institute since 1989. His 
father 
already worked on empirical economic research as a unversity 
professor. Hoffmann himself went into industry initially but 
when Herbert Giersch offered him a position as a university 
lecturer in 1963 he decided that "this might be something I 
could do for a while." 
  He stayed with it and became a professor, acting as an 
advisor to the prime minister of Malaysia and the World Bank. He 
also worked on developing countries, energy issues and 
international economic relations. In 1988, he was offered the 
presidency of two highly respected economic research institutes 
at once: the DIW and the Institute for Economic Research in 
Hamburg (HWWA). He chose the Berlin post, replacing Hans-Juergen 
Krupp. The president's job also includes a professorship in 
economics at the Free University in Berlin. 
  At this time, the DIW has nine divisions: public sector, 
economy, structural research, Berlin-Brandenburg, world trade, 
industry and technology, East Europe, transportation, energy and 
raw materials. 
  Since 1983 the researchers have polled the same households 
which make up the "socioeconomic panel" (SOEP) once a year 
regarding occupation, income, expenses as well as their 
satisfaction with their own economic situation. Hoffmann says 
that this "longitudinal survey" which has included the new 
laender as of 1990 is unique for Germany. He is also proud of 
the fact that U.S. Nobel Prize winner Gary Becker uses the SOEP 
data. 
  The Berlin institute reports on its work in its weekly 
reports. A selection from these reports is published in a 
monthly English-language ECONOMIC BULLETIN. In addition, the 
institute publishes a quarterly and the annals of structural 
research. 
  Over the past several years the DIW annual budget has 
steadily grown to 30 million German marks (DM). Along with the 
Institute for World Economic Research in Kiel, the Berlin 
institute has the biggest budget of the six institutes which put 
out their joint economic report. The DIW earned DM13 million 
from its economic studies, thus almost equaling the Munich Ifo 
Institute's third-party revenue, i.e. 42 and 43 percent 
respectively. 
  Hoffmann has no intention of further increasing the 
percentage of outside contracts. Because of the government 
subsidy for the institute premises, the institutes are permitted 
to add no more than a 33-percent surcharge to their personnel 
costs in order to cover other costs. In other words, if research 
reports made up a greater percentage of income, less money would 
be available for basic research such as the National Economic 
Report or the calculation of capital stock. "We are not flexible 
enough" to obtain more lucrative contracts from the private 
sector, Hoffmann says. 
  As at all other institutes, the DIW staff is paid according 
to civil service rates. Even if staff members were prepared to 
work 60 hours a week on a short-term basis, Hoffmann "could not 
legally" pay the corresponding salaries. 
  Subsidies from the Federal Government and the land of Berlin 
totaled DM15.97 million in 1993 and DM16.12 million in 1994. The 
remaining funds come from membership fees to the DIW (which is a 
registered association) and the Society of Friends of the 
Institute chaired by Daimler-Benz board chairman Edazrd Reuter. 
  As is the case with all six of the institutes, the DIW's 
principal client is the economics minister even though his share 
of the research reports has gone down to between 15 and 20 
percent which Hoffmann says is due to increased competition, 
e.g. from Prognos AG, Basel and, increasingly, private 
management consultants. Other clients include various additional 
ministries both at the federal and the land level as well as the 
EU. Occasionally, foundations, labor unions, and industrial 
firms have also commissioned DIW studies. 
  Every "two or three years" some client will want to keep 
research findings from being made public. The Berlin Senat, for 
example, asked for a study on the financial implications of a 
merger between Berlin and Brandenburg. Permission to make the 
study public which is a formality as a rule was "quietly 
refused," Hoffmann says. Why? "Because a merger would be a 
financial disaster for Berlin." 
  In 1993, the DIW launched a study on potential population 
and 
economic trends in Germany up to the year 2000. On behalf of the 
minister for economics it is regularly preparing joint reports 
with the Kiel IfW on the situation in Russia and Belarus and on 
progress in eastern Germany. 
  The Korean Development Institute of South Korea has asked 
the 
DIW to look into the question of what lessons divided Korea can 
learn from German unification. The study has not yet been 
completed but Hoffmann is already in a position to say that if 
there is a chance for Korean unification, monetary union should 
be the final step in the process. At the outset trade should be 
liberalized and North Korea should be opened for South Korean 
investment. As a "low-wage backwater," the North would then have 
"enormous opportunities to catch up." The precondition for any 
such development, however, would be that "the political freedom 
to move in that direction would be guaranteed." 
  Looking to the future, Hoffmann expects demand for 
long-range 
scenarios on ecological issues. The DIW is working on a study 
for Greenpeace, for example, which focuses on the impact an 
ecological tax reform would have on the economy. Above all, 
Hoffmann says, development in the new laender "will keep us busy 
for another 10 or 20 years."

<F P=106> [Article by Barbara Gillmann: "The Researchers in the Ruhr </F>
Are Also Concerned About Air Pollution in China--The 
Rhine-Westphalian Institute for Economic Research"] 
  [Text] Duesseldorf, 28 Feb--The government is short on 
funds; the German research market has gotten tighter. Even the 
Rhine-Westphalian Institute for Economic Research (RWI) in 
Essen, the smallest of the empirical economic research 
institutes in the old laender, can feel the pinch. 
  "At the moment there are many good researchers to be had on 
the market, so you really feel bad about not having the money," 
says Paul Klemmer, the RWI's president. There is no denying it: 
the situation is getting tighter. The basic subsidy granted to 
the institutes by the Federal Government and the host land 
increases only nominally. In fact, the RWI got less this year 
than the year before. 
  This is why Klemmer is looking for solutions 
internationally--in keeping with the recommendation of the 
Scientific Advisory Council composed of representatives of the 
Federal Government, the laender, and science which sets the 
guidelines for the German research community. One of the plans 
being drawn up is a cooperative venture with China, financed by 
the Federal Government. The RWI is to provide the Chinese with 
know-how on preventing carbon dioxide emissions. In exchange, 
Klemmer hopes to obtain data about the PRC "which is not 
normally available." 
  In Poland, Hungary, the Czech Republic, and Slovakia an RWI 
team is looking into the chances for the middle class. In the 
case of on-site studies, the RWI researchers work jointly with 
local institutes. But before they do they must "separate the 
wheat from the chaff," Klemmer says in describing the 
difficulties in determining who is who in research in Central 
Europe. Klemmer's researchers cannot rely on already available 
data. "You might as well burn" the statistical material, he says. 
  The Advisory Council would like to see the institutes 
increase the amount outside clients spend on research. This 
includes all the money earned from studies commissioned by 
public sector agencies and business firms. The total RWI budget 
for 1992 was 9.04 million German marks (DM). Outside commissions 
accounted for DM2.4 million or 26 percent and in 1993 the 
third-party share rose to 28 percent. 
  Like the other institutes on the so-called blue list, the 
RWI 
receives a basic subsidy. That subsidy which increased from 
DM6.07 million in 1992 to DM7.29 million in 1993 was cut 3.3 
percent this year to DM7.06 million. Income from membership fees 
(the RWI is a nonprofit organization), publications, and rentals 
accounts for about 6 percent of the total. 
  Third-party research projects raise problems for Klemmer in 
personnel planning. Currently, the RWI has a staff of 72, of 
which 40 are professionals. The better the researchers, the 
longer the contracts Klemmer must offer them. If he operates on 
a tight budget, personnel costs which account for about 70 
percent of the total budget force him to "chase after every 
contract" even if it does not fit into his research portfolio. 
Klemmer does gain some flexibility by farming out occasional 
research projects to university professors. 
  The economics ministry in Bonn is the RWI's principal 
client. 
In 1993, it paid the RWI DM440,000 for its work on the joint 
economic forecast alone. The ministry's total RWI research 
contracts amount to almost DM1.8 million. 
  One particular RWI niche is regional economic analysis. 
Klemmer believes that this is the direction in which the 
industrial base debate will go. These days the question no 
longer is whether an investor can be lured to Great Britain or 
Germany. Competition now is more among regions or large cities 
such as Frankfurt or Milan. Researchers have looked into 
regional opportunities for Baden-Wurttemberg, the city of 
Muenster and the Bernau area. Klemmer considers it "exciting" 
that hard factors such as geographic location account for only 
30 to 40 percent of the attractiveness of a given region. As for 
the rest, it is the region's image that counts--which is hard to 
alter. 
  As far as regional research is concerned, the RWI team can 
draw on the institute's past experience. Although the RWI 
celebrated its 50th anniversary in May 1993 it was really 
founded in 1926 by Ernst Wagemann, the president of the 
then-Berlin Institute for Economic Research (today's German 
Institute for Economic Research) and was then known as that 
institute's "Western Department." 
<H5>  Most Departments Work on Environmental Economics </H5>
  Situated in the center of the Ruhr region, the institute's 
principal emphasis was on coal, iron, and steel. When it became 
an independent institute in 1943 the RWI began to concern itself 
with extraregional issues as well. Since 1978 the Essen 
institute has been issuing reports on economic structure in 
rotation with the other research institutes. 
  In 1988/89 the RWI gained negative publicity when the board 
of directors was accused of tax fraud. At that time, Horst 
Siebert was set to take the place of RWI President Hans Karl 
Schneider but eventually decided in favor of the Institute for 
World Economics in Kiel. In early 1989 Paul Klemmer took over as 
head of the RWI. Klemmer, 58, an expert in regional economics, 
brought his specialty to the RWI from his professorship for 
economic policy at Bochum's Ruhr University, a chair he still 
holds today. A native of Freiburg, Klemmer characterizes his 
political outlook as "pragmatic liberalism." 
  Like Siebert, he is interested in environmental economics 
which has a bearing on the activities of all eight RWI 
departments. Klemmer would like to see the other institutes to 
"stand up and be counted" on the ecology issue. As for the RWI 
itself, he calls it "not really tax friendly," taking a rather 
dim view of ecology-oriented tax reform. 
  One traditional focus of RWI's interest are the crafts. The 
institute has put out an annual report on that sector of the 
economy since 1954. In addition, it regularly publishes the RWI 
Economic Reports and Economic News.

<F P=106> [Article by Barbara Gillmann: "Economic Forecasts From the </F>
Firth--The Institute for World Economics in Kiel"] 
  [Text] Bonn's economic political leaders depend on the 
analyses and forecasts of the research institutes. Especially in 
times rife with economic problems the "council of researchers" 
gains added importance. The Institute of World Economics (IfW) 
in Kiel is Germany's oldest economic research institute and 
probably the best known internationally. 
  Whenever Horst Siebert cannot think of anything new he looks 
out the window. The view is stimulating indeed: from the second 
floor of the former Imperial Yacht Club one can see large 
tankers and small yachts go by on Kiel's Foerde. Since April 
1989 Siebert, an economics professor, has headed the Kiel 
Institute of World Economics, the oldest economic research 
institute in Germany and perhaps the best known internationally. 
  In the almost five years since Siebert took over from his 
predecessor, Herbert Giersch, the annual reports have been 
getting more voluminous and the number of researchers has 
increased from 75 to 92. Siebert himself, who both heads the IfW 
and holds a professorship of economics at Kiel University, is 
viewed as one of the first social scientists to treat economic 
and enviromental issues as a unit. In addition, numerous 
publications of his have been devoted to international economic 
relations and foreign trade. 
  In the past four years the IfW has shifted the focus of its 
research on the economic side of German unification as well as 
on the question of how planned economies can be turned into 
market economies and be integrated into the world market. From 
time to time as many as 20 researchers in different IfW 
departments are working on various aspects of this historic 
transformation, Siebert says. 
  The media accused him in this connection of "muscling in 
everywhere." But that does not faze the 55-year-old professor 
who has also been a member of the council of experts for the 
assessment of overall economic development since 1991. Of course 
"we jumped on this issue," says Siebert, who has written a book 
entitled Das Wagnis der Einheit--Eine 
wirtschaftspolitische Therapie [The Risk of Unification--An 
Economic Policy Therapy]. Scientists have to be enthusiasts 
because "one simply does not move without an impetus." What is 
more, "we are in the midst of competition and look upon new 
issues as challenges." 
  The public sector is the IfW's principal client. The 
Economics Ministry in Bonn alone commissioned research studies 
in 1993 worth 1.287 million German marks (DM). Some of these 
studies will occupy the researchers until 1995. 
  In addition to collaborating on joint research projects 
which 
six different institutions prepare each spring and fall the IfW 
is working on the "Main Report Within the Framework of Reporting 
on Structure" which the institutes submit in annual rotation. 
  At the end of 1993, the IfW produced the ninth report on 
"Overall Economic and Managerial Progress in Adaptation in 
Eastern Germany" in collaboration with the German Institute for 
Economic Research (DIW) in Berlin and the Institute for Economic 
Research in Halle (IWH), the 1992 successor to the East Berlin 
Institute for Applied Economic Research. From the middle of 1993 
to the middle of 1995 these reports will cost the economics 
minister DM1.535 million. DM625,200 of the total will go to the 
IfW, DM645,000 to the DIW, and DM264,700 to the IWH. 
  It was not the institutes themselves, Siebert says, that 
wanted to collaborate but the express wish of the Economics 
Ministry. The "basic idea, however, was that they should compete 
with one another," he adds. 
  Aside from the government, the institute receives major 
funding from foundations, e.g. from the Bertelsmann Foundation 
which has commissioned a multiyear study on "the future outlook 
for the social market economy." As part of the study the 
institute's researchers are investigating issues such as ethics 
and the marketplace, international rules on competition, 
management, and motivation as well as the connections between 
the ecology and the economics of the marketplace. 
  "The project hopes to determine how the market economy will 
legitimize itself in the future in view of the fact that the 
collapse of the socialist planned economies has robbed it of its 
counterpart," Siebert says. The aim is to find out what 
incentives will be required in the future in order to maintain 
the efficiency of the market economy in the absence of 
competition with the planned economy model. 
  The Volkswagen Foundation has commissioned a study of 
eastern 
Central Europe and the Baltic region. The EU commission has also 
become one of the institute's major clients. This part of the 
institute's business can still be expanded, Siebert says. The 
IfW's well-known critical stand on protectionist trends and a 
rapid monetary integration of the EU places more or less natural 
limits on expanded cooperation with Brussels, he adds. 
  In 1993, the studies commissioned by the Economics Ministry, 
land ministries, foundations, and the EU have earned the IfW 
DM4.12 million. Given a total budget of DM29.7 million, this 
adds up to a third-client quotient of 14 percent. Compared to 
other institutes--particularly to the Ifo Institute for Economic 
Research in Munich--this is a very small ratio. 
  Basic subsidies from the Economics Ministry last year 
amounted to DM11.377 million. The institute received the same 
amount from the land government of Schleswig-Holstein. 
  The IfW spends a good two-fifths of its budget on the 
Central 
Library of Economics--an added expense but more than worth it 
from the standpoint of prestige. The IfW library numbering 
almost 2.3 volumes and occupying about 25 miles of shelf space 
is the most important economics library in Germany. It also 
contains Econis, a 500,000-title database on economics 
literature. 
  The IfW grew out of the political science seminar of Kiel 
University. In 1914, Prof Bernhard Harms founded the IfW under 
the then-name of "Koenigliches Institut fuer Seeverkehr und 
Weltwirtschaft" [Royal Institute for Maritime Affairs and World 
Economy]. In the twenties, the inflation-plagued citizens of 
Kiel referred to it merely as "sehr verkehrte Weltwirtschaft" 
[the "upside-down world economy" institute]. 
  Today, the IfW has a staff of 341, of whom 120 work in the 
institute's five research departments: growth and structural 
policy, resource economics, regional and transportation 
economics, developing countries and world economy, economic 
trends. The institute's regular publications include KIELER 
STUDIEN [KIEL STUDIES], WELTWIRTSCHAFTLICHES ARCHIV [ARCHIVES OF 
WORLD ECONOMY], DIE WELTWIRTSCHAFT [WORLD ECONOMY], and KIELER 
DISKUSSIONSBEITRAEGE [KIEL DISCUSSION PAPERS]. 
  For the past 10 years the institute has been offering a 
one-year advanced study program in international economic policy 
research for young economists. The faculty is made up primarily 
of practical economists of international standing. The entire 
program is conducted in English. Some of the graduates stay on 
at the IfW, Siebert says. "But the World Bank grabs them up so 
fast and we can't compete with it."

<F P=106> [Article by Claude Angeli: "Our American Friends Want to </F>
Steal Iraq From Us?"] 
  [Text] The object of one of the least-known episodes in the 
Washington- Paris quarrel is the conquest of the future Iraqi 
market, the reconstruction of the country's infrastructures, 
and, above all, oil exploitation. 
  Following a long period of sickly timidity--relations with 
Saddam Husayn are bad memories on the Right and on the 
Left--Paris has awakened, no doubt because it noticed the 
Baghdad comings and goings of companies from the United States, 
Japan and other countries. 
  The first sign came in mid-October 1993. Always enamored of 
foreign policy, [Interior Minister] Charles Pasqua decided to 
stop discreet contacts. He organized--and [Prime Minister] 
Edouard Balladur did not object--the Paris visit of Tariq `Aziz, 
deputy prime minister of Iraq. A police team piloted him, 
protected him, and even took him to Pasqua. As a result, the 
Foreign Ministry, where the interior minister's incursions into 
official or secret diplomacy are not appreciated, decided that 
overture must be the game to play. 
  All the more so since the Elysee [president's office] and 
the Matignon [prime minister's office] approved of the 
invitation transmitted by the Elf and Total oil companies to a 
delegation of Iraqi oilmen. On 26 February of this year, these 
Iraqi experts, with whom the two French companies have been 
discreetly negotiating the exploitation of two huge oil deposits 
in the Majnun islands and in `Nahr Umar for the past three 
years, arrived in Paris. 
  Insisting that the meetings are symbolic, Jean-Bernard 
Merimee often meets with his UN counterpart, the Iraqi Nizar 
Hamdun. Finally, on 4 March, a Saddam emissary, Riad al-Qaysi, 
was officially received at the Foreign Ministry, and an Iraqi 
parliamentary delegation is slated in principle to visit Paris 
in a few weeks. 
  The virtuous explanation: the French Government is 
interpreting UN resolutions "juridically" and wants the embargo 
against Iraq be lifted soon, an initiative Washington opposes. 
  The U.S. position is cynical and makes for good policy. A 
high official of an Iraqi ministry summarized it as follows to a 
French businessman: "The Americans are telling us: open your 
markets to us, sign contracts with us and our oilmen, and the 
embargo will be lifted." 
  For a long time now, Baghdad has become a salon where 
American is spoken. Chevron and Occidental Petroleum are 
interested in the same oil "sponges" as Elf and Total. Bechtel 
is interested in petroleum engineering, ATT is eyeing Iraqi 
telephones--to Alcatel's irritation--and in the automobile 
sector, Chrysler is poised to enter the race. 
  Iraq is not the only battlefield. In Saudi Arabia, the 
Americans are glorifying their support for the Bosnian Muslims 
and Boeing is ahead of Airbus--Clinton made a point of 
announcing it personally!--even if the contract was supposed to 
be shared. The same is happening in Kuwait and Abu Dhabi, where 
Washington is pressuring the emir to reduce the order for 390 
Leclerc tanks and purchase Apache helicopters rather than the 
French Super-Pumas or Tigers. 
  This is a generalized offensive, and everything is done to 
discredit the competition. Hence the attempt by French 
intelligence to monitor the commercial field and to identify 
French and other "friends" of the Americans in these complicated 
games. According to French intelligence, "what the Americans 
want is for the only arms industry offering a complete range of 
materiel that they do not control to disappear." 
  And, if necessary, prices are lowered. In Pakistan, American 
F-16's are offered for $10 million less than the Mirage 
2OOO-5's, and the F-18's for $15 million less in Malaysia. 
  Warlike consumers will not complain.

<F P=106> [Article signed H.M.: "Mitterrand and Balla Ask Elf To </F>
Cooperate With the Germans"] 
  [Text] A moving scene in the world of business on 25 
February in a discreet waiting room at the Dusseldorf airport. 
The boss of the Elf oil company meets with Birgit Breuel, the 
boss of Treuhand, the group responsible for the privatization of 
industry in the former East Germany. 
  The Frenchman tells the German of his intention to renege on 
the construction of a gigantic refinery, a 15 billion-franc 
project launched by Philippe Jaffre's predecessor, Loik Le 
Floch-Prigent. Jaffre explains that he no longer believes the 
refinery can be profitable given the collapse of oil prices. 
According to the gossip going around, he thinks that Elf funds 
would be much more use fully invested in the large groups 
privatized by [Prime Minister Edouard] Balladur. 
  Reacting to Jaffre's remarks, Birgit Breuel brandishes the 
draft of a letter denouncing the irregularities that, in her 
view, occurred during the privatization of Elf. She threatens to 
send a copy of the letter to the French commission on stock 
exchange operations and to its U.S. counterpart, the Securities 
Exchange Commission (SEC), if Jaffre does not start work on the 
project on 28 February, as envisioned in the contract. 
  Three days later, surprise surprise, Jaffre receives a 
notably less acrimonious missive containing no more threats of 
denunciation. As for German officials, they affirm they will do 
everything possible to avoid the worst, that is, demanding from 
Elf the 5 billion franc-indemnity envisioned in case of 
non-compliance with the contract. 
  What happened after the stormy meeting at the airport that 
made the Germans soft-pedal the issue? The deal had almost 
become an affair of state. Chancellor Kohl, who expected that 
the refinery would symbolize his policy of maintaining 
employment in the former East Germany, was furious. At the 
Elysee, Francois Mitterrand's advisers contended that Elf's exit 
would complicate the already deteriorating Franco-German 
relations. And at the Matignon [office of the prime minister], 
Ambroise Roux, one of the old "justices of the peace" for 
management, had asked Balladur to compel Jaffre to respect his 
obligations, because French credibility was at stake. 
  Fortunately, the Germans understood they would not easily 
find someone to replace Elf, given the drop in oil prices. 
  Therefore, in early March, the Elf boss received a second 
letter from Germany granting him another postponement. According 
to the PETROSTRATEGTES magazine, the French company now has 
until 30 April to lay the cornerstone. And a Russian oil 
company, Rosneft, has promised to participate in the project to 
the tune of 20 percent by furnishing crude oil. 
  Between oilmen, it is perhaps normal to pay in liquid.

<F P=106> [Interview with Jean-Yves Haberer, dismissed Credit National </F>
president and former president of Credit Lyonnais, by Gaetan de 
Capele and Dominique Mariette; place and date not given: "The 
Government Was Perfectly Aware of the Situation When It 
Appointed Me"] 
  [Text] [LA TRIBUNE DESFOSSES] Yesterday the government 
dismissed you from your position as president of Credit 
National. What is your reaction? 
  [Haberer] I was very surprised at this sudden change. In 
November 1993, the prime minister asked me repeatedly to take on 
the presidency of Credit National, and wrote to me that: "The 
government wishes to call on you to preside over this 
establishment. This is an important mission for a person who is 
capable of guiding Credit National in the future." This affair 
brings together all the elements characteristic of an abuse of 
power because the state, which does not hold one share in Credit 
National, has nothing to rebuke me for in my management at the 
head of this bank. It accords itself the power to punish the 
head of one bank for reasons which are to found in another. This 
is the first time such a thing has happened and could constitute 
an interesting case of jurisprudence for the Council of State. 
I ask myself: Was not my fate sealed from the time of my 
appointment? All this is unseemly. Credit National is a 
prestigious business, with an outstanding team, and it is 
regrettable that the state should interfere in its management 
because of the political climate. This demonstrates a harmful 
lack of concern for this 100-percent privately owned company 
which, in the competitive world in which it lives, needs 
stability. 
  [LA TRIBUNE DESFOSSES] What reasons have you been given for 
your dismissal? 
  [Haberer] When I asked for explanations, I was told that 
media pressure on Credit Lyonnais was such that I should 
withdraw from Credit National. I find this very worrying for 
democracy and for the government's authority. Another 
explanation I was given was that Credit Lyonnais' losses were 
higher than the public authorities thought. This is wrong. 
Before succeeding me, Jean Peyrelevade carried out an audit and 
wrote to the prime minister informing him of the bank's 
situation and of the provisions which would have to be set up. 
On the day the government appointed me, it was perfectly aware 
of this situation. Moreover the results published last week 
conform exactly with those announced in that letter. 
  [LA TRIBUNE DESFOSSES] What is your reaction to Credit 
Lyonnais' results and its restructuring plan? 
  [Haberer] It is an excellent plan. For me, Jean Peyrelevade 
is a skillful negotiator who has defended the bank's interests 
to the best of his ability, and I would never have been able to 
obtain as much as he has from the government. With hindsight, I 
also tell myself that I should have used the same method on my 
arrival at Credit Lyonnais in 1988. At that time, the shortfall 
in provisions for risks was higher than the bank's shareholders' 
equity. If I had put Credit Lyonnais into the red, I would later 
have been considered a savior. But I took a different approach, 
by gradually making good this lack of provisions and by 
strengthening the bank's equity through financial operations 
with the public shareholder. 
  [LA TRIBUNE DESFOSSES] Even so, you have left Credit 
Lyonnais 
in a difficult situation. 
  [Haberer] When you use figures, you must place them in their 
right context, in particular against the background of a purge. 
One cannot say -- as some have not hesitated to -- that Credit 
Lyonnais is in a state of quasi-bankruptcy when the 6.9 billion 
francs [Fr] of losses represent no more than 7 to 8 percent of 
the Fr85 billion of shareholders' equity. This situation is 
incomparably less serious than that of banks which everyone 
knows have lost all their equity. In the same way, when one 
talks of the Fr20, 30, or even 40 billion of property loans 
which will be transferred within the scope of the streamlining 
operation, this should be seen in the context of the Fr2,000 
billion of the bank's total balance sheet. If these figures had 
been used in the right context, taking into account Credit 
Lyonnais' size, they would not have had anywhere near the same 
meaning. A few years ago two private banks, Barclays and 
Citibank, posted losses which were proportionally larger than 
those of Credit Lyonnais. Their top managers are still there 
and the banks are in a better situation. 
  [LA TRIBUNE DESFOSSES] Risk monitoring nonetheless does not 
appear to have been Credit Lyonnais' strong point. 
  [Haberer] It is true, but internal controls exist at Credit 
Lyonnais as they do elsewhere, and I was very much concerned 
with strengthening them. For example, I reformed the bank's 
internal audit department, its methods, and its management. I 
also created a centralized control function, as no consolidated 
control body existed to centralize the risks relating to the 
same customer at Credit Lyonnais' 100 or so subsidiaries. To 
emphasize the importance of this function, I installed it in the 
general directorate. Finally, I created a participation 
committee: Every time a significant investment was made in a 
business, a file was prepared, which ended up on my desk. But 
control can never be perfect, as there are procedures and the 
people who apply these procedures. At Credit Lyonnais, as in 
all major groups, fiefdoms exist which can block these 
mechanisms. I recognize that there were defects in the 
monitoring of certain of our French and foreign subsidiaries, 
and that it takes time to detect and correct these. 
  [LA TRIBUNE DESFOSSES] What share of the responsibility are 
you prepared to accept for Credit Lyonnais' difficulties? 
  [Haberer] As the president, it is natural that I am in the 
front line. I will not go into details on the major cases for 
which I am being reproached, but a certain, not insignificant, 
number were not begun while I was president. But I would point 
out that the major goal of my strategy -- both the bank for 
industry and the European bank -- are in no way the cause of the 
bank's difficulties. This second direction, which is extremely 
profitable in the long term, has moreover been maintained by my 
successor. My main mistake is not to have seen the crisis 
coming nor to have estimated its size. From that standpoint, I 
am also in pretty good company. And then Credit Lyonnais has 
not always had the managers which its strategy required. 
  [LA TRIBUNE DESFOSSES] Some people are maintaining that you 
did not always cooperate as you should have with the Treasury 
and the Banking Commission. 
  [Haberer] Not cooperating with these two bodies is 
inconceivable! Every time the Treasury or the Banking 
Commission asked for explanations or documents, I sent them. 
  Moreover, as a public bank, Credit Lyonnais submits all its 
accounts, quarter by quarter, to its supervising authority, that 
is the Treasury. As for the Banking Commission, it is finicky, 
but it is effective and offers good advice. 
  [LA TRIBUNE DESFOSSES] What do you mean when you affirm that 
you received recommendations from the government until March 
1993? 
  [Haberer] Pierre Beregovoy believed that it behoved a public 
bank like Credit Lyonnais to support the growth of French 
companies. There was no particular request with respect to 
specific cases, but a desire for backing in his campaign to 
support growth and employment. I complied with his wishes, 
which became more urgent when the recession began in 1991. I 
believe that I can say that many corporate customers appreciated 
Credit Lyonnais' dynamic approach.

  [Text] Paris, April 1 (AFP) -- The French government has 
decided not to privatize Hervet Bank "in the immediate future" 
because of its difficult financial situation, which led to a net 
loss of 1.2 billion francs (207 million dollars) in 1993, the 
Economics Ministry announced on Friday [1 April]. 
  It added that the state, which holds a 89.41 percent 
majority 
stake in Banque Hervet via Compagnie Financiere Hervet, will 
take part in putting the bank back on its feet by providing 750 
million francs in the form of stockholders' advances. 
  That amount will be added to the 150 million francs already 
paid in at the end of last year. 
  The government's goal is to get the bank back to 
profitability this year, the ministry said, "so as to prepare 
for privatization under the best possible conditions."

<F P=106> [Report by Sebastiano Messina: "Berlusconi Plans New </F>
Constitution"] 
  [Excerpt] Rome -- [passage omitted] Forza Italia's experts 
are working in top secret, following Wednesday's [27 March] 
meeting between [Forza Italia leader] Silvio Berlusconi and 
[Northern League Secretary] Umberto Bossi. Berlusconi's 
institutional advisers are stressing that it is the government 
that will draw up the plan for a new federal Constitution. 
However, on the basis of disclosures from reliable sources 
within both leaderships, it is possible to forecast a process of 
institutional reforms that could profoundly change the face of 
Italian democracy over the coming year. 
<H5>  Plan of Attack </H5>
  Berlusconi's plan of attack will have three main objectives. 
The form of the state will transition from a republic with 
centralized powers to a federal republic. The form of 
government will transform the parliamentary democracy into a 
semi-presidentialist system along the lines of the French Fifth 
Republic. And the electoral law will replace the Mattarella Law 
with a two-round system, another import from France. 
  On the first point, federalism, agreement is less remote 
than 
it may seem. If the League relinquishes its provocative theory 
of the three republics (of the Po Valley, Etruria, and the 
South) and if the National Alliance, having already gone as far 
as to accept "decentralization," takes a further step, the 
five-party group of Forza Italia, the League, the Alliance, the 
CCD [Christian Democratic Center], and the UDC [Center Union] 
could agree on a system in which the regions are half-way 
between Germany's Laender and Switzerland's cantons. 
  "The outlook is clear: Italy will have three or four 
`cantons,' achieved by means of a federal Constitution," the 
League's constitutional expert, Gianfranco Miglio said. He 
already has plans for how this will be achieved in parliament. 
"Now, with half the members plus one, we can look at Article 
138 of the Constitution and modify the constitutional plan by 
means of referendums. In fact almost all the constitutions in 
history have been formed by winners against losers, without 
referendums. But we, being democrats, will achieve this result 
by means of referendums. We have all the major sectors of the 
media...." 
  The powers enjoyed by these regions-cantons have yet to be 
defined, though there will certainly be radical changes to 
Article 117 of the Constitution, which grants a number of powers 
to the state, rather than the regions. Miglio will probably put 
forward again, with a few corrections, Article 7 of the federal 
Constitution launched at Assago three months ago. "The 
government is responsible for foreign policy, defense, the 
higher organization of justice, the currency, credit, overall 
economic planning, and balancing measures. All other matters are 
the responsibility of the republics and the autonomous regions." 
  The MSI [Italian Social Movement] could demand, and secure, 
state responsibility for education, but there should be no 
problems regarding fiscal decentralization. Thus, as Forza 
Italia's program says, "the power to levy taxes must be taken 
away from central government and transferred completely to the 
local authorities, which must then pay to central government a 
fixed proportion of the tax revenue gathered." In other words, 
it is city councils (or regional governments) that will set tax 
rates and gather taxes and duties, forwarding part of the 
revenue to Rome. [passage omitted]

<F P=106> [Unattributed article including interview with Lars </F>
Chemnitz, deputy leader for politics of the Atassut Party: "The 
Solidarity Party Is Not Finished With the EU"] 
  [Text] The party thinks that Lars Emil Johansen, the head 
of the provincial government, has gotten the EU [European Union] 
stuck in his throat. 
  Nuuk -- Why should Greenland's negotiations with the EU 
follow a single track just because Lars Emil Johansen, the head 
of the provincial government, has gotten the EU stuck in his 
throat? 
  This question is asked by the top leadership of Atassut 
[Solidarity Party] that has just come together for its first 
meeting after the turbulent convention in which many of the 
party's top leadership were moved out. Solidarity's Landsting 
group also participated at the meeting. 
  Greenland is faced with the coming renewal of the fishing 
agreement they had, with what was first the EC and now is the 
EU, that has been in effect ever since Greenland resigned its 
membership in the EC in 1985. 
  The fishing agreement expires 31 January 1995, but 
negotiations as to an extension of the fishing agreement for the 
next six-year period are under way. 
  Today the fishing agreement means an annual income for 
Greenland of 270 million kroner. 
<H5>  Several Possibilities </H5>
  The Solidarity Party's top leadership is dissatisfied with 
the fact that the provincial government one-sidedly is 
concentrating on a continuation of the fishing agreement, which 
in return for the 270 million kroner will grant EU fishermen set 
fishing quotas in Greenland's waters. 
  "The Solidarity Party thinks that the provincial government 
in parallel negotiations should investigate other alternative 
affiliations to the European Union, the EU," says Lars Chemnitz, 
the party's political deputy leader, to GRONLANDSPOSTEN. The 
Landsting and the people have the right to be informed on 
whether the tremendous increase in the amount of money in the 
EU's guaranteed funds, among other things, will upset old 
considerations of the advantages and disadvantages of remaining 
outside the EU. 
  [GRONLANDSPOSTEN] Are we then to have a renewed debate as to 
Greenland's membership in the EU? 
  [Chemnitz] Not at the present time, but we want a thorough 
investigation and evaluation of the current conditions of 
[membership in] the EU. We have resigned from the EU, but that 
is not unchangeable. Development both in the EU and in Greenland 
since we resigned in 1985 has been very strong, and we will 
always consider the new situation. Countries like Norway, 
Sweden, Finland and Austria are knocking on the EU's door, and 
an expanded market might have far-reaching consequences for 
Greenland's fishing agreements, duty-free status, and trade 
agreements with the EU. 
<H5>  New Situation </H5>
  [Chemnitz] A further consideration is Greenland's location, 
which has become more significant in recent years. After the end 
of the Cold War, Greenland was no longer located midway between 
the two superpowers, the Soviet Union and the United States, but 
on the outskirts of the world. 
  At present nationalists are rattling their sabers in Russia, 
and again there is tension between East and West. Therefore 
Greenland, because of its strategic location, is once again of 
consequence as a partner for the Western world, and we will take 
advantage of the possibilities of this new world order. 
  Moreover, the EU and the new free trade agreement between 
Canada, the United States, and Mexico will play a more important 
role in the future. Greenland is at risk of being squeezed 
between these two powerful trade blocs if we continue to remain 
outside the EU. 
<H5>  EU Funds </H5>
  [GRONLANDSPOSTEN] What is your personal opinion? 
  [Chemnitz] The Solidarity Party maintains that full 
membership in the EU will be the most advantageous thing for 
Greenland. To begin with we would like to have a dialogue with 
the EU, not only about fishing, but also about many other 
subjects. 
  [GRONLANDSPOSTEN] Why is it so important for the Solidarity 
Party to get Greenland to join the EU? 
  [Chemnitz] Because we think it will offer many advantages to 
become a member. We built the two large airports in Nuuk and 
Ilulissat with support from EU funds, but we were alone in 
building the hydroelectric power stations in Buksefjorden. Now 
we are faced with the demand of new capital investments in the 
form of many airstrips on the West Coast. Why not apply for 
regional support from the EU for this large construction project 
as a readmitted member instead of taking on large foreign loans 
that would burden our economy. 
  [GRONLANDSPOSTEN] Is not the Solidarity Party afraid of 
interference in internal Greenland affairs? 
  [Chemnitz] Today we have a fully developed trawler fleet 
that 
can compete on an equal footing with those of other nations. 
That was not the case 10 years ago, and that is why we saw many 
EC trawlers in Greenland's territorial waters the first few 
years of home rule. Moreover, today we are much more dependent 
on free access to markets for our fish products because we no 
longer export mineral natural resources. 
  [GRONLANDSPOSTEN] And you do not think that there will be a 
problem in entering [the EU] again. 
  [Chemnitz] That is not up to us, but we are a member of a 
commonwealth with the EU country Denmark, and this commonwealth 
might give us an admission ticket. 
<H5>  Poor Election </H5>
  [Chemnitz] The Solidarity Party brought Greenland's 
relationship with the EC into the election campaign before the 
Landsting election in 1991. The Solidarity Party did very poorly 
in the election, partly because Akulliit Partiiat [Center Party] 
did very well in the election and partly because of people's 
resistance to a renewed membership in the EC, now called the EU. 
  The Solidarity Party will not make a proposal regarding 
renewed membership in the EU either for this or the coming 
Landsting meeting, but we cannot avoid including this question 
in the coming election campaign before the Landsting election 
next year. 
  [GRONLANDSPOSTEN] Are you not afraid of another poor 
election 
showing? 
  [Chemnitz] No, because we learned much from the election of 
1991. We came on too strongly with our EC proposal and people 
were frightened. The other parties misunderstood our proposal on 
purpose and drew a frightening picture of the EC in Greenland. 
That will not happen this time.

<F P=106> [Report on interview with Vladimir Zhirinovskiy, leader of </F>
the Russian Liberal Democratic Party, by Arto Nieminen; place 
and date not specified -- recorded, Zhirinovskiy's remarks are 
translated into Finnish by unidentified translator] 
  [Excerpts] Vladimir Zhirinovskiy, chairman of the Russian 
Liberal Democrats, arrived in Helsinki this afternoon as a 
member of a Russian parliamentary delegation. Already at the 
airport, Zhirinovskiy rejected an image of himself as a 
nationalist extremist who is moving borders. However, 
Zhirinovskiy again warned Finland against joining NATO, saying 
that Russia would safeguard the inviolability of an independent 
Finland. Arto Nieminen reports: 
  [Nieminen] So he is here now today: Zhirinovskiy, who has 
been accused of being a nationalist extremist, arrived for a 
seminar that will discuss Russia's possibilities of getting into 
the Council of Europe. The seminar may, however, be only a 
secondary matter as the two-day Russian internal political drama 
opens tomorrow after a transfer to Finland. Zhirinovskiy was 
immediately pressed to explain his statements of yesterday that 
clearly warned Finland against allying itself more closely than 
now to the West. Now Zhirinovskiy says that Finland can join 
whatever it wants, but NATO would be an alliance against 
Russia's interests. Here is Zhirinovskiy with his interpreter. 
  [Zhirinovskiy] The question is, of course, that Finland may 
join whatever it likes, that is Finland's affair. Russia would 
like Finland to be an independent, neutral state. Russia is 
prepared to guarantee Finland's independence and inviolability, 
but of course, if Finland joins NATO, then that is against 
Russia's interests and in a possible war situation, military 
operations will be taking place on Finnish territory too and 
naturally that is not in Finland's interests, but Finland itself 
has to decide on these matters. 
  [Nieminen] NATO's Partnership for Peace is also, in 
Zhirinovskiy's view, only an initial stage of NATO membership. 
  [Zhirinovskiy] It is all a bluff intended for small states. 
It is like the porch into NATO. 
  [Nieminen] Zhirinovskiy said that he loves Finland, and the 
Finnish language is sheer music to him, but the Baltic countries 
were more severely condemned. According to Zhirinovskiy, the 
Baltic countries are little towns comparable to Monaco and they 
belong to Russia's territory. 
  Zhirinovskiy also rejected the latest reports on his Jewish 
background. According to the news agencies, until his 18th 
year, Zhirinovskiy is supposed to have been called Eidelstein. 
Zhirinovskiy said that he himself knows best what his name was. 
However, his memory for names was poor -- Zhirinovskiy called 
the Finnish president Koivisto until an assistant corrected him. 
  Zhirinovskiy slipped into the Russian delegation as if by 
accident. The invitation to the seminar was extended before it 
was known that Vladimir Zhirinovskiy would be nominated to the 
Russian parliament's group of visitors to the Council of Europe. 
[passage omitted] 
  The seminar opens tomorrow, and it seems that Zhirinovskiy 
has the clear intention of getting everything out of this 
seminar that supports the aims of the Liberal Democrats in 
Russia. This became evident at once; the other members of the 
delegation already had their work cut out in denying 
Zhirinovskiy's remarks at the airport.

<F P=106> [Article by Jan Gunnar Furuly: "Losses Small From </F>
Antiwhaling Actions"] 
  [Text] Only 14 Norwegian exporting firms lost between 6.1 
and 9.8 million [Norwegian] kroner [NKr] because of Norwegian 
minke whale harvesting. 
  "I would characterize the losses as insignificant," 
Professor 
Trond Bjorndal of the School of Advanced Economic Studies in 
Bergen said. Bjorndal was presenting a brand-new study 
commissioned by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs. 
  Some parts of the industrial and commercial sector in Norway 
feared the worst when Norway decided to resume commercial minke 
whaling last year. The report concludes, however, that only 
ripple effects have been registered from the boycott actions in 
Great Britain, Germany, and the United States. The report 
researchers were not able to measure any losses for Norwegian 
businesses in other markets. 
<H5>  Worst in Germany </H5>
  The figures of lost sales presented yesterday in Oslo are in 
stark contrast to the claims of the environmental organization 
Greenpeace that said that Norwegian business last year lost 
NKr450 million in canceled contracts because of whaling. 
  The environmental activists were the most successful in 
harming Norwegian exporters in Germany. Presumed losses have 
been registered by seven Norwegian exporting companies, two of 
which were fish exporters. A number of other businesses reported 
canceled contracts, but according to Bjorndal this was 
compensated for by the businesses finding other buyers for their 
products. 
  All in all Norwegian businesses had a sales loss of NKr10.7 
million on the German market. With an adjustment for 
nonincurred production expenses the businesses wound up with a 
reduced profit of between NKr2.7 and NKr4.4 million. 
  "We think this is the correct way to gauge the losses to 
Norwegian industry. It is pointless to attach numbers to 
canceled contracts," Prof. Bjorndal stressed. 
<H5>  Increased Export </H5>
  In Great Britain the losses to Norwegian firms are estimated 
at between 2.7 and NKr4.4 million. In the United States there 
do not appear to have been any losses as a result of antiwhaling 
actions, but three firms did have extra expenses for 
warehousing, legal aid, and information campaigns to the tune of 
NKr700,000. 
  Bjorndal pointed out that during the same period Norwegian 
business and industry generally made much progress in the very 
markets where Greenpeace and other environmental groups had 
urged a boycott of Norway. 
  Fish exports to Great Britain and Germany increased by 11 
and 
4.6 percent respectively, compared with the preceding year. At 
the same time there was a strong increase in German tourist 
traffic in Norway, while British tourism in Norway stagnated. 
But the reduced size of British tourist traffic to Norway in 
1993 was much lower than the overall reduction in British travel 
abroad. While the number of British guest days in Norway 
declined by 3.9 percent, the overall reduction in British travel 
abroad was about 12 percent. 
  "The preliminary figures for influx of tourists last year 
show that the strong skepticism voiced by the exporting sector 
regarding Norwegian whaling were not well founded in reality," 
Prof. Bjorndal said. 
<H5>  [Box, p 4] </H5>
<H5>  Whaling 1993 </H5>

  -  Norwegian whalers shot 226 whales last year for an initial 
value of NKr13.2 million. 
  -  Twenty-eight vessels participated in 
the traditional whaling; four vessels did research whaling. 
  -  The 
Ministry of Foreign Affairs spent NKr11.5 million on special 
information campaigns abroad. 
  -  Training of inspectors for the 
whaling vessels cost NKr2.5 million. 
  -  If the harvest of minke 
whales increases to 1,700-1,800 animals, the activity will have 
a market potential of NKr250 million.

<F P=106> [Article by Anita Krantz: "Environment Makes Minister </F>
Hesitate"] 
  [Excerpt] It does not go without saying that Environmental 
Affairs Minister Olof Johansson (Center Party) will vote in 
favor of EU [European Union] membership for environmental 
reasons, even though he was personally responsible for the 
negotiations on environmental policy in Brussels. 
  "Many people say the EU is sufficient to solve our 
environmental problems. They do not know what they are talking 
about," Johansson said during a lunch break during a ministers' 
meeting of the Nordic Council at the Riksdag building in 
Stockholm. 
<H5>  Center and Social Democrats Most Split </H5>
  He has not yet taken an overall position on membership. 
  The Social Democrats and the Center Party are the two 
parties 
that are most divided over the EU issue. Unlike Social Democrat 
Ingvar Carlsson, Johansson believes that a party leader cannot 
push his personal views on the EU question. If the Center Party 
Assembly wants the party to oppose the EU in the referendum, 
then Johansson must support that position. 
  Thus, he finds it difficult to understand how Carlsson 
believes he can stay on as party chairman and speak in favor of 
EU membership if the party recommends that the people oppose it. 
  Carlsson has stated that it is the people who will 
ultimately 
decide in the referendum. Then all members of Riksdag will have 
to accommodate themselves -- for example, Gudrun Schyman of the 
Left Party may have to press the yes button. 
<H5>  Wants To Be In Step With Party </H5>
  Johansson believes it is his duty to "be in step with the 
party." He also believes that Carlsson and others who have taken 
a position have done so for ideological reasons. 
  "But then the negotiations are less important. They are 
almost irrelevant. I believe this is an issue for party 
platforms. 
  ``In the position Ingvar Carlsson has taken, I would not 
stay 
on as party leader if the party was of a different opinion.'' 
<H5>  Has Not Taken a Position </H5>
  Johansson maintains that he has still not taken even a 
personal position. A number of questions are still being 
negotiated, such as how many votes Sweden will have in the 
Council of Ministers. 
  "The Swedish debate is also ignoring what will happen on the 
national scene. I am against any attempt to use the results of 
the EU negotiations in regional and agriculture policy or in any 
other area to reduce our national efforts." 
<H5>  Responsibility for Important Areas </H5>
  The Center Party was responsible for three of the most 
important areas in the EU negotiations: agriculture, regional 
policy, and the environment. Johansson believes they exceeded 
expectations in the first two areas and, based on the results of 
the negotiations, they make him "lean toward a yes vote." 
  On the other hand, Johansson believes that the EU is not 
very 
good at tackling the world's environmental problems. 
  He still remembers quite well that the EU countries could 
not 
agree to support a carbon dioxide tax at the world environmental 
conference in Rio in 1992. 
  Environmental Affairs Minister Johansson has noted that EU 
countries such as Germany, the Netherlands, and Denmark would 
like very much to see Sweden, with its good reputation in 
environmental policy, become a member and help push 
environmental issues. 
<H5>  Good Results of Negotiations </H5>
  Despite everything, the results of the negotiations are 
good, 
according to Johansson, considering the strong interests of 
industry, agriculture, and transport in the EC countries. 
  These interests saw Sweden's environmental demands as an 
overriding threat to free competition, which seems to be more 
important than a better environment and health protection in 
some cases, according to Johansson's impressions of the 
negotiations. 
  Sweden was given a transition period of four years and may 
not have to lower its environmental standards after that period. 
If the Swedes adapt to the tougher attitude around the 
negotiating table in Brussels, then Sweden can be a driving 
force in the future, as well, Johansson believes. 
  "It is a real battle. You have to be damn strong and 
single-minded." [passage omitted]

  [Text] The Americans believe that there is a possibe 
compromise formula on access to the fenced area of Famagusta 
that will be handed over to the United Nations. The CyBC 
[Cyprus Broadcasting Corporation] correspondent in New York 
reports that the Americans are promoting a plan to provide safe 
access to the fenced area of Famagusta in exchange for the 
removal of the area north of Dhimokratias Avenue from the 
package of confidence-building measures or an amendment to the 
timeframe for return of the area. The CyBC correspondent also 
reports that it cannot be ruled out that the UN secretary 
general and the Security Council's five permanent members will 
invite President Glavkos Kliridhis and [Turkish Cypriot Leader] 
Rauf Denktas to New York. It is also not ruled out that 
President Kliridhis will go to the United States by the end of 
this week for consultations with the leadership of the U.S. 
State Department and the Security Council permanent members.

that any further discussion of the confidence-building measures 
[CBM's] is subject to the Turkish side accepting the two 
unofficial documents proffered by the United Nations. He added 
that the process for implementing the CBM's has been terminated 
due to the negative stance of the Turkish side. The UN 
secretary general's representatives, the spokesman said, 
submitted proposals that they considered to be fair and to meet 
the concerns of each side. The Greek Cypriot side, the 
spokesman continued, cooperated in full and reacted 
constructively, in contrast with the Turkish side. Kasoulidhis 
also stressed that no political advantage the Turkish side is 
trying to gain through the CBM's process can be accepted.

  [Text] Atay Ahmet Rasit, minister of foreign affairs and 
defense, has urged the UN authorities to stop the Greek Cypriots 
from taking steps that will lead the negotiation process to a 
dead end. 
  In a written statement issued today, Rasit charged that the 
Greek Cypriot Administration first stepped up its arms buildup 
within the framework of the Turkish-Greek joint defense doctrine 
and increased its number of troops. Now, he added, the Greek 
Cypriots are amassing troops along the borders and reinforcing 
their positions. 
  Rasit stated that the Greek Cypriot Administration which is 
leading the negotiations to an impasse is trying to divert the 
world's attention by accusing the Turkish Cypriot side. The 
aim, Rasit said, is to get rid of the confidence-building 
measures which the Greek Cypriots claim are no longer 
meaningful, and to ensure that the UN Security Council passes a 
resolution accusing the Turkish Cypriot side. 
  The minister of foreign affairs and defense called on the UN 
authorities to hold discussions with the Greek Cypriot officials 
as soon as possible, to prevent the tension being deliberately 
escalated by the Greek Cypriots from causing a confrontation, at 
this critical stage of the proximity talks.

  [Excerpt] The Cypriot House of Representatives and the 
Greek Chamber of Deputies have established a mechanism for 
continuous exchange of information, coordination, and 
cooperation in all international bodies to which they both 
belong, as well as for international bodies in which only Greece 
participates. House of Representatives President Alexis Galanos 
announced this upon his return this evening from Athens, where 
he headed a multiparty parliamentary delegation. The president 
of the House of Representatives and the parliamentary delegation 
also had a meeting with Theodhoros Pangalos, Greek Alternate 
Foreign Minister. 
  Speaking after the meeting with Galanos, the Greek alternate 
foreign minister described the state of alert by the occupation 
forces and other Turkish actions as very impudent provocations. 
They think that they are powerful, Pangalos added, but this is 
not the first time someone has threatened Greece with his size 
and was later ridiculed. [passage omitted]

  [Text] Government spokesman Ioannis Kasoulidhis has said 
the Turkish side's reasons for placing the occupation forces on 
alert are unjustified and provocative. He also clarified that 
the National Guard has been placed on partial readiness due to 
the alert of the occupation forces along the confrontation line. 
Kasoulidhis described the National Guard's reaction as a normal 
procedure that will conclude when the Turkish occupation forces 
are taken off alert. It would be naive, the spokesman 
concluded, for anyone to believe that the Greek Cypriot side, 
amid the current political developments, would be foolish enough 
to tamper with the confrontation line.

  [Text] The respective presidents of the Greek and Cypriot 
Parliaments, Apostolos Kaklamanis and Alexis Galanos, met in 
Athens today and discussed close cooperation and better 
coordination between the two institutions to promote national 
issues. During the meeting there was a mutual briefing 
regarding the difficulties in support for national issues in 
international organizations. 
  Kaklamanis stated that besides the issue of Skopje [The 
Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia, FYROM], the Cyprus issue 
is also at a critical phase as a result of the talks on 
confidence-building measures. The president of the Greek 
Chamber of Deputies repeated the commitment repeatedly expressed 
by the government and prime minister to togetherness, 
solidarity, and common direction between he two countries. 
  Alexix Galanos, the Cypriot House of Representatives 
president, referred to the hypocritical practice of using 
different measures and putting different weight on the issues of 
Skopje and Cyprus. Although Turkey invaded and occupies the 
north of the island, today it appears as a peaceloving nation. 
The president of the Cypriot House of Representatives stressed 
that besides the unified defense space, Greece and Cyprus should 
formulate a unified diplomatic area to promote national issues, 
which are undivided. At 1500 [1200 GMT] this afternoon, Galanos 
also met Greek Alternate Foreign Minister Theodhoros Pangalos. 
  After meeting Galanos, Pangalos said they discussed topics 
regarding Cyprus, developments around the Cyprus issue, and the 
Cypriot Parliament's participation in the Parliamentary Assembly 
of the Council of Europe. 
  Asked to comment on developments in Istanbul, Pangalos said: 
We have a series of developments that concern us and we have 
the statement of the new mayor. I hope calm will prevail and 
that someone will prove to those who use such methods that they 
should choose between a return to the past and a move to the 
future. Turkey cannot possibly seek a position in the family of 
European nations and, at the same time, remember the 
achievements of the captors [reference to the Ottoman Empire]. 
I believe that Hellenism, the civilized world, and the great 
community of Orthodox nations, Pangalos concluded, are 
determined to protect the Orthodox Partriarchate, which is an 
international organization with particular importance for the 
world community as a whole.

<F P=106> [Article by Th. Kouloumbis, professor of international </F>
relations at the University of Athens: "The Turkish Provocation"] 
  [Text] The dimension of the Turkish threat has been 
systematically discussed in our country, where there is almost 
total agreement on the methods for confronting it. The main 
elements of deterrence Greece possesses are: a) Strong and 
battle-ready armed forces that ensure the Greek-Turkish balance 
of power; b) An active Greek participation in NATO, the Western 
European Union [WEU], and the European Union (EU), which 
strengthens our diplomatic, economic, and political support by 
removing the possibility of a Turkish military operation against 
us; c) A strategic dogma that prevents the country from 
embroilment in a simultaneous confrontation on two or more 
fronts east and north of our borders. 
  Let us discuss the aspect of the provocation concerning the 
"opportunity," that is, the way to find a mutually acceptable 
solution of a range of Greek-Turkish problems. 
  A future historical compromise with Turkey will free Greece 
from the burden of absolutely necessary defense expenditures. 
Reduction of these expenditures--of the order of 6 percent of 
GDP--will have immediate and positive repercussions on the 
attempt to stabilize and develop our economy to satisfy the 
Maastricht criteria and to avoid the marginalization of Greece 
in the steadily uniting EU. Additionally, the neutralization of 
the Turkish threat will strengthen our negotiating position in 
the Balkans and allow Greece to move with imagination and ease 
in shaping collective policy within the framework of the EU, the 
WEU, and NATO. A historical compromise will have similar 
advantages for Turkey, because it will open the way for its 
integration into the logic of democracy, mutual economic 
dependence, gradual "demilitarization" of Turkish society and 
its long-term harmonious integration into European structures. 
However, we must stress at this point that recent domestic 
developments in Turkey leave thin margins for optimism for the 
important issue we could call "Turkish democratic metamorphosis." 
  Greek-Turkish problems (most of which were created 
one-sidedly by Turkey within the context of a troubled and 
revisionist policy) include the continuing Turkish occupation of 
Cyprus, the demand that the Aegean continental shelf be divided, 
the contested Greek right to extend territorial waters and air 
space to 12 miles, the presently contested 10-mile limit of our 
national air space, the proposal for joint administration of the 
Aegean within the framework of the operational control of NATO 
commands, our contested right to the defensive militarization of 
the Aegean and Dhodhekanisos islands, and, finally, the 
increasing "demands" concerning the rights of the Muslim 
minority in Greek Thraki. 
  Even listing these "problems" is disheartening to the most 
optimistic observer. Nevertheless, the possibility of achieving 
a strategy of decreasing tensions (let us not hide the fact that 
a Cold War has existed in Greek-Turkish relations for the past 
20 years) is worthwhile and ought to be sought by Greece and by 
Turkey. At this juncture, we should again emphasize that the 
recent violations of human rights of the neighboring country's 
Kurdish minority do not lend themselves to an immediate 
rapprochement. 
  In spite of our reservations, we will bring this brief 
article to a close with a proposal for a dialogue with the 
neighboring country. 
  It must be mutually acknowledged that: 
  -- It is impossible to return to a climate of Greek-Turkish 
friendship (as in the 1930's) without a fair solution to the 
Cyprus problem. 
  -- A formula for the solution of the Cyprus issue 
presupposes 
that Greece will sacrifice the vision of Enosis, and Turkey will 
sacrifice the vision of Division, to produce an independent 
Cyprus Federation, which will become a member of the EU and NATO 
as soon as its foundation is agreed upon. 
  -- A formula for the solution of the problems in the Aegean 
precludes two extreme choices: Greece will not seek to turn the 
Aegean into a "Greek lake." For its part, Turkey will give up 
the claims aimed at dividing the Aegean by "imprisoning" our 
islands into Turkish areas of operational responsibilities. 
  -- Both sides understand that the implementation of a 
strategy aimed at achieving peace between Greece and Turkey will 
be a difficult and time- consuming process. As a result, the 
adoption of various "packages/confidence measures" in the Aegean 
and in Cyprus should not be excluded. On the contrary, an 
accelerated strategy of confidence-building measures (i.e., the 
reduction/removal of offensive weapons from the borders between 
the two countries) will lead to the creation of more favorable 
conditions to achieve peace. 
  As peace processes in areas of long-time confrontation 
(Palestine, Northern Ireland, and South Africa) are developing, 
it would be tragic if we were to fatalistically accept the idea 
that as Greeks and Turks, we are condemned to an eternal 
confrontation that so weakens the two sides. Perhaps the time is 
approaching for a Greek-Turkish "Oslo."

    [Editorial Report] The true mark of great political leaders 
is their willingness to speak seriously to the people and 
provide them with correct information, writes Spiros Linardhatos 
in the 20 March Athens weekly TO VIMA TTS KIRIAKIS. In contrast, 
the "Macedonian" issue is an example of demagoguery and 
delusion, with political leaders "saying one thing and doing 
another," Linardhatos continues. To illustrate, he quotes a 
letter from former Prime Minister Mitsotakis to the Athens 
weekly OIKONOMIKOS TAKHIDHROMOS, in which Mitsotakis admitted 
that the "Skopje problem" should heve been settled by his 
government through an advantageous compromise based on a 
"composite name" and the fulfillment of conditions on "the 
symbol, the constitution, and propaganda." However, Mitsotakis 
continued, a settlement did not occur because "until the New 
Democracy (ND) government fell, the required parliamentary 
majority to solve the issue was lacking." The former prime 
minister failed to explain why the people were not told a 
compromise with Skopje was necessary and that continuing 
confrontation over the name issue was harmful to Greece's 
national interests, Linardhatos comments. The present 
Panhellenic Socialist Movement (PASOK) government doubtlessly 
knows that such an "advantageous "--or at least "not 
harmful"--compromise will allow the country to face important 
domestic and foreign problems, on which Greece's place in the 
world and the people's welfare depend, Linardhatos notes. 
Dialogue and international support could produce satisfactory 
results, for the Greek "countermeasures" adopted against Skopje 
have caused problems, notably in the Greek European Union (EU) 
presidency. More importantly, the continuing crisis strengthens 
Balkan countries inimical to Greece and fosters domestic 
antidemocratic tendencies by intensifying nationalistic 
sentiment and expressions of "intolerance and ideological 
terrorism" like the demand by three deputies for punitive 
measures against academics calling for a compromise, Linardhatos 
concludes. 
  Calling Greece's position in the Balkans "problematic," K.I. 
Angelopoulos notes in the 20 March Athens daily I KATHIMERINI 
that Prime Minister Andreas Papandreou interrupted the UN 
process on Skopje and "spectacularly" imposed an embargo on that 
country. At the same time, Papandreou is attempting to start a 
dialogue that would omit the name issue despite the resulting 
difficulties. According to Angelopoulos, the prime minister 
believes that even if the name is a "lost cause," he lacks the 
requisite strength to give up his rejection of "Macedonia or a 
byproduct" and prefers to set the issue aside. It should be 
noted, Angelopoulos adds, that the prime minister does not wish 
to link any development in the Skopje affair with his official 
April visit to Washington, in the belief that a "pending issue" 
will not affect Greek-American talks. Angelopoulos cites 
unidentified Papandreou aides as saying that the prime minister 
will only ask President Clinton to exert more pressure on Skopje 
President Kiro Gligorov. According to the same sources, 
Papandreou is more interested in promoting Greek-American 
cooperation in the Balkans and will go for the "best possible" 
contacts in this regard during his U.S. visit. However, 
Angelopoulos comments that it may be difficult to fulfill Greek 
ambitions for a central role in the Balkans if Greece persists 
in not recognizing the Skopje republic, given the demonstrated 
interest in that country by its Balkan neighbors, Europe, and 
the United States. The problem is not only diplomatic, 
Angelopoulos continues. While Skopje is affected by the Greek 
embargo, Greek economic and political losses are becoming 
increasingly obvious and Athens is watching Balkan developments 
from the sidelines. While Papandreou "hears" Washington 
extolling the advantages of a Greek intervention in the area, he 
remains "trapped" in the Skopje issue, as did his predecessors 
in the past two years, Angelopoulos concludes.

    [Editorial Report] As the April date for the Panhellenic 
Socialist Movement (PASOK) congress approaches, candidacies for 
the second slot in the party's hierarchy are "timidly emerging," 
writes Tasos Pappas in the 20 March Athens weekly KIRIAKATIKI 
ELEVTHEROTIPIA. No doubt Prime Minister Andreas Papandreou will 
remain party leader and general secretary Akis Tsokhatzopoulos 
will probably be reelected, Pappas comments. Tsokhatzopoulos' 
advantages are his familiarity with the party apparatus and the 
control he exerts over "critical state-nomarchies-districts" 
links with the party. While Tsokhatzopoulos contends Papandreou 
favors him, "only time will tell," Pappas observes. While 
another candidate, Defense Minister Yerasimos Arsenis, is 
"keeping his cards close to his chest," influential PASOK deputy 
and trade-unionist D. Piperyias, a long-time friend of Arsenis, 
is cited by Pappas as stating in a recent interview that he 
prefers the defense minister over other heirs apparent. For his 
part, Minister of Industry Kostas Simitis is "steadfastly" 
following his modernizing course and recently "inveighed" 
against trade unions and party hacks pressuring for additional 
hirings of public workers. PASOK luminary Vaso Papandreou is 
moving "in the same vital space." While on the surface Minister 
of Environment Kostas Laliotis shows indifference to party 
developments, he surely entertains his own ambitions and expects 
to play the role of "gold reserves," Pappas continues. He goes 
on to mention deputy Minister of Foreign Affairs Theodhoros 
Pangalos, who has "many friends and sworn enemies," as well as 
PASOK luminary Apostolos Kaklamanis, president of the Chamber of 
Deputies, and old party members Yiannis Alevras and Yiannis 
Kharalambopoulos. Of course, Pappas concludes, the major unknown 
elements are Minister of National Economy Yiorgos Yennimatas and 
his followers' stance, as it is generally believed that the 
outcome of the race will depend on their moves. 
  According to Notis Papadhopoulos and Yiannis Politis writing 
in the 19 March Athens daily TA NEA, Theodhoros Pangalos is "no 
longer hiding his leadership ambitions." His most recent 
statements regarding the government's "unrealistic foreign and 
economic policies" are perceived as attempting to influence 
PASOK congress developments, the authors comment. They point 
out, however, that Pangalos always "hastens to correct his 
course" by following up with support for the government. The 
deputy minister clearly has a personal strategy, which he 
believes will bear fruit both at the congress and on a long-term 
basis. While his "impulsiveness" may cause temporary 
unpleasantness, Pangalos aides are cited as believing it 
increases his popularity as a politician "who says it like it 
is." Papadhopoulos and Politis cite a recent poll commissioned 
by the New Democracy (ND) (no further details) showing Pangalos 
as one of the best liked Greek politicians. In contrast, they 
note, Pangalos' colleagues are very guarded about his sometimes 
"heretical" stance, even if reluctant to state it publicly, the 
authors conclude. 
  Government reaction to Pangalos' criticism of governmental 
policies was swift, reports the 19 March TA NEA. Government 
spokesman Evangelos Venizelos emphasized the present "specific, 
coordinated, and pondered" economic policy and indirectly 
accused Pangalos of ignoring Papandreouf's directive requesting 
his ministers to refrain from expressing individual views on 
important issues. In another development, the 13 March 
KIRIAKATIKI ELEVTHEROTIPIA comments on the "well-known" conflict 
between Minister of Foreign Affairs Karolos Papoulias and 
Pangalos. According to the brief article, while it is clear that 
Papandreou sides with the former and has already decided to 
dismiss Pangalos, a public announcement will only come "at the 
right moment." The 20 March I KATHIMERINI echoes this by 
reporting that despite Papandreou's determination to dismiss 
Pangalos, he will only do so when the Greek European Union (EU) 
presidency ends, to avoid making him a "hero" and turning him 
into a potential successor at the PASOK congress. 
  The 20 March TO VIMA TIS KIRIAKIS published an interview 
with 
Pangalos by Petros Evthimiou, in which the alternate minister 
advocated the modernization and Europeanization of PASOK and of 
society, changes that will begin to take place during the 
forthcoming congress. Pangalos also maintained that while the 
party should be the state's inspiration and play a critical role 
vis-a-vis the government, this should only occur at the top, 
through a parallel structure unconnected to the government. 
Evthimiou asked Pangalos whether this will be a 
"post-Papandreou" congress charged with defining the party's 
course if Papandreou moves to the presidency and leaves the 
field to party officials. He also linked the question to an 
unidentified Pangalos central committee colleague's hope that 
the party will not break up in the post-Papandreou era, and that 
the PASOK fragments will remain friendly even if it did. 
Pangalos replied that the congress will have a unifying 
influence in that there will be a synthesis of the various 
views, which an overwhelming majority will approve. The 
alternate minister then expressed his conviction that "there 
will be no second Andreas Papandreou," and that in the future, 
the party will have a collective leadership, one of whose 
members will be nominated for the prime ministership on a 
rotating basis according to the needs of the moment. While this 
may be difficult to accept, it constitutes the normal political 
life of a modern democratic European country, Pangalos concluded.

    [Editorial Report] Writing in the 20 March Athens daily I 
KATHIMERINI, commentator Stamos Zoulas notes that a "deep 
change" is seemingly taking shape in Greek political life, 
characterized by the departure from old-style political 
practices and the emergence of a new generation rejecting both 
past and present and pursuing the "modernizing rebirth" of the 
country's public life. The first step was taken when the 
leadership of the New Democracy (ND) went from Konstandinos 
Mitsotakis to new man Miltiadhis Evert. While former ND luminary 
Andonis Samaras had already left the party to found his own 
Political Spring, it is too early to evaluate his initiative, 
which in the future may well be viewed as a "simple episode." 
Similarly, the change that took place in the Coalition of the 
Left for Progress with new leader N. Konstandopoulos, who claims 
to be a modernizer, may not have much effect on Greek political 
life given the party's small size, Zoulas contends. As a result, 
change is more noticeable in the two largest parties, he 
continues. In the ND, Evert initiated a new opposition policy no 
longer based on strident criticism at the risk of arousing his 
followers' ire, in the belief that similar tendencies are 
developing within the Panhellenic Socialist Movement (PASOK). He 
also thinks that Prime Minister Andreas Papandreou will not be 
his opponent in the next elections, whether they take place as 
scheduled or in 1995 because of the Chamber of Deputies' 
inability to elect a new president. Evert's evaluation of the 
situation in PASOK stems from the "Simitis rebellion" and the 
"Pangalos movement," both indications that the Papandreou 
succession struggle is coming into the open, Zoulas writes. He 
quotes Minister of Industry and Commerce Kostas Simitis as 
making a "spectacular overture" for economic liberalization by 
referring to "the Scylla of statism and the Charybdis of the 
state's indifference." In addition, he cites Simitis as 
"unequivocally" condemning party choices of officials and 
hirings of public workers and indirectly blaming PASOK for the 
crisis in public administration. For his part, alternate 
Minister of Foreign Affairs Theodhoros Pangalos implicitly 
criticized his party's economic policy and its lack of resolve 
in punishing tax evaders, whom he called "criminals." In Zoulas' 
view, both men have adopted a "modern political discourse devoid 
of ideological sloganeering." Above all, he remarks, both reject 
the strategy of "confrontation, divisions, and historical 
rivalry" that PASOK and Papandreou have used thus far as a 
"recipe for artificial polarization." It is obvious that Evert, 
Simitis, and Pangalos believe such methods are incompatible with 
the solutions to the country's problems and contrast with the 
modernizing course followed by all European Union (EU) member 
states, Zoulas concludes. 
  Highlighting the bipolarization of Greek politics, an 
article 
in the 11 March Athens daily TA NEA lists the differences 
between the PASOK and ND internal structures. The article points 
out that the PASOK executive bureau has 10 members, all coming 
from the ranks of PASOK deputies, while the ND's executive 
committee has 17 members, 11 of whom are deputies and six come 
from the party. The PAS0K central committee has 141 members, 63 
of them deputies and 78 nondeputies, while the ND central 
committee numbers 75 people, 25 of whom come from the party's 
parliamentary ranks and 50 from the party.

    [Editorial Report] An article in the 15 March Athens daily 
ELEVTHEROTIPIA reports that Minister of National Economy Yiorgos 
Yennimatas has been "admirable" during his bout with cancer and 
has followed a therapy that has seemingly failed to stop the 
spread of the disease. His condition has been treated with 
utmost discretion by Prime Minister Andreas Papandreou and the 
government. According to repeated statements, there will be no 
government shuffle without the personal approval of Yennimatas, 
who will himself decide whether to retain his ministry. 
  According to a brief article in the 16 March Athens daily I 
KATHIMERINI, no intragovernmental changes will occur unless 
Yennimatas himself requests them, for he is "precious capital" 
for the Panhellenic Socialist Movement (PASOK) and enjoys 
everyone's respect. This is only natural, for during 
Papandreou's illness some years ago "no one dared propose" he 
should resign for health reasons. 
  In the course of speculating in the 20 March Athens weekly 
TO 
VIMA TIS KIRIAKIS on the identity of the most likely candidates 
to a future PASOK leadership, I.K. Pretenderis also notes that 
the expected move of ailing Yiorgos Yennimatas to the post of 
deputy prime minister would leave his present position vacant. 
Probable replacements for Yennimatas could be PASOK luminary 
Ioannis Pottakis, who, according to Pretenderis, enjoys the 
support of Andonis Livanis, deputy minister at the Prime 
Minister's Office; and Bank of Greece Governor Ioannis Boutos, 
who is well liked in the Papandreou entourage, Pretenderis 
notes. Another potential candidate, Minister of Industry and 
Commerce Kostas Simitis, would refuse to leave his ministry, and 
it is also unlikely that Papandreou would appoint him minister 
of national economy. While possessing the necessary 
qualifications, PASOK deputy Vaso Papandreou's "cool" relations 
with the prime minister would preclude her appointment. A third 
candidate, Minister of National Defense Yerasimos Arsenis would 
be "unacceptable" to both Papandreou and other members of the 
party, Pretenderis continues. This impasse is perhaps the reason 
why alternate Minister of Foreign Affairs Theodhoros Pangalos is 
promoting his own candidacy in spite of knowing that Papandreou 
would not release him while Greece is European Union (EU) 
president, Pretenderis concludes. 
  According to Nikos Nikolaou writing in the 20 March TO VIMA 
TIS KIRIAKIS, while the PASOK parliamentary group and the party 
seem to prefer Pottakis, a Boutos appointment enjoys important 
support and would be well received in domestic and foreign 
economic circles. If Boutos wins, his most likely successors at 
the Bank of Greece would be Pan. Poulis and Pan. Korliras, 
governors of the Commercial Bank and the Ionian Bank 
respectively.

  [Excerpt] Motherland Party [ANAP] leader Mesut Yilmaz has 
said that he has serious doubts that the sacrifices involved in 
the economic stability program will be distributed justly or 
that the measures will be definitely implemented by the current 
government. 
  In a statement after the ANAP Chairmanship Council meeting, 
Yilmaz said that Turkey has needed a stability program since the 
end of 1991, but that a very important period of time was 
wasted. He pointed out that the necessity was felt more 
strongly at the end of 1992. He stressed that this issue was 
not considered even in the 1994 budget. Yilmaz maintained that 
the economic stability program was delayed as a result of 
coalition negotiations. 
  [Begin Yilmaz recording] Before everything else, a stability 
program needs a consensus that a program is necessary. There is 
a consensus in our public today that these measures are indeed 
necessary. However, we are concerned that an incomplete 
stability program might destroy this consensus. [end recording]

  [Text] Murat Karayalcin, leader of the Social Democratic 
Populist Party [SDPP], state minister, and deputy prime 
minister, has said that the economic stability package envisages 
an equal share of the burden by all the sectors of the 
community, and that there will be no freeze on salaries. 
  Replying to a journalist's question during a meeting of the 
SDPP Central Executive Council, Karayalcin said that the 
economic stability package will not place a burden on the 
working people. You will see, he said, that all the sectors of 
the economy will share an equal burden. 
  Addressing the meeting, Karayalcin said that organizational 
readjustments will be made within the SDPP soon. We are also on 
the threshold of a new period in government activities, he said. 
He denied that the SDPP wants the government protocol to be 
changed. 
  [Begin Karayalcin recording] However, we consider it 
necessary that a new priority list be drawn up about the issues 
the SDPP is sensitive about. This list will indicate when these 
issues will be implemented, or when they will be submitted to 
the Turkish Grand National Assembly. [end recording] 
  Karayalcin announced that he will work on whether or not to 
start a negotiation process toward the unification of the 
leftist parties. He pointed out that he came together with 
Republican People's Party leader Deniz Baykal on Turkish Radio 
and television's "Firing Line" program today. The SDPP leader 
pointed out that he will meet with Baykal as soon as possible to 
assess the situation. 
  Karayalcin said that the SDPP does not posit any 
preconditions or expectations for the unification of the leftist 
parties. He said: I believe that no political project is as 
important as the unity of the left. 
  Asked if he would give up the SDPP leadership for the unity 
of the leftist parties, Karayalcin replied: Both as an 
individual and as a party we are ready to make every kind of 
sacrifice. 
  Replying to another question, Karayalcin said that the SDPP 
will work on the issue of possible changes in the SDPP wing of 
the cabinet. He added that the decision to be reached will not 
be his own personal decision.

<F P=106> [Article by Semih Idiz from the "Public Eye" column: "What </F>
the Welfare Party Victory Tells Us"] 
  [Text] What now? This is the question being asked by the 
large number of Turks who did not cast their ballots for the 
pro-Islamic Welfare Party (RP) that more or less doubled its 
support in Sunday's local elections gaining 18 percent of the 
overall vote. 
  The fear is that the important gains by the Islamites will 
in 
a short time translate into interference in the secular way of 
life that the majority of people in this country are used to. 
As they consolidate their foothold the Islamites will then turn 
to dismantling the principles of Kemalizm one by one, starting 
with laicism, this fear has it. 
  As for their final goal, it is believed this will be the 
institution of the Shari'ah, the all-encapsulating Islamic 
judicial code governing everything from a husband and wives 
behaviour in bed to the conduct of international relations. 
There can be no doubt that there are elements within the RP who 
would be more than delighted to see all of this come about. 
Even statements by the RP leader Necmettin Erbakan can be 
interpreted as pointing to the fact that he too would wish such 
an outcome eventually. 
  It is however equally evident that the RP will not want to 
endanger its victory on Sunday from day one. This is a cool and 
calculating party that has worked hard both at the top and at 
the bottom to get the outcome it has gotten. 
  It mobilized tens of thousands of young men and women in a 
door to door campaign which highlighted concrete rather than 
"spiritual" issues. 
  In its campaign the RP capitalized to the full the anger 
among the public resulting from the incompetence and corruption 
of current local administrators. 
  It promised to bring concrete solution to concrete problems 
ranging from air pollution to the environment, from the price of 
bread to city transportation. 
  The first statements by victorious RP candidates show that 
these are the issues they will concentrate on initially. In 
order to allay a major fear among the public they have even 
indicated that they will not revoke alcohol licences--considered 
the litmus test for RP--that have already been issued, although 
they admit they will not issue new ones. All this indicates 
that this Party has no intention of scaring away timid people 
whose support it has gained for social reasons and whose votes 
have been effective in the RP victory. Especially when it will 
want to consolidate its position prior to the general elections 
in the fall of 1996. 
  This is why we are hearing a lot of: "don't be afraid we are 
not as bad as the opposition says we are" type of statements 
emanating from new RP mayors. 
  It must also be remembered of course, that the RP also 
tapped 
the anger of a predominantly conservative society in the face of 
images of unchecked hedonism by a rich minority. 
  An anti-aesthetic minority whose ugly Bacchanalian and 
corrupt antics were persistently presented in the mass media as 
if it was representative and the sign of social advancement. 
[sentence as published] In this respect it is wrong to say 
that spiritual and moral considerations did not play any role in 
these elections and in the RP victory. 
  On the other hand, the images, highlighting the behavior of 
this ill-educated newly rich segment of society, churned out day 
in day out by the press and private televisions were a main 
instrument contributing to the conservative backlash. The fact 
is that the press and television in Turkey have contributed 
hardly anything to cultural and educational awareness choosing 
instead to go down the path of least resistance by exploiting 
basic instincts. 
  This press and television however is now in a state of near 
panic because "the Islamites are coming." 
  The media in Turkey refuses to see that it has come to 
represent the cultural, moral and ethical decay that 
conservative elements have objected to so strongly. It has also 
come to represent for intellectuals the "anti-culture" of a 
decaying new rich bourgeoisie which abused its social privileges 
to the hilt. 
  Regardless of where they stand politically the 
establishment parties, including those on the left, also 
pandered to the whims of this new rich element and its press and 
media, thinking somehow that this would enhance their power. 
  On top of all this where they could they also took their 
"pick of the readies" [money] that an increasing corrupt system 
was laying on their path. 
  This is what makes it conceivable today that people who 
generally voted for social democrats have now turned to the RP 
because of its social messages even though it is a religious 
based party. 
  Especially when the RP intentionally kept its social message 
in the foreground and its spiritual message in the background -- 
except, of course, where it needed this message to fortify its 
social message. 
  The main thing now is to try and interpret what is going on 
in a cool and calm manner. There is no need to panic. Neither 
is there a need to be complacent about anything. There is 
however a need to try and see things for what they really are. 
The first thing to realize is that Turkey is a complex country 
that does not lend itself to easy answers. Even if no one else 
is aware of this one can be sure that the RP is.... [ellipsis as 
published] 
  Mark the taxi driver who drove me to work this morning. He 
said he was a staunch supporter of the ultranationalist 
Nationalist Movement Party (MHP). 
  "I would never vote for the RP" he said "But I voted for 
Melih Gokcek (the RP's candidate for Ankara)." 
  He said he did not see this as a vote for the RP in the 
sense 
that he had opted for the candidate that had convinced him the 
most during the campaign about addressing Ankara's growing 
problems. 
  This is just one permutation. There must be thousands more, 
especially among those who switched from a social democratic 
vote to the RP. The RP is more than aware of this. 
  It is important now to note the warning the public has given 
the mainstream parties who have much time to mend their ways, to 
overcome their petty bickering and to serve the people for a 
change rather than serving themselves. 
  This is the only way to allay the "Islamic threat." But more 
than issuing a warning the RP victory has also signalled the 
unmistakable advent on the political scene of a new force in 
Turkish society which will have to be considered from now on. 
  The RP victory will inevitably catalyze a new social 
contract 
in this country whose ethnic, religious, and sectarian divisions 
are becoming more apparent as time goes on. 
  The social contract will have to of necessity be based on 
democratic ideals in order for all to have their breathing space. 
  It will have to prove to all the parties to it that 
maintaining the whole is to the advantage of all of them 
individually. 
  This is the challenge facing the country and its 
legislators. 
Shallow commentators in the Turkish media who have contributed 
nothing to enhancing the awareness of the public, and who are 
now panic stricken because their "cushy life styles" appear to 
be threatened are not aware of this. 
  Their complacency did not permit them to see what was on the 
horizon and now they are screaming for help. But there is no 
succor for them. 
  Perhaps they will now see that the basis of a new social 
balance of power is being laid in Turkey and act accordingly. 
Hopefully this will also lead them to exercising some 
intelligence to ensure that the overall democratic system is 
strengthened in a manner that prevents it from becoming the tool 
of one segment of society or another.

<F P=106> [Announcer-read report over still of President Suleyman </F>
Demirel] 
  [Text] President Suleyman Demirel has stated that the 
consistent and determined policies of NATO since its 
establishment play an important role during the last years 
regarding the great, historical changes taking place in Europe. 
In a message he issued for the 45th anniversary of the NATO's 
establishment, Demirel stated that NATO is still the main 
guarantee regarding the security and defense of member countries. 
  Demirel pointed out that the historical developments of the 
last couple of years created an optimism within public opinion 
and international political circles that peace and stability 
would be achieved in a short time. However, Demirel added, not 
before long a sad and realistic picture replaced this optimistic 
mood. This sad and realistic picture was created by the threats 
to Europe and its environs. These threats included policies 
based on annexing territories, ethnic separatism, and clashes 
which emerged from minority issues. Demirel indicated that all 
the countries are in agreement that NATO, which took significant 
steps toward applying itself to these new conditions, will play 
an important role in establishing and perpetuating peace and 
stability. 
  Commenting on the NATO-Turkey relations in his message, 
Demirel said: Turkey's joining NATO in 1952 was an important 
step taken as part of Turkey's national foreign policy since its 
establishment. Within this understanding and awareness, Turkey 
has become a secure and trustworthy alliance fulfilling -- with 
great sacrifices -- the responsibilities stipulated by the 
alliance. Turkey always placed solidarity to the alliance in 
the foreground. Turkey will continue on the same understanding 
and approach.

<F P=106> [By Serdar Turgut: "Clinton Objects to Delivery of Tanker </F>
Aircraft at the Last Moment" -- punctuation as published] 
  [Text] Washington--President Clinton has ordered the 
suspension of the delivery of U.S. tanker aircraft to Turkey at 
the last moment. The tanker aircraft would have increased the 
operational range of Turkey's military aircraft. The 
development, which even surprised the U.S. State Department 
officials, was the result of the significant pressure the Greek 
lobby in Washington put on President Clinton. It will be 
recalled that Prime Minister Tansu Ciller persistently insisted 
on Turkey acquiring several U.S. tanker aircraft in order to 
increase the operational range of its military planes. 
<H5>  Warning to Clinton </H5>
  The leading members of the Greek lobby, who were 
disappointed 
by Washington's decision to recognize The Former Yugoslav 
Republic of Macedonia [FYROM], warned Clinton that: "We shall 
withdraw our support for you if you continue to adopt decisions 
against us." 
  President Clinton had to yield to the Greek lobby's pressure 
when his adviser, George Stephanopoulos, who is of Greek origin, 
advised him to keep in line with the Greek lobby's demands. 
Later, Clinton instructed the U.S. State Department and the 
Pentagon to "suspend the delivery of tanker aircraft to Turkey." 
He also informed his close associates as follows: "We already 
have a problem with Greece on matters related to the FYROM. Let 
us not allow the tanker aircraft issue to become another 
problem." 
  The developments that forced Clinton to make that decision 
began on 9 March when he received Archbishop Iakovos, head of 
the Greek Orthodox Church, and 14 members of the Greek lobby, 
including Senator Paul Sarbanes, who supports Greece in the U.S. 
Congress. The Greek lobbyists asked to meet President Clinton 
after he disclosed that the United States would recognize the 
FYROM. Vice President Al Gore and National Security Adviser 
Anthony Lake attended the meeting. The delegation maintained a 
very firm approach and urged President Clinton to reconsider. 
It also accused the U.S. State Department of systematically 
acting against Greece and supporting Turkey. 
  The Greek lobbyists recalled Washington's decision to supply 
several tanker aircraft to Turkey. They said: "The delivery of 
tanker aircraft, which will enable the Turkish military aircraft 
to refuel in flight, constitutes a move hostile to Greece." 
  President Clinton disclosed at the end of the meeting that 
he 
had decided to postpone his decision to recognize the FYROM. 
Shortly after his back down on this decision, he suspended the 
delivery of tanker aircraft to Turkey.

<F P=106> [Report by Emin Varol: "Golhan: Vigilance Against Greece"] </F>
  [Text] Ankara--National Defense Minister Mehmet Golhan has 
said that Turkey must be vigilant, because Greek Prime Minister 
Andreas Papandreou may decide to make a frenzied move. 
  While waiting with his wife to cast his vote, Golhan replied 
to several questions in a public opinion poll on allergy tests. 
A SABAH correspondent asked him about the agreement between 
Greece and south Cyprus to cooperate on defense. Golhan said: 
"Papandreou won the election by describing Turkey as Greece's 
target. He feels he must do something now. He is 80. He may 
make a frenzied move. It will be useful to remain vigilant. 
Considering that agreement, we are taking the necessary 
measures." 
  Asked another question, Golhan said that Greece is less 
popular than any of the other members of the European Union. 
Stressing that Turkey will dispatch 2,700 troops to 
Bosnia-Herzegovina, Golhan asserted: "But Turkey has received 
no official UN document on the issue. The UN Security Council 
has adopted a resolution but Turkey has received no official 
document." 
  Golhan also asserted that General Cevik Bir, former 
commander 
of the Turkish troops in Somalia, will not be assigned to 
command the Turkish military units in Bosnia-Herzegovina. He 
said: "Gen. Bir will not be assigned to the job. He has 
fulfilled his mission in Somalia. Others wish to be assigned 
similar duties. Naturally, such missions are linked with 
qualifications and promotions."

<F P=106> [Report by Ugur Akinci] </F>
  [Text] Washington, D.C.--Mahmut Kilinc, Democracy Party 
(DEP) Adiyaman deputy, has suggested the Cyprus model as a 
solution to the Kurdish problem during his visit to Washington. 
Kilinc, who paid a visit to the U.S. State Department as well 
as holding talks with Sen. Claiborne Pell (Democrat-Rhode 
Island), chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, and 
Rep. Lee H. Hamilton (Democrat-Indiana), chairman of the House 
Foreign Affairs Committee, said the Clinton administration was 
very interested in the Kurdish issue and that they were trying 
to understand what's exactly going on in southeastern Turkey. 
  Kilinc talked to the Turkish Journalists during the 35th 
annual convention of the International Studies Association in 
Washington Hilton. Accompanying Kilinc were some members of the 
Kurdish community in the United States and representatives of 
the American Kurdish Information Network (AKIN). 
  Kilinc said he asked the Americans to facilitate the process 
to find a solution to the Kurdish problem in Turkey. "Without 
solving the Kurdish problem, Turkey can solve none of its other 
problems," Kilinc said. 
  When asked if the U.S. officials put forward any concrete 
proposals, Kilinc said that they did not make any comments on 
the situation and their main interest at this point was to 
gather information. 
<H5>  "Turkey Applied Political Solution in Cyprus" </H5>
  When reminded that the U.S. State Department has already 
spelled out a "political solution" to end the conflict in the 
Southeast, Kilinc said that such a political solution is not 
alien to Turkey since it was already put to practice in Cyprus. 
"What Turkey defends in Cyprus should also be put into practice 
in Turkey," Kilinc said. 
  When the TURKISH DAILY NEWS [TDN] asked Kilinc if a 
"bi-zonal 
federation" is what he was referring to by the term "Cyprus 
model," Kilinc confirmed it but said that a federation need not 
be just between Turks and Kurds. 
  "What's important is the recognition of Kurdish identity and 
its preservation by legal sanctions and measures. Yet we should 
not insist on any given rigid format. It could be federation or 
maybe not. What's important is to bring this issue onto our 
agenda and discuss it. They have federations elsewhere in the 
West and it works. I like the American federal system, for 
example. I think it's wonderful. So is the German federation." 
  When a Turkish Journalist reminded Kilinc that the American 
and German federations were not based on ethnic divisions and 
that such an ethnic-based federation might lead Turkey to 
disaster, Kilinc said that Turkey could adopt a different 
geographic principle and end up "let's say, with seven or eight 
federations." 
  "A rigid two-part system is not necessary," Kilinc said and 
reemphasized the need for discussing everything openly. 
<H5>  Explaining Refah Victory </H5>
  TDN asked Kilinc to explain the recent election victory of 
the fundamentalist Refah Party (RP) in the Southeast where 
Kurdish national sentiment is assumed to be dominant. Kilinc 
said that DEP was forced to pull out from the elections due to 
the bombing of DEP offices and murder and harassment of DEP 
deputies and sympathizers. "Refah won because in the last Refah 
General Convention (RP leader) Erbakan declared that when in 
power they would recognize the linguistic and cultural autonomy 
of the Kurdish people. 
  The message was not lost on the Kurdish electorate. When DEP 
candidates couldn't run, all their votes shifted to the RP. If 
we were in the elections, Refah could not win even a single 
province in the Southeast." 
  Kilinc added that he did not approve of the Refah Party and 
what it stands for. "Refah won only 14 percent of the votes in 
Diyarbakir. In other southeastern cities about 50 percent did 
not vote. This goes to show that Refah's support is not that 
overwhelming and that DEP could have won the elections in the 
Southeast if it participated," Kilinc added. "If we entered the 
elections and won, the government would have somebody to talk to 
on the Kurdish issue. Now they have no counterpart." 
<H5>  "If I Criticize the PKK, I Can't Go Back to Adiyaman" </H5>
  When asked why he did not condemn PKK's terrorist acts, 
Kilinc said that to speak out openly against the PKK would 
jeopardize his function as a "catalyst." "The PKK is an 
objective phenomenon. It's outside my determination. It is 
outside anybody else's wishes. It;s simply out there. Therefore 
we have to consider the existing conditions and act accordingly. 
If I criticize the PKK today, I can't go back to Adiyaman. And 
what would that accomplish, really? I'm a catalyst. We have to 
be rational on this issue." 
  Kilinc will return to Turkey next Tuesday after undergoing 
surgery to correct an eye problem.

  [Text] Ankara -- The governor of the eastern province of 
Agri said on Thursday [31 March] that Iran was cooperating with 
Turkey against separatist terrorists and delivering them "dead 
or alive" to Turkish officials after military operations. 
  Agri governor Dogan Hatipoglu told the semiofficial Anatolia 
news agency that militants of the outlawed Kurdistan Workers 
Party (PKK) were infiltrating into Turkey over the Iranian 
border but that lately modern physical barriers put up on the 
border and better security measures had reduced this traffic. 
Noting that they had a dialogue with Iran on security issues, 
Hatipoglu said "we have seen this dialogue work out. Iran was 
previously claiming that the PKK did not exist in its territory 
but changed this view after talks and seeing documentation. Now 
they are also struggling against the PKK with their own forces. 
  ``They have returned some terrorists either dead of alive.'' 
[paragraphing as published] Hatipoglu said Turkey was extremely 
pleased over Iran's attitude and called on other neighboring 
countries to take a similar approach as well. 
  Meanwhile, officials in Sirnak province said on Thursday 
that 
the number of people killed when a passenger minibus hit a mine 
on a bridge in southeast Turkey on Wednesday had reached fifteen. 
  The officials said the vehicle was on a country road bridge 
near the town of Idil, in Sirnak province, when it hit the mine. 
They said the mine was planted by PKK militants and one person 
was wounded.

  [Text] It has been discovered that relations between the 
Workers Party of Kurdistan [PKK] and Athens have been strained 
by reports that the PKK has taken armed action against several 
targets in Greece and south Cyprus. Reports that Theofilos 
Yeoryiadhis, a PKK agent in south Cyprus who was recently 
murdered, was shot and killed by PKK militants and not by the 
Turkish Intelligence Organization have prompted Greek officials 
to change the direction of their investigation. 
  It is believed that Yeoryiadhis, who described himself as an 
enemy of the Turks and has acted as the PKK contact in south 
Cyprus since 1979, split from that organization two months ago. 
He was killed by PKK militants, who secretly arrived in south 
Cyprus, for failing to heed the PKK's threats. 
  Meanwhile, the PKK reportedly sabotaged the tourist ship 
Athina-Palace in the Port of Piraievs last week. The ship was 
destroyed by fire. The cause of the incident has not yet been 
established. The ship was scheduled to leave Greece for Izmir 
and Kusadasi after calling at several Greek islands in the 
Aegean Sea the day after it was destroyed by fire. It has been 
claimed that the PKK decided to prevent Greek passenger ships 
from visiting Turkey and placed an incendiary bomb in the 
Athina-Palace. The explosive was to detonate when the ship 
entered the Port of Izmir. However, it detonated prematurely 
and the ship was destroyed by fire in Greece.

  The colonialist Turkish Republic tried to prevent our people

<F P=106> [Unattributed article: "European Commission Concerned Over </F>
Kantor Report"] 
  [Text] (ANSA) Brussels, April 5 -- The European Commission 
on Tuesday [5 April] expressed its concern over what it saw as 
threats of sanctions against the European Union [EU] implied in 
the report drawn up by United States trade representative Mickey 
Kantor on alleged trade obstacles and said it would reply 
point-by-point to the charges made against the European Union in 
its own report. 
  Speaking to the press here, an official spokesman for the 
European Union executive added how this year the report from the 
U.S. trade representative was much better than previous years in 
the sense that there was less criticism of the European Union 
and even recognition that many problems between the United 
States and the European Union had been resolved over the past 
months. This is also due to the end of the Uruguay Round 
negotiations to renew the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade 
(GATT) which governs world trade. 
  At the same time, the spokesman stressed how the European 
Commission remain concerned over the threats implied in the 
Kantor report, in particular those of sanctions in the field of 
public contracts and the safeguarding of intellectual property.

<F P=106> [EC press release No. IP/94/271: "Humanitarian Aid to the </F>
Occupied Territories"] 
  [Text] The European Commission has decided to allocate 
emergency humanitarian aid of ECU2,300,000 for the Palestinian 
population of the occupied territories. In the aftermath of the 
massacre at Hebron's al-Ibrahimi Mosque, most of the occupied 
territories were for a time under extended curfews; this 
resulted in a sharp drop in economic activity and considerable 
disruption to regular essential food supplies. 
  To alleviate this situation, UNRWA [United Nations Relief 
and 
Works Agency] carried out an urgent distribution of food rations 
to some 75,000 families in the West Bank and 95,000 in the Gaza 
Strip. 
  The present allocation of the European Commission will pay, 
through ECHO [European Community Humanitarian Office], for a 
further 8,500 tonnes of flour for distribution by UNRWA to 
respond to the current needs of this emergency situation in the 
occupied territories.

<F P=106> [Unattributed article: "Brittan Explains Reasons For </F>
Supporting GATT "Social Clause"; as released by Brussels EUROPE] 
  [Excerpt] Speaking in the framework of a public hearing 
organised by the Parliamentary Committee on External Economic 
Relations of the European Parliament on "The Social Clause and 
International Trade: What Stakes?," the European Commissioner 
responsible for external economic relations, Sir Leon Brittan, 
stressed the "clear objective" of the European Commission to 
include social issues within the powers of the future World 
Trade Organisation (WTO). "The challenge today is not to decide 
whether or not to act in the social sphere, but how and when to 
do so"; this must not be interpreted as a protectionist measure 
as regards the less developed countries (for which cheap labour 
is a sizeable economic factor). "At Marakesh, I propose to make 
this clear, explaining why we are keen to include social issues 
on the agenda of the WTO," Sir Leon announced, considering that 
it will above all be a question of demonstrating that this is 
not motivated by "protectionism, self-interest or opportunism"; 
this is why safeguard mechanisms against protectionist abuses in 
this social clause will have to be set up. What mechanisms? 
According to the Commissioner, above all, this 
means: 

  -  Making sure that policy in this field is defined on 
the basis of multilateral dialogue, not only involving the 
developed countries, but also countries from the Third World 
which are most concerned by this problem; 
  -  Establishing objective 
criteria which will enable one to note whether a country is or 
is not respecting the political line agreed in social 
matters; 
  -  Setting a goal and introducing control and examination 
mechanisms for cases where some countries should be accused of 
acting against the agreed principles; 
  -  Making sure that any 
action in this field is compatible with the other international 
obligations agreed to by the community of States. Having said 
that it was "crucial" that these safeguard measures be spelt out 
within the new global trade structure "from the very outset," 
Sir Leon welcomed the proposal made by the trade unions 
consisting in considering the standards established by the 
International labour Organisation (ILO) in Geneva as being valid 
common criteria which could be discussed with the WTO. "This is 
no doubt along the lines of thought of the Commission," he said, 
as "pursuing the enforcement of ILO obligations worldwide is a 
long-held European priority. We pursue it because it is in 
principle right to do so, not because we expect material gain to 
result." 
<H5>  Reservations of Developing Countries </H5>
  The Chairman of the EP's Committee on External Economic 
Relations, Willy de Clercq, also pleaded in favour of including 
the social clause in the new rules and structures for world 
trade, considering that "freedom in trade, fair trade and the 
protection of human dignity are not incompatible concepts, on 
the contrary." The Philippines ambassador to the European Union 
and chairman of the ASEAN Committee in Brussels, Mr. Pedrosa, on 
the other hand, not only said that including the social clause 
in the rules of international trade was an "inappropriate 
remedy" ("we should rather be speaking of this in international 
social fora, like the ILO and UNICEF"), but also affirmed that 
it would be a "nontariff trade barrier and would be 
protectionist" which would be "imposed" on developing countries 
by developed ones. 
  Opposition by developing countries was moreover confirmed in 
Geneva where -- in the framework of the GATT work preparing the 
signing of the Uruguay Round accord -- work relating to the 
draft ministerial declaration to be approved in Marakesh on 15 
April was interrupted. The United States, indeed, wanted to 
include explicit references to the "social clause," which the 
developing countries refused. The GATT discussions on this 
aspect of the draft declaration will be resumed next week: the 
European Union has a more flexible position to the United 
States, in the sense that it would regard as sufficient that the 
social issue be inserted in the working programme of the future 
World Trade Organinsation. [passage omitted]

  [Text] Brussels, 31 Mar 94 (AGENCE EUROPE) -- Pursuant to 
the common foreign and security policy, the Council of the 
European Union published the following statement: "The European 
Union [EU] expresses its concern at the aggravation of the human 
rights situation in Turkey, including the lifting of the 
immunity of six deputies of the Turkish Democracy Party. It has 
repeatedly condemned terrorist acts in Turkey, but it believes 
that the fight against terrorism should be conducted within the 
law and with full respect for human rights. It further wishes to 
reiterate its appeal for a political solution of the problems in 
South Eastern Turkey. The EU wishes to underline that the right 
to express freely one's ideas and opinions is a fundamental 
freedom for all, and a fortiori for members of Parliament. It is 
enshrined in many international instruments, to which Turkey has 
subscribed. This right also forms the basis of the Parliamentary 
immunity of elected representatives in democratic States. The EU 
calls on the Turkish government to fulfil its earlier 
undertaking on constitutional reforms in the area of human 
rights."

<F P=106> [Unattributed article: "EU: Council Introduces Definitive </F>
Anti-Dumping Duty on Imports of Russian Isobutanol"; as released 
by Brussels EUROPE] 
  [Text] London, 31 Mar 94 (AGENCE EUROPE) -- As briefly 
indicated in yesterday's EUROPE, the Council has turned into a 
definitive anti-dumping duty the provisional duty introduced by 
the Commission in October on imports of isobutanol from Russia. 
During the additional inquiry, this measure was contested by 
the main industrial user of isobutanol (which is essentially 
used as a solvent in the paint and varnish industry), saying 
that: 

  -  Community producers of isobutanol have introduced a 
new production technique for oxo alcohols that use less 
isobutanol; the decline of Community production would be due to 
this technological change. The Commission replied that the 
isobutanol market contracted by 20 percent whereas the decline 
in Community production was nearly twice that (39.8 percent) and 
the use of capacities (after the reduction of installations) 
fell from 73.8 percent to 57.3 percent. The result is that, 
without denying the effects of the technological change, there 
remains a considerable negative effect caused by dumped 
imports; 
  -  Isobutanol represents a major proportion of its 
production costs for certain intermediate products made only in 
Italy and for the Italian market. For these products, the 
industrial user in question must face competition from producers 
in Austria, Poland and Hungary, which can continue to buy 
Russian isobutanol if no measure is taken against dumping. The 
Council agreed with the Commission's conclusions and approved 
the definitive anti-dumping duty at the same provisional duty of 
ECU102 a tonne. Nevertheless, the United Kingdom voted against 
it.

<F P=106> [David Sharrock report: "IRA Warns `You Will Be Glad To Get </F>
Out'"] 
  [Text] Belfast -- Sinn Fein's appeals for direct talks 
with the Government in return for a 72-hour ceasefire commencing 
at midnight tonight suffered a setback yesterday when IRA 
hard-liners warned that Britain would "be glad to get out of 
Ireland when our work is done." 
  The message was delivered by two masked, armed members of 
the 
IRA's Tyrone Brigade at an evening celebrating the Easter 
Rising, just hours after Gerry Adams and Martin McGuinness 
hinted that the republican movement would respond positively to 
renewed direct contacts between the Government and Sinn Fein. 
  Security chiefs in Belfast have meanwhile warned police and 
troops not to drop their guard before and immediately after the 
ceasefire ends. 
  The statement from the Tyrone Brigade boasted of the 
morale-boosting effects of the recent mortar attacks on Heathrow 
and claimed that the republican movement had never been in a 
better position to carry on its military campaign. 
  Hundreds listened as the statement was read in a hall near 
Cookstown, Co [County] Tyrone. One of the IRA men assumed a 
firing position holding a revolver above his head as another 
read it out: "The Tyrone brigade of the IRA extends its 
greetings to you, our loyal supporters and, most especially, to 
the families of our fallen comrades. Make no mistake about it, 
never before has the republican movement been stronger, more 
united or more confident. 
  "A few recent and unscheduled landings at Heathrow worked 
wonders for us all and it caused serious international 
embarrassment to the British government. As an army which lives 
and fights in the occupied zone, we state absolutely that the 
British will be glad to get out of Ireland when our work is 
done." 
  The mood of supporters at the event was buoyant, if almost 
victorious. "Why should we give in to the Brits when we are 
winning?" was a typical sentiment. 
  The display will be an embarrassment to the Sinn Fein 
leadership, which has been at pains to cultivate an image of 
flexibility and commitment to peace. While it could be 
interpreted as no more than reassurance to stalwarts that the 
leadership is not about to sell out, it may also appear to 
confirm Dublin's fears that Mr Adams is not capable of 
persuading sufficient numbers of the IRA to end violence and 
take the constitutional path. 
  Irish government sources yesterday indicated they did not 
expect a breakthrough by the weekend. 
  "There's not enough time in which anything could happen," 
said one source. 
  Mr Adams said yesterday that the Government could not just 
criticise or dismiss the IRA ceasefire without proposing an 
alternative. He was responding to a government statement which 
said Sinn Fein and the IRA knew exactly what was required to 
bring peace. They could deliver it if they chose. 
  Martin McGuinness, leading Sinn Fein executive member told a 
meeting in Derry: "It is my firm conviction that the IRA 
initiative is clearly an attempt to end the current stalemate 
around the issue of clarification and to move the peace process 
forward." 
  David Trimble, the Ulster Unionist MP for Upper Bann, told 
an 
Apprentice Boys rally in Lurgan that the IRA ceasefire was an 
attempt to lay the blame for the failure of the peace initiative 
on Downing Street. 
  He said the ceasefire fooled nobody. 
  "This so called ceasefire is only a manoeuvre. If all that 
Mr Adams could get from the hard men is three days then Mr Adams 
isn't worth much consideration." 
  Andrew Rodgers, the Moderator of the Presbyterian Church, 
called for Mr Adams to explain through the media exactly what 
clarification he needed, so that everyone could judge where the 
problem lay.

<F P=106> [Interview with Michael Heseltine, British secretary of </F>
state for trade and industry, by correspondent Nobuyuki Sakai in 
London on 2 April] 
  [Text] [Sakai] The United States has been pressing Japan 
to set numerical targets to rectify the trade imbalance. 
  [Heseltine] It is apparent that worsening relations between 
the two economic giants will bring benefits to nobody. 
Solutions to trade problems should be sought in GATT 
multilateral trade negotiations. I rate highly Japan's 
concessions in the GATT Uruguay Round of multilateral trade 
talks because they greatly contributed to the successful 
conclusion of the talks. 
  [Sakai] How do you assess Japan's market-opening efforts? 
  [Heseltine] Japan is still a protectionist nation. It 
should open its door wider to investments and trade. Its 
discriminatory tariffs on Scotch whisky is a good example. It 
is also very difficult for foreign companies to gain access to 
the Japanese trading market unless they are associated with 
major Japanese trading firms through capital participation. 
Japan entered the world market in the 1860's and integrated its 
more controlled society and culture with a capitalistic system. 
I think the capitalistic system in Japan is different from 
capitalism. 
  [Sakai] Do you meet opposition from bureaucrats to 
deregulation? 
  [Heseltine] Yes, some of them are opposed to deregulation. 
But we intend to keep intact regulations related to health care, 
the environment, and social affairs. What should be abolished 
are the regulations that prevent creativity and investments. It 
is also important for the administration to have bureaucrats 
constantly review their own structure according to changes. 
What politicians should decide is whether the government should 
promote deregulation while placing priority on the benefits of 
manufacturers or those of consumers and markets. 
  [Sakai] Against the wishes of Honda Motor Company, British 
Rover Group is to be acquired by BMW of Germany. 
  [Heseltine] I understand how Honda feels. But the future 
success of Rover Group will be advantageous to Honda in auto 
parts supply. I hope other parts suppliers also should not have 
negative feeling. Forty-one percent of Japan's entire 
investments in Europe are made in Britain. Japanese companies 
are welcomed here. I think they are fully aware of their 
capability to manufacture competitive products. 
  [Sakai] The sale of Rover Group to BMW means that Britain 
entrusts automobile production to a foreign country. 
  [Heseltine] Britain has also a large share in possessions 
and management of major European companies. Industrial 
nationalism is now less important compared to the past.

<F P=106> [Editorial: "Back to Essex"] </F>
  [Text] Nobody who stayed up to watch the April 1992 
general election results will be able to forget the mixture of 
astonishment and elation on the face of David Amess as the 
returning officer for Basildon announced that he, the 
Conservative candidate, had won. It was the first indication 
that, despite all the polling evidence, the Tories were set to 
capture their fourth general election in a row. The voters of 
Essex had spoken. 
  Yesterday John Major returned to speak to them. Visiting 
Basildon and Harlow, the citadels of Essex man and woman, the 
Prime Minister was clearly hoping to trade on his personal 
rapport with the electorate, the soapbox strategy that many 
believe won his party the last election against all the odds. 
What better way, his advisers must have told him, to show up 
the few remaining advantages he still possesses over his chief 
rivals, Kenneth Clarke and Michael Heseltine? Whatever can be 
said of them, neither has been miserably unemployed. Neither 
can understand from personal experience what many people have 
gone through, particularly in the South of England, during this 
last recession. 
  The difficulty for Mr Major is that no amount of charm, 
friendliness or empathy can make up for the patent inadequacies 
of his record and that of his Government since that surprise 
general election victory. He arrived in Essex on the day that 
taxes on both incomes and spending were due to rise, brought in 
by a party that not only promised to cut taxes at the last 
election but scared voters away from voting Labour by predicting 
the very tax "bombshell" that is now about to be dropped. 
  And those tax rises are necessary because the Conservatives, 
possibly in the belief that they were likely to lose the 
election, spent taxpayers' money in 1991-92 as if there was no 
tomorrow. The tomorrow has become today, and taxpayers are 
being asked to pay off the Government's debts. They are also 
paying for the Governments economic incompetence in prolonging 
the recession unnecessarily by clinging to membership of the ERM 
[Exchange Rate Mechanism]. 
  Will the voters of Essex forgive him? He should not take 
their loyalty for granted. The Conservatives have won four 
elections in a row mainly thanks to people like them. They 
voted Labour until 1979, but switched when they saw that the 
Tories under Margaret Thatcher seemed to have their interests at 
heart. They bought council houses, started new businesses, 
profited from tax cuts and generally prospered in the 1980s. 
  Now many of them have had houses repossessed, seen their 
businesses go bankrupt, are paying higher taxes and remember 
prosperity as but a distant dream. They are not tribal Tories; 
if Labour seems to be offering them a better deal at the next 
general election, there are no historical or familial ties to 
deter them from switching. 
  Hardline Essex voters, and others like them, thought at the 
last party conference that their concerns were at last being 
addressed. For years they had made their populist points at the 
rostrum while the platform listened politely but ignored their 
pleas. Last October they seemed to have spurred a desperate 
Cabinet into action. Law and order was to be toughened, basics 
were back on the political agenda and the march of European 
federalism was to be stopped. 
  What do they now see? There is a Home Secretary stumbling 
from one pitfall to another on his Criminal Justice Bill; a 
back-to-basics programme that has destroyed the careers of too 
many ministers and now lies in tatters; and a Prime Minister who 
promises to stand up to his European partners one week but backs 
down the next. Mr Major's courage in visiting Essex cannot be 
faulted. But, true to form, he chose a battleground on which he 
never had a chance of winning.

  [Text] Bonn -- The leader of the Free Democratic Party of 
Germany [FDP], Klaus Kinkel, has again called on the members of 
his party to make the independence of liberal policies clearer 
vis-a-vis the Christian Democratic Union/Christian Social Union 
[CDU/CSU] and the Social Democratic Party of Germany [SPD] 
during the upcoming election campaigns. "Whereas the 
conservatives and the SPD used to be worlds apart, Labor 
Minister Bluem and SPD social affairs expert Dressler are 
congenial brothers," Kinkel stated in the party organ LIBERAL 
DISPATCH (April edition). 
  The FDP leader spoke in favor of more privatization and 
deregulation in the economy. As a "counterforce" to the Greens, 
the FDP must clearly support nuclear energy as a "transitional 
energy," it must promote biotechnology and genetic engineering, 
and reject general speed limits, Kinkel pointed out. Moreover, 
his party should "vigorously advocate its role as the party 
ensuring the rule of law" and support performance elites in 
Germany. 
  It is particularly important "for the FDP to be noticed both 
because of what it does and because of the way it does things," 
Kinkel continued. Credibility and style have become central 
political messages. "Politicians may make mistakes, but they 
cannot afford everything," the FPD leader stressed.

  [Text] Bonn -- According to the defense expert of the Free 
Democratic Party [FDP], Juergen Koppelin, the Bundeswehr White 
Paper, which was officially presented to the public today, is 
"poetry rather than a clear description of the future course of 
the German Armed Forces." The future development of the 
Bundeswehr remains "vague or has been described with concepts 
containing old thinking," Koppelin stressed. The Federal 
Association of German Industry [BDI], however, welcomed the 
statements on the preservation of defense technology. The 
cabinet adopted the "White Paper 1994" on 15 March. Defense 
Minister Volker Ruehe (Christian Democratic Union) then 
announced that the Bundeswehr plans to establish forces for 
crisis operations within the framework of the United Nations. 
  The White Paper presents the concept of the Federal 
Government's security and defense policy. It is the first such 
document in the united Germany. The previous White Paper was 
published in 1985. Koppelin pointed out that adhering to a 
Bundeswehr strength of 370,000 is hardly suitable for an 
unbiased discussion of the future of the Bundeswehr. These 
figures are "wishful thinking and do not correspond to reality." 
As early as by the end of this year, the Bundeswehr will be 
reduced to 345,000 soldiers as a result of austerity measures, 
he stressed. The Armed Forces are in an alarming situation. 
The motivation, the training, and the equipment of the soldiers 
must be assessed very critically. "The White Paper presented by 
Ruehe could hardly have been more contradictory." 
  The BDI stressed that the White Paper makes clear the 
significance of a modern efficient and competitive national 
defense industry as an essential element of Germany's 
reliability as an alliance partner. On the basis of the 
prospects for the equipment of the Bundeswehr mentioned in the 
White Paper, industry must receive reliable planning data, and 
sufficient funds for investments must be made available. There 
must be an end to the drastic reductions in the defense budget 
and the lack of funds. 
  During the presentation of the White Paper on 15 March, 
Ruehe 
explained the poor financial situation of the Bundeswehr and 
announced a further reduction of the army. He did not mention 
figures. The minister wants to present his ideas at the end of 
April on the occasion of the presentation of the "conceptional 
guidelines" for the Bundeswehr which are to initiate a reform of 
the armed forces. Newspapers reported about "model 
calculations," speaking of a peacetime strength of the 
Bundeswehr of "between 300,000 and 360,000 men." The White 
Paper points out that important projects must be given up 
because of the poor financial situation. Ruehe stressed 
explicitly that compulsory military service will not be 
abandoned.

  [Text] Munich (DPA) -- Hans-Peter Stihl, president of the 
Federation of German Chambers of Industry and Commerce [DIHT], 
has warned against rushing the enlargement of the European Union 
[EU] toward the East. The economic differences between the EU 
countries and the former East Bloc countries, such as Poland or 
Hungary, are still dramatically big, Stihl said on Bavarian 
Radio on Easter Sunday. In the next 10 years it will be 
unthinkable to accept these countries as full members into the 
EU. Until then, such a development could be initiated through 
associate membership agreements. 
  Moreover, the EU must now gather its strength for the 
planned 
enlargement by another four countries. Over the next few years, 
the EU will be tied up with creating an economic, and maybe even 
a political, community. With a view to Brussels, Stihl 
criticized the EU's interventionism in trade issues. Bilateral 
agreements with individual countries, such as the recent new 
agreement with Japan on car exports, would encumber free trade, 
Stihl concluded.

  [Text] Osnabrueck (DPA) -- The Christian Democratic Union 
[CDU]/Christian Social Union [CSU] does not think that halting 
arms deliveries to Turkey, which is no longer ruled out by 
Foreign Minister Klaus Kinkel (Free Democratic Party), either, 
is a sufficient response to the basic problem of the 
relationship between Turkey and the West. In an interview with 
NEUE OSNABRUECKER ZEITUNG (Wednesday edition), Karl Lamers, 
foreign policy spokesman of the CDU/CSU Bundestag group, 
stressed that membership in the European Union, which Turkey is 
striving for, is becoming increasingly impossible in view of 
Turkey's way of dealing with the Kurdish problem. 
  Of course, it would place a serious strain on German-Turkish 
relations if it could be proved that German weapons are used 
against the Kurds. From the moral point of view and because of 
the Turkish Government's promise to the contrary, it would then 
certainly be justified to stop arms deliveries. On the other 
hand, Germany would thus give up any possibility to influence 
Turkey and its behavior toward the Kurds. Therefore, the 
Kurdish problem can be solved only by political means, by having 
us and others convince Turkey that there cannot be any solution 
without, at least, far-reaching cultural autonomy. "The 
excessive use of weapons against parts of the Turkish people is 
a bad thing -- no matter where the weapons come from," Lamers 
stressed.

  [Text] Stuttgart (DPA) -- The Media Trade Union has 
reacted with dismay to the assassination of German journalist 
Lissy Schmidt. A statement of the Main Executive Board on 
Tuesday [5 April] says that, according to the trade union's 
information, Schmidt investigated inroads of the Turkish 
military and intelligence service on the territory of northern 
Iraq. The 35-year-old photographer, member of the Media Trade 
Union, and her Kurdish companion had been shot in an ambush in 
the northern Iraqi part of Kurdistan on Sunday. 
  The Media Trade Union appealed again to the Turkish 
Government to guarantee the protection of journalists who 
exercise their occupation in Kurdistan and their free and 
unhindered reporting. It called on the Foreign Ministry in Bonn 
to request the Turkish Government to observe the freedom of the 
press.

<F P=106> [Unattributed article: "NATO: Fabbri on 45th Anniversary </F>
of Alliance"] 
  [Text] (ANSA) Rome, April 2 -- Today marks the 45th 
anniversary of the Atlantic Pact, the signing of which united 
the nations of Western Europe and of North America in their 
determination "to defend freedom and democracy from the looming 
threat of a new totalitarianism", Italian Defense Minister Fabio 
Fabbri wrote in a message to the Armed Forces on this occasion. 
  After underscoring that this Atlantic choice had created "a 
community of ideals and of interests which allowed our nations 
to progress in prosperity and in security", Fabbri added that 
the European nations, "lacerated by war, found in NATO a 
decisive element for overcoming ancient divisions and for 
establishing strong mutual confidence". 
  For Fabbri, even in the new European geo-political context 
which, he stressed, to a great extent was itself "the fruit of 
Atlantic policies in the face of the totalitarianism's 
challenges", NATO has confirmed its "indispensable role of 
defense and as a factor of security and peace". 
  He recalled the fundamental contribution made by the accords 
for nuclear and conventional disarmament, the stabilizing 
effects of the opening to the new democracies of central and 
eastern Europe, and the missions carried out in Bosnia and in 
the Adriatic for the United Nations. 
  The Italian armed forces, which for four decades have been 
an 
active and dedicated part of the Atlantic military instrument, 
will continue to provide their decisive contribution to NATO, 
taking part in the common defense and in peace missions, Fabbri 
continued in his message. Furthermore, those Atlantic values 
which were at the base of Italy's choices for civilization and 
peace will find themselves ever more grounded and ever more 
suffused within Italian society, he concluded.

<F P=106> [Unattributed article: "Bossi: League Must Set Terms; </F>
Pannella: Stop Squabbling"] 
  [Text] (ANSA) Pontedilegno, Italy, April 2 -- Northern 
League leader Umberto Bossi today declared that his movement 
"must be in a position" to set the terms for coming changes as 
another ally of Forza Italia's Silvio Berlusconi said if the 
struggle on the victorious right is not stopped, it would be 
better to return to the polls. 
  Bossi, the pivotal figure in Berlusconi's Freedom Front 
alliance keeping the nation guessing on a government-formation 
timetable five days after the watershed general election, said 
the swing to the right was "horizontal, and not vertical. We 
want a vertical shift, towards federalism" and reiterated his 
opposition to businessman Berlusconi in the premier's office. 
  Speaking at a mountain retreat here, near the northern city 
of Brescia, the League leader said in talks in Rome Wednesday [6 
April], after the holiday break, the agenda will be topped by 
federalism and that debate must be extended to "all the 
political parties because I want to listen closely to what these 
people have to say, on the platforms and not on chit-chat." 
  "I have to get a good understanding of the room there is for 
a constituent government, which I feel is essential, and I want 
precise guarantees for forming it. From now until April 15 we 
have to use the time available to us well," he added with 
reference to the date for convening the new Parliament of the 
twelfth legislature of the republic. 
  After reviewing the steps leading to the naming of a 
premier- 
designate by Head of State Oscar Luigi Scalfaro, Bossi said he 
did not "give a damn" about receiving the mandate he could 
possibly claim as the leader of the party which captured 176 
seats in the new Parliament compared to Forza Italia's 142. 
  On the distribution of portfolios, he declared, "The League 
doesn't need anything. We don't want to be sold for what we are 
not. We have struggled so hard to change the country because we 
believe in freedom. We're certainly not Berlusconi's bag boys." 
  Among the options open, he added, is League support from the 
outside for a government, with no direct League involvement with 
the executive. 
  Summing things up in the wake of the vote, Bossi spoke of a 
left "clinging to the defense of party power and state industry" 
and, on the other side, "the Freedom Front where there is a 
Berlusconi attempting to salvage the duopoly he was part of and 
there is the National Alliance, which is opposed to federalism," 
he said with reference to the neo-Fascist formation which 
flanked Berlusconi's Forza Italia in the south. 
  He said he still had to talk with the National Alliance. "I 
want to see if they are able to vote for federalism with the 
problems they have within. So there are two poles which are not 
associated." 
  He went on to say, "We maintain that a constituent 
government 
is needed and to have guarantees, we have said there must be a 
League man. We cannot give in on this point. I repeat, 
Berlusconi cannot be premier." 
  "This is the situation, then everybody can embroider on this 
as they want. Moreover, in this country there is the problem of 
ethics with the newspapers and television. There are people who 
have too much power in the media and we have always fought this 
situation," he added with reference to Berlusconi's Fininvest 
empire which controls publishing companies and three television 
networks, aside from retailing, real estate and other interests. 
  In Rome today, another potential government partner, 
ex-Radical Marco Pannella, said if fighting within the Freedom 
Front is not wound down, it would be better to schedule new 
general elections, and warned against depleting the "clarity" of 
the outcome of the vote. 
  According to Pannella, a new government must be ready and 
waiting in the wings for the inaugural session of the new 
Parliament, he declared in a statement to his Pannella Club, 
which he took to the conservative camp when the League and Forza 
Italia agreed to back his referendum proposals to dismantle the 
unions and unemployment benefits provisions as well as to 
de-regulate the licensing of retail outlets. 
  With his six deputies in the Lower House and two senators, 
Pannella reiterated today that voters who cast ballots for his 
candidates intended to introduce a "fourth pole" to the new 
government. "This left tried and failed. It's time to begin 
again. We can be the lever for the formation of a democratic 
party," he added. 
  Fielding questions, one of which was on him being touted as 
foreign minister in the new cabinet, Pannella quipped brightly, 
"I'm even ready to become premier." 
  Also speaking out today was the former Northern League 
secretary in Genoa, Bruno Ravena, who declared to Bossi: "Your 
attitude these days reminds me of the whole trash can I thought 
we had put behind us" and urged him to "sit down at a table and 
negotiate for a government platform in conformity with what the 
voters expect." 
  Ravera, who was fired by Bossi when a Progressive candidate 
was swept into the mayor's office in city elections in November, 
argued, "The people of Italy want your League, Forza Italia and 
the National Alliance to rule together and do not approve of the 
unseemly spectacle you, at this time, are giving with an 
attitude which recalls the dangerous power games of the parties 
just buried." 
  Gianfranco Fini, the neo-Fascist MSI [Italian Social 
Movement] leader who changed his party's name to National 
Alliance in time for the elections, today told Bossi: "You can 
meet whoever you want, and say and do whatever you want, but 
remember that talk is zero and the electoral campaign is over." 
  Responding to the League leader's latest foray, Berlusconi's 
other essential ally argued, "Bossi's activism only hides the 
embarrassment of the League leader who is attempting to show 
that everything depends exclusively on him." 
  Referring to the League's showing in nation-wide 
proportional 
voting Sunday [27 March] and Monday, Fini said, "He who 
represents 8 to 9 percent cannot presume to impose federalism, 
first of all, on everyone. When he is ready for quiet debate, 
at that point we can verify if it is possible to give rise to a 
government in harmony with the electoral choices of the 
Italians." 
  The leader quoted in today's edition of LA STAMPA as saying, 
"Mussolini is the greatest statesman of the century" went on to 
note that there is more to Italy than Bossi's northern 
stronghold, that "government platforms have to be agreed to, 
with balance, without childishness, without prime donne, without 
pre-conceived positions." 
  Government formation must go forward, he added, "especially 
with the certainty that whoever takes on responsibility for 
pitting pride against the requirements of the nation is certain 
to pay the consequences." 
  Fini concluded his remarks in Rome by underscoring the need 
for the victorious right, which includes his field of 148 
successful candidates now in the new Parliament, to "exploit in 
the best of ways for economic recovery the confidence in the 
monetary and financial markets shown in the Italian political 
shift."

<F P=106> [Unattributed article: "Conciliatory Tone in Midst of </F>
Turmoil on the Right"] 
  [Text] (ANSA) Rome, April 5 -- The Northern League 
visionary, Senator Gianfranco Miglio, sounded a conciliatory 
note today following the harsh exchange yesterday between Silvio 
Berlusconi of Forza Italia and League leader Umberto Bossi, the 
major beneficiaries of the shift to the right in last week's 
general elections. 
  Miglio explained that Bossi, "within the League, has always 
used harsh language, violent. But he has often followed attacks 
by hugs," declared the senator who said he was optimistic that 
Bossi and Berlusconi would patch things up. 
  On federalism, the leading item on the League's agenda, 
Miglio said, "Difficulties are derived from our firmness on the 
federal constitution. And on this there is a difference between 
us and Fini," Gianfranco Fini, the head of the neo-Fascist 
National Alliance holding up one end of the Berlusconi-led 
Freedom Front. 
  "And Berlusconi is in the middle," the man considered the 
architect of League theory said. "We want iron-clad guarantees 
on the launch of the skeleton of a federal constitution within 
90 days." 
  After having said he was confident of a future "embrace" 
between Bossi and Berlusconi, Miglio warned that these gestures 
are always "very relative" in politics. "What counts are 
relations of loyalty to commitments taken on, not loving 
relationships." 
  On the problem of government formation, one which has been 
keeping political observers guessing since the general election 
tally was completed, the senator said, there is no majority in 
the new Parliament "without Fini. Nor is there one without us. 
And we cannot go back. We have our shoulders to the wall 
because without the federalist project, the League has no sense 
and there will be no move on to the Second Republic." 
  On Bossi's talk of extending dealings to the parties in the 
center and the left which provoked Berlusconi's anger, Miglio 
linked the League leader's meetings with Mario Segni, whose Pact 
for Italy sent a dozen MPs to the Lower House, and the 
Progressive camp's Democratic Alliance, to a bid to re-write the 
constitution of 1948. 
  "It's not true that this is a betrayal of the will of the 
voters," he said to counter Berlusconi's objection. "The 49 
percent represented by the opposition is not dead. Bossi is 
doing the right thing in listening to them on a new 
constitution," he added.

<F P=106> [Unattributed article: "Berlusconi Breaks Off Government </F>
Formation Talks"] 
  [Text] (ANSA) Arcore, Milan, April 5 -- Silvio Berlusconi, 
the media magnate who emerged victorious from the March 27-28 
elections at the head of the right-wing Freedom Front, this 
evening announced he was "suspending all talks" on government 
formation after repeated snubs against his premiership and a 
part in government for the hard right National Alliance from the 
third player in the loose electoral alliance, Northern League 
leader Umberto Bossi. 
  "From today we are no longer going to the League or anywhere 
else. We do not betray trust. We will wait for the president 
of the republic to make a pronouncement", Berlusconi told 
journalists at his villa at Arcore near Milan, wiping out 
tomorrow's scheduled meeting between delegations of the League 
and Berlusconi's Forza Italia movement. 
  Berlusconi said that if Italian President Oscar Luigi 
Scalfaro, at the end of his consultations with the forces that 
won the election, decided to give a Forza Italia member the job 
of forming a government, "the day after you would have a 
government programme, a team, and without any further 
consultation, we would go straight to parliament." "If that 
does not happen," he added, "let there be another election to 
complete the clean-up." 
  According to the Italian constitution, the president has 
discretionary powers in deciding who should try to form a 
government. On this occasion, the three right-wing leaders -- 
Berlusconi, Bossi, and National Alliance secretary Gianfranco 
Fini -- were immediately seen as the victors, and talks began 
between the first two after Bossi appeared to tone down 
initially hostile remarks against the media magnate as premier 
and "the reactionary right" in government. 
  Berlusconi persevered in talks with the League despite 
Bossi's broadsides against his alleged conflict of interests, 
the counter- proposal of League Lower House whip Roberto Maroni 
as premier, the announcement that the League leader will this 
week start separate talks with other parties, and Bossi's 
no-show for a key meeting on Friday [1 April]. Bossi's 
opposition to Berlusconi's lead role -- seen by some as 
bargaining to ensure the League's federalist platform is enacted 
-- culminated yesterday in his description of the media magnate 
as "a threat for democracy". 
  Against this background, an SWG poll indicated that one in 
four League voters want Berlusconi as premier: 38 percent, just 
behind the 40 percent of National Alliance voters who said they 
wanted Berlusconi to lead the government. 
  The poll, to be published Sunday [10 April] by Catholic 
weekly FAMIGLIA CRISTIANA, gave the following premier 
preferences for all those who voted the Freedom Front (Forza 
Italia + League) in the north, and the Good Government Front 
(Forza Italia + National Alliance) in the rest of the country: 
Berlusconi 43.5 percent, 27.7 percent Fini, 9.1 percent Maroni, 
8.9 percent Bossi, and 5.3 percent former Italian president 
Francesco Cossiga, an ex-Christian Democrat seen by some as a 
possible right-wing peacemaker. Fini even edged out Berlusconi 
among young voters (18-34). 
  Italian futures in London fell sharply immediately after 
Forza Italia leader Silvio Berlusconi announced he was freezing 
all negotiations with his election allies, Northern League and 
National Alliance, indicating that talks aimed at forging a 
government coalition had reached a stalemate. Ten-year futures 
on the London computerized market, the only one still open, fell 
70 cents to 112.50 lire from 113.20 lire a few minutes earlier. 
  Berlusconi, who spoke for almost an hour without once 
mentioning Bossi, called the League's stance "a betrayal". "I 
think what is happening is scandalous", he said in reference to 
Bossi's announced decision to start talking to defeated centrist 
and left-wing forces (although the two prospective bargainers, 
electoral reform leader Mario Segni's Pact for Italy and the 
moderate intellectuals of Democratic Alliance, by this evening 
had received no formal invitation to Bossi's table). "Enough of 
this duplicity, these old tricks of the old politics," he said, 
stressing Italy's "urgent need" for a government to take Italy 
out of this "emergency phase". "We must feel responsibility for 
the mandate we have received from the electorate... If there is 
a betrayal, there would be only one response from me and from 
Forza Italia: go back to the polls to complete the clean-up". 
  Stressing that he had never "put myself forward" as a 
candidate for the premiership, Berlusconi made it plain that "we 
have no fear of going back to the country". "It's time to put 
an end to the electorate being treated like goods to be bought 
or sold," he said. 
  Lowering his tone slightly in response, Bossi repeated 
concerns about Berlusconi's alleged "autocratic" leanings but 
was optimistic that "in the end, we'll probably manage to make a 
government". 
  His first comment on Berlusconi's decision was "it's rather 
odd, I think his nerves are frayed. Instead of responding on 
the grounds of the platform, he put all the accent on the fact 
that he's boss. We have said clearly that giving the mandate to 
Berlusconi would be like giving it to an autocrat because he 
does not have a political force behind him that can mediate." 
  "In the end, we'll probably manage to make a government, but 
it must be clear that there is a great change," said Bossi, who 
has attacked Berlusconi as strongly as the left for alleged 
links with the "old regime". "People can see that Berlusconi 
broke off the talks over the fact that he wants to be boss. If, 
with all the problems this state has he thinks the main one is 
getting the premiership, then we weren't wrong to think that a 
`virtual reality' party means moving towards autocracy. We now 
have to save the general principles of democracy." 
  "I think Berlusconi lost his temper, a typical reaction in 
those who are used to getting everything at once. But now he 
has the people to face up to, a most powerful force." "We are 
very determined, because we know how important it is for the 
country to break with the party-ocracy, or the mingling of 
business and politics." 
  Earlier, Bossi had unveiled the new definition of the media 
magnate he said he was preparing for the League rank-and-file's 
Sunday meeting at their historic rallying-site at Pontida north 
of Milan: "Berluskaiser." 
  He repeated the view that Berlusconi was "dangerous" because 
he had a "non-party" behind him -- a contention angrily denied 
by Forza Italia clubs, who claimed the spontaneous, grass-roots 
nature of the movement -- and expressed "no worries" about the 
prospect of League defections to Berlusconi. 
  In a statement tonight, League whip Maroni -- Bossi's 
proposal for the premiership -- said that yesterday's appeal by 
Berlusconi to Leaguers to "keep faith" with the electorate 
should not be seen as an attempt to woo them into Forza Italia, 
but merely a reminder "not to make a government with the left -- 
something we never intended to do anyway". He echoed other 
Leaguers in expressing backing for Bossi's tactics "to extract 
the maximum possible" on the federalism front, while saying that 
the necessary "deep change" to the Constitution required "the 
widest possible involvement of other political forces." 
  League Senate whip Francesco Speroni accused Berlusconi of 
"throwing a tantrum" so as to "get out of giving us an answer on 
federalism tomorrow," while League academic and apostle of the 
Swiss-style cantonisation of Italy, Gianfranco Miglio, expressed 
the view that "sooner or later, Berlusconi will come looking for 
us." 
  National Alliance leader Gianfranco Fini -- who had earlier, 
after a phone conversation with Berlusconi, reiterated the 
neo-fascists' line that "there can be no federalism unless Italy 
becomes a presidential republic," with the regions maintaining a 
"residual" role vis-a-vis central government -- said that 
Berlusconi's move "will help clear things up regarding Bossi, 
who was tabling talks on the government or about federalism, you 
couldn't tell which." "Berlusconi was right to have had enough 
of it: how could he keep talking to someone who went back on his 
word every day," he said. "The trick Bossi was trying on didn't 
work; he broke the eggs without making the omelette. Now he has 
to make up his mind what he wants to do when he grows up." 
  In Fini's view the current political situation threw up 
three 
alternatives: a government between Forza Italia, the League, 
National Alliance, and Forza Italia's close allies in the 
(smaller ex-Christian Democrat) Democratic Christian Centre 
(CCD) and other small conservative forces; a government between 
the left, the (larger ex-Christian Democrat) People's Party, 
Segni's Pact, and the League; and a new round of elections. 
  In the event of the third hypothesis, he said that "we would 
certainly be Berlusconi allies, but not Bossi," whom he said 
"was elected in Milan with the help of Forza Italia" and in 
another ballot "would end up like Segni, with a handful of 
seats." 
  CCD leader Francesco D'Onofrio said that "Bossi's behaviour 
may mean one of two things: challenging the government majority 
up to a breaking point, which may come; or seeking an 
alternative majority, something that does not concern us." 
  Franco Rocchetta, the League federal president who has 
incurred grass-roots wrath by criticising Bossi in the past, 
outlined the possibility of a "constituent government" drafting 
clear conflict-of-interest laws that might enable Berlusconi to 
take over the helm "in six months time, say." 
  Another of the more moderate voices in the League, Milan 
Mayor Marco Formentini, said the issue of Berlusconi's 
premiership was secondary to the priorities of federalism and 
neo-liberalism, "to take Italy's state, economy and finance 
closer to the European Union." 
  Rocchetta predicted that President Scalfaro will give 
Berlusconi an exploratory mandate, voicing the hope that this 
will lead to the formation of a government comprising "all the 
forces in the Freedom Front" to draft "strict laws that will 
enable a businessman to take on government responsibilities 
without shadowy areas remaining". He said that at the same time 
MPs "from all political forces, international jurists and the 
presidents of the regions" should form "a sort of third Chamber" 
to draw up Italy's new federalist constitution. 
  Berlusconi meanwhile made clear that Forza Italia had never 
agreed to "constitutional federalism" as a condition for its 
electoral pact with the League, and had yet to receive a 
well-defined project from the League. He said Forza Italia's 
position had always been "crystal-clear and correct" in 
negotiating "fiscal federalism with the League and 
administrative decentralisation with the National Alliance." 
  Berlusconi said he was in favour of setting up a committee 
of 
"ten wise men" to study the problem, but indicated that any 
recommendation they make must be submitted to the popular will 
by referendum. Berlusconi denied a newspaper report that he had 
"offered Bossi a deal to run the country for twenty years" (a 
reference to the duration of Mussolini's fascist regime), 
saying: "I never said anything of the sort. What I did say was 
that a deal on those programmes could bring ten years of 
prosperity to Italy. Why turn something noble into something 
ignoble, I ask." 
  Raffaele Costa, leader of the small Centre Union (another 
Berlusconi ally) said he had spoken to Bossi and Berlusconi 
before the latter's announcement and had "got the impression 
that, albeit with certain conditions and despite appearances, 
the government coalition could get off the ground -- and soon 
too". He voiced the hope that Bossi would "accept an invitation 
to concentrate on the brass tacks of government programmes, 
rather than other assessments". 
  Influential new right commentator Giuliano Ferrara -- a 
firebrand speaker from a regular slot on the Berlusconi channels 
-- said that "Bossi is doing what he's good at, playing with 
fire, but past experience has shown he is often the first to 
reach for the extinguisher". 
  The (former Communist) Left Democrat party's No.2, Massimo 
D'Alema said the right-wing rift showed that Berlusconi had 
"deceived" the Italian people in "pretending" that his twin 
electoral pacts were based on an "accord to govern Italy, while 
it wasn't true". "Before talking about a new election the 
country is entitled to see if its vote produces a government. 
If they aren't able, the initiative should be passed to others. 
This is not the only majority possible in this parliament," he 
said on RAI-1 evening news. 
  Interim People's Party leader Rosa Russo Jervolino issued a 
statement saying that "in a difficult and delicate moment, 
coherence and clarity must be the unavoidable characteristics of 
political action."

<F P=106> [Unattributed article: "Di Pietro Definitely Not Interested </F>
in a Cabinet Post"] 
  [Excerpt] (ANSA) Sydney, April 2 -- The best-known of 
Italy's "Clean Hands" magistrates, Milan prosecutor Antonio Di 
Pietro, said during a reception here Saturday [2 April] that he 
wants to play no role in government. 
  A hero to Italians the world over for his lead role in the 
Clean Hands anti-corruption probe, Di Pietro arrived in Sydney 
Thursday with his wife and a friend, for a nine-day tour of 
Italian emigrant communities in Australia's major cities. 
  Asked about press reports that he might be tapped for the 
job 
of interior minister, he said this was just an April Fool's joke 
played by journalists. It was only while he was reading the 
newspapers aboard the flight taking him "down under" that he 
learned that Forza Italia leader Silvio Berlusconi had allegedly 
offered him a cabinet post, Di Pietro said. "No one held out 
such a prospect and, in any case, I cannot and do not want to 
hold any government spot," he insisted. 
  The prosecutor went on to say that he had enough on his 
plate 
with his present duties and that were he to accept a political 
post he would not be able to complete the job he is doing and 
which is still far from completion. 
  Moreover, the government soon to be formed will not be a 
constitutional government in need of technicians, but a 
government sanctioned by the votes of the electorate, a 
political government which has no room for technicians, he said.

<F P=106> [Unattributed article: "Anti-Mafia Chief Calls For </F>
Continued Battle"] 
  [Text] (ANSA) Rome, April 3 -- The new Italian government 
to be formed following the recent general elections was advised 
to strongly pursue the battle against organized crime in a 
statement delivered by Bruno Siclari, the head of the National 
Anti-Mafia Directorate, who raised the issue of electoral 
campaign talk of tampering with legislation on state's witnesses. 
  Siclari spoke at the weekend of what he said were precise 
signals being sent out by the Sicilian Mafia with reference to 
the attempts of the Mafia's boss of bosses, Salvatore "Toto" 
Riina, to discredit the testimony of gangsters who have turned 
state's witnesses. Riina was captured in Palermo in January 
last year after more than a decade at large, thanks largely to 
information gathered from a Mafia informant, and is now on trial 
in Palermo. 
  The anti-Mafia chief also mentioned recent demonstrations of 
some 300 residents of a district of Messina, in Sicily, who 
opposed the arrest of Sebastiano "Iano" Ferrara, described by 
state's witnesses as a senior Mafia boss and by his neighbors as 
a solid family man capable of keeping drug dealers out of his 
area of the city. 
  Now, said Siclari, law enforcement officials are attempting 
to understand "whether the new forces preparing to go into 
government," the nation's rightist alignments under businessman 
Silvio Berlusconi's Freedom Front banner, "have different 
intentions, also on the basis of the fact that during the 
electoral campaign the intention was shown, though it was vague, 
of emptying the law on state's witnesses." 
  Any move in this direction, continued the prefect in a 
television interview, would apparently be linked to "what is 
happening in the Campania region with the proposal of some 
Camorristi to disassociate themselves from their organization, 
but not become state's witnesses." 
  "All this is to be seen as an attempt to remove themselves 
from the responsibilities of the Mafia and the Camorra," the 
name of organized crime in and around Naples and the Campania 
region. 
  The head of the Anti-Mafia Directorate declared flatly, "It 
is not possible to change the law on state's witnesses. This 
must be kept firm and I hope that what was mentioned in the 
electoral campaign was mentioned without any precise view of the 
phenomena." 
  He also reiterated the point: "This is no time to give in. 
If we should give in now, we'd be set back 50 years. The Mafia 
and other forms of organized crime have always been based on the 
concept that the state is not capable of keeping pressure on 
them for long. And this is the first time the state has been 
able to maintain strong pressure on organized crime. If we 
again showed that we were not capable, we would really lose the 
battle." 
  After sounding this warning, Siclari said it was his opinion 
that the present Mafia strategy would not work and his hope that 
the new political parties at the fore "will have the sense to 
understanding that it is not possible for this to happen."

<F P=106> [Unattributed article: "March Against Death Penalty and for </F>
Human Rights"] 
  [Text] (ANSA) Rome, April 3 -- An Easter Day march to 
demand the abolition of the death penalty around the world and 
checks on human rights violations was led today by Rome Mayor 
Francesco Rutelli and his Sarajevo counterpart, Muhammed 
Kresevljakovic, from Rome's Capitoline Hill to the Presidential 
Quirinale Palace and on to St. Peter's square. 
  At the presidential residence, a delegation was received by 
Head of State Oscar Luigi Scalfaro who declared his support for 
the aims of the initiative, one of which calls for the creation 
of a permanent international tribunal for ruling on human rights 
violations. "Justice wants crimes against mankind to be 
stricken but does not want the addition of another act of blood, 
the death sentence," the president was quoted as saying. 
  A communique issued by the president's office said the 
delegation Scalfaro conferred with included Rutelli and 
Kresevljakovic, Radical Party Secretary Emma Bonino, 
representatives of the Catholic Sant'Egidio community and the 
Rome office of Caritas, the international Catholic charity 
organization, and other exponents of the movement to abolish the 
death penalty. Also marching, said the communique, were the 
mayors of more than 80 cities in Italy and abroad and 
representatives of European pacifist associations. 
  In St. Peter's square, where the marchers arrived at midday 
under heavy overcast and a light rain, Pope John Paul II 
declared from the basilica's loggia, "Happy Easter to you, men 
and women of Italy." 
  "May the risen Christ lead you on the paths of justice and 
solidarity and peace in this hour of great responsibility. May 
the secular heritage of culture and spirituality which 
characterizes Italy inspire everyone with wisdom and courage to 
pursue together the arduous and indispensable task of building a 
future open to hope and common good," he continued. 
  Turning to the 86 Italian and European mayors who led the 
procession, John Paul extended to them his "hope for peace" and 
"cordial greetings." Among the mayors were those from Vukovar, 
Osijek, Coventry and Guernica. 
  Announcing their initiative Friday [1 April], sponsors said 
the march was also intended to focus attention on the problems 
of financing for the ad hoc war crimes tribunal for 
ex-Yugoslavia, which was installed in The Hague November 17 
under Chief Justice Antonio Cassese of Italy, and on demands for 
the establishment for a permanent forum for hearing cases of 
human rights violations. 
  The permanent court, said Radical spokespersons, must be an 
instrument of international law which punishes human rights 
violations, "a true threat to peace (because) there is no peace 
without justice." The 49th United Nations General Assembly, in 
session in September, will be called on to convene an 
international conference for the formation of this permanent 
forum under the auspices of the United Nations. 
  On the ad hoc court, the Sarajevo mayor said in a letter 
that, "Hearing and punishing crimes committed in 
ex-Yugoslavia... without recourse, however, to the death 
penalty, must be the first step in affirming a new international 
law so that human rights violations, in all the Bosnias of the 
world, become criminally answerable."

<F P=106> [Unattributed article: "Privatisation Agenda Speeded Up"] </F>
  [Text] (ANSA) Rome, April 4 -- The daunting privatisation 
task facing the next government was given a boost by the 
out-going executive which approved a law decree speeding up the 
process for three placements due in the near future. 
  In one of the final cabinet meetings of the government led 
by 
Carlo Azeglio Ciampi, the sell-off of the insurance group INA 
[National Insurance Institute] was helped along by including 
Uniorias, controlled to the tune of 40 percent by INA, part of 
the deal. 
  The road was smoothed for the formation of a `Superagip' 
comprising the core industries of the ENI-owned [National 
Hydrocarbons Corporation] petrol giant, while some of the tax 
burden incurred by off-loading publicly owned properties was 
removed from government shoulders in the new version of the law 
decree. 
  The executive to emerge from on-going government-formation 
talks will have to deal with a host of privatisations, extending 
from insurance to radars, and from shipbuilding to supermarkets. 
  The approximate timetable for the placements is as follows: 
  Steel (expected privatisation date: May-June): The ailing 
steel-making giant Ilva has been put into liquidation, and its 
component parts have been split up into Ilva Laminati Piani 
(Ilva steel sheet), Acciai Speciali Terni (Terni special 
steels), and Dalmine, all of which are up for sale. For the 
first two companies, the sale is in its final stages, while the 
third, which is already quoted on the stock market, will be sold 
off without mediation. Proceeds from the sale will go to IRI 
[Institute for Industrial Reconstruction]. 
  INA (expected privatisation date: by June): INA's board of 
directors has already given its green light to a public 
placement, with the sole shareholder, the Treasury, still to 
decide what percentage of its 100 percent holding it will put up 
for sale. All indications suggest that the state holding will 
go below 50 percent, with INA policy holders given preferential 
treatment. Also involved in the sale will be Uniorias, an 
insurance company in which INA has a 40 percent stake. Proceeds 
from the sale will go to the state. 
  GS-Autogrill (expected privatisation date: by the summer): A 
first attempt to auction off this motorway refreshment and 
supermarket chain brought no bids of sufficient weight, so the 
race is now on for a second time. Proceeds from the sale will 
go to IRI. 
  STET [Turin Telephone Finance Company] (expected 
privatisation date: end of summer): In what Italians have dubbed 
"the mother of all privatisations," the telecommunications 
holding company STET will be sold off with a percentage of 
shares being floated on the open market, with the rest remaining 
in the hands of one or more larger shareholders. Proceeds from 
the sale will go to IRI. 
  ENEL [National Electric Power Board] (expected privatisation 
date: end of 1994): The privatisation of the electricity board 
is being hampered by disagreement over such thorny issues as 
length of the exclusive concession and the creation of a 
price-setting authority. The government's intention to hand out 
a 99 year concession has drawn fire from the antitrust committee 
and from the private employers' association CONFINDUSTRIA 
[General Confederation of Italian Industry], which have 
complained that it is too long. Proceeds from the sale will go 
to the state. 
  Superagip (expected privatisation date: 1994-5): All of the 
energy interests of the ENI fuels conglomerate will be merged to 
form a super-holding which will then be sold off in a 
privatisation process which is still in its initial stages. The 
law decree approved recently made the merger process easier, 
lifting some tax burdens on the new-look company. Proceeds from 
this sale will go to ENI. 
<H5>  State Property </H5>
  The sale of state-owned real estate will be overseen by 
Immobiliare Italia, a company set up specifically for this 
purpose. The process of selling it off, however, has run out of 
puff after an initial push ran into disagreement over what could 
and could not be sold. Proceeds from sales will go to the state. 
  Alongside these privatisations, the new government will have 
to deal with numerous other sales of parts of conglomerates and, 
possibly, of services such as public transport and the railways 
which to date have not come up for sale to the public. 
  Finmeccanica, IRI's technological wing, could go private in 
a 
flotation underwritten by those banks which are owed money by 
the defunct EFIM [Manufacturing Industry Holding and Financial 
Company] holding, the defence sector companies of which have now 
passed over to Finmeccanica. 
  The flagcarrier airline Alitalia, now under new management, 
is said to be seeking a partner to enter into its share capital, 
while the Aeroporti di Roma handlers, also owned by IRI, has 
already given signs that it is intending to seek permission to 
begin privatising in the not-too-distant future. 
  IRI's motorway building and maintenance wing Autostrade may 
be floated completely, while the Banca Nazionale del Lavoro now 
has a governor, Mario Sarcinelli, who makes no bones about 
privatisation being one of his top priorities. 
  Still in the banking sector, the 27 percent of the IMI 
[Italian Institute for Financing Personal and Real Property] 
merchant bank which remains in state hands after the recent 
extremely successful placement may go under the auctioneer's 
hammer. 
  RAI, the public broadcasting company, is also a possible 
contender for privatisation, with IRI already having said that 
it would be willing to hand control of the company over to the 
Treasury, usually a first step down the privatisation road.

  [Excerpt] Ankara/Bonn (DPA) -- On Tuesday [5 April], 
Turkey denied reports that weapons supplied by Germany are being 
used in the fight against militant Kurdish separatists. Turkish 
Foreign Ministry Spokesman Ferhat Ataman told DPA in Ankara that 
the Turkish Armed Forces do not use the German weapons in 
contradiction to bilateral agreements or their own commitments. 
Turkish Defense Minister Mehmet Golhan had also reaffirmed this 
last Friday, he said. 
  On Tuesday, in a letter to his Turkish counterpart, Hikmet 
Cetin, FRG Foreign Minister Klaus Kinkel again called for the 
observation of the NATO restrictions on the weapons supplied by 
Germany. According to the Foreign Ministry, Kinkel referred to 
the "recurrent assertions by politicians and media" that the 
German weapons that were supplied according to NATO provisions 
are used, contrary to the agreement, against the banned Workers 
Party of Kurdistan (PKK). As early as on Monday, Kinkel had 
appealed to the Turkish Government to use means of the 
rule-of-law state for the prosecution of the Kurdish extremists 
and to refrain from using weapons from Germany in the fight 
against the PKK. 
  Turkish Foreign Ministry Spokesman Ataman said that the 
representatives of the German media are apparently confusing the 
BTR-60 and BTR-80 armored personnel carriers that had been 
bought in Russia with the vehicles from the arsenals of the 
former GDR [German Democratic Republic] People's Army supplied 
by Germany. [passage omitted]

  [Excerpts] Vienna, April 5 (AFP) -- North Korea's 
development of a second plutonium production line indicates that 
the Stalinist state is determined to pursue an "active 
programme" of plutonium production, IAEA [International Atomic 
Energy Agency] official David Kyd warned Tuesday [5 April]. 
  Kyd said inspectors of the International Atomic Energy 
Agency 
visiting the radio-chemical laboratory at Yongbyon, 90 
kilometres (55 miles) north of Pyongyang, last month had 
observed that a second plutonium separation line was being 
constructed, similar to the first line which was subject to IAEA 
monitoring. 
  The new line meant that the North Korean programme could 
evade effective monitoring, Kyd said. 
  "This is of concern to us," he said. "It means North Korea 
is 
pursuing an active programme, while the United States and the 
IAEA were hoping that it would put its nuclear activities on 
hold." [passage omitted] 
  Kyd said IAEA chief Hans Blix had verbally notified the IAEA 
governors of the discovery at a council meeting on March 21, and 
had also informed the UN Security Council. 
  The Security Council and IAEA officials were hoping a new 
mission could be sent to North Korea at the beginning of May, 
Kyd said. However there were currently no contacts between 
Pyongyang and the IAEA. [passage omitted]

<F P=106> [Interview with Yun Ho-jin, DPRK deputy chief of mission at </F>
the International Atomic Energy Agency, by Brigitte Voykowitsch 
in Vienna; date not given: "`The United States Wants To 
Suffocate North Korea'"] 
  [Text] "We agreed to inspections by the International 
Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) -- and permitted them as well -- 
that are required to find out whether fissionable material has 
been put aside from our nuclear installations." Yun, the DPRK 
deputy head of mission in Vienna, conducts his country's 
negotiations with the IAEA. He rejects accusations that his 
country has not met its obligations toward the IAEA. 
  "The latest dispute with the IAEA centers around the radio 
chemical laboratory, a dispute we had a year ago. At that time, 
the IAEA test results differed from ours. This technical 
problem has to be solved. Then they can take new samples. 
  "Since the installation is sealed, it is clear that it 
cannot 
have been in operation since it was last inspected." 
  [Voykowitsch] In this case, taking samples would be 
harmless. 
  [Yun] There is no reason for this, just as there is no 
reason 
for the special inspections demanded by the IAEA because of 
satellite photographs from the United States. The inspection 
agreement prohibits such photos. 
  [Voykowitsch] The agreement does not even mention them. 
  [Yun] Since the United States is hostile toward us, we 
cannot 
accept inspections based on such photos. We have presented all 
information on our nuclear installations to the IAEA. Now they 
are citing photographs and intelligence reports saying that 
North Korea has unregistered nuclear installations. 
  [Voykowitsch] Does this mean that the two mysterious 
installations in Yongbyon.... 
  [Yun] They are military installations. 
  [Voykowitsch] What makes the United States say that 
Pyongyang 
already has two atomic bombs? 
  [Yun] That is not true. We have stressed again and again 
that we do not have the capacity, nor the intention, nor the 
necessity for this. 
  [Voykowitsch] How far has your nuclear program got? The 
United States says that your country has weapons-grade plutonium. 
  [Yun] Our program is for electricity supply. 
  [Voykowitsch] You do not produce any plutonium for military 
purposes? 
  [Yun] Not yet. 
  [Voykowitsch] Not yet? 
  [Yun] No, no. The radio chemical laboratory studies 
reprocessing. And once, in 1989, we had an experiment with old 
fuel rods. 
  [Voykowitsch] You produced plutonium? 
  [Yun] Less than 100 grams. But we have not produced anything 
since then. We were only testing whether production is going 
all right. The installation is not finished yet. 
  [Voykowitsch] Will it produce plutonium? 
  [Yun] No. 
  [Voykowitsch] If nothing unusual is going on, why then would 
you not let your installations be inspected? Why are you 
threatening war? 
  [Yun] It is the U.S. aim to suffocate North Korea. What 
would your reaction be if someone tried to kill you? ...Self 
defense. 
  [Voykowitsch] Suffocate? How can an isolated country such 
as North Korea be suffocated? 
  [Yun] What do you mean by isolated? We have the necessary 
foreign relations, but our philosophy is self-sufficiency. 
  [Voykowitsch] How could your relationship with the IAEA and 
the United States be normalized? 
  [Yun] Pyongyang is always in favor of talking. Pressure only 
does harm.

  [Text] Geneva, April 5 (AFP) -- The co-chairmen of the 
Geneva conference trying to restore peace in the former 
Yugoslavia are planning to reduce its staff as mediation bids 
are being undertaken elsewhere, diplomats said here Tuesday [5 
April]. 
  Lord Owen of the European Union and Thorvald Stoltenberg of 
the United Nations will axe the posts of two Swedish military 
advisers. It is also unlikely that spokesman John Mills will 
still be in his job after the end of the month. 
  Diplomats said two United Nations Protection Force 
[UNPROFOR] 
liaison officers may soon be recalled from Geneva. A decision 
will ultimately have to be made by French General Bertrand de 
Lapresle, UNPROFOR chief commander in Croatia. 
  "There is no political determination to do away with the 
conference," said a European diplomat who declined to be 
identified, but peace mediators are aware of the fact that the 
Geneva talks are suspended for the time being. 
  Parties to the conference -- Bosnian Serbs, Croats and 
Moslem 
government officials -- last broke up on February 12 after no 
progress was made in three days of talks on the makeup of three 
ethnic states in Bosnia-Herzegovina. 
  But since that date negotiations held under the auspices of 
the United States and Russia have ended Serb shelling of 
Sarajevo, settled the territorial dispute between Bosnian Croats 
and Moslems, and yielded a ceasefire accord between Croatia and 
Croat Serb separatists. 
  Geneva conference working groups on ethnic minorities and on 
economic issues have not met for some time.

<F P=106> [Unattributed article: "Social Dumping: European Union </F>
Plodding Along Behind U.S. Steamroller"] 
  [Text] Brussels -- "Social dumping" whizzed to the agenda 
of world trade talks like a comet. Some three months after the 
conclusion of the Uruguay Round, where the issue was not even 
brought up, it has now hit the charts. 
  The United States thoroughly ruined the atmosphere on the 
evening before the official signing of the GATT agreements in 
the Moroccan city of Marrakech. President Clinton insists that 
a reference to the problem be included in the ministerial 
statement marking the conclusion of the Uruguay Round, and 
setting the tone for the World Trade Organization (WTO), which 
is to be established soon. The U.S. envoy in Geneva thus pinned 
down almost all other 118 participants against their will. 
  The European Union (EU) looked the other way for a while. 
Still, Trade Commissioner Sir Leon Brittan also has only two 
things on his mind these days: The promotion of his book on the 
future of Europe in general and of himself in particular, and 
the "Worldwide Social Partnership." This is his euphemism for 
stopping social dumping through new agreements between the 
industrialized nations and their emerging competitors. 
  Social dumping is a relatively vague concept. However, both 
the EU and the United States recently found out that they are 
faced more and more often with products from countries which 
gain a comparative advantage because they do not have to worry 
as much about employee rights and working conditions. They are 
not only concerned about direct competition, but also about the 
indirect loss of employment through investments. 
  In the meantime, the developing countries are turning 
massively against the U.S. steamroller, which intends to level 
the "global playing field," and behind which Sir Leon is 
plodding along so enthusiastically. They fear that the 
industrialized nations are looking for a new pretext to screen 
off their own markets. They agreed to the request to put 
environmental dumping on the agenda, but feel the issue of 
social rights does not fall within the competence of GATT. This 
issue should be dealt with by the International Labor 
Organization (ILO), and as far as the prevention of child labor 
is concerned, by UNICEF. 
  "A nontariff and protectionist trade barrier": This is how 
the Philippine ambassador to the EU labelled the plan for a 
social clause earlier this week, during a hearing of the 
European Parliament. Zutshi, Indian envoy to GATT, warned the 
United States in Geneva that it risks all attainments of the 
Uruguay Round and jeopardizes the multilateral trade system. 
  Brittan knew that the developing countries would react this 
way. There is no doubt in his mind that action must be taken in 
the social field, the only question is how and when. However, 
since "we cannot make any progress without the developing 
countries," he proceeds with more caution than the Americans. 
His unsolicited advice to Washington is this: "We should be 
careful not to undermine our own positions by taking 
ill-considered and hastily implemented initiatives." 
  The European Commission contributed to the hearing by 
arguing 
that the developing countries and emerging industrial nations 
should be very pleased with a social clause in the world trade 
regulations, which the EU pursues out of sheer altruism. "Our 
message will be convincing, if we can show that the measure is 
neither protectionist, nor dictated by self-interest, nor 
opportunistic," Brittan claimed. 
  The EU aims at the worldwide implementation of the ILO 
standard on employee rights "basically because it is the right 
thing to do, not because we expect some material benefit from 
it," he assured. However, he failed to be truly convincing. 
Brittan did not hesitate to utter threats by referring to the 
European labor unions. 
  In a common statement on the "social dimension of 
international trade," the unions suggested that one GATT clause 
refer to the ILO standard. Countries which do not meet the 
standard, would get two years to straighten things out. Then a 
decision would be taken on possible sanctions. "It seems to me 
that this is the proper approach," Brittan said.

  [Text] Brussels, April 5 (AFP) -- The European Commission 
has decided to provide relief aid worth ECU13.5 million (15.39 
million dollars) for Burundi refugees, an EU [European Union] 
spokesman said Tuesday [5 April]. 
  The sum will be used to pay for medical and sanitation 
programmes in crowded refugee camps until around mid-June, the 
spokesman said. 
  Since the assassination of President Melchior Ndadaye in 
October last year, tribal strife in the small Central African 
nation has claimed many thousands of lives and driven hundreds 
of thousands of people into exile. 
  The European Commission, exuctive arm of the European Union, 
estimates that Tanzania hosts 245,000 refugees from Burundi, 
Rwanda 273,000, and Zaire 41,000, most of them women and 
children. 
  The Commission has provided more than ECU40 million (45.6 
million dollars) in humanitarian assistance to refugees from 
Burundi and displaced people within the country since Ndadaye, 
the country's first elected Hutu president, was murdered by 
troops from the Tutsi-dominated army.

<F P=106> [Report signed G.Dz.: "More Than 600,000 Unemployed Until </F>
1998"] 
  [Text] The Planning Office has updated its 1994-1998 
forecasts according to the overall economic plan. It forecasts 
a gradual recovery with 1.3 percent growth in the Belgian 
economy this year and growth of 2.5 percent in the following 
years (2.5 percent in 1995, 2.6 percent in 1996 and 1997, and 
2.7 percent in 1998). There will be a gradual improvement 
thanks to the recovery in Europe and better prospects for 
domestic demand despite the negative effects of the overall plan 
on household incomes. 
  The latter should drop by 0.3 percent this year and only 
experience limited growth until 1996. The Office estimates that 
there will be a gradual fall in the present high rate of savings 
and hence a revival of consumption; the announced drop in 
interest rates makes investments less attractive and the gradual 
restoration of a climate of confidence, linked to a more 
favorable economic environment, makes precautionary reserves of 
saving less vital. 
  Inflation will remain below 3 percent (2.9 percent in 1994, 
2.5 percent in 1995, 2.4 percent in 1996, 2.6 percent in 1997 
and 1998). The public finances deficit (central state) will be 
reduced to 5.7 percent of GDP in 1994, 5.5 percent in 1995, 4.7 
percent in 1996, 4.3 percent in 1997, and 3.7 percent in 1998). 
  The Planning Office thinks that one of the most positive 
results of the overall plan is to achieve both an improvement in 
social security finances and the net creation of jobs in the 
medium term. 
  In 1994, more than 20,000 jobs will be lost (a total of 
622,000 unemployed); the stabilization of the unemployment rate 
will come in 1995 thanks to job creation in the enterprises. 
There will still be 622,000 unemployed in 1998, in other words 
14.2 percent of the working population (Planning Office 
definition). 
  The overall plan should contribute to this "positive" 
development. Of the 59,000 private jobs created from 1994 to 
1998, wage restraint would contribute to 20,000, reductions in 
contributions and employment promotion would contribute to 
28,000, economic growth would contribute to 26,000. Conversely, 
measures to improve social security finances and tax increases 
would lead to 15,000 job losses. It is the sector of market 
services which would increase; in all others, aside from 
construction, employment would fall. A decrease in jobs in 
public administrative departments should also be noted 
(especially in national defense): 600,000 employees in 1998 as 
against 661,000 in 1990.

<F P=106> [Unattributed article: "Netherlands Doubles Aid to South </F>
Africa"] 
  [Text] The Hague -- The Netherlands is normalizing its 
relations with South Africa. Next year the country will get 30 
million guilders in financial aid, twice the amount from last 
year. The priority for the aid will be the democratization 
process, education, "marginalized" youth and employment. 
  This was stated in a document sent to Parliament yesterday 
by 
Foreign Minister Kooijmans, Development Cooperation Minister 
Pronk, and Economic Affairs State Secretary Van Rooy. The 
Netherlands will normalize its relations with South Africa when 
a new government has been formed on the basis of the 
parliamentary elections of 26, 27, and 28 April. 
  The ministers' document covers political relations, economic 
relations, development cooperation, and cultural relations with 
South Africa. The ministers stressed that the precise form 
would depend above all on developments in the near future. They 
have full confidence that a normal relation could be built up 
with the country because the Netherlands "has historical and 
cultural links [with South Africa] and has built up good 
contacts with future leaders by its active attitude in the fight 
against apartheid." 
  The Netherlands will also enter a development relationship 
with South Africa. To date, aid was passed only through private 
organizations. The cabinet said that it would be necessary 
before the end of the year to consult the new South African 
Government about the policies. South Africa is classed as a 
country in transition, and consequently will receive no 
large-scale or long-term aid. 
  Netherlands companies will be encouraged to invest in the 
"South African economy, which in principle is very promising." 
Among the options are the exchange of trade and investment 
delegations and -- "when the time is ripe" -- more flexible 
policies on export credit insurance.

<F P=106> [Unattributed article: "Cabinet Will Not Reach Deficit </F>
Reduction Target, According to Planning Bureau"] 
  [Text] The Hague, 31 March -- In 1994, the cabinet will not 
reach its targets of reducing the budget deficit to 3.25 percent 
and not allowing the collective tax burden to exceed a ceiling 
of 53.7 percent of national income. The budget deficit will be 
4.1 percent this year, according to the CPB [Central Planning 
Bureau]. The collective tax burden (taxation and social 
premiums) will remain at 54.3 percent. This forecast was given 
by CPB director G. Zalm this morning at the presentation of the 
Central Economic Plan. 
  In order to keep the budget deficit within the limits, "use 
was often made of coverage which was not included in the 
planning a year ago," Zalm said. "They have wandered a fair way 
off the original targets," Zalm said this morning. The Planning 
Bureau director pointed out that "all in all, there were many 
mitigating circumstances for why the targets have not been 
reached." But Zalm said this did not prevent the fact that the 
present governmental team "has not made it easier for the next 
cabinet." 
  In comparison with other countries, the Netherlands has not 
done badly, according to the CPB. The budget deficit dropped 
between 1990 and 1994. The deficit still dropped when the 
increasing one-off coverage criticized by the CPB is taken into 
account. The situation has also improved if the European 
definition of the budget deficit (the so-called current account 
deficit) is used. In the 12 European Union countries, the total 
government current account deficit increased from an average of 
4 to 6 percent between 1990 and 1994, the CPB said, but in the 
Netherlands it dropped from 4.6 to 4.0 percent. In the 24 rich 
Western industrial countries which are OECD members, the current 
account deficit increased from 2.1 to 4.0 percent in the same 
period. 
  The Central Economic Plan contained another positive point 
for government finances. Total collective expenditure would 
drop by nearly 3 percent in 1994 and 1995, according to the CPB 
forecast. The CPB said this was not connected to volume growth, 
which would continue to increase slightly, but to striking 
developments in price levels. The price levels in collective 
expenditure will increase slower than gross national product in 
1994. That was due to the "moderate wage developments, 
particularly by the collective sector, and above all the 
reduction in social security payments," according to the CPB. 
  The CPB was less positive about unemployment. The unemployed 
working population would increase by 80,000 this year and by 
10,000 more in 1995. Without the recent reduction in employers' 
contributions (2 billion guilders), 5,000-10,000 more persons 
unemployed.

<F P=106> [Unattributed article: "Philips Takes the Lead"] </F>
  [Text] Phillips is to invest 3 billion guilders in Russian 
production facilities. The company expects production costs in 
Russia to be between 30 and 40 percent lower than Western 
levels. The implications of this decision are enormous. An 
important multinational has pronounced its confidence in the 
ailing Russian economy and above all in the still unhealthy 
investment climate. Many others will follow. 
  The Eindhoven-based electronics concern is emphasizing what 
the Netherlands business world did not finish discussing during 
(Minister of Economic Affairs) Andriessen's "Global Plan" two 
weeks ago: That the Netherlands will have to get used to the 
fact that, partly due to the elimination of the Iron Curtain, 
some industrial activities can no longer be maintained here. 
The wages are too high because it is impossible to compete with 
a few guilders per hour in East Europe. As low-wage countries 
like Russia develop legal structures offering entrepreneurs 
sufficient guarantees, then there will be a greater desire to 
invest. 
  This shift will have major consequences for employment in 
the 
West. In the short term, it means that the standard of living 
here will have to be sacrificed in part, in order to allow such 
welfare to exist in countries like Russia, for example. That 
hurts. But in the long term, it is a good development. Not aid 
but trade, because this is the only way a new macroeconomic 
division of labor and new equilibrium can arise. In this way, 
East Europe and Russia will be given the opportunity to create 
healthy, prosperous economies. And Western business will benefit 
from that, too.

<F P=106> [Interview with Gerry Adams, "president of Sinn Fein, the </F>
political wing of the Irish Republican Army," by Sabine 
Christiansen on 5 April; Christiansen is in the ARD studio in 
Hamburg, Adams is in a studio in Belfast -- recorded; Adams 
statements in English with superimposed German translation] 
  [Text] [Christiansen] Good afternoon, Mr. Adams. What do 
the Irish Republican Army [IRA] and Sinn Fein want to achieve 
with the limited cease-fire agreement? 
  [Adams] The IRA initiative is basically an attempt to create 
room and to achieve a breakthrough. The point is clarification 
for Sinn Fein on the part of the British Government. [sentence 
as heard] Yet, when the Downing Street Declaration was 
published we did not get that clarification that we should have 
been given, and which everybody else received. 
  [Christiansen] You have said that you want clarification. 
Are you not seeking direct negotiations with London? 
  [Adams] No, no, we are currently not seeking negotiations, 
even though one day we will. All parties involved in this 
process wanted a negotiated peaceful settlement, but only later. 
At the moment our point is to have the British Government 
involve Sinn Fein and accept the legitimacy of our electorate 
and answers those questions that we would like to see answered. 
  [Christiansen] Could the second step now not also lie in the 
IRA's commitment to non-aggression? After all, then the British 
Government would sit down at the negotiating table with you. 
  [Adams] This is a question for the IRA. I am talking on 
behalf of Sinn Fein. The peace process must get started. We 
must not accept a standstill as a result of difficulties that 
John Major happens to have regarding his relations with the 
Unionists and his own right wing. At the same time, we must 
understand that he is a weakened prime minister, and that this 
is his reality. The worth of the IRA initiative is that it 
creates certain room, and that if John Major would like to 
achieve some progress on this issue that he could do so on this 
basis. 
  [Christiansen] Mr. Adams, what will happen once the 
cease-fire expires if -- as signals from London indicate -- 
there will not be a positive reaction from there? 
  [Adams] I assume that the British Army will continue its 
activities, and the same applies to the other side. The point 
is to give a very clear signal to the British. This signal will 
not be lost despite all gut reactions from Downing Street. The 
eminent advisers have certainly realized how significant this 
IRA attempt to show flexibility is. 
  [Christiansen] Thank you very much.

  [Text] French Ambassador Francois Scheer, 60, has 
overreached himself with his criticism of [German Foreign 
Minister Klaus] Kinkel, which he launched via the German press. 
"One more blunder and he will be gone," it was said in the 
French Foreign Ministry last week. 
  At home Scheer has been known for some time for his 
willfulness. However, so far French journalists have 
deliberately kept silent about his excesses. 
  "Something like the incident in Bonn is simply inconceivable 
among friends," it is being said at the Quai d'Orsay. 
  As an excuse, it was stated that Scheer, who comes from 
Strasbourg, formulated his criticism more strongly than intended 
because of his inadequate command of German.

  [Text] Paris, April 5 (AFP) -- France has urged inclusion 
of workers' rights and environment committees in the future 
World Trade Organisation (WTO), to be created after ratification 
of the Uruguay Round of GATT global trade talks in Morocco, next 
week. 
  Premier Edouard Balladur wrote to European leaders arguing 
that the two issues should come within the compass of the WTO, a 
communique by Industry Minister Gerard Longuet said. 
  The communique, released after a ministerial meeting chaired 
by Balladur, said the WTO should "deal with issues affecting 
international trade such as the environment and workers' rights." 
  Setting up an environment committee has already been agreed, 
but many countries, in particular developing countries, are 
opposed to creation of a committee on social issues, including 
workers' rights. 
  In the communique, Longuet said it was Europe's duty "to 
promote economic and social development and to defend human 
rights, in particular those of the individual at work" when 
setting up international trade rules and mechanisms.

  [Text] Paris, April 6 (AFP) -- France's veteran socialist 
president, Francois Mitterrand, is more popular than its 
conservative prime minister, Edouard Balladur, for the first 
time since Balladur came to office in March 1993, a new poll 
said Wednesday. 
  Mitterrand scored an 48 percent approval rating in April, up 
by one point from the previous month, against Balladur's 42 
percent, down from 47, according to the Gallup poll published by 
the weekly EXPRESS magazine. 
  Amongst those interviewed, 40 percent disapproved of 
Mitterrand's actions, down from 41 the month before, and a 
steady 12 percent gave no opinion. 
  Balladur's disapproval rating rose by seven points to 51 
percent. Seven percent would not give an opinion. 
  The poll, taken on a sample of 945 people around France, was 
conducted on Thursday March 31 and Friday April 1 just after 
Balladur's government had ordered an embarrassing climbdown over 
plans to introduce a cut-price youth wage. 
  Balladur had enjoyed a long political honeymoon since coming 
to office in 1993 but has recently taken something of a 
political battering with a series of run-ins with French 
fishermen, airline workers and students.

CSO 

    [Editorial Report] Writing in the 19 March Paris weekly LE 
POINT, commentator Alain Duhamel analyzes the diminishing 
popularity of Prime Minister Edouard Balladur one year after his 
"majestic" accession to power. Balladur, he notes, has become 
the target of the political and trade-unionist Left and of those 
of his friends who are also his rivals. In mid-career, the head 
of the government is enduring both the attrition stemming from 
the economic crisis and the "perverse" effects of his possible 
candidacy for the presidency, Duhamel contends. Despite his 
assets--his unifying style, reflectiveness, and pragmatism, his 
firm liberal convictions and his flexibility--Balladur also 
needs luck and the ability to "embody a certain dynamism" in an 
"electric" climate where the least error is costly. He is 
therefore advancing cautiously, for "if he manages, he 
disappoints and frustrates, and if he innovates, he triggers off 
lightning," Duhamel comments. As a result, he has been unable to 
clarify the nation's prospects and impart a feeling of movement 
needed for a revival of the economy. 
  Still another disadvantage under which Balladur is laboring 
stems from the approach of the presidential elections, Duhamel 
continues. If Balladur were not implicitly a contender for the 
presidency, he could govern more easily. As it is, the 
presidential rivalry between him and Jacques Chirac, leader of 
the Rally for the Republic (RPR), is cramping Balladur's style 
despite the two men's essentially similar convictions and 
origins. Each is trying to dissuade the other from running, and 
while Balladur is more popular with voters, Chirac is more 
appreciated by party cadres. "The most determined of the two 
will win," Duhamel concludes. 
  In his regular column in the 25 March Paris daily 
LIBERATION, 
Duhamel argues that the satisfactory result Balladur and his 
government obtained in the cantonal elections in the face of 
student protests against the Job Training Contract (CIP) is not 
"incoherent." The RPR and the French Democratic Union (UDF) 
obtained the same results as in the March 1993 legislative 
elections because of public satisfaction over the Socialist 
defeat last year, the absence of credible alternatives at 
present, and Balladur's personal image which remains "enviable." 
Moreover, student violence can only consolidate the conservative 
electorate and anchor it more solidly on the Right, Duhamel 
continues. Nevertheless, Balladur's relationship with the young 
in light of his decisions on professional training and hiring 
practices will remain difficult. While the most troublesome 
provisions of the labor law have been withdrawn, tempers have 
not cooled. Duhamel adds that so far, no government, regardless 
of its political orientation, has devised a satisfactory 
settlement for this type of "explosive" social situation. In 
fact, Duhamel contends that a social dialogue is not really a 
"French specialty." While Northern European countries have set 
up systems of cooperation, arbitration and permanent debate, 
France remains a "prodigiously archaic" nation in this field. 
"The style of local authority, traditional centralization, the 
state's domineering behavior, and the mercantilism existing in 
both the Right and the Left lead to a persistent 
underdevelopment in social relations," Duhamel comments, adding 
that the "on this point, the French exception remains intact."

  [Text] Paris, April 5 (AFP) -- Embattled Prime Minister 
Edouard Balladur called on neo-Gaullist MPs to rally behind him 
on Tuesday [5 April] as he faced a wave of criticism in 
parliament from his own supporters for his handling of recent 
social conflicts. 
  Against a background of rivalry within the Gaullist Rally 
for 
the Republic (RPR) party for presidential elections in May 1995, 
Balladur appealed to RPR deputies to show "unity" and 
"solidarity" behind him. 
  Addressing a meeting of RPR MPs held on the sidelines of a 
new session of parliament, Balladur said unity was a "condition 
of success" while division meant the "certainty of failure," 
Balladur aides reported after the meeting. 
  The prime minister spoke after coming under heavy criticism 
from supporters of RPR president Jacques Chirac, a candidate in 
the 1995 presidentials, for his handling of a plan to allow 
firms to pay less than the legal minimum to unemployed youths. 
  Balladur, who has barely concealed his own presidential 
ambitions, withdrew the plan last Wednesday after more than a 
month of sometimes violent student agitation. 
  Presenting himself both as "head of the government" and head 
of the ruling right-wing parliamentary majority, Balladur said 
the government drew its "strength" from the "unflinching" 
support of its majority, his aides said. 
  Without naming him, Balladur attacked RPR 
assistant-secretary 
general Jean-Louis Debre, a strong Chirac supporter, for 
criticising the government as demonstrations were actually going 
on. 
  Balladur also alluded to the presidentials, saying it would 
be an "illusion" to believe that his own failures would benefit 
any other right-wing candidate in 1995. 
  The prime minister rejected calls for the resignation of 
Labour Minister Michel Giraud over the failed youth jobs scheme, 
saying he accepted full responsibility, the aides added. 
  Balladur also said he accepted responsibility for the 
failure 
of government plans to aid private schools at the expense of the 
public sector, which brought 600,000 demonstrators into the 
streets of Paris last January. 
  In February, the prime minister pledged handouts of 30 
million dollars after violent protests by fishermen against 
cheap imports. 
  Meanwhile MPs of the opposition Socialist Party said they 
put 
down a censure motion on the government's five-year employment 
act, under which decrees on the youth jobs scheme were 
published. Communists said they would demand abrogation of the 
law. 
  Charles Millon, parliamentary leader of the centre-right 
component in the ruling coalition, the Union for French 
Democracy (UDF), pledged "total solidarity" for the government, 
but warned it to take account of "common sense" criticisms from 
its backers. 
  Bernard Pons, head of the RPR parliamentary group and a 
Chirac supporter, renewed calls for Giraud's resignation in an 
interview with the GLOBE weekly to be published Wednesday. 
  He said the RPR group thought there had been failures by 
some 
ministers. "It is up to the prime minister and him alone to 
draw the conclusions." 
  Pons also confirmed that Balladur and Chirac had reached "a 
sort of pact" for the presidential election after the right's 
sweeping victory in legislative elections in March, 1993, and 
this "will be respected." 
  Under the pact, Balladur was to have headed a caretaker 
government under socialist President Francois Mitterrand, 
leaving the field to Chirac in the presidentials.

    [Editorial Report] Following a statement by President 
Francois Mitterrand, who "exclaimed" that if he were 20 years 
younger, he would run again for president and "beat everybody," 
Francois Bazin comments in the 3-9 March Paris weekly LE NOUVEL 
OBSERVATEUR that "subtle" observers "decoded" the president's 
message as follows: 1) the Right is weakened by its internal 
divisions 2) the Left can win the 1995 presidential elections 3) 
it must have a candidate who can "seize the opportunity" 4) with 
Mitterrand unable to run "because of his arteries" and Socialist 
Party (PS) leader Michel Rocard out of the running "due to poll 
results," EC Commission President Jacques Delors is the only 
remaining candidate. 
  According to Bazin, Delors "is benefitting from 
extraterritoriality." While he possesses experience, he is seen 
as a "new man" and has not been affected by the disenchantment 
of the French with Europe. Were the presidential candidate to be 
designated by opinion polls, Delors would be nominated, Bazin 
comments. However, Mitterrand has taught the Socialists that the 
laws of public opinion are unlike those that rule parties, and 
that "faith in one's destiny can modify the most delicate 
situation." Therein lies the difficulty of "operation Delors," 
Bazin contends. Delors himself has long wavered and his 
statements have contributed to confusing the issue. Meanwhile, 
only a Rocard "faux-pas" could deny him the nomination and the 
June European Parliament elections may in fact settle the 
situation. If the Rocard list receives less than 20 percent of 
the vote, many in the PS would abandon the first secretary, 
switching their support to Delors, Bazin contends. On the other 
hand, if a "window of opportunity" opens this summer for Delors, 
no one believes the EC Commission president would reveal his 
intentions before the end of 1994, when his presidency comes to 
an end. This leaves Rocard a valuable six months to overcome a 
possible defeat in the June elections. Bazin notes that in this 
case, the only solution for Delors partisans would be a strategy 
aimed at the progressive attrition of Rocard's positions, to let 
the PS leader understand that the preservation of his work 
demands his voluntary "self-effacement to the benefit of Delors, 
Bazin concludes. 
  According to a brief article in the 24 March Paris weekly 
PARIS MATCH entitled "Will There Be a Rocard-Delors War?", 
Rocard acknowledges he is dropping in the polls at a time when 
the Left itself is on the rise. The article cites a close Rocard 
aide as saying that the PS first secretary must no longer 
confine himself to "beating on Balladur, but ought to widen his 
audience" by addressing people's problems and their solutions. 
The article also notes that Rocard is "lucky," because Delors 
has no intention of interfering with his plans in the belief 
that the PS leader has a right to run for the presidency. At the 
same time, a Delors confidante is quoted as pointing out that 
while the EC Commission president will "do nothing against 
Rocard," it does not mean he would not be a candidate if a 
"stagnating" Rocard decides not to run.

  [Text] L'Isle-Jourdain, France, April 5 (AFP) -- Militant 
farmers have given home-grown cannabis to French Agriculture 
Minister Jean Puech, saying cultivating the drug was the only 
way they had of making a living. 
  The gift was "produced by a French farmer" as his "only way 
of feeding his family," said a communique released in this 
southwestern French town, headquarters of the activist group 
Rural Coordination. 
  In Paris, Puech denied receiving a parcel of cannabis from 
the farmers. "If such a parcel reached me, I would immediately 
hand it over to the police." 
  Criticising the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade, the 
farmers' communique said low world prices had forced Third World 
farmers to produce drugs. 
  "By accepting the ratification of GATT, Mr. Puech has opted 
for a world of unemployment, violence and drugs. Farmers will 
adapt their crops to this," the communique said. 
  The gift of cannabis was made to mark the end of Puech's 
first year as minister, the communique said. 
  More than 120 countries will sign the new GATT in Marrakesh, 
Morocco, on April 12-15.

  [Text] The Lyon court dealing with internal disputes in the 
French civil service ruled on 6 April in favor of rescinding the 
deportation order of two young Algerians arrested during a 
demonstration in Lyon. 
  Contrary to what the interior minister [Charles Pasqua] has 
argued, their deportation was not an absolute necessity, the 
judges said. 
  Abdelhakim Youbi, 20 years old, and Mouloud Madaci, 18 years 
of age, were deported on 23 March. 
  The two young men are to be repatriated soon.

<F P=106> [Article by Dominique Garraud: "Defense: Leotard Presents </F>
Estimate] 
  [Editorial Report] Between 657 and 664 billion francs for 
military equipment expenditures over 6 years. The army got a 
considerable amount, but they are not truly satisfied, for the 
programs already launched are bottomless pits. This somehow 
expresses the general philosophy of the forthcoming 1995-2000 
military planning law. [Defense Minister] Francois Leotard 
announced yesterday at the Polytechnic School that "the final 
version is definitely ready." 
  According to our information, the planning law envisions an 
annual increase of 0.5 percent per year in defense equipment 
allocations on the basis of the 100.4 billion francs mentioned 
in the 1994 budget. It will thus be a deviation from the 5-year 
law aimed at reducing budgetary expenditures, which advocates a 
yearly drop of 0.5 percent in public spending. For the part 
covering the last three years (1998-2000), military planners 
even envision an annual increase of 1.5 percent in expenditures 
if economic growth permits this. That is, an overall figure 
between 657 and 664 billion francs in current terms over 6 years. 
  At the outset, the general staffs and the Defense Ministry 
had asked for a minimal increase of 3 percent per year to 
maintain the large armaments programs already launched. 
According to a report by French Democratic Union (UDF) deputy 
Arthur Paecht, these programs will swallow up about 574 billion 
francs over 8 years, of which about 150 billion were already 
allocated before the end of 1993. 
  According to a senior military official, the army will thus 
be compelled to economize "on operational costs and abandon 
small programs," but also to cut major programs and delay those 
it wants to launch as soon as possible. Briefly put, it will 
have to dream of strong growth for better days ahead. 
  A compromise will be proposed to [President] Francois 
Mitterrand, who has expressed the hope that the ballistic 
missile M5 designed to replace the M45 on nuclear 
missile-launching submarines should not be sacrificed. The 
Defennse Ministry also proposes to delay putting this missile 
into service from 2005 to 2010 so as to limit its allocations in 
the next 6 years. On the other hand, studies will begin next 
year to modernize the Albion Plateau where Francois Mitterrand 
wants new nuclear missiles deployed in 2003, while numerous 
experts propose that this land component of the (nuclear) strike 
force be purely and simply abandoned. 
  In contrast, no decision will be made regarding the 
construction of a second nuclear aircraft carrier before 1997. 
This second aircraft carrier was requested by the Navy to 
replace the Foch, after the Charles de Gaulle, taking over from 
the Clemenceau, enters into service in 1999. 
  One of the most threatened programs, the NH90 European 
transport helicopter --launched in cooperation with Germany, the 
Netherlands, and Italy--will be the object of serious review 
next year. According to a military official, the specifications 
of this helicopter intended for the Navy and the Army will be 
reviewed so that the program's total cost (9 billion francs, of 
which 4.2 billion will go to industry and the state) be reduced 
by 20 to 30 percent. 
  The planning law does not envision new delays for the 
delivery of the Dassault-built Rafale fighter aircraft to the 
Air Force and the Navy in the year 2000. However, the number of 
aircraft may be reduced. This program alone is estimated at 178 
billion francs on the basis of 320 aircraft for the French 
armies. 
  The Leclerc tank may be scaled back. While 1,400 units were 
originally envisioned for the Army, the present target is 650, 
and there is even talk of 400 tanks. 
  The Army is also concerned about its total force. It should 
have 233,000 soldiers in 1997, compared to 290,000 in 1990 and 
241,000 in 1994. The Budget Ministry would like to reduce this 
number even further. 
  Prepared by the Defense Ministry in conjunction with the 
general staffs and the General Armaments Delegation (DGA), the 
bill will still be discussed next week by the office of the 
prime minister. It will be reviewed by the defense council and 
Francois Mitterand at the beginning of April, presented to the 
council of ministers at the end of April, and submitted to 
Parliament at the end of May.

  [Text] Paris, April 5 (AFP) -- Export orders for French 
weaponry fell by 12.5 percent in 1993, the Defence Ministry said 
Tuesday [5 April]. 
  The French armaments industry sold around 40 billion French 
francs (6.9 billion dollars) of military hardware in 1993 
compared to 45.7 billion French francs (7.89 billion dollars) in 
1992, it said. 
  The fall means the arms industry must increase foreign sales 
by 20 percent in 1994 if it is to meet the target set by Defence 
Minister Francois Leotard to earn over 50 billion French francs 
(8.63 billion dollars) in each of 1994 and 1995. 
  Recent statistics show wide fluctuations in the industry's 
performance. Its most successful year goes back to 1984 when it 
received orders from abroad worth 61.8 billion French francs 
(10.67 billion dollars). 
  This fell to just 20 billion francs (3.45 billion dollars) 
in 
1989 before rising again to 33.4 billion francs (5.77 billion 
dollars) in 1990 and 34.2 billion francs (5.91 billion dollars) 
in 1991. 
  The biggest order the French arms industry received in 1992 
was one for 60 Mirage 2000-5 planes from Taiwan worth 30 billion 
French francs (5.18 billion dollars), while in 1993 436 Leclerc 
tanks were sold to the United Arab Emirates for 22 billion 
French francs (3.8 billion dollars).

<F P=106> [Interview with Brice Lalonde, president of the Ecology </F>
Generation party and former environment minister, by Arnaud 
Hubert; place and date not given: "France Does Not Have Nuclear 
Policy"] 
  [Text] Brice Lalonde, the former environment minister, has 
just returned from a fact-finding visit to Russia and Ukraine 
and is drawing up a report on the nuclear power stations in 
those countries which he will submit to the European and French 
organizations in the coming weeks. The president of Ecology 
Generation thinks that the problems of the French civilian 
nuclear industry are only just beginning, but that the real 
urgency lies in Eastern Europe. 
  [Hubert] How do you interpret the Cadarache accident? 
  [Lalonde] I think we are busy experiencing what happened in 
the United States. Our sites are beginning to age, and age 
badly. This is a problem for which we are not prepared. I think 
that with regard to Rapsodie, the risks were underestimated. 
  [Hubert] Can or should this accident call into question the 
restarting of the Superphenix? 
  [Lalonde] I do not think that the two events should be 
linked. The only common point is that the Cadarache accident is 
due to sodium, which is found in very large quantities in 
Superphenix. But Superphenix is an installation which bears no 
resemblance to the Cadarache installation. Rapsodie was out of 
use and I have the impression that this tank was cleaned in a 
rather slipshod way. Whereas all the fairies are watching over 
Superphenix and protecting it. Superphenix had to be shut down 
less because of a possible danger -- which exists -- than 
because its design was fundamentally a mistake and it became a 
financial drain. It will one day be necessary to admit that 
this story of converting it into an incinerator is a total lie. 
  [Hubert] What do you now see as priorities in France? 
  [Lalonde] The first problem is Phenix, which strikes me as 
more of a weak link than Superphenix. We have just had a 
problem with the first of the line, the "grandfather," namely 
Rapsodie, in the dismantling of this reactor which no longer 
serves any purpose and the dangers of which were underestimated. 
We still have the Phenix, the "father," which ought to be shut 
down. Superphenix shuts down every five minutes because of 
alarms. The risk would lie in switching off the alarms so that 
they could no longer be heard. But if I was in government, I 
would ask for a report on Phenix. 
  [Hubert] Could safety be more effectively guaranteed in the 
French civilian nuclear industry? 
  [Lalonde] Of course. At present, we have a risk factor of 
one in 100 per year and per installation of an accident 
producing radioactive emissions. We ought to increase that to 
one in 1,000. Our engineers ought to be asked to improve this 
probability. They can do so, but they are not doing so because 
nobody has asked them to. In this country, there is a routine, 
there are habits, factions which continue their business, and 
politicians who do not know what orders to give. In short, 
there is no nuclear policy. 
  [Hubert] You have just returned from a fact-finding visit to 
Eastern Europe. Does what you saw there present a nuclear 
threat to Europe? 
  [Lalonde] Yes, there is a real abyss in Ukraine and Russia. 
That is where things will collapse first. The situation is 
deteriorating, especially because of Russian nationalism and the 
prevailing chaos. In Chernobyl, the population was moved. 
Almost 5,000 people were mobilized to clean up, they were 
ordered to do so because of the nature of the Communist regime 
still in place at the time. It would now be absolutely 
impossible to do that. The mechanisms of alternative 
democratic, administrative, and economic authorities have not 
been established. Russian nationalism proclaims that its power 
stations are the best in the world and that the Western 
countries have no role to play in them. Ukraine, for its part, 
depends almost 100 percent on Russians for its engineers and its 
spare parts. Anything which affects safety in Russia and in 
Ukraine comes second to production. 
  [Hubert] So there is a risk of a second Chernobyl or worse? 
  [Lalonde] Yes, and I am not sure that it is just a risk, I 
think it is a certainty, and at any time. Moreover, this is a 
very strange failure by our Western democracies. It is rather 
like Bosnia: We know, we watch, but we do nothing, or not much. 
  [Hubert] Does nuclear power still represent the future of 
the energy sector? 
  [Lalonde] It is not certain. It is one technology. The 
future rests more with renewable energy sources. The nuclear 
industry presupposes a great deal of virtue. At present it is 
like being on a road on which our engineers responsible for 
nuclear safety are driving while telling us: "You see, I don't 
have accidents! I'm driving at 110 km per hour and controlling 
my car." They forget one thing: There are other drivers who 
drive very badly. 
  [Hubert] You are very pessimistic. 
  [Lalonde] I am a realist. I realize to what extent this 
world is becoming a little more radioactive every day.

  [Text] "This move is a little strange. I think that he has 
lost his nerve." This was the first reaction of Umberto Bossi, 
leader of the Northern League, to the decision of Silvio 
Berlusconi to suspend negotiations with the League. 
  People, Bossi continued, can see that Berlusconi has broken 
off talks because of the fact that he is the one who wants to 
take charge. In that case we have not made a mistake in 
understanding that with a virtual party [as received] we are 
marching toward an autocratic type of government. We must now 
safeguard democracy. His nerves have got to him because he is 
used to having everything his own way immediately. He now finds 
himself face to face with an entire people. This is a very 
powerful force."

<F P=106> [Interview with Italian Northern League Secretary Umberto </F>
Bossi by Guido Passalacqua at Ponte di Legno; date not given: 
"Bossi's Broadside; `Democracy at Risk'"] 
  [Excerpt] Ponte di Legno -- [Passage omitted] [Passalacqua] 
Mr. Deputy, on Wednesday [6 April] you will start consultations 
with all the political forces in Rome. However, in Milan, your 
men, Roberto Maroni, [League lower house floor leader] and 
Speroni, are meeting with [Forza Italia leader] Silvio 
Berlusconi. Which of the two is the real negotiating table? 
The Roman or the Milanese one? 
  [Bossi] Everything is useful. I do my share. The League 
wants to understand and assess the maturity of the various 
political forces. We are living through an emergency situation 
which is dangerous for democracy. 
  [Passalacqua] What do you mean by dangerous? 
  [Bossi] Do you realize that the winner may be a nonexistent 
political force, Forza Italia -- an invented force -- and, 
moreover, that the winner may be a single man, Berlusconi? We 
do not want to be polemical, but we must be intellectually 
honest. Democracy is in danger, we had never before faced this 
kind of situation. Moreover, where can we go from here? 
  [Passalacqua] If, however, the League is forced to form a 
government with Berlusconi, will such a decision make sense? 
  [Bossi] Of course, in order to save democracy. 
  [Passalacqua] How is this? First you form an alliance, then 
you attack him. It is not very clear. 
  [Bossi] You see, people are asking us to be both the hangman 
and the victim. 
  [Passalacqua] How do you mean? 
  [Bossi] I could form a government with "Napoleon" 
[Berlusconi 
nickname] and then, since my hands would be tied, I would have 
to bash him with my head. I would have to do so every five 
minutes. I would have to act as democracy's custodian. In such 
a case, the League would be democracy's guarantor for the 
country. 
  [Passalacqua] If Berlusconi is Napoleon, who are you? 
  [Bossi] I am general Kuznetzov. He is Napoleon, but 
Kuznetzov won. 
  [Passalacqua] However, the Knight [Berlusconi nickname] is 
granting you federalism, which is your main objective. 
  [Bossi] It is not mentioned even once in his platform. I 
think that he does not even know what federalism means. It is 
not enough to say "yes." I will continue to highlight the 
Left's responsibility in this respect. It was Achille Occhetto 
[secretary of the Democratic Party of the Left, PDS] who 
legitimized him on television -- anything to defeat the League. 
  [Passalacqua] Many believe that you are saying all this in 
order to get a higher price. 
  [Bossi] It would be simpler for us not to have any ties -- 
very little would be enough. 
  [Passalacqua] Meaning? 
  [Bossi] It is apparent from everything I have said that the 
League is the only political force that can guarantee democracy, 
the only political force that can hem in Berlusconi, that can 
stop him, that can block the technocratic machinery set up by 
Berlusconi. 
  [Passalacqua] In short, are you the only person who can do 
all this? 
  [Bossi] The Left preferred to serve as a rival attraction to 
Forza Italia, it preferred to attack the League in the election 
campaign, without thinking of the consequences. 
  [Passalacqua] However, you have set up two negotiating 
tables, one in Milan and another, as of Wednesday, in Rome. Why 
is this? 
  [Bossi] I am in favor of a broad constituent government, as 
broad as possible. 
  [Passalacqua] What does as broad as possible mean? 
  [Bossi] It means as broad as possible. I think I am speaking 
clearly enough. I want to understand. I want to see who will 
agree to this. I need to muster quite a lot of support in 
parliament. The question is to start from the platforms, rather 
than from "I won, I lost." 
  [Passalacqua] But are you still insisting on the 
prerequisite 
that President Scalfaro entrusts you with the exploratory task? 
  [Bossi] I believe so. I think that the League is the first 
party in the Chamber of Deputies. 
  [Passalacqua] The president of the republic said that, in a 
democratic system, you must know how to talk things over. 
  [Bossi] Scalfaro must entrust us with this task for two 
reasons: a formal one, and an essential one. We are the first 
party, and people have voted for us as the guarantors and 
custodians of the Constitution. Berlusconi won, OK, but we know 
that behind him, the winners are Craxi and Andreotti. The 
other, formal, reason, is that we have the greatest number of 
deputies in the lower house. 
  [Passalacqua] What happens if Scalfaro does not entrust you 
with this task? 
  [Bossi] What can I do? You must make people understand what 
is happening. Each is staking his own credibility before his 
conscience. 
  [Passalacqua] Deputy Bossi, during the election campaign you 
repeatedly put forward two slogans, two conditions, at every 
rally: the first was "no" to Berlusconi as prime minister, the 
second was "no" to the MSI [Italian Social Movement] in 
government. 
  [Bossi] These are still our prerequisites. They remain 
intact. The problem can once again be posed in terms of 
federalism. We have seen the MSI opposing the regional 
governments in parliament. What sort of federalism do you think 
they could possibly favor? And Berlusconi -- are you aware of 
what he stands for? I believe the real prerequisite is not to 
give a mandate to anybody who represents all this. 
  [Passalacqua] In other words? 
  [Bossi] People have not understood the situation properly. 
For example, the Mammi law [on broadcasting] must be redrafted, 
we must clarify matters in this field. 
  [Passalacqua] You are saying that Forza Italia does not 
share 
a "common outlook" with the League. Berlusconi for his part is 
taking you to task, he is threatening you with the possibility 
of a split. 
  [Bossi] In this respect, Berlusconi is mistaken. Let him 
grasp this: We have no allies. Let him grasp this: We reached 
an agreement with him only to knock him down. 
  [Passalacqua] Berlusconi is saying that you are rehashing 
the 
Cencelli manual [power-sharing system]. 
  [Bossi] What right does this guy have to say anything, 
seeing 
that he is only interested in sharing power. He, of all people, 
who proposed a new twenty years [of fascist rule] when I spoke 
to him? 
  [Passalacqua] You claim the League played a decisive role in 
destroying the old system. Today Berlusconi is saying the 
opposite. Who is right? 
  [Bossi] What can I say -- these guys are just a recycled 
bunch. 
  [Passalacqua] In short, what is your opinion of Forza 
Italia? 
  [Bossi] Forza Italia does not share our outlook. It was born 
over a period of two years. Contrary to what is being said, it 
was a longstanding project. It then found its men within a 
period of 15 days, but there is nothing behind it. Forza Italia 
is not even a tool in anyone's hands. We should be calling 
Occhetto to account, given that he launched Forza Italia on TV 
together with [MSI Secretary] Gianfranco Fini. A nonexistent 
party was less frightening than a party like the League, that 
had shattered the establishment. 
  [Passalacqua] So, Occhetto is to blame? 
  [Bossi] They turned a blind eye. They sniggered, "Ha, ha," 
now we will pull a fast one on the League, we will now share its 
votes. 
  [Passalacqua] And now? 
  [Bossi] They are now confronting an uncontrollable 
phenomenon 
-- something dangerous enough, at times, to cause serious 
concern. 
  [Passalacqua] Serious concern? 
  [Bossi] Anybody controlling TV changes the normal course of 
events. 
  [Passalacqua] Meaning? 
  [Bossi] The risk is that this may become a technocratic 
mechanism capable of interfering with the normal course of 
democracy. 
  [Passalacqua] But could you govern together? 
  [Bossi] I do not know whether anybody can govern with that 
bunch. What people are asking the League today is not to give 
in as far as federalism is concerned. 
  [Passalacqua] You insist on a federal constitution, 
something 
which at least on paper, both Berlusconi and Fini are prepared 
to grant you. However, what will this constitution retain from 
the past? Many on the Left are demanding that the Resistance 
should not be disowned. For years you have been repeating that 
the League is anti-fascist. What have you got to say now? 
  [Bossi] I am saying that, as a continuation and at the same 
time as an overcoming of the constitution which was born by the 
people's struggle against the fascist dictatorship, what we need 
today against the partyocratic dictatorship is a federalist 
constitution. 
  [Passalacqua] As a continuation? 
  [Bossi] As a continuation.

  [Text] The leader of the National Alliance, Gianfranco 
Fini, has said that he is satisfied with the decision of Silvio 
Berlusconi to break off talks with the Northern League: "Other 
than a four-sided agreement which comprises the Forza Italia, 
the Northern League, the National Alliance and the Christian 
Democrat Center party, said Fini, there is room for nothing but 
an election. The only other possibility is a government made up 
of the League, the Party of the Democratic Left and the Italian 
Popular Party. If we returned to the polls, not a single 
representative of the League would be elected to parliament". 
  Berlusconi is right when he says that he cannot take 
anymore, 
continued Fini. " How can one carry on negotiations with someone 
who goes back on what they said the day before".

  [Text] Last night Silvio Berlusconi delivered an ultimatum 
to the Northern League following 48 hours of skirmishes with 
Umberto Bossi. The leader of Forza Italia said that 
negotiations were being broken off and that Oscar Luigi Scalfaro 
would have the task of appointing the government. Berlusconi 
said that if his party were chosen, it already had in place a 
team of ministers and a program for government that it would 
submit to a parliamentary vote. If rejected by parliament, 
Berlusconi said that the country would return to the polling 
booths in order to finish the clean-up operation. This view was 
shared by Gianfranco Fini [leader of the National Alliance] and 
by Pierferdinando Casini [leader of the Christian Democrat 
Center party]. 
  Meanwhile, the left is making positive overtures towards the 
Northern League. However, Roberto Maroni quickly extinguished 
any hopes. He said that it was one thing to contact all the 
parties concerning the issue of federalism, but it was another 
as far as governing the country was concerned. Maroni said that 
there could be no room for doubt; the task of government had to 
go to the Freedom Alliance -- the choice of the voters.

<F P=106> [Interview with Christian Democratic Center leader Clemente </F>
Mastella by Antonello Caporale in Rome; date not given: 
"Mastella -- If He Is in Earnest It Would Be Better To Vote 
Again in October"] 
  [Text] Rome -- "But then it is clear that we will vote 
again in October. If Bossi is in earnest, and I fear that he 
is, we will be back in the changing rooms drawing up a new team 
sheet." 
  So says Clemente Mastella, resurrected on Easter Monday [4 
April] ("I gave myself a period of sabbatical, but now I too am 
speaking out") to settle some scores, with the allies but also 
with his friends in the CCD [Christian Democratic Center] -- 
those Christian Democrats who preferred [Forza Italia leader] 
Silvio Berlusconi to Mino Martinazzoli, [secretary of the 
Italian Popular Party, PPI]. It is better to settle things once 
and for all, firstly with Pierferdinando Casini who is so active 
on TV and in the press but who, without the parachute of a 
proportional voting system under the banner of Forza Italia, 
would have failed. "Look at it this way: I am the only one who 
was elected using the first-past-the-post voting system. The 
only one who got through alone, against the progressive front 
and against the Italian Social Movement [MSI] which both put up 
candidates in my constituency." 
  So it is clear: If Bossi, the leader of the League, is the 
man of the north who defends the interests of the north, then 
Mastella, leader of the CCD, is the man of the south. Below the 
Garigliano river, you talk (and negotiate) with him. 
  [Mastella] From the point of view of freedoms, there are 
four 
allies, not three. Without us, and let us be clear about this, 
there is no majority. 
  [Caporale] So, Deputy Mastella, tell us what you think. 
  [Mastella] If the regions of the south are not brought to 
the 
fore, we will not agree to enter the government. 
  [Caporale] I do not believe it. Even you would play hard to 
get? 
  [Mastella] I see and I read names that are supposed to be 
part of the new executive. They are all people who speak the 
same dialect, and that is not a good thing. I then read about 
plans that would appear to reduce southern Italy to a beggar's 
role, a parasite tugging at Italy's sleeve. I do not go along 
with that. 
  [Caporale] Is it a question of seats in government? 
  [Mastella] The makeup of the government is not decided in 
Milan. 
  [Caporale] Bossi says it is. 
  [Mastella] Bossi is wrong, very wrong. 
  [Caporale] Why is he wrong? 
  [Mastella] Because without the votes of my group, there is 
no 
government. There is no majority in the Senate. 
  [Caporale] Bossi wants federalism. 
  [Mastella] Federalism is fine, but solidarity with the 
weakest areas of population must not be questioned. 
  [Caporale] So...? 
  [Mastella] So turning off the money supply to invalid 
pensions is great, but at the same time we must offer other 
sources of income. Those pensions, in their way, are social 
shock absorbers. If they are eliminated once and for all, there 
will be an explosion of anger in the south. 
  [Caporale] Bossi does not want Berlusconi as prime minister. 
  [Mastella] Nor can the League ask for the position for 
itself, or there will be a big fuss. It is a force tied to a 
territory which, unluckily for it, does not correspond to the 
territory of Italy which remains one indivisible whole. 
  [Caporale] Berlusconi, on the other hand... 
  [Mastella] People voted for Berlusconi in the south because 
he is a popular man, and it was the leader of the alliance who 
won. It is our duty to respect the will of the electorate. 
  [Caporale] Bossi says that he will have nothing to do with 
the MSI. 
  [Mastella] He is irresponsible. The people have clearly 
stated which government they want. He is forced to respect the 
agreement that was made before the vote. However, I am not sure 
that Bossi, if he carries on like that, will be able to retain 
control of the group. 
  [Caporale] But your split could endanger [President] 
Scalfaro. To whom should he give the job? 
  [Mastella] To the leader of the majority. 
  [Caporale] But is not the League the largest party in 
parliament? 
  [Mastella] These considerations also depend on our decision 
on whether to constitute a separate group or whether to join up 
with Forza Italia. 
  [Caporale] The task falls to Berlusconi, but he does not 
take 
it up because Bossi is opposed to it. Will Scalfaro have to 
yield? 
  [Mastella] If the leader of the majority does not take the 
job, it is only right for the leader of the opposition to try. 
Bossi could then try and go into government with the 
communists. If he tries, after three months we will be voting 
again, but this time with a different lineup. We in the center 
will be finally united and associated with the Right. We will 
no longer need him...

<F P=106> [Unattributed interview with Italian Christian Democratic </F>
Center leader Pierferdinando Casini in Rome; date not given: 
"Casini: `He is Prime Minister, but on the Antitrust Law...'"] 
  [Excerpt] Rome -- [Passage omitted] [Correspondent] Mr. 
Casini, [League Secretary] Umberto Bossi is raising his price, 
saying the League must be the one to designate the prime 
minister. Whom do you want to see in the Palazzo Chigi 
[government seat]? 
  [Casini] The demands made of [Forza Italia leader] Silvio 
Berlusconi, who leads the coalition, must be possible, not 
patently absurd. We CCD [Christian Democratic Center] members 
are asking him to follow in the footsteps of Antonio Segni 
[former president and 1950's agriculture minister], a rich 
landowner who pushed through the agriculture reform. Berlusconi 
must form the government and put the antitrust law issue on the 
agenda. Having said that, he may count on our full support. 
  [Correspondent] But Bossi says that the League is the first 
party, so it is not a foregone conclusion that Berlusconi will 
necessarily be the next prime minister. You are in the same 
alliance, what is your answer to that? 
  [Casini] It is news to me that Bossi has 51 percent of seats 
in parliament. When the head of state summons the parliamentary 
groups, each one will put forward its nominee. We will be 
putting forward Berlusconi's name. 
  [Correspondent] What does the CCD want for itself in the 
next government? 
  [Casini] First of all, we are going to aim for inclusion in 
the program a number of essential conditions which are close to 
the hearts of Catholics: concrete legislation in favor of the 
family, pluralism in education -- with equal treatment for the 
public and private sectors -- and a real boost to political 
commitment in favor of the south. Naturally, we will also aim 
to safeguard another principle: National unity cannot be 
questioned. I have also heard talk of purges in the civil 
service and the RAI [state broadcasting corporation]. While 
those who are clearly inept and dishonest must of course go, 
there should be no discrimination of any sort against those who 
are honest and professionally competent. 
  [Correspondent] You say that national unity as a principle 
is not open to discussion. That will set you at loggerheads 
with the League, even though that party is one of your allies. 
  [Casini] We refuse to question the nation's indissolubility. 
On the other hand, for example, fiscal federalism supplemented 
by a solidarity fund is part of our program. 
  [Correspondent] Those are your demands as far as the program 
is concerned. Now, I agree the DC [Christian Democratic Party] 
is finished... but you cannot expect me to believe that the CCD 
does not want any ministries for itself. 
  [Casini] Our demands will be in proportion to the expertise 
we can provide and our weight in terms of numbers... To give 
you an example, I notice a number of newspapers mention my name 
as a candidate for the health ministry, which is unquestionably 
a sector of primary importance. Apart from the fact that I am 
not at all willing to take on a government post, I would not 
dream of becoming a public health hazard. I know absolutely 
nothing about health. 
  [Correspondent] So who will be joining the government from 
the CCD? Mastella, Fumagalli, D'Onofrio? 
  [Casini] I have no specific names in mind, but there is no 
point in discussing them yet anyway. The best thing is for the 
prime minister designate to decide on the composition of his 
government. 
  [Correspondent] You did not show all this sense of fair play 
when you were in the DC. You must have some preferences at least 
as to which ministries you would like. 
  [Casini] Those which have some relevance to our values. I 
could mention institutional reform, education, or defense, where 
I am against the idea of placing any generals. Generals are 
just fine inside the officers' mess or helping parliamentary 
committees with their expertise. 
  [Correspondent] [National Alliance leader] Gianfranco Fini 
has repeated that "[former Fascist dictator] Mussolini is the 
greatest statesman of the century." What is your response to 
that? 
  [Casini] I am in total disagreement with Fini over that, at 
least as much as I agree with many of the other opinions he has 
expressed in the past few days. In fact I will be even more 
explicit. I can see Fini and us working together over the next 
few years to finally build a popular, moderate, political 
grouping. But for my money, the greatest statesman this century 
was [postwar DC leader] De Gasperi... 
  [Correspondent] Do you see Fini renouncing Fascism? 
  [Casini] What I saw in Fini was a break with the past when 
the National Alliance was created. Besides, I notice there is 
no "Fascist Renewal" in Italy, while there is a Communist 
Renewal. 
  [Correspondent] Mino Martinazzoli's Popular Party is in a 
crisis. Are they waiting for somebody to go knock on their door? 
  [Casini] That is of no interest to us. What is of interest 
to us, on the other hand, is that the Popular Party [PPI] should 
change course. Indeed many PPI members tell us: You made a 
mistake, but you were right. I answer that we still disagree 
over the method, but I hope to see a rapprochement between them 
and the pole for freedom.

  [Text] President Glavkos Kliridhis has expressed his 
displeasure and disappointment at the contents of the UN 
secretary general's report to the Security Council, adding that 
the contents of the report have been substantially amended after 
the intervention of third parties. 
  In a written statement, President Kliridhis also notes that 
he appreciates the effort being made to avoid further failure in 
the discussions of the confidence-building measures [CBM's] but 
he strongly disagrees with ignoring the fact that the CBM's have 
been discussed since last May and since then the negative 
attitudes have come in every case from the Turkish side. 
  President Kliridhis adds: Instead of this leading to the 
correct realization that the Turkish side does not have the 
political will either to implement the CBM's or to allow 
agreement to be reached on the substance of the Cyprus issue, 
and instead of suggesting to the Security Council that alternate 
ways to promote a solution be looked at, the resumption of talks 
on the CBM's is being requested. The president stresses: It is 
obvious that this is done in order to satisfy further demands by 
the Turkish side. 
  The president continues in his statement: I have stated 
repeatedly and categorically to both of the UN secretary 
general's representatives, Joe Clark and Gustave Feissel, and to 
Mr. Robert Lamb, the U.S. State Department special coordinator 
on the Cyprus issue, that despite my objections to the second 
non-paper, which was actually submitted to satisfy Mr. Rauf 
Denktas, I avoided raising my objections in order to facilitate 
progress on an agreement. Mr. Kliridhis further says: I 
pointed out repeatedly that Mr. Denktas continues to raise 
objections and demand amendments. I could feel obliged to raise 
my own objections as well, but then the gap would widen. The 
president further notes: My firm position is that I will not 
accept discussion of any new document or discussion of any 
further amendments to the latest UN document. 
  President Kliridhis concludes: However, I reiterate 
emphatically that I accept the latest UN document as it stands.

  [Excerpts] Government spokesman Ioannis Kasoulidhis made it 
clear that President Glavkos Kliridhis considers any further 
effort by the United Nations to reach an agreement on the 
confidence-building measures as useless, because he believes the 
Turkish side does not have the political will to reach an 
agreement. The government spokesman stressed that the Greek 
Cypriot side cannot keep accepting amendments that aim at 
satisfying [Turkish Cypriot leader] Rauf Denktas. [passage 
omitted] 
  In a statement, Democratic Rally [DISI] notes that the 
Butrus-Ghali report is disappointing and a result of 
intervention by third parties. The statement adds that the 
spirit and contents of the report already raise serious 
questions about the intentions and goals of the United Nations, 
which, it continues, together with outside interests, serves the 
Turkish demand for final division of Cyprus instead of the 
settlement of the Cyprus issue. DISI calls on all political 
forces to proceed with dialogue and cooperation to formulate a 
common stance to deal with the situation. 
  Democratic Party [DIKO] Chairman Spiros Kiprianou describes 
the Butrus-Ghali report as an unacceptable one, which, he adds, 
seeks to satisfy the Turkish positions through the intervention 
of third parties. Kiprianou added that this situation should be 
put to an end, and our side should seek disengagement and 
promote discussion of the substance of the Cyprus issue, with 
priority on the issue of the Turkish troops, settlers, and 
security. 
  The Free Democrats Movement announced that even though 
Turkish intransigence is more than obvious, the UN secretary 
general refrains from blaming the Turkish side and asks for 
extension of the process to reach an agreement on amended ideas. 
The Free Democrats reaffirmed their position on the immediate 
return to discussion of the substance of the Cyprus issue.

  [Text] Lefkose, April 5 (A.A.) -- Turkish Republic of 
Northern Cyprus (TRNC) President Rauf Denktas described the 
report of UN secretary general on Cyprus as `realistic' on 
Tuesday [6 April]. 
  "The report is realistic in statements on the concerns of 
the 
Turkish side and on the continuation of negotiations," Denktas 
said. "However, the finger is still pointing to the Turkish 
side." 
  Denktas answered questions of the press on the report of 
Secretary General Butrus Butrus-Ghali, which evaluates the 
shuttle talks held by his envoys with the Turkish and Greek 
Cypriot leaders, on the confidence-building measures formulated 
by the United Nations. 
  Denktas said that the original confidence-building measures 
contained arrangements which safeguarded the rights of both 
sides. 
  "The changes made on the measures, gives priority and rights 
to Greek Cypriots and spoils the position of the Turkish Cypriot 
side," he said. 
  Denktas added that the Turkish Cypriot side was ready to 
resume talks, to resolve the Cyprus issue. 
  He stressed that Butrus-Ghali should not expect the Turkish 
Cypriot side to accept the `non-document document' of March 21, 
of Ghali, which modified the confidence-building measures 
package. 
  "The promises which have been made to us, do not render our 
gains concrete," he said. 
  "The second document is unacceptable to us in many points," 
he said. "If a message, which says, `I will put pressures on the 
Turks' is given, then why should the Greek Cypriots change its 
position?" 
  He added that if an agreement is reached between the sides, 
the Greek Cypriots will be allowed to enter the currently 
uninhabited section of TRNC within four months, while Turks will 
be allowed in after 12 months. 
  "What if Greek Cypriots violate the agreement meanwhile?" he 
asked. 
  The UN-formulated confidence-building measures originally 
envisaged to place the Maras [Varosha] section of the TRNC under 
UN control and open the Lefkose [Nicosia] Airport to 
international traffic. 
  Cyprus has been divided since 1974 when Turkey conducted a 
peace operation to the island following a Greek-backed coup 
attempt to annex the island to Greece. 
  The TRNC came into existence in 1983.

<F P=106> [Teoman Turan report: "Greek Cypriots Act With Ill Will" -- </F>
punctuation as published] 
  [Text] In an exclusive statement to SABAH, TRNC [Turkish 
Republic of Northern Cyprus] Foreign and Defense Minister Atay 
Ahmet Rasit, who is one of the most influential Democratic Party 
members in the coalition government in north Cyprus, assessed 
relations between the Turkish and Greek Cypriots. Ahmet Rasit 
said that cooperation between the Greek Cypriot side and the 
Kurdish Workers Party [PKK] when talks are being held on the 
confidence-building measures is inadmissible. He said: "The 
Greek Cypriots have claimed that they are making an effort to 
achieve a durable peace. However, they continue to support the 
PKK, which the entire world regards as a terrorist organization. 
How can that be equated with goodwill?" 
  Stressing that the Turkish Cypriot side has proved that it 
has acted with goodwill as much as possible until now, Ahmet 
Rasit said: "Taking into consideration the UN recommendations, 
the Turkish Cypriot side indicated when the talks began that it 
was prepared to trust the Greek Cypriots. However, they do not 
wish to trust us at all. In view of that, it would be 
meaningless for us to trust the Greek Cypriots who do not wish 
to reciprocate." 
  Ahmet Rasit described Maras [Varosha] and Nicosia 
International Airport, which has been closed for 20 years, as 
two key issues in the Cyprus problem. He said: "The problem is 
the question of access to Maras through Dherinia. According to 
the package, travel through that area will be unrestricted 
without any formality. We have agreed to that principle. 
However, not satisfied with that, the Greek Cypriots have moved 
to ask for more." 
  Stressing that the friction between the two sides was not 
due 
to disputes between individuals, Ahmet Rasit expressed the 
conviction that the two communities, which have been forced by 
history and geographic conditions to live together, can coexist 
in peace by respecting each other's religion, language, and 
origin. 
  Ahmet Rasit said that they may consider holding a referendum 
on whether or not the Turkish Cypriot side should continue to 
participate in the indirect talks if the UN secretary general 
submits a report to the Security Council critical of the Turkish 
Cypriot side. Furthermore, he stressed that more work has to be 
done on the confidence-building measures package, and noted that 
the Turkish Cypriot side will maintain its effort to find a 
solution. 
  Ahmet Rasit also stressed that the coalition government in 
north Cyprus, which came to power after the elections on 12 
December 1993, is working together in harmony.

  [Text] Leading Free Democratic Party [FDP] politicians are 
angry with FRG Justice Minister Sabine 
Leutheusser-Schnarrenberger (FDP, 42)! Some of her party 
colleagues resent her criticism of the deportation of violent 
Kurds from Bavaria. The minister is of the view that Turkey is 
not a "safe country of origin." 
  Deputy FDP Chairman Wolfgang Gerhardt: "Turkey has signed 
the international agreements against torture and the death 
penalty. The credibility of our rule-of-law state gets into 
danger if violent criminals cannot be deported. It cannot be 
that the FRG must accept any acts of violence committed by 
foreigners without doing something against that, just because of 
the behavior of other countries." 
  FDP legal expert Burkhard Zurheide: "The Bavarian 
authorities are acting correctly. Anyone who commits acts of 
violence in our country must be deported as quickly as possible. 
We cannot permit the state to be undermined by the deeds of 
violent Kurds. 
  "We also deport criminal foreigners to other countries where 
the death penalty still exists. They just have to assure us 
that they will not sentence the person in question to death."

  [Text] I think that the German heraldic beast, the federal 
eagle, has lame wings. It has a left wing that is excitedly 
fluttering, an inflated belly, and a limply drooping right wing. 
This right wing must be strengthened again. Germany needs a 
democratically legitimated rightist party. This is us, the 
Republikaner. We understand ourselves as the party of social 
patriotism. We categorically reject any hoorah patriotism, 
which has not learned anything from history. 
  When we demand that German identity must be preserved, this 
must not -- as the media constantly try to do -- be interpreted 
as xenophobia. But we do not want to become strangers in our 
own country. 
  We also understand ourselves as the party of law and order. 
We do not want Germany to be liberalized to death. The 
increasing moral decay must be counteracted. Young people must 
be reminded of their responsibility toward their own people and 
toward the older generation. The pact between the generations 
has been virtually broken. 
  People should not be guided by personal or group egotism but 
by the sense of responsibility toward a state, which, however, 
must not limit its citizens' democratic room for maneuver and 
must guarantee liberal basic rights.

<F P=106> [Article by Werner A. Perger: "A Cool Fighter Who Is Putting </F>
an End to the Foolishness"] 
  [Text]Rudolf Scharping embodies Social Democracy's will to 
win. He has lined up the Social Democratic Party [SPD] behind 
him, and he intends to lead it to power. 
  More than ever in this government's tenure, a change of 
power 
is in the air, and this quiet preliminary hint of spring has a 
name: Rudolf Scharping. Strangely unobtrusively, somehow as if 
it were an incidental matter, the 46-year-old man from the 
Westerwald has established himself in the public consciousness. 
Gradually, he is imparting concrete features to the post-Kohl 
era. 
  The boss. Even though he is not yet very 
well-known, thanks to his omnipresence, he is an old 
acquaintance. There is something self-evident about his claim to 
power. That is, perhaps, the most important prerequisite for the 
change that Scharping wants to bring about. 
  Almost single-handedly, he has led the party to its current 
position, within reach of power. With persuasion, a great 
investment of time, and toughness. He has compelled many a 
consensus. The fact that Scharping becomes massive where he 
senses resistance was something critics within the party 
encountered first-hand in his Rhineland-Palatinate land 
association. Anyone this stubborn man at the helm himself 
perceives to be stubborn is in for a rough ride. One of his 
colleagues says: "Rudolf has a long memory for such things." 
  Scharping himself considers patience and fortitude to be his 
virtues in this way. The process matters, not the result. The 
result decides, not the moment. He says: "Whoever wants 
everything in the result comes acropper in the process." 
  Rudolf Scharping cites an example: some at the party 
convention in Wiesbaden would have criticized him for not 
honoring the importance of women. Now, however, the party--as a 
result of his leadership--is appointing two women to the Supreme 
Court, the result of a lengthy process of which the unworthy 
hanger-on party surrounding the candidacy of Herta 
Daeubler-Gmelin was a part. She herself put an end to the wicked 
game by her refusal. "Results count, not the event," says 
Sharping. Have you got that? 
  Scharping and his party. He has travelled a long road to 
align the SPD behind his will to power and to unite it to his 
strategy of power. In the processes, differences were planed 
away that it would have been preferable to retain. Distinctions 
from other parties grow pale. The SPD is pushing its way to 
power through the middle. Heiner Geissler speaks of a "Christian 
Democratization of the SPD." He says that is dangerous for the 
Christian Democratic Union [CDU]. There hardly are any 
distinctions between the major parties any longer, say, almost 
in unison, members of the left-wing Frankfurt circle and 
commentators of the FRANKFURTER ALLGEMEINE, by no means 
left-wing, alike. Scharping himself claims to be quite close to 
the foreign and security policies of Kohl and Kinkel. His 
message is: have no fear. A change at the top will bring no 
change in foreign policy. By taking flight forward, he also 
considers the issue of internal security to be disarmed. 
Liberals and members of the left wing might well grit their 
teeth and moan: "Internal security is a real issue; that must be 
taken seriously by a left-wing party, otherwise `deepest 
sympathies.'" 
  On the road to power today, the watchword is: "Discord 
confuses the voters. Unity calms them." In the SPD, which is 
notorious for its discord, Scharping has prevailed in large 
measure, politically as well as personally, with commensurate 
expenditures of time and energy. "No path too long, no time too 
precious," he says of this part of his leadership work. 
  Since the members elected him chairman in a preliminary 
election, he has been on his way within the party. There is 
hardly a regional party convention in which he does not 
participate. But, he also takes prudent care of the neglected 
egos of the Social Democratic grandees: he honors milestone 
birthdays in the establishment, if possible, by his presence, 
especially the 50th, which is an ever-increasing occurrence 
among the "grandchildren," a group among which he, the youngest 
in this age group, has not really been counted for a long time. 
  He has just learned the extent to which the new feeling of 
commonality and closed ranks has come to rest upon him. Sent to 
his sickbed for a week with a gastro-intestinal virus, the old 
Social Democratic miseries threaten to break out once more, 
namely the quarrel about traditions and changing them, the 
quarrel of the just cause, and the personal pecking order. By 
telephone, radio, television, and in the press, Scharping 
followed the SPD fight for long-term care insurance, the 
somewhat premature notification from the "barracks" that the 
chance of reaching agreement with the coalition, with Dressler's 
"not with me you don't" blustering, and Verheugen's cool "that 
is just a single opinion" could be seen. 
  That was more than the chairman could take. Still a bit 
wobbly on his legs (and nine pounds lighter), on the week-end he 
hurried, as a surprise guest to the Congress of the Task Force 
for Employee-Related Questions (AfA) in Koblenz and vented his 
spleen: "We cannot continue to dance at the same monkeys' ball 
that brought us down to the cellar." In the end, he got a 
standing ovation, though he may, in the final analysis, have to 
climb over Dressler's objections. Anyone who wants to lead 
simply cannot allow himself to be ill. 
  The Party. Scharping is a do-it-yourselfer, a 
student of the files, someone who always did his homework, in 
that point, not unlike his predecessor's predecessor, 
Hans-Jochen Vogel. But Scharping is also a team player; he can 
delegate--so much so, that his colleagues often moan. 
  Politically, he works particularly closely with Guenter 
Verheugen, the national managing director. A relationship of 
trust has grown between the two that is--if the insiders are not 
exaggerating--a rarity in this business. Strategically, their 
mechanisms tick in much the same way. Their instructions to the 
party are unadornedly tough: Closed ranks, no little games, no 
more political hanky-panky (for example, discussions of a 
red-green coalition). Clinton's campaign, and it's internal 
guiding motto, It's the economy, stupid! serves 
pretty much as the model. Anyone who has other concerns is 
rocking the boat. Anyone who speaks of visions should--to 
paraphrase the Austrian head freely--seek the advice of a 
physician. Verheugen recommends reduction to the essentials, 
"the Social Democratization of the SPD" one might say, even if 
that is not terribly exciting. 
  A decade and a half ago, when Scharping was just working his 
way up through the ranks of the Mainz SPD Landtag 
caucus, Verheugen, 49 years old, and a bit of a hack, had just 
organized a successful campaign for the Free Democratic Party 
[FDP] alongside SPD Chancellor Schmidt against the Christian 
Social Union [CSU] candidate Strauss. He knows his business, and 
its tricks, even the dirty ones. Now, even Verheugen senses, for 
the first time since reunification, when he switched to the SPD, 
that a change in power is in the wind. Perhaps that is why he 
reacted so sharply to Dressler. His first error, from 
Scharping's viewpoint, but with public censure, that, too, is 
cleared away. And Verheugen is too "cool" to let the canker 
gnaw. It is all in a day's work. Besides: "As party chairman, 
Scharping has the greatest authority since Willy Brandt." Bow 
down and be done with it. 
  The "barracks" have been beefed up. An old pro, Joachim 
Boudre-Groeger, former head of the National Managing Director 
Bahr's office, a schooled diplomat, is back on loan to party 
central, having served about 15 years in the foreign service--as 
Ambassador to Vietnam, among other things. 
  There he is Verheugen's deputy, and at the same time 
"technical campaign leader:" organizer of everything that would 
serve to bring about a change of power. 
  Reinforcements were also brought in from Hamburg: Claus Noe, 
as state counselor to Hamburg's Senator for the Economy, who 
left office after the SPD quasi coalition was formed, a man of 
long experience in Bonn. For lack of space, Oskar Lafontaine 
left the new man his desk in the "barracks;" Noe will, above 
all, act as an adjunct to his work, as an aide in formulating 
things, possibly as an advisor as well. But who knows? Perhaps, 
after the campaign work he has done, in the fall of the super 
election year, in addition to Noe's expertise, perhaps his 
experience in the failed Hamburg coalition negotiations with the 
Greens will be in demand as well. 
  Finally, there is Monday's cloverleaf. Scharping's inner 
campaign leadership. Of course, Verheugen will be a part of it, 
then, from Duesseldorf, there is the head of the state chancery 
and potential Rau successor, Wolfgang Clement; from 
Saarbruecken, Lafontaine's presumed successor, Reinhard Klimmt, 
chairman of the SPD Landtag caucus and Lafontaine 
confidant; and, from Mainz, the head of Scharping's state 
chancery, one-time and last office director of Willy Brandt's up 
to the time of his resignation as party chairman. On the 
outside, the significance of this crew is put too high. It is 
not making any political decisions. It is just planning the 
day-to-day routine of the super election year. 
  The axis. Perhaps everything would take a 
different turn if Scharping had not patched things up with 
"Oskar." At the present time, in the SPD, nothing can be done 
against Lafontaine, the deputy party chairman. It is a preferred 
position; it makes the failed chancellor candidate of 1990 a 
critical entity within his party. A strong partner, or a 
dangerous opponent. Scharping had to make a decision. 
  Lafontaine would, most preferably, have become candidate for 
the chancellorship when Engholm so relatively unexpectedly 
dropped out. Somehow or other, he felt the expectation last 
year, and promptly caused it to grow to a palpable illusion that 
a newly elected party chairman, Scharping, would offer him, 
"Oskar," this peak position, perhaps after a brief hesitation, 
or possibly just pro forma. No matter, he would have grabbed it. 
The 1990 defeat hurt him more than the memory of the attack that 
same year. He would, only too gladly, have settled his political 
accounts with Kohl, and with some in his own party, with an 
election victory. 
  But Scharping's offer was not forthcoming. The new chairman, 
who does not play second fiddle to Lafontaine by any means when 
it comes to desire for power, indicated interests of his own. 
Lafontaine was not even offended. But then, Scharping's charm 
offensive began, and he courted none so much as the seething 
lion from adjacent Saarbruecken, attentions that were intended 
to yield results. A political partnership seems to be placed on 
new footings, an alliance with one common goal: a change at the 
helm. 
  In terms of content, the axis has already withstood a few 
stress trials, particularly where the new economic 
belt-tightening and realism of thrift of the Scharping SPD is 
being debated. Holding the line, saving, shifting things around, 
rebuilding, nothing is permitted to cost more than before, every 
reform must be cost-neutral. That is the message both preach. 
They make a plea for lowering overhead, clearly turn down every 
increase in taxes and disbursements ("The limits of what can be 
tolerated have been reached"); they demand tax-incentives for 
investors (in keeping with the stability and growth law), warn 
grim tariff fighters in their own party to be flexible and 
realistic ("...not to be more radical in their rhetoric than the 
trade unions themselves.") That is not easy in a party in which 
Rudolf Dressler is not an outsider. The debate is bitter, little 
as Scharping likes it, much as Lafontaine grips his head 
afterward (as if he wanted, like another supereconomist before 
him, to despair in his own party: "alas, how much ignorance is 
there in this world..."). 
  Thanks to his somewhat strong-arm manner, the man from 
Saarbruecken now serves the left-wingers of the party as a sort 
of bogeyman. They criticize him especially as a lackey of the 
neoconservatives, in the face of whose policies of 
consolidation, which are not social in nature, Scharping is, 
when measured against Lafontaine, cut from different cloth 
altogether. That is what was said at the final meeting of the 
Frankfurt circle three weeks ago, but he does not want to let it 
stand. The axis remains. A few days later, before the SPD party 
council, Scharping insisted that the governmental quotient--that 
portion of all state expenditures of the GNP not be expanded, 
not even under an SPD regime. He made it clear that the idea was 
not just something that the wicked Oskar had dreamt up: "All 
those who think they could cozy up to Oskar in these matters had 
better realize they would have to cozy up to me in the same way." 
  The chancellor candidate and his economist, a strong union. 
They embody the SPD's will to power and they stand for the 
possibility that this year, after many rounds of voting, with 
risks for the government and the opposition alike that cannot 
yet be assessed, for the first time in Germany's postwar 
history, the opposition may come to power by being voted in. The 
hopes of many, of getting rid of the "fatso" and his "carbonara 
round" after 12 years, and perhaps, even of getting rid of the 
liberals, who have been playing a role in Bonn now for a quarter 
of a century, much too long, rest particularly with Rudolf 
Scharping. That would be, where everything else has changed, 
certainly a considerable step, by what then? Does Scharping, 
does Lafontaine, stand for new things? Do they promise anything 
more than a continuation of the old by new means? These are 
questions that the new, no longer so very young generation of 
the SPD must first answer. 
  In an interview, Scharping says he has little time to woo 
trust. It is as if he were asking for an advance. He senses the 
impatience among those who still see the sense of politics, he 
can imagine the expectations. The meetings that are filled to 
overflowing create hope. "Stop talking about being annoyed," he 
tells the party. It would be possible to convince oneself to do 
that. "I, myself, sense annoyance at being annoyed," he mocks. 
And he thinks he can sense that there is something stirring 
throughout the country. A change in mood. A mood to change the 
powers that be.
