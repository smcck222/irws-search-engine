<F P=106> [Unattributed report: "Ten Points About Hartmut Bagger"] </F>
  [Text] Lieutenant General Hartmut Bagger, new Army 
inspector, does "not" want to lead the Armed Forces "in line 
with political desires." 
<H5>  Origin </H5>
  Born 17 July 1938 in Braunsberg/Eastern Prussia. Found a new 
home near Celle after fleeing from Eastern Prussia. Graduated 
from the Protestant-Pietist high school of the Hermannsburg 
Mission in 1958. 
<H5>  Choice of Profession </H5>
  The lieutenant general smiles. His decision to become a 
career soldier -- branch of service: armored infantry -- was 
seen by his "strictly and rather narrowly" religious teachers as 
an "act of youthful unruliness." 
<H5>  Career </H5>
  Bagger is considered to be a "soldiers' man." In 1976 he 
became battalion commander in Rotenburg/Fulda, in 1984 brigade 
head in Hamburg-Fischbek, in 1990 division general in Wuerzburg. 
His military-political profile was developed in the Command 
Staff of the Armed Forces in Bonn and at the Command Academy in 
Hamburg. 
<H5>  Alliance Experience </H5>
  The new army chief also gained experience with the alliance 
unspectacularly in the daily life of the troops rather than at 
the green table of NATO headquarters: "The staff work in 
Hamburg, for instance, was closely linked with the Dutch, that 
in Wuerzburg with the Americans." 
<H5>  Style </H5>
  Calm determination. Listening and watching closely as 
command virtues. Is able to laugh heartily, also about himself. 
<H5>  Worries </H5>
  Lt. Gen. Hartmut Bagger comes to the head of the still 
250,000-man strong Bundeswehr during a period of unprecedented 
upheaval: "Over the past two years one out of two professional 
soldiers has had to move, some even twice." 
  He is "grateful" to Alfred Biehle, the Bundestag defense 
commissioner, for the warning about reeling troop morale. 
<H5>  Hopes </H5>
  The Armed Forces must "not be led in line with political 
desires and they need a reliable basis for planning." 
  The changed assignment will make make the career of being a 
professional soldier more attractive, because "international 
experiences, also on other continents" are beckoning. 
<H5>  Goals </H5>
  Establishing the new command structure by the end of 1995. 
Not allowing the Bundeswehr to be run down to become a 
two-class army -- superior crisis reaction forces, inferior 
national defense. 
  This is one of the reasons that compulsory military service 
must be preserved: "Half of the young officers and almost 
two-thirds of the noncommissioned officers come from compulsory 
military service." 
<H5>  Interests </H5>
  "My family" (two sons). And his second, art-loving nature. 
Bagger plays the piano and paints water-colors of flowers and 
landscapes. 
<H5>  Dream </H5>
  Perfecting my organ playing, which I have neglected since my 
schooldays and "playing myself to exhaustion" after retirement.

<F P=106> [Report by Michael J. Inacker: "Defense Ministry Examines </F>
Concept for New Helicopter and Tank Transporter"] 
  [Text] Bonn -- The Bonn Defense Ministry is currently 
considering the purchase of a warship that is unlike any sailing 
under German flag now or in the past. It is a combined command, 
medical, and logistics ship for crisis operations that can be 
used as a troop transporter at the same time and can also carry 
six to 10 helicopters. 
  These considerations have been triggered by the experience 
of 
the Bundeswehr during its Somalia mission. For last month's 
withdrawal of the 1,300 troops, the Defense Ministry had to use 
a frigate equipped for naval battle and a supply ship that had 
to move up within firing range of possible snipers at the 
Mogadishu jetty in order to pick up the troops. 
  Following this experience, Bundeswehr General Inspector 
Klaus 
Naumann asked the Navy to do a study into costs, efficiency, and 
feasibility of a special ship that combines the multiple 
functions needed in crisis operations, which have not been 
required by the Bundeswehr so far. 
  According to Naumann, the question is "whether and how the 
Navy can provide platforms for command, transport, supply, and 
medical care to support operations involving various sections of 
the forces." WELT AM SONNTAG has been informed that the Navy 
has already presented its first proposals. 
  At 15,000 to 20,000 tonnes displacement, the ship would be 
the biggest one in the Navy. In their considerations, the 
German planners are using as a model an existing project of the 
Dutch Navy for an "amphibious transport ship" that is to be put 
into operation in 1996. 
  The German planners in the Defense Ministry think that the 
ship, based on the Dutch model, would have the following 
features: 
  -- Besides a crew of 150 soldiers, the ship should provide 
room for a battalion-strength Bundeswehr contingent (600 to 800 
troops), including vehicles and supplies. 
  -- It should also carry a medical unit with a capacity of 
100 
beds -- also to be used for humanitarian relief missions. 
  -- Furthermore, it should contain a command unit that allows 
contact to be maintained with Germany and a unit operating on 
shore. 
  -- A big flight deck with a hangar is required for picking 
up 
land forces. Six to 10 medium-sized transport helicopters of 
the NH-90 type could be positioned there. CH-53 type Army 
helicopters could also land on the deck. 
  -- For picking up land forces at sea, the commando ship 
would 
also carry several landing boats. 
  According to the Dutch plans, such a ship must have some 
1,500 cubic meters of cargo space, holding 30 tanks of the Leo-2 
type (two tank companies), or 60 "Marder" armored combat 
vehicles. 
  In view of these requirements, such a ship would have to be 
at least 160 meters long and 25 meters wide. 
  The Dutch Navy has estimated the cost of its ship at some 
230 
million German marks.

<F P=106> [Siegmar Schelling report: "Waigel: No Additional Tax </F>
Increases in 1995"] 
  [Text] Bonn -- The Federal Government has stressed that it 
does not plan any tax increases for 1995 in addition to the 
7.5-percent solidarity surcharge that has been adopted. At the 
same time a conflict emerged on Saturday [2 April] between the 
Christian Democratic Union/Christian Social Union [CDU/CSU] and 
the Free Democratic Party of Germany [FDP] over the possibility 
of tax reductions as of 1996. 
  Referring to accusations by the Social Democratic Party of 
Germany [SPD] that the Federal Government is considering tax 
increases as of 1995, Finance Minister Theo Waigel (CSU) told 
WELT AM SONNTAG: "The tax increases that the citizens will be 
facing in 1995, including the 7.5-percent solidarity surcharge, 
have been stipulated by law." 
  At about 44 percent of the national product, the burden of 
taxes and fees will "reach a climax" in 1995. Efforts must be 
made to "reduce this burden over the medium term, so that the 
willingness for achievement and investment power are not 
weakened." The date will mainly depend on progress concerning 
the consolidation of the budget. 
  Waigel warned the coalition partner FDP: "However, those who 
believe that taxes can be reduced as early as in 1996 are 
throwing dust in people's eyes." "There will not be anything to 
distribute in 1996 either." The consolidation task will not be 
completed by then. 
  Last week Economics Minister Guenter Rexrodt (FDP) announced 
a reduction of the top tax rates as of 1996. To promote the 
economy, the top rates of the income and corporate tax are to be 
cut to below 45 percent in a three-stage reform. 
  The CSU chairman sharply criticized the SPD's tax plans. The 
plan, announced by SPD Chairman Rudolf Scharping, to introduce a 
10-percent unification surcharge for singles earning up to 
50,000 German marks [DM] and for couples earning up to DM100,000 
is "not thought out at all." The unification surcharge that 
Scharping wants to levy for an unlimited period does not ensure 
a "fair distribution of burdens." 
  Already at this point, the existing tax progression 
represents a larger burden for the high-income earners. Thus, 
one-fourth of all taxpayers "carries over 70 percent of the tax 
burden at an available income of approximately 51 percent." A 
single person with a gross salary of DM6,000 per month, for 
example, would have to pay a solidarity surcharge that is twice 
as high as that of a person earning DM4,000 per month as of 1995. 
  Waigel accused the SPD of a "loss of memory." When the 
solidarity pact was adopted in the spring of 1993, it agreed to 
the introduction of the solidarity surcharge, but now it is 
trying to confuse people with its tax proposals. It remains to 
be seen what the SPD wants to adopt as the "tolerable tax 
limit." If it realizes the current plans, "DM6-7.5 billion are 
still missing in the budget." 
  "The SPD is cheating people if it promises them a relief as 
a 
result of the unification surcharge," Waigel stressed. With its 
plans, it is increasing the state's indebtedness, for which "all 
must pay." The SPD continues to be Germany's debt party. 
  Moreover, it is not certain whether Scharping "will be able 
to control the contradictory tax forces within his party." 
Waigel pointed out that, as recently as this week, leading 
officials of the SPD's left wing called for a "gradual and 
predictable increase" in gasoline prices over the next 15 years. 
SPD official Horst Peter demanded an increase in the gasoline 
tax by 30 pfennig per year per liter. 
  Waigel categorically rejected SPD plans for spot checks of 
bank accounts to control interest taxation: "Spot checks would 
undermine the banker's discretion." Capital is "as shy as 
deer." The SPD statements about controls are "increasing the 
flight of capital and endangering investments and jobs in 
Germany." 
  The CSU chairman demanded that capital must be able to "move 
freely in Europe and the world." However, there should not be a 
distortion of competition among the financial markets. Thus, 
Bonn will intensively use its presidency in the European Union 
as of 1 July "to ensure the harmonization of interest taxation 
not only in Europe but also within the OECD." 
  Referring to the ruling by the Constitutional Court, 
according to which the tax exemption of the subsistence minimum 
must be stipulated in the tax law by 1 January 1996, Waigel did 
not rule out that this ruling "may only be realized in several 
stages." This is no violation of the Karlsruhe verdict. Waigel 
mentioned the income tax committee that he established and which 
is to present its proposals on this issue. By the way, the "tax 
exemption of the subsistence minimum is ensured even at this 
point." The SPD financial spokesman Joachim Poss called on the 
Federal Government to "immediately present its plans concerning 
the Karlsruhe ruling." 
  Waigel stressed that, even in the election year 1994, the 
draft of the 1995 budget "will be presented to the cabinet at 
the beginning of July, as usual." Thus, the voters will know as 
early as in the summer what the government's budget plans are. 
The consolidation of the budget "will be continued with the 
same force. There will be no election baits." 
  According to FDP Secretary General Werner Hoyer, the SPD's 
chances for the Bundestag elections have "dramatically declined" 
after the most recent quarrel about the SPD's government 
program. SPD Chairman Rudolf Scharping "has made an enormous 
blunder" with his proposal for the unification surcharge, Hoyer 
told the news agency DDP. This also applies to the inheritance 
and property tax, which the SPD wants to increase. Thus, the 
SPD has lost its credibility as a party of the economy. 
  Hoyer described the SPD tax program as a "catalogue of 
horrors" -- particularly because there seems to be no readiness 
"to improve the state finances through spending cuts."

<F P=106> [Unattributed report: "Again More Working Short Hours at </F>
Mercedes-Benz"] 
  [Text] Stuttgart -- In order to ease the pressure caused 
by excessive personnel, Mercedes-Benz AG, Stuttgart, wants to 
use the instrument of working short hours more intensively again. 
  This was stated by Heiner Tropitzsch, the company's 
personnel 
chief, in an interview with STUTTGARTER NACHRICHTEN. Tropitzsch 
justified the change of course toward working short hours 
instead of reducing work time by referring to the new framework 
wage contract concluded in March. In this contract it was 
agreed that wages and salaries may be reduced in line with work 
time only if this applies to the entire company. 
  As a result, special work-time regulations for the 
individual 
factories have become very expensive compared with working short 
hours, Tropitzsch said. The industrial vehicle sector of the 
Stuttgart company is suffering very much, while business with 
passenger cars is improving.

<F P=106> [Commentary by Viola Herms Drath: "Problems of Calculation"] </F>
  [Text] Washington's foreign policy experts still disagree 
on whether President Bill Clinton's balancing act in his policy 
toward China and Korea, Bosnia, Haiti, the CIS, and the Middle 
East -- to name just a few crisis spots -- is more a result of 
promises made during the election campaign or of weak leadership 
that has become more apparent through the Whitewater scandal. 
The experts agree, however, that the Clinton Administration's 
foreign policy, which has been criticized for its zigzag course, 
does contain a pragmatic element of willingness to compromise. 
  However unsuccessful Secretary of State Warren Christopher's 
Beijing talks that made human rights the precondition for 
renewing the most-favored-nation clause may seem, there is 
little doubt that Clinton's team will find a way out of the 
dilemma. The positive signals by Secretary of Commerce Ronald 
Brown and Treasury Secretary Lloyd Bentsen indicate that Clinton 
does not want to become a prisoner of his election campaign 
promises. 
  In these calculations, the nuclear potential of North Korea, 
which is still resisting inspections, still plays an important 
role. In a Security Council debate on sanctions, China's veto 
could still bring about a decision. 
  In view of the great number of Iranian "defense attaches" 
discovered by the South Koreans in Pyongyang, nuclear 
nonproliferation remains a crucial topic for the White House. 
  The Chinese are not the only ones encouraged to take a 
tougher course by the noticeable power vacuum in Washington. 
The Russians are claiming power in Bosnia and the Middle East. 
The recent blocking of stricter sanctions against Iraq by 
China, Russia, and France has shown that Security Council 
decisions opposed to U.S. interests may face opposition as well. 
  Meanwhile, Washington is trying to get the disrupted 
Israeli-Palestinian autonomy talks going again by a number of 
security policy compromises and to keep the reins of this 
complex peace process in hand by roping in Syria's Hafiz 
al-Asad, Jordan's King Husayn, and Lebanon's president. 
  Clinton and his team concentrating on social reforms have 
had 
to learn that foreign-policy developments are hard to control. 
The fact that debates on regional conflicts, which have often 
been regarded as nuisance, are very well suited to diverting 
attention from the Whitewater scandal is something that even 
people from the depths of Arkansas have realized. 
  With "pragmatic partnership," Clinton's new defense 
secretary, William J. Perry, is trying to find a basis for 
America's Russia policy that is more acceptable to Congress 
because it is geared to security policy, not so much on reform 
assistance as it used to be. This policy might be consolidated 
by Moscow's participation in the "Partnership for Peace." 
Recently, Clinton was able to bask in the light of the Bosnian 
Croat-Muslim confederation ceremony. What is also certain, 
however, is that a U.S. President taking a pragmatic course 
makes U.S. foreign policy difficult to assess for a world that 
is waiting for someone to take the lead.

<F P=106> ["H.M." report: "On the Interest Swing"] </F>
  [Text] There is disquiet on the international financial 
markets. On Wall Street, U.S. shares have lost about 10 percent 
of their value this year; in Tokyo minicrashes alternate with 
spectacular gains; the interest rates on both sides of the 
Atlantic are leaping virtually like goats. All this reflects 
the insecurity of money managers around the globe, who are 
currently reacting a bit more sensitively than is usual in this 
branch. 
  The reason for the nervousness is the unresolved question 
whether interest trends that run counter to each other can 
persist in the United States and in Europe, especially in 
Germany. While overseas the lively economic development is able 
to bear the careful pressure on the interest brake applied by 
Reserve Board chief Alan Greenspan, the German economy still 
needs declining interest rates. The Bundesbank has made good 
progress in the short-term sphere with that; regarding medium- 
and long-term durations, however, there has been a setback. 
There the yields are almost 0.75 percentage points higher than 
the lowest level last year. 
  One thing can already be said now: There are limits to an 
opening of the interest rate gap between the United States and 
Germany. These limits are reached as soon as investors begin to 
turn their backs on the mark and turn toward the dollar, 
because, in addition to higher interest rates, they can also 
expect gains from the exchange rate. In view of the enormous 
need for capital to finance German unification over the next few 
years, the Bundesbank cannot go it alone. In this respect, it 
is very likely that not all dreams regarding interest rates will 
come true in our country.

<F P=106> [Franz Schoenhuber commentary: "Defenseless But Not </F>
Dishonorable"] 
  [Text] Not just a few of our compatriots no longer believe 
in historical justice but hope only to preserve their standard 
of living. They refuse to see that one depends on the other. A 
humiliated people, full of self-doubt, can be blackmailed and is 
defenseless against rising burdens -- no end to having to make 
up for the past. 
  However, no matter how difficult it is to say it, even those 
who live in the shadow must know: Man does not live by bread 
alone. Young people in particular accept this biblical wisdom. 
They not only want to live a decent life, they are no longer 
content with a picture of history that has been trampled into 
place by the victors' boots. They are showing increasing 
distrust for the embarrassing stammering by priests about guilt, 
the anxious interpretations of insecure teachers, the shrugs by 
fathers and grandfathers, and the politicians' deep bows to the 
zeitgeist. How much our politicians, sociologists, and 
journalists are afflicted by the ailment of national masochism 
is shown by the reaction to the question whether German 
politicians should participate in the events commemorating the 
anniversary of the successful landing of the Allied troops in 
Normandy or not? Our answer: no, no, and no again! 
  For us the successful landing in Normandy remains the 
beginning of military defeat. Should we celebrate this in view 
of the graves of the thousands and thousands of fallen German 
soldiers? To those who want to move on to the next item on the 
agenda I call out: Could your brother, your father, your 
grandfather not have been among the fallen and mutilated? 
  And the Day of Liberation? Was Germany not amputated? Was 
the brown [fascist] tyranny not smoothly replaced by the red 
[communist] one in the east of our fatherland? Did the 
insistence on unconditional surrender not pull the ground out 
from under German resistance and let doom take its course? 
  It may be that we are still defenseless against the 
controlled mechanism of humiliation, but we do not want to 
become dishonorable. Therefore, we will not cease our efforts to 
stop the march of the German lemmings to the cliffs of death. 
We owe this to our people.

  [Text] Finnish and Russian parliamentarians have begun 
their joint working seminar on the Council of Europe in the 
Eduskunta building in Helsinki. The seminar is attended by 
parliamentarians from Sweden and Britain too. They regard the 
participation of the Russian Liberal Democrat chairman Vladimir 
Zhirinovskiy as important for dialogue. Sinikka Siekkinen 
reports: 
  As most of the Russian delegation arrived at the Eduskunta 
building by coach, Zhirinovskiy came on foot from his quarters, 
thereby again attracting the greatest attention. Zhirinovskiy 
voiced the view that Russia does not want to become a member of 
the Council of Europe, but intends to set up its own council for 
East Europe. 
  [Begin Zhirinovskiy recording, in English] We organize now a 
council for East Europe -- Russia, Poland, Czechia, Slovakia, 
Serbia, Bulgaria. It's good, it's better. [end recording] 
  Zhirinovskiy also welcomed Finland as a member of the 
council 
for Eastern Europe. Zhirinovskiy also reiterated yesterday's 
statements on the Baltic countries and gave to understand that 
not even UN membership benefits Russia, if it is up to him. 
  David Atkinson, the British MP, was pleased that 
Zhirinovskiy 
attended the seminar and heard what he had to say. 
  [Begin Atkinson recording] I'm delighted he is present and 
that he will hear from my mouth my message to the seminar this 
morning. [end recording] 
  Atkinson said that he would warn Zhirinovskiy of the 
consequences of his policies, particularly if he intends to seek 
to become president of Russia. The Swedish parliamentarian 
Doris Haavik also thought it was self-evident that Zhirinovskiy 
was allowed to take part in the Helsinki conference. According 
to Haavik, isolating him would instead be dangerous, but 
appearing in democracies was very important. Haavik said 
Zhirinovskiy should not be silenced; he reveals himself best 
when allowed to speak.

  [Text] Russia's delegation to the Council of Europe does 
not wish to attach much value to the statements made by Vladimir 
Zhirinovskiy, the chairman of the Liberal Democratic Party. 
Vladimir Lukin, chairman of the foreign affairs committee of the 
Russian Duma, who heads the delegation visiting Finland, says 
that he takes Zhirinovskiy exactly as seriously as he deserves. 
Lukin, who arrived in Helsinki today, pointed out that 
Zhirinovskiy represented only a small section of the second 
chamber of the Russian parliament, i.e., the Duma. According to 
Lukin, Zhirinovskiy is behaving as if 80 percent of the 
parliamentary deputies were behind him. 
  The Finnish and Russian Council of Europe delegations began 
a 
two-day seminar in Helsinki today discussing Russia's prospects 
of becoming a member of the Council of Europe. Zhirinovskiy, 
who arrived in Finland already yesterday, thought that the 
Baltic countries still belonged to Russia. The statement is in 
sharp conflict with conditions for membership in the Council of 
Europe. David Atkinson, chairman of the committee that handles 
the Council's relations with countries outside the organization, 
sharply criticized Zhirinovskiy at the seminar that opened today.

  [Text] Under the leadership of President Martti Ahtisaari, 
the government's Foreign Affairs Committee has discussed NATO's 
Partnership for Peace [PFP] initiative. Participation in the 
PFP program would, in line with earlier plans, concentrate on 
peacekeeping activities. Finland could offer peacekeeping 
training to those countries that want to take part in the UN's 
or the CSCE's peacekeeping operations. Finland is also prepared 
to take part in cooperation in the planning of peacekeeping 
operations. 
  The government stresses once again that Finland does not 
seek 
new defense solutions from the PFP and reiterates its doctrine 
of Finland's military nonalliance and an independent defense. 
In the government's view, NATO's PFP serves the stability of 
our continent and does not create new boundary lines.

  [Text] Finland's trade with Russia has taken a clear upward 
turn. Exports to Russia doubled last year compared to the 
previous year. According to a review by the Board of Customs, 
the value of the exports was just over 6,000 million Finnish 
markkas [FMk]. Imports increased by 17 percent from 1992 and 
were worth FMk7,800 million. Last year's trade with Russia 
exceeded the trade with the Soviet Union in 1991, but still 
remained considerably smaller than in the final years of the 
eighties.

<F P=106> [Article by Anders Hellberg: "Swedish UN Men Do Not Want To </F>
Go to Bosnia"] 
  [Text] "Clearly, it is calmer than we thought here in 
Bosnia. The mass media have given a wrong picture of the 
situation," says Major Mats Backteman, commanding officer of the 
Swedish company that the politicians want to move from Macedonia 
to Bosnia. 
  Backteman has been with the Nordic battalion in Tuzla for 
two 
days, in order to find out, along with two colleagues, what the 
situation is like in Bosnia. 
  "We have gotten a positive idea of what we are to do here, 
mainly guard the airport," Backteman says. 
  But "at home" in Macedonia the Swedish company of 200 men is 
not as positive as the four who have visited Tuzla. 
  "They are still negative, but then they have not heard about 
the experiences we have had." 
  Mats Backteman himself would absolutely agree to move to 
Bosnia. 
  "I have discussed it with my wife in Linkoping, where we 
also 
have two small children. I would accept a rewriting of the 
contract." 
<H5>  Accept </H5>
  Backteman is not really able to say how many in the company 
would accept moving. 
  "I think that right now it is 50-50 in favor of moving to 
Bosnia." 
  The alternative for the Swedish unit is not to remain in 
Macedonia but to break its UN contract and go home. 
  "As I see it, there is no possibility for us to remain in 
Macedonia if we do not want to move to Bosnia," Backteman says. 
  For most the alternative is going home to unemployment. The 
company has only been in Kumanovo in Macedonia for one month. 
Five months remain of the contract. 
  "For many of the guys their period of sickness benefits has 
expired and they regard the UN service as a job. 
  ``At the same time we have not had the opportunity of 
checking with our families. In that way we have dual loyalties; 
it is a difficult situation.'' 
<H5>  Persuade </H5>
  As Mats Backteman describes the situation in Tuzla, "it is 
not much more dangerous than in Macedonia." 
  Colonel Ulf Henricsson, commander of the Nordic battalion in 
Tuzla, has tried to persuade the Swedish company in Macedonia to 
move. As Henricsson describes the contracts, they are written 
with the UN and do not refer specifically to Macedonia. 
  But Backteman points out that it says "MA 03" -- which is 
the 
Macedonian battalion -- in their contracts.

<F P=106> [Article by Hans O. Alfredsson: "Center Party Preparing for </F>
Congress on EU"] 
  [Text] In contrast to the Social Democrats, the Center 
Party is electing new delegates to the congress who will decide 
the party's stand on the national referendum on the EU [European 
Union]. EU opponents are expected to involve themselves deeply 
before the district meetings, which will pick the delegates just 
before and after Easter. 
  In the case of the Center Party, it is justified to speak of 
a special party congress. The Social Democrats' EU congress, 
which, according to plans, will take place in May or June, is 
not a special but a reconvened congress. It will be the same 
delegates as to the ordinary party congress last fall. With the 
Social Democrats the opponents do not have any opportunities to 
mobilize during the spring and try to select persons with 
similar views. 
<H5>  Can Leave the Government </H5>
  The Center Party's executive committee decided last Monday 
[14 March] that the previously scheduled extra congress would be 
held in May, about a month before the ordinary meeting. The idea 
is that the very splintered Center Party will then take a stand 
for or against membership in the EU. 
  Party leader Olof Johansson has already stated that a no 
from 
the meeting is likely to lead to the Center Party leaving the 
government. 
  Since the Center's EU meeting will be held so close to the 
ordinary meeting, the local party districts do not have time to 
hold their regional meetings and appoint new delegates to both 
the regular national congress, which is taking place in Falun, 
and the special congress, which will probably be held in 
Stockholm. This means that the EU decision will to a large 
extent be made by delegates other than those who dealt with the 
EU issue during last year's ordinary meeting in Falkenberg. 
<H5>  Want To Keep the Neutrality </H5>
  The last three ordinary Center Party congresses have stated 
that Sweden should try to become a member of the EU but on one 
very firm condition: that the neutrality policy will be kept. 
The latter means that Sweden would not participate in the 
defense cooperation in the Western European Union, WEU. 
  A long series of opinion polls have shown that the EU 
opponents are in a clear majority among the Center Party's 
members and sympathizers. According to the most recent poll by 
the Central Statistical Bureau, SCB, 58.3 percent are said to 
have voted no in November. Only 17.5 percent are said to have 
voted yes and 21.7 percent were uncertain. 
  Even immediately after the presentation of Sweden's 
agreement 
with the EU a few weeks ago, there were more opponents than 
supporters; 46 percent of the Center voters then said in a Sifo 
poll that they would vote no.

<F P=106> [Report on interview with Center Party secretary Ake </F>
Pettersson by Elisabeth Crona; place and date not given] 
  [Text] "There is every indication that the Center Party 
will say yes to the EU [European Union]. And this will be of 
great importance for the result of the referendum." 
  So said Center Party secretary Ake Pettersson on the eve of 
the party's extraordinary conference at which he intends to draw 
attention to the results of the negotiations in order to achieve 
his goal. 
  He also says yes to a common Nordic referendum day but no to 
government collaboration with the Social Democrats after the 
election. They are continuing to apply their rigid philosophy. 
  And the Social Democratic idea of letting the farmers pay 
the 
EU membership fee is tantamount to shooting themselves in the 
foot -- and gives an indication of a Social Democratic 
government's plans for new taxes on farmers and small business 
owners, Ake Pettersson said in this interview with SVENSKA 
DAGBLADET. 
  He came straight from a meeting of the Center Party's 
Farmers 
Committee that scrutinized the results from the negotiations in 
Brussels. The farmers appear content, and Ake Pettersson spoke 
of a very long-term and conscious Europe strategy on the part of 
the party leadership. 
  "From the time of the fall of the Berlin wall, we have taken 
a positive view of submitting a membership application and have 
created a democratic base for this at our party conferences. We 
set out demands to be made in the negotiations in December 1992, 
before all the other parties. We chose the ministries -- 
Environment, Agriculture, Regional Policy -- we now head with an 
eye to the EU negotiations. And in the negotiations we have won 
an acceptance of the vast majority of our demands. It is 
logical that we should follow this up with a yes. 
  ``We are now entering the most difficult phase. It is of 
vital importance that we deal with this question in such a way 
that we are still good friends after the decision reached by the 
party conference. Note well that the question will be settled 
in a referendum. We can have different ideas about whether EU 
membership is the right way to achieve the Center Party's goals, 
but we do not have differing views on the objectives of Center 
Party policy. 
  ``I am very well aware that there are risks for the Center 
Party -- in the form of a split, downright enmity, or the 
possibility that people will have no desire to involve 
themselves in politics for the sake of the party.'' 
  Ake Pettersson is upset by the media criticism of the Center 
Party's approach to the EU: 
  "We ought instead to enjoy respect for our lengthy 
democratic 
process," he said, making a comparison with the Social 
Democrats' way of dealing with the issue: 
  "They do not as yet even have a single party conference 
decision to seek membership. They are adjourned. And once the 
negotiations are completed they will tackle everything at once." 
  [Crona] Mona Sahlin's remark -- which has been backed by 
Goran Persson -- to the effect that the farmers should be 
responsible for the EU membership fee runs the risk of pushing 
farmers and small businessmen away from voting yes in the 
referendum. Surely this cannot have been the Social Democrats' 
intention? 
  "The reality is also that we are discussing Swedish 
membership in the context of making our contribution to peace 
and achieving more rapid economic development. A 1-percent 
increase in GNP will add a further 14 billion per year to the 
economy. If half this sum is in the private sector, we will 
almost have found the finance for the 9 billion we expect to be 
the net cost of membership." 
  Ake Pettersson rejects following the successful no road of 
the Norwegian Center Party as a shortsighted tactic on so 
important a future issue. But he takes the view that conditions 
in Sweden are different from those in Norway and Finland. 
  "Norway has a strong factor in its economy -- its oil and 
gas 
resources. The rest of its industry and commerce is not so 
dependent on Europe as Sweden's is, with our emphasis on 
engineering and forestry products. And in our working life we 
live much closer to companies in other countries because of 
Sweden's incredibly comprehensive foreign trade. 
  ``In Finland's case there is also the dissolution of the 
traditional relations between Finland and Russia. It is natural 
for many Finns to want to confirm this dissolution with 
membership in the EU.'' 
  It was not the Norwegian Storting but the Swedish Center 
Party that first proposed a common Nordic referendum day. 
  "Over the past year this has not been a realistic idea, but 
it has become so again. A shared voting day would be a positive 
signal of the Nordic identity." 
  This is necessary, said Ake Pettersson, who listened to the 
Nordic Council's recent EU debate with some disappointment. It 
is not certain that Nordic cooperation will grow within the EU 
-- and it certainly will not do so automatically. 
  "There is a risk that the positions of the Nordic countries 
will diverge, in part because they are in tough competition in 
certain areas, as Sweden and Finland are in the field of 
forestry products, and Sweden and Denmark in the field of 
agricultural produce." 
  The SVENSKA DAGBLADET/Institute for Market Research poll 
into 
the Center Party's potential voters is in line with those the 
Center Party itself carries out. 
  "They are about one-third of the electorate, and many of 
them 
are on the left. 
  ``This shows that the Center Party plays an important role 
for where government power lies in Sweden. Another conclusion 
is that the Center Party's current and potential voters feel 
strongly in favor of a fair policy on the distribution of 
income.'' 
  Ake Pettersson says he understands why the Social Democrats 
keep repeating that they want to form a government with one of 
the parties of the Center: 
  "They promise a lot -- tearing things up and tearing things 
down. They would like the support of one or more nonsocialist 
parties in order to be able -- if they get into government -- to 
justify why they are forced to abandon their election promises. 
Today they are pursuing an irresponsible economic policy -- one 
with very serious consequences for Sweden's future development 
-- that they probably do not even believe in themselves. 
  ``But they hope that it will be viable in the election 
campaign. That is why they would like a partner in government on 
which they can later blame the difficult economic decisions.'' 
  [Crona] But you do not want this? 
  "No, we are extremely critical of the Social Democrats 
because the party still lives in the midst of the centralist 
thinking that is at odds with the whole pattern of developments 
today. Reading Anders Sundstrom's remarks (in DAGENS INDUSTRI 
recently) was like hearing a speech by Krister Wickman at the 
1968 party conference. 
  ``At present there are so many things in developments that 
agree with the Center Party's values. Technological 
developments favor small-scaleness, quality, economy with 
resources. Sophisticated industrial activities in small 
business form can be engaged in far from their markets. This 
means that we are getting a new pattern of localization. Take 
NK [Nordiska Kompaniet -- major Stockholm department store]! 
You see the same building on the outside, but inside you meet 
120 small businesses that are very successful. You notice when 
you travel by the Silja Line that all services comes from Kalix. 
Order a taxi in Stockholm and the reply comes from women on 
Ingmarso in the archipelago. SJ [Sweden's state railroad 
company] has its service center in Sveg. 
  ``There are factors other than closeness to the market that 
have begun to play a decisive role: access to good training, 
good communications, a clean environment, freedom from violence 
and crime. This is something we can read from the statistics 
today -- in Sweden, Europe, the United States, Japan. 
  ``In Sweden this means that the rural population is 
increasing. It has not done so for 100 years. That is why it 
is important that the country has a political leadership that 
does not steer Sweden in the opposite direction, that does not 
try to rule Sweden with a rigid philosophy and centralism, with 
Oresund bridges and Dennis packages. 
  ``Anders Sundstrom, who is being portrayed as the next 
(Social Democratic) industry minister, talks about creating a 
centrally controlled committee for industrial development in 
Sweden and about developing plans for each branch of industry to 
organize industry from above -- a traditionalist and rigid 
philosophy.'' 
  According to Ake Pettersson, technological developments also 
make it easier for the Center Party to advocate EU membership 
today: 
  "The fears that existed and that were justified in the late 
sixties and early seventies are being eliminated largely as a 
result of the high-speed, economical, and small-scale technology 
that is being developed. Today I am much less worried that 
European cooperation will lead to things being concentrated in 
certain locations. 
  ``Closeness to the market is no longer so important. That is 
why we have the same -- or better -- potential to engage in 
industrial activities in Sweden as people in the environmentally 
damaged regions on the European continent.''

<F P=106> [Article by Mats Knutson: "Industry in Harsh Attack Against </F>
SDP"] 
  [Text] The Industry Association is attacking the Social 
Democratic Party's [SDP] economic program. In so doing, the 
organization is violating its principle of lying low in election 
movements. 
  In a so far unknown letter to Social Democratic Party leader 
Ingvar Carlsson, the chairman of the association Bo Rydin writes 
that the Social Democrats' policy jeopardizes economic recovery 
in Sweden and risks leading to higher interest rates, reduced 
investment, and undermined confidence in the budget policy. 
  "Rydin's violent attack shows that the Industry Association 
apparently is turning more and more into a propaganda organ. I 
see a connection between the campaign by the Taxpayers' 
Association and the attack by the Industry Association," replies 
Ingvar Carlsson through his press secretary Gisela Lindstrand. 
  Bo Rydin is one of the absolute top people in Swedish 
business and industry. Among other things, he is chairman of the 
board of SCA [Swedish Cellulose Company] and Industrivarden. In 
the letter to Ingvar Carlsson he criticizes point by point the 
proposals that the Social Democrats presented in their shadow 
budget earlier this year. 
<H5>  Good Relations </H5>
  With that Bo Rydin and the Industry Association are heading 
into the beginning election campaign. 
  "We are worried about the Social Democratic proposals. This 
has nothing to do with party policy but about wanting to protect 
Swedish industry," says Bo Rydin. 
  In the letter to Ingvar Carlsson, he voices harsh criticism 
of the Social Democratic proposals for raised income taxes, 
raised taxation of capital, retaining personal property taxes, 
and reintroducing double taxation for business profits. 
  He also strongly questions whether the Social Democrats' 
proposal to introduce direct write-offs for machinery 
investments will have any major effects. 
  "Normally, we lie low when it is an election year, since we 
are careful to maintain good relations with both the government 
and opposition," says Bo Rydin. 
  "But this year we will abandon our principle of being quiet, 
although this could be perceived as going against the Social 
Democrats. We believe that these are such important issues that 
we must act." 
<H5>  Has Not Received an Answer </H5>
  The letter to Ingvar Carlsson is dated 24 February this 
year. 
Bo Rydin has not yet received an answer. Magnus Lemmel, the 
managing director of the Industry Association, recently launched 
an attack on the Social Democrats in a "Focal Point" article, 
and the fact that Bo Rydin's letter has now been made public is 
extremely irritating to Ingvar Carlsson. 
  "The Social Democrats were praised by the Industry 
Association when we pushed through the tax reform. Now that we 
are sticking with the reform, it is apparently not worth 
anything," he says. 
  "I am prepared to take up a factual discussion with the 
Industry Association both publicly and as an answer to Rydin." 
<H5>  Greater Uncertainty </H5>
  In his letter to Ingvar Carlsson, Bo Rydin writes that the 
Social Democratic proposals would shortsightedly lead to a 
further budget weakening "conservatively calculated at 10-15 
billion kronor." This means greater uncertainty regarding 
Sweden's capability of improving state finances and risks 
leading to "renewed financial concern," in Rydin's opinion. He 
writes: "The interest rate increases that could be the result 
further exacerbate the government's financial situation and risk 
throttling the recovery that has now begun." 
<H5>  Undermines Confidence </H5>
  Bo Rydin argues that "in a situation where an upturn in the 
Swedish economy has been initiated, the additional incentives 
that are proposed are highly dubious from a purely economic 
aspect as well as from the aspect of confidence. A further 
underbalancing of the budget also undermines confidence in the 
long-range budget policy." 
  The anticipated growth effects in the Social Democratic 
shadow budget are also too optimistic, says Bo Rydin. "A 
10-billion-kronor larger budget deficit is expected to raise 
domestic demand by not quite 40 billion kronor for the 1994/95 
fiscal year, that is to say a multiplier of four, which is not 
realistic," he writes. 
  The calculated increase in employment by 90,000 people in 
the 
Social Democratic proposal is primarily accounted for by 
postponed layoffs in the municipal sector and incentives for 
construction, Rydin says. 
  "In no case is it a matter of long-range, stable jobs, but 
it 
merely involves postponing a necessary adjustment," he writes.

  [Text] Ankara, April 5 (A.A.) -- Albanian President Sali 
Berisha called on Turkish businessmen to invest in his country, 
on Tuesday [5 April]. In a press conference in the capital 
city, Berisha, on an official visit, said that his country had 
tourism potential, mining, and cheap manpower. He said that 
the objective of his visit was to further the existing friendly 
relations and political, economic, technical, cultural and 
military cooperation between the two countries. 
  He added that improvement of the two countries' relations 
was 
a result of the existence of common values between Turkey and 
Albania. He stressed that Turkey and Albania shared the same 
views on regional and international issues. 
  Berisha said his country welcomed the presence of Turkish 
soldiers in Bosnia. 
  "Turkish soldiers are going to Bosnia for peace and will 
spend efforts to contribute to peace," Berisha said. 
  Recalling that Albania was the only country near Bosnia, 
which availed to NATO its sea and airports, he said that 
cooperation between Turkey and Albania was vital for the region. 
  Berisha said that Albania was facing great economic 
difficulties and that the government has been implementing 
reforms for two years, to improve the situation. 
  By virtue of the political, economic, institutional, and 
legal reforms implemented, inflation in Albania fell from 400 
percent to 30 percent and production rose by 10 percent, the 
highest rate in Europe. 
  Berisha added that during their talk, President Suleyman 
Demirel and Prime Minister Tansu Ciller assured him that they 
will encourage Turkish entrepreneurs to invest in Albania. "Our 
country has extraordinary facilities for investments," he said. 
"We have great natural resources, a tourism potential, and cheap 
labor, as well as an encouraging legislation." 
  During his talk with Ciller, Berisha asked for low-interest 
loans from Turkey, to be used in importing goods from Turkey. 
Berisha stressed that Albania wanted to have friendly relations 
with its neighbors, but its people were against any change of 
borders, by the use of force. 
  On the Kosovo issue, Berisha said that the UN embargo 
imposed 
on Serbs should not be lifted unless the Kosovo problem is 
resolved. 
  Berisha said that his country wanted to join the North 
Atlantic Treaty Organization and supported the concept of 
Partnership for Peace.

<F P=106> [Article by Semih D. Idiz] </F>
  [Text] Public attention in Turkey may be focused elsewhere 
at the present time. But there are mounting signs of increasing 
cooperation between Turkey and Iran, especially, but not 
exclusively, in the security field which is an area of mutual 
concern for the two countries given the overall developments in 
the region that the two countries find themselves in. Ankara 
has at the same time been monitoring the gradually worsening 
economic situation in Iran. It has taken particular note of the 
fact that these difficulties have prompted this country's 
relatively liberal and certainly pragmatic President 
Hashemi-Rafsanjani in recent days to call on expatriate and 
particularly qualified Iranians around the world who have exiled 
themselves from their country. 
  In a development that was unique as far as this country is 
concerned, Rafsanjani called on these expatriates to return home 
and contribute to the welfare of Iran. 
  A high-level official in Ankara told TURKISH PROBE earlier 
this week that Ankara had no interest in exploiting these 
difficulties of Iran or seeing others exploit them. Quite to 
the contrary, he said it has always been the case that Turkey 
wants good political and economic ties with a stable Iran 
because it is important for key countries in the region like 
themselves to have a say in matters and developments pertaining 
to the region. 
  "Turkey and Iran are two important countries in this part of 
the world that have parallel interests in many cases. This 
makes it necessary that they consult constantly and cooperate 
closely on a host of issues which they have a much closer 
insight into than countries from outside the region and from 
other parts of the world," this official said. 
  One delicate subject that has required continued close 
consultation and cooperation between the two countries is, of 
course, that of Iraq. 
  This subject is made even more delicate since Turkey is 
firmly within the Western camp in terms of many, if not all, of 
the factors concerning Iraq. Iran, with its deep antipathy for 
the West that it suspects so much is, of course, in a radically 
different category in this case. 
  But both Turkey and Iran have nevertheless found common 
ground on one issue and have spelled out their views on this in 
clear terms. 
  What they do not want to see is an independent Kurdistan in 
northern Iraq, where the political vacuum is still continuing, 
and where there is a semblance of stability only because of 
Western involvement in the region. 
  But the West's overzealous involvement -- which Turkey is 
ironically but not illogically also a part of -- is also the 
cause of concern in both Ankara and Tehran that key countries in 
the West may be secretly planning to establish just such an 
independent Kurdistan. 
  It was this fear that prompted Turkey and Iraq, together 
with 
Syria, to set up a tripartite consultative mechanism on northern 
Iraq at the level of foreign ministers in November 1992. All 
three countries have restive Kurdish minorities and are aware 
that developments in northern Iraq have close bearing on their 
vital interests given that there is always the possibility that 
these developments may spill over to their territory. 
  In Turkey's case, of course, this fear has been amply 
justified given the developments in Southeastern Anatolia. 
Through this tripartite mechanism -- which was last activated 
in early February this year -- Turkey, Iran and Syria wanted to 
signal that they had a say in regional matters and that they 
would ensure that their influence was felt when it came to these 
matters. 
  What they have been saying at the end of every meeting of 
the 
tripartite mechanism is, in effect, that no Kurdistan that is 
sandwiched between these three countries can hope to survive 
without endorsement from Ankara, Tehran and Damascus. But such 
tripartite cooperation between these countries also requires 
that bilateral cooperation is also enhanced among themselves if 
the three-way consultative mechanism they have set up is to 
really have any meaning and effect ultimately. This bilateral 
cooperation, however, is what has been elusive more often than 
not, especially in terms of Turkey's separate ties with Iran and 
Syria. 
  This is also why some recent developments in ties with Iran 
that have not received much publicity are of importance for 
their broader implications. 
  Until very recently there was a widespread belief in Turkish 
public opinion that Iran was one of the countries sponsoring the 
Kurdistan Workers' Party (PKK), which is outlawed in Turkey 
where it has been waging a bloody separatist war. 
  The belief was that with the latent tensions between the two 
countries because of their diametrically opposed systems -- 
Turkey being a secular parliamentary democracy and Iran being 
run by the Islamic Shariah law -- Tehran was using this as a 
card against Ankara. 
  This belief has not completely disappeared as yet and crops 
up every now and again and is probably only dormant because the 
public's focus in Turkey is elsewhere at the moment. But an 
editorial in January in the English language TEHRAN TIMES -- 
which is known for its closeness to President Rafsanjani whose 
administration's views it is believed to express -- had given a 
clear intimation as to how Iran was beginning to see this whole 
Kurdish matter and particularly its place in it ties with Turkey. 
  The editorial had suggested that the time had come for 
Turkey 
and Iran to combine their efforts to find a peaceful solution to 
their increasingly difficult problems with Kurdish minorities 
"Regional countries (should) set aside their differences and 
work out a practical peaceful solution to this common problem," 
it had said, adding that regional countries "should stop using 
the Kurdish card" against each other. 
  It was significant that the TEHRAN TIMES editorial had come 
just prior to the February meeting on northern Iraq of the 
foreign ministers of Turkey, Iran and Iraq in Istanbul. It was 
also noteworthy at this time that neither of the sides allowed 
the death of nearly 20 Iranian villagers in February by stray 
cluster bombs from Turkish F-16 jets in a cross-border raid on 
the PKK's Zhalah camp in northern Iraq near the Iranian border 
to sully the positive atmosphere that was developing at that 
moment. 
  Although initially angry at this development which led the 
Iranian press to lash out at Turkey, Tehran nevertheless 
conceded it had been a mistake, and Ankara for its part had 
agreed to provide compensation to the villagers' bereaved 
families. The matter was subsequently considered closed by both 
sides. 
  The latest development in this ongoing positive climate that 
has been growing between the two countries was the returning by 
Iran to Turkey of PKK militants who had strayed to its territory 
following operations by the Turkish security forces in the Agri 
and Igdir regions. 
  No precise date has been given by official sources in Turkey 
as to when this development had taken place; but the 
announcement earlier this week that a letter had been sent by 
Turkish Minister for Interior Nahit Mentese to his Iranian 
counterpart Mohammad Besharati thanking him for this development 
indicates that the returning of the PKK militants took place 
very recently. 
  Using noticeably sugary language, Mentese said that the 
returning of some members of the PKK to Turkey was "the 
expression of not just the cooperation on the question of 
security but also of the brotherly ties between the governments 
of the two countries." 
  Expressing optimism that this positive development was just 
a 
harbinger of the further enhanced cooperation of the two 
countries on the security issue, Mentese ended his letter by 
thanking Mohammad Besharati for his personal contribution to 
this positive outcome and indicating his desire to see him in 
Turkey in the shortest possible time. 
  Mehmet Agar, the Turkish chief of security, was reported as 
also having sent a letter to his Iranian counterpart prior to 
Mentese's letter to Besharati, expressing similar views and 
hopes for enhanced cooperation between the two countries in the 
security field. 
  All of this appeared a concrete example of the new mood 
prevailing in Tehran that first started to reveal itself in late 
December 1993 when the Iranian Deputy President Hasan Habibi 
visited Ankara following a period of tension between the two 
countries over the PKK issue. 
  It was also a far cry from what relations in the security 
cooperation area were just over a year ago when the then 
Minister for Interior Ismet Sezgin was accusing Tehran in so 
many words of supporting such Islamic terrorism in Turkey as the 
killing of Ugur Mumcu, a prominent investigative journalist and 
staunch upholder of Kemalism and in particular its principle of 
secularism. 
  Iran, of course, had denied the charges levelled at it on 
this score, and the truth of the matter is that Ankara could 
come up with nothing that would stand up in court to 
substantiate its charges. 
  The negative climate that had attended these developments 
had, however, prevailed for the better part of 1993 and had 
adversely affected relations between the two countries. 
  The clouding of relations had happened at the very moment 
that the two countries needed strategic cooperation to help 
stabilize regional flash points, not just in Iraq, but also in 
the Caucasus, another part of the region where the two capitals 
have close interests and are watching the Armenian-Azeri 
conflict and the Russian position in this closely. 
  Thus a breakthrough in the security field, such as the 
reported return of PKK members, portends well as far as the 
prospects of laying the groundwork for a more realpolitik 
approach by both Ankara and Tehran to each other. 
  Officials in Ankara are adamant that Ankara always extended 
a 
warm hand to Iran but was hampered in the past because of what 
was considered by the Turkish public as tampering with Turkey's 
secularism and territorial integrity by Tehran. 
  If there is now to be more genuine cooperation in the 
security field it is inevitable that this should lay the 
infrastructure for enhancement of overall relations between the 
two countries in other fields.

<F P=106> [Statement by Prime Minister Tansu Ciller at a news </F>
conference to announce the government's new economic package in 
Ankara -- live] 
  [Text] Dear listeners, guests, honorable members of our 
press and television: I greet you all respectfully. 
  We are here before you with Mr. Karayalcin, leader of our 
coalition partner, the Social Democratic Populist Party [SDPP], 
and deputy prime minister, to announce a series of important 
decisions we have made. 
  For a long time now, we have noticed that the economic 
problems in our country are growing. The prosperity of the 
Turkish people is what is important. What is important is not 
only the immediate prosperity of all the people in this country 
-- the workers, civil servants, farmers, the big masses, and the 
shopkeepers -- but their prosperity in the coming months and 
years as well. We found that this prosperity was being 
mortgaged. Consequently, very difficult and daring decisions 
were needed to take measures that would increase this 
prosperity. We could have allowed the heap of economic problems 
to grow or we could have set aside certain political interests 
and be guided by the country's interests in making a series of 
decisions together. We opted for the second alternative. 
Together, we made a series of decisions that not even one-party 
governments dared make. Together, we are determined to overcome 
the problems facing the country, to bring prosperity to the 
Turkish people, and to clear the way for them in the best 
possible manner. 
  I would like to approach the issue in the following way: 
First, to state what these economic problems are, and then to 
point out what would have happened had we not reached these 
decisions, what the decisions are, and what we can expect from 
these decisions. 
  Let me state clearly that the most important problem facing 
the country is the growing public deficit. I think that there 
is a consensus on this point in all sectors of our society. Let 
us look at the important factors that caused the growth of the 
deficit and at certain data. 
  It can be observed that since 1985, a growing share of the 
revenues -- today, it is more than all the revenues put together 
-- goes toward paying debts, in the form of the debt itself and 
interest. This share used to be half of all tax revenues. 
Every year, the share grew at a higher rate than the previous 
year, and has reached the current level of 104 percent. In 
other words, even if you take all the tax revenues, you cannot 
pay all the debts and interest today. The interest we pay alone 
is close to 50 percent of our tax revenues. What is left of the 
tax revenues is also not enough to pay the civil servants and 
workers. 
  Naturally, such a big public debt means that new loans must 
be taken to pay the interest on the old loans. This process has 
been going on in Turkey for quite some time. 
  Another development that contributed to this process was the 
fact that the foreign exchange rate was kept at very low levels 
after 1987. Interest rates naturally rise under conditions in 
which there is such a public deficit if the foreign exchange 
rate is to be kept low. When interest rates are high, public 
deficits grow in a vicious circle. That is what indeed 
happened. After 1988, the growing public deficit contributed to 
creating a higher interest rate on the one hand, while the 
foreign exchange rate, which was being kept unnecessarily low, 
created another short-term capital transfer on the other. 
  These vicious circles which fed on each other caused the 
country to become trapped in a clamp of interest and debts. They 
prevented investments and the creation of jobs and also caused a 
mounting inflation rate. 
  Given the fact that the increasing public deficit is at the 
core of the problem, I want to briefly talk about what would 
have happened had we not taken these measures. Had we not taken 
these measures, we would have had to live through the Latin 
American example. The inflation rate would have exceeded 100 
percent and might have eventually reached 2,000-3,000 percent, 
as in Latin America. Furthermore, the growth rate would first 
have dropped and then have fallen to negative levels. In other 
words, we would have been headed toward a narrowing economy. 
Under such conditions, unemployment rates would have grown very 
fast and would have been impossible to stop. Unemployment would 
have grown not only in the short term but would have continued 
to mount. The government would have been unable to pay civil 
servants and workers. All these considerations made it 
essential to take these measures. Indeed, the radical and brave 
measures we have taken can stop all these things from happening. 
Let me briefly discuss their essence. 
  The measures can be grouped into two. The first involves 
stability. The second involves measures that will lead to 
structural changes. 
  What is important for stability is to reduce the public 
deficit. We will show the public how we will reduce the public 
deficit by means of three-month balances and budget figures. In 
the first stage, we plan to save 38.3 trillion Turkish lira [TL] 
[approximately $1.4 billion]. In other words, we aim at 
reducing the TL47.6 trillion deficit to TL9 trillion during the 
first three months. We will stand behind these figures. These 
are the figures that should be examined when our government 
policies are assessed. We thought it would be appropriate to 
announce the figures publicly. These figures will be announced 
at the end of every three-month period, so that we can assess 
the figures together before the public. This is as much a 
requisite of openness as it is a requisite of credibility and 
trust. If we cannot hit the target and reach these figures, 
then we will look for the reasons together and tackle the issue 
together again. 
  We have determined how to tackle the different elements of 
the deficit in order to reduce it: The revenues will be 
increased by TL16.3 trillion, while expenditures will be reduced 
by TL22 trillion. 
  Along with that, we had to introduce a price and salary 
policy. In the first stage, we have had to make price 
readjustments. I want to declare here and now that after these 
price readjustments, there will be no further readjustments for 
six months in some cases, until the end of the year in others, 
except for reasons stemming from conditions outside Turkey. 
  We are aware that increased salaries play an important role 
in this vicious circle -- that is, in increasing the public 
debt. We are determined to increase salaries as much as 
possible within the budget expenditures. 
  The complementary third leg of the trivet had to involve 
the Central Bank. In the coming days, the Central Bank will 
announce its monetary program in connection with the budget and 
financing deficit for the next three-month period. However, 
more important than that, two laws concerning the Central Bank 
were submitted to the Turkish Grand National Assembly today. 
They involve granting autonomy to the Central Bank and 
reducing, gradually every year, the current 15 percent share of 
the budget expenditures which go toward short-term advance 
payments. 
  Other than that, besides the monetary program and the 
measures to be taken by the Central Bank, the Capital Market 
Council will issue a statement tomorrow restricting certain 
procedures. 
  Meanwhile, I think it is necessary to clearly state the 
following: We considered it necessary to tackle the issue of 
the just distribution of the burden while the stability program 
is being implemented; that is, while taking measures to restrict 
the budget deficit and financing needs, while being very careful 
about raising salaries and readjusting prices -- the second leg 
of the trivet -- and while, in turn, the Central Bank declares 
its laws and statements. I want to say that all these measures 
will be implemented within the following framework: Everything 
will be carried out in line with the market economy. No foreign 
exchange accounts will be confiscated. Exchange bureaus will 
not be closed. An internal debt consolidation will not be made. 
In other words, all the rules of the market economy will 
continue to function. 
  Nor are we compromising the big projects of our country. 
That is, the projects that are under way within the framework 
of the build-operate-transfer principle, and the projects that 
are to be financed by foreign capital such as the State Water 
Works' Urfa tunnel, Deriner Dam, and Kralkizi Dam, will all 
continue. In other words, we will not make any reductions in 
the country's technological development, in its important 
investments, or in foreign investments. 
  Within this framework, the market economy will work on the 
one hand, and the big investments from foreign sources, mainly 
energy, will continue. 
  We have tried to make everyone share the burden equally. 
Accordingly, if you look at page 17, there will be a one-time 
tax. This additional tax will be collected from those who pay 
income and corporation tax and will be levied on the assets they 
declare in 1994. Salaried workers will be exempt from this tax. 
An additional low one-time tax will be collected on net income 
or assets. An additional one-time tax will be levied on 
motorized vehicles for the ground, sea, and air that exceed a 
certain insurance value. Those who own more than one residence 
will pay an additional low one-time tax. 
  These are measures necessary for justice and for the just 
distribution of the burden. 
  The stability dimension of the measures is reflected in the 
narrowing of the public deficit, in our price and salary policy, 
and in the measures the Central Bank will take such as autonomy 
and the exchange regime. 
  However, the third leg of this trivet involves structural 
reorganization, a restructuring. In restructing, we will speed 
up the privatization of public economic enterprises. In a way, 
the public sector will be consolidated and made to function more 
efficiently and productively. Every measure will be taken to 
ensure this. Our law for privatization was submitted to the 
assembly today. 
  Privatization will be carried out at great speed. We believe 
that we can reach a target of $3.5 billion in privatization by 
the end of the year. If you consider that during the past 10 
years, less that $0.5 billion, some $300 million, was received 
in privatization, you will see how large our target is. [figures 
in dollars as heard] Within this framework, by the end of 1994, 
the following will be fully or partly privatized: Erdemir 
TUPRAS, the Petrochemical Holding Company [PETKIM], Turkish 
Airlines, TURBAN, HAVAS, the Maritime Transportation Company, 
and DITAS. 
  Furthermore, the Turkish Electricity Authority and the Post, 
Telephone, and Telegraph Administration [PTT] will be privatized 
in 1995. The preliminary preparations for that will be 
completed in 1994. The PTT license for cellular phones and 
cable television will also be sold. 
  The social security institutions will be reformed. We are 
working on that with great speed. Within this framework, 
private health insurance and private pension funds will be 
encouraged. 
  We all know that the public economic enterprises stopped 
being productive and incurred great losses a long time ago. We 
will try to make the public economic enterprises fruitful. We 
will give this first priority. The work regarding this issue 
will be conducted by the concerned ministry and the concerned 
institutions at great speed. 
  We will speed up the sale of the fixed assets, rest homes, 
hotels, and lodgings of the public economic enterprises. We 
will review the fixed assets of the state pension fund. Hotels 
belonging to the fund will be rented or sold. 
  We will close down installations that are impossible to sell 
due to large debts, overemployment, high-cost production, or 
technological backwardness. Their capital assets will be sold. 
Accordingly, we have decided to close down seven factories 
belonging to Sumer Holding Company, the PETKIM installation in 
Yarimca, the PETLAS corporation, five hotels being run by TURBA, 
the Turkish Electronic Production and Marketing Corporation 
installation in Aydin, the Halic, Camialti,and Alaybey 
dockyards, and some combines of the Meat and Fish Corporation. 
The decision will be implemented within a certain period of 
time, given the orders placed with the installations and the 
time needed to liquidate their stocks. 
  Furthermore, unless it can be privatized by the end of the 
year, the Turkish Agricultural Equipment Corporation will be 
closed down. The State Material Office will be liquidated. The 
State Monopolies' Ankara and Bomonti beer factories, and the 
Cibali cigarette factory will be closed down until the end of 
the year. 
  The workers laid off during privatization will be 
compensated. 
  We are aware that the Karabuk Iron and Steel Works has had 
problems for quite some time. The Iron and Steel Works, which 
made great contributions to the development of Karabuk District, 
has fulfilled its mission, completed its economic and 
technological life, and can no longer compete due to outdated 
technology. We expect the installations's losses in 1994 to be 
around TL5 trillion. With interest, this places a burden much 
higher than TL10 trillion on the public. 
  Unless it is privatized, production at the Karabuk Iron and 
Steel Works will stop at the end of the year. The necessary 
preparations will be made. 
  The workers, if they want, can take over the installations 
until the end of the year. All legal rights of and compensation 
for personnel -- the retired or those whose service has ended -- 
will be met in time. In addition, the workers will benefit from 
the unemployment indemnities within the framework of the 
privatization power law. 
  The limitations and improvements necessary to increase 
production in the Turkish Stone Quarry Organization will be 
perpetuated. Within this framework, if no requests are submitted 
from the private sector, certain mines will be closed by the end 
of the year. The works of the miners in the active mines will 
be guaranteed. The legal rights of the miners whose services 
will no longer be needed will be taken care of and they will 
receive due compensation in time. In addition, they will 
benefit from loss of employment indemnities as stipulated in the 
privatization law. Maintenance work will be done in the coal 
mines where mining is stopped to preserve them in their present 
conditions thus enabling them to be reopened in case a bid is 
submitted from the private sector. We have it on our agenda to 
take every measure possible to minimize the damage to the 
Zonguldak Province and Karabuk. Investment and employment 
possibilities will be accelerated in Zonguldak Province and we 
are continuing to make a series of decisions to that end. 
  The TL7.6 trillion [approximately $271 million] employment 
infrastructure project for Zonguldak Province will be continued. 
Organized industrial regions will be established in Caycuma, 
Karabuk, and Eregli. This means that three organized industrial 
centers will have been established in Turkey during our 
government's tenure. Karabuk will become a province and will 
have priority status regarding development. In addition, a 
university will be established in Karabuk. 
  Preparatory research having been completed, work will be 
started on the Kilyos port project. Kilyos will be declared a 
free zone. Training courses will be started, enabling workers 
laid off from the TKK [Agricultural Credit Cooperative 
Association] and Karabuk Iron and Steel Works to acquire 
professional skills. These projects, to be completed within 
three years, will create employment possibilities for 
approximately 21,000 persons. 
  We are envisaging new stages in our agricultural endowment 
policy. Within the framework of this project, we plan on 
expanding the same system applied to cotton, tobacco, and tea. 
Our principles from now on will be the same as in the cotton 
produce -- supporting the payment of state subsidies directly 
the farmer. Free price policy will be applied to fertilizer. 
Government subsidies will not go to the firms but to the farmer 
directly. This means that state support will go directly to the 
farmer. The elimination of intermediary bodies will prevent 
losses which in turn will prevent great damage due to the above 
losses. 
  As you can see, a new reconstruction process which 
encompasses a large area and different issues will be 
perpetuated. 
  We are going to continue acting swiftly regarding the local 
and administrative arrangements of local administrations. 
  Honorable guests, as you can see, a new phase is starting. 
The most important issue in this phase is the trust issue, that 
is, the issue of trusting the program. The program has two 
footholds. The first one concerns measures regarding stability 
and the second one measures concerning reconstruction. We are 
announcing the first three-month balance sheet of the measures 
on stability. We will have the opportunity to follow and 
inspect these measures every three months. However, the most 
important issue is to free ourselves from former developments 
and draw a line between the past and the future. The coming 
three months will be a period of change, a period of transition. 
The changes that will take place during this transition period 
should not form the basis of our expectations nor form the 
framework for our future expectations. The first three months 
should be considered a transition period. We must have 
expectations only after this first three-month period is 
completed. Henceforth, this transition period will be the basis 
of all the collective wage agreements, price adjustments, and 
other social conciliations. That is, we are going to severe our 
ties with the past, the past issues, and the wrongs. Our new 
expectations should be crystallized for the period following the 
three-month transition period. This is the most important 
factor in the success of this program. 
  We started work with great determination and aspiration in 
order to implement this program. Within this framework, all 
levels of the society should take part in this privatization and 
consensus. We have to accomplish this consensus within all 
parts of the society. We have already established a consensus of 
this kind in our fight against terrorism. All parts of the 
community supported the fight against terrorism. 
  What we have here is terrorism with regard to economy. The 
economic issue is the accumulation of years. We approach this 
issue with measures that governments singly did not dare use. 
However, this program can not succeed with only one part of the 
sector supporting it. This program is based on conciliations 
and sacrifices by the entire public. We, as the government, are 
going to do everything in our power to render these sacrifices 
just. We are going to do this all together. We are going to do 
this together and with thought. 
  We are going to conduct a clear-cut inspection as well as an 
essential examination after the completion of each three-month 
period. We have to succeed. We have to succeed regarding this 
issue. If we fail, what is at stake is not the issue of our 
government's success but the issue of our country's economy. We 
have to break out of this point reached to this day. 
  To achieve this break out, we ask for the support of all 
parts of our country just as we did in our fight against 
terrorism. We want consensus and trust. This trust will be the 
trust we will have for each other. I wish all the best for our 
country.

  [Text] The downward trend in the Central Bank's foreign 
currency reserves is gradually gaining momentum. The repayment 
of foreign debts and the interventions aimed at placing the 
parity of foreign currencies under control have reduced the 
foreign currency reserves to $3.285 billion. The level of 
reserves decreased by $788 million from 11 to 18 March. A 
record fall took place from 18 to 25 March. Foreign currency 
reserves decreased by $803 million that week. This indicates 
that the foreign currency reserves decreased by 33 percent 
during the past two weeks. Consequently, the Central Bank's 
overall foreign currency reserves fell to $3.285 billion. 
  The Central Bank's foreign currency reserves totaled $7.193 
billion at the end of November 1993. The figures indicate that 
it lost 54 percent of its reserves during the past four months. 
The Central Bank's foreign currency reserves totaled $6.277 
billion on 1 January 1994. The bank lost 48 percent of that 
amount since the beginning of the year. The record drops in the 
Central Bank's foreign currency reserves have caused the amount 
of foreign currency held by that bank to be at an all-time low 
during the past two years. 
  Meanwhile, the Central Bank's foreign currency deficit has 
increased to $5.815 billion. The bank's debts in foreign 
currency total $10.588 billion. Its assets total $1.488 billion 
in gold and the equivalent of $3.285 billion in foreign currency.

<F P=106> [Editorial by Ilnur Cevik: "This Is Not the End of the </F>
World"] 
  [Text] The fact that the pro-Islamic Welfare Party (RP) won 
the mayoral seats in Ankara and Istanbul as well as in 25 other 
major cities across the country has created an uproar and has 
spread fear even among some Turks that the country is falling 
into the hands of Muslim fundamentalists. 
  This is an totally false assessment and misrepresents the 
realities in Turkey. 
  Firstly the Welfare Party, which could once have been termed 
as Muslim fundamentalist, has been transformed into a 
pro-Islamic party under the influence of young Islamic 
progressives like Melih Gokcek, who was elected mayor of Ankara, 
and Tayyip Erdogan, who won in Istanbul. So the progressive 
wing seems to be making advances in the party and they are 
distancing themselves from the fundamentalists... 
  Secondly the elections have shown that the nationwide 
popularity of the Welfare is only 18.75 percent, which means 
81.25 percent of Turks oppose it. Thus it is not a popular 
movement that can dominate our society. 
  Thirdly the new mayors of Istanbul and Ankara know well that 
they do not represent the majority of the people in their 
respective cities. (Both in Ankara and Istanbul the Welfare won 
the mayoral seats by winning about 25 to 27 percent of the 
votes). In Ankara 73 percent voted against the Welfare, and in 
Istanbul 75 percent rejected the pro-Islamic party. But because 
of the split in the votes the Welfare managed to win...Now the 
Welfare mayors have to realize they cannot run their cities in 
an arbitrary manner. Or else they will face both the citizens 
and the law. According to Turkish law, mayors who violate the 
law can be sacked by the Interior Minister... 
  Fourthly the mayors can only run their cities and provide 
services to the people. They cannot act like a police force or 
force people to do anything that is not included in the law. 
They cannot order women to cover up or interfere in the way we 
live. The RP is not, and will never be, a majority party in 
Parliament. 
  We feel most of the present concern is misplaced. People are 
acting as if the RP was the winner of a parliamentary election 
and will be running the country in the years to come. That is 
not true. 
  However, if people continue to display anger and frustration 
with the election victories of the Welfare, and try to resort to 
illegal means, we feel this will only serve to further polarize 
the public. 
  We also feel great concern over the emotional displays of 
Welfare supporters in Istanbul and Ankara after they heard about 
the victories of their candidates. They have to remember they 
do not represent the majority in either Istanbul or Ankara and 
their actions could well antagonize the general public. Let us 
first give the Welfare the benefit of the doubt. If they step 
out of line we have the laws and the government to put them 
firmly in their place.

<F P=106> [Saygi Ozturk report: "Operation Against Reactionary </F>
Elements in the Police Organization"] 
  [Excerpts] The General Directorate of Police has issued a 
report on the results of an investigation on reactionary 
activities of several police officials. The investigation 
revealed that many police officials, including several who 
served as police chiefs, have been involved in reactionary 
activities, have organized secret meetings, and have adopted 
code names in the organization. 
  The investigation was secretly carried out by the inspectors 
of the General Director of Police. The report written by the 
inspectors has been submitted to the Ankara State Security Court 
Prosecutor General's Office. 
  The investigation began when the General Directorate of 
Police received a letter from a student at the Ankara Police 
Academy, who was in his final year. State of Emergency Governor 
Unal Erkan was the general director of police at the time. The 
officials were shocked by the letter, which was submitted to the 
Police Inspection Council. 
<H5>  Placed Under Surveillance </H5>
  The police moved to tap the telephones of several officials 
and place their activities under surveillance. It was 
ascertained that several students in the Police Academy and 
other police training institutions took part in reactionary 
activities. It was also ascertained that several police 
officials held secret meetings in their homes, adopted code 
names, and used coded expressions in their telephone 
conversations. 
  The police inspectors concluded their investigation after 
many years. They submitted their report and several documents 
to the Ankara State Security Court Prosecutor General's Office. 
Meanwhile, several of the high-ranking officials, whose names 
appeared in their report, were removed from active duty. 
[passage omitted] 
<H5>  Pressure </H5>
  A police official said some time ago that the activities of 
reactionary groups in the police organization has created 
uneasiness. He stressed: "It is common knowledge that a 
significant amount of reactionary activity exists in the police 
organization. In fact, the reactionary officials have held 
influential posts at various times. An urgent solution must be 
found to resolve that problem. Meanwhile, a serious struggle 
exists between the reactionary groups. The officials have to be 
very careful on that matter. The inspectors, who are 
investigating the problem, are under significant pressure at the 
present time." 
  It has been claimed that the inspectors have asked for 
protection on grounds that their safety has been threatened. 
However, the claim has not been confirmed by the officials.

CSO 

  [Text] Ankara--The president of the Council of State, Metin 
Guven, said that secularism, a basic attribute of the republic, 
must not be a subject of debate. He said: "One cannot speak 
about a democratic system or a state of law without secularism. 
The secular state is a safeguard even for those who express 
ideas against secularism." 
  Guven, who will retire on 15 March because of age limits, 
expressed his views on debates about secularism and the work of 
the judiciary. 
  Guven said that one cannot say lawsuits are settled 
expeditiously in legal or administrative cases and noted that 
the Council of State takes at least a year to decide a case. 
  Guven explained that work is under way to solve this problem 
in administrative trials by adding two more departments to the 
Council of State and expanding its staff to adequate levels. He 
added: 
  "Because of the slow operation of the judiciary, the 
benefits 
expected from it are reduced to a minimum, and unfair practices 
persist. At a time when economic relations are expanding and 
inflation is soaring the losses of those who are harmed by these 
procedures are also growing. As a result it is necessary to go 
to the source of the problem." 
<H5>  Making Laws </H5>
  Stating that the source of the problem is the way laws are 
drafted, Guven said: "Above all, one cannot say that the 
necessary attention is paid to the drafting of the laws. A law 
must be drafted not just for the administration but with the 
participation and input of professional groups and other 
organizations which may be affected by that law. If that is 
done, the number of disputes and therefore lawsuits may be 
reduced. This is a very important approach whose implementation, 
however, is difficult." 
  Guven noted that the administration must comply with 
administrative judicial decisions and that contrary situations 
are not encountered very frequently in Turkey. He continued: 
  "However, sometimes the administration complies only 
formally 
while weakening the effectiveness of the decision. When someone 
is removed from office, the administration rehires him or 
appoints him to an equivalent office. Then it goes and dismisses 
him again. That starts an unending process of lawsuits. One must 
not forget that the administrator who does not comply with the 
judiciary's decision may need the same judiciary's decision if 
he is removed from office some day in the future." 
<H5>  Ottoman State Not Secular </H5>
  Commenting on debates about secularism that have intensified 
recently, Guven said that there can be no republic, democratic 
system or state of law without the principle of secularism and 
that this principle must not be debated. 
  Stating that there are attempts to interpret secularism in 
Turkey in a way other than how it is defined at its source, 
Guven said: 
  "There is an attempt to interpret secularism as freedom of 
religion and noninterference of the state in religion. This has 
absolutely nothing to do with secularism. A basic concept like 
secularism must be well-defined and its limits must be properly 
set. It is one thing for a state to be secular, it is another 
for it not to interfere in religion, beliefs, and thoughts. The 
noninterference of the state in religion means individual 
freedom of religion and conscience. A state which is not secular 
may also respect freedom of religion and conscience. Take for 
example the Ottoman Empire. But the Ottoman State was not 
secular. It was run by Islamic rules, Islamic codes of law and 
the provisions of the Koran, but it did not interfere in the 
religion of its subjects. That shows not that the Ottoman state 
was secular but that it was extremely respectful toward freedom 
of religion and conscience." 
<H5>  Secular State </H5>
  Stating that a secular state cannot be under the influence 
of 
any religion, Guven said: 
  "From this standpoint a secular system is in fact a 
safeguard 
of protection for all religions. A secular state is a safeguard 
even for those who express ideas against secularism. Every 
religion has its own denominations and sects. If we assume that 
the state is not secular, which of those sects will be dominant 
in the state? The dominance of any of those sects means that 
people who share the same religion will be even less protected 
than people from another religion. That is because there is 
closer rivalry between different sects of the same religion. 
Thus in a nonsecular state there would be no protection even for 
people who share the same religion as those who hold power."

<F P=106> [Report by Francis Deron: "Mr. Balladur Will Not Have </F>
Contacts with Chinese Dissidents"] 
  [Text] Beijing -- There is one thing which Beijing does 
not do in the sphere of foreign relations: predict the future. 
We should, therefore, pay attention to the statement made on 
Thursday, 31 March, by the Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman 
when he announced the visit to Beijing and Shanghai 7-10 April 
by Mr. Balladur, the first French Government chief to visit 
China in 16 years, after a quarrel lasting two years. 
  Claiming to be answering a question he was asked on possible 
contracts which could be signed during the visit, spokesman Wu 
Jianmin said in his weekly meeting with the press that the 
improvement in political relations was bound to benefit 
bilateral "economic and commercial cooperation." This can be 
interpreted to mean that no contracts will be signed during the 
visit, described as "important," but primarily aimed, in the 
mind of the Beijing authorities, at erasing the "mistake" made 
by Paris in selling arms to Taiwan. This is not really a 
surprise, but it is rare for China to take the trouble to 
clarify things in advance to this extent. 
  It is true that Edouard Balladur has made it known that he 
is 
not coming to Beijing as a foreign trade representative, but 
that his visit is of a symbolic nature likely to revive 
bilateral relations. This may partly explain some of the pomp of 
the visit. The prime minister will be accompanied in theory by 
around 30 senior civil servants and around 60 journalists, but 
also by no fewer than 50 personal guests, including one of his 
sons, his driver, and two head waiters. During his visit in 
November, German Chancellor Kohl also brought a large 
delegation, but one mostly made up of businessmen. 
  Mr. Balladur will reside at the state residence of the 
Fishermen's Terrace --the former residence of the Manchurian 
Empire's grand eunuchs, situated in the west of Beijing. Turned 
into a hotel for foreign dignitaries, it also houses the most 
select and expensive private club in post-Maoist China. The 
prime minister and his delegation will be granted the great 
privilege of entering the Forbidden City by car to visit some of 
the imperial apartments. In his two days in Beijing, in addition 
to the Chinese leaders, Mr. Balladur will meet with selected 
representatives of the French business community, as he will in 
Shanghai. 
  In terms with the people, he will host a dinner at the 
French 
ambassador's residence for several prominent figures, including 
one of Deng Xiaoping's daughters, the painter Deng Ling. In 
Shanghai, the prime minister will have a short meeting with 
local economic officials. If all goes as expected, the 
political police will prevent him from having to settle the 
dilemma which the presence in Beijing of prominent dissidents 
would have presented for him -- most of them, including Wei 
Jingsheng, were moved elsewhere more than a month ago.

  [Text] "The Northern League has not fully understood the 
elementary distinction between government and institutional 
reform: It must be clear that the government does not in any way 
have the task of reforming the institutions." 
  Gianfranco Fini, the leader of the National Alliance, was 
replying to Umberto Bossi. Fini added that "presidentialism is 
the only corner in government where federalism can exist, but 
federalism does not mean overturning the article of the 
Constitution which assigns primary functions to the State and 
residual functions to the regions". Fini then recalled that 
there could not be a parliamentary majority without either the 
Northern League or the National Alliance.

<F P=106> [Article by Economics Minister Guenther Rexrodt: "A </F>
Necessary Partnership Between International Trade and the 
Environment"] 
  [Text] Bonn -- Following seven years of negotiations, 
which were frequently marked by difficult, frequently 
unbridgeable differences not only between partners from the 
northern and southern hemispheres, but also between the states 
belonging to the European Union [EU], a treaty will be signed in 
Marrakesh, a treaty that represents more than just a stage on 
the way to a liberal world trade system that will benefit 
everyone. 
  With their signatures, the representatives of 117 states 
will 
not only eliminate the danger of a new form of protectionism and 
of a trade war in the event of negotiations collapsing, but they 
will set in motion a new process at the end of which -- in so 
far as such a process can have an end -- an extensive, fair and 
balanced world trade system, one integrating north, south, east, 
west, will be possible, a system, which in addition to bringing 
benefits for the individuals, also takes into account global 
aspects. 
  At the beginning of an economic upturn, this positive 
conclusion of negotiations will bolster the confidence of 
business and all those involved in the economy -- entrepreneurs 
and consumers, investors and manufacturers. On the one hand, 
the conclusion of the negotiations creates conditions for our 
companies to have worldwide improved access to existing and 
expanding new markets. On the other hand, what it provides for 
consumers is a larger, price-orientated supply of goods and 
services. 
  Even if it is difficult to give a precise figure for the 
"the 
economic gains" that will emerge in the long and short term, 
directly and indirectly, for the parties concerned, it can 
nevertheless be stated that the gains and advantages will amount 
to several hundred billion. 
<H5>  The Difficulties in Implementing the Results of the </H5>
Negotiations 
  However, what seems much more important to me is the higher 
degree of awareness with regard to cooperation in world trade, 
the extensive transfer of technology and know-how, the greater 
integration of developing countries and the countries of 
central, southeastern, and eastern Europe as well the former 
states of the Soviet Union into world trade and the 
international division of labor. 
  The end of the Uruguay Round is only the goal of a certain 
stage. In the ongoing process of liberalizing trade, we are only 
at the beginning of a more difficult phase, the implementation 
of results, creating the structures of new world trade 
organization, and especially the treatment of subjects the 
importance of which has been recognized, but in view of their 
complexity, could not be settled in these past negotiations. 
These subjects include issues relating to trade and 
competition, especially -- and I am personally concerned about 
this -- the field of trade and the environment, which contains 
many problems. 
  Those points of overlap between foreign trade and 
environmental protection are being discussed more extensively 
thanks to public opinion, which set the process in motion and 
induced governments to take action. 
  There are two contrasting patterns of thinking: Some believe 
that international trade, as the engine of the world economy, 
definitely affects the environment -- possibly in a negative way 
-- but that liberalization may be of benefit to the environment 
if, on the one hand, the more effective and more economic use of 
resources is maintained and, on the other hand, more prosperity 
is created. That is why, especially in countries that are 
dependent on the export of raw materials, there would also be 
more money for environmental protection, investment in the 
environment, the purchase of appropriate technology, but also 
training, including further training, and the combating of 
poverty. 
  The opposing party is no less strong and is definitely also 
armed with good, weighty arguments, and it places environmental 
protection above all else. It indulges in wishful thinking 
about a zero burden on the environment combined with zero 
growth, without revealing what possibilities there are 
particularly for leading developing countries out of their 
difficult situation, the hopelessness of overpopulation, 
poverty, environmental damage, and technological and economic 
backwardness. This area of overlap is a key area for action and 
a main concern in the future work of the world trade 
organization. 
  The parties to GATT have decided that the UN Conference on 
Economic Development process should be taken up by GATT, and 
that particularly entails promoting lasting development through 
the liberalization of trade as well as mutual support on the 
part of trade and environment politicians. The particular 
importance of the principles contained in Chapter 2.22 of 
Charter 21, namely, the necessity of international cooperation 
and the condemnation of unilateral measures, has been stressed. 
  The elements of the work program have already been discussed 
and fixed within the framework of the Trade Negotiating 
Committee. Decisions about it should also be made in Marrakesh. 
However, to my mind, the start that has been made is 
insufficient. There are significant aspects and partial 
problems that have not been addressed. We must approach these 
general problems in a more comprehensive manner. 
  In my opinion, there are two viewpoints that should be the 
basis of further action: The intensification of the 
international division of labor combined with a marked increase 
in the volume of trade -- also as a result of the liberalizing 
effects of the Uruguay Round -- are to be welcomed in view of 
their positive effects on economic growth and development and 
should be promoted. However, a healthy and intact environment 
-- it is the basis for life, and without it, no trade would be 
possible -- is an increasingly scarce commodity and one whose 
status is becoming increasingly important in all countries. 
  If a contradiction is perceived in that, then it is only 
apparently so. It is entirely possible for environmental 
protection and liberal international trade to be made 
compatible, assuming that rules are comprehensible, clearly 
defined, consider both areas, and clearly established. 
  Long before the conclusion of the GATT round, the 
representatives of diverse institutions called for a "green 
round" or talked of the necessity of "greening the GATT." 
However, the question one must really ask oneself is if the 
current GATT rules -- applied correctly and in accordance with 
the principles -- which have created a worldwide legal framework 
for international trade, also provide such a framework for 
environmental protection measures? 
  Do present GATT regulations really fail to provide a balance 
between the right people that have to determine paths and goals, 
to protect their health and the environment and the right to 
profit from trade that is as liberal as possible? 
<H5>  Abuses Can Be Prevented Now </H5>
  Is there really a need for "greening the GATT" or to create 
special GATT exceptions that justify the introduction of 
restrictions on trade or compensatory tariffs for environmental 
protection reasons, such as the protection of tropical 
rainforests or reduce carbon dioxide emission levels? Or is it 
the case that regulations about nondiscrimination provide much 
better protection against measures that harm the international 
trading system, being resorted to under the pretext of 
environmental protection? 
  A comparison of the economic, political, and legal status of 
various environmental protection instruments shows GATT 
regulations already contain possibilities for using 
environmental protection instruments efficiently and preventing 
their abuse by using environmental grounds as an excuse. 
<H5>  State Independence </H5>
  GATT goals, namely "the full use of world resources for 
development" (GATT preamble), by way of banning obscure, 
discriminatory or unreasonable trading restrictions and 
distortions also apply to our environmental resources. The 
consistent application of GATT environmental policy measures 
will make it much more likely that the goals of the policy will 
be achieved and, at the same time, will represent a model for 
the production, use, consumption and reprocessing of goods. 
  Thus, the authors of GATT have taken a much broader view 
than 
one suspects and -- perhaps this is not perceptible and apparent 
to everyone -- established a basis for environmental protection 
in the regulations on trade. 
  GATT proceeds from the principle of state independence. 
Every member state has the freedom to introduce internal taxes 
and regulations and is at liberty to employ other protection 
measures for reasons of environmental protection. The current 
settlement contained in Article 22 in conjunction with GATT 
makes that perfectly clear! The use of measures to protect the 
goods listed there is permitted, but, as always within the 
framework of GATT, not in a groundless and unlimited way. These 
measures come under GATT basic principles and are conditioned to 
that extent. 
  Thus, the GATT regulations not only empower the parties to 
resort to measures and employ instruments that are necessary 
from the viewpoint of economists. They have also always 
provided a basis for measures called for by ecologists to the 
extent that they deal with trade issues. The question is not 
"whether," but "whether it is enough?" In this area too, 
something decisive has happened. Thus, the current GATT 
regulations have to a large extent provided the possibility of 
taking into account environmental protection aspects within the 
framework of GATT basic principles. 
<H5>  A Whole Series of Open Questions </H5>
  Existing possibilities for using GATT for environmental 
protections have been further enhanced, extended, and bolstered 
through a whole series of additional measures and legal 
settlements contained in the various agreements that were 
concluded within the framework of the Uruguay Round, for example: 
  -- The codex subsidies do not exclude support and assistance 
for the promotion of environmental protection. If they satisfy 
certain conditions, they cannot be attacked. 
  -- The treaty on technical trade restrictions sets out a 
procedure for determining whether a product or production 
process "restricts trade more than is absolutely necessary to 
pursue justified interests such as the protection of health, 
plant or animal life, or the environment quite simply." 
  -- Like Article 22 of GATT, the treaty on services also does 
not rule out general exceptions such as the protection of the 
life and health of people, animals, and plants. 
  The existing rules, measures, and procedures that are to be 
implemented with the Marrakesh signing indicate that there is 
growing concern on the part of GATT partners to bring the rules 
of international trade and the necessity of preserving the 
environment into harmony with each other. To orient trade and 
the environment to achieving the GATT preamble principle of the 
efficient use of world resources, trade and environmental 
regulations should be mutually supportive. This requires that 
the prices of the products and services that are traded should 
reflect internal and external cost factors. 
  Trade restrictions tend to distort prices and should not 
therefore be a substitute for more efficient direct 
environmental measures such as production, product, or 
consumption taxes and controls. Liberal trade regulations will 
also contribute to improving trade and environmental techniques 
and technologies. 
  However, despite what has been achieved, there are still 
things that have to be done in order to achieve the goal of 
sustained development in the field of "trade and the 
environment" too. Even if the existing GATT agreement and the 
additional procedures, measures, and settlements already take 
into account environmental considerate in numerous ways or at 
least try to, a whole series of questions and aspects still 
remains open and has to be dealt with. 
  The first condition for this is to be created in Marrakesh. 
Within the framework of the future world trade organization -- 
and on an interim basis until it is created -- structural 
conditions should be created for dealing with theses issues. A 
special agency -- irrespective of how it should be called or 
will be called -- staffed by trade and environment experts will 
deal with the basic issues. 
  The following subject areas -- for which basic preparations 
have been made in other international organizations such as the 
OECD, the UN Environment Program, and the UN Conference on Trade 
and Development -- should be addressed by this agency thoroughly 
and as quickly as possible: 
  -- An extensive investigation of those points in trade that 
would be affected by the application of environmental measures 
with the goal of making the GATT regulations, including Article 
22, concrete. This entails that measures stemming from national 
environment policies and international environmental treaties, 
which intervene in international trade to varying degrees (for 
example, voluntary product identification, economic instruments, 
and import bans) and vary in their geographical scope (which 
means investigating causes and consequences) must be viewed in a 
differentiated manner when checked on the basis of the 
principles that are to be applied under GATT; 
<H5>  Extensive Development </H5>
  -- Specific rules and procedures for dealing with so-called 
environmental dumping and environmental subsidies; 
  -- Additional requirements for the notification of trade 
measures based on environmental grounds with a view to greater 
clarity and to facilitating consultations; 
  -- The investigation and assessment of environmental 
treaties 
or other international treaties from the viewpoint of their 
relevance for trade, and conversely of trade measures from the 
viewpoint of their environmental relevance. 
  Marrakesh cannot represent an end or even a transitional 
stage, but must solely represent a new beginning. It must 
represent a new beginning for an intensive dialogue between 
trade and environment policies and politicians on national and 
international levels with the goal of mutual support for trade 
and environment policies and the constant assessment and 
checking of such policies on the basis of criteria established 
jointly, and this could make a contribution to bringing about 
the desired partnership between trade and environment policies 
and thus to partnership between international trade and the 
environment. 
  A dialogue that is established in this way is a contribution 
to extensive, sustained growth.

<F P=106> [Report on news conference by Vladimir Zhirinovskiy, leader </F>
of the Liberal Democratic Party of Russia, by correspondent 
Liisa Linsioe in Helsinki; date not given; Recording of 
Zhirinovskiy fading into report within quotation marks] 
  [Excerpt] [Passage omitted] "Our party has never had and 
does not have territorial demands on Finland. Finland is and 
always will be an independent country, but it is very unpleasant 
if Finland wants to join NATO or some other military alliance 
acting against Russia. Membership in NATO would only bring 
corpses for Finland. As Russia and NATO would be brought into 
war against each other, Finland would be the battlefield and 
that is very regrettable. I know that efforts are now being 
made to incorporate our neighboring countries Poland and the 
Baltics into NATO. That is very regrettable from our point of 
view." 
  Having arrived in Finland, Vladimir Zhirinovskiy denies his 
earlier demands for Finland to be incorporated into Russia and 
for the borders valid during the czar era to be restored. We do 
not want to revive the western borders of the Russian empire, we 
support the resolutions of the Conference on Security and 
Cooperation in Europe held in Helsinki in 1975. Together with 
other countries, Russia has ratified and signed the Helsinki 
agreement. 
  A remark by Zhirinovskiy that the October Revolution was 
illegal and that Russia must restore the prerevolution borders 
nevertheless contradicts this statement. At his party congress 
[words indistinct] Zhirinovskiy showed a map indicating that 
Finland belongs to Russia and this was also included in the 
resolutions of the Liberal Democratic Party. Having arrived in 
Finland, Zhirinovskiy has not let lie the demands for a return 
of Karelia. 
  "You have a successor who seeks to restore Karelia to 
Finland, but Karelia belongs to Russia. As you know, 
territorial demands only lead to war. You can see what is 
happening in the Balkans, in Central Asia, the Middle East. We 
must [word indistinct], be quiet and moderate." 
  Zhirinovskiy is voicing language policy demands to Finland. 
  "I think it would be a good thing if the Russian language 
were to become the third official language in Finland. I said 
that when I visited this country three years ago. Why do you 
have Swedish as the second language? At the least, write street 
names in Russian, and restaurant menus. Open a Russian school. 
Three years ago I asked for the Russian sixth form college to be 
reopened and why do you keep the Russian church as a storeroom, 
Zhirinovskiy asks. He does not even listen; although, it is 
explained to him that Helsinki does have both a Russian school 
and an Orthodox church, which are doing quite well." 
  Zhirinovskiy is boasting about his relations with the 
Finno-Ugric nations living in Russia. In the elections, he 
received quite a lot of votes from our distant relatives, 
because Zhirinovskiy promised to retain the kolkhozes, knowing 
that the Ugrians of Russia fear the privatization of agriculture. 
  "I am a member of the cultural society of Udmurtia, and we 
are well disposed towards your kindred nations the Udmurts, the 
Khants, Manses, and Maris, but you Finns do not care about your 
relatives. You only distance yourselves from them. Following on 
this, Zhirinovskiy reiterates his previous suggestion to be 
allowed to send Russian children from St. Petersburg to Lapland 
to celebrate New Year. Let us jointly develop trade and sports, 
he suggests. But if some general in your country demands that 
Karelia shall be reincorporated into Finland, the result will be 
only corpses, Zhirinovskiy threatens." 
  Vladimir Volfovich Zhirinovskiy, who has been granted 
dictatorial powers by his own party for the next 10 years, is 
already preparing at full speed for the next presidential 
elections, but nevertheless he does not show his cards for 
Yeltsin to see. Zhirinovskiy denies rumors that Yeltsin is sick 
and is no longer capable of discharging his duties. This is 
what Zhirinovskiy has to say about Yeltsin: 
  "Boris Nikolayevich is feeling fine, do not nurse any hopes 
that he would leave his post somehow. He will last until the 
end of term. After 12 June, there will be another president in 
the country. Our president, our nation, and our Army too are 
feeling fine. Hopefully, your president too is feeling fine and 
will live long. President Yeltsin is only cunning and now and 
again he plays a sick man, Zhirinovskiy claims. It is rumored 
that he is after all a good friend of Boris Yeltsin." 
  In Zhirinovskiy's view, France's ban on Zhirinovskiy is 
linked to Russia's internal political struggle for power. 
France is defending tooth and nail the democrats in Russia, 
Zhirinovskiy claims: 
  "[words indistinct] They understand it is impossible to stop 
me in my country. They are trying to thwart my support in my own 
country, but they will not succeed. They cannot stop me. They 
do not order what the Russians should think and whom they should 
support. It is better for me to be at home in Russia among my 
own voters, because that is where I am doing political work." 
  Zhirinovskiy boasts that he represents the views of the 
majority in the Russian parliament, the Duma. In voting, we 
receive a majority with the support of the communists, farmers, 
and small groups, he says. This is indeed true when one follows 
voting in the Russian Duma. 
  The democratic members of the delegation say that they 
disagree completely with Zhirinovskiy for example on NATO, the 
Council of Europe, and Finland, but the big-mouthed chairman of 
the Liberal Democratic Party interrupts their talk, claiming 
that they got into the Russian Duma by fraudulent means. In 
this way Vladimir Zhirinovskiy floors his opponents: 
  "We received 50, as much as 70 percent of all votes in the 
elections. They, my opponents, stole my votes and for that 
reason they are now in the Duma quite illegally. There are 
groups who should not be in the Duma at all, but after the next 
elections they will no longer be there, claims Mr. Zhirinovskiy. 
Then the Liberal Democrats' number of representatives in the 
Duma will total 300 out of 450 seats. There will no longer be 
any democrats in the next Duma, we will see to that, 
Zhirinovskiy boasts." 
  He declares that he is a convinced opponent of western 
democracy. 
  "Russia does not have any model countries, we go our own 
way. 
I did not come here to Finland to learn from you, I have 
nothing to learn. I am ready to teach you if you so wish. We in 
Russia do not need the Council of Europe or NATO, but if they 
need Russia, then let them learn from us. Recently in Moscow we 
set up a pan-Slav parliament that unites Eastern Europe. 
Finland could join that too, Zhirinovskiy suggests." 
  It is vain to explain to him that the Finns are not a Slav 
nation. 
  The Finnish unemployment problem brings out the 
schadenfreude 
in Zhirinovskiy. 
  "You now have half a million unemployed, soon they will be 1 
million, unless you want economic cooperation with us. We will 
then have cooperation with Sweden if our cooperation is not good 
enough for Finland." 
  In breach of all agreements signed by Russia, Zhirinovskiy 
demands that the Baltics be reincorporated into Russia. He 
swears that the Russian troops will remain in the Baltics as 
Russia's outpost picket. He claims that the states that have 
separated from Russia are all the time rejoining. That is what 
Tajikistan, Armenia, Georgia, Azerbaijan, and so forth are now 
doing. 
  To Mr. Zhirinovskiy, NATO's Partnership for Peace is mere 
bluffing by which small states are deceived. It is only the 
porch into NATO, he claims. Russia was deceived when the Warsaw 
Treaty was wound up, because NATO was not wound up at the same 
time, but NATO will fall, Zhirinovskiy forecasts. When the 
Liberal Democratic Party gains power in Russia, Russia will 
leave the United Nations and the center of Europe will be in 
Russia. 
  The intervention of the other parliamentary deputies in the 
talking makes Zhirinovskiy angry. He leaves the news conference 
very angry. 
  Zhirinovskiy leaves angrily when the reporters began to 
interview other members of the delegation. To them Zhirinovskiy 
is quite an embarrassing representative in the Russian 
parliament. [passage omitted]

  [Text] Ankara, April 5 (A.A.) -- Albanian President Sali 
Berisha, who is currently in Turkey, said on Tuesday [5 April] 
that Albania gave priority to friendly ties with Turkey. 
  Berisha spoke at a luncheon in his honor. 
  "Turkey and Albania have strong traditional, historical, and 
cultural relations," Berisha said. "Albanian people will always 
respect Turkish people and Gazi Mustafa Kemal Ataturk, the 
founder of modern Turkish Republic." 
  "He (Ataturk) founded the contemporary Turkish Republic with 
his political and military genius, extraordinary courage, and 
determination." 
  He also said Turkey is a strong, peaceful, and stable 
element 
in its region and played an important role in preserving peace, 
security, freedom and democracy within the framework of North 
Atlantic Treaty Organization. 
  The guest president spoke on Turkey's efforts in the Balkans 
and said that Turkey can have a vital role in the crisis in 
Bosnia. 
  "The concern that the war in Bosnia could spread to southern 
parts of the Balkans affected the improvement of the reforms 
that were put into practice in Albania," he said. 
  Berisha said its impossible to provide stability in the 
Balkans without finding the true solution for Kosovo problem. 
  He said his country welcomed the presence of Turkish 
soldiers 
in Bosnia. 
  "Turkish soldiers are going to Bosnia for peace and will 
spend efforts to contribute to peace," he said.

<F P=106> ["voy"-signed report: "Covered With Soil and Plants for </F>
Camouflage"] 
  [Text] Vienna -- "On 15 February, North Korea promised in 
writing that we could take samples and do tests in the radio 
chemical laboratory to make sure that no plutonium was taken out 
in the past 12 months. Without this promise, our inspectors 
would not have gone to North Korea in March," David Kyd, 
spokesman of the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), told 
DER STANDARD on Tuesday [5 April]. These samples are absolutely 
necessary since the seal has been broken and the checking 
devices installed by the IAEA have expired. 
  On the issue of using satellite photos, Kyd said that after 
the Gulf War, the IAEA Council of Governors adopted a written 
resolution saying that the IAEA shall be given access to all 
"additional information," which includes satellite photos, 
intelligence reports, and information by nuclear experts. After 
all, the experience with Iraq has shown that the declaration of 
nuclear installations by individual states is not sufficient. 
The Council of Governors' resolution applies to all states that 
have signed an inspection agreement with the IAEA, and this 
includes North Korea. 
  "South Africa did not oppose satellite photos," Kyd said. 
"But North Korea is annoyed because the photos come from the 
United States." 
  On the two mysterious installations in Yongbyon, Kyd said: 
"Satellite photos have shown that these installations were 
suddenly covered with soil and plants so they would be 
camouflaged before our first inspection in 1992. If they really 
are just military installations, then why are they not showing 
them to us?"

  [Text] Brussels, April 6 (AFP) -- NATO still hopes Russia 
will sign the Partnership for Peace accord in April as the 
Moscow government has repeatedly announced, a NATO spokesman 
said Wednesday [6 April]. 
  Russian President Boris Yeltsin on Wednesday said Russia was 
seeking a special accord with NATO taking account of Russia's 
military strength and nuclear status. 
  "We still hope that the signature will take place in April, 
as announced by [Foreign Minister Andrey] Kozyrev," the 
spokesman for the North Atlantic Treaty Organisation said. 
  Deputy Foreign Minister Vitaly Churkin said on Tuesday that 
Russia would join the program by April 21. 
  The NATO spokesman said: "We have not been officially 
informed about the Russian preferred date of the signing of the 
Partnership for Peace framework document." 
  NATO sources said it was clear that the Russians were 
determined to join the Partnership for Peace program, but that 
NATO was having difficulties in working out exactly what type of 
cooperation Russia wanted with the Alliance. 
  The Partnership for Peace, aimed at increasing military 
cooperation between the 16 members of NATO and the former East 
Bloc countries, has already been signed by Romania, Lithuania, 
Poland, Estonia, Hungary, Ukraine, Slovakia, Bulgaria, Latvia, 
Albania, the Czech Republic, Moldova, Georgia and Slovenia.

  [Text] Ladies and Gentlemen, we will now read government 
spokesman Evangelos Venizelos' reaction to the EU [European 
Union] Commission's decision: Today's decision by the EU 
Commission is inappropriate and contradictory. While it 
recognizes the primary political character of the Skopje [The 
Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia, FYROM] issue and the 
Greek measures of 16 February, in principle, it chooses the 
legal route to deal with the problem. Within this framework, we 
should note: First, the EU Commission is holding back until 13 
April. Second, the EU Commission is officially calling on 
Skopje to amend its Constitution and flag. The Greek Government 
expresses its regret, because this contradictory position by the 
EU Commission does not take into account the recent report from 
the UN secretary general to the Security Council or the 
mediation of Cyrus Vance. The relevant political initiatives by 
the European Union, which the Commission sees moving in parallel 
with Vance's work, and the mission of Matthew Nimetz [U.S. 
President Bill Clinton's special envoy on FYROM] are being 
jeopardized. And there is the additional danger that the EU 
Commission's decision today will encourage the intransigence of 
the Skopjean Government, which, due to its stance, should be on 
the receiving end of the international community's pressure. 
The possibility of the EU Commission appealing to the European 
Court is of secondary importance. In the final analysis, such a 
development will provide the opportunity for Greece's rich and 
strong legal arguments to unfold, arguments that complement the 
political base of the Greek positions. 
  The government spokesman's statement concludes: The Greek 
Government hopes that by 13 April and given that Vance has 
already issued his invitation for 11 April, the EU Commission 
can reach a more specific position that will aim to safeguard 
peace and stability in the region and reinforce the EU's common 
foreign policy.

  [Text] Brussels, April 7 (AFP) -- The European Union [EU] 
called on North Korea here Thursday [7 April] to open its 
nuclear sites to international inspection, and warned that 
Pyongyang's refusal to do so was a threat to stability and 
security. 
  The EU issued a statement urging North Korea to comply with 
its agreement on February 15 to allow inspectors of the 
International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) full access to North 
Korean nuclear facilities. 
  "The EU reiterates that prospects for a better relationship 
with the Democratic Peoples Republic of Korea would be greatly 
enhanced if concerns over North Korea's nuclear activities and 
intentions could be alleviated," it said. 
  The EU also called on North Korea to hold talks with South 
Korea on the denuclearisation of the Korean peninsula. 
  The EU also gave its full backing to the IAEA's efforts to 
ensure that Pyongyang complies with the Nuclear 
Non-Proliferation Treaty and does not pursue development of 
atomic weapons. 
  The statement followed North Korea's refusal last Monday to 
continue opening up its nuclear sites to IAEA inspection, and a 
North Korean Foreign Ministry statement that it was ending a 
suspension of "peaceful nuclear activities." 
  Four days earlier, on May 31, the United Nations Security 
Council had urged North Korea to allow a full inspection of its 
nuclear facilities, and hinted at economic sanctions if the 
inspections were not allowed.

  [Excerpts] Russian membership in the Council of Europe will 
largely depend on the withdrawal of Russian troops from the 
Baltic countries. It was also possible to list the other 
obstacles hindering Russia's membership in the Council during a 
two-day seminar in Helsinki. This is what Olli Rehn, the 
chairman of the Finnish delegation to the Council of Europe, 
said. 
  [Begin Rehn recording] Russia cannot become a member before 
there is an agreement on the withdrawal of the troops. [end 
recording] 
  [Correspondent Sinikka Siekkinen] However, Rehn said that 
there are good grounds to assume that there will be agreement 
between Russia and Estonia so that the Russian troops will be 
withdrawn by the end of August. Latvia has also reached a 
preliminary agreement with Russia on the withdrawal of the main 
part of its troops. Other obstacles standing in the way of 
Russian membership concern human rights and press freedom. The 
rights of minorities were also discussed. [passage omitted] 
  Vladimir Lukin, the head of the Russian delegation, 
expressed 
the view that the meeting was very useful for the Russians 
because many members of the delegation had very shaky 
information on the Council of Europe. 
  [Begin Lukin recording, in English] This conference was very 
useful for us, the majority of our group before this conference 
(? very big) impression on what the Council of 
Europe...[recording interrupted by correspondent; sentence as 
received] [end recording] 
  [Siekkinen] According to Lukin, now that the Council of 
Europe is much more familiar to them, it is easier to decide 
whether to join it or not. 
  Lukin also acknowledged the fact that a member of the 
delegation, Vladimir Zhirinovskiy, behaved better than expected 
at the actual meeting, to everyone's surprise. This is what 
Olli Rehn said about Zhirinovskiy's excessive media coverage. 
  [Begin Rehn recording] I hope that the media -- the press 
and 
the electronic media -- pay as much attention to the 
implementation of Russia's membership in the Council of Europe 
and the fact that the process is progressing, as it has done to 
these extra events during this two-day seminar. These are two 
matters of a completely different scale; Russia's membership in 
the Council of Europe is a really important issue concerning the 
security of the whole of Europe.

  [Text] Basel, Switzerland, April 5 (AFP) -- The European 
Monetary Institute (EMI) has found a building in Frankfurt, 
Germany, for its headquarters, the Institute's Press Department 
announced in Basel on Tuesday [5 April]. 
  The EMI, the forerunner of the European Union's [EU] central 
bank, has been theoretically headquartered in the German city 
since January 1, but it had not found premises. 
  The announcement said the Institute would be moving into its 
premises next November 1, in the Eurotower Building in the city 
center, facing the Frankfurt Opera. It formerly belonged to BfG 
bank. 
  EMI President Alexandre Lamfallusy of Belgium signed a lease 
to the building on Tuesday. The Institute has been temporary 
housed in Basel at the headquarters of the Bank for 
International Settlements -- which Lamfalussy headed until last 
January 1. 
  The Institute's status as the forerunner of a European 
central bank and in preparation for the EU common currency was 
laid down in the Community's Maastricht Treaty.

<F P=106> [Report by Alfred Schwarz] </F>
  [Text] According to the Austrian authorities, a UN request 
for help with the reconstruction of Tuzla airport was turned 
down for technical reasons. Austria was asked to provide a 
certain type of stacker trucks, which the Austrian Army does not 
have. Purchasing such devices would have cost millions of 
Austrian schillings. 
  Another UN request, to train Pakistani troops in an Austrian 
training area, proved impossible for technical and legal 
reasons. The Pakistani UN soldiers should have been trained on 
old GDR tanks that are being used by UNPROFOR [UN Protection 
Force] in Bosnia. But as Austria does not have such tanks, the 
army would have had to import them and train Austrian 
instructors to use them first, so as to be able to train the 
Pakistanis. Foreign troop maneuvers on Austrian territory would 
also have required a state treaty between Austria and the UN. 
This could not have been concluded within a few weeks, as would 
have been necessary, the Austrian Government said.

<F P=106> [Studio interview with South African Foreign Minister Roelof </F>
Botha by Robert Hochner -- live; Botha statements in English] 
  [Text] [Hochner] I now welcome South African Foreign 
Minister Roelof Botha in our studio. Good evening, Mr. Minister. 
  Mr. Minister, in your opinion, how great is the chance that 
the Zulus will participate in these first really free elections 
in your country? 
  [Botha] I think I must first of all clarify some very 
important points. The Zulu people are divided. According to 
our information, the African National Congress also has strong 
support among the Zulus. What is, of course, very, very 
important is that the king of the Zulus certainly has the 
support of the majority of the Zulus. But this is now causing a 
tremendous tension because the majority of the Zulus support the 
king because of their loyal feelings and emotions toward the him. 
  On the other hand, the majority of the Zulus want to take 
part in the elections and this is the crux of the matter. The 
South African Government is in between. We are doing our 
absolutely best to try to bring about reconciliation. 
  The day after tomorrow, Friday, a very important meeting 
will 
take place. For the first time, the four leaders, namely 
President De Klerk, Mr. Mandela, as well as the Zulu king, and 
Chief Buthelezi, will meet first bilaterally and then later 
jointly. We do hope that some way of this present impasse could 
be found. 
  [Hochner] I understand that it would be best for South 
Africa, for your country, if this solution were achieved. But 
what will happen if it is not achieved? Is a postponement of 
the elections conceivable, in order to have more time and to 
talk to Zulu King Zwelithini? Or is an election possible that 
takes place in the whole of South Africa, but not in KwaZulu and 
Natal? 
  [Botha] You are asking a very important question. The fact 
of the matter is that the overwhelming majority of the South 
Africans want to vote. The greater part of the country is free 
of violence. I am afraid that media concentrate only on 
violence. In the greater part of South Africa you can travel, 
you can relax, and find no violence whatsoever. I am not 
blaming the media for concentrating on the violence, but I 
thought I should tell my friends in Austria and Germany that 
South Africa is not going up in flames. 
  I have a very real hope that the elections will take place. 
There will be turbulence. We could not do what we have done 
without turbulence because the change has been too dramatic. 
Both in the minds of the whites and the blacks there are 
tremendous doubts, but we are resolved to go ahead to have the 
elections. My party will be a prominent member of the new 
government. We trust that a solution will be found for the 
position of the Zulu king. 
  [Hochner] One could say that the whites are ceding or giving 
back the power to the majority, the black majority. Might the 
blacks not only get the political, but also the economic power 
back from the whites in a relatively short time and might 
disputes over economic questions and influence in the economy 
arise between the white minority and the black majority? 
  [Botha] We are not thinking in terms of color any longer. 
Those days are past. 
  [Hochner] Are you sure that this also applies to the black 
majority? 
  [Botha] Yes, yes. I can testify to this. I accompanied 
President De Klerk last Sunday to one of the biggest religious 
meetings in the world where 2 million black South Africans 
gathered. They belong to the Zionist Christian Church. The 
friendship and warmth that President de Klerk and myself were 
seeing was astounding. My own party has a growing number of 
black followers. My aim is to have a majority of blacks 
supporting my party in the Transvaal Province. I wish Europe 
would start accepting that this is a new South Africa. 
  [Hochner] Thank your very much, Mr. Foreign Minister. Good 
luck to you and your country for the elections. 
  [Botha] We need it. 
  [Hochner] Thank you.

the Foreign Ministry. 
  Under the agreement, which is the legal basis for a regular

other rights for certain routes. Air traffic between Vienna and 
Minsk has been started both by Austrian Airlines and the 
Belarussian air carrier Belevia.

took the lives of Major General Juvenal Habyarimana, president 
of the Rwandan Republic; Mr Cyprien Ntaryamira, president of the

<F P=106> [Report signed Ph.P: "Chinese Puzzle in the Walloon Party </F>
of Labor: Belgium-China Association Funds Belgian Extreme Left"] 
  [Text] We knew that the Belgium-China Association (ABC) 
(officially attached to promoting Belgian-Chinese relations) was 
infiltrated by the Walloon Party of Labor (PTB). Its financial 
practices were said to be curious, at the very least. Documents 
that have come into our possession confirm both of these facts. 
Tourism in China helps to finance the extreme left in our 
country. A report by the ABC auditors, in defiance of the 
majority of the board, thus condemned the 1992 use of the 
Association's tourism license by the Anti-Imperialist League, an 
outgrowth of the PTB devoted to the "liberation" of the Third 
World! The auditors were amazed, moreover, to see "hundreds of 
thousands of Belgian francs paid to airlines, without any 
invoices...." 
  Just as confusing for the auditors was "the reason why, 
without a valid accounting document, an ABC debt of over 1 
million Belgian francs was written off overnight by Luxingshe," 
the official Chinese tourist body. Was this a hidden payment by 
Beijing to its Belgian lackeys? Or was it fraud destined to 
refloat a nonprofitmaking association which, while its tours 
have generated "turnover of over 70 million Belgian francs," has 
regularly run up debts to the point where it could no longer pay 
its various rents? This paradox adds further fuel to the theory 
that funds are being transferred to the PTB.

<F P=106> [By Deric Henderson, PRESS ASSOCIATION News] </F>
  [Excerpts] The Government today flatly rejected intensified 
Sinn Fein demands for direct talks. 
  Amid efforts by republicans for direct dialogue, the IRA's 
72-hour ceasefire was still holding tonight. 
  Sinn Fein chairman Tom Hartley delivered a letter to Downing 
Street urging Mr Major to authorise talks in the wake of the 
Downing Street declaration. The leader of the political wing of 
the IRA said of the ceasefire: "This initiative should be built 
upon. It is a step forward in the development of a real peace 
process and deserves an imaginative response from the British 
Government." 
  Mr Hartley said there had to be a desire to break new ground 
on all sides of the political divide. There had to be no 
preconditions in the arena of openness and imagination. He 
added: "The IRA initiative and Sinn Fein's peace strategy is 
evidence that this type of thinking exists in Republican ranks. 
It would be a mistake to believe that it is only the grand 
gesture which unlocks conflict. On the contrary, it is the small 
moves which are the motor for change." 
  Although the letter will be studied at Downing Street, the 
Government repeated its earlier insistence that direct dialogue 
could not take place until there was a permanent end to violence. 
  A spokesman said: "The Government position is clear. We are 
not negotiating with them and we are not going to clarify the 
joint declaration. They know what needs to be done, a 
renunciation of violence." 
  Unionist MPs rejected the so-called truce as a cynical ploy 
by the terrorists to put pressure on London. 
  And the east Belfast Democratic Unionist MP Mr Peter 
Robinson 
claimed Sinn Fein and the Government were in secret contact 
again, and said London would eventually cave in to the Sinn Fein 
demands for clarification. 
  Ulster Unionist leder Mr James Molyneaux said the ceasefire 
was "utterly contemptible" and accused the SDLP [Social 
Democratic Labour Party] leader John Hume of being "the actor's 
voice" of Gerry Adams. [passage omitted] 
  Although the level of security on the streets of Belfast 
today appeared to drop, police and troops remained vigilant. 
One soldier on duty in the city centre said: "The situation 
hasn't changed. I don't feel any more relaxed. I just don't 
trust them (the IRA)." 
  Republicans staged a series of protest pickets outside RUC 
[Royal Ulster Constabulary] stations tonight and one was also 
held at the gates of the British Embassy in Dublin, which Irish 
Foreign Affairs Minister Dick Spring dismissed as a "cheap and 
odious."

<F P=106> [Report signed "J.F.": "Call for Majority Unity"] </F>
  [Text] Edouard Balladur is moving closer and closer to the 
presidential election, without wishing to say so clearly. 
Yesterday, in the National Assembly or, briefly, on the FR3 
television news, he tried to step up his little declarations of 
intention, showing that he was in the race but without 
committing himself any further. "I accept the presidential 
risk," he said on camera. "We (the French people) feel a need 
for unity and cohesion." The majority needs to unite on clear 
and coherent ideas to steer France out of the economic impasse 
and avert a damaging leadership struggle. "Have I not always 
said that we could only succeed together? Otherwise...." 
  Otherwise chaos will ensue. Once again, yesterday, the prime 
minister reaffirmed in less and less veiled terms, that it is 
his policy which will be judged by the French people next year. 
And he is hinting more and more that if this policy succeeds, 
the majority will remain in power, whereas, if it fails, it will 
have to return to the opposition. In this hypothesis, who would 
be in a better position than him to defend "the government's 
policy" before the voters in the presidential election? 
  With regard to the CIP [Job Training Contracts] issue, Mr. 
Balladur, who has been given a rough ride by his political 
friends in the National Assembly, explained on television in the 
evening that the role of a prime minister was not to impose any 
reform, but to ensure that it was understood and adopted by the 
people. "There has been a misunderstanding between some young 
people and the government," he said. On that basis, the crucial 
thing was to find areas of agreement among the French people 
rather than cultivating "pointless divisions." The CIP was 
withdrawn to avoid aggravating this social tension, although the 
prime minister remains convinced that it could enable large 
numbers of young people to find their first job. Other more 
flexible provisions will be adopted to achieve the same goal: 
the reduction in unemployment. 
<H5>  Convincing </H5>
  "My approach, which is primarily to listen, is the right 
one," Mr. Balladur said. "Violence is unacceptable," he added, 
and the demonstrations, in his view, were merely a pretext for 
some people. They are the sign "that we have problems of moral, 
social, and national cohesion to be tackled." But France's 
economy is doing better and these problems should be settled in 
turn. But this does not mean calling into question the 
five-year law on employment, as some deputies are demanding. To 
make progress, Mr. Balladur said, it is necessary to consult, 
explain, and convince. 
  The prime minister is warning the majority but without 
wishing to enter into personal disputes. "I am in the habit of 
never judging the statements of others." But, he added, my task 
has been "the most difficult since the war. Today, things are 
going better. A great deal remains to be done, and we will not 
achieve anything if we spend our time fighting among ourselves."

<F P=106> [Report by Christine Fauvet-Mycia: "Inspired by Cantonal </F>
Election Results, Robert Hue Launches `Strong Initiative'"] 
  [Text] Robert Hue, national secretary of the PCF [French 
Communist Party], wants to open discussions with all the other 
French left-wing parties. Since becoming the PCF leader, Robert 
Hue has shown a desire to promote the emergence of a "new 
political force." The good result achieved in the cantonal 
elections, in which his party secured 11.4 percent of the vote 
in the first round, and the effective tactical move to direct 
votes to the leading left-wing candidate in the second round, 
has given him renewed confidence. This is "urgent," he said on 
Thursday [7 April], addressing the National Committee, when he 
suggested to his party comrades that a "strong initiative" be 
launched with a view to enabling "the popular forces, the 
progressive forces," to build a true "alternative" which would 
respond to the "tremendous appeal" made by the "social movement" 
and "our youth." 
<H5>  `Profound Development' </H5>
  This "strong initiative," the new national PCF secretary 
emphasized, could not be allowed to boil down "as in the past," 
to a mere platform, an alliance at the level of party leaders. 
Robert Hue likes to think of himself as more innovative and 
bold, seeking to "reestablish the links between two things that 
have become disjointed": society and politics. 
  He insists on the need to open discussions with all the 
left-wing parties with a view to coming up with a credible 
alternative. No official invitation has yet been issued, but 
Robert Hue wants to move quickly. His proposals will be debated 
during a National Committee meeting on 6 April. 
  Yesterday, Jean Glavany, spokesman for the PS [Socialist 
Party], reacted very favorably to Hue's proposals. "For several 
weeks," he told LE FIGARO, "this profound development within the 
Communist Party has been noticeable. Between the two [cantonal 
election] rounds, the withdrawals and commitment of votes could 
not have turned out better. Together, we organized several 
meetings and were highly aware of the desire on the part of the 
voters to see us take up the dialogue again." 
  Jean Glavany added: "The PS had already started to proffer 
its hand by organizing meetings on the transformation of 
society. So I can only rejoice at this development. Of course, 
it is not a question of reestablishing the union of the Left and 
adopting the joint platform of 1972. We must look for a new way 
of cooperation." The PS and PCF are working on this, but for 
the time being no meeting has been planned between Rocard and 
Hue.

    [Editorial Report] The 14 March Paris daily LE QUOTIDIEN DE 
PARIS reprinted the results of a SOFRES poll first published in 
the new weekly newsletter SOCIAL ALTEDIA. The poll, which was 
conducted between 3 and 5 March among 1,000 individuals over 18, 
revealed that 69 percent of the respondents believe a serious 
social crisis will occur in France within the next few months. 
Some 44 percent are ready to participate in protest 
demonstrations. While one-fourth of the respondents did not 
believe there would be a crisis and 6 percent had no opinion, 
the proportion of respondents who believed the crisis will occur 
rose to 80 percent among partisans of the Left, to 86 percent 
among adherents of the National Front (FN), to 53 percent among 
partisans of the French Democratic Union (UDF), and to 55 
percent among adherents of the Rally for the Republic (RPR). 
Poll results also highlighted political cleavages, revealing 
that the rate of respondents stating their willingness to 
mobilize reached 59 percent among Communist Party (PC) 
partisans, 27 percent among Socialist Party (PS) sympathizers, 
and 36 percent and 20 percent among Greens party adherents and 
Generation Ecologie partisans respectively. However, only 5 
percent of UDF partisans, 8 percent of UDF adherents and 38 
percent of FN sympathizers stated they would participate in 
protest demonstrations. 
  The poll further showed that if a serious crisis occurred, 
53 
percent of the French would trust Prime Minister Edouard 
Balladur to confront it, compared to 35 percent who would not 
and 11 percent who had no opinion. More generally, 55 percent of 
the respondents believed that the economic and social situation 
is bad, 41 percent that it is fair, and 3 percent that it is 
good.

  [Text] Paris, April 6 (AFP) -- French defence officials 
approved Wednesday [6 April] a military procurement budget for 
the next six years of 613 billion francs (107.5 billion 
dollars), equivalent to a 0.5 percent annual increase in real 
terms. 
  The 1995-2000 budget prepared by the Defence Council, 
chaired 
by President Francois Mitterrand, meant that some projects still 
in the research or development stage might be delayed, a defence 
official said. 
  But programmes relating to the nuclear-powered aircraft 
carrier Charles de Gaulle, the Rafale fighter aircraft and the 
Leclerc tank would be maintained, officials said. Some 
projects however were to be delayed or see their credits 
staggered over time, notably the NH-90 transport helicopter and 
the M5 nuclear ballistic missile. 
  The four-nations NH-90 helicopter, developed jointly with 
Germany, Italy and the Netherlands, is to be maintained though 
its cost will have to be cut by 20 to 30 percent, the officials 
said. 
  In addition to a second nuclear-powered aircraft carrier 
planned for after 1998, the Horizon frigate programme, developed 
jointly with Britain and Italy, could go ahead as early as next 
year. 
  The draft budget is to be approved by parliament early next 
year.

<F P=106> [Report by Olivier Provost: "Arms Exports: Substantial </F>
Drop Likely in 1994"] 
  [Text] French weapons exports totaled 45 billion French 
francs [Fr] in 1993, a figure close to the 1992 record. This 
year, however, the government fears that such exports may fall 
to Fr30 billion. 
  The official figure for French weapons exports in 1993 has 
not been disclosed yet. Reliable sources estimate it to be 
"approximately Fr45 billion." In 1992, Fr50 billion worth of 
French weapons were sold abroad, the best performance since 
1984. Last year's figure includes the Fr21 billion in revenues 
from the sale of 390 Leclerc tanks (GIAT [Industrial Group for 
Ground Wepons] Industries) and 46 tow trucks to the United Arab 
Emirates in February. Another Fr2.8 billion came from the sale 
of 17 Cougar helicopters to the Netherlands and another 20 to 
Turkey [Cougars are made by Eurocopter, which is owned by 
Aerospatiale (70 percent) and DASA [Deutsche Aerospace] (30 
percent)]. A number of smaller contracts made up the balance. 
<H5>  Due to a Number of Diplomatic Choices </H5>
  However, the government takes small comfort in this 
relatively satisfactory performance, as it believes the current 
year may turn out to be a very disappointing one. According to 
an expert, the initial hope of seeing French sales reach the 
Fr60-billion mark by year end has now been superseded by a more 
pessimistic forecast: that of a final figure hovering around an 
abysmal Fr30 billion. This is due to a number of diplomatic 
choices, such as the defense agreement entered into with Israel 
in the midst of the international talks on the occupied 
territories, which is said to have infuriated Arab countries. 
Another such choice is Paris' decision to turn its back to 
Taiwan in the hope of regaining China's favors. 
  To this must be added some rumored commercial blunders on 
the 
part of France, among others the underestimation of competition 
and weak financial arrangements. 
  On 17 November 1993, French Defense Minister Francois 
Leotard 
stated the following in an interview with LA TRIBUNE DESFOSSES: 
"I think we should exceed 1992's figure of Fr50 billion in 1994 
and possibly even in 1995." In early January, Mr. Leotard's 
ministry still saw things in this light. Today, such rather 
overoptimistic hopes have been deflated. In Sweden, the Leclerc 
tank has lost out to Germany's Leopard (Krauss Maffei) in a bid 
for 120 units worth Fr4.3 billion. 
  Matra's Mica missile is in danger of being sidelined by the 
American Amraam missile and British Aerospace's Active Skyflash 
in the race to provide Stockholm with 500 airborne missile worth 
Fr2.8 billion. In Pakistan, as part of a competition for three 
submarines worth Fr3.5 billion, Sweden's Kockums corporation is 
proving a dangerous competitor for France's shipbuilding 
industry. Abu Dhabi still has not bought the 10 or so Mirage 
2000-5 fighter aircraft Dassault thought it would, and Pakistan 
has bought no additional aircraft either. Saudi Arabia may well 
postpone until 1995 payment of all or part of the Fr9 billion 
relating to the three large maintenance contracts it recently 
entered into with France; and it has not yet decided to purchase 
the three French antiaircraft frigates worth Fr20 billion. 
  Last, Taiwan is now keeping its distance [following the 
rapprochement with the PRC], although the island was expected to 
purchase weapon systems worth Fr10 billion for its six 
French-made frigates, as well as 300 armored vehicles made by 
Renault Vehicules Industriels (Fr1.2 billion), and Fr2.5 
billion's worth of Roland missiles (jointly made by Aerospatiale 
and DASA), not to mention another 60 Mirage aircraft in a more 
distant future.

<F P=106> [Editorial by Charles Lambroschini: "The Necessary </F>
Compromise"] 
  [Text] Edouard Balladur's visit to China promises to be 
difficult. On the eve of the prime minister's arrival, the 
arrest in Beijing yesterday of Wei Jingsheng, the most 
well-known dissident, takes on the value of a message. The 
Chinese Government does not intend to allow the Western concept 
of human rights to be imposed on it. But it is equally obvious 
that France cannot remain silent in face of violations of 
freedom. In the dialectic between national interest and respect 
for major principles, compromise is therefore necessary. 
  Edouard Balladur has chosen realism. By negotiating to end 
the dispute over arms sales to Taiwan, he has enabled French 
businesses to reenter the most promising market of the next 
century. The cooling in relations between Paris and Beijing 
made our market share drop to 1.6 percent, whereas Italy climbed 
to 2.6 percent and Germany to 5.8 percent. By departing from 
the line followed by Francois Mitterrand since the bloody 
repression of Tienanmen Square in 1989, the prime minister ran 
the risk of breaking with the rules of cohabitation. But the 
stake was worth it. To cite Alain Juppe, "employment in France 
also depends on Asia." 
  At the same time, the limits which cannot be crossed are 
clear. The French Government would bring dishonor on itself if 
it betrayed the ideal of democracitic countries to pocket a few 
more contracts. When dealing with China, the aim is to change 
not the essence, but the form. Today, the Beijing leaders seem 
ready to make some gestures on human rights, provided they can 
save face. They do not want to be taught any public lessons. 
Edouard Balladur therefore thinks, on this subject, that it 
will be more effective if he negotiates instead of preaching. 
  The United States, despites its privileged position as a 
superpower, is now reaching a similar conclusion. Following the 
disastrous visit to Beijing by his secretary of state last 
month, Bill Clinton is trying to loosen the link between trade 
and human rights. The yearly threat not to renew China's status 
of most favored nation has ceased to be credible. 
  American businesses need outlets badly, too. The White 
House, too, badly needs a partner to help it make North Korea, 
tempted by the bomb, see reason, or to persuade Japan to lower 
its trade barriers. Finally, it is clear that excessively 
vehement protests are likely to have the opposite effect. In 
the struggle for Deng Xiaoping's legacy, the hardliners could 
well take this "interference" as a pretext to take an ever 
tougher line. 
  Thirty years have passed since de Gaulle dared to break the 
anticommunist solidarity to restore diplomatic relations with 
Beijing. However, the motive which justified the general's 
iconoclastic gesture remains the same. In his soldier's 
language, de Gaulle said at the time: "China should not be left 
to stew in its own juice."

  [Text] Following the split between Umberto Bossi and Silvio 
Berlusconi, there is now expectation to see how the proposal of 
the Northern League's deputy-leader will be accepted. Roberto 
Maroni has proposed the idea of a relay-style government. 
  [Begin Maroni recording] We must choose a person who 
understands constitutional techniques, a person who is a strong 
federalist. I am not thinking of Gianfranco Miglio [of the 
Northern League]. I believe that the person we choose should 
not even come from the Northern League. [end recording] 
  [Unidentified correspondent] Following the split, we now 
have 
the re-launch. Faced with an intransigent Berlusconi who has 
resolved to let President Oscar Luigi Scalfaro decide who should 
form the next government, the League has sent out its mediator, 
Roberto Maroni. Maroni has played down the comments of Bossi 
and has put a softer gloss on them. He said that the solution 
to the problem could be handing over the reins of power from a 
government which was first constituent and led by a federalist, 
to one which would then become legislative. Possibly led by 
Silvio Berlusconi. 
  So far there has been no comment from Berlusconi, although 
there has been some from the Northern League itself. It is a 
Northern League deputy from the Veneto region who has criticized 
Bossi. (Rocchetti) called Bossi a Bonapartist. He said that the 
party was losing support and the arguments were damaging the 
party. It is in these agitated waters that (Bassanini) from the 
Party of the Democratic Left is making the first cautious moves. 
He spoke of a possible agreement concerning federal reform.

  [Text] A two-stage government: The first cabinet would be a 
constituent one and would last a few months. The prime minister 
-- not necessarily from the [Northern] League -- would have to 
be a "staunch federalist." He would chair a governmental 
committee which would submit to parliament a bill for a new 
constitution. The second period would be political. The 
government would last five years altogether. This is the 
League's latest proposal to overcome the impasse. It was made 
by Roberto Maroni. 
  Before that, the speakers of both chambers must be elected. 
The League has asked to meet Forza Italia, the National 
Alliance, the Christian Democratic Center, and the Lista 
Pannella on Monday [11 April].

<F P=106> [Interview with National Alliance leader Gianfranco Fini by </F>
Mino Fuccillo in Rome; date not given: "Bossi Is Playing 
Occhetto's Game" -- first paragraph is LA REPUBBLICA 
introduction] 
  [Text] "And then we threaten to hold new elections....": 
The sentence passes along the telephone line between Milan and 
Rome and unites [Forza Italia leader] Berlusconi and [National 
Alliance leader] Fini. The two men have reached an agreement, 
and together have decided to run the risk. They will say to 
[Northern League Secretary] Bossi that they are ready to win 
back his votes, votes that Bossi is using to sabotage the united 
right-wing government. They are walking on a razor's edge 
because a dividing Right that is unable to govern and returns 
Italy to the polls is an ugly sight, and is a Right that is 
taking on water. The only way, however, to deal with the real 
"traitor" is today to use the stick, or at least brandish it. 
The two men understood each other, and shortly afterwards 
Berlusconi publicly broke off negotiations with the League, 
while Fini announced: "It is a good thing. If Bossi does not 
agree to enter government he will have to answer to the 
electorate." 
  [Fuccillo] Are you serious, Deputy Fini, or are these just 
words? 
  [Fini] If our government is to be born, it must be a true 
government, and one that lasts a long time and that is not being 
blackmailed. Otherwise it would be better if it were not born 
at all. I do not want a government which Bossi can oust the 
first time it does something that he does not like, such as, 
perhaps, the first law that grants aid to the south. As things 
stand today, Bossi is giving no guarantees in this respect. 
  [Fuccillo] Does Berlusconi agree? 
  [Fini] Berlusconi is concerned and I am angry. There are two 
reasons for this, the same reasons. Bossi has spoken of a 
danger for democracy if Berlusconi became prime minister. Not 
even Achille Occhetto [secretary of the Democratic Party of 
the Left, PDS] has put it quite as frankly. I expect that 
Occhetto will be sending Bossi a bottle of champagne for the 
favor he has done him. There is something even worse, however. 
Bossi says that he made an electoral pact to then cast off his 
allies. He could do the same thing tomorrow with an agreement 
on forming a government. In the light of this, even new 
elections are preferable. 
  [Fuccillo] So we will again vote to obtain what? 
  [Fini] The League would disappear. The electorate that 
yesterday gave the majority to the Right was quite able to vote 
for a three-way government, with Forza Italia, the National 
Alliance, and the League. Tomorrow, it will know full well who 
is to blame for the lost months and who should be punished. 
  [Fuccillo] It would, however, present a sorry picture of the 
Right to the country, and it would justify what Occhetto said 
when he spoke of "an agreement between bands" for winning power 
without any agreement on how to govern Italy. 
  [Fini] Occhetto should instead be careful not to commit 
political suicide by playing Bossi's game. He should send him 
his bottle of champagne and stop there. 
  [Fuccillo] Speroni of the League has given you a kind of 
ultimatum of 24 hours to say yes to the federalists or there 
will be no government. 
  [Fini] Speroni does not count for anything. These are 
scarcely serious threats. Anyway, to what should we be saying 
yes or no? 
  [Fuccillo] Federalism. 
  [Fini] If federalism is what the League proposed in the 
bicameral committee, then they already have their answer -- a 
resounding no. If federalism means that the wealthy regions 
hold on to their money and do not give a damn about anything 
else, the answer is no and again no. National unity is not just 
about a tricolored flag, and solidarity does not mean charity. 
Lombardy taxes to be spent just on Lombardy? First we must fix 
how much each Italian -- I repeat, Italian -- owes the country. 
Then we can move on to regional autonomy. I hear things that 
make me shudder, such as permanent bargaining between the 
regions and the state. What happens if a region refuses one 
day? Do we send in the Army? I hear things that do not make 
sense, such as putting in writing what the state is entitled to, 
with the rest going to the regions or cantons. This reverses 
the Constitution which, quite rightly, stipulates the opposite 
by listing what the regions are entitled to, with the rest going 
to the state. In short, the Constitution is not a mixed bag. 
It must keep the state on its feet and not encourage 
dissolution. 
  [Fuccillo] That is one of Bossi's sayings. 
  [Fini] As long as he understands that parliament implements 
institutional reforms, and they cannot be used as blackmail. As 
long as he understands that the electorate has given him a 
mandate to govern, and not for anything else. As long as he 
realizes that there are other and more important things to do, 
like getting the economy moving again and not wasting this 
opportunity for leaving the crisis. 
  [Fuccillo] Tell the truth: You and Berlusconi are counting 
on the fact that, if Bossi goes, many of his deputies will drop 
him to remain in government. 
  [Fini] That could also happen, but it would not be enough to 
form a government. Where would Bossi go? Would he go into 
government with the Left that approves of his federalism? Would 
the Left, out of loathing for Berlusconi, accept to commit 
political suicide by forming a government against the will of 
the electorate? The figures say that the only possible 
government is a government of the Right, otherwise we will vote 
again. 
  [Fuccillo] But what does Bossi want: to keep Berlusconi out 
of the prime minister's residence? Or to keep you out of the 
government? 
  [Fini] I think that he just wants his federalism, which 
means 
what is written in the Fontida [League rally venue] manifesto: 
"Immediate federalism or a split." They want federalism in the 
ministries. Then the rest is clear, with Bossi's intended short 
circuit -- a subversive movement in a government that has gone 
sour. 
  [Fuccillo] You, on the other hand, remain absolutely 
indifferent. Bossi is indignant because Letta, a manager of 
[Berlusconi's company] Fininvest is participating in the 
negotiations for government. You appear unruffled by this. 
Speroni says that Berlusconi is dealing with everything as if 
it were the board of directors of his company. Is the League 
lying, or is it fine with you to play housemaid just to be part 
of the government? 
  [Fini] If I was itching to get into government, I would not 
have said anything, not even to Bossi. I have seen Berlusconi 
and heard what he has to say. The initial problem was and still 
is Bossi. Then, if and when people start to talk about 
government programs, my job will begin. 
  [Fuccillo] Come on now, deputy, everything that Forza Italia 
says is fine with you. 
  [Fini] Look, I know I do not want to hear people talk about 
inflation, how it punishes the poor. I have never seen a 
wealthy man who was afraid of inflation, and I have never seen a 
family living on one and a half million a month surviving 
inflation. I do not want to hear the national institute of 
social security talking about dismantling. Pensions are just 
different types of salaries, not handouts. I do not want to 
hear [League ideologue] Miglio talking about cutting jobs in the 
public administration. What does he want to do, privatize the 
state? I say, on the other hand, that we must separate social 
security from aid. I say that not everything that is public is 
wasteful and not everything that is private is wonderful. I say 
that a citizen has the right to choose his pension and private 
insurance plans, but that the state must also consider those who 
cannot choose. 
  [Fuccillo] So you curse the Forza Italia liberals? 
  [Fini] Let them curse me, we will see if they too curse at 
the negotiating table when I am there. I will not accept the 
dog-eat-dog attitude. 
  [Fuccillo] Not even to bring the heirs of fascism into 
government after half a century in the wilderness, as you call 
it? On this subject, what effect does the phrase "the fascists 
in government" have on you? 
  [Fini] No effect at all, and no feeling of revenge. It is 
simply an effect of democracy as the sole and irreplaceable 
principle. It is entering the government, it is not seizing 
power. That is the rule of democracy. Anyway, there is no 
continuous link between the AN and the fascist party. 
  [Fuccillo] So what you said about Mussolini being a great 
statesman was a slip? 
  [Fini] It was not a political judgment nor was it an 
historical judgment. It is not a political program, nor is it a 
sentence. I know I am being constantly watched from that point 
of view, but I would like to be judged on real actions. 
  [Fuccillo] Will you not feel that you have revenge, if only 
historical revenge, by sending one of your men to the 
celebrations of the liberation of Rome? 
  [Fini] If I were to feel that kind of thing I would think 
less of myself. 
  [Fuccillo] I will read to you the words of an AN deputy: 
"Coca Cola and theft are products of American culture. Enough 
of facetious interpretations, the boys who fought for the social 
republic did so because they did not want to endorse those who 
had gone back on agreements. They did so for the love of their 
country." The speaker is Rositani, and tomorrow he will be 
supervising the RAI [state broadcasting company]. Is this not 
the revenge of fascism? 
  [Fini] These are empty, foolish words. Rositani is not a 
silly man and therefore I prefer to think that the journalist 
who reported it was distracted or confused. 
  [Fuccillo] What about people like [movie director] 
Zeffirelli 
who announce: "A clean sweep of the `reds' who have fought over 
the pope?" 
  [Fini] Imagine what a waste of time it would be to go into 
government just to fire someone. I would like to bring an end 
to this silly talk of cleansing, fascists, etc. I would like to 
discuss and debate with the Left the telecommunications system 
or high-speed networks. I would like to work hard at giving 
this country a government, not work up a sweat running along 
behind Bossi's mistakes. I am not looking for nor am I dreaming 
of revenge over history. I want the government that the 
electorate asked for. And if one election is not enough, then we 
will have to have two.

<F P=106> [Interview with Italian Northern League Secretary Umberto </F>
Bossi by Guido Passalacqua, "on the road between Ponte di Legno 
and Gemonio," on 5 April: "Berluskaiser? He is Much Too 
Nervous To Go to Palazzo Chigi; I Am Starting Consultations" -- 
first paragraph is LA REPUBBLICA introduction] 
  [Text] Milan -- How are things going, Senator Bossi? 
"Fine, thank you, things are always just fine with me." League 
leader Umberto Bossi was returning by car to Gemonio, having 
spent a four day vacation in Ponte di Legno. While on the road, 
the news came through: [Forza Italia leader] Berlusconi was 
breaking off the negotiations with the League. On Monday [4 
April], Bossi had sent him a devastating broadside, calling him 
"Napoleon," branding him as an "autocrat," considering him "a 
danger to democracy," and reviving, for the occasion, an old 
nickname used in the election campaign: "Berluskaiser." 
  [Passalacqua] Senator Bossi, what do you think of 
Berlusconi's announcement that he is breaking off the talks? 
  [Bossi] Well, it is probably a nervous fit, which is even 
more untimely considering that he is proposing himself as the 
new prime minister. 
  [Passalacqua] But you have been attacking him since the 
beginning of the election campaign. 
  [Bossi] Why is Berlusconi breaking off? Over the condition 
that he was setting, namely, that of being the boss. So, in 
turn, I put forward the condition of the ethical question. We 
must put a stop to partyocracy, which was a medley of politics 
and civil society, a medley of deals. Berlusconi, however, 
would carry out this medley in the first person. What sort of 
change for the country could someone like him represent, someone 
who every day must choose between his own business and public 
business? 
  [Passalacqua] An ethical condition -- to what extent? 
  [Bossi] We cannot give in. So it is useless for Berlusconi 
to indulge in nervous fits, because the country will then 
understand that we are facing something very different, namely, 
an autocrat's discourse, as we have been saying for some time -- 
the leader of a virtual party, who sets his own personal power 
as a condition. 
  [Passalacqua] So you will stand firm by this? 
  [Bossi] The League, which is a force of the people, will not 
betray the people, will not allow that sort of mechanism to 
exist. The League will not allow the partyocracy to survive, to 
stand on its feet in the form of a medley in the person of the 
prime minister. In the end, we will manage to form a 
government, but let it be clear that a great change must take 
place. 
  [Passalacqua] Will you really go to Rome tomorrow (today, 
for 
our readers -- LA REPUBBLICA editor's note) in order to start 
negotiations with the other parties? 
  [Bossi] Of course. I will be going to Rome and opening the 
consultations. 
  [Passalacqua] Berlusconi has said that he is waiting for a 
mandate from the president of the republic to form the new 
government..Otherwise new elections will have to be held. 
  [Bossi] Berlusconi can say anything he likes, but the real 
problem is in fact holding new elections. Is he mentioning "new 
elections?" Very well then, anybody reasoning that way is 
showing that he is very undemocratic. 
  [Passalacqua] Why? 
  [Bossi] You see, he is saying "either me or new elections." 
  [Passalacqua] Why should this not be the case? 
  [Bossi] We will hold new elections, but with new rules, with 
genuinely democratic rules, so as to prevent his scores of TV 
networks and newspapers from brainwashing people. And we will 
hold the elections with real rules, unlike those ratified in the 
latest round. Enough with manipulating voters, enough with 
manipulating public opinion! 
  [Passalacqua] In short, you would agree to a new electoral 
contest, but only if the rules of the game are changed? 
  [Bossi] Of course, but with genuine rules. Only then will I 
agree. It will be up to Berlusconi, however, to assume 
responsibility for that sort of thing. But the real problem, in 
my view, is a different one. 
  [Passalacqua] What, then, is the crux of the matter? 
  [Bossi] He is threatening us with new elections in order to 
make us give up the fundamental principles on which the League 
is based and which the country needs: Enough with partyocracy, 
with the intermingling between politics and business, 
particularly in the person of the prime minister! I will not 
give in on this point. Furthermore, there is the federalist 
prerequisite, which aims to give citizens institutions enabling 
them to control those who are engaged in politics. These are 
the conditions that Berlusconi must face up to. If he opts for 
elections, the country will reply in the polling booths... 
  [Passalacqua] What will happen now? 
  [Bossi] Nothing. 
  [Passalacqua] How do you mean, nothing? 
  [Bossi] Negotiations will proceed in any case, what do you 
think should happen? 
  [Passalacqua] But are negotiations with Forza Italia 
suspended or not? 
  [Bossi] Negotiations are being started elsewhere. 
  [Passalacqua] What about Berlusconi? 
  [Bossi] If he thinks that the country is his seat or his 
kingdom, he is reading the wrong page. Italy is not 
Berluskaiser's kingdom. Someone who sets his own personal power 
as a condition has a few problems grasping a concept which in my 
book is called democracy. 
  [Passalacqua] Are you satisfied with your results? 
  [Bossi] Please do not ask this sort of question. I believe 
that the people constitute a steadfast force. What sort of 
picture of Berlusconi emerges in the end? That of someone who 
has lost his temper. But can someone who wants to become prime 
minister lose his temper because we have stopped him by setting 
such crucial conditions? I believe Berlusconi is digging his 
own grave. In short, we can say "no" to Berlusconi because he 
is a profiteer. And a profiteer cannot become prime minister.

<F P=106> [Unattributed interview with Cesare Previti, Forza Italia's </F>
"number-two" man, in Rome on 5 April: "Previti Warns: `If He 
Betrays Us, He Will Be Punished'" -- first paragraph is LA 
REPUBBLICA introduction] 
  [Text] Rome -- "Afraid? Of whom? We can go back to the 
polls, hold new elections in no time. And then we will have a 
good laugh. The truth is that [Northern League Secretary] Bossi 
is a haywire splinter, with certain irrational traits. He has 
not understood the turn that things have taken since the 
elections. There are no more blank-check delegations. There is 
an agreement that we must honor. He reminds me of those 
characters of the past, those of the First Republic. Do you 
remember that guy who wanted to have a free hand at all costs?" 
We were watching the TG3 [third channel TV news] 7 o'clock news 
in the office of Roman lawyer Cesare Previti, Forza Italia's 
number two. We were watching a news show displaying in turn the 
faces of the "pole of freedoms," now the "squabble pole," 
triumvirate. Faces, such as [Forza Italia leader] Silvio 
Berlusconi's and [National Alliance leader] Gianfranco Fini's, 
which showed rage and tension. Tense faces, uttering icy words 
addressed to the odd man who has turned the tables on them and 
may end up giving their opponents a present. Bossi, instead, was 
shown wearing a windbreaker, smiling. Previti then broke out: 
"He will be the only one to blame if in the end everything 
collapses. If this guy betrays the alliance, the only solution 
will be to go back to the polls." 
  [LA REPUBBLICA] Everything seemed to be ready: a government, 
a platform, a majority. From [Fiat director] Agnelli to 
[Communist Renewal Secretary] Bertinotti, everybody wanted 
Berlusconi at Palazzo Chigi [prime minister's office]. 
  [Previti] Speaking of Bertinotti, let me say that I found 
him 
a rather interesting person. Following Costanzo's election 
show, I got better acquainted with him, he was quite pleasant. 
  [LA REPUBBLICA] Were you expecting the League's wrath? What 
unleashed it? 
  [Previti] Who knows, it is difficult to say. There are no 
apparent facts or definite causes. Perhaps Bossi felt crushed 
by Forza Italia, by our electoral lists' enormous success, 
although, as a matter of fact, we had already witnessed some 
outbursts toward the end of the election campaign. However, the 
Senator [Bossi nickname] would be well advised not to indulge in 
outbursts, considering the 28 March election results. 
  [LA REPUBBLICA] Is this a threat? 
  [Previti] No, it is an argument based on readily available 
data and figures. In Milan, in the proportional round, Forza 
Italia defeated the League. And in Bossi's own constituency, we 
won a relative majority. All this explains why the League's 
leader is so jittery. He knows that his deputies' positions are 
rather precarious. 
  [LA REPUBBLICA] Precarious? Does this mean that they will 
soon go over to Forza Italia? 
  [Previti] No, I am not saying this. I am saying that, if we 
went back to the polls immediately, those deputies and senators 
would have to approach us in order to be reelected (may I remind 
you that, in the north, Fini had presented his own lists, and 
our agreement with the League was a fully-fledged electoral 
agreement). 
  [LA REPUBBLICA] One-third of the pole of freedoms is still 
in 
Bossi's hands, for the moment. How will you manage to win them 
over? 
  [LA REPUBBLICA] We were straightforward. We enabled the 
League's candidates to win votes, without arguing, and with no 
hidden aims. I wonder whether all the League members that have 
been elected are now backing Bossi, whether they wish to follow 
him into this adventure. I believe that many of them feel 
betrayed. We had asked for votes in order to govern, and we are 
now bogged down in these tactical stratagems, these games that 
reek of the old system. The country is waiting for a 
government, a guide. May I remind them, moreover, that they are 
largely answerable to Forza Italia's voters. Voters who opted 
for a more transparent policy: The winners govern the country. 
I have remarked that, even among the ranks of the defeated, 
this clarity, guaranteed by the new rules, is considered a 
positive innovation. 
  [LA REPUBBLICA] In short, for you Bossi is a traitor. Did 
you expect him to be one? Do you know him well? 
  [Previti] Not at all. I barely met him once, in Arcore 
[Berlusconi residence], when I still had no thought of entering 
into politics. However, I did become personally acquainted with 
Senate floor leader Francesco Speroni, last Sunday. We were in 
Silvio's gym, watching the soccer game on short-wave TV. I 
supported Lazio, and Speroni the Milan team. Gosh, he was 
wearing a buckle with a bull on it, with an inscription saying 
he has got what it takes, a leather tie.... 
  [LA REPUBBLICA] What is Berlusconi's opinion of Bossi? 
  [Previti] He also only met him by chance. Bossi always sends 
forth Maroni [League lower house floor leader], Formentini, 
Speroni. However, the League leader is warned. He has stumbled 
on a hard stone. Berlusconi is sailing full steam ahead. We 
are straightforward people, who have taken up straightforward 
commitments with the Italian people. We are in a position to 
submit a government plan and a platform by 15 April. If things 
do not develop smoothly, we will know whom to blame. Two months 
from now, in the European elections... 
  [LA REPUBBLICA] What will happen then? 
  [Previti] We will go to the polls in a free-for-all fashion 
and we will see who wins. Everything will be clearer then. 
Forza Italia will become a major party, a new count will have 
to be made. And you will see how the League will cool down, boy, 
will they cool down. 
  [LA REPUBBLICA] Bossi says you are a nonexistent party. 
  [Previti] And it will never exist in a traditional way, for 
that matter. We are not the sort of guys who go to Pontida 
[League rally venue], to have their hands kissed by the insane. 
  [LA REPUBBLICA] Speaking of Pontida, next Sunday [10 April] 
Bossi will be raising the devil there. 
  [Previti] I would advise him not to overdo things, not to 
carry things too far. He might be signing his own death 
sentence.

<F P=106> [Interview with Northern League ideologue Gianfranco Miglio </F>
by correspondent "P.C." in Milan; date not given: "`In Three 
Years We Will Revolutionize Everything'"] 
  [Text] Milan -- [Correspondent] Professor Miglio, you say 
that with 50 plus one percent of parliamentarians, you can delve 
into Article 138 of the Constitution and modify it. But how 
many articles will you end up modifying after that? 
  [Miglio] Quite a few. Indeed I believe that by 1997 or 1998 
we will have a totally new Constitution. Or at least it will be 
set right on other issues as well, ones which are not currently 
under discussion like basic rights. The basis for this change 
lies in holding the majority, and that majority now exists. 
  [Correspondent] The program it all hinges on is federalism. 
Your project provides for the majority of power in public 
administration to be handed over to the so-called macroregions. 
Can you explain how? 
  [Miglio] I would be inclined to go along with what the 
Bicameral Reform Commission established, namely: Only a few 
areas of jurisdiction will remain the province of a central 
authority, which will be called federal. In our view that could 
cover such areas as defense, foreign policy, the currency, 
credit, the higher realms of justice. The balance, which is an 
enormous amount, will be the province of the macroregions, or 
the regions with special statutes. We can do this thanks to 
Article 138, which opens up a breach in the Constitution. You 
must recall that the only thing we cannot do is enshrined in 
Article 139: "The nation's republican status cannot be subject 
to constitutional reform." So even those who wrote the 
Constitution intended everything else to be possible. 
  [Correspondent] Possible in what way? 
  [Miglio] The first package of reforms, which is what I think 
people are talking about, will take about 90 days. It concerns 
the major bodies, the major power centers: the government, 
parliament, the president of the republic. These will all be 
changed and we will be able to have a state that works. Then 
further work will be needed, a few years, I believe, to change 
other institutions like the Higher Council of the Magistracy, or 
the role of the Constitutional Court. 
  [Correspondent] So you see continuous change?. 
  [Miglio] Yes, we are living through an ongoing constituent 
phase. I have always maintained that change cannot be 
implemented in one fell swoop. To change the setup in the major 
centers of power will take this 90 day period followed, in 
accordance with Article 138 in the Constitution, by two further 
deliberations in the Chamber of Deputies and the Senate, with an 
interval of no less than three months between. Let's say about 
six months to prepare the groundwork for the big change. A 
number of adjustments will follow. For example, the three 
cantons which I have proposed are groupings based on existing 
regions. We may need to hold referenda, because certain regions 
or provinces may prefer to join one canton rather than another. 
Take Umbria, for instance. It is already split; whom will it 
want to go with? The citizens will be the ones to decide. 
  [Correspondent] You mentioned modifying some inviolable 
rights... 
  [Miglio] Yes, by which I mean that those articles of the 
Constitution which have caused nothing but trouble must be 
changed. For example, I am not so sure punishment should aim to 
re-educate the guilty. When it is objectively obvious that a 
person cannot be re-educated, that he is a habitual delinquent, 
then there is no point in thinking in terms of re-education. I 
would like to stress that this is a personal opinion of mine. 
  [Correspondent] So, in your view, modifications of that 
nature are easy to implement? 
  [Miglio] Absolutely, and I would like to point out that all 
we need is 50 plus one percent of parliamentarians to change the 
Constitution. But to make the great leap over to federalism we 
will be calling a popular referendum. There will be a great 
battle for the future. I believe public opinion will support 
this majority; persuasion to cooperate will emerge [as 
published].

  [Text] A new party will be set up in the political center. 
The New National Center [Uusi Kansallinen Keskusta], UKK, 
intends to contest the next Diet elections with full candidate 
lists in all election districts. UKK calls for the 
implementation of a policy independent of European Union 
legislation and the pursuit of an independent foreign and 
security policy based on neutrality and the Finnish desire to 
defend the country. 
  The chairman of the temporary board which is preparing for 
the registration of the party is Ilkka Hakalehto from Helsinki. 
Pentti Kettunen, a former Diet deputy of the SMP [Finnish Rural 
Party] from Kajaani, is deputy chairman. Both men also belong 
to the leadership of the Finnish People's Independence Front, 
which opposes membership in the European Union.

<F P=106> [Article by Emily von Sydow: "EU Believes in Finnish WEU </F>
Membership"] 
  [Excerpts] The EU [European Union] believes that Finland 
will join the Western European Union, WEU. The Commission views 
the applicant countries as support for the new foreign and 
security policy, rather than an encumbrance, despite their 
tradition of neutrality. 
  A strong argument voiced against expanding the union, 
expressed by many countries, France for one, was the fact that 
three of the applicants, Finland, Sweden, and Austria, were 
neutral. But the concept of neutrality has been modified since 
the fall of the Berlin wall, and the juxtaposition East-West has 
ceased to be current. 
  "Finland is apt rather to promote a stronger security policy 
than prevent such a development." Sweden's Prime Minister Carl 
Bildt has no objections to joining the WEU. Nor will Ingvar 
Carlsson, the Social Democrats' leader, try to stop such a 
development. During a background briefing on Tuesday [15 March], 
a high official at the Directorate General explained to a group 
of journalists that he did not expect that the applicants would 
create any kind of problem in the area of foreign and security 
policy. 
  "When Finland joins the EU, it will share a 1,200-km-long 
border with Russia. It is up to us to find a formula for 
exporting stability, instead of succumbing to the insecurity 
bacteria from the other side," noted the spokesperson. [passage 
omitted] 
  "If the political willingness is there, then the Council of 
Ministers can react to these proposals," said the official. 
"However, in order for the Commission to make suggestions in 
this field, we must define the common interest," he added. 
  "Currently, it is most important for the WEU to concentrate 
on the standardization of weapons and to direct and monitor the 
implementation of sanctions on the Danube," added the official. 
  At the Directorate General, the view is that the next 
expansion phase will include Poland, Hungary, and the Czech 
Republic. This should take place around the turn of the century, 
with negotiations taking place during the period 1996-98. 
  "The current scenario is that these three countries will be 
part of the expansion. Other countries are currently lagging too 
far behind," the official concluded.

<F P=106> [Article by Bjarne Nitovuori: "Finland's Security Policy: No </F>
Problems in United Europe"] 
  [Text] From a security policy aspect, membership in the 
European Union [EU] would be without problems for Finland, if 
Europe becomes integrated and the old bifurcation does not 
recur. 
  But if Europe again splits into two blocs, as intimated by 
the conflicts in East Europe, the setbacks suffered by the 
reformists in Russia, and the signs of an emergence of a Russian 
nationalistic foreign policy, then it will become difficult for 
Finland to combine an EU membership with military nonalliance. 
  This is the conclusion reached in a study conducted by the 
Institute of International Affairs regarding the consequences EU 
membership would have on Finland's foreign and security 
policies. The study was prepared by researcher Jukka Salovaara. 
  The study also emphasizes the fact that the ramifications of 
an EU membership are dependent on whether Finland also makes a 
military commitment, and on the direction Europe's development 
takes. 
<H5>  New Possibilities </H5>
  As a member of the EU, Finland must commit itself to a 
common 
foreign and security policy, but the common policy only applies 
to issues and activities regarding which there is consensus, 
notes Salovaara. This commitment is counterweighted by new 
possibilities opening for Finland's foreign policy. 
  As far as the possibilities to affect the common policy of 
the EU are concerned, Salovaara makes a division into three 
categories. 
  First of all, there are areas where policies conducted by 
the 
EU are well established, and where Finland must increase its 
expertise, in order to exert any influence. This applies, 
primarily, to the Middle East policy, but pertains also to 
policies regarding CSCE and the UN. 
  In regard to the CSCE policy, there are no major differences 
between Finland and the EU countries, nor as far as policies 
toward the UN are concerned, remarks Salovaara. He notes 
however, that, for example, as far as South Africa is concerned, 
Denmark, in spite of its EC membership, has been able together 
with the other Nordic Countries to take another tack than the EC 
countries, and that Nordic cooperation in regard to UN policy 
could also be conceivable in the future. 
  Secondly, there are areas where the policy conducted by the 
EU will get a different emphasis, such as, for example, the 
policy toward Russia and East Europe. EU membership would give 
Finland's policy toward Russia new dimensions. Thirdly, 
Salovaara believes that Finland, as an EU member, can add a new 
Nordic dimension to foreign policy conducted by the Union. That 
could lead to increased EU interest in the areas on Finland's 
eastern border. Finland is unable by itself to solve the 
problems afflicting these areas. 
  If Finland were to stay outside the EU, and Norway and 
Sweden 
also did so, then cooperation among the Nordic Countries could 
be developed. If Sweden and Norway join the EU, but Finland does 
not, then the relationship with Russia becomes more important. 
The difference compared to the Cold War era would be that West 
Europe's outer border would pass between Sweden and Finland. The 
study notes, that this would make Nordic cooperation, in its 
current form, difficult. 
  As far as defense solutions are concerned, Salovaara 
presents 
four different options, depending on whether Finland joins or 
does not join the EU, and depending on whether Finland joins the 
military alliance or not. 
  If Finland does not become a member, neutrality becomes the 
most likely option. If Sweden also does not become a member, a 
defense alliance with Sweden could be a possibility. Based on 
the geopolitical status of the countries and historical 
experiences, Salovaara deems this improbable. 
  The fact that the relationship with Russia could become of 
central importance, is based, among other things, on the 
realization that Finland lately has come to assume greater 
military strategic importance for Russia. This has resulted from 
the partial retreat of the Russian Baltic fleet to St. 
Petersburg, and because the Kola Peninsula is assuming greater 
importance than previously in Russian strategy. 
  As an EU member, Finland may still be militarily nonaligned 
and have an independent defense. However, the Maastricht treaty 
includes a statement regarding the goal of establishing a common 
defense policy, which in time may lead to a common defense. 
  The study conducted by the Institute of International 
Affairs 
does not, however, provide an answer to the question of what the 
ramifications of a common defense policy are. Salovaara believes 
that no far-reaching decisions will be able to be made by the 
government conference in 1995. 
  He assumes, however, that the EU will have some expectations 
of Finland, after it has joined, primarily because the Union 
then would have a long common border with Russia. 
  The study regarding foreign and security policies is one of 
the studies that yesterday were presented in regard to the 
consequences of Finland joining the EU or remaining outside. 
Another study pertained to regional policies, and was prepared 
by Hannu Tervo, Hannu Niittykangas, and Tuomo Nenonen from the 
Economic Research Center of Central Finland . 
  During yesterday's presentation ceremony, Nenonen noted that 
integration, in general, should provide an economic growth 
impulse for the economy as a whole. Regional distribution is 
not, however, expected to change from the impact of the EEA 
[European Economic Area] treaty. On the other hand, the 
assumption is that the EU will provide a stronger economic 
growth impulse that the EEA did. 
  Competition will become tougher, which will cause problems 
for the weaker regions. However, in the long run, the endeavors 
of local businesses and the regions' own efforts will be of 
decisive importance, noted Nenonen.

<F P=106> [Unattributed article: "Eastern Border Security More </F>
Important"] 
  [Excerpts] The National Bureau of Customs wants to start 
x-raying big rigs at the border crossing at Vaalimaa in order to 
make smuggling between Finland and Russia more difficult. 
Customs suggests that the state appropriate 60 million markkas 
in this year's budget. 
  The X-ray equipment would be used starting in 1998. [passage 
omitted] 
  The Bureau noted that Finnish Customs is prepared to 
implement the changes required by EU [European Union] 
membership. The geographical location of Finland is such that 
customs inspections must be maintained at most international 
airports and in most ports, even when Finland joins the EU. 
  "Guarding the eastern border becomes even more important 
than 
it previously was," noted Customs Director Juha Niskanen. 
  This year, Customs has not found any radioactive or other 
dangerous substances. In spite of that fact, the Customs Service 
is convinced that dangerous substances have been smuggled across 
the border from Russia and the Baltic states.

<F P=106> [Editorial: "`No' Kings?"] </F>
  [Text] Following her indisputable election success of last 
year, Center Party leader Anne Enger Lahnstein has been 
unofficially crowned "no" queen in the fight against Norwegian 
EU [European Union] membership. She may decline this sort of 
compliment, but we cannot conceal the fact that this is a role 
she fills a lot better than the yes side might have had reason 
to hope. Far from excluding those not connected with the 
farming sector, she has in fact served as a political magnet for 
groups far removed from it. 
  Therefore, we raise an eyebrow or two at the concern now 
voiced by Kjell Magne Bondevik, the Christian People's Party 
leader, and Erik Solheim, his counterpart in the Socialist Left 
Party. They say they fear Lahnstein's dominant position will 
weaken the good cause since there will not be a no majority [in 
the referendum] if the farmers are the only ones wanting to keep 
Norway out of the EU. Without a trace of the modesty so 
strongly warranted in this situation, they say that the no side 
would be better off if the two of them were allowed center 
stage. 
  The two party leaders have chosen a strange way to express 
this concern. Their method speaks less of shrewdness than of PR 
hunger. Of course it is no fun to remain in the shadows when 
the sun is bathing another leader in its light. Messrs. 
Bondevik and Solheim do, however, have a chance of getting a 
place in the warm, desirable light of politics. They can 
accomplish this by quitting their worrying and whining and 
instead use a little energy to develop some thoughts on where a 
Norway outside the EU will stand globally and in the Nordic 
context. We are all most interested in this question that 
appears to be quite the intellectual challenge for the two of 
them.

  [Text] Prime Minister Hakki Atun has called on the Greek 
Cypriot administration to return to the negotiating table and 
put an end to its policy of enmity. Atun noted that, as 
stressed by the UN secretary general in his report, the 
negotiations should be continued with patience for the problems 
to be solved. He added that the Greek Cypriots should respond 
in kind to the goodwill shown by the Turkish Cypriots, regarding 
the confidence-building measures [CBM's]. 
  Assessing the report submitted by UN Secretary General 
Butrus-Ghali to the Security Council, Atun said that certain 
points in the report displayed a realistic approach while others 
manifested an unacceptable one. He described as a realistic 
approach the inclusion of the Turkish Cypriot concerns and the 
pronouncement that the negotiations will continue despite Greek 
Cypriot announcements to the contrary. Atun added, however, 
that accepting the "nondocument" of 21 March as a basis despite 
all the Turkish Cypriot warnings and objections is unacceptable. 
He stated that the United Nations should renounce this 
erroneous stand which encourages the rigid and intransigent 
attitude of the Greek Cypriot side, which actually never 
accepted the CBM's, and which enables it to run away from the 
negotiating table. Pointing out that the United Nations should 
quit insisting that the "nondocument", which tears the CBM's 
apart, be the basis of an agreement, Atun further asked the 
United Nations to take into consideration the hostile activities 
of the Greek Cypriot administration, which exacerbate the lack 
of trust between the two communities, its armament efforts, 
provocations, and negative statements regarding the CBM's. He 
said that excluding from the report negative stands that 
contradict the spirit of the CBM's was a deficiency. Atun 
further stressed that the Turkish Cypriot side is insistent on 
continuing the talks and remaining at the negotiating table 
despite all these facts.

  [Text] With a unanimous decision, the National Council has 
called on the UN Security Council to examine effective 
alternative ways to promote a Cyprus solution based on the 
principles of international law. The National Council position 
is included in a joint statement issued this afternoon following 
the council's two-hour meeting chaired by President Glavkos 
Kliridhis. The president briefed the members of the National 
Council on the latest developments in the Cyprus issue in view 
of the UN secretary general's report on the direction of the 
proximity talks. 
  The joint statement notes that the National Council wants to 
express its displeasure and disappointment with the Butrus-Ghali 
report to the Security Council. The statement adds that the 
National Council affirmed that the negative Turkish stance and 
lack of political will for a Cyprus solution, which make 
continuation of the dialogue unproductive, were ignored. 
  Replying to a question after the National Council meeting, 
government spokesman Ioannis Kasoulidhis said that President 
Kliridhis will decide how to handle the issue when such a 
decision becomes necessary. Asked what President Kliridhis will 
do by the end of April and whether he will receive the UN 
secretary general's representatives to continue the proximity 
talks, the spokesman referred to the president's statement 
issued yesterday according to which he does not accept 
discussion of new documents or new amendments to the existing 
documents. Referring to the political leadership's trip to 
Athens to coordinate with the Greek Government, an issue raised 
by every political leader at the National Council meeting, the 
spokesman said the government does not object to the visit. He 
added that the time for such a meeting would be decided after 
consultations between the two governments. 
  Reliable information obtained by CyBC [the Cyprus 
Broadcasting Corporation] notes that in the letter he will send 
to the UN secretary general, President Kliridhis stresses that 
he will accept no discussion of any new document or new 
amendments to the latest UN document of 21 March. Kliridhis 
notes that he accepts that document as it is. He emphasizes 
that the Security Council should proceed to examine alternative 
ways to implement its decisions.

<F P=106> ["Text" of exclusive interview with Turkish Cypriot leader </F>
Rauf Denktas by KIBRIS correspondent Basaran Duzgun in Nicosia; 
date not given] 
  [Text] [Duzgun] Mr. President, can you comment on the 
method that will be applied in the talks? 
  [Denktas] It will be the same. They [UN officials] will go 
and come back and the UN secretary general will submit a new 
report at the end of the month. Meanwhile, the contacts will be 
maintained. 
  [Duzgun] Can the fact that a deadline has been established 
be 
regarded as pressure? 
  [Denktas] Yes, it is so. 
  [Duzgun] The UN secretary general's report included a 
statement by Glavkos Kliridhis. He said: "I will agree if 
Denktas agrees." Does the inclusion of that statement in the 
report indicate that the UN secretary general has agreed to it? 
  [Denktas] We have been explaining for a long time that 
Kliridhis' statement should not be taken to mean that the Greek 
Cypriot side has agreed. However, the UN officials have failed 
to realize that. 
  [Duzgun] Can you comment on what may take place in the 
indirect talks when they are resumed? 
  [Denktas] Well, let us wait until the talks are resumed... 
However, let us consider the existence of a document that has 
been accepted by one of the two sides but not by the other. The 
other side has raised objections. Asking the two sides to 
regard that document as a basis for an agreement will be 
tantamount to telling one of them that "you do not have to reach 
an agreement because pressure will be directed toward the 
Turkish Cypriots." That is the wrong approach. Therefore, why 
should the Greek Cypriot side change its position after reading 
the UN secretary general's report? We are confronted with a 
significant problem, which has been created by the UN secretary 
general's report. 
  [Duzgun] Will the documents, which have been described as 
nondocuments, be withdrawn in the new round of talks? 
  [Denktas] Documents are not withdrawn. They form the basis 
of the process. 
  [Duzgun] Considering the fact that the nondocument has been 
included in the UN secretary general's report, has it not become 
an official document? 
  [Denktas] We do not believe that it can be characterized as 
official. Of course, the UN Security Council may decide to 
accept it. However, the UN Security Council cannot close its 
eyes and accept a document over which the two sides have raised 
objections. In fact, it must not do so because nothing can be 
resolved through that approach. 
  [Duzgun] Will pressure be directed toward the Turkish 
Cypriot 
side again? Will that not create a new impasse? 
  [Denktas] They said that they will return to hold talks. We 
have asked for certain rights. Maybe they will move to give a 
tangible form to them. That is the way to hold talks. They are 
well aware of what has caused the deadlock. There is nothing 
concrete. They have only made promises. Let us wait to see 
which countries we will be allowed to visit with our passports. 
The UN administrator cannot assume responsibility for customs. 
That can never be. Let us see if they will exclude that from 
the document. Otherwise, I will not be authorized by the Turkish 
Cypriot Republican Assembly to do anything. The Turkish Cypriot 
side's right to have its own customs procedures cannot be 
transferred to the UN administrator. 
  [Duzgun] Is there a problem with matters related to the 
airline companies that will be allowed to use the Nicosia 
International Airport? 
  [Denktas] They have said that only one airline company will 
be able to use that airport. However, it was said at the 
beginning that the airline companies registered in Turkey would 
be able to use it. Cyprus Airways would not be allowed to use 
that airport. However, we have been informed that it will be 
able to do so. The UN administration cannot tell Cyprus Airways 
not to use this or that flight path. All that means that the 
national airline company of the Greek Cypriot side, which poses 
as the Cyprus Government, will be able to use the Nicosia 
International Airport and the Turkish Cypriots, who have been 
living under an embargo for many years, will be able to benefit 
from a number of rights that will be accorded them by the UN 
administrator out of kindness and pity. What kind of an 
approach is that? Kliridhis said at the beginning that neither 
Cyprus Airways nor any Turkish company registered in Cyprus 
should use that airport. He also said that foreign airline 
companies registered in Turkey will be able to do so. 
Apparently, they have changed that now. 
  [Duzgun] Have you insisted that Cyprus Airways register in 
Athens? 
  [Denktas] They have changed matters related to the use of 
the 
airport. So they should also change that. They should have 
that airline company registered in Athens and then come to talk 
with us under equal conditions. The Greek Cypriot side is 
trying to have what it refers to as the Cyprus Government 
establish a foothold in the Nicosia International Airport. 
  [Duzgun] Can the problem on Maras [Varosha] be solved by 
constructing a new access road? 
  [Denktas] No, a new road will not solve the problem because 
it will have to cross through territory we control. 
  [Duzgun] Can you explain the problem on Maras? 
  [Denktas] We have been informed that we should hand over an 
area as large as Maras itself and withdraw our troops. A UN 
official convinced us to abandon our policy on the northern part 
of Dhimokratias Avenue by assuring us that the access road to 
Maras will remain under our control and that they will not ask 
us to transfer it. 
  [Duzgun] Who convinced you? 
  [Denktas] Butrus Butrus-Ghali. 
  [Duzgun] Was he the official you referred to? 
  [Denktas] Yes, it was Butrus-Ghali. He said: Why are you 
worried about security? You will control the entry and exit 
points. Do not worry. You will not be able to convince anyone. 
  Considering that, we agreed to relinquish our position on 
Dhimokratias Avenue. As soon as we did so, he issued a new 
report and the UN officials began to say that "the transfer of 
Maras will be meaningless if the Turkish Cypriot side retains 
its control of the access road." 
  [Duzgun] A problem has emerged on the customs procedures in 
Nicosia International Airport. Has a similar problem emerged in 
Maras? 
  [Denktas] Of course a problem has emerged on custom 
procedures. A problem has also emerged on the access road to 
Maras. A place was to be given to the Turkish Cypriots. A 
proposal was made for the establishment of something like an 
open market. The UN secretary general has said that he may help 
the Turkish Cypriots in leasing procedures. Well, let him first 
include the promises he made to us in his report. 
  [Duzgun] Can you comment on the public property in Maras? 
  [Denktas] They have said that the property belongs to the 
Cyprus Republic and that the Cyprus Government will resolve that 
matter. That cannot be. 
  [Duzgun] Does a problem exist on deadlines? 
  [Denktas] We were informed that we should place Maras under 
UN jurisdiction two months after the conclusion of an agreement 
on the matter. Nicosia International Airport will be placed 
under UN jurisdiction two months later. However, that will be 
four months after the agreement is reached. The Greek Cypriots 
will resettle in Maras during that time. We will benefit from 
the airport 12 months later. And the way we shall do so is 
unknown. No one will be able to evict the Greek Cypriots from 
Maras if the Greek Cypriot Administration creates discord at the 
end of the 12 months. What will happen to us then? Whether or 
not you benefit from the airport after 12 months makes no 
difference. The promises will not be fulfilled. We have 
proposed that we transfer the northern part of Dhimokratias 
Avenue after we establish ourselves in the airport. We will at 
least have something in our hands.

<F P=106> [Column by Ozer Hatay: "First the Package Was Punctured and </F>
Then the Ball Was Put in Our Court"] 
  [Text] The package on confidence-building measures [CBM's] 
was first punctured in the indirect talks in accordance with the 
Greek Cypriot wishes and then the ball was put in our court. 
Acting in accordance with Greek Cypriot tactics, UN Secretary 
General Butrus Butrus-Ghali and his representatives continue to 
maintain the approach they adopted to place us in a difficult 
position. 
  In his report to the UN Security Council, Butrus-Ghali 
claimed that President Rauf Denktas objected on 21 March to the 
issues that were included in the package of CBM's after it was 
punctured some time ago. Butrus-Ghali's report said that 
Denktas objected to the proposals on the access road to Maras 
[Varosha], Nicosia International Airport's air traffic rights, 
simultaneous and equal advantages for Turkish and Greek 
Cypriots, and collection of custom taxes by UN officials. 
Obviously, the report created the conditions Greek Cypriot 
leader Glavkos Kliridhis needs to maintain his tactics. It will 
be recalled that he has already said he "will agree to the 
document if it is accepted by the Turkish Cypriot side." The 
fact that Butrus-Ghali quoted Glavkos Kliridhis as saying that 
he would accept the UN document if it is accepted by the Turkish 
Cypriot side, that is, the document he conveyed to the two sides 
through his representatives on 21 March, is an indication that 
he wishes to give the Greek Cypriot side's tactics a chance. 
  Obviously, those who have punctured the package of CBM's to 
satisfy the Greek Cypriot side's wishes, regardless of the fact 
that that package was supported by experts, have now put the 
ball in the Turkish Cypriot side's court. This approach will 
neither be the first nor the last.... 
  An effort is being made to change whatever dissatisfies the 
Greek Cypriot side and have the Turkish Cypriots agree to new 
elements. Accusing the Turkish Cypriot side of obstructing the 
implementation of the CBM's, when changes are made on matters 
related to Maras and the Nicosia International Airport in 
accordance with the Greek Cypriot side's wishes, can only be 
described as an unrealistic approach that is aimed at allowing 
the Greek Cypriot side to maintain its two-faced policy. 
  UN officials have succeeded in persuading the two sides in 
Cyprus to agree in principle to hold talks on the package of 
CBM's. However, they then moved to puncture that package and 
force the Turkish Cypriots to agree to the changes they made in 
accordance with Greek Cypriot demands. 
  Meanwhile, considering the fact that the Greek Cypriot side 
stands to gain from the changes and additions, which will 
definitely undermine the spirit of the CBM's, the Greek Cypriot 
Administration has disclosed that it "will agree to the document 
if it is accepted by the Turkish Cypriot side." Obviously, this 
is a tactic aimed at accusing the Turkish Cypriot side of 
maintaining an irreconcilable approach. 
  Apparently, the point we have reached has confirmed that 
suggestions made by certain individuals among the Turkish 
Cypriot people to the effect that "the game must be played 
wisely" have been useless. The outcome has been as expected. 
We have been blamed for the deadlock again. 
  Obviously, the objective was to place the Turkish Cypriot 
side in a difficult position.... Regardless of whatever we do, 
we shall continue to be blamed as long as we refuse to approach 
the Greek Cypriot side's position. Meanwhile, the UN officials 
will continue to create advantages for the Greek Cypriot side. 
  The United States must be careful not to be misled by these 
tactics.

  [Text] Foreign Minister Karolos Papoulias today expressed 
the hope that the road to normalizing relations between Athens 
and Skopje [The Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia--FYROM] 
would open but stressed that it is risky to seek a timeframe for 
achieving a solution. Papoulias said the time available for 
reaching a solution is diminishing, and the delay, due to 
Skopje's continuing intransigence, benefits no one. The foreign 
minister did not rule out meeting with UN mediator Cyrus Vance 
in New York, not next Monday, but later within the framework of 
Prime Minister Andreas Papandreou's visit to the United States. 
In the talks Vance will hold next Monday [11 April], Greece 
will be represented by Ambassador Khristos Zakharakis, director 
general of the Foreign Ministry. 
  In his statement, the foreign minister also referred to 
Greek-Albanian relations, which he described as good, because 
the Greek side starts from the basic principle that relations 
must be good for the sake of peace and stability in the region. 
Answering a correspondent's questions seeking information on 
the settlement of Albanians in Greek-speaking areas, Papoulias 
said the wrong impressions are being created. He added that the 
Greek Government follows any move by the Albanian side 
carefully, especially with regard to inviolable minority rights.

    [Editorial Report] The embargo Greece imposed on The Former 
Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia (FYROM), a citizen's protest 
against it, as well as Athens' refusal to participate in a 
peacekeeping force that would include Turkish UN troops elicited 
commentaries from the Greek press. 
<H5>  Embargo Protest Discussed </H5>
  An article in the 25 March Athens daily I KATHIMERINI by 
Athens University alternate professor of political 
communications Khristos Lirintzis discusses the public 
denunciation of the embargo on the FYROM by 21 Greek 
intellectuals, who asked that Greek foreign policy on this issue 
be reviewed. While one can disagree with the writers' message 
and its publication, writes Lirintzis, the initiative of three 
Panhellenic Socialist Movement (PASOK) deputies, who called the 
denunciation "treason" and demanded that the professors involved 
be barred from teaching, is "an unprecedented attempt to 
prohibit freedom of expression and foster alignment with 
official policy." Fortunately, the deputies' request had no 
resonance in the Chamber, and about 300 individuals have 
defended the "group of 21" and the Greeks' right to free opinion 
and dialogue. While most of the press did not publish the full 
text of the professors' denunciation and some newspapers' 
comments were "relatively low-key," others termed the "group of 
21" and its supporters "a fifth column, Skopje agents, or 
antistate elements," an example of Greek "unfortunate" populist 
practice, according to which disagreement on important national 
issues turns the protester into an "enemy, a traitor, and an 
organ of foreign interests." By rejecting a dialogue, this 
practice abolishes discussion, depicting disagreement as a 
"black and white conflict in which the choice is between the 
good guys and the bad guys." Lirintzis concludes that things are 
usually more complex, and a society that tends to simplify 
political issues significantly restricts knowledge of self and 
the control of power. 
  Mikhalis Moronis, writing in the 21 March Athens daily 
ELEVTHEROTIPIA, contends that by following a purely 
nationalistic policy in the area, Greece, with its more robust 
economy, strong democratic institutions, and membership in the 
European Union (EU) and NATO, is forfeiting the opportunity to 
play an important role in the post-Cold War Balkans. However, 
the "golden opportunities of 1990 are turning into disastrous 
prospects in 1994." By-passing Greece, our allies and partners 
have created strong diplomatic conduits for regional 
intervention with our neighbors and the countries that emerged 
from the former Yugoslavia, he writes. Even the development of 
ties between the United States and Serbia is a possibility, as 
Belgrade openly wishes and Washington cannot afford to ignore, 
given that Serbia, the strongest state in the former Yugoslavia, 
holds a key position in the Balkans, Moronis continues. Finally, 
Greece's European card is losing its significance, since the 
development of ties between Greece's neighbors and the EU is 
occurring in our absence. Meanwhile, Athens continues to create 
the impression that we are still living at the beginning of the 
century with the Balkan wars, we are the area's "troublemakers" 
and our "nationalistic explosions are just a cover for the sense 
of insecurity that pervades us. Such `phobias' derive from the 
Greek practice of foisting responsibilities on others and 
refusing to assume our own by paying the price for our national 
and individual survival," Moronis comments. 
  A brief article in the 29 March daily TA NEA contends that 
by 
asking that Athens give in to Skopje's demands about the name, 
symbols, and irredentist propaganda issues promoted by Skopje 
President Kiro Gligorov, Greece's EU "partners" prove they are 
"openly inimical" to us and fail to understand the problems they 
are creating. Additional proof lies in the fact that they are 
threatening to remand Greece to the European Court of Justice 
over the imposition of the embargo even while negotiations are 
continuing. With Germany in front, Greece's "partners are 
pushing for more confrontation as if their role in the collapse 
of Yugoslavia were not enough," the article contends. 
<H5>  UN Peacekeeping Force </H5>
  According to Potis Paraskevopoulos writing in the 27 March 
Athens KIRIAKATIKI ELEVTHEROTIPIA, the UN Security Council 
decision to dispatch Turkish troops to Bosnia is "thoughtless" 
and will undermine peace in the wider Balkan area. It is also a 
studied move by certain interests to modify the region's 
geopolitical map and impose a new order, Paraskevopoulos 
contends. Turkish troops are unrelated to peacekeeping 
activities, since peace in Bosnia was imposed solely through 
NATO ultimatums and air power. This "positive development" 
should have been followed by an attempt to dissolve the Bosnian 
Serbs and Serbia's mistrust of international peacekeeping 
initiatives. Instead, the dispatch of Turkish troops to Bosnia 
compounds the Serbs' lack of confidence and constitutes a 
"provocation" against Serbia, Greece, and other Balkan 
countries, as well as against the UN, whose Security Council 
repeatedly condemned the Turkish invasion of Cyprus, 
Paraskevopoulos comments. Turkish troops will not be in the 
region to monitor peace between Bosnian Muslims and Croats, 
since the two sides have agreed on a federal state, or to 
enhance the Bosnian Muslims' sense of security, ensured through 
other UN blue helmets. Moreover, as Slavs, Serbian Muslims do 
not feel especially close to Turkey. Those who do are Albanians, 
and Kosovo and Skopje Albanians, Paraskevopoulos affirms. While 
Turkish UN troops are sent to the North, they will be used in 
the South, where their presence will encourage the separatist 
tendencies of Kosovo Albanians and the Albanians' expansionary 
views. Herein lies the threat against peace in the Balkans, 
Paraskevopoulos contends. The "troublemaking and provocative" 
role of a Turkish military presence in the former Yugoslavia 
masks a punitive plan for the territorial diminution of 
[President Slobodan] Milosevic's Serbia by using Kosovo as a 
target: Turkish UN troops are the "lance in the attack and the 
Skopje U.S. blue helmets are its shield." While this scenario 
may be considered a "figment of the imagination," the goal of 
the UN decision is unquestionably "crafty" and portends threats 
of war. The choice the Greek Government faces is clear, 
Paraskevopoulos comments. Athens must not send troops to the 
area and should not get involved in "war games," even if the 
principal actors are UN troops. Greece should play the role of 
"firefighter and arbiter" in support of a peace that obviates 
the expansion of military activities to southern Yugoslavia. 
Athens should not be swayed by the threat that Turkish troops in 
Bosnia upgrade Ankara's regional role, for the "damage is small 
compared to ensuring peace at all costs," Paraskevopouios 
concludes. 
  A different view is expounded by Kostas Iordhanidhis in a 27 
March I KATHIMERINI article. While it is clear that through a 
military presence Turkey will share in a settlement in the 
Balkans, from where it was expelled after the 1912-1913 wars, it 
is "naive" to expect that Greece can play a role in the area by 
watching local developments from the outside simply as a member 
of the EU, writes Iordhanidhis. It is "self-delusion" on the 
part of some Greek politicians to think that participation in 
the EU geographically moved the country to Central Europe and 
modified the nature of its problems. These are still related to 
major political instability on its northern borders and the fate 
of Hellenism in the Balkans, he continues. If Greece is to be 
the vector of the EU's Balkans policy, it will only do so 
through active intervention, as Ankara has consistently done. 
Iordhanidhis concludes that while a rejection of the Turkish 
offer of troops would have been preferable--as would have been a 
UN refusal to dismember Yugoslavia in 1991--and Greek 
participation in peacekeeping activities may entail human 
losses, Greece should nevertheless enter the fray, notably in 
view of the fact that this is requested by Serbia, with which 
Greece maintains strong ties of friendship, Iordhanidhis 
concludes.

  [Text] High-ranking officials of the Albanian Government 
with responsibility for energy issues had talks with the 
Greek-Russian company Promitheas Gas in Athens on the sale of 
natural gas to the neighboring country. 
  Heading the Albanian delegation was K. Meksi, bother of the 
Albanian prime minister. The meeting aimed at specifying the 
conditions for the supply of natural gas following the initial 
signing of a protocol between the Albanian Government and 
Promitheas Gas in November 1991. 
  According to a statement by the Greek-Russian company, 
Albania is particularly interested in developing the natural gas 
market as soon as possible. The supply of natural gas to the 
neighboring state will be achieved with the construction of a 
pipeline that will go through the area of Ptolemais, thus 
allowing for the supply of natural gas to the western Greek 
region. For the construction of the pipeline, a study is 
already underway with the support of the European Union through 
the PHARE [Poland-Hungary Assistance for the Reconstruction of 
the Economy] program. 
  According to reports, Albania is interested in the supply of 
1 billion cubic meters of natural gas per year to resume 
operations of fertilizer factories in southern Albania that 
today are idle due to a lack of raw materials. 
  As is known, Promitheas Gas was founded by the Russian 
company VEP Gasexport, the largest exporter of natural gas in 
the world, and the group of companies of Kopelouzou Brothers, 
which has the exclusive rights for the sale of natural gas that 
transits through Greece to third countries.

  [Excerpt] For the protection of the rights of the Greek 
minority in Albania, the government carefully follows the moves 
of the Albanian Government to give fertile government land in 
the village of (Vrina) in Sarande to 150 poor families of 
Albanian Muslims from the area of Tepelene. 
  The above statement by the Greek Foreign Ministry was issued 
in response to a question by the Political Spring party, which 
used this pretext to call on the government to "pay particular 
attention to the continuous efforts to change the population of 
North Epirus, instead of insisting on ineffective friendship 
overtures to the Albanian regime." 
  The Greek Foreign Ministry statement stresses that the 
government "will continue handling the issues related to the 
Greek minority with particular responsibility, distancing itself 
from nationalist glorification--which as the experience of the 
recent past has proven, has not served the Greek interests--and 
with the sole purpose of protecting human rights and minority 
rights and one's right to remain in one's birthplace." [passage

  [Excerpt] Deputy Defence Minister Nikolaos Kouris has 
accused Turkey of attempting to change the status quo in the 
Aegean. Continuous Turkish air violations over the Aegean were 
part of "a planned escalation of tensions." Ankara's intention 
was to create false tension that could lead to a military 
confrontation and to a Pax Aegean, a peace imposed by "a foreign 
intervention" as in former Yugoslavia, the minister said 
yesterday in a state radio interview. [passage omitted]

  [Text] Among the goals of Political Spring is cooperation 
with PASOK [Panhellenic Socialist Movement] in the municipal 
elections. 
  During the opening of the party's political office in Samos, 
Political Spring Deputy Nikitas Kaklamanis said 
characteristically: "...if we find it appropriate, or someone 
proposes to us, or we propose to cooperate in some 
municipalities, something that is among our goals, I would say 
it is more likely to happen with PASOK rather than New 
Democracy." 
  Responding to a correspondent's question on possible 
cooperation between Political Spring and other political parties 
in the election of the president, Kaklamanis said that the 
institution of the presidency cannot, in any case, be part of 
any kind of political commercialization or exchange.

  [Text] Stilianos Papathemelis, the public order minister, 
announced plans yesterday to introduce sweeping changes in the 
Greek police force, including the setting up of a special 
homicide unit and the right to form trade unions. 
  Draft legislation is to be tabled in parliament in the 
coming 
days, said Papathemelis, and will propose the establishment of 
powerful elite divisions in every department of the 
force--public order, security, traffic and consumer protection. 
The new system will be introduced as a pilot scheme next month 
in Athens, Thessaloniki and one regional town. Papathemelis 
said a national exam would be set for applicants seeking 
entrance to ordinary and officer police training schools. 
  Under the new proposals, police staff-management relations 
will be brought in line with the rest of the civil service. 
Transfers will only be allowed to take place once every year. 
If the bill is passed without significant amendments, 
Papathemelis said negotiations would begin with union leaders to 
allow police officers union representation.

  [Text] The government is gearing up to issue Greek 
Telecommunications Organization (OTE) shares. Following several 
months of inactivity, it is now hastening the process, 
apparently under the pressure of the uncertainties surrounding 
the implementation of the budget. At a large meeting presided 
over by Deputy Minister to the Prime Minister Andonis Livanis 
with the participation of Minister of Finance Papadhopoulos, 
Minister of Transportation I. Kharalambous, and other government 
officials it was decided that the stock floatation bill will be 
submitted to the Chamber of Deputies as soon as possible in 
April. The Livanis presence at the meeting underlines the prime 
minister's interest in the issue of OTE stock. The bill is being 
elaborated by the Ministry of National Economy; according to 
available information, it is envisioned that up to 30 percent of 
OTE shares will be sold to private investors through the stock 
market. 
  The government's goal is to secure the sale of the first 
package of OTE shares until next September to enhance government 
revenue in next fall's critical period, when budgetary pressures 
will be at their highest. It is now clear that part of the 
income from the sale of shares will be devoted to enhancing 
revenue and not be used in its entirety to fulfill the needs of 
the OTE's investment program, as the government initially 
announced. 
  In general, the interest of foreign investors in the OTE 
remains strong and the ministry of national economy is being 
"besieged" by potential investors.

  [Text] It has been announced that Turkey has been 
extending electrical power aid to northern Iraq since 3 April. 
Speaking at his weekly news conference, Foreign Ministry 
spokesman Ferhat Ataman said that Turkey has been supplying the 
region with 20 megawatts of power by using the lines between 
Silopi and Zakho. He recalled that the Iraqi Administration has 
not been able to supply the Province of Dahuk with power since 
last August. We have taken this step to temporarily solve the 
problem confronting the Iraqi people, he said. 
  Ataman stressed that this aid should be assessed within the 
framework of the humanitarian aid Turkey extends to Iraq. It is 
important, he said, for the Iraqi Government to recreate the 
conditions whereby it can supply power to the region. 
  According to information supplied by the Foreign Ministry 
spokesman, the Turkish Red Crescent extended a total of 7,098 
tonnes of food to 1,007,955 persons in Dahuk, Irbil, and 
Sulaymaniyah during the past six months.

<F P=106> [Interview with newly elected Istanbul Mayor Tayyip Erdogan </F>
and Ankara Mayor Melih Gokcek by Reha Muhtar for the "Firing 
Line" program in Ankara; date not given -- recorded] 
  [Text] [Muhtar] I first want to congratulate you on 
becoming the mayors of Ankara and Istanbul following democratic 
elections. I will begin with you, Mr. Tayyip Erdogan. You are 
now at the head of a big metropolis, Istanbul. Istanbul is the 
capital of empires, a multilingual and multinational city. You 
received 25 percent of the votes, despite 75 percent of the 
populace opposing you. This could have been the case for any 
other party such as the True Path Party or the Motherland Party, 
but 75 percent of the population believes that your party is 
ideologically different. As you yourself claim, the Prosperity 
Party [PP] is the one that will change the order and the 
population is apprehensive about what you plan to change. 
  [Erdogan] Firstly, I would like to thank you for arranging 
this forum, as speculation is rife these days both regarding our 
party and ourselves. There are also provocations. We regret 
them. Only recently, it was 0200 in the middle of the night, I 
held my head in my hands and started to weep. Are we not the 
children of this country? We were also born and bred in this 
country. 
  [Muhtar] What incidents are you referring to? 
  [Erdogan] Certain ugly things appearing in the media 
genuinely distressed us. We have been elected mayor and the PP 
is a party established within the framework of the country's 
laws. In other words, we must discuss what we must do in this 
office. A certain sector of the media, however, is driving our 
people into a justified fear. We are sorry about this. There 
is nothing to fear. We are not in a position to question 
anyone's dress code. As I stated during many panel discussions, 
the municipality will fulfill its duty respecting the existing 
culture in Istanbul, regardless of opinions or faith. 
  [Muhtar] Are you saying that there will be no change in the 
social life? 
  [Erdogan] This is our position as the municipality: We will 
exercise our authority without resorting to bribery, 
exploitation, or corruption. Let us look at Article 58 of the 
Constitution. It is highly beneficial to read this article, 
which protects our youth from bad habits. As the municipality, 
it is up to us to control whether such institutions are 
sanitary. I announced that if I go on an inspection tour, I 
will not be the one to conduct the inspection. I will inform the 
media and hand over the inspection file to the media and ask 
them to conduct the inspection. 
  [Muhtar] Naturally, you do not have the authority to open or 
close down certain places. Most restaurants or entertainment 
places in Istanbul cannot be said to keep clean back rooms or 
kitchens. This grants you extensive authority. If you wish to 
close down certain places on the basis of your ideology, then 
you can use public health as an excuse. One cannot truthfully 
say that health conditions are exemplary in such places either 
in Istanbul or Ankara. 
  [Erdogan] Are you saying that they should work in such dirty 
conditions? 
  [Muhtar] No, this is not what I mean. Everything is below 
the standard you cite. I am saying that there is such a fear. 
  [Erdogan] This raises another issue. It was not the PP that 
determined this standard, but its predecessors. 
  [Muhtar] This is not a matter of standard, but one of 
society. 
  [Erdogan] No. We may have set different standards, but the 
current standards were set by other parties. Moreover, I am 
saying that I will not be the one to control this standard. I 
will invite the media and show them the inspection file, which 
was not prepared by the PP. I will ask them if they are willing 
to eat and drink in such places. We must be realistic. They 
will say no. I will then ask them to apply the appropriate 
sanctions. I will not be the one to apply them. We will show 
what a participatory democracy is in this country. We will not, 
however, accept bribes to look the other way. This we will not 
do. 
  [Muhtar] In other words, you will consider only public 
health and environmental aspects. 
  [Erdogan] We will only demonstrate our sincerity in 
implementing the existing laws. 
  [Muhtar] I would now like to address you, Mr. Melih 
Gokcek. You are the mayor of the capital of the country, the 
seat of the republican ideology. Will the social life of the 
citizens of Ankara change in any way? 
  [Gokcek] They will live as they wish, the same as before. 
We will run the municipality. The citizens' personal lives 
concern only them, not us. 
  [Muhtar] All the institutions of the Turkish Republic are 
located in Ankara. You are member of a party in favor of 
changing the order. Do you feel apprehensive about being in the 
capital? 
  [Gokcek] Certainly not. I was born in Ankara. 
  [Muhtar] I was not referring to the citizenship issues. I 
was referring to Ankara as the seat of the republican ideology. 
  [Gokcek] Why should we feel apprehensive? We were born and 
bred here. 
  [Muhtar] What kind of policy will you pursue? 
  [Gokcek] As far as the order is concerned, there are 
naturally aspects of which I do not approve. You would not 
approve of them either. It is necessary to define what we mean 
by the order in the country. For example, do you condone 
corruption? Can you condone it? 
  [Muhtar] This is not what I meant. 
  [Gokcek] Corruption and bribery have become a part of the 
order. I will change this order. This is inevitable. 
  [Muhtar] I was referring to the constitutional order. 
  [Gokcek] There are also aspects within the constitutional 
order which must be changed. A constitution was drafted in 
1924; another was introduced in 1960. 
  [Muhtar] You are mayor under the existing constitution. 
  [Gokcek] Those who come to power seem to change what their 
predecessors have done. 
  [Muhtar] You are the two mayors under the current 
constitutional order. There may be conflicts between your views 
and the constitution. How will you act in light of this 
conflict? 
  [Gokcek] One is obliged to abide by the laws. There is no 
other way. I would exert every possible effort to change the 
law if I do not approve of it as a member of parliament. As a 
mayor, however, I do not have such authority or influence. As a 
mayor, I have to accept and implement the laws handed down by 
the Turkish Grand National Assembly. There is nothing else to 
do, even if I do not approve of the laws. 
  [Muhtar] Recently the press has carried reports about PP 
members, supporters, or more radical circles interfering in 
women's dress code or forcing them off buses. Is this 
post-election euphoria? 
  [Gokcek] These reports are false. A party member would 
never do such things. Since we were elected into office, we 
have appealed to the citizens to report persons who harass them 
to the authorities. You will see that they are not members of 
the PP, they are merely provocateurs. I have here in my hand 
several faxes. One of them states: Women employees must be 
discouraged from wearing short skirts, pants, shorts, or other 
revealing attire. This fax was sent by the Halk Bank. 
  [Erdogan] I would like to issue a reminder. There are 
attempts to create the impression that the PP is heading a 
municipal authority for the first time. This party was in power 
in 1974; it was a coalition partner in 1975 and 1976. Its 
members were mayors in over 100 municipalities before the latest 
elections, including bid cities, provinces, districts, and 
townships. Do you believe that anything happened to trigger 
these complaints? 
  [Muhtar] When you assumed office, you visited the Ataturk 
Mausoleum. Certain circles were not expecting such a visit on 
your part. 
  [Gokcek] This was not my first time. 
  [Muhtar] No, but this time you visited as a PP mayor. Did 
this cause any resentment in the party grassroots? 
  [Gokcek] This is concocted by certain elements in the public 
and they are the ones who believe in it. In other words, they 
create the ogres in their heads and then they believe them. In 
public offices, for example, they scare the citizens. They have 
no right to do this. 
  [Muhtar] What will happen in the municipalities? I am 
directing this question to both of you. Will women employees 
continue to work? 
  [Gokcek] What woman employee was disturbed during the five 
years that I served as mayor of Kecioren? I was also general 
director of the Child Protection Association for two and a half 
years and I ask if any women employees were disturbed during 
that time. This is not logical. 
  [Erdogan] Let me tell you this: We are heading the 
municipalities in six districts and three townships in Istanbul 
at the moment. You can question all the women in these 
municipalities on whether we interfere in their dress code. The 
dress code was introduced before us. We believe women can dress 
as they wish. There are women in some Istanbul municipalities 
who wanted to cover themselves, but were unable to do so. They 
could not cover their heads because they feared being dismissed. 
There are maybe 10 or 11 such women. 
  [Muhtar] You became the head of such an important city. In 
the first days, it was announced that a mosque will be built in 
the middle of Taksim Square. Is this a very important issue for 
you? Or, did you not announce this? 
  [Erdogan] This was initiated by the press. They came and 
asked me. I replied as follows: When the Taksim mosque issue 
was raised for the first time 20 years ago, I became a trustee 
of this project. A foundation exists in connection with this 
project. The mosque will not be built by the municipality. It 
will be built by the foundation. When the foundation applies 
for the project, I will make the necessary arrangements and hand 
the land over to the foundation. 
  [Muhtar] Are you referring to the parking lot? 
  [Erdogan] Yes. It is a parking lot at the moment. 
  [Muhtar] What I am trying to say is that the day you became 
the mayor of a large metropolis like Istanbul you announced that 
a mosque will be built in Taksim. 
  [Erdogan] No, it was not my first statement. I merely 
answered a question. You are the ones who are asking the 
questions. 
  [Muhtar] Does that mean you will not concern yourself with 
these questions? 
  [Erdogan] These are my [word indistinct] issues. These are 
legal topics. As the mayor, I will exercise any authority in my 
jurisdiction to the benefit of my people, and not as a hostile 
action against my people. I would like to explain the 
following: There are even things that violate the Constitution. 
Article 58 bans alcoholic drinks and bad habits. Even though 
the Constitution is being violated here, the media is still 
trying to portray me as opposed to the Constitution. 
  [Muhtar] How does the Constitution ban alcoholic drinks? 
  [Erdogan] Article 58 cites bad habits, alcoholic drinks, and 
notes that the state should take the necessary measures with 
regard to these matters. 
  [Muhtar] The Constitution also defends individual freedoms, 
each person's private life. 
  [Erdogan] Article 58 is very interesting. It says: The 
state will adopt the necessary measures to protect the youth in 
the face of addiction to alcohol, narcotics, criminality, 
gambling, and similar bad habits, as well as ignorance. 
  [Muhtar] It mentions the youth. In other words, you can 
drink if you are an adult. You say that our Constitution bans 
alcohol. 
  [Erdogan] Yes. Turkey is such a strange country. It is the 
only country in the world, in which the state itself produces 
alcoholic drinks. 
  [Muhtar] Approximately 75 percent of the population is 
opposed to you. You will serve as [word indistinct] mayors. 
You must be flexible and you are trying to create such an image 
at the moment. 
  [Gokcek] By the same token, 87 percent are against the 
Social Democratic Populist Party. 
  [Muhtar] Yes, but as you have said, these parties are all 
parties who favor the existing order and therefore the 
opposition does not create such a contrast. 
  [Erdogan] How high was the high jump bar placed? Let us say 
at a height of 1.8 meters. We jumped from 1.8. We will be able 
to jump even if they place the bar at 2 meters. We will abandon 
everything else and begin practicing high jumping. 
  [Gokcek] As someone said, if they succeed once, they will 
never fail again. Of course, we will succeed. We are destined 
to succeed. 
  [Muhtar] The fact that a large sector of the population is 
against you and you are a party opposed to the existing order 
places 75 percent of the population locked against you. You are 
the mayor. There are artists and the media in your cities and 
these factors are very dominant. Now, sitting here in front of 
me, you are creating a very moderate image. Are you playing 
tricks, or.. 
  [Gokcek] Again you are putting words into our mouths. 
  [Muhtar] I am merely asking. 
  [Erdogan] Moreover, our lives are in the open. We did not 
come from another planet. We are currently living here. 
  [Muhtar] So, you are not playing tricks. 
  [Erdogan] We did not come from outer space. We were born 
and bred here and we live here now. 
  [Muhtar] Will you always respect democracy? 
  [Gokcek] Do you doubt it? 
  [Muhtar] I am asking on behalf of the society. 
  [Erdogan] Do you personally doubt it? 
  [Muhtar] I am not important as a person. It is the society 
that is important. 
  [Erdogan] Are you trying me on behalf of the society? 
  [Muhtar] I am asking because the society has doubts. 
  [Erdogan] Those who now claim to exist in the name of 
democracy are not democrats; on the contrary, they are 
democratic dictators. 
  [Muhtar] You made a statement in response to Istanbul 
Governor Kozakcioglu's remarks. You reportedly warned him to be 
careful. 
  [Erdogan] I did not make a statement addressing the 
governor. Only the following is true: We are assuming power, 
knowing the laws pertaining to municipalities. We are aware of 
our rights. The honorable governor is obliged to act 
objectively. 
  [Muhtar] Are you disturbed about the governor's remarks? 
  [Erdogan] I still cannot conceive that the governor made 
such a statement. I read this in the press, but I do not 
believe that he made such a statement. It is not the governor's 
duty to judge the PP. I had not even assumed my post when the 
statement was made. I had not even announced what my actions 
will be. The governor's duty is to be objective; he can never 
have the right to judge the PP. We plan to cooperate with the 
governor in Istanbul and take this city further to better days. 
  [Muhtar] It is not easy to govern millions. Some of your 
supporters or circles close to you may have indulged in 
excessive behavior. The citizens of Istanbul and Ankara 
probably experienced this. We were informed of such incidents 
and I do not think that everyone is telling lies. Do you plan 
to take measures against this, against persons telling others 
how to dress or behave on the streets? 
  [Gokcek] Let me tell you clearly. Our own supporters do not 
engage in such actions. These are lies deliberately spread by 
members of the Social Democratic Populist Party after this party 
lost the elections. 
  [Muhtar] Do you deny that such incidents took place? 
  [Gokcek] The incidents did occur, but the perpetrators are 
clearly provocateurs. 
  [Erdogan] We caught three men dressed as veiled women and 
they fled using their weapons. 
  [Muhtar] Are these not connected to you? 
  [Erdogan] No. 
  [Muhtar] Maybe your party is not involved, but you cannot 
control all the millions who vote for you. 
  [Gokcek] We are making an appeal. I have already issued 
calls on television and now I am repeating myself on your 
program. I am saying that all this harassment on dress code or 
other issues consists entirely of provocations. I am calling on 
the citizens to catch such persons and hand them over to the 
security and to us. Let us pursue the matter. 
  [Erdogan] I personally experienced an incident. In addition 
to cases in which women dressed in revealing clothes were not 
allowed on buses, I heard that women wearing head covers at the 
Theology Department in Baglarbasi, Istanbul, were also refused 
on vehicles. This creates hostile camps, which is very 
unfortunate. 
  [Muhtar] Since we are talking about polarization, I would 
like to ask another brief question. Will there be segregation 
on buses? 
  [Erdogan] Absolutely not. These are mere fabrications.

  [Text] TURK-IS [Turkish Confederation of Labor] adopted a 
series of decisions to protest the economic package. The 
TURK-IS' council of presidents, which set up a permanent action 
committee, concluded that there is no way the package could be 
implemented within democratic rules and the state might consider 
introducing disciplinary laws. 
  [Begin unidentified correspondent recording] TURK-IS' 
council 
of presidents, which met in an extraordinary session soon after 
the unveiling of the economic package, decided to hold a massive 
rally in Ankara as soon as possible. 
  In a statement after the meeting, TURK-IS leader Bayram 
Meral 
said that actions such as slowing down or stopping work in 
workshops will be immediately put into action. Hoping that the 
government will reconsider its decisions, Bayram Meral recalled 
that the 12 September coup [in 1980] was made in order to 
implement [former president Ozal's] 24 January [1980 economic 
austerity] measures. Arguing that the there is no way to 
implement the economic package within democratic rules, Meral 
said that there might be the question of enacting certain 
disciplinary laws. Meral added that if the government takes 
such a measure, then all workers will go on a general strike.

  [Text] During operations carried out on Agri Mountain over 
the past month, 29 terrorists were killed and 26 terrorists were 
caught. Furthermore, 164 persons were taken into custody for 
abetting the terrorist organization. 
  Igdir Governor Semsettin Uzun has said that thanks to the 
help of the citizens, the regional cadre of the terrorist PKK 
[Workers Party of Kurdistan] has been destroyed. 
  The governor pointed out that the interrogation of the 
suspects indicates that the number of dead and wounded 
terrorists is higher but that the bodies could not be found 
because they were buried under the snow. 
  Meanwhile, in searches conducted in the region, two SA-16 
SAM 
missiles, as well as large amounts of weapons, ammunition, and 
snow gear, were found. The 74 shelters uncovered during the

  Answering a question on the issue, Foreign Ministry 
Spokesman 
Ferhat Ataman said that this adverse behavior by Greece, which 
came at a time when the realities behind the PKK terrorist 
organization's terrorism is better understood and banned in 
Europe, throws light on Greece's mentality as it concerns Turkey. 
  Ataman said: It is obvious that Greece never gained and 
never will gain anything from an approach that treats Turkey's 
enemy as its friend. Opening a terrorist bureau in Athens is 
against Greece's agreement regarding fighting terrorism as 
stipulated by international provisions. It is extremely 
disconcerting that Greece, which has itself been target of 
various terrorist organizations, is backing another terrorist 
organization. 
  Ataman noted: The Greek ambassador was called to our 
ministry in view of the developments in Athens. We described 
the incident as a hostile act, conveyed our reaction, and 
submitted a request that Greece abide by international 
requirements.

  [Text] Budapest (ADN) -- Bavarian Minister-President Edmund 
Stoiber has urged partial membership of the European Union (EU) 
for the Visegrad states -- Hungary, Poland, the Czech Republic, 
and Slovakia. Speaking at a news conference in Budapest at the 
end of his visit to Hungary yesterday, Stoiber said the eastward 
expansion of the EU is of fundamental importance. On this issue 
he is in "relatively close agreement" with German Chancellor 
Helmut Kohl, who also spoke of a special relationship with the 
Visegrad countries. As a result in particular of the wave of 
migration from East Europe, the increase in organized crime, and 
a common asylum policy, these states should already have a place 
at the table of the Twelve, or eventually the Sixteen. 
  Stoiber arrived in Budapest with a delegation of leading 
Bavarian economic representatives yesterday morning. He 
conferred with Prime Minister Peter Boross, Defense Minister 
Lajos Fur, and Finance Minister Ivan Szabo. He also met with 
President Arpad Goncz and with Gabor Kuncze, the Alliance of 
Free Democrats candidate for the post of prime minister.

<F P=106> ["froe" report: "DIHT Opposes European Social Standard"] </F>
  [Text] Bonn -- The Federation of German Chambers of 
Industry and Commerce [DIHT] has come out against a 
harmonization of the social policy of the European Union [EU] at 
the present time. The top organization of the industrial and 
trade chambers criticized the Commission's "Green Paper on 
European Social Policy" by saying that the authors want to 
pursue "social policy under the cover of an `active' labor 
market policy." 
  The Green Paper is to show ways to fulfill the demand of the 
Maastricht Treaty to have European integration accompanied by 
sociopolitical measures. 
  The DIHT welcomes the approach of the Green Paper, according 
to which "social progress is possible only by means of economic 
success," and also agrees that the social services must be used 
more purposefully to provide greater incentives to look for 
work. In this way the DIHT thinks that the wrong use of state 
funds for the labor market could be reduced and employment 
increased. 
  However, the top organization thinks that the authors of the 
Green Paper do not pursue their own principles any further. 
When they make the right to work the starting point of European 
social policy, which the EU members must fulfill by means of 
jobs that are subsidized by the state, this can no longer be 
brought in harmony with the principle of economic compatibility, 
the DIHT says. The EU's social safeguard systems have already 
reached the limits of their economic capacity. The DIHT also 
has budget policy reasons for warning against a uniformly high 
standard of social services, in particular since the levels of 
social achievement are still very different in the individual 
countries. 
  The DIHT also calls into question the "right of the 
individual to advanced training throughout his or her working 
life," which the authors of the Green Paper postulate. Such a 
right would decouple qualifications from the requirements of the 
labor market "and thus have an effect contrary to what the EU 
Commission is striving for." Separating qualifications from 
company policy would, at the same time, require state financing, 
which none of the EU states could guarantee. Rather, the 
working people's own interest must be mobilized to contribute 
themselves to competitiveness on the labor market and to use 
their money and leisure time for this purpose.

  [Text] Bonn -- In Baden-Wuerttemberg, the authorities 
dealing with aliens have deported to Turkey the first of the 
Kurds who were arrested during an illegal demonstration in 
Mannheim on 27 March. This was reported yesterday by Interior 
Minister Frieder Birzele in Stuttgart. One of the three Kurds 
who were expelled from Bavaria has already appealed to the 
Administrative Court in Augsburg. Federal Justice Minister 
Sabine Leutheusser-Schnarrenberg's (FDP) [Free Democratic Party] 
negative stance toward the expulsions from Bavaria has 
encountered criticism within the FDP. FDP acting chairman 
Wolfgang Gerhardt warned that the credibility of the rule of law 
might be cast into doubt if violent offenders cannot be deported. 
  Detlef Kleinert, legal expert of the FDP faction in the 
Bundestag, told DIE WELT that the Federal Republic cannot permit 
foreigners to settle their differences in Germany. Kleinert 
expressed the need for an agreement with Turkey whereby Turkey 
would pledge not to subject Kurds to torture or impose the death 
penalty on them. The relevant talks between the Interior, 
Foreign, and Justice Ministries are being delayed because of the 
FDP dispute. The conclusion of the agreement can be expected in 
a few weeks at the very earliest. 
  Lower Saxony deported 31 Kurds to Turkey in January and 
February.

<F P=106> [Report by Jan Friese: "The Possibilities on the </F>
Subcontinent Have Not Yet Been Exploited"] 
  [Text] New Delhi, 5 Apr -- At a time when German-Indian 
economic relations are currently far below their potential -- 
and there is general agreement about that -- this is certainly 
not due to a lack of visitors. After Chancellor Helmut Kohl's 
trip to India last year and the return visit by Prime Minister 
Rao in February, FRG Economics Minister Guenter Rexrodt's trip 
to Delhi is the third visit to India by a German minister this 
year. 
  Guenter Rexrodt has come to participate in the 11th meeting 
of the "Joint Economic Committee" in the Indian capital. This 
committee has been meeting at the ministerial level since 1988; 
thus it is a routine matter. However, Rexrodt is going at an 
important time in India's economic development and in 
German-Indian economic relations. 
  Three bilateral treaties, an amendment to the German-Indian 
double taxation agreement, a new aviation agreement, and an 
investment protection agreement are in different stages of 
preparation. The double-taxation agreement is practically 
concluded, and the German side is reportedly satisfied with the 
result. 
<H5>  Agreements on Investment Protection </H5>
  The FRG economics minister wants to finish the preparations 
for signing the aviation agreement in Delhi. It will bring 
about additional landing rights for Lufthansa in Indian cities 
and, in addition, help Air India in expanding its tourist 
business. The "investment protection and promotion agreement," 
is also virtually ready for signature apart from a few 
"technical-juridical details." After Great Britain, the FRG will 
be the second country with which India will conclude such an 
agreement. 
  The 20-person economic delegation accompanying the minister 
stresses that the visit will naturally also deal with 
down-to-earth business. Rexrodt told correspondents that he 
wants to advocate several specific projects, among others in the 
fields of telecommunications, machine-building, iron and steel, 
energy, and food industry. 
  In New Delhi, Rexrodt will also meet with Indian Prime 
Minister Rao, Finance Minister Singh, and Minister of Commerce 
Mukherjee, as well as the minister of civilian aviation and 
tourism, the minister of post and telecommunications, and the 
state secretary in the Foreign Ministry. 
  In the meetings with Rao, Singh, and Mukherjee, it is likely 
that not just "bilateral issues" will be discussed, because the 
Indians' worries concerning the GATT conference in Marrakesh are 
currently the dominating economic policy issue in New Delhi. 
  Rexrodt's doubts whether environment-specific trade barriers 
are the best way to make free world trade compatible with the 
environment are not only shared by New Delhi, but are seen as a 
neoprotectionist specter, together with other initiatives, such 
as "trade-related work norms" and countervailing duties against 
"social dumping." In contrast to the skirmish with Washington, 
New Delhi hopes that it will find a few common points with Bonn 
in these fields. 
  In the bilateral sphere, it is intended to look for new ways 
to strengthen German-Indian partnership in trade and industrial 
cooperation. If German industry "is underrepresented in the 
Asian-Pacific region," as the Federal Government's Asian concept 
says, this quite certainly also applies to India because German 
industry has only a very moderate share in the current boom in 
India, especially regarding investments. 
<H5>  Bilateral Trade Stimulated Again </H5>
  Even though German investments in India have doubled every 
year since 1990 (measured by the approved applications), the 
German share in total foreign investments in India has, at the 
same time, declined from second place to 10th place. Only 
regarding the number of cooperation projects (173 in 1993) have 
German companies successfully maintained their traditional 
second place among India's partners in technology. 
  It seems that German investment capital is still shy. 
Several large projects of renowned companies, such as Siemens, 
BASF, and Mercedes-Benz, to cite just a few, permit, however, 
the conclusion that a change is emerging in this field. 
  German-Indian trade has also been stimulated again after an 
extended period of stagnation. Trade volume rose by 12 percent 
in 1993; thus, for the first time exceeding 6 billion German 
marks. This is a sum that Rexrodt called "very, very small" with 
a view to China. "We are not here without euphoria," Rexrodt 
said, referring to the missed opportunities, "and we are not 
just thinking of China anymore." 
  Customs reductions, great plans for expansion in the field 
of 
infrastructure, reorganization of the nationalized companies, 
and a quickly growing large market give the go-ahead for major 
business with India. The glitches in implementing these plans 
will be the main subject of the ministers' meeting in New Delhi.

<F P=106> [Interview with Bavarian Minister-President Edmund Stoiber </F>
by Katalin Karcagi; place and date not given: "Hungary May 
Receive Partial EU Membership"] 
  [Excerpts] [passage omitted] [Karcagi] In your view, to 
what extent is Hungary able to make use of the help offered by 
Bavaria [to East European countries in forming closer contacts 
with the European Union--EU]? 
  [Stoiber] I will first mention management training for 
Hungarian entrepreneurs held by the Munich East-West Management 
Center -- the Hungarian side is making efficient use of this. 
There is close cooperation in education: I am referring to the 
exchange of kindergarten nurses and visits offered for teachers. 
Bavaria is helping to retrain Russian teachers and to teach the 
German language. [passage omitted] 
  [Karcagi] What are the experiences of Bavarian investors: 
What difficulties should they expect? 
  [Stoiber] They have very good experiences. It is favorable 
that the legal framework has been stabilized in Hungary. In my 
view, Bavarian investors are making use of the possibilities: 
Of the 3,000 German-Hungarian joint ventures, some 800 are 
operating with Bavarian firms, and Siemens has created 5,000 
jobs in Hungary. There are minor problems, for example, Scholler 
and Audi should be paying customs duty on their deliveries 
retrospectively because the regulations have been changed in the 
meantime but, hopefully, this issue will now be settled. 
  [Karcagi] What is the Bavarian reaction to Hungary's recent 
domestic political disputes, the battle over the media, the 
harsh tone of the election campaign, and the extreme right-wing 
statements? Has Hungary's image changed? 
  [Stoiber] It has not become weaker; Hungary has a favorable 
image, that of a stabilizing democracy. The battles and the 
dispute are concomitant with the campaign that has started. 
This is normal in a democracy, and it is not my task to 
interfere in domestic political issues; however, I am certain 
that the polemics do not have a negative influence on Hungary's 
image. According to the indications, Hungary is progressing 
most consistently and is fastest on the road to democratic 
renewal. The situation is much more difficult in Romania, 
Bulgaria, and Slovakia. [passage omitted]

<F P=106> ["ban."-initialed report: "Export Ban on `Antipersonnel </F>
Mines' Soon?"] 
  [Excerpt] Bonn, 6 Apr -- After coordination with 
humanitarian relief organizations, the Federal Government is 
planning to ban the export of "antipersonnel mines." According 
to information received from the Foreign Ministry, the Federal 
Cabinet resolution on the moratorium, which has an initial term 
of three years, should be adopted before the summer recess. The 
United States, France, and the Netherlands have already voted in 
favor of such a moratorium. The Federal Government is hoping 
that further export countries will join the initiative. 
  According to German Red Cross (DRK) estimates, at least 800 
people are killed or maimed by so-called antipersonnel mines 
every month throughout the world. In 62 countries, especially 
in the Third World, entire stretches of land are littered with 
such mines. This makes economic recovery and the food supply in 
these countries more difficult and often impossible. In a 
letter written in March and published on Wednesday [6 April], 
DRK President Sayn-Wittgenstein asked Federal Chancellor Helmut 
Kohl "to do everything you can to halt the murderous and cynical 
use of mines in many parts of the world." According to Red Cross 
estimates, 100 million armed mines are said to have been laid. 
  Sayn-Wittgenstein's and Foreign Minister Kinkel's initiative 
is also intended for a UN "reviewing conference," which will 
probably deal with revising the UN armament agreement of 1982. 
A meeting of experts on this has been scheduled for May. Yet, 
so far, no more than 39 countries have signed the UN Convention 
banning the use of conventional arms that affect soldiers and 
civilians alike and injure them excessively. The initiators are 
hoping that the planned export ban will contribute to an 
increase in the number of signatories and, at the same time, to 
extending the complementary protocol referring to the use of 
mines. 
  According to the Federal Government, the ban on the use of 
antipersonnel mines should be extended to intrastate conflicts. 
So far, it only applies to conflicts between two or more 
countries. Antipersonnel mines, which only affect people, being 
too weak for tanks or other vehicles, have been used in recent 
years mainly in conflicts in the nature of a civil war. The 
countries affected include Angola, Mozambique, Afghanistan, and 
Cambodia, and -- according to information of the Federal 
Government -- Bosnia-Herzegovina. The Federal Government is 
trying to establish a UN-controlled fund that could finance the 
clearing of mines. According to considerations in Bonn, claims 
for such resources could be made conditional upon the country 
joining the UN agreement. In the case of antipersonnel mines, 
the gap between the costs of production and removal is 
particularly wide. Certain products of this kind cost $3 
apiece, while the removal of each mine stands at $1,000. 
  The costs for removal are so high mainly because 
antipersonnel mines in many cases consist only of plastic and 
cannot be found by means of metal detectors. The Foreign 
Ministry has, therefore, suggested that a general ban on mines 
without metal components be imposed. The idea of banning mines 
that do not have a mechanism for self-destruction also stems 
from the objective of reducing the costs of removal. In the 
Foreign Ministry on Wednesday the criticism was expressed that 
the 1982 UN convention does not include a mechanism for 
sanctions. The parties to a conflict do not respect the 
obligation to clear the territory of mines after the end of 
hostilities. The agreement should be supplemented by the 
principle that he who lays the mine has to pay for its removal. 
Yet, even sources in the Foreign Ministry have indicated that 
they are skeptical whether this idea would be supported by all 
signatories to the agreement. [passage omitted]

  [Excerpt] [Mrizova] Accusations have appeared in the 
German news to the effect that Chancellor Kohl has bribed

supposedly want to address a complaint to the Federal 
Constitutional Court in this matter. 
  [Scharping] With its propagandistic contributions, the 
Federal Press Office is increasingly abetting the present 
government, its spokesman Dieter Vogel is deceiving parliament, 
and his office is infringing upon political neutrality that is 
prescribed by the Constitution. Because State Secretary Vogel 
is responsible for the Federal Press Office, he should bear the 
consequences for this affair and resign from his post. The 
Social Democratic Party of Germany [SPD] will use all 
parliamentary means to resolve this situation. It is now 
working on a motion that will initiate a ban on the continued 
publication of such contributions by the Federal Press Office.

  [Text] The leaders of the Christian Democratic Union 
[CDU]/Christian Social Union [CSU] Bundestag group are 
considering higher excise and property taxes and the 
introduction of a road-use charge. Gasoline tax is not to be 
raised any further. This is envisaged by a still secret concept 
that CDU/CSU Bundestag Group Chairman Wolfgang Schaeuble intends 
to present this summer. In the medium term, payroll and income 
tax are to be reduced, investments are to be promoted, and a 
capital formation plan could open up additional leeway in wage 
policy for working people and trade unions. Schaeuble has 
declared the concept "top secret" (according to a CDU deputy). 
Finance Minister Theo Waigel (CSU) has not yet been informed. 
He is afraid of a discussion about tax increases before the 
Bavarian Landtag elections in September.

<F P=106> ["HH"-signed report: "SPD: Waigel Has Lost Perspective"] </F>
  [Text] Bonn -- The coalition and the opposition yesterday 
accused each other of incompetence in financial policy. For 
Joachim Poss, financial policy spokesman of the Social 
Democratic Party of Germany [SPD] Bundestag group, it is obvious 
that Finance Minister Theo Waigel "has completely lost the 
necessary perspective in tax and financial policy." This seems 
to have also been realized by the Christian Democratic Union 
[CDU]/Christian Social Union [CSU] group, which, according to 
newspaper reports, is working on a concept that envisages higher 
excise and property taxes, as well as the introduction of a 
road-use fee. In contrast, Waigel has stressed that there will 
not be any further tax increases apart from the reintroduction 
of the solidarity surcharge in 1995. The Finance Ministry and 
the CDU/CSU group have not commented on Schaeuble's plans. 
  Waigel criticized the SPD by saying that its government 
program would hurt medium-sized industry, even though it wants 
to address "much more strongly" the "justified concerns" of 
medium-sized industry. This applies not only to the 10-percent 
supplementary tax, no matter whether it starts at a taxable 
income of 56,000 German marks [DM], DM50,000, or less, but also 
to the restriction intended by the SPD for the tax reduction for 
conversions and sale of business (Article 34 of the Income Tax 
Law), which would lead to a wave of sale and concentration in 
medium-sized industry. The higher taxes on profits from the 
sale of shares in corporations, which the SPD demands, would 
also lead to a wave of concentration at the cost of medium-sized 
industry. 
  The disagreement, which was criticized by Poss, is found not 
only in the coalition but also in the SPD. In contrast to SPD 
Bundestag Group Chairwoman Anke Fuchs, Poss wants to stick to 
the solidarity surcharge for 1995, he told DIE WELT. Concerning 
the tax exemption of the subsistence minimum, which has been 
demanded by the Constitutional Court, he is working out a model 
in a work group. Poss understands the constitutional assignment 
in such a way that the exemption must be implemented in one step 
in 1996 -- unless Waigel can use the ruling to prove that a 
step-by-step solution is permitted. 
  From 1991 to 1995, additional burdens resulting from taxes 
(annual amount) add up to DM68.6 billion and from social 
security contributions to DM31.9 billion. This does not include 
the contributions for nursing care insurance. This is stated in 
a response by the Finance Ministry to SPD Deputy Helmut 
Wieczorek. It is surprising that the solidarity surcharge, 
which will come into effect in 1995 and which Waigel recently 
calculated at DM28 billion, is now estimated at only DM26 
billion. The solidarity surcharge, which was levied from 
mid-1991 to mid-1992, on the other hand, yielded DM28.2 billion.

<F P=106> [Unattributed report: "Talkative People"] </F>
  [Text] The policemen, who drove by a restaurant in 
Berggiesshuebel near Pirna in Saxony, did not notice anything 
prohibited. Outside the restaurant, flags of the National 
Democratic Party of Germany (NPD) were fluttering -- entirely 
legally. However, behind the facade that was put up as a 
camouflage, brown [fascist] comrades from banned neo-Nazi groups 
or from groups that are threatened with a ban were holding a 
meeting, guarded by stewards in SA-like uniforms. 
  About 50 cadres from Bavaria, Berlin, Brandenburg, and 
Saxony, most of them under 30, applauded a trio who intend to 
put new elan into the fragmented movement. 
  On a podium decorated with the Silesian banner and the Reich 
war flag, two chairmen of illegal organizations proclaimed the 
new political line: Frank Huebner, 28, from Cottbus, leader of 
the German Alternative (DA), which has been banned since 
December 1992; and Michael Swierczek, 32, from Augsburg, head of 
the banned National Offensive (NO), talked about the topic 
"rightist struggle." 
  The third in the trio was Christian Worch, 38, from Hamburg, 
who preached about the "resurrection of our people." He is the 
leading head of the National List (NL), against which an 
application for a ban has been made to the Federal 
Constitutional Court. 
  In total, seven right-wing extremist organizations have been 
banned since November 1992. Therefore, Swierczek demands to 
"change strategy and tactics." He calls on as yet rival groups 
to form a "common front." A network without central structures, 
which is "difficult to see" for the opponent, must be formed. 
  During secret meetings Huebner, Swierczek, and Worch have 
buried former controversies over who is supposed to be the 
spokesman. However, it seems to be too risky for the trio to 
form a new organization with common leadership. 
  Thus, Huebner warns the comrades not to run "into the knife 
and fall into the traps of the system." The occasion for such 
appeals: About 100 of the 350 former DA members are facing 
investigations for the suspicion of their continuing a banned 
organization. This may result in up to five years in prison. 
  State pressure involving searches, as in January and 
February 
against Direct Action/Central Germany, against members of the NO 
and of the Nationalist Front has indeed reduced the ranks of the 
active neo-Nazis. 
  However, Worch, Huebner, and Swierczek rely on their efforts 
for unification to produce a maelstrom. Thus, they are already 
cooperating closely with Fred Eichner, 36, chairman of the 
banned National Bloc in Bavaria, and Meinolf Schoenborn, 38, 
chief of the banned Nationalist Front. 
  In addition, leading functionaries of the NPD youth 
organization Young National Democrats (about 200 members) are 
also looking for closeness to the troika. Young functionaries 
of the Liberal German Workers Party (FAP), which has about 400 
members and is facing a procedure for banning at the Federal 
Constitutional Court, are also pleased by the efforts for 
unification. FAP chief Friedhelm Busse, 64, who is an old Nazi 
and an opponent of the rightist unity front, is being isolated 
internally. 
  According to the Cologne Federal Office for the Protection 
of 
the Constitution [BfV], the militant neo-Nazi scene comprises 
about 2,500 activists, not including skinheads. The rightists 
do not lack young newcomers. The Brandenburg BfV analyzes "that 
the potential of rightist young people, who can be mobilized, is 
currently remaining approximately stable." 
  So far, bans have "not eased the burden greatly" for the 
rule-of-law state, Lothar Jachmann, deputy head of the Bremen 
Land BfV says. With the formula that "penetrating legalism" 
(Worch) must be practiced, the neo-Nazis are looking for forms 
of action against which there are no legal provisions. 
  Thus, DA chief Huebner ran in the Brandenburg local 
elections 
last December for the office of mayor of Cottbus on the ticket 
of the German League for People and Homeland, which split off 
from the Republikaner. With slogans against "lack of housing, 
excessive rents, and speculators" he managed to get 2.8 percent 
of the vote. 
  In the numerous election campaigns this year the militant 
neo-Nazis, who are nowadays mostly dressed inconspicuously and 
wear longer hair, will "mingle with the people quite normally" 
during rallies, says Oliver Kulik, 18, a former member of the DA 
and now head of the German Interests neo-Nazi work group in 
Berlin. 
  Before the Bundestag elections on 16 October the neo-Nazis 
want to mobilize their followers for a tactically motivated 
"action alliance for Republikaner to the Bundestag." They 
expect a strengthening of the entire right-wing extremist camp 
if the Republikaner and their chairman, Franz Schoenhuber, 71, 
get into parliament. 
  The strategists of the scene see themselves as virtually 
condemned to use such legalistic tricks. Their leading cadres 
are all known to the security authorities. And the right-wing 
extremists know from a classic of the movement that secret 
nationalist societies have little chance in Germany. 
  It is not possible, a brown ideologist complains in this 
classic book, "to establish an organization of reasonable size 
and, at the same time, keep it secret toward the outside." The 
reason for that is the "talkative nature of the German people." 
  This insight dates back to Adolf Hitler, to Mein 
Kampf.

CSO 

    [Editorial Report] 
<H8>  Old Parties' Losses, Greens' Gains Viewed </H8>
  German commentators widely remarked that the 20 March local 
elections in Schleswig-Holstein demonstrated that any fears of 
widespread voter apathy were unjustified, with some calling the 
results a "warning" to the established parties, and others 
seeing increased prospects for a Social Democratic-Greens 
coalition in Bonn. Most analyses, however, also conceded the 
dangers of drawing conclusions about national politics based on 
local electoral results. 
<H5>  High Turnout Welcomed </H5>
  Several commentators pointed to the high voter turnout in 
Schleswig- Holstein as a sign that concern over widespread 
popular alienation from politics was misplaced. About 70.4 
percent of eligible voters went to the polls--up slightly from 
69.4 percent during the last local elections in 1990--and 
turnout for the previous week's Lower Saxon state elections was 
at a similar level. Peter Heinacher, writing in the 22 March 
HANDELSBLATT, called the high turnout "the most apparent and, at 
the same time, most reassuring" result of the Schleswig-Holstein 
elections. A 22 March FRANKFURTER ALLGEMEINE commentary agreed, 
pointing out that there was "no sign of the weariness with 
voting" which had been predicted, and an article in the same 
day's TAGESZEITUNG virtually repeated this theme, noting that 
"the Germans apparently do not intend, after all, to tire of 
voting." 
<H5>  `Warning' to Old Parties Seen </H5>
  Less reassuringly, however, Herbert Kremp opined in the 22 
March DIE WELT that while "there is no frustration with 
politics...there is massive frustration with the established 
parties." All three traditional parties lost ground statewide 
compared to 1990, with the Social Democratic Party (SPD) 
declining from 42.9 to about 39.5 percent, the Christian 
Democratic Union (CDU) slipping from 41.3 to around 37.5 
percent, and the Free Democratic Party (FDP) dropping from 6.1 
to about 4.4 percent. Several commentators remarked on this 
development, contrasting it with the improved performance of the 
Greens (up from 6.0 to 10.3 percent), the Danish-minority 
Southern Schleswig Voters' Association (up from 1.6 to 2.6 
percent) and the state's characteristic Independent Voters' 
Associations (up from 1.2 to around 3.9 percent). Commentaries 
or related articles in the 22 March editions of the SUEDDEUTSCHE 
ZEITUNG, HANDELSBLATT, and DIE WELT described these results as a 
"warning" (Denkzettel) to the traditional parties, although the 
22 March FRANKFURTER ALLGEMEINE commentary was more cautious, 
arguing only that such results could signal "a slight turn away" 
from the "emphatically political parties." 
<H5>  `Red-Green Signals' Detected </H5>
  Some commentators highlighted the gains by the Greens--who 
had also increased their share of the vote in Lower Saxony--and 
pointed to them as a sign that an SPD-Green coalition at the 
federal level was a real possibility. The FRANKFURTER 
ALLGEMEINE commentary adopted the relatively understated view 
that the Greens had succeeded in increasing their vote to the 
"normal" level. Possibly referring to the perceived radicalism 
of the Greens' national platform, the commentator remarked that 
"apparently, a certain category of voter...cannot be prevented 
from voting for the Greens." Kremp, in the 22 March DIE WELT, 
saw a more dynamic trend with national implications, describing 
the Greens' progress as a "breakthrough" which is "taking place 
on a broad front in Germany," and specifically citing "red-green 
earnestness" as one clear lesson from the Schleswig-Holstein 
vote. Heinacher, however, drew the most explicit conclusions 
for the election's impact on the federal campaign. "After the 
Greens' successes in Lower Saxony and Schleswig Holstein," he 
wrote in his 22 March HANDELSBLATT commentary, "Red-green 
signals are going out from the far north toward Bonn." 
<H5>  Interpretive Risks Noted </H5>
  Most analyses, however, also pointed to the uncertainties 
involved in divining national trends from the results of local 
elections. "Regional particularities mix with countrywide 
trends," noted the SUEDDEUTSCHE ZEITUNG commentator, diminishing 
the vote's importance as a predictor of state or federal 
elections. Kremp expressed similar reservations in DIE WELT, 
describing any individual's vote as a combination of his 
"impressions of the chancellor, the opposition, and [each 
party's] local performance." A commentary in the 25 March DIE 
ZEIT went a step further, criticizing efforts to force a 
national interpretation on an essentially local event, "if 
necessary with a crowbar." Seeing little connection between 
local elections and national political trends, the DIE ZEIT 
analysis concluded with the admonition that "a local election is 
a local election is a local election."

<F P=106> ["ban, fy" report: "Criticism of Defense Minister's White </F>
Paper"] 
  [Excerpts] Bonn, 5 Apr -- The "White Paper on the Security 
of the Federal Republic of Germany and on the Situation and 
Future of the Bundeswehr" (1994 White Paper), which was 
presented by the Defense Ministry in Bonn on Tuesday [5 April], 
has been criticized as inadequate by defense politicians of the 
Free Democratic Party and the Social Democratic Party of Germany 
[SPD]. [passage omitted] 
  Florian Gerster, SPD defense expert and Rhineland-Palatinate 
Bundesrat minister, has called the White Paper a document of 
inadequacy. Decisive questions, such as how compulsory military 
service will be shaped in the future, what structures the armed 
forces will have in the future, and what has been changed about 
deployment, remain unanswered. Gerster added that the White 
Paper gives the impression that the central tasks of national 
defense are being treated by those responsible in politics as if 
they could be neglected. Instead of thinking about how the 
relationship between society and the armed forces could be 
improved, the White Paper concentrates completely on the 
establishment of highly mobile crisis reaction forces and of 
equipment that is conceived for missions outside Germany, and 
even outside Europe. 
  In fact, in Gerster's view, the use of the armed forces 
outside the country has become the actual new main task and has 
thus been made virtually superior to national defense. This new 
priority leads to the conclusion that the authors of the White 
Paper have embarked upon a new course in security policy, 
Gerster said. It is their goal to establish an interventionist 
army consisting of five brigades and the air and naval forces 
that are necessary for its use all over the world. The money 
that the Bundeswehr still gets is concentrated on the investment 
necessary for this purpose. The large remainder of the armed 
forces, on the other hand, is treated without kindness and even 
neglected. 
  Gerster said: "What is supposed to develop here is a new 
Bundeswehr, which the FRG does not need to defend its own 
country and which, in addition, would be based neither on the 
approval of the people nor on that of most of the young men 
eligible for military service who are supposed to serve in it." 
The lack of planning security, which has already existed for 
the troops and for the public so far, is not reduced by the 
White Paper but rather increased. "Only one thing is clear," 
Gerster said: "A Bundeswehr with 370,000 men cannot be 
maintained with these priorities and with financing that will 
probably hit an upper limit of about 47 billion German marks 
over the next few years."

<F P=106> ["df" report: "Organized `Warning Strikes' in Numerous </F>
Newspaper Companies"] 
  [Text] With organized warning strikes in numerous 
newspaper enterprises, the Media Trade Union wants to force the 
employers of the printing industry to negotiate on their basic 
wage demands and to make concessions regarding the collective 
wage agreement. The negotiations on both collective agreements 
have failed. The duty to maintain industrial peace resulting 
from the collective wage agreement ends on 30 April, but the 
duty under the basic wage agreement has already expired. Today, 
Wednesday, Professor Dr. Heinrich Reiter, chairman of the FRG 
Social Court, will try to mediate in Frankfurt. 
  The mediation proceedings will be very complicated and 
presumably lengthy because a solution has to be found for the 
basic wage agreement, the collective wage agreement, and the 
employers' employment initiative. An escalation of the 
industrial action of the Media Trade Union has to be expected. 
The chairman of the district of North Rhine-Westphalia stated 
that one is prepared for months of industrial action if no 
progress is made in the mediation process. In North 
Rhine-Westphalia alone, altogether 52 printing and newspaper 
companies were hit by several strikes in the past few weeks. 
Almost all major dailies were affected by them. The Media 
Trade Union has announced that it wants to involve additional 
staff in the industrial action every day. 
  The Media Trade Union calls for a 5-percent wage increase. 
The employers have stated that they are striving neither for a 
zero- nor for a minus-wage round. They are prepared to increase 
the wages if this is connected with an employment initiative -- 
that is, a 37-hour week with a corridor for longer and shorter 
working hours -- the inclusion of Saturday in the regular 
working hours, compensation for overtime by time off without any 
premium, and, for two years, a 10-percent wage reduction for 
newly employed unemployed who are older than 50 years. 
  Thus, this wage model is largely oriented according to the 
model of the previous wage agreements of this year, whose 
precedent the Media Trade Union, however, does not want to 
recognize, despite the bad economic situation of the printing 
industry. The employers' preparedness for lockouts as an answer 
to strike actions of the trade union is regarded as an unknown 
wage policy factor in this wage round.

<F P=106> [Unattributed report: "Necker Opposes Excessive Export </F>
Controls"] 
  [Text] Bonn, 6 Apr -- Tyll Necker, president of the 
Federal Association of German Industry, has called on the 
Federal Government to abandon the special rules concerning 
export controls to preserve the competitiveness of German 
enterprises. For over four years, Germany has had special rules 
applicable to goods that can serve both a civilian and military 
purpose (dual use). "Now is the time to adopt a uniform 
Europewide control system," wrote Necker in a letter to Federal 
Industry Minister Guenter Rexrodt (FDP) [Free Democratic Party]. 
The Federal Government should display a readiness to reach 
compromises on a European scale and abandon its "attitude of 
isolation" that even made the adoption of the special rules 
difficult. Necker called for uniform controls within the 
European Union [EU] and the abolition of internal EU controls 
that collide with the single-market principle. The practice of 
issuing permits must also be brought into line with this 
principle, he said. 
  Necker was replying to a letter he received from Rexrodt at 
the beginning of March in which the FDP politician had suggested 
changes to German subsidiary regulations. Rexrodt had said that 
goods that do not appear on a control list and are destined for 
use in conventional armaments might be made exportable to only a 
small nucleus of countries. The same applies to services and 
the transfer of sensitive knowledge. Necker described these 
proposals as "merely the first step." On the other hand, 
Rexrodt's announcement that there should be greater clarity and 
faster decisions concerning the issue of export permits for 
military goods has been welcomed by industry. During the 
administrative removal of obstacles, regaining German 
competitiveness and abolition of one-sided disadvantages to 
competition must be the primary goal, Rexrodt wrote.

<F P=106> [Dietrich Zwaetz commentary: "Clinton, the New Interest </F>
Rate Guru"] 
  [Text] One of a head of state's most important jobs is to 
keep his people in a good mood, which is beneficial to the 
further efforts of the country. At any rate, this is how Bill 
Clinton assesses his duties. It cannot be denied that the 
president's economic optimism has given a major impetus to the 
economy for well over a year. Sometimes, however, he also does 
the job of other experts and strains his abilities. 
  The dramatic price falls on Wall Street are certainly 
getting 
under the skin of the average U.S. citizen. To prevent a 
further collapse of prices, which might endanger economic 
recovery, Clinton felt compelled to make his view of the 
situation known. 
  As the President decreed, the long-term interest rates are 
"lower than during the preceding recession." But then he posed 
like a real interest rate guru: "Nevertheless, I believe that 
interest rates are too high. I think they will come down 
again." The stock exchange has "overreacted." 
  The most important thing is "to get through it now." This 
will be managed "if everyone keeps calm and the markets find a 
way out of it themselves." For: "We basically have a very solid 
economy." 
  Thus, why are the markets nervous? The President cannot 
understand it: "A lot of investments go to the economy, there 
is no inflation, and we are creating new jobs." One could 
examine the President's statements one by one. The markets will 
have to decide whether the interest rates are again too high. 
However, the decisive thing will be that the investors adhere 
to Clinton's appeal in view of such facts.

<F P=106> [Commentary by Lothar Ruehl: "Russia, Where Are You Going?"] </F>
  [Text] The internal development of Russia in its 
continuing crisis is having a backlash on Russian foreign policy 
and, beyond that, on the feelings of the Russians toward an 
alien outside world. The Zhirinovskiy phenomenon and the 
delaying tactics of the opposition in the State Duma against the 
Partnership for Peace with the Atlantic Alliance, as offered to 
Russia, are new examples for it. 
  However, it is most likely that such a Partnership for Peace 
will come about if Russia is conceded a relationship of 
"particular quality" with NATO, including adequate 
considerations for legitimate Russian interests and the 
recognition of Russia's position as a major power, as was 
recently demanded by Defense Minister Pavel Grachev in Bonn. 
After all, President Boris Yeltsin, The Russian military 
leadership and Russian diplomacy -- as represented by Foreign 
Minister Andrey Kozyrev -- are sticking to the declared 
intention to conclude such an agreement with NATO for the 
benefit of both sides. On the other hand, one must not ignore 
the flare-up of greater Russian chauvinism, including 
threatening gestures toward Russia's neighbors, particularly the 
former non-Russian peoples of the empire: The demands voiced by 
Vladimir Zhirinovskiy and Aleksandr Rutskoy to restore the 
imperial union within the borders of the USSR has cast warning 
signs across East Europe. 
  Zhirinovskiy's pan-Slav-Orthodox unity party, together with 
a 
clear turn against the West and Islam, has once more raised the 
question of Russia's orientation. Will it return to Europe or 
-- as frequently in the past -- will it seek to continue to 
isolate itself against the West and link East Europe again with 
a Russian empire in a firm bloc? 
  Zhirinovskiy's pan-Slav vision will turn out to be a chimera 
like that of his 19th century predecessors, Aksakov, Samarin, 
Fadeyev, Danilevskiy (the totalitarian philosopher of an 
all-Russian-pan-Slav utopia), Katkov, and Ignatyev, or that of 
the milder "neo-Slav" new edition of the beginning of this 
century. Any attempt politically to unite, for example, the 
Poles, Slovaks, Czechs, Slovenes, or Croats, let alone the 
Ruthenian-Galician West Ukrainians, under Russian leadership in 
a "Slav Union" in line with Zhirinovskiy's model, would fail 
merely as a result of these nations' determination for national 
independence along the cultural dividing line between the 
Latin-Catholic and the Byzantine-Orthodox cultural heritage of 
East Europe. 
  Thus, the Moscow Congress of Slav Peoples will not be able, 
either, to show the way to overcoming historical antagonisms, 
which 100 years ago, when religion and the pan-Slav idea were 
still creating a lot of emotion, set external limits to 
political pan-Slavism. Russia's Balkans policy suffered severe 
setbacks between 1875 and 1878, then again at the beginning of 
our century, in all the Balkan wars, even after military 
victories, and, finally, during the war in 1917, leading to the 
collapse of the Czarist Empire, whose borders have also been 
requested by Zhirinovskiy as has a new division of Poland 
between Russia and Germany. 
  What remains is -- apart from the illusionary pan-Slav 
appeal 
-- the strongly anti-Western orientation of the new 
nationalistic front line. With his turn against London and 
Paris, Zhirinovskiy is returning to Bolshevik foreign policy, 
which regarded Germany as a partner against West Europe, and 
which contributed to the isolation of the Soviet Union -- 
temporarily continued by Stalin until World War II, and 
transferred first of all to the United States after 1945. For 
Russia, this return would lead to becoming detached from Europe 
and isolated without the rank of a major power, because the 
foundations of Stalinist power policy cannot be restored. Times 
have changed since the collapse of the Soviet Union. 
  The impression created by the pan-Slav and 
all-Russian-imperialist appeal particularly in Ukraine, Poland, 
the Czech and Slovak Republics, and also in the Baltic countries 
and in Hungary, Slovenia, and Croatia, will even strengthen 
these countries' urge to move west near the protective umbrella 
of the Atlantic alliance. This will make it even more difficult 
for the NATO states to keep the necessary balance between the 
integration of East-Central Europe into the alliance and the 
equally necessary cooperation with Russia in a special 
"strategic partnership" for European security, as recently 
mentioned by Federal Defense Minister Volker Ruehe in St. 
Petersburg. 
  Yet a European balance as a basis for joint security and the 
extension of the alliance to those countries that feel 
politically and culturally part of West Europe and are also 
seeking European Union membership, is the precondition for the 
structural stability of the post-Soviet nations, including the 
freedom of peoples and independence in a European home of 
security. On the other hand, Russian participation will require 
moderation in Russian foreign policy and cooperation with the 
North Atlantic alliance on mutually acceptable conditions for 
preserving security in Europe without a "condominium" on the 
former allies of the USSR in an extraordinary political 
relationship -- as accepted by the Partnership for Peace 
principle. 
  President Yeltsin, his government and the Russian Army have 
a 
lot of interest in it because cooperation with NATO would 
stabilize them at home, too, and would prevent Russian 
isolation. This dual consolidation is now the most urgent task 
of joint security policy.

  [Text] Brussels, April 6 (AFP) -- The European Commission 
Wednesday [6 April] decided to take Greece before the European 
Court of Justice for imposing a blockade on its neighbour 
Macedonia [The Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia -- FYROM] 
in a dispute over its name. 
  European External Relations Commissioner Hans van den Broek 
said the decision was taken in the belief that the February 16 
trade blockade breached EU [European Union] rules, which provide 
for free trade between members and third parties. 
  The case will begin in Luxembourg on April 13, Van den Broek 
told a press conference here. 
  Greece disputes Skopje's right to call itself Macedonia, 
which it says implies territorial designs on the neighbouring 
Greek province of the same name. 
  Athens imposed the blockade, by preventing Macedonia-bound 
goods passing through the northern Greek port of Salonika, after 
a large number of countries recognized Skopje under the name The 
Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia. 
  Greece has justified its action by citing Article 224 of the 
European Union Treaty, saying that its security is under threat. 
The European Commission, the EU's executive arm, is the guardian 
of the Treaty. 
  Calls for Greece to be taken before the European Court of 
Justice have been opposed by some for political reasons: Athens 
currently holds the six-month EU presidency. 
  Van den Broek said here Wednesday that Athens had been asked 
to resume discussions with Skopje to try to resolve the dispute.

<F P=106> [Unattributed report: "EU Referendum on 12 June -- Accession </F>
Not Possible Before March 1996?"] 
  [Text] Vienna -- Dates were fixed in the Council of 
Ministers yesterday [6 April]: The referendum on the European 
Union [EU] membership is to be held on 12 June. Due to the 
ratification process, EU entry could be delayed until 1996. 
  The coalition and parliamentary leaders have now agreed on 
an EU accession schedule: The EU Accession Act is to be passed 
by parliament on 5 or 6 May, and it will be made subject to a 
referendum on 12 June -- not on 19 June, the alternative date 
that had been discussed. 
  Government circles say that the actual entry could be 
delayed 
until March 1996 due to the ratification process in the other 
countries. Vienna is not unhappy about this, these circles said 
yesterday. Any delay decreases compensation payments to be made 
to Austrian agriculture from public funds. 
  Negotiations on these compensation payments are proving most 
difficult. Time is running out: A decisive round of talks 
between government representatives, social partners, and 
representatives from the provinces has been scheduled for 
Tuesday [12 April]. As has been reported, the demands made on 
the government are in the double-digit 
billion-Austrian-schillings range. 
  Chancellor Franz Vranitzky said yesterday that the parties' 
agreement on Austria's accompanying measures to EU entry should 
be concluded by Friday next week.

  [Text] Sinn Fein president Gerry Adams has written to 
President Clinton explaining the background to the IRA's 72 hour 
ceasefire, according to a report today. 
  The report in today's Irish Times newspaper says the letter 
is known to have been delivered in the past few days to a senior 
member of the White House staff. 
  Mr Adams is said to have outlined to the president the 
circumstances behind the IRA's suspension of violence -- still 
holding on its second day -- and set out in detail the position 
of Sinn Fein. 
  He is also reported to have emphasised that the IRA was 
showing a willingness and flexibility despite criticism of the 
brevity of the ceasefire. 
  Mr Adams sent a letter to Prime Minister John Major 
yesterday 
urging him to authorise direct talks with Sinn Fein, but Downing 
Street again said there could be no such discussions unless 
violence was halted permanently. 
  In today's report, the Irish Times said it was not known if 
Mr Adams's letter had been read personally by the President. 
  But the U.S. Administration was not expected to respond, it 
added. 
  It said leading Irish-American figures had been noticeably 
silent on Sinn Fein's call for clarification of the Downing 
Street Declaration. 
  Influential Senator Edward Kennedy is also reported to have 
had a letter from Mr Adams and told the newspaper he hoped all 
sides would redouble their efforts. But he stopped short of 
calling on Britain to provide clarification. 
  Dublin premier Albert Reynolds, on holiday in Cyprus, has 
repeated through a government spokesman his appeal to the IRA 
for a longer ceasefire.

  [Text] Paris, April 6 (AFP) -- French Prime Minister 
Edouard Balladur left here Wednesday [6 April] for China hoping 
to set the seal on renewed friendly relations between the two 
countries. 
  Balladur's visit comes three months after Paris and Beijing 
finally made up following a row over French warplane sales to 
Taiwan in 1992, which cost French firms hundreds of millions of 
dollars in lost trade with China. 
  His three-day visit to Beijing starting Thursday -- the 
first 
by a French Government leader since 1978 -- is aimed at bringing 
French companies back into the Chinese market. 
  Balladur said Tuesday it was in France's interest to have 
close and friendly relations with China, which he said was one 
of the world's great powers. 
  But he remained cagey in the run-up to his three-day visit 
to 
Beijing about whether he would raise the issue of human rights 
with Chinese leaders, despite pressure from two French 
humanitarian groups to do so. 
  Press rights campaign group Reporters sans Frontieres urged 
Balladur to intervene on behalf of 24 imprisoned Chinese 
journalists, and the Support Committee for the Tibetan People 
called for help to suffering Tibetan and Chinese people. 
  Balladur, speaking Tuesday on French television, said France 
could not remain indifferent to human rights issues but when 
questioned he said he had no further comment on the arrest of 
leading dissident Wei Jingsheng. 
  Balladur's visit is the latest in a line of visits by 
Western 
leaders renewing relations with Beijing after its violent 
suppression of the pro-democracy movement in 1989.

  [Text] Turkey has stated that it will continue to give 
Albania all support and assistance to enable it to successfully 
accomplish its democratization process and economic reforms. 
  Albanian President Sali Berisha left Turkey after holding 
various contacts in Ankara and Istanbul. The joint 
Turkish-Albanian statement regarding Berisha's visit has been 
issued. 
  According to the information received by the Press Center of 
the President's Office, the two presidents had a comprehensive 
exchange of views on the regional and international issues 
concerning their respective countries. According to the 
statement, both presidents expressed their pleasure at the 
agreement envisaging the establishment of a federation between 
the Bosnians and the Serbs in Bosnia-Herzegovina. The statement 
further notes that discussions were held on the dangerous 
situation in the Balkans spreading to Kosovo, Sandzak, 
Vojvodina, and to the south. 
  The Turkish-Albanian statement notes that both presidents 
were of a common accord that the potential to further bilateral 
cooperation exists and agreed on focusing on the following 
issues: To fully support and facilitate Turkish investments in 
Albania; to better benefit from the joint economic commission 
and activities of the business council; to cooperate closely on 
the infrastructure project regarding telecommunication, 
maritime, air, and railroad transportation especially where it 
concerns the East-West Corridor Project which will connect 
Albania's Durres port to Bulgaria's Varna and then by means of 
TEM [Transit European Motorway] over Sofia to Istanbul; to 
further joint tourism and cooperation regarding tourism industry 
development; to open a branch of the Turkish Ziraat Bank in 
Tirana; to further cooperation between Turkish and Albanian 
state radio and television networks so that TRT television 
programs can be viewed in Tirana. 
  Meanwhile, the guest minister went on a boat trip in the 
Bosforus. The Albanian president also held a meeting with 
Turkish businessmen. Berisha said that although relations 
between Turkey and Albania accelerated considerably, Turkish 
investments in Albania are still far from reaching the desired 
level. Berisha called on Turkish businessmen to invest in his 
country. 
  In a statement prior to his departure, Berisha thanked the 
Turkish people and President Suleyman Demirel for their warm 
welcome. State Minister Nurhan Tekinel, Governor Hayri 
Kozakcioglu, Lieutenant General Selcuk Saka, and Foreign 
Ministry officials saw off the Albanian President at Istanbul's 
Ataturk Airport.

<F P=106> [Article by Finance Minister Theo Waigel: "The European </F>
Union Is Getting New Payers"] 
  [Text] Germany's payments to the European Community have 
been the focus of public discussion for the past few months. In 
this connection it is often ignored that important steps have 
already been taken to improve Germany's financial situation 
toward the EC. 
  Most recently, during the membership negotiations for 
Austria, Norway, Sweden, and Finland, I advocated Germany's 
financial interests without endangering the fair balance with 
the would-be members. I expressly welcome the enlargement of 
the European Union [EU] by the four EFTA [European Free Trade 
Association] states. These countries are an enrichment for the 
EC both in political and economic terms. The membership 
negotiations were successful for Germany also from the financial 
viewpoint: Three of the four would-be members are net payers of 
EC cash. With them we also gain important support for our 
efforts to implement the principles of thrift and strict budget 
discipline at the European level. Thus, already during the 
membership negotiations demands by other member states for 
internal EC compensation were successfully rejected. 
  We have achieved an important success in the negotiations on 
the new decision about the EC's own resources, which are the 
financial basis of the EC. According to this decision, in the 
future the EU Commission will explain which resources go to 
which member states. This will clarify the distribution effect 
of the EC budget. This newly created clarity was an 
indispensable condition for my basic agreement to this decision. 
On the one hand, this creates absolute clarity about the use of 
the tax money that is available to the EC. On the other hand, it 
shows potential distortions in payments, demonstrating the need 
to implement corrections. 
  At the negotiations about the EC's financial framework for 
1993 to 1999 we considerably restricted the original ideas of 
the EC Commission and of other member states. The suggested 
expansion of the EC's financial resources was postponed by two 
years; only 35 percent of the demanded increase in the EC's 
financial resources were approved. On the basis of the final 
year of 1999, this means that about 15 billion German marks will 
be saved. 
  As a result of the European Council meeting in Edinburgh in 
1992, after long and difficult negotiations the Council of 
Ministers came to a decision on 21 March 1994, which establishes 
an upper limit for more than half of the EC budget expenditures 
-- expenditures for agriculture -- for the next few years. 
Strict budget discipline for the EC budget must be applied to 
all spheres of expenditures. During the second half of 1994, 
when Germany holds the presidency, I will continue to 
emphatically insist on strict thrift. 
  To halt the flood of programs from Brussels, strict 
yardsticks of whether or not something can be rejected will be 
applied when new programs are presented or existing EC programs 
are to be continued. The Federal Government examines every 
proposal very thoroughly as to whether the EC should decide, 
implement, and finance certain measures at all from the 
viewpoint of subsidiarity. When the people in Germany are 
expected to accept some cuts because of the budget consolidation 
in the federal government, the laender, and the communities, 
achievements that one has grown fond of must also be examined at 
the EC level. There must not and will not be any taboos at the 
European level. Enforcing strict budget discipline in the 
circle of our EU partners will not be simple. However, there is 
no realistic alternative to that. 
  Our efforts to improve Germany's financial situation toward 
the EC cannot be exhausted just by saving. It is necessary to 
try out all possibilities that can lastingly improve our 
position. In particular, we will implement our financial 
interest in increased returns in connection with formulating 
expenditures if they cannot be avoided at the EC level because 
of their contents and scope and with distributing the means. 
Thus, for instance, we will insist on considerable EC 
participation in the current negotiations about the financing of 
trans-European networks in Germany. 
  The FRG will not call into question the EU decisions that 
were made, for instance, by the heads of state and government at 
the European Council meeting in Edinburgh in December 1992. We 
are and remain a politically credible, predictable, and reliable 
partner. Regardless of that, I will continue to work 
consistently toward achieving a gradual improvement of our 
financial situation in the EU in all fields of policy that are 
important for financing. 
  The financial aspect is only a partial aspect of 
integration. 
To fully assess the matter one must take into consideration the 
political and economic advantages that all member states derive 
equally from their membership in the EU. I share the view that 
was expressed by the German Bundesbank in its monthly report of 
November 1993. The advantages of a large unified market have a 
positive effect on the prosperity of all those who participate 
in the EU market and form the basis for the competitiveness of 
European companies on the world market. 
  European integration is the guarantor for peace in Europe 
and 
stability in the world. Unfortunately, in the Balkans one can 
still see every day how brittle peace is in view of crumbling 
structures and the resulting reemergence of nationalism.

Possible'"] 
  [Excerpt] Vienna -- On the occasion of the visit by his 
South African counterpart Roelof ("Pik") Botha to Vienna, 
Foreign Minister Alois Mock has appealed to the political 
leaders in Pretoria to make violence-free elections possible. 
Austria is watching the events in South Africa with great 
interest but also with considerable concern, Mock stressed in a 
press release on Thursday [7 April]. 
  The Austrian foreign minister said that the meeting between 
President De Klerk, African National Congress President Mandela, 
Zulu King Zwelithini, and Inkatha Chief Buthelezi is decisive 
for the preparation of the general elections on 27 April and for 
containing the wave of violence in South Africa. 
  Mock called on the participants in the meeting to do 
everything in their power to make it possible for all South 
African citizens to participate in the elections without fear of 
intimidation. [passage omitted]

<F P=106> [Report by Claus Reitan: "New Opinion Poll -- Largest </F>
Majority So Far in Favor of EU"] 
  [Excerpt] Chancellor Franz Vranitzky was right. The 
latest Euro-barometer by the Gallup research institute confirms 
his view that the referendum on Austria's accession to the 
European Union [EU] can only produce a clear majority in favor: 
Never before have those in favor led by such a clear majority 
as last week. If the Austrians were to vote on EU membership 
next Sunday, 49 percent would be in favor. Only 34 percent said 
they would vote against EU membership. In 400 telephone 
interviews, Gallup found that while there was a neck-and-neck 
race a year ago, the share of those in favor has increased by 15 
percent. At the beginning of March, when the outcome of the 
membership negotiations in Brussels was not yet known, only 47 
percent favored EU membership, while 40 percent were against it. 
Admittedly, the number of those still undecided has increased 
over the past few weeks -- from 13 percent at the beginning of 
March to 17 percent last week. 
  The question of how many people have taken a final decision 
on which way to vote in the June referendum has produced even 
more dramatic results. Only 60 percent have made up their minds 
so far -- 32 percent want to decide at the last minute. But 92 
percent want to take part in the referendum. 
  The increase in "pro-EU" voters might be so pronounced 
because the majority of Austrians hold a positive view on the 
outcome of the membership negotiations in Brussels. Exactly 50 
percent think that the politicians have achieved a great deal in 
the negotiations. Yet 39 percent judge the talks negatively, 
saying that "too little was achieved" in Brussels. 
  Public interest in Europe has increased enormously: 53 
percent of Austrians are "very" interested in the EU (March: 39 
percent), while only 18 percent are not interested in it at all 
(March: 29 percent). But only a quarter (24 percent) feel 
well-informed about EU membership, while 42 percent of Austrians 
consider themselves poorly informed or not informed at all.

  [Text] Geneva, Switzerland, April 7 (AFP) -- Trade 
negotiators agreed Thursday [7 April] on a compromise formula 
for including labor rights in the future work of the General 
Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT), to become the World Trade 
Organization, GATT said in an official announcement. 
  They said the compromise text, due to be officially accepted 
at next week's GATT ministerial conference in Marrakesh for 
signing the Final Act of the Uruguay Round of trade 
negotiations, does not refer specifically to international labor 
standards. 
  But it was agreed that the conference chairman, Uruguayan 
Foreign Minister Sergio Bonilla, should make a declaration in 
Marrakesh specifically mentioning the inclusion of the "social 
clause," for which the United States and France have pressed 
hard, in the working program of the future World Trade 
Organization. 
  Washington had threatened to delay the signing of the Final 
Act in the absence of a commitment to have the future World 
Trade Organization discuss workers' rights. It maintains that 
countries exporting goods made by low-paid workers enjoy an 
undue advantage in trade. Developing countries have opposed 
inclusion of this issue on the WTO agenda.

  [Text] Vienna April 7 SAPA -- Foreign Minister Pik Botha on 
Thursday [7 April] told the International Atomic Energy Agency 
in Vienna South Africa had committed itself to a safer world and 
called on other United Nations member states to do the same. He 
was speaking at a ceremony at which South Africa presented the 
agency with a symbolic plough, made from a dismantled nuclear 
device. 
  "We have dismantled our nuclear devices," said Mr Botha. "We 
have signed the Nonproliferation Treaty, the safeguards 
agreement and we have associated ourselves fully with the ban on 
chemical and biological weapons." 
  Mr Botha said the peace and security of the planet depended 
particularly on the will of advanced, industrialised powers with 
access to vast stockpiles of nuclear weapons and which consumed 
a large portion of the earth's resources. 
  "The technologies which the industrialised nations have made 
available to the world have improved the quality of life of a 
large proportion of humanity, although for the most part they 
remain out of reach of the poor, developing countries," he said. 
  "Some of the dramatic technological advances have also 
brought unintended negative consequences in their wake." 
  Poorer countries were faced with a two-fold problem, said Mr 
Botha. "They cannot enjoy the advantages of modern technology, 
but at the same time must face the negative consequences which 
that technology has brought with it."

<F P=106> [Article by Mia Doornaert: "Kremlin Blows Hot and Cold About </F>
Partnership for Peace -- NATO Waits To See Whether Russia Will 
Sign on 21 April"] 
  [Text] At NATO it is still not known whether a Russian 
delegation will come to sign the agreement on the Partnership 
for Peace [PfP] on 21 April. Foreign Minister Andrey Kozyrev 
had held out the prospect of this date, but since then Moscow is 
continuing to blow hot and cold about PfP. A day after the 
Foreign Ministry said that 21 April would "probably" be 
maintained, yesterday another interview appeared in which 
President Boris Yeltsin said that "Russia was not in a hurry." 
  "We hope and expect that Russia will come and sign on 21 
April, but that date has never been officially confirmed," a 
NATO source told us yesterday. 
  In the interview with the INTERFAX press agency, Yeltsin 
said 
that cooperation between NATO and Russia "would have to be 
different in scope and content from cooperation with other 
countries." He was thinking of a "special agreement which 
expressed the place and role of Russia in European and world 
affairs and the military power and nuclear status of our 
country." 
  This is where the problem lies. Russia does not want to be 
treated in the same way as the 14 countries from the former East 
Bloc which have so far joined the PfP. It is demanding a 
special partnership which, according to various statements, 
would mean among other things that NATO and Russia would jointly 
guarantee the security of the countries of Central and East 
Europe. 
  The latter point is resolutely rejected by these countries, 
which want no new form of Russian guardianship. Many of these 
countries, led by the four Central European countries, are 
pushing for full NATO membership, which Russia is opposing 
strongly. 
  NATO sources told us yesterday that in Russia there appeared 
to be some misunderstandings about the PfP, which the NATO 
summit of mid-January offered to all the member countries of the 
Conference on Security and Cooperation in Europe. 
  The 16 NATO countries invited these countries to cooperate 
with the alliance on the basis of their needs and possibilities. 
The PfP offers an extensive menu containing various forms of 
political and military cooperation for this purpose -- from help 
with drawing up military budgets to joint peacekeeping exercises. 
  Therefore cooperation takes place in various stages, 
according to a NATO source. "The first stage is signing a 
framework agreement, in which the country shows that it is ready 
to cooperate with NATO," the source said. "In a second stage 
the partners present a presentation document, in which they 
indicate the precise areas in which they want to cooperate. If 
agreement is reached on this with the NATO Council, then 
concrete cooperation can begin." 
<H5>  "Special" </H5>
  The source said that in this sense every agreement between 
the sixteen allies and a PfP member is a "special agreement," 
because every agreement is specifically designed to match the 
partner's wishes, needs and possibilities. "Once Russia has 
signed the framework agreement, it can put forward a 
presentation agreement which takes account of its specific 
needs," the source said. 
  The source did not think that the alliance would work out a 
special framework agreement for Russia. "The PfP was signed by 
the heads of state and government leaders of the 16 member 
countries," the source said. "I find it difficult to imagine 
that they would meet again to work out a special membership 
arrangement for Russia." 
  The NATO sources stressed that the alliance, "in contrast to 
what is sometimes claimed in Russia," was seeking a security 
structure in Europe "with Russia, not without Russia." At 
present, studies are being made in NATO to see how the future 
relationship between Russia and the alliance should look. "Of 
course this takes account of the status of Russia as a big 
country, a nuclear power, and permanent member of the Security 
Council," the source said. 
  At the end of February a delegation made up of the U.S., 
British and Spanish ambassadors to NATO flew to Moscow to 
convince Russia to join the PfP. In early March Kozyrev 
announced that Russia would sign the PfP framework agreement on 
21 April. But, since then, the services of President Yeltsin 
have sown doubt on the issue more than once. At NATO 
headquarters in Evere they are now waiting to see whether Russia 
will become the fifteenth partner on 21 April.

<F P=106> [Yngve Hellestol report: "Norway Receives a Reminder Over </F>
EEA Rules"] 
  [Text] EFTA's [European Free Trade Association] oversight 
body, the ESA [EFTA Surveillance Authority], has sent reminders 
to Norway and most of the other EFTA countries that are members 
of the EEA [European Economic Area] that they have not complied 
in full with the rules on information contained in the EEA 
agreement. 
  According to the EEA agreement, all EFTA countries must see 
to it that national legislation is in line with the EU [European 
Union] directives which apply in the single internal market. In 
total there are around 460 EU directives that have to be fitted 
into national legislation in the individual EFTA countries. It 
is EFTA's oversight body (ESA) in Brussels which has the task of 
checking that countries actually adjust their legislation. 
  Each individual EFTA country has an obligation to send 
information to the ESA about new legislation enacted and to 
enclose the text of new legislation. When the deadline for 
sending in this information ran out on 7 March, only Sweden of 
the EFTA countries had complied in full with its obligation to 
provide information. Norway, together with the other EFTA 
countries, was still lagging behind. These countries had 
provided about 90 percent of the information they are obliged to 
provide. The ESA, therefore, has set a new deadline for 30 
April. 
  ESA president Knut Almestad told AFTENPOSTEN that in formal 
terms there has been a breach of the EEA agreement, since the 
countries have not sent in the information they are obliged to 
send. If the missing information has still not been sent in by 
30 April, the ESA will have to give thought as to how to proceed 
with the matter -- and consider whether or not there has been a 
violation of the EEA agreement. 
  "A possible step thereafter would be to bring the matter 
before the EEA court," he said. 
  Almestad also stressed that the EFTA countries have done an 
impressive job in introducing a large number of EU directives in 
a very short time -- directives the EU countries themselves have 
adopted over the course of many years. 
  He said that the ESA will now go through all the material it 
has received to see whether the adjustments to legislation that 
have been made in the EFTA countries bring national legislation 
into line with the EU directives. 
  The EFTA oversight body (ESA) was set up as a result of the 
EEA agreement. The task of the ESA is to check that the EFTA 
countries meet the demands and follow the rules contained in the 
EEA agreement. Just under 100 people work at the ESA in 
Brussels, and the body is headed by Norway's Knut Almestad.

<F P=106> [Unattributed article: "European Audiovisual Industry </F>
Threatened by `Super 301' -- European Commission Considers Using 
Taxes To Support the Audiovisual Sector"] 
  [Text] Pressed by the Hollywood lobby, Washington is 
seriously threatening the Twelve with reprisals if they continue 
to protect their audiovisual production. 
  Europe succeeded in not making a commitment on the 
audiovisual sector within the GATT agreement reached on 15 
December 1993. In so doing, it stressed the idea that cultural 
creations are not products just like any others. Ever since 
then, however, U.S. Trade Representative Mickey Kantor has 
ceaselessly reiterated that the cultural exception was, for the 
United States, the "greatest disappointment in the Uruguay 
Round." 
  The annual report on "obstacles to trade," which was 
published last Thursday [31 March] in Washington, took up that 
issue at length again, listing the existence of broadcasting 
quotas for television and taxes on video cassettes and cinema 
tickets, which are deemed to discriminate against U.S. 
producers. The producers in question are particularly concerned 
by the 40-percent quota of French songs that France intends to 
impose from 1996 onward on the airwaves covered by its 1,700 
radio stations -- a step that would result in a 30-percent 
reduction in the amount of U.S. music broadcast. 
  The report also pinpoints Italy for the tax reductions 
awarded to cinemas showing nationally produced films, and Spain, 
which requires that anybody seeking to distribute non-European 
dubbed films within its borders must secure authorization to do 
so. This requirement is costing U.S. companies "more than $15 
million per year." 
  Mickey Kantor has pointed out that he would not hesitate to 
resort to the so-called Super 301 clause (which enables 
President Clinton to impose sanctions on any country suspected 
of unfair trade practices and which refuses to open up its 
market more to U.S. products) in an attempt to preserve the 
dominance on European screens by the major Hollywood studios. 
  According to Washington, the fact that the audiovisual 
sector 
has escaped from its obligation to open up markets as enshrined 
in the 15 December GATT agreement gives them every freedom to 
resort to exerting bilateral pressure. 
  On the other hand, this argument is firmly rejected by GATT 
Spokesman David Woods. He believes the audiovisual sector is 
actually covered by the agreement, namely by the procedures 
provided for resolving conflicts. Consequently, according to 
this line of reasoning, if the United States wants to take 
action against the European Union (EU) in this sector, it will 
have to respect the rules laid down by GATT or the World Trade 
Organization (WTO), which will replace GATT in 1995. 
<H5>  Eurotaxes? </H5>
  Meanwhile, the Commission says it is "ready," with the EU 
member states, "to consider introducing a system of indirect 
taxes to support the European audiovisual industry." In its 
white paper on the EU audiovisual policy, which it will probably 
adopt on Wednesday, the Commission believes these indirect taxes 
(levied on the prices of cinema tickets, advertising revenue, 
and video rental charges) already imposed by some member states 
could be extended to apply throughout the EU.

<F P=106> [Interview with Jerome Monod, Lyonnaise des Eaux-Dumez CEO </F>
and president of the European Roundtable of Manufacturers, by 
Colette Menguy; place and date not given: "Ambitious Program 
Will Create Jobs Immediately"] 
  [Text] [Menguy] The ERT (European Round Table of 
Manufacturers), which you chair, favors the implementation of 
the European infrastructure program proposed by the European 
Commission in its white paper. What are your motives? 
  [Monod] As early as 1984, the ERT had drawn the attention of 
political and economic circles to the need to give a new start 
to infrastructure building in Europe. Today, the ERT is 
completing a report on major East-West infrastructures. The 
report looks at road, rail, and airport networks, large pipeline 
systems, major energy transmission systems, and lists -- without 
defining them rigidly on a map -- essential pathways likely to 
connect at once the economy, people, and ideas. There will, of 
course, be a chapter on telecommunications and electronic 
highways between East and West Europe. 
  [Menguy] So you believe that the time has come to invest in 
infrastructure? 
  [Monod] The times are quite ripe for such new projects. In 
the current context, recovery measures taken jointly at the 
European level would give a new lease on life to European 
economies, which have become too interdependent for a single 
country to reap much benefit from isolated measures. This is a 
unique opportunity to build infrastructure directed at Central 
and East European countries. The best way to accelerate trade 
with these countries is to anchor them to the European Union. 
  [Menguy] How do manufacturers view the program? 
  [Monod] Manufacturers throughout Europe are very keen on 
this program of physical and realized connections, because they 
believe it is an essential ingredient for growth. And, above 
all, it should create new jobs quickly. 
  [Menguy] Immediately? 
  [Monod] Yes. This is because the programs are ready. Out 
of the 26 projects listed by the Commission, some can be 
initiated without delay, which means that they can create jobs 
right away. 
  [Menguy] Is implementation of this program so slow because 
of funding difficulties? 
  [Monod] Funding is available. The problem is a lack of will 
to achieve things at the European level. This is a matter of 
national selfishness; everybody is only interested in what 
benefits them directly. To be sure, the most widespread notion 
is that the program will put pressure on national budgets. 
  This is both true and untrue. None or very few of these 
projects can be achieved without a degree of intervention from 
national or European authorities. Funding can be arranged in 
many ways, be it through state-guaranteed loans, mixed funding 
with the European Investment Bank or the EBRD [European Bank for 
Reconstruction and Development], where East Europe is concerned, 
or revenue guarantees for concession projects. There is also an 
idea put forward by Pehr Gyllenhammar, Volvo's former president: 
issuing bonds modeled after the Eurobonds popular in the United 
States; such bonds could be guaranteed by the European 
Community, but would draw on international investment (from 
European countries as well as others). I will also mention the 
Eurotunnel experience, a gigantic undertaking which was funded 
through more than 100 banks as well as private investors.

<F P=106> [Article by Philippe Gallard: "Who's Part of the Frigate Is </F>
This?"] 
  [Text] Although it could have been the naval counterpart of 
the Airbus, produced by an almost perfect European partnership, 
the building of a new type of antiaircraft frigate is causing 
numerous conflicts between the English, French, and Italian 
partners as they fight over the pieces. 
  "Cooperate." This is the ever recurrent theme of the white 
paper on defense, the hobby horse of politicians. If you run 
out of funds to cover your needs, cooperate, they declare to 
both the military and industry, adding that, as a bonus, it will 
contribute to the establishment of a joint European defense 
structure. This is more easily said than done. The most recent 
and spectacular cooperation program (40 million French francs 
[Fr] committed by France over 10 years) is suffering, like a 
caricature, from all the shortcomings that can affect 
international projects. True, it brings together no less than 
the Royal Navy, French Navy, and the Italian Navy for the joint 
development of large antiaircraft frigates. 
  The program is called Horizon, but its skyline is low 
because 
of the successive storms. It came into being following Margaret 
Thatcher's decision, five years ago to back out of the program 
under which seven NATO countries were building a frigate that 
was to resemble a veritable tower of Babel. The new program, 
however, is not benefiting from the reduction in partners to 
three, because, of course, they are all expressing different 
needs. The negotiations between the industrial partners, taking 
place one month in Paris, then in Glasgow, then in Rome, 
resemble a big poker game, where each player believes he knows 
everything and that the status quo should last. None of the 
partners want to release any know-how, and each partner is 
trying to recuperate the maximum number of jobs. In this 
cooperative project, three is definitely a crowd or, in the 
words of Jean-Paul Sartre, "Hell is someone else." 
  The distribution of the work has rapidly become a bone of 
contention. "We have three or four times the number of frigates 
to replace than the French or the Italians and must, therefore, 
carry more weight in the repartition of the workload," say the 
British. "False, you will never replace all of your old 
antiaircraft frigates," reply the French, adding that the 
current discussions only relate to a first lot of three frigates 
anyway.... Despite this, they continue to take note of all of 
the declarations made in the House of Commons regarding the real 
needs of the Royal Navy. Other questions include: If each 
country provides one-third of the financing, should it 
automatically benefit from 33 percent of the industrial 
workload, or should the best economic solutions be sought 
without worrying about the nationality of the suppliers? "We 
agree with the latter solution, but with a ceiling fixed in 
advance, for example, at 40 percent for the country with the 
best proposals," say the French, "and without our losing ground 
in any of our specialities, because we need to build other 
boats," adds the French team leader Michel Gevrey of DCN [Naval 
Contructions Directorate] International. Reassured by these 
demands, French engineers have no objection to dividing up the 
frigate into 30 or so pieces, each with its own prime 
contractor, provided that the two other partners are present as 
assistants. We are a long way here from the naval Airbus! 
  However, the battles are likely to be the hardest with 
regard 
to the definition of the antiaircraft defense systems, which are 
the frigates' raison d'etre in the first place. Each frigate 
will be equipped with almost Fr3 billion worth of electronic 
equipment and is destined to carry the Aster antiaircraft 
missile developed by the French company Aerospatiale and the 
Italian company Alenia. With only slightly different needs, the 
two partners were able to subcontract the workload easily: to 
the French Thomson, the Arabel radar designed to guide the 
short-range Aster-15 missiles; and to the Italian Alenia the 
Empar radar that will guide the longer-range Aster 30 missile. 
The British, however, want a more sophisticated radar, of 
British design of course. The problem is that the radar in 
question, the British Mesar, only exists on paper. "If the 
British Navy makes a point of developing the Mesar, it will mean 
at least a five-year delay for everyone involved," fulminated 
Enrico Gimelli, the managing director of Alenia, last week. 
Within a month, the 60 engineers from the three countries will 
have to find a compromise in the Rome-based joint program office 
led by the Frenchman Herve Guillou. If not the whole program 
could be put into jeopardy. A cloudy Horizon indeed.

<F P=106> [EC press release No. IP/94/278: "The Commission Decides To </F>
Refer the Greek Embargo of the FYROM to the European Court of 
Justice"] 
  [Text] The [European] Commission today decided to refer the 
embargo established by the Greek Government against the FYROM 
[The Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia] to the European 
Court of Justice. The Commission's decision is based on article 
225 of the EC treaty which applies to cases in which article 224 
has been cited unjustifiably by a member state in support of 
unilateral measures which would otherwise be in violation of 
Community law. 
  The implementation of the decision is suspended until 13 
april 1994. 
  At the same time, the Commission issued an appeal to the 
governments of Greece and FYROM to renew their dialogue in an 
effort to resolve the points in contention between them. The 
Commission called upon FYROM to reconsider its position on 
questions in contention regarding its constitution and flag as 
part of a search for a simultaneous solution to all outstanding 
issues including the name of the state. The Commission is 
continuing its efforts to facilitate the resumption of dialogue 
between Athens and Skopje and is in touch with all the parties 
concerned, in close liaison with Mr. Cyrus Vance, the United 
Nations mediator, and with Mr. Mathew Nimetz, the United States 
envoy. 
  On 16 february, the Greek Government took unilateral 
measures 
towards FYROM aimed at preventing trade through the port of 
Thessaloniki of goods coming from or going to FYROM as well as 
the import into Greece of products from FYROM. Since then, the 
Commission has repeatedly been in contact with the Greek 
Government in order to ascertain and to evaluate the reasons put 
forward to justify the embargo. 
  As these arguments, which are based on article 224 of the EC 
[Euroepan Commission] treaty involve political considerations 
related to public security in Greece and the risk of war, they 
were discussed by the European Union's foreign ministers at 
their meeting in Ioannina on 27 march 1994. This discussion 
confirmed the Commission's doubt as to whether these arguments 
are well-founded and as to whether the measures are compatible 
with Greece's obligations under the EC treaty, particularly in 
the areas of customs union, the common commercial policy and the 
internaL market. Despite calls upon Greece by the Commission and 
by the foreign ministers to lift the measures, they still remain 
in force. 
  Accordingly, as guardian of the treaty and as an institution 
responsible for ensuring the consistency of the Union's external 
activities, the Commission has decided to bring this question 
before the European Court of Justice.

<F P=106> [Unattributed article: "Commission Reacts to New U.S. Report </F>
on Obstacles to Trade"; as released by Brussels EUROPE] 
  [Text] Brussels, 5 Apr 94 (AGENCE EUROPE) -- The European 
Commission spokesman reacted with the following spoken comment 
following the publication by the United States representative 
for trade relations of the new American report on obstacles to 
trade: 
  "1. The American report arrives before the Marrakesh 
conference but the USTR [U.S. Trade Representative] is obliged 
by the Trade Act of 1988 to submit this report each year no 
later than 31 March. As usual, this report, which is the 9th, 
takes stock of all the significant trade barriers, whether or 
not in compliance with international rules. 
  ``2. Compared with last year, the 1994 report is 
considerably better: Firstly, because there are few new 
practices, secondly, because the United States recognizes that a 
large number of problems are solved in the Uruguay Round, 
thirdly, because it has a United States/European Union dialogue 
that enables limiting and solving problems at their initial 
stage, like for example, through the negotiation of agreements 
for the mutual recognition of technical standards as well as 
regulatory cooperation. 
  ``3. The Commission remains concerned about the particular 
nature of Super 301 which makes this report the point of 
departure of procedure 301 whose next step will be identifying 
`priority practices' on 30 September 1994 which will determine 
the future action of the USTR. 
  ``4. Likewise, the Commission is concerned about the 
potential of application of unilateral measures which the USTR 
might take on the basis of Title Seven of the Trade Act 
(deadline 30 April 1994) and on the basis of Special 301 
(deadline 30 May 1994) for public procurement and intellectual 
property respectively. 
  ``5. In conclusion, all these American reports become an 
ordinary event of the agenda of American trade policy. For 
their part, the Commission's services limit themselves to a 
single annual report, which should be out in the forthcoming 
weeks.'' 
  The following remarks can be made regarding this statement 
by 
the spokesman: 

  -  point 1 obviously aims to make less alarming 
the fact that the United States has published a report of this 
kind two weeks before the signature of the Uruguay Round. It is 
not a blunder or intimidation on the part of the Americans but a 
coincidence of dates imposed by the calendar of the 1988 Trade 
Act. As for the Commission, it will publish its report on the 
obstacles to trade practised by the United States (and by other 
countries) after the Marrakesh meeting; 
  -  in point 2, underlining 
that the American report denounces few "new practices," the 
Commission obviously refers to the practices for which the 
European Union is criticized (whereas Japan, for example, is the 
subject of more numerous criticism); 
  -  point 3 must be understood 
in the light of the Super 301 procedures. The indication of 
obstacles to trade in the report will serve as a basis for the 
implementation of other phases of the procedure: designation 
before 30 September of countries which maintain obstacles 
considered unacceptable; opening of negotiations with these 
countries with a view to eliminating these obstacles; in case of 
failed negotiations, possibilities for the United States to 
introduce restrictive measures. 
  EUROPE adds that the new 281-page American report devotes 42 
pages to Japan, 25 to the European Union, and the rest primarily 
to China, South Korea, Russia, Argentina, Brazil, Canada, 
Hungary, Mexico, Taiwan. The obstacles for which the European 
Union are criticized are on the whole the same already indicated 
in last year's report (particularly in the sector of public 
procurement), with nevertheless particular emphasis on the 
audiovisual sector. In the absence of provisions on this 
subject in the framework of the Uruguay Round, the United States 
is of the view that this sector falls under the application of 
the general rules of the GATT forbidding restrictions and 
discriminations, and they directly attack "broadcasting quotas" 
for television and destination of taxes on video cassettes.

<F P=106> [EC press release No. IP/94/279: "The Commission Adopts the </F>
Green Paper on Audiovisual Policy"] 
  [Text] The Commission today adopted, on the initiative of 
Mr. Joao De Deus Pinheiro, commissioner in charge of audiovisual 
and culture, the green paper entitled "Strategic Options To 
Strengthen the European Programme Industry in the Context of the 
Audiovisual Policy of the European Union." 
  The Audiovisual Industry is a large, complex sector 
currently 
undergoing fundamental changes, brought about in particular by 
rapid technological developments. These changes are causing new 
interactions between the different cultural, technological and 
industrial components of the industry. They are also generating 
new audiovisual products and services reflecting the multimedia 
and interactive approach of the information society. These 
developments are creating new openings for operators who will 
have to adapt their strategies and forge new alliances. The 
sustained growth of the audiovisual sector is set to continue, 
thereby generating great potential in terms of creation of 
highly skilled jobs. These phenomena are all present at world 
level and it is not yet possible to gauge them fully. 
  This green paper and the debate to which it should give rise 
focus on one specific aspect of the audiovisual sector: the 
development of the European film and television programme 
industry. 
  The Commission is aware of the difficulty of isolating this 
aspect among the many problems connected with the changes in the 
sector. But it believes this exercise to be necessary to take 
account of two characteristics of the programme 
industry: 

  -  Films and television programmes are not products 
like any others: as the prime vectors of culture they retain a 
specific place in the midst of the manifold new types of 
audiovisual products; as living testimony to the traditions and 
identity of each country they deserve encouragement; 
  -  The 
programme industry is (and will be even more so future) a 
strategic element in the development of the audiovisual sector: 
as recent developments show, the most powerful operators on the 
world market (equipment manufacturers and cable and 
telecommunications operators) are seeking to control the most 
important programme catalogues. 
  The Commission's analysis, taking account of technological 
developments, convergence of industries and the changing market 
structures, already identifies four fundamental requirements for 
the future of the European programme industry: 

  -  It must be 
competitive in an open worldwide market; 
  -  It must be 
forward-looking and be involved in the development of the 
information society; 
  -  It must illustrate the creative genius and 
the personality of the people of Europe; 
  -  It must be capable of 
transforming its growth into new jobs in Europe. 
  The essential problem can therefore be summed up as follows: 
how can the European Union contribute to the development of a 
European film and television programme industry which is 
competitive on the world market, forward-looking and capable of 
radiating the influence of European culture and of creating jobs 
in Europe? 
  To take into account the analyses and suggestions from 
audiovisual professional circles in the [European] Union, the 
[European] Commission, in preparing this green paper, conducted 
wide-ranging preliminary consultations during which three types 
of contribution were received: 

  -  From professional circles 
and in particular those associations representing the 
audiovisual industry at European level; 
  -  The report by the think 
tank set up last november on the Commission's initiative; 
  -  The 
competent authorities of the member states were asked to submit 
their views. 
  From the mass of contributions received, it was seen that 
though there were some contrasting, not to say conflicting, 
views on what instruments should be used to implement the 
Union's audiovisual policy, there was virtually unanimous 
agreement on the following points, confirming the need for 
wide-ranging debate on the future on the audiovisual industry in 
Europe: 

  -  The audiovisual industry is a special case amongst 
the high-growth industries, in particular with the possibilities 
it offers for job creation; 
  -  The safeguarding of the diversity of 
national and regional cultures, often expressed in terms of 
maintaining the choice available to the public, is now clearly 
linked to the development of a predominantly European programme 
industry which must ultimately be profitable; 
  -  Digital 
compression technology is seen as revolutionary because it 
appears set to transform the sector, accentuating the strategic 
role of the programme industry; 
  -  If the European Union wants to 
strengthen its audiovisual policy, it must act quickly, 
otherwise it will be overtaken by the rapidly developing 
technology and the unavoidable liberalization of the industry at 
international level. 
  While this green paper broadly reflects these points on 
which 
there is consensus, it is mainly concerned with initiating a 
wide-ranging debate on the options the European Union should 
take for the future on the basis of three lines of actions: the 
rules of the game, financial incentives and convergence of 
national support systems. 
  The green paper will be the subject of in-depth 
consultations 
of professional and institutional circles, in particular at the 
European Audiovisual Conference organised by the Commission at 
the end of June 1994. The Commission will then submit proposals 
for concrete measures to the European Parliament and the Council 
of Ministers in early autumn.

  [Text] Paris (DPA) -- Deutsche Aerospace (Dasa), French 
Aerospatiale, and British Aerospace have agreed on joint 
research for a new supersonic passenger plane. This program, 
PERS, has the goal of producing a follow-up model for the 
French-British Concorde in the next century, the companies 
announced on Thursday [7 April]. 
  The work, which extends over several years, would be 
financed 
by the three companies in equal shares. According to the plans, 
the new plane is to have a range of 10,000 km and be able to 
carry 250 passengers. It is to fly with a speed of 2,000 km per 
hour (Mach 2). The companies pointed out that long-distance 
flying is increasing constantly. It is estimated that, in the 
year 2005, 50 million people per year will fly either across the 
Atlantic, from Europe to Asia, or from Asia to North America. 
Given the fact that 500 to 1,000 planes will then probably be 
wanted on the market, only some kind of supersonic plane can be 
profitable. 
  The three companies pointed our that, within a greater 
framework, in which U.S., Italian, Japanese, and Russian 
companies are included, they also participate in research for a 
second-generation supersonic passenger plane. The development 
costs for such a plane are estimated by experts at $12 to $15 
billion.

<F P=106> [Article signed JLV: "Belgian Government Condemns Attack </F>
and Demands Impartial Inquiry"] 
  [Text] Brussels, 7 Apr (BELGA) -- A press release from the 
Belgian Foreign Ministry in Brussels stated: "The Belgian 
Government was astounded to learn of the brutal attack on the 
aircraft carrying the presidents of Burundi and Rwanda, and 
firmly condemns this crime which could seriously threaten the 
precarious balance of power in these two countries." 
  The press release added that the Belgian Government 
considers 
it is "vital for an impartial inquiry to be set up to find the 
guilty parties," and it "appealed to all leaders to calm their 
people, to condemn all forms of violence, and to preserve the 
path of peace and the process of democratization." 
  Presenting its condolences to the respective governments of 
Rwanda and Burundi and the families of the victims, the Belgian 
Government communique concluded by reiterating that "only by 
respecting human integrity and the commitments undertaken can 
the people of these two countries be protected from the scourge 
of civil war." It added that "Belgium attaches major importance 
to these principles that guarantee the continuation of its 
policy toward these countries."

<F P=106> [Article signed KVB: "Netherlands Submarine Spies Along the </F>
Coast of Former Yugoslavia"] 
  [Text] Den Helder, 6 Apr (ANP) -- A Netherlands Navy's 
submarine has been sailing up and down the coast of the former 
Yugoslavia on military espionage mission exercise for some time 
now. This was revealed Tuesday evening [5 April] during a forum 
organized by the Royal Navy Institute of Den Helder. 
  The submarine crew, using sophisticated equipment, 
eavesdrops 
military communications between Bosnian and Serbian troops. 
Tactical and strategic information, which may be of importance, 
is made available to UN peaceforce commanders in the former 
Yugoslavia. PvdA [Labor Party] Defense Spokesman Van Traa said 
that Netherlands espionage for UNPROFOR [UN Protection Forces] 
had revealed some interesting military events, which Van Traa 
did not specify. 
  The Defense Ministry recently reported that a fire had 
broken 
out on board the submarine, causing breathing problems to some 
of the crew members. Not a word was said about the submarine's 
special duties. 
  When asked, W. Van Straten, head of the Navy Information 
Service, said that he was able neither to confirm nor to deny 
the submarine's espionage mission. "The duties and 
possibilities of Netherlands submarines are described in defense 
notes without any further comment," the spokesman said.

<F P=106> [Press release issued by the UK Central Statistical Office: </F>
"Government Deficit and Debt Under the Maastricht Treaty"] 
  [Text] First estimates show that on the ESA [European 
System of Integrated Accounts] basis for the United Kingdom in 
the calendar year 1993: 
  The general government financial deficit was 7.7 percent of 
gross domestic product, compared with 6.4 percent in the 
previous year. 
  The general government gross debt outstanding at the end of 
the calendar year (nominal value) was 48.2 percent of GDP, 
compared with 41.7 percent at the end of the previous year. 
  The Treaty establishing the European Union requires member 
states to endeavour to avoid excessive government deficits, and 
to report their planned and actual deficits and the levels of 
their debt promptly to the European Commission. These figures 
must be on a common basis as defined in the ESA. 
  The Treaty does not determine what constitutes excessive 
debt 
or deficits. That is a matter of judgement, taking account of 
other relevant factors spelled out in the Treaty. But it does 
provide for a reference value of 3 percent of GDP for deficits 
and 60 percent of GDP for debt. 
  For consistency with other member states figures are 
reported 
on a calendar year basis, but in the United Kingdom government 
finances are planned on a financial year basis, and are focused 
on the public sector borrowing requirement (PSBR). 
  The public sector borrowing requirement for the calendar 
year 
1993 rose by 14.1 billion pounds, compared with a corresponding 
rise of 21.2 billion pounds in the previous year. These 
increases are reflected in the general government financial 
deficit, which was 48.3 billion pounds in 1993, compared to 37.8 
billion pounds in the previous year. 
  Accruals adjustments are the difference between the accrued 
transactions recorded in the current account and the associated 
cash flows. Between 1992 and 1993 accruals adjustments changed 
by 3.1 billion pounds and were largely due to changes in the 
amounts due to the goverment in taxes and social security 
contributions. Outstanding debt is affected by valuation changes 
as well as transactions. 
  The general government borrowing requirement may be financed 
by net sales of assets as well as by borrowing. Changes in the 
level of debt outstanding result from borrowing and changes in 
the valuation of liabilities.

<F P=106> [Article by Sinn Fein President Gerry Adams: "Bridge Over </F>
Troubled Doubters"] 
  [Text] The three-day suspension of operations by the IRA 
which began at midnight is unconditional and unilateral. It is 
significant and unprecedented. It comes in the wake of a series 
of negative and unhelpful signals from the British government 
and in the face of London's refusal to communicate with Sinn 
Fein. 
  Yet to listen to Downing Street, or to the Unionist 
spokespersons and their allies, one would imagine that the IRA 
had announced a nuclear strike instead of a temporary halt to 
its actions. 
  But it's only for three days, the begrudgers lament. Fair 
enough. Most republicans can accept such criticism from John 
Hume or Albert Reynolds or others who have been concerned to 
promote the peace process. Seventy-two hours isn't a long time. 
But for the IRA to suspend actions at all is a very meaningful 
step, and especially at this time. 
  All of us who are concerned or involved with the peace 
process are committed to bringing about a total and permanent 
end of armed actions by all armed groups. Our quest for peace 
will not be satisfied with temporary suspensions by one group, 
though these are welcome as part of the effort to achieve a 
lasting peace. The significance of the IRA initiative does not 
lie in its duration. 
  It was at this time last year, on Easter Sunday, that news 
about my talks with John Hume first emerged. Since then 
revelation has followed revelation. Few could have predicted at 
Easter 1993 that the situation could have been moved forward so 
much or that such a potential for further movement could have 
been created. There is now a new focus on the Anglo-Irish 
conflict, on the need for a negotiated settlement and on the 
core issues involved. All of this has had a major effect 
internationally and it has opened up a new potential, 
particularly in the US. Peace in Ireland is now on everyone's 
political agenda, despite the best efforts of some elements to 
go back to the failed policies of the past. 
  The Downing Street Declaration marks a stage in the peace 
process. It also marks the beginning of what has become a 
stalemate because, when it launched the declaration, the British 
government also stalled the peace process by erecting a 
roadblock around the issue of clarification for Sinn Fein. 
  The IRA announcement shows a willingness and flexibility by 
its leadership. It creates the opportunity for Sinn Fein and 
the London government to remove the block so that the peace 
process can move forward. Sinn Fein wants to move out of this 
very critical phase. The British government should seek to meet 
us half way. This does not mean negotiation, which is for a 
further stage in the process. 
  If the London government does not seek to engage with Sinn 
Fein, how does it intend to make progress? How does it expect 
to make peace if it seeks only to marginalise the people who 
vote for Sinn Fein? It has already admitted that the IRA cannot 
be militarily defeated. How does it hope to end the war if it 
refuses to build a peace process? Mr Major cannot argue that 
there is a basis for peace unless he can produce and explain 
what it is. 
  The Dublin government has been concerned to do this.London, 
so far, has not. Yet the British government talked with us for 
three years while activities by the British Army, loyalists and 
the IRA continued. What is the logic in holding up the peace 
process now? How does the London government aim to move forward 
if it does not deal directly with representatives of our party? 
  Sinn Fein has an electoral mandate. The rights of those who 
support us have to be upheld by us. No amount of exclusion 
orders, or censorship or coercion will change this. We have 
been shot, bombed, imprisoned and demonised. Through it all we 
have retained a willingness to move forward. 
  We are not concerned to force a public climb-down by John 
Major. We will be flexible. It has been said that we are 
attempting to embarrass Major. This is not the case. Of 
course, like every other party, we are concerned to promote our 
views but it a paradox of our time that republicans would prefer 
Major to be in a stronger position. His weakness limits the 
ability of all sides to manoeuvre. 
  That is one of the lessons of last year when proposed 
meetings between Sinn Fein and the British government floundered 
upon Major's dependancy on the unionists and his own right wing. 
It is worth recalling that the IRA was asked by the British to 
suspend operations for two weeks in order to enhance the 
potential of those meetings. As is now well known, the IRA 
agreed to this request. That was last May. A lot has happened 
since to make all involved cautious. But Sinn Fein has been 
concerned to prevent this from derailing the peace process. 
  It has also been alleged that we seek to divide the London 
and Dublin governments. On the contrary, we seek meaningful 
agreement between London and Dublin and a process led by them 
and involving all other parties so that a new, agreed, Ireland 
can be built by all the people of this island. 
  So we have questions to ask of London and we require direct 
dialogue, not protracted deliberations or negotiations so that 
answers can be provided to us as they have been to other 
parties. The areas which require clarification are: 
  1. Matters of text in what is an ambiguous declaration. 
  2. Differences in interpretation and commentary of the 
declaration. 
  3. The steps envisaged to advance the peace process. If we 
are being told that Britain no longer has any selfish interest 
in Ireland, and that the only problem today is the legacy of the 
past -- the divisions among the people in Ireland -- then it is 
obvious that this division can only be healed by agreement. 
  In these circumstances, is it unreasonable to ask the 
British Government what process, timeframe and framework it 
proposes for reaching such agreement? Is it unreasonable to seek 
to establish Britain's longterm intention towards Ireland? 
These fundamental questions deserve fundamental answers. 
  Furthermore, direct dialogue would indicate a genuine 
interest on the part of the British Government in developing a 
real peace process through the recognition of Sinn Fein's rights 
as a political party, the validity of our mandate and the 
democratic integrity of our electorate. 
  Major will be letting down the people of Britain as well as 
the people of Ireland if he fails to rise above his own 
difficulties so that the situation can be moved forward. I 
believe the IRA suspension creates a potential and it sends a 
signal, an encouraging signal, which can only assist those who 
are committed to this task. The significance of this should not 
be undervalued or underestimated. 
  There are risks in all of this. But they affect everyone, 
republicans as well as prime ministers, and what is the 
alternative? In my view the price justifies the taking of risks. 
A lasting peace demands it. It's over to you, Mr Major.

  [Text] Bonn (DPA) -- The Federal Government has 
temporarily halted the already agreed deliveries within the 
framework of NATO equipment aid to Turkey. DPA learned this 
from government circles on Thursday [7 April]. This already 
applies to the next batch, which would have been due on 15 April 
and comprises optical gun sights and spare parts. 
  The decision was made in coordination between the 
Chancellor's Office, the Defense Ministry, and the Foreign 
Ministry. According to information provided by the responsible 
government circles, the decisive factor was the current 
examination of claims that Turkey is using materiel from German 
armament deliveries against Kurdish guerrillas in the country, 
which violates the NATO treaty. 
  NATO equipment aid, which is to be provided until the end of 
the year and is not to be resumed as of 1995, includes, among 
other things, 16 F4-F jets. This outdated photographic 
reconnaissance version of the double-jet U.S. combat fighter is 
being gradually discharged by the FRG Air Force.

  [Excerpt] Hamburg (DPA) -- Last year and this year dozens 
of Kurds have been deported from Germany to Turkey without this 
becoming known to the general public. According to a DPA 
inquiry on Wednesday [6 April], in January and February 1994 31 
Kurds were forcibly sent back to their homeland from Lower 
Saxony; 24 were deported on the basis of the asylum law and 
seven on the basis of the aliens' law. The other laender said 
regarding this problem that deportations are listed not 
according to ethnic groups but according to citizenship.

  [Text] Bonn/Munich (DPA) -- Chancellor Helmut Kohl has 
again come out in favor of deporting violent Kurds to their 
homeland. "I am not willing to bow to the terror of any group 
in the streets of Germany," Kohl said in an interview at his 
vacation resort in Bad Hofgastein, Austria, which was 
prereleased on Thursday [7 April]. 
  He added that if, in this case, it is the Kurds "who came to 
us with Turkish passports," they must be aware of the 
consequences. However, deportations may be carried out only to 
those countries where it is clearly obvious that "the necessary 
points have been ensured from the viewpoint of human rights." 
  Asked about the reservations by FRG Justice Minister Sabine 
Leutheusser-Schnarrenberger (Free Democratic Party of Germany) 
against the deportation of Kurds to Turkey, Kohl reportedly 
reacted with clear annoyance. "She does not represent in any 
way the opinion of the Federal Government in this matter, not to 
mention my own." Furthermore, it is not clear at all whether 
the minister's statements correspond to the opinion of the Free 
Democratic Party of Germany.

  [Excerpt] Hamburg (DPA) -- Just like Chancellor Helmut 
Kohl (Christian Democratic Union), Social Democratic Party of 
Germany [SPD] Chairman Rudolf Scharping has also come out in 
favor of deporting violent Kurds. In an interview with 
LEIPZIGER VOLKSZEITUNG (Friday edition), Scharping called on the 
state to act against the activities of the Workers Party of 
Kurdistan "in a consistent and tough manner." 
  The SPD chairman said: "I would also have any Kurd deported 
to Turkey who commits act of violence here, threatens other 
people, and ignores or breaks laws" and who "is threatened 
neither with torture nor the death penalty in Turkey." However, 
one thing is impossible, Scharping said, addressing the Federal 
Government: intending to carry out radical deportations and, at 
the same time, carelessly accepting the systematic oppression of 
the Kurds by making arms deliveries or looking the other way.

  [Text] Stuttgart (DPA) -- Three policemen were injured 
during a demonstration of Kurds in Stuttgart on Thursday evening 
[7 April]. Eight persons were arrested. According to 
information released by the police, the three policemen were 
kicked and beaten when they tried to confiscate fliers of a 
banned subgroup of the Workers Party of Kurdistan. The 
demonstration of about 150 people was aimed against the 
persecution of Kurds in Turkey. Speakers primarily opposed the 
intended deportation of Kurds by Bavaria.

  [Text] Duesseldorf (DPA) -- According to findings of the 
North Rhine-Westphalian Office for the Protection of the 
Constitution, leading functionaries of the extreme-right 
Republikaner participated in xenophobic violent attacks last 
year. As the Duesseldorf Interior Ministry reported on Thursday 
[7 April], a member of the executive committee of the Middle 
Rhine District Committee, among others, participated in an 
attack on an asylum-seekers' home in Bergheim-Zieverich near 
Cologne. Thus, the ministry confirmed a report in the NEUE 
RHEIN/RUHR ZEITUNG (NRZ). 
  A statement made in lieu of an oath by a member of the 
executive committee shows that the incident was covered up "in 
order not to discredit the party." Achim Baumann, head of the 
North Rhine-Westphalian Office for the Protection of the 
Constitution, said on west German radio that it is a "scandal" 
that high-ranking party committees tried to prevent criminal 
acts of their members from becoming public. 
  As is shown by an Interior Ministry file, investigations are 
being carried out against members of the Republikaner district 
executive committees of Wuppertal, Recklinghausen, and Herford 
because of the illicit possession of arms and the violation of 
the war-weapons control law. According to the report, two 
members of the Republikaner were sentenced to four years' 
imprisonment each after a Turk suffering from a heart disease 
died because of a "fictitious execution" in Muelheim/Ruhr in 
March 1993. According to the Interior Ministry, two members of 
the Dortmund District Committee were charged with dangerous 
personal injury after a knife battle with a xenophobic 
background. 
  The North Rhine-Westphalian Interior Ministry reproaches FRG 
Interior Minister Manfred Kanther (Christian Democratic Union) 
for "negligence" since he granted a "special status" to the 
Republikaner in the report of the Federal Office for the 
Protection of the Constitution, which will soon be published, 
and does not characterize the party as clearly extreme right.

  [Text] Bonn (DPA) -- In view of the latest conflicts 
between industrialized and developing countries about 
international trade advantages in the Third World, FRG Economics 
Minister Guenter Rexrodt (Free Democratic Party of Germany) 
warned against undeserved forms of new protectionism. At the 
Marrakesh meeting of the 121 GATT countries (from 12 to 15 
April), he will call on the trading partners to solve these 
problems in a discussion, which should be characterized by 
mutual understanding, says a statement by Rexrodt, who is 
currently in India, which was published in Bonn on Thursday [7 
April]. 
  The interrelations between trade and environment as well as 
trade and labor or social standards are highly political fields 
of negotiation, which are extremely sensitive for the developing 
countries. The minister had already come out against social 
dumping and against sanctions to have trade advantages of the 
developing countries reduced, e.g. in the textile sector, which 
they get because of their relatively low wages. 
  The Social Democratic Party of Germany [SPD] has called on 
the Federal Government to follow the United States and agree to 
the new World Trade Organization, WTO, the successor of GATT, 
only if certain minimum standards for working people's rights 
are agreed beforehand. SPD Deputy Hans Buettner stated: "Free 
trade union work, the right to freely negotiable minimum wages, 
as well as a minimum of labor protection are the precondition 
for a fair exchange of goods and services."

  [Text] Frankfurt/Main (DPA) -- The Bundesbank has again 
loosened its interest reins very slightly: In the latest 
security transaction under repurchase agreement, it allotted 
short-term money to the banks at the marginal interest rate of 
5.73 percent -- 0.03 percentage points under the previous level; 
80.4 billion German marks [DM] were allotted, relevant 
transactions for DM82.1 billion had become due. 
  The great majority of the allotments ranged from 5.73 to 
5.75 
percent. The rate for security transactions under repurchase 
agreement is regarded as the central bank's third key rate. 
Because of the volume, it is far more important for the money 
market than the classic discount and Lombard key rates, which 
are currently 5.25 and 6.75 percent respectively.

<F P=106> [Interview with Jean Peyrelevade, new president of Credit </F>
Lyonnais, by Elisabeth Chavelet and Laurence Masurel: "S.O.S. 
Credit Lyonnais"] 
  [Text] [PARIS MATCH] Do you not believe that public opinion 
is justly shocked by the announcement of the 7-billion-franc 
[Fr] deficit in your 1993 accounts and the Fr20 billion which 
the government has promised to pay in order to eliminate your 
debts? 
  [Peyrelevade] The Credit Lyonnais is a large company. Its 
recovery is essential for its customers, its shareholders, its 
staff, and for Paris' reputation as a financial center. As for 
the government, to whom I have to render homage, it had in fact 
no other reasonable solution than to support us. I would refer 
you to the banking law. This provides that, whenever a bank is 
in difficulty, its shareholder or shareholders must do their 
duty. Why should the state be the only shareholder to escape 
this obligation? Moreover, it was for the government the best 
way of protecting its investment. 
  [PARIS MATCH] Despite the recession and the property crisis, 
France's two other major banks, the BNP [National Bank of Paris] 
and the Societe Generale, posted profits of Fr1 billion and 
Fr3.6 billion respectively. How do you justify a deficit of 
Fr6.9 billion and reserves of almost Fr18 billion? 
  [Peyrelevade] At the origin of our losses, there is of 
course 
the economic recession. But all banks on the market are 
suffering from this. The other explanation, which is much more 
important, is specific to the Credit Lyonnais. In recent years, 
this bank has been involved in ventures most of which were 
carried out via subsidiaries, and following procedures which 
have escaped the normal central control system. Reserves have 
accumulated. On property deals. But on other types of business 
too. I am thinking of the many majority participations taken in 
enterprises of every kind, from garments to the distribution 
industry and to golf courses... One ends up with such large 
amounts that the Credit Lyonnais obviously does not have the 
capacity, through its own operation, to make good the cost of 
the past. 
  [PARIS MATCH] The government has decided not to punish your 
predecessor. Have you shown similar clemency toward the 
presidents of Credit Lyonnais subsidiaries who "escaped the 
central control system?" 
  [Peyrelevade] I am not a court judge. But to make the Credit 
Lyonnais once again into an exemplary bank, I must choose the 
best professionals wherever they are found. Jean-Francois Henin 
has left Altus, now under the management of Dominique Bazy, who 
was with me at UAP [Paris Insurance Union]. The president of 
SDBO [expansion unknown] is going to change. Other departures 
have already taken place. I will continue, calmly, as long as 
is necessary. 
  [PARIS MATCH] The Credit Lyonnais has stacked up Fr43 
billion 
of doubtful property loans, almost Fr5 billion of them to the 
Pelege group alone. Is it not a little facile to get rid of the 
problem by creating a property company, with the state taking 
care of the losses for five years? Is this not a game of 
hide-and-seek? 
  [Peyrelevade] There are no conjuring tricks. What is 
imperative is to restore the quality of Credit Lyonnais balance 
sheet. To do this, we are setting up a "defeasance" [as 
published] company, in which we are transferring our troublesome 
property loans. It is true that it is the state which will be 
picking up the losses. This is a customary technique. It has 
been used by the state in Sweden for larger amounts than those 
involved at the Credit Lyonnais, and in order to restore private 
banks to health. In France it has been used by both public and 
private banks -- such as Banque Worms, the BIMP [Private 
Industrial and Tranferable Securities Bank], Pallas Stern, the 
Banque des Travaux Publics [Public Works Bank], and the Comptoir 
des Entrepreneurs [Entrepreneurs Bank] -- and for amounts often 
proportionately larger than our own. Why is this technique 
used? Because, in order to keep one's loans on the balance 
sheet, one has to set up reserves. The fact is that it is 
strictly impossible to know in what amount, given the 
uncertainties surrounding the present and future property 
markets. We are therefore acting with wisdom and prudence. I 
would add that we have agreed to review the situation with the 
government in two years' time. If the Credit Lyonnais recovers 
faster than expected, we will take back over part of the burden 
of this property company. 
  [PARIS MATCH] Are you talking about privatizing the Credit 
Lyonnais? If so, when will it take place? 
  [Peyrelevade] Privatization is dependent on the bank 
returning to profitability. 1996 seems a good date to me. 
  [PARIS MATCH] You have inherited the Tapie file and the 
billion francs which Credit Lyonnais has granted him. Many 
corporate heads are surprised that, while refusing to grant them 
credit, you accord favorable treatment to Bernard Tapie. 
  [Peyrelevade] As soon as one mentions Mr. Tapie, passions 
rise so high that the information becomes distorted. It is true 
that Credit Lyonnais' SDBO subsidiary lent him in my view too 
much money. Since 1 December 1993, not only have we not lent him 
one more cent, but our outstandings to his group are going to 
reduce, as we have demanded sales mandates on several of his 
assets: Terraillan, La Vie Claire, and the "Phocea." And that 
is not all. I was of the opinion that the guaranties previously 
taken by Credit Lyonnais were not satisfactory. Henceforward, 
we have a guaranty which is legally sound, on all of Mr Tapie's 
assets, including his private mansion and his furniture. I do 
not think we are giving him a gift! 
  [PARIS MATCH] Your fellow bankers consider it normal that 
the 
state do its duty, but publicly, like the president of Societe 
Generale, they say that, before asking for taxpayers' money, 
they would like to see the Credit Lyonnais make a special effort 
to find its way back to profitability. What austerity cure are 
you preparing? 
  [Peyrelevade] I have already told personnel that general 
expenses will not increase in 1994 and 1995. We are also 
talking with the trade unions, as staffing levels will have to 
be cut by 10 percent, or more than 3,500 people, over the next 
three years in France. I have asked the 20 members of the 
general management committee to accept a 10-percent pay cut in 
return for promises of Credit Lyonnais shares. This will 
demonstrate their confidence in the bank's ability to turn 
itself around. Finally, Credit Lyonnais will sell Fr20 billion 
of assets from its industrial and commercial portfolio. 
  [PARIS MATCH] How do you expect to sell Fr20 billion of 
assets in two years? It is true that your listed participations 
are worth between Fr5 and 10 billion. But elsewhere experts 
believe that you are "stuck" with unlisted participations in the 
Arnault, Ballor, and Pinault holding companies, which are 
unsalable. 
  [Peyrelevade] We are first of all going to sell what is 
liquid. This involves in particular our major customers. I have 
spoken personally with all the presidents involved, and met with 
a high degree of understanding everywhere. When we will have 
improved our situation, we will return to them. 
  [PARIS MATCH] One of the conditions for the Credit Lyonnais' 
recovery is for it to grant more credit to retail customers and 
corporations. This requires lower French interest rates. Is 
the Bank of France not overly cautious? 
  [Peyrelevade] It is a pity we do not do everything in our 
power to lower interest rates. In particular I regret that 
steps have not been taken to bring down regulated rates faster, 
whether on A savings accounts, savings banks accounts, or 
building society accounts. 
  [PARIS MATCH] Is it not dangerous to lower our rates if we 
want to defend a strong franc, of which you are an ardent 
defender? 
  [Peyrelevade] I am a partisan of tying the franc and the 
mark 
tightly together, but there is no reason whatsoever for the 
franc to weaken today. Nowadays, the German economy is less 
competitive than the French one. That ought to be explained 
better to the markets. One could then lower rates more rapidly. 
  [PARIS MATCH] You talk of the markets. They appear to be 
worried at the increase in French public deficits. Are they 
right? 
  [Peyrelevade] We are approaching the danger zone in terms of 
government deficits. It would be dangerous to go further. We 
have to steer a careful course and begin to reduce these 
gradually as the recovery picks up.

<F P=106> [Unattributed article: "League Blames Berlusconi"] </F>
  [Text] (ANSA) Rome, April 6 -- Antonio Tajani, spokesman 
for Forza Italia, in a statement reiterated that Berlusconi will 
not take part in any more negotiations with "those who have 
shown they do not respect alliances and agreements made before 
the elections and sanctioned by voters," referring to the 
Northern League. 
  Tajani also stressed that Berlusconi's decision to suspend 
all government-formation talks with his allies of the Northern 
League and the National Front was "irrevocable" and that the 
ball is now in the president's court. 
  According to the Constitution, President Oscar Luigi 
Scalfaro 
must name the prime minister, who in turn names his cabinet 
members, but Berlusconi until yesterday was conferring with 
potential government allies without waiting for a mandate from 
the head of state. 
  Berlusconi apparently gave up trying to pave some common 
ground between Bossi and National Alliance leader Gianfranco 
Fini and lost his patience with Bossi's radical and 
unpredictable changes in position. 
  Tajani in his statement conceded that "it is up to the 
president to interpret the election results and issue a mandate" 
to form a new government. "This is not a banana republic," said 
Tajani, adding that Bossi's "unlikely and useless" negotiations 
with his former arch-rivals of the Pact for Italy "only add 
confusion to confusion." 
  But Pact leader Mario Segni denied having been contacted by 
any officials of the Northern League. "I have not yet received 
any phone call from Bossi, nor from any other League official, 
so I cannot say when we will meet." 
  Segni did confirm however that he will be meeting with 
League 
officials but declined to reveal the agenda of the talks.

<F P=106> [Interview with Antonio Martino, Forza Italia economic </F>
expert, by Dino Vaiano; place and date not given: "Martino: 
Italy Divided in Counties"] 
  [Excerpt] [Passage omitted] Antonio Martino, Forza Italia's 
economic expert, continues working on the government program 
despite [League Secretary] Bossi's broadsides. Moreover, he is 
holding a trump card to make the duelists agree. A sort of 
compromise between federalism and decentralization, i.e., to 
divide Italy in 25 or 50 counties to which the exclusive right 
to levy taxes is granted. In addition, he wants to put a 
ceiling to revenue tax pressure, a superministry of economy, and 
a reform of IRPEF [personal income tax]. 
  And what if the pole for freedom wrecks? Would Ciampi remain 
prime minister? The professor has no doubts. "I believe that 
these elections have a clear political significance. The fact 
of Ciampi remaining in his seat would become a problem only if a 
majority cannot be established. However, this would be bad 
luck, not for Ciampi, who is a trustworthy person and who has 
been working well as governor of the Bank of Italy, but because 
the new parliament is unable to guarantee a government majority." 
  [Vaiano] How can a joint program be worked out between both 
duelists? 
  [Martino] The element which can bring them together is the 
willingness to hold the flood of taxes in check. If we hold on 
to the present rate, in the year 2000 we will have an average 
taxation level of 60 percent, with public expenditure nearing 75 
percent of national income. We want -- and I do not know 
whether we will introduce it at once or in two phases -- a sole 
33-percent personal income tax rate and a significant increase 
in personal tax allowances, in order to exonerate the have-nots 
and protect the big families. 
  [Vaiano] The big obstacle seems federalism, however... 
  [Martino] If I interpret the issue correctly, the majority 
of 
League voters considers federalism a restraint to the unbridled 
expansion of a wasting and corrupt state. 
  [Vaiano] And what will Forza Italia propose? 
  [Martino] The local government levels are too numerous. 
There are about 350,000 city councillors; this is a real army 
of employees. It should be possible to create one local body 
covering a sufficiently large territory to allow the financing 
of its own governing level, but which would also be small enough 
to maintain the population's control over the functioning of the 
local government. It would be a kind of county. 
  [Vaiano] How many could there be? 
  [Martino] Between 25 and 50. Their dimension should be 
somewhat smaller than a region and larger than a present 
province. 
  [Vaiano] Will taxes be paid at the central level or the 
county level? 
  [Martino] The authority to impose taxes could be taken away 
from the central government and transferred to the local level. 
On two conditions, however: There should be a balance and a 
certain percentage of the yields should be transferred to the 
central government. 
  [Vaiano] Will the new government proceed to antideficit 
measures soon? 
  [Martino] I am against mending measures like the ones we 
have 
seen over the last few years. The system needs to be changed, 
and expenses should be cut. We will not use tax squeezing 
methods. Privatizations can be carried through gradually. And 
we will stay alert not to incite inflationist flares. 
  [Vaiano] Are you thinking of setting up a superministry of 
economy? 
  [Martino] Yes, although there is also another hypothesis: 
the merger of the Finance and Budget Ministries, which would be 
the easiest solution. 
  [Vaiano] What will happen to taxing treasury bills and stock 
exchange transactions? 
  [Martino] Government stock cannot be affected at all: for 
moral reasons, because the state has made a contract with the 
saver, and for economic reasons, because panic would emerge 
among savers. Also in the field of capital gain I do not see any 
new taxes. 
  [Vaiano] Will there be a major purge at the top of the state 
and government bodies? 
  [Martino] We will follow a third path, between the model of 
an immovable bureaucracy, which gradually becomes too powerful, 
and the American model, which replaces 2,000 civil servants 
following a change in the administration. 
  [Vaiano] However, there are many headhunters, especially for 
RAI [state broadcasting company]. 
  [Martino] The statements about RAI can easily be explained 
by 
the -- justified -- resentment about the way in which some 
election programs were conducted.

<F P=106> [Unattributed article: "China/Italy: Shanghai Mayor in </F>
Rome"] 
  [Text] (ANSA) Rome, April 5 -- Bilateral trade was the 
leading topic Tuesday [5 April] when the mayor of Shanghai, 
Huang Ju, was received by Italian Prime Minister Carlo Azeglio 
Ciampi and Foreign Trade Minister Paolo Baratta at the Rome 
government's offices. 
  Future Italian programs and investments in China and 
"greater 
collaboration with the aim of consolidating positions gained" 
were discussed, a government communique said after the meeting. 
  Italian exports to China last year amounted to four trillion 
lire (2.45 billion dollars), mostly in industrial machinery, and 
China in 1993 jumped from 20th to 14th place among Italy's 
export markets, the communique said. 
  Mayor Huang Ju later had talks with Italian Foreign Minister 
Beniamino Andreatta focussing on prospects for the "particularly 
dynamic" area around Shanghai and possible "Italian 
participation in the development of the Pudong area," a foreign 
ministry communique said.

<F P=106> [Article by Vladimir Sapozhnikov: "Andreatta Says Italy Will </F>
Support Russia for a Role in G-7"] 
  [Text] MOSCOW--The G-7 is showing a more open attitude 
towards Russia. At the summit of industrialized countries to be 
held in Naples from July 8-10, Russia will participation more 
than it did at the preceding summit in Tokyo last year. This 
announcement was made yesterday by Beniamino Andreatta, the 
foreign minister, who left for a working trip to Moscow on 
Wednesday [9 March]. The Kremlin has always given particular 
emphasis to its relationship with Italy, and in this instance it 
has also done its best to stress the importance of Andreatta's 
visit: he was received by President Boris Yeltsin who gave 
placed a high value on the relationship between Moscow and Rome. 
"What inspires our admiration," the Kremlin leader stressed, "is 
that Italian leaders understand the partnership [preceding word 
in English] between Russia and the West in the true sense of the 
word, and this makes it possible to build a fruitful 
relationship based on equality." Problems related to the Russian 
military presence in the Baltic countries and the conflict in 
the former Yugoslavia were two other topics that Andreatta, who 
also traveled to Moscow in his capacity as President of the 
Government Council of the CSCE [Council on Security and 
Cooperation in Europe], covered with Yeltsin and the Russian 
Minister of Foreign Affairs, Andrei Kozyrev. 
  Andreatta confirmed that at the next summit Russia will be 
given more prominence, especially with regard to the political 
portion of the meeting. At the same time, he admitted that from 
meetings held yesterday "there was some confusion from the 
Russian side" concerning "uncertainties and ambiguities" that 
some G-7 member countries still harbor on the future 
participation of Moscow in the group of highly-industrialized 
nations. Andreatta assured Yeltsin that from his standpoint 
"Italy will favor Russia's participation in all organizations 
where this is possible" because Russia's broader international 
presence can "have a positive significance for the growth of 
democracy in that country." 
  For Andreatta the G-7 is an "informal group without 
established rules"; thus, for the summit in Naples, two sessions 
will be organized: one "based essentially on economic issues and 
therefore without Russia present," and the second "on issues 
dedicated primarily to political matters." The nations that 
support the expansion of the G-7 to include Russia recognize, 
however, the need to limit the Kremlin's participation to 
discussions on international political issues, while economic 
matters will be confined to the original seven countries for an 
unspecified period of time. "In this way the process for Russian 
participation in the group of the seven most industrialized 
countries will move forward step by step," Andreatta said. 
  Andreatta and his Russian counterpart discussed at length 
the situation in the Baltic countries, and in particular the 
problem of former Soviet troops that are still located in these 
countries. Prior to leaving for Tallinn and Vilnius yesterday 
evening, Andreatta said, "I would like to draw the attention of 
those countries to the observance of the rules by virtue of 
which we are assisting them." Which is to say that the Baltic 
countries should not be in a hurry to be a part of Europe, and 
should maintain a good relationship with Moscow also. Tallinn 
and Vilnius are insisting on the immediate withdrawal of the Red 
Army, but yesterday Russian Defense Minister Pavel Grachev said 
that this will primarily depend on logistical problems such as 
the prospect of finding housing for soldiers returning to Russia. 
  In Moscow, Bosnia was also discussed: and later on Andreatta 
said that he noted Moscow's "positive attitude" towards the 
possibility of NATO intervention in Bosnia which is seen as "a 
first sign of the Partnership [preceding word in English] for 
peace."

<F P=106> [Article signed M. Rog.: "Defense Imports and Exports: </F>
Deregulation Imminent"] 
  [Text] ROME--Even weapons are the target of administrative 
simplification. Prime Minister Carlo Azeglio Ciampi kept his 
repeated commitment to companies of this sector: for imports, 
exports, and transportation of weapons and weapon technologies 
of a strategic nature, the government approval process will be 
quicker and more streamlined. In short, this is like a gust of 
innovation to reduce bureaucracy. This is especially true with 
regard to the use of the "silent agreement" for continued 
contractual negotiations involving the import and export of 
armaments. This type of deregulation is being launched with a 
regulation for implementing a law related to state holding 
companies drafted last week by the prime minister and currently 
being examined in parliament. 
  However, the simplified approval process is not yet 
operative. Before the Council of Ministers can apply its final 
seal of approval, the two houses of parliament will have to 
express their opinion on the measure. An opinion that, in view 
of the elections, should not be delayed. At least that is what 
the Palazzo Chigi [the Prime Minister's office] hopes. Quick 
approval of the regulation governing weapons transactions is 
also eagerly awaited by the defense sector. 
  The foundation on which the simplified approval process 
rests 
is the silent agreement. Companies will still have to advise the 
Foreign Ministry when they begin negotiations regarding the 
import, export or movement of weapons or their replacement 
parts. But if the ministry does not inform the party concerned 
that the request has been denied within 60 days of receiving it, 
negotiations can proceed to a conclusion. Moreover, this 
two-month time limit is reduced to 30 days in situations where 
negotiations "involve transactions from or to NATO countries or 
the WEU." Under this procedure the maximum time limit for 
granting approval for weapons transactions is 60 days from 
presentation of the request. 
  Thus, the government is trying to speed up the slow, 
disorganized administrative machine. The 20-day period allocated 
to the Foreign Ministry for approving transactions with its own 
permit (not that of the Defense Ministry as is most often the 
case) is further evidence of this. This accelerated procedure 
covers replacement parts for arms maintenance and repair, 
weapons training, and defense equipment which has "already been 
approved" for temporary export or import. And if the temporary 
imports or exports are the result of participation in fairs or 
exhibits, the approval or denial must be issued by the Defense 
Ministry within 15 days of the request. 
  A separate chapter is also devoted to companies that fall 
under the so-called general authorization system when importing 
or exporting. To untangle the intricate administrative web, the 
regulation introduces a package of ad hoc measures for setting 
up a special list for interested companies at the Ministry of 
Foreign Trade. 
  Applications included on the National Register made up of 
companies in this category would also fall under the accelerated 
bureaucratic approval process (at least on paper). These 
applications must be processed by the Defense Ministry within 30 
days of the request and have a validity of 3 years. Best of all, 
control of these procedures has been greatly facilitated. Those 
involved in these transactions must provide "proof" to the 
Ministry of Foreign Trade that the goods shipped actually 
arrived in the destination country, and within 30 days of the 
end of each calendar quarter, they must provide information on 
all shipments made.

<F P=106> [Unattributed report: "Federal Police Office Study: </F>
Switzerland Can Try War Criminals From the Former Yugoslavia"] 
  [Text] Bern, 2 Apr (ATS) -- Swiss military justice can try 
the war criminals from the former Yugoslavia who are brought 
before it. A report from the Federal Police Office (OFP), 
published on Saturday [2 April] by several German-language 
newspapers, came to this conclusion. It was confirmed by a 
spokesman from the DFJP [Federal Department of Justice and 
Police]. In the case of sufficient evidence, the divisional 
courts would be competent to start proceedings. 
  The analysis was commissioned in mid-February by the Federal 
Council. The aim was to determine what exactly the situation 
was from the legal viewpoint. The OFP handed its report to 
Arnold Koller, the head of the DFJP, just before the Easter 
weekend. The eight-page report comes to the conclusion that 
military justice is competent to open criminal proceedings 
against war criminals, even if they are civilians or are of 
foreign nationality, and if they committed their crimes in 
another country. DFJP spokesman Viktor Schlumpf, confirmed this 
interpretation to ATS [Swiss Press Agency] on Saturday. It is 
based on the 1949 Geneva Conventions which Switzerland has made 
an integral part of its military law. In the case of a 
justified suspicion with regard to a presumed war criminal or on 
denunciation, military justice would conduct the proceedings in 
cooperation with the DMF [Federal Department of the Military], 
the DFAE [Federal Department of Foreign Affairs], and the DFJP. 
The accused would, in theory, be extradited to the country in 
which he committed his crimes. In the case of 
Bosnia-Herzegovina, this extradition would only be carried out 
with the guarantee that the death penalty would not be used. If 
extradition proved impossible, the army's chief auditor would 
refer to matter to the civilian justice and police authorities 
in order for them to conduct the military criminal investigation 
because military justice does not have its own investigation 
bodies. If necessary, a charge would be submitted to the 
divisional court responsible for the case. If found guilty, the 
war criminal would serve his sentence in a Swiss prison. The 
sentences for the various crimes are established by the military 
criminal code. 
  According to the press, Bosnia's embassy in Bern knows of at 
least 10 cases of war criminals currently in Switzerland. It is 
basing this on the eye-witness reports of Bosnian refugees who 
say they have identified their persecutors. The Bosnian mission 
in Switzerland is shortly expected to present its documents to 
the Swiss authorities. If there is a case, the stipulated 
procedure will be followed, DMF spokesman Daniel Eckmann told 
ATS. However, the evidence must be sufficiently specific and 
clear. Hitherto no case of this kind has yet been submitted, he 
stressed.

<F P=106> [ATSA/SDAA report: "Swiss Blue Helmets; Martin Chevallez </F>
Leaves ASIN Vice Presidency"] 
  [Text] Lausanne, 6 Apr (ATS) -- Colonel Martin Chevallez 
has left the vice presidency of Action for an Independent and 
Neutral Switzerland (ASIN), whose president is National Council 
member Christoph Blocher (UDC [Swiss People's Party]/ZH). He 
confirmed the report published on Wednesday [6 April] by the 
dailies 24 HEURES and TRIBUNE DE GENEVE. 
  He had headed the ASIN campaign in French-speaking 
Switzerland against the European Economic Area (EEA) during the 
federal vote on 6 December 1992. But he now supports, against 
his president, the creation of a Swiss UN Blue Helmet corps, on 
which a federal vote will be taken on 12 June. Martin 
Chevallez, son of former Federal Council Member Georges-Andre 
Chevallez, was EMG [expansion unknown] lieutenant colonel and a 
professional training officer until 1992. After being granted 
leave by the Federal Military Department to devote himself to 
his anti-EEA campaign, he became a militia colonel and commander 
of the Fifth Mountain Infantry Regiment in 1993.

thus will be able to register as an asylum seeker, Federal 
Refugee Office (ODR) spokesman Heinz Schoeni said Thursday [7 
April]. A cousin of the former shah's prime minister, Shapur 
Bakhtiar, arrived at Geneva Airport without a passport on 22

  [Excerpt] Ankara/Bonn (DPA) -- In connection with the 
halting of deliveries within the framework of NATO equipment 
aid, Turkey has warned Germany against "indirectly encouraging 
terrorism." The Federal Government's decision to temporarily 
halt already agreed deliveries of NATO equipment was received 
"with regret and concern for the future of German-Turkish 
relations," it was said in Ankara. 
  In a statement aired by the Turkish state television TRT on 
Thursday evening [7 April], Turkish Foreign Minister Hikmet 
Cetin said that, in a telephone conversation with FRG Foreign 
Minister Klaus Kinkel, he had affirmed that Turkey is 
"confronted with serious terrorism." However, Turkey is 
determined to fight for its national and territorial integrity 
with the means of a rule-of-law state and of democracy. Hereby 
it is particularly important that Turkey's friendly and allied 
states "do not indirectly encourage terrorism," Cetin said. 
  Cetin advocated the view that the halting of the delivery of 
German equipment aid to Turkey is due to "the elections campaign 
atmosphere in Germany." However, it must not be that "such 
sensitive topics are turned into domestic policy election 
campaign material." "Destroying relations is quite easy and can 
be done very quickly; reestablishing them is difficult and takes 
long," Cetin said. [passage omitted]

<F P=106> [Report by John Grigsby and Robert Shrimsley: "Major To </F>
Lead Poll Battle From the Front"] 
  [Text] Mr Major is to put himself at the forefront of the 
Conservative local elections campaign in spite of the claim by 
party tacticians that the polls will not be a referendum on his 
leadership. 
  This high-risk strategy, which will see the Prime Minister 
touring the country, will make defeat a personal humiliation for 
him. But it in part reflects Tory strategists' belief that the 
elections will not be quite as bad for the party as pundits have 
predicted. 
  At a press conference to launch the Tories' campaign in 
England, Sir Norman Fowler, the party chairman, said Mr Major 
would be touring all the main target regions, especially London 
and the West Midlands. 
  "You will find him in the areas where the action is," said 
Sir Norman. Mr Major and other ministers would be out on the 
stump "in a way that is unprecedented outside a general 
election." 
  Speaking on the day that large tax rises came into effect; 
Sir Norman said: "What the Conservative Party wants to do is get 
behind John Major and put an end to this fruitless and silly 
talk about the leadership." 
  Mr John Gummer, the Environment Secretary, said: "One of the 
joys of John Major is that once he gets out many people 
recognise the kind of greatness of leadership which he gives us." 
  Mr Gummer said that contact with the voters was one of Mr 
Major's greatest strengths. 
  "The more he is about, the more people talk to him, the more 
people see him, the more they understand what he said that, 
whether people are for him or against him, he will do what is 
right for the country." 
  Sir Norman and Mr Gummer said the Conservatives would 
concentrate on local issues. Mr Gummer refused to be drawn into 
speculating about the places where the party might gain seats. 
  Mr Jack Straw, shadow environment secretary, has forecast 
that Labour could lose 200 seats and that it could not 
realistically hope to take Wandsworth or Westminster from the 
Tories or Tower Hamlets from the Liberal Democrats. 
  Yesterday Mr Straw ridiculed Tory expectations for the 
elections pointing out that three weeks ago ministers had openly 
predicted victory in Birmingham. Since then they have lost a 
council by-election in a stronghold ward. 
  While the Conservatives did badly outside London in 1990 
when 
the seats were last fought Sir Norman said that they had their 
best result since 1982 in the capital. 
  This means that they have more to lose, including control, 
or 
leadership, of a number of London boroughs including Brent, 
Croydon, Ealing, Enfield, Kingston, Redbridge and Harrow. They 
could also be under pressure in Barnet, Bexley and Bromley. All 
seats are at stake in the 32 London boroughs and the Scottish 
regional and island councils. A third of the seats will be 
contested in the 36 metropolitan districts, 114 shire and four 
Welsh districts. 
  According to a System Three poll for THE HERALD in Glasgow 
today, Tory support in Scotland is still at rock bottom -- 13 
per cent. 
  The party is now in fourth place behind the Liberal 
Democrats, who remain on 14 per cent for a fifth consecutive 
month. 
  Labour has dipped a point to 46 per cent to remain easily 
the 
dominant party, with the SNP [Scotish National Party] closing 
slightly from 25 to 26 per cent.

<F P=106> [Editorial: "London and Dublin United"] </F>
  [Text] The IRA's three-day ceasefire, due to start this 
morning, has been roundly denounced as cynical and inadequate. 
Ever since the Downing Street Declaration in December, it has 
been made abundantly clear to the IRA's political wing, Sinn 
Fein, that it can enter the democratic process only when it 
unequivocally and permanently renounces violence. Sinn Fein's 
aim in calling this ceasefire was clearly to try to put pressure 
on the Government to fudge this fundamental precondition. That 
indeed has been its intention all along; hence its repeated call 
for London to "clarify" the declaration. 
  Dublin, however, has already provided Sinn Fein leaders with 
ample clarification, and the Sinn Fein leadership can now be in 
no doubt what the declaration means. They have admitted several 
times that it offers a real chance of progress for Ulster, yet 
cannot bring themselves to abandon their old boast that they 
will eventually force their way to the peace table with a ballot 
box in one hand and an Armalite in the other. 
  We have before expressed concern that the Irish government, 
in its eagerness to get peace talks moving, would allow Sinn 
Fein to think that it could somehow avoid the absolute necessity 
of renouncing violence. It is therefore very welcome that over 
the past week Dublin has stood four-square with London and 
condemned outright this latest attempt by Sinn Fein and the IRA 
to drive a wedge between the two governments on this crucial 
issue. 
  It may nevertheless take some time before Sinn Fein finally 
accepts that it must renounce violence once and for all. It may 
never accept as much. A 72-hour respite from murder and 
maiming, though welcome in itself, can do nothing to hasten the 
negotiations which the British and Irish governments still hope 
will flow from the declaration. But many in the various 
constituencies that Sinn Fein and the IRA seek to cultivate -- 
in Northern Ireland itself, in the South and in America -- are 
urging them to respond constructively to the declaration. And 
that seems to be giving them serious pause for thought about 
their terrorist campaign. Both governments must keep up the 
pressure by continuing to refuse them any form of talks until 
they forswear terrorism for ever.

  [Text] Bavarian Interior Minister Beckstein announced in 
Bonn today that the Free State will continue to deport violent 
Kurdish criminals. Expulsion orders will also be issued. After 
the riots and the Augsburg superhighway blockade, Bavaria 
expects to issue a total of 20 deportation orders, eight of 
which have already been issued, he said. The interior minister 
stressed that, in his opinion, there is no general obstacle to 
deportation to Turkey. Therefore, he intends to enforce such 
measures.

<F P=106> [Speech by Foreign Minister Dr. Klaus Kinkel at the French </F>
Institute of International Relations in Paris on 24 March: 
"Germany and France in a New Europe"] 
  [Text] The French Institute of International Relations is 
one of Europe's most renowned forums for exchanging ideas about 
international issues. I am pleased, Mr. de Montbrial, to be the 
first German foreign minister to address you. At the end of the 
1970's, we were both planning chiefs in our foreign ministries. 
I am also pleased that you, Professor Rovan, are one of the 
hosts of this evening. You have been tireless in your efforts 
to pave the way for Franco-German friendship. 
  For us Germans, the collapse of the Berlin Wall was the most 
important event related to freedom in the postwar period. The 
French were delighted along with us. Alain Juppe, with whom I 
enjoy friendly relations and close cooperation, was at the 
Berlin Wall in those days. In his book Tentation de 
Venise [Temptation of Venus], he describes people's joy on 
16 November 1989, the happy atmosphere of those days, and his 
own emotions. Without Franco-German friendship, without Germany 
being firmly anchored in Europe and the West, German unity would 
not have been possible. The Germans are well aware of that. 
However, reunification has at times also revived old concerns 
about Germany's role in Europe. 
  What kind of Europe do we want? How large and how closely 
integrated should it be? What role is a united Germany seeking 
in a new Europe? What roles do Germany and France have in this 
Europe that is drawing together following the end of the 
East-West conflict and following German reunification? These 
are the kinds of questions that occur to a German foreign 
minister. These are also the questions that I want to discuss 
with you today. They can only be answered against the 
background of Franco-German friendship. Germany has no other 
partner with whom cooperation is so close and so marked by 
confidence. We are each other's most important trading 
partners. Summit meetings twice a year and regular 
consultations between the ministers are the most visible 
elements of an incomparably close network of consultation and 
coordination. I constantly consult with Alain Juppe, and we see 
each other almost every week. There was a good reason for 
visiting Paris on the day I took office, and there was also a 
good reason why Alain Juppe visited Bonn immediately after he 
took office! Not one day goes by without a Franco-German 
meeting appearing in the schedules in Bonn and Paris. Our 
embassies exchange reports and carry out joint instructions. 
  Franco-German friendship is firmly rooted among our two 
peoples. There are 1,600 sister cities and 3,000 school 
partnerships, including a youth exchange program involving over 
5 million participants -- that speaks for itself. Polls show 
again and again how Franco-German friendship has become 
something self-evident for our citizens. It has become a model 
for reconciliation in Europe. 
  Since 1945, France and Germany have constantly succeeded to 
mark significant dates in their common history in a dignified 
manner. I recall the meeting between Charles de Gaulle and 
Konrad Adenauer at Reims Cathedral, and President Mitterrand and 
Chancellor Kohl praying together at the graves at Verdun. There 
is no doubt in my mind that the French and the Germans will be 
able to recall the end of World War II and Germany's return to 
the democratic community in an appropriate manner. We will also 
remember France's contribution to defending the Germans' liberty 
when French soldiers leave Berlin now. 
  The European unification process has opened up a new path 
into the future for Germany. With the decision to integrate our 
country into the European Union [EU], we have acted on the 
conclusions that are to be drawn from German history in this 
century. In 1953, Thomas Mann already advised us to seek "a 
Germany that is a self-assured element in a self-assured united 
Europe." That is what we want to be. The overwhelming majority 
that was obtained in the Bundestag for the Treaty on European 
Unification and the Federal Constitutional Court ruling have 
shown that there is agreement in Germany: We need more, not 
less Europe. 
  What links us is historical insight. Two such large 
neighboring states in the heart of Europe can only exist by 
coexisting. That is why Germany and France have always placed 
European unification ahead of the adoption of individual or 
special courses. Not only have we done well by doing so, but 
both our countries have also become trendsetters for Europe. 
That is the way it will remain and must remain! 
  All of Europe, including Germany, is experiencing economic 
and structural problems today. Germany faces a third challenge: 
The completion of unification. The open domestic market will 
enable our partners to act on an equal footing in the 
development of this region. French companies were one of the 
first to seize these great opportunities in eastern Germany. 
The involvement of French investors accounts for almost 20 
percent of all foreign investment. In 1993, real economic growth 
there amounted to a good 7 percent. What will remain 
unforgettable for me is how impressed Alain Juppe was by the 
development of the new laender when we and our wives visited 
Dresden. 
  The wave of hostility toward foreigners and right-wing acts 
of violence, which we thought could never occur again, horrified 
the overwhelming majority of Germans. Hatred of foreigners and 
hostility toward what is foreign should never again originate in 
Germany! The EU needs a common asylum and immigration policy. 
  We Germans, especially in view of our history, believe in 
the 
duty to assist people who are experiencing need, violence, and 
war. German foreign policy is geared toward values and is shaped 
by the principle of responsibility. That is the reason for our 
humanitarian involvement in Somalia, in former Yugoslavia, and 
elsewhere. That is why we are involved in intensive diplomatic 
efforts to resolve conflicts and that is also the reason for our 
readiness to assume responsibility on the UN Security Council, 
with all the rights and duties that that entails. Germany is 
seeking a permanent place on the Security Council. France 
supports that wish. We are grateful for that. 
  French soldiers have lost their lives for the cause of 
peace. 
We remember them with the highest respect. We are impressed by 
the exemplary deployment of blue helmets in former Yugoslavia. 
I am confident that we will shortly have clarification of the 
constitutional conditions for participation in missions aimed at 
maintaining or creating peace. That is the only way in which 
Germany remains capable of integration and being an alliance 
partner within the EU and NATO. 
  The new Europe is no longer the divided Europe of the Cold 
War, but all of Europe. Germany and France have asked 
themselves three questions concerning the future: 

  -  How can 
we consolidate peace? 
  -  How can we safeguard the well-being of our 
peoples? 
  -  How will we assert ourselves within a global framework? 
  Once again: The answer for Germany is clear. We can only 
master these challenges within and along with the EU. I am sure 
that France will provide the same answer. Our joint commitment 
for the EU has laid the basis for the future. I am confident 
that we will succeed in the historic step toward a new, greater, 
and stronger Europe. The questions concerning candidates for 
admission have been resolved. The expansion of the EU to 
include Austria, Sweden, Finland, and Norway will represent a 
success for Europe. It would not make any sense to be held up 
by the voting rights issue. The EU model involving common 
institutions has superseded the idea of nothing more than a free 
trade zone, an idea that we did not discard in 1957 simply in 
order to approve it today. Just as we jointly acted in 1985 to 
facilitate membership for southern Europe, it is now the turn of 
the north. 
  The birth pangs of the new Europe are more painful than was 
expected. In this critical situation, Germany and France must 
use their combined weight to provide new inspiration to Europe. 
  Franco-German initiatives such as the formation of a 
Eurocorps and our proposal for the resumption of the Geneva 
negotiations on Yugoslavia have become EU projects. The GATT 
negotiations, which are of such importance for Europe's economic 
future, were a success because Germany and France reached 
agreement. Neither of our countries if they had acted alone 
would have had the strength to have achieved such a conclusion 
to the negotiations. France knows it can rely on Germany and 
vice versa. Pompidou's words have been confirmed: 
Franco-German partnership is "exemplary," but not "exclusive." 
  We now face difficult questions concerning the further 
development of the EU: They concern the rate at which new 
member states are accepted, the reform of European institutions, 
and the relationship between deepening and enlargement. All 
these questions can only be solved if Germany and France seek to 
answer them jointly. Germany and France must also retain their 
pivotal function in an EU that will continue to grow. It is our 
common task for the future. The Elysee Treaty provides us with 
guidelines in this respect. 
  Germany and France have resolved that as of 1 July their 
consecutive EU presidencies will be oriented toward a common 
vision for the EU's future. Alain Juppe and I have agreed on 
that. I envision four main areas in this Franco-German 
partnership program: 
  First, we must implement the EU Treaty in a resolute manner. 
With the common market and the European Economic Zone, we have 
achieved an integration advantage in world terms. To retain it, 
we have to realize economic and monetary union [EMU]. I welcome 
the fact that at the second stage of EMU, France restored the 
independence of the Banque de France. I am grateful to France 
for its yes to Frankfurt as the headquarters of the European 
central bank. Germany has also provided proof on many occasions 
of its readiness to make great efforts for Europe's monetary 
union, and has done so recently through the Bundesbank's 
supportive action totalling 60 billion German marks in 1993. 
  Our common goal is the convergence of our economies. That is 
why we have reached firm agreement on binding criteria for 
entering the third stage of economic and monetary union. Not 
all the EU member states will be able to carry out this step at 
the same time. Without cohesion on the part of the first group 
that meets the criteria, the remaining member states will not be 
able to achieve the necessary level of performance at a later 
date too. Germany and France must defend the logic of the union 
treaty against all attempts to water it down! 
  The 18 million unemployed in the EU are a warning signal. 
The globalization of markets and the international division of 
labor require rethinking and painful adjustment processes. 
Above all, Europe cannot afford to fall behind the dynamic 
development in Asia. Europe needs a modernization boost to enter 
the information age of the 21st century. There is an urgent 
need to develop transportation, energy, and communications 
networks all over Europe. Today, travelling by train between 
Berlin and Paris takes 13 hours and involves going through four 
different energy networks with three different railroad safety 
systems. How long can we afford to carry on like this? 
  The EU must also remain capable of acting after its 
expansion. That is why we now need common ideas about developing 
the necessary institutional reforms. We have no choice. We and 
France support enhancing the EU and we must achieve that along 
with the EU's expansion. The 1996 government conference must 
make the necessary decisions. The expanded EU must also 
function. The rights of the European Parliament must also be 
developed. The council and the commission must remain capable 
of acting. It is of key importance that Germany and France will 
occupy clear and convergent positions. I support the idea of 
appointing a commission of wise men that formulate proposals for 
the government conference. 
  Our citizens must once again be able to find their national 
and regional identity in a Europe that is drawing together. The 
upcoming European elections are a test. We must win over the 
citizens of France and of Germany for Europe! 
  Secondly, the EU must respond to the changed security policy 
challenges in Europe. This means that the development of an 
independent European security and defense identity is 
indispensable. That is why we are developing the WEU as a 
defense component of the EU in a comprehensive manner. In 
future, the WEU and NATO will engage in close coordination in 
the event of crises. Our ability to engage in common defense 
will thus be adjusted to meet specifically European 
requirements. Our North American partners are supporting 
European efforts to achieve more independence in asserting our 
security. The most recent alliance summit provided impressive 
proof of that. 
  However, future Europe also needs the transatlantic 
security partnership. It is one of the formative experiences of 
our recent history. For the core functions of the alliance, the 
commitment of our North American partners, above all the 
presence of U.S. troops in Europe, is indispensable. 
Franco-German cooperation strengthens the columns that support 
Europe's bridge over the Atlantic. 
  Concerning events in former Yugoslavia over the past few 
weeks: I very much welcome the fact that France has been 
particularly active in promoting NATO's decisions concerning 
Sarajevo. The stabilization that has occurred in Sarajevo in 
the meantime and the agreements that have been signed on the 
Bosnian-Croatian federation demonstrate what can be achieved 
with resolve and clear goals. I am pleased to see that the EU 
peace plan, which is based on a Franco- German initiative, is 
now developing into what will hopefully be a lasting and durable 
international peace settlement with the participation of the 
United States and Russia. This is a good example of the power 
of Franco-German understanding. 
  We need the courage to develop visions for the Europe of the 
future. After the turn of the century, everyone in Europe will 
bear a responsibility for the security of others, precisely 
because everyone has an immense interest in the security of 
others. Next century, Europe will have to supplement the 
Atlantic alliance by developing a collective security system. 
We must develop the CSCE into an instrument for preventing and 
resolving conflicts. Along with the French foreign minister, I 
am of the opinion that an important and necessary step in this 
direction was to oblige participating states to take joint 
action against those who disrupt peace. In such cases, 
participating states should jointly call for a meeting of the UN 
Security Council and at the same time undertake to implement 
Security Council resolutions jointly. 
  We are seeking a multidimensional, graduated networking of 
the security interests of all the states in the region. It 
would simply be wrong to accord the states of Central and East 
Europe a place between West and East in this Europe. That is 
why we cannot accept the Russian proposal of militarily 
guaranteeing the security of these countries by NATO states on 
the one hand and by CIS states on the other hand. The old way 
of thinking in zones of influence is no longer valid. In the 
new Europe, there can be no place for so-called vital spheres of 
influence, for the concept of "an abroad close-at-hand." The 
Partnership for Peace has created an instrument for spreading 
stability to Central and East Europe and thus drawing in Russia. 
  In a time of new risks, arms control remains a task of 
first-order importance for the international community. That is 
why I have proposed a 10 point plan for preventing the 
proliferation of nuclear weapons. I am pleased about the 
positive response. There must be an unlimited extension of the 
Nonproliferation Treaty. 
  Thirdly, we also need an active EU policy on the 
Mediterranean region. I know how developments in the Maghreb 
countries above all constitute a vital interest for France. We 
share concerns about security in the Mediterranean region. 
Alain Juppe and I want to investigate the possibilities for 
joint initiatives in this region. 
  Fourthly, we need a common EU policy on the East. This is an 
historic task. We must gradually lead the reformist states of 
Central and East Europe into our community of stability. The 
people there need firm proof that the difficult transition to 
democracy and free market economy is worth it. 
  In 1990, Germany and France already envisaged a joint 
Eastern 
policy. This will be a key issue in both the German and the 
French presidencies. A start has already been made: The 
trilateral talks with our Polish colleagues have opened up a new 
bridge of understanding. 
  In the security field too, Germany and France are making 
progress with Poland. At the next meeting of the WEU 
ministerial council in May, on the basis of the proposal made by 
Alain Juppe and myself, the opportunities for our Eastern 
partners to have an input through consultations will be given 
concrete form. 
  France's initiative for a stability pact in Europe is geared 
toward settling particularly critical minority and border 
issues. We want to make a success of this EU project together! 
  I see there being five additional areas that require an 
active EU Eastern policy: 
  Firstly, for the states of Central and East Europe that 
already have an associate status, the previously agreed upon 
full implementation of the opening up of markets is a top 
priority. Measures aimed at closing off markets undermine the 
credibility of this process! The admission of the states of 
Central and East Europe to the EU has been promised. This is a 
task of historic importance. It will require time. We cannot 
afford to fail in this respect. It cannot be right to call on 
the countries of Central and East Europe for decades to join our 
Western community based on freedom, and then to say that there 
are no vacant rooms left for them in the European house! 
  We already want to draw our association partners into common 
foreign and security policies as much as possible. Germany and 
France will work to achieve a better coordination of advisory 
assistance for the states of Central and East Europe. I would 
propose a "European Development Corps." The PHARE [Economic 
Reconstruction Aid for Poland and Hungary] program should be 
more strongly oriented toward the promotion of investment. 
  Secondly, the development of relations between the EU and 
Russia will have a key role. We want an open, stable, 
democratic Russia, which can become a capable economic partner 
and reliable support for pan-European peaceful order. Just as 
we have firm expectations on the Russian side, we must also be 
ready to reach compromises with Russia regarding what is of 
importance to it. Yes, we want cooperation, but Russia's 
integration into the world economic system is only possible to 
the extent that Russia establishes a free market economy at 
home. The negotiations about a partnership and cooperation 
treaty must be successfully concluded now! As long as Russia 
says yes to Europe, we will not say no to Russia! 
  Thirdly, Ukraine is the cornerstone of strategic stability 
in all of East Europe. The economic crisis there and the 
tension with Russia affect us directly. They could have 
extensive consequences. I advocate that the EU should work 
toward reducing tension in Ukrainian-Russian relations. Is 
there really any kind of argument against a common EU policy 
toward Ukraine? We should also jointly work toward bringing 
Ukraine into our European cooperation network quickly! 
  Fourthly, we need a coherent EU policy toward the Baltics. 
The Baltic states can already display impressive reform 
results. My meeting with the Baltic foreign ministers on 9 
March strengthened my conviction that a united Europe needs the 
Baltic states. Along with France, we want to lead these 
countries increasingly closer to the EU. Appropriate European 
treaties should be concluded this year. The withdrawal of 
Russian troops must be completed in accordance with agreements 
and according to schedule. 
  Fifthly, what is more important than material transfer is 
the 
transfer of science and education from West to East. The 
development of competitive economies in the states of Central 
and East Europe requires enormous efforts in the areas of 
education, science, and research. To achieve a massive 
expansion of this exchange, what I have proposed to Alain Juppe 
is a joint initiative for an intellectual Marshall Plan for East 
Europe. Let us start the ball rolling, so that thousands of 
additional students and scientists from these countries can 
study and conduct research in the EU and so that more EU college 
professors can teach and study there. We still have a unique 
chance to revive pan-European cultural traditions going back 
hundreds of years. We must now seize this chance together! 
  Franco-German relations are also a very personal matter for 
me. I have been familiar with France and French culture since my 
youth. My first journey abroad, which saw me travel to France as 
a schoolboy, was an important experience for me. My French 
teacher, whom I shall never forget, was a particularly great 
admirer of France and he instilled in me a love of Romain 
Rolland and Georges Bernanos. For over 20 years, my home town 
of Hechingen has been linked with Joue-les-Tours in the garden 
of France, the Touraine. 
  Intellectual exchange is a hallmark of European history and 
culture. Today, we know that European integration does not lead 
to the disappearance of national identities. On the contrary, 
today, anyone who allows the images of history in Europe's 
capital cities to soak into him knows that the integration of 
Europe has led to the blossoming of national identities. Anyone 
who travels in your country today feels that "certaine idee de 
la France" [preceding words in French] of which De Gaulle spoke, 
irrespective of whether he visits Paris, Normandy, the Loire, or 
Provence. In the same way, Berlin, Munich, Dresden, and 
Magdeburg are unmistakably German. Anyone who understands that 
Germany has recovered itself and unity through the integration 
of Europe knows that Germany will proceed along the European 
path side by side with France.

  [Text] Hanover (ADN-Wirtschaftsdienst-Ost) -- The German 
Government evidently intends to make it easier to export high 
technology to the former East Bloc states. The HANNOVERSCHE 
ALLGEMEINE ZEITUNG reports that following the end of Cocom 
[Coordinating Committee for Multilateral Export Controls], the 
German Economics Ministry is currently looking into simplifying 
procedures for export permits. It will be possible in future to 
receive multiple export permits. Businesses would then only 
have to register their exports in retrospect. 
  Until now export procedures for high-performance computers 
or 
machine tools, for example, sometimes took over a year. Cocom, 
the agency responsible for this, was disbanded on 1 April. The 
Cocom list, specifying high technology items that were seen as 
sensitive in security policy terms and could thus not be sold to 
the former communist states, is thus no longer valid either. A 
special ruling had previously been needed for each individual 
transaction. 
  The Cocom states -- Japan, Australia, and all NATO states 
except Iceland -- have resolved to continue using the list as a 
basis for their decisions. The German Government wants to 
follow the United States in utilizing the new scope for 
maneuver, according to the paper. The new regulations will not, 
however, make arms exports any easier.

<F P=106> ["C.G."-signed report: "Latvian Ambassador Asks For German </F>
Help"] 
  [Text] Bonn, 7 April -- Latvian Ambassador to Germany 
[Andris] Kesteris has asked the Federal Government to join other 
Western states in supporting Latvia's sovereignty and to brand 
as a "provocation" the decree by Russian President Yeltsin on 
the planned establishment of Russian military bases. Kesteris 
said in an interview with FRANKFURTER ALLGEMEINE on Thursday [7 
April] that Moscow's denial of Yeltsin's intention to establish 
military bases in Latvia is questionable. The denial only 
stated that Yeltsin's statements were quoted "in the wrong 
context." The ambassador pointed out, however, that he saw 
copies of Yeltsin's original "document." It also mentioned 
Latvia. The agreement on the continued limited operation of the 
Russian radar station Skrunda, negotiated between Russia and 
Latvia, cannot be interpreted as an agreement on establishing a 
military basis, Kesteris stressed. Latvia has allowed Russia to 
operate the radar bases for four more years and has granted 
Moscow an additional one and a half years to dismantle the 
station. Kesteris pointed out that Russia is now apparently 
trying to influence the internal situation in Latvia with 
initiatives like Yeltsin's "document." In Latvia, a 
"controversial debate" about the agreement with Moscow is going 
on: "It is difficult to achieve a consensus in the country on 
the continued existence of the base for another five and a half 
years." Kesteris cited another possible reason for Moscow's 
behavior: "The Russian Government is too weak to implement the 
agreement in Russia. For this reason, Latvia is being provoked 
not to sign the agreement." The signing is scheduled for the 
end of April. "If Russia does not withdraw the document 
unequivocally, it will be very difficult for the Latvian 
president to travel to Moscow to sign the agreement." 
  The Foreign Ministry announced that Yeltsin's spokesman has 
denied statements about Latvia. The doubts concerning the 
negotiations between Russia and Estonia on the troop withdrawal, 
which arose during the 18th round of talks in Moscow on 
Wednesday and which have again questioned the withdrawal that 
was to be completed by 31 August, need not be the last word. 
Russia is facing pressure at home. Moscow's ultimatum that 
Estonia must issue residence permits for all 10,000 military 
pensioners and that, in addition to the money that has already 
been granted, it is to provide another $23 million for the 
construction of apartments for officers returning to Russia 
might be a tactical maneuver, it was pointed out. Another round 
of talks is likely to follow. Germany continues to demand that 
Russia should complete the troop withdrawal by 31 August. 
Yeltsin also announced the establishment of Russian military 
bases in several CIS republics. Bonn stated that Russia also 
maintains military bases in neighboring countries that used to 
belong to the Soviet Union. This normally takes place on a 
contractual basis.

<F P=106> [Article by Florian Gerster: "Personnel Is No Disposable </F>
Item That Can Be Changed at Will"] 
  [Text] It is difficult for the Bundeswehr to keep up with 
current developments. In the summer of 1990, a peacetime 
strength of 370,000 soldiers was stipulated. This figure, which 
was bindingly agreed upon during the Two Plus Four Talks with 
the former Soviet Union in 1990, seem to be the only basis for 
all considerations concerning the structure of the Armed Forces. 
However, it is based on structural considerations concerning the 
military services that were made at a time when the collapse of 
the East Bloc and Germany's reunification were just becoming 
apparent. 
  Thus, the goals of Army Structure 5, which was initiated in 
the middle of the 1980's and which has not yet been implemented 
completely, are still valid today. Moreover, the equipment of 
the Air Force and the Navy is still based on targets that did 
not yet take into consideration the fundamental 
security-political changes in Europe. The Federal Government, 
Mr. Ruehe in particular, has not made any useful proposals for 
the adaptation of the structures of the Armed Forces to the new 
situation that would help the Bundeswehr overcome the lack of 
orientation that was bound to develop. 
  As recently as during the 1993 budget debate, Chancellor 
Kohl 
and Defense Minister Ruehe still insisted vigorously on the 
planned strength of 370,000 soldiers and 155,000 civilian 
employees for the Armed Forces and the Bundeswehr 
administration. Even at the security conference in Munich on 5 
February, the chancellor confirmed these figures, despite the 
finance minister's announcement that 1.25 billion German marks 
[DM] have to be saved. He cited the tense situation in the 
former Yugoslavia and the uncertainitees of the Russian reform 
process as the reasons. 
  The fact that the Bundeswehr has already been reduced to a 
strength of 350,000 because of an acute shortage of funds is 
being described evasively as "structure-neutral variation." 
This term is nothing but the admission that the lack of 20,000 
soldiers is the utmost limit of what the Bundeswehr can handle 
without immediate changes concerning the structural objectives. 
A comparable gap only existed in the 1950's when the Bundeswehr 
was newly established. 
  The situation shows that the personnel structure of the 
Armed 
Forces is no longer determined by the goals of the defense 
policy but exclusively by the government's budget problems. The 
Bundeswehr Association has rightly commented on the government's 
most recent decision to reduce the defense budget, stressing 
that it deprives the Bundeswehr planning "of the financial 
basis, makes the government's often repeated intention to adhere 
to a strength of 370,000 men finally incredible, and that it 
will largely paralyze the system of training and exercises." 
  Nothing is to be added to the conclusion of the Bundeswehr 
Association that the austerity course will make maintenance and 
repair and urgently required structural improvements impossible 
in the next few years, which will lead to the closure of even 
more barracks and new burdens for the soldiers and their 
families. It is common knowledge among experts that the defense 
budget is no longer determined by the tasks of the Bundeswehr 
but is being used to fill gaps in other spheres. 
  The government's course not only reveals its inefficiency in 
the area of defense but also leads to an increasing lack of 
orientation among the troops and administration. This happens 
particularly at a time when the Army is exhausted because of the 
implementation of German unity. 
  Since the completion of German unity, the soldiers of the 
Bundeswehr and the civilian employees of the Bundeswehr 
administration have carried out Herculean labor in restructuring 
the Bundeswehr and in adapting to the new tasks. They succeeded 
in establishing Bundeswehr barracks in the new laender and in 
creating new administrative structures within a very short 
period. In addition, they had to handle difficult 
reorganization measures and the closure of barracks in the old 
laender. These far-reaching changes not only affected the 
soldiers involved but, above all, their families. 
  Some of the decisions on the deployment initiated earlier 
still have to be implemented or are in the process of being 
realized. Nothing is more important and urgent for the members 
of the Bundeswehr than planning continuity and security. 
Instead, however, they are confronted with the fact that the 
tight budget situation leads to unsystematic cutbacks and 
austerity measures in areas where a solid planning concept and 
an honest financial framework would have been necessary. None 
of the soldiers or civilian employees who were still involved in 
the restructuring process in a dedicated manner one year ago 
would have thought that the "peace dividend" would be 
distributed in such a haphazard manner with disastrous 
consequences for the barracks, units, and troops and for 
decisions on investments. 
  A Federal Government that has to fulfill a constitutional 
task vis-a-vis our Armed Forces must ensure security in spite of 
a decreased military threat and scarce funds. The main task of 
the Federal Government continues to be national defense. It 
must be in a position, together with the alliance partners, to 
deter or ward off external enemies who threaten Germany. 
Ensuring security also means equipping the Bundeswehr with 
sufficient personnel and material to meet its obligations within 
the alliance. 
  In spite of the disappearance of the East-West conflict and 
the dissolution of the Warsaw Pact, Germany's territorial 
sovereignty can only be guaranteed in the future if the North 
Atlantic Alliance can guarantee the territorial sovereignty of 
its member states. 
  I am not surprised that, after the end of the East-West 
confrontation, the NATO members who carried the main burden 
within the alliance in the past are now calling for a 
redistribution of the roles and of the spheres of 
responsibility. They increasingly point out the Atlantic or 
European responsibility of the alliance partners. At the same 
time, organizational structures like the Eurocorps which were 
viewed suspiciously in the past are being welcomed. Germany 
must be prepared that the range of tasks resulting from NATO 
obligations will make the preservation of Germany's defense 
capability more expensive. 
  As compared with the defense assignment, all other tasks of 
the Bundeswehr are secondary. This applies to the cases 
explicitly stipulated in the Basic Law and to an even greater 
extent to missions that may take place at the initiative of the 
Federal Government with the approval of the Bundestag. Until a 
decision is made by the Constitutional Court, they include all 
contributions by the Bundeswehr to the collective safeguarding 
of peace. Crisis management and the settlement of conflicts are 
the basis of the new planning. The Bundeswehr needs new 
structures. 
  However, these structures must not solely be determined by 
the financial situation of the state whose defense the 
Bundeswehr is to ensure, as is currently the case. Rather, the 
structures must be task-oriented. Every political decision on 
the structures of the Armed Forces must be based on 
comprehensive considerations. All these considerations are 
linked with each other and depend on each other. The isolated 
examination of individual components as a basis for decisions is 
useless. 
  When planning for the Armed Forces, one must begin with the 
task. It reflects the threat analysis and the risk assessment, 
as well as the leeway for action and willingness to act. The 
Federal Government defined the task of the Bundeswehr in the 
Guidelines on Defense Policy by the federal defense minister, 
dated 26 November 1992. What is remarkable about this basic 
document designed to outline the principles of security policy, 
the task of the Bundeswehr and the major tasks of the Armed 
Forces, are the references to threat and the avoidance of risks. 
  The core of the threat analysis is the statement that 
Germany 
is no longer within the immediate range of a state capable of a 
strategic offensive or of capturing territory. "Germany is no 
longer a front-line state." Another passage reads: "The most 
dangerous case of a large-scale aggression has become highly 
unlikely." Assessing the risks posed by the successor states of 
the Soviet Union, the document reads: "A threat for Germany or 
its allies can be ruled out in the foreseeable future if the 
(NATO) Alliance preserves its ability for flexible deployment 
and strategic balance." 
  As compared with an early warning time of a maximum of 14 
days during the Cold War, plans are now based on a militarily 
usable warning time of at least one year. The document draws 
the following final conclusion: "Military conflicts that might 
endanger Germany's existence have become unlikely." The 
Guidelines on Defense Policy have the character of a decree in 
the defense ministry and are the "binding basis for the work in 
the organizational spheres.... and for the safeguarding of 
German military interests toward the outside." 
  The threat analysis of the Social Democratic Party of 
Germany 
[SPD] is exactly the same. The resolutions on foreign and 
security policy adopted by the party conference, which took 
place in Wiesbaden on 16-19 November 1993, point out that the 
collapse of the Soviet Union and the end of the East-West 
conflict have fundamentally changed international relations, 
particularly on our continent. This opens up big opportunities 
but also involves dangers. On the one hand, the dramatic 
changes have made it possible to extend peace, freedom, and 
prosperity to the whole of Europe. On the other hand, the 
negative phenomena accompanying the far-reaching changes that 
may entail poverty, disorientation, and bloodshed hold the 
danger of a relapse into authoritarian regimes as a result of 
ethnic-national conflicts, and of an exacerbating tendency 
toward settling conflicts with the use of force. 
  For this reason, the Bundeswehr, together with its partners, 
must provide military protection while at the same time actively 
participating in disarmament and confidence-building measures 
throughout Europe. The Bundeswehr must continue its efforts to 
prevent war and remain capable of effective defense within NATO. 
  However, the government coalition arrives at a different 
conclusion from the Social Democratic opposition concerning the 
structures of the Bundeswehr. One of the major reasons is that 
the government parties advocate a more comprehensive leeway for 
military action for the united Germany, and that they orient 
themselves to a greater extent toward a role in foreign and 
military policy which they themselves are depriving of the 
financial means. This applies particularly to Bundeswehr 
missions outside the NATO area and military UN operations that 
go beyond blue beret missions. Presently, the dilemma of the 
Bundeswehr is that the task of the political leadership goes far 
beyond what the financial resources permit. 
  It is useless in this respect to continue the quarrel 
between 
the government and the opposition concerning the possibilities 
and limits of Bundeswehr missions outside the borders defined by 
Article 87a of the Basic Law. The Constitutional Court will 
make a binding decision this summer. Before the SPD brought the 
matter before the court in Karlsruhe, it launched initiatives 
for a clarifying completion of Articles 24 and 87a of the Basic 
Law, aimed at limiting the participation of the Bundeswehr in UN 
missions to peacekeeping missions (including military emergency 
measures) and at rejecting military operations on the part of 
the parties to ae conflict. 
  The Christian Democratic Union/Christian Social Union 
[CDU/CSU] objected to these restrictions. With the 
participation in the Somalia mission, Chancellor Helmut Kohl and 
Defense Minister Ruehe even forced the smaller coalition partner 
Free Democratic Party of Germany to appeal to the Constitutional 
Court. If the CDU/CSU continues to point out the vast 
difference between the SPD's position and the defense policy of 
the federal government and of the parties that support it, this 
applies exclusively to the military leeway demanded by the 
CDU/CSU. 
  It is wrong from a security-political viewpoint and harmful 
for the future of the Bundeswehr to base all future structural 
considerations beyond 1995 on an army strength of 370,000 
soldiers. After the disappearance of the East-West threat, the 
larger Germany does not need an army of the same actual strength 
as during the Cold War. 
  Germany today is surrounded by friends on all sides. The 
states to the south, west, and north even want to shape a common 
foreign and security policy, as in the European Union. Our 
Eastern neighbors want to establish closer economic and military 
ties with us. Because of this strategic center position, we are 
basically protected against direct aggression. 
  Moreover, our allies on our eastern border can also expect 
a solidarity security contribution that is in our very own 
interest. After all, security precaution within the European 
Union means that every member state can rely on joint solidary 
action to ensure the security of all in the future. 
  A beginning was made in a treaty on European Union. The 
common military framework will be the Western European Union. 
This results in a multinational operation profile of our Armed 
Forces that is oriented toward Europe. Flexibility and 
professionalism are needed. The changed strategic and 
operational framework conditions require a Bundeswehr concept 
that is based on flexibility and a high degree of 
professionalism. The concept must also provide for an increase 
in the number of soldiers after a longer warning period, made 
possible by compulsory military service. In addition, there 
must be a militia element. 
  The range of tasks of these Armed Forces includes the direct 
defense of the country and the defense of the boundaries of the 
NATO alliance. Smaller local conflicts are the more likely 
scenario in the foreseeable future. Large-scale military 
operations with a Europe-wide conduct of operations or 
interventions on the model of the Gulf war are of less 
significance. 
  The current framework conditions allow a drastic reduction 
in 
the mechanized major formations of the Bundeswehr but no 
renunciation of the reinforcement component for the allies or 
our own forces outside our territory. This applies mainly to 
the Army. The conditions in the Air Force and the Navy are 
different. They depend to a large extent on the integration in 
a European security architecture. 
  How long do the European states want to afford the luxury of 
national massed concentration? Is a European labor division not 
necessary for cost reasons? This makes it clear what structural 
changes the Bundeswehr will be facing in the middle of the 
1990's. An operational profile that includes both the classical 
national defense and international police operations requires 
military units with a broad range of possible operations and a 
high level of professionalism. They must be in a position to 
carry out operations even in the event of an escalation at high 
survivability, and they must be able to end conflicts quickly. 
At the same time, they must not lose the ability to form the 
spine of the Armed Forces as the core units. On the basis of 
the current warning periods, the Armed Forces are capable of 
carrying out large-scale operations within the framework of a 
common European defense system. 
  The crisis reaction forces in all three military services 
will have to assume different tasks from the units whose main 
job is to defend the country. A dual system with professional 
units consisting of soldiers who sign up for longer periods and 
with national defense units on a militia basis requires a 
careful examination as to the distribution of resources, fitness 
for operations, and the social acceptability within the 
Bundeswehr and its impact outside the Bundeswehr. 
  The shaping of the future structures of the Armed Forces 
will 
depend on the way and the probability of the requirements within 
the national and international framework. Forms of operation 
have to be developed in which units can be combined in 
accordance with the tasks. To achieve this, combinations from 
all organizational spheres and of the military services must be 
permissible. However, it must be prevented that, like on the 
occasion of the Somalia mission, specialists are gathered like 
heroes and that special operational units are formed on this 
basis. 
  As a result, the troop loses its operability, and the 
operational unit must first develop its own identity. 
Structural changes and reductions of the strength will affect 
the Army most. The goal is the formation of elements for units 
on the basis of the brigade as the smallest possible operational 
unit capable of conducting operations. It should be possible to 
combine these units in the above described sense for every 
individual task. 
  For these kinds of organization, one can also use something 
that has proven its worth, such as the command and support 
organization of the Army, which is planned for 1995. 
Alternatively, it must be examined whether the hierarchical 
command structure of the Army can be tightened. Thus, following 
the French model, one could perhaps even do without the level of 
brigades and enable the level of battalions to engage in 
operational command in a regimental structure. For the Air 
Force and the Navy, there are less serious structural changes in 
the offing. However, for these partial forces, too, a command 
and communication ability that crosses partial forces and can be 
used multinationally becomes necessary. 
  In the resolutions of the party congress in Wiesbaden on 
foreign and security policy, the SPD demanded that the 
Bundeswehr must exclusively and visibly correspond to its 
defensive assignment in terms of size, structure, armament, 
training, and operational concept. In case of scarce budgetary 
means, as now exist, savings can be achieved almost exclusively 
by reducing the personnel of the Armed Forces, if the 
functioning of the Armed Forces will not suffer. However, 
personnel is not something that can be changed arbitrarily at 
any time. 
  Therefore, the SPD gives priority to the social 
compatibility 
of personnel reduction. If, in this connection, the target of 
300,000 soldiers is mentioned for the time after 1995, it must 
be taken into consideration that such a reduction of personnel 
by 70,000 soldiers is linked with the closing down of a 
considerable number of barracks. As a figure for orientation, 
one can say that if there are about 1,000 soldiers less, one of 
the barracks must be closed. Any communally or locally oriented 
politician is aware of the social dynamite that is hidden behind 
such figures for the affected community or region. After all, 
an entire armored infantry battalion with its soldiers 
constitutes purchasing power of about 30 million marks per year. 
  The structural changes for the Armed Forces, which the 
Federal Government has to carry out in line with its drastic 
thrift decisions in the individual budget number 14 in order to 
keep the Bundeswehr functioning, need time for planning and 
implementation. It is possible to reduce the Armed Forces 
relatively quickly. We have been shown this by the U.S. Forces, 
which have reduced their strength from 1.8 to 1.4 million 
soldiers, the number of Army divisions from 14 to 12, and the 
number of combat ships from 434 to 413. 
  The German Armed Forces have already been reduced 
drastically, if one adds the Bundeswehr and National People's 
Army in the reunitied Germany. In this process, however, the 
Bundeswehr had the advantage that it suffered less closings and 
layoffs than the other German army. In any future reduction, 
however, it must be taken into account that the potential 
ability to increase the national defense forces must be 
preserved. 
  It will not always be possible to implement a new profound 
structural change in the Army immediately after the 
implementation of the Army Structure Number 5 as of 1995. 
However, already in 1992 and 1993, it was possible and urgently 
necessary in the Defense Ministry to undertake a self-critical 
inventory. It would have been necessary to convene a defense 
structure committee, as this was done in 1970-72 by Defense 
Minister Helmut Schmidt with excellent results for the Armed 
Forces. 
  The new Defense Structure Committee could have even relied 
on 
the preparatory work done by the past committee. Thus, planning 
time could have been saved, which is valuable time for thorough 
basic work. There is the specific danger today that structural 
planning will be started only after the Bundestag elections and 
thus too late. The Bundeswehr's current structure does not 
correspond to the situation. 
  The Federal Government is stubbornly sticking to this 
structure, but it is not providing the money necessary to keep 
it functioning. There are only two alternatives: more money or 
another structure that is smaller. For the Armed Forces' 
assignment, there applies the following: clear orientation 
toward the assignment given by the Basic Law and priority for 
alliance defense.

<F P=106> [Report by Guenther Gillessen: "The Bundeswehr Budget Is </F>
Being Plundered; There Is No Money for Exercises, Training, and 
Maintenance"] 
  [Text] Hildesheim, 6 April -- No other detail in the 
defense commissioner's report has received so much attention as 
the remark that in one training company the firing of a shot had 
to be simulated with "bang" and an explosion with "whoom," 
because there was a lack of practice ammunition. Recently, more 
signs than "bang" and "whoom" have demonstrated that the 
Bundeswehr is underfinanced. The structure, consisting of size, 
assignment, and funds, is now breaking up. The long-term 
investment plan for the army, designed for the 15 years up to 
the year 2007, has now been cut by 24 billion German marks [DM] 
(of DM56 billion). This makes impossible not only the renewal 
of some of the equipment, but also the procurement of entirely 
new weapons systems. The cuts affect the navy and the air force 
in a similar way. 
  The defense budget has now been cut in the last three years. 
In February of this year, it was reduced once more by DM1.25 
billion. The annual investment and procurement quota used to 
stand at 27-29 percent in the past. After the cuts of 
1992-1994, is has now plummeted to about 20 percent. At the 
level of the army, the renewal rate was even halved. After 
DM5.6 billion (1990), only DM2.4 billion have been made 
available this year for procurement and the modernization of 
facilities (barracks). 
<H5>  No Experience in Use of Major Items of Equipment </H5>
  Right now there is already a appalling lack of funds for 
exercises on training grounds: no money for rail transport, 
practice ammunition, gasoline, maintenance and spare parts, and 
no money for keeping conscripts as volunteers after their 
compulsory service and for exercise days for reservists. Worst 
hit are units that have to use major items of equipment, that is 
to say tank units, artillery, army aviation units, engineers. 
Training in such units requires experience in moving such large 
equipment most of all. 
  As far as engineers are concerned, funds have been cut for 
maintaining their construction machinery in civilian workshops. 
When a large part of the machinery can now no longer be 
maintained and has to be put out of service and people can be 
trained only with the help of the remaining machinery, then 
training has to be reduced. Engineers are still acquiring the 
licenses necessary for operating such machines, but they no 
longer acquire the experience for safe handling. The effects 
can be easily foreseen: The personal risk to the soldiers and 
the rate of damage to machines as a result of operating mistakes 
will increase. An absolute ban is currently in force on the 
building of temporary bridges to prevent certain components from 
wearing away, as they can only be replaced in two years. 
  In the army aviation units, the number of flying hours for 
liaison helicopters has been cut by more than half, from 62,700 
flying hours in 1987 to 27,800 in 1994, and for transport 
helicopters by 10 percent (from 55,650 to 49,800 hours). This 
is making it more difficult for the commanders of the major 
units to supervise their troops in garrisons that are dispersed 
over a larger area during practices. The safety of the aviation 
services is also affected if it is no longer possible to keep a 
sufficient number of pilots adequately trained. 
  In talks with commanders of the 21st Tank Brigade 
(Augustdorf) and the 1st Armored Infantry Brigade, with many of 
their battalion commanders, heads of company and batteries, one 
can learn of the distress that is now prevailing in the army, an 
impression that is shared by most of them. The "crisis reaction 
forces" (KRK) that can be quickly mobilized are slightly better 
off than the "main defense forces" (HVK). The 21st Tank Brigade 
of Augustdorf belongs to the first category, the 1st Armored 
Infantry Brigade (Hildesheim) to the second. 
  The budget item that is most important for the combat 
training of forces is funding for staying at training areas. 
This includes mainly practice ammunition, the cost of the rail 
transport of heavy arms, and the per diem allowance for the 
soldiers, referred to as "bush money" in the military jargon. 
The 21st Tank Brigade was allotted DM1.06 billion in "bush 
money" in 1992, while DM2.3 billion was provided for the rail 
transport of tracked vehicles to Bergen-Hohne. The rail 
transport of a single tank company on this track stands at 
DM130,000. So the funds only allow one transport of tanks, 
armored vehicles, and mortars for 15 companies and batteries. 
These funds permit two practices a year on the training area if 
one unit moves its tracked vehicles by rail and another takes 
them over at the training area and returns them to barracks at 
the end of the practice. 
  KRK units are allowed up to 30 days of practice a year, 
while HVK units can have no more than 25 now. Taking into 
account the time for shifting everything to the training areas 
and returning, the cancellation of practices involving heavy 
ammunition at weekends, and the cleaning of vehicles, only about 
25 days are actually left for the KRK forces and 20 for the HVK 
units. In the past, 30 days on the training area were regarded 
as the minimum for training, while now it is the maximum. 
Combat forces used to practice by the battalion, while now they 
only do so only in companies, and, in practice, only at the 
level of platoons, because one part of the company always has to 
act as the enemy. Thus, the individual soldier hardly ever 
experiences his own company as a combat unit, let alone the 
entire battalion. 
  In the past, there were 64 rounds of large-caliber practice 
ammunition for each gun barrel per year for combat tanks and 
artillery. Three years ago this was reduced to 44 units. Now 
it is only 30. Practicing with heavy mortars at the training 
area but then only being able to fire a maximum of two shots on 
a long day of training is demoralizing for the soldiers. 
"What," the gunner asks his commander, and the commander the 
battery head, "is the point of going to all the trouble of 
transferring everything to the training area, putting up the 
mortars, adjusting them, continually repeating identical aiming 
exercises with the gun or in the fire direction center -- what 
is the good of all the changes in position, when a single shot 
should be the `reward' of a whole day on the terrain?" 
  Soldiers must -- at least once, as the climax of their 
combat 
training -- see actual shooting and be able to hear the noise. 
They must be able to experience what they can do with their 
weapons and what effect these can have in a unit, also together 
with other arms. One does not have to describe that as "weapon 
proud." Yet, soldiers need trust and confidence in their own 
equipment and their own unit as a group and community to 
survive. They want to be challenged, but they also want to 
learn that they can do what they are asked to. It is such stuff 
that the troop's "morale" is made off. The cuts are undermining 
it. 
  Night operations training no longer exists in the army 
because there is hardly any pyrotechnical ammunition for light 
signals and the lighting of the combat area. One signal 
cartridge costs about DM2.30 -- but money is short. The same 
applies to low-altitude air defense at the level of all forces. 
In almost all special training, individual elements that do not 
belong to the essence of the training of the individual unit 
have to be left out. Commanders say that the main targets of 
training of recruits are still being achieved, yet the 
instructors disagree, and say that the army's resources were 
being drained. 
  Simulators help save training costs. Marksmanship training 
on the simulator in front of moving images on video films with 
combat noises is effective to a certain extent, because any 
decision or action taken by the soldiers is documented and can 
be discussed immediately afterwards. The objective of tank 
firing exercises and combat training is to recognize the enemy 
at an early stage, to fight him within 10 seconds, and to 
achieve an average score of 90 percent. Practice is everything. 
The first shot must count, and do so quickly, because otherwise 
the enemy is faster. Training on the simulator helps to save 
ammunition, gasoline, and wear and tear. Yet, it remains a 
solitary video game in a cell and cannot replace being in a real 
vehicle on the training area, the frictions and the experience 
of cooperation with others. It all boils down to the following: 
Training protects the soldier, training is the superior's 
obligation. Yet the ultimate superiors of the soldiers sit in 
parliament and do not see the consequences of restricted 
training. 
<H5>  Borrowing Is Inevitable </H5>
  To have heavy arms such as tanks and mortars on training 
areas and to have them used by several units to save transport 
costs makes sense. On the tank firing range at Castlemartin in 
Wales and on the Shilo training ground in Canada this is an old 
tradition. Yet it requires a maintenance unit on location as 
well as logistical organization. 
  Still, at home, it would probably be more expensive to keep 
all kinds of equipment in larger numbers and in all versions 
(for example three series of "Marder" combat vehicles) and the 
necessary repair units permanently on the exercise areas. On 
domestic grounds it is cheaper to have the equipment of one unit 
subsequently used by only one other unit of the same battalion 
and then returned. 
  Yet, since this practice was introduced, the rate of damage 
has significantly increased. After all, nobody takes as much 
care of what belongs to others -- the familiar weakness of 
socialism. No vehicle is as perfectly maintained as one's own. 
If a soldier returns another's tank after the practice 
something will "certainly" be damaged. (After a few days on the 
training area something will always be damaged.) The damage 
caused by someone else to "his" equipment would "certainly" not 
have happened to him. It upsets him and cannot be ignored. 
  The forced borrowing of large items of equipment causes 
exceptional frustration among the troops, and that is something 
that one hears again and again from every sergeant. It does 
indeed matter whether a vehicle is being driven below full 
capacity by someone who knows its "quirks" or by someone else 
who either cannot use its true potential (the conclusion is that 
the equipment "is not up to much" or causes damage (then the 
conclusion is that the weapons system is not up to anything). 
Borrowing undermines responsibility for and confidence in 
equipment. Economizing on transportation costs markedly more 
than maintenance. 
  Funds for maintenance have also been reduced. In the past, 
to economize, the Bundeswehr gave up a maintenance service of 
its own. In its origins, the Bundeswehr is no expeditionary 
force and has a network of civilian bases in its own country. 
Large repairs to normal commercial vehicles are awarded to 
civilian firms. Funds for such repairs in particular have 
become scarce, which is, for example, the case at the 12th 
Armored Infantry Battalion in Osterrode am Harz. The commander 
has requested DM80,000 for maintenance in 1994. It is assumed 
that DM55,000 will be approved, that is, 30 percent less. 
However, in the first quarter of this year, he already had to 
spend DM48,000, which includes bills from December of last year. 
Other units have mentioned similar figures. One can predict, 
without taking any risks, that in the second quarter, or in the 
third quarter at the latest, the civilian maintenance of 
military vehicles will collapse. At the Technical Supervisory 
Association, certificates have been denied and permits 
withdrawn. The demand for repair work will not disappear, but 
increase with each quarter. In addition, there will also be 
damage resulting from the fact that equipment is not used. 
  Personnel is the most important thing, however. The 
Bundeswehr finally has a corps of noncommissioned officers that 
one can only wish for. Almost every company now has a second 
lieutenant as was envisaged. The first sergeants, who command 
third and fourth platoons are masters of their job after years 
of advancement and experience. One sees that in the respect 
with which they are treated by officers and in the manner in 
which sergeants speak to officers. The conduct is strikingly 
open and friendly, although one does not get the impression that 
this is so at the expense of discipline. On the contrary, in 
relation to "internal leadership," it has probably never been so 
good before. Commanders talk about "high motivation." 
  Now in particular, however, they are being denied the 
possibility of taking on men performing national service who 
have discovered the Bundeswehr as a profession as longer-serving 
soldiers, either because vacancies to be filled by promotion or 
funds for future noncommissioned officers have been frozen, or 
because currently, every battalion has a three-month period 
during which men liable for military service cannot be taken on 
as a result of insufficient funds and thus companies remain 
"empty" for a three-month period. At the end of the year then, 
there is a shortage of noncommissioned officers or specialists, 
for example, drivers for vehicles transporting fuel and 
ammunition and mine-clearing vehicles. The training lasts about 
10 months. If men cannot then serve longer and achieve 
appropriate promotion, they are only available for the remaining 
two months of the basic military service period, and that is a 
poor investment. If that remains the case for several quarters, 
then units will experience substantial deficiencies. 
<H5>  Basic Facilities Are Being Affected </H5>
  In the meantime, the economy measures have greatly exceeded 
a 
healthy level of reducing resources. Basic facilities are being 
affected. The infrastructure at bases is not being renewed 
(kitchens, laundries). Demand will not disappear, but will pile 
up. The Bundeswehr can live with temporary difficulties for a 
time, assuming that the gaps that emerge now will be filled 
later. "We will survive. We will still achieve training 
objectives. The Bundeswehr can survive a lot. We will try to 
see this winter through." That is how the Lieutenant Colonel 
Bentler, the commander of the 12th battalion describes the 
situation in his unit. "We will try to see this winter 
through." But it will only be possible to see this winter 
through if it will be spring in a few months time. That is the 
tacit condition for the Bundeswehr to retain the will to tackle 
these difficulties. The new army inspector, Lieutenant General 
Bagger, has also said that the Bundeswehr can put up with much. 
  If the Bundestag and the government treat things as lightly 
as they have so far and will increasingly "test" how much 
soldiers put up with, as well the responsibility borne by their 
commanders, this patience will not disappear gradually, but will 
do so relatively suddenly, without warning. The military's 
inculcated obedience vis-a-vis the political leadership and 
public opinion makes it difficult for the military to convey the 
gravity of the situation with the domestic political noise that 
is customary in a democracy.

<F P=106> ["rmc/DW"-signed report: "Eurofighter Will Cost DM300 </F>
Million More Than Planned"] 
  [Text] Bonn -- The development of the Eurofighter 2000 
aircraft will probably cost more than originally planned. 
Germany's share in the development costs alone will at least be 
300 million German marks [DM] more than planned. An expert in 
the Federal Audit Court even expects the costs to increase by 
DM700 million. The reason is that, on the instructions of 
Defense Minister Volker Ruehe of the Christian Democratic Union, 
the industry must make the controversial Eurofighter less 
powerful and thus cheaper. In view of Ruehe's request to force 
the unit price of the European fighter aircraft below DM100 
million, the additional costs have become inevitable, the German 
general contractor, German Aerospace (Dasa) has stated. The 
DM300 million are made up of DM145 million caused by the longer 
duration of the project, DM100 million in inflation 
compensation, and a remainder resulting from a change in the 
guidelines for the calculation of profits. All in all, Dasa has 
requested DM570 million from the German defense budget for the 
development of the Eurofighter 2000. A government decision on 
the procurement of the fighter aircraft has been announced for 
1995.

<F P=106> [Unattributed report: "Economics Ministry Criticizes </F>
Bundesbank"] 
  [Text] Bonn, 6 April -- The Bundesbank is playing down the 
losses of German enterprises in the price contest in order to 
"take the wind out of the sails" of the debate on an excessive 
revaluation of the German mark, says the Federal Economics 
Ministry in an internal paper on the subject of the 
competitiveness of German industry. The remarks of the 
Bundesbank on the subject of price competitiveness are 
"inconsistent," complains the document. In its December report, 
the bank still spoke of a 10-percent deterioration in the 
competitiveness of German enterprises since the middle of 1992 
vis-a-vis enterprises from 15 European countries and of 
difficulties for German exporters on account of the revaluation 
of the mark. But in its February report, the bank claimed that 
there were no more problems with competitiveness. The reason 
for the inconsistency of the Bundesbank's statements is that the 
bank based its calculations of exchange rate variations on 
different time periods. But the question remains whether the 
Bundesbank is merely performing a political task and attempting 
to prevent attacks. 
  What is conspicuous is that the European Union Commission 
has 
also given the competitiveness of German exporters a worse 
assessment than the Bundesbank. In an internal report published 
in January, the commission underlined "a significant reduction" 
in Germany's competitiveness by 12 percent against the remaining 
European Union countries since September 1992. The Economics 
Ministry thinks the Bundesbank is playing down this fact. The 
ministry itself reckons that the revaluation of the mark has hit 
German exports "hard," a situation made even worse by seasonal 
weaknesses of trade partners. Last year (January to October 
1993), German exports fell by 23 percent against the same period 
in 1992, a decrease of over 70 billion marks vis-a-vis the 
European Union countries. Vis-a-vis Italy and Spain, which had 
devalued their currencies, the decrease was even more than 30 
percent. The latest positive developments in export figures are 
pleasing, but one must bear in mind the low starting position. 
In any case, the improved figures appear positive mainly 
vis-a-vis those countries where the latest currency exchange 
operations (devaluations vis-a-vis the dollar and yen) are 
considered to have played an important part. According to the 
ministry, there is "much to indicate" that the German export 
business has not yet fully digested the revaluation vis-a-vis 
European currencies. Therefore, the improvement to the 
situation will not be enough to make good the export losses. In 
order to contain the consequences of the revaluation, a forced 
devaluation strategy must be avoided at al costs. The document 
agrees with the Bundesbank on this last point.

<F P=106> ["ari"-signed report: "Foreign Demand Results in 2-Percent </F>
Increase in Industrial Production"] 
  [Text] Duesseldorf -- According to the Munich-based Ifo 
Institute, west German production will increase by approximately 
2 percent this year. Production of the processing industries 
declined by 7.7 percent in 1993. 
  Ifo expects a 5-percent real increase in export sales. 
Domestic sales, on the other hand, are expected to go up only 
slightly. 
  Positive stimuli by investments and stock cycles are clearly 
weakened by an increase in imports and declining private 
consumption. This was evident in the low domestic orders at the 
end of last year. 
  Forecasts for the major sectors of industry indicate 
differing results. Ifo expects a 1 to 2-percent decline (1993: 
minus 5.8 percent) in production of electrical goods, a 4 to 
5-percent decrease (minus 11.4 percent) in the textile industry, 
and an 8-percent decline (minus 9.9 percent) in the clothing 
industry. 
  West German mechanical engineering, which has lost 
approximately one-fifth of its production since 1990 (1993: 
minus 11.7 percent), can expect a slight increase of 
approximately 1 percent in 1994. 
  The electrical industry's capital goods sector will increase 
by some 3 percent (1993: minus 7.7 percent), which is partly a 
result of major supplies to eastern Germany. 
  In Ifo's view, production of pickup trucks and trucks, which 
declined by 25 percent in 1993, could stagnate even with foreign 
demand slightly increasing. Production of sedans and station 
wagons is, however, likely to increase by 5 percent, in spite of 
domestic supplies slightly declining (1993: minus 19.5 percent). 
  Due to stronger impulses from the domestic market, the 
chemical industry can expect production to increase by at least 
3 percent in 1994 (1993: minus 2.2 percent). Since steel 
consumption is going up again, the iron and steel producing 
industry is expected to increase by some 2 percent (1993: minus 
7 percent).

<F P=106> ["Stue" report: "Industrial Output in Western Germany </F>
Constant"] 
  [Text] Bonn, 5 April -- Industrial output in western 
Germany has not changed over the first two months of the year 
compared with January-February 1993. The FRG Economics Ministry 
has announced that the processing industry experienced 0.3 
percent growth. This is primarily due to production in the 
basic materials and producer goods industry, which was 4.3 
percent. In contrast, the output of investment and consumer 
goods was lower than during the same period last year. The 
construction sector reported an increase of 3.3 percent. A 
two-month comparison between January-February 1994 and 
November-December 1993 also shows that the activities of the 
producing industry remained generally constant. There were, 
however, different developments of output in individual sectors: 
The construction sector reported an increase of 7.5 percent; the 
production volume in mining went up slightly by 0.5 percent. In 
contrast, the processing industry experienced an 0.5-percent 
decline in output. In February 1994, west German industrial 
output went up by 1 percent in real and seasonally adjusted 
terms. In this connection, it must be taken into account that 
the January result was revised downward by 1.5 index points. 
The February increase was supported by mining and the 
processing industry. The ministry accounts for the production 
decline in the construction sector of 7 percent compared with 
the previous month, primarily with reference to the extremely 
cold weather.

<F P=106> [Commentary by Thomas Knipp: "Correction Instead of a </F>
Slump"] 
  [Text] Was that it? Is the correction on the 
international share markets already at the point of ending? One 
look at the development of leading market indicators around the 
middle of the week could give precisely that impression. After 
turbulent days with high losses in rates, the stockbrokers again 
enjoyed rising rates. It will probably be no more than a short 
breather, however. Anyone who looks at the basic data -- removed 
from all the hectic of the market, the hysteria of some brokers, 
and the often little illuminating comments by analysts -- comes 
to the conclusion: The international share markets are 
currently correcting the excesses of the past year. And this 
correction does not seem to be completely over yet. The danger 
of a profound slump is not particularly great, however. 
  Once again, the hedge funds and other professional 
speculators, such as the big banks' own brokers, smelled a rat 
in time. This was not difficult. In contrast to the majority 
of analysts, they correctly advocated the view that a rising 
prime rate in the United States would put a temporary end to the 
boom on the bond markets and then on the share markets. The 
speculators got rid of large amounts of those investments that 
were good in 1993, but had become too expensive in the end. 
  After losses in the quotations over the past few weeks, some 
of which were painfully high, it now seems that good advice is 
difficult to get. Many analysis, who predicted skyrocketing 
rates at the beginning of the year, are now exercising -- in 
conformity with the market -- slump scenarios. If, however, one 
takes a sober look at the situation, the following scenario 
seems to be likely: If interests in the United States continue 
to rise and there are prospects that the dollar will go up, more 
and more uncertain U.S. investors will take their leave from the 
share markets all over the world and will invest their money in 
domestic bonds. This leads to another correction of the 
excessively expensive dividend values. In the United Stats and 
on most of the European markets, shares are still too expensive, 
measured by the usual target figures and compared with the past. 
Conservative European investors will not be willing to fill the 
gap left behind by withdrawing U.S. capital at such high prices. 
Therefore, the correction on Wall Street and at the European 
stock exchanges will continue. 
  However, this very likely correction of values is laying the 
foundation for a new, well-founded upswing at the end of the 
year. The U.S. interest policy will probably lead to a 
low-inflation, constant growth in the Anglo-Saxon countries. 
Together with rising company profits, this will provide the 
stock markets with trust and higher rates; the European markets 
will follow with a slight delay. At the moment, there is no 
fundamental justification for a slump. Therefore, investors with 
courage and good nerves are selling shares and U.S. bonds; they 
are buying European bonds. And, being certain of generous 
interest revenues, they are waiting for the appropriate 
opportunity to purchase on the share markets.

  [Text] The threats in the nuclear dispute between the 
United States and North Korea are indeed terrifying. Kim 
Il-song's diplomats have foreboded that sanctions would be 
tantamount to a "declaration of war." U.S. Defense Secretary 
William Perry has warned that North Korea might feel provoked to 
trigger a war: "And we are accepting this risk." 
  The hazardous venture of the dictator in Pyongyang requires 
nerves of steel. All the neighbors of the isolated old Stalinist 
are worried that the Americans might not have such nerves. 
South Korea, Japan, and China have appealed to the Clinton 
administration to keep quiet. The Americans are anxious to 
prevent the worldwide spread of nuclear arms, while the Asians 
are worried that the confrontation might quickly escalate. 
  Asian patience will probably solve the Korean crisis rather 
than demands for quick punishment. Kim Il-song will be 82 next 
week. His bankrupt regime might implode before a test explosion. 
The South Koreans are as much afraid of the one as of the 
other. This is why they have now called for the return from 
threats to dialogue.

<F P=106> [Jochen Kummer report: "`Struggle for Freedom' of Kurds in </F>
Germany -- With Heroin and Blackmail"] 
  [Text] Last week, scenes from Kurdish terrorism on German 
soil dominated television screens and front pages. The 
prohibited terrorist Workers Party of Kurdistan [PKK] turned 
Germany into a theater of war: It controlled nationwide highway 
blockades and attacked policemen, it laid fires, and had fanatic 
compatriots set themselves on fire. 
  At the same time, two short police reports were 
inconspicuously carried in the local sections of Hamburg 
newspapers. 
  The HAMBURGER ABENDBLATT reported on 24 March: "For months, 
a group of three young Kurds aged between 13 and 15 sold 5 grams 
of heroin to one addict alone every other day. Now, 
plainclothes policemen have arrested the dealers. They carried 
20 grams of heroin, 30 grams of hashish, and 900 German marks 
[DM]. An arrest warrant had already been issued for the 
15-year-old boy, who is wanted as a drug dealer. The three 
Kurds live in an apartment for young people in the City of 
Hamburg." 
  DIE WELT reported on a new case on the next day, 25 March: 
"In St. Georg, plainclothes policemen have caught two Kurdish 
asylum-seekers (15 and 17 years old) in the act of dealing and 
found 55 grams of heroin. The 15-year-old boy was ordered to 
leave the country in 1991, his accomplice is facing deportation." 
  The drug sales to addicts in Germany are one of the most 
important sources of money for the Kurds to finance their 
terrorism in Germany and their struggle against Turkey. A 
second source is the extortion of protection money. 
  These two forms of Kurdish organized crime does not present 
their announcement -- that is, that there will be peace again 
after the riots of the past few days, and their violence, which 
they call their "struggle for freedom" -- in a favorable light: 
They are part of a strategy. Germany, as a prosperous and 
liberal country, is a financially profitable place of rest for 
the Kurds. 
  As the Duesseldorf Higher Regional Court realized, since 
1984 
Germany has been the European focus of the PKK, which has its 
headquarters in Cologne. Meanwhile, about 500,000 Kurds have 
settled in Europe -- 400,000 of them in Germany. About 40,000 
Kurds in Germany are classified as PKK sympathizers and about 
400 as members. They entered the country legally as respectable 
workers with Turkish citizenship, they came as asylum-seekers, 
or they were illegally taken to Germany. 
  It is no problem to accommodate the people smuggled by 
Kurdish gangs: Kurds who ask for asylum here are entitled to 
accommodation, food, and clothing. Those who entered the 
country illegally easily found refuge with clan members, 
friends, or relatives. 
  The commander and secretary general of the Marxist-Leninist 
"cadre party," PKK, is Abdullah Ocalan. According to findings 
of the German intelligence services, he is staying, with his 
string-pullers, in Damascus, Syria. 
  "The orders for attacks and demonstrations come from 
abroad," 
Ernst Uhrlau, president of the Hamburg Office for the Protection 
of the Constitution, says. A "Central Committee" of the PKK in 
Europe coordinates the activities; the so-called area committees 
are subordinate to it. 
  By Ocalan's order, the PKK organized six large-scale waves 
of 
attack in West Europe and Germany in 1992 and 1993. About 600 
perpetrators participated in about 50 attacks in European-wide 
violent actions on 24 June 1993. On 4 November, about 60 
violent attacks of Kurds on Turkish institutions and private 
houses were ascertained all over the FRG. 
  As a result, the PKK was banned in Germany. The 35 Kurdish 
groups that were prohibited at the same time as the PKK have 
disguised themselves with harmless names, but, according to 
findings of Germany security authorities, they are in reality 
arms of the PKK octopus that are registered as 
"suborganizations" in the local registers of associations, such 
as: Kurdistan Art and Cultural Center in Nuremberg and 
surroundings -- registered association, Kurdish Women's Center 
in Leverkusen -- registered association, International 
Friendship in Munich -- registered association, Center of Media 
Culture in Hagen -- registered association, Mesopotamian 
Cultural Association in Bremen -- registered association, 
Kurdish Cultural Center in Hamburg and surroundings -- 
registered association, etc. 
  A Kurd called Kani Yilomaz, who acts on the direction of 
Ocalan, acts as the spokesman of the PKK leadership in Europe. 
It was he who propagated the PKK's preparedness to discontinue 
its violent actions in Germany this week. 
  Apparently, the Kurds' drug deals in Germany yield enormous 
profits for the war against Turkey. This year in January, the 
Frankfurt special commission "Palu" reached the assessment that 
the Rhine-Main area is increasingly becoming the turntable for 
Kurdish heroin smugglers. According to findings of the Federal 
Office of Criminal Investigation, Kurds and Turks are the main 
suppliers of heroin. 
  Young Kurds deposited drug money in plastic bags at the 
Lindenstrasse post office in Hamburg. A Joint Drug Squad (GER) 
of the customs authorities and the police investigated. "Every 
day, 15-year-old boys came to the small post office and 
deposited cash in plastic bags," a GER officer said in February 
1993. The amounts ranged from DM10,000 to DM200,000 per deposit. 
  The investigators had the money -- mainly small bills 
packed in newspaper -- examined in a laboratory: There was 
always heroin sticking to the bills. The major part of the 
money was sent to a handful of Kurdish men in Bingol, Elazig, 
and Palu in eastern Turkey. According to findings of the 
police, most of the dealers who are arrested in Hamburg's 
streets come from these regions. 
  Within six months, Kurdish dealers deposited DM80 million in 
cash at Hamburg's smallest post office; 187 deposits were 
identified by the GER. The transfer of DM750,000 and DM900,000 
was proved against two Kurdish dealer organizations. 
  There is a mosque on a street parallel to Lindenstrasse, 
where the post office that drug dealers favor for deposits is 
located. Since the end of 1992, drug deals had flourished there 
so much that visitors to the mosque repeatedly complained to the 
police. Plainclothes policemen and the mobile police watched 
the open scene for six weeks. 
  An inn near the mosque turned out to be the dealers' meeting 
point. They used the continuous tangle of people around the 
mosque to cover their illegal deals. They acted skillfully 
under the protection of unsuspecting compatriots. In 
mid-February 1993, the police intervened and arrested 70 Kurdish 
drug dealers. Arrest warrants were issued for 41 of them. More 
than half of the arrested persons were younger than 21 years: 
26 suspects were between 14 and 16, and 17 suspects were 
between 17 and 21 years old. Apparently, three children between 
12 and 13 were used as drug couriers. 
  Kurdish children, some of whom arrive as "unaccompanied 
refugee children," prove to be well instructed: If they are 
seized by the police as not criminally responsible drug dealers, 
they will not be bothered by German punitive justice. The 
social welfare offices of the districts are responsible for such 
children, for example, in Hamburg. As is shown by the 
abovementioned police report, the City of Hamburg provides such 
Kurds with apartments for young people. 
  The roads of Kurdish money transfers seem to be 
inexhaustible. Policewomen found DM45,000 in the brassieres and 
panties of Kurdish women when they were subjected to carefully 
directed checks at Fuhlsbuettel airport in Hamburg. The spicy 
aspect of the case was that the women belonged to a family who 
had flown in from Palu in Turkey at the expense of the German 
state, in order to identify a Kurdish drug dealer in court. 
  The second special field of the Kurds is the extortion of 
protection money. With this method, they cash donations for 
their political struggle. 
  In Berlin, where 50,000 Kurds live, Kurds and Turks are so 
active in this field that the police established a special 
investigation group in March 1993. Hans-Ulrich Voss, managing 
director of the Berlin Criminal Investigation Department, 
described how the collection of donations works: "First" PKK 
representative approach businessmen "very politely" and ask for 
"donations" for the struggle for liberation. DM200 are 
requested from owners of kebab stalls, while owners of travel 
agencies and insurance agencies have to pay up to DM20,000 -- 
these amounts are often requested every month. 
  Turkish private persons are visited at home late at night. 
Their donations are calculated according to the size of the 
Turkish family's car. Hesitant victims are brought to heel by 
referring to one's knowledge of the children's route to school. 
  The shop windows of those Turks who still refuse to pay are 
broken or incendiary devices are thrown into the shops. With 
such attacks, the Kurds achieve a welcome additional effect: 
According to initial appearances, German right-wing extremists 
are initially blamed for such attacks. 
  However, the Berlin special investigation group discovered: 
"Collectors of donations" from Turkey, not -- as originally 
assumed -- xenophobic Germans, are responsible for many 
destroyed shop windows and arson attacks in Berlin-Kreuzberg. 
  According to Berlin experiences, only about 10 percent of 
the 
victims admit that they have been blackmailed; 10 percent claim 
that they pay "voluntary donations." The rest, 80 percent, are 
silent. 
  In Frankfurt on Main, the Municipal Office granted licenses 
for 2,500 "public houses and restaurants" -- 40 percent of which 
were to foreigners. Frankfurt senior detective officer Roland 
Ullmann estimates that "there is hardly anybody who does not 
pay."

  [Text] Paris, April 7 (AFP) -- French Defence Minister 
Francois Leotard called Thursday [7 April] for evacuation 
procedures to be set up for the eventuality of crises "in black 
Africa and North Africa" with or without the agreement of local 
governments. 
  Commenting on the fighting in Rwanda following the death of 
the Rwandan and Burundi presidents in an aircrash said to have 
been caused by unknown attackers, Leotard said that France and 
its military chiefs of staff were preparing for the evacuation 
of French nationals. 
  It was to be expected that such procedures would be required 
increasingly often in the future, notably in black Africa and 
North Africa, he told reporters here. 
  The evacuations could be carried out with the cooperation of 
local authorities, who would facilitate access to ports and 
airports and provide radio liaison, or, in cases of war, without 
their cooperation. 
  France last year called on its nationals resident in Algeria 
to pull out of the North African country following a wave of 
attacks on foreigners by Islamic fundamentalists.

  [Text] Paris, April 7 (AFP) -- French Defence Minister 
Francois Leotard called Thursday [7 April] for air strikes 
against Serb forces attacking the Bosnian Moslem enclave of 
Gorazde, saying the means to launch them were already in place. 
  "The planes are there, the pilots are there, it is perfectly 
possible, technically," he told a small group of journalists, 
saying that UN Security Council Resolution 824 could be invoked, 
if the "political will" existed. 
  The resolution, agreed on May 6 last year, allows for use of 
force in case of attacks on UN-designated safe areas in Bosnia, 
of which Gorazde is one of six. "I have made it known that we 
should enforce Resolution 824," he said. 
  Leotard said air strikes "are technically feasible, weather 
permitting," and stressed the importance of "enforcing all 
resolutions of the UN." 
  Fighting around the eastern Bosnian enclave has killed 64 
and 
left 301 wounded in the last nine days, according to Radio 
Sarajevo. It said Thursday that Serb forces were regrouping and 
that fighting was less intense. 
  Earlier Thursday a team of 11 UN observers and liaison 
officers reached the besieged enclave, after being held up en 
route by Serb forces at Rogatica, around 40 kilometres (25 
miles) from the enclave. 
  U.S. authorities, who have been reluctant to threaten the 
use 
of airpower over the situation in Gorazde, said Wednesday that 
they did not rule out the possibility of air strikes there.

<F P=106> [Interview with Foreign Minister Alain Juppe by "P.S."; </F>
place and date not given: "Moralism Is Often an Easy Way Out"] 
  [Excerpt] [passage omitted] [LIBERATION] Why did you 
decide to normalize relations with China as soon as you took 
over at the Quai d'Orsay [Foreign Ministry] in April 1993? 
  [Juppe] You cannot continue a quarrel with a country like 
China for many obvious reasons -- economic, political, 
strategic, demographic, and so forth. In addition, the dialogue 
had been broken off without there being any major difference 
between our foreign policies. It was a question of aircraft and 
frigates -- an issue which was certainly not inconsiderable for 
our industries, but which did not justify this quarrel lasting 
more than two years. Especially in view of the fact that it is 
not impossible to gain on this side (China) what we have lost on 
the other (Taiwan). 
  [LIBERATION] And yet no promise of contracts is expected 
from this visit. 
  [Juppe] It is not a commercial visit. There is a great deal 
of work to be done to regain ground and that will take time. 
The aim is simply to improve a political climate which had 
deteriorated greatly. 
  [LIBERATION] Are you writing off human rights and the memory 
of the 1989 massacre in Beijing? 
  [Juppe] No. We will be accused of that, of course. But I 
will discuss it as I have already done each time I have received 
Mr. Qian Qichen (Chinese foreign minister). When Vietnam 
becomes one of our foreign policy priorities, in what terms is 
the human rights problem raised? We condemn the situation, we 
express our demands, but we are nonetheless making Vietnam one 
of our main targets. 
  [LIBERATION] Does that not present you with a problem? 
  [Juppe] Does it present a problem to the United States, 
which has still not questioned the most favored nation clause 
which it has granted to China? It has already closed the 
Tienanmen Square chapter. I met with the Dalai Lama (spiritual 
and religious leader of Tibet living in exile in India) during 
his stopover in Paris. What we are saying is clear, we are not 
abandoning any of our principles. But I do not conclude from 
that that we should close the door on China. Or, if we do, we 
would have to quarrel with three-fourths of the world. We would 
be on our own. 
  [LIBERATION] In practice, what are you going to do? 
  [Juppe] Tell the Chinese leaders during our talks that this 
problem worries us. Possibly give lists of names (of political 
prisoners) to draw attention to particular prisoners, as we have 
done in many other countries. 
  [LIBERATION] Why impose sanctions on South Africa, propose 
sanctions against North Korea, and not against China? 
  [Juppe] No country in the world has suggested that the 
Security Council should impose sanctions against China. In 
South Africa's case, there was a consensus on the part of the 
whole international community. Why stand alone in the case of 
China? 
  [LIBERATION] Do you think that China is moving in the right 
direction in this sphere? 
  [Juppe] Compared with the Tienanmen Square period, the 
progress is inadequate but it exists. But I believe very firmly 
in the logic of modernization and development. What is 
happening in China will make the system of repression untenable. 
It is this card we must play. While, of course, ensuring that 
it does not take another 50 years. Even if the Chinese time 
frame is not exactly the same as ours. 
  [LIBERATION] Do you think France was wrong to welcome and 
help the Chinese dissidents after 1989? 
  [Juppe] No. We can help them, and the Chinese must be told 
that we are not happy with the current situation. We must find 
a balance between indifference and excessive zeal. Of course, 
it is not easy. Moralism is often an easy way out.

<F P=106> [Report by Jacques Patoz: "The Gaullists' Agitation"] </F>
  [Text] The selection [by the UDF--French Democratic Union] 
of Dominique Baudis [as leader of the majority's European 
election list] is creating controversy within the Gaullist 
movement. But [RPR -- Rally for the Republic President] Jacques 
Chirac is saying that the single list is not in question. 
  It must be said that the RPR did resign itself easily to 
abandoning the leadership of the majority list in the European 
elections to a UDF member. Jacques Chirac had to exert pressure 
on his "comrades" for them to agree. He only did so because it 
was anticipated that the list would be headed by Jean-Francois 
Deniau. Giscard's former minister is not extremely 
pro-European. It has not been forgotten that during the campaign 
for the referendum on the Maastricht Treaty, Deniau hesitated 
for a long time before finally coming out in favor of the "yes" 
vote. He could therefore be regarded as an acceptable list 
leader. The need not to spark off a division in the 
parliamentary Right one year before the presidential election 
justified this sacrifice. With the obviously unexpected 
selection of Baudis, everything could be called into question 
again. 
  The mayor of Toulouse does not have the Gaullists' support 
to 
say the least. For the majority of them, who opposed the 
Maastricht Treaty, the selection of Baudis, whose commitment to 
Europe is extremely determined, looks like a provocation. For 
the time being, Chirac is adhering to the status quo. He has 
not commented in person. But he has delegated some of his close 
aides in making it known that he does not think that his 
partners' choice called into question the principle of the 
single list. 
  The whole question is whether he will succeed in imposing 
this viewpoint. While it was thought that the UDF would choose 
Jean-Francois Deniau, Bernard Pons and Philippe Seguin had 
reaffirmed that the liberal federation's decision should be 
ratified by the RPR. What has happened will not encourage them 
to remain silent. Jacques Chirac cannot ignore that. But what 
solution can be found? Aware that the discontent is no less 
within the Republican Party, some are proposing alternative 
solutions which could be accepted by a section of the UDF. 
Jean-Jacques de Peretti is reviving the idea of selecting Alain 
Juppe. Pierre Mazeaud is suggesting that the RPR appoint its 
own head of list and that the two parties then meet to make a 
choice. Others are already envisaging the possibility of an 
autonomous RPR list which Philippe Seguin could head. Whatever 
happens, the parliamentary group in the National Assembly met 
yesterday evening. The movement's political office will meet 
today. The discussions are likely to be lively.

<F P=106> [Unattributed article: "Mr. Balladur Withdrew CIP To `Avoid </F>
Unnecessary Divisions'"] 
  [Text] In his first public address since the withdrawal of 
his youth wage measure (CIP), Edouard Balladur acknowledged on 
Tuesday, 5 April, during the 1930 newscast on France-3 
television that there "had been a misunderstanding between some 
of the country's youth and the government." He explained that 
he had abandoned the measure in order to remain "true to (his) 
philosophy" of "fostering unity among the French as much as 
possible" and "avoiding any unnecessary divisions." 
  The prime minister said that he was "worried" by the 
violence 
which tainted a number of demonstrations and stated that 
"resorting to violence in a society is extremely dangerous. In 
Paris and a number of other cities, we have witnessed 
unacceptable violence for which, incidentally, the vast majority 
of young demonstrators were not to blame." He added: "This is 
a sign that we now face problems of moral, social, and national 
cohesion in our country, in particular in a number of cities, 
problems which we must address." Therefore, according to the 
prime minister, "together with unemployment and jobs, with 
training for young people, the problem of major cities, of 
integration into French society and [the promotion of] its 
values is a major challenge for our future." 
  Mr. Balladur also stated that general implementation of the 
five-year legislationt [on job creation] will take place "within 
a month," after all relevant orders have been published. He 
added that he had "requested that, from now on, the people 
affected be informed ahead of time, that they be given the 
opportunity to voice their opinion, in short, that things be 
done as part of a consultation process."

  [Text] Today, the Socialist and Communist Party groups in 
the National Assembly, as well as some members of the Republique 
et Liberte group, proposed the first no-confidence motion 
against the Balladur government. 
  Drawn up on the initiative of the Socialist Party, the 
motion 
criticizes the Balladur government's record since it came to 
power a year ago and calls for the repeal of the five-year law 
on employment. 
  The 83 MPs who signed the motion say that the law "relies on 
the deregulation of labor, the massive insecurity of 
employment...and the undermining of the status of employees."

<F P=106> [Unattributed article: "Defense Programming Law Under </F>
Development"] 
  [Text] Yesterday, Francois Mitterrand chaired a Defense 
Council meeting on the 1995-2000 military programming law, which 
will then be adopted by the Council of Ministers before its 
submission to the spring session of parliament. In line with 
the defense white paper, the law will give precedence to 
equipment currently being manufactured as opposed to research 
and development programs (development of prototypes). According 
to a senior defense official, "delaying large armament programs 
some more was quite a tempting option," but "we preferred to 
give priority to the deployment of modern equipment in the armed 
forces." Accordingly, no further delays are expected for 
programs relating to the Charles de Gaulle aircraft carrier, the 
Rafale fighter aircraft, the Triomphant-type missile-launching 
nuclear submarines (SNLE), and the Helios observation 
satellites. Orders for Leclerc tanks should keep coming in. 
Nevertheless, brand new programs will be postponed, including 
those concerning the NH-90 transport helicopter and the M5 
ballistic nuclear missile, for which a consensus had to be found 
between the prime minister and the president of the Republic. 
The deployment of M5 missiles in SNLE submarines, a pet project 
of the president, will probably be postponed from 2005 to 2010. 
In exchange, the prime minister has reportedly agreed to 
commission the study of a land-based version of the M4/M45 
missiles, which would replace the S3 ground- to-ground missiles 
installed in the Albion platform in 2005.

<F P=106> [Report signed "J.I.": "Armed Forces Staff Creates Aircraft </F>
and Helicopter Squadrons for Special Actions"] 
  [Text] A number of aircraft and helicopter crews are 
currently undergoing training with a view to working for the 
Special Operations Command (COS) placed under the command of the 
Armed Forces chief of staff. The mission of the COS, which is 
similar to that of similar units in the United States and Great 
Britain, will be to carry out raids deep into enemy lines. This 
was announced by COS "chief" General Maurice LePage in a 
communique sent to LES CAHIERS DE MARS, a magazine published by 
"Mars," an association of former higher military students. 
  This is the first time the head of COS has spoken on the 
structure of the new unit, the need for which was felt after 
France proved unable to surreptitiously go into Iraqi territory 
to destroy Scud missile batteries, as was done by special U.S. 
and British commandos. 
  Basically, in addition to its general staff, the COS 
consists 
of several types of special units, including the whole of the 
1st Regiment of Marine Paratroopers based in Bayonne (four 
companies); five marine commando units (including one unit of 
naval frogmen); and one recently created unit, the 10th Air 
Force Paracommando Unit (CPA 10). 
  These various units are qualified for missions such as air 
searches, special actions into enemy lines (in forested or urban 
areas), attacks against vessels at sea, reconnaissance of 
beaches, naval counterterrorism, guiding aircrafts or 
helicopters in hostile areas, attacking airports, or recovering 
personnel lost in enemy territory. 
  General Le Page indicates that, if necessary, COS units can 
be reinforced by commandos from the 11th Division of 
Paratroopers (DP) as well as search and communication teams from 
the 13th Regiment of Dragons Paratroopers (RDP), or specialists 
from the 9th Marine Division (DIMA) and the 27th Alpine Division 
(DA). Worth noting is the fact that the 11th Regiment of Shock 
Paratroopers (RPC) and the "clandestine" civilians belonging to 
the "Action" service of the DGSE [General Directorate for 
External Security] remain under the latter's control and do not 
belong to the COS. 
  A first squadron will use Puma helicopters fitted with 
special equipment for all-weather missions. It could be 
stationed in Evreux (Eure). A second squadron will use Transall 
[transport] aircraft for all-weather, deep penetration purposes. 
It could be assigned to the Poitou Wing, based in Orleans-Bricy 
(Loiret), which is part of the Military Air Transport Command 
(COTAM). Last, a third squadron belonging to the Alpilles Wing 
based in Aix-les-Milles (Bouches-du-Rhone) will use helicopters 
to recover personnel lost far behind enemy lines.

<F P=106> [Report on interview with Central Bank President Jean-Claude </F>
Trichet by Werner Benkhoff and Klaus C. Engelen in Paris on 29 
March: "The Central Bank in Paris `Knows How To Protect Its 
Independence'"] 
  [Text] The Bank of France -- which was released from the 
government's guardianship in terms of monetary policy at the 
beginning of the year -- knows how to protect its independence 
and consistently continue its policy of stability, its governor 
said. With another good result: Jean-Claude Trichet, who has 
headed the central bank since September, expects the French 
inflation rate to drop below 2 percent this year. 
  In the past few years, France managed to reduce the 
traditional difference in inflation to Germany and, as of 1990 
and 1991 even managed to reverse it. The rate of inflation is 
clearly below Germany's. In an interview with HANDELSBLATT, 
Trichet emphasized that the two currencies are being regarded as 
the central pillars of the European Exchange Rate Mechanism 
[ERM]. It was, of course, not easy to get to that stage, he 
said, adding that "to break through the vicious circle of high 
inflation and high interests requires perseverance." 
<H5>  Financial Markets Convinced by Course of Stability </H5>
  Yet, the efforts have been worthwhile for the French: The 
inflationary trend speaks for itself. The financial markets, 
which were originally skeptical whether the French monetary 
authorities would be able to maintain a tough policy of 
stability, have been converted. This optimism explains why not 
only the short-term, but even the long-term interest rates have 
long since been adapted to German rates. 
  Trichet was evasive regarding the question of whether the 
French capacity for interest cuts was not limited by the 
Bundesbank. Germany and France bear joint responsibility for 
the stability of a multilateral exchange rate system. The 
monetary policies of the two countries are complementary. His 
words suggest that the German and French central banks are 
acting on an equal footing. 
  However, many observers have noticed that the old asymmetry 
in the European Monetary System [EMS] continues: The room for 
interest cuts of the central banks that are tied to the German 
anchor is usually determined by the pace of monetary policy set 
by the Bundesbank. The French central bank is no exception 
here. External stabilization is also, for the Banque de France, 
one of the two interim objectives (apart from the money supply) 
on the path toward price stability. 
  If and when the members of the EMS return to narrower 
currency bands and whether such a narrowing is necessary at all 
in the letter and spirit of the Maastricht Treaty should be 
decided "in a pragmatic and practical and not in an abstract and 
theoretical way at the appropriate moment," Trichet said. The 
old, close bands of 4.5 percent were extended to 30 percent 
under the pressure of foreign currency market speculation in 
early August. The Maastricht Treaty only allows a member to 
permitted to participate in monetary union if it can keep its 
exchange rate within the narrow bands for at least two years 
before going over to a single currency. 
  In retrospect, Trichet justifies the August decision to 
abandon the old bands. "We wanted to indicate to the markets at 
that time that the key rates were in harmony with the 
fundamental economic figures and that we were determined not to 
give in to speculation. In particular, we wanted to signal that 
exchange rate risks existed for both sides." The financial 
markets accepted that, he said, which is why the system was 
currently working very well. 
<H5>  No Additional Powers for the EMI </H5>
  He obviously does not think that initiatives to Europeanize 
monetary policy, even in the run-up to monetary union, are 
desirable. "In Europe, we have a mechanism of coordination that 
has proven to be successful. And then there is the Maastricht 
Treaty. We have what we need. I would not recommend any new 
ideas." He added: "People should not forget that France's 
monetary policy is determined by the French central bank in 
Paris by law, in the same way in which German monetary policy is 
determined by the Bundesbank." 
  He would like the European Monetary Institute [EMI], 
designed 
to prepare for the single currency, to be given all powers laid 
down in the Maastricht Treaty on monetary union, but no more, 
either. Here, too, Trichet's view is in full agreement with the 
Bundesbank, which is not willing to cede its powers and 
responsibility on monetary policy prematurely. According to 
Trichet, there are currently no plans to give the president of 
the EMI the power to act as proxy in negotiations with the 
outside world -- such as on exchange rate initiatives with the 
United States or Japan. These powers stay with the national 
monetary authorities. 
  Whether it will be possible to stick to the agreed timetable 
for monetary union wass answered diplomatically by Trichet: "We 
will go through the stages laid down in the Maastricht Treaty 
and see where this will take us." 
  Trichet, his two deputies, and the other six members of the 
French Central Bank Council (Conseil de Politique Monetaire) 
will still have to work hard to convince people and dispel all 
doubts regarding the independence of French monetary policy. A 
few months ago, the German Association for the Protection of 
Savers voiced its skepticism. It is not enough to make the 
central bank autonomous and to make it responsible for monetary 
stability; it must also be able to implement decisions even if 
these are painful. Distrust toward the French Government 
bureaucracy's urge to intervene, which at one point might be 
able to affect the autonomous Banque de France, is created when 
Paris -- as in the current case of massive subsidies for Air 
France and the large Credit Lyonnais bank -- shows that it is 
finding it hard to give up old habits. 
  Critics of the Central Bank Law have mainly pointed to the 
passage that sees monetary policy as being part of economic 
policy in general. The statute does not clearly define at what 
point monetary policy may refuse to support the finance and 
economics ministers. 
  Governor Trichet does not want to accept such objections. 
Even the first article of the Central Bank Law, which also bans 
the government or any other authority from issuing decrees, 
cites price stability as the number-one objective. The law even 
bans the Central Bank Council from accepting instructions from 
politicians. Trichet points to the country's very high "culture 
of stability." How important price stability is for the 
government could be seen in August when the EMS bands were 
extended. Instead of using the room for abrupt interest cuts 
and a devaluation of the franc, as was suspected by many 
observers, and thus creating the impression that price stability 
was no longer a central objective, there was a quick return to 
parity, while interests were cut gradually and continually. 
<H5>  New Communicative Tasks </H5>
  Even within the business community, which used to call for 
devaluation to improve export opportunities, there is now a 
growing understanding that only a monetary policy that is geared 
toward price stability can bring the economy back on the right 
track. "It is also thanks to the French public's very strong 
adherence to monetary stability that we have managed to protect 
the stability of the franc for more than seven years." 
  Trichet is aware that the central bank will also have to 
explain its policy of stability to a skeptical public, which 
will push the Banque de France toward increased public relations 
efforts. The formerly tight-mouthed institute has opened its 
doors. In monthly and annual reports it now explains its 
policy. As happens after Central Bank Council sessions in 
Frankfurt, the media are briefed on monetary policy in Paris, 
too. Under law, the financial committees of the National 
Assembly and the Senate provide an additional forum to explain 
the goal of monetary stability. Central Bank Council members 
repeatedly gave interviews to journalists, including, for the 
second time, also HANDELSBLATT. In talks and conferences we 
"make it clear again and again that price stability is in the 
interests of all."

<F P=106> [Unattributed report: "Christian Democratic Center </F>
Considers Joining Forza Italia"] 
  [Text] Rome -- Smiling and optimistic, their ties bearing 
the symbol of the Sail, they have decided to become "the cement 
of the cement," or the guarantors of the pole of freedoms and 
its true political function. The Christian Democrats of the CCD 
[Christian Democratic Center] elected to parliament, yesterday 
met in a Rome hotel for their first group meeting. Naturally, 
however, talk concentrated on the storm raging inside the pole 
of freedoms. Key concepts set out in instructions issued by 
Pierferdinando Casini, Clemente Mastella, and Ombretta Fumagalli 
Carulli read: "The only candidate to head the government is 
[Forza Italia leader] Silvio Berlusconi." The second point was: 
"We will not allow the League to enforce a presumed relative 
majority within the pole." In other words, the CCD could join 
up with Forza Italia in parliament but its votes are available 
to Silvio Berlusconi, enabling him to do without the seats held 
by the League. The third point requires the immediate drafting 
of laws on two fundamental issues, information and justice (for 
the former, this means the launch of a law affecting not just 
TV, but also newspapers, advertising, and cinema. In the words 
of Fumagalli Carulli: "a law that confirms general and 
fundamental points and which releases the sector from its 
chains." Where justice is concerned, it must be quickly decided 
whether or not it is necessary to alter the rules for the 
election of the CSM [Higher Council of the Magistracy], the 
legislating body for informers, and the obligatory nature of 
penal action. 
  On the future government, all things considered, the CCD is 
confident (otherwise we will have to immediately return to the 
polls). What about the anguish in the PPI [Italian Popular 
Party]? We are ready to welcome into our ranks only those who, 
in good faith, have changed their mind about our political 
plan." What about Formigoni's [PPI] approach? "If they are 
roses, they will flourish."

<F P=106> [Interview with Mario Segni, Pact for Italy leader, by </F>
Antonello Caporale; place and date not given: "Segni: `Now I 
Will Begin Again, Starting With the TV Channels'" -- first three 
paragraphs are LA REPUBBLICA introduction] 
  [Text] Rome -- "I am telling you: to the bitter end." To 
the bitter end? "I am prepared to lay down in front of 
Montecitorio [Chamber of Deputies] in order to get this law 
passed. I am prepared to enter into an alliance with the devil 
in order to succeed." 
  Mario Segni has finished keeping Lent. Today, it is his turn 
to speak, epitomizing the defeated. He has seen his home burnt 
down, the home which he built with his own hands: the new 
electoral law, the prime minister's direct election. This was 
supposed to mark the renewal of democracy. He was supposed to 
be the new leader. Everything went up in smoke. 
  The [Forza Italia leader] Berlusconi bulldozer first knocked 
him down and then crushed him. The enemy troops even conquered 
the Sassari stronghold. Now he has to start again from scratch. 
He has 12 deputies and four senators with him. Little more 
than nothing at all. 
  [Caporale] From where will you start? 
  [Segni] From TV. From a profound and thorough reform of the 
broadcasting system. The Mammi law [on broadcasting] is a 
farce. We need serious rules. Here in Italy we are facing a 
problem which is the number one problem in terms of maintaining 
a democratic system. In no other western country is there such 
a close association between a politician, who is a candidate for 
the premiership, and a monopoly of private information. 
  [Caporale] Is it only now that you have become aware of this 
anomaly? 
  [Segni] We were aware of this risk also during the election 
campaign, but I must admit that we had not realized the 
seriousness, the sheer extent of the problem. We made a 
mistake, and the fact that someone like myself, with so many 
commitments, has no time to watch TV, must also be blamed for 
this. Can you imagine that until yesterday evening I had never 
watched TG4 [fourth channel TV news]? It is really a disgrace. 
It is such a farce that I find it almost incredible. 
  [Caporale] Do you think it was the TV networks that enabled 
Berlusconi to win? 
  [Segni] Of course, it cannot be denied that they had a 
decisive impact. Without the TV cameras, Forza Italia could not 
have become a winning idea. 
  [Caporale] For his part, [Northern League Secretary] Bossi 
is 
looking for you to discuss federalism. 
  [Segni] I know people will find it hard to believe this, but 
nobody has approached me yet. 
  [Caporale] If he does approach you, will you agree to meet 
him? Considering he torpedoed the agreement that you had just 
reached with Maroni [League lower house floor leader]... 
  [Segni] He has not yet approached me. If and when he does, I 
will know what to reply. 
  [Caporale] What? 
  [Segni] Before any other discussion, we must tackle the 
media 
issue, including both the press and broadcasting. First we must 
tackle TV and the newspapers, and then federalism, taxation, and 
what not. The constitutional review, the reshaping of the 
state, if they must take place, must be carried out only after 
democratic rules have been fully restored. 
  [Caporale] What are you proposing? 
  [Segni] I am thinking in terms of a single RAI [state 
broadcasting company] network, and a single Fininvest network, 
and no shared interests with the press. It should no longer be 
possible to get around this by transferring assets to family 
members. It is shameful that the Mammi law allows this. But, 
make no mistake, I would like to stress that this aim of ours 
should not be interpreted as an attempt to get back at 
Berlusconi. In fact, I would be very glad to hear that Forza 
Italia also considers this issue an absolute priority. 
  [Caporale] The rules governing the media have become your 
fixation. Are you perhaps thinking in terms of a referendum? 
  [Segni] I have not yet thought in those terms. Of course, 
moving in that direction is open to us. 
  [Caporale] In the meantime, we are faced by the government 
problem. 
  [Segni] We had warned that the Right, just like the Left, 
was 
a sum of opposing forces, not a homogeneous alignment. 
Berlusconi cheated the voters, there is no doubt about it. It 
was a contrived victory. It was contrived by the TV networks, 
and handed over to Italians in the form of a ready-made ballot 
to be placed in the ballot box. These considerations, however, 
cannot conceal the truth. And the truth is that the Right has 
won. Of course, I can see the winners already jumping at each 
other's throats. In fact, they are using bazookas against each 
other. I am tempted to tell Italians: We had warned you that 
this would happen. But, at this point, the victors must try to 
govern the country. Italy is waiting for a government. 
  [Caporale] What if they do not succeed? Will we go back to 
the polls? 
  [Segni] No, it is madness to dissolve a parliament which 
must 
still be built. If this coalition declares itself bankrupt, 
other avenues must be found. 
  [Caporale] Which? 
  [Segni] It is up to the president of the republic to find 
them. 
  [Caporale] If Berlusconi fails, would you be prepared to 
lead 
a caretaker government? 
  [Segni] No, absolutely not. It is high time for me to say 
what I think, loud and clear. I did not win, I am outside this 
race. I will do my job as a deputy, in the opposition. 
  [Caporale] By the way, some people have invited you, in no 
uncertain terms, to pack up and leave the Chamber of Deputies, 
too. You, the referendum leader, were flunked by the Sassari 
voters in your uninominal constituency. You only made it into 
parliament thanks to the proportional parachute -- meaning the 
system against which you had fought. 
  [Segni] I have given this some thought too. If I am back in 
parliament, it is only because our banner won an unexpected 
success in the proportional ballot. However, you must not 
forget that the little space we had on TV was only used to 
publicize the single joint banner with the Popular Party [PPI], 
the "Pact for Italy." Not a word was ever said of the other 
banner. To this you must add that we were absent in no less 
than 10 constituencies, and that we were not given a cent to 
explain that there was also a "Segni Pact" on the gray ballot. 
Despite such a catastrophe (in fact, I was sure we would not 
reach a quorum), our banner, in the proportional round, almost 
obtained 5 percent of the vote. If we had been present 
throughout the national territory, we could have easily obtained 
8 or 9 percent -- which is the result obtained by the League. 
This is why I am still here. 
  [Caporale] Will your Pact constitute a separate group from 
the PPI group? 
  [Segni] We will be an autonomous group, although we will 
have 
a consultative pact with the other group. 
  [Caporale] Why is this? Have problems arisen also in the 
center? 
  [Segni] No, we had decided to move in this direction before 
going together into the election campaign. 
  [Caporale] Are you concerned that some of your deputies may 
"betray" you to side with the victors? 
  [Segni] This is not the case, and will not be the case. 
  [Caporale] It is being said that the Pact's tax expert 
Giulio 
Tremonti would also find a place in a Berlusconi government. 
  [Segni] I do not believe so, not in the least. 
  [Caporale] Deputy Segni, if you could go back, would you 
follow the same road all the way? 
  [Segni] This is a difficult question, a whole new interview 
would be necessary to answer it. We all make mistakes. 
  [Caporale] Are you thinking of the mistake made with Achille 
Occhetto [secretary of the Democratic Party of the Left, PDS]? 
  [Segni] No, despite everything, I believe I was right to say 
clearly what I thought, and to part company. The PDS has always 
believed it was the motor, the pivot, the hub. Let us not 
forget what happened barely a month after the referendum. 
Already in July, the PDS had reached an agreement with [Rete 
leader] Orlando and Rete, and was preparing to reach one with 
Communist Renewal. You can imagine what would have happened in 
December, after the victory in the local elections. The PDS 
felt that it was the boss, this is the truth. 
  [Caporale] Does the same apply to Democratic Alliance [AD]? 
  [Segni] The fact that AD has had none of its people elected 
under their own banner is an indication of its political 
marginality compared to Botteghe Oscure [PDS headquarters]. My 
challenge, our challenge, was something different: countering 
the Left by means of a genuine liberal-democratic option. 
  [Caporale] You did not succeed. 
  [Segni] But we have all the time in the world to try again.

<F P=106> [Interview with Rocco Buttiglione, Italian Popular Party </F>
Deputy, by Antonello Caporale in Rome; date not given: 
"Buttiglione: `We Told You So'"] 
  [Text] Rome -- [Caporale] Deputy Buttiglione, what are you 
doing, are you rubbing your hands together already? 
  [Buttiglione] Throughout the electoral campaign we told him 
that what he had was not an alliance, and that after the 
elections the game of summit meetings and intrigue would begin 
again. We were right. [Buttiglione ends] 
  At 7 PM the leaders of the Popular Party [PPI] run to the 
[party headquarters in] Piazza del Gesu. The breakdown in 
negotiations in the pole for freedom means that they will have 
to prepare to face the unexpected. It had been decided that the 
center would remain in the opposition, but what now? [Forza 
Italia leader] Silvio Berlusconi has told [League Secretary] 
Bossi to go to hell and says that if he is asked to do so, he 
will consult no one, but will make "his own" government and then 
go straight to parliament in search of votes. 
  Rocco Buttiglione is speaking in his capacity of implicit 
PPI 
secretary. 
  [Caporale] It is said that Berlusconi is getting ready to go 
big-game hunting in your party. 
  [Buttiglione] Everyone who wanted to leave has left. 
  [Caporale] What will you do if tomorrow he asks you to vote 
in his government? 
  [Buttiglione] We will decide when we have read his program. 
  [Caporale] Could the program meet your expectations? 
  [Buttiglione] I do not think that the things Berlusconi 
wants 
to do are agreeable to us. 
  [Caporale] Could we theorize on your possible abstention? 
  [Buttiglione] Our abstention alone would not be enough. 
Berlusconi's problem is not confined to the Bossi issue. The 
other ally, [National Alliance leader] Fini, for example says 
that Mussolini was the greatest statesman of the century. It is 
not an historical judgment, because from that point of view it 
could even be justified, but it is a political judgment. And it 
is a serious political judgment. The leader of Forza Italia 
must deal with this major and weighty contradiction. 
  [Caporale] How can he get out of it? 
  [Buttiglione] I have an idea. 
  [Caporale] Tell us what it is. 
  [Buttiglione] No, first I must speak to him about it. 
  [Caporale] Nonetheless, you could cover a lot of ground with 
Berlusconi. His program resembles yours on many points. 
  [Buttiglione] And it differs in others. 
  [Caporale] For example? 
  [Buttiglione] I am thinking about solidarity. We put it at 
the center of the government's action, but he marginalizes it. 
  [Caporale] Still, there are no great gulfs separating you, 
and Berlusconi could soften his liberalist approach. 
  [Buttiglione] Well, I would be the first to congratulate him 
if he did. 
  [Caporale] What is your plan? 
  [Buttiglione] To form a major center force. 
  [Caporale] Is it something that you will be looking to 
complete in the current legislature? 
  [Buttiglione] I believe that it would be a good cure for my 
party to start with an albeit brief period in opposition. It 
would give our new force a fresh identity and body. Having said 
this, I maintain that the majority voting system is legitimate 
for government but not for changing the rules. The Constitution 
is the business of parliament, and is therefore everyone's 
business, not just the government's. 
  [Caporale] So if, tomorrow, Bossi knocked at your door and 
asked to talk about constitutional reform, would you also open 
the door to him? 
  [Buttiglione] I talk with everyone. I do not know what 
things we have in common, but that is another subject. 
Nonetheless, I understand the League's reasons. For them, this 
is the magic time. They have the force in parliament to really 
lay down their terms and conditions. Thanks to the electoral 
law, they are overrepresented. The majority system of voting 
above all favors the regional forces. With 8 percent of the 
votes, thanks to an agreement that no longer exists, they have 
120 deputies in parliament, while we won 16 percent and have 
just 46 deputies. In Britain, the regional parties barely have 
any seats and discussions are under way about how to change the 
law. Now, however, it is clear that Bossi has to lay all his 
cards on the table once and for all. If he does not obtain the 
institutional reforms for which he fought, in such a way that 
they give him a new national legitimacy, he is destined to be 
reabsorbed into Forza Italia. If there is no room for 
federalism, then he would be better served by a weak government 
than one which can pass resolutions. 
  [Caporale] Were you expecting this turmoil? 
  [Buttiglione] To be honest, I thought that for at least a 
short time they would have tried to govern. I predicted 18 
months of calm. Then chaos. 
  [Caporale] Have they failed? 
  [Buttiglione] Well, I still think that the president of the 
republic will have to give the task to the leader of the winning 
alliance. 
  [Caporale] And what if Berlusconi sinks without a trace? 
Masssimo D'Alema [Democratic Party of the Left Deputy Secretary] 
says there is another possible majority. 
  [Buttiglione] We can talk of anything.

  [Text] Defense Minister Fabio Fabbri stressed that "the 
functions of the Italian observers in Hebron will essentially be 
political, and to provide security for the local population." 
  "The fact that all the sides asked for our soldiers to take 
part in the operation along side troops from Denmark and 
Norway," Fabbri added, "shows how much prestige Italy has 
acquired during these peacekeeping operations." 
  Referring to Somalia, the minister said, "It was the most 
demanding operation that our troops have taken part in since the 
Second World War, because of the loss of life that we endured."

  [Text] Vatican City, April 7 (AFP) -- The Vatican called 
on the United Nations Thursday [7 April] to ease its sanctions 
against the rump Yugoslavia enough to spare the civilian 
population from increasing hardship. 
  The world body should consider "correctives to the effects 
of 
the sanctions," Secretary of State Cardinal Angelo Sodano said 
in an interview with Vatican Radio. 
  The cardinal urged the setting up of a "system permitting 
independent and effective control of the humanitarian 
consequences of sanctions." 
  He said the Serbian Orthodox patriarchate had sought the aid 
of Pope John Paul II in "drawing the attention of the 
international community to the serious consequences of the 
sanctions." 
  The UN Security Council imposed economic sanctions against 
Serbia and its ally Montenegro in May 1992 for Belgrade's 
support for Serb separatist forces in Bosnia-Herzegovina. 
  The legitimacy of decisions by the international community 
"never obviates the need for attention to the actual fate of 
civilian populations," he said. 
  Sanctions "must never be a means of war or of punishment of 
a 
people." They must "remain a temporary means of pressure on 
governments whose actions endanger international peace...(and) 
always be accompanied by dialogue between those involved, not 
just in Serbia but elsewhere, in Iraq or Haiti." 
  The Vatican has made regular contacts with Security Council 
members to examine the possibility of easing the negative 
effects of sanctions with regard to humanitarian welfare.

  [Text] There was turmoil again today on the currency 
markets. The escudo was under pressure from speculators when 
Portuguese banks sold so much currency that they ended up 
without escudos. The Bank of Portugal was forced to intervene 
with over 1 billion escudos to be able to control the situation. 
It was a nerve-racking day on the markets. More details from 
Paulo Fidalgo: 
  [Fidalgo] The financial markets were surprised today when 
banks started running out of escudos and short-term interest 
rates rocketed to figures 10 times above the average of about 
one week ago. For you to have an idea about the chaos reigning 
in the markets, it is enough for me to tell you that rates for 
24-hour interbank loans reached 100 percent as opposed to 10-12 
percent rates charged one week ago. Following intervention by 
the Bank of Portugal, the situation was more under control, and 
the overnight rate settled at 40 percent. But to stabilize the 
situation, the Central Bank had to make available to banks over 
1 billion escudos, twice the amount used yesterday. Speculators 
started selling escudos about one week ago and forced the 
devaluation of the Portuguese currency against almost every 
single currency within the European Monetary System [EMS]. 
National banks that played an intermediate role in the 
operations have now run out of escudos and will have to buy them 
before Monday [11 April], the date when the Central Bank will 
verify whether the compulsory reserves are within the 
established boundaries. Miguel Beleza, governor of Bank of 
Portugal, is imposing the present interest rates as a means of 
punishing speculators and thus charging a very high price for 
the availability of the currency. This is a way of controlling 
the game of purchase and sale of the escudo and maintaining its 
value on the international market. 
  From this speculative movement against the escudo, the banks 
are trying to draw the conclusion that interest rates have 
already reached their lowest limit -- around 9 percent -- and 
that they cannot drop any further unless the government gives up 
the present value of the escudo within the EMS. Therefore, the 
market is now waiting for clearer signs: A strong escudo or low 
interest rates. But it looks difficult to have these two 
together.

  [Text] Vladimir Zhirinovskiy, the chairman of the Russian 
Liberal Democratic Party, who has constantly tried to draw 
attention to himself while in Finland, left Finland at 1200. 
Before he left, he had time to give a lecture on his policies 
lasting nearly two hours to foreign correspondents working in 
Helsinki. Zhirinovskiy's main message this time was that the 
West should keep its hands off Russia. He considers himself to 
be the savior of Russia. Sinikka Siekkinen has been following 
Zhirinovskiy's visit to Finland. 
  [Siekkinen] During his visit, Zhirinovskiy has been busy in 
different parts of Helsinki and given controversial statements, 
sometimes at a striptease night club and sometimes at the grave 
of Mannerheim. Immediately after his arrival, Zhirinovskiy 
threatened Estonia with occupation and Finland with nuclear war, 
but official Finland kept quiet on Zhirinovskiy's statements. 
This is how Foreign Minister Heikki Haavisto answered my 
question today. 
  [Begin recording] [Siekkinen] Is Finland cringing before 
Zhirinovskiy when Finland has not officially reacted to his 
statements? 
  [Haavisto] In my view he has been here as the guest of the 
Eduskunta, and in my view the Eduskunta should take 
responsibility for his visit here and his possible statements. 
[end recording] 
  [Siekkinen] Zhirinovskiy, who is experienced as a 
troublemaker, has been banned from several countries, but 
wherever he is, he raises curiosity. At the news conference 
this morning, many had come to listen to Zhirinovskiy in order 
to try to understand his line of thought. Zhirinovskiy rewarded 
his listeners by giving a fairly comprehensive but confusing and 
controversial review on the aims of his policies. The starting 
point of his policies is that Russia has been betrayed three 
times this century: First during the Russian Empire, then during 
communism, and now during the so-called democracy, however, this 
time without weapons. Zhirinovskiy will not tolerate a fourth 
time. 
  [Begin Zhirinovskiy recording in Russian fading to English 
translation] Either the West leaves us alone and we take care of 
our own problem and solve our own problems. [end recording] 
  [Siekkinen] He urged the West to keep its hands off Russia, 
because according to Zhirinovskiy, Russia can solve its problems 
itself and if the West does not realize this, the disintegration 
of Russia will continue and there will be a third world war. 
Zhirinovskiy regards himself as the savior of Russia with a 
historic mission. The greatest threat to Russia comes from the 
south, where there are 400 million Muslims. Zhirinovskiy 
regards them as barbarians who also threaten Western Europe 
unless he and Russia stop the south, with nuclear arms, if need 
be. 
  [Begin Zhirinovskiy recording in Russian, fading to English 
translation] I am against using, I am an opponent to the use of 
any kind of weapons, whether it be nuclear or conventional but 
[words indistinct] the interest of Russia. [end recording] 
  [Siekkinen] Zhirinovskiy says that he is against the use of 
any kind of weapons, but if Russia is threatened, it has the 
right to use all kinds of weapons it has, including nuclear 
weapons. After these statements Zhirinovskiy left for home to 
solve the problems of his own parliamentary group. Yesterday, 
two members of his parliamentary group resigned, tired of 
Zhirinovskiy's policies.

<F P=106> [Report on interview with Social Democratic Party secretary </F>
Mona Sahlin by Hans O. Alfredsson; place and date not given] 
  [Text] The Liberal Party, like the Center Party, is 
welcome to work together with the Social Democrats if there is a 
change of government in the fall -- and perhaps even form part 
of that same government. Party secretary Mona Sahlin is happy 
to repeat this invitation six months before the election, 
despite the fact that it is not that popular in all circles of 
the Social Democratic movement. 
  All those at the Confederation of Trade Unions [LO] and in 
Sweden's workplaces who are impatient and are waiting for an 
announcement about the levels of compensation that will be paid 
out by the unemployment benefit fund will have to go on waiting. 
Mona Sahlin refuses to tie herself to a date. The unemployment 
benefit will be raised to 90 percent again "at some point in the 
future," when the economy has improved. That is all the Social 
Democrats will promise before the election. 
  More or less the same phrase has been used about parents' 
insurance. The message a few years ago was that the Social 
Democrats would honor their abandoned promise to extend parents' 
insurance as soon as the economy improves. It would be the 
first thing they would do. 
  What is top of the list now -- the unemployment benefit or 
parents' insurance? Mona Sahlin shied away from the question a 
little. If I had 5 billion, she said, it would be spent on jobs 
and training places. As far as benefit levels are concerned, 
the long-term sick are first in line. They are being promised 
more than the 70 percent from the sickness insurance fund they 
get today -- when the economy improves. 
  "But obviously increased benefits from the unemployment fund 
take precedence over longer vacations and an extension of 
parents' insurance. Yes, these latter two are quite a way down 
the list now. Unemployment and the poor state of the economy -- 
things that are interconnected -- push them down the list." 
  Mona Sahlin was not particularly surprised by the diagram 
from SVENSKA DAGBLADET/Institute for Market Research that shows 
that 20 percent of Social Democratic sympathizers could envisage 
voting for the Moderate Coalition Party. But she believes that 
"the threshold for them actually voting like that is very high." 
She has no doubts that views on some issues can coincide. 
  "If you want me to be extremely surprised -- well, I am not. 
It is probably possible to find workers in the metal industry, 
for example -- now people in the Metalworkers' Union will 
probably be angry -- who sympathize with the idea of low 
taxation, who feel that people should look after themselves, 
that there should not be a whole mass of benefit payments and 
the like. You often run into this sort of view in workplaces." 
  She believes that the diagram also reflects that fact that 
voters are moving across party boundaries more nowadays and make 
up their minds at a late stage in election campaigns. 
  "For a very long time we had a very good life as a result of 
the fact that many people voted Social Democrat out of 
tradition, because that's the way things were supposed to be. 
In recent years voters have become more and more unfaithful. 
What class you come from means less and less." 
  Mona Sahlin is happy to admit that things certainly do look 
good in the opinion polls, but she warns against banking on a 
victory in advance. She is in the habit of reminding her party 
colleagues that there are more than 170 days left before the 
election. She is careful not to appear too optimistic. 
  "It is more my job to see to it that everybody works their 
butts off between now and the election." 
  "To the annoyance of many people," as she put it, more than 
a 
year ago she and Ingvar Carlsson said publicly that broad 
agreements and close cooperation with other parties will be 
needed to solve the challenges facing Sweden. 
  Even with their own Riksdag majority the Social Democrats 
could contemplate a government coalition with the Liberal Party, 
for example. Mona Sahlin adheres to this view. 
  "Yes, that still applies. The problems that will have to be 
solved by the government that is in power after the election 
will not be dealt with in the life of a single Riksdag. The 
market, companies, citizens have to be able to be confident that 
the decisions that are taken will apply for a long time. This 
applies, for example, to social insurance, the pension system, 
the financing of homes, European policy." 
  In Mona Sahlin's view, if it proves impossible to create 
this 
sort of trust and confidence in the political decisionmaking 
process, it will also be impossible to successfully tackle the 
issue of jobs and social welfare. 
  The open flirting with the Liberal Party has been 
conspicuous 
by its absence for a while, but this does not mean that the 
suitor has lost interest. 
  "No, we have said what we think and we stand firm on that. 
But there has indeed been a lot of discussion of this at party 
meetings. `Why are you flirting and why are you talking; will 
Wibble really have a seat in our government?' people ask. At 
every meeting I am asked the question: Why do you go on about 
cooperation with other parties when we have 50 percent in the 
opinion polls and are going to win the election? That is when I 
generally ask a counterquestion: How many people here think 
that we will win 50 percent of the vote in all the elections 
over the next 30 years? No one raises a hand." 
  She described a coalition with the Left Party as completely 
out of the question. Nor does she believe in any form of closer 
cooperation in the Riksdag -- if, that is, the Left Party 
manages to hang on in the Riksdag ("there is probably a major 
risk that they will end up outside it"). 
  "They have a lot left to prove if they are to be a partner 
to 
really rely on. They are not showing this today." 
  No one needs to have any doubts about "what the Social 
Democrats want" in the election campaign: 
  "We want a majority of our own -- this is really our first 
objective. The most important thing is to win the election; the 
second most important thing is to remove the right wing from 
influence over Swedish politics for decades to come. For me the 
right wing is the Moderates, New Democracy, and the Christian 
Democratic Party. Our main opponents are of course the 
Moderates." 
  Mona Sahlin believes that it will be a "real right-left 
election, an ideological election. 
  ``It will be a test of the strength of solidarity. It will 
be those who have jobs and incomes and are well showing their 
solidarity by making sacrifices for those who are not as well 
off. It is a question of realizing how much this will require.'' 
  For the Social Democrats an important goal is to win over 
the 
whole of the movement to this realization. Mona Sahlin claimed, 
as is customary, that relations with the LO are good. The 
unemployment benefit fund is the only dissonance. The situation 
regarding a joint election campaign leadership this year is 
unclear. The LO and the party has traditionally always had such 
a joint campaign leadership. 
  "My point of departure is that everything is not hunky-dory 
simply because that is the way you have done things in the 
past," she replied when asked if it is desirable that the LO 
chairman should be part of the election campaign leadership. 
  She worked well with Stig Malm, she said, even though he 
described things differently in a recent radio program. 
  "Yes, it is clear that he did not think so. He can think 
exactly what he likes about me as a person. I will not descend 
to the level of any talk about what he is like. However, I am 
happy to repeat that I think that he was an excellent LO 
chairman who forced the pace on many important issues. It is 
very sad that he is so bitter now." 
  Alongside the normal political issues the party will devote 
itself to the EU [European Union] over the next few months. The 
Social Democrats will reach their decision on membership at an 
extraordinary congress immediately before midsummer. 
  Why is this so important? There is after all going to be a 
referendum, and the Social Democrats have committed themselves 
to falling in with the result. 
  "I think that it is important that citizens receive some 
guidance about what the parties think and how they have argued 
their way forward to a decision. It is not simply a question of 
a yes or a no; it is also a question of how the parties think we 
should work in Europe, what we should do with a possible future 
yes." 
  One or two people have expressed concern that the party's 
approach to the issue could split the party, that a factional 
conflict could arise that could leave deep scars for a long time 
to come. Mona Sahlin does not share this concern. 
  "What is new and different for us is that even after the 
congress no one is going to hit someone else across the head 
simply for continuing to promote the line he believes in. This 
is a pretty new way for our party to work. We have often had a 
tendency to carry on all debates internally and then when we 
have voted and found a party line, we open the door and say not 
a word about where we have disagreed. On this issue we have 
chosen to do the reverse." 
  Mona Sahlin assured me that the Social Democrats will view 
the referendum as binding -- that is, in the Riksdag they will 
vote for the line that wins most votes regardless of the number 
who abstain. This is how Ingvar Carlsson's talk of "50.5 
percent" is to be interpreted. There is no suggestion of a 
demand for an absolute majority for yes or no.

  [Text] President Glavkos Kliridhis' meeting with Robert 
Lamb, the U.S. State Department special coordinator on Cyprus, 
concluded a short time ago. Lamb described the meeting as 
constructive. Replying to a relevant question, he said we should 
not get involved with what he called artificial timeframes. We 
should proceed, he noted, toward the implementation of the 
confidence-building measures. Lamb also said he would leave 
Cyprus tomorrow. 
  Government spokesman Ioannis Kasoulidhis said Lamb sought to 
bring changes to the UN document so that the talks can continue. 
Even if there are changes, Kasoulidhis said, [Turkish Cypriot 
leader] Rauf Denktas will ask for more, since he does not have 
the will for a Cyprus solution. The government spokesman said 
that during the meeting, President Kliridhis repeated that the 
Greek Cypriot side showed the highest possible degree of 
constructive willingness to accept the UN document. The Greek 
Cypriot side, he added, will accept no amendments to the 
document and no new document from the United Nations. 
Kasoulidhis said that our side did not ask for timeframes but 
stressed that since they exist they should be followed. The 
spokesman also said that anyone who tries to change the UN 
document will find himself in front of Denktas' policy of 
differing. Kasoulidhis then said that with the changes to the 
document, Lamb appears to hope that an agreement will be 
reached. This is a view, he said, with which the Greek Cypriot 
side disagrees.

  [Text] Robert Lamb, U.S. State Department coordinator for 
the Cyprus issue, left Cyprus for Washington this morning 
without succeeding in ending the deadlock in the talks on the 
confidence-building measures. 
  Mr. Lamb yesterday had separate meetings with President 
Glavkos Kliridhis and Rauf Denktas. According to a statement by 
government spokesman Ioannis Kasoulidhis, Mr. Lamb attempted to 
persuade the Greek Cypriot side that if certain changes were 
made to the documents, an agreement could be reached. President 
Kliridhis reiterated that our side would accept neither changes 
to the nonpaper nor a new document.

  [Text] Joe Clark, the UN secretary general's special 
representative in Cyprus, tonight said that he and the UN 
secretary general are now facing a challenge to try to get the 
issues that are before the leaders of the two communities 
accepted. He added that both he and the UN secretary general 
believe this is possible. 
  In a statement in New York, Clark said he will meet the 
Security Council members tomorrow to brief them on his recent 
talks in Cyprus. He noted that this is natural given the top 
priority the Security Council attaches to the efforts for a 
solution. He said: As you know, the UN secretary general issued 
a report noting that the progress that was expected has not been 
achieved. But he added that he hopes we will use the next four 
weeks to reach an agreement on the basis of the proposals before 
the two leaders. 
  Asked if he believes there will be progress in the next four 
weeks, Clark said he hopes that progress will be reached on the 
basis of the positions that are now before the two leaders, 
which offer real benefits to the sides. 
  Commenting on President Glavkos Kliridhis' position that he 
will discuss no new proposals, Clark said: Kliridhis' position 
was clear. He raised two positions in his statement: First, 
despite his reservations, he reconfirmed his support for the 
proposals being promoted. Second, he stressed that he will 
accept no changes to the proposals.

  [Text] Government Spokesman Evangelos Venizelos today made 
it clear that Greece will proceed with removing the measures 
against Skopje [The Former Yugoslav Republic of 
Macedonia--FYROM] only when the government of Kiro Gligorov 
gives three practical signs of goodwill, that is, on the 
symbols, border, and Constitution. The spokesman stressed that 
the Greek Government's positions on the issue of Skopje, which 
are known and firm, will be presented to UN mediator Cyrus Vance 
on 11 April in Washington by Ambassador Khristos Zakharakis, 
director general of the Foreign Ministry. 
  Venizelos said that the EU's [European Union] decision to 
refer Greece to the European Court of Justice undermines Vance's 
initiative and encourages Gligorov's intransigence, something 
that does not contribute to stability and security in the 
region. The government spokesman repeated that the EU 
Commission's decision violates the Union's solidarity and shows 
its contradictory character, because it cannot recognize the 
political character of Greece's countermeasures and pursue a 
diplomatic initiative with Dutch Commissioner Hans van den Broek 
on the one hand, and decide to follow the judicial route on the 
other. The positive aspect that the Greek Government has 
recognized in yesterday's decision, Venizelos concluded, is that 
the European Union calls on Skopje to change its flag and amend 
its constitution.

  [Excerpt] Referring to the latest developments in the issue 
of Skopje [The Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia--FYROM], 
government spokesman Evangelos Venizelos said the Greek 
Government has shown signs of being flexible and conciliatory 
but cannot deviate from its basic stated positions. He added 
that the Greek measures will be lifted if and when the Skopjean 
Government gives tangible proof of the goodwill signs to which 
repeated references have been made. 
  The spokesman described the European Commission's decision 
yesterday [to refer Greece to the European Court of Justice] as 
inappropriate and contradictory and said he hopes the Commission 
will finally change its view. He said: If this does not 
happen, we will have the chance to present our strong judicial 
arguments in court. 
  The spokesman noted that the European Commission should have 
considered the UN secretary general's recent report to the 
Security Council, which notes that the continuing dispute 
between Greece and Skopje causes international tension and 
endangers peace in the region. Venizelos said U.S. Special 
Presidential Envoy Ambassador Matthew Nimetz's initiative 
remains open and that Greek Ambassador in Washington Khristos 
Zakharakis will meet UN mediator Cyrus Vance. The spokesman 
stressed that yesterday's decision violates the rule of communal 
solidarity. 
  Commenting on yesterday's developments in the Skopje issue, 
Foreign Minister Karolos Papoulias and New Democracy Chairman 
Miltiadhis Evert stressed that the national front must remain 
united. Papoulias and Evert met at noon today at Evert's 
request. 
  Afterward Papoulias appeared pessimistic about developments 
in the national issue but stressed that during Zakharakis' 
meeting with Vance in New York on 11 April, the Greek side would 
mainly be concerned with breaking the deadlock. He added that 
the Greek people stand firm in the battle that Greece is waging 
following recent developments. 
  Asked about Political Spring Chairman Andonios Samaras' 
request that the government take additional measures against 
Skopje, Papoulias indirectly rejected Samaras' proposals, saying 
the government is now preparing for the new phase that has been 
created. 
  Asked about the differences between the new Vance plan and 
what was agreed in the United Nations during the New Democracy's 
term, Papoulias said the difference lies in the separation of 
the name issue from the confidence-building measures, adding 
that the international mediator's views coincide with the Greek 
views. [passage omitted]

<F P=106> [From the "Views" column: "Blackmail"] </F>
  [Text] The EU [European Union] Commission's decision to 
refer Greece's embargo against Skopje [The Former Yugoslav 
Republic of Macedonia--FYROM] to the European Court of Justice 
is open and unconcealed blackmail. 
  And not only is it profound blackmail, given the history of 
the European Union, it is also another demonstrative example of 
our European partners' one-sided and offensive attitude toward 
our country. 
  With this decision, the EU Commission automatically becomes 
an untrustworthy mediator of the problem between Greece and 
Skopje. 
  The EU Commission's decision is blackmail and a 
transgression 
against Greek feelings and every principle of international and 
EU law, because it does not recognize Greece's right to react 
with countermeasures to Skopje's intransigence, while Skopje 
continues falsifying history, using Greek historic symbols, and 
spreading offensive propaganda. 
  The EU Commission's decision is blackmail and a provocation 
because on the one hand it refers Greece to the European Court 
of Justine with a seven-day deadline for lifting the embargo, 
and on the other hand it politely calls on Skopje to "reexamine 
its position on the issues regarding its constitution and flag 
within the framework of finding solutions to all issues, 
including the state's name." 
  The EU Commission's decision is blackmail and a provocation 
for Greece because it encourages [FYROM President Kiro] Gligorov 
to continue his intransigent stance and not make any concessions. 
  Greece has no reason to be afraid, and it will fight at the 
European Court for inalienable rights and its own rights. And 
it is a battle that Greece will win. 
  However, beyond the legal and political issue, there is also 
a huge issue of EU solidarity, which in practice has been proven 
not to exist because it is superseded by various interests and 
ambitions.

<F P=106> [Editorial: "The Decision To Refer Greece to the European </F>
Court of Justice"] 
  [Text] The EU [European Union] Commission's decision 
yesterday to refer Greece to the European Court of Justice due 
to the "embargo" against Skopje, is particularly unfortunate for 
our country. First, the decision could be considered extreme, 
given that it is the first time the EU Commission has taken such 
a measure against one of its members, which also happens to hold 
the EU presidency. 
  The EU Commission ignored the political aspect of the 
Greek-Skopje [The Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia--FYROM] 
dispute, taking into consideration only the legal and trade 
aspects of the "embargo"--which we should note has also 
questioned in our country. This development came as an 
unpleasant surprise, but it also raises other questions, because 
both the Security Council and Matthew Nimetz, U.S. President 
Bill Clinton's special envoy for the Balkans, have recently 
stressed the political dimension of the Skopje issue. In fact, 
they stressed that a prolongation of the uncertainty would 
threaten the stability of the whole region. 
  Therefore, we ask: What are criteria of the EU Commission, 
which is the executive body, for completely ignoring the above 
aspect and making yesterday's decision without any prior 
decision by the EU Council of Ministers, which has the basic 
authority on issues related with the EU solidarity? 
  Aside from all this, the EU Commission's decision to refer 
Greece to the European Court of Justice constitutes strong, 
almost one-sided pressure against our country, especially in 
view of the talks in New York scheduled for 11 April on the 
Skopje issue and also coming on the eve of the Greek prime 
minister's visit to the United States. 
  All the above points and questions should be examined very 
seriously by the Greek Government. Because first of all, they 
indicate significant differences between our foreign policy in 
the Balkans and EU ambitions and goals in the region, to the 
extent that the EU's policies show any homogeneity or 
consistency at all. Secondly, yesterday's decision highlights 
the worrisome drop in our country's influence in the EU's 
central bodies. This certainly is not due solely to the 
discontent arising from the Greek countermeasures against 
Skopje.... 
  In other words, yesterday's reaction by the Government and 
opposition to the "unfair" decision of our "partners," who were 
under emotional pressure, is worthless and useless. What is 
important is to correctly evaluate the developments that gave 
rise to this decision and react calmly, based on our national 
interests.

    [Editorial Report] The debate on the "Macedonian," The 
Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia--FYROM, issue and the 
various parties' stance on it have elicited commentary in the 
Greek press. 
  Writing in the 27 March Athens weekly TO VIMA TIS KIRIAKIS, 
Nikos Marakis notes that the long-lasting "Macedonian" issue 
highlighted the rule that foreign policy is not only the product 
of diplomatic initiatives, but is influenced by internal policy, 
partisan interests or even personal strategies. In fact, the 
decisions of Minister of Foreign Affairs Karolos Papoulias and 
his diplomatic advisers bear little authority because foreign 
policy is completely controlled by Prime Minister Andreas 
Papandreou, whose priorities do not always coincide with those 
of his ministers, Marakis comments. Papandreou's decisions are 
dictated by a series of parameters, one of which is his expected 
move to the presidency in 1995, at which time the votes that 
Political Spring leader Andonis Samaras, a fierce opponent of a 
Skopje compromise, may contribute can be "precious." According 
to Marakis, this limits Papoulias and alternate Minister of 
Foreign Affairs Theodhoros Pangalos' jurisdiction to matters 
that have no influence on public opinion and are unrelated to 
internal political processes. However, Papoulias is more likely 
to carry out Papandreou's directives because he is "the more 
obedient of the two," comments Marakis. The other alternate 
minister, Yiorgos Papandreou, has thus far assumed a low profile 
in playing the role of the prime minister's "special envoy" for 
Greek-American relations. The ministry's "triangle" has 
therefore failed to function as a group, with confrontation 
focusing on each individual's ability to influence the prime 
minister. 
  Turning to the New Democracy (ND), Marakis reports that when 
the issue of sending Greek peacekeeping troops to Bosnia was 
discussed at a meeting chaired by ND leader Miltiadhis Evert, 
former ND Minister of Education Yiorgos Souflias and former ND 
President of the Chamber of Deputies Athanasios Tsaldharis 
"vehemently" argued that the party ought to oppose the move and 
that governmental initiatives ought to be denounced. Evert and 
former Minister of Defense Ioannis Varvitsiotis agreed with 
them, albeit expressing reservations about a direct denunciation 
of the government. Souflias and Tsaldharis admit that they are 
influenced by the rivalry with Samaras, who could outflank the 
ND on Skopje and steal ND votes in the June European Parliament 
elections. In addition, many party members believe that Evert's 
low-key opposition to PASOK fails to stress Papandreou's policy 
errors, Marakis comments. 
  With regard to Political Spring, Marakis goes on to note 
that 
to date, Samaras has only derived political benefits from his 
stance on the "Macedonian" issue. Samaras, he says, believes he 
is the "main factor in Greece's rejection of a compromise," and 
does not refute the view that he is "holding captive" the entire 
political leadership. Meanwhile, Samaras has let it be 
understood that he would vote for Papandreou in an eventual 
presidential race if the prime minister were to follow an 
uncompromising policy on the name of "Macedonia." While thus 
offering a "bait" to Papandreou, Samaras is in fact becoming 
enmeshed in the question of whether the country would be led to 
new elections were the government to accept a compromise on 
"Macedonia," Marakis concludes.

    [Editorial Report] While the opposition New Democracy (ND) 
party has received its share of attention in the Greek press, 
most newspapers focused on developments within the Panhellenic 
Socialist Movement (PASOK), in light of its upcoming congress 
and the rumors about the succession to the PASOK leader, Prime 
Minister Andreas Papandreou. 
  It is generally accepted that the April PASOK congress will 
be the last with Papandreou as leader and that the prime 
minister intends to run for the presidency in 1995, writes 
Stavros Liyeros in the 27 March Athens daily I KATHIMERINI. The 
congress is therefore viewed as a "way station" during which 
potential successors will affirm themselves and alliances will 
be sealed in view of the "final battle." The absence of ailing 
Minister of National Economy Yiorgos Yennimatas has resulted in 
a "huge vacuum" and a lot of concern, for the election of 
PASOK's most popular official to the party leadership had been 
considered certain and had allayed fears of a succession 
struggle, Liyeros comments. The race for the succession, which 
is taking place in a "moving sands" environment, now includes 
the quartet of Minister of Interior Akis Tsokhatzopoulos, 
Minister of Defense Yerasimos Arsenis, Minister of Industry 
Kostas Simitis, and alternate Minister of Foreign Affairs 
Theodhoros Pangalos. While until recently Tsokhatzopoulos had 
been considered only Papandreou's "executive organ" and a 
significant factor in intraparty affairs, the picture has 
"totally changed" and the "Tsokhatzopoulos group" may presently 
be the most important intraparty apparatus. According to 
Liyeros, the interior minister is going to the congress with two 
main goals: 
  -- Modify the existing--but not enforced--provision 
prohibiting the party's secretary general from simultaneously 
being a member of the government. 
  -- Elect as many of his own supporters as possible to the 
new 
central committee to secure his reelection to the position of 
secretary general. Liyeros comments that this goal should not be 
difficult, for it coincides with Papandreou's. He also cites 
unidentified Tsokhatzopoulos aides as arguing that the prime 
minister has already selected the interior minister as his 
successor because "he would only entrust the government and the 
party to him." 
  On the other hand, Arsenis will participate in the congress 
from a "position of strength," following a gradual and 
successful strategy of broadening his influence in the party and 
the parliamentary group, continues Liyeros. In recent years, 
Arsenis has become a "pole of attraction" for all dissatisfied 
PASOK members. He presently enjoys a broad network of 
supporters, among them, reportedly, Minister of Environment 
Kostas Laliotis, whose help has "symbolic" value, for it erases 
Arsenis' image of a "black sheep" and his past attempt to found 
his own party. 
  According to Liyeros, Simitis has been attempting a 
"dynamic" 
comeback on the political scene in an effort to occupy the 
vacuum left by Yennimatas. Liyeros cites "reliable" sources as 
reporting that Simitis has concluded an alliance with PASOK 
luminary Vaso Papandreou and is hoping to secure the assistance 
of some members of the Yennimatas group. As the last potential 
successor, Pangalos, viewed as an "outsider," has been 
"desperately" attempting to enter the race. Liyeros comments, 
however, that the alternate minister's "garrulous and impulsive" 
statements are probably producing the opposite result. Liyeros 
cites Pangalos' own friends as saying that his greatest 
liability is "his own self." In addition, Pangalos lacks a power 
base in his party. 
  Liyeros concludes that of the four candidates, Arsenis is 
reportedly attracting the support of many deputies, who "are not 
on the same wave length as Simitis, do not trust Pangalos, and 
believe Tsokhatzopoulos could not adequately fill Papandreou's 
shoes." 
  A brief note in the 27 March I KATHIMERINI reports that 
according to recent information, Arsenis has been able to break 
out of his isolation and is maintaining open lines of 
communication with such PASOK luminaries as president of the 
Chamber of Deputies Apostolos Kaklamanis, Yiorgos Katsifaras, 
Minister of Public Order Stavros Papathemelis, Minister to the 
Prime Minister Andonis Livanis, Deputy Minister of Foreign 
Affairs Yiorgos Papandreou, and Stavros Tzoumakas. Reportedly, 
Arsenis has also reinforced his ties with PASOK deputy Yiorgos 
Lianis, a relative of Dhimitra Liani-Papandreou. 
  An article in the 30 March I KATHIMERINI reports on Simitis' 
speech to a large meeting of party officials. The industry 
minister criticized PASOK for its "inability to identify and 
prioritize goals and carry out its announced intentions." 
Simitis was also quoted as saying that "the control of economic 
power and the fairer distribution of income are far-away goals," 
and that "the context of politico-social life as it is now 
shaping fails to convince the public that our attempt at renewal 
will become reality." PASOK, Simitis continued, has been 
unsuccessful in finding a new role in a society where everything 
is changing. While the party leadership views criticism and 
"heretical" opinions as "importune," these usually express 
deeper social concerns or interests. The absence of internal 
confrontations undermines the party's programmatic and 
ideological renewal, as well as its future, Simitis is quoted as 
saying. The article points out that Simitis' criticism, sharp as 
it was, did not include concrete proposals for change. 
  The 27 March Athens weekly TO VIMA TIS KIRIAKIS reports that 
the question of Dhimitra Liani-Papandreou's position in light of 
the upcoming PASOK congress has "bedeviled" the party, given 
that the prime minister's wife and director of his office has 
reportedly been an active PASOK member for a number of years. 
The initial solution of proposing her as a "meritorious" member 
of the central committee was rejected "out of hand" by the prime 
minister. The second proposal was to submit her candidacy to the 
local PASOK organization in Kifisia, to which she belongs, and 
launch her electoral battle for a central committee post from 
that base. The prime minister accepted the proposal and 
Liani-Papandreou was elected with 130 votes out of 220, or 60 
percent, far outpacing other candidates.

<F P=106> [Report by Serdar Turgut: "A Stern U.S. Letter on Cyprus"] </F>
  [Text] Washington--U.S. Secretary of State Warren 
Christopher has conveyed a stern letter to Foreign Minister 
Hikmet Cetin on Cyprus. He urged Ankara to persuade TRNC 
[Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus] President Rauf Denktas to 
agree to resolve the Cyprus problem. The letter, dated 31 
March, held Turkey and Denktas responsible for the lack of 
movement toward a solution in Cyprus. 
  Christopher recalled the guarantee the Ciller government 
gave 
to the United States some time ago to the effect that it will do 
everything it can to contribute toward the effort being made to 
find a solution to the Cyprus problem and said that until now 
Ankara has failed to make any move in accordance with that 
guarantee. Stressing that the absence of a solution in Cyprus 
was largely due to Rauf Denktas' negative approach, Christopher 
said: "Had Turkey used its influence on Denktas in the right 
way, the existing negative conditions would not have been 
created in Cyprus." 
  Christopher also informed Cetin that the UN secretary 
general 
moved to prepare a strong UN Security Council resolution against 
the Turkish Cypriot side when it became apparent that the talks 
were heading toward a deadlock. 
<H5>  Ciller Must Fulfill Her Promise </H5>
  The date of Warren Christopher's stern letter led to 
interesting comments in Washington. The U.S. Administration is 
aware of Prime Minister Tansu Ciller's wish to hold talks with 
President Clinton in Washington when she visits the United 
States on 13 April. In view of that, Warren Christopher's 
letter can be regarded as a high-level reminder to Ankara by the 
U.S. Administration that "Ciller is expected to take a step on 
Cyprus before she embarks on her visit to the United States." 
<H5>  The United States Expects a Concrete Step </H5>
  The reason for the pressure the U.S. Administration has 
directed against Turkey on the Cyprus problem is the guarantee 
Tansu Ciller gave to President Clinton when she visited the 
White House some time ago to the effect that "Turkey will take 
the necessary steps to have that problem resolved as soon as 
possible." Ciller gave that guarantee both in the talks she had 
with President Clinton in camera and in the joint news 
conference she held with him later. In view of that, the U.S. 
Administration expected the Ciller government to take concrete 
steps to contribute toward the effort being made to find a 
solution to the problem between the two communities in Cyprus. 
  Naturally, the term concrete step is a reference to the 
pressure Washington expects Turkey to direct on Denktas to force 
him to change his approach, which the United States believes is 
"irreconcilable." Meanwhile, it is common knowledge that 
President Clinton has clashed with the influential Greek lobby 
in the United States on matters related to The Former Yugoslav 
Republic of Macedonia. In view of that, he attaches significant 
importance to an opportunity to satisfy the Greeks and Greek 
Cypriots by paving the way for the solution of the Cyprus 
problem.

  [Text] Ankara, April 7 (A.A.) -- Foreign Minister Hikmet 
Cetin on Thursday [7 April] expressed support for Turkish 
Republic of Northern Cyprus (TRNC) President Rauf Denktas. 
Cetin said that Denktas' attitude toward the UN 
confidence-building measures [CBM's] is justified and positive. 
Cetin said that the TRNC is rightly reacting to additional 
elements of the confidence-building measures and that this is 
from whence the problem stems. 
  The confidence-building measures involve the opening of the 
Lefkose [Nicosia] Airport to international traffic and the 
inhabited Maras [Varosha] section to UN monitoring. 
  UN-sponsored intercommunal talks on Cyprus were interrupted 
last July. 
  Cyprus has been divided since 1974 when Turkey conducted a 
peace operation to the island following a Greek-backed coup 
which attempted to annex the island to Greece and to annihilate 
its Turkish Cypriot population. 
  The TRNC came to existence in 1983.

  [Text] Foreign Minister Hikmet Cetin has declared that the 
German Government's decision to suspend military aid to Turkey 
was made in the current election atmosphere in Germany and under 
the influence of various circles and under the mistaken 
impression created by the public. 
  In a statement to TRT, Cetin stressed that the German aid 
extended within the framework of NATO is not used for internal 
security purposes, adding: We regret this decision. Pointing 
out that he sent a letter to German Foreign Minister Klaus 
Kinkel on this matter, Cetin remarked that the military 
equipment, which was allegedly used for internal security 
purposes, is similar to that acquired from the Russian 
Federation some time ago. The military equipment received from 
Germany is used only for its original purpose, Cetin stressed. 
He said that he conveyed the issue to the German foreign 
minister in a telephone conversation this evening. 
  [Begin Cetin recording] I spoke to him on the telephone a 
while ago. I related to him that this is very wrong, that 
Turkey and Germany are good friends, and that they have 
important ties. I remarked that various extremists are engaged 
in efforts to disrupt Turkish-German relations, that this is 
wrong, and that in its struggle against terrorism Turkey 
definitely cannot accept such actions, which could lead to 
misunderstandings on the part of its allies and friends. I told 
him that decisions to be made in this vein will damage our 
relations. 
  I believe that the German Government should also attach the 
necessary importance to Turkish-German relations; and I conveyed 
this to him. The German foreign minister noted that he attaches 
great importance to Turkish-German relations, that he is 
dwelling on the subject, and that he will exert every possible 
effort to resolve the problem. He stated that the government 
will discuss the issue again. 
  I would like to take this opportunity to say the following: 
Turkey is facing a serious terrorism problem. In this regard, 
Turkey is determined to exert every possible effort and wage 
every struggle to preserve its unity and integrity within the 
rules of a state of law and democracy. Any indirect 
encouragement accorded by our friends and allies to circles 
which desire to disrupt our relations will adversely affect our 
relations. The Turkish and German peoples and countries will 
certainly not benefit from this. 
  I hope that in the current election atmosphere in Germany, 
such issues will not be used to serve internal political aims, 
because they are too sensitive and important to be used for 
internal politics. Moreover, it is very easy to damage 
relations. You can disrupt relations with the use of one 
sentence or one word, but it will take a long time to repair 
them. I hope that our German friends will realize this fact and 
demonstrate the necessary understanding for Turkey's justified 
cause and position. [end recording]

  [Text] Bosnia-Herzegovina Vice President Ejup Ganic and 
Foreign Affairs Minister Irfan Ljubijankic have arrived in 
Ankara for talks. Foreign Minister Hikmet Cetin received Ganic 
and Ljubijankic at Esenboga Airport. 
  In an airport statement, Cetin recalled that two years have 
passed since the first shots were fired in Sarajevo, adding that 
a historic tragedy has been taking place in the center of Europe 
ever since. Pointing out that the people of Bosnia-Herzegovina 
have been teaching the world a lesson on the issues of human 
rights and independence, Cetin said: 
  [Begin recording] From the very beginning, Turkey has stood 
by its Bosnian brothers and their just cause. It has supported 
their cause and tried to contribute to it. Turkey has always 
believed that it is a just cause and has been in the forefront 
both in the international arena and on a bilateral level. It 
has tried to make every possible contribution toward a just and 
lasting solution of the problem. [end recording] 
  Cetin concluded by saying that Turkey will continue to 
extend 
humanitarian aid and contribute to securing a lasting, just, and 
realistic peace. 
  Ganic said they came to Ankara to assess the recent 
developments in his country in the aftermath of the peace 
concluded with the Croats. He added that Turkey greatly 
contributed to their just cause through efforts exerted during 
the most critical days of the Bosnian people.

<F P=106> [Column by Gungor Mengi: "Transition Period"] </F>
  [Text] "We have liberated Ankara and Istanbul. Next will 
be Turkey as a whole." This statement was made by Prosperity 
Party leader Necmettin Erbakan... That is how he addressed the 
jubilant supporters of his party, who were rejoicing over their 
political party's victory in the local elections. Erbakan's 
speech was covered by the television networks. Scenes from 
rallies were shown during his speech, scenes recalling those 
after Imam Khomeyni's Islamic Revolution in Iran. This 
heightened the uneasiness in the people who watched the Erbakan 
events on their television screens. 
  The claim that the Prosperity Party doubled its votes is 
wrong; it increased its votes by three percent. Nevertheless, 
the fact that its supporters are concentrated in large cities 
had a bearing on the outcome of the local elections. 
  Erbakan's statement that they have "liberated Ankara and 
Istanbul" has created anxiety in the broad masses, that is, the 
other 81 percent of the people. The question that is being 
asked is: From whom have they liberated Ankara and Istanbul? 
  Obviously, 81 percent of the people did not regard 
themselves 
as prisoners of a foreign and hostile force until yesterday. Is 
it that this man who claims that they have "liberated Ankara and 
Istanbul" wishes to announce that the ideology he represents has 
become widespread in the country? 
<H5>  Both a Muslim and a Democrat </H5>
  The Prosperity Party's supporters have complained about an 
increase in provocative activities aimed at deepening the 
anxiety of the people and describing that party as a bogeyman. 
Their complaint is justified. However, they must remember that 
they have to take an understanding approach if they wish to be 
treated with understanding. 
  No one can describe the jubilant feeling of the supporters 
of 
the Prosperity Party as being excessive--that is, provided they 
behave and avoid disrespect for the values that make Turkey a 
free and modern country.... We can still recall the appalling 
incidents during the victory rallies held by the Republican 
People's Party supporters in the 1970's. However, jubilation 
must not be allowed to create a wave of confrontation. We have 
a difficult transition period ahead of us. It will be a matter 
of honor for the Turkish people to prove that the Islamic faith 
can be maintained in a democracy. It will be an opportunity for 
the local administrations to deal with this difficult era 
without serious problems. 
  The Turkish people cannot abandon their freedoms. They 
cannot achieve the level of prosperity they deserve by regarding 
half of the world as their enemy and turning their backs on it. 
  If the Prosperity Party's concept of a Just Order paves the 
ground for green Communism [Communism under the guise of 
religion] and if the mayoral offices that have been taken over 
by that party act in a way reminiscent of despotic Arab 
behavior, the Prosperity Party's fate will definitely be similar 
to that of the Social Democratic Populist Party, which scored a 
significant victory in the local elections in 1989 but suffered 
a serious defeat in the 1991 general elections. 
<H5>  Our Democracy is Durable </H5>
  No one must fear the Prosperity Party. We must not be 
daunted by religious people who get organized. Nor should we be 
daunted by the attire they choose to wear, attire which we 
believe represents horrible regimes. 
  Those people have not come from Iran, Iraq, or Libya. 
Furthermore, neither they nor those who disagree with them will 
leave this country. We shall all coexist. 
  Many people behaved in an unruly way after the Democratic 
Party come to power in 1950. They offended each other with 
their vengeful activities. Furthermore, they challenged those 
who tried to limit them by saying "there is democracy in this 
country." However, 40 years have passed since then and Turkey's 
democracy has matured. Obviously, from time to time we forget 
that fact and become emotional and worried. 
  In view of this, Istanbul Governor Hayri Kozakcioglu's 
statement, which was carried by SABAH yesterday, has been very 
useful. He eased people's anxiety and, as an experienced 
administrator, gave a lesson to the mayors who support the 
Prosperity Party on their duties and powers. 
<H5>  Governor Kozakcioglu is a Good Example </H5>
  The Prosperity Party's officials and supporters have not won 
a victory against the state, nation, and democracy. In fact, 
they owe their victory to the state, nation, and democracy. 
Their success will depend on the respect they show for those 
values. It is true that the people have given them the stage. 
However, they will be removed by the people if they fail to 
realize that fact. Before that, however, they will confront the 
laws of this country. 
  The worried majority of the masses were reassured by 
Governor 
Kozakcioglu's statement that interference in the people's daily 
life, the way people dress, and the people's rights and freedoms 
will be penalized and that the people, state, and contemporary 
way of life are not unprotected. The statement was also 
designed to save the Prosperity Party from paying dearly for the 
activities of ignorant and unruly individuals who misunderstand 
democracy. 
  Kozakcigolu is a good example of the daring and able 
governors our country needs at the present time.... 
  We hope that the officials who have graduated from schools 
for clergymen and preachers will also regard him as an example.

<F P=106> [By Yalcin Dogan from the "Daily" column: "The Prosperity </F>
Plus Nationalist Action Party Government"] 
  [Excerpts] The state's guards in the southeast submitted 
their candidacy as part of the PP [Prosperity Party] and won in 
the municipal elections!... Or, people active in their region, 
who had been kidnapped by Apo [Abdullah Ocalan] and taken into 
the mountains, were released upon Apo's command, came down from 
the mountains, became PP candidates, and became mayors! 
  After Istanbul, Ankara was also lost!... The PP was 
victorious in Ankara as well. According to the current results, 
of the 76 provinces, the PP won 27 and the NAP [Nationalist 
Action Party] eight. Together they received more than 26 
percent of the votes. Given the current election system, the 
meaning of these results "within a suitable geographic 
distribution" is clear: 
  "The 27 March elections have brought the PP-NAP alliance to 
power!" 
  When one studies these results, the TPP [True Path Party] 
enthusiasm over "being the first party" is meaningless. As for 
the SDPP [Social Democratic Populist Party], it has nothing to 
say anyway. Therefore, the current TPP-SDPP government "is 
overshadowed by the PP-NAP alliance." 
  To the aforementioned results, one should also add those in 
Turkey's three metropolitan areas. The PP won outright in 
Istanbul and Ankara. If one also adds the case of Burhan 
Ozfatura from Izmir, who is known to be "a staunch PP man" but 
who ran in the elections as a TPP candidate, one can say that 
three of Turkey's key cities are under the control of the PP. 
Furthermore, one should bear in mind that "the NAP supported 
the TPP in Izmir" and that Ozfatura won the elections "by 
consolidating his religious identity through the support of the 
NAP." 
  Predictions have been fulfilled. The votes cast as a 
backlash from the suburbs of the metropolitan areas were cast 
for the PP. The future of these cities is not being determined 
by their "owners" but by "outsiders" who immigrated to the 
suburbs. 
  I have been talking to those who have served as mayors in 
the 
southeast for the last five years. A most striking reality 
surfaced in phone conversations I had with them yesterday. "Why 
was the PP particularly successful in the southeast?" I seek 
the answer to this question.... 
  One should first clarify a contradiction. The PP has become 
synonymous with "reaction to the current order," while the PP 
candidates who won the elections are actually "the guardians of 
the order!" For example, the new mayor of Kars is from the NAP 
and is a guard.... The mayors of Cizre, Midyat, Dargecit, and 
Guclukonak are "PP members who were formerly guards!" Another 
example is the new mayor of Batman, who "is a citizen who has 
very close ties with Hezbollah"! 
  There is a contradiction here. When addressing the people, 
the PP claims to be opposed to the current order, but when it 
comes to electing its candidates, it "depends on the state." 
  The state is not even aware of this ploy. 
  Some of the candidates were "Apo's guests in the mountains" 
prior to the elections!... Anyway, most of them are of Kurdish 
origin.... Once they came down from the mountains, they 
cooperated with the PP and, through the "Apo-PP alliance," won 
the mayoralties for the PP. The PP candidates have continuously 
stated that "they are aware of the Kurdish reality but that they 
will solve the Kurdish problem through brotherhood and peace 
within the Islamic framework." The Kurdish reality in the 
world; "the keys of heaven in the hereafter!" That is what has 
been promised. 
  Furthermore, the people in the southeast are basically 
opposed to the following: ANAP [Motherland Party] particularly 
and the TPP propose eradicating terror "through military 
measures alone." The people are suffering as a result of this 
policy. 
  The PP, however, says that it "will put a stop to the 
bloodshed" and is thus sympathetic to the people. It talks 
about a solution other than a military one. At this point, in 
reaction against the other parties, the "TPP and ANAP votes are 
going to the PP". This is not a casual claim. Gaziantep and 
Rize are concrete examples. [passage omitted] 
  On one hand, there is the PP-NAP alliance, with some 26 
percent of the votes. On the other, there are millions of 
people "who constitute some 74 percent of the vote and who will 
have to bow down to the PP-NAP alliance!" Currently, 26 percent 
are victorious and 74 percent defeated! Who caused this? The 
very honorable leaders of the TPP, ANAP, the SDPP, the DLP 
[Democratic Left Party], and the RPP [Republican People's Party] 
and their administrations! May the election results be 
auspicious to you honorable leaders!

  [Text] Ankara -- Bahattin Gunel, assistant general 
secretary of the DEP [Democracy Party], indicated that the 
people in the [Kurdish] region refused to go to the polls in 
protest of the existing political system, and argued that the 
mayors who won election with the support of the state, special 
teams, and village guards cannot represent the people and 
therefore are illegitimate. 
  Gunel announced that they are not going to set up a new 
party 
and will defend the DEP to the very end. 
  At a news conference yesterday, Bahattin Gunel disclosed the 
decisions adopted at the DEP assembly the previous day. 
  Indicating that they are resolved to defend the legal 
democratic foundation to the very end, Gunel said that the 
leading party officials will not resign from the party to evade 
being barred from political life. 
  Pointing to the abolition of the HEP [People's Toil Party] 
and OZDEP [Freedom and Democracy Party], Gunel said: "If the 
DEP too is closed down, we will see how we must deal with the 
situation. If a political vacuum arises we will fill it." 
  Indicating that the Welfare Party's rise was not genuine, 
Bahattin Gunel said that "despite attempts to appear otherwise, 
the Welfare Party is also one of the political system's parties" 
and that it got state support during these elections. 
  Indicating that the DEP was the most successful party in the 
elections from which it was forced to withdraw, Gunel said: "In 
general, the Kurdish people in the east and southeast protested 
against the political system by either not going to the polls or 
by burning their ballots. In some places the protesters 
amounted to 60 percent of the voters." 
  Indicating that the elected mayors are illegitimate, 
Bahattin 
Gunel said that the candidates elected by "the state, special 
teams, and village guards" cannot represent the people.

  [Text] Vladimir Zhirinovskiy, the chairman of the Russian 
Liberal Democratic Party, who has constantly tried to draw 
attention to himself while in Finland, left Finland at 1200. 
Before he left, he had time to give a lecture on his policies 
lasting nearly two hours to foreign correspondents working in 
Helsinki. Zhirinovskiy's main message this time was that the 
West should keep its hands off Russia. He considers himself to 
be the savior of Russia. Sinikka Siekkinen has been following 
Zhirinovskiy's visit to Finland. 
  [Siekkinen] During his visit, Zhirinovskiy has been busy in 
different parts of Helsinki and given controversial statements, 
sometimes at a striptease night club and sometimes at the grave 
of Mannerheim. Immediately after his arrival, Zhirinovskiy 
threatened Estonia with occupation and Finland with nuclear war, 
but official Finland kept quiet on Zhirinovskiy's statements. 
This is how Foreign Minister Heikki Haavisto answered my 
question today. 
  [Begin recording] [Siekkinen] Is Finland cringing before 
Zhirinovskiy when Finland has not officially reacted to his 
statements? 
  [Haavisto] In my view he has been here as the guest of the 
Eduskunta, and in my view the Eduskunta should take 
responsibility for his visit here and his possible statements. 
[end recording] 
  [Siekkinen] Zhirinovskiy, who is experienced as a 
troublemaker, has been banned from several countries, but 
wherever he is, he raises curiosity. At the news conference 
this morning, many had come to listen to Zhirinovskiy in order 
to try to understand his line of thought. Zhirinovskiy rewarded 
his listeners by giving a fairly comprehensive but confusing and 
controversial review on the aims of his policies. The starting 
point of his policies is that Russia has been betrayed three 
times this century: First during the Russian Empire, then during 
communism, and now during the so-called democracy, however, this 
time without weapons. Zhirinovskiy will not tolerate a fourth 
time. 
  [Begin Zhirinovskiy recording in Russian fading to English 
translation] Either the West leaves us alone and we take care of 
our own problem and solve our own problems. [end recording] 
  [Siekkinen] He urged the West to keep its hands off Russia, 
because according to Zhirinovskiy, Russia can solve its problems 
itself and if the West does not realize this, the disintegration 
of Russia will continue and there will be a third world war. 
Zhirinovskiy regards himself as the savior of Russia with a 
historic mission. The greatest threat to Russia comes from the 
south, where there are 400 million Muslims. Zhirinovskiy 
regards them as barbarians who also threaten Western Europe 
unless he and Russia stop the south, with nuclear arms, if need 
be. 
  [Begin Zhirinovskiy recording in Russian, fading to English 
translation] I am against using, I am an opponent to the use of 
any kind of weapons, whether it be nuclear or conventional but 
[words indistinct] the interest of Russia. [end recording] 
  [Siekkinen] Zhirinovskiy says that he is against the use of 
any kind of weapons, but if Russia is threatened, it has the 
right to use all kinds of weapons it has, including nuclear 
weapons. After these statements Zhirinovskiy left for home to 
solve the problems of his own parliamentary group. Yesterday, 
two members of his parliamentary group resigned, tired of 
Zhirinovskiy's policies.

<F P=106> [Report on interview with Social Democratic Party secretary </F>
Mona Sahlin by Hans O. Alfredsson; place and date not given] 
  [Text] The Liberal Party, like the Center Party, is 
welcome to work together with the Social Democrats if there is a 
change of government in the fall -- and perhaps even form part 
of that same government. Party secretary Mona Sahlin is happy 
to repeat this invitation six months before the election, 
despite the fact that it is not that popular in all circles of 
the Social Democratic movement. 
  All those at the Confederation of Trade Unions [LO] and in 
Sweden's workplaces who are impatient and are waiting for an 
announcement about the levels of compensation that will be paid 
out by the unemployment benefit fund will have to go on waiting. 
Mona Sahlin refuses to tie herself to a date. The unemployment 
benefit will be raised to 90 percent again "at some point in the 
future," when the economy has improved. That is all the Social 
Democrats will promise before the election. 
  More or less the same phrase has been used about parents' 
insurance. The message a few years ago was that the Social 
Democrats would honor their abandoned promise to extend parents' 
insurance as soon as the economy improves. It would be the 
first thing they would do. 
  What is top of the list now -- the unemployment benefit or 
parents' insurance? Mona Sahlin shied away from the question a 
little. If I had 5 billion, she said, it would be spent on jobs 
and training places. As far as benefit levels are concerned, 
the long-term sick are first in line. They are being promised 
more than the 70 percent from the sickness insurance fund they 
get today -- when the economy improves. 
  "But obviously increased benefits from the unemployment fund 
take precedence over longer vacations and an extension of 
parents' insurance. Yes, these latter two are quite a way down 
the list now. Unemployment and the poor state of the economy -- 
things that are interconnected -- push them down the list." 
  Mona Sahlin was not particularly surprised by the diagram 
from SVENSKA DAGBLADET/Institute for Market Research that shows 
that 20 percent of Social Democratic sympathizers could envisage 
voting for the Moderate Coalition Party. But she believes that 
"the threshold for them actually voting like that is very high." 
She has no doubts that views on some issues can coincide. 
  "If you want me to be extremely surprised -- well, I am not. 
It is probably possible to find workers in the metal industry, 
for example -- now people in the Metalworkers' Union will 
probably be angry -- who sympathize with the idea of low 
taxation, who feel that people should look after themselves, 
that there should not be a whole mass of benefit payments and 
the like. You often run into this sort of view in workplaces." 
  She believes that the diagram also reflects that fact that 
voters are moving across party boundaries more nowadays and make 
up their minds at a late stage in election campaigns. 
  "For a very long time we had a very good life as a result of 
the fact that many people voted Social Democrat out of 
tradition, because that's the way things were supposed to be. 
In recent years voters have become more and more unfaithful. 
What class you come from means less and less." 
  Mona Sahlin is happy to admit that things certainly do look 
good in the opinion polls, but she warns against banking on a 
victory in advance. She is in the habit of reminding her party 
colleagues that there are more than 170 days left before the 
election. She is careful not to appear too optimistic. 
  "It is more my job to see to it that everybody works their 
butts off between now and the election." 
  "To the annoyance of many people," as she put it, more than 
a 
year ago she and Ingvar Carlsson said publicly that broad 
agreements and close cooperation with other parties will be 
needed to solve the challenges facing Sweden. 
  Even with their own Riksdag majority the Social Democrats 
could contemplate a government coalition with the Liberal Party, 
for example. Mona Sahlin adheres to this view. 
  "Yes, that still applies. The problems that will have to be 
solved by the government that is in power after the election 
will not be dealt with in the life of a single Riksdag. The 
market, companies, citizens have to be able to be confident that 
the decisions that are taken will apply for a long time. This 
applies, for example, to social insurance, the pension system, 
the financing of homes, European policy." 
  In Mona Sahlin's view, if it proves impossible to create 
this 
sort of trust and confidence in the political decisionmaking 
process, it will also be impossible to successfully tackle the 
issue of jobs and social welfare. 
  The open flirting with the Liberal Party has been 
conspicuous 
by its absence for a while, but this does not mean that the 
suitor has lost interest. 
  "No, we have said what we think and we stand firm on that. 
But there has indeed been a lot of discussion of this at party 
meetings. `Why are you flirting and why are you talking; will 
Wibble really have a seat in our government?' people ask. At 
every meeting I am asked the question: Why do you go on about 
cooperation with other parties when we have 50 percent in the 
opinion polls and are going to win the election? That is when I 
generally ask a counterquestion: How many people here think 
that we will win 50 percent of the vote in all the elections 
over the next 30 years? No one raises a hand." 
  She described a coalition with the Left Party as completely 
out of the question. Nor does she believe in any form of closer 
cooperation in the Riksdag -- if, that is, the Left Party 
manages to hang on in the Riksdag ("there is probably a major 
risk that they will end up outside it"). 
  "They have a lot left to prove if they are to be a partner 
to 
really rely on. They are not showing this today." 
  No one needs to have any doubts about "what the Social 
Democrats want" in the election campaign: 
  "We want a majority of our own -- this is really our first 
objective. The most important thing is to win the election; the 
second most important thing is to remove the right wing from 
influence over Swedish politics for decades to come. For me the 
right wing is the Moderates, New Democracy, and the Christian 
Democratic Party. Our main opponents are of course the 
Moderates." 
  Mona Sahlin believes that it will be a "real right-left 
election, an ideological election. 
  ``It will be a test of the strength of solidarity. It will 
be those who have jobs and incomes and are well showing their 
solidarity by making sacrifices for those who are not as well 
off. It is a question of realizing how much this will require.'' 
  For the Social Democrats an important goal is to win over 
the 
whole of the movement to this realization. Mona Sahlin claimed, 
as is customary, that relations with the LO are good. The 
unemployment benefit fund is the only dissonance. The situation 
regarding a joint election campaign leadership this year is 
unclear. The LO and the party has traditionally always had such 
a joint campaign leadership. 
  "My point of departure is that everything is not hunky-dory 
simply because that is the way you have done things in the 
past," she replied when asked if it is desirable that the LO 
chairman should be part of the election campaign leadership. 
  She worked well with Stig Malm, she said, even though he 
described things differently in a recent radio program. 
  "Yes, it is clear that he did not think so. He can think 
exactly what he likes about me as a person. I will not descend 
to the level of any talk about what he is like. However, I am 
happy to repeat that I think that he was an excellent LO 
chairman who forced the pace on many important issues. It is 
very sad that he is so bitter now." 
  Alongside the normal political issues the party will devote 
itself to the EU [European Union] over the next few months. The 
Social Democrats will reach their decision on membership at an 
extraordinary congress immediately before midsummer. 
  Why is this so important? There is after all going to be a 
referendum, and the Social Democrats have committed themselves 
to falling in with the result. 
  "I think that it is important that citizens receive some 
guidance about what the parties think and how they have argued 
their way forward to a decision. It is not simply a question of 
a yes or a no; it is also a question of how the parties think we 
should work in Europe, what we should do with a possible future 
yes." 
  One or two people have expressed concern that the party's 
approach to the issue could split the party, that a factional 
conflict could arise that could leave deep scars for a long time 
to come. Mona Sahlin does not share this concern. 
  "What is new and different for us is that even after the 
congress no one is going to hit someone else across the head 
simply for continuing to promote the line he believes in. This 
is a pretty new way for our party to work. We have often had a 
tendency to carry on all debates internally and then when we 
have voted and found a party line, we open the door and say not 
a word about where we have disagreed. On this issue we have 
chosen to do the reverse." 
  Mona Sahlin assured me that the Social Democrats will view 
the referendum as binding -- that is, in the Riksdag they will 
vote for the line that wins most votes regardless of the number 
who abstain. This is how Ingvar Carlsson's talk of "50.5 
percent" is to be interpreted. There is no suggestion of a 
demand for an absolute majority for yes or no.

  [Text] Geneva, April 8 (AFP) -- UN Secretary General 
Butrus Butrus-Ghali Friday [8 April] ordered his special envoy 
in Rwanda to bolster safety measures in the country and 
especially in the capital, where chaos has broken out since the 
deaths of the Rwandan and Burundian presidents this week. 
  In a written statement read by his spokeswoman Therese 
Gastaut, he also condemned "the odious attacks" in which 10 
United Nations peacekeepers died. 
  Butrus-Ghali said he was asking his envoy in Rwanda, 
Jacques-Roger Booh-Booh, "to take all measures to guarantee 
safety throughout the country and particularly in Kigali," the 
capital. 
  There were no details on what measures Booh-Booh would be 
asked to enact. Some 2,500 UN peacekeepers are in the country 
to help ensure a peaceful transition to elections scheduled to 
take place next year. 
  Pandemonium and ethnic violence have broken out in the 
country since the deaths of the two presidents in a plane crash 
Wednesday evening. 
  The UN chief also said he had "learned with great 
indignation 
of the new incidents in Rwanda and especially the tragic death 
of Rwandan Prime Minister Agathe Uwilingiyimana." 
  He was working on a report for the Security Council 
recommending ways of protecting UN staff, the statement said. 
  In Brussels earlier, sources said Rwandan employees of 
foreign aid workers in Kigali have been murdered by Rwandan 
troops, while at least 22 Rwandan missionary priests and nuns 
have been killed amid the ethnic violence. 
  Troops have been blamed for the murder Thursday of 
Uwilingiyimana, killed in the aftermath of the plane crash 
deaths.

<F P=106> [Report by "Our Economics Staff": "GATT Sees World Trade </F>
Rising Up to 5 Percent"] 
  [Text] World trade should expand between 2.5 percent and 5 
percent this year but whether it turns out to be at the lower or 
upper end of this range depends crucially on the extent and 
timing of economic recovery in Japan and West Europe, the 
General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT) says today. 
  GATT economists say in an annual report that global exports 
grew by only 2.5 percent in 1993, a deceleration from the 4.5 
percent increase seen in 1992. 
  The value of global merchandise trade dropped 2 percent to 
$3,580 billion between 1992 and 1993. Trade in services -- 
including tourism, transport, telecommunications, insurance and 
banking -- is estimated to have grown a modest 3 percent in 1993 
to $1.03 billion according to preliminary findings. This 
compares with a 12 percent increase in 1992. 
  GATT says that this poor performance in trade was largely 
due 
to recession in continental Europe, where both exports and 
imports fell for the first time in 40 years, and that recovery 
in this area was crucial to its forecast. The report says that 
if there is a mild recovery in Europe, the volume of world trade 
could expand 5 percent or more. But "if, instead, delays occur 
in the recovery of West Europe or in Japan, trade growth is 
likely to be closer to last years 2.5 percent," it adds. 
  Low demand in several European countries, including France, 
Germany and Italy, coupled with the dollars appreciation against 
European currencies, meant the dollar value of West Europe's 
trade had fallen 10 percent, the largest decline since the 
Second World War. 
  The report says that the latest figures for continental 
Europe and Japan suggest that recessionary pressures had receded 
by the end of last year but that it is still too early to tell 
whether recovery has begun. Trade activity remains relatively 
weak in Africa, the Middle East, Central and East Europe and the 
republics of the former Soviet Union. 
  In contrast, Asia, Latin America and North America recorded 
above-average growth in Import volumes. Latin America had the 
biggest growth in export volumes, up 9.5 percent in the last 
year, followed by Asia with a 6 per cent rise in exports. North 
American export volumes rose 5.5 percent in 1993 compared with 8 
percent in 1992. Canadian and U.S. import volumes Jumped 11 
percent compared with 8 percent the previous year.

<F P=106> [Unattributed article: "Any Government Can Continue </F>
Privatizations, Ciampi"] 
  [Text] (ANSA) Rome, April 7 -- Privatizations begun under 
his administration can continue under either a left-wing or a 
right-wing government, according to acting Prime Minister Carlo 
Azeglio Ciampi. 
  "Privatizations are compatible with a government of the 
right 
or of the left," Ciampi said in a public television interview, 
adding that two positive results will come from privatizations: 
"improved company management and the creation of a wider 
financial market, which this country needs." 
  The state will not "disappear" from the economic field, 
Ciampi said: "it will remain part of the economy because it's 
good for the state to be present in some sectors and because it 
is the state that sets rules and enforces the rules, leaving the 
private sector free to work within these rules." 
  Deregulation, according to Ciampi, means "greater freedom to 
operate, not the total abandonment of all rules." 
  Ciampi stressed that the central bank must retain its 
autonomy and that the government must provide "direction and 
guarantees." 
  Turning back to privatizations, Ciampi said that when his 
government was formed in spring 1993, there had been talk of 
privatizations for years but that nothing had been done. Now 
they are under full steam, he claimed, citing the sale of Comit, 
Credit and part of IMI [Italian Institute for Financing Personal 
and Real Property], and plans for the sale of STET [Turin 
Telephone Finance Company] and SME, as well as part of the steel 
sector. 
  He also predicted that fiscal pressure would drop one 
percent 
this year.

<F P=106> [By Chris Moncrieff, PRESS ASSOCIATION political editor] </F>
  [Text] The Prime Minister today bluntly rejected the demand 
by Sinn Fein President Gerry Adams for a "direct dialogue" to 
clarify the Downing Street Declaration, and told him that 
violence must stop now -- and for good. 
  His uncompromising message came in a letter from Downing 
Street as Mr Adams warned the people of Ulster that the current 
IRA three-day ceasefire was unlikely to continue. 
  "We are well into the peace process and we are going to keep 
moving it forward," Mr Adams said. 
  But he added: "It seems to me unlikely, even logistically, 
for the IRA to extend its suspension." 
  It appears that these chilling words "crossed in the post" 
with the Downing Street letter, which was on its way to him when 
they were uttered. The letter is written by the Prime 
Minister's private secretary, Roderic Lyne. 
  They demonstrated that neither side had budged an inch. The 
British Government demands -- as does the Irish Government -- a 
permanent cessation of violence before Sinn Fein can even be 
considered as a constitutional political party to join the 
others in thrashing out Ulster's future. 
  And, it would seem, Sinn Fein, which accused Downing Street 
of "hard-line posturing" remains adamant that the declaration 
must be clarified to end the deadlock. 
  The Downing Street letter, which was in response to two 
letters written to the Prime Minister by Mr Adams over the past 
10 days, offered no concessions. 
  It said: "The joint declaration offers the way forward. Sinn 
Fein can take it. Or reject it. But if violence continues, it 
will only be because Sinn Fein have spurned the opportunity to 
enter the democratic process." 
  Mr Adams was told that he saw direct dialogue as a means of 
demonstrating recognition of Sinn Fein's position as a political 
party with a valid electoral mandate. 
  "You are wrong to say the Government has caused a stalemate. 
Any pause in the movement towards peace is because of the 
continuing violence, and Sinn Fein's failure unequivocally to 
renounce violence as a means of achieving political ends. 
  ``It is Sinn Fein that excludes itself from playing a full 
part in the political process.'' 
  The letter recalled that Mr Major said last December that if 
there were a permanent end to violence, and if Sinn Fein 
committed itself to the democratic process, then the Government 
would be ready to enter into preliminary exploratory dialogue 
with it within three months. 
  "We await a positive response. The people of the island of 
Ireland, north and south, and from both traditions, want 
violence to stop now, not temporarily, but for good. So do 
their governments. 
  ``The joint declaration offers the way forward. Sinn Fein 
can take it. Or reject it. But if violence continues, it will 
only be because Sinn Fein have spurned the opportunity to enter 
the democratic process.'' 
  Meanwhile, Mr Adams was saying he felt "optimistic" about 
the 
future. 
  He told BBC Radio Ulster's Talkback: "The sort of hard-line 
posturing from Downing Street cannot disguise the fact that the 
very positive message from the IRA will have been taken on 
board, I believe, by the policy-makers. 
  ``Even if, because of John Major's leadership difficulties, 
they cannot respond at this time, I am sure that the 
significance and potential of the suspension will outlast its 
duration. So I am quite optimistic.'' 
  Mr Adams has written to US President Bill Clinton explaining 
the background to the ceasefire, according to a newspaper report 
today. 
  The IRISH TiMES said the letter was known to have been 
delivered to a senior White House aide outlining the 
circumstances behind the suspension of violence and setting out 
in detail Sinn Fein's position. 
  The ceasefire has been holding, with police confirming today 
there had been no terrorist attacks involving the Provisionals 
since the truce started on Tuesday night [5 April]. 
  Elsewhere, Peter Robinson, deputy leader of the Democratic 
Unionists, said: "What Adams describes as a peace process is a 
surrender process that the Government is engaged in. 
  ``I hope the Government will learn the lesson that you 
cannot 
placate the IRA. They will continue to ask for more and give 
nothing in return. The stay of execution is simply a tactical 
ploy to rest their so-called volunteers to plan more operations 
to kill more people.'' 
  Irish Prime Minister Albert Reynolds joined in the calls for 
the ceasefire to be extended. 
  Speaking on holiday in Cyprus, Mr Reynolds said: "I 
recognise 
the very strong momentum among ordinary people on both sides for 
peace and in that context I regard an extension of the ceasefire 
as essential." 
  Foreign Minister Dick Spring said the ceasefire was "a 
pathetically brief respite for those who have suffered so much 
from violence." 
  He told a conference in Tralee, Co Kerry, attended by U.S. 
Ambassador Jean Kennedy Smith and SDLP leader John Hume, that 
the Dublin Government wanted a permanent end to IRA violence. 
  "If it (the ceasefire) is to have any potential, that can be 
realised only by extending it and making it permanent." 
  Tory MP Peter Bottomley, a former Northern Ireland Minister, 
told the PA today: "Gerry Adams has known for 19 years that it 
is violence that excludes him from ordinary politics. 
  ``If he ends violence, after a time his group can become a 
political party. So the door is open.'' 
  Later, Mr Adams described the Downing Street reply as 
"evasive and wholly inadequate." 
  He said: "This letter is a transparent attempt to evade the 
issues which I raised in my correspondence and it is a wholly 
inadequate response to the very real opportunity to move the 
peace process forward that currently exists. 
  ``The IRA's three-day suspension of its activities was 
unilateral and without condition. Sinn Fein welcomed this and 
identified it as an opportunity to end the present stalemate 
around the issue of clarification. Unfortunately Mr Major does 
not share our concern to move forward.'' 
  Mr Adams also published for the first time the letter he 
wrote to Mr Major accusing ministers of a "negative and 
dismissive" response to the IRA's "significant initiative." 
  He urged the Prime Minister "to reflect on the seriousness 
of 
the present situation and on the opportunity to move out of the 
present impasse, provided by the IRA. 
  ``I would again urge you to grasp this opportunity to move 
the peace process forward. You can best do so by authorising a 
meeting with representatives of Sinn Fein so that we can receive 
clarification of the Downing Street declaration in the same 
manner it was provided to other particular parties. 
  ``Your refusal to do so up to now has created the present 
stalemate situation. It is crucial to the peace process that 
this stalemate be ended.'' 
  He went on: "Clarification is required so that Sinn Fein and 
everyone else, can properly and fully explore how the peace 
process can be moved forward at this time, and specifically how 
the Downing Street declaration fits into this. 
  ``Direct dialogue is the most obvious and most effective 
method of providing the necessary clarification.'' 
  Mr Adams added: "We cannot accept a situation in which those 
who vote for our party are discriminated against and excluded 
from involvement in the political process. 
  ``I understand that you face many difficulties but I am 
convinced that the initiative taken by the IRA creates the 
opportunity for you to respond in a way which moves this peace 
process out of the present impasse.''

  [Text] Geneva, April 7 (AFP) -- International aid for the 
former communist countries of East Europe is insufficient in 
volume and should be better coordinated, a joint UN-EU 
commission said Thursday [7 April]. 
  The United Nations Economic Commission for Europe made the 
comments in the 1993-1994 edition of its annual report, 
published here. 
  The aid is insufficient given "the scale and complexity of 
the problems to be overcome," the Commission said, adding that 
it was "vitally important" to improve the coordination of 
diverse international assistance. 
  The international community should aim at "avoiding 
duplication among the many sources of international assistance 
but also addressing the more fundamental issues of coordinating 
short-term stabilisation with long-term structural adjustment 
programmes." 
  Aid should be targeted "within coherent national programmes 
of economic reconstruction and development." 
  The Commission said it supported the proposal put forward by 
GATT Director General Peter Sutherland for the creation of a new 
high level international authority to coordinate aid and 
associated discussions with economies in transition. 
  It advised following the "wisdom" of the leaders of the post 
World War II Marshall Plan in "insisting that such programmes 
for economic transformation are the primary responsibility of 
the countries themselves." 
  National leaders know better than outsiders the local 
economic conditions and know their own people's "national 
preferences for one set of social and institutional arrangements 
over another." 
  "To regard the transition process as simply an economic 
problem which can be left to technical experts is to risk the 
loss of popular support for the entire process of reform," the 
commission said. 
  Better coordination of aid would allow agencies to react 
more 
quickly to new circumstances, as they arose, it went on. 
  The key questions of debts owed by former state businesses, 
banking solvency and large business restructuring "were not all 
anticipated four years ago," after the fall of Iron Curtain. 
  It is therefore "reasonable to assume that unexpected 
obstacles will continue to emerge," particularly in countries 
seen as doing well, such as Poland and the Czech Republic. 
  "The problems of structural change and macroeconomic 
stability are still considerable in these economies. The 
fragility of the recovery could be soon tested by the increasing 
resistance of the labour force to further reductions in real 
wages," the commission said. 
  For 1994, it predicted overall growth in East European 
output 
of "a modest one percent (which) would be the first year of 
growth since the collapse of the old system." 
  But "there seems to be little chance of the decline in 
output 
in Russia and most of the other (former Soviet) CIS countries 
coming to an end in 1994."

  [Text] Bonn (DDP/ADN) -- The German Government has 
confirmed the suspension of all weapons deliveries to Turkey. 
Government Spokesman Dieter Vogel said today that Bonn was 
obliged to investigate whether material from German deliveries 
to Turkey was being used in Turkey's conflict with the Kurds. 
  Vogel said the government is in possession of reports to 
this 
effect from Germans who were recently in Turkey. He admitted, 
however, that it would be difficult to prove whether the 
suspected items from stocks of the former GDR National People's 
Army in fact originated from German supplies, and not from sales 
by former Warsaw Pact states. 
  The government spokesman at the same time confirmed that 
Bonn 
favors, in principle, the deportation of militant Kurds from 
Germany. It must, however, be guaranteed that the expellees are 
threatened neither with the death sentence nor with torture in 
Turkey. If a relevant agreement is signed with Turkey, the 
German Government has "not the slightest doubt" Ankara would 
adhere to it.

  [Excerpts] French Minister for Cooperation Michel Roussin 
said he was dismayed at the news of the death of the Rwandan and 
Burundi presidents. Here is a statement by the spokesman of the 
French Foreign Ministry Richard Duque: 
  [Begin Duque recording] First, France deplores the brutal 
death of the Rwandan and Burundian presidents. We would like to 
extend our condolences to the families of the presidents and to 
the families of the other victims. You also know that the crew 
were French. We deplore their deaths and extend our condolences 
to their families as well. We do not have any particular 
information on the circumstances in which the plane of the 
Rwandan president crashed yesterday evening. We think that 
there is a need for an international investigation in order to 
find out precisely what caused the crash and who was 
responsible. [end recording] 
  An emergency meeting was held this morning in Paris. There 
were representatives of the presidency, the prime minister, and 
of the ministries of defense and foreign affairs. The French 
forces based in Bangui, in the Central African Republic, have 
been put on alert. [passage omitted] According to the 
government, there are 600 French nationals in Rwanda and 700 in 
Burundi. [passage omitted]

  [Text] There has been an unexpected development in the 
negotiations for the formation of a new government. After 
months of bitter argument, the leaders of the Northern League 
and the National Alliance met for the first time this morning. 
Their meeting lasted for an hour and had at its heart the theme 
of federalism. Furthermore, relations between Umberto Bossi and 
Gianfranco Fini appear to have thawed. Daniela Calastri 
interviewed Gianfranco Fini and [Northern League Senator] 
Francesco Speroni. 
  [Begin recording] [Fini] I certainly wanted a positive 
dialogue concerning the formation of the new government. As far 
as federalism is concerned, we will give the constitutionalists 
time to discuss matters further and to make verifications. 
  [Calastri] Has Bossi agreed to your taking part in the 
government? 
  [Fini] I believe that this problem has been overcome. 
  [Calastri] Do you agree with the idea put forward by the 
League of a prime minister who instigates the reform to a 
federal state and then a takeover by Silvio Berlusconi in the 
following months? 
  [Fini] We did not speak about this aspect. I believe that it 
up to the president to decide. I believe that President Oscar 
Luigi Scalfaro must appoint Silvio Berlusconi to the post of 
prime minister. [end recording] 
  [Begin recording] [Speroni] Finally we have managed to 
convince a political force that appeared to be the heir of an 
old fashioned style of centralism to sit down at the table and 
discuss federalism. This is a positive thing. 
  [Calastri] Who will be the head of the government? 
  [Speroni] It will be up to Scalfaro to decide this. I agree 
with Berlusconi on this point. Scalfaro must decide. 
  [Calastri] So certainly not Berlusconi then? 
  [Speroni] At present we have begun to tackle the issue of 
federalism. We will speak about the government later. 
  [Calastri] If Scalfaro proposes Berlusconi, then this would 
be fine by you? 
  [Speroni] There are still obstacles. First of all, we must 
chose the speakers of the chambers, then Carlo Azeglio Ciampi 
must resign and then Scalfaro must undertake his round of 
consultations. Only then will it be possible to see who the 
prime minister will be. [end recording] 
  [Announcer] Silvio Berlusconi was aware of the meeting 
between Fini and Bossi. He said that he was very happy about 
this. The news was revealed a short time ago by Gianfranco 
Fini, the leader of the National Alliance.

  [Text] Cavaco Silva has stated again today that he will not 
be prime minister without an absolute majority at the next 
elections. The prime minister went to the TSF radio station to 
say that a government without an absolute majority would be a 
mistake and a disaster: 
  [Correspondent] Prime Minister Cavaco Silva arrived in a 
good 
mood at the TSF studios for an interview in which he would be 
willing to talk about everything: 
  [Cavaco Silva] "I got up very late because I went to bed 
very 
late last night, therefore I had very little time to think." 
  [Correspondent] Neverthless, he was very well prepared for 
the debate. For over one hour, he did not hide his wish to have 
stability when governing the country: 
  [Cavaco Silva] "Portugal does not have conditions at present 
within Europe if it does not have political and government 
stability. I think it would be a tremendous mistake for 
Portugal to return to the time when, in 11 years, we had 16 
governments each lasting nine months; I think that would be a 
disaster." 
  [Correspondent] As far as a possible government reshuffle is 
concerned, he admitted the future replacement of the minister of 
agriculture, but rejected the idea of a substantial reshuffle in 
his cabinet: 
  [Cavaco Silva] "It is not part of my intentions to have 
substantial, profound cabinet reshuffles before the legislative 
elections of October 1995." 
  [Correspondent] He went on further to debate the economy: 
interest rates, the inflation, the escudo, and the opportunity 
for it to enter the European Monetary System [EMS]. From Cavaco 
Silva's comments on these topics, we have got two main messages: 
One is on inflation: 
  [Cavaco Silva] "I believe that Portugal has conditions in 
1994 to have the lowest interest rate in the past 23 to 24 
years." 
  [Correspondent] The other relates to his decision about the 
EMS: 
  [Cavaco Silva] "I believe that that decision about the EMS 
will have been one of the most decisive and important decisions 
I have taken as prime minister." 
  [Correspondent] He made a reference to the role of the 
opposition toward the end of the interview and also made a 
request: 
  [Cavaco Silva] "What I will be asking is for public opinion 
to exert a certain pressure on the Socialist Party for it to be 
a little more credible, for it to be a little more honest, a 
little more sensible, and be little more moderate. Our country 
needs that, our country needs that."

  [Text] This afternoon President Glavkos Kliridhis will 
inform Robert Lamb, the U.S. coordinator on the Cyprus issue, 
that the process of the proximity talks cannot continue, 
following the Turkish side's negative stance. The meeting 
between Mr. Kliridhis and the U.S. official has been set for 
1700 today. Mr. Lamb had a meeting with Turkish Cypriot leader 
Rauf Denktas this morning. 
  Government spokesman Ioannis Kasoulidhis said that President 
Kliridhis will also stress to the U.S. official that the only 
thing that can be done at this time for an agreement is for the 
Turkish side to accept the UN document as it stands. 
  Responding to questions, Mr. Kasoulidhis said that the Greek 
Cypriot side will cooperate fully with the UN secretary general 
with the aim of having the 21 March document accepted, because 
without its acceptance any dialogue would be fruitless. Mr. 
Kasoulidhis also noted that many things will become clear at the 
Kliridhis-Lamb meeting this afternoon. He also gave a negative 
answer to a question on whether pressure is being exercised on 
our side. Mr. Kasoulidhis further expressed the view that the 
United Nations will not continue to be hopeful after the end of 
April that Rauf Denktas will change his stand if he does not 
accept the document by then. 
  The government spokesman also said that representations have 
been made to third parties on their intervention with the UN 
secretary general to amend his original report, but the 
spokesman did not make it clear who these third parties are. 
Responding to a question, Mr. Kasoulidhis said that if third 
parties want to contribute toward a Cyprus solution they can do 
so provided they realize that the very initiative of the 
secretary general's representatives is in danger of failing if 
the time limits are not observed and the international 
organization is discouraged from remaining firm on the result it 
had decided upon. 
  Responding to a question whether the government is satisfied 
with President Clinton's election commitments, the government 
spokesman said that it is too early to answer this question 
because, as he noted, the Cyprus Government would first like to 
see the U.S. reaction when the effort it is making to have the 
Turkish side agree fails. At the same time, Mr. Kasoulidhis 
said that the government has made it clear since last year that 
it is prepared to proceed with talks on the substance of the 
Cyprus issue by using Butrus-Ghali's set of ideas.

  [Text] A visa waiver agreement covering diplomatic and 
special passports was signed between Turkey and Ukraine today. 
Ukrainian Foreign Minister Anatoliy Zlenko arrived on a one-day 
official visit in Turkey today. The visiting minister first met 
with Foreign Minister Hikmet Cetin. A visa waiver agreement 
covering diplomatic and special passports was signed after the 
meeting. The agreement was signed by Cetin and Zlenko. 
  The disarmament of the Black Sea, matters pertaining to oil 
and natural gas, and President Suleyman Demirel's upcoming visit 
to Ukraine in May were among the issues discussed during the 
meeting, Cetin explained. Cetin announced that agreement was 
reached for Turkey to open consulates in Crimea and Odessa and 
for Ukraine to open a consulate in Istanbul. Zlenko, in turn, 
said that the visa waiver agreement will create an atmosphere of 
trust and sincerity between the two countries. 
  Zlenko and the delegation accompanying him were later 
received by Demirel. According to a statement issued by the 
President's Press Center, the visiting minister relayed to 
Demirel a message from Ukrainian President Kravchuk and noted 
that his government will be pleased to see Demirel in Ukraine 
next month. Demirel also said that he will be pleased to visit 
Ukraine. During the meeting, the president expressed Turkey's 
readiness to help Ukraine in returning the Crimean Tartars to 
their homeland. Views were also exchanged during the meeting on 
regional and international issues concerning the two countries, 
and Demirel announced that the necessary political will exists 
for the development of relations with Ukraine.

  [Text] Brussels, April 8 (AFP) -- Belgium was sending a 
Boeing 737 to the Burundi capital of Bujumbura to prepare for a 
possible evacuation of civilians from Rwanda, Communications 
Minister Elio Di Rupo said here Friday [8 April]. 
  He said plans had been made for the 150-seat aircraft to fly 
civilians from the Rwandan capital of Kigali to Bujumbura, 
provided that a safety zone could be established 20 kilometres 
(12.5 miles) around Kigali airport. 
  The Belgian cabinet was due to meet here around 1300 GMT to 
decide whether to evacuate Belgian civilians from Rwanda, what 
troops to provide for the operation and how to coordinate the 
operation with the United Nations. 
  Di Rupo said a flight crew of the Belgian airline Sabena was 
already in Kigali, and that the captain and first officer had 
been slightly injured when the Sabena-owned hotel there came 
under machine-gun fire. 
  He added that a Sabena DC-10 aircraft was being sent to the 
Ugandan capital of Entebbe to increase the evacuation capability.

  [Text] We have just heard that, according to a Belgian 
Foreign Ministry spokesman, there are no plans to evacuate 
Belgian nationals from Rwanda. Belgian Foreign Minister Willy 
Claes who is currently visiting Romania is staying abreast of 
the situation in Rwanda. He would like the UN mission in Rwanda 
to be stepped up. When we spoke to him a while ago, he 
confirmed to us that there were not any Belgian casualties: 
  [Begin recording] [Claes] Our ambassador has confirmed that, 
for now at any rate, our compatriots are not in any danger 
either in the capital or elsewhere in the country, where things 
appear to be calm. 
  Nevertheless, I must add that regarding our peacekeeping 
forces, who number some 480, everything is in order, although 
our blue helmets, who are responsible for the protection of the 
airport, are staying in the airport. They are not taking the 
risk of returning to their barracks. I would say that 
everything is calm for the moment concerning our compatriots. 
  [Unidentified correspondent] Have you taken measures for a 
possible evacuation? 
  [Claes] Absolutely: We have set up a crisis unit at the 
department in Brussels. It will stay on alert over the weekend. 
All our embassies in neighboring countries are on standby, 
everyone is ready. 
  [Correspondent] Will our Belgian UN forces take part in such 
an operation? 
  [Claes] Not as things stand at the moment. You know that the 
UN mandate is extremely limited, but it is quite clear that we 
cannot accept that, even though the Belgian soldiers are under 
Canadian, UN command, they should stand passively by if any of 
our compatriots were in difficulty. We are taking steps in New 
York and in Washington to see, if it became necessary, if we 
could obtain the immediate go-ahead for our blue helmets to play 
a more active role. [end recording]

  [Excerpts] BUJUMBURA, April 8 (AFP) - Ethnic bloodletting 
in the Rwandan capital continued on Friday [8 April] following 
the death of the president in a plane crash and killing of the 
prime minister, a Kigali journalist said Friday. [passage 
omitted] 
  A Belgian government official in Brussels confirmed the 
fighting in Kigali between the the Rwandan Patriotic Front and 
army troops. 
  He said the Belgian cabinet would probably meet later Friday 
to decide whether to evacuate Belgian civilians from Rwanda, 
what troops to provide for the operation and how to coordinate 
the operation with the United Nations. 
  The official, who asked not to be identified, said: "It is 
difficult to assess the scale of the fighting. Nobody can leave 
their homes to find out what is going on." 
  He said the timing of the Belgian cabinet meeting would 
depend on the return here of Belgian Prime Minister Jean-Luc 
Dehaene from vacation in Malta and Foreign Minister Willy Claes 
from an official visit to Romania. 
  Ten Belgian UN peacekeepers were executed in Kigali on 
Thursday after trying to protect Rwandan Prime Minister Agathe 
Uwilingiyimana from elements of the Rwandan presidential guard, 
their commander, Colonel Luc Marchal, said. 
  The prime minister was assassinated. There are between 400 
and 500 Belgians in the 2,500-strong United Nations force in 
Rwanda.

  [Excerpt] The first news of the morning in Kigali has just 
reached us. To sum up, there is no change. The fighting is 
continuing in the streets of the Rwandan capital. Press 
correspondents on the spot report, I quote, that fighting is 
raging and that UN officials fear that Hutu-Tutsi clashes may 
spread beyond the capital. There is also confirmation of the 
involvement of the Rwandan opposition in these hostilities. 
Yesterday the troops of the Rwandan Patriotic Front left the 
location where they were taking cover and are involved in 
exchanges of fire with the regular army troops. The toll of the 
clashes is particularly high, according to a UN official. In 
Kigali, fires are raging at certain points, and hand-to-hand 
fighting has been witnessed on the streets of the capital. 
  In Brussels, a first review of the situation was carried out 
yesterday evening and continued into the early hours of the 
night. At midday or perhaps early this afternoon, the government 
is going to resume its review of the situation in the presence 
of Prime Minister Jean-Luc Dehaene, who has returned from 
abroad. Foreign Minister Willy Claes will return later today. 
Any decision concerning evacuation that might have to be made 
will probably be announced in the afternoon. In any case, since 
yesterday, paracommando troops have been preparing for every 
eventuality. There appears to be a general mobilization this 
morning in the Belgian paratroop camp, and the paratroopers of 
Flawinne barracks were recalled very early this morning. The 
situation is exactly the same at Stokkem barracks, where the 
soldiers have also been recalled. [passage omitted]

  [Excerpt] Our country is keeping two batallions of 
paracommandos standing by for a possible evacuation of our 
fellow countrymen in Rwanda in Africa. The BELGA news agency 
learned this from government circles. Some 800 paracommandos 
were put on standby as early as yesterday evening. They are 
standing by to evacuate the 1,500 Belgians in Rwanda and if 
necessary, also other foreigners, should the Belgian Government 
so decide. The Cabinet reconvenes at 1500 hours [1400 GMT] to 
discuss the situation in Rwanda. It will decide whether an 
evacuation will be launched. 
  At the military airport of Melsbroek, security has been put 
on standby. However, the men have received the direct command 
to say nothing. 
  France, too, is said to be considering deploying its troops 
in the central African republic for a possible evacuation of its 
fellow countrymen, but for the time being, no decision has been 
made. There are some 600 French in Rwanda, most of them living 
in Kigali. [passage omitted]

  [Excerpt] Brussels, April 8 (AFP) -- Belgium confirmed 
Friday [8 April] that 10 Belgian UN troops were executed at a 
Rwandan military barracks in the unrest that erupted in the 
capital Kigali after the country's president was killed in a 
plane crash. 
  A Defense Ministry spokesman said the troops, who were 
killed 
Thursday, had been assigned to guard Rwanda's prime minister, 
who was assassinated by Rwandan security forces in the upheaval. 
  Their commander, interviewed from Kigali by Belgian radio, 
said the Belgian soldiers were "mistreated" by Rwandan troops 
before they were killed. 
  "These soldiers were in charge of security for Rwandan Prime 
Minister Agathe Uwilingiyimana, whose home was surrounded by 
Rwandan soldiers. She tried to flee. Our soldiers were 
apprehended while they tried to help clear the way for her," the 
Defense Ministry statement said. 
  "The Belgian soldiers were disarmed, then taken to a 
military 
camp in Kigali where they were executed," it said. 
  Their commander, Colonel Luc Marchal, told the radio their 
bodies were now in Kigali hospital and that they would be 
transferred Friday to the UN mission hospital there before being 
repatriated. 
  They all belonged to the 2d Commando Battalion from Flawinne 
in southeast Belgium. 
  Marchal also said there had been violent fighting Thursday 
between different groups in the Rwandan military. 
  He said part of a battalion of the former rebel Rwandan 
Patriotic Front in Kigali "made an incursion in the camp of the 
presidential guard who was guilty of these crimes, and seriously 
cleaned up the presidential guard unit." 
  According to Marchal, "they gave them a lesson and I presume 
the presidential guard or any other unit will not start up this 
sort of thing again." 
  The Rwandan Patriot Front, largely made up of the Tutsi 
minority, had opposed Habyarimana, who comes from the Hutu 
majority that has long dominated Rwandan politics. They were to 
be brought into a transitional government under a peace pact 
signed last August to end three years of civil war. [passage

  [Text] Brussels, April 8 (AFP) -- Rwandan employees of aid 
organisations in Kigali have been murdered by Rwandan troops, 
while at least 22 Rwandan missionary priests and nuns have been 
killed amid the ethnic violence, sources said Friday [8 April]. 
  In Brussels, a director of the humanitarian organisation 
Medecins sans Frontieres-Belgium [MSF--Doctors Without Borders], 
Georges Dallemagne, said in a statement that "several dozen" 
Rwandan employees of the aid workers had been killed by members 
of the presidential guard drawn from the majority ethnic Hutus. 
  Dallemagne said the victims were slain in front of their 
expatriate employers. 
  But MSF official Dominique Bontriau said later it was 
impossible to estimate how many workers had been killed. "It is 
chaotic," she said, but could not confirm that they numbered 
several dozen. 
  She said Dallemagne had been misquoted as saying there were 
several dozen victims. 
  Meanwhile, church officials in Kigali, contacted by 
telephone 
from Paris, said that at least 22 missionary priests and nuns 
have been killed in Rwanda since the clashes began there 
Thursday following the plane crash death of the Rwandan and 
Burundian presidents. 
  Six priests and nine nuns were killed in Kigali itself and 
six priests and a nun in the town of Nyundo, in the northwest 
province of Gisenyi, the official at the papal nuncio's office 
said. 
  The church official, who refused to be identified, said the 
Kigali parishes were "full of people seeking shelter." 
  The sound of light and heavy gunfire could be heard in the 
town and streets were deserted, he said. 
  "The situation is becoming explosive, there is much 
confusion," he said. 
  He added that UN troops in the capital were keeping to 
barracks following the death of 10 UN Belgian soldiers on 
Thursday.

<F P=106> [Article by Karl van den Broeck: "Budget for Humanitarian </F>
Operations Reduced -- 1.7 Billion in 1994 to Just 1 Billion in 
1995"] 
  [Text] Belgian Defense Minister Leo Delcroix of the CVP 
[Flemish Christian People's Party] is keeping his hand on the 
purse strings. He believes that the cost of humanitarian 
operations is too high. By the end of 1994, the Belgian UN 
troops in Yugoslavia and Rwanda will have cost him 1.7 billion 
Belgian francs. In 1995, the Defense Ministry intends to 
earmark just 1 billion Belgian frnacs for such expenditure. Any 
extra costs will have to be found from "other sources." In the 
meantime, the sale of army equipment is going well. 
  Although the cabinet may have already decided last Friday [1 
April] to prolong humanitarian operations in Croatia and Bosnia, 
Minister Delcroix firmly intends not to allow his budget to be 
derailed by the international commitments of the Belgian Army. 
DE MORGEN learned yesterday from the minister that in 1995 just 
1 billion Belgian francs will be set aside for financing the 
activities of UN troops. 
  "In 1994, we will end up spending 1.7 billion Belgian 
francs," said his spokesman. "The cost of the operation in 
Rwanda will be 613 million Belgian francs. The commitment in 
the former Yugoslavia (Belbat, Bosnia Road) will amount to 1 
billion." As the argument goes: "If the government were now to 
comply with a possible request by the United nations to make an 
additional effort, then the money would have to come from 
`elsewhere.'" In the past, the costs of foreign contracts were 
often shared by the Defense Ministry and the Development Aid 
Ministry, or the European Union offered a financial helping hand 
(e.g. in Somalia). It would appear that in the long term, 
Delcroix only wishes to remain active in the former Yugoslavia. 
One billion Belgian francs per annum is not enough to keep the 
1,000 permanent troops in the field. The mission in Rwanda is 
due to end in November 1994. Meanwhile, Bosnia Road, the mission 
involving army engineers in the region around Sarajevo, was 
extended Friday until October 1994. 
<H5>  Sales </H5>
  In the meantime, the Defense Ministry has also adjusted the 
estimated revenue generated by selling off army property and 
equipment. At the end of 1993, it was anticipated that such 
sales would total 3.5 billion Belgian francs. The new estimate 
is 4 billion by 1997. 
  Nonetheless, 1993 was a disappointing year. It had been 
hoped that income totaling 600 million Belgian francs might be 
generated, but since the only money coming in was the result of 
sales of light equipment, the actual revenue totaled just 250 
million. 
  However, there is light on the horizon. DE MORGEN has 
learned that the negotiations with Chile on the sale of the 
superfluous Mirages are "promising." A letter of agreement has 
been signed in which Belgium guarantees not to look for another 
buyer before June. Chile has 2.5 billion Belgian francs 
available for the Mirages. 
  Delcroix also seems firm in his intention to sell the Hawk 
missiles to Turkey, despite the strong criticism from Agalev 
[Flemish Environmental Party], the VU [Flemish People's Union], 
and the peace movement. After all, the new law governing arms 
deals prohibits the sale of military equipment to any country 
which is involved in a civil war. 
  "We must not be hypocritical," says Delcroix's spokesman. 
"Turkey is a NATO country. If we ask that country to keep its 
armed forces up to date, thereby helping to guarantee the 
collective security of the alliance, then we cannot refuse to 
supply it with arms. Either we must regard Turkey as no longer 
being a NATO partner or we must behave like a full partner of 
that country. The government certainly has no plans to drop 
Turkey." 
  No information about the price that Turkey is prepared to 
pay 
for the Hawk antiaircraft missiles is currently available. 
  The sale of military properties should also accelerate in 
the 
coming months. Some properties will be sold by public auction, 
others privately. "That depends on the Finance Ministry. We, 
at the Defense Ministry, are not allowed to dispose of our 
property ourselves." 
  Could the proceeds from such sales not be used to boost the 
budget allocated for humanitarian uses? 
  "No," said the spokesman, "it was already decided previously 
that the 4 billion Belgian francs generated by the sales would 
not be used to fund personnel or operations. The armed forces 
still have a very long list of equipment that has to be 
purchased in the context of rearming the Belgian Armed Forces. 
That is our priority if we want to ensure that our armed forces 
remain ready for action in the future." 
  "The proceeds of the sale of military equipment will be used 
to this end. The revenue generated by sales of the real 
property will go toward modernizing the remaining barracks."

<F P=106> [Unattributed article: "Four Belgian Sappers Leave for </F>
Cambodia"] 
  [Text] Leuven -- During the Easter weekend four Belgian 
military sappers left for Cambodia. They will spend six months 
there to train some 1,000 local soldiers in mine detection and 
neutralization. The initiative is taking place with the 
Development Cooperation Ministry, which is contributing 7.8 
million Belgian francs and the United Nations Development 
Program, which manages the Cambodia Mine Action Center. The 
mine clearance unit of the army will supply three instructors 
and the navy will supply one. 
  The intervention by the Belgian soldiers is not without 
danger. Although the civil war has stabilized in Cambodia, 
individual actions by members of the Khmer Rouge are still 
reported. The instructors will work in the northwest of the 
country, the area which saw the most intense fighting during the 
war. In addition, during the first phase, the mine clearance 
activities will be accompanied on location. It is estimated 
that there are still 4 million mines in Cambodia. 
  It is the first time that the mine clearance department of 
the Belgian Army has carried out an overseas mission of this 
nature. However, army mine clearance specialists have been 
active in Croatia, Bosnia-Herzegovina, Somalia and Rwanda since 
1992. But these teams were responsible for neutralizing 
unexploded devices in order to protect Belgian troops and bases. 
At present, Belgian mine clearance experts are still in Croatia 
and Rwanda. The support provided by the Development Cooperation 
Ministry is based upon the assumption that mine clearance in 
Cambodia is an essential pre-condition for the country to 
redevelop itself. After all, farming is virtually impossible 
while the countryside is full of mines. It is reported that one 
Cambodian out of 236 has already lost one or several limbs. 
Every month, mines are still killing or wounding another 200 or 
300 people in the country. Of a surface area of 10,000 sq km in 
Cambodia containing mines, only 4.5 km have been cleared.

<F P=106> [Commentary by Bart Sturtewagen: "Collective Weakness"] </F>
  [Text] Financial markets are perverse. If companies close 
factories and make their people unemployed, they are rewarded 
with a higher share price. If the economic cycle picks up and 
more people find a job, investors throw their shares into the 
market in panic so that prices drop. 
  Such mechanisms give outsiders the impression of 
irrationality. That is wrong. Everything is a question of 
timing. All those seeking to acquire (additional) income 
through investment must dare to look to the future. If they do 
not do so, then other people will get there before them and the 
chance of profit will have gone. 
  In recent years, the way markets run ahead of events has 
accelerated and the intensity of market reactions has increased. 
In part that is because the speculative element was given an 
enormous lever by the development of indirect financial 
techniques like options and futures. 
  The reason why the long-term interest rate has climbed so 
strongly on both sides of the Atlantic Ocean in the last two 
months is that dealers with money borrowed over the short term 
are the main players for the moment. They are moving capital as 
if the financial world was a village. The differences in the 
underlying real economies do not interest them. 
  The justified increase in U.S. short-term interest rates, as 
a weapon against a rise in inflation, made speculation more 
expensive and had a destructive effect on the bond markets, 
including in Belgium, although the economic cycle is still in a 
far weaker phase here. 
  For that reason, most specialists think that the interest 
rise in Europe is temporary. Investors with a long-term vision 
can calmly wait to be proved right. The Belgian Government, 
which has made itself totally dependent on the mood of the 
financial markets, cannot do that. 
  For the federal government, the drop in interest rates in 
1993 came as a blessing. It hopes to be able to continue to 
quench its thirst at this source this year as well. The savings 
they have made so far by refinancing loans more cheaply have 
been greater than the lost income as a result of the poor 
economic cycle. The unbridled accumulation of debt in the past 
also had its advantages. 
  But it is unwise to allow oneself to be intoxicated by the 
drug of cheap money and, with an eye on the elections, postpone 
necessary actions. The recent events on the bond markets show 
how fragile interest forecasts are. 
  At the start of this year, the Treasury's agenda included a 
debt mountain to be financed of 1.2 billion Belgian francs. 
That is 120 million 10,000-Belgian franc notes. Three-quarters 
of that work has already been completed. Finance Minister 
Philippe Maystadt got nearly 200 billion Belgian francs last 
month from long-suffering private investors. 
  The interest rate on the bonds which are still to be 
replaced 
is an average 9 percent. So a profit can still be made with a 
market interest rate of slightly over 7 percent. But if the 
investors realize that the interest rate trend has turned, then 
they will keep their hands on the pursestrings. They will no 
longer invest their hard-earned pennies over the long term and 
calmly wait until the conditions have become more attractive. 
  The hasty refinancing of a large share of state debt could 
only happen because the most important market players, the 
Belgian financial institutions, did not put up any obstacles. 
But their market specialists still punish mercilessly players 
who show their cards. 
  The following iron rule applies here: Anyone who owes the 
bank 1 million is in its debt. Anyone who owes the bank 100 
million has the bank in his power. The fact that the extension 
of our debt got smoothly to this point is more a sign of our 
collective weakness than individual strength.

  [Text] Paris, April 11 (AFP) -- France called Monday [11 
April] for an urgent relaunching of the Bosnia peace process as 
weekend NATO air strikes against Bosnian Serbs besieging the 
UN-protected Goradze enclave met with a chorus of approval from 
Western states. 
  Speaking on the Europe 1 radio station, Foreign Minister 
Alain Juppe said: "What worries me is that the diplomatic 
process is stalling. What I want, and it is relatively urgent, 
is for the diplomatic process to be reintegrated into a coherent 
format. 
  ``A (peace) plan exists, the European Union's,'' he said, 
refering to a plan for the division of Bosnia-Herzegovina into 
three mini-states and a conditional and phased lifting of 
sanctions against Serbia, accused of backing Bosnian Serb forces. 
  Juppe said negotiations should "resume on that basis and I 
invite all parties, including the Serbs. The only possible 
solution (to the war) is (to be found) around the negotiating 
table." The French minister is due to hold talks later Monday 
with Yasushi Akashi, the UN special representative in Bosnia, a 
Foreign Ministry spokesman here said. Juppe welcomed Sunday's 
strikes by two U.S. F-16s, but said "they were delayed a bit too 
long." 
  In Bonn, German Foreign Minister Klaus Kinkel said the 
action 
by North Atlantic Treaty Organisation fighter-bombers was 
"justified, necessary and proper. Gorazde is a particularly 
dramatic case, it is right and proper that this action took 
place," Kinkel told public service WDR radio. "I hope that the 
(Bosnian) Serbs will finally understand, or else NATO could be 
forced to intervene again," he warned, adding that the Moslem 
enclave in eastern Bosnia was a "new important symbol after 
Sarajevo." 
  Swedish Foreign Minister Margaretha af Ugglas said she was 
"pleased that NATO planes have now intervened to stop the Serb 
invasion of Gorazde and protect the civilians and UN personnel 
in the area." But she was critical of the United Nations' 
recent inaction in the region, saying more decisive action 
"could have been displayed earlier." 
  The Netherlands also expressed support for the action in a 
statement released in The Hague by the Foreign Ministry. 
  Earlier Russian President Boris Yeltsin called for the UN 
Security Council to discuss the NATO air strikes against the 
Serbs and said Russia must be consulted prior to such attacks, 
the ITAR-TASS news agency said. 
  "I insisted and I insist that such questions as shelling of 
Serb positions cannot be decided without talks beforehand 
between Russia and the United States," ITAR-TASS news agency 
quoted Yeltsin as saying prior to his departure for a visit to 
Spain. 
  Kinkel meanwhile called on Russia to use its influence with 
the Serbs to halt the offensive on Gorazde, which occupies a 
strategic site on the road from Belgrade to the self-styled 
Bosnian Serb capital of Pale. 
  The Serbs on Monday announced they were suspending all 
contacts with the UN Protection Force [UNPROFOR] in protest at 
the air strikes.

  [Text] Ancona, Italy, April 11 (AFP) -- The UNHCR on 
Monday [11 April] suspended its airlift between the Italian Air 
Force base at Ancona to the Bosnian capital Sarajevo, a 
spokeswoman for the UN aid agency said here. 
  Speaking at Ancona airport, Antonella Gesulfo from the 
office 
of the UN High Commissioner for Refugees, said the organisation 
was awaiting "the next developments" before deciding whether or 
not to resume the airlift. 
  The decision follow's Sunday's airstrikes by two U.S. F-16 
fighters against Bosnian Serb forces attacking the UN-protected 
Moslem enclave of Goradze in eastern Bosnia-Hercegovina. 
  In Geneva, UNHCR spokesman Ron Redmond said the 20 flights 
planned for Monday as a "precaution," adding that "Tuesday we 
will reassess the situation." [sentence as received] 
  The decision was taken by the UNHCR and the UN Protection 
Force in Bosnia, and representatives of the six countries -- 
Britain, France, Germany, Italy, the Netherlands, Sweden and the 
United States -- operating the air bridge. 
  A Canadian C-130 aircraft which was being used to airlift 
injured Bosnians out of Bosnia has left for East Africa to take 
part in the evacuation of foreigners from Rwanda.

  [Text] Belgium and France have decided to clarify the 
situation. Brussels and Paris are saying that it is out of the 
question to do anything other than protect foreign nationals. 
Listen to this reaction to events in Rwanda from Blaise 
Compaore, the president of Burkina Faso. He is currently in 
France: 
  [Begin Compaore recording] We felt a lot of pain when we 
heard the news because we believe that the Rwandan people do not 
deserve this. However, we can see that Africa, unfortunately, 
is going to go through many other tests before it achieves its 
democratization, because we have historic limits which prevent 
us from going forward at the rate hoped for by the people and 
even by the international community, but we trust that the 
Africans will manage to establish their nations and, of course, 
to preserve their freedoms. This, of course, will have to be 
with the support of the international community. [end recording]

  [Text] Paris, April 9 (AFP) -- Western governments joined 
forces Saturday [9 April] to prepare an operation to evacuate 
around 3,000 of their nationals from Rwanda. 
  According to information to hand, there are 1,500 Belgians, 
600 French, 350 Germans, about 100 Britons, 255 Americans, 198 
Italians, 200 Canadians, 175 Swiss, 135 Spaniards and some 100 
Dutch nationals in the former Belgian colony. Several countries 
began arrangements to airlift their citizens from the 
crisis-ridden country on Saturday. 
  Two hundred and eighty French paratroopers arrived from 
bases 
in the Central African Republic early on Saturday morning and 
took control of the airport at the Rwandan capital, Kigali. 
Another 120 troops and a medical contingent are due to arrive 
towards close of day, bringing the total French military 
presence in Rwanda to 400. 
  In addition, 330 U.S. Marines belonging to a force stationed 
off the coast of Somalia arrived in the Burundian capital 
Bujumbura on Saturday, while two Belgian C-130 Hercules 
transport planes took off from military bases near Brussels to 
take part in the evacuation. 
  Belgian paratroopers were due to leave Brussels at Saturday 
afternoon and make a stopover at Nairobi before flying on to 
Kigali. 
  Some 2,400 men from 24 countries are already serving as part 
of a UN peacekeeping force in Rwanda. They were sent after an 
October 1993 Security Council resolution to oversee the run-up 
to general elections scheduled for 1995.

  [Text] Geneva, April 8 (AFP) -- Talks on the deployment of 
a peacekeeping force for the separatist Georgian region of 
Abkhazia have been postponed until next Tuesday [12 April], UN 
spokeswoman Therese Gastaut said. 
  The talks, scheduled to have started Friday, follow a 
ceasefire signed Monday by Georgia and Abkhazian separatists 
which allows for multinational peacekeeping force to be sent to 
the breakaway republic in northwest Georgia. 
  The meeting, to be headed by Butrus-Ghali's special 
representative Eduard Brunner, is to deal only with military 
aspects of the agreement such as the number and deployment of 
the maximum 2,500 troops. 
  The trickier question of Abkhazia's status will be discussed 
in Geneva on April 19 at a meeting of the two sides, Russian and 
UN facilitators and members of the Conference on Security and 
Cooperation in Europe, the spokeswoman said. 
  Last week's ceasefire agreement aimed to help the return of 
some 250,000 Georgian civilians who have fled the area in more 
than a year of war, and holds out the possibility of 
far-reaching autonomy for Abkhazia within Georgia. 
  Talks on the return of refugees began Friday in Sochi in 
Russia, presided over by Russia and the UN High Commission for 
Refugees [UNHCR], Gastaut said. 
  On Thursday, the two sides accused each other of violating 
the ceasefire which had been signed in the presence of UN 
Secretary General Butrus Butrus-Ghali and Russian Foreign 
Minister Andrey Kozyrev.

  [Excerpt] Vienna, April 9 (AFP) -- Austria has asked 
France, Belgium and Germany to evacuate if necessary 15 
Austrians living in the strife-torn Rwandan capital, Kigali, the 
Foreign Ministry said Saturday [9 April]. 
  The Austrian civilians would be flown out of the country, 
where savage ethnic fighting has left at least 1,000 dead in the 
last three days, along with citizens of the three other 
countries, under the protection of French and Belgian troops. 
  Austria also has some 40 nationals serving with United 
Nations peacekeeping troops deployed in Rwanda as part of a 
transition scheme ahead of elections planned for next year.

<F P=106> [Report signed "ps": "FPOe: No to EU, but No Recommendation </F>
for Referendum"] 
  [Excerpt] At the Freedom Party of Austria's [FPOe] special 
congress, European Union [EU] membership was clearly rejected. 
The FPOe will, however, not give a recommendation to voters for 
the EU referendum to take place in June. 
  After week-long discussions, the FPOe has finally taken a 
position on Austrian EU membership: On Friday evening [8 April] 
at the special party congress in Villach, 85.5 percent of the 
463 delegates supported FPOe Chairman Haider's proposal. 
  This proposal recommends that the FPOe parliamentary group 
oppose both the EU membership agreement and the amendments to 
the constitution that will be necessary for EU membership. The 
second central point of the vote at the party congress: The 
FPOe will not give voters any recommendation for the EU 
referendum in June. A total of 390 FPOe delegates (85.5 
percent) voted in favor of this position, 66 were against it, 
and seven cast invalid votes. 
  Haider had determined this course in his speech immediately 
before the vote. The FPOe chairman called the results achieved 
by the government in EU membership negotiations "poor, modest, 
and to be rejected." [passage omitted]

  [Excerpt] Vienna -- Austrian People's Party [OeVP] 
Chairman Erhard Busek indicated on Saturday [9 April] that his 
party will not make a recommendation for the European Union [EU] 
referendum on 12 June. In contrast, Karl Krammer, chief of 
Chancellor Franz Vranitzky's cabinet, stated that a party has to 
take a clear position on such an important question. 
  Yesterday, Sunday, the Greens set their "no." The party is 
to make a relevant "recommendation without patronizing" for the 
referendum at the end of April. Yesterday, the extended federal 
executive committee agreed unanimously on this. Federal 
Spokesman Peter Pilz stated that he had submitted the relevant 
motion to the committee. [passage omitted]

<F P=106> [Studio interview with Boudewijn van Spilbeek, VTM foreign </F>
affairs journalist, by announcer Danny Verstraeten--live] 
  [Text] [Verstraeten] Boudewijn Van Spilbeek has joined us, 
welcome, Boudewijn. Boudewijn, how concrete are these 
evacuation plans at this moment? 
  [Van Spilbeek] Well, Danny, maybe it is worth mentioning 
first that for such emergency situations in Zaire, Rwandi, and 
Burundi, there are always evacuation plans readily at hand, 
which can be implemented within a very short period of time, 24 
hours or so. However, the situation now is that the 3d 
Paratroopers Battalion from Tielen and also the 1st Paratroopers 
Battalion from Diest have been called up and they are ready to 
depart right away. 
  [Verstraeten] It is an international action? 
  [Van Spilbeek] Yes, because the French, who have Foreign 
Legion paratroopers in the Central African Republic, which is 
not far from Rwanda, are ready to intervene if necessary. And 
we learned from a very reliable source that concrete measures 
are under way for the French, Belgian, and possible U.S. forces 
to implement an evacuation. 
  [Verstraeten] How will tasks be divided? Who is going to do 
what? 
  [Van Spilbeek] The Belgians would send the 1st or the 3d, or 
maybe both, Paratroopers Batallion. The 1st Para knows the 
situation well because these men returned only a few weeks ago 
from Rwanda, where they had stayed for four months. The French 
would also help in this operation. And the Americans would 
probably provide large transportation planes, and maybe even 
troops. 
  [Verstraeten] Do the Belgians already have aircraft in the 
area? 
  [Van Spilbeek] Yes. There is already one Sabena aircraft in 
Bujumbura in Burundi. Furthermore, this evening, there will be 
the regular Bujumbura-Kigali flight, and there is already one 
C-130 in Nairobi and, in addition, there is also one C-130 at 
the airport of Kigali itself. 
  [Verstraeten] Yes, but this airport, and this may constitute 
one of the practical problems, what is the situation at Kigali 
airport? 
  [Van Spilbeek] Yes, this is a key problem. Rwanda is located 
in the middle of Africa, so an evacuation has to proceed from 
the airport. A company of Belgian blue helmets was there to 
guard the airport, but it was armed with very light weapons only 
and lost the airport to the the Rwandan Army. This means that 
the airport is currently unsafe. Moreover, the Rwandan Army has 
proved that it is quite capable of downing aircraft since, two 
days ago, it downed its own president. 
  [Verstraeten] So what are the solutions, what can they do? 
  [Van Spilbeek] There are two possibilities: Either they 
could be diverted to another airport, but this would imply 
several hours by truck or jeep to get to Kigali, and this could 
increase danger for the people in the capital; or, the second 
possibility could be, as was done in 1978 in Kolwezi in the 
Zaire Shaba province, just to drop the men. After all, they are 
paratroopers. 
  [Verstraeten] They are now waiting for the go-ahead by the 
ministers? 
  [Van Spilbeek] Yes, indeed. Such an operation requires quite 
some coordination, with Paris and with Washington. Obviously, 
the Council of Ministers has to be informed about everything and 
agree with it. So, the decision will problably be made this 
afternoon at 0300 hours [0100 GMT] 
  [Verstraeten] Thank you, Boudewijn.

  [Text] In Rwanda the first Belgian paratroops have landed 
at Kigali airport. Thus, the green light has been given for the 
evacuation of our fellow countrymen from Rwanda. At 1645 hours 
a first C-130 plane landed in Kigali. An hour later four more 
planes followed. 
  Just now a news conference was held in Evere with Defense 
Minister Delcroix. Together with Chief of Staff Charlier, he 
explained the progress of the evacuation. Delcroix also paid 
homage to the 10 Belgian blue helmets who were killed by Rwandan 
soldiers. 
  Here is a report by Bruno Huyghebaert: 
  [Huyghebaert] Operation Silverback is the codename under 
which the Defense Ministry and Army have conceived the 
evacuation operation from Rwanda. Initially the intention was 
to land in Kigali early this morning between 0300 and 0600 
hours, Minister Delcroix said. But Rwandan troops had blocked 
the airport. Then, in cooperation with the French and the 
United Nations, we had to negotiate until this afternoon in 
order to be able to begin the evacuation. The intervention 
unit of the paracommandoes was meanwhile in the Kenyan capital, 
Nairobi. Chief of Staff Charlier said that 250 paracommandos 
landed in Kigali this evening with the necessary support 
equipment. They will take refugees to Kigali airport where, if 
necessary, they will be provided with medical assistance and be 
evacuated on to Belgium via Nairobi. The entire operation is 
proceeding with French, U.S., Dutch, and Italian assistance. 
The names of the refugees will be circulated by the foreign 
affairs ministry via the media. The first refugees will be 
arriving at 0230 hours at Melsbroek military airport from 
Bujumbura in Burundi where they had gone under their own steam. 
  Minister Delcroix also paid homage to the 10 Belgian blue 
helmets who were murdered in a cowardly fashion in Kigali. 
Meanwhile, their bodies have been flown from Kigali to Nairobi 
by a C-130. Bruno Huyghebaert, Evere.

  [Text] More and more countries are joining in a possible 
evacuation. A Dutch Foreign Ministry spokesman has advised that 
Dutch nationals wanting to leave Rwanda can join the evacuation 
of the Belgians. So the Dutch are talking about a real 
evacuation operation involving the collection of foreigners from 
Rwanda, whereas our government is speaking of a mission to 
protect our compatriots. Some 100 Dutch nationals live in 
Rwanda with 30 of them residing in Kigali. 
  The Dutch Air Force sent a 230 plane [not further 
identified] 
to Rwanda this morning to help with the evacuation. This 
happened in consultation with the Belgian Government. The 
transport plane took off from Melsbroek with a mixed 
Dutch-Belgian crew. 
  Germany, too, is preparing an evacuation operation. The 
German Foreign Ministry says that this will happen in 
cooperation with the Belgians and the French.

  [Text] In Rwanda, Kigali Airport has been opened and, in 
principle, Belgian planes should be able to land there. They 
have obtained the authorization to land from the Rwandan 
authorities. Belgian Foreign Minister Willy Claes, however, has 
dampened the optimism: 
  [Begin recording] [Claes] Listen, we have received the 
authorization from the new government, but as concerns the 
operation on the ground, it is the military command which will 
decide. I cannot give you more ample details. 
  [Unidentified correspondent] Is this authorization serious 
and reliable? 
  [Claes] Well, I could not tell you that we had the 
authorization if we had not taken all possible precautions. We 
still have a slight reservation: I cannot give you a 100 
percent guarantee that the Rwandan troops at the airport are 
obeying the authorities, but I am still quite confident. 
  [Correspondent] Was a parachute landing ever considered? 
  [Claes] No, absolutely not. 
  [Correspondent] So you will only land in a specific 
operation? 
  [Claes] Yes. [end recording] 
  Willy Claes is therefore dampening the hope that all Belgian 
nationals will rapidly be evacuated from Kigali. We will judge 
on the spot, he said, when the first Belgian planes approach the 
runway to land. Willy Claes also said that it has not been 
ruled out that some Belgians should be evacuated in other 
planes, French or American, in the context of a coordinated 
operation, and taken to Nairobi and Bujumbura, where they would 
then be taken over by Belgian soldiers. Willy Claes refused to 
give any more details on the operation, but added that only 
those who wish to leave would be evacuated. Those who remain 
will do so at their own risk.

  [Text] The Belgian foreign affairs minister has confirmed 
that there have been Belgian civilian victims in the clashes in 
Rwanda: Three Belgian civilians were killed on 7 April. This 
was learned only today: The precise circumstances of their death 
are not yet known. 
  Following on from these serious disturbances in Rwanda, and 
in particular in Kigali, people sometimes wonder about the role 
of the Belgian troops who have been there for several months as 
part of the UN peacekeeping forces, as soldiers of UNAMIR [UN 
Assistance Mission in Rwanda]. But, like all UN troops, these 
Belgian soldiers have a very strict mandate from the United 
Nations. On television this lunchtime in the (Mise au Point), 
Foreign Minister Willy Claes stressed once again the extension 
of the mandate of the UN forces in Rwanda: 
  [Begin Claes recording] I believe that we really were not 
wrong when we sent the troops. We were one of those promoting 
the peace process, and we have to back it up now. As far as I 
am concerned, I think the mandate was too restricted, and we 
need a thorough debate on the UN mandate, and therefore, on the 
implementation of this over restrictive mandate. Also, the 
weaponry was insufficient. [end recording]

  [Text] The Belgian Army has so far not been able to 
intervene to evacuate its 2,000 nationals. The Rwandan 
presidential guard did not want planes to land in Kigali 
airport. An agreement with the authorities was finally reached. 
A first aircraft belonging to the Belgian Army landed in Kigali 
this afternoon. However, resentment against the Belgians is 
still very strong within the Rwandan Army. We know that 14 
Belgians, including 10 UN soldiers, were killed. Belgian Foreign 
Minister Willy Claes condemns this attitude: 
  [Begin Claes recording] Of course, I regret it bitterly 
because the one country that has been making significant efforts 
for the benefit of Rwanda for years is Belgium. One cannot 
forget that we used to be at the top of the charts of countries 
cooperating with Rwanda. This is really a punishment we do not 
deserve at all. This applies to the Hutu extremists. 
Apparently, we have never been forgiven for withdrawing our 
troops after four weeks (?when there were) irregularities, and 
-- this is probably more significant -- we have never been 
forgiven for playing a relatively important role in the peace 
process where we always took a very objective, a very neutral 
attitude. We told those political parties that were part of the 
government and the so-called Patriotic Front rebels that there 
was only one solution -- namely respect of the agreements, of 
human rights, and giving priority to the socio-economic 
situation of the population. Apparently, this was not to 
everybody's taste. [end recording]

  [Text] The foreign ministers of Belgium and Romania have 
signed a joint political declaration. The two foreign ministers 
have tackled the prospects of the Partnership for Peace program, 
bilateral cooperation, and Romania's ties with the European 
Union. The Belgian minister, Mr. Claes, underlined the necessity 
for Romania to extend its initiatives for closer cooperation 
with the European Union. 
  Mr. Claes has decided to cut short his visit in Romania and 
return to Belgium to examine the situation in Rwanda where 
Belgian blue helmets have been killed. Romanian Foreign 
Minister Teodor Melescanu has said that among the Belgian blue 
helmets deployed under UN aegis in Rwanda there is also a group 
of Romanian observers who are safe.

  [Excerpts] [Announcer] Belgium will take the necessary 
measures to protect its nationals in Rwanda. [passage omitted] 
We have just spoken to Deputy Prime Minister Elio di Rupo: 
  [Begin recording] [Di Rupo] First of all, I would like to 
say 
that we are more than indignant: We are shocked by what 
happened, and our thoughts go to the families. [passage 
omitted] Concerning concrete action, there are two types of 
action. First of all, in the name of the government, the prime 
minister and the foreign minister have asked the UN secretary 
general to reinforce the security of our peacekeeping forces on 
the ground. The secretary general has indicated that this 
request will be answered with action. Secondly, we have taken 
the necessary measures to guarantee the security of our 
nationals on the ground. For all those who are concerned, a 
crisis center has been opened, and there is a telephone number 
which is 02-5014000. 
  [Unidentified correspondent] What do you mean exactly by 
reinforcing the security of the blue helmets? Does this mean 
that the nature of their mission will change, or will they be 
receiving reinforcements? 
  [Di Rupo] I could of course answer this question, but please 
understand that if our official statements are rather vague, it 
is because we want to keep all the opportunities on our side to 
ensure that our action can be as effective as possible, and 
especially to ensure that we do not further endanger the lives 
of our nationals. [end recording] 
  [Announcer] The situation of our expatriates, who our holed 
up at home, seems increasingly precarious. According to a 
number of eyewitness reports from Kigali, there have been 
casualties among the foreign community in Kigali, in particular 
among those with a Rwandan husband or wife. [passage omitted]

  [Text] We now have the main points of the communique issued 
by the restricted cabinet meeting convened this afternoon. 
  First, there is an appeal to UN Secretary General Butrus 
Ghali. On behalf of the government, the prime minister and the 
foreign minister reminded the UN secretary general of the urgent 
need to reinforce the safety of the Blue Helmets stationed in 
Rwanda. Mr. Butrus Ghali made remarks to that effect today. 
  The government also expressed its concern for the safety of 
Belgian nationals living in Rwanda. This terse sentence 
follows: The government stresses that it has consequently 
decided on measures needed to guarantee the safety of our 
nationals. No further details are given. These measures can be 
interpreted as the protection of Belgians living in Rwanda and, 
most probably, an operation to evacuate them.

<F P=106> [Report on interview with Eric Derijcke, Belgian state </F>
secretary for development cooperation, by unidentified 
correspondent; place and date not given: "Derycke: `To Pull Out 
Now Is Cowardice'"] 
  [Excerpt] [passage omitted] "We must totally review our 
relations with Rwanda. In fact, we were already doing so but we 
must start again from scratch. And that means bypassing the 
local government. A new government must first prove itself not 
only to Belgium but to all donors, as well as the World Bank and 
the IMF. We must concern ourselves exclusively with the basics: 
building primary schools rather than universities for the 
Tutsis, funds to support farming and basic health care. 
  ``I know people say that all the money we give to Central 
Africa is money wasted. But to withdraw from the region now 
would be cowardice. There are already few enough countries with 
an interest in Central Africa and I am afraid that some of them 
will now pull out." 
  ``There is a danger of the feeling that everything is just a 
waste of time gaining increasing ground among public opinion. 
We must clearly explain why this view is wrong, and that we 
must not give up our development aid on ethnic and political 
grounds, but rather review it. I hope that people give us the 
time to do so. Also, the people who designed the Arusha accord 
should know that they made a serious blunder. And by constantly 
playing for time, [former President] Habyarimana is himself 
responsible for the troubles.''

<F P=106> [Interview with Burundian Interior Minister Leonard Nyangoma </F>
by Colette Braeckman in Brussels; date not given: "The 
Situation in Burundi"] 
  [Text] [Braeckman] What information do you have regarding 
the situation in your country? 
  [Nyangoma] The situation is more serious than in recent 
weeks, when the forces of law and order were not responding to 
the orders issued by the political powers. 
  This time, it is worse still because the commander in chief 
of the army, who was also in the aircraft, was killed, too. Now 
there is really no one left to command our armed forces. 
  [Braeckman] Just a few days ago, you were calling for 
foreign 
intervention. Do you still hold that view? 
  [Nyangoma] More than ever. There is only one way to succeed 
in reassuring everyone in Burundi, by which I mean the 
population, but also, and I insist on this point, the army 
itself. 
  [Braeckman] And what if the army once again refuses to 
intervene? 
  [Nyangoma] It must understand that it is in its own interest 
to do so, because there is a real risk of general confrontation 
among the population. People are still saying that if there is 
civil war, and that is what we risk seeing happen, then there 
will be neither vanquishers nor vanquished. 
  [Braeckman] Have you established any contacts in this 
connection during your visit to Belgium, and, in your capacity 
as interior minister, do you not believe that you should return 
to your country as a matter of urgency? 
  [Nyangoma] No, I am not planning to return before the 
scheduled date. First, I have the means to keep informed about 
the situation, and second I believe that I can make useful 
achievements while abroad as well. As for contacts, it is too 
soon to speak about them, because they have not yet been 
finalized. 
  [Braeckman] Was the Burundian president, who was onboard the 
aircraft of his Rwandan counterpart, the intended target, or did 
he die by chance? 
  [Nyangoma] We will have to wait and see what the results of 
the inquiry are before answering that question. We still do not 
yet know the precise circumstances surrounding the 
assassination. 
  [Braeckman] How will a successor to the late president be 
appointed? 
  [Nyangoma] According to the constitution, the only eligible 
successor is the president of the National Assembly, who will 
take over for a period of three months, after which time a new 
president will be elected by our Parliament. 
  [Braeckman] What is the situation like in Bujumbura, 
according to your sources? 
  [Nyangoma] Clearly, the population is very angry. However, 
for the time being, the situation is calm. The people are aware 
that there is a difference between the assassination of 
President Ndadaye and recent events, where our president was an 
accidental victim. 
  [Braeckman] What are the regional implications of this 
crisis? 
  [Nyangoma] We must fear that there will be fresh waves of 
refugees in neighboring countries. 
  Nonetheless, I would like to formally refute the news 
claiming that a Zairian commando took part in the assassination 
of President Ndadaye. None of those who were on the scene at 
the time of the incident reported this item of information. The 
coup was carried out by the eleventh battalion of paratroop 
commandos, and eyewitnesses gave their assurance that the 
assassins were only Burundians.

  The two surgical teams, one from the Belgian Red Cross and 
the other from the International Committee of the Red Cross were 
to be flown aboard a specially chartered Boeing 707, initially 
to the Red Cross logistical base in Bujumbura, the capital of 
neighbouring Burundi. 
  From there, the teams and medical equipment would be taken 
by 
road to Kigali where four days of ethnic violence between Hutus 
and Tutsis has claimed at least 1,000 lives.

it appears that there are three warring factions in Kigali at 
the moment: The presidential guard avenging the president's

[Rwandan Patriotic Front], which has split up from the CND 
[National Development Coucil] and intervened in the conflict. 
The three parties are firing on each other right now.

  [Text] Brussels, April 8 (AFP) -- A Belgian priest 
described here Friday [8 April] how eight Rwandan priests, nine 
young women on a spiritual retreat and another two Rwandans were 
slain Thursday by Rwandan troops at a Jesuit mission in Kigali. 
  Quoting survivors' eyewitness accounts, Father Fernand Butz 
said Rwandan soldiers had burst into the Christus mission and 
herded all the Rwandans they could find into one room. 
  They locked all the foreigners in the mission's dining room 
some distance away. 
  Among the foreigners were three Belgian Jesuits, three 
Spaniards accompanying the young women during their Kigali trip, 
and an official of the UN High Commissioner for Refugees. 
  When they were let out hours later, they found the 19 bodies 
-- the Rwandan priests and nuns plus the cook and a social 
worker who had been staying temporarily at the mission, Butz 
said. 
  The toll could have been much higher. The Belgian 
religious-oriented Press Information Centre said the nuns and 
sisters of the neighbouring St Vincent mission were not 
disturbed. 
  The agency said this was apparently because they were 
celebrating the eucharist at the time of the massacre and the 
killers did not dare interrupt a religious service. 
  Church officials in Kigali said another six priests and a 
nun 
had been killed at the town of Nyundo, in the northwest province 
of Gisenye, in a wave of violence that started on Wednesday. 
  The victims have included the presidents of Rwanda, Juvenal 
Habyarimana, and of Burundi Cyprien Ntaryamira, killed with 
another 10 people when their aircraft crashed near Kigali, 
reportedly shot down over a military camp. 
  The incident triggered anarchy in Rwanda. Among the victims 
were Rwandan Prime Minister Agathe Uwilingyamana, reportedly 
killed by ethnic Hutus of the Rwandan presidential guard. 
  Ten Belgian members of the 2,500-strong United Nations 
Assistance Mission to Rwanda, who had been guarding her, were 
executed. 
  The Belgian aid organisation Medecins sans Frontieres 
(Doctors without Borders) said Friday that some Rwandan 
employees of foreign aid workers had been slaughtered. 
  There were also reports that the Hutus of the presidential 
guard were killing many Tutsis and burning their homes.

<F P=106> [Report by George Jones and Richard Savill in Belfast: "IRA </F>
Unlikely To Extend Ceasefire"] 
  [Text] Hopes of extending the Provisional IRA's 72-hour 
cease-fire faded last night after Mr John Major rejected calls 
for clarification of the Downing Street declaration and issued a 
"take it or reject it" ultimatum to Sinn Fein. 
  His uncompromising line was made clear in a letter to Mr 
Gerry Adams, the Sinn Fein president, who had asked for direct 
dialogue with the Government on how to move the peace process 
forward. Earlier, Mr Albert Reynolds, the Irish prime minister, 
made a last minute appeal to the IRA to extend the cease-fire, 
which is due to end at midnight tonight. 
  In a statement issued from Cyprus, where he is on holiday, 
he 
said that the strong momentum for peace among ordinary people on 
both sides of the divide made it "essential" that the cease-fire 
was prolonged. 
  But Mr Adams appeared to rule that out. He said that, 
although his party would keep moving the process forward, he 
believed it was "unlikely" that the cease-fire would be extended. 
  Mr Adams had sent two letters to No. 10 Downing Street 
calling for clarification of the Dec 15 Downing Street 
declaration in which Whitehall and Dublin set out an agreed 
framework for a settlement in Northern Ireland. He had blamed 
the "stalemate" in efforts to secure peace on Mr Major's refusal 
to enter talks on the meaning of the document. 
  A letter to Mr Adams from Downing Street, signed by Mr 
Roderic Lyne, the Prime Minister's private secretary denied that 
the Government was to blame. "Any pause in the movement towards 
peace is because of the continuing violence and Sinn Fein's 
failure unequivocally to renounce violence as a means to 
achieving political ends," the letter said. "It is Sinn Fein 
that excludes itself from playing a full part in the political 
process." 
  The letter reaffirmed that, if there were a permanent end to 
violence and if Sinn Fein committed itself to the democratic 
process, the Government would be ready to enter preliminary 
exploratory dialogue with it within three months. 
  "The joint declaration offers the way forward," the letter 
said. "Sinn Fein can take it or reject it. But if violence 
continues, it will only be because Sinn Fein have spurned the 
opportunity to enter the democratic process." 
  Last night Mr Adams described Mr Major's response as 
"evasive 
and wholly inadequate." 
  He said: "This letter is a transparent attempt to evade the 
issues which I raised in my correspondence, and it is a wholly 
inadequate response to the very real opportunity to move the 
peace process forward that currently exists." 
  The IRA's three-day suspension of its activities was 
"unilateral and without condition." Sinn Fein had welcomed it 
as an opportunity to end the present stalemate around the issue 
of clarification. "Unfortunately Mr Major does not share our 
concern to move forward." Mr Adams also published for the first 
time his letter to Mr Major accusing ministers of a "negative 
and dismissive" response to the IRA's "significant initiative." 
  He urged the Prime Minister "to reflect on the seriousness 
of 
the present situation and on the opportunity to move out of the 
present impasse, provided by the IRA. I would again urge you to 
grasp this opportunity to move the peace process forward. You 
can best do so by authorising a meeting with representatives of 
Sinn Fein so that we can receive clarification of the Downing 
Street declaration in the same manner it was provided to other 
particular parties. Your refusal to do so up to now has 
created the present stalemate situation. It is crucial to the 
peace process that this stalemate be ended." 
  A call for the IRA to extend its ceasefire also came from 
the 
Irish foreign minister, Mr Dick Spring, who denounced the 
72-hour suspension as a "pathetically brief respite." 
  He added: "If it is to have any potential, that can be 
realised only be extending it and making it permanent." 
  Addressing a conference in Tralee, Co Kerry, Mr Spring said 
the Irish Government had made great efforts to clarify for Sinn 
Fein and the IRA "any genuine points of perplexity" in the 
Downing Street declaration. 
  Mr Spring said he saw no difficulty in both governments 
"making clear where they stand on any aspect of the declaration." 
  But he said the republican movement must recognise that much 
of the confusion had arisen from its own failure to specify in a 
commonsense way the points it wished to have clarified. 
  "Their failure to do so raises understandable worries that 
their aim is to draw the governments into a world of verbal 
mirrors and shifting goalposts so as to blur the vital 
distinction between politics and violence and to enter political 
negotiations on a basis of armed conflict," he said.

<F P=106> [Report on interviews with two unnamed leading members of </F>
the UDA by Paul Goodman; place and date not given] 
  [Text] The Ulster Defence Association [UDA], Northern 
Ireland's main loyalist paramilitary organisation, has 
threatened to extend its terror campaign to the Republic of 
Ireland. 
  In an interview with THE SUNDAY TELEGRAPH, two leading 
members of the outlawed organisation, which carries out 
sectarian murders against Catholics in Northern Ireland under 
the the title of Ulster Freedom Fighters, also warned that it 
will continue its activities even if the IRA eventually calls a 
permanent ceasefire. 
  The warning, in the wake of the IRA's refusal to extend its 
three-day ceasefire of last week, will deal a further heavy blow 
to John Major's peace initiative. The IRA resumed its campaign 
early yesterday morning shortly after the ceasefire ended, when 
shots were fired at two army checkpoints near Newtownbutler, 
County Fermanagh. 
  The two UDA leaders, who described themselves as the heads 
of 
the UDA's southeast Antrim and south Belfast battalions, also 
confirmed that the UDA has drawn up contingency plans in the 
event of civil war in Northern Ireland, which they believe is 
moving closer, and called for clarification of the Downing 
Street declaration. 
  In what appeared to be a direct threat to members of the 
Irish Government, one of the men said: "There's a price to pay. 
They haven't paid it yet...all their dues are being recorded 
and they'll have to pay up." 
  The Republic, they said, must abandon its constitutional 
claims on Northern Ireland, and what they see as "one 
geographical state thinking" aimed at removing Northern Ireland 
from the United Kingdom and bringing about a united Ireland. 
  They described the Irish Government as part of a 
"pan-nationalist front" that includes the IRA, Sinn Fein and the 
SDLP [Social Democratic Labour Party]. The UDA's campaign would 
therefore continue, they said, since in the event of an IRA 
ceasefire the constitutional claim would remain. 
  One of them confirmed that the UDA would continue its 
activities even were the IRA to lay down its weapons 
permanently: "There must be a prize for the IRA to call a 
ceasefire. The reasons for it would have to be closely looked 
at. Our days of reacting to the IRA are over as far as we are 
concerned. Our agenda now is pro-active." 
  The other man said: "We see a grim future. I think civil 
war gets nearer by the month, and that's not warmongering, 
that's a fact." 
  Anyone who believed that Unionists would allow themselves to 
be drawn into a united Ireland was "making a big 
miscalculation," he said. 
  "The feeling in our community now is that violence pays. 
Morale has worsened since the declaration was signed. The only 
people that we can trust are ourselves." 
  The UDA leaders said that the joint declaration by the 
British and Irish Government "means nothing to us." However, 
they added that clarification would be welcome: "The IRA want 
to know ,what comes next. We would like to know that too." 
  The two men said the UDA is stepping up its political 
profile. A working party is drawing up a paper based on two 
previous publications, Beyond the Religious Divide and Common 
Sense, which favour power-sharing in Northern Ireland, and a 
bill of rights. "It aims to fuse the two together, and we 
expect to publish it in about two months." 
  They indicated that the UDA may propose an independent 
Northern Ireland, which would have links with Britain and the 
Republic within an expanding EC. Nationalists in Northern 
Ireland would be allowed to pursue their aspirations 
democratically, although institutional north-south links were 
ruled out. 
  "We can all be good Europeans, and are willing to extend the 
hand of friendship towards London and Dublin. But we will never 
be forced into a united Ireland."

  [Text] Cologne (DDP/ADN) -- Foreign Minister Klaus Kinkel 
described the NATO air strike against the Serb advance on the 
east Bosnian town of Gorazde as "justified, necessary, and also 
right." On Westdeutscher Rundfunk's morning magazine program 
today, Kinkel expressed "hope that the Serbs will now come to 
their senses; otherwise NATO may be forced to intervene there 
again." This is possible according to UN Security Council 
resolution 836. "We are dealing here with one of the UN's safe 
areas which may be protected if force is used [against it] 
without any further decisions [being necessary]," the foreign 
minister stressed. 
  At the same time Kinkel spoke in favor of making further 
progress in the political field. It is of prime importance that 
the Russian side plays a part, he said. Kinkel called on Russia 
to exert its influence on the Serbs.

  [Text] Saarbruecken (DDP/ADN) -- Hans-Ulrich Klose, the 
leader of the SPD [Social Democratic Party] group in the 
Bundestag, has said the NATO operation at Gorazde was a correct 
step. Speaking on Saarland Radio today, Klose said: "The 
United Nations resolutions are constantly being violated; now 
the United Nations has reacted." 
  In certain situations the international community has no 
other option but to reply to force with force. 
  Klose said he was skeptical about a unanimous stance by the 
UN Security Council toward the Serb troops. To him, Russia's 
real role in the conflict remained unclear. On the other hand, 
the determination of the Americans regarding the Serbs had 
obviously grown.

  [Text] Demonstration at Bonn's Muenster square. Over 
25,000 people, mainly refugees from former Yugoslavia, 
commemorated the 250,000 people killed in the war in the 
Balkans. Under the slogan Let Bosnia Live, all speakers 
demanded that peace in Bosnia-Herzegovina be brought about, if 
necessary by force. The world must no longer watch the 
atrocities; a division of Bosnia is out of the question. 
  [Bundestag President Rita Suessmuth] The world community 
must not allow cultures to be destroyed, religions attacked, 
people exterminated. [end Suessmuth] 
  Cheered by his fellow countrymen, Bosnian Foreign Minister 
Ljubijankic spoke in support of further NATO ultimatums and for 
an end to the arms embargo. He thanked the German population, 
saying that no country has accepted more refugees than the FRG. 
This help will never be forgotten.

  [Text] Bonn (DDP/ADN) -- Early today, the German Government 
set in motion the evacuation of German nationals affected by the 
civil war in Rwanda. The Press Office of the Foreign Ministry 
stated that, on instructions from Foreign Minister Klaus Kinkel, 
Harald Ganns, the German Government's commissioner for African 
policy, has been flown by Bundeswehr aircraft to Bujumbura to 
organize the return of Germans arriving there from Rwanda. 
  The Defense Ministry has provided a 200-seater aircraft. The 
Foreign Ministry reported that approximately 180 Germans -- 
chiefly development aid workers and their families -- are in 
Bujumbura. They reached safety in Burundi yesterday from 
war-torn Rwanda. 
  It was stated that Kinkel has issued instructions that other 
foreign nationals who had to flee Burundi would be flown out on 
the Bundeswehr aircraft if there are any free spaces.

<F P=106> [Interview with Justice Minister Sabine </F>
Leutheusser-Schnarrenberger by Dieter Kopp on 10 April; place 
not given -- recorded] 
  [Excerpts] [passage omitted] [Kopp] An important test on 
how serious the FDP [Free Democratic Party] takes its role as 
advocate of minorities and human rights could be your opinion on 
the way in which delinquent Kurds should be treated. What 
should happen, and do you expect your party's unequivocal 
agreement at the FDP leadership's meeting in Bonn tomorrow [11 
April]? 
  [Leutheusser-Schnarrenberger] The FDP, and I am speaking for 
the party chairman and for myself here, has always emphasized 
that we will not accept violence in Germany, regardless of who 
commits it. I, as justice minister, must make clear that it is 
in our interest to punish people who violate our laws. The 
Kurds have done this by their violent actions. But, in applying 
the law on foreigners, we must also make it clear in every 
individual case that torture, inhumane treatment, and the death 
penalty are arguments against deportation. These facts must be 
examined; we cannot ignore them. 
  [Kopp] You are expressing your opinion. If what the 
chancellor said is right, you are not speaking for the 
government, let alone for him. Is this reprimand not unusual? 
  [Leutheusser-Schnarrenberger] I was surprised that the 
chancellor found my view different from his own. From what we 
have heard him say he has stated very clearly that our law must 
be enforced in Germany and that in the event of deportations, 
human rights must be safeguarded. This is precisely my view. I 
cannot see any difference of opinion in that. 
  [Kopp] The Federal Government and the laender interior 
ministers disagree on the number of those threatened with 
deportations to Turkey, where death penalty and torture cannot 
be excluded. How do you view this problem? 
  [Leutheusser-Schnarrenberger] There is no pat answer to this 
problem. Every individual case must be examined based on the 
situation of the person threatened with deportation, the 
information gained from reports, and the assessments from 
Turkey. In some cases there may be deportations, because there 
is no threat of torture or inhumane treatment. But there may 
also be different decisions. If there is a danger of torture, 
inhumane treatment, or the death penalty, deportations cannot be 
enforced. 
  [Kopp] There have been reports about a deportation agreement 
with Turkey, with Ankara guaranteeing humane treatment of the 
deported Kurds. Has this become more specific? Has the Federal 
Interior Ministry presented a draft yet? 
  [Leutheusser-Schnarrenberger] There are ongoing talks within 
the government on this issue, in particular between the Foreign 
Ministry, the Interior Ministry, and my ministry. We know and 
we are taking account of the fact that Turkey has signed 
international agreements against torture, the European Human 
Rights Convention. We are taking this into account and the fact 
that these agreements must not be downgraded in the debate, 
which is, however, far from concluded. 
  [Kopp] Do you think there is a chance of finding a common 
denominator that also can be made palatable to Turkey -- a 
sovereign Turkey that is already very annoyed over the 
suspension of weapons supplies? 
  [Leutheusser-Schnarrenberger] This cannot be answered and 
evaluated before the end of the talks. I think it is in all our 
interests that human rights be respected. This has been an 
issue at a number of talks held between the Federal Government 
and representatives of the Turkish Government. Foreign Minister 
Kinkel specifically made this quite clear earlier this year, 
together with his British colleague Douglas Hurd. We have to 
acknowledge we are in a difficult situation at the moment. 
  [Kopp] Do you see the suspension of weapons supplies as 
supporting your own course? 
  [Leutheusser-Schnarrenberger] This decision was initiated by 
the foreign minister because there have been reports -- the 
credibility of which still has to be examined and on which a 
final decision must still be made. I think Mr. Kinkel's signal 
was a correct one, and I can only support him in his position. 
I also think his position is consistent with what I have been 
saying in connection with deportations. 
  [Kopp] Kurdish violence in our streets has promoted the 
idea, advocated by Wolfgang Schaeuble before, of using the 
Bundeswehr domestically. Is this idea acceptable to Liberals? 
  [Leutheusser-Schnarrenberger] No, for Liberals there is a 
clear division of powers between the border police, the police, 
and the Bundeswehr, which is laid down in our constitution. 
There is no difference of opinion within the FDP, and this has 
always been stated clearly by the federal chairman and the 
secretary general. 
  [Kopp] Is the way in which the Kurdish-Turkish conflict is 
escalating on German territory and the way in which the German 
legislature is reacting to it not a situation that might promote 
xenophobia? 
  [Leutheusser-Schnarrenberger] I think that militant riots by 
foreigners in Germany increase the danger of right-wing 
extremist groups becoming stronger in their policy of xenophobia 
and racial hatred. This is why I strongly advocate dealing very 
unemotionally with these difficult issues in Germany, and this 
should also be reflected in the language we use. 
  [Kopp] Let me ask you about right-wing extremism: There has 
been outrage over the difficulties experienced by the 
legislature and the judiciary in coming to grips with the Nazi 
specter. This outrage has been triggered by the fact that 
[Republikaner chairman] Franz Schoenhuber gets away scot-free 
with slandering the chairman of the Central Council of Jews, 
Ignatz Bubis. Is this outrage not justified, and is it not high 
time to close loopholes in the law regarding instigation? 
  [Leutheusser-Schnarrenberger] Let me point out that 
right-wing extremist groups first of all must be countered by 
political means. We must not transfer the problems to the 
judicial authorities. We can only face these groups through 
joint action of all democratic parties and by socially outlawing 
these groups. This is the only way we can keep them out of 
parliaments. 
  [Kopp] Has there been too much sloppiness in the past? 
  [Leutheusser-Schnarrenberger] I think that we must make it 
much more obvious, that we must seek political confrontation in 
order to make people aware of the terrible and unrealistic ideas 
these groups represent. Mr. Schoenhuber's remarks have made 
this clear. With this he has lifted his mask. I, therefore, 
think these remarks will help increase people's awareness. I 
not only count on the judicial authorities and on new laws; as 
far as the law on instigation is concerned, the draft crime 
prevention act contains an amendment that will make it easier to 
punish slander of minorities and ethnic groups in general. 
[passage omitted] 
  [Kopp] At the FDP Rostock party congress there might be a 
coalition statement. Is it possible that it will not be in 
favor of the CDU/CSU [Christian Democratic Union/Christian 
Social Union]? 
  [Leutheusser-Schnarrenberger] I do not want to participate 
in speculation on coalition statements prior to the party 
congress. This will be discussed and prepared in the party 
panels. It is possible there may be a certain preference for 
the existing government coalition, because during the next few 
months we want to look back on the successes achieved in this 
coalition, of which the FDP is a part. 
  [Kopp] How do you judge the climate in the coalition? 
Following the attacks by the chancellor, you in particular 
should have every reason to be skeptical. 
  [Leutheusser-Schnarrenberger] It is obvious that legal and 
domestic policy is an area where conflicts, different opinions, 
and heated discussions are very likely. This also goes for 
coalitions. Liberals have a different view of the state than 
the Conservatives. This becomes apparent in individual 
instances. But it is the nature of a coalition that there are 
several partners who contribute their positions. What the 
coalition partners' positions are must be clear. I, together 
with other FDP politicians, represent legal and domestic policy 
and these conflicts are nothing unusual for me, but rather 
something that is part and parcel of a coalition. [passage 
omitted]

  [Text] Munich (DDP/ADN) -- Munich's Mayor Christian Ude has 
banned all [political] meetings on the eve of the Kurd trial 
tomorrow [in Munich]. The relevant instructions have already 
been issued, a district administrative department spokesman said 
today. Ude thus is following the advice of the police and the 
authorities, who warned that protests on a massive scale are 
expected from those associated with the Workers Party of 
Kurdistan, PKK, at the start of the trial of 13 Kurds, who 
attacked the Turkish Consulate General in Munich in June last 
year and took 21 people hostage. 
  About 2,500 police officers and Federal Border Guard units 
are to assemble in Munich by this evening to provide protection, 
a Munich police headquarters spokesman said today in response to 
an enquiry.

  [Text] Bonn, April 8 (A.A.) -- Turkey's ambassador to 
Germany Onur Oymen had a talk today with German Federal Foreign 
Ministry State Secretary Dieter Kastrup, on the suspension of 
German arms supply to Turkey. 
  After the meeting, Oymen told the Anatolian Agency, "we 
asked 
from Germany to resolve the matter at the soonest, through 
diplomatic means." 
  During their talk the German side told Oymen that they have 
received reports on Turkey's violation of the Turkish-German 
agreement and that Turkey was using German arms it received 
within the NATO, for domestic security reasons. 
  They added that Germany has suspended arms supply to Turkey 
until their investigation on the matter is concluded. 
  Oymen told German officials that Turkey has not violated any 
agreement it signed so far and that these claims were fabricated 
by circles supporting the illegal terror organization. 
  "Friendly and allied countries should trust each other," 
Oymen said. 
  "The claims have no basis. We expect Germany to resolve the 
matter at the soonest, through diplomatic channels," he said.

<F P=106> [Reimar Paul report: "Bomblets Being Made Ready for </F>
Delivery to Turkey"] 
  [Text] Goettingen -- According to the initiative "Stop the 
Export of Weapons" of the Federal Congress of Action Groups for 
Development Policies (BUKO), the German-Netherlands company 
Eurometaal wants to export weapons illegally to Turkey. The 
planned delivery involves ammunition for artillery shells -- 
so-called bomblets. The approximately 300,000 explosives are 
currently being finished and made ready for delivery. 
  A spokeswoman of the Federal Economics Ministry told BUKO 
that a corresponding export permit for Eurometaal has not been 
issued. All previous permits were granted on condition that the 
enterprise delivers its products to the Netherlands. From 
there, the ammunition must not be exported. Eurometaal has a 
tradition of exporting weapons to Turkey. As early as in 
November 1992, the MONITOR news magazine reported that the 
company planned to supply artillery shells to Ankara. After 
official protests -- and the oft-mentioned suspicion that the 
ammunition would be used against Kurds -- the firm decided to 
export a whole production plant. The plant parts that were 
transported on Turkish trucks are currently being assembled in 
the town of Kirikale, where the weapons factory is to be 
established, as DER SPIEGEL reported. 
  A document of the Defense Ministry in The Hague, which is 
available to BUKO, shows that up to 309,000 artillery shells 
with the effect of bomblets are to be produced in Kirikale. 
Their value is estimated at 400,000 German marks. The bomblets 
that are currently being finished in Liebenau after a complaint 
during a quality test are to be exported to Turkey by the end of 
the year.

<F P=106> [Robert Focken report: "Exact Figures Are Inexact"] </F>
  [Text] Bonn, 7 April -- According to preliminary 
calculations by the Federal Office for the Protection of the 
Constitution (BfV), in 1993 the number of left-wing extremist 
and right-wing extremist acts of violence came close to one 
other. Left-wing extremist acts of violence increased from 980 
(in 1992) to 1,078, which continued the trend of the past years; 
right-wing extremist acts of violence, which had risen since the 
end of 1990, on the other hand, declined from 2,638 (in 1992) to 
1,814, but were still considerably above the 1991 figure. 
  The acts of violence, which are only a part of the extremist 
crimes, include homicide, bodily injury, arson and bomb attacks, 
as well as offenses against the law relating to civil disorders 
and rioting, and "malicious damage with considerable use of 
force." Other crimes include offenses such as threats and 
coercion. So-called propaganda crimes are particularly frequent 
in the rightist scene. This is due, among other things, to the 
classification of what is propaganda. Thus, the swastika a 
student might spray on the wall of a house is considered to be a 
right-wing extremist crime; the abbreviation RAF [Red Army 
Faction], however, which is sprayed on the wall of a house, is 
not classified as a left-wing extremist deed, according to the 
Bonn police. 
  Another peculiarity must be taken into account when counting 
violent crimes: For "statistical reasons each act of violence 
is counted only once, even if it consists of several individual 
deeds," the 1992 Constitutional Protection report says. Thus, 
in 1992 the street riots on the "revolutionary 1 May" in Berlin 
were counted as a single (left-wing extremist) case of breaching 
public peace. At that time 104 policemen were injured. 
Similarly unimportant for the statistics was the demonstration 
in Bonn against the amendment to the asylum law on 26 May last 
year, which was attended by many people from the independent 
scene and during which there were many cases of bodily injury 
and coercion. 
  Statistical comparison of the crimes is also difficult 
because the BfV, the Federal Office of Criminal Investigations, 
and the laender have been able to agree on a common definition 
of what is and what is not to be counted as a crime only in the 
case of right-wing extremist excesses. Thus, a preliminary BfV 
statistic of December 1993 reports 8,109 such crimes (including 
acts of violence) for last year. A BfV list on left-wing 
extremism contains 1,336 crimes for 1993. The figures provided 
by the laender are quite different in this respect. Berlin 
police alone registered 3,349 left-wing extremist crimes last 
year, compared with 2,060 right-wing extremist ones. 
  The Berlin internal affairs senator says that the so-called 
autonomous activists, who "fight" against the renovation of the 
city and Berlin's expansion to the seat of parliament and 
government, are showing not only "further increasing militancy" 
but also a rising dissemination of "discriminating writings." 
These are often lists with addresses, telephone numbers, and 
car license plates of "fascists," that is, of political 
opponents. Recently right-wing extremists from the Rhine-Main 
area imitated this procedure with the brochure DER EINBLICK, 
which circulated in Main and listed addresses of "antifascists" 
all over Germany. Because of the suspected "particular 
dangerousness" of this action, the chief federal prosecutor 
assumed responsibility for the case. Since February a 
25-year-old man from Frankfurt/Main has been in detention 
pending trial. 
  Concerning left-wing extremists, the investigating public 
prosecutor's offices are less successful. A functionary of the 
German League, who was shot dead by unknown persons on 4 April 
1992, was mentioned in the independent pamphlet INTERIM in the 
form of a wanted poster two weeks before his assassination. In 
February and March this year, unknown persons carried out 
attacks on a Schleswig-Holstein functionary of the Liberal 
Workers Party and on the owner of a discotheque in Hesse. Both 
persons had been mentioned in "hit lists" of the scene before 
the attacks. 
  Security experts say that increased left-wing extremist 
activities are due to more intensive communication in the 
"scene"; the assumption that "antifascism" reacts only to the 
challenges from the right is "only half" correct. By means of 
"electronic mailboxes" in personal computers, better 
coordination at a nationwide level is possible. More actions 
are the result. The rightist scene is also up to date, and now 
uses a mailbox and telephone announcements. However, the often 
mentioned neo-Nazi interchange is just at its inception. 
  In Bonn concern is expressed that the rising violence of the 
left-wing extremist scene is not sufficiently understood by the 
public because of restrained media coverage. Left-wing 
extremists are choosing their victims with great care, it is 
said in the chancellor's office. When "rightists" are attacked, 
the leftists expect a certain empathy and tacit tolerance by 
segments of the population. Now there is the danger that this 
might come true, since coverage concentrates generally on 
xenophobic and neo-Nazi activities. Even though it is primarily 
right-wing extremists who are responsible for deaths, today all 
kinds of extremism and violence must be eradicated. 
  How difficult violence is to eradicate becomes clear when 
looking at projects such as the Anti-Racism Information Center 
(ARIC) in Duisburg, which was recently opened. The center, 
which is basically financed by the Caritas organization and 
Protestant church groups, urges children and youth groups as 
well as "multipliers" [Multiplikatoren] to recognize fascisms in 
its early stages. Leftist violence, on the other hand, is not on 
the curriculum. The ARIC co-founder Posselt, who is responsible 
for youth work in the Protestant Church in Westphalia, knows 
that the enemy is on the right: In his Violence and 
Racism Project manual, he claims that two Christian 
Democratic Union Bundestag deputies are members of a "right-wing 
extremist network."

  [Text] Cologne (DDP/ADN) -- The party office of the 
right-wing extremist German League in Cologne was completely 
destroyed Friday night [8 April] in an arson attack. All files 
and documents were also destroyed in the fire, which took 
several hours to put out. Markus Beisicht, party chairman and 
Cologne city council representative, estimated that material 
damage amounts to well over 50,000 German marks. 
  By midday, no letter admitting responsibility had been 
received. However, it is assumed that the perpetrators came from 
left-wing anarchists, because of several calls in Cologne by an 
"Antifascist Alliance" for the "destruction of the temporary 
offices." In Beisicht's view, the attack means the work of the 
party will be completely paralyzed for the next few weeks. The 
German League, nonetheless, will take part in the Cologne local 
government elections as planned.

<F P=106> [Report by Reinhard Voss: "`Exonerating Document' for </F>
`Republikaner'?"] 
  [Text] Duesseldorf, 8 April -- In the first constitutional 
protection report to be issued under his responsibility, Federal 
Interior Minister Manfred Kanther, of the Christian Democratic 
Union, no longer wants to count the Republikaner party among 
right-wing extremist parties. This can be concluded from the 
draft 1993 constitutional protection report, which the Federal 
Office for the Protection of the Constitution [BfV] presented to 
the laender. 
  Under a separate section, the draft concedes special status 
to the Republikaner. North Rhine-Westphalian Interior Minister 
Herbert Schnoor, of the Social Democratic Party of Germany, 
rejected such an -- as he called it -- "exonerating document" 
for the Republikaner in a letter to Kanther, the interior 
ministers, and interior senators of the laender. 
  According to information received by Schnoor, "individual 
Republikaner officials" received letters from the interior 
minister on their request, stating that the Republikaner were 
under BfV observation but that there was no decision yet. 
Schnoor, however, pointed to findings by the North 
Rhine-Westphalian Office for the Protection of the Constitution, 
rulings of the Administrative Court of Baden-Wuerttemberg, and 
the High Administrative Court of Muenster, which offered 
"sufficient evidence" for regarding the Republikaner as 
right-wing extremist. 
  If, in his report, Kanther indeed was no longer able to 
classify the Republikaner as right-wing extremist, he would make 
it possible for the Republikaner in upcoming court proceedings 
"to cite the Federal Government as a witness against those 
laender that are observing them," complains Schnoor to his 
colleagues. 
  Last month, the Duesseldorf interior minister, in his legal 
dispute with the Republikaner -- which ended in his favor -- on 
the lawfulness of their persecution by the North 
Rhine-Westphalian Office for the Protection of the Constitution, 
presented to the Duesseldorf Administrative Court eight 
procedures initiated against members of the Republikaner in 1993 
for politically motivated crimes. These included, among other 
things, the "simulated execution" of a Turk in Muelheim -- which 
the cardiac victim did not survive, unauthorized possession of 
firearms, dangerous injury, and aiding and abetting an attack 
against a home for asylum-seekers in the Bergheim district. 
  There was an attempt to hush up this case with the help of 
the Republikaner district and land executive committees to 
"prevent the most grave damage to the future of the party."

<F P=106> [DDP report: "FOCUS Insists: Slipups Occurred in Bad </F>
Kleinen"] 
  [Excerpt] Munich -- Despite official denials, slip-ups 
are believed to have occurred during the antiterrorism operation 
in Bad Kleinen, which led to the escape of four members of the 
Red Army Faction [RAF]. This was confirmed yesterday by the 
news magazine FOCUS. The magazine quotes notes and reports by 
analysts of the Federal Office of Criminal Investigation [BKA]. 
  In December 1993, the BKA prepared a leaflet showing a man 
and a woman. Moreover, the magazine quotes the following note: 
"During a later evaluation of the videotapes of the operation 
in Bad Kleinen, a specialist of BKA Section 21, which is 
responsible for terrorism, discovered that the man might be one 
and the same as the man who is believed to have been involved in 
the attack on former Trust Agency head Rohwedder." An analyst 
stated that he is "100 percent sure" that the unknown man 
participated in the attack, the magazine reports. [passage

<F P=106> [Johann Georg Reissmueller commentary: "Spheres of </F>
Influence in Southeastern Europe"] 
  [Text] Russia has certainly achieved one thing in 
southeastern Europe without intending to do so: The United 
States, which was first pleased but then alarmed about Russian 
activities in the former Yugoslavia, for the first time since 
1991 when the war started, is now behaving like a power that 
wants to restore order in the region and does not want to leave 
the field to itself or another power. 
  The goals that the U.S. Administration has set for itself 
are 
slowly emerging. Above all, the longer a war lasts, the more it 
attracts more foreign forces -- Russians and possibly a growing 
number of Islamic radicals from Asia and Africa -- but this 
should dry out quickly. The order after the war should ensure 
that the major part of the eastern Adriatic coast remains in 
reliable hands, and that Russian influence remain as small as 
possible in the western Balkans. The United States wants to be 
able to rely on the states in the region that share the same 
vital interests. 
  The United States is confronted with other powers in the 
region -- above all, the Serbs who have captured territory in 
Croatia and Bosnia. Serbia is the state with the greatest 
concentration of weapons in Europe west of Russia. Still, this 
is not a factor that might disturb U.S. circles in the long run. 
However, because the United States and its Western allies are 
determined not to use military force against the Serbs, Serbia 
is the one power in southeastern Europe that the United States 
is treating very cautiously and with great consideration. A 
soft Western -- and U.S. -- attitude, even encouragement, has 
made President Milosevic important in Belgrade. 
  Serbia is being endorsed by Russia, which found a supporter 
in Belgrade after its return to world politics. An old affinity 
strengthens relations, which is in line with the political 
pan-Slavism that is again spreading in Moscow. Russia has been 
striving for predominance in the Balkans since the last century. 
First, the Turkish, then the Hapsburg empires were in its way, 
then it removed itself with the introduction of Bolshevism. 
After his World War II victory, only Tito, who wanted to be a 
Stalin himself, prevented the Moscow empire from taking 
possession of the whole Balkans. For the first time after the 
changes in Europe in 1990, there is a renewed opportunity for 
Russia to gain a political foothold in southeastern Europe. The 
Russian objective is diametrically opposed to that of the United 
States: Moscow wants to establish a sphere of influence that 
extends as far as possible from Serbia to the west and north, as 
far as the Adriatic Sea, and toward Central Europe. 
  In the former Yugoslavia, West European powers have 
relinquished the field to the two major world powers. If their 
influence increases again, Great Britain and France in 
particular will not only pursue common Western but also their 
own interests -- which might collide with U.S. interests. This, 
and not only the Russians, may be one reason for Washington's 
hurry. 
  The United States would prefer a Bosnian state within its 
old 
boundaries. Yet Washington knows of Belgrade's plans for a 
greater Serbia, which are being encouraged by Russia. There are 
also doubts that the Serbs in Bosnia will form a common state 
together with the Bosnian Muslims and Croats. Some things -- 
including Washington's lack of interest in the Serbian 
offensives in eastern and northern Bosnia -- suggest that the 
United States has accepted Bosnia's partition. Then the United 
States would be left only with the task of ensuring a 
sufficiently large and coherent territory for the 
Muslim-Croatian canton state proclaimed, under its leadership, 
after negotiations with the Serbs and Russia. 
  The United States would certainly welcome a return of the 
Croatian territories occupied by the Serbs. Yet what efforts 
will it attempt to ensure that Serbia gives up the most valuable 
result, strategically and economically, of its war of conquest? 
The "normalization" being negotiated between the Zagreb 
government and the Serbian leaders in the occupied territories 
might finally consist of Croatia being granted sovereignty over 
these territories that exists only on paper, and in Croatia 
having to content itself with the reopening of the traffic 
routes. Then the Serbian war of aggression would have been 
worthwhile in Croatia -- just as in Bosnia. 
  The United States would then be the protector of a reduced 
Bosnia and an amputated Croatia. However, it also appears to 
view Macedonia and Albania as countries belonging to its sphere 
of influence. Yet there are obstacles and uncertainties. The 
Greek ethnic lobby group in the United States prevents the 
administration from efficiently supporting Macedonia against the 
Greek blockade. Albania is anxiously looking at neighboring 
Kosovo. If Serbian authorities increase the mistreatment of the 
Albanian population there, there might be a mass exodus to 
Albania one day. 
  How would the protector, the United States, react? As early 
as today, Washington may be considering a partition of Kosovo, 
with the "ethnically cleansed" portion remaining part of Serbia. 
The other half with the double Albanian population would fall 
to Albania. Yet such a cut would leave behind deep wounds. The 
United States would have to guard another trouble spot.

<F P=106> ["wtr"-signed commentary: "Sheer Populism"] </F>
  [Text] It is sheer populism that not only the chancellor 
but also his challenger in the elections now demand that violent 
Kurds be deported to Turkey. Admittedly, Scharping is linking 
his demand more clearly and precisely to Ankara respecting human 
rights than does Kohl, but this is not the way to do it! 
Presenting oneself as tough for the sake of right-wing voters 
and dangling human rights guarantees in front of liberal and 
thoughtful people at the same time is dangerous. It is 
dangerous, because it creates the impression that it only 
requires a few talks with Ankara to remove the obstacles to 
deportations that have quite rightly been built up by the law on 
foreigners and the Geneva Convention on Refugees. 
  Reality looks quite different. Turkey has violated every 
human rights agreement it has ever signed. Turkey is using the 
fight against the Workers Party of Kurdistan to complete its 
political, cultural, and social oppression of the Kurds. And, 
in Turkey, promises of the civilian government do not carry much 
weight. In the Kurdish areas -- and not only there -- the Army 
has the final say. 
  Politicians should be careful not to create the impression 
that the problem is easy to solve. Otherwise they might 
pressure themselves into having to violate international 
obligations in order to keep their promises. No, there must be 
an end to suggestions that Turkey is a country to which people 
can be deported. Anyone committing an offense in Germany must 
be tried in Germany and put in German prisons.

  [Text] Umberto Bossi went to Pontida to face tens of 
thousands of Northern League supporters, perhaps as many as 
50,000. Silvio Berlusconi, on the other hand, went to Rome 
where he attended the congress of Marco Pannella's Reform Party. 
Once again this Sunday has been full of political issues 
dominated by the two major partners in the Freedom Alliance, who 
along with Gianfranco Fini's National Alliance, should give us a 
government following the vote that took place on 27 and 28 March. 
  Bossi confirmed that the Northern League would be part of 
the 
next government, but he laid down certain conditions: 
federalism, the free market, and antitrust laws to take power 
away from the partiocratic state and from the elite business 
dynasties. These conditions are called the Pact of Pontida and 
were pledged by the 181 Northern League parliamentarians. Bossi 
warned that if things do not change within the space of six 
months, the League would leave the government and northern Italy 
would go it alone. 
  Now we turn to Rome, where Silvio Berlusconi took the 
opportunity of stressing that the Alliance that won the 
elections was not right-wing but centrist. The leader of Forza 
Italia undertook to become the messenger of good sense and good 
government and to steer the Alliance towards the center. He 
said that he wanted an efficient government supported by a 
working majority. He also called for the reform of the 
electoral system with single member constituencies being 
contested in one round with a first-past-the-post system. 
Berlusconi called for the abolition of the proportional 
percentage of seat allocations.

<F P=106> [Interview with Italian Northern League chairman Umberto </F>
Bossi by RAI correspondent Bruno Vespa; place and date not given 
-- live or recorded] 
  [Text] [Vespa] Mr. Bossi, is everything settled now? Will 
[Forza Italia leader] Silvio Berlusconi be prime minister? 
  [Bossi] Let us put it this way: we are talking. We imposed 
the federalist condition, because this is a special historical 
moment. Very soon, within six months, there may be a strong 
institutional change in the country. There is also the free 
market condition. We need an antitrust law to break up the 
duopoly which in the past controlled the country's economy. On 
the one hand there were the parties, and on the other hand a few 
big families which controlled capital and businesses with the 
support of the state. 
  [Vespa] Let us talk about federalism. Could you renounce 
your idea of three large regions and adopt a softer approach? 
  [Bossi] There is no doubt that federalism must be based on 
macroregions. Modern federalism must be based on regions which 
are homogenous from a social and economic point of view. 
However, the number of these macroregions can be discussed. 
  [Vespa] What must Berlusconi the businessman get rid of to 
become prime minister? 
  [Bossi] In America such an eventuality is regulated by the 
law. Whoever has such a powerful and prestigious post must hand 
over all his assets to a company which he or she cannot control. 
This should make it easier for the prime minister to make 
decisions on issues where there is a conflict of interest 
between the private and the public spheres. 
  [Vespa] So, are you thinking of proposing that in Italy? 
  [Bossi] Yes. 
  [Vespa] Would Berlusconi then be allowed to become prime 
minister? 
  [Bossi] Once the condition on federalism is accepted and a 
first step in the direction of an antitrust law is made, we 
would not be against it. 
  [Vespa] Do you want a League member to be elected as speaker 
in the Chamber of Deputies or of the Senate? 
  [Bossi] We want the Senate, because we have [Francesco] 
Speroni there. The personality and public image of any 
candidate for the post of speaker of the Senate must be taken 
into account as he would automatically be the deputy president 
of the republic.

<F P=106> [Interview with Italian Northern League ideologue Gianfranco </F>
Miglio by Marco Ventura in Domaso, Como province; date not 
given: "Miglio: Rest Assured, We Will Reach an Agreement" -- 
first paragraph is IL GIORNALE introduction] 
  [Text] Rome -- "We are engaged in talks, and no doubt will 
reach an agreement. I have never been an optimist, but this 
time I tend to be one. If we can agree on the federal state, 
the rest will follow, and I believe some people are beginning to 
see our point, perhaps even some of our friends in the MSI 
[Italian Social Movement]...." Speaking over the phone, 
Gianfranco Miglio, the League supporters' constitutionalist 
ideologue, explained his idea of federalism, during a pause 
inbetween his tours of the Domaso vineyards in the Como 
province. Democracy is in danger in the sense that "we are 
running the risk of an authoritarian involution," not through 
any fault of Berlusconi's "but because people who are 
disappointed with democracy tend to say: `Then it is better if 
only one person is in charge,'" and Berlusconi fits the bill. 
There is a great craving for authoritarianism, especially among 
young people. During the election campaign, Berlusconi gave 
himself airs as the fatherland's savior, and Italians would be 
capable of giving him all the power in the world, stripping 
themselves of their rights -- "they have already done so before 
in the past." The professor was in a good mood, predicting a 
turn for the better. "What we need now is a constituent 
government which will reform the Constitution, have the 
amendments approved by the houses, and submit the text to the 
people through a referendum." 
  [Ventura] Is therefore an agreement taking shape within the 
pole for freedom.? 
  [Miglio] I will not tell you everything that is cooking in 
the pot, but the First Republic's conservatives, those who are 
hoping to salvage it, and the whole lot, are going to be 
outsmarted. We will see who wins. 
  [Ventura] You will also have to make some concessions. 
  [Miglio] Yes, of course, without, however, renouncing 
federalism. 
  [Ventura] Do you accept national unity and indivisibility? 
  [Miglio] Indivisibility can go fly like a kite, if my idea 
of 
two or three cantons wins the day. The whole idea of 
indivisibility is outdated anyway, as is that of sovereignty, 
which in the federal model has a dual nature, belonging both to 
the state and the cantons. Unity is guaranteed by the directly 
elected premier, who governs via a directorate made up of the 
canton governors. 
  [Ventura] Would National Alliance's [AN] coordinator Fini 
accept federalism in exchange for presidentialism? 
  [Miglio] The head of state is a useless encumbrance of which 
we must get rid ourselves. The chairman of the Constitutional 
Court could do so, but the strong power would be in the hands of 
the prime minister, elected by the various peoples of the 
federation. 
  [Ventura] Who would be in charge of public education and 
internal affairs? 
  [Miglio] The cantons would be responsible for public 
education, and the central state for universities and scientific 
research. The cantonal police forces would be complemented by a 
federal FBI. 
  [Ventura] What about fiscal autonomy? Would a certain 
percentage of the taxes levied go to the center? 
  [Miglio] Yes, but this proportion would be decided by the 
cantons, coordinated by the directorate. 
  [Ventura] Are you thinking in terms of a Belgian or U.S. 
model? 
  [Miglio] Closer to the U.S. system, but rather like the 
original structure of the Philadelphia Constitution, before 
Roosevelt's welfare-state conception curtailed the states' 
prerogatives in favor of the federal government. True 
federalism is what you have in Switzerland, which is 700 years 
old, as many years as my family has witnessed since it 
established itself here at Domaso. 
  [Ventura] In an interview with LA REPUBBLICA, parliamentary 
relations minister and constitutionalist advocate Paolo Barile 
stated that "Miglio-type federalism is unrealizable." You can 
change the form of government but not that of the state. 
  [Miglio] Nonsense! Barile has been fighting a losing battle 
for the past 30 years. He, Matteucci and other 
liberal-democrats, including well-known figures like Galli Della 
Loggia and Panebianco believe that everything that has happened 
to us was solely due to the malevolence, incompetence, and 
dishonesty of politicians, and that, once the latter are 
removed, the "new" guys will appear on the scene, and everybody 
will live happily ever after. 
  [Ventura] Whereas.... 
  [Miglio] Whereas this is not the case! The Constitution must 
be amended. We have the right tool for doing this, no doubt. 
It is enough to read articles 138 and 139. Everything can be 
changed, except the republican form, by means of a majority plus 
one of the deputies, and the other half just have to accept it, 
whether they like it or not. Constitutions have never been made 
by the people as a whole for the people as a whole, but by the 
winners against the losers, as in 1956 by the antifascists, who 
in fact did not even have it ratified through a referendum. 
  [Ventura] Forza Italia economist Antonio Martino is 
proposing 
moving beyond the regions by means of a structure comprising 25 
to 50 "counties," somewhat larger than provinces. 
  [Miglio] Bringing together the local governments into a 
single body is an old idea, even the papal government's 
constitutionalists discussed it in their time. It is an 
attractive and elegant model, but it does not fit reality in 
Italy, nor federalism, which requires greater units, large 
enough to counterbalance the central power. We must set out 
from the regions, not destroy them.

  [Text] Rome, April 10 (AFP) -- Three Italian aircraft due 
to help in the evacuation of foreign nationals from Rwanda took 
off from Pisa airport Sunday afternoon [10 April] en route for 
Nairobi. 
  The three Hercules C-130 transport planes of the Italian 
armed forces left the military base in the central Italian town 
at around 3:00 p.m (1300 GMT), the Italian defence ministry said. 
  The planes, carrying 24 paratroopers, will participate in 
the 
evacuation of European and U.S. citizens from the Rwandan 
capital Kigali as soon as conditions at the city's airport 
permit, the ministry said. 
  The ministry earlier said it was in permanent contact with 
the Belgian and French general staffs, which it said had set up 
a centre in Nairobi to coordinate the evacuation of westerners 
from Rwanda. 
  More than 1,000 people have been killed in the east African 
state in a wave of ethnic bloodletting which began Thursday.

  [Text] Rome, April, 10, IRNA -- Iran and Italy are now 
engaged in financial negotiations focusing on rescheduling 
Iran's debts to Italian firms, Iran's ambassador here, Majid 
Hedayat-Zadeh Razawi said Saturday [9 April]. 
  Razawi told IRNA that Italy is Iran's third largest trade 
partner and Iran is Italy's third largest supplier of crude oil 
with trade between the two countries standing at drls. 3 billion 
annually. 
  The issue can be settled if Italian creditor companies agree 
to reschedule the debts owed by Iran to them in a way that Iran 
can pay off its debts in a four year period starting two years 
after such an agreement is reached, he said. 
  "As a matter of fact, no figure has been mentioned in the 
negotiations or in a letter of understanding inked by the two 
countries.... What is important is the topic of discussion and 
an overall agreement," he said.

<F P=106> [Cristina de la Hoz report: "Aznar and Arzalluz Unblock </F>
Their Relations and Establish a Line of Cooperation"] 
  [Text] [People's Party Chairman] Jose Maria Aznar and 
[Basque Nationalist Party, PNV, Chairman] Xabier Arzalluz met 
Tuesday [29 March] in order to unblock relations between their 
parties. The two leaders, who had not talked since June 1991, 
decided to establish a stable channel of communication, 
especially with respect to autonomy and economic issues and 
cooperation in the Congress [of Deputies]. The People's Party 
also acknowledges the possibility of taking part in the next 
Basque government. 
  The meeting took place at a private house midway between 
Burgos and the Basque Country, and helped break three years of 
noncommunication since the two politicians met 12 June 1991. 
Accompanied by Jaime Mayor Oreja, People's Party chairman in the 
Basque Country, and by Juan Maria Ollora of the PNV, Aznar and 
Arzalluz mainly centered their four-hour conversation on the 
economic and autonomy situations and on the need to recover a 
certain world of values, Mayor Oreja told ABC yesterday. 
  However, the main aim was to unblock a relationship which 
was 
virtually nonexistent, since, although both leaders have 
attended European People's Party meetings, they have not 
directly exchanged a word, although they have indirectly 
exchanged many mutual accusations. 
  Arzalluz expressed his concern about the implementation of 
autonomy and even handed the People's Party leader a document 
containing his party's stance on the matter, which dwelt 
especially on the single social security fund. But there was 
most agreement on the situation of "grave" economic and 
industrial crisis which Spain is experiencing, as Mayor Oreja 
explained to this newspaper, and for this reason Aznar and 
Arzalluz decided that their respective parties will continue 
their contacts after Easter Week. 
  The People's Party and the PNV are thus establishing new 
channels of communication which will also be manifested between 
the parliamentary groups in the Congress, although Mayor Oreja 
refused to speak of the existence of any common front, but 
asserted, on the other hand, the need for less rigidity in 
relations between the two parties. 
  The initiative for the meeting, the same sources added, was 
shared, and came following a conversation four weeks ago between 
the People's Party chairman in the Basque Country and 
Lehendakari [Basque premier] Jose Antonio Ardanza. 
  Emphasis was also placed on giving greater impetus to 
regeneration of the institutions. An issue which was broached 
very superficially -- "it really was discussed very little" -- 
was terrorism, perhaps in order to avoid tensions in a 
conversation which would have made clear the deep differences. 
As Mayor Oreja explained, the People's Party is opposed to ETA 
[Basque Homeland and Liberty] members' rehabilitation taking 
place through a decision of the Basque parliament. 
  The unblocking of relations between the People's Party and 
the PNV occurs against the backdrop of the holding of the next 
Basque elections in the fall. In this connection, and since all 
the parties seem to be open to any cooperation formula in order 
to form a government, the People's Party is not ruling out 
joining in that combination, and a PNV-People's Party government 
could be conjectured, at least in theory. However, Mayor Oreja 
emphasized that the People's Party's sole aim is to rise in this 
community, and described any other kind of conjecture as 
premature "until we know the results." 
  For his part, Basque premier Jose Antonio Ardanza described 
the meeting as very positive, although he would say nothing 
about possible future coalitions following the elections. He 
stated that it is his party's duty, "because of the major 
government responsibility which it has been exercising since the 
transition," to maintain relations "at both ends of the 
political spectrum."

  [Text] According to Interior Minister Mauri Pekkarinen, 
Finland's EU [European Union] negotiation result is getting 
worse and worse while the contents are becoming more exact. 
According to Pekkarinen, who spoke in Marttila, the result is 
clearly worse than expected both in regional policy and in the 
food industry. According to Pekkarinen, membership of the EU 
would create extra costs of nearly 10 billion Finnish markkas 
for next year's state budget. According to him, what is now 
fundamental is which national measures are to be taken. 
According to the minister of the interior, the national 
referendum should be arranged only after the Swedish national 
referendum.

<F P=106> [Commentary by Edvard Hoem: "Good Result?"] </F>
  [Text] Negotiated result: This is Maastricht realized, in 
Norwegian waters and on Norwegian soil. 
  Negotiations concerning Norwegian membership in the European 
Union [EU] have been concluded, the cards are on the table, and 
it is up to the Norwegian people to make up their mind. In the 
coming debate opponents and proponents will fight over how good 
or how bad the outcome of the negotiations is. Some will 
continue to insist that there have been no negotiations 
concerning the most important items. 
  It is my honest opinion that the negotiated outcome is 
exactly as expected. The Maastricht Treaty contains precisely 
the same principles about free access to markets, common prices, 
regional support arrangements, and the prohibition of special 
national arrangements that the final agreement between Norway 
and the EU embodies. 
  That is why the negotiated result should be an important 
element for any one who wants to make up his mind on what 
membership in the EU will involve for our country. The 
negotiated result is the Union's policy realized, it is the 
Maastricht Treaty carried out, in Norwegian waters and on 
Norwegian soil. 
  The government entered into negotiations with demands for 
extensive exceptions and with adamant language concerning 
fishing quotas and [national] rights. 
  Not on one single point did the negotiators win acceptance 
for special national arrangements that were at variance with the 
Union plan. All those positions that were intended to secure 
national control were abandoned on the way. Otherwise there 
would not have been a negotiated result at all! In this decisive 
phase the EU could not hit itself on the head by offering Norway 
conditions that were contrary to its comprehensive ambitions. 
The Union had no way of yielding anything as far as the 
framework in principle was concerned. An independent Norwegian 
fishing policy or agricultural policy neither can nor will exist 
any longer, just as the Norwegian sea, and definitely 
Norwegians' right to their own administrative law or right to 
govern will be no more. The fishing policy and agricultural 
policy, monetary policy, and trade policy will from now on be a 
Union matter and common policy. Our ocean will become a Union 
ocean and Norwegian fishermen will be Union citizens, in the 
same way that other fishermen and tailors and office clerks are 
citizens of the EU. If we do the best we know how, the present 
quotas and historical rights might last through the year 2002. 
After that day there are absolutely no more legal, political, 
moral, or constitutional guarantees for Norwegian fishermen, 
either outside or inside the Norwegian 12 mile limit. 
  That is why it is a political sleight of hand to use the 
frictions within the present EU as an example of what the 
various nations can determine in the future. The fight over 
voting rules in the Council of Ministers is a fight over the 
drive and energy of the Union project, not about the direction 
and the goal. The Norwegian Government, which has warmly 
embraced the plans for union in the Maastricht Treaty, will 
logically have to support those who advocate far-reaching 
majority decisions and a high threshold for the right of the 
minority to block decisions. 
  Therefore, the only thing left is to state the following: 
The 
agreement with the European Union is a document of the greatest 
historical importance. The government will make our country into 
a federal state in a forthcoming, strong union. The agreement 
takes away from us our status as a small, but active participant 
on the international arena, and makes us live on the fringe of 
Europe.

  [Text] U.S. Ambassador in Cyprus Richard Boucher is the 
one who was actually behind the moves and efforts to change UN 
Secretary General Butrus Butrus-Ghali's latest report to the 
Security Council on the results of the proximity talks. 
  According to our information from Washington, the U.S. 
ambassador strongly suggested that the State Department push the 
UN Secretariat to amend the initial text of the secretary 
general's report to not blame the Turkish side for the failure 
of the talks. 
  According to the same information, a close supporter of this 
effort by Mr. Boucher was Robert Lamb, U.S. State Department 
special coordinator on Cyprus; however, the actions and 
initiative were the U.S. ambassador's. 
  The same information also notes that one of the reasons that 
led Mr. Boucher to this initiative, besides, of course, the fact 
that this effort is part of the greater U.S. policy toward 
Cyprus and the Turks, is the fact that he has been a diplomat in 
Cyprus for such a short time that he has not developed a greater 
perspective for progress on the Cyprus issue.

  [Text] National Unity Party [NUP] leader Dervis Eroglu's 
resignation was rejected by the party council. Eroglu submitted 
his resignation as party leader to the council during a meeting 
this afternoon. The party council, however, unanimously 
rejected Eroglu's resignation and asked him to continue his duty. 
  In a statement to the press, Eroglu explained that he 
reached 
a point of resignation following certain speculative reports, 
but in line with the decision of the party council, he will try 
to fulfill the NUP's duties to the community in unity and 
solidarity with his colleagues. Eroglu said that the party 
council also decided to prepare for the local elections to be 
held in June and accept the results collectively. Pointing out 
that the NUP is totally united, Eroglu noted that there are 
attempts to play tricks on his party. Hakki Atun, Democratic 
Party leader and prime minister, is seeking to settle accounts 
with the NUP, Eroglu charged, adding that rivalry in politics 
should not cause hostility.

  [Text] The death of national guardsman Stathis Aryirou 
from Ayios Dhometios was caused by self-inflicted gunshot. 
Aryirou was found dead around 1000 this morning outside a 
guardpost where he was on duty in the area between the Bata Shoe 
Factory traffic circle and the SOPAZ [Animal Feeds Production 
Cooperative] factory. 
  Defense Minister Konstandinos Iliadhis issued a statement on 
the incident and ordered investigations by the National Guard to 
accurately determine the circumstances of the unfortunate 
national guardsman's death. 
  Aryirou had an entrance wound in his lower jaw and an exit 
wound in the right bregmatic area of his skull. Coroner Marios 
Matsakis will conduct a post mortem on his body. 
  Both the defense minister and National Guard Commander 
Lieutenant General Nikolaos Vorvolakos visited the area where 
the national guardsman was found dead. Responding to a question 
on whether the Defense Ministry is concerned about accidents in 
the National Guard, the defense minister said that the number of 
accidents is not disturbing and added that accidents happen in 
all the armies of the world. He also noted that the Defense 
Ministry is prepared to release the statistics since 1988. 
Lieutenant General Vorvolakos pointed out that the number of 
accidents in the National Guard during the past six years is one 
of the lowest, compared to other armies.

health last night has in the end been proven groundless. 
President Karamanlis suffered a minor drop in blood pressure at 
2000 yesterday evening and, as for any emergency, he was moved 
to the Presidential Palace in an ambulance. After awhile, the 
president's blood pressure returned to normal and he is

<F P=106> [Report by Theodhoros Rousopoulos] </F>
  [Text] UN mediator Cyrus Vance, who will meet Foreign 
Ministry Secretary General Khristos Zakharakis in New York 
tomorrow, has prepared a draft agreement for Athens and Skopje 
[The Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia--FYROM]. 
  Vance will suggest to the Greek ambassador and the Skopjean 
foreign minister that they follow a step-by-step approach to the 
issue. He will try to bring the two different views closer. 
Greece believes that [FYROM President Kiro] Gligorov must stop 
provocative acts and then discuss the name issue while Skopje 
wants comprehensive negotiations after the embargo is lifted. 
  Vance is expected to suggest the following steps: 
  A. That both sides assure that they will sit at the 
negotiating table and discuss every issue. (Both Gligorov and 
Papandreou have said that they intend to discuss the name issue. 
Each one stressed that he would try to persuade the other, not 
change his own position.) 
  B. That the discussion be separated into time periods. This 
means that a discussion on the symbols and the Constitution may 
be held before any other issue is discussed. That a solution 
will be found on these issues and after a certain time period 
(months or even years) the name issue, which is the most 
difficult one, will be discussed. 
  C. That a discussion first be held at the diplomatic level 
and then at the political level. This removes part of the 
significance that the political parties of both countries would 
attribute to the procedure. The procedure suggested is 
essentially the same that was followed during the New Democracy 
term, when a dialogue was held between the United Nations and 
ambassadors. 
  The greatest problem so far is the Greek measures against 
Skopje. As long as the embargo is maintained, Skopje does not 
intend to negotiate. This is why the solution that Cyrus Vance 
will suggest looks like Columbus' egg [as published]. Both 
sides should mutually retreat, each one mentioning in their 
declaration that Greece will lift the embargo and Skopje will 
cancel its flag and reexamine its positions on the constitution 
and the borders. Therefore, tomorrow's meeting at the United 
Nations is considered critical because Vance will try to 
persuade the two sides. The truth is that not much effort is 
needed to achieve this. The problem is clearly a procedural one 
so that neither side is politically exposed in its country. 
<H5>  The Appeal </H5>
  At the same time, the international community will increase 
pressure on Skopje and Athens. The United States is trying to 
show Gligorov that a lot depends on his stance if it is to help 
him during the elections in November. With the presence of U.S. 
troops, the United States will provide Gligorov with security. 
The United States is also asking him to retreat from 
intransigent positions. 
  The European Union [EU] is still pressuring Greece, and for 
the first time in its history it appealed against the presiding 
country at the European Court. The European Commission will 
wait until Wednesday (the outcome at the United Nations) before 
deciding whether to finally refer our country to court. 
  In court--which will confer behind closed doors because 
political, public order, and international tension issue will be 
discussed--our country will have to deal with great 
difficulties. Despite assurances by government spokesman 
Evangelos Venizelos that there are no penalties and fines are 
not imposed easily, some European politicians have already given 
the go ahead to the EU to impose economic sanctions against 
Greece. 
  We are now in a strange situation: Our country, one of the 
12, is facing sanctions within the EU and its only hope for a 
solution to the problem is through the United Nations, or to be 
exact, the United States.

  [Excerpts] Preparing for a week of intense diplomatic 
activity, Foreign Minister Karolos Papoulias yesterday 
reiterated the government's defiant disregard for Wednesday's [6 
April] "sad" decision by the European Commission to take Greece 
to the European Court of Justice unless its sanctions on Skopje 
[The Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia--FYROM] are lifted 
within a week. 
  Mr. Papoulias spoke to reporters after briefing President 
Konstandinos Karamanlis on the latest developments over the 
Skopje issue, the likelihood of having to withstand the 
threatened EU [European Union] legal action, and Monday's 
planned talks of UN mediator Cyrus Vance in separate sessions 
with Greek and Skopje officials. 
  "The government has no reason to worry about the 
Commission's 
flawed decision," Mr. Papoulias said, relegating the EU 
ultimatum against Greece as "no different from other 
unpraiseworthy initiatives like those which enhanced the 
dissolution of Yugoslavia." 
  But he commended last week's shuttle diplomacy between 
Athens 
and Skopje by U.S. special envoy Matthew Nimetz, which the Greek 
foreign minister described as "very useful." He did not rule 
out Mr. Nimetz's resumption of his efforts next week, in 
conjunction with a possible progress in Mr. Vance's mediation 
talks in New York. [passage omitted] 
  Regarding the legal action against Greece by the EU, 
Government spokesman Evangelos Venizelos told reporters: "The 
procedure which the Commission seems to have chosen, is one 
which has never been used before within the Community. The aim 
of such proceedings would be to establish whether a member-state 
is abusing its right to impose sanctions on a third country, for 
reasons of national security, public safety or international 
tension that endangers peace." 
  Mr. Venizelos stressed that, if the Commission finally 
initiates these proceedings, it would take no less than a whole 
year to reach a court ruling. Further, the spokesman emphasised 
that such legal action would not be in the form of criminal 
proceedings. "The EU Court only offers an opinion on a possible 
violation of EU law, without further legal consequences. There 
is no penalty, and, certainly, the levying of fines is no easy 
matter either," Mr. Venizelos said.

  [Text] An anonymous caller has telephoned a private radio 
station claiming that 17 November was responsible for explosions 
that took place shortly after midnight at the offices of the 
Alico and Nationale Nederlanden insurance companies. 
  The explosion at Alico's office on 119 Kifisias Avenue was 
caused by a 3.5-inch rocket launched from a construction site 
across the road. The explosion at Nationale Nederlanden's 
office on 131 Kifisias Avenue was caused by a timed explosive 
mechanism. The caller who made the claim on behalf of the 17 
November organization also said that a few days ago, a British 
aircraft carrier was selected as a target by the organization 
but the launching mechanism failed. 
  Around the same time as the explosions in Kifisias Avenue, a 
blast occurred by a parked car at 3 Kanaris Street, Stamata, 
Attiki. The investigating authorities believe this explosion is 
not related with the two bomb attacks on Kifisias Avenue.

  [Text] Foreign Minister Hikmet Cetin has stated that the 
NATO operation against Serb positions, which attacked Gorazde in 
Bosnia-Herzegovina, constitutes an important warning to the 
Serbs. Expressing the hope that the Serbs will understand this 
warning and withdraw from the areas surrounding the city, Cetin 
said: If they do not withdraw, it is certain that the 
operations will continue. 
  In a statement to TRT, Cetin recalled that since the onset 
of 
Serbian attacks around Gorazde, Turkey has advocated adopting 
measures. Turkey wanted NATO to take action against Gorazde, 
which was declared a secure area by the United Nations, just 
like in Sarajevo, Cetin remarked. He added: It was, however, 
the United Nations that was supposed to decide and make a 
request on this subject. 
  Cetin recounted that following the UN Secretary General's 
assessment yesterday, the United Nations applied to NATO and 
asked for a limited operation around Gorazde. He continued: 
Within the framework of a previously adopted decision on the 
matter, NATO was ready to undertake this operation. It made a 
decision quickly and conducted an air operation against certain 
military targets around Gorazde. This is an important warning. 
The Serbs should understand this. The Serbs must cease being a 
country that disrupts peace in front of the whole world and that 
continues attacks. I hope they will heed this warning and 
immediately withdraw from positions they are occupying around 
Gorazde. Otherwise, it is certain that the operations will 
continue.

<F P=106> [Interview with Foreign Minister Hikmet Cetin by Metin Gokce </F>
in Ankara on 10 April -- recorded] 
  [Text] [Gokce] Mr. Minister, what is the situation in 
Gorazde according to the information you have received? 
  [Cetin] The Gorazde problem is not a new one. Gorazde is one 
of the six cities included in the secure areas determined by the 
United Nations. There have been sieges of Gorazde from time to 
time. There have also been times when this city could not 
receive any bread. I discussed these issues with officials in 
Sarajevo. Since 29 March, the sieges there have been intensified 
and attacks have been continuing. Turkey continued to undertake 
initiatives with regard to this matter during this time. For 
example, we held talks with Foreign Ministry officials from 
Bosnia-Herzegovina and Croatia at the beginning of last week. 
This was one of the topics discussed at the talks. An appeal 
was issued to the United Nations, asking them to put an end to 
the siege in Gorazde as soon as possible and make the city 
genuinely secure. This matter was brought to the attention of 
the [word indistinct] foreign minister in a letter. In my 
contacts, I discussed these issued with Ejup Ganic and the 
Bosnian foreign minister, who were in Turkey two days ago. 
  It is clear that there is neglect or foot-dragging on the 
part of the United Nations with regard to this subject. 
Although the city is under siege and NATO is ready to conduct 
an air operation if the United Nations demands, for some reason 
the United Nations is acting slowly on the matter. According to 
reports we received recently, the siege has been further 
intensified, the city is predominantly Muslim, most probably 
they want the city to be evacuated, and people have started 
arriving in the city from surrounding villages, making the city 
more populated. At this point, in order to prevent further 
suffering to the people there.... [pauses] Their suffering is 
also ours. I was in Sarajevo three times. As always, the 
Foreign Ministry has dedicated all its work force and all its 
time to this issue. We want to prevent the death of even one 
person. We want the United Nations to end this siege 
immediately and if necessary, apply to NATO for air 
intervention. We are continuing the necessary efforts to this 
end. 
  [Gokce] There are reports that chemical weapons were used 
against Gorazde last night and that there were mass deaths. 
Have you been in contact with Bosnia-Herzegovina officials? 
  [Cetin] Since last night, Foreign Ministry officials as well 
as myself have been trying to investigate this report, which 
stemmed from a single source. We contacted our permanent 
representative to the United Nations in New York. We contacted 
NATO in Brussels. We also contacted Zagreb, where the UN 
headquarters is located, and Sarajevo. It is true that there is 
a tense atmosphere, artillery is being fired, and people are 
being killed. As of this morning, however, the reports on the 
use of chemical warfare or mass deaths were not confirmed 
through our contacts. This morning as well as this afternoon, I 
had two conversations with Muslim Bosnian Prime Minister Haris 
Silajdzic. He is the prime minister of the country and is 
currently in Sarajevo. He is not in Ankara, Istanbul, or New 
York, like us. He is in his office in Sarajevo. I discussed 
this matter with him and told him that there are such reports in 
Turkey. I tried to understand the situation. As you know, 
Gorazde is 60-65 km from Sarajevo. It is very close to 
Sarajevo. According to what he told me at 1500 this afternoon, 
the siege is continuing, the situation is tense, and measures 
should be adopted in this regard. He reported to me, however, 
that he has no information about the use of chemical weapons or 
that there were mass deaths. 
  We are obliged to believe the prime minister of a country. 
Therefore, I would like to call on my citizens especially. 
Naturally, every drop of blood shed in Bosnia-Herzegovina hurts 
us. Their suffering is also ours. Turkey was there before 
anyone else. I respect my citizens' sensitivity on this subject. 
There is, however, a government in that country and there are 
officials. There is also a ministry which has devoted all its 
efforts to this matter and which has a very good track record. 
We will work on this issue until the end and we will continue 
to do so, but I must act in line with the information conveyed 
to me by the responsible prime minister of the country, who now 
lives in Sarajevo. If he tells me that as of now he has no 
information on the use of chemical warfare or mass massacres, 
then we must all respect him. 
  Turkey will naturally do whatever is necessary and has done 
so. Even if these events did not occur, I believe that if 
necessary NATO should conduct an air operation in order to lift 
the siege around Gorazde as soon as possible and we are working 
to this end. If necessary, we will intensify our initiatives 
even further in this regard. We want the United Nations to make 
an ultimatum on this subject. Gorazde and the other cities must 
be transformed into secure areas in the real sense of the word 
as soon as possible. A United Nations, which cannot render 
secure the areas which it decided to make secure, can no longer 
be trusted. Naturally, the Turkish Government will do whatever 
necessary. I sincerely hope that our citizens will be calm on 
this issue.

  [Excerpt] The massacres perpetrated by the Serbs in the 
town of Gorazde in Bosnia-Herzegovina were condemned in 
demonstrations held in various cities, especially in Ankara and 
Istanbul. 
  Thousands of people who gathered in Zafer Square in Kizilay, 
Ankara, chanted slogans condemning the Serbian massacres and the 
attitude of the United Nations. The citizens then started 
marching along Ataturk Boulevard to the UN representation in 
Ankara. They continued their protests there as well. Certain 
provocateurs in the crowd hurled stones, shattering some of the 
windows of the UN building. Despite these provocations, the 
people proceeded to Kocatepe Mosque following the appeasing 
remarks of Ankara Governor Erdogan Sahinoglu and Ankara Security 
Director Orhan Tasanlar, who arrived at the scene of the 
incident. 
  During the march, stones were thrown shattering the windows 
of the TRT General Directorate building, the U.S. Embassy, and 
the Russian Commercial Attache's Office. Some individuals 
climbed over the iron fence of the U.S. Embassy and entered the 
garden. They posted a flag at the main entrance of the U.S. 
Embassy and then left the garden. 
  In a statement to TRT, Sahinoglu said that efforts are under 
way to determine who is responsible for directing the course of 
events. Asking the citizens not to heed such provocations, 
Sahinoglu noted: I believe that with regard to international 
relations, which are sensitive, it is appropriate for us to 
display attitudes that are more careful, self-sacrificing, and 
befitting our traditions. I particularly ask our people not to 
heed provocations and such rumors. 
  The recent attack against Gorazde was also condemned in a 
demonstration held in Istanbul's Taksim Square. Groups, which 
gathered in Taksim Square at noon, shouted various slogans 
against the Serbs. The police did not intervene in the 
demonstration, which was held without a permit. Certain people 
attempted to behave in an excessive manner, however, attacking 
members of the press, who were filming the meeting, including 
TRT teams. The groups, which remained in Taksim Square for 
about three hours, later marched along Istiklal and Cumhuriyet 
Streets. Intensive security measures were adopted during these 
marches. A group proceeding towards Harbiye chanted slogans 
against TRT in front of the TRT Istanbul Radio building. The 
demonstrators shouted slogans against the UN, Israel, and the 
United States. [passage omitted]

  [Text] Security forces have captured 26 persons after 
determining that they caused an outbreak during an unauthorized 
demonstration in Ankara yesterday condemning the intense Serbian 
attack in Bosnia-Herzegovina. 
  According to a statement issued by the Ankara Governor's 
Office, it was determined that these persons provoked the crowd, 
and caused the stoning of the UN representation, the U.S. 
Embassy, the TRT General Directorate building, and the True Path 
Party headquarters. Noting that these persons were captured with 
Molotov cocktails, hammers, and assault knives in their 
possession, the statement adds that an investigation into the 
incident is under way. 
  On the other hand, an inquiry was started in Istanbul into 
the unauthorized demonstration condemning Serbian aggression 
which was held in Taksim. The Prosecutor's Office opened an 
investigation into two private television channels who aired the 
demonstration held in Taksim. Officials of the Bakirkoy and 
Kucukcekmece Chief Public Prosecutor's Office stated that they 
placed a request to TGRT [TURKIYE Radio and Television] and 
Inter Star for the videotapes of the demonstration. The 
officials stated that, if necessary, the concerned parties of 
the two private channels may be taken to court on charges of 
provoking and encouraging the public to commit crimes. 
  The authorities further stated that the slogans and placards 
used during the demonstration in Istanbul's Taksim Square are 
being analyzed and if found offensive necessary legal steps will 
be taken.

  [Text] Bosnia-Herzegovina Vice President Ejup Ganic and 
Foreign Affairs Minister Irfan Ljubijankic met with Foreign 
Minister Hikmet Cetin today. In a statement before the meeting, 
Cetin said that Turkey is pleased with the first step taken by 
the Bosnians and Croats toward coexistence, the Washington 
Agreement. 
  [Begin Cetin recording] We hope and wish, like Mr. Ganic 
said, that the other link of this development is completed soon, 
that is, that the Serbs also participate in this multiracial, 
multireligious, and multicultural independent Bosnia-Herzegovina 
federation. Turkey is continuing to conduct relations both with 
the officials of Bosnia-Herzegovina and with the Croats. We are 
also continuing to conduct a dialogue with the Serbs. [end

  Ganic said: Without the participation of Turkish diplomacy, 
it is impossible to achieve peace and stability in the Balkans.

  [Text] The Bosnian Administration has claimed that Serbs 
used chemical weapons against neighborhoods on the outskirts of 
Gorazde. Sarajevo Radio, citing statements issued by the 
presidential spokesman, announced that Serbs attacked Gorazde 
from three fronts and that there were large numbers of 
casualties. Western news agencies have carried stories 
regarding the issue based on the Sarajevo radio report. 
  Vice President Ejup Ganic, who is currently in Istanbul, has 
stated that news regarding chemical weapons being used against 
Gorazde has reached them as well. Ganic said that accurate 
information regarding the situation in the city and number of 
casualties will only be definite during the course of the day. 
  It is expected that Ganic will go to New York to take up the 
issue with the UN authorities. It was also reported that 
information confirming the use of chemical warfare by the Serbs 
against Gorazde has not reached the UN center in New York or the 
U.S. Administration. The Turkish Foreign Ministry has started 
intensive contacts to investigate the truth behind the claims 
that chemical weapons were used against Gorazde -- a region 
inside the United Nations declared safe area. 
  Foreign Minister Hikmet Cetin said that Turkey will submit a 
request calling for an extraordinary meeting of the UN Security 
Council in case the claims regarding chemical warfare are 
accurate. In a statement he issued to TRT last night, Cetin said 
that a possible NATO air operation may be discussed if the 
claims are correct.

  [Text] Ankara (AA) -- Israeli Foreign Minister Shim'on 
Peres arrived on a two-day official visit in Ankara today. 
  The Israeli foreign minister was received at Ankara's 
Esenboga Airport by Foreign Minister Hikmet Cetin. In an 
airport statement, Cetin recalled that the framework of the 
relations between the two countries was outlined in a 
declaration during his visit to Tel Aviv in November. Pointing 
out that Peres is an important and well-known personality in the 
region as well as in the world, Cetin reported that bilateral 
relations, regional issues, and the Middle East peace process 
will be discussed during the talks in Ankara. 
  Turkey and Israel are two countries based on parliamentary 
democracy and free market economy, Cetin remarked. Recalling 
that the Israeli president also visited Turkey some time ago, 
Cetin noted that these visits greatly contribute to bilateral 
relations. 
  Cetin declared that Peres plays an important role in the 
Middle East peace process and said that the visit will add a new 
dimension to Turkish-Israeli relations. 
  In his turn, Peres stated that the Middle East peace process 
has reached the stage of implementation, pledging that from now 
on his country will work for the economic development of the 
region to benefit of the people living in this region. 
  Peres said that Turkey is a bridge between the Middle East, 
Europe, and Asia, and it is the most contemporary country among 
the Muslim countries where religion and state are separated. 
Remarking that the two countries share a common history as well 
as common interests, the Israeli foreign minister underlined the 
great potential for cooperation in bilateral relations. 
  Meanwhile, in reply to a question, Cetin declared that 
Turkey 
is ready to contribute to the Middle East peace process in every 
possible way if both sides demand it.

  [Text] Ankara--Zubeyir Aydar, DEP [Democracy Party] 
parliamentarian from Siirt, said that despite insufficient 
information in the United States on human rights and the Kurdish 
problem in Turkey, a new approach has now emerged. 
  Aydar indicated that the officials whom they met during 
their 
time in the United States said that the Kurdish problem cannot 
be solved by military methods and that they favor a political 
solution. 
  During their contacts in the United States, DEP Siirt 
parliamentarian Zubeyir Aydar, DEP Adiyaman parliamentarian 
Mahmut Kilinc, and former Diyarbakir Mayor Mehdi Zana met David 
M. Winn, chief of the State Department's Southern Europe Desk; 
his future replacement John Hamilton; Nancy H. Ely Raphel [name 
as published], chief of the State Department's Human Rights 
Desk; Lee Hamilton, chairman of the House Foreign Relations 
Committee; Claiborne Pell, chairman of the Senate Foreign 
Relations Committee; Steny Hamilton Hoyer, a congressman and 
chairman of the CSCE Helsinki Human Rights Commission; Senator 
Dennis DeConcini; Congressman Bill Bray; and representatives of 
the American Democracy Fund, various democratic organizations, 
and the press. 
  Aydar said that during their contacts they were asked 
questions on human rights in Turkey, the Kurdish problem, 
attacks on parties, the lifting of parliamentarians' immunity, 
and the situation in prisons and that views were exchanged. 
<H5>  A New Approach in the State Department and Senate </H5>
  In referring to their talks with the State Department and 
Senate circles, Aydar said that, despite the fact that these 
circles have insufficient information on human rights and the 
Kurdish problem in Turkey, they have adopted a new approach. 
Aydar said that before the U.S. officials supported Turkey 
under any conditions but that they are now looking at Turkish 
policy with a critical eye and are particularly sensitive to the 
Kurdish problem. He said: "They said that the Kurdish problem 
cannot be solved militarily and that it must have a political 
solution. We felt that in the future they will give more 
emphasis to the Kurdish problem in their relations with Turkey. 
Their general approach on the Kurdish problem is that it should 
have a political solution within the borders of Turkey." 
  Indicating that the main theme of their contacts was to 
contribute to the democratization of Turkey and a democratic 
solution to the Kurdish problem, Aydar said: "While we were 
there the pro-state press here reported that `they remained in 
the open, no one was interested in them or talked to them.' 
These were unfounded and concocted reports serving the 
psychological warfare. There was no truth to them. Our contacts 
were conducted in an extremely warm atmosphere and their results 
will be clearly seen in the future."

  [Text] Prime Minister Tansu Ciller has said that close 
cooperation will be conducted with Turk-Is [Turkish 
Confederation of Labor] on issues concerning the labor sector, 
without changing the targets of the stability program. 
  Ciller received Turk-Is leader Bayram Meral and Secretary 
General Semsi Denizer at the prime ministerial residence and 
discussed the stability program with them. In a statement after 
the meeting, Ciller said that she will benefit from the views of 
Turk-Is regarding this issue, and that the Turk-Is proposals 
will be studied. 
  [Begin Ciller recording] We will work together with them on 
every single issue. We will study every single thing that can 
be done in line with their requests, without changing the 
targets of the program. We will do that on the basis of the 
entire issue of the public economic enterprises. We will start 
to work in very close cooperation as soon as possible. [end 
recording] 
  The prime minister stressed that unless measures are taken, 
more workers will be without jobs in the future. The basis of 
our efforts, she said, is to minimize the suffering of the 
workers, and to create jobs for more youths in the future. 
  [Begin Ciller recording] The aim is never to leave such 
problems for our workers in the coming years. To achieve that, 
we will discuss these issues together. Meral had very valuable 
and good proposals to make. I gave instructions for all these 
proposals to be studied one by one. This cooperation will 
continue in the coming months. I want to state once again that 
we will not make our workers suffer. We will ensure that they 
get their legal rights in the best way, always, and under all 
conditions. [end recording] 
  The Turk-Is leader said that if his proposals and views are 
taken into consideration, the problems and difficulties of the 
workers will be minimized. 
  In a statement to the press while leaving the residence, 
Bayram Meral said that the prime minister thought Turk-Is' views 
were reasonable and appropriate. He pointed out that Turk-Is' 
requests in connection with the public economic enterprises will 
be taken into consideration. 
  [Begin Meral recording] Turk-Is and the government will sit 
around the table and try to minimize the problems by studying 
every single installation. In this way we will minimize the 
workers' suffering to almost no suffering at all. I hope we 
will succeed. We told our prime minister of our views. She said 
that she considers our views very positive and serious. We were 
happy to hear that. The prime minister instructed State 
Minister Datca to convene a meeting in a short time. [end 
recording] 
  Replying to a question, Meral said that if the problems are 
not solved, the decisions of the Turk-Is leaders council will be 
implemented. 
  Asked if the planned labor actions were postponed, Meral 
said: No. The Turk-Is leaders council has set up an action 
committee. The action committee will meet on Tuesday. The 
decisions it will reach will be implemented to the letter.

<F P=106> [Announcer-read report over video] </F>
  [Text] Prime Minister Tansu Ciller has said that the 
government prepared the economic stability program to ensure the 
prosperity of the citizens and to prevent blocking economic 
progress for the country. 
  Tansu Ciller visited Democratic Left Party leader Bulent 
Ecevit in the latter's office in parliament in order to hear his 
views and proposals regarding the economic stability program. 
She pointed out that the country has serious problems that 
piled up over the years. We were forced to take certain measures 
to overcome them, she said, adding that similar problems emerge 
in other countries as well. 
  [Begin Ciller recording] There might be people who think 
that the type of measures we are taking could be different. 
However, we all have the same basic aims and desires: the 
prosperity of our people, to open the way for this prosperity, 
to prevent blocking economic progress before the country, to 
create more jobs for our youths in the future, to enable 
investments, to prevent the stopping of growth, to prevent a 
three-digit and eventually a four-digit inflation. [end 
recording] 
  Ciller said that she will hear Ecevit's views on the 
economic 
stability program and on the installations in Zonguldak. We 
will benefit from these views most extensively, she said. 
  Ecevit said that the economy is going through the most 
difficult period in the history of the republic. He stressed 
that the burden must be shared justly. He said he will explain 
his views specifically and as positively as possible to the 
prime minister, and that he will posit his criticism and 
proposals. 
  [Begin Ecevit recording] Turkey is growing fast as far as 
its population growth and social dynamism are concerned. We are 
concerned, however, that the economic measures being taken might 
cause problems in the economy in the future. Specifically 
slowing down production, preventing new investments, and 
restricting current investments might cause certain problems for 
a country whose population growth is about 2.17 percent. [end 
recording] 
  Ecevit pointed out that the Karabuk Iron and Steel Works can 
be made much more productive by means of certain additional 
investments, and that it would not be right to completely close 
the Zonguldak Coal Works. 
  After the 90-minute meeting, Ciller said that she got what 
she hoped for from her search for a social consensus for the 
economic stability package. She said that she is briefing all 
the sectors of the society on the package and continuing to 
carry it out without changing the aims of the program. She 
pointed out that she listened to Ecevit's views who also posited 
some good proposals. We will study these proposals, she said. 
  Replying to a question on the workers' reaction, Ciller 
stressed that she is open to dialogue. We will eliminate all 
misunderstandings, she said. 
  [Begin Ciller recording] As I said, before, the aim is the 
prosperity of the Turkish people. We were forced to take 
certain measures. We took them. While implementing them, we 
will discuss them with everyone. [end recording] 
  In a statement after the meeting, Ecevit said that by making 
promises left, right, and center before the elections, the 
parties put both themselves and the country in a difficult 
positions. The people are now being asked to pay the price for 
this negative process, he said. 
  Ecevit stressed that the coal mines and the iron and steel 
industry are of strategic importance for Turkey's independence. 
He added that he told the prime minister that it would be very 
wrong to entirely close the Zonguldak Coal Mines and the Karabuk 
Iron and Steel Works.

<F P=106> [Report by Sezai Sengun: "Argument on Arms Under Threat of </F>
Embargo"] 
  [Text] Ankara--Ankara does not regard seriously the rumors 
of a possible European arms embargo against Turkey because of 
the Kurdish problem. The officials of the Defense Industry 
Undersecretariat [DIU] have said that far from moving to impose 
an arms embargo, the European countries are competing with each 
other to sell their arms to Turkey. Recalling that France will 
sell Super Puma helicopters to Turkey in 1995, the DIU officials 
asserted: "They struggled for many months to sell those 
helicopters. Will they now decide to inform Turkey that they 
won't? The European countries will not find it easy to decide 
to impose an arms embargo on Turkey with their arms industries 
in difficulty. No one should be worried by the rumors, which 
have been circulated by a few irresponsible deputies who support 
the Workers Party of Kurdistan." 
  The same officials said that Turkey and Germany are working 
on projects relating to frigates, submarines, and other weapon 
systems. As for Britain, they asserted that the two countries 
are only working on a project relating to HF-SSB communication 
systems. The officials asserted: "Almost all the arms used by 
the security forces in southeast Turkey have either been 
manufactured locally or acquired from sources other than 
Germany. Turkey has been acquiring BRT-60 armored vehicles, 
causing significant argument by the Russian Federation. The 
security forces will not be helpless if Europe moves to impose 
an arms embargo on Turkey." 
  Although the DIU officials have said they do not regard the 
rumors of a possible embargo by the European countries 
seriously, they have stressed that a similar reaction by the 
United States may cause a problem. For example, Turkish 
military aircraft may find it difficult to fulfill their 
missions.

  [Text] Ankara, April 9 (A.A) -- The Russian Federation 
agreed on transmitting the Kazakh and Azeri oil through Turkey 
by pipelines instead of the straits. 
  Deputy Premier Murat Karayalcin told a press conference 
today 
that the Russian Federation which had so far opposed changing 
its route, had, for the first time accepted not to use the 
straits. 
  During talks between 4 and 7 April in Moscow, the first 
deputy premier [title as received] Shokhin told Turkish 
officials that he favored the Turkish proposal. 
  Turkish, Russian, U.S., Kazakh and Azeri officials will 
convene in Ankara at the end of this month or in May to discuss 
the details of this new plan, Karayalcin added. 
  Giving account on the Russian-Turkish joint economic 
protocol 
signed in Moscow, Karayalcin said that this protocol was to be a 
milestone in relations. 
  Russia assured Turkey in the talks that it will not 
interrupt 
its 6 billion cubic meters of annual natural gas supply to 
Turkey from now on and agreed on increasing this amount 2 
billion cubic meters more for each year. 
  Karayalcin said that the frequent accidents taking place 
recently in the Bosporus strait have justified the Turkish 
thesis that the strait was not convenient for such an intensive 
traffic. 
  Turkey had to close the Bosporus strait shut for a few days 
in March after 20 people died when a Greek Cypriot tanker 
carrying Russian crude oil collided a Greek Cypriot cargo 
vessel. Sixteen seamen were also lost on the 30 km (19 mile) 
Bosporus which dissects the 10-million-population Istanbul. The 
accident was the worst in the Bosporus since a 1979 collision 
when an oil tanker exploded, killing 43 seamen. 
  Turkey, worried about environmental risks, unveiled new 
safety rules for the straits in January and will enforce them on 
July 1.

<F P=106> ["Yes, No" column by Oktay Akbal: "To the Front of 80 </F>
Percent"] 
  [Excerpt] Some 80 percent of the electorate is in favor of 
a secular republic. Only 19 percent of the people support the 
Prosperity Party [PP]. I believe that it is wrong to panic over 
the local election results. No party can come to power with a 
20 percent vote in any country. Even if it does, it cannot 
remain in power. 
  The Turkish nation expressed its real belief with its votes. 
Some 80 percent of our people proved that they are against 
fundamentalism and anachronism. So why this fear of the PP in 
all the cities and towns? 
  To tell you the truth, the PP victory in the big cities has 
jolted certain circles back to reality. It was obvious that the 
PP which raised militants in mosques, religious schools, and in 
every street in the cities for years would collect many votes in 
the first elections to come along. The first step in this 
direction was taken when the PP won the municipal elections in 
six Istanbul districts a year and a half ago. 
  We warned both the social democrats and the liberals. The 
secular and pro-Ataturk voters are always strong and faithful. 
Unfortunately, the parties are divided both at the center right 
and at the center left. The electorate was forced to divide its 
vote among the True Path Party, the Motherland Party and the 
Nationalist Action Party in the right, and among the Social 
Democratic Populist Party, the Democratic Left Party, and the 
Republican People's Party in the left. 
  The total number of votes the rightist parties received was 
50 percent, and the total number of votes the leftist parties 
received was 25 percent. The PP only got 19 percent throughout 
Turkey. 
  The division in the right and left was certainly going to 
lead to such results. If the PP is singing with the joy of 
victory today it is thanks to the pretentious party leaders who 
do not know what they are doing, not thanks to the voters. 
These leaders who caused the defeat of their parties as well as 
the pro-Ataturk masses in the country should not be allowed to 
remain in the political arena. The party grassroots will sooner 
or later find the way of getting rid of the current leaders; 
they must. [passage omitted]

  [Text] Ankara, April 8, IRNA -- The English Turkish DAILY 
NEWS on Friday printed the text of an interview with the Iranian 
ambassador to Ankara, Mohammad Reza Baqeri at which he has said 
Iran had delivered to the Turkish Government those of the 
Turkish dissidents that engaged in anti-Turkish activities on 
the Iranian soil. 
  The Iranian ambassador has said that Iran's position towards 
her neighbor Turkey in that respect remains unchanged. He has 
expressed hope that the cooperation between Iran and Turkey 
would serve as a model for other regional countries. 
  Baqeri has said Turkish Police Chief Mehmet Aghar will visit 
Tehran shortly within the context of security collaboration 
between the two countries. He has said that Iran and Turkey 
have common enemies, among them those who support the idea of 
the creation of an independent Kurdish government. 
  Referring to the Zionist regime and Turkey's relations with 
that regime, the Iranian ambassador has said that the foreign 
policy of the Turkish Government is the business of that 
government, but he has commented that the Zionist regime is not 
to be trusted. 
  Baqeri has also commended the part being played in Central 
Asia jointly by Iran and Turkey, saying that their cooperation 
is already nearing its fruition. He has said that the transfer 
of Turkmenistan's gas to Turkey and Europe across the Iranian 
soil is simply one of the good results of that cooperation. 
  The Iranian official has also praised Turkey for 
contributing 
to peace-keeping troops in Bosnia-Herzegovina. 
  According to Baqeri a delegation from Turkish Ministry of 
Industries is to visit Tehran in two months within the context 
of an interim agreement on mutual cooperation on the manufacture 
of automotive parts.

<H5>  There Will Be an Explosion in Terrorism Around the World </H5>
  The Iranian Revolutionary Guards, the Armenian Secret Army 
ASALA, the German and Japanese Red Armies, Red Brigades, Islamic 
Jihad, and Abu-Nidal's groups took part in the secret meeting 
held recently. Plans were made at the meeting, chaired by the 
heads of the Iranian and Libyan intelligence organizations, for 
operations that would soak the world in blood within a short 
period. The organizations were assigned duties for armed and 
bomb attacks. 
<H5>  The Bloody ASALA is Again on the Scene </H5>
  The wife of ASALA terrorist Agopyan, who was murdered in 
Athens in 1988, also took part in the meeting as the leader of 
that organization. Agopyan's wife, who met with the prominent 
intelligence officer in Tehran 'Ali Falahian recently, obtained 
great support also from the other bloody terror organizations 
during the meeting in Nicosia. The meeting, during which Tehran 
exerted enormous pressure to revive ASALA, promised to provide 
every assistance to this bloody organization to organize itself 
in many European countries. 
<H5>  [Box p.20] </H5>
<H5>  Mu'ammar al-Qadhdhafi is Greatest Supporter </H5>
  Libyan leader Mu'ammar al-Qadhdhafi occupies the leading 
place on the United States' list of terrorist countries. In an 
interview in NEWSWEEK magazine last week, he described some 
organizations known to be terrorist groups around the world as 
freedom fighters. In his interview al-Qadhdhafi said: "This is 
one of the misconceptions about my person in the minds of the 
Americans. Neither Ahmad Jibril nor Abu-Nidal are terrorists. 
They are fighters for a sacred cause." 
<H5>  Their First Act Took Place in Corsica </H5>
  The decisions adopted in Nicosia made themselves felt. The 
shootings and bombings last night following the detention of 14 
members of the "Corsica National Liberation Front," which 
struggles for the liberation of the island, while preparing to 
carry out a bombing in the French island of Corsica on Sunday 
night, is believed to have been carried out by the same 
organization." 
<H5>  Meeting on "How We Must Soak the World in </H5>
Blood" 
  The latest meeting in Nicosia in the Greek Cypriot sector, 
which has become the capital of terrorist organizations in 
recent years, was hair-raising. The leaders of the world's most 
bloody terror organizations examined and discussed how to spread 
terror over Europe and other countries. The meeting's outcome 
was even more frightening: "The world will be soaked in blood 
this year!"

  [Text] The security forces have found the body of 
Abdulvahap Akar, the chief Prosperity Party [PP] official for 
Igdir Province, who was kidnaped by terrorists a while ago. The 
body was found on the Igdir-Karalik highway. Akar was also the 
PP candidate for mayor in the recent local elections. 
  Meanwhile, one of the terrorists who martyred First 
Lieutenant Cevdet Cifcti while he was on patrol in the city of 
Igdir last month has been caught in Ankara. The terrorist was 
taken to Igdir and arrested. Igdir Governor Semsettin Uzun said 
that this terrorist forced shopkeepers to shut down, extorted 
money for the organization from citizens, and recruited members. 
In searches conducted following his interrogation, the security 
forces found a Kalashnikov rifle. 
  Twelve terrorists were killed in clashes conducted between 
security forces and terrorists in Andac in Sirnak and near Genc 
District in Bingol. Two members of the security forces were 
martyred in the clash near Sirnak. A terrorist surrendered to 
the security forces in Tatvan District in Bitlis. 
  The security forces killed 271 terrorists and captured 63 
terrorists in Erzurum, Kars, Ardahan, Igdir, and Agri Provinces 
during the past three months. The security forces also captured 
215 persons for abetting the terrorists. 
  According to information received from the governors of 
these 
provinces, during the operations the security forces seized 122 
rifles, 15 rocket launchers, 47 hand grenades, two assault 
rifles, two SA-16 missiles, 18 pistols, and large amounts of 
ammunition. The 37 shelters uncovered in the region were 
destroyed, along with the food, clothing, and medical equipment 
found in them.

  [Excerpt] Portuguese EC Commissioner Joao de Deus Pinheiro 
stated that the trade embargo imposed by Greece on The Former 
Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia [FYROM] is illegal and a shot in 
the foot of the present European presidency. In an exclusive 
interview with Renascenca, Deus Pinheiro states categorically 
that the Macedonia issue poisoned things during the Greek 
presidency: 
  [Deus Pinheiro] They have let things be poisoned by the 
Macedonia issue and have created some friction both in relations 
with the member states and in the relations of the presidency 
with other institutions. Thus a decision by the Commission 
yesterday to take the case of The Former Yugoslav Republic of 
Macedonia to the court of justice. 
  I believe that this decision by the Greek Government to 
impose a trade embargo on The Former Yugoslav Republic of 
Macedonia--as far as I am concerned--is not only illegal in 
terms of Community law but also, politically, a shot in the foot. 
  [Annuoncer] That was Joao de Deus Pinheiro in an exclusive 
interview with Renascenca which will be broadcast in its 
entirety tomorrow in the Por Ca e Por La program, at 1100 hours.

  [Text] The first planes have taken off this morning. The 
operation to evacuate 1,500 Belgian nationals from Rwanda was 
authorized by the government. The first Hercules C-130s took 
off this morning. For now, they mostly seem to be carrying 
equipment. We're joined from Melsbroek by Thierry Belfroi. Have 
more planes been taking off? 
  [Melroi] Yes, four planes have taken off since 0715. Convoys 
have been arriving at the military airport here in Meulebroek 
throughout the night -- military equipment and jeeps. There 
have not yet been any troops. The latest news we have received 
from the Tielen barracks from where the paracommandos are 
expected to arrive at about 0930 this morning is that their 
departure from the barracks has been delayed by at least one or 
two hours. Journalists are being kept away from the barracks, 
and it is very difficult to get any information. There are 
stilll four C-130s on the apron ready to take off with 
equipment, and two Boeing 727s, which are waiting to take off 
with the troops which are expected. We're also expecting troops 
from Flawinne in the course of the afternoon.

  [Text] And there have, of course, also been initial 
reactions to the NATO air strike from Bonn. The German 
Government is hoping for concessions from the Serbs and a 
continuation of the cease-fire talks in the former Yugoslavia. 
Government spokesman Dieter Vogel said, and I quote: the 
attackers of Gorazde only have themselves to blame for this 
response from NATO, which was carried out on behalf of the 
United Nations.

<F P=106> ["rmc"-signed report: "BDI for Relaxing Arms Exports"] </F>
  [Text] Bonn -- The Federation of German Industries (BDI) 
has demanded a relaxation of the strict German arms export 
regulations. The demand was precipitated by the government's 
new white book on security policy and Bundeswehr matters that 
declares the existence of a "modern, competitive, and efficient 
arms industry to be a part of security precautions." The BDI 
tells Bonn that this is "not possible at zero cost and without 
political compromise within the alliance in adjusting arms 
regulations." The BDI refers to the uncompromising position of 
some important European partner countries that have refused to 
follow the strict German regulations. The German arms industry 
will only regain its international competitiveness if the 
Federal Government abolishes "the marked disadvantage that 
German companies are experiencing."

  [Excerpts] The next government will be finalized shortly. 
At Pontida, Umberto Bossi obtained the go-ahead from the 
Northern League to form a majority government with Forza Italia 
and the National Alliance. Silvio Berlusconi said in Rome that 
the next government would be a centrist one, but Gianfranco 
Fini, stressed that the next government would be a center-right 
one. From tomorrow the delegations from the Freedom Alliance, 
comprising Forza Italia and the Northern League, and the Good 
Government Alliance, comprising Forza Italia and the National 
Alliance, will begin work in order to choose the Chamber of 
Deputies and Senate speakers. Our correspondents have the 
details. [passage omitted] 
  After having injected his followers with hefty doses of 
Northern League pride, Umberto Bossi announced that at the next 
European and local elections in June, the Northern League would 
field its own candidates running under its own symbol. [passage 
omitted] 
  [Begin Berlusconi recording, shown addressing Reform Party 
congress] The task that this government faces is extremely 
difficult. We have inherited a disastrous situation. I have 
begun to look closely at the state account books. I am looking 
at them as though they were company books, and let me tell you, 
the situation is sickening. [end recording] [passage omitted] 
  [Begin Marco Pannella recording, addressing Reform Party 
congress] The Northern League was the first political 
organization, which along with us, asked for that which today 
Forza Italia, Silvio Berlusconi, and the country is saying is 
the best method. [end recording] 
  [Correspondent Margherita Ghinassi, over video] As far as 
Silvio Berlusconi is concerned, Marco Pannella is turning out to 
be an indispensable ally. He is the catalyst for those 
parliamentarians elected on reform lists, and he has the support 
of certain socialist, liberal, and environmental factions. He 
wants to be the left-wing extreme of the future government 
majority. Berlusconi agrees with him. He wants to have a link 
with Mario Segni's Pact for Italy, and with that faction of the 
left which, he says, does not want to have anything to do with 
the Party of the Democratic Left. [passage omitted] 
  [Correspondent Mauro Mazza, over video] Gianfranco Fini is 
not worried by this business of forming a centrist government. 
In fact he appears happy because at the end of the day, he 
explained, it will be Silvio Berlusconi who will steer a center 
course. However, the coalition will be made up of this center 
and the right, where Fini believes, the space for the National 
Alliance will be even greater. Tomorrow, the negotiations will 
be more serious. There will be talks on the next Chamber of 
Deputies and Senate speakers. It appears probable that both 
speakers will come from the Freedom Alliance. 
  The Freedom Alliance now appears ready to get off the 
ground. 
Pierferdinando Casini from the Christian Democrat Center Party, 
said finally things were running smoothly. He commented that 
Bossi had finished chasing after rainbows. [passage omitted] 
  The Left is attempting to put something together. Ottaviano 
Del Turco, the secretary of the Italian Socialist Party, 
suggested that an intelligent opposition must be formed to fight 
those that he called the illusionists and mountebanks of the 
Freedom Alliance. 
  The leader of La Rete, Leoluca Orlando, called for the 
establishment of a great, democratic united party. 
  The Party of the Democratic Left and its representative 
Fassino, welcomed the invitation of Mino Martinazzoli to take 
part in a united way in the 25 April demonstrations [Liberation 
Day]. Fassino said that the new alliance could get off the 
ground then.

  [Excerpt] Ankara (AA) -- Prime Minister Tansu Ciller has 
condemned the chemical attack on the Bosnian city of Gorazde by 
the Serbs. She said: "Our government is following the 
developments with utmost care and is conducting the necessary 
contacts." 
  Ciller issued a statement in connection with the 
developments 
in Gorazde. 
  According to the Prime Minister's Press Center, the 
statement 
is as follows: 
  "To my great horror and regret, I have learned that today 
the 
Serbs used chemical weapons against the town of Gorazde in 
Bosnia-Herzegovina, which has been subjected to an inhuman siege 
by the Serbs for a long time, and that many civilians, children, 
and elderly people were killed in this attack. 
  ``I strongly condemn this attack, which is difficult to 
believe and constitutes a crime against humanity, on behalf of 
my government and myself. We want the international community, 
particularly the United Nations and NATO, to take the necessary 
steps without any further delay to put an end to the suffering 
of the people of Bosnia-Herzegovina and punish the culprits. 
Our government is following the developments with utmost care 
and is conducting the necessary contacts. 
  ``I pray for those who lost their lives in this attack and I 
wish the wounded a speedy recovery. I extend my deepest 
solidarity to the victims' families.'' [passage omitted]
