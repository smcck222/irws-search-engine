<F P=106> [Report by Renate Koecher: "Chancellor Leaps Forward"] </F>
  [Text] For two years, moods in the old and new laender 
were at a low point. But then change occurred in the beginning 
of 1994. In the minds of many Germans, cautious optimism took 
the place of debilitating pessimism. Since then, the number of 
survey respondents who consider the situation in Germany 
alarming has been sinking from one month to the next. Heading 
in the same direction are fears that the government is incapable 
of action; whereas in February, 27 percent of the respondents 
were very concerned about the government's ability to act, in 
April only 22 percent entertained such a fear. The first signs 
of an economic improvement are fuelling public opinions. In 
January, in the old laender, 48 percent of respondents still 
feared the situation would deteriorate further. Only 17 percent 
expected a moderate improvement. On the other hand, in April 
only 32 percent of west German respondents and 29 percent of 
east German respondents considered the economic prospects grim. 
The population seems to be heaving a sigh of relief. Obviously 
it thinks the worst has already been left behind. 
  This improvement in moods also means a better starting 
position for the government. Support for Chancellor Kohl's 
policies has been growing slowly but surely for months. Kohl's 
challenger, SPD [Social Democratic Party of Germany] chairman 
Scharping, might still be ahead of Kohl in the popularity 
charts, but the graphs showing people's choice of chancellor 
display a similar trend to that of previous election years. 
Already in the past, Helmut Kohl started off from a seemingly 
hopeless position and yet managed to race ahead of others. 
Since January, Scharping's lead in the old laender has fallen 
from 9 to 6 percent, mainly because of increased popularity for 
Kohl, but also because of increased reservations about Scharping. 
  Scharping has been collecting minus points over the past few 
months, especially in the old laender. In January, 29 percent 
of the west German population still agreed with his line, 18 
percent criticized it, and 53 percent had no fixed opinion. But 
today, more people claim to know what Scharping stands for, 
which works to his disadvantage because the number of people 
supportive of his line remains at a constant 29 percent, but the 
number of people critical of him has risen from 18 to 29 percent 
over the past 10 weeks. Only in the new laender do the people 
who approve of Scharping (24 percent of survey respondents) 
outnumber those who do not (17 percent). 
  So far, the growing criticism of the SPD chairman has had no 
effect on his party. For the second time this year, the SPD 
enjoys a measure of support exceeding 40 percent. Over the past 
few weeks, the SPD has increased its popularity rating by 2.3 
percent, whereas the Christian Democratic Union/Christian 
Socialist union, also at a low level, have increased theirs by 
2.4 percent. Both the people's parties together would receive 
about 75 percent of the vote right now. Following the outcome 
of the Lower Saxony vote, this is yet another indication that it 
is too early to say that the people's parties are finished. 
According to surveys, the Free Democrats would achieve 8 
percent of the vote, and the Greens/Alliance 90 would receive 10 
percent. The extremist parties, the Republikaner and the 
Democratic Socialist Party, have no chances whatsoever at 
present.

<F P=106> [Martina Fietz report: "FDP Quarrels About Coalition"] </F>
  [Excerpt] Bonn -- Helmut Kohl, chairman of the Christian 
Democratic Union [CDU] and the German chancellor, yesterday 
expressly thanked the Free Democratic Party of Germany [FDP] for 
its intention, expressed the day before, to continue the 
coalition with the CDU/Christian Social Union [CSU] after the 
Bundestag elections in October. 
  During the first coalition meeting after the Easter break, 
Kohl assessed the decision by the FDP Presidium as a signal that 
there is the determination to achieve goals together. The 
"spirit of comradely togetherness" will lead to success at the 
elections. 
  At the same time, a quarrel broke out in the FDP about the 
coalition statement in favor of the CDU/CSU. Juergen 
Moellemann, chairman of the largest FDP land association, that 
of North Rhine-Westphalia, demanded that the statement in favor 
of the CDU and the CSU be linked with conditions. There must 
not be a "blank check for the CDU/CSU." Moellemann suggested 
that at the party congress in Rostock at the beginning of July a 
"statement of preference" should be made, which must be linked 
to "specific basic topics." FDP Bundestag Deputy Gerhart Baum 
said that the coalition statement was made too early. 
  Yesterday FDP Chairman Klaus Kinkel refused to comment on 
Moellemann's demands. According to the decision of the FDP 
Presidium, now there has to be a wait until the meeting of the 
Federal Executive Committee on 2 May and the party congress. 
Hermann Otto Solms, chairman of the FDP Bundestag group, stated 
that the formulation of the election statement must "in no case" 
contain options for other government alliances. His deputy, 
Wolfgang Weng, called on the party to refrain from any 
speculations about other constellations for a potential 
government. [passage omitted]

<F P=106> [Interview with SPD General Manager Guenter Verheugen by </F>
Ulrich Rosenbaum in Bonn; date not given: "`SPD Does Not Need a 
Coalition Statement'"] 
  [Text] [Rosenbaum] Did the time and contents of the Free 
Democratic Party of Germany's [FDP] coalition statement come as 
a surprise? 
  [Verheugen] No. There had been signs for a couple of weeks. 
The FDP was under very strong pressure. If anything did come as 
a surprise it was that Mr. Kinkel has created the impression 
that it is a statement without if's and but's. 
  [Rosenbaum] Does this mean you expect a loophole in the 
final wording? 
  [Verheugen] It will not really be a matter of wording in the 
end. I am sure that the coalition will not win a majority on 16 
October and that the role that the FDP would like to play is 
over. It is no longer the link between the popular parties that 
it used to be. It has lost its position as third party. 
  [Rosenbaum] What do you think the FDP's reaction will be if 
the election produces the result that you expect? 
  [Verheugen] If the Bundestag elections produce a result that 
enables the Social Democratic Party of Germany [SPD] to form a 
majority either with the Greens or the FDP, and if there is no 
longer a majority between the Christian Democratic Union 
[CDU]/Christian Social Union [CSU] and the FDP, the FDP will not 
turn a deaf ear to talks. It would be very unwise to do so. 
  [Rosenbaum] Does this mean that the SPD is counting on the 
FDP to be available as a coalition partner? 
  [Verheugen] We are not counting on any coalition partners in 
this election campaign. We are not conducting a coalition 
election campaign, but we have only ruled out a grand coalition 
and talks with right-wing extremists, whom we will be able to 
prevent from entering the Bundestag, as well as with the Party 
of Democratic Socialism. But all the others -- and this leaves 
only two -- are parties that we can talk to. 
  [Rosenbaum] How do you see the [FDP's] statement that the 
presidential election is not a preliminary decision for the 
Bundestag elections? 
  [Verheugen] This is a piece of very interesting and 
important information. I think that with this decision the FDP 
has gained full freedom of action. For, it has achieved a 
situation where the presidential elections need not be seen in 
connection with a coalition statement. Without an FDP coalition 
statement or without this particular statement, an FDP decision 
in favor of Johannes Rau in the second or third vote in Berlin 
would, of course, have been considered an indication of an 
intended coalition change. No one can say that now. 
  [Rosenbaum] You are counting on the FDP to vote for Rau? 
  [Verheugen] This way the FDP could demonstrate its liberal 
independence and show that it does not want to be completely 
under the CDU's tutelage. 
  [Rosenbaum] Do you seriously believe that you can survive 
without a clear coalition statement? 
  [Verheugen] A big popular party does not have to make a 
coalition statement. The SPD is going into this election with 
the intention of becoming the strongest party, of forming the 
government. This means, providing the chancellor and 
determining the guidelines of policies. And the question of a 
partner, if you need one, can only be determined by evaluating 
how the highest possible degree of social democratic policy can 
be achieved. We do not want to be implementing another party's 
policy. I cannot see the necessity or the benefit of the SPD 
making a coalition statement. We will not be conducting the 
election campaign as one part of a party constellation against 
another party constellation. We are conducting the election 
campaign to realize our objectives. All the others are fellow 
candidates to whom we are not giving any presents.

<F P=106> [Karin Adelmann report: "Bonn Fights Reasons for Flight"] </F>
  [Text] Bonn, 12 April -- According to UN estimates, about 
100 million people are fleeing from their homes. By the turn of 
the millennium the number of refugees may have increased to half 
a billion, the International Red Cross fears. Against this 
background, Development Minister Carl-Dieter Spranger (Christian 
Social Union) presented a concept on "refugee policy within the 
framework of development cooperation" on Tuesday [12 April], 
which aims at fighting the reasons for flight and at promoting 
the chances of returning. The program continues the refugee 
concept that was adopted by the Federal Cabinet in September 
1990. 
  "There is an ethical and humane obligation to prevent people 
from having to leave their homes against their will," Spranger 
said during the presentation of the concept, "and there is an 
ethical and humane obligation to help people who are on the 
run." However, helping refugees is also important purely from 
the point of view of development policy, because the refugees 
are mostly the most mobile and energetic part of a population. 
They are people who are needed most urgently for the 
development of their countries of origin. A program that 
provides start-up aid for returnees is aimed especially at 
skilled workers so that they can use the skills that they have 
developed in Germany in their own country. Thus, jointly 
financed loan funds for helping people found a new existence 
have been established together with Chile, Eritrea, Turkey, 
Slovenia, and Vietnam. In 1993, 505 companies founded by 
returnees were supported in Vietnam alone and more than 6,000 
jobs were created. This year about 70 million German marks [DM] 
are available for this aid to returnees. 
  In total, the Federal Ministry for Economic Cooperation and 
Development (BMZ) spent about DM490 million on refugee-related 
measures in 1993. In addition, about DM100 million was spent 
within the framework of the European Union. Focal areas of the 
BMZ are southeastern Europe and northern Africa, as well as the 
regions of the horn of Africa and Afghanistan/Pakistan, which 
are particularly affected by refugee crises. 
  Social Democratic Party of Germany development expert 
Ingomar 
Hauchler criticized the concept as insufficient. Spranger's 
ideas are, in addition, suspected of being a "mere instrument of 
isolation" against people.

<F P=106> [Hans-Juergen Mahnke report: "Optimist Rexrodt: No Boom, </F>
But Upswing"] 
  [Text] Bonn -- Even though FRG Economics Minister Guenter 
Rexrodt does not predict a boom in Germany for this year, he 
does predict a moderate upswing. "I am quite sure of it." In 
contrast to the pessimistic announcements from the economic 
associations upon the presentation of the annual economic report 
in January, Rexrodt thinks that a growth of 1 to 1.5 percent 
across Germany is likely. The growth in the west will be between 
0.5 and 1 percent and in the east between 6 and 8 percent. 
"Possibly, this is the lower limit of what can be achieved," 
the minister stresses. As a result of the improved situation in 
the international economy, export conditions have improved 
considerably. On the inside, improvements in productivity and 
cost reductions have taken place. The companies are well on 
their way to regain their technological top position. 
  The minister does ignore that there are still unutilized 
capacities in German industry. Therefore, the companies are 
restrained with investment. Domestic consumption has been 
dampened, among other things, because of the tax increase this 
year. In 1995 the solidarity surcharge will be added. Over the 
next few years the expected room for maneuver must be used not 
to dispense benefits but to reduce taxes. 
  Before the end of this legislative period the Federal 
Government wants to set down the basic values for the corporate 
tax reform. It is undisputed that trade tax and taxes that are 
not related to profit must be reduced. Something must also be 
done for low wage-earners and concerning taxation of the 
subsistence level. The main question for Rexrodt is: What 
about the top tax rates? As of 1996 these must also be reduced 
for nonbusiness revenue, first to 47 percent for the time being. 
"In the medium-term, until the end of the next legislative 
period, I expect a reduction of the top tax rates to clearly 
below 45 percent." Inflation is no longer a topic now. "The 
two before the decimal point can be achieved." For the new 
laender he expects inflation at 3.5 percent, which is less than 
the 4 percent predicted by the annual economic report. 
  Unemployment remains the sensitive spot. This winter the 
4-million threshold was exceeded. This will not be repeated. 
However, great success will be achieved only in 1995. 
  During this legislative period the Law on Simplifying 
Planning and the Investment Facilitation and Housing 
Construction Land Law were passed. In addition, improvements 
were made for work time and the labor exchange monopoly of the 
Federal Employment Office was abolished. The discount law is 
being discussed by parliament just now.

Enterprises"] 
  [Text] Bonn, 12 Apr -- The so-called higher investment 
allowance of 20 percent for east German companies of the 
producing industry and the crafts will expire at the end of the 
year, according to a decision made by the coalition's financial 
politicians. At the same time, as early as 1 July 1994 a 
"largely budget-neutral" follow-up regulation is to be 
introduced, which will also include west German and foreign 
companies. According to this new regulation, all small and 
medium-sized companies in the producing industry and crafts get 
a "higher allowance" of 10 percent for investment in the new 
laender. However, they must not employ more than 250 people. 
The subsidized investment volume is being raised to a maximum 
of 10 million German marks [DM] per company and business year. 
For the 20-percent allowance the subsidized investment volume 
is only DM1 million.

<F P=106> [Josef Joffe editorial: "A Few Bombs and No Strategy"] </F>
  [Text] Unlike before the ultimatum for Sarajevo, there was 
no endless nightly NATO session this time. This time, the bombs 
were dropped in passing, as it were, despite the fact that the 
attacks on the Serbian ground positions were a more dramatic 
precedent than the downing of the aircraft in February. UN 
Commander Michael Rose called for air support; his boss in New 
York approved the operation; and NATO dispatched two U.S. F-16 
fighters from Italy to Gorazde, which were followed by more 
attacks on Monday [11 April]. 
  The pilots dropped three normal 250-kg bombs on Sunday, 
which 
hit two tanks. It was as simple as that. A look at the 
tactical side should sober up a little all those who have always 
rejected an armed intervention with military arguments. They 
claimed that the territory is too broken and that the targets 
are too mobile to be discerned and hit. In fact, NATO is quite 
familiar with the territory and the targets. During the 
shelling of Gorazde, it was not even necessary to use 
sophisticated weapons for the minibattle. The attack was 
carried out in the same way as that of 1917 -- with aircraft in 
the air and UN observers on the ground who determined the 
targets and passed on the coordinates. 
  One should not yet speak of a success after the isolated 
attacks on Sunday and Monday. A "real" war is a thousand times 
more difficult -- not least because the most stupid opponent 
also learns from his defeats and acts in a cleverer way the next 
time. Yet the downing of the four Serbian planes at the end of 
February and the air strikes at the beginning of the week have 
shown that there are military options that may have the desired 
political effect if a credible NATO ultimatum alone led to an 
easing of the Serbian stranglehold of Sarajevo in February. 
  Still, one cannot really be happy about what happened -- for 
numerous and very different reasons. First of all, it is 
obvious that U.S. aircraft took the initiative in both cases. 
Are there no F-16 fighters in the European arsenals? Well, 
there are large numbers -- which is a sad symbol indeed. In 
spite of the fact that Bosnia is not situated in the Rocky 
Mountains, the Europeans seem to lack the required courage and 
cooperation. The objection is correct that the large UN 
contingents of the British and the French on the ground are 
facing the biggest risk in the event of a Serbian retaliation. 
However, a decision has to be made: Either one accepts the 
hostage fate and renounces military gestures -- or one makes it 
clear to the Serbs, including those in Belgrade, what they are 
facing in the event of such an adventure. The "escalation 
dominance" (jargon for the "stronger battalions") does not lie 
on the side of the Serbs. 
  Second: Why, for such a long time, have NATO and the United 
Nations allowed the Serbs to gradually conquer the official 
"protected zone" of Gorazde? Washington in particular only 
acted after pursuing a zig-zag course for months. It was the 
Pentagon that conveyed the impression of a "green light" to the 
Serbs (as opposition leader Dole pointed out) by making 
statements that sounded as though the United States was not at 
all interested in Gorazde. However, it was easy to foresee that 
the Serbs would do two things after their forced withdrawal from 
Sarajevo: Test the resolve of the Europeans again and make up 
for their loss. 
  One must now ask the fundamental question: What is to be 
done? The hesitant attitude in Gorazde has shown that the West 
does not act, but only react -- at the last minute. We know the 
reasons, which are weighty indeed: Differences of opinion, lack 
of leadership, the attitude of the Germans who want the others 
to take the lead, and the legitimate fear of a "Beirut in the 
Balkans." Also, peace cannot be achieved by dropping bombs in 
this inferno. But those who issue guarantees that turn out to be 
a mere bluff after several weeks -- as happened in Gorazde -- 
will not achieve anything. Moreover, sudden strikes out of the 
blue are no strategy either. 
  What can the West do now? It can certainly not produce peace 
like a rabbit out of a diplomat's hat. Yet it might prevent the 
Serbian imperialism from triumphing. It might curb the military 
advantage of the Serbs with well-dosed and predictable force -- 
but no more. Like in Kurdistan, protection zones must really be 
protected. In this way, the insight might grow in Bosnia and 
Belgrade that the war must after all be transferred to the 
negotiating table after two years. 
  It is a matter of course that the Russians must also be 
involved in the talks so that they are not offended and 
undermine what is also in their interest: Peace in the Balkans. 
(Boris Yeltsin has already complained to President Clinton in a 
piqued manner and demanded "consultation between Moscow and 
Washington prior to such decisions.") It also goes without 
saying that Muslims and Croats must not be free to wage wars of 
conquest. The West must not unconditionally support one side or 
the other. Washington and its allies may not be able to pursue 
such a complicated policy over a longer period. However, a 
peace policy based on hesitation and a zig-zag course are not 
useful concepts either.

  [Text] Italy has offered to supply troops to a UN standing 
army. More than 15 countries have already placed troops at the 
UN's disposal, and 54,000 soldiers could be rapidly deployed in 
peacekeeping operations. 
  The UN plans to have 100,000 blue helmets by the end of the 
year. They will be used where both sides in a conflict ask for 
their intervention. The contingent being offered by Italy would 
largely be made up of medical personnel. Seventy thousand 
troops are currently deployed by the United Nations.

  [Text] "The government retains its full powers, so it is 
entitled to do all that it deems expedient to do, conferring 
appointments included." Prime Minister Carlo Azeglio Ciampi 
rejects the criticisms of him by the right-wing coalition that 
won the election, criticisms that were repeated yesterday by 
Roberto Maroni, League lower house floor leader, and MSI 
[Italian Social Movement] member Giuseppe Tatarella, because of 
recent governmental appointments. 
  The executive will not resign until the speakers of the two 
houses of parliament have been appointed, he stated yesterday at 
a foreign press news conference called at Palazzo Chigi. As far 
as the timeframe is concerned, Ciampi pointed out that, "the two 
houses will meet and elect their speakers on 15 April. It will 
take a day or two at the very most." But until then, the 
government will discharge all its responsibilities. Such is 
Ciampi's admonition directed at those who would prefer to see 
him take early retirement as prime minister. 
  "The executive retains its full powers," Ciampi continued. 
"The fact that the republic's president has refused to accept 
its resignation means that the government must discharge the 
duties incumbent upon it. Consequently," he added, "we are 
doing everything we deem necessary to do at this time. We are 
therefore also making the strictly necessary appointments. Why 
should we postpone them?" 
  Giuseppe Tatarella, MSI lower house floor leader, cast doubt 
yesterday on the legitimacy of the civil service appointments 
"and others that fall within the jurisdiction of the government" 
published yesterday by a Milan daily. The criticisms voiced by 
the League's Maroni echoed this; he stated in an interview that, 
"In any case, the next government will regard the 50 
appointments and 31 promotions made over the election period" by 
the present government as nonbinding.

<F P=106> [Unattributed report: "La Malfa: `Joint Lists for European </F>
Elections'"] 
  [Text] Joint lists for the upcoming European elections. 
This is the proposal made by PRI [Italian Republican Party] 
Secretary Giorgio La Malfa to AD [Democratic Alliance], PSI 
[Italian Socialist Party], and Marco Segni's Pact for Italy 
yesterday. In a letter addressed to Ferdinando Adornato (AD), 
Ottaviano Del Turco (PSI), Guiliano Amato, Segni, and Vsalerio 
Zanone (Pact), La Malfa maintains that these forces "already 
have widely common program positions on foreign policy and 
Europe in particular" and that in the economic area "there is a 
similarity of positions that could be called the third road 
between unrestrained free enterprise and the nostalgia of state 
intervention in every part of national life." La Malfa is 
requesting a decision by the end of the week, given the very 
limited time available ("the symbols must be presented on 24 
April and the lists the first week of May") and is therefore 
proposing a committee of representatives from each group to 
define the lists of candidates and to draw up a program. 
  Del Turco responded that, although he considers the issue 
presented by La Malfa as being "of great political importance" 
referring to "the role that the center intends to play," he 
refuses any possibility of "electoral short cuts of a 
third-force type." Del Turco affirms that the building of a 
third "team" will not impede the new majority in the country. 
The opposition, the PSI leader maintains, should be "formed 
around a strong center-left alliance."

<F P=106> [Antonello Caporale report: "The League Raises the Stakes -- </F>
`We Want the Interior Ministry'"] 
  [Excerpt] Rome -- "Preliminarily," or rather "peremptorily" 
the League has requested the interior ministry for itself. The 
claim to the Viminale [Interior Ministry] was put forward 
yesterday, not for the first time, by means of this crude and 
undiplomatic statement by Luigi Rossi, [League Secretary] 
Bossi's spokesperson. It is a longstanding claim, and also, 
naturally, a farsighted one. 
  In order to build federalism, the Senator [Bossi nickname] 
is 
convinced that majority agreements, alliances, and documents are 
useful but not sufficient. A political authority endowed with 
broad, far-reaching, and autonomous power is needed. And, it 
goes without saying, the interior minister is not lacking in 
power. He gives orders to the police (whose chief he must in 
fact trust), and he supervises the secret services. Above all, 
he appoints, transfers, promotes and, if necessary, removes 
questers and prefects. The prefecture, the state's "long hand" 
in the outskirts, is the League's number-one enemy. A 
centralized power rests with thee prefects. In order to 
dismantle this power, therefore, can a better weapon possibly be 
found than occupying the Viminale? Will there ever be a better 
opportunity than this to place Bobo Maroni [League lower house 
floor leader], the bandwagon's [League nickname] statesman par 
excellence, at its head? [passage omitted]

<F P=106> [Erwin Hofer report from Bolzano: "Swing to the Right in </F>
Italy: South Tirol People's Party Fears for Autonomy"] 
  [Text] Bolzano/Vienna -- Before the end of April, a 
delegation of the South Tirol People's Party (SVP) will travel 
to Vienna and tell the Austrian leadership about South Tirol's 
concerns about the political swing to the right in Italy. This 
"definition of one's political position" toward the protecting 
power, Austria, was resolved by the SVP Committee during an 
extraordinary session on domestic policy development. The 
meeting with Foreign Minister Alois Mock (Austrian People's 
Party) is to take place within the next few days, SVP Chairman 
Siegfried Brugger announced after the session. 
  Thus, the SVP has once again made it clear that it does not 
make light of the political swing to the right after the 
elections and the likely participation of neofascist ministers 
in the new Italian Government and that it is seriously concerned 
about the future of South Tirol's autonomy. The SVP committee 
unanimously adopted a resolution calling on the future 
government to "observe all national and international 
obligations undertaken by Italy toward South Tirol." If this is 
not the case, it will not only turn to the protecting power, 
Austria, but also to all the relevant European bodies. "In this 
respect, we are placing great hopes in democratic Europe," 
Brugger said. 
  In view of South Tirol's historical experiences with Italian 
fascism, "the development in Italy are being noted with great 
concern," the party committee stresses. There is above all 
alarm at the "reawakening of fascism." 
  And not without reason: With a view to the government 
formation, neofascists in Bolzano have called for changes of the 
autonomy statute and said that fascist dictator Benito Mussolini 
was the "greatest statesman of the century." The alleged 
democratic transformation of the neofascists, which is 
manifested by the change of their name to National Alliance, is 
not believed in South Tirol. In the SVP's opinion, it is 
nothing but "a feint" -- a wolf in sheep's clothing. Therefore, 
only "a clear opposition and an unshakable no" to a government 
with neofascist ministers can come from the SVP, Chairman 
Brugger announced. 
  While the SVP is still displaying a wait-and-see attitude 
toward Silvio Berlusconi's Forza Italia Movement -- it is still 
too "vague and undefined" -- it does not want to deny that there 
are "positive aspects" in the Northern League regarding the 
discussion on federalism initiated by it. In Bolzano the 
attitude toward this discussion is positive, provided that South 
Tirol's special autonomy is not touched, but it is further 
developed in accordance with real federalism. However, the SVP 
rejects the idea of a greater region that would correspond to 
the old "Tre Venezie" plan, which was rejected long ago.

<F P=106> [Article by Tito Oldani: "The Massive Defeat of Scalfari </F>
 &amp; 
Co.: `Evenings, We Trod the Gramsci Path'"] 
  [Text] What was the intelligentsia's mistake? First of all, 
they underestimated their adversary, and then they demonized 
him. And so a cultural hegemony that lasted 30 years is coming 
to an end. 
  Consider that the philosopher Lucio Colletti, in the very 
columns of L'ESPRESSO, the masthead most hostile to Silvio 
Berlusconi, had advised them early on: "Never demonize your 
adversary; never yield to the temptation to make him into an 
enemy of the people. Demonization can sometimes turn out to be a 
boomerang." Words as prophetic as they were useless. For months, 
using all the cultural instruments at its disposal--newspapers, 
TV, the cinema, the judicial bureaucracy, and academia--the Left 
attempted to destroy the leader of Forza Italia who was depicted 
in the most offensive terms ("Black Knight," "little South 
American dictator," "Robin Hood in reverse," "charlatan," and 
most recently, even "Mafioso"), together with his allies of the 
Freedom Alliance. 
  In the forefront, LA REPUBBLICA Editor Eugenio Scalfari and 
L'ESPRESSO Editor Claudio Rinaldi for months waged an 
anti-Berlusconi campaign that paid off neither in circulation 
nor politically. The accusations of "trash journalism" hurled at 
the Fininvest networks, and L'ESPRESSO's attacks on PANORAMA 
that masqueraded as "editorial wars," dealt a blow to their 
prestige that can be likened to a bullet from a gun that 
backfired. 
  For Scalfari, who had to run the headline "Berlusconi Wins," 
it was the ultimate humiliation. Not only did the Left lose 
along with Scalfari but also the cultural nomenklatura who for 
decades dominated the mass media [preceding two words in 
English], the publishing industry, and the academic world, in 
accordance with the principle of Gramscian hegemony that says: 
Whoever controls the culture, the classroom, and the press 
controls people's minds and in the long run also their votes and 
therefore the state. It was a system of manifest persuasion that 
only three months before, following Francesco Rutelli's victory 
in the Rome municipal elections, appeared destined to give 
Achille Occhetto the victory that had eluded Enrico Berlinguer. 
In his Sunday homilies, Scalfari celebrated the ancient rite of 
organizing a consensus in Italy: the good guys on one side, the 
bad guys on the other. When Berlusconi took the field, however, 
it upset the apple cart and destroyed the "not being of the 
Left" complex that at one time--at the level of the masses--had 
paralyzed many people in their living rooms and at the polls. In 
politics, not just in business, votes are counted and not 
weighed. In the end it became apparent that the majority of 
Italians not only feel alienated from the theorems of the 
preachers of the culture of the Left but reject them. Whereas 
since 1948 the DC [Christian Democratic Party] was able to 
obtain maximum support using a moderate slogan ("progress 
without adventures"), it sufficed for Berlusconi to reinvoke the 
result ("the Italian miracle") that the slogan had obtained and 
offer it once again as a model for emerging from the crisis. 
  The culture of the Left dramatically underestimated the 
danger and the impact of the challenge. When it did become 
aware, too late, of the danger, it was forced to resort to 
traditional propaganda techniques for destroying one's opponent, 
including lies and slander. These techniques were put into 
practice in the cinema by a legion of new "progressive" 
directors led by Nanni Moretti who shot and sent to movie 
theaters many 20 minute spots [preceding word in English] 
designed to smear the leader of Forza Italia. In one of these 
spots there was even a fleeting glimpse of someone who resembled 
Berlusconi attempting to seduce a little boy. The Freedom 
Alliance accordingly used the opportunity to speak of "trash 
cinema" in the service of "trash politics." Was it not obviously 
a case of self-destruction? And yet not one of the movie critics 
understood this. Indeed, a discerning mind such as Lietta 
Tornabuoni, writing in a usually discerning newspaper, LA 
STAMPA, devoted a seven column article to ecstatic praise of 
Moretti &amp; Co.'s initiative. 
  Not only the activist cinema but even state television 
contributed to the demonization of Berlusconi, and thereby to 
the defeat of the Left. The newscasts of the three RAI [Italian 
Broadcasting Corporation] networks appeared to be more anxious 
to please the PDS [Democratic Party of the Left] than to grasp 
the meaning of the Forza Italia phenomenon. But it was programs 
such as Mixer; Milano, Italia; and Il Rosso e il Nero [The Red 
and the Black] that, taken together, sounded an alarm bell among 
most voters because of the perception they received of a 
progressive Minculpop [Ministry of Popular Culture] that they 
needed to reject with their votes. "In the eyes of not a few 
voters," Colletti wrote, "Berlusconi actually appeared to be a 
victim. Michele Santoro should be on the Fininvest payroll. To 
devote three hours of state TV to the subject of Berlusconi's 
debts when every major entrepreneur is more or less in the same 
situation is something that cannot help but appear as defamatory 
and counterproductive." 
  Academia also suffered from the Gramsci effect. In addition 
to the old and honorable progressivism in the style of Norberto 
Bobbio, we witnessed the extracurricular battle waged by Umberto 
Eco, who used a university auditorium to hurl scurrilous songs 
and slogans [preceding word in English] against the adversary. 
These were followed by innumerable ex cathedra pronouncements 
and appeals, which were also unfailingly disregarded by the 
average voter. Does this reflect an endemic ignorance on the 
part of Italians? Apparently not, according to the explanation 
offered by Giuseppe Bedeschi, instructor in moral philosophy at 
Sapienza University in Rome, who maintains that at least one 
segment of academia consists of intellectuals who are more 
concerned with preserving their jobs and their stipends than 
with scientific progress--a harsh and assuredly unpleasant 
assessment. This has not prevented the average voter, however, 
from quickly perceiving the importance of what is at stake 
behind the brief but salutary controversy over the issue of 
public education versus private education, and over its 
corollary: the university (which with only a few isolated 
exceptions has been reduced to an "examination-giving machine") 
versus private universities (such as Bocconi and Luiss), which 
young people vie with each other to enter. 
<H5>  The Keynesians' War </H5>
  No less hostile toward Berlusconi was the lobby [preceding 
word in English] of the economists. This was, moreover, in the 
eyes of the public, the strangest of all the contradictions that 
have surfaced within the intelligentsia. But how is it possible 
for Berlusconi to take the field proposing free-market remedies, 
and then to have authoritative professors of economics from 
Nobel Laureate Franco Modigliani to Luigi Spaventa, and from 
Nino Andreatta to Michele Salvati, give him an "F?" "If after 
Berlusconi is in government he were to put into practice what he 
is saying," Modigliani wrote, "it would be a disaster." And many 
venomous portraits were reserved for the few economists, such as 
Antonio Martino, who sided with Forza Italia. 
  The science of economics obviously had nothing at all to do 
with any of this. What was involved, and heavily involved, were 
the power relationships among the economists' lobbies [preceding 
word in English] in the universities and the public enterprises, 
which for 30 years have been dominated by Keynesians, both 
Catholic and secular. Here is a fact not generally known: in the 
1960's the Catholic Siro Lombardini and the secular leftist 
Paolo Sylos Labini--the former a Keynesian and the latter a 
Schumpeterian-- reached an agreement to appoint their disciples 
to university chairs, to the detriment of the disciples of the 
neolaissez-faire school. The result? According to Simona 
Quintili's research on the past 30 years of economic thinking in 
Italy, 49 of the 50 economics textbooks most in use today at the 
universities are Keynesian and only one is monetarist and 
neolaissez-faire. Moreover, the cultural tradition of the Bank 
of Italy has always been Keynesian. This is why the word 
"neolaissez-faire"--despite the fact that it refers to economic 
principles that are in vogue in all the major industrialist 
countries--is viewed almost as heresy in the overwhelming 
majority of our universities. And the slogan "less state, more 
market"--the slogan that was victorious at the polls--is viewed 
as basically an illusion, or perhaps, in one's heart of hearts, 
as blasphemy.

    [Editorial Report] A number of issues dealing with the 
military have surfaced in the Portuguese press. 
<H5>  Offsets for F-16's </H5>
  Writing in the 19 March Lisbon weekly SEMANARIO, military 
affairs specialist Jose Vegar contends that the Ministry of 
Defense "inexplicably" gave up its right to more offsets in the 
negotiations for the purchase of 20 U.S.-made F-16 Lockheed 
fighter aircraft. While at the outset Portugal expected some 
$100 million, Vegar cites a "high U.S. official" as saying that 
the company will only pay $42 million. He also cites Ministry of 
Defense sources as stating that negotiations are ongoing and 
that Portugal expects offsets of about $90 million. The issue 
surfaced at the end of 1992, when the United States announced 
that Portugal would have to pay $173 million for the F-16 
aircraft Washington refused to consider part of the payment for 
the use of the Azores' Lajes air base. Lisbon agreed, expecting 
that offsets would be offered by the manufacturer, "as is the 
practice," Vegar continues. However, Lockheed was "evasive" 
throughout 1993, prompting the Portuguese minister of defense to 
notify the company that unless offsets were not negotiated until 
1 December 1993, the deal was off. Following a recent visit to 
Lisbon by a Lockheed team, which initially offered $18 million, 
the Ministry of Defense agreed to accept $42 million. Vegar 
cites an unidentified Portuguese high official involved in the 
negotiations as explaining the changes that took place in the 
ministry--notably the departure of State Secretary of Defense 
Eugenio Ramos--influenced the "final outcome," given that the 
Portuguese negotiators were "less familiar" with the issue, 
whose real importance they were not aware of. Vegar regrets that 
Portugal concluded the agreement, for the threat to cancel it 
was Lisbon's only trump card. 
<H5>  Lajes Issue Revisited </H5>
  According to an article in the 22 March Lisbon daily 
PUBLICO, 
the Lajes cooperation agreement between the United States and 
Portugal will be signed at the end of July. The only issue 
pending at this time is the labor agreement, despite the fact 
that the United States has finally agreed that labor relations 
will be regulated on the basis of Portuguese legislation. 
Notably absent from the agreement is the issue of "financial 
offsets" for the Lajes base use, which will be the subject of 
two distinct formulations: the first will be in the context of 
NATO, while the second will relate to specific U.S. interests, 
with the use of the base reviewed case by case. 
<H5>  Missiles, Machine Guns Acquisition </H5>
  Jose Vegar notes in the 12 March SEMANARIO that following 
the 
refusal by the United States to furnish Stinger missiles to 
Portugal as compensation for the Lajes base, the government will 
soon open the acquisition of ground-to-air missiles and 
target-detecting equipment to international bidding. According 
to Vegar, who contends that the Stinger missiles were already 
"antiquated," competition will be harsh, with the Short Missile 
System (SMS) British-French company formed by the Short and 
Thomson firms and the French Matra company already squaring off 
for the fight ahead. 
  Meanwhile, bidding for the new 5.56 machine gun to replace 
the old G-3's is progressing, Vegar continues. The defense firm 
INDEP has already submitted its report to Minister of Defense 
Fernando Nogueira, who has decided that the issue should be 
classified "top secret." The companies vying for the contract 
will be invited to detail the offsets they are willing to offer. 
According to Vegar, INDEP has evaluated the various types of 
weapons in the competition and is now awaiting Nogueira's 
"political" decision, which reportedly involves the U.S. Colt, 
the Israeli Galil, and the Austrian Steyr companies. 
<H5>  Scarcity of Volunteers </H5>
  According to the 1 April Lisbon weekly EXPRESSO, Fernando 
Nogueira's plan to limit compulsory military service to four 
months for all branches of the armed forces has run into 
difficulties because of the lack of volunteers. In addition, 
according to a military source cited by EXPRESSO, volunteers are 
refusing to serve in areas other than those where they reside. 
As a result, the government has decided to increase military 
service to seven months for recruits who will serve in the 
medical services. It should be noted that in general, military 
officials have disagreed with the reduction of military service 
on grounds that it is "technically impracticable."

    [Editorial Report] According to the 26 March Lisbon weekly 
EXPRESSO, the results of an EXPRESSO/Euroexpansao poll conducted 
nationwide between 21 and 23 March among 485 regularly 
participating individuals showed that the Socialist Party (PS) 
is now in first place in voter preference. The PS rose 4.1 
percent since the previous month and now stands at 37.9 percent, 
while the Social Democratic Party (PSD) lost 1.7 percentage 
points, to drop to 34.1 percent. Drops were also registered by 
the Communist Party (PCP), which now stands at 5.3 percent, and 
the Center Social Democratic Party (CDS), whose popularity is 
4.6 percent. PS leader Antonio Guterres also recovered lost 
ground, going from 31 percent last month to the present 34 
percent, with Prime Minister Cavaco Silva standing at 33 percent. 
  Only 9 percent of the Portuguese consider themselves 
"somewhat" or "not nationalistic," the results of an 
EXPRESSO/Euroexpansao poll (no further details) published in the 
26 March EXPRESSO revealed. On a scale of 1 to 5, 23 percent 
said they are "highly nationalistic," 20 percent consider 
themselves "quite nationalistic," and 36 percent are "moderately 
nationalistic." At a time when the nationalism-versus-federalism 
question is in heated debate, the Portuguese failed to perceive 
the essential contradiction of the fact that 51 percent of the 
respondents agreed with future Portuguese integration in a 
"United States of Europe," compared to 27 percent who objected 
to it and 22 percent who had no opinion.

  [Text] Fifteen UN soldiers from the Nordic peacekeeping 
battalion in Bosnia since Sunday [10 April] have been detained 
by Serbian soldiers at a roadblock northwest of Sarajevo. The 
group, made up of 13 Swedes and two Norwegians, was stopped 
after refusing to hand over explosives that form part of the 
supplies being carried to their colleagues in Tuzla. Sweden's 
Defense Minister Anders Bjorck says he doesn't regard this as a 
hostage situation, adding that the Nordic soldiers will be free 
to leave the area as soon as a relief group arrives on the scene. 
  Sweden is to withdraw the two Air Force transport planes 
that 
have been taking part in relief flights to the Bosnian capital 
Sarajevo when the agreement with the UN High Commissioner for 
Refugees expires next week. This is despite a UN request for 
continued assistance. Military sources in Stockholm cite 
technical reasons, saying the aircraft need overhaul after 
flying two to three times daily to Sarajevo. The planes are the 
only two of Sweden's eight giant Hercules transport planes with 
special protection against heat-seeking missiles and thus 
suitable for the task. Foreign Aid Minister Alf Svensson said 
Sweden is prepared to resume relief flights at a later date.

<F P=106> [Susanne Rydell report: "Swedish Aid to Sarajevo To Cease"] </F>
  [Text] The Swedish aid flights to Sarajevo will end on 20 
April. Sweden has said "no" to a request from the UNHCR that it 
continue to fly in food and medicine. 
  Swedish Hercules aircraft have been taking part in the 
airlift to Bosnia since the end of January. Two or three times 
a day a Swedish plane with much needed supplies has landed in 
Sarajevo. 
  According to the original agreement with the UNHCR, Swedish 
aid deliveries would continue for three months, up to 20 April. 
The UNHCR's request for an extension of a further three months 
has been turned down after consultations between Aid Minister 
Alf Svensson and Defense Minister Anders Bjorck. 
  For primarily technical and not political reasons the 
Defense 
Ministry is unable to agree to an extension of the agreement, 
Foreign Ministry assistant under secretary Lars Schmidt 
announced. 
  "Among other reasons the Hercules aircraft are much the 
worse 
for wear. One of the aircraft is flying practically nonstop," 
he said. 
  Only two of the Air Force's eight Hercules aircraft are 
being 
used for the flights to Sarajevo. The reason is that these two 
are the only ones which have special defenses against attack by 
heat-seeking missiles. 
  According to Aid Minister Alf Svensson, one of the reasons 
why Sweden has said "no" is that the UNHCR's request came too 
late. "We have to be able to plan for things like this. And, 
from the beginning, there was talk of only three months." 
  Alf Svensson said that he has no objections to the way the 
Defense Ministry views the matter. "I cannot insist on Swedish 
aid flights to Bosnia if both Swedish personnel and the Swedish 
aircraft are run down." 
  The decision to end aid flights was not reached for economic 
reasons, according to the aid minister. He stressed that Sweden 
is prepared to resume aid flights again at a later date. 
  For the time being at least the Defense Ministry has also 
said "no" to Swedish aid flights to Tuzla. "The security 
question has not been resolved yet. The necessary preconditions 
for an airlift do not exist in Tuzla," Lars Schmidt said. 
  According to Ingemar Cederberg, assistant under secretary at 
the Foreign Ministry and responsible for the coordination of 
disaster aid, the question of aid flights to Tuzla has been 
partially resolved because Norway has responded positively to a 
request that it undertake such flights, if they are possible 
from the safety and security viewpoint. 
  The airlift to Sarajevo has been suspended since Monday as a 
result of the escalation of the conflict.

<F P=106> [Agneta Engqvist report: "Chinese Currency Chaos Affects </F>
Swedish Exports"] 
  [Text] Many Swedish companies are not being paid for their 
exports to China. The current financial squeeze in this country 
has put them in a difficult position. Swedish exporters have 
been taken by surprise. Their old dependable Chinese customers, 
including those who used to pay in advance, are no longer able 
to settle their payments. 
<H5>  No Currency </H5>
  "What is happening now is not due to any inability or 
reluctance to pay on the part of the Chinese companies. The 
reason is that the banks refuse to grant them foreign currency. 
That is why they cannot pay for what they import," Bo 
Backstrom, new head of the Export Council's representation in 
China, said. His advice to Swedish exporters is: "Do not 
export anything before you have established a letter of credit. 
And do this before the goods are shipped from Sweden." 
<H5>  Only Local Currency </H5>
  Today all Chinese importers have to go to one of the 10 
state-designated banks in obtain to get foreign currency. 
Previously they could go to so-called trade centers to obtain 
Foreign Exchange Certificates (FEC), the special "foreigners' 
currency," but this was abolished at the beginning of the year. 
Today, there is only the local currency, renminbi [as 
published], and hard currencies are scarce at the remaining 
exchange centers. 
  The overheated Chinese economy and the tight financial 
policy 
have left the banks with only a strict control function. They 
have to ensure that the products imported are really essential 
and belong to priority categories. "It is only when the Chinese 
company requests a letter of credit that the bank reviews its 
chances of obtaining foreign currency for imports," Bo Backstrom 
said. 
<H5>  Free Exchange Rate </H5>
  Sweden's exports to China almost doubled in 1993, reaching a 
value of nearly 4.9 billion Kronor. China is the 16th largest 
importer of Swedish goods. 
  The abolition of the "foreigners' currency" is a first step 
toward a convertible currency and, gradually, a free exchange 
rate in China.

<F P=106> [Mats Knutson report: "Colliander New Party Leader in New </F>
Democracy"] 
  [Excerpts] Vasteras -- On Saturday evening [9 April] 
Harriet Colliander, 51, was elected New Democracy's new party 
chairman by a large majority. 
  With voting figures of 101 to 63 she knocked out her main 
opponent, Sten Dybeck, in the second round of voting. 
  Outgoing party leader Ian Wachtmeister, who supported 
Dybeck, 
was most dissatisfied with the outcome of the election. Instead 
of congratulating his successor, he openly criticized Colliander 
at the congress for a lack of leadership. 
  "That felt a bit sad. If we are going to have any peace so 
we can work in the Riksdag group I think it is best that 
Wachtmeister leaves his seat in the Riksdag," Colliander 
responded a little later at an improvised press conference. 
  Harriet Colliander is the leader of New Democracy's group in 
the Riksdag. This is another post she has taken over after Ian 
Wachtmeister after he announced that he would leave the post of 
party chairman. 
  Colliander is single, has two grownup children, and is 
closer 
to the political center than her predecessor. 
  However, she denied that the election of a new party leader 
will mean a shift to the left in New Democracy's policies. 
  "But in future we will not be as unconditional in our 
support 
for the government as we have been in the past," she said. 
  Harriet Colliander also claimed that New Democracy will 
become more democratic under her leadership. For example, she 
is critical of the party organization that was forced through 
and which means that the Riksdag party only enters into 
cooperation agreements with local party organizations. 
  "For the party to be able to be strong it must see itself as 
a whole," she declared, adding that she wants the return of the 
old arrangement under which local associations were also 
formally part of New Democracy. 
  The election of a new party leader on Saturday evening had 
been preceded by a long and bitter power struggle within New 
Democracy, with one side chiefly represented by Harriet 
Colliander and Bert Karlsson and the other by Ian Wachtmeister 
and his supporters. 
  For several weeks the two factions have been fighting each 
other in the media and at the party's offices in Stockholm. 
Several people have resigned or taken sick leave after divisive 
rows. Despite this internal conflict Harriet Colliander 
believes she can unite the party. 
  "After everything that has happened I believe everyone is 
longing for peace and quiet. It therefore would be tragic if 
Ian Wachtmeister were the one in the party upsetting its 
internal calm," she said. 
  Ian Wachtmeister, who left the party congress immediately 
after Colliander was elected his successor, thinks that she must 
give evidence of clearer leadership if the party is to be welded 
together again. 
  "I think that she will have a much more difficult time 
uniting the party than Sten Dybeck. Not least because she 
belongs to one faction and therefore carries a taint. But there 
is a chance if Harriet sharpens up her ideas and becomes a 
leader instead of someone who allows herself to be led," said 
Wachtmeister, who claimed that it is Bert Karlsson who controls 
the new party leader. [passage omitted] 
  The wounds go deep after the conflict within New Democracy. 
Ian Wachtmeister himself was only partially successful when it 
came to winning some redress from the congress, which he has 
been demanding since the party executive stripped him of all 
powers as party leader last week. 
  Wachtmeister had demanded that the congress dissociate 
itself 
from the majority on the party executive, including Harriet 
Colliander. Instead the congress only adopted a general 
statement put together by Bo Sillen to the effect that the 
executive's decision was incorrect and that it had harmed 
Wachtmeister.

  [Text] Tugay Ulucevik, Turkish Foreign Ministry under 
secretary, has said that for mutual trust to be established in 
Cyprus the damage caused to the package of confidence-building 
measures [CBM's] should be rectified and its contents restored 
to its original form. Ulucevik arrived in the Turkish Republic 
of Northern Cyprus [TRNC] this afternoon to assess the latest 
developments on the Cyprus issue. He was received by President 
Rauf Denktas. 
  In a statement prior to the meeting held at the presidency, 
Ulucevik said that it is Turkey's national goal to secure the 
lasting conditions imperative for the tranquil, secure and 
prosperous existence of the Turkish Cypriot community. He noted 
that Turkey shares the view expressed by the UN secretary 
general on November, 1992, that there is a profound confidence 
crisis between the two sides on the island. Ulucevik recalled 
that activities aimed at securing an atmosphere of trust between 
the two sides have been initiated as of May, 1993. He pointed 
out that the Turkish Cypriot side accepted the principles stated 
in the UN secretary general's report dated 1 July, 1993, which 
included the issues of Maras [Varosha] and the Lefkosa [Nicosia] 
International Airport in the belief that the package was going 
to be implemented in full. Ulucevik added that as of 9 March, 
Denktas noted that the package was being distorted and that 
Turkey assessed the package and concurred with Denktas' 
observation. He further recalled the Turkish Foreign Ministry 
announcement concurring with the TRNC observation, adding that 
the aim of his visit to rectify the damage caused to the package 
and restore its contents to its original form. 
  In reply to a question, Ulucevik said that the fact that he 
was visiting the island at the same time as Robert Lamb, U.S. 
State Department's special Cyprus coordinator, was a 
coincidence. Noting that Lamb asked to meet him, Ulucevik added 
that the TRNC is conducting the negotiating process and that 
Turkey is only trying to help advance the talks. He added that 
within this framework it is normal for him to meet with Lamb. 
In reply to another question, Ulucevik said that had the UN 
Security Council not wished to rectify the damage caused to the 
package, the issue would have been closed long ago. He 
concluded by saying that Turkey favors securing an atmosphere of 
trust between the two sides based on the CBM's agreed upon by 
both sides.

  [Text] The Tirana regime is escalating tension in 
Greek-Albanian relations despite Greece's intentions to foster 
good relations. In a provocative diplomatic note to the Greek 
Embassy in Tirana, the Albanian Government asked the Greek 
ambassador to reduce the embassy's diplomatic staff from 10 to 
six people. 
  According to a REUTER dispatch from Tirana, the diplomatic 
note says that, because there has been no agreement on the 
question of the diplomatic staff, the Albanian side believes 
that there should be a reciprocal reduction in the staff of the 
Greek and Albanian diplomatic missions from 10 to six people. 
The Albanian note also gives Athens a 10-day time limit to 
carry out the reduction. REUTER also notes that Albania has a 
four-member diplomatic mission in Athens.

  [Text] Greece always desires good relations with Albania, 
Foreign Minister Karolos Papoulias said today and stressed that 
the Albanian side's reaction to the Gjirokaster incident does 
not help promote the good relations that both peoples desire. 
Mr. Papoulias described Tirana's reaction as unreasonable and 
said that there is an open invitation to his Albanian 
counterpart, Alfred Serreqi, for a meeting on neutral territory 
and to form a joint committee to investigate the incident; there 
has not been any response to the proposals. 
  Foreign Minister Karolos Papoulias denied reports about a 
new 
incident yesterday on the Greek-Albanian borders and pointed out 
that both police and military sources stressed that there is 
complete calm on the Greek-Albanian border. Mr. Papoulias 
added: The Greek Army has not been put on alert along the border 
with Albania.

  [Text] Ambassador Adhamandios Vasilakis, the permanent 
Greek charge d'affaires at the United Nations, conveyed a letter 
from Foreign Minister Karolos Papoulias to the UN Security 
Council president. In the letter, the Greek Government rejects 
Albania's unfounded and suspicious claims surrounding the 
incident in Episkopi. The letter stresses that the great haste 
with which Tirana moved to blame the Greek Government is 
unacceptable and that [Albanian President Sali] Berisha's 
government remains negative although Greece has repeatedly asked 
for cooperation to resolve the issue. 
  Papoulias' letter refers to Albania's suspicious intentions 
and motives in taking an unresolved issue and turning it into a 
bilateral dispute. It also accuses the Albanian Government of 
linking the incident with Skopje [The Former Yugoslav Republic 
of Macedonia--FYROM] and Kosovo. 
  UN diplomatic circles consider Tirana's behavior as a 
desperate effort to disorientate the common view away from the 
serious domestic, economic, political, minority, and human 
rights issues the country is facing. It is believed that the 
Security Council will take no further step but will only suggest 
that the two sides cooperate to resolve the issue.

<F P=106> [Editorial: "Making Tirana See Reason..."] </F>
  [Text] The extreme measure of expelling the Greek consul 
from Gjirokaster under the pretext of a suspicious incident that 
took place last Sunday [10 April] clearly shows the intention of 
Tirana to exploit the sad event internationally and to attribute 
full responsibility to the Greek side. 
  In other words, Berisha's reaction is not defensive but 
clearly aggressive. It's aim is to rally and incite the 
fanaticism of the Muslims in his country and in the other Balkan 
areas where his fellow nationals live as a minority. The 
Albanian leader has not concealed his intentions to link what he 
calls the "Albanian issue" to the problem of the former 
Yugoslavia. It is for this reason that he looks forward to 
(instead of wishing against it, as the whole world does) the 
expansion of obscurity and unrest in Kosovo, Skopje [The Former 
Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia--FYROM], and other areas where 
there are Muslims and Albanian-speaking minorities. 
  For many months now the Berisha regime, without even the 
pretext of last Sunday's incident, has insisted on portraying 
the country as directly threatened by Serbia and Greece. The 
goal of Tirana's tactics was to ensure the strongest possible 
support from the United States and West European countries by 
being in the position of a weak and threatened state. At the 
same time, the Berisha regime apparently believed that it was 
securing an alibi for its future moves and "reactions" in 
pursuing a solution to the "Albanian issue." 
  So, last Sunday's incident was so opportune and helpful to 
the Albanian plans as to be suspicious, possibly incriminating 
those who hasten to exploit it in a relentless and extremist 
manner. 
  Our country has maintained a stance toward Albanian and 
Berisha's provocations that exceeds the limits of tolerance and 
has already entered the field of an unjustified and obviously 
unequal retreat. In addition to the moral, material, and 
economic assistance we have granted the Berisha regime, the 
Greek people are currently hosting almost all the unemployed 
Albanians who entered the country illegally. The Greek people 
are also being hit by an unprecedented crime wave that also 
comes from our neighboring statelet... 
  All these things are being pointed out not to highlight our 
country's strength or to threaten reprisals against the Berisha 
regime, they are merely designed to make Tirana see reason and, 
of course, warn that the Hellenism of North Epirus is not being 
offered as a victim of pressure and blackmail. Its rights are 
safeguarded internationally and the guarantor for these rights 
is, naturally and primarily, the national metropolis of the 
Greek minority...

  [Text] A short time ago, the European Union [EU] Commission 
confirmed that it would refer Greece to court for the embargo it 
imposed against Skopje [The Former Yugoslav Republic of 
Macedonia--FYROM]. In a news conference in Brussels, an EU 
commissioner said the Commission ratified its decision of last 
week. 
  Government spokesman Evangelos Venizelos described the EU 
Commission decision to take Greece to the European Court for 
adopting measures against Skopje on 16 February as unfortunate, 
inappropriate, and contradictory. Venizelos said: The EU 
Commission will ask the European Court to take temporary 
measures against Greece, something that will undermine 
international mediator Cyrus Vance's initiative and the 
Community's political initiative through EU Commissioner Hans 
van den Broek. The spokesman said the court will give our 
country a new forum to develop its positions further.

  [Text] Turkey has declared that the NATO intervention 
against Serbian positions is an appropriate and welcome 
development, even though it is a belated move. It was stated 
that Turkey's insistent attitude played a significant role in 
the realization of this intervention. 
  In his weekly news conference, Foreign Ministry Spokesman 
Ferhat Ataman said that Gorazde is one of the Serbs' main 
targets in their policy to gain territory and carry out ethnic 
cleansing. This is why Gorazde was included among the six safe 
areas declared by the UN Security Council and was placed under 
international protection, Ataman recalled. 
  Although it was a belated move, Ataman declared, the NATO 
intervention against Serbian positions was an appropriate and 
welcome development. He added that Turkey's insistent attitude 
constituted one of the significant factors in the realization of 
this intervention. 
  Ataman stated: It is important to closely observe the Serbs' 
every move and behavior and to give the necessary response to 
every attack. The international community should have realized 
by now that the Serbs understand only determined stands.

  [Excerpt] Turkish ground and Air Force units and Kurdish 
peshmergas affiliated with Democratic Party of Kurdistan leader 
Mas'ud Barzani have launched a major operation against the 
Workers Party of Kurdistan [PKK] militants in northern Iraq. 
Some 40,000 troops and 3,000 commandos affiliated with the 
commando brigade on Hakkari Mountain have penetrated 5 km into 
northern Iraq. The joint cross-border operation, which was 
launched by the Turkish military forces on Turkey's border and 
the peshmerga units in northern Iraq, is supported by several 
Turkish military aircraft and Cobra and Sikorsky helicopters. 
  Several military aircraft, which took off from the 2d 
Tactical Air Base in Diyarbakir and the Erhac Air Base in 
Malatya, have bombed the Besta Valley and the heights of the 
Cudi, Gabbar, Herekol, Namaz, and Kupeli Mountains. Several 
Super Cobra helicopters joined the operation at about noon 
yesterday. 
  Elsewhere, a private vehicle was destroyed by a PKK mine 
near 
Emekciler village in Siirt at about 1600 yesterday. The 
vehicle's driver and four village guards, who were his 
passengers, were killed in the incident. 
  Three soldiers were martyred and three others were wounded 
in 
a clash between the security forces and a group of terrorists 
near the Tur farming settlement near the village of Islam in 
Diyarbakir's Kulp district yesterday. A terrorist was also 
killed in the clash. 
  The security forces killed four PKK terrorists in the rural 
areas of Igdir's Halfeli village, two terrorists in the forest 
areas of Kars' Sarikamis district, and one terrorist in the 
rural areas of Hakkari's Yuksekova district. 
  A group of terrorists attacked the Garzan-Besiri oil 
pipeline 
at about 2200 the night before last. The pipeline is operated 
by the Turkish Petroleum Corporation's regional directorate in 
Batman. No one was killed in the incident. [passage omitted]

  [Text] Ankara--One of the most senior commanders of the 
outlawed Kurdistan Workers' Party (PKK) in eastern Turkey is 
believed to have been killed by his aides within the 
organization for failing to adapt to the movement's radical 
stance, a senior security source said over the weekend. 
  Muslum Durgun, alias Doctor Baran, was the PKK's so-called 
military commander in the Tunceli (Dersim) region and died last 
month. Initial reports said that he committed suicide with a 
hand grenade during a security forces operation. 
  On Friday [8 April], the PKK-affiliated KURD-HA news agency 
confirmed the death of Durgun and also claimed that his death 
was the result of suicide -- an act that is not approved of by 
the organization. 
  The same day, members of Durgun's movement in Tunceli 
distributed leaflets to the local people accusing the PKK of 
being a "chauvinist and murderous" organization. 
  Reports reaching the Southeastern provincial capital of 
Diyarbakir had it that a serious rift had opened within the PKK 
in Tunceli and that a group of the militants had moved to the 
outlawed Workers' and Peasants' Liberation Army of Turkey 
(TIKKO) which uses Diyarbakir as its main base. 
  "Bullets of treason fired from the muzzle of `revolutionary 
violence' have killed him and have stabbed our hearts with 
pain," ran the communique, which was signed simply: 
"Revolutionaries from Dersim." 
  "This example of 'revolutionary justice' has sent our people 
into mourning," the communique said. 
  According to Baran's supporters within the PKK, this central 
committee member was killed by two of his assistants, codenamed 
Ekrem and Velet. Ekrem's real name is Hidir Sarikaya and he has 
reportedly been named the new PKK commander for Tunceli in 
replacement of Baran. 
  Baran's supporters said during the weekend that they 
regarded 
the PKK as a chauvinist organization based on Kurdish racism and 
involved in treason against the Kurdish people. 
  The communique accused the PKK central herarchy of 
"despotic" 
behaviour. 
  The Kurd-A statement, on the other hand, claimed that Doctor 
Baran had been heavily criticised in a recent congress of 
provincial PKK commanders. It implied that the main accusation 
against him was passivism. 
  Sources close to the PKK in Diyarbakir told the TDN [TURKISH 
DAILY NEWS] during the weekend that Doctor Baran had for some 
time been under fire for "not living up to expectations." He 
was reportedly accused of not being able to command his forces 
and failing to launch major attacks on Turkish targets. Some 30 
PKK leaders have in the past been the victims of ad hoc trials 
by the organization and afterwards killed. 
  A security source in Ankara told the TDN on Saturday that 
Turkey had monitored recent communications between PKK leader 
Abdullah Ocalan and his remaining commanders. He said that a 
debate had gone on for nearly four hours, contrary to the PKK's 
own security precautions, and that Ocalan had argued with the 
commanders regarding Doctor Baran's fate. He did not elaborate 
further.

  [Text] Botan (KURD-HA) -- The ARGK [People's Liberation 
Army of Kurdistan] headquarters has announced the list of 
operations for March. According to the ARGK statement, 483 
soldiers, 106 village guards, 91 policemen, and 86 guerrillas 
were killed during operations and clashes in March. 
  ARGK headquarters' Statement No. 35 indicated that 
"Considering that we are still alive now in spring and judging 
from the battle casualty figures for March, the Turkish 
Republic's Special Warfare Administration's claim that `we will 
destroy every single guerrilla in the mountains by spring' has 
proved to be nothing but a hollow and ridiculous claim. It 
proves that any attempt to wipe out the guerrillas on the 
mountains can only lead to self-destruction." 
  The statement notes that the guerrilla activity, which never 
ceased this winter, has sharply increased with the onset of 
spring and that the army units in Botan [Hakkari, Sirnak, Cizre 
regions] were imprisoned in their garrisons during the elections. 
  Referring to the elections, the statement says: 
"Participation in the elections in the rural areas was almost 
zero, and it never surpassed 40 percent in the cities." 
  The statement lists the following ARGK operations for March: 
  ``1. A total of 252 operations in different localities were 
carried out in March, 21 of which were road checks. As a result 
of these operations: 
  ``a. Some 483 soldiers, including 21 officers, were killed 
and 172 soldiers were wounded, including two officers. 
  ``b. Some 106 village guards, three of them cadres, were 
killed and 57 were wounded. 
  ``c. Some 91 special warfare personnel -- counterguerrillas, 
agents, government officials, collaborationists, informants, 
police chiefs, policemen, and others -- died, and 78 were 
wounded. 
  ``d. Some 39 special warfare operatives captured by the 
guerrillas were tried, after which they were either given 
various sentences or released. 
  ``e. Three helicopters, five tanks, eight police armored 
cars, and 35 military-civilian vehicles were damaged by mines or 
rockets; numerous installations used in the construction of 
bridges and roads were destroyed; and various oil wells and 
pipelines were repeatedly smashed. 
  ``f. A substantial amount of arms, ammunition, magazines, 
and military hardware were seized. Some 115 sheep and goats, 
and 52 million Turkish lira were confiscated from the village 
guards. 
  ``2. In the context of the PKK's two-month amnesty for 
village guards decreed on the occasion of the Newroz holiday, 
the inhabitants of two villages and 559 village guards from 
various other villages laid down their arms. 
  ``3. Some 86 guerrillas died and 13 others were wounded in 
guerrilla activity in March. Two guerrillas were taken prisoner 
by the Turkish Republic because they were on the verge of 
freezing due to winter conditions. 
  ``4. Popular uprisings took place in many places in protest 
of the Turkish Republic's military operations and its policy of 
bombing villages, evicting village inhabitants, detentions, 
oppressions, and torture. In general, the overwhelming majority 
of the people protested against state authority and policies 
during the elections and Newroz. 
  ``5. In the meantime, efforts to form a Kurdistan national 
assembly have been stepped up all over Kurdistan; provincial 
conferences were held in red zones [areas where liberated zones 
exist or can now be created], and there is a gradual move toward 
people's rule in areas free of the Turkish Republic Army and 
under effective guerrilla control.''

<F P=106> [Report on an "exclusive interview" with Iranian Ambassador </F>
to Turkey Mohammad Reza Baqeri with Adnan Caglayan at the 
Iranian Embassy in Ankara; date not given] 
  [Text] Ankara--Iranian Ambassador Mohammad Reza Baqeri 
stressed that the recent local elections in Turkey expressed the 
free will of the Turkish people and could not be criticized by 
anybody, referring to the emerging debate over the pro-Islamic 
Welfare Party's (RP) electoral victory in the March 27 polls. 
"Turks are a brave, civilized and independent people. Who can 
say that Turks do not know how to elect the right leaders?" 
Baqeri told the TURKISH DAILY NEWS. 
  "These results should be of concern only to Turks. They, 
themselves, can talk about it. Iran is respecting the 
expression of the Turkish people's free will. Some comments 
concerning the election results can be attributed to the enemies 
of Turkey. They are trying to distract the Turkish public. The 
Turkish press has to prevent this plot," Baqeri said. 
  Regarding his visit to the newly elected RP mayor of 
Erzurum, 
Baqeri said that he traveled to Erzurum on a regular basis in 
order to visit the Iranian Consulate in that city. "I went to 
Erzurum two years ago and I visited the mayor, the governor, 
local press representatives and the university, just as I did 
during my last visit. But the Turkish press preferred to focus 
on my visit to the mayor. I have no particular interest in 
visiting mayors from the RP. For example, I have no plans to 
visit the (newly elected RP) mayors in either Istanbul or 
Ankara," said Baqeri. 
  "Turkish authorities and the press are aware of my 
activities 
here so there should be no question as to the purpose of my 
visit to Erzurum," Baqeri noted, stressing that with his 
four-year presence in Turkey, he is no newcomer to the country. 
"Are there any suspicions raised when other diplomats travel to 
Southeast Anatolia? Iran and its ambassador bring nothing but 
good intentions to Turkey," Baqeri stated. 
  Meanwhile, the Iranian ambassador also said that with 60 
million Muslims living in Turkey, the RP could not claim to be 
the sole representative of Islam in the country. His statement 
was made in reference to claims that Iran has taken a special 
interest in the success of the pro-Islamic RP. "Can you say 
that people from the Social Democrat People's Party (SHP) are 
not Muslims? I know so many people from True Path Party (DYP) 
who pray regularly. There are ministers among them. 
Consequently, those who place these issues on the agenda do not 
have good intentions," he said. 
  However, he also mentioned that it would not make sense for 
Iran to distance itself from the newly elected RP mayors either. 
When the mayor of the Iranian city of Tabriz visited Turkey two 
years ago, Baqeri pointed out, he held a meeting with SHP 
Chairman Murat Karayalcin. At the time Karayalcin was a mayor 
from the SHP. "We established a good dialogue with him. But 
now, the new mayor comes from the RP. Should we not establish a 
dialogue with him simply because he is from the RP?" 
<H5>  Press Reports False </H5>
  On another subject, Baqeri disputed press reports claiming 
that he had proposed a solution to the Kurdish question, 
branding them as false. "The question proposed to me concerned 
the situation of minorities in Iran, especially the Kurdish 
minority. My response was that they do not present a problem 
for us. I also explained Iran's policies concerning its 
minority populations. My intention was not to advise Turkey. 
Either there was a misunderstanding or the false interpretation 
of my statements was done intentionally. My response was in no 
way related to Turkey's problems. I have no interest in them," 
Baqeri said. 
<H5>  PKK Question </H5>
  Meanwhile, Baqeri stressed that his country had cooperated 
with Turkey since the very beginning of its problems with the 
outlawed Kurdistan Workers' Party (PKK). 
  "This cooperation is not new. We have been handing over to 
Turkey people in Iran who have been acting against them. We 
will continue to implement this policy. With the signing of a 
security agreement between the two countries, we have just 
stressed this cooperation one more time. But our stance has 
remained the same since the very beginning of the problem," 
Baqeri pointed out. 
  He also criticized anti-Iranian reports related to the PKK 
issue that have appeared in the Turkish press in the past. "We 
confronted the Turkish authorities about these reports and they 
told us that these articles are created by the press and that 
their own positions do not reflect the views expressed in the 
news reports." 
  Baqeri said that relations between Turkey and Iran were 
very good. He also voiced Iran's pleasure on the cooperation 
between the two countries on issues concerning security. "I 
hope that our relations on security issues will serve as an 
example for other neighboring countries," he said. He also 
mentioned that the general manager of Turkey's security forces, 
Mehmet Agar, would visit Iran soon as an official guest of 
Iran's security and disciplinary forces commander, Gen. Reza 
Seyfullahi. 
<H5>  Common Enemies </H5>
  Baqeri also claimed that Turkey and Iran shared many common 
enemies, forming even closer bonds between the two countries. 
To demonstrate this point, he displayed a map illustrating the 
borders of a Kurdish state which extended into Turkish, Iranian, 
Iraqi and Syrian territories. 
  He explained that the map had been published in Europe last 
week, and said: "Who are our enemies? Who is supporting the 
establishment a Kurdish state? This is a plot of those who are 
falsely claiming to be close to us. Is the exaggeration of news 
about Iran an attempt to cover up these dangerous intentions?" 
Baqeri also noted that Turkish President Suleyman Demirel, 
while he served as prime minister, had shown a similar map to 
Iranian Foreign Minister 'Ali Akbar Velayati and had reportedly 
said during the meeting, "Look what they want to do." Baqeri 
stressed that "it is obvious that some people intend to tear 
away parts of Iran and Turkey. We must be awakened," Baqeri 
stressed. 
<H5>  Israel, Enemy of Muslims </H5>
  In a reference to the development of closer relations 
between 
Turkey and Israel, the Iranian ambassador stressed that Iran 
considers Israel to be untrustworthy. 
  "Turkey makes its own foreign policy. We cannot comment on 
this. But, we do not see them (Israel) as an honest society. 
There is a verse in the holy Koran: It says that they had 
tried to cheat even Allah. They definitely hate Muslims. They 
are the enemies of all Muslims. You can see it in their 
policies," Baqeri said. 
<H5>  Cooperation on Central Asia </H5>
  Meanwhile, Baqeri stressed that the two countries were also 
cooperating on the issue of Central Asia. 
  Despite the propaganda emanating from the Western press 
which 
claims that Turkey and Iran are competing over the newly 
independent countries of Central Asia, the results of the 
cooperation are beginning to bear fruit, Baqeri said. "Turkmen 
natural gas will be transported over Iran to Turkey and to 
Europe by pipeline. The Western and Turkish press have written 
much propaganda, but the realities (of the cooperation) are 
obvious," Baqeri stated. 
  Turkey and Iran also share common views concerning the 
Caucasus, he said. "The two countries are opposed to the 
Armenian invasion. Furthermore, we both have requested that 
Armenia withdraw its forces from the Azeri territory it has 
occupied. Both Iran and Turkey have been providing humanitarian 
aid to Azerbaijan. And, both are helping the Caucasian and 
Central Asian republics within the framework of the Economic 
Cooperation Organization (ECO). There are many examples like 
these." 
  Moreover, he indicated that Iran was prepared to cooperate 
with Russia and Turkey in an attempt to resolve the problem of 
Nagorno-Karabakh. "We informed Moscow and Ankara about our 
readiness to cooperate. We are ready to cooperate with any side 
that is willing to take steps to resolve the Nagorno-Karabakh 
question. Turkey, Russia and Iran are influential countries in 
the Caucasus. Therefore, there is a need for intensive dialogue. 
We are ready for this." 
  Baqeri also mentioned that Iran and Turkey have already 
conducted consultations at the levels of foreign ministry 
general directors, department chiefs and experts. "These kinds 
of consultations are necessary. Ministerial level meetings, 
alone, are not enough. For example, the Turkish Foreign 
Ministry's general director of Caucasia and the Balkans, Omer 
Ersun, visited Iran and their Iranian counterparts have visited 
Ankara--all over the past few months. After discussing the 
issues, we realized that our views were similar." 
  The Iranian ambassador also expressed his government's 
pleasure over Turkey's participation in the Bosnian peacekeeping 
force, known as UNPROFOR [UN Protection Forces]. "We are happy 
about the decision that foresees the presence of Turkish 
peacekeeping troops in Bosnia. The placement of the Muslim 
Turkish soldiers in Bosnia is a situation that is very pleasing 
to Iran." 
  Meanwhile, Baqeri disclosed that there were 48,723 displaced 
Azeris living temporarily in Iran who were receiving aid from 
the Iranian Red Crescent Society (IRCS). 
  According to information provided by the IRCS, seven tent 
camps have been established for Azeri refugees in the border 
areas of Pars Abad in Imishlinskiy, Bileh Savar, Saberabad and 
Saatlinskiy regions since September 1993 and there is an urgent 
need for increased international participation and support for 
them. 
<H5>  Iran Overcomes Economic Troubles </H5>
  Baqeri said that Iran, currently involved in a period of 
reconstruction, was experiencing no economic problem that could 
not be overcome. 
  We are reconstructing the areas that had been damaged during 
the time of the Shah and in the Iran-Iraq war, Baqeri said. He 
disputed the reports that claimed Iran was immersed in great 
economic difficulties, saying that they were untrue and were 
only made to disseminate political propaganda against Iran. 
  "It is normal to experience economic problems. Just look at 
other countries. Although they did not conduct a revolution 
against a regime connected to the United States, or fight an 
eight-year-long war or resist U.S. attempts at political 
domination for 15 years, all of them still are experiencing 
economic problems, including Europe and the United States," 
Baqeri noted. 
  The Iranian ambassador stressed that the current regime in 
Iran represents the first implementation of an Islamic 
government and is now in a period of experimentation in the 
economic field. "We want a state that depends on its own 
resources. Our goal is not to depend on foreign resources. 
However, foreign pressure does have an impact on the Iranian 
economy. 
  ``The United States does not want the Iranian system to be 
successful. To place pressure on the Iranian economy is among 
their leading priorities. By reducing the prices for crude oil, 
they want to negatively affect the Iranian economy so that they 
can say that the Iranian system is unsuccessful,'' Baqeri 
claimed. 
  He said that the United States was "trying to place pressure 
on the countries that were having economic relations with Iran. 
Yet, they are always calling on Iran to establish economic 
relations with them while trying to prevent other countries from 
having economic relations with Iran," he said. [quotation mark 
as published] 
  Baqeri also said that Iran was beginning to implement second 
five-year developing plans in which the main goal was to develop 
the country's very rich natural resources. ``Iran has very rich 
resources along with its reserves of crude oil. Iran's natural 
gas stocks are the second largest in the world. 
  ``We also have other resources. We have prepared an economic 
plan that is not as dependent on crude oil export revenues. We 
are now preparing to pass the plan, but obstacles still remain. 
The Iranian nation is prepared to make sacrifices. In the 
period of economic trouble, we eat and drink less,'' Baqeri 
stated. Meanwhile, Baqeri said that Iran had offered a proposal 
to Turkey related to increased cooperation in the area of the 
automotive and spare parts manufacturing industry. 
  "In one or two months, we are expecting a delegation from 
the 
Turkish Ministry of Industry and Trade to investigate the 
opportunities for cooperation. We are hopeful about this issue 
because there are many opportunities," Baqeri said.

  [Text] Bulgarian Defense Minister Valentin Aleksandrov, 
who is in Ankara on an official visit, has been continuing his 
contacts. The guest minister met with State Minister Necmettin 
Cevheri in the afternoon. 
  Cevheri pointed out to the importance of friendly and 
neighborly relations between Turkey and Bulgaria in establishing 
peace and stability in the Balkans. Stressing that Bulgaria has 
views similar to Turkey's regarding Bosnia-Herzegovina, Cevheri 
noted that action should be taken in unison with international 
organizations to eliminate this issue from being a sensitive 
matter in Europe. 
  Aleksandrov, in turn, stated that they are following the 
incidents in Bosnia-Herzegovina with great concern. He stressed 
that Bulgaria opposes actions taking place in the region 
directed toward ethnic cleansing and territorial acquisition 
through the use of force. 
  President Suleyman Demirel received the Bulgarian defense 
minister and accompanying delegation at the Cankaya Mansion. 
Demirel conferred with Aleksandrov for some time. National 
Defense Minister Mehmet Golhan also participated at the meeting.

  [Text] Ankara, April 13 (A.A.) -- Turkey will continue to 
supply electricity to Northern Iraq as soon as the lines which 
were sabotaged by terrorists are repaired. 
  The terrorists had sabotaged the part of the lines running 
into Northern Iraq and as a result no power has been sent to 
that region since Sunday [10 April]. 
  Foreign Ministry spokesman Ferhat Ataman said at his weekly 
briefing that repair works are underway. 
  Baghdad has cut off power to Northern Iraq. Turkey announced 
last week it will help the region to meet its needs.

  [Text] Ankara--The day after Prime Minister Tansu Ciller 
disclosed her bitter austerity program, official statistics 
revealed that Turkey's domestic debt stock at the end of 1993 
reached an all-time high of TL [Turkish Lira] 356.5 trillion, or 
27 percent of the gross national product (GNP). 
  The debt stock had accounted for a lower 23.3 percent of the 
GNP in 1992. 
  The Treasury said on Wednesday [6 April] that the government 
during the entire year of 1993 incurred fresh borrowing worth TL 
577.7 trillion but repaid some of this, leaving a net borrowing 
amount of TL 160.6 trillion. 
  It said the debt stock rose by a radical 83.6 percent from 
TL 
194.2 trillion at the end of 1992. 
  The original program target was a debt stock of TL 251.7 
trillion for the entire 1993, but this had been exceeded as 
early as last August.

  [Text] Brussels, April 13 (AFP) -- Treaties to accept 
Austria, Finland, Norway and Sweden into the European Union [EU] 
were formally wrapped up and printed here Wednesday [13 April], 
EU officials said. 
  The treaties took more than a year to negotiate. The final 
major obstacle was removed last month when Britain removed its 
objections to a modification of EU voting rules to take account 
of the EU's first enlargement since 1986. 
  The officials said the treaties were being sent to the 
European Parliament, which must approve them by May 5 if the 
four countries are to have any chance of joining the 12-nation 
union by the target date of January 1 next year. 
  The treaties must also be ratified by the parliaments of EU 
countries, and by popular referendums in all four of the 
applicant countries. 
  Last-minute sticking points, involving particularly fishing 
disputes with Norway and Sweden, were finally overcome late 
Tuesday, the officials said.

  [Text] Defence Secretary Malcolm Rifkind today expressed 
hope about peace in Bosnia, but warned a settlement would not 
come "in a sudden blaze of glory." He reaffirmed British troops 
would be sent to the Muslim town of Gorazde only when a 
ceasefire was in place. And he expressed confidence in 
Lieutenant General Sir Michael Rose, the UN commander on the 
ground in Bosnia, who has asked for troops to police Gorazde. 
  In spite of the Serb assault on the town and the United 
Nations' attacks in response, Mr Rifkind said: "I believe we are 
still in the position of considerable hope compared to the past. 
One has always assumed it will be a situation of three steps 
forward, one step back." 
  He added: "It is not going to happen overnight. We are not 
going to have a sudden peace settlement in a sudden blaze of 
glory. It's going to be worked on slowly and painfully. But 
over the last few weeks we have seen more progress than we have 
seen in two years and that is a cause for cautious optimism." 
  He told BBC Radio 4's Today programme, from New York, that 
British troops would be needed in Gorazde to monitor the 
situation, man the checkpoints and disarm and get between the 
combatants. 
  Responding to Sir Michael's request for troops there, Mr 
Rifkind paid tribute to him and said: "I don't think we should 
normally try and second guess the commander in the field as to 
how he wishes to use the forces at his disposal. He knows the 
local scene. He knows the best impact that can be made by using 
his forces in a particular way."

  [Text] Bonn (DDP/ADN) -- German Chancellor Helmut Kohl 
referred to the increasing importance of the United Nations in 
peacekeeping and the solution of conflicts in the world in a 
talk with UN Secretary General Butrus Butrus-Ghali today. 
Government Spokesman Dieter Vogel announced in Bonn this 
evening that the two sides agreed that efforts to solve the 
conflicts in the Middle East and the former Yugoslavia must be 
resolutely continued. 
  Kohl and Butrus-Ghali assessed the recent UN-sponsored NATO 
operations against Serb positions in Bosnia as "necessary" and 
"appropriate." These were in accordance with the relevant UN 
Security Council resolution. The two sides spoke in favor of 
energetically continuing the peace process with the inclusion of 
the United States and Russia. 
  Kohl underlined Germany's readiness to assume responsibility 
in the United Nations as a permanent member of the Security 
Council in the future. Ghali confirmed that the transfer of the 
UN volunteer program to Bonn is envisaged as the first step. 
Kohl underlined the German Government's offer to have other UN 
bodies located in Bonn. 
  Eberhard Brecht, deputy foreign policy spokesman for the 
Social Democratic Party [SPD], admitted in a statement that 
Germany is still "not up to the international community's 
expectations of our country." The Social Democrats share the UN 
secretary general's view that Germany's commitment to the United 
Nations still does not match its performance in the various 
political spheres. The SPD supports the demand made of the 
German Government by Butrus-Ghali for "a high level of 
commitment in all the organization's activities," Brecht said.

Butrus-Ghali has spoken in support of Germany becoming a 
permanent member of the UN Security Council [UNSC]. This was, 
however, a purely personal view, Butrus-Ghali said after a talk 
with German Foreign Minister Klaus Kinkel in Bonn today. The 
decision on this issue lay with the UN General Assembly, he said. 
  Butrus-Ghali underlined the United Nations' desire that 
Germany should play a greater role in international UN missions. 
He hoped that the constitutional clarification needed for this 
is achieved soon and that Germany will then also be able to 
participate fully in UN missions.

<F P=106> [Unattributed report: "Caligaris: `NATO Is Getting It </F>
Wrong'"] 
  [Text] Rome -- The NATO bombing of Gorazde and its policy 
toward the former Yugoslavia were the center of attention 
yesterday for the victors of the 28 March elections. First to 
comment was former General Luigi Caligaris, who could assume a 
post (foreign affairs or defense) in a future Berlusconi 
government. Caligaris stated that he was against NATO 
intervention in the skies over Bosnia: "The deterrence function 
of NATO aircraft above Gorazde," Caligaris stated, "has no 
influence once the situation on the ground is uncontrollable. 
The political world," the general added, "must show that it is 
willing to intervene in this situation. However, it does not 
wish to risk a ground operation which, at the present time, no 
one is in a position to undertake." The United States itself, 
according to Caligaris, is afraid of getting mixed up in an 
operation which could last for years and result in a large 
number of human casualties. The sole solution to the problem 
should come, in the opinion of the Forza Italia expert, from a 
political intervention aimed at the protagonists, "as is 
currently being done." 
  The Northern League, on the other hand, has come out in 
favor 
of a hard line in Bosnia and "approves and supports 
Butrus-Ghali's and NATO's firmness in having the UN ultimatums 
respected." Christian Monti, League foreign affairs spokesman, 
stated that "the NATO bombardments of Gorazde are nothing more 
than the logical and necessary implementation of the UN 
resolution, following the umpteenth violation by the Serbs of 
the ultimatum issued to safeguard the Bosnian community." 
  Meanwhile, Forza Italia parliamentarians meeting in Fiuggi 
yesterday approved an agenda reminding the Ciampi government of 
the need "not to prejudice, by irreversible actions, the 
question of Slovenia and Croatia's accession to the European 
Union." The agenda, promoted by Antonietta Vascon, an Istrian 
refugee and deputy for Trieste, emphasizes that this is a 
question which "involves" the rights of 350,000 exiles from 
Istria and Dalmatia and Italian minorities in these states. 
Forza Italia reminded the government "of its duty to stick 
strictly to day-to-day administrative responsibilities." 
According to Forza Italia, "the government which is in power 
for a few days longer, and which is an expression of political 
balances that have been displaced by the popular vote, has, in 
recent weeks, made decisions which prejudice, at times 
irreversibly, questions which are delicate and frequently 
crucial to future developments." For this reason the Forza 
Italia parliamentarians "give warning that this practice must be 
stopped immediately out of respect for the most elementary 
democratic principles." "Very great satisfaction" at Vascon's 
agenda, also supported by Berlusconi, was expressed by lawyer 
Paolo Sardos Albertini, president of the Federation of Istrian, 
Fiume, and Dalmatian exiles.

CSO 

    [Editorial Report] Portugal's stance on Europe and the 12 
June European Parliament elections have sparked commentaries in 
the Lisbon press. 
<H5>  PSD, PS Candidates Discussed </H5>
  The choice of long-time Social Democratic Party (PSD) 
luminary and former Deputy Prime Minister Eurico de Melo as head 
of the PSD list for the Euroelections is considered "surprising" 
by commentator Jose Antonio Saraiva in the 12 March Lisbon 
weekly EXPRESSO. Inasmuch as European elections, which lack the 
significance of legislative or municipal elections, often lead 
voters to select a party other than their own, the determining 
factor in the election is the identity of the head of the list, 
Saraiva comments. Consequently, the difference in the June 
Euroelections will be made by leader of the rightist Center 
Social Democratic (CDS) party Manuel Monteiro, who is running 
for the European Parliament on a platform of "nationalism"--as 
opposed to the internationalist values of the European 
community--that seems to be widely accepted by large groups of 
people. In addition, Monteiro's youth personifies the revolt of 
the new generation against the obligations assumed by the old. 
Eurico de Melo, while certainly not anti-European, will 
therefore be considered the "symbol of the old generation's 
abdication to European interests." He will thus contribute to 
the "aging" of the PSD, Saraiva concludes, adding that only 
speculation can explain Cavaco Silva's choice. By choosing a 
politician who made a smooth transition from legendary Prime 
Minister 5a Carneiro's era to "Cavaco-ism" and who supported 
Cavaco Silva from the outset, the prime minister may have wished 
to bring internal pacification to his party, or he may have 
launched a "trial balloon" to gauge de Melo's chances for the 
next presidential elections. 
  Saraiva returns to the same theme in the 1 April EXPRESSO, 
this time stressing the "defensive" side of Cavaco Silva's 
choice. Fearing that Monteiro's nationalist discourse may 
resonate in the social democratic electorate, the prime minister 
sought a "conventional" candidate who cannot be suspected of 
"Europeanist excesses," Saraiva contends. However, Cavaco Silva 
may have erred. Monteiro, the embodiment of young urban voters 
who "tasted the delights of Europe and did not like them," seeks 
to represent youth revolt in a crisis of values that rejects 
foreign influences and "rallies round the flag in a 
future-oriented, post-European reaction." For his part, Eurico 
de Melo's "non-Europeanism" is not a reaction to Portugal's 
European experience, but the product of natural conservatism 
anchored in the past, Saraiva comments. The Euroelections may 
thus be reduced to a battle between "Euroenthusiasts," who will 
vote for the European-minded Socialist Party (PS), and 
"Euroskeptics," who will choose Monteiro's CDS. 
  According to Cristina Figueiredo writing in the 12 March 
EXPRESSO, Northern politicians are "exulting" over Porto 
resident Eurico de Melo's candidacy. In their opinion, Cavaco 
Silva is indicating he will support him for the presidency, 
provided de Melo obtains "at least" 40 percent of the June vote. 
Diametrically opposed are those who believe that, while the 
prime minister has definitely parried off a de Melo presidential 
candidacy, simultaneously fielding an "illustrious" candidate 
for the Europarliament, he has, in the process, lost a good 
presidential candidate and created the problem of "reviving the 
hopes of former President Ramalho Eanes," Figueiredo comments. 
  On the PS side, following a week of uncertainty and 
"intensive talks" between leader Antonio Guterres and PS 
luminary Vitor Constancio, the latter finally rejected 
Guterres's offer to head the Euroelections list, writes Jeronimo 
Pimentel in the 26 March Lisbon daily PUBLICO. The final 
candidate is long-time party official Antonio Vitorino. Joao 
Soares's nomination for the second spot relegated well-known PS 
official Joao Cravinho to third place--even if Cravinho headed 
the list in the 1989 Euroelections and is cited by Pimentel as 
being "disappointed"--and may cause great intraparty confusion, 
Pimentel comments. It will also expose Guterres to criticism for 
the manner in which negotiations were conducted. 
  Constancio's presence at the head of the PS list would have 
been a threat to Cavaco Silva and a success for Guterres, 
contends Joao Amaral in the 26 March Lisbon weekly SEMANARIO. 
While Europe continues to be an "eminently political" issue at a 
theoretical level, it is an "essentially economic" question for 
the people, who are less concerned with threats to national 
sovereignty than with subsidies from Brussels, he writes. 
Constancio, a "prestigious and moderate" politician as well as a 
"respected and competent technocrat"--all Cavaco Silva's 
attributes as well--would have been the "most Cavaco-ist" of the 
candidates to the European Parliament and could have attracted 
PSD voters, Amaral continues. Additionally, economist Constancio 
has in-depth knowledge of his field, a factor of fundamental 
importance to the man-in-the-street when he thinks of Europe. 
Cavaco Silva must have "breathed a sigh of relief" when 
Vitorino's choice was announced, Amaral comments. 
<H5>  Stance on Europe </H5>
  Writing in the 19 March EXPRESSO, Jose Antonio Saraiva 
reviews the candidacies for the Europarliament. CDS leader 
Manuel Monteiro is "feared" by other candidates for his 
unabashed "patriotic" feelings. PSD candidate Eurico de Melo is 
not considered a convinced Europeanist. Before choosing 
Constancio, the PS sounded out Manuel Alegre, a "romantic" who 
sees Portugal's future linked more to Africa and Brazil than to 
the "bourgeois states" of Europe. Finally, the Communist Party's 
(PCP) candidate, Luis Sa, is well-known for his anti-Europeanist 
stance. Saraiva contends that advocating European unity is 
increasingly considered a "sin" in Portugal. In their speeches, 
ministers are now less eager to "exalt" the European ideal, 
while they unceasingly stress that European integration will 
safeguard Portuguese interests. Consequently, the PSD will have 
to "use doubletalk" in the June elections: Eurico de Melo will 
make "patriotic" speeches while the government simultaneously 
concludes agreements that in fact will increasingly restrict 
Portuguese sovereignty. Saraiva concludes that Euroelections may 
thus be transformed into a public opinion poll centering on the 
Portuguese perception of the future of Europe and the role 
Portugal will play in it. 
  It is increasingly obvious that the initial enthusiasm for 
Portugal's European integration is waning and that "two Europes" 
are confronting each other in a Europe essentially defined by 
market priorities and profits, writes Fernando Rosas in the 23 
March PUBLICO. One is a community where unprecedented levels of 
productivity and accumulation translate into a large-scale 
offensive against employment, salaries, and social gains rather 
than a fairer distribution of wealth, improved welfare, and 
increased access to culture; a community where extraordinary 
technological advances coexist with the most savage attacks 
against the environment; a Europe that excludes its poor Eastern 
and Southern neighbors; a world condemned to an anonymous and 
uncontrolled bureaucracy, whose federalist ideal has been 
reduced to "two speeds," Rosas contends. The other Europe is the 
political heir of the the French Revolution, a community of 
citizens, human and minority rights, secular institutions, 
international solidarity, and the right to public education. In 
sum, a Europe that largely represents "the heritage that 
differentiates contemporary European culture," Rosas writes, 
adding that a careful observation of social and political events 
in the EU makes it uncertain whether these two Europes can 
continue to coexist in the future. 
  "Suddenly, complete disorientation has occurred," exclaims 
Jose Manuel Fernandes in a 19 March PUBLICO editorial in view of 
the "grotesqueness" of the Euroelectoral campaign, in which all 
parties are vying to field the most anti-Europeanist candidates. 
In the view of both Cavaco Silva and Guterres, Euroelections are 
a mere rehearsal for the 1995 legislative elections, and a 
discussion of Europe holds no interest, Fernandes contends. Had 
a referendum taken place over the ratification of the Maastricht 
Treaty, it would have allowed the "ghosts" evoked by Manuel 
Monteiro to be put to rest, he continues. The situation is more 
complex at present, especially because Europe has generally been 
reduced to a monetary question and to wrangling over Portugal's 
share of community funds at the same time that a fundamental 
issue such as intervention in Bosnia--which presupposes a common 
foreign and defense policy--is ignored. In their haste to 
outflank Monteiro, concludes Fernandes, the PSD and the PS seem 
unsure of whether they want a "Europe of grants" with Portugal 
waiting for handouts, or a gradually integrated and mighty 
Europe where the strong help the weak, even at the cost of a 
partial transfer of sovereignty.

  [Text] Robert Lamb, U.S. State Department special 
coordinator for Cyprus affairs, will be arriving on the island 
today. President Rauf Denktas will receive Lamb tomorrow. 
  The Greek Cypriot radio announced that Lamb is not bringing 
any new proposals but that he will conduct more effective 
initiatives for the adaptation of the 21 March UN document. 
Lamb will leave the island on Friday [15 April] after 
concluding his contacts. 
  Denktas said that nobody can take away the Turkish Cypriot 
people's just rights by force. Assessing Lamb's unexpected 
visit on the island, Denktas noted that there are efforts to 
conduct new ploys in Cyprus. Denktas stressed that Lamb's 
arrival in Cyprus at a time when the Turkish Prime Minister 
Tansu Ciller is visiting the United States gives rise to thought. 
  Denktas stated that the Greek Cypriot side is responsible 
for 
the deadlock reached in the proximity talks regarding the 
confidence-building measures, and added that the Turkish Cypriot 
side is open to new suggestions that Lamb may bring forward. 
  Indicating that it is natural for Tugay Ulucevik, Turkish 
Foreign Ministry deputy under secretary, to visit the Turkish 
Republic of Northern Cyprus, Denktas pointed out the advantages 
of frequent exchanges of views with Ankara. 
  Indicating that Turkish and Greek Cypriot youths 
participating in the archery competition held under the auspices 
of the United Nations in the Greek Cypriot side has no political 
aspect, Denktas added that these kinds of events should not be 
transformed into a political message. Noting that these kinds 
of political messages prevent the development of events that 
further intercommunal personal contacts, Denktas added that 
these events are not related to the Cyprus issue. 
  Reiterating that the Turkish Cypriot cannot live under Greek 
Cypriot administration nor under the United Nations control, 
Denktas stressed that for a permanent agreement, the Turkish 
Cypriot should live freely under equal rights and conditions as 
the Greek Cypriots.

  [Text] Albania has chosen to stir up its relations with 
Athens. Despite the calm position of Athens, it [words 
indistinct]. Albanian President Sali Berisha's government today 
tried to worsen Greek-Albanian relations claiming that shots 
were fired between Greek and Albanian soldiers at the Episkopi 
guardpost near the Greek-Albanian border. 
  Defense Ministry sources believe the minor incident is 
another Albanian provocation that aims to intensify tension in 
bilateral relations. Defense Ministry officials stressed that 
Greece is following the situation on the Greek-Albanian border 
coolly and carefully. The groups of the 8th Corps are highly 
vigilant, according to the measures that are in effect. 
  Tirana yesterday announced the deportation of Greek Consul 
in 
Gjirokaster Khristos Iakovou, forcing the Greek Government to 
expel the Albanian Embassy's first secretary in Athens. 
  A Foreign Ministry statement stresses that the Greek 
Government regrets these developments for which the Albanian 
side is entirely responsible, adding that Albania is trying to 
use the recent incident on its territory involving unidentified 
elements to create tension on an international level. A short 
time ago, the Albanian Foreign Ministry announced that it is 
recalling Albanian Ambassador in Athens Hysen Cabej for 
consultations. 
  Lieutenant Colonel Kalantzandonakis, the Armed Forces 
General 
Staff press spokesman, today said there is a high level of 
vigilance on the Greek-Albanian border. He added that this is 
not because of the recent incidents but the problem of illegal 
immigrants. 
  Asked to comment on the escalating tension in Greek-Albanian 
relations, government spokesman Evangelos Venizelos said the 
Greek Government is following, coolly and carefully, the 
escalating tension in relations with Albania. Our country's 
firm policy is to improve Greek-Albanian relations, Albania's 
development, and its securing an economic, institutionalized, 
and cultural atmosphere. The spokesman said that in a letter 
from Foreign Minister Karolos Papoulias to his Albanian 
counterpart, the Greek Government says it wants the tension to 
be reduced. Venizelos said there was no reply to the letter. 
  Foreign Ministry Secretary General Khristos Zakharakis will 
send a letter to the United Nations replying to Albanian Foreign 
Minister Alfred Serreqi's claims. Foreign Ministry Permanent 
Secretary Pavlos Apostolidhis summoned the ambassadors of the UN 
Security Council permanent members and briefed them. The heads 
of Greek Embassies abroad will brief the governments of the 
countries to which they are accredited. 
  Referring to the latest incident on the Greek-Albanian 
border, Venizelos said the government only has press reports on 
it. He noted that the Greek Government has no evidence or 
information to support that a Greek group left Greek territory 
to cause incidents. The spokesman concluded by saying that for 
reasons of goodwill, the government suggested to the Albanian 
Government that the Greek and Albanian authorities cooperate.

  [Text] President Suleyman Demirel has received Mate 
Granic, Croatian deputy prime minister and foreign minister, who 
is on an official visit in Ankara, at the Cankaya Mansion. 
  According to a statement issued by the Press Center of the 
President's Office, Granic thanked Turkey for its support and 
constructive stand in solving the problems associated with the 
dissolution of Yugoslavia. Granic stated that despite the swift 
implementation of the Croatian-Bosnian agreement signed in 
Washington, the Bosnians and the Croats are forced to flee their 
homes because of continuing Serbian attacks. Granic invited 
Demirel to Zagreb and Sarajevo. 
  Demirel, in turn, stated that establishing peace in Bosnia- 
Herzegovina will prevent the clashes from spreading to Kosovo, 
Sandzak, Vojvodina, Macedonia [The Former Yugoslav Republic of 
Macedonia--FYROM], and the rest of the Balkans. 
  Demirel stated that he will be very happy to visit Zagreb 
and 
Sarajevo at a [word indistinct] time when he can contribute to 
the peace process.

  [Excerpts] Paris, April 13 (AFP) -- France called on 
Wednesday [13 April] for an international effort to restore 
peace to Rwanda, saying Paris cannot be "the policeman of 
Africa." 
  Development Aid Minister Michel Roussin, addressing the 
National Assembly, said it was "the international community's 
duty to take over from us and the United Nations should now 
bring together the different parties and bring the protagonists 
to a ceasefire." 
  In the Senate, Defence Minister Francois Leotard said the 
last of 450 French paratroopers flown into the central African 
state at the weekend were about to be withdrawn. 
  The French, who flew in from their base in nearby Central 
African Republic, evacuated 1,300 foreign nationals from the 
Rwandan capital Kigali, 454 of them French. [passage omitted] 
  The minister also confirmed the deaths of two French 
gendarmes who were military advisors and the wife of one of 
them, without giving details. He said the bodies would be 
repatriated. 
  On Saturday Army Chief of Staff Jacques Lanxade said he 
believed they had been killed by rebels of the Rwandan Patriotic 
Front (RPF). 
  Roussin also paid tribute to the three French crew who died 
with Rwandan President Juvenal Habyarimana when his plane 
crashed as it was landing in Kigali last Friday. Burundian 
President Cyprien Ntaryamira was also killed in the crash. 
  The UN already has 2,300 soldiers and 300 observers in 
Rwanda 
from 23 countries. Nearly 1,000 of them come from Bangladesh, 
840 from Ghana and 420 from Belgium.

  [Excerpts] Fighting continues in the Rwandan capital,

expatriate community. That mission has now been accomplished. 
As to the ongoing situation, Cooperation Minister Michel 
Roussin this afternoon told parliament that France has no 
intention of acting as the policeman of Africa: 
  [Begin Roussin recording] France has not ceased to try to 
mobilize public opinion in Africa and across the world. We did 
not sit back with our arms folded. Though we realize that the

paratroopers to ensure the evacuation of more than 1,500 people, 
let me tell you that the prime minister today asked the foreign

the policeman of Africa. The international community has a duty 
to take over from us, and the United Nations must now bring the

  [Text] Paris, April 14 (AFP) -- Russian ultra-nationalist 
leader Vladimir Zhirinovskiy left for home on Thursday [14 
April] after complaining French police had failed to protect him 
from "Jewish extremists." 
  Zhirinovskiy was referring to Jewish protestors who 
demonstrated on Monday outside the Russian consulate where he 
was staying. He spat at the demonstrators, threw clods of earth 
and threatened them with his "atomic revolver." 
  On Wednesday the extremist MP, who was part of a Russian 
parliamentary delegation at the spring session of the Council of 
European parliament, said "I am leaving this country where the 
police fails to protect me from the attacks of Jewish 
extremists." 
  Zhirinovsky adopted a low profile since Tuesday after being 
warned to behave himself by the French Foreign Ministry. He 
attended all parliamentary sessions quietly, but failed in 
attempts to take part in meetings of party groups. 
  On Monday he had called liberal parliamentarians "CIA 
agents" 
and inside the the Council chamber, he denounced NATO air raids 
against Bosnian Serbs and suggested Russia should bomb European 
cities. 
  When he arrived in France on Sunday, Zhirinovsky berated the 
host country and also Germany, saying Paris would be "an Arab 
city in 10 or 20 years" and Germany would be taken over by 
Turkish immigrants. "Soon, Russia will be the only white country 
left in Europe."

<F P=106> [Interview with Moussa Kraouche, spokesman of the Algerian </F>
Fraternity in France, by Ivan Rioufol; place and date not given: 
"Low Profile for Islamists in France" -- first paragraph is LE 
FIGARO introduction] 
  [Text] Moussa Kraouche, aged 34, is the spokesman for the 
Algerian Fraternity in France (FAF), an organization which has 
close ties with the Islamic Salvation Front (FIS). He denies 
that his organization is involved in any way, either directly or 
indirectly, with the secret terrorist network attributed to the 
FIS, which was recently broken up in Lille. Moussa Kraouche had 
been called in for questioning and detained during the round-up 
of Islamists last November. The police maintained that, in his 
home, they had found documents originating, in particular, from 
the Armed Islamic Group (GIA). However, as a result of the 
dubious origin of one of these documents, it was impossible to 
establish any links between the FAF and the GIA . 
  [Rioufol] Do you know the two suspected FIS sympathizers who 
were arrested in Lille? 
  [Kraouche] No. However, it is too early to say whether or 
not they are members of the FIS. I cannot help noticing that, 
depending on what suits the media, either all Algerians belong 
to the FIS or the FIS is portrayed as a minority group. There 
is no evidence to support the allegation that these two persons 
are even FIS sympathizers. If ever that proved to be the case, 
then they would have to answer to the legal authorities for 
their acts. 
  [Rioufol] The FIS is accused of running secret terrorist 
networks in France. 
  [Kraouche] I officially refute such a claim, which was 
merely 
made to frighten public opinion! We condemn any illegal action 
undertaken on French soil or elsewhere. The line followed by 
the Algerian Fraternity in France is one that is governed by 
legality. 
  [Rioufol] That may be, but the Algerian Fraternity in France 
has very close links with the FIS. 
  [Kraouche] Admittedly, we do sympathize with the aims of the 
FIS, which is an organization that is not officially recognized 
in France. 
  [Rioufol] But the FIS has been directly implicated in 
terrorist attacks committed in Algeria. 
  [Kraouche] You cannot describe them as terrorist actions! 
Terrorism merely exists when perpetrated against a legitimate 
state. In Algeria, it is popular resistance which is mounting 
against an illegitimate, illegal military dictatorship. No 
terrorist actions are being committed in Algeria. 
  [Rioufol] How can you say that? Only recently, two young 
girls were killed because they were not wearing the Muslim veil. 
  [Kraouche] Two veiled young girls were also killed. In any 
event, these acts have nothing to do with the Islamists. People 
are not killed for not wearing a veil. Furthermore, the Koran 
preaches: "No religious constraint." We are against the murder 
of innocent people or foreigners in Algeria. Not everything can 
be blamed on the FIS! It is provocation! 
  [Rioufol] Are you trying to tell us that these acts are 
provocations perpetrated by the present government? 
  [Kraouche] Most certainly! The military security forces play 
a very important role there. They have released 10,000 
prisoners convicted under common law so that they can 
incarcerate Islamists. The people they released are individuals 
who are prepared to commit criminal acts. The violence in 
Algeria is not the work of Islamists, but of the junta and those 
who support it, like Said Sadi. That is a very serious matter. 
  [Rioufol] Do you support what is currently happening in 
Algeria? 
  [Kraouche] Not everything, no. I support the legal struggle 
by the Algerian people to regain their dignity and victory, 
which was snatched away from them during the last general 
election. 
  [Rioufol] Do you have links with the Armed Islamic Group? 
  [Kraouche] We have no links with the GIA, nor with any other 
armed group. In France we are a legal association with the 
specific mission to inform people about what is going on. Our 
objective is to disclose the repression under which the Algerian 
people is suffering. 
  [Rioufol] If the FIS comes to power in Algeria, do you think 
there is reason to fear a clash within the Muslim community 
living in France? 
  [Kraouche] The Muslim community in France wants a rapid 
solution that would stop the bloodshed. If the FIS were to come 
to power tomorrow, then we can assure you that everything will 
proceed peacefully. There is no cause for concern. It is the 
differences existing within Algerian society that lend it its 
richness. 
  [Rioufol] Soothing words, but at the moment a very large 
number of Algerian intellectuals are leaving their homeland 
where they are being physically threatened. 
  [Kraouche] It is not soothing. In Algeria the military junta 
has constantly repressed the people.

  [Text] Paris, April 13 (AFP) -- French Prime Minister 
Edouard Balladur dropped nine points in a month to 44 percent in 
a popularity poll to be published here on Thursday [14 April]. 
  In the poll by the BVA institute for the weekly PARIS-MATCH, 
socialist President Francois Mitterrand shed a point, but at 46 
percent was two points ahead of his conservative prime minister. 
  It was the third time in recent polls that Mitterrand has 
been more popular than Balladur. A CSA institute poll for the 
Catholic weekly LA VIE at the end of March gave 45 percent to 
the president and 40 percent to the prime minister. Figures in a 
Gallup poll at the beginning of April for the weekly EXPRESS 
were 48 and 42 percent. 
  The poll also said there was a five-point increase to 68 
percent in the numbers dissatisfied with the way France is being 
governed, compared with 25 percent satisfied, a six-point fall. 
  On the left, Olympique Marseille chairman Bernard Tapie, who 
faces embezzlement and bribery charges, was up six points to 33 
percent, ahead of opposition Socialist Party leader Michel 
Rocard, who gained a point to 27 percent.

  [Text] In the National Assembly this afternoon the 
Socialist and Communist deputies tabled a no-confidence motion 
that had no chance of being adopted, and was furthermore, 
rejected a few seconds ago, as it received only 87 votes, and it 
would take 289 to bring the government down. 
  However, it was a good opportunity nevertheless, to 
criticize 
the social policy of the government of Edouard Balladur, and, as 
the Socialist Martin Malvy said, to compare the promises made 
with the results obtained. Communist Alain Bocquet for his part 
advocated the abrogation of the five-year law on employment. 
The prime minister replied during the afternoon: This 
no-confidence motion was tabled by the very same people who are 
responsible for the situation that we inherited.

<F P=106> [Interview with Employment Minister Michel Giraud by Gerard </F>
Desportes, place and date not given: "The Employment Act -- 
Michel Giraud Maintains Course on Turbulent Sea" -- first 
paragraph is LIBERATION introduction] 
  [Text] Employment Minister Michel Giraud will no doubt have 
a difficult time this afternoon in Parliament. "His" five-year 
Employment Act is to be attacked by both opposition, which has 
filed a motion of censure against the government's employment 
policy, and majority representatives. To be sure, the act 
remains in force; a new decree to implement the new measures is 
expected within a week. A few days after the withdrawal of the 
CIP [job training contract] Michel Giraud speaks out and reacts 
to the criticisms on his bill, while opposition from unions and 
employers remains strong. 
  [Desportes] Today the opposition will attempt to "censure" 
your five-year Employment Act. How do you feel about this 
avalanche of criticisms both from the Left and the Right? 
  [Giraud] Beyond the CIP, there is a combination of several 
factors. The various economic partners even have more 
reservations now than they used to have about anything that 
questions tradition and habits. Odd as it may seem, there is 
precious little acceptance when it comes to adjusting policies 
and resources to a world that changes every day. On the other 
hand, waiting for a return to growth obviously makes people even 
more impatient. Finally, the impending presidential election 
has intensified rivalries. So I'm facing a more or less 
permanent state of confusion which, it seems to me, too often 
lacks serenity and objectivity. I repeat that my goal is to 
channel all my energy into the fight against unemployment. And 
although I think that criticisms are often unjustified, I will 
not let them prevent me from pursuing the mission I have been 
entrusted with by Edouard Balladur. 
  [Desportes] What if you could do things all over again? 
  [Giraud] There are two mistakes I readily acknowledge. The 
message from the National Assembly's Social Affairs Commission 
was clear and strong enough that more heed should have been paid 
to it. Second, insufficient explanations were given, which 
complicated matters. I do say explanations, not consultation, 
because there was never such a thing as the bombshell mentioned 
by some people. We provided the economic players with all the 
information they needed. 
  [Desportes] Will the CIP affair slow down the implementation 
of the five-year act? 
  [Giraud] I will be even more cautious as a result of it, but 
the act will not, repeat not, be put on the back burner. It 
brings many solutions which we sorely need with regard to the 
organization of labor: preserving work contracts, giving 
businesses more flexibility, but also giving employees more 
freedom to choose their own lifestyle. 
  [Desportes] On this issue, there will be three major 
criticisms when the act's "working time" section is implemented. 
The first has to do with the annualization of working time. 
Are you still willing, as a tradeoff, to grant a reduction of 
working hours? 
  [Desportes] I would remind you that before the bill was 
voted we had agreed that an annualization of working time would 
be linked with reduced working hours. This was a formal request 
by the CFDT [French Democratic Confederation of Labor], which 
employers agreed to. The idea was to negotiate the cuts. This 
is what was voted in Article 38 of the Act, which provides for 
an easier shift to annualized working time by businesses, but 
also requires them to reduce the overall work time. Let me 
repeat this: It requires them to reduce work time. 
  [Desportes] The CGT [General Confederation of Labor] and FO 
[Workers' Force] condemn the fact that you are making working 
time more flexible. 
  [Giraud] One issue has to do with integrating a training 
component into the job. A young worker can expect to switch 
occupations three of four times in the course of a lifetime. 
How can an employee be expected to adjust to new activities 
without being given the time to prepare for them? Second issue: 
There is a demand for more time to be reserved for leisure and 
family life. Therefore we need to rethink the structure of work 
life. We also are terribly behind in terms of part-time work, 
especially with respect to the female population. In short, I 
consider that a shift to annualized work arrangements which 
leads to a reduction in working hours deserves some effort on 
the part of the economic players. I would add that everything 
will be negotiated between employers and unions. 
  [Desportes] Critics also condemn the annualization of 
part-time work which you pushed through Parliament. Do you want 
to turn these people into intermittent workers? 
  [Giraud] The act includes a series of safeguards. Here, 
too, consultations will have to be held within companies. This 
measure will not be an arbitrary one. In the catering sector, 
for example, this arrangement will make it possible to pay 
employees, who were paid only six or seven times per year, on a 
monthly basis. From the point of view of the company, 
annualized part-time work increases the flexibility it needs to 
adjust to the current context. 
  [Desportes] Third criticism, unions believe that, due to all 
these measures, overtime will become a thing of the past, since 
working hours are now viewed over a year instead of a week. 
  [Giraud] Wrong. But I do recognize that the relevant 
article (Art. 42) is not all that easy to understand. Overtime 
payments on top of a regualar salary remain possible, but 
compensation time arrangements will be improved. However, it 
will be made more difficult for companies to have employees work 
overtime. One needs to know what one wants -- what we want is 
to create jobs. 
  [Desportes] Do you expect tangible results of the "working 
time" section? 
  [Giraud] Of course. First of all, a reduction of working 
hours so that a number of unemployed can find a job. Second, an 
incentive to negotiate, including within small- and medium-sized 
businesses. I am perfectly aware that there are objections on 
various levels. We must find ways to overcome them, but, on the 
other hand, unfounded accusations must stop. 
  [Desportes] Nevertheless, such objections are numerous, for 
example with respect to weekend labor. When will the new 
measures come into force? 
  [Giraud] This is not a measure that is part of the act, but 
of one that dates back to 1982. On this subject, I am prepared 
to allow enough time for sector-by-sector negotiations. As for 
the act, I said that the regulations would be ready on 31 March, 
and they are; however, the government has decided to wait before 
introducing them so that consultation and explanation may 
continue. 
  [Desportes] You said that you did not want to be the 
"minister of 4 million jobless people": Do you still stick to 
this statement? 
  [Giraud] Indeed. But one must understand that the five-year 
act is based on an overall approach. I therefore do not intend 
to single out one particular measure. I did say that I hoped 
that 400,000 jobs would be created in the course of one year 
from the moment the act was completely implemented. This 
estimate must be viewed in relation with the level of economic 
activity. I would also like to say that tangible results can 
already be seen right now. Apprenticeship and mixed teaching 
and training formulas are booming; part-time work and gradual 
preretirement schemes have preserved a number of jobs. Compared 
with last year, the unemployment rate has slowed down 
considerably. I believe that the increase in unemployment is 
about to come to a standstill.

<F P=106> [Interview with Egon Klepsch, president of the European </F>
Parliament, by Hartmut Hausmann; place and date not given: "The 
Balance Is Positive"] 
  [Text] [Hausmann] Mr. President, what balance can you 
draw for the third electoral term of the directly elected 
Parliament? 
  [Klepsch] I am convinced that the European Parliament [EP] 
has gained significantly in importance and influence since the 
last direct election of June 1989. This is an essential 
understanding that I have gained during my official visits to 
the 12 European Union members states, the EFTA [European Free 
Trade Association] countries, and outside Europe. In many 
countries outside the EU, the European Parliament is regarded as 
a model and symbol for democratic parliamentary activities, as a 
guarantor for democratic control and the protection of human 
rights. The long, untiring efforts by the European Parliament 
for stronger, extended powers is reflected in the Maastricht 
Treaty. The important thing now is for the European Parliament 
to do justice to its new role and contribute to the solution of 
pending problems in cooperation with the other EU institutions. 
I hope that the citizens of the EU now understand that this 
Parliament supports their causes and interests. The voters 
should make themselves aware that disenchantment with politics 
or with Europe will not get us anywhere. On the contrary, the 
fourth direct election to the European Parliament in mid-June 
will offer an opportunity for everybody to co-determine the 
course of the further process of European integration. 
  [Hausmann] What were for you personally the highlights of 
your presidency in the past two and one-half years? 
  [Klepsch] Two essential events for the entire history of the 
European Community, the signing of the Maastricht Treaty on 7 
February 1992 and its implementation on 1 November 1991 [date as 
published], took place during my presidency. In September 1992, 
the European Parliament itself could celebrate its 40th 
anniversary. In six summit meetings -- another one will follow 
in late June -- I was able to contribute to the future shaping 
of the EU together with the heads of state and government of the 
12 EU countries. In a number of meetings and talks with leading 
politicians from Europe and other continents I was able to 
experience that the EU can and must assume a leading role in 
international politics. 
  [Hausmann] The Maastricht Treaty offers the European 
Parliament the basis to strengthen and considerably extend its 
powers of democratic control. As important examples I would 
like to mention the European Parliament's right of consent to 
the nomination of the president of the Commission and the entire 
European Commission, which currently consists of 17 members. So 
far, the Parliament only had the possibility to remove the 
entire Commission via a vote of no-confidence. The Maastricht 
Treaty also adjusts the terms of the Commission to the 
legislative term of the Parliament, which means it will be 
extended from four to five years. That is also of relevance for 
the political work. 
  Maastricht also authorizes the European Parliament to ratify 
all EC agreements with third countries that focus on political, 
economic, of financial issues. So far, the European Parliament 
has had the right to consent to agreements on associate 
membership and full membership to the EU -- which is what some 
people have not been aware of. The position of the European 
Parliament as a democratic control body will be strengthened in 
the future also by establishing the post of ombudsman, who will 
be elected by the Parliament and is accountable only to 
Parliament. The creation of investigating committees is an 
additional example regarding the extension of democratic powers 
of control. The European Parliament will thus be enabled to 
comprehensively control the bureaucracies of the Commission and 
the Council of Ministers -- which is where the representatives 
of the individual governments make their decisions. 
  Finally, the Maastricht Treaty concedes to the European 
Parliament the right of co-decision, that is to say co-decision 
on an equal footing with the Council of Ministers for the 
latter's decision with a qualified majority. This power of 
consent -- with the absolute majority of 260 deputies -- 
remains, however, for the time being limited to decrees and 
guidelines related to the single market, which was implemented 
at the beginning of last year, and to some framework laws, such 
as the Fourth Research Framework Program, which was just 
discussed by Parliament in the second reading. The European 
Parliament has called for the extension of the right to 
co-decision to all legislative activities in which the Council 
adopts majority resolutions. This extension may be implemented 
at the revision conference, planned for 1996; yet it can also be 
done without an amendment of the treaty through the evolutive 
clause [Evolutivklausel], which is contained in the Maastricht 
Treaty. With the regulations of the Maastricht Treaty, the 
catalogue of demands of the European Parliament is still far 
from being fulfilled. 
  The essential objectives are and remain: 

  -  Full right of 
co-decision in all activities of the Community, that is to say 
in the entire law-making process; 
  -  The full budget right -- to be 
able not only to decide on spending but also on revenues; 
  -  The 
right of consent in the case of amendments to the treaty. 
  "Interinstitutional agreements" have been concluded, that 
is to say agreements between the Council of Ministers, the 
Commission, and the European Parliament, for the important areas 
of the annual EC budget and the medium-term financial planning 
up to the end of the decade, and for everything that was 
discussed and negotiated under the headlines of "more democracy, 
full transparency, and subsidiarity principle." This has 
significantly strengthened the importance of our Parliament. 
  Still pending are the necessary agreements on setting up 
investigating committees and the shaping of the necessary 
consultative procedures between the Council and Parliament in 
the spheres of common foreign and security policy, economic and 
monetary policy, and measures in the domestic and judicial 
areas, the three pillars of the Maastricht Treaty. 
  [Hausmann] Apart from the increase in power for the 
legislative procedures itself, Parliament can now exert an 
indirect influence on the creation of draft laws, because the 
Commission has become dependent on Parliament. Is this not a 
shift of power in the institutional balance to the disadvantage 
of the Commission? 
  [Klepsch] I regard that as a justified enlargement of powers 
in favor of the European Parliament and not as something to the 
disadvantage of the European Commission. It is a procedure to 
restore a new balance between EU institutions. 
  [Hausmann] The greater legislative powers in some 
traditional spheres of European policy now contrast with 
stripping the Parliament of powers in new spheres of 
responsibility of the EU. Foreign and security policy, as well 
as domestic and legal policy were placed outside Community 
procedures. Why does the Parliament put up with this disrespect 
for the elected deputies? 
  [Klepsch] The European Parliament is certainly not ready to 
put up with such disrespect. On the basis of the Martin Report, 
we criticized the deficiencies and shortcomings of this treaty 
in the first resolutions to the Maastricht Treaty in April 1992. 
This includes the planned procedure in domestic and legal 
policy and in foreign and security policy. The European 
Parliament has called for full integration of treaty pillars 
number two and three into the EU sphere of powers and the 
appropriate cooperation of the Parliament. We will not put up 
with the fact that the right to co-decision is limited only to 
the single market and some framework sectors. On the contrary, 
we are calling for an extension of the right to co-decision to 
all legislative activities. 
  [Hausmann] Some French politicians reject further powers for 
the European Parliament arguing that even today it has more 
rights than the French National Assembly. Denmark has also 
assumed a negative position in this issue. How much room do you 
still have for more democracy? 
  [Klepsch] The European Parliament will not abandon its 
course because of criticism and opposition from national 
parliaments to make the activities and decisions of the EU all 
in all more transparent and easier to understand, and to 
increase the level of democracy. In doing so, we do not act 
against the interests of the national parliaments, but we are 
seeking close cooperation with them. At the level of national 
parliaments, too, the understanding should begin to prevail that 
more democracy will ultimately be beneficial to everybody. The 
implementation of the Maastricht Treaty stipulations will 
certainly help to make EU more democratic to the benefit of all 
citizens. 
  [Hausmann] In 1996, a new government conference is to work 
out an internal, institutional reform of the Union. Even now, a 
working group consisting of members of the Council, Commission, 
and Parliament should work out proposals. Why before the 
election, and what are the Parliament's minimum demands? 
  [Klepsch] We very much welcome the idea of a working group 
begining its activities at this early stage. I myself 
repeatedly emphasized the necessity of tackling a comprehensive 
institutional reform even before the government conference, 
scheduled for 1996, and best with the participation of the 
current membership candidates. The European Parliament's basic 
demand has always aimed at making an enlarged EU able to act and 
work. This requires reform at all levels of EU institutions. 
This affects especially the mechanism of decisionmaking in the 
Council of Ministers. For the European Parliament the necessary 
resolutions or provisions have already been made with the 
Edinburgh decisions on increasing the number of deputies from 
518 to 567, and the Brussels summit decision of December 1993 on 
the number of deputies for the membership candidates. 
  [Hausmann] In the view of the European Parliament, the EU 
should develop into a federal state in the long run. Yet, the 
German Constitutional Court thinks that this is incompatible 
with the current Basic Law. Will the Parliament now revise its 
objective? 
  [Klepsch] As president of the European Parliament I welcomed 
the ruling of the German Constitutional Court of October 1993 
and described it as being "largely consistent with the ideas of 
the European Parliament." I think that the question whether the 
EU should develop into a federal state, a confederation, or a 
union of states, which is how the Federal Constitutional Court 
has defined the current state of integration, is not of primary 
importance at this moment. In my view, the most important thing 
is now the practical implementation of all regulations of the 
Maastricht Treaty on shaping the EU. The European Parliament 
will stick to its plan of drafting a "EU Constitution." Work on 
it will continue rapidly. 
  [Hausmann] Despite the summit decision of 1992, according to 
which Strasbourg is the seat of the European Parliament and 12 
weeks of plenary sessions should be held there, only 11 sessions 
took place under your presidency in 1993, with only 11 being 
planned for this year, too. Why is the decision of the heads of 
state and government not respected, and why are plenary sessions 
held in Brussels instead? 
  [Klepsch] One cannot say that the resolution of the heads of 
state and government of the December 1992 Edinburgh summit is 
not respected. The only reason the second regular plenary 
session on the Community budget in 1993, normally scheduled for 
the end of October, was canceled was that the budget 
consultations had made good progress and could be concluded 
without a second plenary session in October. This year, the 
June plenary session in Strasbourg has to be canceled because of 
the European election. Besides, the European Council summit in 
Edinburgh also ruled that "additional plenary sessions are to be 
held in Brussels."

  [Text] Strasbourg, France April 14 (A.A.) -- The 
Parliamentary Assembly of the Council of Europe (COE) on 
Wednesday [13 April] called for the retraction of accusations 
against six Turkish parliamentarians from the Democracy (DEP) 
Party, which led to the lifting of their immunity and their 
detention. 
  The Assembly said any investigation against the deputies 
should be pursued "without keeping them in detention." 
  The report was prepared by Dutch MP Eric Jurgens. 
  Esat Kiratlioglu, member of the Parliamentarian Assembly's 
Turkish group said at the COE meeting that Turkey's problem was 
not with Kurds but with the separatist terrorist organization. 
  He also accused the COE's motion author of not asking for 
the 
opinion of Turkish MP's during his recent contacts there, 
stressing the fact that there are 120 MP's there [not further 
specified] and some ministers in the Turkish Cabinet are of 
Kurdish origin. 
  British Member of Parliament Brian Smith gave examples from 
his country and said that the MP who would defend the IRA could 
in the same way lose his seat at Parliament. 
  Norwegian MP Johann Berg for his part said European 
parliamentarians are using every platform to attack Turkey and 
there are many important errors in Jurgens' report. 
  Swiss parliamentarian Petra Fluckiger called attention to 
the 
activities of the terrorist organization in Turkey, stressing 
the COE should make a very thorough analysis when evaluating the 
situation. 
  The Turkish parliamentarian group at the COE published a 
communique in which they strongly criticized and condemned the 
report, underlining the fact that this decision is of a quality 
that will encourage terrorism.

Difficulties Encountered by Middle East Peace Process"] 
  [Text] Brussels, 13 Apr (BELGA) -- Belgian Foreign Minister 
Willy Claes spoke with PLO Chairman Yasir 'Arafat in Strasbourg 
on Wednesday, 13 April, of the difficulties encountered in the 
Middle East peace process, according to a communique from the 
Belgian Foreign Ministry. 
  Mr. Claes stressed "the need to convince all parties to 
achieve rapid progress in this process," the communique stressed. 
  The Belgian minister also reminded 'Arafat that he fully 
supports the idea of European Union (EU) funding for the 
Palestinian police force, a matter on which the EU ministers 
must soon decide. He also stressed the importance of a prompt 
and concrete implementation of projects benefitting the 
Palestinian population in the occupied territories which the EU 
has already agreed to finance, the communique added.

<F P=106> [Unattributed article: "GATT: Baratta on Italian Prospects </F>
After Uruguay Round"] 
  [Text] (ANSA) Marrakech, Morocco, April 13 -- With the 
signing of the revised General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade 
(GATT) Thursday [14 April], Italy will have improved chances of 
penetrating new markets abroad, granting Italian producers and 
consumers increased benefits, according to Italian Foreign Trade 
Minister Paolo Baratta. 
  Baratta is here to attend Thursday's official ceremony in 
which the 117 nations involved in the seven-year-long Uruguay 
Round of GATT talks will sign the accords reached in December. 
  He compared the Uruguay Round to the Bretton Woods accords 
of 
1944, which led to the establishment of the International 
Monetary Fund and the International Bank for Reconstruction and 
Development. The Uruguay Round accord allegedly makes a 
significant step toward the creation of a World Trade 
Organization, which was one of the original goals of GATT when 
it was founded in 1948. 
  Italy, Baratta said, was in danger of falling behind 
competitors on the global markets because its technological 
strength is limited to the textiles industry. The new accords, 
however, will force rich countries to reduce trade barriers and 
will favor development of poor countries, allowing more room for 
Italian exports to both, according to Baratta. 
  The greatest weakness of Italian businesses, Baratta said, 
is 
that they do not have sufficient capital to plan "aggressive" 
investments abroad, investments which Baratta said may not yield 
returns in the short term but allow companies to plant a foot 
solidly inside future markets. Italian companies are mostly 
small- and medium-sized ones, they are flexible and good at 
marketing, but they can only "follow" market trends rather than 
setting them, Baratta added.

<F P=106> [Article signed MAR: "Rwandan Crisis: Belgian Prime </F>
Minister Dehaene Categorically Denies Rwandan Accusations"] 
  [Text] Brussels, 12 Apr (BELGA) -- Belgian Prime Minister 
Jean-Luc Dehaene on Tuesday evening [12 April] categorically 
denied on RTBF [French-language Belgian Radio and Television] 
news the accusations leveled by the Rwandan Foreign and 
Cooperation Ministry, which questioned the actions of the UN 
troops guarding Kigali airport at the time the plane carrying 
Rwandan President Juvenal Habyarimana was destroyed. 
  In a memo dated 11 April and addressed to the UN mission in 
Rwanda (UNAMIR), the Rwandan Ministry questioned the 
"inexplicable failures on the part of the UN troops charged with 
the security of Gregoire Kayibanda airport and its environs, 
failures that made it possible for the criminals to shoot down 
the presidential aircraft." 
  Another part of the memo criticized the "active 
participation 
of certain UNAMIR elements in Rwandan Patriotic Front operations 
against the Rwandan Army." 
  In reply, Mr. Dehaene said: "These accusations are 
completely unfounded. The Belgian UN troops did their job and 
did it correctly." 
  In his reply, Mr. Dehaene also wondered about the 
representativeness of the current, self-proclaimed "government" 
of Rwanda. 
  The prime minister pointed out that the circumstances 
surrounding the death of President Habyarimana would only become 
clear if an investigation were launched by the international 
community. 
  However, without wanting to prejudice the results of the 
inquiry, Mr. Dehaene said: "It does, however, now seem likely 
that the attack came from inside Rwanda."

<F P=106> [James Blitz report: "Major Backs `Exceptional' Commons </F>
Lies"] 
  [Text] The prime minister has for the first time publicly 
backed a recent claim by Mr William Waldegrave, the minister 
responsible for open government, that ministers can lie to the 
Commons in exceptional circumstances. 
  In a letter to Mr Giles Radice, the Labour MP for Durham 
North, Mr John Major says: "It is clearly of paramount 
importance that ministers give accurate and truthful information 
to the House." 
  But the prime minister's letter goes on to say: "If they 
knowingly fail to do this, then they should relinquish their 
positions except in the quite exceptional circumstances of which 
a devaluation or time of war or other danger to national 
security have been quoted as examples." 
  The prime minister responded to Mr Radice after he had 
written asking whether it was the duty of ministers not to 
mislead parliament and to resign if they do so. 
  The first exchange of letters followed a statement made by 
Mr 
Waldegrave to the Treasury and civil service select committee, 
of which Mr Radice is a member, that ministers had to lie to the 
Commons in exceptional circumstances. 
  In particular, Mr Waldegrave claimed that Lord Callaghan, 
the 
former Labour prime minister, had told untruths during the 
devaluation crisis of 1967. 
  This has been fiercely denied by Lord Callaghan, who was 
chancellor at the time. He claims that he chose his words on 
the issue very carefully, and that he has never lied to the 
Commons. 
  Until now, the prime minister has given only a guarded 
endorsement of Mr Waldegrave's comments. 
  On a BBC programme in March, Mr Major said: "Mr Waldegrave 
answered an intelligent question frankly about what had happened 
under another government a quarter of a century ago." 
  Asked whether lying could be justified in parliament, he 
said: "Nobody can and nobody does."

<F P=106> [Report on interview with Roy MacLaren, Canadian </F>
international trade minister, by NIHON KEIZAI SHIMBUN reporter: 
place and date not given] 
  [Text] In an interview with a NIHON KEIZAI SHIMBUN 
reporter on the eve of the ministerial talks to be held soon [in 
Morocco] to sign an accord hammered out at the Uruguay Round, 
Roy MacLaren, Canadian international trade minister, made clear 
his view on the next international trade rule. Commenting on 
the establishment of a new labor standard that the United States 
and other nations have demanded, the Canadian minister in charge 
of international trade took the position that it is necessary to 
cautiously negotiate its establishment, saying: "Developing 
countries are concerned that the establishment of such a new 
labor standard could result in control of their exports to 
industrialized nations." 
  The United States and France have insisted that a new 
standard for international trade be established to protect the 
rights of workers in developing countries where wages and labor 
conditions are problematic. Developing countries have guarded 
against their insistence as an attempt to deprive them of the 
upper-hand in trade shored up by low wages that are a source of 
their competitiveness. 
  In the interview, Minister MacLaren went on to say: "There 
is not enough time left to reach an agreement on the 
establishment of the labor standard and conclude an accord on it 
at the Uruguay Round. Developing countries are concerned that 
the establishment of such a new labor standard and any social 
standard could result in regulations on their exports to 
industrialized nations. Canada is cautious about establishing 
such a standard." In this way, the Canadian minister indicated 
that all the industrialized nations are not in agreement on the 
labor standard's establishment. 
  In the interview, Minister MacLaren criticized the United 
States for reviving the Super 301 Provision, saying: "We are 
concerned about all one-sided trade measures taken by the United 
States."

  [Text] [No dateline as received] -- During a talk with 
Chancellor Helmut Kohl on Wednesday afternoon [13 April], UN 
Secretary General Butrus-Ghali confirmed, upon Kohl's inquiry, 
the intention to transfer the UN Volunteers' Program (UNV) to 
Bonn. This was announced by Government Spokesman Dieter Vogel. 
The small program headquarters with a staff of 100 people, 
which employs, however, 2,000 helpers all over the world, is 
currently located in Geneva. 
  According to Vogel, Kohl and Butrus-Ghali stated that the 
NATO attacks in Bosnia against Serbian positions are necessary 
and stated that the peace process "must be energetically pushed 
ahead with the inclusion of the United States and the Russian 
Federation." Just like FRG Foreign Minister Klaus Kinkel, at a 
prior press conference Butrus-Ghali had rejected as 
"unjustified" Russian complaints that Russia had not been 
informed about the attacks and pointed to UN Resolution 836, 
which authorizes such attacks and was also signed by Moscow. 
  Kohl once again stressed Germany's readiness "to take over 
responsibility in the United Nations in the future also as a 
permanent member of the Security Council." In addition, he 
hopes for further transfers of UN organizations to Bonn, Kohl 
said. Subsequently Butrus-Ghali visited Development Minister 
Carl-Dieter Spranger (Christian Social Union).

  [Text] Bonn (DPA) -- On Wednesday [13 April] in Bonn, UN 
Secretary General Butrus-Ghali basically came out in favor of 
greater German participation in the international organization. 
On Wednesday, the secretary general also discussed German 
representation in the United Nations and, above all, the 
transfer of UN offices to Bonn with Chancellor Helmut Kohl. 
During his talks in Bonn it was clearly stated that Germany 
wants more transfers of UN offices. 
  At a joint press conference with FRG foreign Minister Klaus 
Kinkel, Butrus-Ghali limited his support for Germany's 
application for a new seat on the Security Council by pointing 
to the UN Charter, which says that he is not responsible for 
that. He indicated a longer waiting period by referring to the 
necessary discussions among the 184 UN members. In contrast, he 
declared his readiness to again suggest a German for the 
high-ranking post of UN undersecretary general, after UN legal 
adviser "Undersecretary General" Carl Fleischhauer was appointed 
a judge at the International Court of Justice in The Hague in 
1993. 
  Kinkel stressed the FRG's claim to greater participation by 
pointing to its status as the third-largest payer of 
contributions. He thanked Butrus-Ghali for the promise to try to 
evacuate the surrounded 11 German employees of Deutsche Welle in 
the Rwandan capital of Kigali as soon as possible by means of UN 
helicopters. 
  As during his previous two visits to Bonn, Butrus-Ghali 
stressed that he understands Germany's constitutional problems, 
which have so far prevented the participation of armed German 
blue helmets in peacemaking missions. He will welcome any 
German contribution, Butrus-Ghali said. 
  Regarding the situation in Bosnia and, above all, around 
Gorazde, the UN secretary general expressed optimism that 
solutions like the one in Sarajevo will get the upper hand in 
continued negotiations. Butrus-Ghali did not refer to the 
Serbian threats, which have also been directed against UN 
personnel. He hopes for appropriate participation by Russia. 
  Kinkel once again defended the quick decision for NATO air 
raids against Serbian positions, which did not permit informing 
Moscow immediately. In addition, Russia did, after all, also 
sign the UN resolution. After his visit to Bonn, Butrus-Ghali 
was expected to go to the Spanish capital of Madrid.

  [Text] Bonn (DPA) -- At the beginning of his two-day visit 
to Germany, Polish Prime Minister Waldemar Pawlak met Helmut 
Kohl on Thursday [14 April]. In their talks, Kohl and his guest 
will mainly discuss the extension of economic relations and 
Poland's desire for early European Union membership. Poland's 
wish to get closer to NATO will also be discussed. 
  During his first official visit to Germany, Pawlak will also 
meet representatives of the Federation of German Chambers of 
Industry and Commerce, Bundestag President Rita Suessmuth, and 
Hans-Ulrich Klose, chairman of the Social Democratic Party of 
Germany Bundestag group. Pawlak will hold more economic talks 
in Stuttgart, where he is scheduled to arrive tomorrow.

  [Text] Bonn (DPA) -- [no dateline as received] In 
addition to the expansion of bilateral relations with Poland, 
Germany wants to advocate with all its strength this country's 
accession to the European Union [EU]. "Europe without Poland 
would be a rump," Chancellor Helmut Kohl stated in Bonn on 
Thursday [14 April] after a talk with Polish head of government, 
Waldemar Pawlak. A united Europe without Poland is unthinkable, 
Kohl said. 
  In addition to economic relations, Pawlak's first visit to 
Germany as Polish prime minister focused on European integration 
and Poland's accession to the EU, which is desired by both 
countries. Pawlak stressed his government's interest in reducing 
artificial barriers for Polish export products with in the EU. 
Poland's negative trade balance with Germany must be balanced 
in the future, Pawlak said. 
  After his talk with the 34-year-old head of government, Kohl 
spoke to journalists in the chancellor's office and stressed 
that the quality of relations between Germany and Poland is also 
vitally important for Europe. Regardless of the generation gap 
between him and his guest, both of them know how important it is 
to learn from history and to turn bad experiences into good 
policy, Kohl said. The chancellor envisages the goal of shaping 
goodneighborly relations with Poland along the lines of 
German-French relations. Perhaps it is a new image of Germany 
for Poland that the FRG in particular supports Poland's desire 
for EU membership so emphatically. Pawlak and Kohl want to take 
specific measures soon to reduce the long waiting times at the 
German-Polish border crossings to a tolerable level. 
  Kohl wants to use Germany's presidency of the EU Council 
during the second half of this year to present proposals to the 
partners in the EU about how Poland's path toward final 
membership can be paved. Kohl paid tribute to the Polish reform 
policy and expressly welcomed that the country has joined the 
NATO partnership treaty. 
  As has been heard from Polish delegation circles, economic 
relations in particular between the two states should be given 
more substance. German investors are still too hesitant. Given 
an overall volume of foreign investment in Poland at $3 billion, 
German investment is only 400 million German marks, it was said. 
Pawlak will conclude his two-day visit to Germany in Stuttgart 
on Friday.

  [Text] Bonn -- Foreign Minister Klaus Kinkel has 
criticized the violation of human rights and the treatment of 
the Kurdish population in Turkey. The situation is not 
satisfactory and has deteriorated recently, Kinkel stated during 
the government statement at the German Bundestag today. 
  The chairman of the Free Democratic Party of Germany 
mentioned the arrest of Kurdish members of the parliament in 
Ankara last month. Thus, the Turkish leadership created the 
impression that it wants to silence the voices of Kurdish 
citizens in Turkey. During his talks with his Turkish 
counterpart Hikmet Cetin, he frequently discusses the situation 
of the Christians, torture during police custody, and the 
restriction of the freedom of press and opinion in Turkey, 
Kinkel stressed. 
  He admonished Turkey to wage the struggle against the 
terrorist Workers Party of Kurdistan (PKK) on the bases of the 
existing laws and of international rules. The Federal 
Government believes that the Kurdish issue can only be settled 
with peaceful means and in mutual agreement between the Turkish 
government and the Kurds. Any solution must take into 
consideration the cultural identity of the Kurds. 
  Kinkel also referred to the accusation that weapons supplied 
by Germany are used against the Kurdish civilian population. He 
emphasized that Bonn has suspended further deliveries until the 
issue is clarified. Recent allegations by human rights groups 
that were handed over to the Foreign Ministry yesterday with 
alleged proof are being examined carefully. So long as no 
conclusive evidence is furnished, there is no reason to doubt 
Ankara's assertions. 
  Kinkel appealed to the Kurds living in Germany to stop 
waging 
their conflicts with Turkey in a violent manner. "Those who 
misuse Germany's hospitality and commit crimes must reckon with 
the full severity of our laws, with legal proceedings, and with 
deportation. It will naturally be examined in every individual 
case whether those affected are facing the death penalty or 
torture." 
  Kinkel mentioned the long-standing and exemplary friendship 
between Germany and Turkey. The Federal Government is 
determined to cultivate this asset even in difficult times.

  [Text] Bonn (DPA) -- On Wednesday evening [13 April], 
Foreign Minister Klaus Kinkel received the leader of the Iraqi 
Kurds, Jalal Talabani, for talks during which the situation of 
the Kurds in this Arab country and their struggle for autonomy 
were focused on. Talabani, who is the secretary general of the 
"Patriotic Union of Kurdistan" (PUK), which is opposed by 
Baghdad, is currently trying to get more support by traveling 
through severla countries. Since the Gulf War in 1991 Germany 
has provided the Kurds in Iraq mainly with humanitarian aid, 
worth 400 million German marks. 
  German state bodies and private organizations are operating 
a 
common coordination office for German aid in the town of Irbil. 
Recently, German journalist Lissy Schmidt was killed in this 
region; media have cited the Iraqi Government as the one that 
"ordered" the killing. On Tuesday, Talabani confirmed in Bonn 
that his PUK has apprehended two of the suspected killers.

  [Text] Bonn (DPA) -- On Thursday [14 April] in Bonn, Iraqi 
Kurd leader Jalal Talabani came out in favor of preserving the 
unity of Iraq but rejected any coexistence of his people with 
Saddam Husayn's dictatorship in Baghdad. "We will never again 
return beneath the yoke of Saddam's brutal dictatorship," the 
secretary general of the "Patriotic Union of Kurdistan" said at 
a Kurdish-German event. 
  Talabani stressed that the Kurdish federal state in northern 
Iraq, which was proclaimed in 1992, can and will survive. "We 
are well organized and we are willing to pay the price for it," 
he stated. The next goal is the liberation of those oil-rich 
parts of Kurdistan that are still occupied by the Iraqi military 
at the moment. He complained that the Kurds in this region are 
not only persecuted by Baghdad but also suffer under the 
sanctions imposed by the United Nations. 
  He affirmed Kurdish solidarity with the other Iraqi 
opposition groups in the struggle against the regime in Baghdad. 
Accusations of separatism are completely unfounded, he said. 
The Kurds want the establishment of a democratic Iraq with a 
federal system as the best guarantee to preserve their cultural 
identity. Talabani, who also met with Foreign Minister Klaus 
Kinkel in Bonn, criticized Western politicians, who see Saddam's 
regime as the guarantor of Iraq's unity. In reality, the 
dictatorship is the greatest enemy of unity, because it divides 
the nation, Talabani stressed.

  [Text] Cologne (DPA) -- According to a former GDR officer, 
the Turkish military is using German tanks against Kurds. They 
come from the stocks of the former National People's Army [NVA] 
but, before their delivery to Turkey, they were technically 
reequipped for the Bundeswehr, the former NVA colonel confirmed 
to the ARD magazine program "Monitor." As Westdeutscher 
Rundfunk [WDR] announced in Cologne on Thursday [14 April], tank 
expert Lothar Mann used film material from "Monitor" to identify 
tanks recently used against Kurds as military equipment from 
former GDR stocks. "These tanks -- they are BTR 60 PB armored 
personnel carriers -- clearly come from the stocks of the former 
NVA." 
  According to the WDR, the military expert noted that the 
tanks could have been delivered to Turkey only after having been 
reequipped for the Bundeswehr. "Proof of that are the changes 
that have been made on the vehicles, which were made in 
connection with the transition to the licensing regulation under 
the FRG traffic code -- such as rearview mirrors." Thus, it is 
quite clear for Mann that these vehicles are not deliveries from 
the former Soviet Union or from Russia but German tanks. 
  The WDR pointed out that, even in the last few days, Turkey 
had claimed the tanks used against Kurds came from Russia. FRG 
Foreign Minister Klaus Kinkel (FDP) on Wednesday said in the 
Bundestag that it has not yet been proven Turkey has used German 
weapons in the country against Kurds in violation of the treaty. 
  In contrast, on Thursday the "Kurdistan Information Office" 
in Cologne announced that the delivery of German weapons of all 
kinds to Turkey, "with which Kurds are massacred," has indeed 
been proved. Concerning the discussion about the deportation of 
Kurds to Turkey, the Information Office said that politically 
active deported Kurds are threatened in Turkey with torture and 
treatment that violates human rights. It would be pointless to 
conclude a deportation agreement with Turkey. Turkey has also 
signed the European Convention of Human Rights, the Antitorture 
Convention, and the Geneva Refugee Convention without ever 
adhering to these agreements.

  [Text] Washington -- Social Democratic Party of Germany 
[SPD] Chairman Rudolf Scharping has presented a very positive 
review of his talks in Washington. "This is an important and 
successful visit," the SPD candidate for chancellor and minister 
president of Rhineland-Palatinate told journalists on Wednesday 
[13 April]. He met with "a lot of friendliness and attention" 
not only during his meeting with U.S. President Bill Clinton, 
but also in all the talks with leading government and Congress 
politicians. Former occasional distrust of positions held by 
the German Social Democrats has been replaced by an atmosphere 
of partnership and trust. 
  To conclude his talks in the capital, Scharping wants to 
meet 
with Defense Secretary William Perry and Chief of Staff John 
Shalikashvili on Wednesday. Problems in connection with German 
participation in UN missions is thought to be one of the focal 
issues to be discussed with them. 
  Scharping said that during the talks he has had so far he 
got 
the impression that the question of Bundeswehr participation in 
UN combat missions that is so controversial in Germany is of no 
special urgency to the Americans. Following their experience in 
Somalia, they are hardly thinking of putting combat forces under 
UN command themselves at the moment. It is wrong to create the 
impression that the Americans are pressuring the Germans in this 
matter, the SPD chairman said, hinting at the coalition parties 
in Bonn. Presenting such a view of the matter is not conducive 
to German-U.S. relations. 
  Scharping is going on to New York on Thursday, where he will 
meet, among others, with General Motors chief Jack Smith, former 
secretary of state Henry Kissinger, and representatives of 
Jewish organizations in the United States.

  [Text] Bonn -- Speaking in Bonn on Wednesday [13 April], 
Shaykh Hamad Bin-Jassim Bin-Jabbur al Thani, foreign minister of 
Qatar, criticized the dragging negotiations between the European 
Union [EU] and the Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC), the community 
of six Gulf states. "I am not happy nor content with what has 
been achieved so far," Shaykh Hamad told correspondents at the 
end of his three-day talks with the Federal Government. "We 
have been talking about cooperation for six or seven years, but 
so far there have been no concrete results in the form of 
agreements or regulations." 
  The Arabic politician mainly accused the European Union of 
making imports of petrochemical products from Gulf countries 
difficult with its customs policy. On the other hand, the GCC 
members (Saudi Arabia, Kuwait, United Arab Emirates, Qatar, 
Oman, Bahrain) are partly to blame for the stagnation because 
they still have not agreed on uniform customs regulations. He 
was content with Foreign Minister Klaus Kinkel informing him 
that the European Union does not intend to introduce a new 
energy tax. "This helps keep petroleum prices stable beyond the 
year 2000," he said. 
  During his three-day visit, Shaykh Hamad also met Chancellor 
Helmut Kohl, his German counterpart Kinkel, and Hans Stercken, 
the chairman of the Bundestag's Foreign Affairs Committee. He 
said that the two countries are planning to conclude agreements 
on investment promotion and the avoidance of double taxation. 
Speaking to correspondents, the foreign minister especially 
acknowledged German support of the Muslims in Bosnia and the 
express support of the Middle East peace process.

  [Text] Bonn -- According to Foreign Minister Klaus Kinkel, 
Germany has to help secure world peace within the United Nations 
without restrictions. At the annual meeting of the German 
Society for Military Technology in Bonn, Kinkel said on 
Wednesday [13 April] that in spite of all weaknesses, the United 
Nations is the only global instrument of collective security. 
It has the possibility to legitimize the use of force under 
international law. The difficulties met by the United Nations, 
for instance in Somalia, must not discourage the community. 
  The increasing responsibility that Germany faces requires an 
appropriate German say as permanent member of the U.N. Security 
Council, Kinkel pointed out. It is important that the resources 
of the Atlantic Alliance can also be used in overcoming 
international crises, if other possibilities fail. The Alliance 
is now adapting the structure of its forces to these new tasks. 
  Klaus Naumann, the Bundeswehr Inspector General, made a 
statement along the same line. NATO has confirmed its 
willingness to help with United Nations or CSCE peacekeeping 
operations. Parts of the military forces and installations of 
NATO, and this includes the Bundeswehr, must be made available 
for quick operations to prevent, curb, and to end conflicts. 
The crisis reaction forces set up by the Bundeswehr must be 
available quickly and be in a position "to be used also if the 
outcome is uncertain." 
  Naumann described the overall development of the Bundeswehr 
in a favorable light. It is not right that the armed forces are 
not trained properly these days, he said. "There are dark 
sides, no doubt, but there is also a lot of light," the general 
said. The soldiers' devotion and willingness to work hard 
"have increased impressively, and there is a willingness to take 
risks and to do without amenities -- something that is quite 
rare in our country," Naumann said.

  [Text] Washington (DPA) -- Social Democratic Party of 
Germany [SPD] Chairman Rudolf Scharping has warned the Bonn 
coalition parties, the Christian Democratic Union 
[CDU]/Christian Social Union [CSU] and the Free Democratic Party 
of Germany [FDP], not to drag foreign policy into the election 
campaign. Such attempts to distract from the Federal 
Government's failure in the sphere of domestic policy will not 
be successful, Scharping told journalists on Wednesday night [13 
April] in Washington, where he is currently holding talks with 
U.S. politicians. 
  It is not in Germany's interest to "challenge" longstanding 
traditions in foreign policy "for crude calculations of party 
politics." The SPD's chancellor candidate said it was an 
"astonishing coincidence" that the coalition parties were using 
his absence to schedule two important foreign-policy debates in 
the Bundestag. "This is not necessarily proof of a great degree 
of self-assuredness," Scharping said. 
  At the end of his talks in Washington he rejected the 
impression that his assurance of continuity in German foreign 
policy if the SPD wins the Bundestag election would only mean 
the continuation of the policy of the current Federal Government. 
  It completely underestimated, for example, the importance of 
worldwide problems such as the North-South gap, the population 
explosion, or environmental problems for foreign policy. He 
concurred with his U.S. partners in the talks that these issues 
must be tackled more intensively and with more commitment, 
Scharping said. 
  On Friday, Scharping will travel to New York and meet, among 
others, Jack Smitz, the president of General Motors.

  [Text] Frankfurt/Main (DPA) -- At its session in Frankfurt 
on Thursday [14 April], the Central Bank Council of the German 
Bundesbank cut the prime rate by 0.25 percentage points. As of 
Friday, the discount rate will be reduced from 5.25 percent to 
5.0 percent, and the Lombard rate from 6.75 to 6.5 percent. 
  With its decision, the Central Bank Councils has "responded 
to the fact that the prospects for another decrease in the rate 
of price increases have improved." In addition, the Bundesbank 
assumes that the growth in the money supply will continue to 
slow down following the distortions at the turn of the year that 
were the result of special factors. 
  On Thursday, the Bundesbank also announced that in the 1993 
fiscal year, the Bundesbank achieved 18.83 billion German marks 
[DM] in net earnings, of which DM18.6 billion were transferred 
to the accounts of the Federal Government.

  [Text] Bonn (DPA) -- The Federal Government on Thursday 
[14 April] welcomed the reduction of the prime rate by the 
Bundesbank. The decision of the Central Bank Council to reduce 
the discount rate from 5.25 to 5 percent and the Lombard rate 
from 6.75 to 6.5 percent supports the Federal Government in its 
efforts for a further strengthening of the forces of growth, FRG 
Finance Minister Theo Waigel stated. 
  Economics Minister Guenter Rexrodt called on all people 
involved in economic circles to further orient their decisions 
toward the goal of stability. The inflation rate in both parts 
of Germany, which has been constantly declining since the 
beginning of 1993, as well as the Federal Government's 
consistent adherence to its policy of consolidation and the 
course of this years wage negotiations, so far have made the 
current reduction of interest rates easier. The interest rate 
reduction will support the forces of upswing in the economy.

  [Text] Bonn (DPA) -- All parties represented in the 
Bundestag most harshly condemned the arson attack on the 
synagogue in Luebeck three weeks ago and called it a disgrace 
for the FRG. Citizens are called upon to clearly oppose 
anti-Semitic and xenophobic phenomena in everyday life, speakers 
of all Bundestag groups stressed during a Question Hour in the 
Bundestag on Thursday [14 April]. The debate had been requested 
by the Party of Democratic Socialism [PDS]. 
  Bundestag President Rita Suessmuth, Christian Democratic 
Union [CDU], said that the attack during the night into 25 March 
-- the first arson attack on a synagogue since World War II -- 
was "aimed not only at the Jews but was also an attack against 
ourselves." She opposed "actionism," as well as the urgent call 
for new, stricter laws and demanded to demonstrate the 
commitment to tolerance and against violence in everyday life. 
  FRG Justice Minister Sabine Leutheusser-Schnarrenberger 
(Free 
Democratic Party of Germany) advocated making the "Auschwitz 
Lie" punishable in general; she said that the necessary 
amendment to the constitution must be discussed thoroughly. 
Criminal prosecution, which has been without a result in the 
Luebeck case despite great efforts, can, however, not be the 
only response: "We must make it clear that people like 
Schoenhuber have no place in an open and enlightened society," 
the minister said. 
  Anke Fuchs, deputy chairwoman of the Social Democratic Party 
of Germany Bundestag group, called for taking the "intellectual 
arsonists" in Germany to task. She accused the CDU/Christian 
Social Union of being partly responsible for the current 
development in Germany, because it made right-wing extremist 
slogans "acceptable" through "revealing language and cozying up 
to the right." Under strong applause by parliament, she praised 
Ignatz Bubis, chairman of the Central Council of Jews in 
Germany: He "acted in a particularly good and noble way in 
these days." 
  PDS Chairman Gregor Gysi complained abut a change in the 
intellectual climate in Germany, in which the inhibition 
threshold for right-wing extremist statements and acts of 
violence has been lowered. One must ask the question why in 
1994 actions are committed that would not have been dared in the 
past. Wolfgang Ullmann (Alliance 90/Greens) stated: "anyone 
who sets fire to synagogues and defiles Jewish tombstones, 
attacks the honor of this nation, tries to make its name stink 
again in the international community, and break this people out 
of the international community."

<F P=106> [Unattributed report on Foreign Minister Beniamino Andreatta </F>
remarks to journalists in Venice: "`Kidnapping Blue Helmets is 
Serious; Nothing To Criticize in Russia's Behavior'"] 
  [Text] (ANSA) Venice, 14 April -- "This action against the 
blue helmets, who are not part of the conflict, seems very 
serious to me: I hope there is a change of heart." 
  That comment was made by Italian Foreign Minister Beniamino 
Andreatta on being given the latest news from Bosnia concerning 
action against the blue helmets. Answering journalists' 
questions in Venice after the meeting of the CSCE troika, 
Andreatta said that the fact that "the Pale government has 
decided to break with the international organizations attempting 
to separate the sides and, more especially, to deliver food and 
supplies," is very serious. "Some 4 million Bosnians, Serbs, 
Muslims, and Croats have benefited from food and supplies 
throughout the winter," he added. 
  Andreatta went on to speak of Serbian threats against Italy, 
pointing out that "the government has been instructed to reject 
Belgrade's note protesting over the use of Italian bases by NATO 
aircraft." "It is a well-known fact," Andreatta added, "that 
making the bases available is part to our commitment to the 
Atlantic alliance, and that the UN resolutions provide for the 
use of force to defend UN troops deployed on the ground and in 
the so-called safe areas." 
  "There is nothing to criticize in the Russian Government's 
behavior" where Serbia is concerned, Andreatta said. "The 
Moscow government," he stressed, "has hitherto acted in the 
interests of peace, offering its services and putting pressure 
on the Serbian Government to adopt a more prudent conduct."

<F P=106> [Unattributed article: "Haggling Over Speaker, Caucuses on </F>
Eve of Inaugural Sitting of 12th Legislature"] 
  [Text] (ANSA) Rome, April 14 -- The search for agreement on 
a Senate speaker continued Thursday evening [14 April], as 
parliamentary caucuses formed in the run-up to tomorrow's first 
sitting of the 12th legislature. 
  After a meeting between senators from across the political 
spectrum failed to produce accord on an institutional figure to 
take the Senate speaker's chair this afternoon, People's Party 
and Left Democrat Party representatives were reported to be 
holding further talks this evening. 
  In the Lower House, where the right-wing Freedom Front has 
an 
absolute majority, Northern Leaguer Irene Pivetti has been 
tapped for the speaker's chair. In the Senate, where the Front 
is a few seats short of a majority, things are more complicated. 
The Northern League seemed determined to see Forza Italia's 
Carlo Scognamiglio placed in the Senate speaker's chair, despite 
the claims from Northern League chief Umberto Bossi earlier this 
afternoon that he did "not give a damn" about whether the 
economics professor made it or not. 
  "Let's not bandage our heads up before we get clobbered," 
said Francesco Speroni, himself originally considered likely to 
become the right-wing alliance's candidate for the top Senate 
job. 
  Roberto Maroni, the League's Lower House whip in the last 
legislature, commented "if Scognamiglio does not get elected 
then we will have to go back to the ballot box.... If 
Scognamiglio does not get elected, then (out-going Senate 
Speaker Giovanni) Spadolini will be, with the votes of the 
opposition which would mean that they had a majority. So 
President (Oscar Luigi) Scalfaro would have to give them a 
mandate." 
  Scalfaro will hand out a prime ministerial mandate after the 
houses have elected their speakers. 
  Meanwhile, parties are preparing for the opening of 
parliament by selecting whips and putting together caucuses. 
  The National Alliance, heir to the neo-fascist Italian 
Social 
Movement, named Giuseppe Tatarella as its Lower House whip 
today, while the Northern League handed out more minor posts but 
did not choose whips. Roberto Maroni is unlikely to return to 
his Lower House floor leader place, but Francesco Speroni may 
stay on as Senate whip, well-informed sources said. 
  The Christian Democrat Centre, the right-wing of the old 
Christian Democrat Party which split off when this renamed 
itself the People's Party, opted today to form its own 
parliamentary group, rather than merging with Forza Italia. The 
caucus will be closely linked to that of Forza Italia, alongside 
which it fought last month's elections under the Freedom Front 
banner. 
  Heading the Christian Democrat Centre's whips in the Lower 
House is likely to be Clemente Mastella. 
  On the left of the house, talks between the eight 
Progressive 
allies to form a single caucus ended with a decision to go ahead 
without the Socialists and Reformed Communists. The Progressive 
caucus will consist of 213 deputies and 122 senators, a 
communique released this evening said. 
  Well-informed sources said that Progressive members, the 
Greens and Network, were championing out-going Lower House 
Speaker Giorgio Napolitano as Lower House whip for the 
Progressives, but this has not been officially confirmed. 
  The Socialists, who decided today to keep up their own 
`visibility' in a separate parliamentary group, said they would 
be closely linked with the Progressive caucus. 
  When the Senate meets tomorrow at 1030 (0830 GMT) for its 
first session of the 12th legislature, 87-year-old life Senator 
Francsco de Martino will preside for the second time, in his 
capacity as older member of the house. 
  Voting for a new Senate speaker will take place in a secret 
ballot, with an absolute majority needed to win in the first two 
rounds of voting, to be held tomorrow, and an absolute majority 
of senators present needed to win in the third ballot. A run- 
off between the third ballot's two top candidates will decide 
the final winner if the vote goes to a fourth round. 
  A breakdown of Senate seats on the basis of results in the 
March 27-28 general elections is as follows:

  In the Lower House, which meets at 1000 (0800 GMT), the job 
of overseeing procedures will go to Alfredo Biondi, the oldest 
of the deputy speakers in the out-going legislature. 
  To win the speaker's seat in the first round of voting, a 
candidate needs 420 votes, or those of two-thirds of deputies. 
In the second and third rounds, a winner would need the support 
of two thirds of those voting. From the fourth vote on, an 
absolute majority is needed. 
  On the basis of last month's election results, the 
party-by-party breakdown should be as follows:

  The 12th legislature is younger, more female, and more 
erudite than the previous one, and contains over 400 new faces. 
The average age in the Lower House has gone down from 49.8 top 
46.3, while in the Senate the drop is from 54.9 to 52.4. 
  The female presence in the Lower House has risen from eight 
percent to 13.9 percent, but in the Senate it has remained more 
or less stable. 
  Only 30.9 percent of deputies and 40.4 percent of Senators 
have previous parliamentary experience, against an average of 44 
percent last time round. Forza Italia boasts 95 percent of new 
faces, followed by the Northern League with 44.4 percent of 
newcomers in the Lower House and 61 percent in the Senate. 
  University professors account for 25.8 percent of senators 
and 17.9 percent of deputies, while 13.3 percent of deputies and 
12.4 percent of Senates are lawyers or judges. Almost 76 percent 
of senators have a university degree, making the upper house 
more learned than the Lower, where 67.5 percent have degrees. 
  Law is the degree favoured by Italy's law-makers, but they 
must have been wishing they had studied geography when they 
found themselves having to make their way around the 
labyrinthine corridors of the parliament buildings with no maps 
provided. 
  The next step after speakers are elected will be forming a 
government, with President Oscar Luigi Scalfaro due to hand out 
a prime ministerial mandate as soon as this essential 
institutional task is carried out. 
  Most bets for the premier's office are being placed on Forza 
Italia leader Silvio Berlusconi, who was responsible for putting 
together the Freedom Front alliance of his party, the Northern 
League, National Alliance and some smaller parties. 
  Berlusconi found an unlikely champion today in the shape of 
Serb ultra-nationalist Voyslav Seselj who welcomed the 
right-wing victory and said it was the sole reason for Italy not 
having been bombed after NATO jets took off from these shores on 
their recent air strike against the Bosnian town of Goradze. 
  "Berlusconi is a patriot, and he will not go against his 
country's interests, and therefore he will object to NATO's 
taking off once again from bases in his country to strike Serbs 
in Bosnia," explained Seselj.

<F P=106> [Unattributed article: "Rwanda: Kigali Airport Under </F>
Italian, Belgian Control"] 
  [Text] (ANSA) Rome, April 13 -- The airport in Rwanda's 
war-torn capital Kigali is now under the control of Belgian and 
Italian troops, according to a communique from the Defence 
Ministry. 
  The Italian contingent in the airport consists of 133 men, 
with a further 29 standing by in nearby Nairobi. One Italian 
plane and two Belgian ones are on the apron in the airport. 
  The Italian troops, from the crack Col Moschin battalion, 
have carried out three operations outside the airport precinct 
to bring Italian nationals resident in Rwanda to safety. 
  With the help of the Belgian military, the number of 
Italians 
now evacuated from Rwanda stands at 138, with a further seven 
having reached neighbouring Burundi under their own steam, and 
eight more airlifted from an outlying village by a United 
Nations helicopter. 
  Italy has just under 200 of its nationals in the country, 
most of them nuns and priests. 
  According to the defence ministry, which is keeping a close 
watch on developments in the African country wracked by tribal 
clashes, the situation there is "difficult and dramatic."

<F P=106> [Unattributed article: "Berlusconi Open to Blind Trust and </F>
Federalism"] 
  [Text] (ANSA) Rome, April 11 -- Forza Italia leader Silvio 
Berlusconi said on Monday [11 April] that he saw the American 
so-called blind trust model as the best way to separate his 
business interests from public duties and voiced his readiness 
to accept federalism in Italy, if this is to mean 
decentralization of power. 
  Also today, representatives from the Freedom Alliance which 
won last month's elections -- Forza Italia, National Alliance 
and Northern League -- began meetings to hammer out a consensus 
for new speakers for the Senate and House, which will be seated 
on Friday. 
  Speaking to an assembly of Forza Italia candidates elected 
to 
parliament, held in the spa town Fiuggi outside Rome, Berlusconi 
said "I absolutely want to separate the private interests I have 
as shareholder in Fininvest from the public activities I will 
perform in the interests of all." Berlusconi and his family own 
total control of his holding conglomerate Fininvest which has 
interests in such areas as broadcasting and the printed media, 
publishing, advertising, insurance, money management, insurance, 
retail outlets and the first division soccer team AC Milan. 
  Answering press questions on the compatibility of his 
business and public interests, Berlusconi replied "We have no 
problems about examining this question. A law (already) exists 
which deals with this problem very precisely, only no one has 
brought it up, except for some members of the press." "We have 
no problem reopening the question," the Forza Italia leader 
continued, "but it is not easy, given that we are dealing with 
40 thousand people, put together through a creative and business 
effort of over 30 years. There can be no quick answers," 
Berlusconi added, "although one answer has already been given, 
concerning the separation of my interests in the activities of 
Fininvest, from which I have already stepped down. We are now 
examining how to best offer guarantees for this matter." 
  After stating how experts in international law and antitrust 
regulations had been given the task of finding a solution, 
Berlusconi turned his attention to speculation that parts of his 
empire were to be sold off. "There are certain areas of 
Fininvest which could be sold if the opportune offer were made. 
But one cannot make public the content of any such offer for 
this would diminish." 
  The "blind trust" formula is practiced by American 
businessmen who take public office. The subject declares all 
his or her interests which are then placed in a trust fund to be 
administered independently by an especially appointed board 
which, while proposed by the subject, must be approved by 
federal authorities. 
  Turning his attention to the issue of federalism, Berlusconi 
recalled how "Before the elections we ascertained the need to 
decentralize the state administration. After the elections, the 
League exerted pressure on us to make a commitment to change the 
constitution in the federal sense. From the start we have 
voiced out openness on the question and have requested 
information on it from the League. Our position has not changed 
since then.... We are open to what is in the interests of the 
nation." 
  Looking towards the next Italian government, Berlusconi was 
careful to recall how a mandate must first be given by head of 
State Oscar Luigi Scalfaro, and then stressed how the winning 
alliance represented a break with the past, a break he would 
personally guarantee if given the government mandate. 
  The man most seen as the next premier then went on to 
reiterate how his would be a government which holds the central 
ground of the political spectrum, which could see support from 
the center-right but also the center-left. 
  The first step towards a new government will the election in 
parliament, to be seated on Friday, for the speakers of the 
Senate and Lower House and while Berlusconi was in Fiuggi, his 
representative met with their counterparts from the winning 
alliance to discuss candidates. 
  For the Senate, where the Forza Italia-led coalition does 
not 
hold an absolute majority, the current speaker, Giovanni 
Spadolini, is considered by many to be the front-runner. His 
candidacy, however, is opposed by the Northern League of Umberto 
Bossi, which wants its outgoing Senate whip, Francesco Speroni, 
to take the chair. Spadolini is considered by observers to be 
an "institutional" solution, one which neither Forza Italia nor 
the National Alliance oppose. 
  Coming out of today's meeting, Raffaele Costa of the 
Centrist 
Union told the press "We believe conditions exist for the 
speakers of the House and Senate to be from the (government) 
majority and decided upon on Saturday." Costa, the outgoing 
transport minister and secretary of the Liberal Party, went on 
to confirm Speroni's candidacy but would not rule out other 
names. 
  For the House, Costa expressed his preference for fellow 
Liberal Alfredo Biondi and reiterated how, in any case, the next 
speaker would be from the winning alliance. 
  Political discussion today also looked at the possibility of 
Radical Marco Pannella's group joining the future government 
coalition and Pannella, who failed to win election, even being 
appointed as foreign minister. His candidacy was not frowned 
upon by the Northern League, with Number Two Roberto Maroni 
recalling how the League had originally proposed Pannella as 
foreign minister because of his staunch federalist views. 
  The idea of Pannella as foreign minister is opposed by the 
National Alliance, with its leader, Gianfranco Fini, also taking 
a dim view of the League taking over the Interior Ministry.

<F P=106> [Unattributed article: "Martino Says Government Imminent"] </F>
  [Text] (ANSA) Rome, April 13 -- Italy's new government will 
be formed "very, very shortly" in the view of Antonio Martino, a 
Friedmanite economist and chief architect of Silvio Berlusconi's 
free-market, tax-cutting economic platform. 
  "I think that the timeframe for the creation of the new 
executive will be very short indeed; the programme is already 
being vetted by the coalition," said the newly elected Forza 
Italia MP on the sidelines of a conference here. 
  Asked about his own immediate future, the man touted by many 
to hold a key economic post in the next government quipped: 
"Those who predict catastrophes suffer twice over, but I'm 
certainly about to give my last university lecture." 
  Before his involvement in politics, Martino was best-known 
as 
a comparatively lone voice in spreading Milton Friedman's 
monetarist theories from his post at a Rome private university, 
Luiss. 
  President Oscar Luigi Scalfaro -- who summoned Berlusconi 
for 
talks this morning -- is expected to give the Forza Italia 
leader a mandate to form an executive after the House speakers 
are elected, on Friday [15 April] or Saturday.

<F P=106> [Unattributed article: "25 Anti-Berlusconi Activists Ask For </F>
Asylum in United States"] 
  [Text] (ANSA) Rome, April 12 -- Twenty-five Italian 
activists in the group Boycott Berlusconi asked for political 
asylum in the United States and said, "Italy is already started 
towards non-democratic forms of government" following the 
general election victory March 27 of the Freedom Front led by 
Silvio Berlusconi, a media tycoon who turned full-time 
politician in January. 
  The request for asylum was advanced by the Boycott 
Berlusconi 
(Bo.Bi) members in a letter to U.S. Ambassador Reginald 
Bartolomew and made public here by the Verona-based 
organization. The U.S. Embassy in Rome had no comment on the 
letter. 
  According to the 25 signers, the electoral campaign which 
led 
to the win of Berlusconi's Freedom Front, a coalition of the 
businessman's Forza Italia, the federalist Northern League, the 
neo-fascist National Alliance and smaller groupings, "violated 
every rule set by the Parliament." 
  In this connection, Berlusconi was named as "the owner of 
three television networks, various publishing companies (and) an 
enormous network of other economic activities in a monopoly 
regime" who "did not heed the directives of the publishing 
guarantor." 
  The Boycott Berlusconi activists also said they were asking 
U.S. President Bill Clinton to turn to international 
organizations to check up on "democratic violations committed in 
our country" because "an electoral campaign of this type could 
not have taken place in a democratic country." 
  Berlusconi is expected to be tapped by the head of state to 
form the first government of the twelfth legislature.

<F P=106> [Unattributed report: "Scalfaro: Reconciliation on 25 </F>
April"] 
  [Excerpt] Rome -- Yesterday, in Ciociaria [near Rome], 
remembering a priest who was murdered by the Nazis, Scalfaro 
launched an appeal to "reconcile history with harmony among our 
people." The upcoming 25 April [Liberation Day] must therefore 
become the "day of concord." Fifty years after the Resistance, 
it is high time to bring the second post-war period to a close 
because "what is heard from all the dead, from the dead on all 
sides, from the sufferings of the mothers on all sides, is not 
the voice of divisiveness, resentment, opposition, but the voice 
of unity, fraternity, and love of our fatherland." 
  The appeal also seems to go half way toward meeting 
[National 
Alliance leader] Fini's requests for general pacification in the 
name of all victims, on all fronts, whether on the side of the 
victors or the vanquished. Scalfaro also made an appeal to 
judges: Avoid polemics and avoid being used instrumentally. On 
the other hand, Scalfaro forcefully confirmed the principle of 
the magistrature's autonomy and independence. [passage omitted]

Speaker Race"] 
  [Text] (ANSA) Rome, April 14 -- Francesco Speroni of the 
Northern League told the press this morning that he was out of 
the running for Senate Speaker, a move later praised by National 
Alliance leader Giancarlo Fini but denied by Marcello Staglieno, 
the Northern League's Senate whip before Speroni, member of his 
party's delegation to the majority table on speaker negotiations. 
  "Like I said yesterday" Speroni told the press this morning, 
"I am not taking part in today's meeting because there are 
people there I don't want to having anything to do with, at 
least until they change their style." 
  "In order not to create any obstacles on the path towards 
federalism" he announced, "I withdraw my candidacy. This 
because of the untrustworthiness of the alleged majority, which 
is unable to guarantee its unity in a secret ballot." 
  The speakers for the new parliament, Speroni predicted, will 
be Carlo Scognamiglio for the Senate and Irene Pivetti for the 
House. 
  Speroni then went on to confirm his, as he put it, "complete 
disgust for the party-politics with which some, but not from the 
League, carried out the negotiations... I will ask my party 
leadership not to be given tasks which imply having to have 
political contact with those behind this sleazy run-around." 
  For Senator Marcello Staglieno, however, Speroni remained 
the 
Northern League candidate for Senate Speaker and it was 
"logical" that the Northern League get the speaker's chair in 
the Senate and Forza Italia the House speakership. 
  Senator Staglieno also said he was against Roberto Maroni, 
of 
the Northern League, becoming House Speaker, preferring that he 
be deputy premier and Interior Minister. This, he said, would 
be a real break with the past since the interior ministry has 
been held by Christian Democrats for the past fifty years. 
  Speroni's withdrawal from the Senate speaker race was, 
according to Fini, a demonstration of the Northern League's 
readiness to come to a government agreement not only in word but 
also fact. 
  Fini went on to define Carlo Scognamiglio, the candidate of 
Forza Italia for the Senate chair, as "authoritative" yet 
recalled how there were others adding, however, that the 
decision will be known today.

<F P=106> [Unattributed article: "Megaloan for Italian Rebuilding of </F>
Russian Gaslines"] 
  [Text] (ANSA) Rome, April 14 -- SNAM SpA [National Gas 
Pipeline Company], the group in the public Ente Nazionale 
Idrocarburi (ENI [National Hydrocarbons Corporation]) energy and 
chemicals holding company in charge of the natural gas sector, 
said it was greatly satisfied today with the completion of a 
package of 1.6 billion dollars in financing for Russia's Gazprom 
which will boost the flow of Russian natural gas to Italy. 
  The operation to finance the restructuring of Russian 
natural 
gas pipelines by Italian companies, the first of its type for 
the republic, was managed by Italy's Mediocredito Centrale, 
Banca Commerciale Italiana and the West Merchant Bank. The loan 
will assure, said SNAM, an increase in imports of Russian 
natural gas within the terms of the agreement signed with 
Gazprom in 1969. 
  The ENI company also said the signing of the loan will 
further consolidate relations between Italy and Russia in this 
sector through a contract valued at 1.9 billion dollars for 
rebuilding and upgrading gaslines in Russia over the coming five 
years. 
  Mediocredito Centrale said the construction work will be 
done 
by the Tragaz Consortium made up of the ENI companies Nuovo 
Pignone SpA, planning and construction of the plant for the oil 
and chemical industry, and Snamprogetti SpA, another engineering 
company working in the fields of mining, chemicals and petroleum 
plants. 
  The work will lead to additional supplies of natural gas, 
estimated at 5.5 billion cubic meters, not now economically 
recoverable. 
  The financing, said Mediocredito, "is the most important 
completed in support of Italian exports" and the funds made 
available by the markets came to more than two billion dollars, 
as compared to the target of 1,615,000,000 billion dollars. The 
loan, at the fixed rate 5.71 percent, will be underwritten by 
the three sponsoring banks plus 40 credit institutes in 10 
nations. The Italian Export Credit Insurance Agency (SACE) has 
provided coverage of 95 percent of the financing with the 
remaining share covered by the exporters. 
  The funds will be earmarked for the Russian Federation 
purchase of Italian machinery, materials and services for the 
reconstruction of the gasline leading from Russian territory to 
Italy. 
  Since the signing of the 1969 contract, Italy has imported 
some 160 billion cubic meters of Russian natural gas and, at 
present, SNAM brings in 15 billion cubic meters of Russian 
natural gas which account for 27 percent of the volume marketed 
here by the ENI company. Russia also supplies Germany with 37 
percent of its natural gas requirement and France with 21 
percent. 
  SNAM natural gas sales last year came to 50 billion cubic 
meters and estimates of the nation's requirement by the year 
2000 put the figure at 75 billion cubic meters annually. The 
share of Italy's energy market accounted for by natural gas rose 
from 8 percent in 1967 to 25 percent last year.

<F P=106> [Unattributed report: "Huge Bomb Found North of Rome"] </F>
  [Text] (ANSA) - Rome, April 14 - A 70kg bomb discovered by 
the side of a road north of Rome was blown up in a controlled 
explosion Thursday evening [14 April], official sources said. 
  The explosive device, consisting of three cartons linked 
with 
wires and batteries, was spotted by the manager of a nearby 
service station, who alerted the police. The bomb had been 
placed in the gutter of the via Formellese, a small road leading 
into and out of Rome, and had been covered by tree branches. 
  A special bomb unit was called in to deal with the device. 
The controlled explosion was heard for miles around, and windows 
were shattered in nearby houses, which had been evacuated. 
  According to well-informed sources, the bomb was planted 
near 
the home of Mafia supergrass Salvatore Contorno, but police 
refused to comment on speculation that Contorno was the target 
for the bomb. Interior Ministry sources said that "at this point 
nothing can be ruled out." 
  Contorno is reported to live about seven km from the point 
where the bomb was placed, but does not travel that road every 
evening, well-informed sources said. 
  The device was blown up by a robot after explosives experts 
examined it and failed to defuse it manually. The robot directed 
a jet of water towards it, causing an explosion, but detailed 
photographs were taken beforehand. Investigators are now combing 
the fields around the bomb site for the remains of the device 
which, the sources said, was probably to have been set off by 
means of a radio command. 
  Contorno, 48, settled down in the area near Lake Bracciano 
north of Rome after an unsuccessful attempt at living under a 
witness protection scheme in the United States. He was arrested 
a first time in the Lake Bracciano region in 1982, when another 
supergrass, Tommaso Buscetta, persuaded him to collaborate with 
the authorities. His confessions led to 127 arrest warrants, but 
the collaboration slowed down and then dried up completely 
because, he said, "many of the people I accused were acquiteed 
and set free. Today the Mafia is stronger than ever, and Cosa 
Nostra's vendetta could strike me at any moment." 
  Contorno has lost 19 members of his and his wife's family in 
Mafia vendettas, and about thirty of his friends have fallen 
under Mafia bullets. 
  In a statement to ANSA this evening, Contorno's lawyer Luigi 
Li Gotti said "they predicted this. These mafiosi turned state's 
evidence have said many times that there would be bloody attacks 
against them." 
  According to Maria Rita Bonafede, the mayor of Formello 
where 
Contorno lives, the supergrass has no police escort, unlike 
former magistrate Carlo Palermo who occasionally visits the area 
to rest in his house outside the town.

<F P=106> ["ast" signed report: "SPOe Unanimously for Entry Into </F>
European Union; Yes Recommended for 12 June"] 
  [Excerpt] Innsbruck -- On Thursday [12 April], at a 
"historic party council session" in Innsbruck, the Social 
Democratic Party of Austria [SPOe] advocated a clear yes to 
Europe and thus to the European Union [EU]. The SPOe will 
recommend that Austrians vote for Austria's entry into the 
European Union in the referendum on 12 June; 220 delegates from 
all provinces and prominent party members came to Innsbruck. 
They not only listened with rapt attention to SPOe Chairman and 
Chancellor Franz Vranitzky's pleading for Europe, but they also 
agreed unanimously to the Federal Party Council's declaration. 
  In his speech of more than one hour, Vranitzky not only 
advocated entry into the European Union, but also the 
maintenance of neutrality. Both for security policy and 
economic reasons, it is absolutely necessary for Austria to 
participate in shaping and determining the European integration 
process. This cannot be done from the outside, but Austria has 
to actively shape things within the European Union. "This is 
also necessary because we have to take note of the fact that 
phenomena like nationalism, chauvinism, and fascism, which were 
believed to have been overcome long ago, are popping up again 
before our front door." 
  In the first place, Austria's road to the European Union 
also 
has to be positively assessed in the field of economy. "Full 
participation in a single market of 350 million people enlarges 
the domestic market 50 times for our small country, which 
depends on foreign trade," Vranitzky stressed. Austria will 
benefit above average alone because of its Central European 
location. [passage omitted]

<F P=106> [Report by Peter Grolig: "Yugoslav Mafia Financed War"] </F>
  [Text] The war in the former Yugoslavia does not just cost 
blood and lives; enormous sums are being spent to be able to 
continue the killing. The financiers of this madness get their 
money partly from crime -- and Austria is playing an important 
role as a country where the crimes are being committed and as a 
switching station. 
  Thus, for months members of the Task Force for Combating 
Organized Crime (EDOK) in the Interior Ministry, with the help 
of domestic and foreign security authorities, has been pursuing 
a gang of Serbs who have, so to speak, become heirs to the 
infamous "Yugoslav Mafia." 
  Crimes, which usually are drowned in statistics, have 
suddenly became particularly important, because the perpetrators 
were able to afford luxurious life-styles because of break-ins, 
car smuggling, protection racketeering, drug trafficking, arms 
dealing, as well as pick-pocketing and robbery, but a large part 
of the money gained in this way was passed on to Belgrade -- to 
Serbian politicians and military, it has emerged from 
interrogations. 
  Particularly coveted were "noncash means of payment": Since 
1992, one of the bosses of the gang said, he had taken over 
about 1,500 bank and traveler cheques stolen all over Europe. 
Per month! Female couriers smuggled the loot across the 
international borders. 
  Mafia experts in Milan forged the signatures and turned the 
cheques into money, using forged Serbian, Czech, and Italian 
personal documents. Just for this one branch, Zajim Sabanagic, 
33, established special "acquisition" and "utilization 
structures," among others in Belgium, Germany, France, and 
Austria. His painstaking accounts of the criminal deals would 
have "been a credit for any bank" (an investigator). 
  A total of 1,500 cheques (value about 3.5 million 
schillings) 
were recovered in one go. The damage (only in this field) is 
estimated to be at least 100 million schillings. 
  An interesting detail gained from the interrogations: When 
the officials asked Sabanagic about his accounts, two of which 
were known through surveillance, he pretended not to know 
anything. "Then we will send the money that we found to Bosnia," 
the policemen bluffed. The Serb confessed and promised to help 
making good the damage with "his" assets. 
  "We have managed to land the biggest blow so far against 
organized crime," enthused Walter Pretzner, head of EDOk, which 
was founded only a year ago. His summary of 35 arrests and 150 
reports to the police: 
  Crimes involving more than 20 million schillings have been 
solved. They include 20 cases of car smuggling, robberies (a 
bank robbery in Vienna as well as a brutal attack on German 
campers in France), and 40 break-ins in villas -- for instance 
the one in the villa of Vienna Court President Guenther 
Woratsch, when, among other things, a gun was stolen at 
Christmas 1992. In this connection, a search is under way for 
Ratko Bjelobaba, 36, who also cashed cheques, and Goran Sojic, 
28. Inquiries sent to the Belgrade police have produced no 
results.

  [Text] On Tuesday [12 April], during Iranian Foreign 
Minister 'Ali Akbar Velayati's visit to Austria, the interest of 
the media focused on human rights and the Rushdie case. 
However, during Velayati's talk with Economics Minister 
Schuessel, the focus was on the revival of Austrian-Iranian 
trade: In 1993 Austria's exports to Iran decreased by 20 
percent and imports even by 29 percent. The reason was Iranian 
payment difficulties and, as a result, nonliability by the 
Austrian Control Bank. In mid-March at least the obstacle of 
financing and liability was overcome: In bilateral negotiations 
in mid-March, Austria rescheduled Iranian debts amounting to 5 
million schillings.

  [Text] Although exports to China increased even more 
massively than imports from this country, Austria's trade 
deficit with China amounted to 4.1 billion schillings. 
  Exports of 3.7 billion schillings (plus 41.4 percent) were 
faced with imports of Chinese products of 7.8 billion schillings 
(plus 30.6 percent), it was stated during the presentation of a 
study of the Economic Research Institute on Tuesday [12 April]. 
  "Machines and plants amount to almost 70 percent of 
Austria's 
exports to China," Ernst Laschan, Austrian trade delegate to 
Beijing, said. With an export share of only 0.5 percent, China 
is the 25th of target countries for domestic exports. In the 
field of engines and road vehicles, Austria has already worked 
out a good position on the Chinese market, he said. 
  According to Laschan, Austria can protect future sales with 
products and know-how in the fields of agricultural technology, 
the securing of fresh water, energy, transportation systems, and 
telecommunications.

  [Text] The recession in 1993 was comparatively moderate in 
Austria: The gross domestic product [GDP] only shrunk by 0.3 
percent. The main reasons for last year's performance of the 
Austrian economy, which was better than expected, are to be 
found in industrial production and exports, which decreased less 
than predicted. Presently, the most important impetus for a new 
upswing is currently coming from both industry and exports.

<F P=106> [By Teilo Colley] </F>
  [Text] Defence Secretary Malcolm Rifkind tonight warned 
Serb forces in Bosnia to stop interfering with the peacekeeping 
activities of UN troops or face tough action. 
  He said it was too early to know if aggressive Serb 
responses 
to the NATO bombing of Serb targets in Bosnia were isolated 
incidents or part of an overall policy. 
  But he warned: "The UN would have total support of its 
member 
states, including the UK, if some action was required to protect 
UN personnel." 
  He was commenting amid reports that UN staff had been 
detained by Serbs and that Serb attacks on Tuzla airport had 
resumed since the weekend NATO attacks on their positions 
besieging the mainly Muslim enclave of Gorazde. 
  "These incidents will continue to happen, and we shouldn't 
be 
surprised at that," he told reporters during an official visit 
to the United States, where he is attempting to persuade his 
Washington counterpart William Perry to send American 
peacekeeping troops to Bosnia. 
  "We can't yet establish whether these were purely localised 
or part of a wider pattern.... We don't have the hard 
information at this time to know which this is," he said. 
  But Mr. Rifkind made it clear that he believed the UN would 
be prepared to take decisive action to protect the 3,300 British 
troops and other UN personnel on the ground in Bosnia. 
  Earlier, he told Channel 4 News: ``It's crucially important 
that the rights of UN personnel in Bosnia are entirely respected 
and the Serbs, and indeed others, should be under no illusion 
that the UN would have the total support of its member states, 
including the UK, if firm action was required to protect UN

  ``The UN are there in a humanitarian role and in a 
peacekeeping role. They cannot be treated in other than a 
proper and appropriate fashion and I think there will be no 
controversy in Britain or elsewhere if the UN was required to 
take tough measures to protect its own people.''

<F P=106> [Anne Segall report: "Clarke Reveals How Bank Vetoed Rate </F>
Cut Plan"] 
  [Text] The Chancellor of the Exchequer Kenneth Clarke, 
yesterday swept aside the traditional secrecy surrounding 
decisions on interest rates when he disclosed that the Governor 
of the Bank of England, Eddie George, effectively vetoed his 
plan to reduce rates by a half point in February, forcing a 
compromise cut of a quarter point to 5.25 percent. 
  The cut was the smallest since April 1985 and proved 
insufficent to allow a decline in mortgage costs. Building 
societies dismissed the move as "a technical adjustment," 
claiming that they were unable to pass on the benefit to 
customers. 
  The timing of the February interest rate cut has also proved 
controversial, with the Bank sending out the signal for cheaper 
money just two days after an upward adjustment in American 
interest rates. That precipitated a sharp sell-off in world 
bond markets with the British market suffering a particularly 
savage correction. 
  As a result, the cost of long-term money has risen sharply, 
making it more expensive for home owners to obtain fixed-rate 
mortgage finance. 
  Discrepancies in the statements put out by the Bank and the 
Treasury at the time of the February rate cut added to the 
confusion and Mr Clarke admitted yesterday that the resulting 
muddle had finally persuaded him to make public the minutes of 
his regular meetings with the Governor after a lag of six weeks. 
  However, the Chancellor made it clear that he had not made 
the decision lightly. He had been influenced by the 
recommendation to publish contained in a report by the powerful 
backbench Treasury and Civil Service Committee and had "ghosted" 
the idea for some months. 
  The move was also consistent with other strategies designed 
to make the conduct of monetary policy more transparent and less 
subject to political influences, including the decision to allow 
the Bank to publish an independent quarterly report on inflation. 
  The Governor hoped that by giving the market the opportunity 
to appreciate the nuances behind interest rate decisions, 
speculation would be reduced rather than increased. However, he 
said that there would be a learning process and admitted that it 
might not be "a particularly comforting process." 
  Yesterday's announcement was accompanied by the publication 
of minutes for the last three meetings between the Chancellor 
and the Governor, including the February meeting where the 
decision to cut base rates from 5.5 percent to 5.25 percent was 
taken. The February minutes reveal that Mr George would have 
preferred to hold rates unchanged because he feared an adverse 
reaction in financial markets and a loss of credibility. Mr 
Clarke had on the other hand expressed concern about the likely 
impact of higher taxes from April and argued that a rate cut in 
April might be "too late." 
  Financial markets are likely to focus on the minutes for 
March in which the Chancellor holds out the prospect of further 
interest rate cuts, drawing attention to the fall in share and 
bond prices. He says that "it would be appropriate to consider 
a further reduction in interest rates if indicators subsequently 
suggested that activity was subdued and inflationary pressures 
remained under firm control."

<F P=106> [Interview with Polish Prime Minister Waldemar Pawlak by </F>
Edith Heller; place and date not given: "Above All, I Expect 
Partnership"] 
  [Text] [Heller] Is your German visit to be considered an 
expression of the continuity of Poland's German policy? 
  [Pawlak] I think one must always seek ways of expanding 
cooperation. The trade deficit with our biggest trade partner, 
Germany, has been causing us problems lately. Balanced 
cooperation is very important to us, and we hope the necessary 
balance will be achieved not through restrictions, but through 
new forms of cooperation. 
  [Heller] In Brussels, you suggested a "Partnership for 
Development" as a parallel to Partnership for Peace. What do 
you expect from the Germans? 
  [Pawlak] Above all, partner-like relations and an active 
search for common interests. Balanced advantages on both sides 
help overcome obstacles and bring the two countries' economies 
closer together. In this way, Poland's maneuvering space in the 
process of rapprochement between our countries also becomes 
bigger. On the other hand, as soon as a greater imbalance 
occurs, problems begin. 
  [Heller] Apart from a trade deficit, the Polish statistics 
also reveal an increase in the Polish National Bank's foreign 
currency reserves. If every German who visited Poland last year 
had spent 100 German marks, the deficit would have been quickly 
paid off. 
  [Pawlak] I trust the European Union's [EU] statistics, and 
these show a clear deficit. But that can be compensated by a 
reasonable level of trade between border areas. However, it is 
an oversimplification to suggest that everyone who crosses our 
border should spend so many marks. Instead, we should 
concentrate on those enterprises that actually determine the 
economic situation. Specific consideration and activity can 
easily form the nucleus of our economic cooperation. Therefore, 
this cooperation is useful because it permits direct contacts 
between any people, and thus creates a climate of practical 
cooperation. 
  [Heller] It is a well-known fact that as head of the Polish 
Government, you drive a Polonez car. During your visit here 
have you shown an interest in other makes of car? 
  [Pawlak] I am really an auto engineer. I was interested in 
cars long before I was interested in politics. My side trip to 
Stuttgart will also be a reminder of my first long trip to 
Germany. Generally speaking, we are interested in cooperation, 
especially the kind of cooperation that involves investments on 
Polish territory. Investments by large significant firms, such 
as Volkswagen in Poznan, show that it is worth investing in 
Poland. I think a similar investment by Mercedes is also 
feasible. We are concerned about creating new jobs, and already 
have tried-and-tested contacts that make it easier to sell 
Polish products on third markets. 
  [Heller] Waiting times on the German-Polish border are 
getting longer and longer because of the increased goods and 
personal traffic. Can Poland afford to be so difficult to enter? 
  [Pawlak] If that were merely a Polish-German problem, we 
would have surely solved it already. But we are dealing with a 
peripheral EU border, as well as heavy transit traffic toward 
the East. In the immediate future we will concentrate on 
developing two transit routes -- the 
Swiecko-Poznan-Warsaw-Terespol route, which continues via Minsk 
to Moscow; and the Wroclaw-Katowice-Krakow route, which connects 
Saxony and Ukraine. Accordingly, as far as goods traffic is 
concerned, we are going to expand the border crossing points at 
Swiecko (Frankfurt-Oder) and Zgorzelec (Goerlitz), and later the 
one at Olszyna (Forst). The modern terminal in Swiecko should 
be ready this year. But there is also visible progress at those 
crossing points used for local border traffic. The 
modernization of the Warsaw-Berlin railroad line should also be 
completed this year. Despite all the economic problems, these 
projects are very important for us. 
  [Heller] German Foreign Minister Klaus Kinkel wants to offer 
the Baltic countries association agreements with the EU similar 
to the one Poland has already concluded. How does Poland view 
this matter? 
  [Pawlak] Poland wants to play an active role in this part of 
Europe. The inclusion of the Baltic countries in the European 
integration process is of major significance to us. Following 
the admission of Austria, Norway, Sweden, and Finland to the EU, 
general interest in the Balkan region will increase, and Poland 
will lie in the center of this new EU zone. 
  [Heller] Will the treaty on good-neighborly relations with 
Lithuania also contain a guarantee that Lithuania will receive 
support in its efforts to join the EU? 
  [Pawlak] The treaty with Lithuania concerns our mutual 
relations, and has nothing to do with multilateral agreements. 
It is the last link in the chain of basic treaties with all our 
neighbors. There were a few problems with assessing our common 
past, but these have been overcome. 
  [Heller] Do you fear the emergence of a new Berlin-Moscow 
axis? How else can one explain Sejm speaker Jozef Oleksy's 
proposal to expand the "Weimar Triangle" by including Russia in 
it? 
  [Pawlak] If one looks at the map, one sees that Warsaw lies 
on the line between Berlin and Moscow, and it seems quite normal 
to me that we are interested in being included in these 
contacts. There are exciting prospects here, especially in the 
economic sphere, for example the gas pipeline that will lead 
from Russia to Germany via Poland. Such enterprises show that 
one must seek concrete new solutions, without adhering to 
symbols. The problems that have to be solved lie in the 
economic, legal, and financial spheres. 
  [Heller] Do you think it really lies in Poland's interests 
to expand a structure like the "Weimar Triangle," that joins 
Warsaw to Bonn, by including other partners in it? 
  [Pawlak] I will let others deal with such purely political 
concepts. I am interested in practical aspects. We have so 
many problems that we can employ a really large number of people 
in solving them. Political contacts are important, but lasting 
foundations are laid by means of economic cooperation and 
interpersonal contacts. 
  [Heller] Your voters expect a lot of changes in Poland. 
Other people fear the opposite, a return to the old 
relationships. What has changed since your Peasant Party and 
the Democratic Left Alliance took over the government? 
  [Pawlak] Our economic performance for the first quarter of 
1994 is very significant. Inflation has reached its lowest 
point in seven years, and output has risen by 10 percent. That 
shows that the resolutions we adopted at the end of 1983 are 
correct. The first decision we made was to concentrate on the 
economy and give up political rhetoric. The second decision was 
to concentrate social aid on those groups of people with the 
lowest incomes. That led to an increase in income tax. At the 
same time, we introduced tax concessions for investments. 
  [Heller] These changes represent a shift in emphasis rather 
than an adjustment of policy. 
  [Pawlak] Basically, we have drawn conclusions from the 
development of recent years. We want an evolutionary 
development, without shocks and sudden changes. It is also 
important for us to expand the social framework of the reforms 
by easing the burdens and supporting the lowest income groups. 
In addition, we want to include the broadest possible 
cross-section of society in the process of change. Only in this 
way will it be possible to implement the changes in a democratic 
way. My government's third concern is to rationalize the use of 
the resources at our disposal. An example is the draft law on 
the duty to invite tenders when spending public funds. All in 
all, our objectives are democracy, a social market economy, and 
a respectable position for Poland in the family of free peoples.

<F P=106> [Report by Michael Enger, Philip Siegel, and Hans-Peter </F>
Weymar] 
  [Excerpt] [passage omitted] In March 1994, Defense 
Minister Volker Ruehe said: Germany cannot check to see whether 
weapons delivered by Germany are being used against Kurds in 
Turkey. 
  This year, the shops remain closed in Diyabakir, Kurdistan's 
secret capital. The Kurds' New Year celebration does not take 
place -- out of fear of the Turkish military. 
  There is a German BTR-60 armored personnel carrier near 
Diyabakir. The photograph shown here was taken three weeks ago. 
  A former colonel of the National People's Army [NVA] and 
expert on tank technology has now confirmed the research done by 
Monitor. 
  [Begin ex-NVA Colonel Lotahr Mann recording] These tanks, 
which are BTR-60 PB armored personnel carriers, clearly come 
from the stocks of the former NVA. Proof of that are the 
changes that have been made on the vehicles, in particular 
regarding external lighting, but also those changes that were 
made on the vehicles in connection with the transition to the 
licensing regulation under the FRG traffic code, such as 
rearview mirrors. Thus, it is quite clear that these vehicles 
are not deliveries from the former Soviet Union or from Russia, 
but that these are clearly German tanks. [end recording] 
  Only two weeks ago did we visit several towns and villages 
in 
Turkish Kurdistan again. After just two days on this trip, we 
identified German military materiel in six different places 
[video shows a map of Turkey on which Elazig, Maden, Ergani, 
Tatvan, Silvan, and Hasankeyf are marked]. Nevertheless, 
despite all the photographs, television pictures, and 
eyewitnesses, the foreign minister is still denying everything. 
  [Begin Foreign Minister Klaus Kinkel recording] I have 
really tried to clarify the matter. We have never managed to 
get direct proof. [end recording] 
  [Monitor moderator Klaus Bednarz] Two weeks ago, I sent 
Foreign Minister Kinkel a video tape with the Monitor cast of 
last November, which documented the use of German tanks against 
the Kurds. One week ago, I received the response that the tape 
had been forwarded to the FRG Defense Ministry for examination. 
We have not heard anything since then. How long do the 
gentlemen in the Defense Ministry actually need to recognize 
their own tanks?

  [Text] Hamburg (DDP/ADN) -- The Hamburg customs authority 
has confirmed the planned shipment of 212 Stinger missiles to 
Turkey via Hamburg. All the necessary documents are on hand, 
thus there are no further obstacles to the shipment, a customs 
spokesman said this afternoon. The containers of missiles are 
due to arrive in Hamburg by rail on the morning of 16 April. 
  The Hamburg Green-Alternative List (GAL) were the first to 
become aware of the missile export, which involves missiles 
manufactured by the firm of Dornier in Friedrichshafen, the GAL 
said. They are to be shipped directly to Turkey on a Turkish 
ship. The GAL called upon the German Government and the Hamburg 
City Council to prevent the shipment. A council spokesman said 
that, as far as this issue is concerned, "They would not get 
involved in federal matters."

<F P=106> ["fy"-signed report: "Worried About German Armament"] </F>
  [Text] Bonn, 13 April -- State Secretary Schoenbohm, who 
is responsible for armament issues in the Defense Ministry, has 
come out in favor of amending the German armament export 
regulations and harmonizing the regulations in Europe. The 
current situation makes it almost impossible to preserve key 
capacities for defense technology and to deepen armament 
cooperation in the European Union [EU]. Speaking to the 
participants in the annual meeting of the Defense Technology 
Association, Schoenbohm said that Bonn is striving for an 
agreement with France, Italy, and England about which countries 
are to be excluded from supplies with armament goods and in 
which countries armament goods may be delivered. 
Unfortunately, the positions are still far apart, both because 
of economic interests as well as because of ideological 
differences. Germany cannot uncouple itself by pointing to its 
"special" moralism, its past, or the Constitution when Europe's 
security is involved. "Do we want to found a new German special 
way of moralism by pointing to this past?" Schoenbohm asked. It 
is necessary to remain a reliable partner of the international 
community. Specific security policy action is oriented toward 
interests. 
  Schoenbohm pointed out that the German defense budget went 
down by 18 percent from 1989-93 if the inflation rate is taken 
into consideration. In 1995, the decline will probably grow to 
25 percent. Since cutbacks of personnel and operations are 
hardly possible, saving was affected all the more in financial 
means for investments and research. From 1989-93, these means 
went down by 43 percent and will have declined by 55 percent by 
1995. By 1995, the means available for procurement will even be 
60 percent lower than those in 1989. The decline in orders by 
the Bundeswehr caused German armament industry to lose half of 
the 280,000 jobs by the end of last year. This year and next 
year, industry expects the loss of another 40,000 to 60,000 jobs. 
  Schoenbohm also thinks that this development is dangerous 
because the imminent loss of armament technology skills in key 
branches creates undesirable dependence on other states and 
destroys the preconditions for having Germany participate in 
cooperation projects in the field of armament. After all, an 
efficient German armament industry is also an essential element 
for Germany's ability to function in the Alliance. 
  The state secretary said that the future of German armament 
industry lies in systems technology and high technology, command 
and weapons operations systems, sensors, and electronics. 
Together with the industry, the Defense Ministry is trying to 
work out the minimum capacities in defense technology, predict 
their utilization during the planning period, and determine 
fields of equipment that must be taken care of at all costs. In 
the future, aspects of armament technology and armament 
economics will be taken into account in Bundeswehr planning to a 
greater extent than so far, the state secretary said.

<F P=106> [Article by Carola Kaps: "In Washington Scharping Shows His </F>
Affinity for Clinton"] 
  [Text] Washington, 13 Apr -- In his Washington lecture on 
the subject "Challenges and Options: the SPD's Agenda for 
Political and Economic Change in Germany," the Social Democratic 
Party of Germany [SPD] chancellor candidate Scharping hardly 
omitted a single important keyword that would not have been all 
too familiar to his U.S. audience from the mouth of their own 
President. Just like Clinton, Scharping is also convinced that 
only he who stands on firm feet in domestic policy can act 
strongly and make himself heard in terms of foreign policy. The 
creation of jobs, the promotion of growth and securing social 
justice are, thus, the most important tasks in terms of foreign 
policy for both of them. Scharping has also taken up the cause 
of fighting crime. 
  Just like Clinton before him, the chancellor candidate 
speaks 
of the necessity "to renew and modernize Germany." The demand 
to "reinvent the government and to trim bureaucracy" and to 
increase the efficiency of state services are to be found here 
and there. Clinton's call for public welfare reform contrasts 
with Scharping's reform of the welfare state. For both it is 
clear that the modernization of the economy can only be achieved 
through close cooperation between the state and the private 
economy. The state does not only have the task to provide a 
reliable framework for the economy but it also must participate 
in training and retraining employees, promotion of high 
technology, and speeding up the innovation process. Scharping 
does not forget either to support the call for "information 
highways," and, by trying to emerge somewhat from Clinton's 
shadow, he adds as a personal suggestion that the information 
highways should be extended across the Atlantic. Scharping 
emphasizes his similarity to Clinton also when responding to 
questions regarding his tax reform that just like Clinton he 
wanted to take some burden off investments and ask more money 
from high-income earners. Nobody from among his U.S. audience 
cared to ask whom Scharping counts among the high-income earners 
and where he would draw the line. The question how Scharping 
wanted to create jobs and maintain the high German wage level at 
the same time, is not being asked either. The lines along which 
Scharping is thinking become, however, obvious when he speaks of 
the nonsense of spending more than 100 billion German marks a 
year on unemployment benefits. He says that it is cheaper to 
keep unemployed on state job-creation schemes. 
  Differences to Clinton do appear when the SPD chancellor 
candidate speaks about restoring social justice. He speaks 
convincingly about the industrial nation's duty to take care of 
"sustained global development" to preserve the environment. He 
remains vague in describing his social agenda; it also remained 
unclear what he has in mind when he speaks of the reform of the 
welfare state. His statement that "in Germany there are no 
excesses in the social system, but quite the contrary," met with 
lack of understanding. In a country in which such a social 
network does not even exist and in which "welfare as we know it" 
should be abolished and be replaced by the obligation to work, 
there is little understanding for the German social system.

<F P=106> ["fy"-initialed report: "It Is Not To Be a Mud-Slinging </F>
Campaign"] 
  [Text] Bonn, 13 Apr -- The Christian Democratic Union 
[CDU] and Christian Social Union [CSU] do not want to let their 
election campaign become a mud-slinging campaign, but they are 
striving for a strong polarization to make the voter decide 
between "red-green" or the CDU/CSU. This has been agreed upon 
by the leading politicians of the two parties in a talk, which 
lasted more than five hours and was held in the chancellor's 
office on Tuesday evening [12 April]. CDU Secretary General 
Hintze said that the CDU/CSU is on the verge of "rising to its 
greatest election campaign strength and bringing about a change 
in the mood." 
  The party leadership, which met under the chairmanship of 
their heads Kohl and Waigel, established a working group. It is 
to work out a government and working program for 1994-98 and 
present it before the summer recess. In addition, an election 
campaign committee was formed to coordinate that European and 
Bundestag election of the CDU and CSU. Hintze said that in the 
election campaign of the CDU and CSU, the conflict about 
safeguarding jobs by strengthening the upswing is the top 
priority. In addition, the CDU/CSU works for Germany's internal 
unification and the further development of the equalization of 
burdens on families toward an equalization of benefits for 
families with children. Hintze and [CSU Secretary General] 
Huber were not able to say what this should be like. In 
addition, the CDU/CSU wants to work for a more efficient 
combating of crime and a further increase in housing 
construction. The record of 500,000 new apartments should be 
exceeded in the next few years. In addition, the CDU/CSU wants 
to stress the value of a stable currency and promise a tax 
reduction in the long run. The main opponent of the CDU/CSU is 
the Social Democratic Party of Germany [SPD]. Scharping will be 
presented as a "political shirker" who tries to cover up the 
real intentions of the SPD. 
  CSU Secretary General Huber stressed the will of the 
Bavarian 
sister party to get as close as possible to the CDU. This time 
there will not be an election campaign against Bonn, he added. 
The tenor of the election campaign will be the statement: 
"There is no alternative to Kohl, the experienced chancellor." 
Despite the well-known results of opinion polls, his party 
considers the outcome of the elections to be "open." It will 
try to win the elections by winning over the largest possible 
part of the so far undecided people eligible to vote, which 
oscillates between 25 and 40 percent. In addition to the person 
of the chancellor, one intends to stress the reliability of the 
financial policy characterized by Theo Waigel and contribute to 
the polarization by campaign Waigel and Lafontaine, who is 
envisaged by the SPD as finance minister. The CDU and CSU also 
want to gain profile as "parties of property" and point to the 
disastrous consequences of the SPD's proposal to tax real estate 
property on the basis of the market value instead of the basic 
value. One intends to act tough against the Republikaner and 
the German People's Union and tell the people that "decent 
Germans" cannot vote for these parties. The Greens are a 
security risk because of their intention to dissolve the 
Bundeswehr and to leave NATO -- and this is how they will be 
presented.

<F P=106> [Report by Peter Scherer: "Neo-Nazis Offer Pact to </F>
Schoenhuber"] 
  [Text] Frankfurt/Bonn -- Interior Minister Kanther 
(Christian Democratic Union) will present the report by the 
Federal Office for the Protection of the Constitution for 1993 
in Bonn today. He will again reject a ban of the Republikaner. 
The information that has been gathered is allegedly not 
sufficient to substantiate the suspicion of right-wing extremism 
against Schoenhuber's party. 
  Meanwhile, neo-Nazis and right-wing extremists have offered 
the Republikaner "sensible action alliances" and "active 
election support" for the Bundestag elections. In a strategy 
document of the right-wing extremist National List (NL), the 
brown ideologists propose "organized comrade circles" for a 
"basic unity among the `national opposition,' which should also 
include the most radical fringes." The document reads: "We 
believe that this might and should one day develop into a 
`right-wing popular front....'" First of all, however, the 
slogan is "Republikaner into the Bundestag." 
  According to the analysis by the Federal Office for the 
Protection of the Constitution, the National List has for a long 
time been trying to "mobilize supporters of different neo-Nazi 
and other right-wing extremist groups to form an action 
committee out of all organizations." 
  In its strategic considerations, the National List is not 
impressed by the fact that Schoenhuber has distanced himself 
from the NL and called for its ban. The neo-Nazis believe that 
the entry of the Republikaner into the Bundestag would be "quite 
useful for us." They give the following reason: Media 
campaigns and the military actions of antifascist groups would 
concentrate to a greater extent on this bourgeois-rightist 
group. Moreover, "if Schoenhuber receives 30 seats in the 
Bundestag with 5 percent of the vote, there will be the one or 
the other extremist deviationist. Even a single (autonomous) 
ultraradical nationalist deputy in the Bundestag would be a 
similar advantage for the `National Opposition' like the deputy 
of the Christian Democratic Union [CDU], Krause, who joined the 
Republikaner." 
  The NL strategists are convinced that a success of the 
Republikaner would cost Kohl his chancellorship. Over the 
medium term, the CDU could no longer try to win votes "on the 
right fringe" and maintain the "bourgeois center" at the same 
time. This would lead to a leeway on the right fringe of the 
spectrum, as has existed for a long time on the left fringe 
because of the Greens and recently also because of the Party of 
Democratic Socialism that exists in "central Germany."

  [Text] Bonn (DDP/ADN) -- The radical right-wing 
Republikaner (REP) party is showing signs of efforts toward 
right-wing extremism. This emerges from the 1993 report by the 
Office for the Protection of the Constitution, which was 
submitted today in Bonn by Interior Minister Manfred Kanther. 
Statements by leading Republikaner representatives indicated 
right-wing extremist efforts in contravention of the basic 
freedom-based democratic order, the report said. According to 
the report, the Republikaner have 16 regional associations 
throughout Germany, comprising 23,000 members. 
  The number of organized and nonorganized right-wing 
extremists in Germany has scarcely changed compared with last 
year, according to the report. In 1993 there were 41,500. 
There are also 650 neo-Nazis belonging to groups that have now 
been banned, as well as another 300 who are not in organized 
groups. Compared with 1992, acts of violence motivated by 
xenophobia decreased by about 30 percent in 1993. In 1993, 
1,609 such acts of violence were registered, while in 1992 there 
were 2,277. However, the number of other offenses such as 
threats or provocation rose from 2,731 to 5,112. 
  The 1993 report by the Office for the Protection of the 
Constitution also says that the threat to internal security as a 
result of acts of violence by left-wing extremists was more 
serious in 1993 than in the previous year. Reference is made to 
the bomb attack on the new prison building in Weiterstadt near 
Darmstadt by the Red Army Faction (RAF) terrorist organization 
on 27 March 1993, and to the incident on 27 June 1993 in Bad 
Kleinen, when suspected RAF terrorist Wolfgang Grams was shot 
dead by the GSG-9 crack force. The left-wing extremist potential 
is prepared to use force chiefly consisted of anarchists. 
Membership of these groups is still growing. 
  In 1993, the trend emerging since 1988 of foreign extremists 
increasingly using violence to enforce their political 
objectives has continued. In that context, five people were 
killed. A large number of the acts of violence committed by 
foreign extremists were attributed to Kurdish and Turkish 
left-wing extremist groups. The number of members of Kurdish 
organizations is estimated to be 6,900 (1992:4,850).

<F P=106> ["uhl"-initialed report: "Government Too Optimistic"] </F>
  [Text] Bonn, 13 Apr -- In the view of Uwe Jens, economic 
policy spokesman of the Social Democratic Party of Germany 
Bundestag group, the Federal Government is interpreting the 
"meager signs of economic recovery" far too optimistically. 
Even if the GNP were to be about 1 percent higher in 1994 than 
it was in 1993, this does not change anything concerning the 
economic and, above all, the difficult long-term structural 
problems. Therefore, an "active German and European economic 
policy" is necessary. Thus, the Bundesbank should lower the 
prime rate to about 3 to 4 percent by June. The European Union 
must decide quickly on its infrastructure program of about 29 
billion German marks. After the signing of the new GATT 
agreement, the agreed reduction of trade barriers are to be 
implemented quickly. In addition, an innovation offensive 
should be started, Jens said.

<F P=106> ["eli"-signed report: "Industry Wants More Money From Bonn"] </F>
  [Text] Bonn -- A controversy has erupted between the 
Defense Ministry and the Eurofighter Consortium over new 
financial claims from the industry. The ministry confirmed 
demands amounting to 570 million German marks [DM] for the 
development of the Eurofighter (Fighter 90). However, State 
Secretary Joerg Schoenbohm told the Defense Committee of the 
Bundestag that the government will not accept such high demands. 
According to the Defense Ministry, costs involving 
approximately DM160 million are realistic. They resulted from 
the fact that the industry had to develop a cheaper version 
after the decision by Defense Minister Ruehe (Christian 
Democratic Union). 
  The most recent demands by the consortium that is involved 
in 
the construction of the fighter were received by the Defense 
Ministry in March. At the same time, the Eurofighter prototype 
performed its maiden flight, but with engines of the Tornado 
aircraft and an incompletely developed electronic system. The 
Defense Ministry estimated the costs for the modification of the 
fighter plane to an improved model at DM300 million. However, 
the industry agreed to assume a little less than half the costs. 
The government is willing to provide DM160 million for the new 
control system. All other costs are not acceptable or have been 
caused by the industry because of delays in the development. 
Negotiations on the additional costs are to be concluded by the 
summer. New demands were also addressed to Great Britain, 
Spain, and Italy, which are all participating in the development 
of the fighter plane. 
  The Eurofighter Consortium continues to offer the complete 
aircraft, including the required equipment (system price), at 
DM102.5 million. Ruehe stated in December 1992 that he is not 
willing to pay more than $60 million for an aircraft, which 
corresponded to approximately DM90 million at the time. The 
Defense Ministry now expects a system price for the complete 
fighter of below DM100 million, which is the price level of 
December 1992. If one takes into consideration the inflation 
rate, the offer would be acceptable for the industry. Ruehe has 
not commented on the system price recently. The newly elected 
Bundestag will make a decision on the acquisition of the 
aircraft in one year when the fighter will be fully developed.

<F P=106> ["J.L."-initialed report: "Sizable Improvement of Economy </F>
in Western Germany"] 
  [Text] Frankfurt, 13 Apr -- The demand for industrial 
products made in western Germany was much keener in February 
than in January or in the last three months of 1993. This was 
stated by the Bundesbank in its recent monthly report. 
Different to the previous months, it was not only orders from 
abroad that increased. For the first time domestic orders 
significantly increased, too. Compared to the same period last 
year, both the value and the volume was superior in February 
1994. Production also increased sizeably in February. In the 
January/February period, production was hardly lower than the 
average of the last three months of 1993. In the main 
construction industry, demand shot up more than 10 percent in 
real terms in January within one year. Building production was 
3.5 percent up in the first two months compared to last year. 
  The Bundesbank writes that in eastern Germany construction 
orders were almost 50 percent up on January 1993. Building 
production was about one-third higher than last year's level. 
In the manufacturing industry, orders went up more than 25 
percent over last year. There was an increase above the average 
in domestic orders. However, even orders from abroad, which 
were fluctuating strongly in the preceding months, were clearly 
higher than in January 1993. Production increased by more than 
20 percent within one year. "The importance" of hidden 
unemployment has "significantly decreased": With a total of 
135,000 people working short-time, this number is down 110,000 
compared to March 1993. The number of people on schemes related 
to labor market policy (further training and job-creation 
programs) has dropped from 485,000 in March 1993 to 245,000.

<F P=106> ["um" report: "Industrial Production in the West Has </F>
Meanwhile Overcome Its Low Point"] 
  [Text] Munich, 12 Apr -- According to its own assessment, 
west German industry has overcome its low point in production. 
In the second quarter of 1994 most sectors expect a net output 
considerably higher than that of the same quarter last year. 
This is the result of a poll conducted by Ifo [Institute for 
Economic Research] in Munich among 352 industrial companies at 
the beginning of the year. 
  Compared with the corresponding period last year, Ifo 
calculates growth rates of more than 1 percent for the second to 
the fourth quarter of 1994 based on information provided by the 
companies. In total, an increase of industrial net output by 
1.25 percent is expected for 1994. Next year, the growth will 
probably go up even more and the average growth rate will 
increase to 2.5 percent. In August 1993 the companies feared a 
decline in output of 0.5 percent in 1994. 
  Most sectors of the raw materials and producer goods 
industry 
recovered in the course of 1993. According to Ifo, a growth 
rate of 1.5 percent in 1994 and 1 percent in 1995 is certain for 
this main industrial group, even without a production index that 
clearly continues upward. 
  The producers of investment goods expect the most dynamic 
development. From their information it is possible to calculate 
a 4.5-percent increase in output for 1995, following 1.75 
percent in 1994. The upswing is essentially supported by 
machine-building, road vehicle construction, and electrical 
engineering. In contrast, the consumer goods sector is still 
weak, showing negative rates of change this year (in total minus 
1.25 percent) and only a slight increase by the end of 1995 
(plus 0.25 percent). Obviously, the companies do not see any 
factors that could compensate for the renewed decline in 
spending on consumer goods as a result of tax increases. 
  Despite the expected strong recovery, by the end of 1995 the 
investment goods sector will have reached only the level of 
mid-1989. The consumer goods sector, where the slump was 
considerably less pronounced, will also reach this level, while 
it continues to stagnate. As a result of its stability shown 
during the period of its downturn, only the basic materials and 
producer goods sector can reach its so far highest annual 
average level of 1992 by the end of 1995, assuming that the 
companies are able to implement their assessments.

<F P=106> [Renate Koecher report: "Flourishing Landscapes, Wilting </F>
Moods?"] 
  [Text] Eastern Germany received promises of flourishing 
landscapes, but during the first three years of unity it was 
necessary to work hard and clean up a country ravaged by 
socialism and a planned economy. Now, in the spring of the 
fourth year after unity, the fruits of this immense cleanup 
effort are visible. Sixty-seven percent of east German survey 
respondents have said that things are clearly looking up in 
their immediate surroundings. Their observations are based 
mainly on the comprehensive construction work in progress, the 
improvements to the infrastructure, and the new shops and 
factories. Only a fifth of the respondents were despondent, 
claiming that nothing was changing and that there were no signs 
of any improvement in eastern Germany. 
  The population of eastern Germany is experiencing unity 
differently than are west Germans, for whom unity was mainly a 
news story. Ninety-two percent of the east German respondents 
and 37 percent of the west German respondents claim that unity 
has changed their lives. Most of the respondents in the old 
laender who said they had noticed changes painted a rather 
negative picture, and many of them said that the financial 
burden of unity was a major contributory factor to the 
recession. The great majority of the east German respondents, 
61 percent, said they had personally profited from unity, and 25 
percent said they had suffered because of it. The proportion of 
people in the latter category has been falling for two years, 
whereas the proportion of people in the former category is 
rising all the time. 
  What is remarkable is that many respondents mistrust their 
own generally positive experience and have a more negative 
opinion of general developments than is justified by the 
reality. Eighty-five percent of the respondents in the new 
laender are convinced that the situation of women in eastern 
Germany has deteriorated as a result of unity. But in fact, 
most female respondents, just like male respondents, have a 
generally positive opinion. Fifty-seven percent of female 
respondents said their personal situation has improved since 
unity, 21 percent said their situation has deteriorated, and 16 
percent see no difference. 
  The financial situation of east German households is 
improving rapidly. Already in October 1990, 34 percent of these 
households could afford to buy more than before the turnabout, 
one year later 39 percent could do so, and today 47 percent of 
households can afford more than they could before the changes. 
On the other hand, the proportion of those suffering a decline 
in their living standards is at a constant 16 percent. The 
widespread view that the increased incomes have been completely 
swallowed by rising costs is false. The amount of money east 
German respondents claim to have at their disposal at the end of 
the month after paying all their living expenses is rising from 
one year to the next. The financial disparity between 
households in the old laender and households in the new laender 
is rapidly equalizing. Altogether, 58 percent of the 
respondents in the new laender say that their economic situation 
has improved over the past three years. In the old laender, only 
6 percent of the respondents say their situation had improved 
over the past three years, and 32 percent say their situation 
had deteriorated. But that also means that despite the high 
cost of unity, two-thirds of west German respondents have at 
least been able to retain the standard of living they enjoyed in 
1990. In 1986, 12 percent of west German respondents claimed 
they could afford little, in 1990, 7 percent said so, and today 
13 percent are saying so. In the new lander, 20 percent of the 
respondents still say their financial possibilities are limited. 
The proportion of people who say that they can only meet their 
living costs with great difficulty is small, both in the old and 
in the new lander, and hovers between 1 and 2 percent. 
  Now that freedom is here, the present has become more 
demanding and the future more uncertain. Few people were 
prepared for the change in interpersonal relationships that 
occurred with the collapse of the Wall, especially the change to 
the small social relationships that were based on a mutual 
dependence and confidence that can only arise under harsh living 
conditions. Eighty-seven percent of the east German respondents 
said interpersonal relationships have deteriorated since unity. 
Almost every other respondent also finds that the climate in 
workplaces has become colder and more unfriendly than before. 
Many are having trouble with the new, more sober attitude that 
employees have toward their own enterprise, an attitude that has 
virtually displaced the convivial tone that existed in the 
workplaces of the former GDR. Many people still feel unsure and 
not at home in the new system. 
  However, the joy brought by unification has never been taken 
seriously in eastern Germany. Despite all the disillusionment 
and difficulty, 56 percent of the east German population 
consider unity a reason to be joyful. Only 23 percent consider 
it a cause for concern. The advantages of unity are too great, 
the progress in reconstructing the new laender too obvious, and 
the newly won freedom too precious to be able to dampen this 
joy. Pride in what has been achieved is again slowly increasing. 
  The Germans have become despondent over the problems 
connected with restructuring and the economic slump. The 
majority feared that everything was going in the opposite 
direction to the one intended, and would have to be tackled in a 
different way. For two years, bad news about the situation of 
enterprises and growing unemployment figures clouded people's 
views of the visible successes. If in 1991 most people viewed 
the reconstruction in the new laender as a good performance, in 
1992 many were clouded in doubt. But today, pride is growing in 
the east and in the west -- 46 percent of west German 
respondents and 40 percent of east German respondents consider 
the reconstruction in eastern Germany a good effort. Only 33 
percent of respondents disagree. 
  This pride has not yet spread to the whole of Germany. Both 
east and west Germans are upset, thinking that their own 
contribution to the reconstruction of eastern Germany has been 
unfairly assessed. Eighty-one percent of the population in the 
new laender is under the impression that the west has not enough 
respect for their effort, and 69 percent of west Germans think 
that eastern Germany has not afforded suitable recognition to 
their contribution to this great work. But it is just a matter 
of time before pride in the reconstruction of eastern Germany 
joins the Germans again, just like it did during the postwar 
economic miracle.

<F P=106> ["pra"-signed commentary: "German-Turkish Lessons"] </F>
  [Text] Anyone who says A need not say B; he may realize 
that A was wrong. Foreign Minister Klaus Kinkel has probably 
realized that "materiel aid" to Turkey (tanks and ammunition 
from the stocks of the GDR's National People's Army at a value 
of 1.5 billion marks) was a mistake. This mistake cannot be 
rectified, but one can avoid continuing it. This is, in short, 
the contents of yesterday's government statement. 
  Turkey's promise not to use the weapons against the Kurds 
was 
worth little right from the very beginning. Even if it had been 
kept: These deliveries would have enabled the Turks to withdraw 
their own military equipment from other parts of the country and 
to use it in Kurdistan. Thus, German armament aid was not 
"Kurd-neutral" right from the start; by the way, this also 
applies to NATO defense aid to Turkey. Therefore, the Foreign 
Ministry should not try to save itself from the maelstrom of the 
conflict with silly hairsplitting: Photographs from Kurdistan 
do indeed show German tanks, it is admitted now, but the tanks 
are not shown shooting to kill.... As if this mattered! The 
arms deliveries were a mistake -- which, of course, provided 
economic profit: The export was much cheaper than scrapping the 
tanks in Germany. 
  The Federal Government now has a special obligation: It must 
energetically advocate an acceptable minority policy in Turkey: 
The European Union should send a commissioner to the Kurdish 
area, and Turkey must understand that the association 
negotiations depend on concessions in this area.

<F P=106> [Helmut Becker editorial: "Japan's Economic Riddle"] </F>
  [Text] On Wednesday of last week [6 April], Japan's 
central bank governor Mieno ventured an extremely cautious 
optimistic forecast for economic developments. The recession 
may well have bottomed out in the last quarter of 1993, and the 
recession might not get any worse. However, Mieno, whose 
organization has been predicting an upswing for the past three 
years, added an important footnote: One year ago, a friendly 
economic climate was also discernible at the end of March, 
shortly before the end of the fiscal and business year, which 
was mainly the result of the widespread manipulation of the 
balance sheets, and in the months that followed it turned out to 
be a straw fire. Nobody can be certain that this disappointment 
will not be repeated in 1994. The much less reserved Finance 
Minister Fujii also made a statement on the same day. Contrary 
to the usual display of confidence, he described the economy as 
"unstable" and stressed that it is in an "extremely delicate 
state of suspense." 
  The formation of the new government this week will show 
whether these two analyses are still realistic after the 
resignation of Prime Minister Hosokawa, which was announced two 
days after the analyses were presented. A weak government that 
would only be able to act as a caretaker cabinet until new 
elections later this year would cause continued economic 
difficulties in Japan. The big tax reform that can no longer be 
postponed, the trade conflict with the United States, the 
pressure for revaluation of the yen, and the tight budget 
situation and the resulting recourse to the capital market that 
leads to rising interest rates require a strong executive power 
whose formation is extremely questionable this week. If the 
stock market reacts lethargically -- not to speak of a slump -- 
Japan's economy is not likely to grow more in the fiscal year 
that has just started than in the one just concluded and for 
which the government's Economic Planning Agency (EPA) only 
expects a real growth of 0.2 percent after a revision of the 3.3 
percent predicted in the fall. One thing is clear: In 1993/94 
Japan's economic development was the weakest in 20 years. Also, 
there is no doubt that the EPA's predictions for economic growth 
of 2.4 percent for the fiscal year that has just started are no 
longer a basis for discussion after a series of spectacular 
wrong official estimates. 
  Even the four gigantic economic emergency programs adopted 
since September 1992 and involving 45.2 trillion yen (730 
billion German marks) will not trigger a return to the sizable 
growth rates of the second half of the 1980's of which foreign 
observers of the stock market still seem to dream. The result 
of the "delicate state of suspense" is fatal: If individual 
economic indicators suggest a positive development even for only 
a single month, private representations of interests feel the 
need to announce the final turnaround. The tendency to play 
down bad news grows in proportion to the length of the phase of 
downward development, according to the motto that every economic 
cycle must come to an end some time. 
  Whether this would happen before the end of 1994 was very 
questionable even before Hosokawa's resignation. In fact, 
private consumption continues to be overshadowed by growing 
unemployment, stagnating real incomes, rising interest rates -- 
above all, those of mortgages -- the unabated decline in 
investments in the private economy, and -- as opposed to stock 
market expectations -- only moderately rising proceeds of 
enterprises in the current business year. On balance, no 
economic impetus can be expected from the public sector in the 
new fiscal year but rather preparations for a stronger political 
skimming off of surplus purchasing power. Deflation and the 
fiscal consequences of attempts to curb it continue to dominate 
the economic scene and ensure that Japan will not have much 
reason to rejoice this fiscal year. 
  The official estimates of the real-estate price deflation 
for 
1993 published in March went practically unnoticed by the 
foreign public, and their explosive impact on the economy was 
underestimated. This third slump in prices in a row, as a 
result of which real estate prices dropped to one-third of 1988 
levels, corresponds to a loss of over 300 trillion yen (4.8 
trillion German marks) last year. What is even worse: No end 
is in sight to the decline of the value of commercial property 
in view of the sharply increasing rate of unused space, which 
currently stands at 10 percent (at over 30 percent in new 
buildings). If the construction industry suffers a setback this 
year, the economy will lose its driving force of the past four 
years. 
  It goes without saying that the ongoing real estate drama 
will continue to be a problem for the financial industry. 
Despite value adjustments, the deterioration of the credit 
portfolio is reaching dangerous levels that will force the banks 
to abandon recapitalization policies based on the principle of 
joint and several liability if the stock exchange boom does not 
continue. The problems of the financial industry mean that the 
pace at which the the recession is overcome will be painfully 
slow, which also destroys the dreams of a bull market. A solid 
and nearly blind optimism is needed there. If this cannot be 
ensured, the search for the upswing will resume in 12 months 
where it began today.

<F P=106> [Commentary by Josef Joffe: "Brussels Is Taking the Cane"] </F>
  [Text] "What is in a name?" Juliet asked her Romeo, and 
immediately advised him to give up his in order to end the 
conflict between the two families. Greece has demanded the same 
thing from its small neighbor Macedonia [The Former Yugoslav 
Republic of Macedonia--FYROM] for over two years -- and with 
increasing brutality. The name of the country alone is a 
program, Athens laments, because this means that Skopje is 
claiming the part of Macedonia that was allocated to the Greeks 
after the 1912-1913 Balkans war. The Constitution and flag are 
also brimming with revisionism. 
  The European Union [EU] yesterday waved the cane at the 
refractory Greeks. In response to the trade blockade that 
Athens imposed on Skopje on 16 February, the EU Commission 
dragged Greece before the European judge. The EU wants the 
European Court to issue a provisional injunction against Athens: 
The blockade is to be lifted immediately. A formal complaint 
will follow. 
  In European terms, the EU has acted at breathtaking speed, 
with the blockade having been imposed less than two months ago. 
This gives one the feeling that a lot of irritation has 
accumulated in Brussels against welfare-recipient Greece. In 
fact, Greece has been making life difficult for the EU for quite 
some time now. It has systematically tried to counteract 
Brussels' policy directed against Serbia; again and again Greece 
is talked about for sanction-busting. The permanent conflict 
with NATO ally Turkey goes back to the times before the European 
Community was founded. The other 11 members are not very 
pleased with the Greeks for reasons specific to the EU. Be it 
in the Chancellor's Office in Bonn or in the corridors of 
Brussels: The Greeks are accused of "blackmail" behavior. 
Athens systematically delays EU decisions to derive financial 
profit from Brussels. 
  Of course, Macedonia, once a republic at the edge of 
Yugoslavia, is not entirely innocent. Like everywhere else, 
there are nationalist phrase mongers there that Greece can use 
as proof of Macedonia's territorial claims. But Skopje has 
passed two amendments to its Constitution that reject desires 
for territorial claims or interference. In addition, Macedonia 
has offered Greece an agreement on the inviolability of its 
borders -- which was brusquely rejected by Athens. 
  Meanwhile, Macedonia is sliding into economic ruin. Trade 
with Serbia has been disrupted because of the sanctions, and the 
Greek blockade has also cut off the southern border. The GNP 
declined by 15 percent last year. Can the EU punitive action 
against Greece produce any results? If Athens does not yield to 
the provisional injunction, a new proceeding will have to be 
initiated in Luxembourg to legitimize punitive action. 
According to the Maastricht Treaty, the Court of Justice has 
the right to impose financial sanctions on EU members, but the 
provisional injunction will take weeks. Yet, perhaps Athens 
will realize earlier that it is isolated within the EU.

  [Text] The Belgian blue helmets in Rwanda are to be pulled 
out. Foreign Minister Willy Claes announced the decision just 
after the religious ceremony that took place this morning in 
honor of the 10 blue helmets killed in Rwanda. Willy Claes: 
  [Begin recording] [Claes] We have decided once and for all 
to 
withdraw Belgian troops from the UN contingent. We have made 
this decision for two reasons: The first is that, on the basis 
of undeniable facts that are confirmed to us every hour by our 
diplomats and our soldiers in Rwanda, this UN peacekeeping 
mission, as defined in tempore non suspecto by the UN Security 
Council, no longer has any sense; moreover, in spite of the 
presence of the UN force, we did not manage to prevent the 
murder of tens of thousands of people. The second reason is 
that, considering the anti-Belgian climate, whatever his 
excellency the Rwandan ambassador in Brussels might say, there 
is such an anti-Belgian climate, that we cannot take the 
responsibility for asking our soldiers to take extra risks. 
  [Correspondent Jean-Michel Moestart] Can one conclude from 
the Belgian decision that if the UN Security Council were to 
give the green light tonight, our blue helmets would leave 
Rwanda at the same time as the Belgian para-commandos deployed 
for the evacuation operation? 
  [Claes] No, we are not making any link between our Belgian 
blue helmets and the Belgian paras. [end recording]

  [Text] The Belgian blue helmets in Rwanda will soon be 
returning home. The foreign minister announced this morning 
that the 430 men taking part in the UN mission in Rwanda, 
UNAMIR, would in no circumstances stay in Rwanda whatever the UN 
Security Council might decide tonight. The Belgian Government 
feels that the UN mission has become pointless. Jean-Michel 
Moestart reports: 
  [Begin recording] [Claes] This is not a purely selfish 
reaction aimed just at the Belgian blue helmets. We do not 
think that the presence of blue helmets of whatever nationality, 
in the current circumstances, with their current mandate, or 
even with a stronger mandate, has any raison d'etre. 
  [Moestart] Does this mean that we are getting ready to shoot 
the Africans in the back? 
  [Claes] Not at all. We are as concerned as anyone else about 
the plight of the Rwandans, who are, it seems, all in a stadium 
in Kigali or in the [name indistinct] hospital in Kigali. We 
have received a lot of calls in the last 24 hours from people, 
from members of organizations, telling us we should evacuate 
some Rwandan or another. I fully understand that, and I respect 
it, but I would also like to ask all these people how they think 
we can do this, by what means. How many risks can we ask our 
paras to take? At the moment they can only travel in armored 
vehicles. [end recording)

<F P=106> [Unattributed article: "Chamber Agrees With Kosto's List of </F>
`Safe Countries'"] 
  [Excerpts] The Second Chamber has cautiously agreed with 
the implementation of a list of "safe countries" from which the 
Netherlands can, in principle, take in no more asylum-seekers. 
The list corresponds to a list of East European and African 
countries that Germany has been using since August of last year. 
[passage omitted] 
  However, according to Justice State Secretary Kosto, 
asylum-seekers from so-called safe countries will continue to be 
able to seek asylum in spite of the list. To do so, they must 
"immediately" come up with compelling arguments which show that 
they are at risk in their own country. If the Justice Ministry 
does not accept these arguments, then the asylum-seekers can 
lodge an appeal, but they will not be given any assistance 
during this period. "We do not expect asylum-seekers to make 
use of this possibility very often," Kosto said. [passage 
omitted] 
  According to the bill, roughly 5 percent of asylum-seekers 
originate from countries that the Justice Ministry considers 
"safe." [passage omitted] 
  Kosto says that "it is already so that virtually all 
asylum-seekers from `safe' countries are turned away. However, 
the 5 percent of refugees involved are causing an unwanted 
blockage of the capacity to accommodate asylum-seekers." He 
believes there is no ready answer to the question on the precise 
criteria for classifying a country as "safe." [passage omitted]

<F P=106> [Unattributed article: "Lubbers Lashes Out Strongly at </F>
Labor Party"] 
  [Excerpt] [passage omitted] Prime Minister Lubbers said 
that the Social Democrats want to make too few savings, which 
means that unemployment will not drop sufficiently. "It is a 
shame that the Labor Party (PvdA) wants too few savings, because 
by acting in such a way, it is setting back employment in 
advance," he said. The prime minister also believes that the 
PvdA is hindering the necessary reform of social security. "All 
political parties see the need to tackle the Pensions Act and 
Health Law. Moreover, it is mentioned in the conclusions of the 
parliamentary committee of inquiry that looked into the question 
of social security. Only the PvdA is refusing to go along with 
this." Yesterday evening, Lubbers said he was extremely 
concerned about the developments in the PvdA: "We must avoid 
abandoning the steady course steered in recent years and taking 
a turn to the left. Doing so would mean wiping out the good 
results of all our achievements over the past few years." 
  Yesterday, the PvdA did not respond to Lubbers' criticism. 
  The prime minister was noticeably friendly toward D66 
[Democrats 66]. He believes that the CDA [Christian Democratic 
Appeal] has "most in common" with that party in the area of 
socioeconomic policy. The VVD [People's Party for Freedom and 
Democracy] could also count on glowing words from Lubbers. The 
VVD election platform contains "many good elements," he said, 
even if making a 10 percent reduction in social benefits is 
taking things too far in his opinion. 
  It is also notable that one of Lubbers's party colleagues, 
Foreign Minister Peter Hendrik Kooijmans, is much more positive 
about the PvdA and its leading candidate Wim Kok. This week in 
VRIJ NEDERLAND, Kooijmans says that the CDA must recognize that 
after the elections the PvdA will be the largest party, with Kok 
becoming prime minister. The minister believes that his party 
should not hesitate to join a cabinet that is under the 
leadership of a PvdA prime minister.

importance. 
  "He praised the new parliament's role as direct 
representatives of the citizens" and emphasized that Italy "will 
be able to be different and better, and that the differences 
will not provide fuel for divisions," but "the right kind of 
constructive spirit." 
  Rome RAI Televideo Teletext in Italian at 0906 GMT on 15

opened the inaugural session of the Senate's 12th legislature. 
De Martino reminded the Senate of the values of the Resistance 
and added `Tragic divisions should now become a reminder of our 
sad past.' This part of his speech was accompanied by grumbling 
noises from where the Right was seated. He said: `It is not my 
job to express political judgements about the outcome of the 
vote,' but `I hope that in seeking out the new, our republican 
history is preserved,' and the unity of Italy, above all."

<F P=106> [Telephone interview with Hanan 'Ashrawi by unidentified </F>
correspondent in Rome; date not given: "Green Light for Italian 
Observers in Hebron" -- first two paragraphs are LA REPUBBLICA 
introduction] 
  [Text] Rome -- The cabinet yesterday approved an executive 
order concerning Italy's participation in the peace mission to 
Hebron on the West Bank. Italy will send 35 soldiers to the 
town as observers. 
  Speaking over the phone, Doctor Hanan 'Ashrawi, a lecturer 
at 
the Palestinian University of Bir-Zeit [as published], known to 
the general public as the spokesperson for the PLO delegation in 
the peace negotiations and currently committed to defending 
human rights, was skeptical about the role and effectiveness of 
the 100 or so Norwegian, Danish, and Italian observers who, 
unarmed, will safeguard the rights of Palestinians in Hebron for 
the next three months. The PLO asked for these observers to be 
sent in the wake of Hebron mosque massacre on 25 February, when 
30 Palestinians were killed. 
  [Correspondent] How do you view the arrival in Hebron of the 
foreign observers? 
  ['Ashrawi] Their presence is purely symbolic and formal. 
Operationally, they serve no purpose. They are few in number 
and their role is limited. They cannot monitor all the places 
where there is a potential for flare-ups between Palestinians, 
Jewish settlers, and the army. Besides, it is a partial 
solution given that similar conflicts exist in the rest of the 
occupied territories. 
  [Correspondent] What is the Palestinian reaction to the 
suicide attacks carried out by Hamas? Do you fear for the peace 
process? 
  ['Ashrawi] Clearly, the peace process is resting on a knife 
edge after these attacks. We, the Palestinians, are a people 
who are aware of reality and the political side of things. We 
condemn the killing of innocent people, but the Israeli deaths 
are set against the general background of the violence that is 
taking hold in the occupied territories. The Israeli victims 
must be viewed in the context of attacks and reprisals that have 
also led to dozens of deaths among the Palestinians. They are 
also a consequence of the slowdown in negotiations which, on the 
contrary, must be accelerated if we are to achieve autonomy. 
  [Correspondent] What do the majority of Palestinians think 
of 
Hamas? Do you think that public support for the PLO and its 
leader, Yasir 'Arafat, is waning? 
  ['Ashrawi] You would have to carry out an opinion poll. My 
personal impression is that the credibility of the PLO and 
'Arafat's prestige have been eroded, and similarly I believe 
that people are losing confidence in the peace process.

<F P=106> [Interview with Forza Italia President Silvio Berlusconi by </F>
Bruno Vespa in Rome on 13 April: "`Scalfari Counts for Nothing; 
He Is Missing an O'" -- first five paragraphs are L'INFORMAZIONE 
introduction -- all quotation marks as published] 
  [Text] Rome -- I want a government that legislates, and we 
are going to have to work hard for five years. That is the 
concept Silvio Berlusconi hammers home in the interview granted 
to our newspaper. 
  For the first time since his election victory, the Knight 
[Berlusconi nickname] responds to the attacks of LA REPUBBLICA 
editor Eugenio Scalfari: He needs an "o" to start drawing up 
lists of ministers [reference to virtual homonym with head of 
state Oscar Luigi Scalfaro], he said. "I want Marco Panella, 
[Pannella Reformers' List leader] in the government." 
  "By the time they told me, the problem was already resolved. 
It is better that way. With so many institutional problems 
still unresolved...." Silvio Berlusconi smiled when I asked him 
to comment on the mass resignation first handed in then 
withdrawn by the three directors of the Fininvest TV news 
programs, Mentana, Fede, and Liguori, following an interview 
granted to LA STAMPA by the group's managing director, Mr. 
Franco Tato, in which he accused them of being a source of 
expense and trouble. In all probability, Berlusconi seems 
likely to have been informed immediately after emerging from his 
talks with President Scalfaro. I tried to probe further, 
saying: "That interview perfectly represents Tato: his 
character, his fiery nature, and also his good faith." 
Berlusconi smiled but refused to bite. The case is closed and 
he has other things on his mind. 
  It was dusk on a gray day. The blinds let very little light 
into the drawing rooms of the Berlusconi residence near Rome's 
Piazza Navona. In the larger of the rooms, two white sofas and 
a chimney breast framed a broad table groaning under neat piles 
of books, candy, and Forza Italia brochures. A few 18th century 
hunting scenes adorned the walls. Next to the windows, a nice 
photo of his wife, Veronica Lario, rested on a shelf. 
  "There is just one of me, guys, just one," he said, closing 
the door in the face of his elegant footmen, spokesman Antonio 
Tajano and personal assistant Niccolo Querci, who would like him 
to be all over the place at once. But at this juncture the 
Knight has three important things on his mind: the designation 
of the speakers for the two houses of parliament ("Who knows, we 
might just succeed in throwing off the shackles of narrow 
vision...?"); the probable assignation to him of the mandate to 
form a government; and his parliamentary debut. 
  [Vespa] When was the last time you stepped inside 
Montecitorio [parliament]? What impression did it make on you? 
  [Berlusconi] I recall a fine, austere building, something 
halfway between a national legend and the best show in the 
capital. 
  [Vespa] Are you moved in any way by returning there as a 
member of parliament or the winning leader? Or is Montecitorio 
a palace just like any other, for a rich man? 
  [Berlusconi] To represent the electorate is certainly a 
moving experience, almost like the first day at school. But my 
true riches, at any rate, are that I am still just a guy like 
every one else. My responsibilities may be greater, but my 
feelings are the same as those of the common people. 
  [Vespa] The outgoing parliamentary speakers are Napolitano 
and Spadolini. Whether people like them or not, they are first 
class politicians. Will the new majority provide alternatives 
of an acceptable standard? 
  [Berlusconi] Where the speakers are concerned, I am looking 
for a solid balance between renewal and republican solidity. I 
believe in government by the majority, leaving the opposition 
free and untarnished by any clubby temptations; but for that 
reason, precisely because I wish to implement this change at all 
levels, it is right that certain elements of institutional 
safeguard should stay in place. Naturally, all this within the 
framework of the direction expressed by the coalition which, in 
its entirety, won the elections. 
  [Vespa] If Scalfaro were to ask you to form the government, 
how many days would it take you to accept [sciogliere la 
riserva]? 
  [Berlusconi] As many days as it takes to put together a good 
program and a good team. 
  [Vespa] If you form the government, will Pannella be part of 
it? 
  [Berlusconi] As far as I am concerned, yes, I hope so. 
  [Vespa] On that topic: Can you guarantee that the new team 
will be an improvement on the outgoing one? 
  [Berlusconi] I must say, the dance going on right now is 
highly comical. The very people who as good as smashed the old 
ruling class and caused the old parliament to lose its 
legitimacy are now falling over themselves to describe the "new" 
guys as inexpert, unfit, and not up to the job. I guarantee 
that we can do better than in the past with all the men of the 
present. 
  [Vespa] On that subject, Scalfari on Sunday said that you 
cannot be prime minister. Too many interests. You got your 
lawyer, Dr. Dotti, also elected under the Forza Italia flag, to 
answer him. I get the feeling you are not too worried. 
  [Berlusconi] Scalfari needs an "o" on the end of his name to 
decide who is going to form the next government. 
  [Vespa] [Fininvest President] Confalonieri claims that a 
group with revenue of 12 trillion lire and a staff of 40,000 
cannot be sold off in a short time. One got the feeling he was 
trying to reassure the people in the firm as much as anything 
else. 
  [Berlsuconi] Confalonieri is fulfilling his role as a great 
manager; I will fulfill mine, which is quite different. Nobody 
with any sense, whatever his job, can doubt for one moment that 
Fininvest is not a two-bit company to sell off to the highest 
bidder just to keep the ivory tower mystifiers happy. We are 
talking about tens of thousands of jobs, an asset, an ethos, and 
an entrepreneurial tradition which belong to the country. 
  [Vespa] Who will do the negotiating to decide how many 
networks Fininvest should have and how many the RAI [Italian 
State Broadcasting Corporation] should have? Will you succeed 
in turning it into a personal matter [as published]? 
  [Berlusconi] Of course I will. I have already explained how. 
By separating my political role from my assets in the clearest 
possible way, and by imbuing all decisions with the greatest 
transparency, under the collective control of the government and 
parliament. 
  [Vespa] [Northern League Secretary] Bossi has said that he 
will agree to you becoming premier only if you present yourelf 
"naked," in other words after divesting yourself of your strong 
interests. 
  [Berlusconi] Bossi wants me to catch a nasty cold. I 
presented myself to the electorate with my clothes on, by no 
means in the nude, and it put its trust in me. But the problem 
does exist. We are examining it, and only those in bad faith 
can deny a priori that, without any legal obligation to do so, I 
began to practice the distinction of roles the moment I resigned 
all my duties with Finivest. The rest will follow shortly, but 
compatibly with the problems of a group with a 12 trillion lire 
in revenue and a staff of 40,000. 
  [Vespa] The other problem is federalism. If no concrete 
results are forthcoming within six months, your League ally has 
threatened to leave you in the lurch. What can be done in such 
a short time? 
  [Berlusconi] Under the old system in six months you set up a 
comittee, with its good old chairman and his good old staff, and 
got through about 1,000 working lunches. I hope that under the 
new system six months will be enough for the work of any 
committee to be concluded, whatever the topic, and a vote to be 
taken on the results. Yes, yes, no, no: just like it says in 
the Gospel. 
  [Vespa] What solution are you most convinced by? Greater 
powers to the present regional authorities, eight or 10 
macroregions, [League ideologue] Miglio's three Italies? 
  [Berlusconi] Federalism is not a topographical problem. The 
first republic was based on the distribution of power through 
centralized parties. In the future the distribution of weights 
and balances, starting with tax questions, will have to rest on 
the institutions of territorial self-government. 
  [Vespa] The oppositions claim that parliament alone has no 
right to implement reforms of this nature. Do you envisage 
resorting to a referendum? If so, when? 
  [Berlusconi] Parliament has every right to do what the 
Constitution allows. The will of the people is exercized 
through parliament within the framework of a Constitution which 
provides the conditions for its own modification. Added to 
which, in the case of sweeping changes, there is the tool of a 
referendum. 
  [Vespa] You said: We will set up a centrist government. 
[National Alliance Coordinator] Fini objected: It will be a 
center-right government. 
  [Berlusconi] Those are moldy old definitions with which I do 
not identify. I hope we will put together a good government on 
the basis of a majority which, in old-style geopolitical terms, 
is center-right, but with criteria and a program which also 
belong to other ethical and moral traditions. Is broadening 
civil rights a left-wing, right-wing, or centrist aim? Is 
increasing the work done by voluntary organizations left wing, 
right wing, or centrist? Are privatizing great lumbering 
concerns badly run by the old nomenklatura, or keeping the power 
to set rules applicable to the entire market in the hands of the 
public sector left-wing, right-wing, or centrist acts? 
  [Vespa] Have you closed the door in the faces of the Popular 
Party [PPI] and the Segni Pact members? Have you spoken with 
Segni, [former PPI Secretary] Martinazzoli, [PPI Chairwoman] 
Jervolino, [PPI members] Formigoni, or Buttiglione since the 
elections? 
  [Berlusconi] I talk with a lot of people, and I always 
welcome the advice and criticism of those in good faith. For 
everyone today is a time to distinguish between the roles of 
those who are going to govern and those who are going into 
opposition, but imbued with the spirit of cooperation and with 
our doors open to whoever shares our values and our program. 
  [Vespa] You have been invited to take part in the 25 April 
[Liberation Day] antifascist march. Will you go? 
  [Berlusconi] Ideally I will be attending all those 
celebrations, which I hope will be a mark of reconciliation. 
  [Vespa] Is there any danger that Liberation Day will not be 
a 
calm holiday, despite the head of state's appeal? What is your 
position? 
  [Berlusconi] I see no reason why we should await 25 April in 
such a doom-laden atmosphere. I would like to hope that this 
thirst for revenge is quenched in time. I repeat, it was not 
antifascism which lost the elections, it was the left-wing 
cartel. It would be as well not to get mixed up between the 
principles, which are everybody's, and the programs for the 
political struggle, which are partisan. Even [left-wing 
philosopher] Vittorio Foa made that clear. 
  [Vespa] Unemployment is uppermost in people's minds right 
now. The day after the elections you told me: "I am already 
working on the economic program," and you reiterated your 
promise of one million jobs. Have you pursued that path any 
further? 
  [Berlusconi] Of course. We are working to turn our election 
program into parliamentary and governmental initiatives. 
  [Vespa] The Ciampi government has taken the credit for 
getting the recovery started. Was it right to do so? 
  [Berlsuconi] Ciampi did what he could. He had neither a 
majority nor a true opposition. Added to that, some cross-party 
centers of power attempted, sometimes brutally, to influence his 
government's actions. 
  [Vespa] How long will the next government last? Is it true 
that the next legislative term is going to be transitional? 
  [Berlusconi] Five years of hard work, then the balance sheet 
and the verdict of the electorate. That is the aim I hold most 
dear and which I think the Italians deserve after the storms and 
turbulence of the past few years. The stock market is giving us 
encouraging signs in that direction. 
  [Vespa] Is it true that at this juncture your mind is 
totally 
devoted to politics? Will you ever go back to being a 
businessman? 
  [Berlusconi] The only interests that concern me at the 
moment 
are my country's. 
  It was late when Berlusconi walked me to the elevator. "By 
the way, how are things with [Forza Italia deputy] Ms. Parenti?" 
The Knight answered with a smile. 
  Downstairs, in Via dell'Anima, there was a small crowd of 
journalists waiting for the Knight. One of them cried out 
jokingly: "Did you go up to discuss taking over from Mentana as 
director of TG5 [TV news program]?" I answered: "He withdrew 
his resignation before I had time. Anyway, as you can see, I am 
not wearing a blue blazer, the standard Finivest uniform...."

<F P=106> [Unattributed report on a press conference by Prime Minister </F>
Carlo Azeglio Ciampi in Rome; date not given: "Ciampi: `We Need 
a Constituent Assembly'"] 
  [Text] Rome -- "If a new constitution is to be drafted, 
then we need a constituent assembly. However, this has not yet 
been decided." Thus Prime Minister Carlo Azeglio Ciampi 
answered a question from foreign journalists on the subject of 
constitutional reform, during a press conference at Palazzo 
Chigi [government seat]. "To my knowledge, no specific 
initiative has been taken in this direction," Ciampi added. 
  "In this case, we would need a constituent assembly," he 
repeated, "like the one after World War II. During the 
constituent phase, if I recall correctly, the government also 
had legislative powers, because there was no parliament, only a 
constituent assembly." 
  "If, however, it is only a question of amending the existing 
Constitution," Ciampi further explained, "the procedures are 
very clear. During the previous legislature, a bicameral 
commission was formed. This could be done again or, 
alternatively, we could follow the procedure laid down in the 
Constitution, which provides for certain steps to be taken." 
  In Ciampi's view, changing the Constitution will be more 
parliament's than the government's responsibility. As regards a 
possible reform to introduce federalism, the prime minister 
said: "It is not up to me to make proposals concerning the 
contents of possible constitutional amendments. We must wait 
and see whether the next government will include this type of 
issue in its platform, or whether it will prefer to leave the 
initiative to parliament." 
  Gianfranco Rotondi, PPI [Italian Popular Party] Deputy, was 
also proposing to set up a constituent body. In his view, "the 
only feasible way to introduce very substantial amendments to 
the Constitution, such as redrafting the constitutional chart's 
second part in its entirety, is to set up an ad hoc body 
invested with specific constituent powers, whereas the very 
scope of the reform process objectively rules out the 
possibility of resorting to the constitutional reform instrument 
provided for by Article 138." 
  "Deputy Gianfranco Rotondi's proposal," a PPI circular 
explained, "posits setting up an assembly in order to tackle the 
constitutional reform. According to the proposal, the election 
of such a constituent assembly would be carried out on a clearly 
proprortional basis, in such a way as to represent all the 
political forces in the field, thus ensuring that the new forms 
of state and government reflect the composition of the country's 
social and political fabric as faithfully as possible."

<F P=106> [Marco Panara report: "Knight Plans Single Round System To </F>
Beat League"] 
  [Text] [Forza Italia leader] Silvio Berlusconi's 
unexpected conversion from a two-round uninominal electoral 
system to a single-round uninominal system has been welcomed 
only by the Northern League, i.e. the party likely to suffer the 
most if this formula is adopted, whereas the others, friends and 
political adversaries alike, are, if anything, astonished. 
  Astonished but sticking to his guns is Giuliano Urbani, one 
of Berlusconi's closest advisors as well as the architect of the 
Forza Italia program on the institutions. "Berlusconi has 
changed his mind," said Urbani, "he has opted for the 
single-round system. I have not; I remain in favor of a 
two-round system as indicated in the Forza Italia program." 
  Domenico Fisichella, the political expert elected in the 
ranks of the National Alliance [AN], is puzzled and also sticks 
to his original choice, namely a two-round uninominal system. 
The Popular Party is certainly not sparing its criticism, nor 
is the PDS [Democratic Party of the Left], which is sticking 
very firmly to the two-round system. 
  But far from revolving around which system to choose, the 
talk is about the Forza Italia leader's conversion. The most 
widespread opinion is that it is a tactical decision, a way for 
him to free himself from the troublesome accord with the League. 
The postelection polls show Forza Italia on the rise and the 
League in decline, and if this trend turns out to be a strong, 
long-term one, Forza Italia could sweep the League away with the 
uninominal, single-round system. Some point out that this way 
of looking at things is typical of a party with a relative 
majority, the same way of thinking practised by the Christian 
Democratic Party last summer. 
  Except the League is not making any noise. Umberto Bossi's 
[Northern League leader] party has always been firmly in favor 
of a straightforward single-round uninominal system (i.e. 
without any proportional representation). The reason why Bossi 
and his party are so in favor of this solution is explained by 
Domenico Fisichella. "A single-round, uninominal electoral 
system," AN's political expert said, "requires a specific kind 
of party setup if it is to lead to a two-party situation, 
otherwise fragmentation becomes more accentuated. For example, 
if there were 10 parties in a single territorial area in Italy, 
a single-round system would result in a very fragmented 
parliament. If the League is deeply rooted in one area of the 
country, nobody could unseat it with a single round of 
elections." 
  Since this is how things stand, one is led to believe that 
by 
opting for the single round at this time Berlusconi considers 
that the League's roots are being fast eroded and that the Right 
in its entirety could maximize its parliamentary representation 
to the detriment of the opposition parties. 
  Fisichella's reasoning, on the other hand, is that of a 
scholar: "A single-round uninominal system is a drastic choice; 
it gives good results only if the party system is such that it 
can promote a rapid change to a two-party system. On the other 
hand, a two-round electoral system tends toward bipolarity, 
which is different from a two-party system, and nobody can swear 
that the former may not be better for Italy than the latter. 
The blend between the party system and the electoral system is 
like a chemical compound: If both components are suited to each 
other the desired result is obtained, otherwise there is an 
explosion." 
  As for AN's electoral interests and the risk of being 
absorbed by Forza Italia if a single-round system is adopted, 
Professor Fisichella weighs his words: "It is not only a matter 
of numbers," he said, "but also of organization. We must see 
what sort of party structure Forza Italia adopts and what its 
relationship with the citizens will be."

  [Text] During his first official visit to Spain, UN 
Secretary General Butrus-Ghali discussed the situation and 
today's developments in Bosnia. During his meeting with Spanish 
Foreign Minister Javier Solana and in the news conference held 
after the meeting, Butrus-Ghali said he does not have any 
regrets about it and that he will again request NATO air strikes 
in the former Yugoslav republic if the circumstances warrant it, 
as they seem to now. Over to our correspondent, Maria Jesus 
Castejon. 
  [Castejon] Today in Madrid the UN secretary general will 
start diplomatic moves to stop the serious deterioration of the 
situation in Bosnia-Herzegovina. 
  When asked about Russia's criticism of NATO air strikes in 
the Muslim enclave of Gorazde, Butrus-Ghali recalled that 
Moscow, as well as the other members of the [Security] Council, 
approved the use of force to defend the peacekeeping troops. 
  Ghali stressed that that kind of action will be repeated if 
need be. 
  [Begin Butrus-Ghali recording in English fading to Spanish 
translation] I want to confirm that we will not hesitate to ask 
for NATO air support as long as we have this mandate from the 
[UN Security] Council and as long as we believe that this could 
help the search for peace in former Yugoslavia. [end recording] 
  [Castejon] The UN secretary general informed the Security 
Council about the bloody conflict in the central African country 
of Rwanda. 
  Foreign Minister Javier Solana was very pessimistic, because 
he fears an escalation of the bloodbath over the next few hours. 
  [Begin Solana recording] Consider for a moment that in a 
very 
few hours, very few hours, hundreds of thousands of deaths took 
place, hundreds of thousands of deaths, which means something 
absolutely terrible for any conscience of the least, the very 
least sensibility. [end recording] 
  [Castejon] Solana said our country does not plan to send 
blue 
helmets to Rwanda. It is waiting for the Security Council to 
decide what to do with the 400 blue helmets already deployed, or 
whether it will send another peacekeeping force.

  [Text] An Iranian Central Bank delegation, currently in 
Spain to hold negotiations with Spanish financial authorities 
and that country's official insurance company, after a few days 
of discussions has managed to sign a long-term monetary 
agreement with that country. 
  On the basis of this agreement, delayed debts by Iranian 
government and private establishments and the country's 
importers will be paid back to their Spanish trade partners by 
receiving a long-term credit. 
  Also, it has been agreed that all credit for the year 1373 
[began 21 March 1994], the payments of which are due within the 
next few months, will be paid by the same credit on time and 
when they are due. 
  The credit is estimated as over $150 million which covers 
all 
purchases covered by the Spanish official insurance. 
  The Central Bank also informed importers that not only their 
delayed debts will be paid back, but their letters of credit for 
1373 will also be paid on time. 
  According to a Central News Unit report, an expert 
delegation 
from the Central Bank, currently in Germany to hold expert 
negotiations on the repayment of the letters of credit provided 
by the Hermes insurance company, this evening succeeded signing 
an agreement for the repayment of letters of credit provided by 
the Hermes insurance company. 
  On the basis of that agreement, the two sides have agreed on 
a time for the the paying back of letters of credit which have 
been insured by Hermes. It is worth mentioning that the sum of 
the credit agreement signed with Germany is more than $2.7 
billion dollars.

  [Text] Spain has just made public its position on 
ratification of the GATT world trade liberalization agreement. 
We will now hear from our special correspondent in Marrakech, 
Jose Luis Garcia Sanchez. Good afternoon. 
  [Garcia Sanchez] Hello, good afternoon. The Spanish 
administration is convinced that the signing in Marrakech will 
give a new impulse to world economic growth and to the wellbeing 
of all countries. 
  State Secretary for Trade Apolonio Ruiz Ligero was in charge 
of reading the Spanish position which highlights the need for 
the new world trade body to study the social rights of workers 
in developing countries. 
  Spain believes that forced labor, the lack of trade union 
legislation, and general wages agreements which fail to protect 
third world workers should be condemned. Furthermore, Ruiz 
Ligero says that the signing of the Uruguay Round will favor 
Spain in the long-term, it will not hurt our agriculture, and he 
calls upon Spanish businessmen to test their ability to compete 
in the world marketplace as well as at home.

<F P=106> [Article by Iver Hoj: "A Fishing Nation Goes Ashore"] </F>
  [Text] The people of the Faeroes are disillusioned, 
powerless, indebted, and poor. The islands' worst crisis is 
still unfolding. People are fleeing to Denmark. The vital 
trawler fleet has been on strike for a week over compulsory 
fishing quotas that will gradually strangle the industry. But 
everyone knows who is responsible for the crisis. They are. 
  Torshavn--As always the weather on the Faeroes is unsettled, 
but the mood is stable, below the freezing point. 
  For over a week the Faeroese trawler fleet has remained in 
port--in anger over a new fishing quota system that could lead 
to the scrapping of many trawlers in the near future. 
  It was not until Friday night [11 March] that the Faeroese 
government presented a proposal that could get the fishermen 
moving. The quotas will be retained, but the Faeroes will 
purchase the right to catch another 5,000 tons in the Russian 
zone of the Barents Sea. 
  The vital trawlers are the first link in the Faeroes' food 
chain. Fish make up 98 percent of island exports and the 44 
trawlers account for 80 percent of the total catch. But the 
people of the Faeroes are so used to misery and catastrophe that 
they have scarcely reacted to the paralysis of the industry that 
must pump life into the entire island community. 
  Some 1,000 workers at fish fillet factories have already 
been 
fired or will be in the coming week and the painful effects will 
spread to every corner of the wind-swept islands until more fish 
are brought ashore. 
  "I think the Faeroese and Danish governments forget they are 
dealing with human beings. What is happening just now is simply 
an enormous catastrophe," said the leader of the strike, Emil 
Nolsoe, chairman of the trawler owners' organization and a 
skipper from Sando with a steely glint in his eyes. 
  The depression of ordinary islanders approaches apathy at 
times in the midst of the Faeroes' worst economic crisis. It is 
hard to see the light at the end of the tunnel. The people of 
the Faeroes do not like their new daily life. 
<H5>  Shock Therapy </H5>
  After the over-consumption and unrestrained deficit spending 
of the 1980's when every town had to have its nursing home and 
its soccer field with artificial turf, the bill must now be paid. 
  And Denmark is very popular in the Faeroes these days. Not 
only do the islands receive a billion kroner a year in subsidies 
from Copenhagen, the Danish Government has rescued the 
foundering banks--and recently Prime Minister Poul Nyrup 
Rasmussen agreed to lend the Faeroes 3 billion kroner so the 
islands could eliminate expensive old loans. The conditions were 
the fishing quotas and an end to wage guarantees for the highly 
paid fishermen. 
  The foreign debt amounts to almost 8 billion kroner and 
although the Danish Government has come to the rescue and 
suspended payments, an expensive 500 million kroner a year in 
interest must be paid. 
  The natural catastrophe of fewer fish in the sea--and the 
fall of the Berlin wall which opened the door for cheap Russian 
fish--have been a hard blow. 
  The result is 5,000 people unemployed out of a labor force 
of 
21,000. The strike is temporarily sending 1,000 more off the 
job. A little under 1,000 people are not covered by unemployment 
funds and live on public assistance. The crisis has meant a wage 
decline of 10-15 percent. At the same time taxes have risen 
explosively. Before the first of the year the islanders were 
paying 10 percent more in taxes than Danes do. After 1 January 
municipal taxes rose 6-7 percent. An ordinary wage earner pays a 
good 60 percent in taxes--without deductions. In addition there 
is a high oil tax and a value-added tax. An unemployed person 
receives only two-thirds of a skilled worker's pay and the 
support is close to the absolute subsistence level. 
  "We are well aware that we have only ourselves to thank for 
our situation," the islanders all say. 
  But they do not believe they will ever be able to pay off 
the 
debt. Denmark will be stuck with it--sooner or later. For if 
unemployment rises further and taxes do not decline, emigration 
from the islands to Denmark will accelerate. Neither Denmark nor 
the Faeroes can live with that in the long run. 
  In 1993, 2,700 people left the Faeroes and only 900 returned 
home. It is people between the ages of 30 and 40 who go to 
Denmark to get work and more money. The population figure has 
dropped suddenly from 47,000 to 45,000 and everyone believes the 
outward flow will continue. 
  "It is an open artery that is draining energy and the future 
from society. It is the people who ought to get everything going 
again who are leaving. But the question is whether there is room 
for that many people here. Whether we have to get down to a 
population of 25-30,000 to find a natural level," said Aksel 
Hansen, the grand old man of fishing in the Faeroes. 
  The 70 year old Hansen is one of those who have been hardest 
hit. In the fall his fish factory in Torshavn harbor would have 
celebrated its 40th anniversary. But one month before the big 
day the bank rejected a debt reorganization plan and he lost the 
factory. 
  Now he has five trawlers but he is still debt-ridden. 
  "Things began going wrong for the Faeroes in the 1970's. 
Grants were given for ships and fish factories in every single 
town and it was quite obvious that it was too much. But things 
went well through the 1980's when fishing was good. At our 
factory we used the money to improve production and we were also 
hit when the crisis came," he said. 
<H5>  Politicians Detested </H5>
  The trawler owners' confrontation with the politicians of 
the 
Faeroes has been reinforced by a total distrust of the elected 
representatives. 
  "Our politicians are no good," Hansen said bluntly. And a 
similar refrain is heard everywhere from people high and low. 
  But the anger with the island government fell on deaf ears 
despite the fact that the strike will probably cost Faeroese 
unemployment funds 50 million kroner. Just after the strike 
began a 14-man delegation headed by Prime Minister Marita 
Petersen (Social Democrat) journeyed to Stockholm on a visit to 
the Nordic Council. And she did not return until Thursday [10 
March], when she rejected the fishermen's demands. The law on 
limiting catches goes into effect tomorrow. 
  The debt-ridden Faeroese trawler fleet considers the quotas 
unreasonable. Especially as it will not be possible to let the 
healthiest ships buy quotas from those in poor shape so they can 
quit. 
  "The whole quota system is set up so unrealistically that it 
makes it impossible to make a living. The law has sidestepped 
the heart of the matter. If the government thinks some ships 
should be eliminated it is wrong to kill all of them slowly in 
order to weed some out," said Nolsoe. He feels a deep distrust 
of the marine biologists who said in 1987 that if a third of the 
87 trawlers then in existence disappeared the fleet would have 
an ideal composition. 
  Now there are 44 left and the biologists are saying again 
that the fleet should be cut in half. 
  "The fish are there. The supply of haddock and cod is on the 
way up. We agreed earlier to protect big areas and use larger 
meshes, but we do not believe quotas will help increase the fish 
population. I think the Danish Government has acted too hastily 
and listened to the wrong people. Poul Nyrup Rasmussen is being 
penny-wise and pound-foolish," Nolsoe said. 
  At Tinganes, where the government can be found (at least 
after its return on Friday) Prime Minister Petersen is well 
aware that she occasionally makes unpopular decisions: 
  "Everyone is to blame for what has happened. But the 
politicians have the biggest responsibility. We should have had 
a different fishing policy, a different housing policy and 
different rules on taxing interest long ago to avoid acquiring 
this huge debt. But I can look the voters in the eye and say: We 
have tackled the problems that exist and have gone against the 
tide. We stand by what we do." 
  It is an election year and she is considerably more 
optimistic about the future than people on the street and in the 
business sector. 
  According to the local government's projections the public 
debt of 6.3 billion kroner will not rise during the next five 
years. On the other hand plans call for doing away with private 
foreign debt in 1998. And at that time things may well move 
forward again--by virtue of strong growth in the fish supply. 
  "It will be tough to get through this. Especially because 
people here have enjoyed constant progress for 30 years. This 
has created a way of life that is hard to give up. So now people 
are disillusioned and can only see the negative side. Things are 
not that bad. Some 70 percent of the people are doing quite 
well." 
  Like most people she regards foreign debt as the biggest 
problem. But while others hope the debt to Denmark will be 
canceled because the catastrophe can be limited that way, the 
prime minister of the Faeroes does not plan to entreat Denmark 
to cancel the outstanding amount: 
  "If we are to have any hope of regaining our credibility and 
our credit rating abroad it is decisive not to have our debt 
canceled. Five years from now things may well be moving in the 
right direction again." 
  But when will she come to Copenhagen next with her hat in 
her 
hand? 
  "I cannot answer that."

<F P=106> [Report on interview with President Martti Ahtisaari by Kaa </F>
Eneberg and Anders Mellbourn in Helsinki; no date given] 
  [Text] Helsinki -- Martti Ahtisaari does not intend to 
stand on the sidelines watching during the Finnish referendum 
campaign on the EU [European Union]. Using all the power of his 
presidential office he will work for a "yes" to membership. He 
expects to travel to South Africa before visiting Finland's 
gigantic neighbor, Russia. 
  Much will be different with former UN official and diplomat 
Martti Ahtisaari as the Republic of Finland's tenth president. 
But not in the sense that as a result of the presidency's 
presently more limited powers he will content himself with the 
presidential role of only representing Finland. 
  On the contrary, he exudes a desire to work and a very 
conscious desire to influence policy and the development of 
society when he met DAGENS NYHETER for his first newspaper 
interview since he entered office a little over a month ago. 
  He had already acquired a new authority in his behavior when 
he received us in the Yellow Salon in the presidential palace by 
the harbor in Helsinki. He has not opted for a solemn approach, 
but it is already natural to address him using the formal form 
for "you." 
  The 56 year old Ahtisaari still moves slowly, but has lost 
13 
kilograms since the election campaign and he joked about being 
overweight and about the impression he sometimes gives of being 
a little indolent and absent-minded: 
  "You forget that I use my resources as and when they are 
needed. I am probably not oblivious of tactics either and know 
about the need for timing with international diplomacy. 
  ``I too am in favor of more power for the Eduskunta. It is 
natural for the political elite to want to strengthen the 
Eduskunta. But at the same time there is a firm call from the 
people for strong presidential powers,'' he said, clearly 
approving and stressing that he has never been a political 
innocent. 
  Despite the fact that the presidency stands above party 
politics, he referred as a matter of course to the Social 
Democrats as his party. During his first weeks as president he 
has built up his own staff of aides, often with UN experience, 
and set in motion regular discussions with the parties. When we 
met him he had just had a visit from the National Coalition 
Party. 
  During the election campaign his criticism of the 
government's economic policy gave rise to questions because 
domestic policy does not lie within the president's area of 
competence. He explained his criticism by saying that it was 
necessary in order to distinguish him from his opponent, 
Elisabeth Rehn, in the final round, but said, not without some 
satisfaction, that the government is currently preparing tax 
cuts to stimulate the economy. He is happy with the favorable 
push from his predecessor, Mauno Koivisto, who has predicted 
that there will be "a better Finland" than today's Finland with 
its half a million unemployed when Ahtisaari's term of office 
expires in six years' time. 
  "Of course the question then is whether I will be able to 
take the credit for this," he added. 
  Martti Ahtisaari wants to lead Finland into the EU and wants 
Finland to be the first of the Nordic applicant nations to hold 
its referendum -- by early October at the latest: 
  "I have nothing against Finland showing a little leadership. 
  ``My election campaign was something of a lecture tour about 
the EU for which I should almost have received payment. I will 
undoubtedly speak out warmly in favor of membership during the 
referendum campaign.'' 
  He believes in a special Nordic responsibility and 
involvement in the EU and wants to develop Nordic cooperation on 
the basis of the patterns which already exist today in the 
United Nations where the Nordic area is most often seen as a 
unit. He stressed the Nordic involvement in support of 
democracy and economic growth in Russia and the Baltic region: 
  "In the EU, Sweden and Finland will have a special interest 
in the EU's playing an active role in developments." 
  He admitted that there are differences in Finland's and 
Sweden's policies toward the Baltic region, but he prefers to 
stress what they have in common: 
  "We are both deeply involved and positively disposed. That 
is the important thing." 
  He is prepared to go into battle about appointments to 
public 
posts which are often viewed in Finland as a system of political 
rewards: 
  "I have told the parties that I do not want to read in the 
newspapers that they have portioned out the appointments under 
consideration among themselves," he said authoritatively. 
  "I want to be informed at an early stage and have urged the 
parties to look for the best possible candidates for all the 
posts and not just think about who they represent politically." 
  In the context of the question of future EU membership a 
discussion has grown up with the parties about whether the 
president or the government should represent Finland. 
  "I have to see to it that the responsibility for foreign 
policy does not appear divided. It would be dangerous if it 
looked as if it was the president who dealt with bilateral 
contacts with the rest of the world and the government with 
everything else. In relation to the EU the important thing is 
that I will decide who will represent Finland . Here I will be 
very pragmatic and decide what is most sensible in each 
individual case." 
  His activism coupled with his critical distance to 
traditional party politics could perhaps help to regain the 
respect for politics which has largely been lost in Finland, as 
elsewhere. In addition he is striving to achieve a new 
folksiness in the presidency. Once a month he travels out into 
the country to listen to people's worries, complaints, and 
wishes. 
  His wife, Eeva, goes with him. But without having any 
"Hillary ambitions" she has complained about the program of the 
first trip they made. In future she will demand that her 
husband must also take part in her program of visits to schools 
and care institutions and not simply make industrial visits. 
  The first stories about his breakouts from presidential 
isolation have already begun to be heard. He went to an 
ordinary cinema showing of "Schindler's List" and the 
projectionist was so beside himself that he mixed up the reels 
of film. 
  His first engagement at the presidential residence at 
Tamminiemi was a swing session with Count Basie's band for his 
circle of friends who are interested in jazz. And when an 
unemployed man complained during his first walkabout in the 
country that he needed money to be able travel to visit his 
fiancee he had one of his aides buy a return ticket for the 
unfortunate man. He was not given any cash, however. 
  "That was probably the best thing we did," he said. 
  Relations with Russia were once a Finnish president's most 
important responsibility. They were a very formal and solemn 
business. Now the situation has been normalized, Martti 
Ahtisaari stressed, mentioning appreciatively all the more 
relaxed contacts between local authorities and individuals. 
  If he is worried about developments in Russia and the Baltic 
regions, he hides it well. Unlike the Swedish prime minister he 
seems more relieved that the time of shock therapy for Russia 
seems to be over: 
  "When you pursue a policy of reform you have to have the 
people with you. You can always theorize about what you want to 
do. But if you want to keep a democratic system you must, in my 
view, take a slower reform pace," he said, pointing to his 
experience in the IMF's tough programs of savings in developing 
countries. 
  The extremist Russian nationalist, Vladimir Zhirinovskiy, 
had 
just left Helsinki when we met the president. Martti Ahtisaari 
said that he approved of the initiative to invite a Russian 
delegation to discuss the democratic terms for membership in the 
Council of Europe and pointed out that it is not up to the hosts 
to decide which deputies the Duma's Foreign Affairs Committee 
should choose to send. Ahtisaari's comment on Zhirinovskiy's 
provocative statements and behavior was short: 
  "I think that it is useful both for Zhirinovskiy himself, 
his aides, and his voters to see what reactions there are to his 
behavior." 
  Part of the normalization of contacts with Russia is the 
fact 
that as yet the date for a first official visit has not been 
set. It is even possible that Estonia will be higher up on the 
list of visits, even though the sensitivity here is clearly 
still the subject of consideration. And in any case he will -- 
unless something catastrophic happens in the elections -- pay a 
visit to South Africa before going to Russia. 
  "My friends would not like it if I were not present at the 
installation of a new president on 10 May," the former UN 
commissioner for Namibia said. 
  But Martti Ahtisaari, like his predecessors, is paying his 
very first visit abroad as the president of the republic to 
Sweden and will arrive on Wednesday [13 April]. The special 
relationship with Sweden continues to exist: 
  "We share a common history. It is not without reason that my 
first state visit will be to Sweden. This is something 
completely natural, and I could not have envisaged anything 
different." 
  Martti Ahtisaari's own relationship with Sweden is also a 
special one. In his working life he has been more Swedish than 
his Finland Swedish opponent in the presidential election. 
  His background is purely Finnish and he found Swedish so 
difficult at his Finnish high school in Oulu that he had to 
repeat a year. But in 1960, as a 23 year old, he found 
employment in a Swedish aid project in Pakistan. There he 
learned his Swedish which is still excellent and began his work 
as a Nordic-based UN aid official which has been his main career 
since then. 
  When he told us about his Swedish friends and his early work 
it was like a refresher course in the history of the personnel 
of Swedish aid policy. He mentioned such foreground figures as 
Sixten Heppling, Arne Bjornberg, Ernst Michanek, Anders Forsse, 
and Bengt Save-Soderbergh. He said that he had been involved in 
supplying idea's for Save-Soderbergh's study on improvements to 
UN social programs. 
  His Nordic philosophy is founded on these experiences, and 
not on the work of the Nordic Council or through party contacts 
with Ingvar Carlsson and other top politicians. It was when he 
was out in the big wide world that he realized that the Nordic 
area is viewed as a unit. And it is through the Nordic area 
that Finland must work: 
  "I have seen that Nordic cooperation is so important that 
the 
responsibility for it cannot be left to our Finland Swedish 
friends alone." 
  This is why he will not simply be devoting his visit to 
Sweden next week to representative courtesies. He will meet 
Finns who live in Sweden on factory floors and in schools and 
will discuss the conditions under which they live in Sweden. He 
thinks that they should have a special position, but does not 
seem to want to make any capital out of their wish to be counted 
as a linguistic minority in Sweden. 
  At the Foreign Policy Institute he will also deliver a 
lecture on Finland, its Nordic neighbors, and Europe: 
  "But don't ask what I intend to say. We are still working on 
the speech and it probably will not be ready until immediately 
before I leave."

  [Text] In the view of President Martti Ahtisaari, Finland 
and Sweden can best promote European security by jointly 
developing the European Union's [EU] foreign and security 
policy. Ahtisaari, who spoke during his official state visit to 
Stockholm, also thought that relations between the Nordic 
countries and northwestern Russia can best be developed with the 
help of the EU's security policy. Kimmo Henriksson reports from 
Stockholm: 
  [Henriksson] The forum for Ahtisaari's speech, which has 
just 
ended, was the Foreign Policy Institute of Sweden, which has 
also heard Urho Kekkonen's and Mauno Koivisto's thoughts on 
foreign and security policy. Then it was the turn of the new 
president to voice his own views. Ahtisaari clearly agreed with 
Swedish Prime Minister Carl Bildt, who a few years ago, on the 
anniversary of Finnish Marshal Mannerheim's birth, thought that 
the premises and prerequisites of Finland's and Sweden's 
security policy were now closer than ever before in our time. 
  According to Ahtisaari, there are three central factors in 
both the Finnish and Swedish security policy thinking today: 
Political influence so that peace will be preserved in Europe 
and nearby areas, secondly, maintenance of a credible national 
defense capability and thirdly, work for the CSCE and other 
regional security arrangements. 
  In other words, no mention any longer of neutrality, nor now 
of military nonalliance that the government has emphasized for 
some time. The official interpretation is, however, that a 
credible national defense capability includes nonalliance 
without it being mentioned, but it is not underlined. 
  In his speech, Ahtisaari noted that Finland and Sweden both 
set out from the premise that participation in the development 
of the EU's joint foreign and security policy would best promote 
the cooperation between the Nordic countries and northwestern 
Russia. Ahtisaari's aim is that, with the development of the 
EU, Europe will become a security region, another new term, 
which will make war and threatening to wage war impossible. The 
Nordic countries' membership in the EU would underline the 
significance of northern issues in the EU's foreign policy. 
  Ahtisaari did, however, point out that geopolitics will not 
change as quickly as many people believe; in other words, Russia 
will remain in its old place and so will the Gulf of Bothnia. 
Despite that, with his speech Ahtisaari strengthened his image 
as a frontline representative of those fighting for Finnish EU 
membership, now also on foreign and security policy grounds.

<F P=106> [Article by Riitta Vainio: "Used T-72 Tanks Need Extensive </F>
Renovation"] 
  [Text] Niinisalo--The used East German T-72 tanks left over 
in East Germany and purchased by Finland are in need of 
extensive renovation. According to general staff estimates, it 
would cost more to thoroughly overhaul the tanks than it would 
to buy new ones. 
  So far, new radio equipment has been added to the 
Russian-made tanks in Finland. 
  In the summer of 1992 Finland bought not quite 100 used T-72 
battle tanks from Germany. Prior to that, Finland had bought the 
same kind of tanks from Russia, which has already updated its 
own tanks by adding shielding, among other things, to them. 
<H5>  Finland Was Biggest Buyer </H5>
  Germany sold the tanks because they were not compatible with 
the NATO equipment used by the German armed forces. It would 
have cost nearly as much to scrap the tanks in Germany as 
Finland paid for them. Finland used to be the biggest buyer of 
East German weapons. 
  According to the experts, the T-72 is slow in comparison 
with 
the latest Western tanks and its cannon has a shorter range. The 
most recent comparison was made during the Persian Gulf war. 
  According to the General Staff Ground Forces Department, 
there is not yet a concrete plan for renovating them. However, a 
long repair list has been outlined. The most important item is 
an increase in firing effectiveness. The tank's ability to 
operate in the dark has to be improved, its armor has to be 
increased, its communications equipment replaced, and its 
shielding improved. 
  The general staff nevertheless emphasizes that the T-72 is 
fully serviceable even in its present condition. 
  The purchase of these used tanks from Germany two years ago 
was justified, among other reasons, by the fact that the tanks 
were in good condition and that some of them were later models 
than the T-72's previously purchased from Russia.

<F P=106> [Article by Pilvikki Kause: "Kevsos Steps Up Exports to </F>
East; Other EFTA Countries Envy Finland Its Valuable Free Trade 
Agreement"] 
  [Text] Gdansk/Helsinki/Warsaw--Fazer managers ground their 
teeth when free trade in chocolate and candies between Finland 
and Poland disintegrated at the end of last year. The tariff 
advantage for industrial products was preserved, but the 
advantage for basic agricultural products and many food products 
was lost. Three years ago Fazer's exports to Poland skyrocketed 
with the aid of a relic of the past that guarantees free trade, 
the Kevsos agreement [free trade agreement with former USSR's 
East European satellites]. 
  "In just the next few months we'll realize how very 
important 
the agreement was to us," Kari Korpela of Fazer said. Korpela 
manages the Polish candy factory, Baltyk, a majority of whose 
shares Fazer purchased a year and a half ago. Fazer owns 51 
percent of the joint venture, which is located in the city of 
Gdansk, and the employees own the rest of it. The factory 
provides employment for 700 people and its sales volume was 
about 252 million markkaa in 1993. 
<H5>  Big Investments </H5>
  Fazer is planning "big investments" in Baltyk in the near 
future. The Finnish company acquired possession of the Polish 
factory for many strategic reasons. 
  "Poland's markets were opened up in 1991. Since it was clear 
to us that the Finns' tariff advantage would diminish within a 
few years, the purchase of the factory came at an opportune 
moment. While the chocolate and candy markets are growing in 
Poland at a rate of 5 to 10 percent, in Scandinavia, for 
example, they are relatively stable. It's also a good thing for 
us to export to the East, the West, and the south," Korpela 
enumerated. 
  So far, in addition to its own traditional candies, Baltyk 
produes only one Fazer product, the latter's "red" chocolate 
bar. According to Korpela, in the near future the selection of 
Fazer products will increase since the profitability of 
importing them will diminish. 
<H5>  Price Remained Unchanged </H5>
  Despite the loss of its competitive edge, Fazer has not 
begun 
to change the price of imported chocolate on the shelves of its 
Polish outlets. "At present we're developing our positions in 
the market." 
  In Korpela's opinion, one has to be present in Poland if one 
wants a piece of the pie. Baltyk ranks fourth in domestic sales 
figures. After the war the market director nationalized the 
family-owned company, Wedel, which Pepsi-Cola bought up a few 
years ago accompanied by a big hullaballoo. 
  In addition, the multinationals, Nestle and Suchard, are in 
stiff competition with Fazer to satsify nearly 40 million Poles' 
hunger for sweets. 
<H5>  Shares of Market Increased </H5>
  In the 1970's Finland signed unique free trade agreements 
with Bulgaria, the German Democratic Republic, Czechoslovakia, 
and Hungary, in addition to Poland. 
  A general agreement removed tariffs on industrial products, 
and Finland concluded separate agreements with each of these 
countries to eliminate obstacles to agricultural products. From 
Finland's standpoint, up until the end of the last decade the 
agreement was not of any great importance. 
  Once the foreign trade of the former socialist countries was 
liberated, Finnish exports to them began to rapidly increase, to 
Poland and Hungary in particular. Kevsos suddenly began to work 
to Finland's advantage, whereas before trade had even declined 
and showed a deficit. 
  In five years Finnish exports to Poland have multiplied 
nearly 10 times, measured in markkaa. While Finland's exports to 
Poland amounted to 290 million markkaa in 1988, last year 
exports came to over 2 billion markkaa. Finland exported 276 
million markkaa worth of products to Hungary in 1988. Last year 
they amounted to 770 million markkaa. 
  "Since the former socialist countries imposed tariffs and 
launched economic reforms, Kevsos has become a valuable asset 
for us. Finnish industrial exporters have notably succeeded in 
increasing their shares of the market. The tariff advantage has 
been of considerable benefit to, for example, Neste [state oil 
company] as well as the paper and food industries," Kari 
Mitrunen, the head of the foreign ministry Trade Policy 
Department, said. 
<H5>  Advantages Being Reduced </H5>
  By the middle of last November, however, the tariff 
advantages had been reduced, especially concerning trade with 
Poland. Free trade in basic agricultural products and several 
food products was eliminated entirely following heated 
negotiations when the new EFTA [European Free Trade Association] 
agreement went into effect. 
  The EFTA countries, Finland included, negotiated broad 
agreements with the East European countries that are aimed at 
gradually freeing trade by 2001. 
  At Finland's insistence, Kevsos will continue to exist 
alongside these agreements, despite the fact that the other EFTA 
countries would have preferred to lay it to rest. If Finland 
becomes a member of the European Union, Kevsos will lose its 
importance. 
<H5>  Tariff Advantages Were Reduced </H5>
  Poland too would have been willing to cancel Kevsos, which 
had become disadvantageous for the country. To salvage the 
socialist relic, Finland agreed to reduce its tariff advantages 
for oil products and the paper industry. 
  A tariff quota of 475,000 tons was agreed on for Finnish 
gasoline. According to the quota, gasoline was to receive a 
tariff advantage of 27 percent as compared with the other EFTA 
countries. 
  The head of Neste's Warsaw office, Ari Rajala, does not 
think 
that the advantage is in practice very significant anymore. 
Nevertheless, Kevsos has raised the hackles on seven other 
foreign oil companies operating in Poland. 
  "Competitors have even complained about the agreement 
directly to President Lech Walesa," Rajala said. 
  Foreign trade chief Lea Lastikka of the Food Industry 
Association said that the elimination of basic agricultural 
products and many food products--like butter, chocolate, 
cheeses, pork, and beef--from the Kevsos list for Poland is a 
great loss. 
<H5>  Surplus Butter Becomes Luxury Item </H5>
  Poland has risen to become the fourth largest recipient of 
Finland's food exports. Valio, for example, has acquired 
favorable markets in Poland for its surplus butter and other 
products. A couple of months ago a chunk of Finnish butter 
hardly cost more than a chunk of Polish butter, but now it has 
become a luxury item. 
  "It'll be a pity if Valio abandons its markets since its 
products became well-known during the boom," said Wiktor 
Szwechowicz, Valio's only remaining representative in Poland. 
According to Szwechowicz, Valio is thinking about granting a 
license to a Polish dairy.

<F P=106> [Geir Salvesen report: "Referendum Likely on 28 November"] </F>
  [Text] Monday, 28 November, will probably be the date of 
the EU [European Union] referendum in Norway, which will 
therefore vote after Sweden and Finland. 
  "28 November is a good tip. This is the date which looks 
most likely according to the wishes of a majority in the 
Storting," Prime Minister Gro Harlem Brundtland said. 
  Yesterday she had invited the parliamentary leaders of the 
various parties and representatives of the "yes" and "no" 
movements to make their views known on the date for the EU 
referendum at a "summit" in the government building. At the 
meeting, it emerged that the Conservative Party, the Labor 
Party, and the Progress Party want the referendum to take place 
after the one in Sweden -- which will be held on Sunday, 13 
November. The date of 28 November was proposed. 
  Theoretically it is possibile that a different date could be 
selected. The government will take a few weeks to decide. But 
yesterday it was at least confirmed that the referendum will 
take place after Sweden's. 
  Gro Harlem Brundtland stressed that this will give the many 
people, who want to know what choice Finland and Sweden make, an 
opportunity to take this into account. The Conservative Party's 
Anders Talleraas said that Norwegian voters must have "maximum 
information" before the reach their decision. 
  The "no" side wanted the referendum either on the same day 
as 
Sweden's -- or before. The Christian People's Party's Kjell 
Magne Bondevik wanted Norway to be the first of the Nordic 
countries to vote. 
  "We knew that the `yes' side would act ruthlessly to 
manipulate the referendum," said "No to the EU" leader Kristen 
Nygaard, who was also present. 
  "Might is right," said the Socialist Left Party's Erik 
Solheim. Gro Harlem Brundtland, who was dressed in red and did 
not allow herself to get in the least bit aggravated by the 
allegations, said that it was most natural to take account of 
the view which had the backing of a majority. The others in the 
"yes" camp took the same line, and wondered what the situation 
would be like if the minority were to decide. 
  "This news will gladden that section of voters who are 
interested in knowing what choice the other Nordic countries 
have made," said Inge Lonning, leader of the Europe Movement. 
  The exact question that will be asked in the referendum has 
not been decided yet. There has been speculation about whether 
it is the package of results negotiated in the membership talks 
about which the people will be asked to make up their minds. 
  In 1972 the wording was: "Should Norway become a member of 
the European Community?" A carbon copy of the formula then 
would point toward: "Should Norway become a member of the 
European Union?" The reason why the "no" side in particular is 
concerned on this point is that there have been fears of a 
"Danish solution." Norway could then begin to renegotiate if 
the voters said "no" to the actual negotiated package as a 
result of the wording of the question asked in the referendum. 
  Kristen Nygaard said that he was fairly satisfied with the 
indirect assurances he has received to the effect that this will 
not happen, and said that it was a useful meeting. 
  But it is possible that a reference to the actual negotiated 
package could be included in the overall wording -- without 
being the main question. This will now be discussed in 
government circles. 
  Another question is whether there will be a majority in the 
Storting for a referendum after Sweden's when the votes of those 
deputies in the Labor Party's Storting group who support "Social 
Democrats Against the EU" (SME) are subtracted. Assuming that 
all SME supporters will vote against the 28 November date, there 
will be pressure on the Progress Party's deputies. Not many 
votes are needed to tip the scales. Carl I. Hagen told 
AFTENPOSTEN that he is sure that the Progress Party's deputies 
will back a date later than that of the Swedish referendum. 
This is something that he has already raised in the Storting 
group, and there were no objections, he claimed.

<F P=106> [Report by Geir Salvesen report: "Conservative Party's </F>
First Lady Says `Thank You and Good-bye'"] 
  [Text] Bergen -- "I am looking forward to continuing on 
the Conservative Party team, but in a much less prominent 
position," Kaci Kullmann Five said. 
  The Conservative Party national conference got off to a slow 
start yesterday with a leader who made a personal statement 
about why she has had enough: "After the election last fall I 
was both tired and sorry for myself," she said. The limit had 
been reached for reconciling political work and small children. 
That is why she cound not go on. 
  This introduction did not exactly generate enthusiasm and on 
several occasions the Conservative Party leader voiced 
bitterness toward the press which she said had tried to create 
personal conflicts in the run-up to the national conference by 
raising the question of the prime ministerial candidate in the 
party which "they write is not alive -- and hardly has any right 
to life," as she put it. 
  Kullmann Five made it clear that it is the Conservative 
Party's Storting group and central executive which will appoint 
the party's next prime ministerial candidate -- when they think 
the time is ripe. "It does not seem to be overripe at present," 
she said, adding that her role will not be that of a trophy on 
the wall or a snake in the grass. She said that she fully 
supports incoming leader Jan Petersen. 
  The applause from the national conference audience increased 
when she began to talk about the future, and it was a leader in 
the mood for a fight who tackled the question of the the shift 
in the balance of power through an increase in the share of 
state ownership and controls over industry, banking, and the 
economy. 
  "The state's economic power is too great, and is growing all 
the time. In addition job after job in this system is being 
filled by people with the `right' party membership card," she 
said. 
  "The struggle against the welfare state is not over when the 
authorities want to keep a register of stuffed animals in 
private homes, introduce a small boat register, or end the 
arrangement by which a small extension to a house can be started 
with less involvement of bureaucracy," Five said. 
  Otherwise the EU [European Union] question was the most 
central element in the speeches to the national conference. No 
one was particularly surprised that Kullmann Five recommended a 
Conservative "yes" to the results of the negotiations. The 
"yes" arguments were well known, but she had her claws out for 
the Center Party and the Socialist Left Party. 
  "The only thing we now about their alternative is that there 
must be at least as much fog as at Fornebu airport today," she 
told a national conference for which some people had been 
delayed because of fog. "Per Olaf Lundteigen and Paul Chaffey 
have also revealed that they would really like to see the EU 
dissolved. This means that it is not only an alternative but 
also an alternative Europe involving change for the worse which 
they want. My 'yes' to the EU is therefore a `no' to something 
much worse -- to Lundteigen's alternative and Kristin 
Halvorsen's Norway as an experiment in Europe -- outside the EU. 
The alternative is that `might is right' and in that sort of 
world `might' has never lain with the small countries." 
  The debate after Kullmann Five's opening speech revealed no 
major disagreements either about the past or the Conservatives' 
future course. There were no stubborn calls for 
self-examination. The vast majority were concerned about the 
future. As was Sonja Irene Sjoli from Akershus. But she 
thought that the Conservative Party has a problems with its 
image. 
  "The Conservative Party has gained the reputation that we 
are 
a flock of materialistic, egotistic money people who only think 
about ourselves, about competitiveness and tax relief. A party 
for the elite and successful, a mother of pearl league. We know 
that this is not true, but as long as other people believe it we 
also have a problem as a party," she said. 
  Even if major rally failed to materialize on this opening 
day 
and is unlikely to appear throughout the rest of this national 
conference weekend, this does not mean that pessimism and gloom 
rule. National conferences often serve to strengthen a party's 
own morale. "There will be other times. We will return the 
stronger," parliamentary leader Anders Talleraas said. And the 
others think so too. But how? they ask.

<F P=106> [Hilde Harbo report: "Probable `Yes' From Hagen"] </F>
  [Text] Carl I. Hagen believes that it is of little 
significance whether or not Norway becomes a member of the EU 
[European Union]. 
  Nor does he think that Norwegian influence in the EU is 
important in itself. 
  "The central issue is party political influence, not 
nationalistic considerations," he said. 
  The Progress Party chairman has little enthusiasm for 
Norwegian EU membership, even though he expects that he will end 
up saying "yes." He is planning to make public his personal 
view of Norwegian membership at a press conference today. Hagen 
said that even though he is basically positive toward the EU, he 
has grown more and more skeptical toward the plans for further 
union. 
  He has little enthusiasm for the EU's goal of a common 
currency and a central bank, and is also deeply dissatisfied 
with the EU's agricultural and regional policies which he 
believes bear the mark of the planned economy. 
  The only unambiguously positive aspect of the EU that he can 
see is the importance of the organization for peace and security 
in Europe. 
  "The sum total of all the rest is neither here nor there. By 
this I mean that Norwegian membership will not in itself mean 
major changes. Both the `no' and `yes' sides exaggerate when 
they respectively portray the EU as a hell and as a paradise. 
The important thing is how Norway adapts and what policies we 
pursue. We could for example choose to follow the EU's rules 
even if we remained outside," Hagen said. 
  Hagen does not want the party's national conference this 
coming weekend to reach a decision on the full negotiated 
membership agreement with the EU, and pointed out that the 
party's program has laid down that the matter will be decided at 
a meeting of the party's national executive. Party chairman 
Hagen thinks that the organization needs time to evaluate the 
outcome of the negotiations and backs an extraordinary national 
executive meeting in June. He also stressed, however, that he 
fully accepts that the national conference can reach a decision 
on Norwegian membership if this is the wish of the national 
conference.

<F P=106> [Report by Aslak Bonde report: "Frontline Figures Reelected </F>
in SME"] 
  [Text] Hallvard Bakke and Tove Strand Gerhardsen were 
yesterday reelected as the key figures in Social Democrats 
Against the EU [European Union] (SME). Bakke as leader and 
Strand Gerhardsen as deputy leader. The leader of the Norwegian 
Printers Union, Finn Erik Thoresen, was also reelected as deputy 
leader, but he did not play the same role as the other two at 
the weekend's national conference in Oslo. 
  Yesterday it was Strand Gerhardsen who inspired the meeting 
with a speech which was more sober than most of the other "No to 
the EU" speeches at present. Her main message is that Norway 
will have "a little more scope" to pursue social democratic 
policies if we remain outside the EU. 
  She reached few firm conclusions and admitted that she had a 
great understanding for the "yes" side's argument that we have 
to join the EU to achieve influence: 
  "This was after all one of the reasons why the labor 
movement 
entered the Storting. The problem is simply this: What are we 
to change and together with whom are we to change it? 
  ``We have after all accepted the foundation of EU 
cooperation 
in the form of the Maastricht Treaty. This is something we 
cannot change. Also, those who are already members of the EU 
have been involved in getting this foundation adopted. There 
are many good social democrats in the EU, but I am unable to see 
that they have enough strength to change anything in 
particular,'' the SME deputy leader said. 
  She hinted that it would be more difficult to pursue social 
welfare policies in Norway, in part because we will have to pay 
billions to the EU in membership contributions. She expressed 
fears of increased unemployment because she takes the view that 
the EU does not give the same high priority to the fight for 
full employment as we have done -- and can do -- here in Norway. 
  She also complained about the lack of democracy in the EU 
and 
said that in many respects Norway could be a pioneer if we 
remain outside. 
  "Then we would have the potential to try new things, and of 
course to go wrong and make mistakes, but perhaps also to 
develop new policies which can be the model for policies 
elsewhere. It would be nice if we once again could be a 
pioneer, as we in the Nordic area were when it came to welfare 
policy, and as we in the Nordic area perhaps have been when it 
comes to women in political life," Strand Gerhardsen said. 
  She was rewarded with a lengthy standing ovation from the 
delegates at the national conference. In addition to the 
central executive board there were two representatives from each 
province. SME does not have the money to arrange larger 
conferences. [passage omitted]

<F P=106> [Interview with Prime Minister Carl Bildt by Lothar Ruehl; </F>
place and date not given: "Russia Has No Right To Have a Say in 
the Baltic States"] 
  [Text] [Ruehl] Mr. Prime Minister, with the expected 
accession of Sweden and Finland to the European Union [EU] in 
1995, West Europe's political and economic organization will be 
expanded to northern Europe and will have a common external 
border with Russia. You have called the Brussels membership 
agreement the most important treaty that Sweden has concluded in 
this century. Why? 
  [Bildt] With the accession of Sweden and Finland the EU will 
adopt a northern European dimension. It would become even 
larger and more fleshed out if Norway were to join the EU as the 
fourth north European country. However, with Sweden and Finland 
the EU will acquire a strong northern part, which will also 
provide it with new strengths. In any case, Sweden will make 
its contribution to that, as soon as the people have approved 
accession, as I confidently expect they will do. 
  Of course, Sweden will fulfill the Maastricht Treaty and 
support the entire construct as a full partner. We will also 
participate in the common foreign and security policy without 
any reservations or deductions. Similar to Finland, my country 
has a special regional importance for northern Europe and the 
Baltic Sea area, which means also for the relationship with the 
three Baltic states and with Russia. Here a new situation will 
develop for Europe. 
  [Ruehl] Some people fear or expect that the expansion of the 
EU might loosen it and will, perhaps, even dissolve the 
political consolidation and the economic ties again. What are 
the Swedish interests? Will Swedish foreign policy move away 
from traditional neutrality to such an extent, as you have 
always indicated, that Sweden can act as a full, active security 
partner also in the case of crises? 
  [Bildt] I do not share such fears about a loosening of the 
EU ties, and I agree with Chancellor Kohl on this matter. Quite 
certainly, Sweden has not decided to join the EU to dissolve it 
or to weaken it. On the contrary. Sweden has always been part 
of the liberal-democratic Europe; Swedish policy has always been 
guided by its values. In the new situation in Europe, which has 
developed since 1990 and which is no longer based on the policy 
of blocs and on confrontation, accession is easier but no less 
important than in the past. Another European prospect has been 
opened up, not only by the Maastricht Treaty on the EU but also 
toward the north and the east, toward those countries in Europe 
which belonged to the Warsaw Pact and to the Soviet Union in the 
past, including Russia. In this larger Europe there lies a 
historic challenge for the expansion of freedom, which must be 
consolidated together. Establishing common security is our 
historic assignment. As an old European state, with its own 
history of empire and its varied international experiences, in 
particular in United Nations peacekeeping, Sweden will 
contribute to that. 
  [Ruehl] What is the particular importance of northern 
Europe, the usefulness of the northern European dimension of the 
EU? 
  [Bildt] Quite clearly the changed geopolitical situation. 
With the dissolution of the Soviet Union, especially the 
independence of the Baltic states and of Ukraine, Russia has 
been cut off from direct territorial contact with West Europe, 
in particular since the last Russian troops will withdraw from 
Germany this year. This new reality gives Sweden's accession to 
the EU, with the consequence of West Europe's expansion to 
northern Europe and to the Baltic Sea area, a particular 
significance, because this establishes neighborhood with Russia 
and with the three Baltic countries, which will naturally be 
intensified by Finland's accession into the EU, which we expect. 
A new ensemble is developing in the EU, which will link 
Europe's northeast to the West. However, this does not mean a 
delineation toward Russia but a bridge for coming closer 
together. Northwest Russia is of great importance for Europe, 
politically and culturally as well as economically and in 
scientific-technological terms. 
  [Ruehl] Give us a specific example, please. 
  [Bildt] St. Petersburg as a large city and a region is twice 
as large as Berlin. This area will be a focal area of modern 
development that will radiate to the east, the Baltic, and the 
center of Europe. Russia's ties with West Europe will develop 
anew via the Baltic Sea, with the Baltic states and northern 
Europe. Sweden is located in the center of this area with 
historical ties and experiences toward both sides. Therefore, 
it is important that it participate in formulating the interests 
of the EU in East Europe and in the EU policy toward and 
together with Russia as an EU partner. In the field of 
security, the EU will border in the north on the Western focus 
of Russia's Armed Forces and Navy: the deployment area of the 
North Sea Fleet with missile-armed submarines, whose importance 
as high-sea-capable, globally mobile carriers of nuclear 
deterrence will even grow -- compared with the Soviet past -- as 
a result of the START [Strategic Arms Reduction Talks] agreement 
between the United States and Russia. Therefore, too, it is 
good that Sweden, as a country experienced in dealing with 
Russia and the Russian empire, can exert direct influence within 
the EU on the EU's security policy. 
  [Ruehl] This also appeals to the Western European Union 
[WEU] as the military policy defense pact of West Europe and 
annex of NATO. What is Sweden's attitude toward the WEU and 
toward this prospect? Does this touch upon the issue of 
neutrality? 
  [Bildt] Neutrality, which has existed up to now, will not 
hinder Sweden in this respect, because the preconditions for 
neutrality in Europe have changed fundamentally; this means the 
historical sense and purpose of neutrality have disappeared as a 
result of the dissolution of the Warsaw Pact. 
  We are primarily interested in helping to build democratic 
national defense systems which are oriented toward international 
cooperation, in the former Warsaw Pact states, whose security 
needs are to be covered by NATO's Partnership for Peace. For 
that we can use Sweden's rich experience with our own defense 
system as well as with our participation in UN peacekeeping 
missions. However, the most important thing for Sweden is active 
participation in the EU's common foreign and security policy, 
because this means playing a key role in establishing stability 
and security spread to all of Europe. When Sweden has become an 
EU member, we will decide whether Sweden is to join the WEU or 
whether it is just to have observer status. I think that the 
latter is the more likely option. 
  [Ruehl] What is NATO's importance for European security in 
the future? Should it expand toward the East and could all of 
northern Europe become part of the Atlantic-West European 
alliance system? 
  [Bildt] Not the latter; northern Europe and the Baltic Sea 
area should be reintegrated in an all-European security 
structure, together with the Baltic states, which are also part 
of northern Europe. Of course, the Russian Federation, just as 
well as other European states which belonged to the former USSR 
should also be included in such a security structure. There 
must not be a new delineation along a new dividing line through 
Europe, after the division of the Cold War has now been 
overcome. The EU, too, must find its place in such a security 
structure. NATO has its focus in the West, as a counterweight, 
so to speak, to Russia as the big power in East Europe and on 
the Eurasian continent. 
  NATO remains important for the anchoring of the United 
States 
in Europe and for the defense of West Europe. It essentially 
contributes to all-European security, for instance as a result 
of the U.S. commitment to Norway's security, which, for its 
part, is indispensable for security in all of northern Europe. 
Sweden will develop special relations with the Baltic states to 
strengthen their independence and security and to exert 
influence on them so that they establish special security ties 
with West Europe. The EU as well as the system of Partnership 
for Peace with NATO are suitable for this purpose. 
  [Ruehl] Is the development not moving further into the 
direction of NATO expansion to the east, beyond the "Atlantic 
West Europe" toward Central Europe and beyond Poland and 
Lithuania to the eastern Baltic Sea area? 
  [Bildt] This is correct, as far as Lithuania is concerned in 
the Baltic area. However, the concept of NATO's Partnership for 
Peace is flexible. Flexibility is the most important element of 
the whole thing. It permits various solutions, tailored to the 
specific security situation of the individual partners. 
  In general, one can say that this initiative can, to a 
certain extent, bring about a gradual expansion of NATO in 
Europe. However, the actual function of NATO, its central 
function, lies in the West, in the relationship between North 
America and West Europe in the narrower geographical sense, 
which also includes Norway and Denmark and Germany. In 
addition, the specific situation of the individual countries 
remains the basis of common security. 
  [Ruehl] What does this mean for common security policy? 
  [Bildt] European security policy -- including that of NATO 
and the EU -- must take this diversity into account and, 
therefore, distinguish between the individual countries in the 
spirit of the Partnership for Peace program. NATO cannot 
organize unified security for all of Europe. However, it can 
form a focus and thus be a major part of the foundation of the 
European security structure. 
  As regards the three Baltic countries, they are realistic; 
they know that their acceptance into NATO is not likely in the 
foreseeable future. In the long term, however, everything is 
open. The NATO Partnership for Peace, which they want to enter, 
offers them contact. Sweden will help them, for instance in 
military cooperation with NATO within the framework of the UN 
for international peacekeeping: The "Nordic battalion" of the 
four northern European states in the UN Protection Forces, in 
which Sweden is essentially involved, can serve as an example 
for the establishment of a "Baltic battalion." The northern 
European countries can advise the Baltic states and support 
their military training and organization. Cooperation with NATO 
within the UN framework is necessary and useful, e.g. for 
taking over and applying NATO standards and NATO procedures, 
which have proved their worth at the international level. 
Sweden can participate in this outside the formal NATO 
framework, and the Baltic countries can as well. A pragmatic 
policy permits this without expansion of the NATO alliance 
framework. 
  [Ruehl] What are your expectations regarding the 
development of the security situation in Europe between Russia 
as the superpower in the East, and the Atlantic Alliance and the 
EU in the West? 
  [Bildt] The threat of Soviet imperialism and an aggressive 
ideological power policy has disappeared for good; it will not 
be reestablished regardless of what trends will influence 
Russia's foreign policy in the future and the relationship with 
the outside world. The Soviet empire will not be revived. 
After its loss of the empire and its position as an 
international power, which the Soviet Union mainly held due to 
its military strength and armament, Russia is currently 
unsettled after the secession of large territories in Europe and 
Asia and the independence of the former Soviet republics and the 
ongoing state and economic crisis. 
  [Ruehl] And this unsettled situation does not exactly help 
to stabilize the political situation in the region. 
  [Bildt] Well, this crisis will not be over soon. 
Nevertheless, despite its weakening and the internal confusion, 
Russia remains a major power due to its sheer size, its huge 
population, its natural resources, and its still existing 
industrial-technological potential. It also remains a potential 
international risk factor, yet so far I do not see this 
developing. On the contrary, Russia has so far remained ready to 
cooperate, which can be seen in Russia's policy in the Bosnian 
conflict. 
  [Ruehl] Is the resurgence of nationalism in Russia a danger? 
What do Zhirinovskiy and the new majority in the Duma mean? 
  [Bildt] There is, of course, Russian nationalism, which is 
being strengthened by the crisis and the misery; but this has 
happened in the past too, and is currently also happening in 
other countries. Russian nationalism is even necessary to a 
certain extent. Russia must restore national pride and its 
national identity after the humiliation it suffered as a result 
of the decline of the Soviet Union. Yet this has to take place 
in a democratic system. The nationalist and the old 
national-Bolshevist forces are gathering; this is the 
disquieting aspect of the development; but so far Russia has not 
been overwhelmed by a wave of chauvinism. 
  [Ruehl] But Zhirinovskiy is a political nuisance. 
  [Bildt] No doubt about that. He is a political clown, who 
is making a caricature of Russia, but who is certainly not 
backed by a majority of Russians. The large cities, in 
particular, Moscow and St. Petersburg, neither followed him nor 
the other nationalists and the communists, with whom he entered 
into a kind of "brown-red" front. Many Russians are ashamed of 
Zhirinovskiy's excesses, which tarnish Russia's reputation; they 
think it is a shame that Russia is being disfigured by a 
charlatan. Zhirinovskiy will destroy himself, because he is 
yelling for war, for invading all territories reaching to the 
Indian Ocean, for the borders of the Czarist empire from the 
beginning of the century. 
  [Ruehl] So you do not think that the people will follow his 
slogans? 
  [Bildt] The Russian people will not follow Zhirinovskiy and, 
after its experience in the Afghanistan war, the army will not 
do so either. He is a grotesque phenomenon that will pass by as 
others did before him in the history of Russia. Today, he is 
personifying social protest in a situation of misery and 
national frustration. Yet, it is doubtful that people will 
follow him for a long time. 
  [Ruehl] What is your assessment of Russia's foreign policy 
in general? How should one handle the "near abroad" as a sphere 
of Russian interests? 
  [Bildt] Russian rhetoric about the "near abroad" and a 
"special Russian role" there is incompatible with 
good-neighborly relations and CSCE rules, particularly with the 
Paris Charter for a new Europe of 1990, and the UN Charter. 
Nobody must accept those claims because they mean interfering 
in affairs of other states who have become sovereign and 
independent. There is no "near abroad" that can be politically 
controlled by Russia or any other power in Europe. The Baltics 
are as close to Sweden and Finland as Russia, historically and 
culturally even closer. In Estonia and Latvia there are 
problems of political integration with the Slav part of the 
population, which was transferred there in the Soviet era to 
annihilate the national identity of these small peoples and to 
control these countries from the inside. Yet, this is no reason 
for Russia to claim a right to a say. Russia must not be 
permitted to intervene there or anywhere else. The Russians are 
also wrong when they claim that the "human rights" of the 
Russian minorities would be violated. That is not true: The 
new laws on citizenship are correct as is the treatment of the 
Slav groups of the population. The Council of Europe helped to 
work out these laws. 
  [Ruehl] How should Russia act toward its neighbors? 
  [Bildt] Russia now has a historic chance to find its way 
back to Europe, to which it belongs. A new European order 
requires equal rights and mutual respect. Spheres of interests 
are not compatible with it. Neither is a security condominium 
between Russia and NATO, including joint security guarantees for 
former allies of the old Soviet Union. The litmus test for 
Russia's intentions and its relationship toward Europe is 
Russia's policy toward the Baltic states. This is the criterion 
for European security and cooperation. 
  [Ruehl] Apart from the Baltics there is the question of East 
Europe and the CIS. Ties that developed over a long period were 
suddenly interrupted in 1991. Do you see that as a risk or as a 
chance for a new beginning? 
  [Bildt] Geography, joint history, economic and human ties 
between the peoples of the individual states rather speak for 
careful rapprochement after the separation. It will not be a 
return to the Russian empire or under Moscow's hegemony. Yet, 
Belarus is already looking to Moscow again for guidance. There 
are forces that are working toward voluntary association, but 
there are also tensions that speak against it. The situation in 
Ukraine is extremely critical, particularly since the reformist 
forces do not dominate there, as could be seen in the election. 
The post-Soviet and postimperial era has only just started, and 
many things can still change; the current situation in East 
Europe is one of transition. Rapprochement between Russia, 
Ukraine, Belarus, and maybe even Kazakhstan for a great Slav 
confederation appears to be possible. A CIS that is politically 
and economically organized around Russia is one possibility that 
would be geographically and economically plausible and, 
moreover, would be historically founded.

<F P=106> [Report on interview with Moderate Coalition Party secretary </F>
Gunnar Hokmark by Monica Bjorklund; place and date not given] 
  [Text] We will remind the voters of what is best for 
Sweden. That step by step we are leading Sweden out of the 
crisis. And that a "yes" to Europe is a "yes" to the future. 
  This was how Moderate Coalition Party secretary Gunnar 
Hokmark sketched the Moderates' election message. The message 
will to a large extent be that Sweden is now on the right road 
and what is important is to continue along the path we have 
started to take. 
  "We are used to facing Social Democratic scare propaganda in 
election campaigns. But this year their attacks will flounder 
on the simple fact that when they were ruling the curves were 
all pointing downward and now the curves are pointing upward." 
  The Moderate election campaign will clearly show the 
differences between Moderate and Social Democratic policy. This 
applies in particular to tax policy where the Moderates are 
pushing their line of tax reductions. While the Social 
Democrats, according to the Moderates' calculations, want to 
raise taxes by 80 billion kronor. 
  "On tax policy there is a clear political dividing line. 
Here the Social Democrats have already lost credibility once 
before. The policy they are now advocating is the same policy 
with which they led Sweden into the crisis." 
  It is from the Social Democrats that the Moderates expect to 
attract the largest number of new voters. 
  "It is there that we have the major opinion poll and voter 
gains to make," Gunnar Hokmark said. 
  "When we have made gains in the past, it is chiefly from the 
Social Democrats that we have taken votes." 
  Gunnar Hokmark does not expect the four government parties 
to 
publish a joint election manifesto. 
  "We will run the election campaign as individual parties. 
But the government coalition in itself is a very important 
manifestation." 
  He is convinced that European issues will play a major role 
in the election campaign. 
  "The question of whether or not Sweden should become a 
member 
will hover over the whole election campaign and will be brought 
to a head. And it will also be a question of who will lead 
Sweden in Europe. 
  ``We Moderates will push the European issue firmly. We know 
that we will win voters with this. And we know that when we 
push the European issue others will push it more than they would 
have done.'' 
  Gunnar Hokmark believes that the economy and Europe will be 
the election campaign's two main issues. 
  The Social Democrats' party secretary, Mona Sahlin, recently 
proposed that farmers and businessmen should pay additional 
taxes if Sweden becomes a member of the EU, because these groups 
will gain so much from membership. 
  Gunnar Hokmark calls this a "stupid excuse for raising 
taxes." 
  Center Party leader Olof Johansson in his turn has said that 
increased environmental levies could contribute to the financing 
of Sweden's contribution to the EU budget. Hokmark says "no" to 
this too. 
  "We will be able to afford to pay our membership 
contribution 
because membership will lead to increased economic growth. We 
should not then limit this growth by increasing taxes." 
  Gunnar Hokmark thinks that local taxation should be reduced 
during the life of the next Riksdag (1994-1998). This will be 
achieved primarily with the help of "good local politicians." 
But he would also like to see a freeze on increases in local 
taxation and he thinks that referendums on tax increases should 
be held. 
  The Moderates' first deputy chairman, Lars Tobisson, 
recently 
outlined what future social welfare should look like. The 
system will guarantee basic protection and protection against 
inflation. Citizens will have to protect themselves to a much 
greater extent against loss of income through their own savings 
and personal insurances. 
  This caused Social Affairs Minister Bengt Westerberg 
(Liberal 
Party) to hit the roof. In this area there is a sharp dividing 
line between the Moderates and the Liberal Party and here the 
Liberals want to keep today's system. 
  But Gunnar Hokmark would like to tone down the differences. 
He thinks that it is wrong to call the Moderate proposals cuts. 
They are necessary changes, he said, to create robust insurance 
systems which do not undermine social welfare policies. 
  "The one-day period needed to qualify for sickness benefit 
for example was not a cut but an improvement, damn it. It led 
to less absenteeism and increased productivity." 
  He was unwilling to outline any timetable, but said that "it 
is important to keep up a pretty rapid pace in the process of 
change." 
  Another issue which divides the nonsocialist parties is 
nuclear power. The Center Party and the Christian Democratic 
Community Party want legislation establishing 2010 as the final 
year for nuclear power stations. The Moderates on the other 
hand think that nuclear power should be retained as long as the 
safety requirements are met. 
  "Sweden is now entering a period of economic boom which will 
hopefully continue for the whole of the nineties. This makes an 
increased demand on electricity. And for environmental reasons 
in particular electricity is better than oil. 
  "It is true that the parties have different views on this 
issue. But what has been characteristic of this Riksdag is that 
the government parties have been able to incorporate divergent 
views. I am convinced that they will be able to do so in the 
life of the next Riksdag too."

  [Text] President Rauf Denktas met Ambassador Robert Lamb, 
U.S. State Department special coordinator on Cyprus, for the 
second time this afternoon. Speaking after the meeting, Denktas 
said: 
  [Begin Denktas recording] They are making an effort to 
establish why we are insisting on certain matters and why the 
Greek Cypriot side is refusing to agree to certain points. That 
is what we discussed. 
  The newspapers published Glavkos Kliridhis's speech in the 
European Parliament. We have read his speech. You will see 
when you read it that it is neither related to the UN secretary 
general's package of confidence-building measures [CBM's] nor to 
the principle of the solution of the Cyprus problem between the 
two equal communities on the island. Kliridhis clearly said: 
The Cyprus problem is a question of occupation. The occupation 
must be removed. Those who have come from Turkey must leave. 
All the refugees must return to their homes. Europe must help 
Cyprus on those matters. 
  The person who said all that purports to be holding talks 
with the Turkish Cypriot side on the CBM's package. We stressed 
all that and drew Mr. Lamb's attention to that state of affairs. 
We cannot accept the view that politicians make such 
statements. What Kliridhis said was not just a statement by a 
politician. What he emphasized was the continuation of a policy 
that has divided Cyprus into two parts ever since it was put 
into effect in December 1963. The Greek Cypriot side has 
persistently maintained the same leaning. Therefore, we are 
obliged to talk in a way that safeguards our rights. We will 
continue to clearly express our opinion on the proposals that 
are made to us. We will continue to do that in goodwill. 
  Regarding the additions that have been made to the CBM's 
package, some of them can be acceptable if they are changed. 
There are those which cannot be accepted. We explained that as 
well. [end recording] 
  A correspondent asked Denktas the following: 
  [Begin recording] [Unidentified correspondent] Mr. 
President, 
have the foreign officials adopted an understanding approach to 
our problems and anxieties? 
  [Denktas] Diplomats are like people who play poker. Their 
faces and eyes will not reveal anything. They do not comment 
but listen to what you say and then leave. [end recording]

  [Text] Tugay Ulucevik, deputy under secretary of the 
Turkish Foreign Ministry, conferred with Robert Lamb, U.S. State 
Department special coordinator on Cyprus, this morning. The 
meeting, which continued for nearly two hours, was held in the 
Turkish Embassy in Nicosia. Ulucevik said after the meeting 
that he and Lamb were in Cyprus at the same time by coincidence. 
He also said that he exchanged views with Lamb, with whom he 
has been constantly in touch. Ulucevik stated the following: 
  [Begin Ulucevik recording] I have found an opportunity to 
bring to Ambassador Lamb's attention the significant changes 
that have been made between the original package of 
confidence-building measures and the package that is on the 
negotiating table at the present time. As far as I am 
concerned, our talks have been useful. Yes, that is how we have 
benefited from the courtesy meeting we had. [end recording] 
  A correspondent asked Ulucevik the following question: 
  [Begin recording] [Unidentified correspondent] Claims have 
been made to the effect that the bargaining talks on Maras 
[Varosha] will be used on matters related to the economic crisis 
in Turkey. Can you comment on that matter? 
  [Ulucevik] I do not even wish to regard what you have said 
as 
a question. I cannot accept that as a concept. Turkey is well 
aware of its historic responsibilities and obligations toward 
our brethren and kinsmen in Cyprus. That awareness is 
strengthening every day. As I have already said, that cannot be 
accepted as a concept. Nor can any question that is related to 
what you have said be regarded as a proper question. [end 
recording]

  [Text] Robert Lamb, the U.S. State Department's special 
coordinator on the Cyprus issue, left Cyprus empty-handed this 
morning. Lamb had a lengthy meeting with Turkish Cypriot leader 
Rauf Denktas yesterday. 
  In a statement to reporters afterward, Lamb said that 
Denktas 
still has problems with the informal UN document of 21 March. 
Pressured by reporters, the U.S. diplomat said his meetings in 
the occupied area reached no conclusion, adding that he is 
neither a negotiator nor did he bring any new proposals.

  [Text] President Rauf Denktas has opposed Greek Cypriot 
leader Glavkos Kliridhis' claim that the Cyprus problem can be 
resolved through demilitarization and Cyprus becoming a European 
Union member. He said: We urge Kliridhis to abandon his 
intention to make additions to the package of 
confidence-building measures. 
  In a written statement today, Denktas replied to Glavkos 
Kliridhis' speech in the European Union Parliamentary Assembly. 
Describing the proposal for the demilitarization of Cyprus as a 
deceptive move to undermine the Treaty of Guarantees and 
Turkey's right to obstruct ENOSIS [union of Cyprus and Greece] 
and safeguard the existence of the Turkish Cypriots, Denktas 
said that Kliridhis is ignoring the realities. 
  Stressing that Kliridhis has been disrespectful toward his 
audience and his people by greatly exaggerating the strength of 
the Turkish military forces in Cyprus, Denktas noted: The 
Turkish troops arrived when the final blow was about to be dealt 
on Cyprus by the Greek Cypriot National Guard units under the 
command of Greek officers. They prevented the island from being 
turned into a Greek colony and saved the Turkish Cypriots from 
being destroyed. Denktas recalled that the Cyprus problem was 
created by the Greek Cypriot partner of the Cyprus Republic when 
it destroyed the partnership republic through armed force and 
declared itself the Cyprus Government. He said: The 
prolongation of the Cyprus problem until now is due to the 
world's failure to inform the Greek Cypriot side that it does 
not represent the government of all Cyprus. 
  Criticizing Kliridhis for urging the UN Security Council to 
implement its resolutions on Cyprus, Denktas said: The 
resolutions that refer to the Cyprus Government are not valid. 
They cannot be implemented. A move to implement them will not 
contribute to the establishment of peace in Cyprus. On the 
contrary, it will create an unresolvable chaotic situation in 
the island.

  [Text] Greece's role for the achievement of peace in 
Bosnia-Herzegovina can be useful. This is the evaluation of new 
Yugoslavia Foreign Minister Vladislav Jovanovic, who arrived 
this afternoon in Athens. 
  [Begin recording] [Unidentified correspondent] Greek Foreign 
Minister Karolos Papoulias and Yugoslav Foreign Minister 
Jovanovic are expected to discuss the situation in the former 
Yugoslavia and the general situation in the Balkans. We will 
examine ways to dissipate the clouds over the area, Jovanovic 
said. The Yugoslav foreign minister appeared optimistic and 
expressed the belief that in the end logic will prevail. He 
also did not fail to stress that Greece and Yugoslavia are 
positive factors of stability in the Balkans. 
  [Jovanovic, through interpreter] We believe that Greece's 
role can be useful in working toward maintaining peace in our 
region and toward the promotion of peaceful processes as was the 
case in the past and is now. 
  [Papoulias] In a difficult period for our region, I think 
that this meeting is necessary and indispensable due to the 
developments. [end recording]

  [Text] UN mediator Cyrus Vance is trying to achieve a 
compromise between Greece and Skopje [The Former Yugoslav 
Republic of Macedonia--FYROM] through goodwill moves. This was 
evident after Vance's meeting with Ambassador Khristos 
Zakharakis, who repeated that the embargo against Skopje will be 
lifted only when Greece's conditions are accepted. 
  [Begin recording] [Correspondent Athanasios Ellis from New 
York] Ambassador Khristos Zakharakis, Foreign Ministry director 
general, and UN mediator Cyrus Vance had a substantive meeting 
just a short while ago. During the meeting, Zakharakis repeated 
Athens' position on lifting the measures against Skopje if 
Greece's three conditions are accepted. Vance, who appears 
determined to achieve an end to the current stalemate, appears 
to be trying to achieve some kind of compromise in the framework 
of which the two sides will proceed simultaneously with goodwill 
moves. As to such moves, diplomatic circles think that Greece 
should lift the economic measures and Skopje should declare its 
intention to abolish the star of Veryina from its flag and 
change the disputed articles in its Constitution. The 
international mediator is also trying to get the positions of 
the two countries to agree on the other point of dispute 
regarding whether the talks should include the issue of the 
name, as Skopje demands, or whether we should remain with the 
confidence-building measures at the current phase, as Athens 
demands. Following the meeting, Zakharakis said that he will 
brief the Greek Government and return on Monday. He also 
stressed that during the meeting with Vance, they discussed all 
the details of the problem. 
  Zakharakis, who met yesterday with U.S. Special Envoy 
Matthew 
Nimetz, also referred to the meeting scheduled between Greek 
Foreign Minister Karolos Papoulias and Vance during Prime 
Minister Andreas Papandreou's visit to the United States. 
Consequently, Vance will continue his contacts with the two 
side on Monday. [end recording]

  [Excerpt] Prime Minister and PASOK [Panhellenic Socialist 
Movement] Chairman Andreas Papandreou's address at the party 
congress, which began at noon today at the Athens Olympic 
Stadium with the participation of 4,436 delegates from Greece 
and overseas, was a message of unity and optimism. Papandreou's 
address also included a political message regarding our 
country's position in Europe but mainly in the Balkans. 
  For PASOK to continue its direction, Papandreou said, it 
must 
be revived. We must realize the big changes and contradictions 
of the times and give answers with our philosophy and political 
practice, he said. A party, Papandreou continued, which works 
as a human-centered society cannot be a party of mechanisms, it 
is a figure of autonomous people. 
  Papandreou said PASOK's orientation is, of course, European 
but stressed that we are not Europe's poor partner. We are 
Europe's arm in the Balkans, its eastern border, he said. 
Papandreou blamed Europe for the tragedy in the former 
Yugoslavia, talked about the revival of suffering and regional 
hostilities and said that these clashes are cultivated by the 
big powers to promote their special interests. With a tone of 
optimism for the future, Papandreou said that wars and the 
economic crisis cannot cancel, can only delay for a while, the 
impressive development at the doorstep of which we find 
ourselves. Following is that specific part of Papandreou's 
address: 
  [Begin Papandreou recording] We follow the tragedy of war in 
the former Yugoslavia with fear. We resist the attempt to 
revive ancient Balkan disputes and serve the big powers' 
shortsighted goals. However, no resistance can hide the fact 
that the Greeks have begun to find their natural role in the 
Balkans. Half of the foreign investments in Bulgaria now are 
Greek. In Albania, Greek companies have set up 54 joint 
companies and we are second after Italy. In Romania, there are 
700 joint Greek-Romanian companies. The Balkans's greater area 
calls on Greece. The Greeks, who throughout their history have 
stood as a factor of progress and civilization in the Balkans 
under historical conditions that are incomparably more difficult 
that today's, are preparing, in cooperation with the peoples of 
the Balkans, to rediscover their old position. [end recording] 
  Papandreou said that we should again discover our historic 
optimism and added that PASOK's revival is firmly connected with 
the restoration of political life in the country. The primary 
role in this difficult mission belongs to the youth, Papandreou 
stressed. 
  [Begin Papandreou recording] PASOK's revival is firmly 
connected with the revival and restoration of political life, 
not only of ideas, positions, platforms and choices, but mainly 
of institutions, norms and practices. It is an issue that 
regards the present and future of democracy and its principles. 
Through this road, Greek youth and politics will be reunited. 
It will be a necessary meeting for Greece itself. The country 
moves ahead only when the youth are in the national and 
political foreground, only then. [passage omitted] [end 
recording]

  [Text] 
<H8>  Greek Governments Responsible for Greece'sInability To </H8>
Serve as Link Between East and West 
  The relative advantage that Greece sought to secure by 
participating in the trans-European networks of transportation, 
telecommunications, and energy, seems at present almost 
impossible to attain. It does not seem probable that Greece will 
become a significant link between East and West -- and the 
burden of responsibility for this state of affairs rests upon 
the Greek side. 
  It took nothing less than last week's declaration by EC 
delegate Mr. Matutes to the effect that the Commission is indeed 
keen on the construction of an alternative road which will 
bypass Egnatia Odhos, for Greek authorities to recognize the 
construction of "our own" Egnatia Road as a most urgent matter. 
So slow has the Greek side been in acting to obtain 
incorporation of the Egnatia route into the trans-European 
networks that its fate is still languishing in indecision. It 
must also be noted that, in the context of discussions on this 
subject by the "Christofersen team," other member nations are 
strongly opposed to such an incorporation of the Egnatia. 
  The construction -- which many sources consider already 
imminently probable -- of a "counter-Egnatia Road," will destroy 
Egnatia's privilege of being the exclusive carrier of West-bound 
goods from the East. The construction of a route connecting 
Varna with Dirrachion, which all our northern neighbors are 
energetically aiming for, will attract a significant percentage 
of transport activity, thus turning Egnatia into a minor route 
of minor significance. This is bound to happen even when 
Egnatia's inclusion in the trans-European transport system is 
fully assured. 
  In the race of the European nations to exploit the political 
and economic opportunities now being created by the unification 
of "Old Continent" networks, our country is unprepared and short 
of breath. Nor is this inability to participate advantageously 
in the trans-European networks limited to transportation. Having 
been too slow to act, Greece is no longer capable of securing 
the passage of basic telecommunications and energy lines through 
its territory. In particular, any possibility for telephone 
networks seems to be definitively lost, since the basic axis 
linking East and West through the Balkans will have to pass 
north of our border. Moreover, the country is facing a serious 
danger of becoming marginalized with respect to energy networks 
as well. 
  The responsibility for this emerging situation lies to a 
very 
large extent on the Greek side, not only because Greece acted 
too slowly in regard to networks passing through it, but also, 
and most significantly, because it did not prepare itself to 
enter this united market. The previous government remained 
unaware of how important the unification of trans-European 
networks was for the political and economic life of Greece. It 
therefore failed to cultivate its opportunities for 
participation. The present government, likewise, seemed to be 
taken by surprise at the rapidity of developments and our 
neighbors' more fruitful efforts in this domain. It is accurate 
to say that, since transportation, energy, and 
telecommunications networks are the primary means for Greece to 
preserve its ties with the other nations of the European Union, 
our country has a vital interest in their development. 
  As has been mentioned, Greece's inadequate preparation for 
participating in the trans-European networks is the primary 
reason for its inability to develop the opportunity to its 
advantage. The individual networks marked for inclusion in the 
overall unification program of trans-European systems are 
railways, roads, telecommunications, electricity, and natural 
gas. To date, Greek efforts along any of these lines have given 
only disappointing results. 
<H5>  Natural Gas </H5>
  The natural gas pipeline which meets the corresponding 
Bulgarian one at the border is the only link presently projected 
between our country and any other corresponding trans-European 
network. An older proposal to provide Skopje with Russian 
natural gas piped through Greece has now been abandoned: our 
neighbor is in the process of finalizing the investments which 
will allow it to import gas through Bulgaria. 
  The possibility of a link-up with Albania which would allow 
it to get Russian gas through Greece remains viable. According 
to reliable sources, such a link-up is still under 
consideration, and the Community seems to be in favor of it. The 
fact that southern Albania exhibits significant industrial 
activity -- which in turn implies the presence of potential 
consumers of gas -- makes it financially advantageous to provide 
our neighbor with gas from Greece since costly investments to 
construct conduits of great length within Albania would not be 
necessary. Of course, if this proposal goes through, it will 
require not only Greek investment capital to bring the pipeline 
to the Greco-Albanian border, but also the modification of 
energy-related policies to assure the consumption of natural gas 
by large-scale consumers in northwestern Greece. Only in this 
manner will the profitability of the project be safeguarded. 
<H5>  Railroads </H5>
  To truly implement the European Union, it is necessary to 
connect the individual national railroads to form a single, 
continuous, high-speed network, about 30,000 km long. (Speeds of 
200-300 km/hr have already been achieved in many cases.) 
  Construction of this high-speed European network is neither 
planned nor undertaken centrally. Instead, the national railroad 
companies are individually responsible for the planning and 
construction of each national network, to be carried out in 
conformity with certain basic agreements applying to all. 
  Two Greek railroad lines have been incorporated into this 
network: that of Athens-Thessaloniki-Eidomeni (which includes 
the detour Larissa-Volos), and that of Athens-Corinth-Patra. Any 
activities undertaken to date in order to further the creation 
of a Greek high-speed network have been woefully inadequate and 
create a most disappointing picture of the Greek railroads. 
  This lackadaisical attitude towards the development of the 
rail links in Greece is indeed nothing less than astonishing. 
Especially so since the obstacles that non-EC countries at times 
set up in order to hamper our transit to Europe present us with 
a motivation for finding and using mixed transportation 
solutions combining, for example, railway transport with boats 
or trucks. 
  It is worth noting that in modern harbors, mixed transit of 
this sort makes up the greater part of all transportation 
activity. Available statistics indicate that it constitutes 40 
percent of all movement at Le Havre, 60 percent at Hamburg, and 
70 percent at Bremen. 
  An estimated 400,000 railroad cars go through the Straits of 
Messina at Sicily every year, while in Denmark the Danlink line 
-- a collaborative effort among Denmark, Sweden, and Germany -- 
moves a total of 2 million tons per year. 
<H8>  A Hope for Greece: The Egnatia Road </H8>
  The state of the highway network in Greece is characterized 
by the inadequacy of the roads connecting western and 
northwestern Greece with the eastern, central, and northern 
parts of the country, by the seasonal interruptions of many 
connections, and by the low level of safety on the roads. 
  In spite of these conditions, the percentage of 
appropriations allocated for a number of years to both the 
national and regional road systems has been desperately 
inadequate. Characteristically, since the completion, in 1970, 
of the national highways Athens-Thessaloniki, 
Athens-Corinth-Patra, Andirrion-Ioannina, and of the northern 
network of Crete, no projects of similar importance have been 
accomplished. The subsequent works of Patra-Pirgos, 
Thessaloniki-Kavala, and Corinth-Tripolis are not comparable to 
the works of the 1970's. Aspirations concerning Greece's 
participation in trans-European transport systems do not extend 
beyond visions of the Egnatia Odhos, while hopes for road 
improvement and the construction of basic highway networks are 
left hanging upon the notorious "Delors II package." 
  The principal works projected by the Package are the 
following: 

  -  The Egnatia Odhos which will consist of a 
highway length of 400 km and will incorporate 200 km of existing 
national roadways, bringing the total to 600 km. 
  -  The national 
highway of Patra-Athens-Thessaloniki-Eidomeni. 
  -  The road system 
of northern Crete. 
  -  The western Mediterranean system of 
Ioannina-Andirrio-Rio-Patra-Pirgos-Kalamata. 
  -  The system of 
Corinth-Tripoli-Kalamata (constituting supplementary works). 
  Most of these projects are still only on paper. The section 
from Yliki to Katerini, to which 460 billion drachmae had been 
allotted, absorbed only 5 billion in 1993 -- an amount identical 
to that absorbed by the section of the Egnatia Odhos from 
Igoumenitsa to Kavala, which had had 500 billion allotted to it. 
The section from Andirrio to Igoumenitsa -- which had been 
budgeted at 120 billion -- absorbed last year only 2 billion 
drachmae. 
<H5>  The Delay </H5>
  A 10-year delay in the construction of roads connecting 
eastern with western Greece, and especially in the construction 
of the Egnatia, is responsible for the serious inefficiency of 
our transport networks connecting us to Europe. The situation is 
much aggravated by the war in former Yugoslavia. 
<H8>  Telecommunications Arc Beyond the Border </H8>
  Forecasts concerning the possibility that Greece may 
participate in trans-European telecommunications networks are 
not encouraging. The hope that Greece might play the role of a 
telecommunications link within the wider Balkans and the Middle 
East seems altogether unrealizable. Recently it was learned that 
the European Commission is studying an fiber optic system that 
will connect Italy and Turkey by passing through Skopje and 
Bulgaria. In this manner a "telecommunications arc" extending, 
on the one hand, into the countries of the former Soviet Union, 
and on the other, toward the Turco-Cypriot pseudonation, will be 
created beyond our northern border. 
<H5>  Electricity </H5>
  The possibility of Greece connecting with European 
electricity networks is gloomily slim. Of the three countries 
with which we share a border to the north, Albania does not have 
a connection with Europe to date, Greece's connection through 
former Yugoslavia has been cut off because of the war, and a 
connection through Bulgaria is not feasible due to the special 
characteristics of its own grid. This means that at present, 
Greece is completely cut off from the electricity networks of 
West Europe. The problem becomes aggravated because of the 
shortage of electric energy which Greece currently faces and 
which, under certain circumstances, makes it mandatory to import 
electricity. 
  The underwater cable which will link the Greek electricity 
grid with Italy has been registered as one of the trans-European 
networks. In spite of the initial optimism over this prospect, 
however, the advantages of the connection appear to be extremely 
limited. To begin with, the Community considers this investment 
to be only part of a larger package which includes a similar 
connection between Greece and Turkey, in anticipation of 
Turkey's eventual participation in the unified electrical 
networks of Europe. Acting as an intermediary between Turkey and 
Europe could prove to be politically and financially 
advantageous for our country, yet only on condition that this 
tripartite connection of Turkey, Greece, and Italy be the 
primary, if not the only, such connection. 
  It has recently been learned that a similar project to 
connect Turkey with European sources of electrical energy by 
going through our northern neighbors is now being worked out. In 
the context of this project, an agreement to link Albania and 
Italy by underwater cable has already been signed. This 
investment, moreover, will cost much less than the corresponding 
Greco-Italian cable, because of the shorter distance and the 
shallower waters between those two countries. The new line under 
consideration will connect Turkey with Italy by going through 
Bulgaria-Skopje-Albania. Thus, even in the case of electrical 
networks, Greece is being marginalized. And this marginalization 
becomes more sharply felt thanks to the electrical shortage that 
Greece faces at present. Put differently, the danger exists that 
Greece will not only not function as the intermediary between 
Italy and Turkey, but that the Greco-Turkish network will be 
used only for importing electrical energy from our neighbor in 
order to cover our own shortage. In a similar way the underwater 
cable between Greece and Italy will probably be used by the 
Public Power Corporation [DEH] for imports from the West 
European countries.

  [Text] Ankara, April 14 (A.A.) -- Interior Minister Nahit 
Mentese on Thursday [14 April] said that Syrian President Hafiz 
al-Asad assured him that if necessary PKK [Workers Party of 
Kurdistan] terrorists near the border would be arrested. 
  He was speaking to reporters in the plane on his way back 
from Syria where he met with al-Asad to discuss security issues. 
  Mentese said that he has also asked for the return of the 
chief of the PKK terrorist organization, Abdullah Ocalan. 
  During the three-hour meeting, al-Asad brought up the 
subject 
of water, to which Mentese said that there was no need to worry 
on this issue. 
  He said that he has stressed time and time again that the 
terrorist chief is organizing ethnic groups in Turkey by 
ordering them either from Syria or Lebanon, but al-Asad neither 
confirmed nor rejected this. 
  "At the leaders" level, Turkey has asked for the return of 
the PKK terrorist chief and the members of the terrorist 
organization,' he said. 
  Mentese said Greece is among those backing the PKK and it 
was 
determined that that country is making efforts to hinder Turkish 
tourism and this is an inhuman behavior. 
  "It does not fit friendly or neighborly relations," he 
added.

  [Text] Ankara, April 14 (A.A.) -- The Turkish Armed Forces 
struck terrorist bases in northern Iraq's Mezi region and have 
killed at least 80 PKK [Workers Party of Kurdistan] terrorists, 
it was reported on Thursday [14 April]. 
  The Anatolian Agency learned that it was determined that a 
group of 500 to 600 terrorists were preparing to cross the 
border from northern Iraq on April 12. Acting upon this 
information, the Turkish Armed Forces started operations in the 
region with Air Force cover. Chief of Staff Gen. Dogan Gures, 
accompanied by Air Force Commander Gen. Halis Burhan and 
Gendarmerie Force Commander Gen. Aydin Ilter went to Diyarbakir 
earlier in the day. 
  Gures will be briefed on the operations by security forces 
in 
Mezi region as well as in the rural regions of Tendurek, Gabar 
[place-name as received], Diyarbakir and Bingol. 
  Operations are still continuing, officials said.

<F P=106> [Report by Barcin Yinanc: "Russia Causes Uneasiness in </F>
Ankara"] 
  [Text] Ankara--It has been reported that Turkey continues 
to be concerned about Russia's intention to violate the 
Conventional Forces in Europe [CFE] Treaty. Russia's deployment 
of troops in the Caucasus, particularly over the past three 
months, has made Ankara uneasy. Turkey has reportedly cautioned 
its allies several times about the presence of Russian troops in 
the region, who are violating the CFE limits on the presence of 
military units in the southern region. 
  Officials who have been closely following Russia's efforts 
to 
revise the CFE limits in the southern region say that Russia's 
military buildup in the northern Caucasus and its moves to 
strengthen its military presence in Georgia and Armenia have 
caused concern. The officials said: "Russia's military 
presence in the Caucasus will significantly exceed the CFE 
limits if the present trend is allowed to continue." 
  Meanwhile, Georgia and Armenia, who have allowed Russia to 
establish military bases on their territory, reportedly have 
been cautioned both bilaterally and multilaterally on the 
problems they may confront if their military presence exceeds 
the CFE limits. Stressing that Georgia and Armenia must view the 
presence of Russian forces on their territory within the 
framework of the CFE limits on their own military forces, the 
officials said: "That means that Georgia and Armenia will have 
to reduce their own military forces, which would have a negative 
impact on their independence and sovereignty."

<F P=106> [Statement by President Suleyman Demirel, dated 14 April </F>
1994 -- read by announcer over still of Demirel] 
  [Text] Turkey is a constitutional state. The Constitution 
determines the type of state and regime. The state is based on 
rules and institutions. No one has the power to forcibly change 
that. The state has the power and the solutions to protect 
itself, the tranquillity of the people, the democratic regime, 
and the indivisible unity of the country and nation. Everything 
transpires on the basis of the law and of legitimacy. No one 
should even dream of achieving anything by resorting to force or 
by violating the law at the cost of blood and tears. Such 
efforts fall outside the law and legitimacy and are incompatible 
with humanity or a clear conscience. In such cases, the state 
resorts to legitimate measures and solutions to prevent 
violence, brute force, and bloodshed. 
  The state, with all its institutions, is fully aware of its 
duties and ready to carry them out. The people follow 
everything closely. Institutions, establishments, and persons 
who owe their existence to the democratic system should not make 
use of the freedom it gives them to threaten or undermine the 
secular and democratic Turkish Republican State or democracy. 
  I ask my citizens to remain levelheaded in the face of 
irresponsible acts and statements. Everyone must continue to 
trust our state and the secular and democratic Turkish Republic.

  [Text] Ankara, April 14 (A.A.) -- The Public Partnership 
Administration (KOI), the state body for privatization, put new 
state shares on sale on Thursday [14 April] to reach the 
government's 1994 revenue target of 3.5 billion dollars. 
  The administration announced a tender for the sale of its 
100 
percent stake in the Petlas Tire Company, which the government 
plans to close unless it is privatized. 
  Officials said KOI would invite offers for 12 establishments 
of the textiles producer Sumer Holding on Friday and 32 concerns 
of the milk and dairy products producer SEK and two hotels of 
the tourism firm Turban later this month. 
  Officials said KOI planned to privatize 10 major companies 
partly or wholly this year to achieve the target. 
  They are: PETKIM petrochemicals, TUPRAS oil refining firm, 
petrol retailer POAS, Sumerbank, Turban Hotel and Marina chain, 
Eregli Iron and Steel Firm, Turkish Airlines, oil [word 
indistinct] DITAS, Turkish Maritime Company and ground-service 
firm HAVAS. 
  A parliamentary commission adopted a draft law that would 
enable the government to handle privatization by decree to 
shorten the complex sell-off procedures. 
  The draft, to be enacted by the parliament, will also open 
the way for KOI's reorganization and accumulation of sell-off 
proceeds in a separate fund to set up an unemployment scheme for 
laid-off workers. 
  The government unveiled an austerity package this month to 
rescue the country's economy. The program calls for new one-off 
taxes, rapid privatization, closure of some state firms, selling 
public property and tightening control on state expenditures.

<F P=106> [Article by Semih D. Idiz: "Refah's Foreign Policy Outlook"] </F>
  [Text] As the success of Refah (the Welfare Party-RP) 
following Sunday's [27 March] local elections sent shock waves 
around the country, arousing fears among the overwhelmingly 
secular majority of the electorate which had split its 80 
percent of votes among the various secular parties contesting 
the election, foreign diplomats in Ankara were busily trying to 
interpret what this startling victory by such an intensely 
pro-Islamic -- if not outright fundamentalist -- party meant in 
terms of Turkey's future. 
  Asked during his press conference in Ankara, the day after 
it 
became certain that his party had taken the mayoral posts in 
Istanbul and the Turkish capital, about how the West should view 
his party's victory, RP leader Necmettin Erbakan said very 
openly that the fact that his party was coming to power was "a 
very important event for the whole world." 
  "We believe that Westerners are clever enough to consider 
what is to their own interests. No one should act in a 
prejudicial manner... a bankrupt Turkey will constitute a weight 
for the West. But a strong and economically sound Turkey is good 
for the West as well" he said. 
  "But compared to relations today our government will have 
one 
difference. The West, which today sees Turkey as a servant and 
issues its orders over the phone will have to think, what will 
Turkey say? when it is about to take any decision while we are 
in power" Erbakan added. 
  Concealed in these words may have been an attempt at trying 
to reassure the West that it could have normal relations with a 
Turkey run by the pro-Islamic RP, provided it restrained its 
prejudices and treated Turkey with the respect that Erbakan 
believes it is not receiving today. 
  But despite this attempt at reassurance, a defiance aimed at 
the West is, nevertheless, clearly and unmistakably discernible 
in the RP leader's words. 
  Of course the RP is not in power today or anywhere close to 
it at the present time although it has expanded its popular base 
in these local elections. There are over two and a half years 
to go to the next general elections -- provided early elections 
are not announced -- which are due to be held in the fall of 
1996, and the parties that lost out in Sunday's local elections 
have time to recover if they opt for sensible policies and leave 
behind the policies that have alienated them from the masses. 
  There can be no doubt, however, that the RP will work day in 
and day out until those elections in order to build on its 
victory at these local elections which have indicated that it 
can command nearly 20 percent of the overall nationwide vote at 
the present time. Neither can there be any doubt that Sunday's 
results have placed this party firmly on Turkey's political 
panorama with an influence that it has not had in the past 
although it has been around since the late 1960's under one name 
or another. 
  Given this fact it appears necessary to try and piece 
together what we know of the RP's outlook on relations with the 
outside world. 
  Firstly there can be no doubt that it is intensely anti-West 
in its general outlook even though Erbakan is a German educated 
engineer. 
  It has made this clear in the most open terms at every 
occasion that it has grabbed, and if it is now appearing to use 
seemingly conciliatory words of reassurance this is only the 
result of an unavoidable pragmatism dictated by circumstance. 
  Thus, for example, Necmettin Erbakan has consistently been a 
strong opponent of the idea of Turkey ever becoming a member of 
the European Union. He opposed this idea when it was the 
European Economic Community, he opposed it when it was the 
European Community, and he opposes it now when it is the EU 
[European Union]. Neither has he wasted any opportunity to rub 
in what he terms "The West's refusal to admit Turkey in its 
midst after Ankara's full application to the EC and the "avis" 
[opinion] this received from Brussels. [no end quotation mark as 
published] 
  Thus every time there is a rebuffing of Turkey by the West 
the RP has been delighted and has used it against the 
government. But this opposition to the West by the RP has 
nothing to do with intense nationalistic sympathies as might be 
assumed. It is has to do with the overall Christian character 
of Europe, a character which is seen as being at odds with the 
islamic world in an irreconcilable way. 
  It must be kept in mind that what is predominant for the 
type of Islam that the RP ultimately represents -- although it 
is not convenient for its followers to admit this at the present 
time -- is not nationalism as such but the "Ummar," i.e., the 
"Islamic collective" which recognized no boundaries within its 
own borders. 
  This makes the RP see its relations with other Islamic 
countries, especially those run by the all encapsulating Islamic 
judicial code, the Shari'ah -- as in the case of the oil rich 
Gulf states -- in a completely different light to relations with 
the Christian West. 
  To accuse it of hypocrisy for criticising the current 
secular 
and Kemalist regime in Turkey of being attached to an un-Turkish 
Western lifestyle, while it itself is so attached to the 
"un-Turkish East" is in this sense irrelevant for the RP. It is 
irrelevant because for its followers the "Islamic East" is not 
"outside" or "abroad" in the way that the Christian West is. It 
is only an "extension" of Islamic Turkey -- or Islamic Turkey is 
an extension of the Islamic East. 
  Another characteristic of the RP is that it is intensely 
anti- Jewish and anti-Zionist, but not in a racist anti-Semitic 
way. 
  It sees the Jews, "with their seditious Zionism," and their 
state of Israel as "an instrument of the West which is like a 
piercing and sharp dagger stuck in the belly of the Islamic 
Ummah." 
  As a phenomenon which is considered to have proved its 
"hellish enmity to Islam" in the pain and suffering it is said 
to be meting out to the Palestinians, the Jewish state is seen 
by many RP followers as something that must be eradicated at all 
costs because it is the embodiment of evil. 
  Baruch Goldstein, who massacred praying Palestinians in 
Hebron, has in one sense done the Islamic ideologues in Turkey 
something of a service during their critical election campaign. 
Even where some Arab countries have come around to seeking 
means of a rapprochement with Israel, the RP will have none of 
this, seeing the recent accord between the Jewish state and the 
Palestinian Liberation Organization as a sell out of the 
Palestinian people. 
  Considering PLO leader Yasir 'Arafat a traitor and an 
instrument of Israel, the RP is closer to the Hamas [Islamic 
Resistance Movement] movement that it admires as a "people's 
movement" which it sees itself as also being. 
  All this does not, however, cover some of the RP's 
contradictions in terms of its relations with the outside world 
and other countries. 
  For example it will not have anything bad said about Saudi 
Arabia, from where it receives massive amounts of material and 
moral support, even though this country allowed itself to be 
converted into a massive aircraft carrier for the West during 
the Gulf War against Iraq, with the infidel male and female 
soldiers trotting up and down holy lands and doing Allah only 
knows what... 
  Neither will Erbakan have anything bad said about Germany 
even if this is a country where there is a resurgence of 
xenophobia and fatal violence against God fearing Moslem Turks. 
In both cases the lowest common denominator, leading the RP 
leader to taking such a docile stance even though his basic 
Islamic philosophy should make him scream with anger, appears to 
be money. 
  While he is known to harbour a secret admiration for 
Germany, 
where he studied as a young man and even worked as an engineer 
in Krupps, he knows this country is also a major source of 
income for his party from Turkish sympathizers working and 
living there. This is something that he would hardly want to 
endanger. Like Germany, Saudi Arabia is also a source of income 
which merits a blind eye to some inconsistencies such as this 
country's extremely close ties with the United States. 
  Now that it has felt its strength based on popular support 
there is no doubt that the RP will want to make its views on a 
large number of issues known more vocally in the coming period. 
Its views on a host of foreign policy questions should also 
become more clear as it does so. 
  What is certain is that everything it says to this end will 
be noted down fervently by all in a general attempt to 
understand where Turkey might head if the RP really did come to 
power one day.

  [Text] Brussels/Vienna -- Foreign Minister Alois Mock in 
Brussels on Wednesday [13 April] advocated a stronger European 
Parliament [EP]. Austria would actively support this as a 
member of the European Union [EU], Mock said before the group of 
the European People's Party. On the same day, the 800-page text 
of the treaty of accession was delivered to the members of 
parliament. Mock appealed to the deputies: "Vote for Austria 
on 4 May! In this way, you will create the decisive 
prerequisite for us to jointly develop the Europe of tomorrow." 
  Chancellor Franz Vranitzky also wooed the Europeans. In a 
letter, the Social Democratic Party of Austria chairman politely 
asked his party colleagues to advocate sufficient participation 
of the Social Democratic members of the European Parliament in 
the decisive vote. 
  Moreover, Vranitzky asked Vice Chancellor Busek to step in 
for him at the hearing of the four candidate countries before 
the European Parliament in Strasbourg on Tuesday, since he will 
be unable to attend because of his meeting with U.S. President 
Bill Clinton.

<F P=106> [Unattributed report: "Council of Europe/Zhirinovskiy: </F>
Russia's Frontiers Are Not Fixed"] 
  [Text] Strasbourg, 12 Apr 94 (AGENCE EUROPE) -- The new 
delegation of 18 Russian parliamentarians that enjoys special 
guest status at the Parliamentary Assembly caused quite a stir 
from the very opening of the sitting because of the presence of 
ultranationalist Vladimir Zhirinovskiy who provoked several 
incidents. He first of all tried to enter a room where a meeting 
of the Liberal Group was being held (which had refused to let 
him participate), and then let fly vindictive remarks aimed at 
the French authorities because they had issued him with a 
restricted visa. Mr. Vladimir Shumeyko, Deputy Chairman of the 
Council of Ministers, spoke at the opening of the sitting. He 
once more appealed for swift accession by Russia to the Council 
of Europe, which would constitute recognition of the 
"irreversible choice for democracy and human rights" made by his 
country. He stressed that the organisation cannot become truly 
pan-European until Russia is part of it, and that accession 
would naturally lead to greater reform. This, however, is not 
Mr. Zhirinovskiy's opinion. He considered the Council of Europe 
should understand that the delegation sent to Strasbourg 
represents the "losers" of the last elections, and that he, 
alone, represented the winners. In his view, "most deputies 
want neither NATO nor the Council of Europe." He said Russia was 
more "advanced" than the Council of Europe: "We have overtaken 
you (...) We have more rights and liberties than your Member 
States," he said. He went on to say that the Council of Europe 
encompasses countries like Turkey which bombs Kurd villages and 
the United Kingdom that inflicts a bloodbath on Northern 
Ireland, while NATO bombs the Serbs. In his opinion, NATO 
should be dissolved and the Council of Europe should not speak 
to Russia with the "tone of mentors" as it is the Council that 
should conform to Russian norms and not the other way round. 
"You should pay us for all the revolutions you have stirred up 
over the past 75 years (...) and for having inoculated us with 
the virus of communism," he added before going on to conclude: 
"We do not yet know where Russia's frontiers are.... You will 
have to accept them once we have decided."

<F P=106> [By Padraic Flanagan, PRESS ASSOCIATION news correspondent] </F>
  [Text] Two British officers were feared to be among those 
who died when U.S. jets shot down two UN helicopters above 
northern Iraq, Defence Secretary Malcolm Rifkind said today. 
  Mr Rifkind, who offered his condolences to the men's 
relatives, told the Radio Four PM programme: "Clearly it is a 
matter of great tragedy. Great sympathy is extended to them." 
  Mr Rifkind, speaking during an official visit to the United 
States, said: "We know that these people have lost their lives 
carrying out their duty in a very difficult situation. I 
believe it's appropriate that we should all therefore wish to 
pay tribute to them." 
  The Ministry of Defence [MoD] in London said it was still 
seeking details about the British casualties. More than 20 
people are believed to have been aboard the two helicopters. 
  The MoD was refusing to release the names of the dead 
personnel until next of kin were informed. One report said the 
Britons were a colonel and a major. 
  The servicemen were part of the British contingent making up 
a defence coalition with the United States and France set up to 
protect Kurds in northern Iraq. A MoD spokesman said: "We have 
been in the area since the Gulf war. We're there with our 
allies providing a degree of safety for the Kurdish people. The 
no-fly zone was imposed to give the Kurds in the area practical 
protection." 
  He declined to comment on the numbers of British forces 
personnel serving in the area.

  [Text] Bonn (DDP/ADN) -- German Chancellor Helmut Kohl has 
promised Poland support from Germany on its path to the European 
Union [EU]. After a meeting with Polish Prime Minister Waldemar 
Pawlak, Kohl told journalists in Bonn today that he will be 
starting initiatives to this effect during Germany's EU 
presidency. Poland's application to join the EU played an 
important part in the talks with Pawlak. 
  Kohl stressed that Poland has made considerable progress in 
its economic reforms over the past few years. Germany wants to 
support that process as far as possible. The chancellor said he 
has always resisted any suggestion that Germany's eastern 
borders could represent the EU's border in the future. It is 
therefore important for Poland, like the Czech Republic, 
Slovakia, and Hungary, to find its way to the EU. However, the 
decision on EU membership rests in the first instance with those 
countries themselves. 
  Kohl stressed that German-Polish relations have developed 
positively over the past years. The task for the future is to 
achieve equally trusting and good-neighborly relations with 
Poland as exist with France.

  [Text] Bonn (DDP/ADN) -- Chancellor Helmut Kohl has 
stressed the importance of Polish accession to the European 
Union (EU). Following a meeting with Polish Prime Minister 
Waldemar Pawlak, Kohl told reporters in Bonn today that without 
Poland, Europe would be a "torso." It is important for Poland 
to find the path to the EU. Germany intends to support the 
economic reform process in Poland with all its power. 
  Kohl said he had "a very good and intensive meeting" with 
Pawlak. This is important, because German-Polish relations are 
of vital significance for Europe, too. German-Polish relations 
have made positive progress, but can be improved further. 
  Many steps are still necessary on Poland's path to the EU. 
Kohl intends to submit proposals on this during the German EU 
presidency from 1 July. Pawlak, who is staying in Germany for 
the first time in his capacity as Polish prime minister, 
expressed the hope that the integration process will make good 
progress. 
  The chancellor also stressed that he is passionately 
fighting 
against any suggestion that Poland's western border should 
become the EU's eastern border. 
  Kohl and Pawlak also discussed the situation at the 
German-Polish border, where time and again there are long lines. 
Pawlak pointed out that it is a question of the border not just 
between Poland and Germany, but also with the EU. Both sides 
also called for an increase in the number of meetings between 
young people from Germany and Poland. 
  Pawlak is to visit Baden-Wuerttemberg tomorrow (Friday).

<F P=106> [Report by Sten Jensen: "Denmark Will Help Latvia To Get </F>
Rid of Russian Soldiers"] 
  [Text] Denmark will lead the way in establishing a 
European fund which will help Latvia to get rid of the Russian 
soldiers in the country and then sort things out after them. 
  The fund will provide support for the actual withdrawal and 
for pensioned officers from the Russian army. The money will 
also be used to clean up the military areas the Russians leave 
behind. 
  This was one of the promises from Foreign Minister Niels 
Helveg Petersen (Radical Liberal) to a very worried President 
Guntis Ulmanis who visited Copenhagen yesterday. 
  But Niels Helveg Petersen declined to say how much Denmark 
will give to the "cleanup" fund. What is most important is to 
get it set up, the minister said. 
  The visit of the Latvian president comes as a reaction to 
increasingly tense relations between Latvia and Russia. 
  On 5 April President Boris Yeltsin gave his approval to a 
plan according to which Russia will establish permanent bases, 
including one in Latvia. This has since been described as a 
"technical error" by a Yeltsin spokesman and Russia's ambassador 
in Latvia has apologized. 
  But President Guntis Ulmanis wants an explanation and a 
retraction from Yeltsin and believes that in the meantime the 
message from Yeltsin is: "A warning -- and not only to Latvia." 
And President Guntis Ulmanis will seek backing for his view in 
Paris and London as well as Copenhagen. 
  For his part Foreign Minister Niels Helveg Petersen 
described 
the declaration from Yeltsin as: "Mystifying and totally 
unacceptable to Denmark and the international community." An 
agreement on the withdrawal of the approximately 10,000 Russian 
troops from Latvia by the end of August this year was to have 
been signed on 20 April. But after Yeltsin's "base declaration" 
of 5 April Guntis Ulmanis cancelled his visit to Moscow. 
  Another unresolved issue between Russia and Latvia is the 
closure of a large radar station at Skrunda. By way of 
compromise the Latvians are willing to allow the Russians to 
keep it for four years.

  [Text] Copenhagen, April 14 (AFP) -- Estonian President 
Lennart Meri called on the international community here Thursday 
[14 April] to support his demands for the "unconditional 
withdrawal" of Russian troops from his country by an August 31 
deadline. 
  Meri told reporters on the last day of his official visit to 
Denmark: "Estonia will do everything humanly possible to make 
sure this deadline, recognised by the international community, 
is respected." 
  He said the Danish government had promised him active 
support 
in his fight for the withdrawal of some 2,700 Russian soldiers 
still stationed in Estonia. 
  Estonia is the last of the three now independent Baltic 
states annexed by Russia in 1940 which has so far failed to 
agree to an end to the Russian military presence there. 
  The last Russian troops left Lithuania last August 31, while 
Latvia in March signed an agreement with Russia for Red Army 
soldiers to leave by August 31 this year. 
  But Estonia saw Russia back off an agreed August 31 deadline 
on April 6 after talks between the two countries deadlocked over 
the status of retired Russian soldiers in the Baltic republic. 
  During his Danish visit, Meri refused to drink champagne 
offered to him at an exhibition opening "so long as the last 
Russian soldiers are on Estonian territory," he said. 
  The Estonian president had talks with Danish Prime Minister 
Poul Nyrup Rasmussen and Foreign Minister Niels Helveg Petersen 
on Thursday. 
  Meri said he expected his country to follow other East 
European countries by signing a free trade agreement or an 
association agreement with the European Union in June, which 
would come into force on January 1, 1995.

  [Text] In a move to defuse the crisis with Greece, 
Albanian President Sali Berisha said today that he is ready to 
discuss last Sunday's [10 April] border incident, in which two 
Albanian soldiers died. In a letter to the European Union [EU] 
demanding an investigation, the Albanian president stresses that 
Athens may not be directly responsible for the incident. 
  ATHENS NEWS AGENCY reported from Brussels that the European 
Union received the proposal for dialogue between Athens and 
Tirana outlined in Berisha's letter with satisfaction. This 
comment was made at noon today by a source close to EU 
Commission President Jacques Delors. The same source added that 
there are clear concerns among the EU members for possible 
negative developments in Greek-Albanian relations that could 
deteriorate and end in a new big crisis in the Balkans. We have 
to deal with many sources of conflict in the former Yugoslavia, 
the same source stressed and added that there is no need for 
another crisis at the border of an EU country member with 
Albania. Things, the source concluded, now appear to be heading 
in a better direction. 
  Greek Prime Minister Andreas Papandreou referred to the 
Albanian president's letter after his address at PASOK's 
[Panhellenic Socialist Movement] congress today. Papandreou 
said that the letter is a good step, and expressed the hope that 
the issue will be resolved.

to use force, the United Nations will decide to use force. In 
any case, the use of force must be decided taking account of the

  [Text] Madrid, April 15 (AFP) -- Moscow was informed of 
the United Nations' intention to order air strikes near Gorazde 
before they were carried out, UN Secretary General Butrus 
Butrus-Ghali said here Friday [15 April]. 
  "We told the Russian authorities before the use of this air 
support," Butrus-Ghali told a press conference held jointly with 
Spanish Prime Minister Felipe Gonzalez. 
  He explained why he had not revealed this earlier by saying: 
"I only received this information recently." 
  Moscow protested vehemently following Sunday and Monday's 
air 
strikes near the besieged eastern Bosnian Moslem enclave that 
they had not been informed before they were launched. 
  Western leaders subsequently said no government had been 
told 
before the strikes were launched, because they needed to be 
carried out urgently, and insisted that the order to launch them 
had been taken under a previously-agreed system. 
  Butrus-Ghali, who arrived here Wednesday for an official 
three-day visit, again defended the UN decision to call for 
North Atlantic Treaty Organisation air strikes, saying he would 
do so again if necessary. 
  "We will not hesitate to call on NATO to protect UN forces 
if 
they are in danger," he said, speaking in French. "It is a very 
clear warning to all those in former Yugoslavia who try to 
oppose the actions of UN forces." 
  He reiterated that UN Security Council Resolution 836 
allowed 
him to call for air action, and said that the Russian Federation 
had accepted the resolution.

  [Text] Geneva, April 15 (AFP) -- The UN High Commissioner 
for Refugees (UNHCR) has asked Bosnian Serb authorities to allow 
aid convoys back on Serb-controlled territory, a UN spokeswoman 
said here Friday [15 April]. 
  Convoys from the Croatian capital Zagreb to Serb-controlled 
Banja Luka in Bosnia-Hercegovina and out of Belgrade in Serbia 
were stopped Monday, as Serb authorities reacted angrily to NATO 
airstrikes Sunday and Monday on Serb positions around the 
besieged Moslem enclave of Gorazde. 
  But UNHCR officials remain in contact with Bosnian Serb 
authorities in Pale, and have asked to restart aid convoys 
through Serb-controlled territory next week, UNHCR spokeswoman 
Sylvana Foa said. 
  Meanwhile, the number of casualities in Gorazde in eastern 
Bosnia since the Serb onslaught began on March 28 rose to 191 
dead and 797 wounded on Thursday, the UN added. 
  The spokeswoman said that according to reports of UNHCR 
staff 
in Gorazde: "People are just incredibly panicked and terrified 
of what is going to happen to them."

<F P=106> [Report signed KV: "GATT Agreement Will Not Lower Consumer </F>
Prices -- European Consumers Unions Lament `Missed 
Opportunities'"] 
  [Text] The European Consumers Unions (BEUC) consider that 
the GATT agreement being signed today in Marrakesh represents a 
missed opportunity. The agreement will barely affect consumer 
prices, it claims. According to the BEUC, the future World 
Trade Organization (WTO) will have urgent work to do regarding 
international rules on competition and the environment. 
  At a press conference, BEUC President Jim Murray pointed out 
that his organization has always been in favor of the GATT 
agreement. "However, some parts of the agreement are not as good 
as we would have liked," he said. Indeed, he believes that the 
GATT agreement does not go far enough, especially in the 
agricultural and textile sectors. 
  Consumers will also continue to pay too much for their food 
when the agreement has taken effect. After all, the price 
reductions in which the agreement will result will go no further 
than the reductions already generated by the reform of the EU's 
common agricultural policy. In addition, the BEUC claim that 
subsidized exports of agricultural produce will continue, 
despite all the damaging consequences this will have for world 
trade. The BEUC fear that taxes may go up if the pressure on 
the EU agricultural budget is maintained. 
  Moreover, the GATT provisions regarding clothing and 
textiles 
do not meet expectations, according to the BEUC. The Multifiber 
Arrangement that offers the industrialized nations the 
possibility of imposing quotas on imports of specific textile 
products from developing countries, must be abolished within the 
next 10 years. The BEUC maintain that this will result in trade 
in sensitive textile products only being liberalized after that 
period has elapsed. Consequently, 50 percent of the textile 
trade will continue to be subject to restrictions until 2005. 
  The Consumers' Unions fear that the product standards 
elaborated in the GATT agreement will lead to less stringent 
standards being implemented in many countries. The BEUC also 
assert that the developing countries are receiving precious 
little in exchange for the agreement on intellectual property. 
The agreement on services will, the BEUC claim, barely have any 
repercussions for consumers. The BEUC are satisfied that the WTO 
is being set up. However, the WTO will have to do everything 
within its power to ensure that environmental and trade-related 
concerns are integrated better. International agreements on the 
environment must be able to compare with GATT rules, the BEUC 
say. At the same time, the WTO will have to ensure that there 
is greater transparency in decisionmaking procedures. 
  However, clear rules for international competition are also 
required. The WTO will have to draw these up and implement 
them. In this context, the BEUC are thinking of, say, an 
international approach to dealing with export cartels.

<F P=106> [Interview with Sir Leon Brittan, European commissioner for </F>
foreign trade and Commission vice president, by special 
correspondents Jean-Pierre Langellier and Philippe Lemaitre in 
Brussels; date not given: "Sir Leon Brittan: `We Have No Right 
To Reject East European Countries'" -- first paragraph is LE 
MONDE introduction] 
  [Text] Sir Leon Brittan seeks to succeed Jacques Delors on 
1 January 1995 as president of the European Commission in 
Brussels. As European commissioner responsible for external 
trade affairs and Commission vice president, he was the Twelve's 
chief negotiator in the talks that led to the completion of the 
GATT Uruguay Round, which is to be finalized on Friday 15 April 
in Marrakesh. A clever and engaging man, this former interior 
and industry minister of a conservative British Government will 
appear in "L'heure de verite" [Hour of Truth] television program 
on Sunday 17 April on France 2. On the next day, his 
pro-European manifesto, The Europe We Need, will be 
released in France. Sir Leon received LE MONDE's special 
correspondents in his Brussels office. 
  [LE MONDE] You would like to succeed Jacques Delors at the 
head of the Commission. How, in your opinion, has this 
candidacy by an Englishman been received, for example in France? 
  [Brittan] I am not on the campaign trail. I only let it be 
known that I was available should the heads of European states 
and government decide to approve my candidacy. I did not apply 
as an Englishman. I am an independent commissioner. As an 
Englishman, and I am proud of it, and as a member of the 
Conservative Party and a former minister, I take seriously the 
independence of the Commission and its commissioners. And I 
have ideas of my own. For instance, I have always been in favor 
of the economic and monetary union, and I have supported it both 
in Britain and elsewhere. This is one illustration of my 
independence. There are others. In France, all I can do is 
explain my ideas. This is the reason why I have written a book. 
  [LE MONDE] You were Europe's negotiator in the GATT Uruguay 
Round to be finalized on Friday in Marrakesh. Now that some 
time has elapsed after the talks came to a successful conclusion 
in December 1993, do you believe their outcome has been as 
positive as was expected at the time? 
  [Brittan] Yes, definitely. We achieved almost all of our 
objectives. Some issues were set aside and will be dealt with 
later; this was the case with financial services, for example. 
But we convinced the other countries -- developed and less 
developed alike -- to remove many obstacles to free trade, 
including tariffs. We were able to preserve those industrial 
sectors that are experiencing real difficulties, such as the 
aluminum sector. This is why European manufacturers were so 
happy with the outcome of the talks. 
  But most important will be the establishment of the World 
Trade Organization (WTO) and the consolidation of trade rules, 
which constitute a great step forward on the road to 
multilateralism. A major trade power such as the United States 
has now fewer levers with which to impose its views on other 
countries, because it has formally agreed to be more mindful of 
the rules of the multilateral game. This was always one of 
Europe's objectives. 
  And thanks to the consolidation of its own regulatory 
framework, Europe is now better able to defend itself, for 
instance against dumping. Add to this the results concerning 
farm products. For the most part, the Common Agricultural 
Policy (CAP) has now been recognized as legitimate. All 
parties, including the Americans, have approved a "peace clause" 
whereby they undertake not to harass European agriculture any 
longer. 
  [LE MONDE] Concerning farm products, you are happy with a 
result that came about after France exerted strong pressure, 
often encountering opposition by its European partners. What do 
you now think of this strategy? 
  [Brittan] These talks produced an number of important 
political lessons which must be heeded. Long discussions 
within, but also outside, the Council of Ministers contributed 
to a better understanding of France's position on the part of 
its partners. Such discussions also afforded French citizens a 
better view of the advantages of a successful GATT, of more open 
markets, and lower tariff barriers. Conversely, France's 
liberal partners now have a better understanding of its 
agricultural interests as well as, on another level, its 
commitment to a strong audiovisual policy. 
  [LE MONDE] On your initiative, after the Union's 
enlargement to 16 members, the Commission has initiated a review 
of policy options with respect to East Europe. Can it lead to 
tangible results? And if so, how long will that take? 
  [Brittan] Yes, I think it can. But when? That is another 
story. The future integration of East European countries in the 
Union hinges on moral, economic, and political grounds. 
Morally, we have no right to reject them after showing such 
understanding, even compassion toward them during the Communist 
era. Economically, there will be difficulties, of course, but 
ultimately their integration will be an asset for us. 
Politically, the question that matters is as follows: What 
will happen if we turn them down? I believe rejection on our 
part may push them into the arms of the Russians, which is the 
exact opposite of what they want. Or they may consider that 
Germany -- which has been keeping a high profile in the region 
-- is the only European country with any real interest in them. 
Germany would not like finding itself in such a situation, 
which would run counter to the Union's interest. This is why we 
must take them in. 
  When and under which conditions? The hardest part is finding 
a way to integrate East European countries while continuing to 
strengthen the Union. Those who advocate enlargement in the 
hope of preventing further consolidation are totally in the 
wrong. We must combine those two processes. Hence the key 
question to be asked at the intergovernmental conference 
provided for by the Maastricht Treaty in two years is: which 
institutional changes will let these countries join the Union 
without slowing down the consolidation process -- a perspective 
that would lessen the Union's cohesion? This is a complicated 
matter, but it can be solved. 
<H5>  `I Favor the Single Currency' </H5>
  [LE MONDE] Aside from monetary union, what are the other 
issues on which your position diverges from that of the Tory 
party? 
  [Brittan] You know, there is no single position within the 
government. There is a range of nuanced opinions, and a number 
of topics on which no-one has taken a clear stand yet, such as 
institutional issues. In fact, the debate will take place at the 
time of the intergovernmental conference. The notions I 
outlined are not currently those of the British Government. It 
may yet come to adopt them. 
  [LE MONDE] Do you think that the negative, dramatically 
reaffirmed stance of the Euroskeptics still reflects the views 
of a majority of the British population? 
  [Brittan] Opinions vary widely both within the population 
and within political circles. These differences have been 
around for a quarter of a century. A number of Conservatives 
bitterly oppose further integration within the Union. And the 
government is obviously hampered by its very small parliamentary 
majority. As for British voters, it all depends on the 
questions asked as well as the time they are asked. The 
positions of the British can be explained by their history and 
experience, which are quite different from those of the French 
or Belgians, for example. 
  Yet again, such differences can also be found in France, 
where the outcome of the referendum on the Maastricht Treaty did 
not reflect a dramatically pro-European feeling, and in Germany, 
which is still divided over the currency issue. Also, England 
does have a more lively debating tradition that other countries. 
  [LE MONDE] The British do not share your enthusiasm for the 
single currency. 
  [Brittan] No, they do not; however, before the crisis in the 
European Monetary System, business and corporate circles were 
overwhelmingly in favor of it. After the crisis, the idea lost 
some of its appeal with everybody. What I tell my fellow 
British citizens is that they do not have to decide right now; 
they can decide later whether or not they want to switch to the 
single currency. I for one am in favor of it. And it is my 
duty to say so to those who, mistakenly, believe that there will 
be no Economic and Monetary Union. 
  In Great Britain, differences on this issue are also a 
matter 
of generations. Young people who travel a lot have more 
generous ideas. Over the past 20 years, British society has 
become more European, albeit very slowly.

  [Text] Budapest (DDP/ADN) -- According to German Foreign 
Minister Klaus Kinkel, Germany will continue to be the "patron 
and advocate" of eastward expansion of the European Union (EU). 
Therefore, this issue will top the agenda of the German EU 
Presidency, which starts on 1 July, Kinkel said in Budapest 
today, at a forum organized by the Friedrich Naumann Foundation, 
the Hungarian opposition Alliance of Young Democrats (FiDeSZ), 
and the Alliance of Free Democrats (SZDSZ) on the subject of 
"The Visegrad Countries and the European Union." 
  The successful regional integration of the Visegrad states, 
Poland, the Czech Republic, Slovakia, Poland [as received], and 
Hungary was a preliminary stage to EU integration, the German 
foreign minister said. However, great efforts by all sides were 
still necessary before these countries could become members of 
the Union. Kinkel affirmed his proposal of a "Marshal Plan for 
the minds," under which, among other things, thousands of 
students from Central and East Europe should go to the EU states 
and college teaching staff should be exchanged. 
  In the area of security too, integration rather than 
exclusion was necessary. The correct way to achieve this was, 
for instance, the "evolutionary concept" of a Partnership for 
Peace, Kinkel said. In addition, association with the WEU 
[Western European Union] needed to be possible in order to bring 
the East European states closer to the European Union.

<F P=106> [Anders Hellberg report: "Tarschys in European Elite"] </F>
  [Text] Yesterday evening Swedish Riksdag deputy Daniel 
Tarschys was elected the new secretary general of the Council of 
Europe. As a result, he becomes the organization's highest 
official and boss of the 1,200 employees in Strasbourg in France. 
  Tarschys won four votes more than his rival candidate, 
France's Catherine Lalumiere, who has been secretary general for 
the last five years. 
  "The practice is that a secretary general is not reelected; 
there must be rotation in the post," Daniel Tarschys told DAGENS 
NYHETER a few hours after members of parliament from the whole 
of Europe had elected the Riksdag deputy from Sweden's Liberal 
Party. 
  There were only two candidates because the Italian 
Government's man withdrew at the last minute. 
  Tarschys speaks several languages and has a knowledge of 
East 
Europe -- a region which will totally dominate the Council of 
Europe over the next five years. 
  "I have said that the main priority in the next few years 
will be to support the democratization in Central and East 
Europe." 
  Russia has sought membership of the Council of the Europe 
which is known above all for its convention of support for human 
rights. Is Russia really ready to fight for democracy and human 
rights alongside other countries in the Council of Europe? 
  "It would be a good thing if a stable and democratic Russia 
were able to join. The election in December was one of the 
necessary preconditions, as is looking at how democracy is 
working and at how Russia respects human rights," Tarschys said. 
  The human rights situation in Europe has probably been 
better 
in the past than it is today, bearing in mind the conflict in 
the Balkans where human rights are being trampled on every day. 
Has the Council of Europe not failed? 
  "Yes, indeed there are major shortcomings in several places. 
At the same time we cannot ask for perfectionism before 
countries are allowed to join the organization. We count on it 
that the Council of Europe can also make a contribution to 
democracy and human rights when countries have become members." 
  Given the way things look in East Europe, is it likely that 
Europe will soon become the democratic and human rights paradise 
which the Council of Europe is seeking to achieve? 
  "No, it is not likely, but necessary. Sweden too has already 
been found guilty several times by the European Court, which is 
part of the Council of Europe." 
  But Sweden has been found guilty on questions of procedure. 
Does not Sweden have a different view of children's rights than 
the majority in the European Court? 
  "Yes, I agree that there are differences in our views of 
looking after children," Tarschys said. 
  So your election could influence the European Court and the 
Council of Europe in a Swedish direction? 
  "No, I don't think so. I will not be influencing the 
assembly but coordinating the whole organization in its work on 
the 150 different conventions and on interstate cooperation." 
  The Council of Europe consists of members of parliament from 
the member nations throughout Europe, including Sweden. Daniel 
Tarschys will now move from being a MP to working as a 
high-ranking official. 
  The organization does not concern itself with security 
policy 
like the CSCE or with trade and credits like the EU [European 
Union]. Instead it is the various conventions which guide the 
members' work on various issues -- everything from drugs policy 
to football hooliganism. 
  On 1 June Tarschys will move to Strasbourg with his family 
for his five-year term. He will also resign as a Swedish 
Riksdag deputy and as chairman of the Riksdag Foreign Affairs 
Committee.

<F P=106> [Ingrid Hedstrom report: "Social Democratic Program for </F>
More Jobs in Europe"] 
  [Text] Brussels -- With completely new figures on the 
European economy in his pocket, former Swedish Finance Minister 
Allan Larsson yesterday made public the four-point program for 
increased employment which will form the cornerstone of the 
European social democrats in the elections to the European 
Parliament. 
  "Our program is based on the simple realization that work 
makes more of a contribution to economic and social progress 
than does unemployment," Allan Larsson said at a conference in 
Brussels. 
  Before the parliamentary elections in June a final version 
of 
the social democratic jobs manifesto will be put before Europe's 
voters. But, before then, the European socialists want to 
broaden the discussion surrounding the program. That is why 
heavyweight representatives of both the trade unions and 
employers were taking part in yesterday's conference. 
  At the conference Allan Larsson made public new figures 
which 
"for probably the first time" view West Europe's economy as a 
whole. 
  And the figures which have been produced by two Danish trade 
union economists show that West Europe's economic crisis is 
homemade. Trade with countries outside Europe made a positive 
contribution to West Europe's growth in 1993. It was reduced 
consumption, a growth in stockpiles of goods, and a decrease in 
investments which produced economic recession. 
  Also, West Europe's profits from trade with the rest of the 
world are limited; only 7 percent of consumption and investment 
is created by business with countries outside Europe. 
  "We cannot blame our growth problems on countries where 
wages 
are low, whether these be countries in East Europe or developing 
countries. Trade is not the problem. Protectionism is not the 
solution. The causes are to be found within Europe," Allan 
Larsson said. 
  "The fact is that Europe has slowed down its economy by 
restricting demand." 
  Once again the former finance minister pointed to the 
"investment gap," the gulf between investments and savings: 
  "This gap is 6 percent of West Europe's GNP and corresponds 
to 8 to 9 million jobs. The most important explanation for this 
is monetary policy in Europe which strangles investment and 
hampers growth and employment," said Allan Larsson who thinks 
that the EU's [European Union] finance ministers must take the 
lead to bring down interest rates. 
  Allan Larsson pointed to "four cornerstones" in a program 
for 
increased employment: 

  -  Education and training to produce 
better qualified labor. 
  -  "Put money to work" by creating 
investment opportunities and a better investment climate. 
  -  An 
active labor market policy which can match new jobs to the right 
labor. 
  -  A new understanding between governments and the two sides 
of industry in Europe. 
  And both Emilio Gabaglio, the secretary general of the 
European Trade Union Association, and Zygmunt Tyszkiewicz, the 
secretary general of the European Employers' Association, Unice, 
spoke appreciatively of the European social democrats'jobs 
manifesto: 
  "It is very interesting, very rich, and shows that the 
antagonisms are not as great as they are sometimes portrayed," 
said Tyszkiewicz, who did, however, call for greater emphasis on 
the task of creating a climate more favorable to enterprise and 
investment. Emilio Gabaglio said that European employers must 
demonstrate a greater understanding of the fact that a "social 
Europe" is needed before it will be possible to create a new 
consensus: 
  "Employers' organizations must realize that the social 
dimension is indispensable. But we have not gotten there yet. 
On the contrary, they view us as a nuisance. They think that 
unemployment is our fault because workers are still stomping 
about demanding rights," the secretary general of the European 
trade unions association said.

  [Text] Linz -- Since the conclusion of the negotiations 
for membership, the number of supporters of the European Union 
[EU] has been increasing, although the Austrians are not very 
satisfied with the result of the negotiations. This was shown 
by a poll of the Linz opinion research institute, Spectra, which 
was published on Thursday [14 April]. According to Spectra, the 
share of EU supporters increased from 43 to 48 percent at time 
the negotiations were concluded. However, with 26 percent, the 
number of EU opponents did not change. Thus, according to the 
opinion researchers, the new votes for the EU come from the 
group of the undecided (currently only 26 percent). Thirty 
percent of the (1,000) interviewees assessed the result that had 
been brought home by the Austrian negotiating team as a clear 
success. For 37 percent, only a "medium success" was achieved. 
About 20 percent are "less" or "not at all satisfied."

<F P=106> [Interview with President Thomas Klestil by Otto Klambauer; </F>
place and date not given: "In the European Union We Can Be 
Docking Platform for Neighbors" -- first paragraph is DIE PRESSE 
introduction] 
  [Text] Having hardly returned from his trip to the Middle 
East, President Thomas Klestil will again go abroad today, 
Friday: This time for a "visit to neighbors." Czech President 
Vaclav Havel has invited the Central European heads of state to 
a two-day summit in the Renaissance palace of Litomysl in 
Bohemia. President Klestil defines his "summit position" for 
KURIER. 
  [Klambauer] What do you expect of the Central European 
summit in Litomysl? 
  [Klestil] Since the fall of the Iron Curtain, this area of 
Central Europe has again become the center of dramatic events in 
the world. After all, two world wars were caused by Central 
European problems -- and now we are witnessing the return of 
evil spirits in the Balkans. Last year, I myself extended the 
invitation for the first talk of presidents to that effect -- 
therefore, I am particularly happy about the present increase in 
the number of participants: It strengthens our efforts for a 
zone of stability and peace in Central Europe. 
  [Klambauer] Regarding the future of Central Europe: Is the 
idea of Central Europe still alive -- or is it already nostalgia? 
  [Klestil] President Havel recently talked of the "spirit of 
Salzburg," which also is supposed to be felt now in Litomysl. 
We Austrians are closely tied to our neighbors by history and 
culture. We have been and we still are a community of fate. 
Today we are unified by freedom, democracy, and a market 
economy -- but also the joint concern about instability. You 
see, the strengthening of comprehensive internal and external 
security is at issue -- this also includes the struggle against 
uncontrolled mass migration, crime, drug trafficking, and 
dangerous nuclear power plants. 
  [Klambauer] How are the new democracies of East Europe to be 
involved? 
  [Klestil] We belong to the explicit supporters of the 
European Union [EU]'s expansion to the East. And, in the event 
of a positive referendum in June, we Austrians will also 
advocate the entry of the young Central European democracies 
into the European Union as soon as possible. 
  [Klambauer] What does the Austrian president say to the 
establishment of closer ties with NATO by our East European 
neighbors? 
  [Klestil] Several Central European states participate in the 
NATO Partnership for Peace. This is sensible and we Austrians 
welcome it because it is promoting stability. 
  [Klambauer] And how do you see Austria's role in this "new 
Central Europe" on the eve of the EU referendum? 
  [Klestil] We Austrians have already very close economic ties 
with our Central European neighbors today. I would even go so 
far as to talk of a "docking platform" which we could serve as 
for our neighbors inside the EU This corresponds to our own 
interests, our old and new task in the Central European area.

<F P=106> [Report by Ernst Bieber: "The 72-Billion Deal by E. </F>
Shevardnadze in Vienna"] 
  [Text] The Republic of Georgia is apparently making 
adventurous efforts to raise money on the free Western capital 
market. In Vienna, a court has temporarily seized copies of 
Georgian Government bonds and securities, documents signed by 
President Eduard Shevardnadze. The total value of the sum 
guaranteed by Tbilisi is the equivalent of nearly 72 billion 
schillings! A Vienna businessman tried to convert these bonds 
into money. As a result of this, he was imprisoned for a few 
days. 
  The 54-year-old Heinz J. was arrested on 12 April on 
suspicion of fraud and forgery at a hotel in Vienna's 15th 
district when he tried to sell Georgian securities to an 
interested person. 
  Securities of a nominal value of $10 million each (120 
million schillings) were involved. The government bonds were 
offered at half or one-third of this price. Buyers were 
promised repayment of the nominal value in a few years' time. 
  The Vienna businessman got involved in the capital 
procurement operation through other agents and wanted to 
participate in the profit. J. is not unknown to the finance 
police. About two years ago, on 9 April 1992, he was arrested 
in Vienna on suspicion of participating in a fraud involving 
millions of schillings. At the time, he described himself as an 
expert on deals with the East, reported enthusiastically about 
profits from coffee and cigarette deals, and persuaded several 
people to participate. Yet these megadeals turned out to be 
failures, and the damage amounted to about 2 million schillings. 
Heinz J. was released from prison a few days later. He then 
fled to Florida, where he has a second residence in Boca Raton 
near Miami. His lawyer at the time, Herbert Eichenseder, was 
successful in obtaining the rescindment of the international 
arrest warrant. J. returned to Austria and has largely paid off 
the damages. 
  However, he will still be facing charges of fraud at the 
provincial court in Vienna in June. Klothilde Eckbrecht will be 
the judge. 
  This new affair also "smells" of fraud. Officials from 
Vienna police headquarters even suspect organized crime behind 
the planned deal involving billions of schillings. The fact 
that a Vienna businessman who had previously come under the 
suspicion of fraud was trying to sell Georgian Government bonds 
worth 72 billion schillings was not exactly credible. 
  J. claimed that the documents were copies of real 
securities. 
The originals were to be handed over to the buyer after the 
money transfer. 
  The criminal police submitted the documents to the Georgian 
Embassy in Vienna for examination. On Friday [15 April] the 
answer from Tbilisi arrived: The documents are authentic, and 
so is Shevardnadze's signature. 
  The judge responsible who until recently had been carrying 
out the investigations on the suspicion of fraud (punishment one 
to 10 years) ordered J.'s release from prison on Friday. 
  The question remains whether the Vienna businessman will be 
continuing to raise money for Georgia.

<F P=106> [By Chris Moncrieff, PRESS ASSOCIATION political editor] </F>
  [Text] Defence Secretary Malcolm Rifkind today lashed out 
at armchair critics who claimed the warring factions in Bosnia 
could be bombed into submission by NATO air strikes. 
  He denounced the suggestion as "facile," adding: "I am not 
the slightest bit surprised that those who have put it forward 
have been discredited." 
  He claimed the United Nations would have sustained far 
higher 
fatalities and injuries over the last few months if it had not 
been prepared to use the force available to protect its own men. 
  But in a wide-ranging interview on the BBC Radio 4 "The 
World 
This Weekend" programme Mr Rifkind warned: "Do not expect there 
to be good progress in all directions. This is a very messy, 
bloody war. The idea it can be sorted out in some neat, 
clinical way is a nice aspiration, but totally unrealistic." 
  Mr Rifkind stressed the United Nations role was peacekeeping 
and humanitarian. 
  "You have siren voices claiming that the United Nations 
should turn itself into a warmonger and impose a peace on 
someone else's civil war." 
  He urged those countries which had pledged more troops to 
Bosnia to "get their act together a bit more quickly." 
  Earlier, Mr Rifkind described the events in the Gorazde area 
as "a very serious deterioration." 
  "The most important priority are the negotiations taking 
place at this moment, as we speak, which are designed to allow 
the UN to send a force into Gorazde itself to help stabilise the 
situation and ensure there is no further deterioration." 
  He said the British Government took the view that the 
primary 
use of air power was to defend UN forces. "It is quite a 
foolish mistake to suggest that the occasional use of air power 
can have decisive implications for the future of the war in 
Bosnia. That is not the UN's role, nor should it ever be the 
UN's role because air power by itself could not do that." 
  But he added: "The right of self-defence is a fundamental 
right and British forces, ever since Day One, have made 
abundantly clear that they are prepared to fight back, if 
necessary, to defend our people."

  [Text] Paris, April 15 (YONHAP) -- South Korean Foreign 
Minister Han Sung-chu, currently on a European tour, met his 
British counterpart Douglas Hurd in London Friday [15 April] to 
discuss the North Korean nuclear dispute and other issues of 
mutual interest. Hurd invited President Kim Yong-sam to visit 
London during his one-hour talk with Han. 
  Han explained recent developments after the UN Security 
Council issued a statement calling on North Korea to permit 
nuclear inspections, including Kim's summits in Japan and China 
and his own trip to the two countries, the United States and 
Russia, and his meeting with Hans Blix, director-general of the 
International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA). 
  The foreign minister elaborated on Seoul's decisions to 
withdraw its demand for an inter-Korean exchange of envoys as a 
precondition to further high-level Pyongyang-Washington talks 
and to accommodate North Korean loggers fleeing from Siberian 
camps. 
  London expressed "a full understanding" of Seoul's new 
measures as well as hope that the nuclear issue would now be 
resolved. 
  Han thanked Hurd for Britain's support in handling the 
nuclear problem on the international stage, to which Hurd 
responded with a promise of continued cooperation. 
  The British secretary said his government welcomes a visit 
by 
President Kim anytime. 
  Han met British strategy experts later in the evening to 
further discuss the nuclear issue and is scheduled to speak at a 
lunch Saturday sponsored by a non-governmental body, the 
Korea-Britain Forum.

<F P=106> [Philip Johnston report: "Hurd Urges Debate on New World </F>
Role"] 
  [Text] A public debate aimed at reviving national 
self-confidence and re-assessing Britain's place in a changing 
world was foreshadowed last night by Mr Douglas Hurd the Foreign 
Secretary. 
  In a wide-ranging foreign policy speech at the Mansion House 
in London, he lamented the narrowness of current political 
argument in Britain, typified by the fracas over Maastricht and 
voting rights in Europe. 
  Mr Hurd said: "While we dispute among ourselves, we risk 
failing to notice how the world is changing." 
  He said the country ran the risk of "intellectual shrinkage 
-- as if we despaired of convincing anybody of anything, as if 
we simply wanted to devise ways of protecting ourselves against 
a Europe and a world which was bound to run against us." 
  He said: "This is negative and damaging nonsense. This 
country has been, ought to be, can be, a powerhouse of ideas 
about the future of Europe and more widely about the 
relationship between states and international institutions. We 
cannot pick and choose to which continent we belong. We cannot 
stop the world in order to get off." 
  Mr Hurd said Britain's influence remained strong across the 
world -- in Europe, where "our wholehearted involvement is 
essential," increasingly in South America, in India and 
Australasia, in southern Africa and in the Far East despite 
recent disputes with China and Malaysia. 
  Mr Hurd said he wanted the European Union to be more than 
merely a single market but one that defined its limits, was more 
sensitive to its citizens and which stopped seeking to take more 
powers to the centre. 
  The Foreign Secretary also made a renewed pitch for a 
rapprochement with Malaysia, following the breach in trade links 
caused by British press reports about alleged corruption in the 
Malaysian Government. 
  The Trade and Industry Department hopes to send a 
ministerial 
trade mission to Malaysia before the end of the year as part of 
a push for business in the Far East, Mr Richard Needham, the 
trade minister, said last night.

<F P=106> [John Steele report: "Bottomley and MI5 Chief on `IRA Hit </F>
List'"] 
  [Text] The head of MI5, Mrs Stella Rimington, and Mrs 
Virginia Bottomley, the Health Secretary, were among potential 
IRA targets on documents found at the home of an English 
terrorist recruit after a Harrods explosion, a jury was told 
yesterday. 
  Mrs Bottomley's name was in a notebook found in a jacket 
allegedly belonging to Patrick Hayes, 41, accused of planting 
the bomb at the Knightsbridge store, said Mr John Bevan, 
prosecuting at the Old Bailey. 
  Two newspaper articles about Mrs Rimington, from THE 
GUARDIAN, including one with her picture, were also found. 
Hayes had allegedly written on them details of her supposed 
address. 
  There were also, on cigarette paper in a vacuum cleaner 
dustbag, details of senior Army officers, some taken from the 
SHOOTING TIMES. Other documents recorded details of lavatories 
in London hotels. Mr Bevan added: "Bombs in hotels are 
obviously totally indiscriminate." 
  Mr Bevan said the notebook could "fairly be described as a 
hit list." 
  The jury was told that the Canary Wharf tower in east 
London, 
Europe's second tallest building, "miraculously" escaped 
devastation from a huge IRA fertiliser bomb when a detonator 
went off but failed to ignite the main explosives. 
  The bomb was similar to other home-made IRA bombs which 
twice 
devastated the City of London and also wrecked the Staples 
Corner junction of the M1 in north London. 
  Mr Bevan said Hayes, one of two Englishmen accused of being 
IRA bombers, could be linked to the conspiracy to bomb Canary 
Wharf. 
  Hayes is alleged to have planted a bomb which injured four 
people at the Harrods store in Knightsbridge in January last 
year. He was allegedly captured on video film with Jan Taylor, 
51, a former soldier. 
  The pair are also said to have bombed a train from Victoria 
to Ramsgate in Kent in February last year. 
  Their capture, at Hayes's home in Walford Road, Stoke 
Newington, north London, in March last year after the Harrods 
films were released to the media, enabled police to capture 
guns, explosives and bomb-making equipment. 
  It also brought together two previously separate terrorist 
investigations: Operations Brompton, springing from the Harrods 
and Rarnsgate explosions, and Canary, probing the tower bomb and 
other bombs found in Tottenham Court Road and Woodside Park in 
north London, the jury was told. 
  Hayes has refused to plead on what he says are "political 
matters" but not guilty pleas have been entered for him, alone, 
on allegations of three conspiracies to bomb Canary Wharf, 
Tottenham Court Road and Woodside Park. 
  Pleas of not guilty have also been entered for Taylor, of 
Stepney, east London, jointly charged with Hayes of eight 
further counts, including bombing Harrods and the train and 
firearms offences. 
  The trial was adjourned until today.

<F P=106> [Article signed GGD/RHR: "`Silver Back': Withdrawal To Be </F>
Completed Today"] 
  [Excerpts] Brussels, 15 Apr (BELGA) -- On Friday [15 April] 
at 1100 GMT, a military spokesman said that the Belgian Army is 
expected to complete by the end of the day the withdrawal of 
Belgian troops. They had participated in the evacuation of 
foreigners from Rwanda. 
  The military spokesman denies the AFP Press Agency report on 
an announcement by Belgian Ambassador in Kenya, Christian 
Fellens, that the Belgian troops departed from Kigali. However 
the spokesman confirms that the Belgian "intervention 
contingent" has finished the mission of evacuating foreigners, 
and he reports on an incident that occurred with the Rwandan 
Armed Forces on Friday morning. [passage omitted] 
  Colonel Gilbert Hertoghe has told the BELGA Press Agency 
that 
an incident took place Friday morning at the Kigali airport, 
when a rp-14 multiple rocket launcher of the Rwandan Armed 
Forces [government armed forces -- editor's note] was positioned 
within 50 meters of the airport enclave, violating the agreement 
concluded Thursday evening with the warring parties. The truce 
was allowed humanitarian flights and planes for troops' 
evacuation. 
  This piece of artillery towed by a truck has been positioned 
50 meters away from the enclave, while the agreement stipulates 
that this kind of weapon should remain at a distance of 500 
meters, the spokesman says. 
  The rocket launcher was fired twice in the direction of 
Kigali and the Belgian Armed Forces twice demanded its 
withdrawal. Since the request not being met, the paratroopers 
commandant ordered warning shots over the artillery piece. At 
that moment, the rp-14 was moved from its position, Colonel 
Hertoghe adds.

<F P=106> [Report by Phillip Stephens: "Government Sets Out Terms for </F>
ERM Truce"] 
  [Text] The government yesterday set out the terms for a 
truce between the Conservative Party's pro-Europeans and 
Eurosceptics on Britain's attitude to the European exchange rate 
mechanism [ERM]. 
  In a series of carefully crafted phrases, the party's 
economic policy document for the European elections campaign 
declares that Britain will not consider re-entry to the ERM in 
the foreseeable future. The wording was approved by Mr John 
Major, the prime minister, Mr Douglas Hurd, the foreign 
secretary, and Mr Kenneth Clarke, the chancellor. 
  But the formulation of the document -- A Competitive Britain 
in a Competitive Europe -- left the door open for a change of 
heart after the next election. 
  The document says that Britain's criticism of the ERM had 
been widely acknowledged. In those circumstances, it says, "we 
will not re-enter such a mechanism in the foreseeable future, 
nor could we do so until it is clear that such faults no longer 
exist." 
  That olive branch to the Euro-sceptics is followed by a 
reassurance to pro-Europeans that "we will not, however, cut 
ourselves off from future discussion of how economic policies 
can best be co-ordinated within the European Union [EU] in order 
to secure competitiveness, growth and jobs." 
  Ministers said the wording would provide the basis of the 
party's position to be set out in the full manifesto next month. 
  Ministers also voiced confidence that the formulation would 
bridge the sharp divide on Tory back benches over ERM membership. 
  On the issue of a single currency, the document repeats the 
studiously neutral position implied by Britain's opt-out from 
the Maastricht Treaty. Parliament would retain the right to 
take a separate decision -- in the light of Britain's interest 
and needs -- if and when other members of the EU moved to create 
a single currency.

<F P=106> [Interview with unidentified leader of the Ulster Freedom </F>
Fighters by Eamonn Mallie; place and date not given; quotation 
marks as published] 
  [Text] "Because of the job I am in, people will say I am a 
bastard, but if I wasn't doing it, someone else would be." So 
says the former British Army soldier who is now commander of the 
Ulster Freedom Fighters [UFF], an illegal Protestant terrorist 
force. 
  On Wednesday [13 April], UFF gunmen tried to murder a 
wheelchair-bound multiple sclerosis victim just days after he 
had returned from Lourdes seeking a miracle cure for his 
illness. Paul O'Neill, a 33-year-old Catholic, was hit in the 
face and arms as eight shots were fired through the windows of 
his Belfast home. His father, Aidan, 61, was wounded in the 
chest. Police dismissed claims that the family had any link 
with IRA terrorists. 
  Twenty-four hours later, Loyalist paramilitaries shot dead a 
Sinn Fein councillor's wife at her home in the city. 
Mother-of-two Theresa Clinton, 33, was hit when a UFF gunman 
sprayed the house with bullets. 
  The attacks are part of a long line of brutal sectarian 
murders mounted by Protestant paramilitaries. Loyalists have 
been responsible for eight of the 11 terrorist murders in the 
province this year. According to its leader, the UFF intends to 
continue its attacks in the North and has targeted for 
assassination John Hume, the Social Democratic and Labour Party 
[SDLP] MP who has been holding talks with Sinn Fein leader Gerry 
Adams. The UFF is also threatening to take its campaign into 
the Irish Republic. 
  Of the Irish Prime Minister, Albert Reynolds, and his 
involvement in the Downing Street Declaration, the UFF leader 
said: "The more interference, the more intransigence on his 
side, the more inevitable a Loyalist assault on the South." 
  As a first step, the UFF is attempting to build up recruits 
in border areas. "We see ourselves as less British as time 
passes," said the leader. "It is evident from what has been 
happening since the Anglo-Irish agreement and the Downing Street 
Declaration that the British Government's long-term objective is 
a united Ireland and we feel they are preparing the groundwork. 
  ``They are putting structures in place so that when that 
eventually comes about it will not be such a long step.'' 
  He showed no trust in the present Secretary of State for 
Northern Ireland, Sir Patrick Mayhew. "He's certainly one of 
the greener Secretaries of State. I wouldn't trust him. He has 
lied and lied again. 
  ``Our short-term aim is to take the fight to Sinn Fein-IRA 
in 
a pro-active campaign instead of a reactive campaign. We're 
only at the start of this process. Our enemy is coming from 
three fronts, Sinn Fein-IRA, the Irish government and the SDLP. 
Anybody with the objectives of the pan-nationalist front or who 
aids and abets them will be targeted. 
  ``We feel we're being taken into a united Ireland against 
our 
will and we will do everything to resist that. 
  ``If we have an internal settlement and we sort out our own 
problems without the interference of Britain or Dublin and we 
get an accountable government back, we will then stretch out the 
hand of friendship. 
  ``The Dublin government is the bigger threat. We don't see 
our own government as a threat, but its long-term objective 
seems to be that it wants to leave. We believe if they could 
leave tomorrow they would.'' 
  Lord Carson, the father-figure of Loyalism, once predicted 
that "the final battle will be between Loyalists and the British 
Army." But the UFF leader said: "It is too early for that to 
happen. It would be a sorry state of affairs if our own 
Government turned our own army against us, considering that a 
lot of us in the Loyalist community served in the armed forces 
and I have served." 
  He refused to discuss the size of the Protestant 
paramilitary 
forces saying only: "There's an ongoing recruitment drive in all 
areas." This drive includes recruits into Ulster Young 
Militants, the junior wing of the UFF. A typical recruit was 
described in this way: "He is 16 to 18 years, mostly working 
class. We're not going for hoods-they are carefully vetted and 
sworn in." 
  Security sources have acknowledged that the Loyalist 
paramilitaries are increasingly well armed and trained. Sinn 
Fein repeatedly alleges that this has happened with the help and 
awareness of British intelligence. They are thought to have 
received a huge consignment of weapons via South Africa in the 
late Eighties. In recent months, they have deployed 
rocket-propelled grenades in targeting Sinn Fein advice centres 
in west and north Belfast. In the past two years, the UFF have 
also carried out a series of attacks on the homes of members of 
Republican organisations and on the SDLP, where entire families 
suffered bomb and gun attacks. 
  Thirteen members of Sinn Fein have been killed, as have a 
further seven people married to, or connected with, Sinn Fein 
members. 
  Asked if it is justifiable to target innocent women and 
children, the UFF leader replied: "There is an onus on everybody 
to minimise risk to civilians, but in the present situation 
there are going to be civilian casualties -- though regrettable. 
I am not trying to justify it. It is not a deliberate ploy or 
aim. The reverse has happened in our community." 
  Of the SDLP leader John Hume, the UFF commander said: "At 
the 
minute within working-class areas, John Hume has brought the 
SDLP almost to the point where they are inseparable from Sinn 
Fein. No matter which way Mr Hume puts his peace process, we 
don't see it as a peace process. We see it as a Dublin process. 
We couldn't do business with Hume. He will never be able to 
recover and gain the confidence of Unionists. He's part of the 
pan-nationalist front and he's a target." 
  In a further defence of the use of violence, the UFF leader 
added: "The British Government hasn't had the will to defeat the 
IRA. There has been a policy of containment instead of an 
offensive policy. If your Government doesn't have the will to 
defend its people then surely any man has the right to defence. 
The line the SDLP and the Dublin government are taking at the 
minute gives encouragement to Sinn Fein and the IRA. 
  ``Mr Reynolds has stated there is a yawning gap between Sinn 
Fein and the British Government. We can assure Mr Reynolds 
there is an even wider gap between himself, Sinn Fein and the 
IRA and the Loyalist community. He may talk about structures 
being put in place ... what the man has got to realise is he's 
not paying a price at this point for his government's 
interference. He's getting away scot-free. Would he be so 
quick to interfere if the conflict was transferred South?''

<F P=106> [Report by Graham Bowley and Philip Coggan: "Minutes Reveal </F>
Sharp Rift at the Top"] 
  [Text] For institutions which have prided themselves on 
secrecy throughout their history, the published minutes of the 
monthly meetings between theTreasury and the Bank of England are 
remarkable for their candour. 
  The minutes of the February meeting, in particular, clearly 
show the extent of the disagreement between the chancellor, Mr 
Kenneth Clarke and the governor, Mr Eddie George. 
  The governor opened discussions in February by arguing that 
economic evidence published since the January meeting had "if 
anything, weakened rather than strengthened the case for an 
immediate rate cut." 
  Mr George said the most likely projection was that economic 
"growth would pick up to perhaps 3 per cent on current policy 
settings, in part as a continuing response to the reductions in 
interest rates at the end of 1992 and early 1993. Although the 
best projection was that underlying inflation would remain 
around The middle of the (1 to 4 per cent) target range, there 
were upside risks. The case for an immediate cut in interest 
rates rested on a view that the Budget measures would 
significantly slow down the pace of growth." 
  In Mr George's opinion "it would be safer to wait for more 
evidence of the effects" of the tax increases before acting, the 
minutes report. "To cut rates now in advance of this evidence 
would run a risk of higher inflation and some loss of 
credibility, and he strongly advised against." 
  The chancellor's response was to state that "he was 
concerned 
that advice was erring excessively on the side of caution. He 
had been more inclined to cut interest rates last month, and in 
his view the case for a cut had become stronger since then." 
  "In recent months inflation outturns had consistently been 
better than expected, and inflation projections were still being 
lowered." 
  The minutes report: "The chancellor thought that the 
monetary indicators provided a good case for an interest rate 
cut... In addition, pay settlements remained between 2 and 2.5 
per cent on average, with a significant minority of employees 
accepting a pay freeze." 
  Mr Clarke said he was "determined that inflation should not 
accelerate again. However, with a significant fiscal tightening 
in prospect and considerable spare capacity in the whole 
economy, he saw little risk of an increase in inflation. He was 
inclined to take the opportunity to cut rates from their present 
relatively high levels." 
  The minutes then summarise the discussion between the 
chancellor and the governor and their officials. Here remarks 
are not attributed to individuals because of the Whitehall 
convention that advice to ministers is confidential. But 
someone made the point that "there was a danger that an interest 
rate cut now would be interpreted as being influenced by 
political considerations." That is exactly what did happen, as 
the eventual cut coincided with newspaper headlines about the 
death of Tory MP Mr Stephen Milligan. 
  It was during the discussion that the possibility of a 0.25 
percentage point rate cut was raised. On the second day of the 
meeting, the chancellor said "he still favoured reducing 
interest rates now. He saw little risk of inflation picking up 
but a significant risk that the fiscal measures would slow down 
the recovery. An interest rate cut in April would be too late 
to offset the effect of the fiscal measures. Although he 
thought an immediate 0.5 per cent reduction would be justified, 
he saw advantage in a 0.25 per cent cut. Moving interest rates 
by smaller amounts was quite common in other countries, and was 
consistent with the current low innation and low interest rate 
environment." 
  The governor said he could "agree to a 0.25 per cent, but 
not 
to 0.5 per cent." The minutes record his parting shot that "his 
concern stemmed from experience that it would be difficult to 
restrain inflation if it started to rise." 
  However, Mr Clarke got his rate cut which shows that, in 
spite of the Bank's hopes for independence, the Treasury is 
still firmly in charge of monetary policy. 
  The minutes of the last three meetings also show that the 
governor has been consistently much more optimistic about the 
UK's growth prospects than has the chancellor. In the February 
meeting, for example, while the governor talked of possible 3 
per cent GDP growth, ahead of the official forecast, the 
chancellor spoke of "a significant risk that the fiscal measures 
would slow down the recovery." 
  Mr Clarke's utterances in the monthly meetings seem less 
upbeat than his more public statements on the economy. In 
March, he said that "anecdotal evidence did not suggest that 
activity was growing strongly." In February, referring to the 
fall in unemployment, for example, he said that "much of the 
employment created so far had been in part time jobs." In 
addition to the February disagreement, there were signs of a 
difference in views in the January meeting. The chancellor then 
said that "the objective case for a further 0.5 per cent cut in 
rates was quite strong" but the governor argued that "the risk 
associated with cutting interest rates now was greater than the 
risk associated with waiting." On that occasion, the chancellor 
agreed to do nothing. 
  A greater measure of unanimity was achieved at the March 2 
meeting: the minutes reveal that there was no intention to 
raise bank base interest rates, as was feared by some 
commentators in the City. 
  The chancellor said in March that "it would be appropriate 
to 
consider a further reduction in interest rates if indicators 
subsequently suggested that activity was subdued and 
inflationary pressures remained under firm control." 
  Meanwhile, the governor said "there would be a case for a 
further easing of interest rates if the evidence suggested that 
activity was slowing," although he concluded "at this stage 
there was insufficient evidence to warrant a cut." 
  A further meeting between the pair was held on March 30, and 
minutes will not be published until May 18. 
  The chancellor's stated aim in publishing yesterday the 
minutes of his monthly meetings with the governor of the Bank of 
England is to promote accountability and transparency in the 
operation of monetary policy. 
  At a press conference with Mr Clarke yesterday, the governor 
welcomed the move. It would enable financial markets, 
parliament and the public to gain a better appreciation of the 
nuances of policy and realise that divergences between governor 
and chancellor "were very rarely black and white." 
  Mr George said the February disagreement and his final 
acceptance of a 0.25 point cut in base rates to 5.75 per cent 
had to be seen in the context of his January remark that he had 
"recommended adopting a bias towards easing" monetary policy. 
  Although governor and chancellor appeared the best of 
friends 
yesterday, there may be some costs involved in the new policy of 
transparency. Financial markets rarely like to see open 
disagreement between policy-makers and there may come a time 
when the published minutes lead to a sharp, and unfavourable, 
market reaction.

<F P=106> [Report by Kevin Brown: "Tories Launch Euro Campaign"] </F>
  [Text] The government yesterday put free trade and 
competitiveness at the centre of its European election campaign 
as senior ministers sought to quash speculation that a poor 
result could trigger a leadership challenge to Mr John Major. 
  Launching the party's election campaign at Conservative 
Central Office in London, ministers and officials said the party 
was united behind a free-market approach to Europe and 
opposition to socialist domination of the European Parliament. 
  Mr Kenneth Clarke, the chancellor, and Mr Michael Heseltine, 
trade and industry secretary -- the two main alternative 
candidates -- ruled out a leadership challenge and denied that 
the election amounted to a referendum on Mr Major. 
  "We have both said that neither of us would ever stand 
against John Major. There is no leadership issue," Mr Clarke 
said. Mr Heseltine told journalists: "I agree with everything 
that Ken has said." 
  Mr Heseltine said the prime minister would "put forward the 
policies of this government with the united support of this 
government. What he won't do is abandon the essential policies 
which he believes are necessary to enable the economy to 
continue to recover." 
  But there was continued speculation at Westminster about Mr 
Major's future if the Tories poll badly in the European 
elections on June 9 and the local elections on May 5. 
  Launching the European campaign, Mr Heseltine, Mr Clarke and 
Mr David Hunt, employment secretary, said there was a clear 
contrast between Labour's commitment to regulation and the 
Conservatives' free-market approach. 
  "The Conservative contribution to the European debate is 
based on competitiveness, free trade, low marginal taxes and 
supply-side reform delivered within a sound macroeconomic 
framework. 
  ``Here in Britain we are delivering the goods and we are 
showing the way to our European allies,'' Mr Clarke said. ``By 
contrast, the Labour and Liberal Parties would drive a coach and 
horses through carefully laid economic policies.'' 
  Mr Heseltine said there was growing support in the EU 
[European Union] for Conservative policies such as free trade, 
deregulation and more flexible labour markets.

<F P=106> [Report by Nicholas Watt, Ireland correspondent: "Dublin </F>
Tries To Calm Unionists Fear Over Reynolds Plan"] 
  [Text] The Irish government tried yesterday to allay 
Unionist fears after Albert Reynolds, the Prime Minister, had 
outlined his vision for a "new and agreed Ireland" with 30 
percent of government posts reserved for Ulster politicians. 
  A senior Irish government source said Mr Reynolds was merely 
floating ideas when he told a Fianna Fail youth conference on 
Saturday [16 April] that he would provide "far-reaching 
guarantees" for Unionists in a united Ireland. 
  The source said: "The Taoiseach [Prime Minister] was pushing 
his ideas up the flag pole to see how they would be received. 
His proposals would be debated in the context of an overall 
settlement." 
  Unionists reacted angrily after Mr Reynolds spelt out the 
merits of Irish unity for Unionists in his speech in Malahide, 
Co Dublin. He said it would boost the Irish economy as a whole 
and would allow Unionists to take part in government. 
  "I personally would be prepared to provide a guaranteed 30 
percent of places in an enlarged government, and throughout the 
public sector, for as long as was necessary, to members of the 
two communities in the north in proportion to their respective 
populations," Mr Reynolds said. He added that a united Ireland 
would be able to secure a better deal for Ulster farmers. He 
even suggested that Irish society was more tolerant and liberal 
than Northern Ireland. 
  Mr Reynolds tried to couch his proposals in language that 
would not upset Unionists, and he said that a majority in 
Northern Ireland would not be coerced into a united Ireland. 
  The government source said that Mr Reynolds knew Unionists 
would initially dismiss his speech, but he believes there will 
never be progress unless he takes risks. "Unionists now know 
his starting position. He knows his ideas may have sounded 
premature, but he is prepared to take risks. If he didn't 
nothing would be done. Republicans have reached a road block on 
whether to give up violence. While they ponder what to do Mr 
Reynolds is not going to twiddle his thumbs." 
  Yesterday Unionists dismissed Mr Reynolds's proposals as 
unrealistic and unacceptable. James Molyneaux, the leader of 
the Ulster Unionists, said: "The greater number of people in 
Northern Ireland are not orphans wandering about in barren 
landscapes waiting for somebody to let them in. They are quite 
happy, Protestant and Catholic alike, to remain within the 
bigger unit of the United Kingdom and they bear no ill will 
towards their southern neighbour."

  [Text] Bonn -- Foreign Minister Klaus Kinkel (Free 
Democratic Party of Germany) believes that, even after a 
positive decision by the Constitutional Court, the participation 
of the Bundeswehr in peacekeeping missions should be "an 
absolute exception." In an interview with Hesse radio, Kinkel 
stated this morning: "This culture of reservation that we have 
displayed in our foreign and security policy after the defeat in 
World War II must be preserved." He wants to continue the 
practice "to say no more often than yes in decisions after the 
ruling by the Constitutional Court." 
  The dispatch of German soldiers to territories in the former 
Yugoslavia is no issue, Kinkel told DPA. The participation of 
Bundeswehr soldiers must be approved in every individual case by 
the Bundestag. An approval by the Bundestag for an armed or 
even unarmed German mission in the former Yugoslavia is 
certainly not to be expected. Thus, this problem is not topical. 
  Kinkel stated in the radio interview that he has the 
impression that he shares Chancellor Kohl's (Christian 
Democratic Union) view on this issue. Asked about statements by 
Wolfgang Schaeuble, chairman of the Bundestag groups of the 
Christian Democratic Union/Christian Social Union, who basically 
advocated German participation in military operations in Bosnia, 
Kinkel mentioned Schaeuble's modification that all those 
affected must agree. "It is practically inconceivable that the 
Serbian side would do so in the former Yugoslavia," the foreign 
minister stressed. 
  The Federal Press Office announced today during the weekend 
that the Federal Government considered using paratroopers of the 
Bundeswehr to rescue 11 German citizens from the civil war in 
Rwanda. The Defense Ministry was given the order to examine the 
technical details of air transportation and deployment after it 
became know that 11 Germans were in danger of their lives at the 
relay station of Deutsche Welle near Kigali. "The 
considerations were stopped when it was announced that Belgian 
paratroopers had saved the Germans." 
  Guenther Nolting from the Free Democratic Party of Germany 
[FDP] criticized in BILD AM SONNTAG that "it was a matter of 
course for the Germans to rely on the alliance partners in an 
international crisis." Soldiers from the United States, France, 
and Belgium rescued their citizens from the embattled region. 
Nolting asked: "What will we do if our partners should decide 
not take along the Germans any more in passing but call for the 
participation of German soldiers in the rescue operations on the 
spot or for initiatives on the part of the Germans?" The FDP 
official spoke in favor of raising this issue at the Bundestag 
during the discussion of the Bundeswehr White Paper.

  [Text] Bonn -- For Foreign Minister Klaus Kinkel (Free 
Democratic Party of Germany), the dispatch of German soldiers to 
territories in the former Yugoslavia is no issue. Even if a 
decision by the Constitutional Court should allow the 
participation of the Bundeswehr in armed blue beret missions, as 
it is generally expected to do, German soldiers would not be 
deployed in the former Yugoslavia, Kinkel told DPA today. 
  The participation of Bundeswehr soldiers would have to be 
approved in every individual case by the Bundestag, the foreign 
minister stressed. An approval by the Bundestag for an armed or 
even unarmed German mission in the former Yugoslavia is 
certainly not to be expected. Thus, this problem is not topical. 
  Chancellor Helmut Kohl (Christian Democratic Union) 
expressed 
a similar view at the end of last week. "In this part of 
Europe, the memory of World War II is particularly present. 
Thus, one must ask oneself the question whether German help -- 
no matter what kind -- is welcome at all," the chancellor stated 
in an interview with SUEDDEUTSCHE ZEITUNG. The chairman of the 
Bundestag group of the Christian Democratic Union/Christian 
Social Union, Wolfgang Schaeuble, basically advocated 
participation in military operations in Bosnia in an interview 
with the Cologne EXPRESS (Saturday edition). However, this is 
only possible "if all those affected agree."

  [Text] Saarlouis -- Oskar Lafontaine, deputy chairman of 
the Social Democratic Party of Germany [SPD], criticized the 
participation of German soldiers in missions in civil war zones 
as the "wrong peace policy." At a conference of the Saarland 
SPD, Lafontaine stated in Saarlouis today: "Those who want 
peace in Asia and Africa should finally stop exporting weapons 
to these countries." He accused the government of 
schizophrenia, stressing: "First we export our weapons to all 
parts of the world, and then we send our children there as 
soldiers to collect them again." Referring to the civil wars in 
the former Yugoslavia, Somalia, and Rwanda, Lafontaine pointed 
out that it must also be possible to help without soldiers.

Germany's foreign policy if the assertion is true that the 
Turkish military is using German weapons against the Kurds. 
  In the Frankfurt talks of Hesse radio, Kinkel stated today 
that the information and documents provided by human rights 
groups are being evaluated. Everything suggests that it will 
again be difficult to prove the allegations. Examinations in 
the past also failed to furnish evidence that the Turks are 
using the weapons against the Kurds. Nothing is being covered 
up in this respect. If the allegations should turn out to be 
true, this "would not be good for German-Turkish relations," 
Kinkel stressed.

  [Text] Wiesbaden/Biblis -- A leaky fuel rod in the 
controversial Block A of the Biblis nuclear power plant in 
southern Hesse is the presumable cause for higher radioactivity 
in the cooling water. This was announced by the Hesse 
Environment Ministry today. According to the ministry, a higher 
degree of radioactivity than usual was detected in a sample of 
the primary circuit on Friday [15 April]. Gaseous iodine 131 
escaped from the apparently leaky fuel rod. Thus, the 
radioactivity of the cooling water is to be examined twice daily 
instead of once. 
  The director of the nuclear power plant, Klaus Distler, 
however, spoke of a "routine procedure." Leaky fuel rods occur 
in every power plant and do not suggest a technical problem. 
Among the approximately 250,000 fuel rods that are being used 
in Block A, such an event cannot be ruled out. "Thus, years 
without leaky fuel rods are an exception," Distler stressed. 
According to the director, the fuel rods are used between three 
and four years.

<F P=106> [Interview with Foreign Trade Minister Gerard Longuet by </F>
unattributed correspondent; place and date not given: "GATT -- 
A Victory for France"] 
  [Excerpt] [PARIS MATCH] Are the GATT agreements to be 
signed this week in Marrakesh a source of great satisfaction to 
France? 
  [Longuet] We have two reasons to be happy: France, which is 
already the fourth-ranking export nation in the world, is seeing 
new markets open up. Thanks to French-U.S. cooperation, we will 
now be able to introduce the famous social clause for which we 
have been calling. As it will take time before such a clause is 
adopted, it is better to raise the issue right away. It will be 
included of the work schedule of the World Trade Organization 
(WTO), that will see the light of day in 1995. 
  [PARIS MATCH] Will this agreement help us find a way out of 
the crisis? 
  [Longuet] It does constitute a serious boost for our 
economy. 
Thanks to the rules of the game accepted by all the signatory 
countries, we will have a stable economic framework which is 
more beneficial to the development of trade. The growth rate of 
world trade is twice that of the world economy. 
  [PARIS MATCH] Are you not worried by that many of our 
companies will relocate in the future? 
  [Longuet] Companies must get used to a permanent 
reallocation 
of roles. We must help certain sectors, those that are more 
exposed than others, to adapt. Take the clothing industry, for 
instance. We will help this sector to become more upmarket and 
to protect its brand name policy. There are many positive 
aspects of the GATT agreement in this connection, notably the 
respect for intellectual property. 
  [PARIS MATCH] And what about the negative aspects of GATT? 
Are there any? 
  [Longuet] I regret that countries like India and Pakistan 
did 
not join with us in opening up their markets to a greater 
extent. They want to benefit from the advantages without 
accepting the discipline. 
  [PARIS MATCH] Is the United States not the clearest winner 
out of GATT? 
  [Longuet] No, the clearest winner is Europe! Admittedly, the 
United States is more powerful in economic terms. They wielded 
a very large stick which enabled them to have their way. From 
now on, the stick will be more in the hands of the future WTO, 
which will become the policeman of world trade. 
  [PARIS MATCH] The French foreign trade surplus in 1993 (89 
billion francs) is vast. Will that performance be repeated in 
1994? 
  [Longuet] Our surpluses will not be as large in 1994. As our 
economy improves, companies will invest in new equipment, some 
of which we shall purchase from abroad. This will further 
reduce our trade surpluses, but, at the same time, our companies 
will continue to conquer new markets. Consequently, we will 
again achieve a significant surplus in 1994. 
  [PARIS MATCH] Changing the subject, as president of the 
Republican Party, were you happy with the choice of Dominique 
Baudis as the majority's top candidate for the upcoming European 
elections? 
  [Longuet] We would have preferred to see Jean-Francois 
Deniau 
nominated, but now we have Dominique Baudis. Since he was 
designated, he will be our candidate. We shall support him 
loyally so that the RPR-UDF [Rally for the Republic-Union for 
French Democracy] union scores the best possible result in the 
European elections. 
  [PARIS MATCH] That hardly sounds enthusiastic. 
  [Longuet] It is support without any reservations....

  [Text] (ANSA) Rome, 14 April -- A law decree authorising 
the deployment of Italian observers in Hebron in the Israeli 
occupied territories was approved in a cabinet meeting today, 
Education Minister Rosa Russo Jervolino said. 
  The decree states that 35 Italian Armed Forces members and 
technical experts will be sent to Hebron in response to an 
agreement on the issue reached by Israeli and Palestinian 
authorities March 31, on the basis of United Nations Resolution 
904. 
  The scope of the mission, in which Italians will join 60 
Norwegians and 35 Danes, will be "to provide all necessary 
guarantees for the Palestinian people of the occupied 
territories," a cabinet office communique said. 
  The observer mission, dubbed Temporary International 
Presence 
in Hebron (TIPH), will last a minimum three months, and was set 
up after a Jewish settler shot at least 30 Palestinians dead in 
a Hebron mosque February 25.

<F P=106> [Unattributed article: "No General Accord on Senate Speaker"] </F>
  [Text] (ANSA) Rome, April 14 -- A meeting of senators from 
across the political spectrum failed to produce agreement on a 
universally-approved candidate for the Senate speaker's chair, 
MPs said Thursday evening [14 April]. 
  While the country's likely future government -- made up of 
Forza Italia, National Alliance, the Northern League and smaller 
allies linked together in the Freedom Front -- has reached a 
deal to field economist Carlo Scognamiglio for the post, the 
right-wing line-up does not have an absolute majority in the 
upper house, and may have to bow to opposition pressure for an 
`institutional' nomination. 
  Both the Senate and Lower House gather tomorrow for the 
first 
session of the 12th legislature, with electing speakers at the 
top of the agenda. 
  Gianfranco Fini, secretary of National Alliance, the renamed 
neo-fascist Italian Social Movement, was confident, however, 
that Scognamiglio would pull through: "I haven't done any 
counting but others have, and they have assured me that 
Scognamiglio will be elected. I know that we will get a 
majority." 
  The economics professor himself, a member of Forza Italia, 
was resigned to facing competition, and said "but in the end the 
Senate is sovereign and it will have to decide on the basis of 
the voting. It comes as no surprise to me that there will be 
other candidates." 
  Northern League leader Umberto Bossi seemed unconcerned 
about 
the fact that the Freedom Front candidate may lose his bid for 
the speaker's chair: "what the hell do I care," he told curious 
journalists. 
  Less brusque was League member Marcello Staglieno who 
confirmed that Scognamiglio was the candidate of the whole 
right-wing alliance, but who said that, given the lack of an 
absolute majority in the Senate "the League is ready to weigh up 
an institutional candidate, should one arise." 
  On the opposition benches, the Left Democrat Secretary 
Achille Occhetto promised that his party would be fielding a 
counter-bidder for the post, which is the second highest in the 
land, after that of president. 
  Mario Segni, leader of the centrist Segni Pact, voiced 
disappointment that the Freedom Front had not opted for an 
institutional candidate: "they have missed a great opportunity 
for electing, in at least one house, a candidate with wide-based 
support." 
  From the People's Party, the renamed Christian Democrats, 
Pierluigi Castagnetti said he was certain that the names of 
Scognamiglio for the Senate and 31-year-old Irene Pivetti for 
the Lower House were a smokescreen for the real candidates. "But 
anyway, we will not be voting for them," he said. 
  The name of Pivetti drew fire from the Pannella Ticket, 
nominally supporters of the Freedom Front, with Marco Pannella 
accusing her of anti-Semitic leanings. 
  Pivetti replied this evening, saying "I have total respect 
for diversity."

<F P=106> [Unattributed article: "Spadolini Officially Candidate for </F>
Senate Speakership"] 
  [Text] (ANSA) Rome, April 15 -- Shortly before the 
inaugural session of the XII legislature at Palazzo Madama this 
morning, Life Senator Giovanni Spadolini announced that he had 
acceded to the appeal from various political forces represented 
in the Upper Chamber and agreed to put his name up for the 
Senate Speakership, the post he held in the outgoing legislature. 
  "I have always conceived of the role of Senate speaker as a 
role `super partes', necessarily having no political strings 
attached," Spadolini said. He underscored the need of the 
speaker to defend the principles of democracy and a "correct 
dialectic among all the political forces within a civil 
confrontation of ideas" which must never be allowed to 
degenerate into mere "insults and provocations." 
  The senate speaker must be the guarantor for the rights of 
both the majority and the minority, he insisted. The current 
situation of the senate is the most delicate in its history and 
that balance must be preserved which is so fundamental to the 
future of the legislature and to the proper functioning of the 
democratic institutions, Spadolini said. 
  These balances are the fruit of a complex and complicated 
history which cannot easily be reduced to prefabricated 
diagrams, he continued. For this reason, Spadolini said he was 
offering himself as a candidate that he claimed would provide an 
institutional guarantee of that impartiality and equidistance 
which he said he has sought over the past seven years as speaker 
to provide the nation, in keeping with the spirit of the 
constitution. 
  The 122 senators of the Progressive Pole, at an 
early-morning 
meeting, unanimously decided to back Spadolini's candidacy. Just 
before the Senate assembly began, the 30 senators of the 
People's Party also decided to back Spadolini.

<F P=106> [Report by Dino Vaiano: "Ministerial Race Underway, But Di </F>
Pietro Says No Thanks -- Biondi and Mastella Candidates for 
Justice Ministry"] 
  [Text] Rome -- The new government "will be like AC Milan 
[soccer team, curently top of league division], with all the 
best players" a young Forza Italia deputy said, taking an 
inquisitive sidelong glance at the Palazzo Chigi [government 
seat]. The street was crowded with official cars waiting for 
[Prime Minister] Ciampi's "professors," gathered for the last 
operative cabinet meeting. It was 1200 hours and there was a 
demob atmosphere in the council. 
  Piazza Montecitorio [square outside lower house] was packed. 
The "freshmen" were swarming in the streets around the Palazzo 
Chigi waiting for the initiation ceremony to begin. Smiles, 
witticisms, and euphoria. Meanwhile, inside the palace, 
attention was focused on the race for the ministries. What kind 
of team will [Forza Italia leader] Berlusconi field? 
  The Marco Van Basten [soccer hero] of the team, the 
outstanding technocratic minister wanted by many deputies, would 
be [Clean Hands Judge] Antonio di Pietro at the Interior 
Ministry. However, the judge involved in the Clean Hands trials 
has made it known that he has no intention of hanging up his 
judges robes. Now, people are banking on last-minute attempts 
to get him to accept the Interior Ministry or Justice Ministry. 
With Di Pietro ruled out, the list of candidates for the 
Interior and Justice Ministries looks especially political. 
Raffaele Costa (Center Union) and Francesco D'Onofrio 
(Christian Democratic Center) will run off against Clemente 
Mastella. 
  If Roberto Maroni (from the wing of the League touting for 
ministries) becomes deputy prime minister charged with 
institutional reforms and antitrust issues (so that he can 
closely mark Berlusconi), then the choice of Irene Pivetti as 
speaker in the Chamber of Deputies has lowered the odds on 
[Liberal member] Alfredo Biondi taking a ministerial post. Will 
he end up at in the Justice Ministry? 
  The grapevine of names comes on top of the plans to reduce 
the number of ministries, grouping them together according to 
their functions. The new government should have 14 or 15 
ministries. Forza Italia economist Antonio Martino has suggested 
merging the Budget and Treasury Ministries into a superministry 
of the economy. He was thinking of Mario Monti, but the Bocconi 
[Milan Independent Catholic University] rector has already said 
"no, thank you." 
  The great power game is in full swing. However, in reality, 
between Forza Italia, the League, and the National Alliance 
there has, as yet, been no contact about the ministerial 
structure. People are talking about programs. Berlusconi has 
not ruled out bringing in people from outside. In recent days, 
it is said that [former Prime Minister] Giuliano Amato has been 
asked how he would feel about taking over at the Foreign 
Ministry or the Treasury. Then an attempt would be made to place 
a technocrat like [Segni Pact economist] Giulio Tremonti in the 
Finance Ministry, and Lamberto Dini, currently Bank of Italy 
general manager, in the Treasury. However, the League's 
Giancarlo Pagliarini is also in the running for an economic 
post, and he, together with his party colleague Vito Gnutti 
(Labor) and Maroni, look set to make up the Lombardy delegation. 
[League ideologue] Gianfranco Miglio is the dark horse in this 
race. [Radical leader] Pannella is in line for a ministerial 
post, as is, perhaps, [Christian Democratic Center leader] 
Ombretta Fumagalli (Post and Telecommunications). 
  The National Alliance is also preparing for office. The 
names being bandied around on the right are Domenico Fisichella 
(Public Prosecutor), Publio Fiori (Health), and Giuseppe 
Tatarella (Transport). Among Berlusconi's closest advisers, 
Antonio Martino looks to be in pole position for the Foreign 
Ministry. [Forza Italia ideologue] Giuliano Urbani, if he is 
not made institutional reform minister, could be charged with 
coordinating government action as under secretary to the prime 
minister's office.

<F P=106> [Gian Antonio Stella report: "Irene, the Lombard Maid -- </F>
She Was Elected With the Slogan: Your Soul to God, Your Vote to 
Bossi"] 
  [Text] Rome -- An armored tank in a pastel-colored, 
two-piece suit: "Catholics cannot always recognize everyone's 
right to profess their own religion." If old Monsignor Marcel 
Lefebvre, the crusader of precouncil fundamentalism, was still 
alive, no doubt his eyes would shine with emotion. Could he 
ever have dreamt, at the time the hated Rome of the Papacy was 
drifting toward modernism, that a traditionalist like Irene 
Pivetti would be nominated for the post of speaker of the lower 
house? 
  Each word is like a stone being thrown: "It is a Catholic's 
specific duty to endeavor to convert others and not leave them 
prey to error." Does Article 18 of the Declaration of Human 
Rights not guarantee everybody the right to profess their own 
religion? "It is a Catholic's duty not to subscribe to it 
uncritically." Because there is only one possible goal: 
"Building a society in which Catholic religion is shared by 
everybody." 
  Combative Irene -- the League's true Joan of Arc -- has 
never 
been afraid to speak up. She has never given up making polemic, 
adamant, cutting remarks. Against the progressive 
intellectuals: "I do not give a hoot." Against Cardinal Paolo 
Martini: "He manages the Milan curia [archbishopric] like a 
holding." Against those who accuse her of wanting to foster the 
northern race. "There is nothing wrong with that. It is not 
the League saying there are fewer births in the north than in 
the south, it is a statistical fact." She is always 
straightforward with what she believes in: God, Bandwagon 
[League nickname], and family -- forward like a tank advancing 
on gentle tracks with the hoarse thundering voice of someone who 
has smoked too many Gauloises cigarettes and against everything 
and everybody, including her own boss, if necessary. Like that 
time when [League secretary] Bossi invited "that dear little hot 
number [Federation of Italian Socialists Secretary] Boniver" to 
taste the strength of "hard-on-ism." With her strict air of a 
Swiss nanny of the Frau Rottermayer variety, the Bandwagon's 
virgin maid frowned and said: "I felt uncomfortable. A vulgar 
attack...." She even burst out: "I felt like punching him in 
the nose." 
  She carries her 31 years with somewhat starched 
gracefulness: 
vaporous, chestnut-colored, 30's-style hairdo; somewhere between 
dove-color and sapphire blue, transparent eyes; a slightly 
absent, suffering air; a beautiful mouth which rarely opens into 
a smile. Irene Pivetti was born in Milan, on 4 April 1963, on 
St. Isidore's day. Daughter of a film-director and an actress, 
both of them Catholics, she attended the scientific high school, 
deepened her religious faith by taking part in spiritual rites 
and contemplative experiences, discovered commitment by dealing 
with ethnic music for the curia's broadcasting station "Radio 
A." She chose the path of modern languages, enrolling in the 
Sacro Cuore University and graduating with the highest marks, 
having submitted a thesis on 15th-century linguist Benedetto 
Varchi's unpublished work -- a choice which was in line with 
family traditions. Once sarcastically branded by FAMIGLIA 
CRISTIANA as "the League's titmouse," she is in fact the niece 
of Aldo Gabrielli, the author of the dictionary published under 
his name, whose latest edition she supervised herself. 
  Intelligent, cultured, willful, politically educated by FUCI 
[Italian Catholics University Federation] and ACLI [Christian 
Association of Italian Workers], she told of how she had 
discovered the League just over four years ago: "I wrote an 
article against those who dismissed the League too offhandedly. 
Bossi phoned me and treated me to a pizza." Love at first 
sight. She was immediately entrusted with the bandwagon's 
Catholic Consultation Office [Consulta], together with Giuseppe 
Leoni (who, years later, censored her, saying she "speaks like a 
Lefebvrian"), immediately stood as a candidate for the Chamber 
of Deputies, and was immediately elected with a forceful slogan 
"Your soul to God, your vote to Bossi." A meteoric rise which 
was offset by a family crisis, namely the deterioration of her 
relationship with her husband, Paolo Taranta, a young left-wing 
Catholic economist close to the PDS [Democratic Party of the 
Left]. A Catholic-Communist (the worst possible combination, in 
Irene's view) who greeted his wife's election to the Chamber of 
Deputies with an icy: "Congratulations. What a shame you happen 
to be in the wrong party." 
  Dressed always in yuppy manageress suits -- often enlivened 
by the glimmer of a gold necklace (the "Vandee [18th-century 
French counterrevolutionary movement] cross," testifying to her 
faith in revolt: "A beautiful example of the people's religious 
heroism"), dismissed by [Forza Italia sympathizer] Deputy 
Vittorio Sgarbi with an anti-Scalfaro quip ("We have moved from 
the contemplation of the Madonna, to the Madonna herself"), 
Irene Pivetti has now been for years at the center of -- often 
violent -- polemics. 
  Let us mention only three. The first was a campaign in the 
name of Cardinal Ratzinger ("a true guarantor of Catholic faith 
and morals") against Cardinal Martini, conducted in such harsh 
tones as to lead Umberto Bossi to say that "like all Catholics, 
Irene also often adopts fundamentalist attitudes worthy of 
Khomeyni." 
  The second campaign was that against abortion: "The law must 
be reviewed from top to bottom. In the abortion surgery 
factories, there must also be doctors who object to abortion and 
enlighten people's consciences." 
  The third polemic was aimed against the "antiracist 
Savonarolas" [virulent 15th-century Florentine moralist 
preacher] who, in her view, had stirred up a "great fuss" by 
demanding an antiracist law only because of a few "stars of 
David stuck on the shopwindows of a few Jewish people in Rome." 
A multi-episode polemic: Accused by a foreign newspaper of 
using anti-Semitic tones, the League deputy (beware of calling 
her "right honorable": "I cannot stand it") submitted a motion 
in parliament -- [Radical leader] Pannella recalled -- asking to 
be protected against the "Jewish freemasonry." Replying to those 
"more or less well-known members of the Jewish community" who 
had dared criticize her (such as [Journalist] Arrigo Levi, in a 
CORRIERE DELLA SERA article), she replied with three words which 
her uncle only included in his dictionary with bashful 
embarrassment: "Balls, balls, balls!"

<F P=106> [Unattributed article: "P2 Masonic Lodge Leaders Cleared of </F>
Subversion"] 
  [Excerpts] (ANSA) Rome, April 16 -- Leaders of the 
Propaganda Due (P2) masonic lodge, outlawed by an act of 
parliament in 1982, were cleared of political subversion charges 
by the Rome assises court Saturday [16 April]. 
  The secret lodge's venerable grand master Licio Gelli was 
sentenced to 17 years in prison for related crimes, while 
General Gianadelio Maletti, a former top official at the 
disbanded SID [Defense Intelligence Service] secret services, 
got 14 years. Both men were given five-year reductions on their 
terms. 
  The court's verdict came after four days in camera, and 
after 
Gelli failed to turn up for a promised statement to the court. 
According to the prosecution, in the 1970s and early '80s, Gelli 
managed to build up control over a large section of the press, 
over one part of the magistrature, and over the intelligence 
services in their entirety. 
  During those years, the prosecution told the court, P2 "was 
a 
criminal association aimed at committing many acts of espionage, 
and of violation of secrets pertaining to national security. An 
association aimed at changing the constitution by illicit means, 
and at disturbing the work and prerogatives of the government 
and parliament." Gelli's influence over the magistrature was 
said to have been exerted through large financial contributions 
to the conservative Magistratura Indipendente (Independent 
Magistrature) group. Through influence at the very top of the 
secret services he succeeded in installing himself more or less 
as the country's intelligence chief, the prosecution alleged. 
  A hold over the press was achieved with the help of banker 
Roberto Calvi who bought a controlling stake in the Rizzoli 
publishing group which then began a campaign to buy up 
newspapers. "This hold over press sources," said the 
prosecution, "led to an immediate connection with political 
interests, and each of those papers was a point of reference for 
local political cells." [passage omitted] 
  Today's sentence handed down on Gelli was for counts of 
perjury, possession of secret state documents, and sums paid to 
Milan magistrates investigating the collapse of Calvi's Banco 
Ambrosiano in 1982. 
  Unlike the other 12 people in the dock, Gelli was not tried 
on conspiracy charges because authorities in Switzerland, from 
where he was extradited to stand trial in Italy, refused to hand 
him over for this charge. Other sentences handed out today 
varied from two years and six months to 13 years and six months. 
[Gelli's assistant] Umberto Ortolani was acquitted. 
  "If ever there was an association whose aim was to condition 
(public life), that was the P2," commented Public Prosecutor 
Elisabetta Cesqui, pointing out that the sentence claims the 
secret lodge was "not an association to commit crime." Cesqui 
added that she would have to see the motivation of the sentence 
before making a final assessment, but judicial sources said she 
will almost certainly take the case to the appeals court. 
  In her final address, the public prosecutor, who asked for 
13 
and a half years against Gelli, 10 against Ortolani and a total 
of 69 for the other 11 defendants, argued that the P2 served as 
an association to commit acts of espionage and the violation of 
official secrets of importance to national security with the aim 
of "modifying the Constitution by illegal means." Much the same 
conclusions were drawn by the parliamentary enquiry whose 
findings in 1982 led to the P2's banning in late 1982. 
  "I am horrified," commented Left Democrat Party Secretary 
Achille Occhetto of the sentence. "Incredibly enough, years of 
serious work by the parliamentary committee of inquiry into the 
P2 of which I was a member have been cancelled. Faced by this 
small sentence, we fortunately have many volumes of documents at 
Parliament showing exactly the opposite." [passage omitted]

<F P=106> [Unattributed article: "Extra-EU Trade Balance 2.073 </F>
Trillion in Black"] 
  [Text] (ANSA) Rome, April 15 -- Italy's February trade 
balance outside the European Union [EU] showed a surplus of 
2.073 trillion lire (1.26 billion dollars), compared to a 
surplus of 248 billion lire (151 million dollars) last year, the 
statistical office Istat reported. 
  The first two months of the year showed a surplus of 1.919 
trillion lire (1.17 billion dollars) compared to a deficit of 
580 billion lire (354 million dollars) in the same period last 
year. 
  Imports in February rose 6.5 percent to 9.193 trillion lire 
while exports rose 26.8 percent to 11.266 trillion lire, 
compared to the previous February. 
  The 2.073 trillion surplus splits into a 1.575 trillion 
deficit for energy products and a 3.648 trillion surplus for 
other goods. 
  The February 1993 surplus of 248 billion lire was the result 
of a 1.610 trillion deficit for energy products and a 1.858 
trillion surplus for other goods. 
  The export boom was especially in textiles and clothing 
(plus 
54 percent), nonmetal products (plus 37), engineering (plus 31 
percent), other manufacturing products (plus 30), chemicals 
(plus 27), and farm and fish products (plus 23). 
  The biggest import rises were farm and fish (plus 22), 
chemicals (21), textiles and clothing (15). 
  The export split by category showed a 37 percent rise for 
consumer goods, a 33 percent rise for investment goods, and a 20 
percent rise for intermediate goods. The import breakdown was: 
intermediate goods 10 percent up, consumer goods 4 percent up, 
investment goods 15 percent down. 
  Over the first two months of the year imports from non-EU 
countries rose 5.4 percent to 18.239 trillion lire (11.189 
billion dollars). 
  Exports to these countries rose 20.6 percent to 20.158 
trillion lire (12.369 billion dollars). 
  The two-month surplus of 1.919 trillion split into a deficit 
of 3.294 trillion lire for energy products and a surplus of 
5.213 trillion lire for other goods. 
  The engineering and textile surpluses grew by 1.357 trillion 
and 839 billion, while the energy deficit fell by 333 billion. 
  Geographically, trade with Japan rose 52 percent, with newly 
industrialised Asian countries 51 percent, and with China 30 
percent.

<F P=106> [Unattributed article: "Credit Shareholders Name Board, End </F>
11-Hour Meeting"] 
  [Text] (ANSA) Genoa, April 17 -- Shareholders of Credito 
Italiano, which was privatized in December, concluded their 
first assembly early Sunday morning [17 April] after meeting for 
11 hours, listening to 513 speeches, approving the 1993 
financial report and electing a new board of directors. 
  The new 11-member board includes Giampiero Pesenti 
(Italmobiliare), Roberto Gavazzi (Allianz-Ras), J.G.T. Carter 
(Commercial Union), Achille Maramotti (Max Mara), Franz Schmidt 
(Nippon Life), Leonardo Del Vecchio (Luxottica), Wolfgang 
Graebner (Berliner Handels und Frankfurter Bank), Leopold Henri 
Jeorger (Societe Generale) and Roberto Bertazzoni (Smeg). The 
two other board members, Lucio Rondelli and Egidio Giuseppe 
Bruno, on Monday will be elected formally chairman and managing 
director, respectively, it was announced. 
  Aside from the two top board members, the nine others 
account 
for an estimated 223 million shares of Credit stock, for a total 
market value of between 600 and 650 billion lire (up to 397 
million dollars). 
  The bad weather apparently kept away many of the 5,800 
Credit 
shareholders expected to attend and the meeting in the end saw a 
total of 3,316 shareholders represented (personally or through 
mandates), accounting for 32 percent of company stock. The 
total number of company shareholders in the books on February 28 
was 56,737. 
  The 1993 financial report showed profits increased 5 percent 
in 1993 to 219 billion lire (133.8 million dollars) from 208 
billion lire the previous year. Gross operating profits grew 96 
percent to 1.336 trillion lire (816 million dollars) and 
dividends were unchanged at 85 lire per ordinary share and 100 
lire per savings share. For this year, Bruno forecast higher 
profits because of lower taxes and illustrated the bank's 
four-point strategy: increasing the number of low-cost branches, 
more managed savings, a higher production rate (with about 200 
job cuts a year) and expansion into merchant banking activities.

<F P=106> [Unattributed article: "New Government Must Respect Labor </F>
Accords, Ciampi Says"] 
  [Text] (ANSA) Verona, April 15 -- Outgoing Prime Minister 
Carlo Azeglio Ciampi on Friday [15 April] praised the agreements 
reached last summer with trade unions and private employers and 
indirectly warned future governments not to renege on them. 
  Speaking at a conference of private industrialists, the 
former central bank chief gave an overview of his one year in 
the premier's office, saying that popular consensus around his 
executive was obtained thanks to the "triangle" formed by 
government, business and unions in times of decision-making. 
"Governments come and go but the players in the economic scene 
remain to guarantee the agreements made," Ciampi said, stressing 
that respect of the accords is also "a guarantee of social 
peace, economic development and financial stability." 
  Trade union leaders have recently expressed fears that the 
new right-wing government, expected to replace Ciampi after new 
parliamentary speakers are elected, may decide, in the name of 
neo-liberal free market ideology, not to comply with two accords 
signed in 1992 and 1993 by the government, the private 
employers' association Confindustria [General Confederation of 
Italian Industry], and the three major trade union federations. 
  In his address, Ciampi commented that those who profess 
abstract free-market ideologies may see the "triangle" as a form 
of elitist "associationship" responsible for all of Italy's 
problems and that must be done away with, but he emphasized that 
there is a difference between this form of associationship and 
"consensus." The former, Ciampi said, "weakens autonomy and 
responsibility, damages decisions and prevents the government's 
work from being seen as action." The latter, he said, "is the 
sort of air a democratic government should always breathe in a 
complex and difficult democracy with an open market." 
  Ciampi then recounted the achievements and actions of his 
government since he was sworn into office on April 29, 1993, 
stressing the issues of industrial relations, public finances 
and privatizations. He said his economic policies focused on 
five topics: labor market wages and policies; monetary and 
exchange policies; righting public finances; privatizations and 
industrial relations; public administration reforms. "All of it 
aimed at re-launching the economy and increasing employment," he 
said. 
  Ciampi claimed that the "basic conditions for a boost in 
production" have been created thanks to lower interest rates, 
lower labor costs, a more flexible job market, a "more 
competitive" currency, monetary stability and an influx of 
capital into the bond market. 
  Commenting on recommendations by conservative economic 
experts (and campaign promises by right-wing parties) to slash 
taxes, Ciampi said it would be very difficult to reduce fiscal 
pressure without incisive and further spending cuts.

<F P=106> [Unattributed article: "Bombers May Have Set Off Bomb North </F>
of Rome"] 
  [Text] (ANSA) Rome, April 15 -- The huge bomb found 
Thursday evening [14 April] by a road north of Rome may have 
been blown up by those who planted it, and not by a police robot 
as originally thought, investigators said Friday. 
  The bomb, containing between 50 and 70 kilos of explosive 
material, was deemed too complicated for defusing manually by 
police explosives experts who examined it yesterday evening. The 
terrain on which it had been left was too rough to allow a robot 
to disconnect the many wires on the device. 
  A strong jet of water was therefore pointed at the bomb, in 
a 
move which should have deactivated it, but instead it blew up, 
leaving a crater six metres by four metres across and almost two 
metres deep. 
  In their initial examination of the bomb, which was spotted 
under a pile of branches by the side of a road north of Rome by 
a local petrol station manager, police experts came to the 
conclusion that the device was to have been detonated by a radio 
command, possibly from as far away as a kilometre. 
  By blowing up the device "with surgical precision" as the 
operation to deactivate it began, the bombers may have "wished 
to destroy all the evidence," said investigators. 
  The three cardboard boxes, full of synthetic explosives, 
were 
linked by a mass of wires and connected to two batteries and a 
voltmetre, which measures the volts of a battery. The detonator 
was believed to be inside one of the boxes which explosives 
experts decided to leave unopened. A remote control aerial was 
sticking out of one of the boxes which were still relatively dry 
when found by police, despite the wet terrain on which they had 
been placed. The attempted attack was the work of "true bombing 
professionals," investigators said. 
  The bomb was intended for an ordinary, rather than an 
armoured, vehicle, but even a large car would have been blown 
many metres into the air, with little hope for those inside, 
said well-informed sources. 
  The target of the attack is believed to have been Mafia 
supergrass Salvatore Contorno, who lives nearby the bomb site.

Gerhard in Bonn -- recorded] 
  [Text] [Gerhard] Foreign Minister Klaus Kinkel expressed 
the hope that Russia will exert more pressure on the Serbs. 
  [Kinkel] It is very important and decisive now for the 
Russian side to exert massive and urgently needed pressure on 
the Serbs, so that the Serbs give up the stranglehold of Gorazde. 
  [Gerhard] What should the Russians tell the Serbs? 
  [Kinkel] They must tell them that we have achieved major 
progress in the political sphere -- Sarajevo, access to Tuzla, 
the agreement between the Croats and the Muslims, and Mostar. 
It must be possible to extinguish the other fires in a 
mosaic-like manner, which also includes -- in a symbolic manner 
-- Gorazde. 
  [Gerhard] What about the German contribution? Are we only 
observers or can we participate actively in the peace process? 
  [Kinkel] We cannot send German soldiers to the former 
Yugoslavia because of our constitution. We are very committed 
in the humanitarian area. The political process will be 
continued tomorrow by the 12 foreign ministers in Luxembourg. I 
am in constant contact with my U.S. counterpart and my 
colleagues and friends in the European Union. We are 
participating strongly and are trying to help.

  [Excerpt] Dresden, 14 Apr -- According to the Association 
of Germans and Foreigners in Chemnitz, a Kurd deported to Turkey 
from Saxony was arrested by the police immediately after 
arriving in Istanbul and tortured for three days. They wanted 
him to supply information about the Workers Party of Kurdistan 
[PKK], "although he is not a member of that party," the 
Association's spokesman Klaus Mueller told FRANKFURTER

Cetin's lawyers Christian Fischer and Gert Merzky have sent to 
the Chemnitz court: "We have information that he was also 
physically tortured and that he has visible traces of that 
torture." Cetin was deported on 6 April, together with his wife 
and five children, after his application for asylum was rejected 
on 17 March. Mueller called the fact that the family was 
deported before the period for filing protest expired on 17 
April a "violation of the principle of due course of law."

<F P=106> [Article by Vladimir Zhirinovskiy: "What May One Believe?"] </F>
  [Text] In the few months since my victory at the Russian 
parliamentary elections last December, the so-called opinion 
industry all over the world has painted a strange picture of me, 
which sometimes has little to do with reality and, more often, 
nothing at all. 
<H5>  Dirty Journalism </H5>
  I have experienced the worst baiting from the media in the 
FRG. The yellow press has surpassed itself in inventing events 
in connection with me. Westdeutscher Rundfunk does not even shy 
away from a movie about my assassination by the CIA and the 
Federal Intelligence Service. As "justification" they cite, on 
the one hand, my expected victory at the Russian presidential 
elections and, on the other hand, the absolute lie that I am 
compiling death lists and give orders to death squads. 
Obviously, there is no lowest level for this kind of dirty 
journalism. 
  Thus, I can understand that millions of Germans are 
uncertain 
and see me and my ideas as a danger to Germany. The readers of 
DEUTSCHE NATIONAL-ZEITUNG and DEUTSCHE WOCHEN-ZEITUNG, published 
by my friend Dr. Gerhard Frey, have a right to truthful reports, 
which I have the pleasure to fulfill here. 
<H5>  What We Owe to Our Dead </H5>
  It is in the nature of things that I, as a Russian 
politician, advocate Russian rights and interests, but in my 
view of the world German and Russian rights and interests do not 
oppose each other, but run parallel. Whoever implies that I 
want to restrict the German people in their rights, is turning 
truth upside down. Rather, I am striving for a vital and 
healthy, strong and large, but also German, Germany, as a stable 
partner and lasting friend of Russia. What has proved its worth 
a thousand times over for centuries and has proved to be a 
blessing for both peoples, cannot be wrong. 
  It was, however, wrong, even crazy, that we permitted 
ourselves to be thrown at each other in two murderous world 
wars. Russians and Germans had to make by far the greatest 
sacrifices. We owe it to our dead to learn lessons from that, 
and these lessons can only be: return to the traditional 
German-Russian friendship. 
<H5>  Unprecedented Brainwashing </H5>
  A Russia, which, in whatever form, gets involved on the side 
of the German people's enemies or opponents, would contribute to 
tying Germany to the so-called Western community of values and 
to depriving it of its sovereignty. This is probably a key to 
the immense media baiting against me, which is considered to be 
anti-Russian even by those who are not voters of the Liberal 
Democratic party, and which is obviously aimed at giving rise to 
resentment both in the German and in the Russian peoples. 
  With sincere rage I note that the Germans are expected to 
wander around repenting in sack cloth and ashes and to accept a 
both immoral and unethical collective responsibility and 
collective liability for things that happened long ago. The 
requirements of the present and the needs of the future are to 
be pushed away by a constant, extremely one-sided coming to 
terms with the past. 
  I see the unprecedented brainwashing, to which the Germans 
have been subjected for almost half a century, as the effort to 
lastingly infect the people of poets and thinkers with the 
bacillus of national masochism. 
<H5>  Is National Masochism Healthy? </H5>
  If, however, national masochism is already so good for 
school 
children and also so healthy for adult Germans, there arises the 
question why for any other people in the world the opposite 
standards apply and why, outside Central Europe, practically all 
political movements agree to remember the positive and proud 
parts of history and not to have the development of their own 
people presented by the media like a catalogue of criminals. 
  The fact that foreign politicians make -- often 
inappropriate 
or excessive --suggestions or demands to the Germans, is already 
party of the "normalcy" of our time and is usually cheered 
enthusiastically by the FRG media. Logically, I, who strives 
for Germany's friendship and care for the welfare of the German 
people, am presented as a spawn of hell in the "German" opinion 
industry, even though any thinking person can calculate my 
prospects for becoming Russia's president. 
<H5>  The Point of the Lies </H5>
  The systematic reports of horror stories about me are to sow 
discontent. This is tried to virtually poison the political 
climate between our peoples and states. The calculation of the 
instigators is probably also to gradually undermine my basic 
pro-German attitude through constant slander and bedeviling, and 
to slowly turn me into an enemy of the German people. However, 
I am perfectly able to distinguish between the German people and 
the FRG media, which are basically a work of the victors of 
World War II. 
  All the more intense is my appeal to the German-thinking 
Germans to overcome the resentments of the past, to remember the 
wonderful common points of German-Russian history, and to follow 
with all possible determination a course of eternal friendship 
on the basis of full equal rights between our peoples and states. 
  Our friendship is not directed against anyone and does not 
threaten anyone. However, it is the guarantee for a lasting 
peace in Europe and is, therefore, in the interest of all 
peoples on the continent and, basically, of all the world. Do 
not give those who preach hatred any chance and defend 
understanding among peoples and peace!

  [Text] One day before the hearing of the Federal 
Constitutional Court on armed forces foreign missions, 
Chancellor Kohl has stressed that Germany has to assume 
responsibility at the side of its partners. If peace and 
freedom in the world and Europe are at issue, the FRG must not 
stand aside, Kohl said in Bonn in the morning. 
  During the reception for soldiers who had participated in 
humanitarian and peace missions, the chancellor warned that 
Germany's security and capacity to act in foreign politics are 
based on the allies' confidence. Therefore, the FRG must be a 
reliable partner.

  [Text] Bonn (DDP/ADN) -- The day before the Federal 
Constitutional Court hearing on Bundeswehr missions abroad 
begins, Chancellor Helmut Kohl stressed that Germany must take 
responsibility alongside its partners. Germany should not stand 
aside when "peace and freedom in the world and Europe" are at 
stake, Kohl said this morning in Bonn at a reception for 
servicemen who have taken part in humanitarian and peace 
missions. 
  The chancellor recalled that Germany's security and its 
ability to act in foreign policy terms are based on the trust of 
its allies. Therefore, Germany must be "a reliable partner." 
The Bundeswehr's participation in "measures to safeguard world 
peace as part of the international community" is a key issue of 
German foreign and security policy, he said.

  [Excerpt] Eberswalde (DDP/ADN) -- After 49 years on German 
soil, the Russian military officially left the town of 
Eberswalde [near the Polish border] in Barnim district today. 
Apart from a rearguard contingent of just under 200 men, this 
means that between 25,000 and 30,000 Russian military and 
civilian staff from the 20th Guards Unit have now withdrawn. 
The last few are to follow in approximatelty a month. 
  Some 200 local residents turned up at the Russian memorial 
in 
good spring weather to recall those killed during the liberation 
of the town in 1945. Major General Miron Pavlishin spoke at a 
meeting of "good relations" between the military and the local 
people and of a time in Germany that would not be forgotten. He 
expressed hope that friendships would be maintained. [passage

<F P=106> [Report by Charima Reinhardt: "Army To Shrink Further"] </F>
  [Text] Bonn, 14 Apr -- In the view of Defense Minister 
Volker Ruehe (Christian Democratic Union -- CDU), the Bundeswehr 
is to be reduced to 320,000 troops. Government circles in Bonn 
confirmed on Thursday [14 April] that the security policy 
guidelines announced by Ruehe, to be presented at the end of 
April, also provide for basic military service to be reduced 
from 12 months to 10. 
  The decrease in the number of troops by another 50,000 would 
mean the closure of some additional Bundeswehr sites, and thus a 
new debate on stationing troops. This is one of the reasons why 
resistance to Ruehe's plans is emerging from within the CDU/CSU 
[Christian Social Union]. 
  The CDU/CSU defense experts will meet in Siegen on 24 and 25 
April to work out a sort of counterconcept. The defense experts 
reject Ruehe's argument that a 370,000-strong army cannot be 
financed in view of the shrinking defense budget. They say 
there are a number of other ways to economize. 
  Ruehe, who has had to revise his Bundeswehr concept several 
times because of the budget cuts, considers the guidelines as a 
basis for discussion. There will not be a final concept before 
the October Bundestag elections. The guidelines have been 
agreed upon within the government in principle. This would mean 
that Chancellor Helmut Kohl (CDU) has approved a further cut in 
Bundeswehr troops. At the Munich military defense meeting back 
in February, Kohl had signalled that he wants to stick to 
reducing the Bundeswehr by about half a million to 370,000 
troops.

<F P=106> ["mes"-signed report: "Kanther Wants To Observe </F>
Republikaner More Closely"] 
  [Excerpt] Bonn -- The Federal Office for the Protection of 
the Constitution [BfV] is to observe the right-wing extremist 
Republikaner more closely. This was announced by Interior 
Minister Manfred Kanther (Christian Democratic Union) when he 
presented the 1993 BfV report in Bonn on Thursday [14 April]. 
Indications that the Republikaner are to be rated as a 
right-wing extremist party are getting stronger. The 
Republikaner are "adopting increasingly extremist positions, 
opinions, and methods," Kanther said. But so far, the Federal 
Government could not bring itself to rate the Republikaner as a 
right-wing extremist party. The report only says that the party 
shows "signs of right-wing extremist efforts directed against 
the liberal democratic constitution." The BvF observations are, 
however, "not sufficient to rate all members as right-wing 
extremist." 
  The reason given for this evaluation is that the period of 
observation has been too short. This opinion is not shared by 
all of the 16 laender governments. Eight laender share the 
interior minister's view, while eight think that the 
Republikaner should be rated as a right-wing extremist party. 
  The 1993 BvF report allocates 78 pages, the lion's share, to 
the description of right-wing extremist activities. Left-wing 
extremism is treated on 48 pages. The section on extremist 
activities by foreigners has been markedly expanded, while the 
"traditional" part, counterintelligence, has been reduced to a 
minor role. 
  The BvF concludes that the threat to internal security by 
violent left-wing extremists was more serious in 1993 than in 
1992. In contrast to that, severe public action against 
right-wing extremists has considerably shaken the neo-Nazi scene 
and thus helped decrease violent actions in this group. The 
number of violent crimes committed by foreigners has clearly 
increased, [the BvF report says]. [passage omitted]

<F P=106> [Interview with Bavarian Interior Minister Guenther </F>
Beckstein by unidentified correspondent; place and date not 
given] 
  [Text] [TAGESZEITUNG] Are you satisfied with Bavarian 
politics with respect to internal security? 
  [Beckstein] Yes, we are the safest land in the FRG. We have 
the lowest crime rate of all the federal laender and, at 61.8 
percent, the highest percentage of cases solved. Internal 
security has always been a hallmark of the CSU [Christian Social 
Union], and that will continue to be the case. 
  [TAGESZEITUNG] Your party chairman Waigel has issued the 
slogan for the 1994 elections that the elections will be won 
with topics oriented to the right of center. Internal security 
is also a topic that is typically being emphasized by all the 
political groupings on the extreme Right. Is the CSU using this 
topic in an effort to pick up votes at the right edge of the 
spectrum? 
  [Beckstein] The fact that right extremists seize upon all 
possible topics does not bother me in the least. It does not 
matter whether right extremists ape the CSU in this case. The 
increased crime rate is a problem that is of real concern to the 
citizens. What matters is that we see to it, by means of the 
appropriate security policies, that we get the threatening 
explosion in the crime rate under control. Bavarian politics are 
an important milestone to this end. 
  [TAGESZEITUNG] Internal security seems, in addition, to be 
an 
ideal topic for inclusion of the so-called foreigner question. 
You, too, cannot refrain from constantly talking about the 
"criminality burden of the foreign population." 
  [Beckstein] That is not an accurate statement. According to 
Bavarian crime statistics of 1993, 42.8 percent of all 
investigated crime suspects were non-Germans. Ten years ago, the 
percentage was still 20.1 percent. That is a cause for concern. 
Even if you exclude tourists, illegal immigrants, and 
asylum-seekers, it remains a fact that a fifth of the foreign 
suspects are permanent residents of Bavaria. That is still far 
too many. A study covering 1983 to 1990 revealed that this 
segment of the population had a crime rate two-and-one-half 
times higher than the Germans living in Bavaria. It is true, of 
course, that the sociological stratification of the foreign 
population is different from that of the Germans. 
  [TAGESZEITUNG] If it is known that these figures are not 
meaningful, figures which naturally always provide ammunition 
for right extremists, then why do you not simply refrain from 
using them? 
  [Beckstein] You don't solve problems by closing your eyes to 
them, but rather by noting them and finding ways to solve them. 
  [TAGESZEITUNG] As the interior minister of a land which has 
the Republikaner watched by the Office for the Protection of the 
Constitution, you are probably very familiar with the program of 
the Republikaner. How do you assess the agreement between the 
CSU and the Republikaner programs in the asylum and internal 
security sectors? 
  [Beckstein] The Republikaner have carefully cleaned up their 
act. They are taking care that their public statements and their 
program do not cause them to be perceived as an extremist, but 
rather as an exemplary democratic, party. It is for that reason 
that we, like most of the other interior ministers as well, are 
having the Republikaner observed by intelligence means, to 
enable us to lay bare their real right extremist convictions. 
Basically, however, a true statement is not rendered 
questionable by the fact that it is being similarly voiced by 
others with whom one does not like to be associated. 
  [TAGESZEITUNG] Streibl is meeting with Schoenhuber; 
Gauweiler 
calls the Republikaner "a little to the right," and Haider an 
"interesting politician." Must the CSU itself not submit to 
observation in the near future? 
  [Beckstein] Many of the people asking such questions do so 
with a great deal of hypocrisy. Anyone who proudly grants Herr 
Gysi and people from the PDS [Party of Democratic Socialism] a 
forum to make public statements has little right to prohibit 
others from having a private conversation with someone. What is 
decisive for me, however, is this: There will not be cooperation 
between the CSU and the Republikaner. The SPD [Social Democratic 
Party of Germany] ought to state this just as clearly with 
respect to the PDS, however. We need to apply the same standards 
to the right and to the left... 
  [TAGESZEITUNG] ...You can't always set the one off against 
the other. There is no doubt but that the Streibl-Schoenhuber 
meeting enhanced the status of the leader of the Republikaner... 
  [Beckstein] ...There are many meetings between prominent SPD 
people and Gysi, the representative of a clearly 
unconstitutional party... 
  [TAGESZEITUNG] ...Was the meeting politically wrong, or not? 
  [Beckstein] It was not a political meeting. No office-holder 
spoke with Schoenhuber. Streibl had resigned, was only a private 
person, therefore. Whether the meeting was politically smart is 
another question. 
  [TAGESZEITUNG] When one inquires into the causes for the 
rising crime rate and brutality, you often bring up, as an 
argument, the values decline caused by the "cultural revolution 
of 1968." Franz Schoenhuber uses the identical argument. 
  [Beckstein] I am not familiar with the details of what 
Schoenhuber says in this connection. I am, however, familiar 
with comparable reflections by Heiner Geissler, who can surely 
not be called a rightist. The anonymization of society, the 
weakening of bonds to certain basic values--these are 
indisputably important causes of the increasing crime rate and 
the willingness to resort to force. For the new laender, there 
are additional aspects. 
  [TAGESZEITUNG] The demand is often voiced for national 
identity to be reestablished as a basic value of a strong state. 
"The state must be perceived again as a protective community 
sharing a common destiny." To whom would you ascribe this 
statement, to Wolfgang Schaeuble or to Franz Schoenhuber? 
  [Beckstein] I don't know who said this... 
  [TAGESZEITUNG] ...It stems from Schaeuble... 
  [Beckstein] ...But it is clear that a state has a special 
responsibility for its citizens. The fact that, in the 
international arena, we must also give consideration to German 
interests is a self-evident fact as far as I am concerned. 
  [TAGESZEITUNG] Wolfgang Schaeuble argues that Germany lacks 
the national consciousness to make social conflicts 
controllable. Do we need a redefinition of terms in the 
direction of a greater national consciousness? 
  [Beckstein] For me, the question is: How can I explain to 
the 
citizen in the old laender that we are transferring 150 billion 
German marks every year to the new laender. This is, you know, 
related to the fact that the new laender are a part of Germany 
and that we therefore have a significantly greater obligation to 
practice solidarity. It is precisely the feeling of solidarity 
by the average citizen that forms the basis for his 
understanding the need for restrictions. That is a rational 
explanation. There is also an irrational one: Precisely in a 
society that is becoming more anonymous, it is necessary that 
one feels a certain bond. I consider it self-evident that, 48 
years after the end of World War II, a feeling of nationalism, 
not exaggerated but definitely self-assured, emerges in the FRG 
as well. If someone asks me abroad where I come from, I say 
proudly that I am a German, one who draws a part of his identity 
from the tradition of his people, with all the strengths and 
weaknesses that our history has. To deny this would be unreal. 
That would only mean that we feel even less rooted in our 
homeland and have even greater problems.

<F P=106> [Unattributed article: "The Thing From Space"] </F>
  [Text] An obscure research institute is working for the 
military and for the Federal German Intelligence Services (BND). 
It is costing Bonn a lot of money. 
  From a distance, the monstrous dome towering over the 
village 
of Werthoven near Bonn looks like a space station. Anyone 
trying to learn the answer to the puzzle that dominates the 
rural idyll here quickly gets into trouble. "No photography 
here," say the guards to curious sightseers. "Go back, this is 
of no concern to you." 
  The guards watch over one of Germany's secret institutes, 
the 
Research Institute of Applied Natural Sciences (FGAN). 
  According to peace researcher Erich Schmidt-Ennboom, the 
institute in question, unusual in that it is a registered 
association entitled to be treated as a charity and enjoying tax 
privileges, is a BND front. German reconnaissance personnel, 
whose work is supposed to be limited solely to foreign countries 
according to the law, are using this institute to develop new 
espionage and reconnaissance methods without being disturbed. 
  Even Bundestag deputies consider the enterprise a "quite 
mysterious affair," which, according to one security expert, "no 
one has taken a closer look at." 
  But for members of the Budget Committee, "Effgann," as it is 
called by insiders, is supposedly not so mysterious. It is 
virtually a federal enterprise. With an annual budget of 65 
million marks [DM], the mysterious institute is almost fully 
financed out of the federal budget. In 1994, only DM100,000 of 
this DM65 million came from private sources. 
  The members of the institute are an exclusive group. For 
years, the exclusive circle has never exceeded ten. They 
include leading enterprises in the German armaments industry 
such as Dasa, Siemens, Dornier, Atlas Elektronik, and MAN 
Gutehoffnungshuete. 
  The institute's task is the pursuance of "scientific 
research 
mainly in the fields of electronics, cybernetics, and 
information science," in the "interests of national defense." 
  But in fact, FGAN is paid for by Defense Minister Volker 
Ruehe, who lavishes out of his ministerial budget some DM41 
million for operations, almost DM4 million for investments, and 
DM19 million for projects. 
  "Original defense research constitutes almost 100 percent of 
the institute's work," says Horst Heger, executive member of the 
board. Appropriately enough, the institute's clientele is 
restricted. The recipients of the institute's work are the 
defense minister and the armaments industry. This work is 
actually performed at state expense. In any case, contributions 
from members do not possess any significance in the FGAN 
business plan. 
  If necessary, the scientists also supply information to the 
Federal Chancellery and "other relevant and competent organs in 
the federation and in the laender," says board chairman 
Friedrich Wiekhorst, thereby suggesting recipients whose names 
are better left undisclosed, such as the secret services. 
  Altogether, FGAN maintains six agencies whose capacity is 
closely linked to military and intelligence needs. For 
instance, the Research Institute for High Frequency Physics 
(FHP) is developing new radar procedures to improve "efficiency, 
even in the face of enemy weapons." 
  With an antenna of 34 meters in diameter, the Wethhoven 
station is the "largest radar facility in Europe," claims 
Wiekhorst. With it, the scientists can observe the functions 
and operations of even military satellites high in earth's 
orbit. Wiekhorst: "We are not looking for stars. We just want 
to know what is going on up there." Wiekhorst brushes aside a 
question whether the intelligence service lies at the roots of 
all this research. "We take a look at the things up there and 
draw conclusions," he says. 
  During the Cold War, the scientists, considered the best in 
the world, would have "cooperated to the best of their ability 
in preventing a surprise attack," says Wiekhorst. The Federal 
Government had committed them to this task. But Wiekhorst says 
the institute has no idea who receives the results of 
observations and experiments on an individual basis. 
  The institute's Research Institute for Radio and Mathematics 
develops mathematical and technical procedures for computers on 
reconnaissance systems, something also of great interest to 
intelligence services. "After all, we have the right to listen 
to the electromagnetic waves that flow through our facility," 
says Wiekhorst. 
  Wiekhorst dismisses as a "lie" the accusation that FGAN with 
its subsidiaries is merely one of the BND's fronts. Needless to 
say, the BND in Pullach does not deny "points of contact" with 
FGAN. A leading BND official says that there have been contacts 
between FGAN and the BND "for ages." There is "nothing 
exciting" about that. It is just a "well-worn story among the 
employees." 
  The institute's eavesdropping and surveillance experts have 
allegedly taken part in "specialized talks between the BND and 
the Bundeswehr leadership" for a long time. The FHP high 
frequency physicists cooperate with BND Department III 
(Analysis) in matters concerning space flight reconnaissance and 
satellite observation. In addition, the institute has received 
occasional requests from the BND to perform a particular study. 
  However, whether or not the confidential cooperation will 
continue to run so smoothly in the future hangs in the balance 
because the fiscal authorities are knocking on the research 
institute's door. 
  The tax office at St. Augustin near Bonn doubts whether the 
research work is "exclusively and directly for the common 
welfare," something which the FGAN has been claiming for years 
in order to be exempt from turnover tax. 
  Both the tax office and the Finance Ministry in Dusseldorf 
agree that research in defense technology "is not directly 
connected to the broad common good." As a result, a legal 
dispute has been brewing in the fiscal court in Cologne for five 
years. 
  A defeat there could prove very expensive for researchers in 
defense and intelligence work. Their tax arrears already add up 
to over DM70 million. "And we cannot pay that," moans Wiekhorst.

<F P=106> ["gb" report: "Markets Hardly React to Prime Rate </F>
Reduction"] 
  [Text] Frankfurt/Main, 14 Apr -- On Thursday [14 April] 
the Central Bank Council of the German Bundesbank lowered the 
discount rate from 5.25 to 5 percent and the Lombard rate from 
6.75 to 6.5 percent. The financial markets briefly reacted to 
this slight loosening of monetary policy with higher rates, but 
they quickly calmed down. While the lowering of the Lombard 
rate was no surprise for most dealers on the market, only a few 
observers had predicted a lower discount rate. In the afternoon 
the central banks of other European countries -- including 
Austria, Switzerland, the Netherlands, Belgium, and Denmark -- 
reduced their prime rates. Bundesbank President Hans Tietmeyer 
expects the interest rates for customers of banks and savings 
banks also to go down, depending on the market situation. 
  Tietmeyer justified the reduction of the prime rate above 
all 
with the declining inflation rate. In the course of the year 
the Bundesbank expects another decline, so that during the 
second half there might indeed be a "two in front of the decimal 
point." As an important reason for easing tensions on prices, 
he cited the latest wage agreements. In addition, by continuing 
its policy of slow interest-rate reductions, the Bundesbank 
wants to make a contribution to stabilizing the financial 
markets and thus also to consolidating the trust of foreign 
investors in the long-term stability of the German mark [DM]. 
In contrast, the policy of rapid interest-rate reductions, as 
recommended by critics of the Bundesbank, could revive fears of 
inflation, which would damage confidence in the German mark 
  Tietmeyer announced that in the future, too, the Bundesbank 
will stick to a policy that is, above all, oriented toward the 
development of the money supply. In the long term, the 
connection between the growth of the money supply and the 
acceleration of inflation remains unchanged. He said that the 
high growth rates at the beginning of the year had been 
distorted by special factors. In the course of the year a 
decline of the growth rate of the M3 money supply is expected. 
Vice President Johann Wilhelm Gaddum said it is possible that 
the increase in the money supply will be between 4 and 6 percent 
during the fourth quarter of the year, as intended by the 
Bundesbank. 
  In addition, the Central Bank Council decided to pass on 
DM18.26 billion of the Bundesbank's net profit of DM18.83 
billion, after allocation to the reserves, for the past business 
year to the Federal Government, as the Bundesbank's owner. In 
the afternoon, FRG Finance Minister Theo Waigel announced that 
DM11 billion of this sum would be used to repay state debt.

<F P=106> ["uhl"-signed report: "Bluem Rejects Reproach Concerning </F>
Dismantling of Social System"] 
  [Text] Bonn -- Against the votes of the opposition, the 
coalition, which holds a majority in the Bundestag, has adopted 
the 1994 Employment Promotion Act. It is part of the action 
program for increased growth and employment. 
  The opposition claimed that the law does not deserve this 
name because it does not create any new jobs, in spite of 4 
million unemployed. It accused the Christian Democratic 
Union/Christian Social Union and the Free Democratic Party of 
Germany of dismantling the social system and of neglecting the 
interests of the unemployed and of the employees. Labor 
Minister Norbert Bluem (CDU) rejected the attacks, stressing 
that the Federal Government has built the social system in the 
past 10 years because it contributed to the creation of 3 
million new jobs. Whereas the Federal Employment Office spent 
9.1 billion German marks [DM] for active labor market policy in 
1982, this sum has increased to DM54 billion today. 
  The law provides for the following measures: 

  -  Basically, 
the Federal Employment Office promotes the transition from 
unemployment to self-employment during a period of 26 months in 
the form of a transitional allowance. 
  -  The assessment basis for 
employment within the job creation scheme is limited to 80 
percent of the payment for unpromoted work to make it possible 
to include more jobless in the scheme. 
  -  Private employment 
agencies will be permitted throughout Germany. The permission 
for private agencies will be granted by the Federal Employment 
Office. The permission cannot be denied if reliability, the 
required qualification, an orderly financial situation, and 
suitable premises are given. The fees must be paid by the 
employers. 
  -  The Employment Promotion Act, which also allows 
limited contracts, will be extended until 31 December 2000. 
  -  The 
conversion of payments instead of wages into wage cost subsidies 
according to Section 249-H of the Employment Promotion Act, 
which have so far only been applicable in eastern Germany, will 
be extended to west German regions that are particularly hard 
hit by structural crises. 
  -  Persons who switch from full-time jobs 
to part-time jobs will receive payments for full employment for 
three years if they lose their jobs. 
  -  Recipients of unemployment 
assistance can be forced for a maximum period of three months to 
work as seasonal workers in agriculture and forestry as well as 
in the processing of fruits and vegetables. If they work at 
least six hours per day, they will receive a seasonal worker 
subsidy of DM25 daily in additional to their 
wages. 
  -  Entrepreneurs who employ illegal workers will be excluded 
from public orders for a limited period. 
  -  Workers in training 
schemes will receive payment for short-time work in the event of 
a loss of working hours.

<F P=106> [Article by Martin Winter: "Rudolf Scharping Builds Bridges </F>
Across the Atlantic"] 
  [Text] Washington -- Rudolf Scharping, who wants to beat 
Helmut Kohl with domestic issues -- including jobs, economic 
upswing, and social justice -- travels a great deal in the 
world. For good reason. When drafting strategies for the 
election campaign, the candidate for chancellor arrived at the 
conclusion months ago that he must "deprive the Christian 
Democratic Union [CDU] of the illusion" that it can brand him as 
a foreign-policy amateur and thus as a risk for German security. 
In fact, foreign policy will not play a major role in the 
election campaign, but Scharping knows that in a neck-and-neck 
race foreign skepticism concerning his policies might supply the 
CDU with ammunition. 
  Trying to prevent this on the basis of the slogan that good 
and well-informed friends do not say bad things about oneself, 
Scharping decided to visit the Commission of the European Union 
in Brussels, Paris, Prague, Washington, New York, Warsaw, and 
the NATO headquarters. He introduces himself and promises 
continuity in German foreign policy. He spent five full days in 
the United States to convince political and economic figures 
there. He did not go there without any fears. A cool reception 
and a critical press would have been a pleasure for his rival 
Helmut Kohl. Anticipating such a turn of events, Juergen 
Ruettgers, the parliamentary manager of the CDU/Christian Social 
Union [CSU] Bundestag group, maliciously predicted a great 
humiliation for Scharping because the Social Democratic Party 
[SPD] is "unable to pursue a responsible policy within the 
alliance," and because it would "completely abandon the Western 
community" together with the Greens. This only makes the 
Atlantic-minded Scharping laugh. 
  Yet he was nervous about how things would go. Only when he 
had returned from his meeting with President Bill Clinton, did 
he look relaxed. "All went off really well," he stated 
repeatedly and ordered a cold beer in the press room of the 
Watergate Hotel. "This will support the current strong process 
of relaxation," he stated. Contented, he stretched on a sofa and 
admitted: "I feel much better now than on Sunday evening." 
  However, it became clear after his arrival on Sunday [10 
April] that both Social Democratic fears and Christian Democrat 
hopes were unjustified. Scharping's reception was open and 
friendly -- the American way. Yet there was a little more to 
it that was not noticeable when former SPD chancellor candidates 
like Johannes Rau, Hans Jochen Vogel, and Oskar Lafontaine 
visited the United States: Curiosity combined with attention 
that, between the White House and Capitol, is only devoted to 
those who have political weight or who are expected to assume a 
high office soon. 
  The candidate found open doors everywhere. With Clinton, he 
had a "surprisingly friendly and informal conversation," 
Scharping stated. The same is true of the meeting with 
Secretary of State Warren Christopher, Treasury Secretary Lloyd 
Bentsen, and Defense Secretary William Perry. Senior Senate 
officials and congressmen took their time, and when Scharping 
gave a speech at an event jointly organized by the 
Friedrich-Ebert Foundation and the U.S. Institute for 
Contemporary German Studies, the room was packed. In New York, 
the Social Democrats met with important bankers, industrialists, 
and top journalists. As a senior official put it, they all 
wanted to "get to know the man who leads Kohl in the polls," and 
whom prior to his visit the major papers NEW YORK TIMES and 
WASHINGTON POST had benevolently described as Kohl's possible 
successor and the German Clinton. That certainly impressed the 
White House. 
  Scharping is pleased about the comparison with Clinton. "In 
fact, we are examining what Clinton has initiated in the United 
States." He sees common interests, a common "way of thinking" 
in environmental and tax policies, and, above all, there is the 
joint conviction that a country can only be stable and act in a 
responsible way in foreign policy if it is internally stable -- 
which is not possible if unemployment is high. 
  This is a language that builds bridges and is understood by 
the Americans. It has become known as "new thinking," and a 
new generation of politicians is emerging. Scharping and 
Clinton are about the same age, both protested against the war 
in Vietnam -- the SPD chairman was even temporarily excluded 
from his party because of that in 1968 -- and both were 
influenced by the policies of the 1960's and 1970's. Bob 
Bradley, a Democratic Senator from New Jersey, has described his 
friend Scharping as the "most prominent politician of the German 
postwar generation." Yet, despite the things that Clinton and 
Scharping have in common, Washington does not hide the fact that 
it is interested in a stable and predictable German Government 
-- no matter who leads it. Kohl's advantage over Scharping is 
that he is well-known at the White House, and that the U.S. 
Administration believes that it is able to judge him correctly. 
  During a dinner hosted in honor of the candidate, 
appreciation was expressed, but also fears concerning Germany's 
future: It might not master unification, it might try to pursue 
its own paths, and it might lose its stability. Moreover, a 
Chancellor Scharping might be forced by his party to adopt a 
foreign-policy course that he does not like. There are people 
like Lafontaine and some others who are not so dedicated to the 
West and NATO, it was pointed out. 
  It is these fears, which were only voiced very cautiously 
and 
in a friendly way in the United Sates, but which the CDU might 
turn into heavy weapons in the election campaign, that prompt 
Scharping to tour the world. He is hammering his foreign policy 
credo into the heads of politicians and journalists as though he 
wanted to cut it into granite: Friendship with the United 
States, Germany's integration in the European Union, NATO's 
continued and "indispensable" existence, and aid for the 
development of stable democracies in Russia and the Central and 
East European countries. 
  To convince even the last doubters, Scharping simply 
invented 
a new law -- that of the continuity of German foreign policy. 
Thus, Social Democratic Chancellors Brandt and Schmidt 
continued Adenauer's world policy and developed their ostpolitik 
on this basis. The current chancellor then continued the 
ostpolitik "in a completely correct manner." The next 
chancellor will keep this good tradition. 
  Scharping prepared his trip to the United States 
systematically. Largely unnoticed by the government and the 
public, he started establishing personal contacts and using the 
existing ones after his election as SPD chairman. Only when the 
French expressed appreciation of this with the statement by the 
French ambassador to Bonn that President Francois Mitterrand 
considers Scharping an "excellent man," did the government wake 
up painfully. At the security meeting in Munich on 5 February, 
Scharping clearly supported the Atlantic orientation in his 
speech, which was carefully read in Washington -- and approved 
of, as the meeting with Clinton and Christopher showed. 
  What occasionally seems to be a solo effort by the party 
leader is supported by the SPD leadership. Scharping skillfully 
combined the different foreign policy schools in a group that 
advises him and must therefore be loyal. The group includes 
figures like Heidemarie Wieczorek-Zeul, Hans Ulrich Klose, 
Norbert Gansel, and Karsten Voigt. For many years, the SPD 
presented a picture of a party quarreling over foreign-policy 
issues, but now it shows discipline. Nobody "has had to give up 
his contours," Scharping claims. However, the picture "again has 
a frame and a center." He leaves no doubt as to who the center 
is. For simple minds, he quotes a soccer rule: "No discussions 
are allowed on the ground." 
  So far, his coplayers have observed the rule. Scharping 
fears only one thing: That one of them might get "dragged into 
a discussion" by the CDU whether a government consisting of 
Greens and Social Democrats might adopt a different foreign 
policy. Those who enter into such a debate "weaken the SPD's 
opportunities," he stated with a threatening undertone. Yet 
this is exactly what the CDU intends to do, now that the Free 
Democratic Party has said it wants to continue the current 
coalition, depriving the SPD of one possible constellation for a 
coalition. Scharping is aware of the danger that the SPD might 
sink together with the Greens in a boat during the election 
campaign. Therefore, he announced in the United States that the 
Greens' resolutions on NATO and the Bundeswehr are "nonsense" to 
which he will never agree. 
  After his five-day visit to the United States, Scharping 
radiates the security of a candidate who feels confident about 
his complicated foreign-policy flank. The only time he still 
reacts brusquely is when asked about Bundeswehr participation in 
international missions. First, the SPD supports all UN 
operations that can realistically be expected in the next 10 
years, he usually replies. Second, he and the SPD will not back 
missions like the Gulf War, and third, he is tired of the 
typical German debates about hypothetical reactions to 
hypothetical situations. As though trying to dispel all doubts 
about his rejection of war missions, Scharping visited the 
Vietnam Memorial -- as he always does when he is in Washington. 
The names of the over 50,000 soldiers who fell in Vietnam are 
engraved in black stone. The polished stone reflects the images 
of the visitors. "In this way, one can see one's own picture 
when reading the names of the dead," Scharping stated, shaking 
his head about those who advocate the participation of the 
Bundeswehr in wars.

<F P=106> [Kurt Kister commentary: "Knight Rudolf Is Consecrated by </F>
Washington"] 
  [Text] Washington, 14 Apr -- It is a ritual of German-U.S. 
politics that every four years the candidate of the opposition 
party travels to Washington to assure the Americans, on the one 
hand, that everything will basically be the same after a change 
of power in Bonn. On the other hand, the visit serves to signal 
to the voter at home that the candidate can move on an 
international level: In the realm of symbolic politics, the 
handshake with the respective master in the White House 
corresponds to knighting in the Department for Foreign Countries 
[as published]. 
  Since Tuesday [12 April], the new warrior has been Knight 
Rudolf of Palatinate. He was "noticed" with more than the usual 
interest in Washington; it is also known there that Scharping 
has a realistic chance of replacing Kohl. Altogether, Scharping 
made a good showing. His reserve, his self-confidence, and his 
occasionally demure friendliness left the image of a serious, 
responsible politician. 
  Although the Social Democratic Party of Germany [SPD] 
chairman did not tire of stressing the basic continuity of 
German foreign policy in the event of his assumption of power, 
differences appeared when one had a closer look. This was most 
clearly shown in the debate on the form and extent of Germany's 
possible participation in UN military actions. Scharping -- he 
said this repeatedly -- left Washington with the conviction that 
in the White House and on Capitol Hill this question is regarded 
as far less urgent than it is presented in the government 
coalition and the media in Germany. He does not believe that 
Washington wants to or will exercise political pressure on the 
Germans in this respect. 
  From the point of view of the campaigner, this argumentation 
is understandable. The SPD is attacked by the Christian 
Democratic Union [CDU] and the Free Democratic Party of Germany 
[FDP] because of its alleged attitude of refusal. Moreover, 
parts of the party are still feuding with Scharping because they 
do not want to put up with his blue-helmet line. Therefore, it 
is in Scharping's interest to invalidate at least the accusation 
that the United States is putting pressure on the Germans. 
  All that reminds one a little bit of the fact that nobody 
discusses the fire brigade as long as there is no fire. At 
present, there is no immediate occasion for the Americans to 
accuse the Germans of dodging. However, neither Bonn's 
checkbook diplomacy during the Gulf war nor beating about the 
bush over the AWACS mission in the Balkans or the public 
relations action in Beledwynne have been forgotten. Even though 
nobody told it to Scharping in this form, German fears of an 
increased UN commitment are like a shadow on the lung that 
provides the transatlantic relations with breath. 
  Not in vain did the Senate adopt two resolutions that say 
explicitly that Germany should create the political and 
constitutional prerequisites for "full" participation in UN 
military actions. The pressure that Scharping did not (yet) 
feel this week is developing there, for example.

<F P=106> [Editorial by Christoph Bertram: "Upon a Thread"] </F>
  [Text] Not to get bogged down in the "mire of the Balkans" 
-- this has been the West's motto ever since the beginning of 
the war in the former Yugoslavia. This is why there was no 
early military intervention that would probably have prevented 
the war; this is why the West has deceived itself believing that 
it had met its international responsibility with its 
"humanitarian aid" for those who were threatened by guns and 
displaced with bayonets; this is also why the UN Security 
Council has churned out resolutions by the dozen, resolutions 
that sounded but were hardly meant seriously as far as their 
potential effect was concerned. 
  Yet, instead of keeping firm ground under its feet, the 
international organization and the West were more and more drawn 
into the mire as a result of their half-hearted actions; they 
were made to pay for earlier mistakes. When, last weekend, the 
Muslim enclave Gorazde threatened to fall into the hands of its 
besiegers, the Bosnian Serbs, after 10 days of fighting, NATO 
for the first time in its history intervened in a ground war 
with combat aircraft. And the U.S. President, the secretary 
generals of the United Nations and NATO declared in unison that 
the Serbs would have to expect further strikes of this kind if 
they continued their bombings -- not only in Gorazde, but also 
the other ruined cities in Bosnia-Herzegovina declared as "safe 
heavens" by the United Nations, which have long since become 
huge refugee camps. 
  He who has got stuck in the mire no longer has a choice. 
Therefore, there is no alternative to the air strikes against 
the Serbian besiegers of Gorazde and, unless they stop, to 
further such actions. After all, the fall of Gorazde would not 
only have surrendered 65,000 Muslim refugees to "ethnic 
cleansing." It would also have led to the collapse of the 
ingenious structure of negotiations and compromise opportunities 
that the United Nations, the United States, and Russia as 
negotiators, in particular, have been trying to put together for 
two months. 
  Yet -- and this also makes up the tragedy of the belated 
action -- the military operation necessary for the success of 
the negotiations, has, at the same time, threatened to thwart 
these chances. It has instigated the Serbs, although being 
tired of the war, to act defiantly. It encourages the Bosniaks 
to continue to pursue the war option. And it has irritated the 
Russians: Boris Yeltsin was not even informed let alone 
consulted about the UN punitive action in advance. 
  So what is to be done to prevent the chances for peace, 
which 
opened thanks to the NATO ultimatum for Sarajevo in February, to 
be now spoiled again by the NATO bombing for Gorazde? 
  One thing is that Russia must not only be involved in the 
strategy of the negotiations, but even into that of military 
pressure. True, the Russian representative in the UN Security 
Council almost one year ago agreed to the resolutions on which 
the United Nations and NATO can base their action. Yet, Russia 
has now become indispensable for the success of the negotiations 
in the Balkans. The government in Moscow wants to be taken 
seriously, which means that it wants to be a partner with equal 
rights in the UN team. Otherwise, what the supreme war criminal 
in the Balkans, Serb President Milosevic, is obviously 
speculating, might really happen: that Moscow becomes a stooge 
for Serbian interests. 
  The other thing is: Should the negotiations in the Balkans 
be promoted, then military sanctions would have to be 
predictable for the addressee, which, for too long, they were 
not. On the contrary, the actions of Western fighter bombers at 
Gorazde could have probably been prevented had the UN 
authorities in Bosnia and the U.S. Government in Washington not 
initially conveyed the impression to the Bosnian Serbs that the 
city had virtually been awarded to them. 
  The conditions for the military intervention have now 
finally 
been unequivocally defined. Had they been as unambiguous 
before, the chances for peace would not hang upon a thread 
today. After all, it remains the only rope by which the West 
can pull itself out of the mire in the Balkans again.

<F P=106> [Interview with Finance Minister Eduardo Catroga by Virgilio </F>
Azevedo, Francisco Ferreira da Silva, and Luis Tiberio; place 
and date not given] 
  [Excerpt] [passage omitted] 
<H5>  Economic Policy </H5>
  [EXPRESSO] Is it possible right now to give some basic 
guidelines of the state budget for 1995? 
  [Catroga] The 1995 budget's basic guideline is the 
continuation of the aim of budgetary consolidation. In 1995 we 
wish to do better than in 1994, within the context of concern to 
achieve a sound course for public finances. 
  [EXPRESSO] But do the Revised Convergence Program (PCR) 
figures still stand? 
  [Catroga] That is the goal for now and for 1995. In the 
Portuguese convergence program, the target for the deficit is 
around 5 percent. 
  [EXPRESSO] In the state budget, the average for 1995-96 is 
around 4.75 to 5 percent.... 
  [Catroga] We succeeded in moving from a deficit of 10 
percent of GDP in 1985 to 3.3 percent in 1992. Hence we will 
certainly be able to achieve the budgetary consolidation aims in 
the medium term, with the contribution of economic recovery, 
success in the struggle against tax evasion, and success in the 
constant improvement of the tax authorities' efficiency. For 
next year, we hope that the economic recovery will accelerate, 
in line with the European economies' prospects for 1995. 
  [EXPRESSO] "Will accelerate...." Do you mean that you now 
believe in an economic recovery in 1994? 
  [Catroga] I have said that the main aim of economic policy 
for 1994 and 1995 is the creation of conditions for a sustained 
and noninflationary economic recovery. Three or four months 
ago, I said that there were hopes and some signs. I now 
emphasize: There are very positive signs. 
  [EXPRESSO] What are they? 
  [Catroga] In the first place, the indicators of confidence. 
I have just received a Confederation of Portuguese Industry 
survey of manufacturing industry that shows a significant 
improvement in the indicators of confidence, enterprises' order 
books, and employers' expectations of new investments. If we 
compare the levels of operating capacity in October 1993 with 
the figures available in January 1994, we will see that there 
was an increase of around 4 percent in the rate of use of 
production capacity. 
  If we analyze the industrial production indexes, we find 
that 
since July there has been some change for the better. There are 
also positive signs in the tourism sector: Tourist demand for 
this year has increased substantially. There are also some 
positive signs in the sphere of agriculture: This year, for the 
first time in many years, we have favorable weather conditions 
that have made it possible to restore the water level in dams 
and for spring crops to grow normally. 
  [EXPRESSO] But there are also unfavorable signs.... 
  [Catroga] There are, such as, for instance, the consumption 
of cement and steel in the first two months of 1994. This is 
linked to the normal lag in the construction sector's reaction 
to the economic cycle -- especially in the civil construction 
sector. 
  In any event, there are positive signs from the external 
demand side, and signs in the European economies that are also a 
mixture of encouragement and apprehension: Encouragement, 
because the indicators at the European level show a 
strengthening of confidence over the past four months; 
apprehension in view of the weakness of the recovery of some 
locomotive economies (such as the German economy) and the French 
and Spanish economies' uncertain trends. 
  These are contradictory signs, as is characteristic, 
moreover, of a period of a change of trend. Because of all this, 
I believe that there will be a recovery. It will be slow and 
difficult, but it will happen. 
  [EXPRESSO] Right now in 1994? 
  [Catroga] In 1994, there should be some recovery, albeit 
insignificant. The level of economic activity is expected to 
rise gradually in the second half of this year, and more 
strongly in the course of 1995, in line with the European 
economies. 
  [EXPRESSO] What will Portuguese economic growth be this 
year? 
  [Catroga] The favorable and unfavorable external and 
internal factors do not yet enable us to draw conclusions for a 
revision of the macroeconomic scenario underlying the budget for 
1994. So, right now, the government's goals are still the 
same.... 
  [EXPRESSO] With respect to all the indicators? 
  [Catroga] With respect to all the indicators. There are no 
figures as yet for undertaking a revision, so those indicators 
still seem possible. An economic recovery is taking shape that 
will be modest in 1994 and stronger in 1995. I have always 
said, and I repeat, that the recovery will be slow and difficult. 
  [EXPRESSO] Do you still believe in the goal of a 5.5 percent 
inflation rate set in the state budget for this year? 
  [Catroga] I believe that right now there are no grounds in 
this, as in the other macroeconomic variables, for changing the 
macroeconomic scenario projected in drafting the budget. The 
inflation target is difficult but not impossible. Moreover, the 
inflation rate has now fallen; it resumed its downward trend in 
December.... 
  [EXPRESSO] In annual terms, yes, but not in monthly terms. 
  [Catroga] In annual terms it is now 6.2 percent.... 
  [EXPRESSO] But in monthly terms that trend is not confirmed. 
  [Catroga] No, there are always month-to-month fluctuations, 
but there is a much more important factor (to which analysts do 
not always pay due attention) -- the trend in inflation in terms 
of comparable fluctuations in the nonnegotiable goods sector 
[sector dos bens nao transaccionaveis]. The nonnegotiable goods 
sector, which showed considerable resistance to the fall in 
inflation until November, clearly fell from December. From 8.8 
percent in November, it then fell to 7.8 percent and 7.6 
percent. Now this is a favorable factor. 
  [EXPRESSO] There are economists who say that if the current 
monthly rate of growth of inflation -- around 0.7 percent -- 
persists, we will reach the end of the year with a rate close to 
8 percent, and that we will succeed in reaching last year's 
inflation rate only by reducing it to 0.5 percent per month. 
  [Catroga] It is always possible to devise several scenarios. 
The scenarios depend on the assumptions. Many of those analysts 
also did not believe that the government would achieve the goal 
of 6.5 percent in 1993, just as they did not believe that the 
8.9 percent target in 1992 was attainable. I say that it is a 
difficult and challenging, but not impossible, target, and that 
it remains a goal of economic policy to continue the process of 
deflating the Portuguese economy within the framework of the 
targets set. 
  [EXPRESSO] Let us turn to monetary policy and interest 
rates.... 
  [Catroga] The other central banks' benchmark rates [taxas 
directoras] have gradually moved downward, and so the Bank of 
Portugal, using its powers to implement monetary policy, which 
it exercises independently, took the view that there are 
conditions for a fall in benchmark rates. I will be more 
specific: The Bank of Portugal's liquidity transfer rate [taxa 
de cedencia de liquidez] in real terms (that is, nominal rates 
minus inflation) was around 8.1 percent 31 March 1993, as 
against 8.6 percent in Spain. Today, the Bank of Portugal's 
benchmark rate in real terms is around 3.6 percent, and in Spain 
it is 2.8 percent.... 
  [EXPRESSO] According to the prime minister, interest rates 
will fall another 2 percent. 
  [Catroga] No. What the prime minister said was that in a 
scenario in which inflation falls to around 5 percent, and in 
which there is success in the policy of budgetary consolidation, 
in the wage restraint policy, and in the fight against 
inflation...with all these assumptions it is natural for 
benchmark rates to fall! That is what he said. 
  [EXPRESSO] But some economists have said that the repetition 
of the "promise" of a fall in interest rates in official 
speeches has now brought the situation to such a pass that there 
is no longer room for maneuver.... 
  [Catroga] Confusion between benchmark rates and credit 
market rates has become widespread. In the case of benchmark 
rates, the room for maneuver depends on the trend in inflation 
and the trend in the other banks' central benchmark rates. So 
it will be concluded on the basis of the trend in these two 
variables whether or not there is room for maneuver. We believe 
that the trend in the other European central banks' central 
benchmark rates is downward, and we believe that the tendency 
will be for the downward trend for the inflation rate to 
continue. Accordingly, and without prejudice to exchange rate 
targets, if these conditions are fulfilled, conditions for a 
sustained and gradual fall in interest rates will continue to 
exist. 
  [EXPRESSO] Are you not worried that we have witnessed an 
upsurge in short-term interest rates? 
  [Catroga] They are not benchmark rates, and we must not 
confuse erratic movements, which are sometimes the result of 
certain specific daily developments, with structural trends.... 
  [EXPRESSO] And are you also not worried by the market's 
nervous reactions? There was, in fact, a nervous reaction to 
the prime minister's statements. Rates reached around 30 
percent, and the Bank of Portugal spent almost 200 million 
contos [1 conto:1,000 escudos] in order to calm nerves. 
  [Catroga] The Bank of Portugal has considerable reserves -- 
it has reserves totaling $20 billion -- and Portugal is one of 
the countries in the world with the best external liquidity 
positions (it is one of the countries with the highest cover 
ratios for import months [coeficiente de cobertura dos meses de 
importacao]), and so this does not worry the central bank or the 
government. 
  If it is rational -- and in the medium term markets are 
rational and pay attention to "fundamentals" -- the market will 
have to pay attention to a sign of which I have just learned 
from REUTERS -- the good results of the implementation of the 
budget in the first quarter. This was a good sign! Another 
good sign is the effective wage restraint, which is occurring in 
this country as it has not occurred for many years, not only in 
the public sector but also in the private sector. 
  [EXPRESSO] In any event, the agitation on the market has a 
great deal to do with exchange rate policy and with some 
people's gambling on a possible devaluation of the escudo. 
  [Catroga] The central bank can reduce its real benchmark 
rates and without prejudice to the aims of exchange rate 
stability. The macroeconomists are in the habit of saying that 
an exchange rate of balance is one that maintains an appropriate 
exchange rate that maintains equilibrium in the balance of 
payments in the long term. 
  And my conclusion is that in fact the current exchange rate, 
following the adjustment which occurred last year, is a correct 
exchange rate, because -- employers assure me when I speak with 
them -- it has ceased to be cited by the real economy as a 
factor that affects Portuguese enterprises' competitiveness. 
  [EXPRESSO] "Has ceased to be" because the escudo used to be 
too strong? 
  [Catroga] What I say is that the exchange rate is no longer 
a factor affecting the competitiveness of the Portuguese economy 
and Portuguese enterprises. It is clear, as the prime minister 
has already stated, that exchange rate stability, contrary to 
what many fundamentalists also believe, does not mean exchange 
rate immutability. 
  [EXPRESSO] Does rejecting "exchange rate immutability" mean 
having a flexible escudo instead of a strong escudo or a weak 
escudo? 
  [Catroga] No. We must have an appropriate exchange rate, 
and today's exchange rate is appropriate to the competitiveness 
of the Portuguese economy and enterprises. 
  [EXPRESSO] Which means that it used not to be.... 
  [Catroga] Hmmmm.... I have not conducted a historical 
analysis. 
<H5>  Europe </H5>
  [EXPRESSO] Portugal came closer to the Community average 
between 1986 and 1990 than between 1986 and 1992. That is, the 
fall in the period of recession was clearly noted, and it 
converged less than Spain between 1986 and 1992, but convergence 
now has a goal called Economic and Monetary Union (EMU). 
  [Catroga] Portugal is committed to building EMU. We 
ratified the treaty on European union and believe that this 
project, which is a gradualist project, is important for 
galvanizing competitiveness in the European economy, but we also 
believe that EMU is not in itself a factor promoting European 
economic recovery on a sustained basis. 
  As regards real convergence, Portugal has achieved 
significant progress. As compared with Spain, with respect to 
convergence, we were better in 1993 than in 1991, and we are 
much better than as compared with Greece; Greece has widened the 
gap. 
  Between 1986 and 1992, our GDP rose from 52 percent of the 
European average to 60.7 percent. Moreover, the Community aid 
plan [Quadro Comunitario de Apoio] must be viewed in its true 
significance, within the framework of a Union's regional 
development policy, and it must also be explained that there are 
other, richer countries than Portugal, such as the Netherlands 
or Denmark, which receive higher per capita Community aid. In 
any event, the second Community aid plan will make possible, 
like the first, the reduction of regional inequalities. The 
Portuguese Government's medium term aim is to grow again at an 
average rate exceeding the Community average by 1 percent. 
  [EXPRESSO] Starting from when? 
  [Catroga] Starting from now, from the new Community aid 
plan, which starts in 1994 and will have greater impact from the 
second half of 1994. According to a European Commission 
estimate, the effect of this factor alone points to a growth of 
the Portuguese economy exceeding the Community average by 0.5 
percent. 
  [EXPRESSO] According to the Commission, the Twelve's growth 
forecast is 1.3 percent in 1994 and 2.1 percent in 1995. Will 
Portugal exceed this growth rate by that 0.5 percent margin? 
  [Catroga] I believe so, in the medium term.... 
  [EXPRESSO] In 1994 or 1995? 
  [Catroga] I believe that we will exceed the Community 
average in 1995. 
  [EXPRESSO] But not in 1994? 
  [Catroga] In 1994, much depends on the European economy's 
performance. 
  [EXPRESSO] Let us talk about the convergence criteria for 
EMU. 
  [Catroga] As [European Commission Vice President] Leon 
Brittan stated in an interview published last weekend, I believe 
that these conclusions on the criteria are not yet properly 
founded in terms of a reassessment or otherwise. The criteria 
exist, we must be pragmatic, and they are the benchmarks for the 
economic policy targets. I must say that, as benchmarks, I do 
not believe that the main guidelines of economic policy would be 
substantially different with or without these convergence 
criteria. In my opinion, what is essential is the consolidation 
of a favorable trend with respect to all of them. 
  [EXPRESSO] But in the case of the public debt, Portugal's 
trend has been clearly unfavorable. For a set target of 71 
percent for this year, we already reached 70.2 percent in 
January, and February brought the 750 million [currency 
unspecified] foreign loan "bill...." 
  [Catroga] Let us examine each of the convergence criteria. 
With respect to the trend in the inflation rate, I believe that 
we are on the right path. With respect to the public deficit 
criterion, the Portuguese economy has already shown through the 
trend from 1986 to 1992 (the public deficit, in terms of GDP, 
was just 3.3 percent of GDP in 1992, whereas in 1985-86 it was 
around 10 percent) that it is possible to have success in the 
process of budgetary consolidation. So 1993 must be viewed only 
as a point of discontinuity, and as I have already said, the 
strategy of budgetary consolidation is a settled policy of the 
government and the Finance Ministry, and we will resume the path 
of that sound course for public finances in 1994. 
  In 1993, according to the latest figures at my disposal, 
Portugal stood at 7.1 percent. The provisional figure for Spain 
is 7.3 percent, but the latest figures at my disposal suggest a 
higher figure, after the inclusion of the so-called regional 
deficits. Italy is close to 10 percent, the United Kingdom 
stands at 8.7 percent, Greece at 17.5 percent, and Belgium at 
7.2 percent. France stands at 5.5 percent. The figure I have 
for Germany is 4.2 percent, except that, according to what 
Helmut Schlesinger stated in Lisbon, it will rise to 7 percent 
if we take into account the deficit of the Treuhand -- the state 
agency overseeing the privatization measures in the former GDR. 
  [EXPRESSO] There remains the public debt.... 
  [Catroga] At the end of 1993, we had a ratio of 66.4 percent 
with respect to GDP. 
  [EXPRESSO] At the end of January, it had risen by nearly 4 
percent. Is the trend not the main thing? 
  [Catroga] Certainly, but we are also going to reduce it, 
and we are close to the target, which is 60 percent. 
  [EXPRESSO] Except that we have already been in the area of 
64 percent.... 
  [Catroga] Yes, but the indicator worsened in all the 
countries. Look, in Italy it went from 108 percent to 118 
percent; in Germany it went from 44 percent to 49 percent, in 
France from 39 percent to 44 percent, in the Netherlands from 79 
percent to 81 percent, in Belgium from 121 percent to 128 
percent, and in Denmark from 68 percent to 80 percent. 
  With respect to the fourth criterion -- long-term interest 
rates -- we are virtually there. Right now, the criterion is 
7.6 percent, and we are already below 9 percent. 
  [EXPRESSO] With all this, will the third stage of EMU really 
be in 1997? 
  [Catroga] The view now shared within the Union is that the 
third stage will perhaps be not in 1997 but somewhere between 
1997 and 1999. [passage omitted]

  [Text] The UN secretary general, who left Madrid barely 
half an hour ago, has expressed his optimism about finding a 
solution in order to stop the fighting in Gorazde. Hector 
Arenas was able to speak to him just before he boarded his 
aircraft. Good afternoon. 
  [Arenas] Good afternoon. As he was boarding the aircraft, 
which is now taking him back to New York, UN Secretary General 
Butrus-Ghali agreed to the request from Radio 1 of Radio 
Nacional de Espana to make a statement about the situation in 
former Yugoslavia and Gorazde. Before that, the UN secretary 
general expressed his gratitude to the Spanish people and 
government for the warm welcome that, he said, they had given 
him during his visit to Madrid and Barcelona, highlighting 
Spain's participation, with over 1,000 soldiers, in peace 
operations. 
  Regarding the situation in Bosnia, Butrus-Ghali said that in 
the last few hours he has talked with Yasushi Akashi, his 
representative in Yugoslavia, and with NATO Secretary General 
Manfred Woerner, with whom he discussed, he said, what possible 
measures could be taken to bring peace to that region. 
  The UN secretary general said that when he arrives in New 
York he will hold further consultations with his advisers, 
although I can tell you, he said, that, given that I am by 
definition an optimist, I believe that we will be able to find 
peaceful solutions in this dramatic case. 
  Concerning the situation in Rwanda, Butrus-Ghali said that 
he 
had been in touch by telephone with the UN commander in the 
region who told him that the situation remains confused.

  [Text] Helsinki, April 18 (AFP) -- Finland will join NATO's 
Partnership for Peace [PFP] Programme aimed at improving 
military cooperation with the former Soviet bloc, the Finnish 
president said Monday [18 April]. 
  President Martti Ahtisaari's statement came after the 
governmental committee on foreign affairs recommended that 
neutral Finland should be associated with the North Atlantic 
Treaty Organisation programme. 
  Finland will, however, restrict its participation to 
peacekeeping operations, search, rescue and humanitarian 
functions and environmental protection. 
  A government statement stressed Monday that Finland was not 
seeking any new defence solutions by way of the NATO Partnership 
for Peace. 
  The government has not decided when the documents will be 
signed, but foreign ministry sources said that Foreign Minister 
Heikki Haavisto is likely to sign the programme in Brussels 
early next month.

<F P=106> [Article by Goran Ek: "South Coast To Become Important Trade </F>
Area"] 
  [Text] The coastal belt along the eastern Gulf of Finland 
will, according to a just-released development program, be 
developed into a strong economic center, which at the same time 
will be a hub for traffic especially with the St. Petersburg 
area. 
  The development plan covers some 10 subprojects concerning 
traffic, environment, and trade with areas to the east. 
Sponsoring the program and the coastal project regarding the 
Gulf of Finland are such private groups as the regional 
associations of the Kymi River Valley, eastern Uusimaa, and 
Uusimaa, as well as the individual municipalities along the 
coast. 
  Among other things, it is proposed that Europe Highway Route 
18 [E18] be improved, and that the train between Helsinki and 
St. Petersburg be able to transit the stretch in two and a half 
hours. The sponsoring groups also want to improve know-how on 
trade with Russia and Russian business culture, as well as to 
increase teaching of the Russian language at all levels of 
education. 
  "The coastal project has been under way for two years, and 
the purpose has been to introduce cooperation in order to 
develop business, improve the environment, and promote regional 
culture in the area." This was said by Tapio Valinoro, director 
of a landscape company and chairman of the Kymi River Valley 
Development Association. 
  A basket with 60 concrete development projects are included 
in the development project for the Gulf of Finland. From these 
60, the involved parties -- the state, municipalities, 
businesses, and private associations -- can select which 
individual projects concern them, and can in conjunction with 
others move them forward. Those elements considered of overall 
strategic importance are: improvement of land communications -- 
E18 and the rail route; developing environmental technology; 
improvement of knowledge regarding Russia; betterment of safety; 
and establishing planning cooperation over the border. 
<H5>  Transit Traffic for 6-7 Billion Markkas </H5>
  The better the communications to St. Petersburg, the more 
attractive will be the coastal region to those businesses 
wanting to establish themselves in the Russian market, reason 
the drafters. 
  The coastal zone in southeast Finland is the most rapid and 
secure transportation route from the United States (via 
Rotterdam and Amsterdam) and West Europe to Russia and the other 
countries of the former Soviet Union. 
  "This now involves a market of perhaps 2 billion markkas per 
year, but if the entire transportation chain is taken into 
account, this is estimated to be at least from 6-7 billion 
markkas," says Valinoro. 
  E18 should be [re]built as a four-lane highway or 
expressway. 
The most difficult bottlenecks are found on the Russian side of 
the border and in Vyborg. The railroads are going to be even 
more a key factor in the Russian transportation system, and rail 
will therefore be the only realistic alternative when large 
volumes of cargo are to be transported for long distances. 
<H5>  Time Works in Favor of Helibannan [new Helsinki-St. </H5>
Petersburg Rail Route] 
  "Considering all this, it is clear that time is working in 
favor of a future Helibannan," Valinoro claims. 
  The present rail route to Russia should be improved so that 
the Pendolino train can transit the Helsinki-St. Petersburg 
stretch in four and a half hours. 
  With this is would be possible to make one-day round trips 
between the two cities, either for purposes of business or 
shopping. In the long term a new, more direct rail line to the 
east is going to prove necessary, and then the travel time can 
be reduced -- in the best case -- to two and a half hours. 
  Development of environmental technology relates to the key 
industrial areas along the Gulf of Finland's coastal belt. 
  The adjacent areas within the CIS and the Baltic countries 
are to constitute the most important markets for Finnish 
environment companies. An action program must now be drafted 
which will make it possible for Finnish companies to participate 
in environment projects requiring international financing 
arrangements in the former Soviet area. Such a program should 
cover needs in Russia and, at the same time, involve 
international financing and Finnish know-how. 
  In comparison with many other areas, especially Tallinn and 
Riga, which are in competition for the role of entry ports to 
Russia and the East, the Finnish areas along the Gulf of Finland 
have an important weak point: our knowledge of the Russian 
language, and our familiarity with Russian mores and practices 
and the Russian culture are poor. 
<H5>  Head Start of Five to 10 Years </H5>
  At the same time, we have a time jump of perhaps 10-15 years 
in comparison to Finland. 
  This should be exploited as soon as possible, according to 
Valinoro. 
  "The opportunities for studying Russian should be expanded 
at 
all educational levels. To awaken a greater interest in Russian 
new teaching materials should be developed which reflect the 
new, dynamic economy and culture now going on, instead of the 
bygone Soviet era and its linguistic usages. 
  ``It is also important to activate cooperation in education 
and research, and to create new programs for practicum 
exchanges, as well as exchange programs in culture and sports.'' 
  The border between Finland and Russia is perhaps the world's 
deepest living-standards gap. This creates tension and strong 
undercurrents. To master them is a difficult job which will 
likewise yield profit if handled well. The situation in Russia 
is instable and its future prospects partly concealed in 
darkness. This creates insecurity and risks, but also 
opportunities for progress for capable business people. A 
careful but, at the same time, flexible border regime is under 
these circumstances a necessary precondition for crossborder 
economic cooperation, as well as cooperation in general, to run 
safely and smoothly.

<F P=106> [Editorial: "Youth Must Be Gotten Off Welfare and Into Job </F>
Training and Education"] 
  [Text] When young people are being threatened with becoming 
long-term unemployed before entering a career -- or even before 
their first job -- it is not exaggerated to speak of an 
emergency situation. The alternative is to implement newly 
conceived measures for combatting unemployment. Finland cannot 
afford to let thousands of 15- to 24-year-olds get used to 
scraping a living from the welfare system while doing this and 
that to keep busy. 
  Although 80,000 young people were moved into training 
programs between last August and January of this year, the 
number of their unemployed companions remained at 89,000, and 
the percentage of youth unemployment rose to 40. This is a 
horrendous figure that decisionmakers can no longer ignore. 
  Since the majority of young people are still interested in 
finding a job or getting training, it is worthwhile to make 
sacrifices to provide them the systems for obtaining these. A 
few years from now it will otherwise be necessary to provide 
rehabilitation and expensive therapies to create new self-esteem 
and energy among those once displaced. The official view of a 
growing demand for labor around the turn of the century is of no 
assurance unless we can maintain the work abilities of youth. 
  A report prepared by the Prime Minister's Office entitled 
"Alternative to Unemployment" offers the government and 
parliament numerous measures to tackle this serious problem, if 
the will is there. Jobs, training slots, apprenticeships, or 
practicum places could be arranged for young people, but these 
programs will all need money. 
  This first report, which contained a range of possible 
measures, which was submitted in December, was rejected as being 
too expensive, and those in the prime minister's chancellory 
were told to make their proposals more specifically targeted. 
The cost of the new three-year program they came up with trims 
outlays from 8 to 4 billion [markkas], meaning a cut in training 
and job slots by nearly half. Will these cuts be sufficient, or 
will the package keep shrinking in new versions, as in the 
proverbial snows of last winter? 
  The proposal of report drafters to increase the training 
slots to over 30,000 is economically sound and reasonable. Since 
employers would like to take on more trainees than their budgets 
permit, and since job training interests youth lacking 
vocational education, investing in this promises to be an 
excellent use of funds. 
  There seems to be no better way to combat unemployment than 
training. Training stimulates even better than public works. It 
is labor-intensive and increases the market for many types of 
products. Ever more complicated skills are demanded from 
workers, and especially the ability to train in new ways. A 
well-trained worker handles his job better than others and also 
is better able to keep his job. 
  A work force with augmenting knowledge and skills is the 
best 
way to assure product quality and competitiveness. Society would 
not want to see those having received its dearly paid resources 
go back on the welfare roles. Even short employment periods can 
maintain skills and be used to learn new ones, so that the 
report's proposed 50,000 markkas for each job is more than 
justified. If nothing is ventured, then neither can anything be 
gained.

  [Text] Oslo, April 15 (AFP) -- Norway is considering 
sending a 400-man logistical battalion to Tuzla in response to a 
formal request from the United Nations, the Foreign Ministry 
said here Friday [15 April]. 
  Norway already has a field hospital and helicopter wing 
stationed in Tuzla as part of the joint Nordic force in the 
region. 
  The Norwegian parliament must formally decide the matter, 
although no date has been set yet. But it will take at least 
several months before the troops are on site, a Defense Ministry 
official said. 
  "We hope that the force can be assembled as quickly as 
possible. Beyond that, it is impossible to provide a timeframe 
for when the force will be on site," Norwegian Deputy Defense 
Minister Sigve Brekke said. 
  The Defense Department does not consider it a major risk to 
send new forces to Tuzla. 
  "There is no immediate danger to the safety of the Norwegian 
contingent. That the Serbs are harassing the UN personnel 
cannot prevent us from taking responsibility through 
participation," Defense Minister Joergen Kosmo said. 
  "Unless something unexpected happens, the Norwegians are 
pretty safe," Kosmo added. 
  Norway also intends to reduce the size of its peacekeeping 
contigent in Macedonia [The Former Yugoslav Republic of 
Macedonia], where U.S. forces will be taking over, Defense 
Ministry spokesman Chris Tredesen said. 
  There are currently 227 Norwegian soldiers in Macedonia as 
part of the joint Nordic battalion.

<F P=106> [Report on interview with Prime Minister Gro Harlem </F>
Brundtland by Bente Egjar Engesland in the prime minister's 
office; date not given: "The Mighty Gro"] 
  [Text] She is in the midst of the political fight of 
her life. Will Gro Harlem Brundtland achieve what has until now 
been almost unthinkable? Is it at all possible that stubborn 
Norway will vote yes on membership in the European Union [EU]? 
"Sure it's possible," says the mighty Gro. 
  With the EU's internal crisis as background noise, she is 
going to travel around the country to get skeptical people to 
vote yes -- just as the negotiators in Brussels did and just as 
she herself did in 1972. 
  Then Gro Harlem Brundtland was no activist during the "civil 
war" and she only publicly announced her 1972 position for the 
first time in 1990. 
  But it is not typically Norwegian to be Gro and it is not 
typical of Gro the practitioner of realpolitik to be a doubter. 
She has an almost frightening iron will, resoluteness, and 
energetic power. 
  The prime minister's large meeting room is opened for us, a 
room free of intimate atmosphere: There are 12 empty chairs 
around the big conference table. There is a watchful press 
spokesman carrying a cassette tape recorder -- which is 
frequently used ever since reporter Geelmuyden's statement that 
the prime minister merely chatters. Perhaps the press spokesman 
can do the interview as well, so we can take in the view 
instead. We have windows looking out onto the rooftop terrace, 
where all the world's guests are photographed with "madame," the 
woman in the brightly colored clothes. Red is the fiery woman's 
color. Gro loves red. 
  She makes her entrance and kicks off the black, high-heeled 
patent leather shoes; we have more than half an hour, a whole 
eternity. 
  Norway is now seriously being devastated by an EU struggle. 
But for Gro Harlem Brundtland, this is not the beginning, just 
the beginning of the end, because the Europe process has already 
been a marathon. First there was the European Economic Area 
[EEA] concept that we never became familiar with. The EEA 
process alone took five and a half years. 
  "It's hugely demanding to work with such processes. It 
requires long-range thinking," she says. 
  Many people have completely forgotten that the EEA was also 
about to fall through. But when we ask Gro about The Big 
Disappointment, she cannot avoid the EEA breakdown in Luxembourg 
in the summer of 1991. That led to a major defeat for Gro, the 
Labor Party, and the European project. 
  "Luxembourg's foreign minister, Jacques Poos, interpreted 
the 
situation in such a positive way that we thought an agreement 
about free market access for fish was in place. Here at home we 
were scolded. Political opponents exploited the situation for 
all it was worth. We learned that you can't take such statements 
for granted. You have to get up early in the morning." 
  Hard work, more hard work, and yet more hard work is her 
political recipe -- and her dogma. For Gro, stamina has an 
intrinsic value in politics and in life. Like so many Social 
Democrats, Gro was born into politics. She has rarely asked the 
question whether the choice was the right one because 
the choice was obvious. It is just as obvious to work 
systematically to achieve political goals. 
  But the systematic thinker also takes chances. She sent 
avowed opponents to Brussels to negotiate a Norwegian yes vote. 
From the 15th floor in the Government Building, she kept in 
contact by telephone with negotiators Gunhild Oyangen, Grete 
Kundsen, Jan Henry T. Olsen, and special advisor with special 
status Jonas Gahr Store. But they were able to fend for 
themselves. 
  "I consciously kept in the background." 
  "No fish" Olsen was a particularly big gamble. But Gro fell 
for him four years ago when he delivered a "dazzling speech to 
the Fishermen's Association." In any event, if Norway does not 
become a member of the EU, it will not be Olsen's fault. He 
behaved like a duck in water. 
  Little, if anything, in Gro Harlem Brundtland's Europe 
mission is accidental. With Thorbjorn Jagland as the central 
strategist, every step is carefully planned, from the EEA 
process to the Labor Party's big consultation and the prime 
minister's promembership speech in the fruit-producing town of 
Ullensvang on 4 April 1992 in which she said that Norway could 
still give up a fish. 
  At the eleventh hour Gro could also phone her political 
friend of many years' standing, Spain's Prime Minister Felipe 
Gonzalez. 
  "Personal contacts are important to build up confidence. If 
people you know from before know you can be depended upon, you 
can pick up a phone and in three minutes get down to brass 
tacks. I have known Felipe Gonzalez since 1975, before Spain 
became democratic and he was in exile. We established an 
ideological companionship that means today we are colleagues. 
  ``But there are limits to how much personal relationships 
can 
exert an influence. Fisheries policy is an important and 
difficult national issue for Spain, just as it is for Norway. 
Neither one of us wants to destroy the respect we have at home. 
Job number one is to take care of national interests. But when 
we know one another well, it's also possible to proceed without 
ceremonial phrases. I said that we couldn't do anything more 
than stretch out the EEA fish. So Gonzalez knew that that was 
the reality.'' 
  When Jacques Delors was told that the Norwegian negotiators 
had the backing of the prime minister, he too knew that this was 
true. Just as now Gro Harlem Brundtland can use her network of 
international contacts that has been built up since 1974, when 
Norway's youngest, freshest cabinet minister was given the task 
of running an OECD conference on the environment. 
  "I remember thinking we couldn't let this possibility slip 
away from us, and that I had to prepare myself well. That was 
also how I immediately got an international challenge. At that 
time as well transnational and interdisciplinary contacts were 
important. First I approached the Spanish environment minister 
and went systematically to work." 
  [Engesland] I can believe it. Have you never been 
particularly troubled by nerves? 
  [Brundtland] I don't get nervous, but it's not out of 
arrogance or a lack of respect for my tasks. I don't want to be 
paralyzed by nerves. My recipe is to prepare myself as best I 
can. 
  Indeed unprepared situations can throw her off balance and 
unleash that famous red-hot temper. As at an improvised news 
conference in Arhus, when the prime minister thought she was 
supposed to speak about Nordic cooperation while the reporters 
were only concerned about the book dealing with intelligence, 
Vi som styrer Norge [We Who Run Norway]. 
Then Gro flew into a raging protest. 
  The hard-as-nails Gro-Kare duels taught her to control her 
temper, but she can still be a fury and cut off an opponent with 
razor-sharp retorts or silence them completely. This is the 
language of power, even if Gro would deny that herself. 
  [Engesland] What do you think about Anne Enger Lahnstein's 
role in the EU debate? 
  [Brundtland] I'm thinking of the country's future. 
  That is all the "yes queen" has to say about the "no queen." 
  [Engesland] What role do you want to play yourself? 
  [Brundtland] I am the prime minister. 
  No one can deny that, she laughs cleverly. As prime 
minister, 
Gro must be be somewhat cautious about being too strong an 
exponent, but all the same, is it tempting to let everything go 
now? 
  [Engesland] You have stayed in the background during the 
last 
round of the negotiations. But will the Labor Party, Thorbjorn 
Jagland, and Gro Harlem Brundtland now roll across the country? 
  [Brundtland] No, we'll take it at a quiet pace. This is not 
an issue for one or two people. In this instance there are many 
of us. 
  All the same: Gro is at the top now and strongly convinced 
of 
her own ability to persuade. She is Norway's most powerful 
woman, she is the most dominant political leader since Einar 
Gerhardsen. Will she be able to do what Trygve Bratteli could 
not? Or will the power elite once again stab her in the back? 
  Finally Gro says that a no vote from a majority of the 
people 
will not be a personal, only a political defeat, and that she 
will not resign. But the fight over the EU has also divided the 
Social Democrats, and god only knows how an internal struggle 
has torn the Labor Party to pieces before, in 1972 and during 
the struggle for power in 1979-81 -- that pushed out Reiulf 
Steen and brought Gro in. In her time the Social Democratic 
movement has been threatened by an identity crisis and 
ideological disintegration, by tension between the state and the 
market, and between the national political leadership and 
ungovernable international forces. Gerhardsen the younger came 
back from oblivion, he talked about the good, old values and 
went into the television studio with Socialist Left Party [SV] 
leader Erik Solheim. In 1982 Rune Gerhardsen was her personal 
secretary, but he could not keep up with Gro's pace very long. 
Ten years later he was the opposition incarnate. 
  The Labor Party was down low in the opinion polls. But it 
was 
a personal tragedy that led to the dramatic retirement in 1992 
-- not any uproar on the outside. 
  Gro Harlem Brundtland bears a great sorrow. She lost a son, 
and for a mother there is nothing worse. A prime minister can 
trust few people, and now she protects herself more than ever. 
So the individual with feelings within her is increasingly 
thrown into the solitude that follows the life of a top leader. 
  Time with her family and outdoor activities are essential. 
She is now going to the mountain where she will spend her Easter 
vacation to relax with her family. 
  [Engesland] What will you read over the Easter holiday -- 
more EU documents? 
  [Brundtland] I'm going to read Jostein Gaarder's 
philosophical novel Sofies verden [Sophie's 
World]! 
  [Engesland] So might you reflect on which classical 
philosophers fascinate you the most? In Steinar Hansson and 
Ingolf Hakon Teigenes's book Maktkamp og mannefall 
[The Struggle for Power and the Slaughter], it is 
implied that there is a less than flattering connection between 
you and Plato. You have frequently said that there is a close 
connection between the doctor and the politician. The doctor 
prevents disease and heals suffering whereas the politician 
prevents social problems and corrects biases. Plato also 
believed that statesmen should take responsibility for society 
the way the doctor does for the patient. Aren't you in danger of 
becoming elitist? 
  [Brundtland] No, be reasonable. What nonsense! she snorts. 
  I haven't read Plato from A to Z, but in any event what is 
not possible in a democracy is not having leaders. Power cannot 
be decentralized as long as no one makes decisions. It's also 
quite wrong to give the impression that some politicians here at 
home represent the people and that others do not. If any party 
is close to people's everyday lives, it is the Labor Party. 
  It is right to observe that the choice of a career tells a 
lot about someone's personal leanings. I became a doctor because 
I liked to be with people, I liked to do things, to help. I also 
think that I have always had the ability to make contact with 
people. 
  Prime Minister Gro Harlem Brundtland is a remarkable blend 
of 
toughness and tenderness, of uncompromising resolution and 
generous care. She does, however, direct little irony towards 
herself. Nor will she ever become a big popular orator. The 
torrent of speech wears at the wits of every reporter with a 
feeling for proper quotations. But political journalists are 
nonetheless seen more frequently as "Gro's court" than as a 
counterweight to her. 
  Because no one can challenge Gro's or the Labor Party's 
position in the government because the opposition in the 
Storting is so divided and weak, because there are so few 
experienced leaders on an international scale in our little 
country, and, because she reigns so sovereign, she is also 
becoming next to impregnable. 
  Today Gro is no longer called the chatterbox from Bygdoy, 
nor 
is she called the "Green Goddess," but everyone is still on a 
first-name basis with her and she increasingly behaves like the 
country's grandmother -- commanding and compliant. 
  The battle over Norway and Europe will be a historic one. 
The 
big question is whether the leadership of the Labor Party will 
make close contact with the sentiments in the hearts of the 
people. Gro is pleased to be traveling northward. But will the 
skeptical people in northern Norway vote yes just because 
grandmother says they ought to?

<F P=106> [Geir Salvesen report: "Promises To Resurrect the </F>
Conservative Party"] 
  [Excerpt] Bergen -- "The Conservative Party will be 
restored to its old heights," new party leader Jan Petersen 
promised. Optimism is growing. 
  Spring sunshine finally flooded over the rain-drenched 
mountains after a national conference that was the very lift 
that experienced party officials had been hoping for. A brand 
new leadership had been elected with Borge Brende and Elisabeth 
Aspaker as new deputy chairmen. The new party leader had 
successfully negotiated his closing speech and the tricky 
questions at the news conference, and many people felt that they 
had been given "brass band music in their hearts," as former 
party leader Jan P. Syse put it earlier in the conference. 
  Petersen also gave clear marching orders on the EU [European 
Union] question: "There will be no membership unless the 
Conservative Party is involved and does its share of the job! 
If there are people in the Labor Party who believe that the EU 
race is theirs alone, they are wrong," he said. His feeling is 
that opposition within the party to the EU -- with only 2 
percent no against 98 percent yes -- is not too large or so 
forcibly expressed that the party cannot live with it. 
  Jan Petersen, who was elected with acclamation and without 
any rival candidate yesterday morning, said that one of his main 
tasks -- alongside the EU question -- will be to bring the 
Conservative Party back to the position of the dominant 
challenger to the Labor Party. 
  "The situation of being the Storting's third largest party 
is 
a situation with which we feel most uncomfortable," he said. 
The new Conservative leader wants to bring out the differences 
between the Labor Party and the Conservative Party more clearly 
and thinks that he has a stockpile of enough issues that can 
show that the two parties are still as different as they were 
perceived to be in the past. Both he and others in the party 
have a great deal of patience when it comes to the length of 
time it will take to resurrect the party from support of around 
17 percent. "Now we must forget the opinion poll figures for a 
couple of years." 
  Petersen also tried to look at the everyday lives of people 
from a viewpoint outside the Storting. 
  "Let us never forget that there is another Norway beyond the 
political Norway. A Norway where the main question is whether 
it will be possible to keep one's job into next year. Where the 
worry is not the budget deficit, but whether it is safe to walk 
home from the bus stop." 
  The question of who actually is the leader of the new 
Conservative Party has been raised by many, given that Anders 
Talleraas will continue to be parliamentary leader and Kaci 
Kullmann Five is still expected to be a frontline figure on the 
EU question. The same questions surfaced at the closing news 
conference yesterday, and Petersen's replies chiefly had the 
thrust that this will not be a problem: 
  "Come back in six months and you will see that this has not 
been a problem," Petersen said. He said that in the final 
analysis he will be the one who has to be in the frontline on 
all important questions, but that he needs all the good forces 
that can assist him in his job. He was unwilling to say whether 
or not Anders Talleraas should be reelected parliamentary leader 
and added that this was something for the Storting group to 
decide. [passage omitted]

<F P=106> [Ole Mathismoen report: "Norway Cannot Give Much Help to </F>
the Kola Peninsula"] 
  [Text] Russia cannot afford nuclear safety in the northern 
regions. And Norway cannot afford to give very much help. 
  This was Foreign Minister Bjorn Tore Godal's conclusion 
yesterday when he put before the Storting a report on nuclear 
safety and chemical weapons in the regions close to northern 
Norway. 
  The Cold War has been succeeded by major environmental 
challenges. In areas very close to Norway there are enormous 
temporary dumps of nuclear waste, several dozen abandoned 
nuclear submarines, an old and unsafe nuclear power station, and 
large quantities of nuclear arms. 
  "It goes without saying that Russia has an independent 
responsibility for safety at nuclear installations and for 
solving the problems of waste. But neither Russia nor the other 
states of East Europe are able to give this the highest 
priority. Such enormous resources are needed to sort all this 
out that the only possibility is broad international 
cooperation," the foreign minister said. He mentioned NATO, the 
EU [European Union], the European Bank for Reconstruction and 
Development, and the North Atlantic Cooperation Council as 
possible forums for such cooperation. 
  The foreign minister stressed strongly that Norway can only 
be involved in a small way in paying the bill for the biggest 
nuclear cleanup operation ever. Hitherto Norway has spent only 
36 million kroner in aid for the East. In the past it has been 
estimated that it will cost somewhere around $150 billion to 
clean up the nuclear chaos on the Kola Peninsula. 
  "But Norway is assuming a lobbying role to get nuclear 
safety 
in northwestern Russia onto the international agenda," Godal 
said. But who will actually pay the bill, he was asked. "Russia 
and Europe's taxpayers will have to foot the bill," he said. 
  Asked whether Norway has plans for further short-term 
assistance for the Kola region in the absence of a larger-scale 
international aid operation, he replied: "We are keeping the 
situation under constant observation, but we have no plans for 
measures at present. These are sensitive issues on which we 
naturally want to work closely with the Russian authorities." 
  In the course of last winter there were several minor 
accidents at the nuclear power station on the Kola Peninsula, 
further nuclear submarines were mothballed, and the situation 
regarding several of the temporary waste dumps -- such as the 
dump ship Lepse, for example -- deteriorated dramatically. In 
the light of this the foreign minister was asked if Finnmark is 
today facing a real nuclear threat: 
  "The potential dangers are considerable. But the situation 
is not acute," Bjorn Tore Godal said. 
  Yesterday the foreign minister was able to announce that the 
Russian authorities with the foreign minister at their head have 
given permission for a third Norwegian-Russian research 
expedition to former nuclear waste dumping sites in the Kara 
Sea. Now the way is clear for an expedition to the formerly 
forbidden Ambrosimov Bay on Novaya Zemlya where there is reason 
to believe that considerable quantities of solid nuclear waste 
has been dumped. 
  The foreign minister's report to the Storting is the first 
public document on nuclear safety in the Kola region. Hitherto 
it has been the Bellona Environmental Foundation which, since 
the fall of the Iron Curtain, has constantly been digging up new 
information about the piles of radioactive waste the Cold War is 
leaving behind in the northern regions.

  [Text] All refugees from Bosnia who are fit to carry arms 
and who are staying in Sweden should travel home and take part 
in the defense of the country, says the Tuzla Mayor Selim 
(?Bezladcic), who is currently visiting Goteborg. According to 
the mayor, within one month the refugees will receive a summons 
to travel home, and that summons will come from the Bosnian 
Government. If they do not heed the call, they may encounter 
problems when they want to return to Bosnia. New passports may 
then be denied them, says the Tuzla mayor, currently visiting 
Goteborg.

  [Text] Support for the European Union [EU] is continuing to 
fall in Sweden. According to an opinion poll published in 
GOTEBORGS-POSTEN, supporters of the EU now number 33 percent 
while opponents number 42 percent. The poll also reveals that 
over half of Sweden's Social Democrats are against the EU. This 
is a problem for the party leadership that is in favor of the EU 
and is seeking to gain governmental powers in the Swedish 
elections in September.

<F P=106> [Article by Mikael Holmstrom: "Loopholes in Export Control </F>
Eliminated"] 
  [Excerpt] The government will today decide to propose 
export controls for advanced Swedish civilian technology. 
  For 45 years such state control of Swedish strategic goods 
was contrary to the neutrality policy, but is now being 
implemented as an adjustment to an altered surrounding world. 
  A bill with a legislative proposal lies ready on the 
government's table for adoption Thursday [24 March]. The new law 
is called the Law on Strategic Products. 
<H5>  Last Loophole Eliminated </H5>
  With that, the last loophole in Swedish export control is 
being eliminated. 
  Previously, it has not been possible to halt export of 
Swedish-manufactured civilian technology that can also be used 
for military purposes, such as data systems or ships, by legal 
means. 
  In the new law export of this so-called dual use, Swedish 
technology is being added to the existing legislation for 
missile and rocket technology, substances for biological and 
chemical weapons, nuclear technology, and advanced technology 
controlled abroad. 
<H5>  Strategic Goods </H5>
  This is being done by expanding the existing Law on 
Prohibition of Export of Products Usable for Purposes of Mass 
Destruction to become a universal law for strategic goods. 
  The high-technology ordinance, which the Palme government 
introduced in 1986 after several incidences of smuggling and 
pressure from the United States, will thus be superseded and 
abolished; it only covers foreign advanced technology. 
  It is proposed that the War Materials Inspectorate should be 
given greater resources and comprehensive responsibility for 
control and export licenses based on the new law. 
  Henceforth the Customs Office, which today issues certain 
export permits, will only devote itself to control. If the 
number of cases becomes too large for the War Materials 
Inspectorate, in a later phase they could be given over to the 
Board of Commerce. 
  With this bill Sweden will acquire the same export controls 
as the NATO countries, which since 1949 have cooperated on a 
technology embargo against the East bloc. This has taken place 
under the leadership of the United States in Cocom [Coordinating 
Committee for Multilateral Export Controls], a child of the Cold 
War, which began its activity in deepest secrecy in Paris in 
1949. 
<H5>  Top Secret </H5>
  An informal and top-secret Swedish cooperation was in 
existence between 1950 and 1967 and after the mid-1980's. Not 
until 1992 did Sweden officially establish contacts with Cocom, 
at the same time as the countries in the former East bloc.

  [Text] President Glavkos Kliridhis has said that the UN 
Security Council does not have the political will to promote 
alternative ways to solve the Cyprus problem, although in its 
resolutions it has stressed the need to use such ways if no 
progress is made. President Kliridhis said that there is a lack 
of will from the Turkish side as well. The president added that 
the presentation of the Cyprus issue to the plenary session of 
the Council of Europe's parliamentary assembly and during his 
private contacts has shown that greater emphasis should be given 
to the demilitarization of Cyprus and the promotion of its 
membership in the European Union. 
  President Kliridhis was speaking this afternoon on his 
return 
from London, where he went after visiting Strasbourg. 
  President Kliridhis also said that Robert Lamb, the U.S. 
State Department's special coordinator on Cyprus, informed him 
in London that [Turkish Cypriot Leader Rauf] Denktas' positions 
have not changed to bring him closer to the UN document 
submitted in the proximity talks. He added that Lamb will not 
play any role in the future because he will retire and move on 
to the private sector. Responding to a question on what he 
expects from the United States, the president said that he 
expects it to point out to the Turkish prime minister that the 
time for a solution to the Cyprus problem has come, that keeping 
things the way they are is not a solution, and that the Turkish 
Government must pressure Denktas to negotiate logically. 
Responding to another question, President Kliridhis noted that 
the new map on Famagusta, to which Denktas referred, is not new 
but has been submitted with the document tabled by the UN 
secretary general's representatives. Denktas then questioned 
its contents, Kliridhis said, and claimed that it included areas 
beyond the fenced part of the town. 
  Regarding the next steps, President Kliridhis said that the 
government will intensify its efforts for the demilitarization 
of Cyprus and its membership in the European Union. When Turkey 
realizes that Cyprus will become a part of Europe, he said, its 
expansionist dreams will evaporate and it will realize that it 
is no longer beneficial to be an occupation force on Cypriot 
territory. There should also be an enlightenment campaign based 
on the UN secretary general's reports, which have all said that 
the Turkish side is far away from both the secretary general's 
positions and the confidence-building measures. President 
Kliridhis added that we should stress that the continuation of a 
fruitless dialogue is not productive. Asked about his 
revelations made in London regarding the unified defense 
doctrine between Cyprus and Greece, President Kliridhis stressed 
that the purpose is for all to know that we are no longer 
willing to allow Turkey to have the military advantage.

<F P=106> [Punctuation as published] </F>
  [Text] TRNC [Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus] President 
Rauf Denktas has said that Greek Cypriot leader Glavkos 
Kliridhis' main objective is to have the Greek Cypriots enter 
Maras [Varosha] and that the UN officials wish to have the 
Turkish Cypriots transfer the area to the Greek Cypriots without 
taking anything tangible in return. 
  Denktas has assessed the latest situation in the indirect 
talks between the two sides in Cyprus for the TURKISH CYPRIOT 
NEWS AGENCY. Accusing the Greek Cypriot side of rupturing the 
package of confidence-building measures [CBM's], he said they 
must repair it. Denktas stressed that significant pressure has 
been directed on the Turkish Cypriot side to force it to agree 
to the package and noted that the changes effected in the 
package concern the issue of sovereignty and as such cannot be 
accepted. 
  Denktas recalled that Glavkos Kliridhis strongly reacted to 
UN Secretary General Butrus Butrus-Ghali's latest intermediary 
report: 
  ``Kliridhis revealed that he had seen the initial draft of 
that report. He also complained that particular changes were 
made to its final form in favor of the Turkish Cypriots. 
Consequently, the Greek Cypriots have regarded it as a moderate 
document against the Turkish Cypriots. 
  Why have the Greek Cypriots described the report as a 
moderate document? Obviously, somebody must have made other 
promises to them. That person also showed them the initial 
draft of the report. That person, whoever he may be, has 
definitely not facilitated the talks by playing such a game. 
The Greek Cypriot community has described the CBM's package as 
a `catastrophic' document. Kliridhis can talk on behalf of that 
community, including the other Greek Cypriot leaders, the Greek 
Cypriot Church, and EOKA [National Organization of Cypriot 
Fighters]. What has he said to them? Let me outline things: 
`Do not worry. In essence, I have agreed to nothing. I have 
purportedly agreed to the CBM's package for tactical purposes 
because the Turkish Cypriot side is confronted with several 
problems. The Turkish Cypriots cannot agree to that package as 
it stands.' That is why Kliridhis has said he `is ready to 
accept the CBM's package, providing the Turkish Cypriot leader 
does likewise.' What does that mean? The UN officials have 
been unable to assess that. They expect us to transfer Maras to 
the Greek Cypriots without receiving anything tangible in 
return.'' 
  Denktas said that Kliridhis' main objective is to have the 
Greek Cypriots enter Maras. Stressing that the Greek Cypriot 
leader cares for nothing else, Denktas asserted that the Turkish 
Cypriot side calls for the establishment of a functional UN 
Administration and for a tangible form to the rights and powers 
it will gain. He stressed: 
  ``Kliridhis has not even informed the other political party 
leaders of the second `nondocument paper,' which he purported to 
accept for tactical reasons... How can that be? The Turkish 
Cypriot side is expected to make concessions for an agreement 
that the Greek Cypriot side does not wish to accept... Why is 
that so? What will happen to the concessions we may make if the 
Greek Cypriot side rejects the agreement? We will have made 
concessions for nothing. But the Greek Cypriot side's position 
in the next round of talks will be a step ahead of us... 
  Can the Turkish Cypriots be expected to make concessions in 
accordance with the promises that are made by this or that 
person? Why have U.S. Ambassador Richard Boucher and the other 
officials not documented in a tangible way what they have 
verbally guaranteed? They are working on the text of an 
agreement, which will say that we `will place Maras under UN 
jurisdiction and the Greek Cypriots will return to that area.' 
That will be put on record... What will the Turkish Cypriots 
receive in return?'' 
<H5>  I Have Been Subjected to Pressure </H5>
  Recalling that significant pressure has been directed on the 
Turkish Cypriot side to force it to agree to the initial CBM's 
package, Denktas stressed that the Turkish Cypriots have 
remained within the parameters promised to them. So, he said, 
the ball is in the Greek Cypriot court. Reiterating the Turkish 
Cypriot side's views on the status of Dhimokratias Avenue in 
Maras, Denktas asserted: 
  ``We insisted that we retain the north of Dhimokratias 
Avenue 
so that the security of the Port of Famagusta and its environs 
can be guaranteed. But the UN secretary general clearly 
informed us as follows: `You will retain the access road to 
Maras in the south of that area. Travel to and from Maras will 
be under your control. The UN officials will be responsible for 
law and order in Maras... The issue of security cannot be an 
excuse...' Considering that, we agreed to give up Dhimokratias 
Avenue. But afterward, the UN General Secretariat moved 
immediately to say: `The exercise on Maras will be meaningless 
if the access road is not placed under UN jurisdiction. A 
massive hole was drilled in the package in favor of the Greek 
Cypriots. I have repeatedly said that `I cannot have the TRNC 
Republican Assembly and the Turkish Cypriot people agree to that 
package with such a hole in it.' But no one seems to 
understand.'' 
  Stressing that the package must be repaired by the Greek 
Cypriots because they are responsible for rupturing it, Denktas 
asserted that nothing can be achieved by blaming the Turkish 
Cypriot side and that maintaining the talks is the only way to 
solve the problem. 
<H5>  Clark's Disclosures </H5>
  Recalling that the UN General Secretariat submitted the 
initial CBM's package to the two sides on the condition that "it 
cannot be changed and that the Turkish and Greek Cypriots must 
remain within its framework," Denktas stressed that the UN 
General Secretariat drilled a hole in the CBM's package in favor 
of the Greek Cypriots without the consent of the Turkish Cypriot 
side. 
  Denktas also assessed remarks by Joe Clark, the UN secretary 
general's special representative to Cyprus, to journalists in 
New York. Stressing that the benefits and rights the Turkish 
Cypriots stand to gain from the first package have been given no 
tangible form, Denktas recalled the promises made to the Turkish 
Cypriot side in return for Maras and noted that he was informed 
that several of those promises would be fulfilled if he agreed 
to place the area under UN jurisdiction. He described that as 
"an unreliable situation." 
  Asserting that a tangible form must be given to the promises 
made to the Turkish Cypriot side, Denktas said that the changes 
effected in the package against the Turkish Cypriots cannot be 
described as being of "secondary importance," because they have 
harmed the essence of the package and indicated that the 
promises made have been rescinded. 
  Denktas stressed that the Turkish Cypriot side must retain 
its control of the access road to Maras in the south of that 
area and noted that the issue is vitally important for the 
Turkish Cypriots. Recalling the UN secretary general's promise 
on the issue, Denktas said that no one seems to remember it 
apart from the Turkish Cypriot side. 
  Denktas asserted that the promises made to the Turkish 
Cypriot side on the Nicosia International Airport have not been 
fulfilled either. He stressed that the failure of the UN 
officials to fulfill their promises has disrupted the balance. 
But no one seems to care about that, he said. 
  Denktas reiterated that the Turkish Cypriot side is prepared 
to maintain the indirect talks and blamed Glavkos Kliridhis for 
creating a deadlock in the negotiating process. He said: "We 
maintain our contacts with the UN officials... We will see what 
will happen in four weeks." 
  Arguing that Joe Clark, in a bid to satisfy the Greek 
Cypriot 
side, wants to force the Turkish Cypriots to agree to various 
issues, Denktas said that the Turkish Cypriot side only wants 
the promises that were made fulfilled.

  [Text] Ladies and Gentlemen, we now broadcast an emergency 
report that we have just received. A new Turkish provocation 
took place in Nicosia today at 1430 GMT this afternoon. 
According to information obtained by CyBC [Cyprus Broadcasting 
Corporation], near Famagusta Gate a Turkish soldier left his 
guardpost, entered a prohibited area of the buffer zone, and 
headed toward a National Guard guardpost. A national guardsman 
called on the Turkish soldier to leave the area immediately. 
The Turkish soldier did not obey and the national guardsman was 
forced to fire warning shots into the air. The Turkish soldier 
then withdrew. 
  Defense Minister Konstandinos Iliadhis told CyBC just a 
short 
while ago that the republic's authorities strongly protested to 
UNFICYP [UN Force in Cyprus] on the new Turkish provocation. An 
UNFICYP spokesman told CyBC that the incident is under 
investigation. It is not serious, he said. 
  The illegal Turkish Cypriot radio station [Bayrak] concealed 
the Turkish side's attempt to cause tension and reported that a 
Greek Cypriot national guardsman provoked a Turkish soldier by 
firing shots against his guardpost. 
  It is now calm in the area but the National Guard is 
following the situation closely.

  [Text] In yesterday's elections for local authorities in 
five municipal areas and 253 communities, four out the five 
mayors elected were AKEL [Restorative Party of the Working 
People] candidates while most of the community heads elected 
were independent candidates. 
  The following mayors were elected: Panikos Louroutziatis in 
Yermasoyia, Varvara Perikleous in Ayia Napa, Florendia Ioannou 
in Dherinia, Menelaos Khristodhoulou in Yeroskipos, all AKEL 
candidates, and Dhimitrios Kappetzis, who was supported by DIKO 
[Democratic Party] in Peyia. 
  Some 13 AKEL candidates became municipal councilors--three 
in 
Yermasoyia, four in Dherinia, and two each in Ayia Napa, 
Yeroskipos, and Peyia. Some eight DISI [Democratic Rally] 
candidates were elected as councillors--two each in Yermasoyia, 
Dherinia, Yeroskipos, and Peyia. And four DIKO councilors were 
elected--one each in Yermasoyia and Yeroskipos and two in Peyia. 
The DISI-DIKO partnership had two candidates elected as 
municipal councilors in Ayia Napa. EDEK [United Democratic 
Union of Cyprus] got one municipal councillor in Yeroskipos 
while two independents became Ayia Napa councillors. 
  In the community elections, 164 independent candidates were 
elected as community heads, 22 from the DISI-DIKO partnership 
were elected, 22 AKEL, 10 DISI, three DIKO, and two EDEK. Five 
community heads were elected by ballot because they received the 
same number of votes as their nearest rivals. They are the 
community heads in the villages of Perapedhi, Ayios Dhimitrios, 
Episkopi, Kato Moni, and Philousa Kedharon.

  [Text] The Turkish National Assembly's decision [as heard] 
to turn Ayia Sofia into a mosque represents another provocation 
by Turkey. 
  Deputy Foreign Minister Yeoryios Papandreou said that this 
development causes concern. Public Order Minister Stilianos 
Papathemelis described the Turkish decision as an advanced form 
of provocation. New Democracy issued a statement asking for the 
World Council of Churches to convene and for mobilization of all 
Greeks throughout the world to prevent the desecration of Ayia 
Sofia. 
  Commenting on the proposal to turn Ayia Sofia into a mosque, 
Government spokesman Evangelos Venizelos said that, given its 
everyday practices, Turkey needs to prove that it has some kind 
of relation with what is called European civilization. Turkey, 
the spokesman said, has the duty to prove that. 
  Archbishop Serafim of Athens issued a letter to the United 
Nations and all other international and church organizations as 
well as to the leaders of Christian churches regarding the 
threats against the Ecumenical Patriarchate by Islamists.

  [Text] Referring to yesterday's statement by Turkish 
Foreign Ministry spokesman Ferhat Ataman, who rushed to condemn 
our country for the incident at the Albanian guard post, 
Government spokesman Evangelos Venizelos said that the Turkish 
side is trying to create tension or is exporting domestic 
problems. This Turkish interest in Greek-Albanian relations 
should be noted because it could be useful in the interpretation 
of various problems or events, the spokesman said. 
  Today, on the pretext of the latest developments in Albania, 
Skopje [The Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia] also appeared 
provocative. Skopje attacked the Greek Government and described 
our country as a source of problems in the Balkans. Greece was 
also accused of seeking clashes between the Albanians of Skopje 
and Skopjeans.

  [Text] Prime Minister Andreas Papandreou today was 
reelected chairman of PASOK [Panhellenic Socialist Movement] by 
a voice vote from those attending the party's third congress. 
In his speech, which closed the congress, Papandreou said that 
Greece with PASOK in the government is ready to enter the new 
century with security, prosperity, and democracy. PASOK is 
modern, united, collective, strong, democratic and open to the 
people. PASOK is ready to win the many successive battles that 
it will face in the near future. 
  Papandreou said that PASOK was not born to become a [word 
indistinct] star in the country's public life. PASOK cannot be 
given away or inherited and will not be broken into pieces. Our 
congress' decision shows a return to the collective PASOK. 
Together we will guarantee, now and in the future, that this 
PASOK will have a direction and certain prospects. Papandreou 
concluded: We still owe this country a lot. With our congress, 
we have made another step forward. I am optimistic that despite 
the uncertainties of our times we will achieve our goals. Hope 
can become reality with a new PASOK that we will build together. 
It will be the PASOK of our dreams and our people's aspirations. 
  During his departure from Athens' Olympic Stadium, Prime 
Minister Papandreou replied to a question about his trip to the 
United States. Papandreou said that he will stage a big battle 
[to explain his views on current issues], a friendly one of 
course, because the climate during the discussion of our 
national issues will be a friendly one. Of course, there will 
be an attempt to improve Greek-U.S. relations, which are good 
but could be better, he added. 
  Replying to another question on the situation in 
Bosnia-Herzegovina, Papandreou said that the latest developments 
are very serious. I know that for the time being there is a 
cease-fire, which means that some people are using their heads, 
he said. However, the balance is very delicate, he added, and we 
cannot know what will happen from one moment to the next. 
Papandreou concluded by saying that Yugoslavia is one of the 
issues he will discuss with U.S. President Bill Clinton at the 
White House.

  [Text] Regarding yesterday's incident with the small Greek 
ship that is being held by the Albanian authorities at Sarande, 
Foreign Minister Karolos Papoulias said that, as in the past, a 
solution will be found through diplomatic means. 
  Vice Consul Vasilios Bournovas from the Greek consulate at 
Gjirokaster today visited the captain of the Greek ship. 
Prosecutor Khristos Milos, who is in charge of the case, has 
informed the vice-consul that those arrested will be detained 
until Monday [18 April], when he hopes that they will be freed.

<F P=106> [Interview with Foreign Minister Hikmet Cetin by </F>
unidentified correspondent in the TRT studio -- live] 
  [Text] [Correspondent] Mr. Minister, very important 
developments have taken place in Bosnia-Herzegovina during the 
early evening hours of today. First, the Serbs shot down a 
British war plane belonging to NATO and later entered Gorazde 
with tanks. It was reported moments ago that they opened mortar 
fire on houses in Gorazde. The latest news is regarding the 
NATO air operation. How do you assess these developments? 
  [Cetin] I would like to say first, that for a long time now, 
the United Nations has been acting very hesitantly. It has been 
15 days now that intense Serb attacks have been continuing 
around Gorazde. The United Nations thought that the crisis 
could be solved at the table and therefore tried to perpetuate 
diplomatic contacts. There is only one language the assailant 
can understand, and that is the language of determination from 
the opposite side. The Serbs gained courage when hesitancy 
started -- on whether NATO should intervene or not -- or when 
the allies and the forces serving in Bosnia-Herzegovina 
disagreed. As a result, the Serbs intensified their siege of 
Gorazde since last night. Civilians live in Gorazde and 
actually the situation this afternoon was the consequence of 
mortar fire on a hospital. The air operation was started to 
stop the Serbs and consequently the Serbs shot down a British 
plane. 
  Since we had already foreseen these developments while we 
were closely following the events last night, we conducted 
intensive contacts in NATO and at the United Nations. We called 
on the UN Security Council to hold an extraordinary meeting. It 
is obvious that there is a difference of views between the 
civilian and the military branch of the United Nations in 
Sarajevo and Bosnia-Herzegovina. It is obvious that there is a 
lack of communication between General Rose and Yasushi Akashi. 
Proof of this is when General Rose asked for intervention 
yesterday but there was a belief that the situation would be 
solved by negotiations. A meeting was held with the Bosnian 
authorities in Sarajevo this afternoon but no results were 
reached. 
  I held two to three telephone conversations with the Bosnian 
Prime Minister Haris Silajdzic and contacted the United Nations 
and NATO once more. The important issue in this matter is as 
follows: There are civilians living in Gorazde and the Bosnian 
army is not mounting serious opposition. In view of this 
situation, great responsibility falls on the United Nations and 
NATO. It goes without saying that we do not want war but we 
have to respond in a language that those that choose war 
understand. 
  Gorazde is totally encircled right now. They can capture 
Gorazde whenever they want. Actually Gorazde has been in such a 
situation from the beginning. The interesting thing in this 
situation is that the United Nations chose six safe areas. How 
can the United Nations, which cannot secure the safe areas, 
secure the people of Bosnia-Herzegovina? As a matter of fact, a 
number of UN officials were abducted by Serbs yesterday and a 
lot of effort went into freeing them, during which a soldier was 
killed. 
  We are especially stressing the fact that we are taking 
every 
initiative necessary. Our president sent -- will send -- 
messages now. We are conducting the necessary contacts. What 
is important is to act with determination. The minute we show 
we are hesitant -- when NATO intervenes then asks whether it 
should have done so or not or whether it was sufficient or not 
-- then we are not talking the same language as our opponent. 
There should be no hesitation. The opposite side gains courage 
when there is hesitation. For this reason the UN authorities in 
Bosnia-Herzegovina should use their power without waiting any 
longer and with the power invested in them should call NATO to 
duty. Only by these means can the situation be saved, 
otherwise, the United Nations will be responsible for what 
happens to the people of Gorazde. 
  We will follow the situation closely all through the night. 
All our friends in the Ministry are on duty and I hope that the 
Serbs will be deterred when they see this determination and in 
case they are not, NATO should conduct a serious intervention in 
the situation. 
  [Correspondent] Mr. Minister, don't you think the NATO air 
operation is a favorable development? 
  [Cetin] Yes, the operation is very favorable. We reiterated 
our appeal to NATO. We continued with our contacts all through 
last night. NATO should not show hesitancy until a result is 
achieved. What we wish, actually, is that the result be reached 
by means of negotiations. That is, the Serbs should give up 
their siege and surrender all their heavy weapons to the United 
Nations and if not, the necessary response should be given 
because it is obvious that the only language the Serb 
administration understands is the language of force and 
determination and this determination should be shown.

<F P=106> [Interview with Foreign Minister Hikmet Cetin by Mehmet </F>
Alkas in the TRT studio -- live] 
  [Text] [Alkas] One can observe that the United Nations is 
ineffective in the face of the Serbian attacks against the safe 
havens in Bosnia-Herzegovina and primarily in Gorazde. 
Communication between the UN forces and NATO in 
Bosnia-Herzegovina is weak and there is a deficiency in the 
execution of duties. What are your views on the issue? 
  [Cetin] This also derives from the structure of the United 
Nations. Current organizations and international institutions, 
and especially the United Nations, are conceptualized to suit 
the Cold War period. These organizations have not been able to 
adapt themselves to the new situation with the elimination of 
the Cold War and the two blocs. They were quite deficient in 
adapting to the new reality. When we take the United Nations 
into consideration, this is one of the problems. 
  The second problem is that this organization has no 
political 
will. The political will belongs to the nations. Within the 
structure of the United Nations actually it is not the political 
will of the 187 members but rather that of the Security Council 
members and especially the five permanent members within the 
Council. The political will of these five members is actually 
reflected or implemented. Since a unity of views cannot be 
secured among these five members the United Nations is thus 
rendered helpless. 
  The third point is that the United Nations does not have its 
own military force. It can only recruit forces from among its 
members. Many times these forces cannot act independently from 
these nations. They implement the policies of their countries. 
  The forth significant point is that the United Nations has 
no 
power to secure peace. It is trying to secure a peace that is 
not stable. There is no peace in Bosnia-Herzegovina. They are 
called the peacekeeping forces. How can you keep a peace that 
is nonexistent? This also causes some problems. 
  Now, NATO has reached a decision saying that if the United 
Nations makes an appeal to NATO then it will undertake the 
necessary operation. Because this region is beyond NATO 
jurisdiction. As you have expressed in your question a while 
ago, they behaved most indecisively there. This implementation 
has affected the credibility and respectability of NATO. When 
an appeal was made to NATO one or two planes undertook an 
operation. This not only lacked any deterrence it actually 
encouraged the Serbs. This is what happened in Gorazde. 
  Beyond that there were differences of views between the 
civilian and military commanders in Bosnia-Herzegovina. For 
example, the military commander requested an intervention two 
days ago. Whereas, the civilian administrator was opposed to 
it. Bosnia-Herzegovina is, in a way, paying the price for all 
these negative points. The Bosnian people are paying the price 
and Azerbaijan is paying the price in the Caucasus. 
  Now Gorazde has been under siege for the last 20 days. It 
has reached the point that.... [pauses] The United Nations is 
powerless. Some 200 UN peacekeeping troops are being held 
hostage by the Serbs. In other words they cannot even protect 
their own forces, they cannot ensure the security of their own 
people. How can such a United Nations protect the people of 
Gorazde? 
  [Alkas] How come the Serbs are so bold? 
  [Cetin] I believe that the world and these organizations 
have not issued a message in the language that the Serbs can 
understand. They did not give the message that, if necessary, 
they will intervene to the very end. They could not deter them, 
they only encouraged them. For example, for the last few days 
they gave the impression that an agreement was being reached 
while they actually were helping the Serbs gain time. 
  [Alkas] On the one hand they said they would withdraw and on 
the other they continued their attacks. 
  [Cetin] I talked with the Bosnian president a while ago 
before coming to the studio. He said that the situation is very 
critical, that no one is intervening, and that the tanks have 
begun to enter one section of the city. Of course, the Bosnian 
people will not be defeated with the occupation of Gorazde. 
They will continue their heroic struggle as they have done for 
the last two years. 
  Given the situation, however, another duty befalls the 
United 
Nations. Since you cannot protect them then allow them to 
protect themselves. Let us try and lift this arms embargo. 
Turkey has been working on this from the every beginning. If 
you cannot protect the safe havens, if you cannot protect the 
people in that region, and if you cannot protect your own 
people, then you can at least lift the arms embargo imposed on 
Bosnia-Herzegovina and grant the Bosnian army and people to 
right to protect themselves. 
  [Alkas] We thank you, Mr. minister.

<F P=106> [Interview with Ambassador Inal Batu, Turkey's permanent </F>
representative to the United Nations, by Zafer Kiraz in New 
York, date not given -- recorded] 
  [Text] [Kiraz] Turkey has been taking steps since the 
beginning of the war against the cruelty, and suffering in 
Bosnia-Herzegovina. What has Turkey done after the latest 
Gorazde incident? What is the latest situation at the United 
Nations? 
  [Batu] The Serbs have been attacking Gorazde for the past 17 
days. We believe that these attacks can be stopped only by 
resorting to force. We have been explaining our position to our 
friends insistently. We have activated the Islamic Conference 
Organization [ICO] contact group. We took several steps. I 
believe that the two air raids were finally carried out thanks 
to the ICO representations led by Turkey. These were 
insufficient, however. In fact, they were so insufficient and 
weak that the aggressor became even more daring. We are 
concerned, very concerned. We are sad because the UN Security 
Council which merely watched the developments reach the present 
situation continued to be disorganized and helpless today as 
well. I have been calling the term president of the Security 
Council since this morning. So has the Bosnia-Herzegovina 
representative. The term president does not even answer the 
calls. There is no action on the part of the five big powers. 
I repeat: Gorazde is a so-called secure region. Who is 
supposed to make it secure? The United Nations. What kind of 
security is this? 
  [Kiraz] Thank you, sir. 
  [Batu] I thank you.

<F P=106> [Unattributed article: "Messages Abound in Sunday's </F>
Demonstrations"] 
  [Text] Ankara--As the public mulls over the significance of 
the weekend demonstrations by an angry pro-Islamic and 
ultranationalist coalition of forces--angry in this case at the 
Bosnian Serbs' unopposed entry into Gorazde--analysts and 
diplomats in Ankara were busy on Monday [11 April] trying to 
decipher the messages in this development which carried 
disturbing implications. 
  The targets chosen by thousands of rampaging demonstrators 
chanting religious and nationalist slogans and demonstrating a 
clear inclination to go out of hand, if a convergence of certain 
events took place, merely added to the importance of trying to 
understand what had happened and what may follow in its wake. 
In Ankara the main targets were the United Nations 
building--which was pelted with rocks and forced to take down 
its flag to appease the crowds--the U.S. embassy--whose grounds 
were entered and windows smashed--and the Russian trade mission 
which was also showered with rocks. 
  These were attacked alongside "domestic targets" such as the 
state owned Turkish Radio and Television's (TRT) building, and 
the headquarters of the ruling True Path Party (DYP) with both 
also having their windows smashed. 
  Apart from the attacks on the TRT, the privately owned media 
was also showered with abuse and its reporters and cameramen 
jostled and kicked. 
  At one point during the demonstration in Ankara there was 
also serious concern that the crowd might also turn against the 
Parliament grounds, which are in the same vicinity of all the 
other targets attacked. 
  All of these targets were significant and indicative of the 
ultimate political inclination of those partaking in the 
demonstrations and who and what they stood opposed to when the 
chips are down. 
  These demonstrators were not only attacking one of Turkey's 
closest allies, together with an international institution 
which, for all its shortcomings, Turkey continues to be a 
staunch supporter of. At moments it appeared that they would 
also turn against the key institutions of what is integral to 
Turkey's secular and pluralist system. 
  The fact that the demonstrations in Ankara and Istanbul were 
attended by thousands of people carrying religious banners and 
shouting angrily with fists in the air had automatically 
increased the explosive nature of the situation at hand. 
Officials were saying later that while everything ended with 
just a few smashed windows this was not due to the police but in 
fact a matter of luck. Especially when the police in both Ankara 
and Istanbul were clearly taken by surprise, totally outnumbered 
and in effect unable to control the crowd numbering thousands up 
to 10,000 in Ankara and 20,000 in Istanbul. The sigh of relief 
among officials later was also coloured by the fact that the 
Marines in the U.S. embassy compound, a part of which had been 
overrun by the demonstrators, did not make any move that would 
have sparked off something which would be extremely difficult to 
control and clear up later. 
  In fact the speed with which the Turkish public later got 
news of the NATO airstrikes against Serbian targets in Gorazde 
suggested close cooperation between the U.S. and Turkey in order 
to diffuse the situation. 
  Giving the news before CNN and all the other international 
agencies TRT said in its 8.00 pm bulletin that the information 
had come from Turkish military sources who in turn were quoting 
NATO sources. 
  Given that the planes in the operation against the Serb 
targets were U.S. the assumption in Ankara was that this quick 
transfer of information was the product of the two sides working 
to ensure things did not get out of hand in Turkey especially 
vis a vis the U.S. embassy and other western targets. The mood 
in the Turkish Foreign Ministry following these events was 
inevitably gloomy given that developments and images carrying 
overtones of Iran in 1979 had gone out of the two main cities of 
Turkey whose pride and joy is its secular system. Trying to 
play down in Western capitals the RP's [Welfare Party] success, 
Sunday's developments were precisely the kind of thing that 
Ankara has been keen to avoid. 
  What the crowds in Ankara and Istanbul, as well as other 
cities around Turkey, were incensed at was reports that Bosnian 
Serbs had entered Gorazde which they had been bombing since 
March 29. 
  Rumour was spread that the Serbs were using chemical 
weapons and killing of thousands of Bosnian Moslems as they 
progressed into Gorazde. 
  When the news of this was disseminated in a provoking manner 
by two private TV channels, and when officials--including Prime 
Minister Tansu Ciller and State Minister and Government 
Spokesman Yildirim Aktuna gave statements suggesting the 
information was true--the crowd could not be contained, 
believing as it did that thousands of their Bosnian brethren 
were being mercilessly slaughtered at that very moment. Charged 
with the fervour of the gains by the RP and the ultranationalist 
Nationalist Movement Party (MHP) in the local election, the 
crowd--mostly supporters of these parties--turned their ire to 
"the Christian West, which refuses to act while Moslems are 
being slaughtered," and it institutions, such as the U.N. as 
well as its extensions in Turkey such as the TRT and the DYP. 
  Most analysts believe that this whole incident has proved to 
be "an excellent object lesson" to government officials in 
Turkey about when to speak and when not to speak on occasions 
that touch on public sensitivities. 
  It was noteworthy that while Ciller and Aktuna appeared to 
be 
"playing to the gallery," that foreign minister Hikmet Cetin was 
indicating there was no evidence that chemical weapons had been 
used, that he had checked this, not just with U.N. and NATO 
sources, by also the Bosnian Prime Minister in Sarajevo which is 
only 65 kilometers from Gorazde. 
  The bottom line was that while tension reached fever pitch 
as 
these rumors were being spread neither Ciller nor Aktuna had 
bothered to check with the foreign ministry as to what the 
situation really was in Gorazde. 
  Ciller's critics say that having turned her visit to 
Sarajevo 
in February, together with the Pakistani Prime Minister Benazir 
Bhutto, into political capital prior to the local elections, she 
is still captivated by the issue which makes her give statements 
that are not absolutely sound. 
  But there is also a message here for Bosnian Muslim 
officials 
whose attempt at drawing attention to atrocities by introducing 
unconfirmed elements into their account of events--in order to 
add a heightened sense of urgency--has clearly been seen to be 
explosive in Turkey's case. 
  Given the heightened sensitivities in Turkey following the 
self-confidence gained by the pro-Islamic and ultranationalists 
after their electoral gains this element in Turkish society is 
seeking missionary outlets to vent its new found strength. 
Bosnia has proved itself to be an important galvanizing factor 
in this case, making it incumbent not just on Turkish officials, 
but also Bosnian officials to act cautiously and responsibly in 
volatile circumstances such as the one surrounding Gorazde. 
  The presence of an official from the Bosnian Embassy trying 
to calm the angry crowds down in Ankara as they tried to storm 
the U.S. Embassy appeared to demonstrate that even the Bosnians 
were disturbed by the "political Frankenstein" that had been 
released into the streets of Turkey. 
  The main message of what transpired in Istanbul and Ankara, 
as well as other cities in the country, on Sunday is of course 
to the key countries in the West. 
  These events have signalled the extent to which the Islamic 
masses around the world are being pushed to taking a specific 
view of the West, and all that is associated with it, because of 
what appears to be Western indifference to the slaughter of 
Moslems in places such as Bosnia-Herzegovina. 
  If the U.N. and the main countries in the Security Council 
had acted decisively days before against the Serbs when they 
first attacked Gorazde, which is supposedly a U.N. safe haven, 
the chances are Sunday's scenes from around Turkey would not 
have taken place. This lack of overall determination to say a 
definite stop to the Serbs is today sowing the seeds for 
hundreds of thousands of Mujahedeen. 
  If these ever "hit the streets" charged as they will with an 
irrepressible feeling of vengeance, then the West is going to 
suffer as much as countries like Turkey--whatever its broader 
plans and calculations may be.

<F P=106> [Announcer-read report over still of Mentese] </F>
  [Text] Interior Minister Nahit Mentese has said that 
everyone has the right to organize meetings and demonstrations 
in line with the freedom of expression and of thought, adding 
that, however, this should be done within the framework of the 
law. 
  Mentese issued a statement in connection with demonstrations 
held in certain cities in recent days disrupting public order. 
He said that marches and rallies might be curbed with the aim 
of securing public order and preventing the disruption of city 
security. Pointing out that the way in which rallies and 
demonstration can be held are stipulated by the Constitution and 
the law, Mentese said: Everyone should be aware that the rights 
and freedoms granted to individuals and democratic organizations 
through the law, can be curtailed or banned -- without damaging 
the essence of the fundamental rights and freedoms -- in the 
event laws are trespassed or crimes committed while these rights 
and freedoms are being exercised.

  [Text] Turkey has announced that in the existing sensitive 
atmosphere in the region, it is important that all Balkan 
countries refrain from actions that will further strain existing 
tensions. 
  In reply to a question, Foreign Ministry spokesman Ferhat 
Ataman said that reports on a raid organized on 10 April against 
a military training camp on Albanian territory near the Greek 
border cause regret and concern for the future of the region. 
Expressing understanding for the concern felt by Albania in the 
face of provocations and threats, Ataman remarked that countries 
that plan to pressure their neighbors through the actions of 
terrorist groups should realize that they cannot be left out of 
the negative developments that stem from such provocations.

  [Text] During the most recent National Security Council 
[NSC] meeting, which was to be devoted to the economic package, 
the latest political and military developments in Greece, South 
Cyprus, Bosnia, and Macedonia were also discussed. It was 
reported that the Balkan developments were discussed in 
connection with the internal problems of Turkey. In particular, 
it was concluded that Greece "is intensifying its policy of 
exploiting the Kurdish problem to weaken Turkey." 
  A diplomat serving at the NSC General Secretariat said: "The 
public is not aware of it, but Turkey is rapidly being dragged 
into the Balkans clashes. Turkey is involved in the bargaining 
over Bosnia. In return for the joint decision to send troops to 
Bosnia, a promise has been made to Turkey. It certainly does 
not concern concessions in Bosnia. It may be a promise to help 
Turkey gain the initiative in the Middle East, or of U.S. 
support for Turkey against the PKK [Workers Party of Kurdistan]. 
Political circles are talking about the wresting of a 
concession from Ankara during the U.S.-Turkey Joint Defense 
Council meeting in Ankara. The United States has no dispute 
with Turkey regarding the Kurdish problem. Though the Bosnian 
situation has attracted the public's attention, the most 
important issue for Turkey is the recent tension with Greece." 
<H5>  "Tension Could Develop With Greece" </H5>
  Speaking to AYDINLIK, the diplomat continued by indicating 
that there is a possibility of a small-scale clash in the 
Aegean, and said: "The tension between Turkey and Greece will 
reach its climax during the Papandreou administration. A 
frightening tension has developed in recent days. The Turkish 
Foreign Ministry is extremely nervous about Greece, and a 
small-scale clash in the Aegean cannot be ruled out. Greece is 
doing everything to provoke such a development. Papandreou has 
launched an intense campaign against Turkey in south Cyprus for 
the past four months. They have reestablished EOKA [National 
Organization of Cypriot Fighters], and Greece has incorporated 
Cyprus within its defense zone. The Enosis [union of Cyprus 
with Greece] initiative, launched by a bloody coup in 1974, is 
now being promoted with velvet gloves. They have armed the 
Greek Cypriots excessively, and the army has been put on alert. 
In the meantime, Greece has stepped up pressure on the Turkish 
minority in Thrace. With the decision to dispatch Turkish 
troops to Bosnia, Greece launched an intensive counteroffensive. 
The dispatch of Greek Cypriot volunteers to Serbia is being 
organized in Cyprus and Greece. They are being sent there `to 
kill Turks.' Serious problems will arise if the soldiers of the 
Turkish contingent in Bosnia come under such attacks." 
<H5>  PKK Promised Government in Exile </H5>
  In addition to the international developments, the NSC 
meeting also discussed Greece's support for the PKK. It 
reportedly examined allegations that the PKK's anti-tourism 
bombings in Turkey are being planned in south Cyprus. A report 
submitted to the NSC states that the PKK has been promised it 
can open official missions in Athens and south Nicosia, and that 
they will open soon. The report adds that the Greek government 
has promised the PKK it can establish "a government in exile" 
in Athens or Nicosia. 
  Reportedly Turkey will be making preparations to counter 
these developments in the coming days. 
  The NSC feels that intervention in Greece would not elicit a 
strong reaction from the West. 
  An NSC expert pointed out that a crisis with Greece would 
promote national reconciliation inside Turkey.

  [Text] Turkey has announced that the escalating violence 
in Israel and in the occupied territories cause concern. In a 
statement, the Foreign Ministry strongly condemned the mutual 
attacks being perpetrated by extremists and causing the death of 
innocent Israelis and Palestinians. The statement says: It must 
be understood by all that terrorism will not help achieve any 
legitimate aims. We call on the sides to jointly fight 
terrorism and to cooperate in order not to halt the negotiating 
process at this critical stage of the peace negotiations. We 
hope that the terrorist activities which intensified in recent 
days are not repeated.

<F P=106> [Studio interview with Alain Lamassoure, minister delegate </F>
for European affairs, by Annette Ardisson; from the "Questions 
From A to B" program -- live] 
  [Excerpts] [Ardisson] In Bosnia the UN peacekeepers have 
become targets and hostages, particularly the French 
peacekeepers, first and foremost because they are there in 
greater numbers than the others. Is it not very tempting to 
pull them out? 
  [Lamassoure] No one should lay a finger on French soldiers, 
no one should lay a finger on the UN peacekeepers, and no one 
should lay a finger on French soldiers. Since yesterday we have 
observed that some of them have apparently been surrounded, 
indeed threatened, by Serbian forces. We will not accept this; 
the United Nations does not accept this, and has made a 
statement which was read out a short while ago on your newscast. 
France is at pains to recall that it absolutely insists that 
the UN resolutions be accepted and that UNPROFOR [UN Protection 
Force] should have the means necessary to fulfill its mission. 
[passage omitted] 
  Unfortunately, the crux of the problem, which is the war 
between the Bosnians and the Serbs, remains. 
  [Ardisson] If I understand you correctly, this is a 
diplomatic error on the part of the Americans. 
  [Lamassoure] No, it is not a diplomatic error. The two 
agreements [between Croats and Muslims, and between Serbs and 
Croats] constitute progress, but at the point we have reached at 
present we now have to...[pauses] It is time for all the 
parties to the conflict and all the international diplomatic 
partners --in other words, the European Union, the United 
States, and Russia -- to sit down around a table to achieve an 
overall political settlement. Thus, in view of this worsening 
of the crisis which we have been witnessing for several days 
now, we now have to wield both the stick and the carrot: the 
stick, which is that no one must lay a finger on UN soldiers, 
and the carrot, which is that from the point at which everyone 
agrees to return to the negotiating table and discuss the 
political future of Bosnia -- because after all this is how it 
must end -- we will then be able to see what the international 
community can do to help with the reconstruction of Bosnia. An 
operation is already being established in Sarajevo, and will be 
established shortly in Mostar. We must also take into account 
the efforts made by the Serbs to implement the resolutions of 
the international community. 
  [Ardisson] You talk about wielding the stick, but what stick 
is that? Apparently the UNPROFOR soldiers are powerless, 
because they are being abducted, detained, as if they had no 
means of defense, whereas they have the right to retaliate when 
their security is threatened. 
  [Lamassoure] They have the right, and NATO has the means to 
do this. It has already done so twice, and if necessary it will 
do it again. At the same time we should be confident that all 
of this can end in no way other than a political agreement. 
[passage omitted] 
  [Ardisson] You are saying that the Serbs will not push the 
French soldiers into committing a misdemeanor, in other words 
into war? 
  [Lamassoure] It is not in anyone's interest and in 
particular 
it is not in the Serbs' interest for there to be a worsening of 
the military escalation in Bosnia-Herzegovina. [passage omitted]

  [Text] Serb forces have taken control of most strategic 
points surrounding Gorazde. This has resulted in a mass exodus 
of civilians toward the city center, to where the small UN 
contingent has also withdrawn. One of the British soldiers 
seriously wounded this evening has died of his injuries. In 
Washington, President Clinton said tonight that one should be 
firm with the Serbs but avoid provocation. This evening the 
defense minister, Francois Leotard, reacted too: 
  [Begin Leotard recording] The behavior of the Serb side is 
extremely worrying. It is the continuation of ethnic cleansing 
in Gorazde, as in Sarajevo, as elsewhere. This is unacceptable 
for the international community and for France. Our soldiers 
are there to end the acts of violence and hatred which run 
against the grain of European culture. We fervently wish that, 
through the talks currently underway, the Serb side will 
understand that it cannot win through force, and in the face of 
the international community territorial and other gains rejected 
by the other parties. France will continue to try, with special 
care, through its presence on the ground, through its diplomats 
and the action of its foreign minister, Alain Juppe, to obtain a 
peace settlement, which represents the only solution to this 
conflict. [end recording]

  [Text] Paris, April 15 (AFP) -- France protested Bosnian 
Serb harassment of UN peacekeepers on Friday [15 April] saying 
it could not accept their being taken hostage or targeted. 
  French Foreign Ministry spokesman Richard Duque said: "We 
not 
accept that United Nations Protection Forces (UNPROFOR), whose 
impartiality cannot be doubted, are taken hostage or are 
targeted." 
  French peacekeepers guarding an arms depot near the Bosnian 
capital of Sarajevo have been surrounded by Bosnian Serbs, 
demanding that heavy weapons be handed over to them. 
  The Serbs have also mined the entrances to three other arms 
depots in the Sarajevo area. 
  On Thursday the UN Security Council warned there would be 
"serious consequences" if peacekeepers were harmed in Bosnia and 
demanded that "all parties, and in particular the Bosnian Serb 
party, allow UNPROFOR unimpeded freedom of movement and refrain 
from any further actions which could threaten the safety of 
UNPROFOR personnel." 
  Duque also said there was no new information on 11 
volunteers 
of the French humanitarian group Premiere urgence (First Aid) 
whose convoy of relief aid for Sarajevo was halted last Friday. 
  Premiere urgence says the 11 are being held in a Bosnian 
Serb 
barracks near Pale. "We are pursuing our efforts to obtain 
details and secure their release," Duque said.

being held by Serb soldiers several days after their arrest. 
Soldiers claim that they found ammunitions in the 
organization's trucks. Thierry Mauricet, the president of the 
organization, is worried; he questioned Edouard Balladur when he 
met him at the Humagora international meeting of those 
participing in humanitarian actions, which is currently taking 
place at the Palais des Congres in Paris. Listen to this 
dialogue between the two men recorded by Pascal Misrai: 
  [Begin recording] [Mauricet] [words indistinct] Premiere 
Urgence. I am in charge of the issue, and I know that France is 
exerting pressure to obtain their release, but has not been 
successful yet. 
  [Balladur] Yes, for the time being. We have received 
assurances that their lives are not threatened, but we cannot be 
satisfied with this. France is the most active country in 
Yugoslavia, and I believe we cannot ask less than respect for 
those ensuring humanitarian aid. This is the minimum we are 
demanding. 
  [Mauricet] The current hardening of Serb behavior, the 
latest 
detentions of UNPROFOR [UN Protection Force] blue helmets are 
worrying me. What do you intend to do? Is it possible to stop 
the escalation? 
  [Balladur] We hope so, in any case we are attempting to stop 
it by trying to obtain coherent international action by all 
large countries. I thank you for what you are doing. Believe 
me, no one is forgetting the fate of your 11 friends. [end

<F P=106> [Report by Larry Elliott: "Sutherland and Brittan Hail GATT </F>
as Rescuing the World From Trade Turmoil"] 
  [Text] Marrakesh -- The culmination of the 
seven-and-a-half-year Uruguay Round of trade liberalisation 
talks in Morocco today has dragged the global economy back from 
the brink of protectionism, regionalism and possible military 
conflict, according to the director general of the GATT 
organisation, Peter Sutherland. 
  In an interview with THE GUARDIAN, Mr Sutherland said that 
the package cemented the extension of the market economy and 
would prevent the interests of developing countries from being 
marginalised. 
  Claiming that there would only be winners from the opening 
up 
of trade, he said: "It's notable that the strongest proponents 
of the multilateral system have been the developing countries, 
and the worst elements of protectionism have been in the 
developed world." 
  Mr Sutherland said that he understood the sense of grievance 
held by many developing countries who felt that the fate of the 
Uruguay Round had been determined in Washington and Brussels. 
  He was critical of the attempts by the United States and 
France to raise the question of labour rights in the last few 
weeks. 
  "Profound anxiety has been expressed by a large number of 
developing countries about this particular issue," he said. 
  Mr Sutherland said that no preparatory work had been 
completed on introducing social clauses into the GATT agreement, 
and that there was widespread fear among the poorer nations that 
"protectionism lurked behind it." 
  The GATT director general, who was appointed last summer to 
rescue the talks from potential collapse, said he believed that 
the eighth and most bitterly divisive of the GATT rounds would 
be the last. Future negotiations would be conducted on an 
issue-by-issue basis by the new World Trade Organisation [WTO], 
even though Mr Sutherland is unlikely still to be at the helm. 
  "I do not see a long-term career as an international civil 
servant," he said. 
  He brushed aside fears that the poorer nations, particularly 
in Africa, would lose out as a result of the deal. "There are 
no losers and the biggest winners will be those who would be in 
danger of being marginalised." 
  Like Sir Leon Brittan, the chief European Union [EU] 
negotiator, Mr Sutherland considered that one of the great 
achievements of the round had been the acceptance by the United 
States that trade disputes should be settled through the WTO 
rather than unilaterally imposing sanctions via America's Super 
301 powers. 
  Sir Leon, in a separate interview, said Washington realised 
that the WTO would "severely constrain the way it can have 
recourse to Super 301." 
  He said: "It could only be used in those circumstances that 
are not convered by the Uruguay Round, and there are not many of 
those." 
  The European Commission vice president, widely praised for 
his deft handling of the bilateral talks with the United States, 
said that Brussels was pleased with the final package. "We have 
secured a major reduction in tariffs reinforced intellectual 
property rights, and created the WTO, which has substituted the 
rule of law for the law of the jungle," he said. 
  "In addition, we have secured a deal on agriculture that 
reinforces reform of the common agricultural policy but is still 
something everybody could live with." 
  Sir Leon remains hopeful that the kudos gained from helping 
to broker the GATT deal will win him support when the EU heads 
of state choose a successor to Jacques Delors in June. 
  To that extent he has been trying to woo friends in all 
parts 
of the Union. He has been providing limited backing for the 
French over the social clauses, yet accused Paris of "cutting 
off its nose to spite its face" when it threatened to refuse to 
sign the lucrative deal with the United States on public 
procurement unless the Germans dropped its case at the European 
Court over restrictions on importing bananas. 
  He also made it clear that the UK should understand the 
determination among its EU partners to press ahead with monetary 
union, adding that a single currency was still a possibility for 
a "critical mass" of countries by 1999. 
  Unlike Mr Sutherland, who said: "I have no ambition and nor 
am I a candidate for any other position," Sir Leon said that he 
wanted the top job in Brussels. 
  He said that he had no regrets about leaving British 
domestic 
politics. "At the time, I was uncertain about whether to take 
the job (as a European commissioner). Now it's difficult to 
imagine I could have been," he said.

"EU Impatience Over U.S.-Japan Dispute"] 
  [Text] Sir Leon Brittan, the European trade commissioner, 
warned yesterday that he would not wait much longer for the 
United States to show whether it was ready to pursue his 
proposal to involve the EU [European Union] in its talks with 
Tokyo on reducing the Japanese trade surplus. 
  He said in an interview that he would decide in the next few 
weeks whether the trilateral proposal had any future. That 
would depend partly on whether the Clinton Administration met EU 
requests to clarify the fundamental objectives of its trade 
policy towards Japan. 
  He also said that Mr Mickey Kantor, U.S. trade 
representative, had assured him this week for the first time 
that Washington accepted that the Uruguay Round world trade deal 
would substantially reduce U.S. scope to impose unilateral 
sanctions on other countries under its Super-301 trade 
provisions. 
  Sir Leon called the assurance "of very great significance." 
However, he said that U.S. insistence that it could still 
legally use Super-301 in some circumstances was "objectionable 
and unfortunate." 
  He was speaking ahead of a meeting between himself and Mr 
Tsutomu Hata, Japan's foreign minister. At that meeting Mr Hata 
apparently expressed reservations about the trilateral approach 
but assured Sir Leon that any agreement with the United States 
would be extended equally to the EU. Mr Hata was later due to 
meet Mr Kantor and U.S. Vice President Al Gore. 
  Sir Leon, who first suggested a trilateral initiative to 
tackle Japan's trade surplus earlier this year, said he wanted 
to resolve the matter quickly because his personal credibility 
was at stake. "I do not see that there is any useful purpose 
served by keeping it up in the air," he said. 
  He expressed impatience at the U.S. failure to explain 
clearly what it wanted from Japan. Mr Kantor had promised to 
give Brussels -- but had not delivered -- US papers prepared for 
the abortive meeting in February between President Bill Clinton 
and Mr Morihiro Hosokawa, then Japan's prime minister. The EU 
planned another effort to discover U.S. intentions soon. 
  If the trilateral proposal proved unworkable, the EU would 
feel free to criticise the U.S. publicly on issues such as 
attempts to set targets for a cut in Japan's bilateral surplus 
in specific sectors. Sir Leon said such targets were "very 
dangerous" and threatened EU interests. 
  Sir Leon also cast doubt on the prospects for an EU agreeing 
with the U.S. to free trade in telecommunications equipment. 
The two sides plan further talks after failing to conclude a 
deal as part of a package of bilateral measures to liberalise 
public procurement agreed here on Wednesday [13 April]. 
  He said he was "not really focusing" on telecommunications 
markets, which were mainly of interest to the United States. "I 
regarded the whole telecommunications issue as an obstacle 
rather than an opportunity (in the public procurement talks)," 
he said. 
  However, he said the procurement deal -- which he had not 
previously thought possible -- showed that the two sides could 
settle bilateral disputes.

  [Text] Frankfurt/Main (DDP/ADN) -- According to Foreign 
Minister Klaus Kinkel, Germany cannot at present promise 
Bundeswehr participation in a permanent UN reaction force. He 
holds the view that the wish of UN Secretary General Butrus 
Butrus-Ghali for a reaction force of this kind is "right in 
principle," Kinkel said today on Hessischer Rundfunk radio. At 
the moment it is the case that the United Nations always has to 
go begging when it is a question of getting troops for stemming 
or eliminating crises in troublespots. "We have told 
Butrus-Ghali that we support him on this matter in principle, 
but cannot participate at the moment," Kinkel stressed. He said 
he assumes that the Federal Constitutional Court will reach a 
decision in May or June. 
  It is a question of the Bundestag's being able to decide on 
each individual case for blue helmet or peacemaking measures, 
Kinkel said. However, he added that he adheres to his view that 
the culture of restraint shown by Germany in foreign and 
security policy since the World War II must be "retained at all 
costs." Thus Germany will "in the future say `no' far more 
often than `yes'" even after a decision has been made by the 
Federal Constitutional Court.

<F P=106> ["tl" report: "Kanther Calls On Industry To Take Better </F>
Protective Measures Against Espionage"] 
  [Excerpt] Bonn, 14 Apr -- FRG Interior Minister Manfred 
Kanther (Christian Democratic Union) has called on industry to 
make more intensive efforts against espionage. It suffers great 
damage if it does not protect itself against illegal spying, he 
said at the presentation of the 1993 Constitutional Protection 
Report in Bonn yesterday. 
  The FRG interior minister criticized with unusually harsh 
words the increasing activities of Eastern intelligence services 
in industrial espionage. It is "virtually crazy" that countries 
which have "nothing to eat" are spying on other people. This 
practice does not fit into friendly cooperation. 
  The best and most effective prevention of industrial 
espionage is, according to Kanther, the security check law, 
which has come into force these days. The recipient countries 
-- often states in the areas of crises in the Near and Middle 
East -- often use their intelligence services or other 
acquisition organizations, which work like intelligence 
services, to acquire illegally goods that are relevant for 
armament, the Constitutional Protection report says. The 
incorrect declaration of goods, the forging of end-user 
certificates, or the diversion of goods via third countries to 
cover up the true recipient are typical. The recipient 
countries of technologies, which are subject to export 
restrictions, also use their official or semiofficial 
representations in the FRG for illegal acquisition. For German 
companies it is not always clear, the report says, that their 
products are to be used for military purposes, in particular if 
they are not subject to export restrictions. 
  Another possibility to get access to protected technology or 
the corresponding know-how in Germany lies in the establishment 
or purchase of companies or the purchase of shares in German 
companies, the report adds. In particular smaller companies 
that are in economic difficulty could become the target of 
foreign intelligence services or similar organizations. 
Counterintelligence pointed to corresponding efforts by the 
Russian intelligence services already in the past. [passage

<F P=106> [Interview with President Mario Soares by Franz-Olivier </F>
Giesbert and Philippe Gelie; place and date not given] 
  [Excerpt] [passage omitted] 
  [LE FIGARO] What do you think is the priority: to 
strengthen Europe politically, or to enlarge the club of the 
Twelve? 
  [Soares] We must do both at the same time. 
  [LE FIGARO] Would not such change be too much of a shock for 
newcomers? 
  [Soares] Austria, Sweden, Norway, and Finland want to join 
the Union. Their motives are mostly economic. But we need to 
explain to them that enlargement without a renewed political 
structure is not a viable proposition. One of these days, 
Europe will fall apart unless it has a political structure and a 
real European constitution. We need European parties, European 
trade unions, etc. 
  [LE FIGARO] After taking in such countries, will it be 
necessary to rebalance the Union to the south, for instance by 
having Malta or Cyprus join in? 
  [Soares] Yes, I believe it is necessary. We shall also need 
to readjust eastward. 
  [LE FIGARO] Do you believe that Europe is taking too long in 
opening its doors to new Eastern democracies? 
  [Soares] Yes, without any doubt. I believe Europe has not 
proved bold enough, that its response to the perspectives that 
have opened has been completely inadequate. The Europe we built 
was one based on the divide between two blocs. Now that blocs 
have vanished, we cannot keep looking at Europe in the same 
light as before. 
  [LE FIGARO] How do you view Europe's attitude with respect 
to the Bosnian conflict? 
  [Soares] Europe has not progressed as far as external policy 
and defense are concerned. Institutionally, Europe has made no 
headway either. Bosnia is a good reason for us to speed up the 
construction of a real European political structure. 
  [LE FIGARO] Is not the Maastricht crisis behind us, now? 
  [Soares] Things have improved, no doubt about it. But 
everything remains to be done. One major problem is the fact 
that since Europe's inception, the driving force has been the 
Franco-German axis. What will become of this axis in the 
future? That is the question. There is no certainty that all 
difficulties have been overcome. 
  [LE FIGARO] What are you worried about? 
  [Soares] What will come out of the election in Germany? 
Chancellor Kohl has taken a major part in the European 
construction; he has always been strongly pro-European. He is a 
German of the West. We do not know whether his successors will 
share his European ideal. 
  [LE FIGARO] Doesn't Europe need a charismatic figure? 
  [Soares] Yes, I think so. You know, for years, all 
Europeans have tended to look at Mitterrand as the man who 
embodied this determination to build Europe. But Mitterrand is 
now reaching the end of his term.... 
  [LE FIGARO] Among Europe's other potentially troublesome 
neighbors are also North African countries, and especially 
Algeria. What turn do you expect things will take in Algeria? 
  [Soares] I do not see any short-term solution. 
  [LE FIGARO] Do you believe a military dictatorship can work 
toward the reestablishment of a civilian government in a few 
years' time? 
  [Soares] This can only be a temporary solution. 
  [LE FIGARO] There is the example of Turkey.... 
  [Soares] Turkey remains a problematic country, but true, 
things have not gone too awry there. 
  [LE FIGARO] Is Islam the West's new enemy, now that 
communism is dead? 
  [Soares] There are exponents of Islam with whom it is 
possible to talk. One cannot be satisfied with a simplistic 
vision of the problem; no attitude could be worse. There are 
positive forces within Islam. We must encourage and help them. 
One must never lose sight of the economic and social context in 
which Islam thrives. This is what fuels religious fundamentalism. 
  [LE FIGARO] Even in Saudi Arabia? 
  [Soares] We should not let Saudi Arabia remain the way it 
is, we should not let the people of Islam revert to archaic 
models. 
  [LE FIGARO] And still we do nothing about it.... 
  [Soares] The West does nothing about it; that is the West's 
mistake. If one wants to foster democracy, one cannot tolerate 
dictators. This is the contradiction at the core of the United 
States' policies, as well as Europe's, to a lesser extent. Take 
East Timor, which was annexed illegally by Indonesia after the 
1975 military invasion. We have been exerting pressure on the 
United Nations so that this island's right to self-determination 
may be recognized. This is a just cause. And yet, when we ask 
France or other European countries for help, we are faced with a 
wall of silence. Of course, Indonesia is a powerful country 
that purchases European goods. So we conveniently forget that 
it is a dictatorship. 
  [LE FIGARO] Is not your position somewhat inconsistent? 
On the one hand you advocate dialogue with Algeria's 
fundamentalists, and on the other you believe that we should 
interfere with Indonesia or Saudi Arabia's affairs -- hard-line 
regimes, to be sure, but without a civil war. 
  [Soares] No, they do not have a civil war, they are 
dictatorships. One must call a spade a spade -- and 
dictatorships are dictatorships. And one must not respect those 
as though they actually represent a people. I am quite 
sensitive to these things because I fought dictatorship in 
Portugal. And the Western world -- including England, the 
United States, and France -- used to consider that the 
Portuguese and Spanish dictators were acceptable because they 
were anticommunist. I believe there is no excuse for such an 
attitude if one wants to have a global human rights policy. 
  [LE FIGARO] After the Gulf war, there were aspirations to a 
new world order. Today, the dream has collapsed, has it not? 
  [Soares] It will re-emerge, it is inevitable. Because 
humankind's major problems know no border. Only a global policy 
will solve problems such as environment degradation or 
starvation. This is why we are necessarily headed for a global 
legal order, headed by a reformed United Nations organization. 
Living in a world where two-thirds of the population are 
starving is an untenable proposition. 
  [LE FIGARO] You know Africa well. Is it a lost continent? 
  [Soares] No. Africa is a continent that has gone adrift, 
but it is not lost. We have no overall policy with respect to 
this continent. 
  [LE FIGARO] Which is Africa's key country? 
  [Soares] As far as Sub-Saharan Africa is concerned, this is 
undoubtedly South Africa. If peaceful elections can be held 
there, then I think settlements can be found for peripheral 
conflicts -- in Angola, Mozambique, Zaire, etc. 
  [LE FIGARO] Do you think Mandela is the right man for the 
job? 
  [Soares] He has learned a great deal. He is a really wise 
man. 
  [LE FIGARO] Your trust in him is total? 
  [Soares] Yes I trust him. He is a moderate. He knows what 
the issues are, and he wants a peaceful way out for his country. 
He is prepared to make a number of vital concessions to avoid 
causing a panic among the population. 
  [LE FIGARO] All told, you are much more optimistic than most 
Western leaders.... 
  [Soares] I am optimistic inasmuch as I think we are going to 
rediscover a number of essential values. We shall finally 
realize that humankind's evolution does not solely hinge on 
interest rates and growth rates, but also on political and 
social values. That humankind must mobilize for ideas, not only 
for interests. And that notions of equality, fraternity, 
democracy, and human rights are the only ones likely to free 
humankind. We are still in a transitional phase. The end of 
totalitarian regimes constitutes a considerable improvement. 
This is important. If we feel the world has been going all 
wrong lately, it is also because of the hopes for an everlasting 
peace created by the collapse of communism.

<F P=106> [Salvador Enguix report: "Valencian PSOE Consolidates </F>
Renewalist Blueprint Proposed by Joan Lerma"] 
  [Excerpt] Valencia -- The seventh congress of the 
Valencian Socialists (PSPV-PSOE) ended in Cheste (Valencia) 
yesterday with majority support (79.3 percent of the votes in 
favor) for the sole list of candidates presented, led by 
Secretary General Joan Lerma. The congress consolidated the 
"blueprint for renewing and opening up the party" championed by 
Lerma with the inclusion of "new faces and new ideas" in the new 
Executive Committee. The fact that, contrary to what was 
expected, over 20 percent of the delegates abstained from voting 
for this Executive Committee was interpreted by Lerma as an 
expression of the fact that "in the face of the strong impetus 
for renewal being effected by the Valencian Socialists, there 
are people who still have their gaze set on the party, not 
society, and we will calmly surmount that opposition." In total, 
out of the 392 possible votes, 311 were in favor, 64 blank, and 
17 invalid. 
  Lerma, who also had the support of Economy Minister Pedro 
Solbes, who took part in the closing session, did not hesitate 
to describe the new Executive Committee as "an organization for 
the new times and new needs," and did not avoid references to 
corruption in his closing speech. In this connection, he stated 
that "it is the government that must lead the fight against 
corruption, and the response must be vigorous." Speaking with 
journalists, Lerma did not hesitate to interpret "the leftward 
shift" as "a demand that the progressive forces have a place in 
this party." [passage omitted]

  [Text] Tugay Ulucevik, Turkish Foreign Ministry deputy 
under secretary, has said that if the confidence-building 
measures [CBM's] package is restored to its initial content and 
if a balanced agreement is reached, this will grant benefits to 
the Turkish Cypriot people -- benefits they do not have at the 
moment. Ulucevik stressed that everything should not be assessed 
from the economic angle and that the Cyprus problem should not 
be seen as an economic problem only. He added that if the holes 
in the package are mended, the Turkish Cypriots will gain 
political benefits that are not easily discernible and that 
cannot be felt immediately. 
  Ulucevik met with Gustave Feissel, the UN secretary 
general's 
deputy special envoy in Cyprus, at the Turkish Embassy in 
Lefkosa [Nicosia] for three hours today. Turkish Ambassador 
Cahit Bayar was also present at the meeting. 
  In a long statement to the press after the meeting, Ulucevik 
said that there is nothing to fear or panic about and that the 
Turkish Cypriots have a strong position in the negotiation 
process -- a position they did not have for years. Be aware of 
this, he said, and rest assured; do not panic. 
  Ulucevik stressed that nobody can force the Turkish Cypriot 
people or Turkey to accept a solution, be it in the form of the 
CBM's or in the form of a comprehensive solution. He pointed 
out that in diplomacy, as in everyday life, no one can force 
someone else to accept something. A package or solution not 
accepted by the two sides will not be implemented, he said, 
adding that pressure will lead nowhere. 
  Ulucevik said: If the Turkish Cypriot people continue to 
defend their just cause at the negotiating table with wisdom, 
faith, and patience as they do now, there is nothing for them to 
worry about. 
  Ulucevik pointed out that government officials are working 
uninterruptedly in Ankara in connection with this issue. He 
said: Our aim is to help you and to reach the diplomatic circles 
you cannot reach. 
  Ulucevik stated that the Turkish Foreign Ministry was one of 
the first to point out that the present form of the CBM's is not 
the same as the initial package the UN secretary general asked 
the two sides to accept. With our intensive diplomatic efforts, 
he said, we want the just position of the Turkish Cypriots to be 
understood and not to force the Turkish Cypriots to compromise. 
  The Turkish Foreign Ministry official said that he discussed 
the CBM's in detail with Feissel for three hours. He went on to 
say that he told Feissel what the holes in the package were one 
by one and that he pointed out the differences between what is 
being said now and what was said before. 
  Ulucevik said that if an agreement is not reached by the end 
of April, that will not be the end of everything. In the course 
of the diplomacy, he said, an expectation was expressed in terms 
of a date, but that does not mean that the package will be 
forcibly imposed and implemented on that day. He said: You say 
it here; we say it in Ankara. If the holes in the package are 
mended, an agreement can be reached. If they are not mended, 
then everyone must stop and think. Those who made the holes in 
the package will have to be held responsible at that time. 
  Ulucevik said that there is nothing to panic about and that 
diplomacy is following its normal course. Nobody can force 
either the Turkish Cypriots or Turkey, he said, adding: Turkey 
in particular will not allow anyone to pressure you. 
  Replying to a question, Feissel said that he held a 
beneficial meeting with Ulucevik on the details of the CBM's. 
He said that it is possible that an agreement can be reached by 
the end of April but that he does not know if that will be the 
case. 
  Asked if the long meeting with Ulucevik on the details of 
the 
package means Denktas has been sidelined, Feissel said that this 
is not the case and that he will continue to meet with Denktas 
as well.

  [Text] The idea for an inter-Balkan conference for 
cooperation between the countries of the region after peace is 
established in the former Yugoslavia took up most of the time in 
today's talks between Foreign Minister Karolos Papoulias and new 
Yugoslavia Foreign Minister Vladislav Jovanovic. Following the 
meeting which lasted for three and a half hours, Papoulias said 
that Greece, together with Bulgaria and Romania, and with the 
support of Hungary and Ukraine, will issue a joint declaration 
to the United Nations calling for the lifting of the embargo 
against the former Yugoslavia. 
  Other issues examined in the Papoulias-Jovanovic meeting 
included the latest air strikes in Bosnia-Herzegovina and 
Greece's role within the framework of the European Union. 
Replying to correspondents' questions, Papoulias said that he 
will relay the ideas and thoughts discussed in today's meeting 
to Washington, and he stressed that Greece wishes to expand the 
efforts toward finding a solution to the Bosnian problem. 
  From his side, Yugoslav Foreign Minister Jovanovic thanked 
the Greek people for their support for the Serbs, and stressed 
that Greece is an important factor of stability in the region 
and that Greece's presidency of the European Union gives more 
importance to this issue. Asked about the message he wants 
Papoulias to relay to Washington, Jovanovic stressed that the 
Serbs ask from those who can exert influence that they deal with 
them as equals to the others because his people favor peace. He 
said that under the pressure of air strikes no one can discuss 
anything. In addition, Jovanovic said that the situation in 
Krajina is proceeding positively and stressed that he is against 
the phenomenon of [word indistinct] of military operations.

<F P=106> [Statement by Prime Minister Tansu Ciller upon her return </F>
from the United States at Ankara's Esenboga Airport on 18 April 
-- recorded] 
  [Text] As you know, I went to the United States on 13 
April to deliver a speech at the Elie Wiesel Foundation on the 
issue of human rights. That occasion offered me the opportunity 
to meet with President Clinton for close to an hour on 14 April. 
We discussed various issues. We discussed the issue of 
Bosnia-Herzegovina in detail and assessed the steps that can be 
taken by NATO. I also had the opportunity to explain in detail 
the fact that Armenians and Armenia have been occupying 
Azerbaijan. I pointed out that a similar approach must 
definitely be adopted in the Caucasus. 
  At the same time, I discussed in detail the measures we have 
taken to eliminate the bottleneck in which the Turkish economy 
finds itself. I can say very frankly that the U.S. 
Administration has given its full support to what we said and to 
the economic package. The U.S. Administration said that clearly. 
  In a meeting later with the World Bank, details of the 
economic package were discussed. I was happy to see that the 
World Bank clearly supports the economic program. This program 
involves a series of measures that must definitely be 
implemented to bring prosperity to our people. This program 
will bring prosperity to our people. It consists of a series of 
measures that we will implement ourselves, without the support 
of any financial organization. Nonetheless, we were happy to see 
the support given to it by the World Bank and later by the IMF. 
We were happy because they gave their full support. 
  We later met with Mr. Bentsen, secretary of the U.S. 
Treasury. He expressed similar views and support. 
  I then went from Washington back to New York, where I 
delivered a speech at the Elie Wiesel Foundation on the issue of 
human rights. We had the opportunity to stress to the whole 
world once again Turkey's dedication to human rights and to 
democracy. This reverberated throughout those circles. Our 
faith in democracy and in human rights may be interpreted 
differently at certain international platforms. It is 
beneficial for us to take every opportunity to show the truth 
and to stress and explain the Turkish people's dedication to 
democracy and to the struggle for human rights at different 
international platforms. 
  We also held a series of contacts with various U.S. 
financial 
institutions and banks. I was happy to see the renewed trust in 
Turkey and the extent of the support to be given its integration 
into world money markets. 
  In brief, our visit to the United States was positive in all 
aspects and was auspicious for our country.

  [Text] Paris, April 18 (AFP) -- French Foreign Minister 
Alain Juppe on Monday [18 April] called for talks between the 
United States, Russia, the European Union and the United Nations 
to reach a common position on Bosnia. 
  Juppe urged that a study group be set up by the four in 
Geneva in the next few days. 
  The French minister said the Moslem enclave of Gorazde, 
which 
was declared a safe haven by the United Nations, was now under 
Serbian control. His statement came as the town was under 
renewed heavy Serb shelling after tanks rolled into the enclave 
on Sunday. 
  Juppe added that France favoured "neither abandonment nor 
escalation." 
  He said the Geneva study group proposal aimed at defining a 
common approach to apply pressure jointly to relaunch peace 
negotiations.

Andrey Kozyrev on Thursday [14 April] welcomed a French proposal 
for relaunching peace negotiations on former Yugoslavia, the 
French Foreign Ministry said. 
  Spokesman Richard Duque said French Foreign Minister Alain

situation in the besieged Moslem enclave of Gorazde in Bosnia. 
  Kozyrev was "very positive" on a French proposal for a 
"partnership" of the European Union, Russia and the United 
States to restart the Bosnia peace conference, currently chaired 
by the EU [European Union] and the United Nations, Duque said. 
  Juppe also discussed a French draft resolution at the UN 
Security Council on Gorazde, demanding a ceasefire and 
deployment of UN peacekeepers in the enclave, the spokesman said.

  [Text] Paris, April 14 (AFP) -- France on Thursday [14 
April] condemned a ban on AGENCE FRANCE-PRESSE and CNN 
correspondents in Serbia and Montenegro and demanded the 
immediate cancellation of the measure. 
  Foreign Ministry spokesman Richard Duque said Belgrade's 
decision to withdraw press accreditation from AFP and CNN 
correspondents was "inadmissible," adding: "We demand the 
immediate cancellation of these measures." 
  U.S. State Department spokesman Michael McCurry said of the 
move Wednesday: "Our view of this, in short, is that it stinks. 
We deplore the Belgrade regime's disregard for the most basic 
internationally agreed principles protecting free speech and 
freedom of the press," said the spokesman. 
  The Yugoslav information ministry on Wednesday withdrew 
accreditations from AFP bureau chief Nicolas Miletitch and three 
other journalists to cover events in Serbia and Montenegro, but 
not for Serb-held areas of Croatia and Bosnia. 
  The AFP journalists whose accreditation was withdrawn can 
continue to coordinate coverage of events in Macedonia and 
Albania.

  [Text] Paris, April 14 (AFP) -- French Defence Minister 
Francois Leotard said on Thursday [14 April] that all 500 French 
paratroopers in Rwanda to help evacuate foreigners from the 
strife-torn Central African country would leave the capital by 
the end of the day. 
  Leotard told a press conference the men had helped 1,238 
people -- 454 of them French nationals -- flee the country, 
where thousands have died in a week of savage ethnic, political 
and criminal violence. 
  The bodies of two French soldiers killed in the fighting 
were 
flown home to France, Leotard said, along with the corpse of a 
woman and three French pilots killed in the plane crash a week 
ago in which the heads of state of both Rwanda and Burundi died. 
Their deaths triggered the current violence.

  [Excerpt] Strasbourg, April 14 (AFP) - Russian 
ultra-nationalist leader Vladimir Zhirinovskiy left for home on 
Thursday [14 April] complaining European parliamentarians had 
stolen his cap. 
  The navy blue seaman's cap, Zhirinovskiy's trademark, 
disappeared Wednesday night at a reception in the Council of 
Europe restaurant in honour of the assembly's new secretary 
general, Sweden's Daniel Tarschys. 
  In a communique, the Russian MP denounced "the moral level 
of 
European parliamentarians," but advised the thief to wait before 
selling the cap. 
  "The stock exchange quotation of my headgear will increase 
considerably in the near future," the communique said. 
  Zhirinovskiy also renewed his attacks against France "where 
there is no democracy," and against the Council of Europe, 
saying he would do his utmost to prevent the admission of Russia. 
  The Russian MP criticised the French for giving him a 
restricted visa limited to the city of Strasbourg and to the 
duration of the council's parliamentary spring session, and said 
he had no intention of coming back. [passage omitted]

<F P=106> [Report signed "G.N.": "Franco-African Conclave in Paris"] </F>
  [Text] The finance ministers of the 14 African countries 
of the CFA franc area are meeting in Paris today to assess the 
situation three months after the 50-percent devaluation of the 
CFA [African Financial Community] franc with French Economy 
Minister Edmond Alphandery and Cooperation Minister Michel 
Roussin. 
  This summit was preceded yesterday by a meeting of experts. 
The main subjects discussed were the continuation of the 
reorganization of public finances and economic recovery. 
  One source of optimism for the participants is that the 
international prices of raw materials, and especially cocoa, 
coffee, and rubber which are exported by these countries, have 
considerably strengthened since the beginning of the year. 
  "The franc area's financial backers will pay a total of 
around 24 billion French francs [Fr] this year -- including Fr5 
billion from France -- to help bring about economic recovery in 
these countries following the devaluation of the CFA franc," a 
senior French official said. This is a way of stating that 
France and the big international institutions are moving in the 
same direction. 
<H5>  Loans in CFA Francs </H5>
  Some people in Africa and France have openly condemned the 
attitude of the IMF and the World Bank, regarded as too strict 
because excessively theoretical. 
  Jean-Pierre Thomas (UDF [Union for French 
Democracy]-Vosges), 
keynote speaker on cooperation funds in the National Assembly's 
Finance Commission, thinks in particular that "a moratorium must 
be established on these countries' debts. They cannot do 
everything at once." 
  The keynote speaker also protested "the rumor that there 
might be a second devaluation." (Footnote) (A UN report 
published last January expressed the view that the effects of 
this devaluation would rapidly be canceled out by the resulting 
inflation.) To "halt" these rumors and to avoid discouraging 
the capital "which is starting to return to Africa," Mr. Thomas 
proposes that the loans of the French Development Fund (formerly 
the Central Fund for Economic Cooperation) to countries of the 
franc area should henceforth be paid in CFA francs. 
  The cooperation minister is in favor of that and could even 
suggest it today.

  [Text] [Excerpt] [passage omitted] No major decisions were 
made. The balance sheet was viewed as positive, although some 
questions are still pending, as [Economy] Minister Edmond 
Alphandery explained to Norbert Navarron: 
  [Begin recording] [Alphandery] Today's meeting reinforces 
our 
feeling that we are on the right track. Above all, we must not 
let our guard down, and I am very happy to see that all my 
colleagues, the finance ministers of the franc zone, are well 
aware of the need to continue making the effort, in particular 
with the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank and with 
France's support. 
  [Navarron] What matters still need to be settled urgently in 
the franc zone following the devaluation? 
  [Alphandery] There are matters to be looked at, and my 
colleagues noted in particular the problem of medical supplies, 
which greatly concerns them and it is a question that we are 
going to look at with them. 
  [Navarron] Does this mean that operational decisions will be 
made very quickly? 
  [Alphandery] Such decisions have already been made. We have 
not been idle. Mr Roussin [development minister] has, moreover, 
taken a great deal of trouble to follow the progression of 
events in all of the countries following the devaluation, and we 
are naturally continuing to follow the progression of events 
very closely. I would even say we are following events on a day 
to day basis in each of the countries. [end recording]

Mitterrand in Paris on Tuesday [12 April] evening, Latvian 
President Guntis Ulmanis expressed readiness for integration 
into the European Union [EU] and a willingness to implement EU 
requirements. However, Ulmanis stressed, Europe will have to 
rely more on Latvia in the integration process. 
  It is important that both Denmark and France are ready to 
discuss the issue of setting up a fund to support the closure of 
the Skrunda radar base and for the repatriation of Russian 
military pensioners to Russia, according to Martins Virsis, 
parliamentary secretary of the Latvian Ministry of Foreign 
Affairs. 
  Francois Mitterrand admitted during the talks that Latvias 
is 
a small nation but has a unique European culture. Europe is 
interested in preserving countries like that, Mitterrand said.

  [Text] Paris, April 14 (AFP) -- Air France will probably 
report a loss of eight billion to nine billion francs ($1.37 to 
1.54 billion) for 1993, French transport minister Bernard Bosson 
told the Senate on Thursday [14 April]. 
  He said the troubled airline would announce the figure 
"within a few days," adding that airline "officials informed the 
government after a substantial delay." 
  The most recent official forecast was for a loss of 7.5 
billion francs last year. 
  Bosson added that the government would grant 20 billion 
francs' worth of aid to the company in three installments over 
three years, "depending on concrete results" of the airline's 
recovery efforts. The first half (10 billion francs) will be 
paid after the European Commission in Brussels approves the 
company's restructuring plans, he said.

<F P=106> [Interview with Renault President Louis Schweitzer by Annie </F>
Kahn; place and date not given: "I Have Great Faith in the 
Shareholder's Rationality"] 
  [Text] Despite the drop in the automobile and heavy truck 
markets in France and Europe as a whole, Renault is showing a 
net profit of some 1 billion francs on a turnover of 
approximately 170 billion, a drop of 8 percent. The car 
manufacturer is therefore in a good position from which to look 
to a recovering 1994 market. In an interview with LE MONDE, 
Renault President Louis Schweitzer outlines his strategy in 
terms of alliances, cooperation, and international development. 
His leadership could be challenged on 31 May, date of the next 
Renault board of directors meeting, or at the time of 
privatization (postponed until after the presidential election). 
However, he has confidence in the "rationality" of his 
shareholders, who he believes will reach their decision based on 
industrial rather than political considerations. 
  [Kahn] In 1993, Renault continued to collect nearly 700 
million francs from the AMC transfer to Chrysler in 1987. 
Without that special revenue, would the automobile division 
still have shown a profit? 
  [Schweitzer] Absolutely. In contrast, the heavy truck branch 
was in the red. (Ed.'s Note: Renault Industrial Vehicles (RVI) 
lost 1.4 billion francs in 1993.) Furthermore, the positive 
balance sheet of the firm and the auto division includes 
provisions for reorganizational costs. 
  [Kahn] The financial result exceeds 500 million francs, 
while 
the figures were slightly in the red in 1992. What are the 
reasons behind that recovery? 
  [Schweitzer] It stems from the fact that we got out of debt, 
took advantage of the drop in interest rates, and made a number 
of positive transfers. 
  [Kahn] Did the Volvo sale impact the 1993 figures? 
  [Schweitzer] No. The Volvo operations took place in 1994. 
For 
the current fiscal year, the general outcome of the partnership, 
meaning the cancellation of joint participation and the sale of 
Volvo's shares in RVI for 4.5 billion, will have an impact on 
our own funds. The transfer of AB Volvo shares will also have an 
impact on our results. 
  [Kahn] There was an 8-percent drop in turnover in 1993. How 
is the outlook for 1994? 
  [Schweitzer] Orders picked up significantly during the first 
quarter, although turnover will not reflect it immediately 
because of the gap between the time of the order and 
manufacture. Nevertheless, there is a recovery thanks to the 
government's measures in France, but also targeting other 
European markets. We have a feeling of having hit bottom and are 
now revising our estimates upward. 
  [Kahn] In 1993, Renault profited from additions to its line 
with the Twingo, Safrane, and Laguna. Do you not risk being at a 
disadvantage during the recovery while facing increased 
competition from Citroen in the mid range and from PSA [Peugeot, 
Inc.] and Fiat on the "monospace" market? 
  [Schweitzer] We have no inferiority complex. The Laguna, 
which came out right after the Xantia, has exceeded our 
expectations in France and the rest of Europe, even Germany, 
where we are becoming a recognized builder over the entire range 
rather than just for small cars. At the top of the line, we have 
not yet convinced the Germans to "think French" when they want 
to buy a luxury car. 
  [Kahn] If there is a recovery, do you expect to stop laying 
off workers? 
  [Schweitzer] No. We are in it for the long haul. We want to 
manage the company's productivity in a consistent manner. It is 
better to avoid fits and starts so as not to disturb either the 
social climate or the smooth operation of the company. Using 
temporary workers, overtime, and partial layoffs give us 
short-term flexibility. 
  [Kahn] But are you not afraid that social conflicts will 
arise with the recovery? 
  [Schweitzer] Our men and women must be treated fairly. Since 
1985, Renault has cut its full-time personnel every year. I do 
not think that personnel cuts generate social movements. We see 
no such signs, but I cannot say we are safe from them either. 
  [Kahn] How will the postponement of Renault's privatization 
affect the company? 
  [Schweitzer] Renault's management will not change. Since 
1985, we have managed as a competitive enterprise in the private 
sector. We were ready for privatization and its postponement may 
generate a feeling of being on hold. We must make sure that the 
company concentrates on its business and its strategy, on what 
it basically does. I think that is possible because 
privatization is not a break. It is part of a process. 
  [Kahn] Renewal of your stewardship depends on two things: 
the 
next board of directors meeting on 31 May or privatization if 
you make it through the first. Does this not confront the 
company with yet another source of uncertainty? 
  [Schweitzer] This is absolutely typical of publicly-owned 
firms and is a phenomenon that is understood fairly well outside 
of France. I do not perceive any floating within the company. 
The controls continue to work well. 
  [Kahn] Your name has been mentioned in connection with the 
SNCF [French National Railroads]. 
  [Schweitzer] I read that in the newspaper, but no one has 
ever spoken to me about it! As a child, I loved electric trains, 
but if you want to know whether I prefer cars or trains, I am 
quite comfortable where I am! 
  I have great faith in the rationality of the shareholders. 
Their concern is to have a well-managed, well-directed Renault 
firm. They will judge the president of Renault on those criteria. 
  [Kahn] Imagine that you were in charge of privatization. 
Would you favor Matra's participation in Renault's stock or even 
absorption by Matra Automobile? 
  [Schweitzer] It is fitting and proper to have partners among 
our shareholders. It would be natural for Matra to own stock 
because we have a long and successful relationship with Matra 
Automobile that we have confirmed for many years. However, that 
relationship is all the better because Matra Automobile is 
independent of Renault. Otherwise, the larger company could 
bring the smaller one under its yoke. One great virtue of Matra 
is its flexibility, its capacity for innovation. That must be 
preserved. 
  [Kahn] Following the failure of the merger with Volvo, do 
you 
feel a need to look for another partner? 
  [Schweitzer] One must make a distinction between cooperation 
and partnership. All automobile builders engage in cooperation 
and it therefore seems obvious to me that Renault would maintain 
and develop it. 
  As far as heavy trucks are concerned, Renault VI must 
capitalize on the fact that along with Mercedes and Volvo, it is 
one of the three major heavy truck builders whose presence is 
felt across the Atlantic. Because of developments in engine 
technology, it is possible to work together with our American 
subsidiary Mack. It is the only builder of American trucks that 
makes its own engines. RVI must also develop other forms of 
cooperation. Should they lead to a partnership? That is an open 
question. 
  In the automobile industry, a partner is not a vital need. 
It 
can be an opportunity, as when BMW took over Rover. 
  [Kahn] Do you regret not grabbing it? 
  [Schweitzer] No. There was nothing in it for us. What Rover 
had to offer was British plants not even as good as Renault's 
and a bunch of models whose ability to complement Renault would 
be far from obvious! Nor would we have gained in technology 
because theirs is Japanese. The idea never even occurred to me! 
  [Kahn] Has there been talk of an agreement with Fiat? 
  [Schweitzer] That is not on my agenda, either in the case of 
cars or heavy trucks, in which case Iveco does not complement 
RVI. However, never say never! 
  [Kahn] In other words, you do not think that mergers are 
indispensable in the European auto industry? 
  [Schweitzer] I have always maintained that no such thing was 
inevitable. In certain areas, there are large-scale savings; in 
others, so-called losses. In the United States, GM has not 
systematically beaten Chrysler! Our flexibility, capacity for 
innovation, and organization mean that we can make the most of 
our "lightness." And we can be present everywhere along the line 
in market spots thanks to cooperation. If we wanted to build a 
4X4, we would not do it alone! 
  [Kahn] Don't you think that European builders risk being 
"sandwiched" in between the American and Japanese builders, who 
are truly "world class," which is not the case of the Europeans 
and particularly Renault? 
  [Schweitzer] I do not think that world-class cars are a 
success because the market is not homogeneous. The surcosts of 
the Mondeo (Ed.'s Note: Ford's international car) are greater 
than the savings created. It is vital to be everywhere in 
Europe, but it is not essential to have other support points, 
even if a presence outside of Europe is a plus. However, Japan 
and the United States are prohibitively expensive. We must try 
to develop on the markets of the future: Southeast Asia, Latin 
America, East Europe. 
  [Kahn] And yet, you have surrendered your majority 
participation in Colombia and Argentina. 
  [Schweitzer] We concluded that a local partner was more 
effective. One must deal with the unwieldiness inherent in big 
business. Experience has shown that such transfers have improved 
our sales and industrial operation locally. 
  [Kahn] What do you think the automobile industry will look 
like in 15 years? 
  [Schweitzer] I have ordered precisely such a study. There 
are 
two main schools of thought: one utilitarian and the other 
emotional. The former holds that in the long run, people will 
look at price and inside accessories and that their choice will 
be purely rational. Buying a car will be like buying a 
refrigerator. The second group thinks that style, anything 
having to do with the pleasure of buying an automobile, of 
making one feel good inside, will play an important role. I fit 
into the latter.

<F P=106> [Editorial by Charles Lambroschini: "Rwanda -- The New </F>
Barbarians"] 
  [Text] Rwanda is now in the clutches of horror. The only 
reason the Europeans and the Americans have been paying any 
attention, however, is that white soldiers have gone there to 
evacuate white expatriates under the gaze of television lights. 
Once the operation is over, viewers will forget quickly that the 
slaughter in the former Belgian colony is only one example of 
many others on the African Continent. 
  Ethnic cleansing is cause for scandal only in Yugoslavia. In 
Africa, it has become too commonplace to hold our attention 
beyond the first pictures of bloodshed and arson. In Liberia, 
Zaire, Angola, and Sudan the killing goes on every day. The 
Americans and their allies had made a great show of trying to 
save Somalia from starvation, only to leave in a hurry as soon 
as the military showcase turned into a real war. And that 
country reverted immediately to the law of the jungle. 
  As in precolonial times, entire regions seem to have 
vanished 
from the map. Diplomats and businessmen from the industrialized 
north are paying no attention to landlocked countries racked by 
tribal conflict and concentrate on coastal areas. This is a 
return to the bygone era of mercantilism. 
  Academic Jean-Christophe Ruffin compares the current 
situation with that faced by the Romans when, having destroyed 
Carthage, they were faced with a power vacuum. According to Mr. 
Ruffin, democracies deprived of their Communist foe since the 
collapse of the Soviet Union are now confronted by "new 
barbarians." 
  But Europe can ignore this historical upheaval no more than 
the Romans could. Because, under the combined blows of 
fundamentalists and the army, Algeria is sinking further into 
bloodshed every day; Marseille, Barcelona, and Palermo may soon 
be submerged by "boat people," as were Thailand, the 
Philippines, and Hong Kong when thousands of Vietnamese began 
fleeing their country's Communist regime. The rift is not 
limited to North Africa. The civilization of the Old Continent 
is being threatened by a large ring of instability: from the 
republics of the former USSR, in the throes of nationalist and 
religious conflicts; to Turkey, whose regime's legitimacy is 
being challenged both by Kurds and fundamentalists. 
  Mousy talk of human rights will not solve anything. Neither 
will the unabashed indifference of mercantile types, whose 
perspective on the world at large is restricted to market terms. 
A new solidarity must be invented to save the south while 
preserving the north. It is a paradox that the best way to 
maintain employment levels in industrialized nations is to 
create jobs in the Third World, through a distribution of tasks 
based on technology. 
  Unless an original strategy is implemented, no European 
border will be able to contain the invasion of the wretched 
hordes. Because, says Senegal President Abdou Diouf, "extending 
one's arms will not turn the tide."

<F P=106> [Editorial by Philippe Marcovici] </F>
  [Text] By wishing in Parliament yesterday that an 
international peace conference on Bosnia could be chaired by 
Europe on an equal footing with the United States, Russia, and 
the United Nations, Alain Juppe implicitly acknowledged that the 
European Union, and therefore also France, does no longer play a 
leading role in the peace process. 
  And yet, France has spared no effort to convince its -- 
wavering -- allies of the need for a tougher stand. It was 
France that made NATO decide to issue an ultimatum to the Serbs 
after the Sarajevo market square massacre. It was France's 
threats that achieved the reopening of Tuzla airport. It was 
France, also, that pushed twice for a warning strike against the 
Serbs in Gorazde. To the French Government, the use of force is 
not an end in itself, but a means to an end. The idea is to 
exert pressure on the warring factions to make them agree to 
reciprocal concessions at the negotiating table. In other words, 
the goal is to achieve peace through the use of weapons. 
  It is too early to tell whether this policy, adopted since 
the government change in France, is going to be successful. But 
its drawbacks are already apparent. Because France does not 
have the means to implement such a policy, whether alone or even 
with its European partners, it had to ask NATO's -- that is, 
America's -- help. Since Washington's major concern is to 
placate Moscow, Russia was able to make a dramatic entrance onto 
the Bosnian stage. This return to old-style East-West dialogue 
could only take place at the expense of Europe, and especially 
France, which for the last three years has shouldered the major 
part of the Yugoslav burden. Cruel paradox: The United States, 
which has no soldiers in Bosnia, has seized the political lead, 
whereas France, whose own soldiers are being killed, has lost 
the initiative. Yesterday, French diplomacy attempted to get 
out of this trap by proclaiming out loud that, without Europe, 
there cannot be a peaceful solution in Bosnia. True enough, but 
did the statement not come a little late in the day?

<F P=106> [Commentary by Johan Cuppens: "Ambitions Must Not Outstrip </F>
Means"] 
  [Text] The decision taken by the Belgian Government to 
close the Belgian Embassy in Kigali and recall Ambassador Johan 
Swinnen to Brussels is a wise one. After all, in a country that 
is at the mercy of the most nightmarish horrors and where 
nothing is certain any longer, the warring factions have equally 
scant regard for the conventions associated with diplomatic 
relations as they do for their fellow Rwandans' right to live. 
  But with the immediate, and justified, concern regarding 
several hundred Belgian nationals whose lives were threatened, 
and who had to suddenly drop everything and leave a country in 
which many of them had been giving of their best for many years, 
too little attention has probably been paid over the past few 
days to the plight of the local population. Indeed, no aircraft 
have been arranged to carry them off to some safer place. 
  The takeover of power by the Tutsi-dominated Rwandan 
Patriotic Front (RPF) does not mean that an end to the misery is 
in sight. The RPF has never bothered about human rights and 
democracy in the field and nobody believes that its leaders will 
suddenly change their tack in this respect. 
  This development is a cause for great concern. The fear is 
justified that the RPF ranks will in turn commit horrific acts 
of revenge, causing even greater bloodshed, this time Hutu 
blood. On the other hand, the stream of refugees that has 
formed over the past few days will continue to grow. This new, 
endless stream of refugees means that in the not-too-distant 
future, an entire region risks being completely disrupted, and 
new outbursts of ethnic violence are highly probable. 
  The unease in Belgian Government circles is just as real as 
the evacuation plans for the neighboring country, Burundi. The 
caution with which the government is reacting to such a 
catastrophic scenario is understandable. Hopefully it is not in 
for any nasty surprises and just like the rest of the 
international community, it will recognize the signals of a 
further change in good time and take action accordingly. 
  By deciding to close the embassy, the government has thrown 
in the towel. It is powerless and recognizes as much. At the 
same time, losing Rwanda marks the failure of a particular 
political approach. When Belgium considers where it stands in 
political terms, realism and pragmatism must be allotted a 
prominent role. The ambitions of a small country like Belgium 
must not outstrip its means. However, before it reasserts its 
presence, Belgium is entitled to demand guarantees from the 
Rwandan counterpart, not only regarding security, but also any 
joint action. However, so far things have been going rather 
wrong.

  [Text] Dutch Foreign Minister Peter Kooijmans has expressed 
concern at the capture in Bosnia of around 200 UN personnel. 
Among them are three Dutch nationals. They have been taken 
hostage by Serbs in actions following NATO air strikes against 
Serb positions near Gorazde. Mr. Kooijmans emphasized that the 
air strikes were in accordance with a UN resolution, and he 
called the Serb reaction completely unjustified.

<F P=106> [Report on interview with Foreign Minister Peter Kooijmans </F>
by unidentified correspondent in The Hague; date not given: 
"Kooijmans Is Reckoning With Kok as Prime Minister"] 
  [Text] The Hague -- Foreign Minister Peter Kooijmans of 
the CDA [Christian Democratic Appeal] believes that his party 
should deal with the idea that the PvdA [Labor Party] is 
becoming the biggest party and Wim Kok will become prime 
minister. "Kok is an exceptionally talented man. We must take 
account of the fact that the election results could turn out to 
be such that he becomes prime minister," Kooijmans said in an 
interview with the VRIJ NEDERLAND magazine. 
  "The CDA should not boycott a cabinet led by Kok," Kooijmans 
said. "It is reasonable that the Christian Democrats would then 
provide ministers for his cabinet," he said. "We must respect 
the views of the voters." 
  Kooijmans said "the cause of the CDA's big losses in the 
polls was the `neglect of inspiration from the bible.' I think 
that we did not emphasize the C in Christian enough," he said. 
"You are seeing that voters who long felt comfortable with the 
CDA are now running off. Everything has become too pragmatic. 
We must put that right." 
  Kooijmans said that "it could not be denied" that the former 
KVP [Catholic People's Party] supporters in particular no longer 
identified with the CDA. The merger of the KVP, ARP 
[Anti-Revolutionary Party], and CHU [Christian Historical Union] 
had not produced the unity aimed for.

  [Excerpts] The Serbs have again stepped up pressure in 
Bosnia: They have surrounded two UN installations near Sarajevo. 
Among those besieged, are some 30 French blue helmets. [passage 
omitted] 
  In Paris, Defense Minister Francois Leotard repeated his 
firm 
line. He spoke to Frederic Carbonne: 
  [Begin Leotard recording] We cannot accept this totally 
shocking attitude, which consists in attacking the United 
Nations through its UNPROFOR [UN Protection Force] 
representatives. It is not France that is being attacked in 
these actions, it is UNPROFOR. In other words, it is the UN 
Security Council resolutions, and we cannot accept that. 
  We are soldiers of peace, and our first concern is to be 
impartial in this conflict. We cannot accept this, and we have 
said so. This is the reason for our presence on the ground, and 
this is the reason behind the recent allied strikes against Serb 
targets. There will be others if such practices continue. We 
cannot, alas, rule anything out. We are very careful to keep up 
our role as a buffer force but, of course, there is a new 
tension. It is up to the diplomats and the soldiers on the 
ground to try to defuse that tension. We are not there to wage 
war on one of the parties, even though we see that one of them 
is today behaving in quite a shocking manner. [end recording]

  [Excerpts] The UN peacekeepers in Bosnia are becoming the 
scapegoats of the Serbs. In the suburbs of Sarajevo, French 
soldiers were surrounded this afternoon by Serb troops backed up 
by a tank. The peacekeepers were guarding an arsenal where 
heavy weapons, handed over by the Bosnian Serbs a month ago to 
avoid NATO air strikes, are stored. [passage omitted] France is 
refusing to allow the UN forces in Bosnia to be accused of 
partiality, but French Defense Minister Francois Leotard firmly 
maintains his position, replying to Frederic Carbone: 
  [Begin recording] [Leotard] There is indisputably a new kind 
of tension that has become apparent around Sarajevo following 
the air strikes by the allied aircraft on Gorazde, indisputably. 
This tension is bearing down on the French forces today, 
because we have many soldiers in Sarajevo today, and it 
manifests itself in many different ways. We are in the process 
of holding talks with the Serbs to ensure that the provocative 
attitudes, the refusals, the obstructions, disappear. 
  [Carbone] Are you not tempted to say to the Serbs: Enough is 
enough? 
  [Leotard] Yes, of course, when the allied aircraft carried 
out the air strikes on Gorazde this was indeed what we were 
saying, and France is of course participating in these 
operations, France is taking part in these observation flights, 
and some day you will perhaps also see, alas, operations of this 
kind that will be aimed at Serb targets if they continue with 
this unacceptable practice of insanely continuing with ethnic 
cleansing. [end recording]

  [Excerpt] Madrid, April 14 (AFP) -- UN Secretary General 
Butrus Butrus-Ghali said Thursday [14 April] he would "not 
hesitate" to ask NATO forces to carry out new air strikes if UN 
peacekeepers were endangered in ex-Yugoslavia. 
  The UN chief told a news conference: "We have the 
responsibility to protect the security of our United Nations 
troops in former Yugoslavia, and we will not hesitate to ask for 
an air support in case that the security of the United Nations 
forces, among which (are) Spanish troops, is in danger." 
  He spoke alongside Spanish Foreign Minister Javier Solana 
after arriving here late Wednesday from Germany for a three-day 
official visit. 
  Butrus-Ghali recalled that the UN Security Council had 
unanimously approved Resolution 836, which constitutes the legal 
basis for North Atlantic Treaty Organization air strikes.

<F P=106> [Unattributed article: "Netherlands UN Observer Missing in </F>
Bosnia"] 
  [Text] A Netherlands military UN observer who was stationed 
in the Muslim enclave of Zepa in eastern Bosnia has been missing 
since around 0007 GMT on Monday [11 April]. The soldier 
concerned is Air Force Major Van Baal. 
  Although all UN observers were supposed to stay inside due 
to 
possible revenge attacks by Bosnian Serbs after the NATO air 
strikes at Gorazde, Van Baal still went out on Monday morning. 
It is not clear why the major did not obey the instruction. 
Also it is not known why he set out with only two interpreters 
and not with one or more UN observers, as customary. 
  Defense Ministry spokesman in The Hague, Colonel F. Olivier, 
said [the Ministry] was "terribly concerned" about Van Baal's 
disappearance. Olivier said that he had only sketchy 
information. 
  The matter was being taken up at a high level in the United 
Nations, Olivier said. The highest civilian UN representative 
in the former Yugoslavia, Yasushi Akashi, was reported to have 
brought up Van Baal's disappearance yesterday during his talks 
in the Serbian stronghold of Pale.

Jeszenszky, were Italian Foreign Minister Beniamino Andreatta, 
and Swedish Foreign Minister Margaretha af Ugglas. 
  Our country will hold the presidency of the CSCE for one 
year 
beginning in 1995. The minority question was given special 
emphasis at today's meeting. The issues to be on the agenda of 
the security conference in Paris in May were reviewed and 
agreed. In this regard, the CSCE had earlier taken a unified 
stance; the work of the high commissioner for minorities will 
still be supported, the reports of those in charge of monitoring 
minority affairs will be continuously processed, and the agenda 
of the Balladur conference will be shaped from the conclusions 
which are drawn. 
  The foreign ministers consider it desirable that Latvia and 
Russia should agree at the presidential level on improving 
relations between their countries, and they welcome the 
agreement reached on the withdrawal of Russian troops and the 
Skrunda radar station, but they consider it desirable that these 
agreements should come into force as soon as possible. A 
similar agreement must take effect between Russia and Estonia 
too, because the Russian troops stationed in the Baltics are 
currently present as a destabilizing factor in Europe. 
  The foreign ministers reviewed the most recent developments 
in the southern Slav crisis. 
  U.S. President Bill Clinton will also attend the CSCE summit 
in Budapest in December, the foreign ministers confirmed.

  [Text] Belgium is withdrawing its blue helmets from Rwanda. 
This has just been decided by the Council of Ministers. The 
government will however consult with the United Nations about 
the practical implementation of that decision. 
  The Council of Ministers judges that the UN mission in 
Rwanda 
has become pointless. Because of the recent dramatic events, 
the peace and democatization process in Rwanda has come to an 
end. That is why the government urges the suspension of the UN 
mandate. Moreover, the anti-Belgian witch-hunt makes the work of 
the blue helmets impossible, the Council of Ministers argues.

  [Excerpts] [passage omitted] At a restricted cabinet 
meeting this afternoon, the political green light for the 
withdrawal of the Belgian UN soldiers from Rwanda was confirmed, 
despite the fact that the UN Security Council met last night but 
did not come to a decision on that issue. Foreign Minister 
Willy Claes explained to the press this afternoon that, despite 
the fact that the Security Council has not made an official 
decision on the desire of the Belgians to withdraw from UNAMIR 
[UN Mission in Rwanda], its members have told the Belgian 
Government that they acknowledge and fully understand the 
Belgian decision. For Willy Claes, it is important to act 
quickly. We do not have any time, he said. Listen to him. He 
spoke to Gerard de Saigne: 
  [Begin recording] [de Saigne] I would like to ask you two 
questions. The first one is this: You said that we do not have 
any time. But why so much haste? The second: Have there been 
any precedents.... 
  [Claes, interrupting] I do not understand your first 
question. 
  [de Saigne] You said that we do not have any time to 
repatriate our troops. This means that it is important to act 
quickly. I am asking you: Why so much haste? Why so fast? Why 
right now? 
  [Claes] I still do not understand your first question. What 
do you mean? 
  [de Saigne] You said: We do not have any time. This means 
that we have to act quickly. Why do you want to repatriate our 
troops so fast? Is it not clear? 
  [Claes] If I understand you, you are saying: Stay a bit 
longer. 
  [de Saigne] I am not saying that. I am asking you why. 
  [Claes] You are intimating.... 
  [de Saigne, interrupting] I am not intimating anything. I am 
asking a clear question. 
  [Claes] For me, it is not clear because I have already 
explained four times why. I did not speak in double Dutch, but 
I will have to explain things once more for your benefit. 
  Chaos is increasing by the minute in Kigali and in the rest 
of the country. Since yesterday -- and a colleague of yours 
showed it in pictures -- the Rwandan Armed Forces have even been 
using the most modern multiple rocket launchers. This means 
that, any moment now, even the airport runway, which is 
considered as the most strategic point in the whole country, is 
in danger of being destroyed. 
  If you want your troops to have an unthinkable fate -- they 
are like rats in a trap -- it is your responsibility. We will 
not accept it. Moreover, I would like to remind you that the 
anti-Belgian climate has meant that the UN soldiers have been 
running extra risks for several days now. The others do not 
seem to be running these risks for the time being. We even have 
information from reliable sources according to which the Rwandan 
Armed Forces are getting ready to attack the Belgian UN soldiers 
as soon as the Belgian paratroopers leave. [end recording] 
[passage omitted] 
  An increasing number of refugees are flocking to the border 
countries, including Zaire. About 1,000 of them are stuck at 
the Zairean border at the moment, since the Rwandan authorities 
have decided to close that border. Many of these refugees are 
Tutsis.

  [Text] The decision has therefore been made, and a 
timetable more or less set. The Belgian blue helmets will leave 
Rwanda, but not before Tuesday [19 April], to give Ghana time to 
relieve them. Earlier this morning, Jacqueline Pollack spoke to 
Colonel Gilbert Hertog, spokesman of the Defense Information 
Service: 
  [Begin recording] [Hertog] The Belgian unit which is 
currently at the airport is preparing its final return to 
Belgium. 
  [Pollack] You said yesterday that the blue helmets would 
leave Kigali at the beginning of the week. What day does this 
mean? 
  [Hertog] It is difficult to say exactly when they will 
leave. They will leave as soon as possible, but without undue 
haste. In the context of the UN peacekeeping operation in 
Rwanda, the unit will be relieved tomorrow by the Ghanaians. In 
principle, they will begin their withdrawal on Tuesday at the 
earliest. 
  [Pollack] Once they have begun to leave how long will it 
take 
them to pull out of Rwanda? 
  [Hertog] We expect it will take about 12 hours to leave 
Rwandan territory. [end recording] 
  The blue helmets will be evacuated overland toward Tanzania. 
They will leave by road because this enables the whole 
contingent to depart together, and at less expense, the Defense 
Information Service explained yesterday. About 100 refugees 
will be accompanying the Belgian blue helmets, mostly Europeans. 
The Belgians and the United Nations have therefore come to an 
agreement. The political decision to pull out comes from 
Brussels, but the military order comes from New York. We spoke 
to Foreign Minister Willy Claes: 
  [Begin Claes recording] The general in charge of military 
operations at the United Nations in New York has asked Canadian 
General Dallaire, the UN commander in Kigali, to give the 
Belgian blue helmets the military order to evacuate Rwandan 
territory. In other words, it is not our Belgian Lieutenant 
General Charlier who is giving the blue helmets the order, but 
the UN command ordering the blue helmets, who happen to be 
Belgian, to pull out. [end recording]

  [Text] Belgian Foreign Minister Willy Claes suspects 
hardline Hutus, opposed to power sharing with Rwanda's Tutsi 
minority, were responsible for the rocket attack that killed the 
presidents of Rwanda and Burundi. Mr. Claes earlier announced 
Belgium is withdrawing its blue helmets from Rwanda. I asked 
him what he thought should now happen to the United Nations 
forces in Rwanda. 
  [Begin Claes recording] It depends on the decision of the 
Security Council, of course, but I think that the opinion of the 
Belgian Government, on the base concrete and pragmatical 
elements we have obtained in Rwanda, is very clear. There is no 
longer any reason to maintain UN troops which were sent in order 
to stimulate the peace process of Arusha on the moment that a 
civil war is in the country. So we think that it would be wise 
to follow the decision taken by the United Nations in Angola. 
That means that, at the moment that a civil war started once 
again in Angola, the mission was suspended, but that an 
important unity was maintained in the country in order to 
promote cease-fire and to try to create the conditions necessary 
in order to restart the peace process. [end recording]

<F P=106> [Commentary by Ralf Falter: "Costs and Benefits"] </F>
  [Text] Every day the Belgian Government and Army leaders 
are having to make dramatic and sometimes historic decisions 
about Rwanda. Should the UN formalities be awaited before 
withdrawing the Belgian UN troops from the destroyed country? 
Can violence be used to prevent Kigali airport being fired 
upon? What should be done with the now thousands of Rwandans 
wanting to leave and what procedure will be used to select who 
is allowed to come along? As the departure of the last aircraft 
from Kigali airport approaches, the tempo of such decisions 
increases. 
  One of the difficult political decisions concerns the 
Belgian 
UN troops. Foreign Minister Willy Claes has said that "they 
will not stay in Rwanda under any circumstances." In concrete 
terms, that means that they will fly back with the paratroopers 
who were there to help the refugees. Does that also mean: 
without procrastination? Yesterday the ambiguity on the 
subject had not been fully cleared up. The army had received no 
formal order to withdraw the UN troops. 
  That could simply be because the government wants to show 
consideration for the United Nations for as long as possible. 
Something similar happened during the decolonization of the 
Congo in 1960. The delay of the evacuation yesterday also makes 
it possible to keep up the appearance that the UN troops will 
only depart after a decision by the Security Council. But even 
if New York should decide against the departure of the UN 
troops, Belgium may not delay. The safety of its soldiers, who 
can do nothing more on the ground, weighs heavier than the 
limited loss of face of UN representatives or even African 
political leaders' fears of the destabilization of Central 
Africa. To prevent that, some 400 UN troops are certainly not 
enough. 
  But the UN chapter will not be closed with the evacuation of 
the 2nd Commando Battalion, which made up the bulk of the 
Belgian UN troops in Rwanda. It is insufficient to just ask the 
United Nations to investigate the murder of the 10 Belgian UN 
soldiers last Thursday [7 April]? In New York, it will become 
one of the many cases for which there will never be time. 
  An internal investigation to see whether errors were made, 
is 
also necessary. Given that it is now known the murders took 
place on Thursday morning, fairly soon after the attack on the 
Rwandan and Burundian presidents, then it is becoming clear that 
there was very little time for a new assessment of the 
situation. This makes a flagrant error unlikely. But that does 
not make an investigation superfluous, even if only because very 
many questions and much discontent remain in the paratroop 
battalion concerned. 
  A total assessment of the role and above all the 
vulnerability of the UN troops is necessary in any case, not 
just in the United Nations, but also within the Belgian 
Government. Six Belgian UN soldiers died in Somalia. They 
carried out useful work, but it now appears that little remains 
of it. In Bosnia yesterday, the conflict escalated to such a 
point that more than 15 UN troops were taken hostage by the 
Bosnian Serbs in spite of all the stepped-up arms and NATO 
threats. 
  To put it soberly, the costs of UN operations are starting 
to 
outweigh the benefits. Belgium, which has cooperated very 
generously with the peace forces but then paid a relatively high 
price, can no longer put up with any indecisiveness or 
bureaucratic inertia in New York. If the United Nations does 
not make its own military apparatus more efficient, something 
for which our country has already made a large number of 
suggestions, then we would do better to pass from now on.

<F P=106> [Commentary by Christophe Lamfalussy: "A Dangerous </F>
Precedent"] 
  [Text] How can we fail to be touched and moved by the tears 
of the families who watched on Thursday [14 April] as 10 coffins 
returned from Rwanda, containing the bodies of our UN troops 
murdered in such a cowardly way in Kigali? 
  Emotions are running high. This is entirely legitimate. The 
politicians have felt the wind change, those who called for all 
Belgian UN troops to be pulled out of Rwanda. Under these 
conditions, it is not easy to press home a contrary point of 
view. However, the decision made by the Belgian Government, 
confirmed Thursday by Foreign Minister Willy Claes, begets two 
thoughts. 
  The first is that it is not very diplomatic to force any 
decision which is up to the Security Council. The 430 Belgian 
soldiers are serving under the UN banner within an international 
force. 
  Second, a withdrawal ascribed to the deaths of men would 
create a dangerous precedent. Who would then not be tempted to 
lay into UN troops if there was any certainty that they would 
withdraw under pressure of their public opinion? We have more 
than 1,000 soldiers in the former Yugoslavia, and tensions are 
running high. 
  Nonetheless, the murder of our soldiers in Rwanda raises a 
much larger question concerning the UN mandate. The famous duty 
to interfere, a product of 1980's humanism, no longer holds 
water. 
  The countries of the West agreed to keep the peace and 
manage 
the provision of humanitarian aid, but not to impose peace by 
force. For the first time, Belgium is recognizing this 
impotence, which is leading it to wash its hands of the drama in 
Rwanda. So the message being received by the African people is 
one laden with extremely serious consequences.

  [Text] Rome, April 16 (AFP) -- Prime Minister Carlo Azeglio 
Ciampi handed in his resignation to President Oscar Luigi 
Scalfaro on Saturday [16 April], the premier's office announced. 
  Ciampi, 73, said last week he was ready to resign after the 
March 27-28 general election but would do so only after the 
election of the speakers of the upper and lower houses of 
parliament. Politicians from the right-wing Freedom Alliance 
[Carlo Scognamiglio and Irene Pivetti respectively] were voted 
into the posts earlier Saturday.

  [Excerpts] Yesterday, the battle for the posts of 
parliamentary speakers was shown live on television. Today, 
work is already under way to form a new government. According 
to Forza Italia leader Silvio Berlusconi it will be ready by the 
end of the month. 
  Outgoing Prime Minister Carlo Azeglio Ciampi has sent a 
cable 
to former speakers Giovanni Spadolini and Giorgio Napolitano to 
thank them on behalf of the government for their complete 
impartiality and for their deep understanding of the state -- 
Ciampi wrote -- with which they have ensured that parliamentary 
work has made good progress. He also stressed the correctness 
of the constitutional relationship between the government and 
the parties of the opposition. [passage omitted] 
  President Oscar Luigi Scalfaro will start to hold 
consultations to form a government on Thursday 21 April. The 
new prime minister is almost certain to be appointed after 25 
April. [passage omitted] 
  In the Senate the problem of a too slender majority remains 
for Berlusconi. It is a problem of numbers, but above all it is 
a political problem. For this reason Berlusconi has adopted a 
strategy of focusing on the center. He has denied buying votes 
[in yesterday's parliamentary speakers elections]: Our majority 
has shown that it is concrete, but needs to be widened. The 
message was aimed at the PPI [Italian People's Party]. Nicola 
Mancino, [outgoing interior minister and newly appointed PPI 
spokesperson in the Chamber of Deputies, [PPI deputy Rosy] 
Bindi, and [PPI chairperson] Jervolino have said that he will 
never get their votes, but Berlusconi knows that other members 
of the PPI are less extreme and he is waiting.

  [Text] Tomorrow sees the start of an important political 
week. We will see the new parliament's first steps and the first 
moves toward the formation of a new government. We will also 
see the formation of the parliamentary political groupings and 
at the same time, we will also surely see the first contacts 
aimed at increasing a government majority that could come under 
pressure in the Senate. Mario De Scalzi reports: 
  [Begin De Scalzi recording] Now that the speakers of the 
Chamber of Deputies and the Senate have been installed -- even 
at the price of an exhausting fight with the opposition parties 
-- the Freedom Alliance is now getting ready for the next round. 
Now it is the government's turn, but there is still caution 
concerning the time and modality of its formation. Silvio 
Berlusconi is asking for time in order to, as he puts it, get a 
good team together. He makes no secret of the fact that he 
would like to hold his hand out to Mino Martinazzoli's and Mario 
Segni's Italian Popular Party, even if the signals coming out of 
the party headquarters are not encouraging. 
  As a sign of peace, Pierferdinando Casini [from the 
Christian 
Democratic Center] is proposing to offer the former Christian 
Democrats the chairmanship of certain parliamentary committees, 
which would have otherwise gone to the Freedom Alliance. 
  Umberto Bossi has called a meeting of the Northern League's 
Federal Committee for tomorrow, and it was for this reason, he 
said, that government negotiations could not start before 
Tuesday. Gianfranco Fini is remaining calm, and he has given the 
go-ahead to the candidacy of Silvio Berlusconi for the post of 
prime minister. 
  Of course, President Oscar Luigi Scalfaro will have the last 
word, and as yet there is no word concerning when the 
appointment of the new prime minister will be made. However, it 
cannot be ruled out that the time limits for the formation of 
the new government could be conditioned by the date of 25 April 
[Liberation Day], which the National Alliance proposes to be 
celebrated as a day of national reconciliation, but which for 
the radical left remains the celebaration of the victory of the 
resistance over the fascists. [end recording]

  [Text] Silvio Berlusconi has once again invited the PPI 
[Italian People's Party] to talks. Berlusconi said: I would be 
happy if a political force we have always looked to, and with a 
program very close to our own, accepted to sit down at a table 
with us to find out what we could do together in parliament. 
Berlusconi added: I do not even rule out a possible government 
pact. 
  Rocco Buttiglione lost no time in replying. He said that he 
appreciated Berlusconi's opening out toward them, but added: I 
cannot understand why the invitation to talks should concern 
only the matter of the Senate speaker and not the speaker of the 
Chamber of Deputies as well. 
  [National Alliance leader] Gianfranco Fini has said no to 
any 
talks. The National Alliance leader commented: I cannot 
imagine a government involving the PPI and Forza Italia.

  [Text] "A government cannot govern if its policies are not 
accepted in both chambers of parliament. Were that to happen, 
there would be no other solution than to go back to the 
electorate with a majority that would be confirmed and 
strengthened by the experience. I hope this does not prove 
necessary." Silvio Berlusconi has thus added his voice to those 
who think there might be a new general election if Giovanni 
Spadolini were to win. 
  Earlier the Northern League's Roberto Maroni had warned: We 
will have another general election and "we will say that the PDS 
[Democratic Party of the Left] and the PPI [Italian Popular 
Party] were in cahoots to bring the institutions to a standstill 
and we will ask the nation for greater power."

  [Excerpts] [Passage omitted] A general election has been 
threatened in the event of the government majority not 
controlling both the Senate and the Chamber of Deputies. This 
morning, President Oscar Luigi Scalfaro commented on this. 
  [Unidentified correspondent] To threaten to partially or 
completely dissolve parliament would be a serious error because 
it would impinge on the head of state's legal competence. This 
is how the president's office has replied to members of the 
majority parties who stressed the problems the new government 
would have if there were two different majorities in the two 
chambers of parliament. In the face of this criticism, Forza 
Italia leader Silvio Berlusconi has sought to clarify his 
position: 
  [Begin Berlusconi recording] I said that it was clear that 
in 
order for a government to govern it must have the two chambers 
of parliament on its side. If the situation were to arise in 
one of the two chambers where a majority close to the government 
could not be found, it would be impossible to govern. [end 
recording] 
  According to the Northern League's Roberto Maroni, who has 
made the same points as Berlusconi, the presidency has not 
understood the gist of his argument. He has denied threatening 
to dissolve parliament. 
  Christian Democratic Center party leader Pierferdinando 
Casinis said his were only political observations. 
  For the Progressive Alliance, Achille Occhetto [Democratic 
Party of the Left leader] commented: 
  [Begin Occhetto recording] I think it was his duty. The head 
of state has simply said that only he and no one else can 
dissolve parliament. [end recording] [passage omitted]

<F P=106> [Report by Alessandra Longo: "That League Member is an </F>
Anti-Semite'"] 
  [Text] Rome -- As soon as the news spread, she herself 
said: "Me, speaker of the chamber of deputies? We are in the 
Lord's hands...." This was yesterday afternoon, at Montecitorio 
[Chamber of Deputies]. A somewhat flustered Irene Pivetti, 
Giorgio Napolitano's [outgoing lower house Speaker] purported 
successor, was giving the first interviews -- surely a great day 
for her, the day when the development of new events was granting 
the soap opera a place in history: 31 years old, a Catholic 
fundamentalist, first-time deputy in 1992. Here was League 
member Pivetti suddenly being raised to the highest seat, that 
of the speaker of the Chamber of Deputies. A meteoric, 
irresistible career in the second legislature. 
  Yet, some people were spoiling the party, not with the usual 
behind-the-scenes teasing and vulgarity, but with a sensitive, 
specific, extremely serious accusation: "Pivetti is an 
anti-Semite." It was being said by [Radical leader] Marco 
Pannella (who identified "anti-Semitic accents" in the newly 
nominated speaker); it was being said by [Forza Italia Deputy] 
Marco Taradash, "documents at hand"; it was being denounced by 
Democratic Alliance [AD] Republican member Luciana Sbarbati 
("among Pivetti's virtues, there is also anti-Semitism"); it was 
being asserted, indirectly, by progressive list deputies Sandra 
Bonsanti, Miriam Mafai, Luigi Manconi, and Giovanna Melandri, 
who were accusing her of fostering "a fundamentalist and 
intolerant idea of the relationship bewteen different religious 
denominations." 
  A rather unpleasant matter, on the eve of such an important 
appointment. The Jewish Youth Federation also voiced its 
protest. Suddenly, the smile on the face of Irene Pivetti, the 
"evil nun," as she is called by Michele Serra, turned into a 
grimace of annoyance and concern. The journalists pressed her, 
she had to give an answer: "Me, an anti-Semite? Political 
maneuvering, nonsense. Religion pervades my life, but it will 
not interfere in the least with my role as lower house speaker, 
which I intend to fulfill with the utmost sense of 
responsibility, giving assurances to all those involved." 
  In the meantime, her accusers did not let up, making 
remarks, 
statements, taking up positions. What did Irene Pivetti write 
in November 1992, following a raid in Rome against a number of 
Jewish-owned shops, which were branded with the star of David? 
That the events had been exaggerated for political reasons: "A 
roll of adhesive tape, a few sheets of paper with the Star of 
David printed on them, stuck on the shopwindows of a few Jewish 
shopkeepers...." Why "blow the racist hot air balloon out of all 
proportion?" In CORRIERE DELLA SERA, a concerned [journalist] 
Arrigo Levi cited the soon-to-be house speaker's analysis: "In 
our country, since the postwar period, Pivetti writes, Jews have 
always been able to preserve that racial, religious, and 
cultural minority's identity which they so treasure: marrying 
only among themselves (if practicing), considering themselves a 
people chosen by God, extending their considerable economic, 
intellectual, and political influence within the community...." 
  Among the spoilsports, Marco Taradash brought up an old 
question: Did his deputy colleague remember referring to a 
"Jewish Freemasonry" in relation to a list of Italian citizens 
who were considered anti-Semites, a list in which she was 
herself included, "in black and white?" No, in response to this 
specific question, the deputy said she did not remember: "Did I 
speak of a Jewish Freemasonry? One should look at the 
context...." 
  That would be enough to make anyone's nerves crack, but not 
those of Napolitano's successor -- icy stare, Vandee 
[18th-century Catholic monarchist opposition to French 
revolutionary forces] cross round her neck. Speaker of the 
house at 31, with Forza Italia's and National Alliance's [AN] 
blessing; she, Algo Bagrielli's granddaughter, curator of her 
grandfather's dictionary; she, CEI [Italian Bishops' Conference] 
and Ruini's passionate enemy; she, the bandwagon's [League 
nickname] runaway horse, that only [League secretary] Bossi can 
rein in ("I owe him everything, I owe him the fact that I 
engaged in politics, I would never criticize his decisions....") 
-- she is just one step away from a miracle; we will see what 
happens today. 
  What can she do if journalists insist on this anti-Semitism 
story. The deputy goes her way and, " knife in mouth" (one of 
her expressions), upholds her ideas. She tore to bits Law 194 
on abortion ("but it is a state law and must be implemented, 
particularly the part fostering contraception"); had something 
conceited to say about [Forza Italia leader] Berlusconi 9 
[outgoing lower house Speaker] ("a lucky man, who is also 
showing he is a good politician"); drew a distinction when it 
came to the latter's TV networks ("He cannot get rid of them in 
15 days. The essential thing is that he serve the country's 
interests"); made a noncommital remark about Mussolini, in line 
with an irrepressible instinct for appeasement ("whether for 
better or worse, he made part of this country's history"). 
<H5>  Ironical Colleagues Consider Her a "Doll" </H5>
  Here are some reactions to League Catholic member Irene 
Pivetti's nomination as speaker of the lower house: Alfredo 
Biondi (Center Union): "Me, deputy speaker? With a speaker who 
is not absolutely below standard, in fact with a high-quality 
one, I might agree. I am thinking of Iotti, Napolitano, or 
Rodota, but I have no intention of being an employee, a civil 
servant, giving lessons to kids or...dolls." Later Biondi 
explained that he was joking with some friends when a journalist 
overheard these comments and published them. 
  Massimo Scalia (Greens): "For thousands of years we Romans 
have been used to tolerance and to history's vicissitudes. Ever 
since Caligula nominated a horse as senator, nothing surprises 
us any more." 
  Rocco Buttiglione (Italian Popular Party): "I am very much 
in favor. It will raise the institutions' esthetic standards. 
It will help us bear the incredible boring sessions in store 
for us. This, however, is not enough to become the speaker of 
the house. I am very much afraid I cannot give her my vote." 
  Vittorio Sgarbi (Forza Italia): "Pivetti for speaker of the 
house? I would also have nominated her. I cannot imagine a 
more representative and appropriate personality: We move from 
the contemplation of the Madonna [reference to President 
Scalfaro's frequent references to the Virgin Mary] to the 
Madonna herself."

<F P=106> [Interview with Northern League Deputy Irene Pivetti by </F>
unidentified correspondent; place and date not given: "Irene 
Defends Herself: Me, Anti-Semite? Nonsense, I Am Only a Little 
Khomeyni-ist" -- first two paragraphs are IL MESSAGGERO 
introduction] 
  [Text] "I am very outspoken," Irene Pivetti said in April 
1992, a few days after landing in parliament thanks to 3,272 
votes. She has confirmed this in every way. As a strong 
Catholic, previously a member of FUCI [Italian Catholic 
University Federation] and ACLI [Christian Association of 
Italian Workers] in Milan, director of the monthly IDENTITA, and 
the president of the Northern League's Catholic Advisory Council 
[Consulta], Irene Pivetti has never been soft with anybody. She 
has attacked the Pope: "He must not meddle in politics." She 
has fired broadsides against Cardinal Martini of Milan: "He 
interferes unduly." Once she even yelled at the great head of 
the Northern League Bossi: "He is too much of a planner." 
Today, she is one step away from the speakership of 
Montecitorio [lower house]. And if she succeeds, at age 31 she 
will be the youngest speaker in the history of the republic or 
nonrepublic. 
  Pivetti speaks four languages including Russian, has been 
married for six years, and admits that "a hard boiled egg is the 
only thing she knows how to cook": She does not want to be 
defined as being the Northern League Joan of Arc ("she is a 
saint, I am not") or a pasionaria ("I am not"), but a 
Khomeyini-ist, yes: "At times, in fact, I am a little rigid." 
And it is precisly this intolerance that the Radicals and 
Progressives are now denouncing. 
  [Correspondent] Deputy Pivetti, you have been accused of 
anti-Semitism. 
  [Pivetti] This is nonsense. I cannot be accused of 
anti-Semitism, I have the utmost respect for diversity. 
However, I have never made any secret of the fact that I am a 
Catholic. Rather, my religion permeates my personality, but I 
can assure that this will in no way interfere with the role of 
guarantor that I will have to fulfill if elected. I think that 
these insinuations are mere expedients and also irresponsible at 
such a critical moment. 
  [Correspondent] In the past you have talked of "Jewish 
Masonry." Is this not so? 
  [Pivetti] I may have spoken out about the Masonry and also 
about some Jewish lodges. But I do not think there is anything 
wrong in that. 
  [Correspondent] But you also expressed a negative opinion 
concerning the regulations on skin-heads. 
  [Pivetti] That is not so. It was back in November 1992 when 
the kickback scandal inquiry was in its decisive stages. What I 
said was that the campaign against racial intolerance was a 
means of drawing the attention of the Italians away from more 
serious problems. 
  [Correspondent] What about your antiabortion stance that is 
causing the Radicals to put their foot down. 
  [Pivetti] There is a law in Italy, Law 194. Now is the time 
to start implementing it. Including the section that provides 
for preventing abortion. 
  [Correspondent] [National Alliance Coordinator] Fini has 
said 
that: "Mussolini was the greatest statesman of the century." 
What do you think? 
  [Pivetti] We must acknowledge the fact that he built a part 
of Italy's history. Both good and bad. 
  [Correspondent] What will your 25 April [Liberation Day] be 
like? 
  [Pivetti] I hope it will be a celebration of reconciliation. 
The rights and wrongs of both sides must be acknowledged. 
  [Correspondent] During the last legislative term one of your 
colleagues shook a noose in the air. What will happen when you 
are speaker? 
  [Pivetti] There will be no nooses with me. 
  [Correspondent] Once you suggested abolishing the title 
"honorable." Will you do this again? 
  [Pivetti] Certainly. Instead of "honorable fellow 
representatives" it will be sufficient to say: "Fellow 
representatives." Period. 
  [Correspondent] With you as speaker will the League's 
machismo come to an end? 
  [Pivetti] Well, perhaps the time has come to do away with 
this myth.

<F P=106> [Interview with National Alliance Coordinator Gianfranco </F>
Fini by Federico Bianchessi in Rome; date not given: "Fini: `A 
Long Process'"] 
  [Text] [National Alliance Coordinator] Gianfranco Fini, the 
gardener. Gardenias and geraniums are the hobby of the National 
Alliance's secretary, who was roaming the lower house yesterday 
with Rudolf Borchardt's book, The Enthusiastic 
Gardener, under his arm. 
  [Bianchessi] The Senate to Forza Italia, the Lower House to 
the League. Where are your roses going to bloom, Fini, in the 
government? 
  [Fini] We did not propose any candidates for the 
speakerships 
because we wanted to make it easy for the majority to reach 
agreement right from the outset, not as a give-and-take tactic 
for the government. I give my word of honor that we have not 
yet even begun to discuss this with [Forza Italia leader] 
Berlusconi. Nevertheless, National Alliance will undoubtedly 
have a high profile in the government. 
  [Bianchessi] Rather than smoothing the way for the majority, 
one gets the impression that, once again, you wanted to leave 
Berlusconi and [League leader] Bossi alone on stage to quarrel 
with one another over appointments. Political astuteness? 
  [Fini] Well, I have been in politics for a long time.... 
  [Bianchessi] But are you satisfied with the outcome? 
  [Fini] Entirely. Carlo Scognamiglio [Senate Speakership 
candidate] has the right degree of authoritativeness to head the 
Senate; he comes from the ranks of the Liberals and he has 
experience. Irene Pivetti [Lower house speakership candidate] 
is first and foremost a woman, and that counters the Right's 
reputation for male chauvinism, and she is also the League 
exponent closest to the world of Catholicism. Last but not 
least, she is young. 
  [Bianchessi] Is youth a virtue? 
  [Fini] It has its importance. Moreover, this is Pivetti's 
second term, and she is one of the few League deputies to make a 
mark during the previous parliamentary term. 
  [Bianchessi] But do you not find this reversion to the 
Cencelli handbook [power-distribution system] irritating? 
  [Fini] That is not how things stand. The Cencelli handbook 
included the Senate and Lower House speakerships in the count 
along with the ministries, and this has not happened: There has 
been no parceling out of posts. 
  [Bianchessi] Leaving Cencelli aside, which for ministries 
will you be going? 
  [Fini] The issues closest to our hearts are social and 
welfare matters, but we shall not be making it a question of 
portfolios. We regard all the ministries as being of equal 
value. Labor and Public Works are interesting, but we have no 
requests. 
  [Bianchessi] [Outgoing Senate speaker] Spadolini is still in 
the running as speaker of the Senate. What if he wins? 
  [Fini] I do not think he will have sufficient votes. He has 
sunk his own ship by presenting himself as the expression of the 
old clubby ways. 
  [Bianchessi] Will you be celebrating 25 April [Liberation 
Day] and 1 May [Labor Day]? 
  [Fini] Yes. I will celebrate 25 April giving it the meaning 
indicated by [President] Scalfaro. The Left would be wrong to 
get its own back for 27 March [general election]. It will be 
nobody's revenge, not even ours. We have always celebrated 1 
May. The trade union negotiation system is not open to 
question. What matters is that the settlements should not lay a 
burden on the taxpayer, as they have done in the past. 
  [Bianchessi] If the Left takes to the streets, what will 
happen? 
  [Fini] If it is only the apparat, nothing, but if people 
follow it, it will mean that the government is getting something 
wrong, and we shall see if we can set it right. We shall 
certainly not be setting up a police state. Street 
demonstrations will only worry us if they are the sign of 
discontent. 
  [Bianchessi] When will the government be finalized? 
  [Fini] I have no idea. It will certainly take longer than 
the two weeks that some people have mentioned. It is best to 
avoid undue haste.

<F P=106> [Interview with Belgian Army Captain Danny Van Puyvelde, </F>
formerly responsible for the Kigali airport operation, by 
correspondent Eddy Allcock, at the Tielen Army barracks, upon 
Van Puyvelde's return from Rwanda, "this morning" -- recorded] 
  [Text] [Allcock] Captain, there are still blue helmets in 
Kigali and we know that their evacuation will not be easy. It 
has been reported that they can go either by air or by land. Is 
it indeed so difficult to withdraw these 450 blue helmets from 
there? 
  [Van Puyvelde] During the few months of the UNAMIR [UN 
Missionin Rwanda] operation, much equipment has been amassed in 
and around Kigali, and it obviously will be very difficult to 
get this equipment out speedily via an airlift to Nairobi or 
Belgium. That is why the land route solution is being opted 
for. Obviously, this route can only be followed if the 
situation is safe. 
  [Allcock] It is not safe? 
  [Van Puyvelde] As things stand now, there is a chance that 
they will go overland. So, the situation is considered to be 
safe. 
  [Allcock] And all the equipment, or at least as much a 
possible, will be recovered. 
  [Van Puyvelde] Yes, obviously.

  [Text] Fighting and slaughters are probably continuing in 
Rwanda, but reports have become very sparse. Most foreigners 
have left, including journalists. However, Kigali has still not 
fallen into the hands of the rebels of the Rwandan Patriotic 
Front [RPF], but the Rwandan capital is totally surrounded. 
  Captain Witner was among the paratroopers on the ground. He 
came back this morning with others. He was able to observe the 
strategy of the RPF and that of the Rwandan Armed Forces, their 
adversaries. Listen to the explanations he gave earlier to 
Francoise Walminck: 
  [Begin Witner recording] From a tactical viewpoint, the RPF 
behaves in a much more consistent, more ordered manner than the 
Rwandan Armed Forces. One can see that these people have been 
trained in Uganda. Very often their leaders were trained in 
England, and that can be seen in the way they work. They are 
officers, they wear the same uniforms, they are much more 
disciplined than the Rwandan Armed Forces. From a tactical 
viewpoint, each ground attack is preceded by artillery 
preparation which is methodical, systematic, and ordered. 
  [Walminck] What is their strategy? 
  [Witner] Well, we do not have much information on the forces 
present around Kigali. I imagine that they work mainly in small 
groups on foot. They infiltrate at night around the positions 
of the RPF and the noose is tightening more and more around 
Kigali. However, it is very difficult for the moment to assess 
the number of troops given the way they work. There is no 
classical front such as those in normal conflicts, but they 
infiltrate, they are light infantry. 
  [Walminck] A few days ago, it was believed that the RPF was 
about to take the town any minute. However, the presidential 
guard seems to be resisting. 
  [Witner] The presidential guard is getting ready for the 
siege of Kigali. It goes without saying that the RPF has 
practically cut off Kigali from any external reinforcements, 
from any possibility of external reinforcements. 
  [Walminck] Is the presidential guard confining itself to the 
inside? 
  [Witner] It has barricaded itself in, it has used as much 
armament as possible on the main accesses to the town. It is 
waiting. I believe that it will not let the town of Kigali go 
easily. 
  [Walminck] Do you think they can hold out for long? 
  [Witner] This could last longer than we expect. [end 
recording] 
  Captain Witner, whom you have just heard, is one of the 
officers who returned this morning. These officers took part in 
the repatriation of foreigners. On board the planes which 
arrived in Brussels earlier today were 43 paratroopers from 
Flavinne, companions of the 10 who lost their lives in Rwanda. 
The leitmotiv in their mouths when they arrived was that rules 
of engagement and the limitation on the use of weapons which 
they had to heed is absurd and criminal in their eyes.

<F P=106> [Studio interview with Foreign Minister Alois Mock by Robert </F>
Hochner in Vienna -- live] 
  [Text] [Hochner] I now welcome Foreign Minister Alois Mock 
here in the studio. Dr. Mock, I do not think I need to 
emphasize that this is a bitter time for anyone trying to 
mediate and advocate principles of humanity and peace in this 
war [in Bosnia-Herzegovina]. After what happened in Gorazde, is 
there still a way out? 
  [Mock] One must never stop searching for new ways in such 
tragedies, especially since there have always been proposals for 
a different course. Your U.S. correspondent quite rightly said 
that this is aggression constantly yiedled to, soemthing openly 
stated in mid-April of 1992 by CSCE. Why should the aggressor 
give up, withdraw, or keep his promise if he keeps getting 
accepted and his breach of promise is rewarded with new 
negotiations? I think you have to realize that the way to deal 
with an aggressor -- and we think we have learned something from 
World War II -- is to take diplomatic measures first, political 
means. But then, "all means," as the United Nations Charter 
says, including military means, should be adopted. In this 
case, it happened the other way around: Those against whom the 
aggression was directed -- originally the Slovenes, Croats, and 
Bosnians -- were deprived of the possibility to defend 
themselves by the arms embargo. This is against the UN Charter. 
The UN Charter clearly says that the entire community of states 
is to help fight aggression and that no one can be forced to 
enter a war. If this is not possible, then every nation has the 
right to defend itself. These nations were deprived of this 
right. Now we are paying the price with new casualties, new 
refugees, and a complete derogation of principles. I must say 
that this also involves risking the reputation the United States 
has acquired with special envoy Charles Redman and his mediating 
between the Croats and Bosnians being strained and lost soon. 
  [Hochner] What could the next step be? One possibility 
would be -- and this does not seem very likely -- that NATO and 
the United States suddenly resort to military severity and bomb 
the Serbs back to the negotiating table. This will not happen. 
The second possibility is that the United Nations deploys an 
adequate number of combat forces to the country with a combat 
mission -- that it has not got yet -- in order to intervene on 
the Muslim side. This will not happen either. What is still 
possible in this difficult situation? 
  [Mock] Even at the risk of repeating myself: I have never 
considered general invasion and intervention possible. We have 
thought -- and therefore it also comes as a disappointment to us 
-- that if a city is declared a security zone, military 
intervention can become necessary to protect this security zone. 
Why is Sarajevo a functioning security zone now, more or less 
the first time in two years? Because the threat of military 
strikes was meant seriously. I think that Sarajevo will be 
endangered again as of tomorrow. 
  [Hochner] The United Nations not only declared Sarajevo a 
security zone, but also towns such as Tuzla, Srebrenica, and 
Gorazde. Was it not politically naive to think that the Serbs, 
who want to have a compact whole territory for the future Serbia 
in Bosnia, will tolerate Muslim enclaves in the middle of their 
territory? 
  [Mock] I do not think this was naive, because we have seen 
that it works. Austria was the first country to propose 
security zones in the Security Council -- Bihac, Gorazde, 
Sarajevo, Tuzla, and Travnik. We used the security zone for the 
Kurds in northern Iraq as a model. Saddam Husayn has accepted 
this. How would the United Nations have known that the 
opponents in this war -- the Serbs -- would be even worse than 
Saddam Husayn? I think that was a realistic assumption. But it 
has never been handled with consistency. One resolution after 
the other was adopted; there are five Security Council 
resolutions saying that if humanitarian aid is obstructed, it 
can be protected by military means. There is a Security Council 
resolution saying that if a security zone is attacked, it can be 
defended by military means. Why should the aggressor think that 
any of this is true if there are never any consequences taken? 
In the cases where there were consequences, like in Sarajevo, 
these have had an effect. These consequences would be more 
effective today since even Vitaliy Churkin and Andrey Kozyrev 
are saying very clearly -- and this must be mentioned in 
acknowledgment of Russian policy -- that the way the aggressor 
is acting is irresponsible. 
  [Hochner] You said there were consequences in the case of 
Sarajevo. There have been consequences in Gorazde as well -- 
two very limited and not very successful attacks. Does this not 
mean that an attack by NATO, if it is carried out, must be much 
more massive, more carefully directed, and more successful to 
achieve the consequences you have been talking about? 
  [Mock] Yes, of course. If your house is attacked by 
criminals and the police come along, they cannot ask: Will one 
or two policemen be enough? They have the responsibility to 
provide adequate police protection that not only protects 
citizens from criminals but also protects the policemen 
themselves. 
  [Hochner] The UN secretary general says this confusion is 
the superpowers' fault, the Americans say the Europeans are to 
blame, the Europeans say it is the European Union, and the 
European Union says it is the United Nations. Should not all 
these responsibilities be taken together and one organization or 
one group of states be given the right to decide in order to 
enable decisions -- if they are taken -- to be realized quickly 
and consistently? 
  [Mock] This is right. I think the United Nations has 
enormous weaknesses, which I have frequently mentioned. But you 
must not forget that in spite of these difficulties, the United 
Nations has saved the lives of thousands of people. But the 
United Nations is only as strong as the major countries behind 
it, especially in the Security Council. The ultimate 
responsibility always lies with these countries. 
  [Hochner] Thank you very much for the interview.

  [Text] Paris, April 18 (AFP) -- The Medecins sans 
Frontieres [MSF--Doctors Without Borders] relief group Monday 
[18 April] called for the resignation of UN special envoy to the 
former Yugoslavia, Yasushi Akashi, saying the UN had 
"systematically lied" about the situation in Bosnia. 
  The president of the organisation, Rony Brauman, also 
accused 
the UN of "shamelessly capitulating" in the face of the Bosnian 
Serb offensive against Gorazde, the besieged Moslem enclave in 
eastern Bosnia which has now all but fallen. 
  "While Gorazde was drowning under a barrage of fire, we were 
being told that a ceasefire was agreed on the ground, that we 
were headed for a peaceful settlement, and that all was well," 
Brauman said. 
  "What is at stake is the fate of other so-called safe 
havens," he said. What was to stop Serb forces from attacking 
other UN-declared safe havens in the wake of their success at 
Gorazde, he asked. 
  Meanwhile some 200 wounded were awaiting evacuation from 
Gorazde and two Medecins sans Frontieres doctors still operating 
in the town's hospital were working in horrendous conditions, 
Brauman said. 
  Two International Committee of the Red Cross representatives 
and four from the office of the UN High Commissioner for 
Refugees also remained in the town where 65,000 residents and 
refugees underwent renewed shelling Monday morning. 
  "At the hospital, it's chaos. Bullets are whizzing through 
the windows into patients' rooms, shells are exploding in the 
hospital garden sending deadly shrapnel into the rooms of this 
so-called neutral area," Brauman said. The emergency room is 
full of dead and wounded, civilians and soldiers," according to 
the MSF doctors on the spot.

<F P=106> [By Graham Brown] </F>
  [Text] Luxembourg, April 18 (AFP) -- The European Union 
[EU] has ruled out an escalation of military force in 
Bosnia-Herzegovina to stop the Serb assault on Gorazde, British 
Foreign Secretary Douglas Hurd said here Monday [18 April]. 
  Instead, the European Union made it clear it was relying on 
Russia to help pressure Serbia into withdrawing from the mainly 
Moslem enclave and agreeing to a peace settlement in Bosnia. 
  Hurd was speaking during a meeting of EU foreign ministers 
which urged a new UN Security Council resolution backing a joint 
United States, Russian and EU initiative for a ceasefire in 
Gorazde and elsewhere in Bosnia. 
  French Foreign Minister Alain Juppe said the European Union 
should neither abandon Gorazde and the UN peacemaking effort in 
Bosnia, nor escalate military action there. 
  Hurd added: "I do not think anyone (at the meeting) is ready 
to participate in a war which has no end." 
  Faced by the near-collapse of efforts to protect Gorazde 
from 
Serb attacks, the EU ministers called for an immediate ceasefire 
around the enclave, followed by the deployment of UN troops 
there. 
  They were preparing a statement calling for a Serb pull-back 
and an exclusion zone around Gorazde, followed by a more general 
ceasefire in Bosnia. 
  There was general support for a French initiative calling 
for 
a conference in Geneva involving the United States, Russia, the 
European Union and the United Nations to hammer out a joint 
negotiating approach. 
  Juppe said this was necessary to stamp out "double language" 
in negotiations with the Bosnian Serbs. 
  The French minister said he had proposed such a conference 
to 
Russian Foreign Minister Andrei Kozyrev and to U.S. Secretary of 
State Warren Christopher, and neither had said "no." 
  Hurd appealed to the international community to quickly 
provide UN peace-keeping troops to send into Gorazde. 
  He said that France and Britain had provided the lion's 
share 
of 1,300 troops so far available to deploy in the enclave, but 
that this number was unsatisfactory. 
  "It will certainly need more troops. That is an urgent 
need," Hurd said of the European Union's ceasefire call, and 
urged countries which were not sending troops, such as the 
United States, to help finance the peacekeeping action. 
  German Foreign Minister Klaus Kinkel told journalists that, 
as a last resort, the international community should be ready to 
stop a Serb capture of Gorazde by force. 
  "In the last resort, a Serb take-over of Gorazde should be 
militarily stopped," he said, adding that any plans to relax 
sanctions against Serbia should be dropped because the Serbs had 
shown no flexibility. 
  The German minister appealed to Russia to exert all possible 
influence on Serbia, adding that Moscow had no interest in a 
further escalation of the fighting in Bosnia.

  [Text] Luxembourg, April 18 (AFP) -- The European Union 
called here Monday [18 April] for an international programme of 
humanitarian aid in response to the "human tragedy" in Rwanda, 
and said it was ready to take part. 
  A statement issued during a meeting of EU foreign ministers 
also appealed to the warring Hutu and Tutsi tribes in Rwanda to 
stop fighting and resume negotiations under the Arusha accord 
signed in August last year. 
  The accord provides a framework for a negotiated settlement 
leading to democratic elections that would bring the minority 
Tutsis into government. 
  Tens of thousands of people have been killed and wounded in 
Rwanda since inter-tribal bloodshed resumed on April 6.

  [Excerpts] Reports about terror and horror perpetrated by 
uncontrolled armed gangs are still arriving from Rwanda. 
[passage omitted] Belgian soldiers will leave Rwanda tomorrow, 
19 April, and it is feared that the massacres will continue. 
  [Begin recording] [Special correspondent Angeles Bandres] At 
Kigali Airport, an airport turned into a camp, Belgian, 
Pakistani, and Bangladeshi Blue Helmets mount guard. The last 
will remain in Rwanda as long as the United Nations wants them 
to remain. All Belgians are due to have left by 19 April. 
  The Spanish military are due to fly them out in two flights 
a 
day today and tomorrow. The two Spanish Air Force Hercules 
planes have landed again in Kigali. This time the aim is to 
pick up military equipment and Belgian Blue Helmets. The 
evacuation of this battalion is to be completed in just a few 
days. 
  The Spanish Hercules landed in Kigali at 2000; the landing 
strip was well marked, but the orders were that the planes had 
to fly without lights for security reasons. 
  [Captain Javier Frias] We started our descent, but the air 
controller in Kigali told us to stop going down because shots 
were being fired. 
  [Bandres] In principle, the Spanish mission is due to finish 
on Thursday, 21 April, returning to Spain through Brussels in 
order to drop the Belgian soldiers off in their country.

<F P=106> [Interview with Foreign Minister Kinkel by Ulrich Wickert in </F>
the studio in Bonn on 18 April -- recorded] 
  [Text] [Wickert] The discussions today [by European Union 
foreign ministers in Luxembourg] did not yield much. Is this 
now the end of Gorazde? 
  [Kinkel] I am just as unhappy as the people who are watching 
what is going on here, this stranglehold of the Serbs on 
Gorazde. At the moment, I cannot say whether it is the end. I 
hope not. The situation is the following: Air strikes have 
become difficult, because one would have to carry them out 
against the 60,000 Muslims surrounded by the Serbs and in part 
also against UNPROFOR [UN Protection Force] soldiers, who are in 
the town or at least have been there up to now. On the ground 
no country is willing to send soldiers for combat missions. And 
I cannot blame anyone for that. 
  [Wickert] Air strikes should perhaps have been carried out a 
few days ago. 
  [Kinkel] Well, air strikes were indeed carried out but they 
were always directed against weapons aimed at UNPROFOR. These 
were the demands of the UN, and this was done. The air strikes 
against the town itself would necessarily always have been aimed 
at the civilian population. 
  [Wickert] You yourself now demand that the Russians 
intervene more and exert more pressure, but Russian special 
envoy Churkin says that talking with the Serbs is over, as they 
are just abusing us. 
  [Kinkel] Yes, this is a sad sign for me. The Russians have 
the strongest influence on the Serbs, and if this influence is 
now lost or decreases, then the situation will become even more 
difficult. Therefore, today in Luxembourg, we, the 12 foreign 
ministers of the European Union, have decided to try once again 
to bring together the United States, the Russians, the 
Europeans, and Owen and Stoltenberg, and to make another try. 
  [Wickert] Well, you can bring them all together, but the 
Serbs are quite obviously laughing. 
  [Kinkel] They are obviously determined to do everything. 
This is the bad thing. 
  [Wickert] Well, then something has to be done. U.S. 
President Bill Clinton wants to lift the arms embargo against 
the Bosnian Muslims. What do you say to that? 
  [Kinkel] There is no majority for that in the European 
Union, and I understand that. Clinton does not have any ground 
forces there. The French have 6,000 men there, the British more 
than 2,000, the Danish and the Belgians, too. They have the 
duty to care for their soldiers. They have had many, many 
deaths. I also tell the citizens in the FRG, who keep demanding 
combat missions: Are you willing to send your own sons there, 
to such a war? 
  [Wickert] Then the only thing one can do is to withdraw the 
UN troops. 
  [Kinkel] No, this would not be the right thing either. We 
cannot let the people in the besieged town in the lurch in this 
situation. Today, we, the European foreign ministers, were of 
the opinion that this should not be done and that, 
unfortunately, the only thing we can do in this difficult 
situation is to keep trying. 
  [Wickert] What does keep trying mean? 
  [Kinkel] Well, we have achieved quite some things in the 
political peace process -- Sarajevo, the opening up of Tuzla.... 
  [Wickert] Okay, but these are things that you did not 
achieve by talking but by threatening with the use of force. 
  [Kinkel] No, no, this only applies to Sarajevo. The other 
things -- the cease-fire in Krajina, the opening up of Tuzla -- 
were achieved without any direct NATO threats. 
  [Wickert] But that was achieved at a time when one still 
could talk. Sarajevo was achieved by military pressure and 
Gorazde could probably also have been saved by military pressure. 
  [Kinkel] No, Gorazde is in a different situation 
geographically speaking and is obviously far more difficult than 
Sarajevo for military reasons. However, Sarajevo was also 
prepared in political talks, in diplomatic talks. This is 
forgotten so easily. It was not only military measures. 
  I must say again: Who is supposed to go there? Our German 
sons? We cannot go there. We cannot go there because of our 
constitutional situation. We are damned bad advisers to others, 
and we should restrain ourselves. Am I supposed to tell the 
British, the French, the Belgians, and the Danish: You have to 
send your sons there and let them bleed to death, also on our 
behalf. We always say that we are safe on our constitutional 
side. We cannot go there, also because of the historical 
situation. We should restrain ourselves. I can only say: Be 
careful. 
  There is a good purpose in the fact that no combat troops 
have been sent in so far.

<F P=106> ["Welt-Nachrichtendienst" report: "Bundeswehr to Bosnia: </F>
Schaeuble Contradicts Kohl"] 
  [Excerpt] Bonn -- Differences over the participation of 
Bundeswehr soldiers in missions in the former Yugoslavia seem to 
have appeared between Federal Chancellor Helmut Kohl, of the 
Christian Democratic Union [CDU], and Wolfgang Schaeuble, 
chairman of the CSU/Christian Social Union [CSU] Bundestag Group. 
  Kohl stated yesterday that he was taking an "extremely 
skeptical" position on this issue. Memories of World War II are 
particularly vivid in that part of Europe, which is why we "will 
have to discuss the question of help quietly." The chancellor 
spoke in favor of humanitarian and technical support for the 
reconstruction of Bosnia. 
  Schaeuble, however, did not expressly rule out the 
involvement of German soldiers: "Basically one must say that 
Germany must make its contribution -- including in the military 
sphere -- to peace in the former Yugoslavia. Should peace be 
concluded, then the participation of German soldiers should not 
be ruled out on principle to secure and consolidate peace -- 
under one condition: All parties involved must agree to it." 
  Government Spokesman Vogel said in this connection that he 
saw fundamentally "no differences" between the two leading CDU 
officials on the issue of international Bundeswehr missions. 
Both were basically in favor of such Bundeswehr missions, he 
said, without making any specific mention of Yugoslavia.

  [Text] Karlsruhe (DDP/ADN) -- German Foreign Minister Klaus 
Kinkel and Defense Minister Volker Ruehe were in agreement on 
Tuesday [19 April] in their plea before the Federal 
Constitutional Court in Karlsruhe for Bundeswehr participation 
in UN peace missions. Kinkel noted that peace, stability, and 
Germany's own security depend more and more on surmounting 
crises outside the area of the NATO alliance. Some 70,000 
soldiers from 68 countries are deployed in 16 areas of unrest in 
the interest of peace. In this situation, the partners expect 
Germany to provide not only financial and material support, but 
also Bundeswehr participation. Germany bears responsibility for 
strengthening the new multilateral security architecture. 
Urgent clarification is needed of the constitutional issue 
concerning the involvement of German soldiers in Blue Helmet 
missions. Otherwise, Germany will be harmed. Kinkel expressed 
the hope that the Federal Constitutional Court will allow the 
German Government in the future to send German soldiers to help 
people in need in the interest of peace, just like the soldiers 
of other countries. 
  Defense Minister Ruehe also demanded that Germany, as a 
driving force for European integration, should not stand by as 
UN peace missions continue. Otherwise, there is a danger of 
politics being renationalized.
