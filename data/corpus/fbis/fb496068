<F P=106> [Commentary by Martina Fietz: "Luckless Liberal"] </F>
  [Text] To expect the state to guarantee both freedom and 
security is frequently described as a contradiction. It is 
generally assumed that the one can only be realized at the 
expense of the other. Given this contradiction of values, Josef 
Isensee, a professor of constitutional law in Bonn, declared in 
1982, a "liberal" is someone who favors freedom and a 
"conservative" is someone who opts for security. 
  This analysis can also be applied to political parties. Many 
liberals still view it as their primary task to protect the 
individual citizen against the supposedly almighty state. But 
they ignore the fact that a paradigm shift has long since taken 
place. Today, it is not intrusion by the state into the privacy 
of the individual which poses a threat. The threat comes from 
the increasingly solidified criminal countersociety, 
internationally organized and driven by the quest for power and 
profit, which exposes everyone at all times to the possibility 
of becoming a victim of robbery, fraud or violence. Not to have 
taken note of this state of affairs or at the very least to have 
neglected to take the necessary consequences is the most serious 
accusation to be lodged against Minister of Justice, Sabine 
Leutheusser-Schnarrenberger, at this time. 
  Her outdated concept of liberality is reflected in her 
obstinate refusal to agree to bugging private homes. "The 
government has no business in people's bedrooms," she says, 
thereby contributing to the fact that the debate is conducted in 
an unprofessional manner. She has even labeled members of her 
own party as "esoterics" and reproached them for coming out in 
favor of such investigative methods, saying that if their demand 
were met one might just as well reintroduce physical torture 
(although she later withdrew the charge). 
  Thus far, the liberals have been unable to come up with 
anything new to keep the debate moving. The interim model of 
excluding backrooms of amusement arcades and bordellos from 
protection under the constitution while continuing to declare 
private homes off limits has since been shelved by reason of its 
unpracticability. 
  The justice minister also places obstacles in the way of the 
debate on the deportation of Kurds who commit acts of violence. 
Her reluctance to talk about plans to conclude an agreement with 
Turkey guaranteeing that deported Kurds are not tortured or 
sentenced to death is quite incomprehensible. Such an assurance 
coupled with international human rights covenants and control 
mechanisms would provide a great deal of security for the 
deportees. The justice minister's critique of the Bavarian order 
to deport the Kurds who participated in the March riots looks 
very much like a campaign ploy to exploit the "liberal" versus 
"conservative" cliches. When Lower Saxony, governed by a 
red-and-green coalition, deported 31 Kurds in January and 
February no objections were raised. However serious the concern 
for the protection of human rights may be, there is one thing a 
state governed by the rule of law must keep from happening if it 
is not to lose its credibility--and that is that the right to 
hospitality it has granted is not grossly abused. 
  Frau Leutheusser-Schnarrenberger is also not having much 
luck 
in dealing with domestic terrorism. It was unwise of her 
recently to reiterate that the political establishment should 
seek to reach a reconciliation with the Red Army Faction. If a 
"dialogue" were at all possible or, for that matter, promising 
of success, then it should take place outside the glare of 
public opinion. Otherwise, hopes might be raised which could not 
be fulfillied and it might give the impression of special 
treatment and two-tier justice. And that would not help 
strengthen already dwindling confidence in law and justice. 
  Nor did the minister demonstrate expertise or good sense on 
another issue: she violently opposed the 
witness-for-the-prosecution arrangement, saying that she thought 
it was useless. But then she agreed to introduce it in cases 
involving organized crime. The explanations she gave for 
changing her mind were vague. Did she only do so at the behest 
of Foreign Minister Klaus Kinkel, her party's chairman who 
preceded her in office, who wished to demonstrate the FDP's 
ability to deal with internal security? Members of all the 
political parties represented on the committee which met to deal 
with the asylum compromise had already complained about 
Leutheusser-Schnarrenberger's lack of sound legal judgment. 
  Crime is on the rise. The country is faced by the threat of 
right-wing and left-wing extremism as well as foreign extremist 
groups. Awareness of right and, above all, of wrong is ebbing 
away. In such a situation, the justice minister's position in a 
state governed by the rule of law must be occupied by a sound 
legal mind determined to make responsible and even-handed use of 
the governmental powers. The present officeholder does not meet 
these demands.

<F P=106> ["wl" report: "If Everything Goes Well, Figures in 1995 </F>
Will Be Positive"] 
  [Text] Munich -- The measures introduced at Deutsche 
Aerospace AG (Dasa), Munich, structural and capacity adjustment, 
which are primarily linked with the reduction of about 18,000 
jobs, are showing a first effect. Juergen E. Schrempp, chairman 
of the board of directors, and Financial Director Manfred 
Bischoff, had to announce a corporate loss of 694 million German 
marks [DM] (last year DM341) upon presentation of the 1993 
balance sheet and a decline in turnover by 10 percent to DM18.6 
(20.65) billion. They noted that 1994 will again be a 
"difficult year." However, this year a smaller loss is expected 
while turnover should remain relatively stable and it is hoped 
that in 1995, "when the political-economic surroundings do not 
deteriorate dramatically," profit will again be made. 
  Looking at these figures, it is to be taken into account 
that 
last year the negative balance of Fokker NV, which showed a loss 
of about DM460 million -- of which more than half goes to Dasa, 
because of its 51-percent share -- was fully compensated. The 
changes in the consolidation cycle also have to be considered in 
connection with all other figures, e.g. with turnover (at that 
time give as DM17.3 billion for 1992). Apart from a surplus of 
DM160 (411) million achieved by Deutsche Aerospace Airbus GmbH, 
Hamburg, all subsidiaries suffered considerable losses. In 
terms of sectors, only space flight achieved a surplus of DM53 
million, while aviation suffered a loss of DM327 million and 
defense a loss of DM258 million. Dasa AG, which does not have a 
contract for transferring profits with, among others, Airbus 
GmbH, even suffered a lost of DM994 (503) million, according to 
the business report of the mother company Daimler-Benz AG. 
  Schrempp cited the "slump of our markets in the civilian and 
military areas, the massive disadvantages under which Dasa had 
to stand on its own in the internationally escalated 
competition, and the costs for the structural measure that have 
to be taken." These one-time expenditures caused a burden of 
DM1.1 billion on the 1993 result. 
  After taking over Fokker, Dasa has a turnover of $12.9 
billion, thus being the third largest aerospace company after 
Boeing ($29.6 billion) and McDonnell Douglas ($17 billion). 
With a view to the U.S. competition, Schrempp called for "an 
international reduction of subsidies" and equal framework 
conditions. The prospects in defense technology, the share of 
which will probably even out between 20 and 25 percent of 
turnover, is "extremely positive," according to him, if the 
correct political decisions are made. In the future, focal 
issues must be systems that can prevent wars if possible. He 
cited, above all, air defense and electronic reconnaissance 
systems. Regarding arms exports, he said: "We are not 
interested in exporting to countries outside NATO." However, 
there must finally be European harmonization so that, in 
particular, cooperation projects with France and Great Britain 
can be undertaken. 
  Including the lay-offs, which have already been implemented 
this year, in 1994 and 1995 a total of 10,300 jobs are to be 
abolished. Schrempp: "These are the most difficult decisions in 
a manager's life; on the other hand, this is the only chance to 
safeguard jobs." Approximately 1,500 jobs will be abolished in 
the Bavarian factories this year. Concerning the factory in 
Lemwerder, which is threatened with closure, Schrempp said: "We 
are getting out of servicing civilian planes, because it is not 
possible in Germany." 
  As outstanding events of the recent past, Schrempp cited the 
first flight of Eurofighter 2000 (whose serial production 
Schrempp expects). The Dornier 328 has been introduced on the 
market. In the meantime, about 100 orders and options have been 
received. Looking at the figures, it is striking that the orders 
received have doubled; from the purely arithmetic point of view 
they have increased almost to the turnover of two years. This 
is primarily due to plane construction with its long periods for 
orders. Schrempp pointed out that, as a result of the recession 
on the international plane market, the annual Airbus deliveries 
have to be reduced from about 200 to 120 to 123 planes and might 
even about at 140 to 150. 
  Regarding the future development, Financial Director 
Bischoff 
said: "The massive reduction of costs to at least a competitive 
level and the increased appearance of Dasa on the markets make 
me very confident." Therefore, a positive balance sheet is 
expected again as of 1995, if no additional burdens have to be 
coped with. He justified the remarkable increase in liquid means 
by referring to cost reductions and increased efficiency in 
current assets, while reserves for structural and capacity 
adjustments increased this item of the balance sheet 
considerably. To met the capital need at Fokker, measures have 
to be taken this year to improve the balance sheet relations 
together with the Dutch Government, which also holds a share in 
the company.

<F P=106> [Gerd Brueggemann report: "Waigel Bets IMF Director"] </F>
  [Text] Washington -- Prior to the meeting of finance 
ministers and central bank governors on the occasion of the 
spring meeting of the World Bank and the IMF in Washington, 
Finance Minister Theo Waigel offered a bet to IMF director 
Michel Camdessus: The German world economy will develop more 
favorably than predicted by the IMF. Waigel deplored that the 
IMF underestimated the dynamism in the new laender. The IMF 
predicted a growth of 0.8 percent, but Waigel considers 1.5 
percent possible. 
  Bundesbank President Hans Tietmeyer does not expect any new 
criticism of its monetary policy. The difference in interest 
rates between Germany and the United States has declined from 6 
percent to 1.5 percent in the past two years. The long-term U.S. 
interest rates have in the meantime even risen above the German 
level. This was possible without a change concerning the 
exchange rates. 
  The two German representatives reject plans by the IMF to 
create new special drawing rights worth $50 billion. Waigel 
described the IMF argument that this would lead to additional 
funds for Russia as "shortsighted." Aid for Russia must be 
provided in the form of conditioned loans. 
  Waigel will meet for talks with his U.S. counterpart Lloyd 
Bentsen. He will discuss, among other things, problems 
concerning the admission of German companies to U.S. stock 
exchanges.

<F P=106> ["wil." report: "Current Account Deficit of DM4.8 Billion"] </F>
  [Text] Frankfurt -- As compared to a deficit of 5.7 
billion German marks [DM] in January 1994, the German balance of 
goods and services showed a deficit of DM4.8 billion in February 
1994. This is reported by the Federal Statistical Office, 
Wiesbaden, and it adds that this current account deficit also 
takes the balances of the additions to the goods traffic (minus 
DM0.1 billion), the balance of service transactions (minus DM4.2 
billion), and unpaid services (minus DM6.2 billion) into account. 
  Moreover, the Federal Statistical Office reported that the 
trade balance was concluded with a surplus of DM5.7 billion in 
February 1994. According to preliminary information, goods 
valued at DM50.7 billion were exported and goods valued at 
DM45.0 billion were imported, the authority writes. The trade 
within the European Union [EU] accounted for exports of DM25.2 
billion and imports of DM21.7 billion. The Federal Office 
reports that the foreign trade balance is composed of a surplus 
of DM2.2 billion in external trade (with non-EU countries) and a 
surplus of DM3.5 billion in internal trade (within the EU). 
  As compared to last month, the results of the February trade 
balance means an increase in exports by 6.2 percent and in 
imports by 7.3 percent. Divided into external and internal 
trade, this means a growth of exports by 3.0 percent and of 
imports by 3.8 percent in third countries and an increase by 9.6 
percent (exports) and by 11.3 percent (imports) within the EU. 
  As compared to February 1993, exports decreased by 0.3 
percent and imports by 6.5 percent. If January and February are 
compared to the same period in 1993, exports improved by 2.6 
percent and imports deteriorated by 4.9 percent.

<F P=106> ["ari"-signed report: "BDI Considers Hopes of Growth in </F>
Exports Fully Justified"] 
  [Text] In its latest report on the economic situation, the 
Federation of Germany (BDI) states that the economic situation 
in western Germany at the beginning of 1994 underwent a further 
stabilization. 
  Industrial output, however, stagnated. Orders are continuing 
to increase, with demand from abroad gaining in momentum. The 
price situation has become more stable. In view of wage 
agreements being in keeping with the economic situation, the 
pressure on costs has been reduced and the downward trend in 
interest rates is continuing. 
  All this indicates that business will pick up over the next 
few months. Expectations that warehouse stocks will have to be 
increased and an actual tendency to do so support a cautiously 
optimistic view. However, this cannot conceal the basic problem 
-- weak domestic demand. 
  The BDI does not assume that domestic demand will increase 
over the rest of the year. However, expectations of a further 
rapid increase in exports are completely justified. In addition 
to a strong economic upturn in a whole series of countries 
outside Europe, the first signs of an increase in demand in 
Europe have become apparent. The first indications of economic 
recovery as well as a reversal of the tendency for the German 
mark to increase in value within the European Monetary System 
play a role in this respect. 
  The prospects for the labor market are not good. Even if the 
economy develops favorably, the BDI estimates the number of 
persons in employment will fall further. The reduction in 
employment in both western and eastern Germany will constitute 
the most serious economic policy problem over the next few 
years. It is inconceivable that this problem should be solved 
unless investment grows at a significant rate. That is why the 
federation has called for an easing of the taxation and public 
dues burden on companies. This could help encourage investment 
and thus contribute to the creation of new jobs. 
  Growth in the new laender has accelerated, writes the BDI. 
However, despite considerable progress, east German industry 
still cannot keep pace with international competition. The 
unsatisfactory development of exports to Western industrial 
countries reflects this very clearly. 
  In western Germany, the impact of gradual economic recovery 
on the various branches of the economy has differed 
considerably. The raw materials and industrial goods industry 
had recovered the most in the meantime. Output rose in almost 
all sectors. According to the BDI, the recession has bottomed 
out for manufacturers of producer goods thanks to increased 
demand from abroad. Until recently, output in the consumer 
goods industry was falling. This is the strongest indication of 
weak growth in private consumption. 
  The BDI economic reports also note a sustained upturn in the 
west and an improvement in the situation in the east for certain 
selected branches of industry. 
<H5>  The Construction Industry </H5>
  The situation in the construction industry has stopped 
deteriorating over the past few months. Housing construction is 
expanding rapidly, and there are indications of more stability 
in industrial and public construction. Orders for industrial 
construction are once again close to last year's high level, and 
the recession in civil engineering is slowing. There has been 
no improvement in the case of structural engineering orders 
placed by the railroad, postal service, and in civil engineering 
orders placed by local government. In contrast to orders, the 
earnings situation is being increasingly negatively assessed. 
  In eastern Germany, housing construction, which registered a 
nominal increase in sales of 40 percent in 1993, expanded the 
most, with industrial construction increasing by 33 percent and 
public construction increasing by 15 percent. East German 
construction companies posted sales of 125,000 German marks [DM] 
per employee. Thus, the difference in productivity compared to 
west German companies fell by one-fifth. Employment rose by a 
substantial 12 percent to over 370,000. 
<H5>  Engineering </H5>
  The continuing negative trend in west German engineering 
shows that investment in western Germany is still in retreat. 
However, orders from abroad indicate that there will be an 
upturn. In addition, in January/February 1994, orders from EU 
[European Union] countries picked up for the first time. The 
first positive effects of improved business abroad can already 
be felt in the ancillary field. The stimulus from abroad has 
slowed the decline in output, but at the beginning of 1994, 
output fell once again, by a further 2.1 percent compared to 
last year's level. Since 1990, engineering output has easily 
fallen by a fifth. The shedding of jobs that this has triggered 
has still not come to an end. 
  In the course of 1993, east German engineering has 
experienced a turn for the better. Output has grown rapidly, 
and the rate at which jobs are being shed has slowed. However, 
the productivity gap has still not been closed, and the number 
of people employed in the industry will continue to decrease. 
<H5>  The Automobile Industry </H5>
  Demand from western companies has grown for the first time 
compared to a year before. However, this does not mean that the 
situation in the automobile industry will pick up, because the 
level of domestic demand is still very low. The decline in 
domestic demand for commercial vehicles reflects the continued 
weak level of investment. On the other hand, there has been a 
slight increase in demand from abroad. However, for a long 
time, there has not been a sustained improvement that would 
stimulate higher output. 
  Production of automobiles in the east is expanding rapidly. 
The number of employees is no longer declining. In terms of 
sales per employee, two-thirds of west German productivity 
levels have been reached. 
<H5>  Electrical Engineering </H5>
  In the west, the rate of decline markedly slowed during the 
second half of 1993. Nevertheless, the continued rise in orders 
from abroad could not compensate for a further sharp fall in 
domestic orders. The manufacture of electrical engineering 
capital goods continued to fall, but the level of a year ago was 
only marginally exceeded. Output of consumer goods grew and 
production of entertainment electronics even rose rapidly. The 
rationalization measures introduced in 1993 have led to a steep 
increase in productivity and in the fourth quarter of 1991, unit 
labor costs fell for the first time. 
  The situation in the east German electrical engineering 
industry has stabilized. Employment stopped declining in 1993. 
The productivity gap compared to the west has become smaller. 
<H5>  Printing </H5>
  In contrast to other branches of the economy, the west 
German 
printing industry did not come out of the recession in 1993. 
The downward trend in output -- a good 4 percent lower over the 
year as a whole -- gained in momentum in the second half of the 
year. Nominal sales fell for the first time since the 
establishment of the FRG. There was no indication of a reversal 
of this trend at the end of the year. In line with the fall in 
output, the number of employees also declined. Nevertheless, 
the pressure exerted by costs intensified at the end of the 
year. Whereas average labor unit costs in manufacturing were 
below the previous year's level in the fourth quarter of 1993, 
in the printing industry they grew by more than 4 percent. In 
view of this, the prospects for 1994 remain unfavorable. There 
were no indications of a recovery. 
  In eastern Germany, the situation in the printing industry 
continued to improve. However, the upward trend in 1993 was 
weaker than in 1992. The productivity gap was reduced once 
again. In the fourth quarter, sales per employee reached 
three-quarters of west German levels.

<F P=106> [Article by Barbara Gillmann: "East Europe's Interest in </F>
Ifo-Technique for Management Polling Is Growing"] 
  [Text] Since the beginning of this week, the cream of 
German economic researchers are meeting at Poschingerstrasse 5 
in Munich's posh Bogenhausen section. During this and next week, 
they will write the spring survey on Germany's overall economic 
prospects, eagerly awaited by industry and politicians. 
  The six participating institutes, Ifo, IfW, HWWA, DIW, RWI 
and IWH, host in turn the two decisive weeks of meetings. This 
time, it is Ifo's turn. 
  The struggle for a common line often lasts until after 
midnight; this is how Gernot Nerb, head of the overall economic 
analysis department of Ifo, describes his experience of the past 
years. But very often, it already becomes clear at half-time 
whether they can agree, or whether an individual institute, such 
as the DIW in spring, will cast a minority ballot. 
  In a week and a half, the institutes' presidents in Bonn 
will 
present the joint analysis to the public. Senior among the six 
gentlemen is Professor Karl Heinrich Oppenlaender. The 
62-year-old has been heading the Ifo Institute, whose name 
stands for information and research, since 1976. After a 
business apprenticeship, he studied in the Bavarian land capital 
and joined Ifo in 1958. Since 1983, he has also been teaching at 
the University of Munich. Oppenlaender challenges his colleagues 
not only in scientific disputes, but also in regular table 
tennis rounds. 
  Work on the joint survey is only a small part of the 
institute's work. It has become famous, and even familiar to 
some economic laymen, for its enterprise polls. Since 1950, the 
Munich researchers have been polling up to 12,000 enterprises 
each month on their assessment of the situation and prospects 
for the coming six months. In January and February 1994, for 
example, the enterprises predominantly considered the situation 
still bad, while for the first time in many months their 
majority assessed the prospects for the coming six months to be 
positive. 
  With this reflection of the mood at the grass roots, Ifo 
wants to advance economic theory. Oppenlaender emphasizes that 
science still has no pertinent explanation for the ups and downs 
of the business cycle, thus making it difficult to predict. 
  The Ifo procedure has found adherents worldwide. At present, 
over 1,000 institutes in 43 countries poll enterprises using the 
Munich method, reports Oppenlaender. 
<H5>  Oppenlaender Is the Most Senior of the Institutes' Presidents </H5>
  United in the Centre for International Research on Economic 
Tendency Surveys (Ciret), the specialists for enterprise polls 
meet every two years. In 1991, the exchange took place for the 
first time in East Europe, in Budapest to be precise. For a very 
good reason: At the time of planned economies, enterprise polls 
were largely unknown in East Europe, but now interest is 
growing. For instance, members of Yeltsin's staff have already 
had the handbook for Ifo polls translated--but without first 
asking for permission in Munich, notes Oppenlaender. 
  The Chinese also interviewed 2,000 enterprises using the Ifo 
questionnaire. To evaluate the data, they turned to Munich for 
help. According to Oppenlaender, the department for developing 
countries rendered them this "service of friendship." 
  Not only researchers of the formerly communist world change 
their thinking; Ifo also had to reorient itself. "Actually, you 
don't quite know what is really going on here in eastern 
Germany," Saxony's Finance Minister Milbradt rebuked the Ifo 
president in 1992. Oppenlaender reacted promptly and talked the 
Saxons into giving financial support for a branch office. So 
since September 1993, there exists now a Dresden Ifo. Since 
January 1994, the magazine IFO DRESDEN REPORTS provides 
information on the new laender, based among other things on the 
economic tests done in Saxony. 
  Also new, since the beginning of 1994, is the East Europe 
department. Six researchers deal primarily with Hungary, Poland, 
the Czech Republic, and Slovakia. A further focal point of 
Eastern research centers on observation of Kazakhstan, 
commissioned by the federal economics minister.

Finance Minister 
  Also this year, Ifo will establish a department for the 
labor 
market and social policy which is to devote itself to overall 
health research. 
  Two-thirds of Ifo researchers deal with microeconomic 
issues; 
most departments belong to the division "sectors, regions, and 
enterprises." The remaining capacity deals with the foreign and 
domestic economy. 
  In addition to the branch office in Dresden, the researchers 
at the parent office will also continue to focus on the new 
laender. For instance, they study construction activity 
separately, for integrating the east in the "overall German 
construction preestimate" of Ifo does not yet make sense "for 
years to come." For the German railway they are supposed to find 
out, for example, to what extent the eastern construction boom 
will bring additional transport orders for building materials 
and waste removal. 
  Ifo presents scientific results in numerous publications. 
The 
SCHNELLDIENST [express service] appears three times a month; the 
WIRTSCHAFTSKONJUNKTUR [business cycle], KONJUNKTURINDIKATOREN 
[economic indicators], and the BRANCHENSERVICE [branch service] 
once a month; the Ifo DIGEST in English four times a year; 
studies; and SPIEGEL DER WIRTSCHAFT [Economic Mirror] annually. 
  Oppenlaender appears content with the devlopment of Ifo 
itself. In 1993, its budget rose by 6.5 percent to almost 28 
million German marks [DM]. Of this amount, DM11.7 million were 
earned by surveys. Thus the institute achieves an outside funds 
ratio of 42 percent. Only the DIW can show a similarly good 
result (43 percent); IfW, HWWA, RWI, and IWH lag far behind. 
<H5>  Forty-two Percent of Revenues Earned by Surveys </H5>
  The basic subsidy, shared by the Federal Government and 
Bavaria, amounted to DM13 million in 1993. In absolute terms, 
the institute received noticeably less than IfW, HWWA, and DIW, 
and more than RWI and IWH. Per staff member (DM58,000), however, 
Ifo costs the public authorities the least. Overall, 223 people 
work in the institute; 105 of them are scientists. 
  The federal economics minister is the largest client of Ifo; 
in 1993 he commissioned surveys for DM3.3 million. The EU 
[European Union] Commission is becoming more and more important. 
Yet the orders from Brussels are less lucrative than others, 
since the Commission frequently finances only 50 percent of the 
cost of surveys. If Oppenlaender cannot find a cofinancer, he 
accepts only subjects of scientific interest. 
  In general, competitors from Great Britain and France have a 
better "old boys' network" in Brussels, and furthermore, British 
institutes are less expensive, complains the Ifo chief. In 
addition, there is competition from business consultants such as 
Price-Waterhouse or McKinsey. To improve the position in the 
EU-wide competition, in 1990 Ifo merged with six European 
economic research institutes in the Ereco consortium. 
  Not least of all because of the intensive work with 
enterprises, Ifo is less exposed to economic policy disputes. 
Between regulative and distribution politicians, supply and 
demand orientation, "we hoe a middle line," says Oppenlaender. 
The division of tasks is clear: "Our goal is also advising 
policymakers, but they must set priorities--we only point up the 
alternatives."

  [Excerpt] Paris, April 25 (AFP) -- France condemned Monday 
[25 April] the recent bomb attacks in South Africa saying that 
it hopes the incidents will not set back the democratic process 
in that country. 
  "We condemn these irresponsible incidents and their authors 
who are trying to scuttle the South African political process to 
which nearly all the parties have lent their support," Foreign 
Ministry Spokesman Richard Duque said. 
  Duque was reacting to a bombing campaign in recent days by 
suspected white extremists opposed to the country's first 
all-race elections this week. [passage omitted]

<F P=106> [Report by Jean-Louis Lemarchand: "UDF and RPR Demonstrate </F>
Their Faith in Europe"] 
  [Text] The show given at the CDS [Social Democratic Center] 
congress this weekend would have delighted Jean Lecanuet, its 
founding father. In his "good city" of Rouen, on the same 
platform, the most eminent leaders of the majority -- 
neo-Gaullists, Liberals, and Social Democrats -- vied with each 
other in enthusiastically professing their faith in Europe. 
  With 50 days to go before the European election, the RPR 
[Rally for the Republic] and UDF [French Democratic Union] 
clearly defined their course of action. It boils down to one 
word: unity. The bitterness aroused in the RPR and PR 
[Republican Party] by the defeat of Jean-Francois Deniau as head 
of the majority's single list has been forgotten. All energies 
are mobilized in the leaderships to enable Dominique Baudis to 
achieve the best possible vote on 12 June. "Dominique," PR 
President [and Industry Minister] Gerard Longuet said, "we did 
not campaign for you, but we will mobilize in support of your 
list without bitterness or ulterior motives." The same 
enthusiasm was expressed by Alain Juppe [foreign minister and 
RPR secretary general]: The RPR is committed "with sincerity, 
good faith, and dynamism." 
  Inspired by a desire for effectiveness, the two majority 
partners chose to say nothing during the campaign about their 
real disagreements on Europe: a Europe of nations defended by 
the RPR, a federal Europe with a president desired by the CDS. 
Between now and 12 June, the RPR and UDF leaders will therefore 
strive, especially during their planned big rallies (Toulouse, 
Strasbourg, and Paris), to "reconcile the French people with 
Europe." Europe? "A great opportunity for France," in Gerard 
Longuet's view. And Alain Juppe replied: "France needs a 
strong Europe." 
  In this context, [Justice Minister] Pierre Mehaignerie also 
wanted the majority "not to be unaware of those who voted 
against Maastricht" and called for "intelligent safeguards" at 
the gates of the European Union. This is a way of holding out a 
hand to the RPR and UDF voters tempted by Philippe de Villiers' 
list. In the same sphere, Dominique Baudis said that Europe 
should be able to protect its jobs, for instance in the 
aeronautics industry, by resisting the Americans in the coming 
10 months of "very tough" negotiations. 
  But a defensive attitude is not enough. European 
construction, Centrist Jacques Barrot exclaimed, must serve as a 
lever to build "an upright, influential, and masterful France." 
And its main objective must be employment, Valery Giscard 
d'Estaing strongly emphasized, hinting that the European 
institutions "would have done better to devote more energy to 
employment and less to expansion." 
  Now that the message of unity and hope has been launched, 
the 
majority party leaderships will resume their detailed diplomatic 
work to draw up the list of 87 candidates to be submitted to the 
voters on 12 June.

<F P=106> [Report by Blanca Riemer, special Washington correspondent: </F>
"Alphandery Vaunts French Economic Situation to G-7"] 
  [Excerpt] The finance ministers of the seven most highly 
industrialized countries (G-7), accompanied by the governors of 
their respective central banks, met late yesterday in Washington 
on the eve of the traditional spring meetings of the IMF and 
World Bank. Three main subjects were discussed: the problem of 
the increase in long-term interest rates in the wake of the 
gradual increase in interest rates in the United States; the 
question of how to follow up support to Russia following the 
IMF's financing worth 10 billion francs; and the functioning of 
the international capital markets. On his journey to 
Washington, French Economy Minister Edmond Alphandery once again 
expressed satisfaction at the French economic picture, which he 
was preparing to explain in detail to his interlocutors. 
  All the economic indicators in France "are moving in the 
right direction," Edmond Alphandery stressed, and the recovery 
is all the stronger because it is being led by all components of 
demand: better export performance, investment spending, the 
construction of houses, and household consumption. The economy 
minister thinks that the official growth forecasts of 1.4 
percent "now look rather cautious" to several economic bodies. 
"Some think that we should exceed that figure," he pointed out. 
To achieve that, three factors would have to be present: an 
increase in the rate of exports thanks to an improvement in the 
international environment; a stronger resumption of investment; 
and a rebuilding of stocks. [passage omitted]

<F P=106> [Unattributed report: "The Nation's Accounts: 1993, the </F>
Black Year"] 
  [Text] In 1993, France experienced the strongest recession 
since World War II with a fall in its GDP of 1 percent, which is 
even worse than economic analysts had forecast, according to the 
annual figures published yesterday by INSEE [National Institute 
of Statistics and Economic Studies]. 
  You have to go back to 1975, the year following the first 
oil 
crisis, to find the previous recession in the French economy 
(minus 0.9 percent). France has only been in recession twice 
since World War II. 
  In February, the INSEE was still expecting a 0.7-percent 
drop 
in GDP for 1993. The gap between this and the figure of 1 
percent published on Friday [22 April] can be explained by the 
fact that the recession was stronger than expected at the end of 
1992, which meant that 1993 started with a bigger deficit. 
Moreover, 1993 seems to be the lowest point of a cycle which 
began back in mid-1990. However, this figure of 1 percent is 
merely an annual average: The recession ended in the spring [of 
1993] and GDP has not fallen any further since then. 
  The crisis did not spare any sphere of activity last year. 
The fall was particularly sharp in manufacturing production, 
which dropped by 5.3 percent in volume. In the BTP [public 
buildings and works sector], the fall was 3.9 percent in volume, 
and service activities fell by 1.6 percent excluding the health 
sector. 
  Employment has paid a heavy price for the crisis. Following 
a net loss of 188,000 jobs in 1992, another 255,000 jobs were 
lost in 1993. Unemployment affected 11.6 percent of the working 
population on an annual average, in other words 2.9 million 
people. Employment reacted rather late to the resumption of 
activity in spring, the INSEE points out, and the deterioration 
in the job market only started to slow down in the summer. 
Since then, we have observed an increase in temporary and 
limited contracts. 
  Other major victims of the recession are government budgets, 
whose deficits increased despite contributions decided in the 
first months of the Balladur government. The financing 
requirements of public administration departments increased 
further, reaching 5.8 percent of GDP (412 billion francs [Fr]), 
compared with 3.9 percent in 1992 and 2.2 percent in 1991. At 
the same time, however, state levies on national wealth have 
increased from 43.6 percent in 1992 to 44 percent in 1993. 
  The increase in the CSG [general social contribution] and in 
property taxes burdened the income (after tax) of the French 
people. The growth in their income slowed down markedly, going 
from a 4.7-percent increase in 1992 to a 3-percent increase in 
1993, in other words, an increase in real purchasing power of 
only 0.6 percent taking inflation into account (2.1 percent and 
falling). In the course of 1993, households began to dip into 
their savings to maintain a certain level of consumption. 
  But, despite this change in behavior, consumption only 
increased by 0.4 percent in volume, the lowest increase recorded 
for 30 years. In the years of strong growth, consumption 
increased at a rate of 3 percent per year. Last year, the fall 
was particularly noticeable in the automobile sector, the 
clothing sector, and tobacco. Businesses reduced their stocks 
on a huge scale. Finally, exports fell by 0.4 percent in volume 
(while imports fell by 3.1 percent). 
  Contrary to the devastating effect it had on the state's 
coffers, the crisis has not emptied those of business. The 
reduction in investments and erosion of stocks have "helped to 
considerably improve the overall financial situation of 
businesses," INSEE stresses. Thus, for the second year, they 
have an overall financing capability. The banks have also come 
out well thanks to the good performance of their market 
activities, boosted by the intense activity of the foreign 
exchange markets and the high interest rates. In addition, the 
banks distributed less credit and were thus able to continue to 
improve their margins. Thanks to the improvement in their 
financial situation, the banks were easily able to cover the 
risks linked in particular to the property market and industry's 
problems. 
  In all, France has the money, even if the imbalances in its 
distribution have increased. According to the INSEE, the 
country's financing capacity amounted to Fr77 billion last year.

<F P=106> [Interview with Jean Syrota, General Nuclear Materials </F>
Company [COGEMA] chief executive officer [CEO], by Elisabeth 
Rochard; place and date not given: "Syrota's Pro-Nuclear Plea"] 
  [Text] [Rochard] COGEMA is making profits which are 
enviable in the current economic climate, and at a time when the 
nuclear sector is losing momentum around the world. How do you 
explain this situation? 
  [Syrota] It is not true to say that the nuclear sector is 
losing momentum. Installed nuclear power continues to rise, 
even if it is rising less quickly than in the past decade. 
Moreover, a not inconsiderable number of countries have nuclear 
programs in development, especially in the Far East: Japan, 
South Korea, Taiwan, etc. However, they are not the only ones. 
We must not forget China, which has a formidable number of 
nuclear facilities to be built. Recently, Ukraine decided to 
terminate construction work on its VVER [water-cooled 
water-moderated] plants (with a design similar to reactors used 
in the West), which had been halted after the Chernobyl 
accident. In fact, it is the building of new electricity 
production facilities that is being victimized by overequipping 
and overly poor growth in economic activity. The nuclear sector 
is doing rather better than the others. Thus, for Japan, the 
United States, western Germany, and France taken all together, 
two-thirds of installed power between 1983 and 1992 was nuclear. 
  [Rochard] Perhaps, but virtually all new electricity plants 
built in the world in the last few years have been coal or gas 
plants. For more than 10 years, the United States has not begun 
construction of a new nuclear plant, and if it acquired 
additional nuclear capacity, it stems from projects that were 
begun 15 or even 20 years ago. 
  [Syrota] Of course, but that simply means, as you say, that 
the growth in electricity production in all of the 
industrialized countries is losing momentum. To get back to the 
COGEMA results, I think that they are good, but we must be able 
to do better. Our ambition is to reach 3.5 percent net 
profitability in the coming years. The situation of our 
"mining" activity is better than before, but it is still far 
from satisfactory. As for the reprocessing branch, activity 
will increase in the coming years, and this should be reflected 
in the results. COGEMA's advantage is that its market does not 
depend much on the current economic climate. However, the poor 
growth in electricity consumption is slowing the construction of 
new plants, which will make our sales more difficult in the long 
term in a market with slowing growth. 
  [Rochard] COGEMA is active in plutonium recycling. Are you 
not expecting a halt to be put to this under pressure from the 
United States, which does not have a civilian plutonium 
industry, and with the excuse of combating proliferation? Japan 
has recently frozen its reprocessing program in this way. 
  [Syrota] I do not agree with your analysis: Let us look at 
the most recent events. In Great Britain, the Thorp 
reprocessing plant has just been put into service, despite 
protests and actions taken in courts by antinuclear activists. 
If there was intervention, it was not effective. I prefer to 
think that there was not any. 
  Another example can be found in Belgium. This is a very 
interesting case, because Belgium's percentage of electricity of 
nuclear origin is very high, almost as high as in France. In 
addition, Belgium was the first country in the world to 
manufacture MOX fuel (a fuel in which plutonium replaces 
enriched uranium as the fissile material). For more than 20 
years, the fuel has been produced under conditions which are 
satisfactory from all points of view. As we recently began 
reprocessing their used fuel in our UP3 plant in La Hague, 
Belgian electricity industries asked their government for 
authorization to load their reactors with MOX fuel by recycling 
their plutonium. The government said yes provided that 
Parliament approved it. So an in-depth debate was held in which 
the issues of reprocessing and nuclear energy in general were 
raised. The Belgian Parliament voted by a very large majority in 
favor of using MOX, as well as in favor of pursuing reprocessing 
contracts. There, too, reason won the day. 
  As for Japan, it has not frozen its reprocessing program at 
all. So what has happened? Every five years Japan reviews its 
long-term energy program. It then makes adjustments based on 
the most recent economic situation and new prospects. The fast 
breeder reactor to follow in the footsteps of Monju will be 
built, but later than planned, with a delay of some 10 years. 
However, it is interesting to point out that the Monju fast 
breeder reactor, which is the same size as Phenix, is currently 
being started up. The Japanese are developing fast breeder 
reactor technologies because they think that they will be of 
interest in coming decades and play an important role in the 
future electronuclear sector. Similarly, they have begun 
construction of the Rokkashomura reprocessing plant, which is 
comparable to the UP3 plant in La Hague, with a capacity of 800 
tonnes per year. Compared to us, the Japanese are lagging 
behind in this domain, but they are catching up and it seems to 
me that their ambitions in the nuclear sector are still just as 
strong. 
  [Rochard] So in your opinion, Japan is not calling its 
nuclear program into question, and while it may be slowing down, 
it is only doing so to adapt to demand? 
  [Syrota] Exactly. I can confirm this for you, following a 
two-week trip I made to Japan a month ago, during which I met 
not only electricity industrialists, but also Mr. Eda, the 
minister in charge of nuclear power. 
  [Rochard] Do you think that China will begin building new 
nuclear plants? 
  [Syrota] I do not see how China can do without them. China's 
economy is growing rapidly, at more than 10 percent per year. 
Today, its main source of energy is low-grade coal used under 
poor conditions. With a per capita income that is still low, 
China is already one of the biggest emitters of carbon dioxide 
in the world. I heard the reknown scientist Georges Charpak 
[Nobel Prize winner] explain on television that the Chinese 
would have to give priority to developing their nuclear industry. 
  [Rochard] The plutonium industry in itself bears the risk of 
nuclear arms proliferation. Do you not think that this risk is 
greater than the advantages linked to reprocessing? 
  [Syrota] Surely not. Atomic bombs can be made without 
plutonium: remember Hiroshima. So how are proliferation 
problems shaping up? There is currently a lot of talk about 
North Korea. Before that, it was Iraq, Pakistan, India, South 
Africa, Israel, and a few others. How did these countries try 
to get or how did they get the bomb? In two ways. Some tried 
to produce military-quality uranium, while others tried to 
produce military-quality plutonium. In the first instance, it 
was via an illegal uranium enrichment facility. That is what 
the Iraqis and South Africans did, undoubtedly with the help of 
foreign technologies. Plutonium-based proliferation requires 
under-irradiated fuel which must be discreetly removed from a 
nuclear reactor, and the plutonium must be separated from it in 
a secret reprocessing facility. 
  This is the important point: The only way to make 
military-quality plutonium, i.e., virtually pure fissile 
plutonium, is to have under-irradiated fuel available. If the 
fuel remains in the reactor for a long time, secondary reactions 
take place and the plutonium contains an ever increasing 
proportion of non-fissile isotopes. It then becomes unsuitable 
for use in bombs. Electricity companies are trying to obtain 
the greatest amount of electricity possible with their fuel for 
obvious economic reasons, even though the plutonium separated 
from these used fuels contains a lot of nonfissile plutonium. 
Moreover, electronuclear fuel reprocessing operations are under 
international control and they do not lie at the origin of any 
examples of known proliferation. 
  [Rochard] The Nonproliferation Treaty is to be renegotiated 
in 1995. What can be done to ensure that it is effective? 
  [Syrota] We must not miss the target. The problem to be 
solved is the control of illegal activities. Experience has 
shown that the International Atomic Energy Agency does not have 
problems controlling countries like France, Japan, or Great 
Britain, but does have problems trying to see what it wants in 
more suspect countries. I would reiterate that North Korea and 
Iraq signed the NPT [Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty]. We must 
do what is necessary so that the Agency can better control the 
reactors most likely to easily produce under-irradiated fuels, 
better detect illegal programs, and better supervise transfers 
of sensitive technology. 
  To this can be added a new problem: that of supervising 
military-quality uranium and plutonium from the upcoming 
dismantling of American and Russian weapons. One way of 
resolving this is to use this plutonium and uranium to produce 
electricity. Highly enriched uranium just needs to be diluted 
to make it into nuclear fuel. As for plutonium, it can be used 
to make MOX fuel because, whereas electronuclear plutonium is 
not suitable for making bombs, military-quality plutonium can, 
conversely, be used for electricity generation, and that is the 
most ecological way of destroying it. Unfortunately, the 
Americans, who are the first to be interested, do not have the 
appropriate industrial solutions. 
  [Rochard] Are you pleased with the decision to restart 
Superphenix as a research reactor, although this reactor was 
initially designed to make nuclear fuel "come full circle" and 
burn plutonium? 
  [Syrota] Fast breeder reactors can be justified by the fact 
that as they use plutonium, they make even more of it by 
transforming, at the same time, non-fissile uranium 238 into 
fissile plutonium 239. So this is one way of using natural 
uranium completely: The fast breeder reactor produces 40 to 50 
times as much energy with the same quantity of uranium as a 
light-water reactor. Superphenix was designed with a view to an 
upcoming shortage of uranium, and was made to run optimally on 
this basis. I am convinced that there will not be a shortage of 
uranium for a very long time. However, this does not mean that 
there is no interest in fast neutron reactors for the future, 
because fast neutron reactors have another advantage: They are 
capable of destroying atoms in the plutonium family (actinides) 
and they destroy plutonium's nonfissile isotopes much better 
than light-water reactors. This is one of the reasons why it is 
useful to put the Superphenix back into service. 
  [Rochard] Does Superphenix still constitute a major loss? 
  [Syrota] It required a very heavy investment which, like any 
other prototype, will not become profitable as such. Since the 
investment was made, the choice was either to put a halt to the 
program and lose everything, or to do what was decided. 
  [Rochard] After the Cadarache accident, Brice Lalonde 
denounced the inadequate safety demands, especially as regards 
those "sites which are beginning to age badly." Is there really 
a problem? 
  [Syrota] Extremely rigorous examinations are carried out to 
inspect the aging of facilities. The nuclear industry 
experiences the same problems as any other activity, be it 
chemicals, steelmaking, oil production, etc. However, our 
industry is subjected to far more meticulous supervision by the 
authorities: Nuclear operators undertake a vast number of checks 
and spend a lot of money to maintain their facilities and 
replace parts that need replacing. That is why, in my opinion, 
nuclear power should be reserved for those countries which know 
how to manage advanced technologies and who have the financial 
resources to do so. As far as developing countries are 
concerned, we may well fear that they will skimp on maintenance 
and safety requirements. We must not build nuclear plants just 
anywhere in the world. 
  [Rochard] Does China meet these requirements? 
  [Syrota] China needs nuclear resources so much that it will 
have to meet these requirements. With the growth rate of its 
economy, it should have the necessary resources and not succumb 
to the temptation to make the savings which I fear. 
  [Rochard] Given the state of the nuclear sector in eastern 
Europe, the world is still sitting on a powder keg. Where do we 
really stand? 
  [Syrota] The main risk is Chernobyl-type plants in general, 
and Chernobyl in particular. They can be shut down. To do 
this, there is a solution which is technically simple: To save 
energy. Energy consumption in the countries of eastern Europe 
is so high because energy is virtually free there. If energy 
were billed at its true price, consumption would drop and there 
would no longer be any need for dangerous plants. 
  [Rochard] What is the impact of the freeze on nuclear 
testing 
for COGEMA? 
  [Syrota] COGEMA makes material for military use, but the 
trials themselves have very little impact on our order book. We 
no longer have any orders for military plutonium, which was 
produced in Marcoule, and orders for military uranium are also 
going to stop, but we do not know when. This is what worries 
our employees in Pierrelatte but, in any case, the plant will 
not shut down before the end of 1995, and it would not be until 
the second half of 1996 that employment problems would crop up. 
  [Rochard] Since you became the head of COGEMA in 1988, you 
have said that you would like to see more capital participation. 
You were talking more about financial establishments. Since 
then, Total has become your shareholder. Are you looking for 
other partners? Is the banking-insurance profile still up to 
date? 
  [Syrota] My answer to both those questions is yes. There are 
several types of potential partners for COGEMA: financial 
investors interested in the long-term regular profitability of 
our business; industrialists with whom we can develop synergies 
in our areas of activity, which is the case with Total; and, 
lastly, commercial partners. Here, we have electricity 
producers, especially those who do not have a nuclear fuel 
industry in their country. I definitely hope that something 
will happen in the next few months, but we cannot say anything 
until the agreements have been signed and all the go-aheads have 
been given.

<F P=106> [Interview with Italian Northern League leader Umberto Bossi </F>
by Carlo Brambilla in Milan; date not given: "Bossi Asks For 
More Ministries; Federalism Can Wait" -- first paragraph is 
L'UNITA introduction] 
  [Text] Milan -- The green light to [Forza Italia leader] 
Berlusconi as prime minister has been confirmed to [President] 
Scalfaro. Umberto Bossi [Northern League leader] returned 
immediately to Milan to inaugurate the League's "managerial 
school." Before giving the first "lesson" he sent a strong 
political message yesterday that is destined to weigh heavily in 
the battle over the division of seats in the government. 
"First," he said, "comes a stable government, then federalism." 
This is how he reached the crossroads. 
  [Brambilla] Senator Bossi, what did you say to the president 
of the republic? 
  [Bossi] That we agree with Berlusconi being given the task 
because there is no way out, but we also highlighted the risks 
entailed by a decision of this kind. A person like him, who 
heads a strong economic empire, could find himself in an awkward 
situation daily, with all his personal and private interests, 
nothwithstanding his willingness and his capabilitites. 
Especially in view of the lack of specific laws concerning 
checks and balances. In addition, the Knight [Berlusconi 
nickname] has untried political forces behind him and thus he 
finds himself in an almost autocratic situation. 
  [Brambilla] What was Scalfaro's reply? 
  [Bossi] He seemed very receptive. The president has 
demonstrated that he is well aware of the risks involved. 
Especially because, I repeat, in Italy there is no form of 
"blind trust" and no law of guaranty. 
  [Brambilla] The countdown has started. How do you intend 
bringing the League into the government? 
  [Bossi] The battle begins on Wednesday.... We want 
controlling positions to ensure that democracy does not fall 
apart. This means that we will ask for important ministries. 
  [Brambilla] Roberto Maroni as deputy prime minister is not 
enough? 
  [Bossi] No, he is not enough. It would only be a small step. 
The problem of the ministries remains, especially the Interior 
Ministry: That must go to the League. If it were to go to 
somebody from Forza Italia that would be like assigning the task 
pro tempore to Berlusconi. 
  [Brambilla] Your request for the Interior Ministry has been 
noted. In the past few days you have made it clear that would 
you like to control four ministries overall and, in addition, 
coordinate the agricultural sector. Could this be the list: 
Interior Ministry, Treasury, Industry Ministry, plus one more? 
Is this right? 
  [Bossi] More or less.... 
  [Brambilla] Is the last one unknown? There is talk of Post 
and Telecommunications.... 
  [Bossi] I am only saying that it will be a big surprise. 
  [Brambilla] A lot of names are being circulated.... 
  [Bossi] There has been no talk of names to date. However I 
think that the ministers should all have one characteristic: If 
possible, they must be politicians from the majority political 
parties and not tied to the old regime. Now is not the time for 
technocrats, who would inevitably receive their input from 
Berlusconi. 
  [Brambilla] What about [Radical leader] Marco Pannella? 
  [Bossi] The Pannella problem does not exist because he will 
have no job. 
  [Brambilla] What about the rumors regarding [Police Chief] 
Parisi? 
  [Bossi] This story about the police chief is not clear to 
me. I do not understand.... 
  [Brambilla] Will Dini [Bank of Italy Director General] also 
find access to the Treasury blocked? 
  [Bossi] I repeat: We are against technocrats.... 
  [Brambilla] What fundamental role will the League play in 
the 
government? 
  [Bossi] With their votes the people stated that they wanted 
a 
stable government and we must guarantee this. After an overdose 
of instability for years, the citizens decided that a stable 
government is for the good of all, a good that surpasses any 
other possible type of change proposed, including federalism. 
This is a paradox because we got this far precisely in order to 
change... 
  [Brambilla] Federalism can wait then? 
  [Bossi] For the moment the League will join the 
government.... After that, the day after, months after, some 
time after, when the League has shown that it is a force in 
government, all the old values of change, like federalism, will 
reemerge and they will finally become a common heritage.

<F P=106> [Interview with National Alliance leader Gianfranco Fini by </F>
Federico Guiglia in Rome; date not given: "Fascism Ended With 
Mussolini"] 
  [Excerpt] [passage omitted] [Guiglia] Silvio Berlusconi 
[Forza Italia leader] has announced that a "guarantor" will be 
instituted. Are we to have a guardian angel for the prime 
minister? 
  [Fini] Absolutely not. The idea of having a "vigilante" 
stems from the fact that there will be no professional 
politicians at the Palazzo Chigi [government seat] and because a 
Left unleashed is insinuating that private interests will be 
intertwined with political activities. 
  [Guiglia] But who will guarantee the guarantor? 
  [Fini] Clearly one cannot think of making a law nor of 
"coming to an agreement on" a sentry-candidate here. It is a 
problem of political expediency; the leader of Forza Italia will 
have to indicate a person who will be neither a loyal 
collaborator nor a known adversary. However, the role of the 
guarantor in effectively separating economic and political 
acitivities will last a few days: from the formation of the new 
government up to the vote of confidence in parliament. Then it 
will be the government team that will guarantee [Forza Italia 
leader] Berlusconi's "transparency." 
  [Guiglia] Berlusconi wants to open up to the People's Party 
[PPI], the Pact for Italy, the autonomists. Do you not think 
that the Knight [Berlusconi nickname] is being a little too 
ecumenical. 
  [Fini] He is right to open up to others, but he must not do 
it in an indiscriminate way. There is only one central point: 
presenting himself to the entire, not individual members, will 
make opposition by certain moderate forces difficult. 
  [Guiglia] Andreatta [lower house floor leader] of the 
People's Party is turning the issue upside down by saying to 
Berlusconi: If we join, Fini must leave the executive. Do you 
fear that the alliance will be overturned? 
  [Fini] I bought a calender and an abacus for Andreatta. If 
he looks at the calender he will realize that he has 25 April 
mixed up with 25 March when the election campaign was in full 
swing. He will have an even more bitter shock with the abacus: 
Even by putting together the whole of the PPI [Italian People's 
Party], the Pact for Italy, the Republicans, Liberals, 
Socialists, pensioners, and housewives, Andreatta will not 
succeed in obtaining the number of parliamentarians that 
National Alliance has. And he will continue to suffer through 
this abstention from power. 
  [Guiglia] [Northern League leader] Bossi stated that 
federalism can wait. Is this a joke or a "major turning point" 
in the Northern League? 
  [Fini] I consider it to be a very wise move. I hope that it 
will be confirmed over the next few days when we draw up 
programs. The government must reconfirm its commitment to 
reforming the model of the state without proposing a compulsory 
institutional model. The whole of parliament must be called 
upon to discuss the rules of the game. Also, there must be a 
referendum in which the Italian people decide what sort of Italy 
they want. 
  [Guiglia] Are you not afraid of being politically squashed 
between Berlusconi and Bossi? 
  [Fini] Nobody can mistake National Alliance' responsible 
attitude for -- how can I put it? -- docility. We have decided 
not to raise controversies and push for this or that seat. 
Those who voted for us must know that we are going to govern 
and remain loyal to our commitments. Two in particular: the 
unity of Italy and solidarity between north and south. 
  [Guiglia] Bossi is laying claim to the Viminale [Interior 
Ministry]. What does Fini lay claim to? 
  [Fini] I lay claim to the right not to issue vetoes or 
prejudicial ultimatums over one or the other ministry. Bossi is 
wrong to do so because vetoes lead inevitably to the Cencelli 
manual [former Christian Democratic power-sharing method]. The 
prime minister will choose the ministers. 
  [Guiglia] How about [President] Scalfaro resigning: no, or 
not yet? 
  [Fini] No. The president is showing that he is capable of 
promoting the passage from the first to the second republic. 
  [Guiglia] According to Nolte, the German historian, you are 
set to become "Mussolini's modern heir" by proposing 
"nontotalitarian fascism." Do you subscribe to this analysis? 
  [FIni] That just shows historians do not always perceive 
political events correctly. There is no fascism, 
"constitutional" or otherwise, around the corner. Fascism was 
born, grew, and died with its creator Mussolini. I will soon go 
on a tour of Europe's capitals and the United States to explain 
the great Italian innovation called the National Alliance. 
Liberty and justice must be the cardinal values of the second 
republic and democracy the only means of affirming them.

<F P=106> [Interview with Gianfranco Miglio, Northern League </F>
ideologue, by Daniele Vimercati; place and date not given: 
"Miglio: `I Am Already Writing the Federal Constitution'" -- 
first paragraph is IL GIORNALE introduction] 
  [Text] The grand old man of federalism is not concerned 
about the newspaper headlines. "I have read them, they say that 
[Northern League secretary] Bossi is saying goodbye to 
federalism...nonsense." Gianfranco Miglio is convinced that the 
lastest remarks made by the secretary have not changed the 
League's policy. Yet everybody heard those statements saying 
that federalist reform will be postponed a little because the 
first need is the people's "desire for government." The 
professor [Miglio] replies: "What does that have to do with it; 
Bossi's words were precise and measured; it takes a brazen face 
to interpret them as renouncing and abandoning federalism." A 
benevolent interpretation of Bossi's remarks? "Not at all," is 
his prompt reply, "even [Forza Italia leader] Berlusconi agrees 
with what he says." 
  [Vimercati] Excuse me, but how do you know? 
  [Miglio] Because the Knight [Berlusconi nickname] called me 
and told me what he thinks. 
  [Vimercati] Which is? 
  [Miglio] He listened to what Bossi said and took his words 
for what they were: a go-ahead on moves to relaunch the 
economy, a strong warning on the League's decision to put 
federalism back in the center of the government's action. 
  [Vimercati] In the center, but tomorrow, as we say. That is 
how problems are usually set aside. 
  [Miglio] By the old political system perhaps. But certainly 
not by us. Berlusconi realizes this; he told me that he is 
ready to accede to our demands and is enthusiastic that he found 
us receptive to the problems of recovery. We will soon talk 
about these problems. We must meet... 
  [Vimercati] Did you not fear, not even for a moment, that 
your plan for a federal Italy would be submerged forever? 
  [Miglio] Never, absolutely not. It would be suicide for the 
League. Even Bossi told me: "I would not be so stupid to commit 
suicide in this way." 
  [Vimercati] But a certain delay, at least, is foreseeable? 
  [Miglio] I have always declared myself ready to write a 
federal constitution in 90 days. I repeat this. I have already 
started working. 
  [Vimercati] Do you also fear, as Bossi does, the great power 
of Berlusconi? 
  [Miglio] Let us say that rules are needed to prevent him 
from 
getting government action mixed up with his own personal 
business interests. First let us say that I do not agree with 
the idea of assigning him the Interior Ministry pro tempore. I 
will tell him this when I see him. A new man is needed there. 
  [Vimercati] For example? 
  [Miglio] The League has already decided: [League number two] 
Roberto Maroni. 
  [Vimercati] Are you not afraid of ambushes in such a 
delicate ministry? 
  [Miglio] There is that danger but I think that Roberto will 
succeed in avoiding the pitfalls especially if our proposal is 
accepted. 
  [Vimercati] Which is? 
  [Miglio] Removing the control of the secret service from the 
ministry's jurisdiction. 
  [Vimercati] Let us get back to guarantees over Berlusconi's 
role. What do you say about the idea of assigning the role of 
guarantor to somebody like [Senator] Spadolini for example? 
  [Miglio] Heaven help us! What need is there to invent other 
nonsense like this? Frankly, this idea seems quite odd. I have 
not discussed this with anybody, but I ask myself where all this 
frenzied activity to find a position for Spadolini comes from. 
  [Vimercati] Perhaps it is just to compensate him for the bad 
joke you played on him in the Senate? 
  [Miglio] That was no joke, it was a solemn democratic 
bashing. Look, with all the friendship I have for Spadolini, the 
best I could wish for him would be a kind of hibernation. Yes, 
he should be put away in the refrigerator as my wife recently 
did with the kid meat. 
  [Vimercati] A life member of the Senate like kid meat? 
  [Miglio] What I mean is that this country can survive even 
without Spadolioni. And anyway, I do not like this idea of 
placing somebody above the prime minister. It means putting him 
under guardianship, preventing him from carrrying out his job in 
government. In short, castrating him. 
  [Vimercati] Then how will you pare the businessman-prime 
minister's finger nails? 
  [Miglio] An advanced democracy must be able to achieve this 
objective by laying down an institutional procedure, with 
objective and general limits. No single man is needed: We have 
already seen how the publishing guarantor failed. 
  [Vimercati] What about yourself, professor, what role do you 
hope to cut out for yourself in the second republic? 
  [Miglio] There was talk of assigning me the Institutional 
Reform Ministry, but I am not concerned about these matters. I 
restrict my action to observing, studying, suggesting. There 
will be a recovery, perhaps even a boom, under the Berlusconi 
government because those wanting to make investments will find 
fertile ground before them. However, this energy will be wasted 
if there is no new state. That is why the issue of federalism 
will reemerge very quickly. 
  [Vimercati] Let us keep to the present, today is 25 April: 
Do you agree with the League's decision to be present? 
  [Miglio] I have three ideas regarding the Resistance 
Movement: first, we have foreign armed forces to thank for the 
final result, not the Italians, otherwise the neofascists would 
have won; second, it was a batttle for individual liberty; 
third, as with all civil wars, it brought with it a great deal 
of personal revenge. 
  [Vimercati] But what does this day mean to you personally? 
  [Miglio] I was in the Resistance movement, but with the 
Catholic groups. I do not like the Left's attempts to use this 
anniversary as a means of political revenge. You can be 
anti-Fascist without being a leftist.

<F P=106> [Unattributed interview with Senator Livio Caputo, Forza </F>
Italia foreign affairs spokesman; place and date not given: 
"This Is Their Passport to Europe"] 
  [Text] Rome -- The Osimo treaties must not be annulled but, 
rather, reviewed. "They have been overtaken by events," Livio 
Caputo, Forza Italia senator responsible for foreign affairs, 
explained. "The federative Republic of Yugoslavia no longer 
exists: Slovenia and Croatia's claim to inherit the Osimo treaty 
without any amendments is countered by the fact that they 
already breached the treaty themselves by splitting the Italian 
community in Istria and setting up a border along the Dragonja 
river." 
  [IL GIORNALE] Is this the only violation? 
  [Caputo] Another violation is the failure to pay 
eleven-thirteenths of the compensation for property seized from 
the exiles, which, in our view, must be returned. 
  [IL GIORNALE] The Italian Government has begun 
negotiations... 
  [Caputo] Yes, but by tolerating that this [blank space in 
original] bounce back and would next day take back the -- 
actually very small -- concessions made the previous day. These 
delaying tactics aimed at burying the problem must be stopped. 
The new government will look at [Slovenian President] Kucan and 
[Croatian President] Tudjman's maps. 
  [IL GIORNALE] Today Italian exiles cannot even buy back 
their 
homes... 
  [Caputo] We must review those laws on real estate which 
prevent the victims of that early ethnic cleansing from 
recovering their property, even if this involves paying. It is 
perfectly legitimate for Italy to make use of its chance to 
block Slovenia's and Croatia's application for membership in the 
European Union until they decide to behave like good Europeans 
instead of maintaining the practices of a Communist regime that 
no longer exists and that they have disowned [blank space in 
original]. 
  [IL GIORNALE] Are the borders untouchable or not? 
  [Caputo] The border issue is a real one. One part of the 
territories which we had to give up at the end of the war is 
historically Italian, just as Alsace-Lorraine remained French 
even when it belonged to Germany, or eastern Prussia is 
historically German even though it now belongs to Russia. There 
are no immutable borders in history, especially in frontier 
areas like Istria and Dalmatia. Even international law allows 
for borders to be reviewed through diplomatic channels with the 
agreement of the parties involved. 
  [IL GIORNALE] But there is no such agreement. 
Alsace-Lorraine and eastern Prussia's borders were changed by 
the war... 
  [Caputo] The future majority [blank space in original] 
problem, clearly it will only be solved in the context of peace, 
possibly though the creation of cross-border regional 
structures, or perhaps through self-determination procedures. 
  [IL GIORNALE] Self-determination by Serbian Krajina, in 
Croatia, led to war. 
  [Caputo] Italy is simply doing the same as Japan, which is 
refusing to fully reestablish normal relations with Russia until 
a satisfactory solution can be found to the Kuril islands 
problem. 
  [IL GIORNALE] Should Osimo be annulled? 
  [Caputo] I believe we missed the train. The request for 
annulment should have been made when Slovenia and Croatia were 
recognized. We must take one step at a time.

<F P=106> [Commentary by Bernardo Valli: "Unavoidable Choice"] </F>
  [Text] NATO had no other choice. Its stern ultimatum to 
the Serbs was unavoidable. The delay in issuing it had a very 
high, intolerable, human cost, but perhaps the consequences 
entailed in NATO's decision demanded such a long period of 
reflection. Now, however, the people of Gorazde can no longer be 
abandoned to General Mladic's gangs. Their fate is, and has 
been for some time, closely bound to the credibility of the top 
international bodies and the major democracies. It is for this 
very reason that an ultimatum, in practice, an order for an 
immediate cease-fire, was issued. By its inflexibility it seeks 
to compensate for blameworthy delays and reveals anger and 
outrage not entirely due to the human tragedy. 
  The Serbs tried to conceal the bloodshed, prevented 
television cameras from entering the besieged city, and it is 
likely that the absence of pictures of the massacre reduced the 
level of people's feelings and thus public pressure, especially 
in America, which was very strong during the earlier tragedy in 
Sarajevo. General Mladic was thus able to gain time. In his 
haste, the Serbian leader nevertheless failed to realize that, 
by so obviously defying NATO, by humiliating the military 
alliance on which the United States bases its leadership in 
Europe and a large part of its image worldwide, he was prompting 
an inevitable response. General Mladic is a man with a 
primitive audacity who, like many of his contemporaries, has 
learned to calculate time according to the television yardstick. 
After the two NATO incursions on 10 and 11 April he waited a 
few hours, long enough for two or three CNN news broadcasts, 
then resumed his assault. He thought that the West, headed by 
the Americans, had abandoned their arduous task of halting his 
men on the outskirts of Gorazde. 
  In fact he had good reasons for believing so. His belief 
rested on several precedents. But this time Mladic went too 
far, and he did not receive a warning from television. He 
failed to realize that, by dropping those four bombs in two 
incursions on 10 and 11 April, NATO took an important change of 
course. Having acted for 45 years as a deterrent shield against 
the Soviet Union -- almost half a century without ever firing a 
single cannon shot -- on that occasion the Atlantic alliance 
became an offensive mechanism. Those four little bombs in April 
had a great political significance. As LE MONDE put it, having 
been a shield, NATO became a sword. Mladic took it for a tin 
sword. A comical sword. The Serbs laughed at it and continued 
bombarding Gorazde. And the whole world laughed with them, 
mixing tears for the dead and wounded, nowhere to be seen on 
television, with laughter for the disgraceful showing by 
Clinton's America (people stopped laughing at Europe some time 
ago). 
  European diplomatic and military officials involved in 
discussing what stance to adopt in Bosnia with their American 
counterparts say that in recent days the latter "became 
monsters." They stubbornly insisted on the need to salvage 
NATO's credibility, readily admitting that the United States' 
own credibility was at stake too. The United States decided some 
time ago to continue performing a crucial role on the Old 
Continent, via NATO, by providing it with the decisive means for 
essential air cover. That is, without obligatorily deploying 
land troops, which would revive nightmares about Vietnam across 
the Atlantic. 
  The French and British, anxious about their men in Bosnia, 
tried to curb America's anger by pointing to the dangers that 
the blue helmets would face if NATO bombarded General Mladic's 
troops and guns. The latter would not hesitate to take them 
hostage, and probably even he would be unable to prevent his 
troops from taking savage reprisals against isolated UNPROFOR 
units within easy reach. 
  In the past such arguments stifled UN and NATO plans for 
intervention amid uncertainties. This time, however, the 
Americans dragged the reluctant Europeans with them by force; 
some of the Europeans, under irresistible American pressure, 
subsequently decided to speak out in favor of the ultimatum to 
the Serbs even before the NATO meeting in Brussels. Better to 
appear the promoters of the enterprise rather than to be accused 
of cowardice by an over-excited public. In an attempt to tame 
the American "monsters," the Europeans used even Russia's 
rumblings. Actually, the Russians did more shouting than 
grumbling in the European capitals. They often raised their 
voices in an attempt to show that air incursions against the 
Bosnian Serb troops would kindle Slav and Orthodox patriotism 
within Moscow's parliament, creating difficulties for the 
already beleaguered Boris Yeltsin. In order to divert the 
Europeans from their intent, Russian diplomats insistently 
pointed to the reassuring "promises" given by Clinton to Yeltsin 
by telephone. But the Americans convinced the Europeans that 
the Russians must not be taken too literally and that they 
should be reassured but not heeded at this stage in their 
history. Furthermore, Yeltsin had dissociated himself 
considerably from the Serbs. He had essentially displayed 
salutary common sense, partly dictated by the need for Western 
economic aid and the desire to save energies to be devoted to 
more vital crises. That in Ukraine, for instance. 
  So General Mladic was misled by Clinton's innocent face as 
it 
appeared on CNN. He thought that NATO had abandoned its 
endeavor and that the Serbs could calmly massacre and "win the 
war." Instead, the war has suddenly been further complicated. 
It is acquiring a different pace and a different dimension. 
What are they? It is possible to question the effectiveness of 
an air intervention without the deployment of adequate ground 
troops. Indeed, with inadequate ground units that are in danger 
of being taken hostage. But these are the consequences that 
were pondered for so long -- though every hour cost human lives 
-- thus postponing the inevitable NATO ultimatum. There was no 
other choice. We knew it. Perhaps General Mladic too will 
realize it before tonight's midnight deadline.

<F P=106> [Article by Luigi Irdi and Tonino Satta: "Will This Formula </F>
Make Everyone Happy?"] 
  [Text] The free-market theories of the Right are going to 
be put to the test. Health care for pay, private schools, and 
more jobs (but for lower wages): This is the formula that the 
government will use in an attempt to save Italy, amid a thousand 
uncertainties. 
  Ladies and gentlemen, here is the first government of the 
Right, at your service. After 50 years of a centrism that 
oscillated from slightly on the right to way over on the left, 
the 27 March elections signaled the triumph of laissez-faire 
capitalism, postfascism, Berlusconiism (as a life style), and 
Legaism. 
  Moreover, it is this mixture--which the Knight of Arcore 
[Berlusconi] is attempting (with no little difficulty) to 
compound--that will govern the fifth greatest industrial power 
in the world during the coming years and profoundly alter even 
the nation's constitutional principles. 
  It is impossible to know where all this will lead. L'EUROPEO 
has attempted to ascertain the specific sectors in which the new 
Italian Right will take its initial steps in the process of 
governing. 
<H5>  Ten Questions </H5>
  1. The Right, which openly advocates free-market capitalism, 
must necessarily make an in-depth investigation of the welfare 
state. What measures might the government take initially with 
respect to health care and pensions, for example? 
  Following an election campaign during which the victorious 
coalition warned voters of the dangers of "Occhetto-style 
statism," Silvio Berlusconi and his partners (friends? 
comrades?) will be expected to provide immediate proof of their 
allegiance to the free-market system. 
  According to the official programs, health care and pensions 
are already targets of the government of the Right. In the 
health care sector, the famous government-provided health care 
"bonus" [preceding word in English]--which each citizen could 
spend as he or she saw fit, either in hospitals or for a private 
insurance policy--has become mere fiction. In terms of pensions, 
the policy is to favor supplementary annuities and to raise the 
age of eligibility. 
  "The transition will be difficult, exhausting, and long," 
says economist Carlo Scognamiglio, who Berlusconi would like to 
have in his administration. There are other reasons for this 
absence of haste. The constituency of the Right includes many 
seniors, pensioners, and low-income public employees (one 
probable member of the cabinet, National Alliance Deputy Publio 
Fiori, based his career as an Andreotti partisan of long 
standing precisely on these categories of the electorate). 
Moreover, any abrupt cuts in social spending on the eve of the 
June European elections--which the Right expects will serve to 
confirm its approval rating--could be counterproductive. 
  "They will do nothing in the short term," predicts Emanuele 
Macaluso, leader [preceding word in English] of the most 
moderate wing of the PDS [Democratic Party of the Left]. "The 
government coalition will now consolidate its power by placing 
its people in key positions in order to secure control and 
establish new rules of the game. Then the dance will begin." 
  2. Could a government of the Right reopen the education 
controversy by providing de facto support for private schools? 
  The "good education" issue is also on the agenda. Parents 
will be able to decide whether to send their children to public 
schools or to private schools (meaning in effect Catholic 
schools, inasmuch as the overwhelming majority of private 
schools are staffed by nuns and priests). Moreover, Berlusconi 
attaches great importance to the support of the bishops and for 
months conducted an all-out campaign to obtain it. He is now 
beginning to harvest the fruits of that campaign, which range 
from the enthusiastic statements of Cardinal Silvio Oddi to the 
partial placet of CIVILTA CATTOLICA, the Jesuits' magazine. 
  As an item on the agenda, this issue will accordingly soon 
affect the equilibrium of the coalition and likewise Silvio 
Berlusconi's good relations with the ecclesiastical hierarchy 
(the Church has never liked pure laissez-faire capitalism). It 
is an obstacle that will not be easy to surmount, however. 
  The fact is that the Northern League actually envisions more 
radical solutions, as for example schools owned by the teachers 
themselves, who would operate them on a free-market basis ("It's 
crazy," Labor Minister Gino Giugni, an inflexible supporter of 
the public schools, exclaims. "How could teachers turn 
themselves overnight into stockholders and managers?" [preceding 
word in English]. For its part, the National Alliance remains 
committed to an educational system operated by the state. 
  "In my opinion, public education is preferable," says 
Domenico Fisichella, Gianfranco Fini's institutional theorist 
and candidate for the cabinet post (Public Education) that at 
one time was held by Benedetto Croce. 
  3. The Right has promised "lower taxes for everyone," but 
how 
can it keep this promise and simultaneously reform public 
finances? 
  "Simple," explains National Alliance Deputy Maurizio 
Gasparri. "The Laffer curve--which I could discuss at 
length--shows that by lowering taxes you increase state 
revenues. My butcher put it even more simply. In 1992," he said, 
"the state asked me for 12 million lire, and in 1993 for 19 
million. I didn't have it, and I didn't pay a single lira. If 
they come for me, I'll be the needle in the haystack.'" 
  So this is the theory: Reduce taxes, and you will have fewer 
tax evaders and a rehabilitated treasury. Here too, however, it 
appears that no one is in a hurry to keep a promise. Speaking on 
the RAI [Italian Broadcasting Corporation], General Luigi 
Ramponi of the National Alliance--who formerly headed SISMI 
[Intelligence and Military Security Service]--and Scognamiglio 
found themselves in agreement. "Bad news on the fiscal front," 
the rector of Luiss University said. "The deficit is soaring, 
and taxes can be reduced only if government spending is reduced 
and economic recovery takes place." How so? Wasn't tax reduction 
supposed to be the engine of recovery? 
  "With an average tax burden of 41 percent," Ramponi said, 
"we 
are within the European parameters, together with France and 
Great Britain. Less than that...." What is he saying? Isn't this 
the same argument that Luigi Spaventa, the Ciampi 
administration's budget minister, used to make? 
  "I believe that the government of the Right will sooner or 
later strike a surprise blow such as, for example, the 
imposition of a substantial withholding tax on bank deposits, 
passbook savings accounts, and checking accounts," Giorgio 
Benvenuto, the former secretary general at the Ministry of 
Finance, is willing to wager. "It will be a telling blow, one 
designed to meet the financial requirements of the state." 
  Antonio Martino, the principal economist of Forza Italia, 
denies the possibility of any such blow, however. He insists 
that the government will issue its decrees within the first 50 
days after taking office, and that the initial objective will be 
to convert 4 to 5 trillion lire of direct taxes into indirect 
taxes. 
  4. Expanded markets, more consumption, and more publicity: 
these supply the oxygen that Berlusconi's business interests 
breathe. But how will he be able to keep inflation under control? 
  "Berlusconi will take inflation to 10 percent," Giorgio 
Benvenuto predicts. Lower taxes mean that families will have 
more money; more money in circulation means increased demand for 
consumer goods, which in turn means rising prices and therefore 
inflation. 
  The plans of the future Berlusconi administration, however, 
do make allowance for a rise of several percentage points in the 
rate of inflation. "That would in no way be the end of the 
world," Maurizio Gasparri continues. "Inflation is low today not 
because it is controlled but because there is a recession." 
  On the other hand, Nobel Laureate Paul Samuelson and Roberto 
Artoni, professor at Milan's Bocconi University, foresee 
absolute catastrophe. "There is the danger that Italy's economy 
will be run in the Peronist manner," Samuelson warns, while 
Artoni points out that "inflationary policies work to the 
advantage of all debtors, public and private." Inasmuch as Italy 
has a national debt of 2 quadrillion lire and will be governed 
by an entrepreneur (Berlusconi) who is himself up to his ears in 
debt.... 
  Whether these doubts are valid or not, an inflation that is 
under control and a public debt that is once again managed 
rationally are conditions that Italy must fulfill in order to 
remain within the European sphere following the Maastricht 
treaty. 
  5. "One million jobs in two years." Is the Italian business 
community ready--as Berlusconi maintains--to hire young people, 
and under what conditions would it be able to do so? 
  "Let them try to fulfill their promise of 1 million jobs in 
two years," Labor Minister Gino Giugni comments sarcastically. 
"If they are lucky and the GDP increases to 3 percent, they will 
barely be able to come up with 400,000 jobs." 
  The confidence manifested by Berlusconi's people is based on 
the creation of a simplified and flexible labor market involving 
tax relief for firms that hire young people; the possibility of 
easier dismissals; term contracts; and lower entry-level wages 
for entrants to the labor market (whose counterparts in France, 
incidentally, formed the mobs of young people who in recent 
weeks took to the streets in that country). 
  In his comment, Communist Renewal Secretary Fausto 
Bertinotti 
gives full rein to his skepticism. "Berlusconi and the other 
groups of the Right are proposing things that already exist," he 
says. "Apprenticeships have been in existence since 1955, and 
labor training contracts for the past several years, but there 
are still 3 million unemployed. Spain has every version of these 
laws but continues to have an unemployment problem." 
  Moreover, if a businessman--in response to all these 
incentives--decides to hire additional employees only to dismiss 
them three months later and then perhaps repeat the three-month 
hiring and firing cycle at some later date, does this represent 
a genuine increase in employment or merely marginal adjustments 
in the unemployment rate? Berlusconi's principal adviser, 
Giuliani Urbani, was assigned the task of defending the 
proposal. "Before we set this goal," he said, "we polled 
thousands of businessmen to determine their availability." 
  6. Berlusconi's own business interests are one of the 
obstacles facing his administration. For example, what 
credibility will he have when--as a government official--he 
appoints the heads of the big banks to which he himself is in 
debt? 
  On this point--which is one of the most important of 
all--Silvio Berlusconi has offered no convincing arguments other 
than his personal assurances that he will conduct himself 
honorably. 
  The Italian people do not actually appear to be very 
concerned about this matter before the vote [for prime minister] 
is taken; but it is clear that as prime minister, Silvio 
Berlusconi will frequently find himself in an embarrassing 
position whenever his government has to sponsor legislation in 
many specific fields--such as telecommunications, antitrust 
[preceding word in English], and construction--or obtain greater 
financial disclosure by the companies that own soccer teams. 
  Here are two examples. The government appoints the heads of 
the big national banks, and Berlusconi is in debt to half of the 
Italian banking system. How dispassionately will he be able to 
make decisions? And the fact that he is part owner of a TV 
station in Germany (Telefuenf) and one in Spain (Telecinco) 
creates an embarrassing situation whereby the Italian prime 
minister will be in a position to influence the communications 
media of foreign countries. This is not viewed with favor in 
international circles. 
  "Only a mediocre person would allow himself to be influenced 
by his personal interests," says Giuseppe Tatarella, leader of 
the National Alliance deputies, "and you can say anything about 
Berlusconi except that he is a mediocrity." "Under this 
electoral system," National Alliance Deputy Gasparri adds, "if 
you misbehave, the voters will send you packing at the next 
election. That is your insurance policy." 
  7. In the euphoria of victory, tensions among allies are 
attenuated. But when controversial matters are at issue--such as 
reductions in force in the public sector and federalism--what 
will happen within the ranks of the majority? 
  On the day following the elections, all observers doubted 
that the Right would be able to form a coalition government, and 
yet Berlusconi appeared certain to get Gianfranco Fini and 
Umberto Bossi to reach an accord immediately. Not for nothing is 
he a supersalesman of special deals ("three for the price of 
two"), inasmuch as he even succeeded in palming off the National 
Alliance on the voters of the north who had chosen Forza Italia 
and the League, and in selling Bossi to the voters of the south 
who were planning to vote for Berlusconi and Fini. 
  Although the euphoria surrounding the sensational electoral 
victory made it possible to overcome many obstacles, it did not 
dispel the tensions within the coalition. 
  Despite everything, Umberto Bossi and Gianfranco Fini 
continue tirelessly to snipe at each other. "The coalition 
government will be formed, and it will be accompanied by an 
accord with respect to programs," Tatarella says. 
  It can be assumed that an accord will be reached. None of 
the 
partners [preceding word in English] can afford to cause the 
operation to fail: not Berlusconi, after spending many billions 
of lire to form a new party and become prime minister and after 
committing himself totally to this endeavor; not Fini, who is 
seeing his comrades return to the government after 50 years 
(someone pointed out sadly that the most recent fascist to have 
passed through Chigi Palace [office of the prime minister]--the 
former foreign minister of the Mussolini regime, Galeazzo 
Ciano--ended up being shot, exactly 50 years ago, by his 
father-in-law in Verona); and not Bossi either, who--if he gets 
out of line--will be judged responsible (in the eyes of his 
colleagues and his constituents) for wasting the opportunity to 
govern. All three have the need to govern. 
  8. What will become of the kickback scandal and the 
independence of the judiciary? Is a whitewash--disguised as a 
"political solution"--really in the offing? 
  These are hard times for the judges. One cannot forget that 
only a few weeks ago the probable new prime minister vehemently 
denounced Gherardo Colombo--one of the leading jurists in the 
Clean Hands pool [preceding word in English] in Milan--and that 
Tiziana Parenti (Berlusconi's choice for the post of justice 
minister) has attacked her colleagues with rancor and venom. 
  So far there has been no talk of a whitewash for the 
bribetakers. "I do not believe they [the coalition government] 
will do anything that would be so unpopular," says PDS Senator 
Massimo Brutti. "We must wait and see, however, whether they 
will really help the magistrates conduct all the trials with 
dispatch, for that means money, personnel, funds, and 
courtrooms--and the will to do what is necessary." 
  The other burning question relates to the independence of 
the 
judiciary. For example, the Right wants to "separate" the 
prosecutors from the judges who have the task of rendering 
verdicts. "This is one step away from subordination to the 
government's office of public prosecutor," says the former 
secretary of the National Association of Magistrates, Senator 
Raffaele Bertoni, a progressive. "Even fascism regarded this 
option as too risky," he adds. 
  But the new majority is determined to press forward on its 
chosen course. "The two professions must be separated," is the 
battle cry of Tiziana Parenti, who takes aim at a loftier 
target, the Higher Council of the Magistracy. "Let's reorganize 
the Council," Parenti says. "We've had our fill of politicized 
judiciaries." 
  This brings us, in fact, to the second point that disturbs 
the Left, namely the system for electing the Higher Council of 
the Magistracy. If the government majority is as strong and 
compact as predicted, it is already able--even without 
reorganization--to select all of the 10 "secular" members of the 
Council. In particular, this means that the government is 
indirectly in a position to exert a decisive influence on the 
selection of the heads of the most important judicial offices. 
  "The biggest unknown quantity is Berlusconi. The MSI 
[Italian 
Social Movement]-National Alliance and the Northern League have 
consistently endorsed the work of the judges, but Berlusconi has 
in fact never done so." [quotation marks as published] 
  9. For the first time in decades, the Interior Ministry--the 
heart of the state--will be in the hands of the Right. Should we 
fear that the police, the intelligence services, and the 
prefects will be used against the opposition? 
  "This is a hypothesis that I do not even want to take into 
consideration," PDS Senator Brutti says, "because we do not put 
intentions on trial. We shall find out along the way." "Nothing 
that is part of the state--including secret services and 
security forces--may be placed at the service of anyone in 
particular," Deputy Massimo D'Alema, leader of the PDS deputies, 
notes. "Governments come and go, but the guarantees remain." 
  The Rifondazione Comunista people disagree. "The Christian 
Democrats in the Palazzo Viminale [Interior Ministry] have 
worked against opposition groups in the past, and such an 
eventuality would therefore be nothing new," they say. "We do in 
fact anticipate a climate of greater repression of the most 
elementary rights." 
  The PDS people are cautious and the neocommunists of 
Rifondazione are prepared for the worst, but the words of the 
leading candidate for interior minister--the League's Roberto 
Maroni--are reassuring. "The people who do have something to 
fear," he says, "are those who during these past years have been 
involved in cover-ups. If I go to the Viminale, I will open all 
the closet doors and drag out all the skeletons: Piazza Fontana, 
the Italicus massacre, the Bologna railway station, and Ustica. 
We shall have the last laugh." We shall see. 
  Naturally, the closets that Maroni would like to open also 
contain the skeletons of the intelligence services. Umberto 
Bossi has never concealed his conviction that the intelligence 
services have conducted operations against the League that 
involved the use of unscrupulous tactics. 
  No matter who from the League becomes interior minister, 
however, overall control of the intelligence services will 
always be vested in the prime minister: that is to say, in 
Silvio Berlusconi. 
  10. In the past, the opposition has even been able to 
negotiate the choices of the majority. Now that there is genuine 
bipolarity, how will the government deal with an intransigent 
opposition? 
  "We need a genuine opposition," National Alliance Deputy 
Giuseppe Tatarella says, "but I hope it will not be hard-line 
and intransigent. The opposition should monitor the work of the 
majority and contest it, but without any prejudices." In Great 
Britain, for example, the Labor Party never conceded anything to 
the Conservatives, but during the Falklands War it definitely 
did not resort to any obstructionism. 
  The 27 March elections produced a phenomenon that was 
remarkably in the Anglo-Saxon style. Deputies of the majority 
glorified the role of the opposition, and members of the 
opposition said: "We do not want so much as one committee 
chairmanship in Parliament. They won; let them have all the 
chairmanships." 
  In all of this fair play [preceding two words in English], 
however, the guiding principle is that oversight should be the 
province of the opposition. "We want the chairmanships of the 
investigating committees and of the RAI oversight committee, the 
intelligence overrsight committee, and all organs that enable 
the minority to perform its functions," PDS Senator Massimo 
Brutti says. "I agree," the MSI's Tatarella replies. 
  Although it has an ample majority in the Chamber of Deputies 
(but a tenuous one in the Senate), the nascent government will 
probably not renounce the ritual acts of seduction of the 
vanquished. 
  In particular, the victorious coalition will assuredly try 
to 
win over the segment of the Popular Party (Rocco Buttiglione, 
Roberto Formigoni) that leans toward the right. And as we have 
already seen, the campaign of acquisition is also targeting 
Mario Segni's Pact organization. For example, the tax consultant 
Giulio Tremonti--a follower of the defeated leader [Segni] of 
the referendum--might also be coopted into the Berlusconi 
administration.

  [Text] Salamanca, Spain, 16 Apr (NOTIMEX) -- Mexico and 
Spain will ask that the UN Security Council be enlarged and that 
its organizations vary their appointments to allow continuing 
democratization efforts, it was reported here today. 
  This is the main agreement of the 18 reached at the Seventh 
Mexican-Spanish Inter-Parliamentary Meeting, after three days of 
work in Salamanca, northeastern Spain. With the approval of 
these agreements, political and legislative ties between both 
countries are expected to increase. 
  Both countries revealed their increasing initiatives in 
international politics by calling for changes in the UN Security 
Council to democratize its function and for it to reflect not 
only geopolitical criteria but economic and social issues too. 
They agreed to provide more institutional follow-up to the 
Ibero-American summits of chiefs of state and governments to 
further regional and transatlantic integration. The 
parliamentarians agreed to expedite the ratification of 
agreements to avoid double taxation, fight monetary fraud, 
provide reciprocal guarantees for investments, and speed 
negotiations for the modification of the bilateral extradition 
treaty. 
  The delegates agreed that beginning with this meeting, Spain 
will increasingly become a representative for Mexico and Latin 
America before the European Union and that Mexico will do the 
same for Spain and Europe in North America. 
  Juan Jose Laborda Martin, the leader of the Spanish 
delegation and Senate president, also highlighted the points of 
agreement between the two countries in issues related to 
internal policies. "Our two nations are working intensely to 
achieve greater clarity in the implementation of democracy by 
doing all we can to further reflect the will of the people and 
not that of pressure groups," Laborda stated. "Mexico and Spain 
agree it is illogical that countries like Japan and Germany be 
excluded from the Security Council. We believe in a unipolar 
world. The UN needs to strengthen itself as a sphere of 
supranational authority," Laborda, senator of the governing 
Spanish Socialist Workers Party, said. 
  In a news conference after the close of the meeting, Saul 
Gonzalez Herrera, president of the Mexican delegation and 
senator from the Institutional Revolutionary Party, underscored 
the importance that "legislators should give to their efforts at 
the summits of chiefs of state and governments to boost 
improvements in the Ibero-American integration process." 
  Initially, the two delegations had been scheduled to discuss 
the issue of Cuba's future in the Ibero-American community and 
the role that Mexico and Spain could play to counter U.S. 
pressure on the island. Although the issue was not included in 
the final communique, Laborda told NOTIMEX "it is not something 
we have forgotten about." "Cuba must be helped to equalize the 
political and economic situation -- while maintaining its 
sovereignty -- of its government. We do not agree with the 
embargo or with the future of the island being dictated by a 
minority in the United States," Laborda indicated. Gonzalez 
Herrera emphasized that "Cuba's problems will not be solved by a 
blockade. Mexico has always favored Cuban self-determination 
and hopes that this unilateral attitude will be overcome."

  [Excerpt] The date for Spain's official membership of the 
European Army is now known; it will be 5 May. Defense Minister 
Garcia Vargas announced this today to the congress defense 
committee. The government will also study the possibility of 
increasing by one brigade to a division -- some 12,000 soldiers 
-- Spain's contribution to what has been called the Euroarmy. 
  [Correspondent R. Martinez Durban] Spain is the fourth 
country, following France, Germany, and Belgium, to form part of 
the armed wing of the WEU [Western European Union]. It already 
has some 50,000 men. Spain will initially join with the 3,400 
soldiers of the Cerro Muriano mechanized brigade in Cordoba. 
  Garcia Vargas also revealed that a low-powered ground-to-air 
SAM-7 missile from the Serb sector hit the fuselage of a Spanish 
Aviocar on 8 March as it was flying in Croatian air space.

<F P=106> [Jose Maria Brunet report: "Government Denies Political </F>
Responsibility in Roldan Case"] 
  [Text] Madrid -- The government denies that it has 
political responsibilities stemming from Mariano Rubio's conduct 
in the handling of his private assets. Prime Minister Felipe 
Gonzalez will maintain in the state of the nation debate, which 
begins tomorrow, that in the first place the facts must be fully 
clarified. To this end there will be two essential mechanisms 
-- a parliamentary committee of inquiry and the judiciary's 
activity through the government attorney's office and the courts. 
  This stance is unanimous in the government, although some 
ministers believe that the government should have responded 
vigorously to the corruption phenomenon much earlier. 
<H5>  Mistaken Line </H5>
  The mistake, they assert, was not to appoint Rubio as Bank 
of 
Spain governor or to defend him when the first irregularities in 
connection with Ibercorp were attributed to him, but to have 
maintained an irresolute political line on the corruption cases. 
  Various government sources consulted believe that the 
previous days' rumors about the possibility that the Rubio 
affair, combined with a possible severe electoral setback in 
June, could lead to Felipe Gonzalez' resignation, are unfounded. 
"It is a possibility that must be completely ruled out," a 
member of the government said yesterday, stating that a 
resignation of this kind "is not at all in keeping" with 
Gonzalez' personality and would not be consistent with his 
analysis of the government's proper role against corruption. 
  Thus the prime minister will open the state of the nation 
debate by referring immediately to the Roldan and Rubio cases, 
in order to reaffirm the government's commitment against 
practices involving the misuse of power for private advantage. 
Gonzalez will state that he has undertaken this commitment in 
personal terms, as he explained in the campaign that led to the 
6 June election. 
  The government is preparing a set of specific proposals for 
the debate, on the basis of the conviction that the essential 
thing is to apply the regulations already existing at various 
levels in order to ensure the institutions' good functioning or 
to suppress, where appropriate, conduct contrary to it. The 
government is concerned about the lengthy duration of the penal 
proceedings in these cases; hence the idea of introducing more 
summary trials in certain cases. However, this conflicts, on 
the one hand, with the need not to reduce procedural safeguards, 
depending on the type of offense, and, on the other, with the 
obvious fact that some proceedings for matters connected with 
corruption, such as the investigation into Filesa -- the PSOE's 
[Spanish Socialist Workers Party] illegal funding network -- 
have been under way for two years, with no end in sight. 
  However, various government sources consulted acknowledge 
that the debate will center not on the future, with respect to 
what can be done, but on analysis of the episodes that have 
emerged over the past few weeks and of the existence or 
otherwise of immediate political accountability in this respect. 
This discussion, a prominent member of the government asserted 
yesterday, "is clearly fraught with subjectivity," because the 
concept of political responsibility "is anything but objective." 
  The government's line of argument against these charges is 
to 
state that the accusations against Rubio and the issue of 
whether these influenced his public activity must be verified. 
To this end, the government has set in motion all the machinery 
at its disposal, with the aim of dispelling the idea that there 
is "impunity" for corruption in Spain. 
  Last Friday's [15 April] parliamentary session, with the 
appearance of Rubio himself, forms part of this line of 
argument. Thus it is believed in government and Socialist group 
circles that the speech by PSOE spokesman Juan Pedro Hernandez 
Molto to the Economy Committee had the virtue of making clear to 
the opposition and the public at large the intention to clarify 
the matter completely. 
  Yesterday, Molto himself made statements in which he 
asserted, with respect to his speech last Friday, that "the 
important thing is that the Socialist group said what it 
believed and also what many citizens believe." Molto also said 
that in this matter there are no political responsibilities, 
just personal responsibilities, since nobody has linked Mariano 
Rubio's private actions with his conduct in charge of the Bank 
of Spain. 
  A prominent PSOE Executive Committee member, for his part, 
said yesterday that the reaction of the government and the party 
to the Rubio affair has been similar to "the massive 
administration of drugs to a patient: Now everything depends on 
how his organism responds." According to this leader, neither 
Felipe Gonzalez nor Carlos Solchaga has political responsibility 
for this case. However, he stated that the investigation opened 
after the first accusations about Ibercorp must have detected 
irregularities on Rubio's part in the handling of his finances.

<F P=106> [Reports by Josep Gisbert, Ramon Sune, and Antonia de la </F>
Fuente: "Pujol Asks Gonzalez for Firmness To End Corruption"] 
  [Text] Barcelona -- Jordi Pujol warned Felipe Gonzalez 
Wednesday [13 April] evening, in the course of a meeting that 
they held secretly at the Moncloa Palace, that the corruption 
cases could create deep distrust among the public, and asked 
that, in order to avoid this, the government act firmly and 
courageously to "nip them in the bud," in an allusion to the 
scandals uncovered concerning former Bank of Spain Governor 
Mariano Rubio and former Civil Guard Director General Luis 
Roldan. 
  In an interview broadcast by TV3 yesterday evening, the 
Generalitat [Catalan autonomous government] president gave his 
assurance that CiU [Convergence and Union] will continue to 
support the PSOE [Spanish Socialist Workers Party] in Spain's 
governability, provided that the government fulfills two 
conditions: Continue with the current economic policy and 
"convincingly nip in the bud" all the corruption cases. 
According to Pujol, who came out in favor of avoiding actions 
that could lead to dissolving the Cortes and bringing forward 
elections, "because we have never behaved opportunistically," 
the government's activity to this effect should follow two 
paths: the judicial path, which, in his opinion, could be the 
most effective, and that of a parliamentary committee of enquiry. 
  Both at the end of a meeting with the CiU deputies in the 
Congress of Deputies held in Arenys de Mar to prepare for the 
general policy debate that begins next Tuesday [19 April], and 
in the television interview, the Generalitat president asserted 
that it is the government itself that must resolve the 
corruption cases, although he specified that his group will 
support the Felipe Gonzalez cabinet's initiatives aimed at 
clarifying the scandals at issue and maintained that "it is the 
Socialists and the prime minister who must take the decision to 
clean up their house," because "we cannot clean up other 
people's houses." 
  The meeting between the prime minister and the Generalitat 
president -- a private dinner arranged by the two men by 
telephone a few days earlier -- was described by official 
circles at the Generalitat president's office as "just another 
meeting -- because it is normal that in this legislative term 
they should see each other more often than they used to, in view 
of the greater cooperation that exists -- at which matters 
connected with the negotiation on the impetus for autonomy and 
the change of economic policy were reviewed," and at which it is 
not denied that the corruption cases were also discussed. 
Nevertheless, the same sources specify that the meeting -- at 
which, according to Pujol, economic matters took priority -- 
took place in a "very good" atmosphere, and "was not prompted by 
the Rubio case." 
  However, CiU sectors close to the Generalitat president 
believe the meeting "is of a somewhat special nature" -- 
especially since it is only two months since the last official 
meeting, 10 February, also at the Moncloa Palace -- prompted by 
the political situation in which Spain currently finds itself. 
The analysis that Jordi Pujol has made privately over the past 
few days with those closest to him is that although CiU is 
prepared to support a stable government, as the cabinet headed 
by Felipe Gonzalez has thus far been since the last election, it 
is not prepared to do so with a government weakened by the 
latest corruption scandals. Within this framework, the 
Generalitat president believes that for stability to remain 
guaranteed in Spain, the prime minister must tackle the 
situation resolutely, internally and externally, and act firmly 
in order to restore confidence in the government and its 
credibility. 
<H5>  "To the Bitter End" </H5>
  In fact, the approach is one that Pujol reportedly explained 
personally to Gonzalez, who, for his part, reportedly wished to 
learn from his interlocutor what stance CiU intends to maintain 
at an especially delicate moment with respect to the support it 
gives the government. During his television appearance, Jordi 
Pujol appeared hopeful that the government will adopt urgent 
measures and will know how to react "against this cancer that 
must be thoroughly and rapidly eradicated," since Felipe 
Gonzalez assured him that he intends to go "to the bitter end" 
in clarifying all the matters reported. This led him to 
maintain that "we can avoid the Italian phenomenon," because "we 
are not too late." 
  The Generalitat president denied -- following the lunch with 
CiU deputies in Madrid, Antonia de la Fuente reports -- that the 
prime minister asked him for any kind of special support, and 
asserted that he does not believe that CiU could pay dearly for 
supporting the PSOE in the current circumstances, since "we are 
supporting not the government but an economic policy that we 
believe is the one needed in order to emerge from the crisis." 
Pujol added that he deems it very unlikely that a censure 
motion against Gonzalez could be submitted, because this "should 
be constructive, and the current situation is not sufficient for 
that," and, in any event, he concluded that "if anyone wants to 
submit a motion of censure or no confidence, he will, and we 
will see."

<F P=106> [Manuel Gonzalez and Jose Garrido report: "`Cost Cutting </F>
Through Dismissals a Mistake'"] 
  [Excerpts] Madrid -- Following his reelection for a fourth 
term as leader of the employers' organization, CEOE [Spanish 
Confederation of Employers Organizations] Chairman Jose Maria 
Cuevas showed himself self-critical yesterday in stating that 
"we employers have harmed ourselves in adjusting the labor cost 
by reducing personnel and not by freezing or reducing wage 
increases." 
  In his speech, Jose Maria Cuevas advised CEOE members to 
surmount the crisis by reducing wages and preserving jobs, and 
explained that "by cutting personnel we immediately create 
increases in social benefits that we ourselves must then meet, 
since employers pay 49 percent of the total revenue of the 
public administrations as a whole." [passage omitted] 
  In his speech to the CEOE electoral assembly, Cuevas 
outlined 
the main guidelines for the next four years, which involve a 
commitment to change in various spheres, such as openness, the 
environment, training, innovation and technological development, 
enterprises' external promotion, reinvestment of profits, the 
promotion of careers in business, and so forth. 
  The CEOE electoral assembly reelected Jose Maria Cuevas for 
a 
fourth term by approximately 80 percent of the votes and elected 
the new Executive Council, comprising 90 members, 42 of whom are 
new, and the Executive Committee, with six deputy chairmanships. 
[passage omitted] 
  Cuevas avoided assessing the new General Workers Union 
Confederal Executive Committee, but called on the trade unions 
to negotiate, dwelt on his message that an in-depth review of 
the pensions system must be conducted, and backed better fiscal 
treatment for complementary systems. 
  Last, the CEOE chairman referred to the international 
situation and expressed his concern that the European Union is 
losing ground to other large areas of the developed world. "The 
reasons for these losses are wages and contributions, the 
reduction of investments that are going to other areas, the 
weight of the public sector, and the fact that every private 
sector employee must keep two people, including pensioners, 
officials, and so forth." 
  He advocated a reduction of the state's weight in the 
economy: "All enterprises that are viable in the private sector 
must be returned to the market, regulations and useless 
administrative burdens must be reduced, and insofar as the state 
adjusts to its role, it will be possible to reduce taxes and 
social charges." [passage omitted]

<F P=106> [Article by Larserik Haggman, chief editor of Nordic Council </F>
periodical NORDISK KONTAKT: "Iceland's Road"] 
  [Text] In the intense debate on European integration the 
Nordic aspects have been pretty well to the fore on both the pro 
and con sides and the Finnish media have been writing more about 
Norway than they have done for a long time. However, the Nordic 
area's smallest country has been almost completely forgotten in 
this context. And yet Iceland is being greatly affected by the 
end of the Cold War and by European integration. 
  For many years the Icelanders were deeply divided over their 
NATO membership and particularly over their U.S. base at 
Keflavik. However, throughout the Cold War the majority were 
clearly behind Iceland's West-oriented foreign policy, and 
despite considerable opposition to the Keflavik base, those 
advocating neutrality were few in number. 
  The fact that Iceland did not participate more actively in 
EC 
integration than did Finland, for example, had nothing to do 
with security policy. It was instead because of fishing and 
fish exports that are of crucial importance to the island 
state's national economy. The so-called Cod War with Britain is 
still fresh in people's memories as are Iceland's difficulties 
on the European market. 
  Iceland's strategic position during the Cold War was due 
both 
to the transatlantic links between North America and Europe and 
to Soviet naval and air force movements in the north. At the 
same time the Keflavik base was not to be sniffed at as a direct 
and indirect employer. It is interesting therefore that it was 
the Icelandic side that applied the brake when in the many years 
of negotiations with Iceland the United States was in favor of 
reducing activities at the base. 
  In 1994 an agreement was reached that clearly reduces the 
military force at the base, even though this reduction is not as 
drastic as first planned. New negotiations will begin in two 
years' time. 
  But not only the situation in the field of military policy 
has meant changes. The trend toward integration in Europe has 
also left its mark on Icelandic political life. Despite an 
unmistakable skepticism, Iceland took part in the European 
Economic Area [EEA] negotiations and a majority in the Althing 
approved the results of these negotiations. When the question 
of the European Union [EU] then raised its head, Iceland put 
itself out in the cold after it had "threatened," as early as 
the EEA negotiations, closer trading links with North America, 
and chiefly with the United States, if the results of the 
negotiations in the European direction were unsatisfactory. 
  Until very recently the only openings toward the EU were 
Prime Minister David Oddsson's mildly positive general 
statements made in the context of international meetings of the 
leaders of conservative parties. At home in Iceland the 
consensus that the EU is not on the agenda has up to now been 
the prevailing view. 
  Instead the Icelanders have been kept busy thinking about 
what will happen to the EEA and European Free Trade Association 
[EFTA] if Iceland is left alone in the former and only has the 
company of Switzerland in the latter organization. The solution 
that has been settled on is a proposal for a bilateral agreement 
with the EU, and to this end, Oddsson has given advance warning 
of a visit to Brussels. 
  When, around a week ago, Norway concluded its fisheries 
agreement with the EU, this gave rise to turbulence in Icelandic 
politics. A part of the picture here is that Norway did not 
succeed in keeping its own fisheries under national control but 
was given a promise that once the EU has taken over, fisheries 
policy will follow Norwegian principles. In the Norwegian 
debate at present views are deeply divided on whether this is to 
be seen as a major success or a relinquishment of 
self-determination in the fisheries field. 
  Iceland's social democratic foreign minister, Jon Baldvin 
Hannibalsson, recently raised the question from the Icelandic 
perpsective and joined the group of those who view the results 
of the Norwegian negotiations as a great success. He even went 
so far as to say that the Norwegian result gives grounds for 
looking again at the the foundation for the Icelandic stance and 
to warn that Iceland could otherwise find itself marginalized. 
The foreign minister did not go as far as to directly propose 
Icelandic membership negotiations with the EU, but his message 
was crystal clear and provoked some violent reactions. 
  Fisheries Minister Thorsteinn Palsson, who represents the 
conservative Independence Party, protested and claimed that 
Norway had abandoned its control over its marine resources. He 
received the immediate support of the center and left-wing 
opposition and of the fishing industry, while employers, the 
industry confederation, and a number of trade organizations 
voiced their sympathy with the foreign minister's view and 
called for an investigation into the necessary preconditions for 
negotiations with the EU. 
  The prime minister tried to bring the discussion to an end 
when he backed his colleague, the fisheries minister, but it is 
already clear that such a stance is an impossibility. 
  It is possible that a new trade initiative backed by both 
the 
government and opposition could direct attention elsewhere for a 
while. There are proposals, for example, of negotiations with 
NAFTA, the North American free trade agreement, but this does of 
course throw the eternal Icelandic west-or-east dilemma into 
sharp relief.

<F P=106> [Lars-Ludvig Roed report: "Farmers Turn Guns on EU"] </F>
  [Text] The Association of Norwegian Farmers is moving its 
guns into position: In the next few days and weeks strategy on 
the European Union [EU] will be staked out, and farmer's own 
knowledge of the EU will be increased. Yesterday the first 
regional meeting of the farmers' association, the farmers' 
wives' association, young farmers' groups and the agricultural 
cooperation organization came to an end. 
  In the course of a few weeks, the country's more prominent 
farmers' representatives will have met and put together their 
figures and arguments. The farmers' association is investing 
much in its support for and involvement in No to the EU, but it 
also wants to to be very visible locally. An additional -- and 
voluntary -- membership subscription of 400 kroner will go to 
support campaigning. The aim is that in the end it will be very 
few Norwegians who say "don't know" when asked what impact the 
EU will have on Norwegian agriculture. 
  It is a very competent participant in the debate that is now 
giving the starting signal for the battle against the results 
the government achieved in the EU membership negotiations. With 
its own office in Brussels and staff who have been very close to 
the EU's and Norway's delegations: "We have never been more 
than two days behind the negotiations; sometimes, because of our 
large contact network, we were even ahead of the Norwegian 
negotiators when it came to knowledge of the EU's positions," 
said Leif Forsell, head of the farmers' association's economic 
policy section, when he yesterday briefed the "farming elite" 
from Ostfold, Akershus, Vestfold, and Buskerud. But he did not 
have much other good news from Brussels. 
  In the conference hall of As Hotel he presented a series of 
calculations that pointed without exception to solid minus 
figures for Norwegian farmers in the EU, regardless of whether 
they concentrate on grain, hogs, or milk production. 
  The important question of how many people will be covered by 
the concept of "northern agriculture" -- that is, areas where 
Norway will be able to maintain comprehensive support 
arrangements -- has still not been clarified. But this lack of 
clarity was of no use to yesterday's audience of around 30; with 
farms in eastern Norway they belong to the region that has the 
least prospect of being defined as northern. 
  The frustration was palpable, because individual farmers 
think it bitterly ironic that those areas of Norway that are 
best suited to agriculture are also the areas that will be 
covered by the toughest conditions in the EU. The fact that 
Leif Forsell hinted that competitiveness would be less of a 
problem if farmers make the transition from 
grain/hogs/poultry/cheese/butter to cattle, for example, was 
cold comfort: Not even with cattle will profits be significant, 
and making a transition takes time. But Forsell's example 
calculations were crystal clear: Without any support a farm 
with around 100 acres of grain will lose all of its net income 
of 115,000 kroner -- it would actually move into minus figures. 
"And I am not painting an excessively black picture; these are 
the government's own figures," he pointed out.

  [Text] Sweden's Defense Minister Anders Bjorck is highly 
critical of the way the United Nations peacekeeping operation is 
being conducted in Bosnia. Sweden has troops there as part of a 
Nordic battalion, as well as observers. Speaking to the youth 
movement of his own Conservative Party, Bjorck said no nation 
would dream of sending 70,000 troops into the field without a 
modern, efficient command structure. He specifically called for 
a local commander able to make decisions in Bosnia under a 
mandate from the UN secretary general. 
  The Swedish defense minister said the lack of a UN force in 
and around the safe haven of Gorazde is the reason for the 
catastrophe there. His words were echoed by Sweden's Armed 
Forces Commander in Chief Bengt Gustafsson.

    [Editorial Report] The majority of Swedish economic aid to 
East Europe will go to the northwest part of Russia and will 
focus on small-scale projects. According to a report by Mikael 
Holmstrom in the 10 April SVENSKA DAGBLADET on page 13, Swedish 
aid to East Europe had previously concentrated on Poland and the 
Baltic republics. Now, however, Foreign Minister Margaretha af 
Ugglas, who just returned from a visit to northwest Russia, 
declares that "the Baltics are on the right path, and it is time 
to increase efforts in Russia." Currently, the region receives 
10-12 percent of the total 1 billion kronor earmarked for East 
Europe; this is expected to increase quickly. The aid will be 
concentrated on individual projects instead of large-scale 
government plans. Holmstrom notes that this support "from below" 
makes it easier to tailor efforts to the individual needs of the 
eight northwestern regions. The city of St. Petersburg will 
receive the most aid followed by the other seven regions: 
Murmansk, Novgorod, Pskov, Kaliningrad, Karelia, the Leningrad 
Oblast, and Arkhangelsk.

<F P=106> [Report by K. Venizelos] </F>
  [Excerpt] In his recent meeting with President Bill 
Clinton, Greek Prime Minister Andreas Papandreou raised 
President Glavkos Kliridhis' proposal to demilitarize Cyprus. 
According to informed sources, Papandreou did raise the Cypriot 
president's proposal but the U.S. side appears to insist on 
reaching an agreement for the confidence-building measures 
[CBM's]. President Clinton described the demilitarization 
proposal as "good" but untimely. 
  This fact creates the reasonable impression that the 
Americans will not renege on their efforts for an agreement on 
the CBM's, something that is also strengthened by reports that 
the Americans avoid discussing any alternate proposals such as 
those made by the Cypriot Government. Joe Clark's visit to the 
area is also linked with the UN intention to proceed with 
changes to the package. [passage omitted]

  [Text] Joe Clark, the UN secretary general's special 
representative in Cyprus, has said that the area to be used as 
access to Famagusta's fenced-off area will remain under Turkish 
control, that no territory will be returned, and that the United 
Nations will be in charge of protecting access and guaranteeing 
the safety of those who will use the road. The UN envoy made 
these revelations in a speech on the confidence-building 
measures [CBM's] at the Carnegie Institute in Washington. 
  Commenting on Turkish criticism that the UN document of 21 
March has been modified, Clark said that rigid interpretation of 
the package would give the two sides no serious benefits. The 
UN envoy said the Turkish Cypriots will have the right to 
communicate with the outside world through direct flights and 
will be given travel documents by countries that don't do so 
now. They will also be able to charter flights for passengers 
and cargo. 
  Clark noted that the Greek Cypriot side stressed that the 
CBM's package goes a long way toward lifting the embargo. In 
his address, the UN envoy mentioned that the United Nations is 
trying to persuade various countries, particularly European, to 
begin facilitating Turkish Cypriot travel the day the Greek 
Cypriots return to Famagusta's fenced-off area. It is also 
asking the countries concerned to commit themselves to 
negotiations for offering landing and take-off rights to a 
Turkish Cypriot airline. 
  The United Nations is also trying to ensure that the Turkish 
Cypriots will benefit earlier from international, economic, and 
technological assistance. 
  Although three different views were expressed at the UN 
Security Council [UNSC] on what must be done if no agreement is 
reached on the CBM's, the five UNSC permanent members are 
focusing on the success of Clark's new tour of Ankara and 
Nicosia. According to the Cyprus Broadcasting Corporation's 
correspondent in New York, diplomatic circles believe that it is 
doubtful whether Clark's tour will be effective because it has 
been proven that the U.S. Government is sending the wrong 
messages to Ankara by stressing that the Greek Cypriot side must 
accept some concessions on access to Famagusta, that it will not 
press Ankara, and that it is not ready to discuss alternative 
ways at the Security Council. The same circles say that 
Russia's position on the dispatch of a UNSC delegation to Cyprus 
to study ways to lift the embargo is more positive. But they 
note that while it is a significant counterproposal to the U.S. 
position, the Russian initiative does not have much chance of 
being accepted now. 
  The diplomatic circles also noted that Britain appears ready 
to discuss alternative ways but links them with the UN secretary 
general's proposal that he will want to evaluate the situation 
personally and that he will suggest nothing that will not be 
fully supported by the five permanent members.

  [Text] Joe Clark, UN secretary general's special 
representative in Cyprus, is attempting to bring changes to the 
21 March document for the confidence-building measures [CBM's]. 
This is the upshot of Clark's speech at the Carnegie Institute 
of Washington. 
  Commenting on Clark's speech, Government spokesman Ioannis 
Kasoulidhis said that the document accepted by the Greek Cypriot 
side refers only to the withdrawal of Turkish troops from the 
guard posts south of Famagusta and control of the road by the 
United Nations. 
  In his speech at the Carnegie Institute, Clark had said that 
the area that will be used for access to Famagusta could be used 
by the Turkish Cypriots, something that is not mentioned in the 
UN document. He had also said that with the confidence-building 
measures, Turkish Cypriots will have the right to travel by air 
to other countries and will also be able to charter flights to 
transfer passengers and cargo. Clark also had said that the UN 
asks various countries to give landing and take-off rights to 
one Turkish Cypriot airline.

  [Text] In an interview with the Cyprus Broadcasting 
Corporation, President Glavkos Kliridhis said that Turkey wants 
to appear before the international community as having a calm 
"profile" and that it is allowing Turkish Cypriot leader Rauf 
Denktas to play hard. Actually, a game is being played that 
seems to be misleading the United States. He added: "We are 
telling everyone that what is happening is a game. We have told 
the United Nations that this cannot continue because the Turkish 
side has no political will. If there is no political will, 
there can be no results on the substance of the Cyprus issue or 
the confidence-building measures." 
  Asked whether the Cyprus issue is being turned into the 
Famagusta issue, Kliridhis said that some have a strange view: 
"For example, they believe that if they give us Kyrenia, the 
Cyprus issue will become a Kyrenia issue, and if they give us 
Karpasi, the Cyprus issue will become a Karpasi issue, and if 
they give us Famagusta, the Cyprus issue will become the 
Famagusta issue. 
  ``Just think what the situation in Cyprus would have been if 
we had made the correct steps and gotten Karpasi then. We would 
have secured one area. Today, everyone wants the decision of 
the Third Vienna Treaty on Famagusta to be implemented. But, 
when it was adopted everyone condemned it. 
  ``If the Turkish side believed that the Cyprus issue would 
be 
resolved by reaching an agreement on Famagusta, it would have 
been happy because it would not be pressed to return Morphou or 
other territorial percentages. However, it knows that Famagusta 
is not the solution to the Cyprus problem and also knows that if 
this measure works Greeks and Turks will socialize and cooperate 
in Famagusta. If this happens, Denktas's main argument, that 
the Turkish Cypriots do not trust the Greek Cypriots to live 
with them, will collapse. The opening of Famagusta will 
demonstrate that they can live together. So, Denktas will be 
unable to maintain a dividing line and say that they can live 
together in Famagusta but they cannot anywhere else.'' 
<H5>  Disagreements </H5>
  President Kliridhis added that access to Famagusta is not 
the 
only point of disagreement. He said: "It is being said that the 
Turks want separate customs offices. The Turks disagree. They 
do not want customs offices. The thought was that products for 
the occupied areas would be `bonded' and taxed there according 
to the common market tax. The Turks do not accept this. They 
are saying that each side can do anything it wants in its part 
and charge any tax it wants. They do not accept taxes for 
Famagusta or the airport. 
  ``They do not accept UN administration, either. They are 
saying that there are `de facto' administrations, the Greek and 
Turkish Cypriot, and do not accept the establishment of a UN 
administration. They want a joint `de facto' rule with the UN 
Administration. 
  ``We have started with the disagreements. Access to 
Famagusta was the first one, and it continues to be. We 
disagreed on the size of Famagusta's fenced-off area but it 
seems that on this point they have accepted the municipal 
limits. We also disagreed and continue to disagree on the 
timetable. There are also other points of disagreement.'' 
  Asked about Europe's role, Kliridhis said: "Turkey knows 
that 
it cannot be accepted in Europe now because of its financial 
situation. So it is trying to utilize the financial protocols to 
restructure its economy and prepare for the accession. Greece 
has veto power and is using it. When U.S. President Bill 
Clinton urges helping Turkey to join the European Union [EU], he 
is doing it because Turkish Prime Minister Tansu Ciller asked 
him to. 
  ``I believe that things will change greatly when we join the 
EU. This is why I believe that the stance we maintain until 
January, when the issue will be reexamined, is very significant. 
We have been told clearly that accession negotiations will 
begin if there is progress in the Cyprus talks. Negotiations 
will also begin if there is no progress, but not because of us. 
  ``When negotiations begin, Turkey will have to do some 
serious thinking. Cyprus will obviously join the EU in two to 
three years. So, Turkey will have to abandon any expansionist 
designs or plans because it would be inconceivable to attack a 
European country. 
  ``Then it must weigh the benefits of holding 37 percent of 
Cypriot territory and maintaining occupation troops against the 
price of being prevented from joining Europe. At that point, 
Turkey will become more reasonable about a Cyprus solution. 
This is why our efforts focus on keeping the talks open so it 
does not appear that we would have been unjustifiably negative 
on anything.'' 
  Asked what he would have wanted for his birthday, Kliridhis 
joked that he wants to be 30 years younger. He added: The best 
gift for my birthday would be to see the Cyprus issue resolved.

<F P=106> [Article by K. I. Angelopoulos: "Will Mr. Papandreou Accept </F>
the `Offers' From the United States?"] 
  [Text] As was expected, in Washington the other day U.S. 
President Bill Clinton asked Prime Minister Andreas Papandreou 
to cooperate with the Turkish leaders on the "solution of 
disputes" between the two countries. "This is the most suitable 
time" for this the U.S. President said and, of course, he did 
not fail to mention the Cyprus issue along with Greek-Turkish 
affairs. 
  The way in which Mr. Clinton linked these issues merely 
confirms formally that Turkey has now raised the question of an 
Aegean-Cyprus "package" and that the U.S. leaders have clearly 
accepted this with the consent of the State Department and the 
Pentagon. 
  Although he was extremely careful with his words at the 
joint 
news conference, Mr. Clinton let it be known that, according to 
Washington, normality in the Greek-Turkish relations is 
necessary because Turkey is now faced with a most acute economic 
and political problem. The U.S. President asked the Greek side 
not only to proceed with a dialogue with Ankara ("in return" for 
some concession by Turkey on the "confidence-building measures" 
in the Cyprus issue) but he also asked his interlocutor that 
Turkey be helped to develop its ties with Europe. In short, 
yesterday the White House and U.S. diplomats asked Greece to 
participate in the "rescue operation" for faltering Turkey. 
  According to what is being said behind the scenes, Mr. 
Clinton linked Greek-Turkish affairs directly to Balkan issues 
that are of interest to Greece, particularly to the increased 
role Greece could play in this region from now on in cooperation 
with the United States. The U.S. President let it be known 
that, in Washington's opinion, the "open wounds" our country now 
has in the region do not "favor" the development of this role, 
which cannot be undertaken unless Athens is a trustworthy 
interlocutor with its neighboring countries.... 
  So, for the United States the normalization of Athens' 
relations with Ankara is somehow the "key" to opening the gate 
of the Balkans to Greece under U.S. guarantees. 
  If Greece wants to have a good political and economic 
position in the southern Balkans without any problems on its 
northern borders it should--in the U.S. view--certainly agree to 
discuss the Aegean "problems" with Ankara, open the road to the 
European Union for Turkey and, of course, accept a "solution" to 
the Cyprus issue in the spirit of "political equality"--which is 
an Ankara-Denktas demand--so that the path to the indirect 
recognition of the pseudostate in occupied north Cyprus will be 
open. 
  There has been no answer by Mr. Andreas Papandreou to what 
Mr. Bill Clinton said publicly the other day about Greek-Turkish 
affairs. The prime minister merely listened to what the U.S. 
President said. 
  What does this silence mean? Is it that Mr. Papandreou did 
not accept the logic of his interlocutor about Greek-Turkish 
affairs? Or is he discussing this argument without having 
decided yet? Only on the Cyprus issue did Mr. Papandreou have 
something to say: 
  He agreed that the acceptance of the "confidence-building 
measures" by the Turkish Cypriot side would be a very happy 
event in the search for a solution to the problem. However, 
what will happen to the "package?" Mr. Clinton did not conceal 
the fact that the Aegean-Cyprus issues were discussed with 
[Turkish] Prime Minister Tansu Ciller, who visited him in 
Washington with careful timing a few days ago. As we already 
noted, the U.S. President does not conceal the fact that he now 
agrees with the view that Turkey must "be saved" (which of 
course is also the view shared by Greece's strong partners in 
the European Union). 
  How the Andreas Papandreou government will react to these 
most critical issues will soon be evident in both the Cyprus 
developments and in the level of (whatever) "communication" 
there is with Ankara. Mr. A. Papandreou knows very well since 
the other day what Mr. Clinton's "offers" are and what Mr. 
Clinton demands "in return." The bad thing for the Greek side is 
that the U.S. "offers" are not in the field of the Greek-Turkish 
relations, where only Greek concessions are demanded. On paper 
at least, Mr. Clinton is offering Greece a good Balkan position 
(Washington also needs this to succeed in building a strong 
Balkan "corridor" to separate Germany and Turkey). 
  However, this position is impossible without Greek 
"sacrifices" in Greek-Turkish affairs. At the same time, Mr. 
Clinton can maintain in his discussions with the Greeks that 
Washington is treating Athens politically better than the 
European Union does, since it counts on Greece in the Balkan 
issues. He may also maintain that Turkey's situation now is so 
bad at all levels that the opening of an Athens-Ankara dialogue 
would not necessarily mean immediate Greek concessions on major 
points of "dispute" in the Aegean.... 
  U.S. diplomacy appears to expect some "spectacular" movement 
in the next few days by the Turkish Cypriot leaders on the 
Cyprus issue, assessing that something like this would give Mr. 
A. Papandreou an "alibi" for ending Greek objections to a 
Greek-Turkish dialogue. A close associate of Mrs. Ciller 
already went to Nicosia yesterday to confer with Rauf Denktas. 
The next few weeks or days might see a lot of things. After 
his visit to the United States, Mr. A. Papandreou is obliged to 
proceed with significant decisions for the country.

    [Editorial Report] In an article in the 16 April Athens 
daily ELEVTHEROTIPIA, Pavlos Nathanail quotes an unidentified, 
"well-known" Albanian intellectual as saying that "the Greek 
minority [in Albania] is useful, because it includes progressive 
elements that contribute to the country's development." However, 
the intellectual is further quoted as saying that "the 
difficulty is that some of them are influenced by extremists in 
Athens." There are many moderate Albanians who espouse these 
views in private, Nathanail continues. At this time, the problem 
of Greek Albanians is beginning to be of concern to both Europe 
and the United States because it is one of the foci of crisis in 
the Balkans, as demonstrated by the recent border incident in 
which allegedly Greek masked gunmen raided an Albanian guard 
post. While the Greek Government stresses its wish to improve 
bilateral relations with Albania to improve the condition of 
ethnic Greeks, the existence of extremist elements in both 
countries can seriously undermine this effort at rapprochement, 
Nathanail comments. Regardless of their ideological stance, 
Albanian President Berisha and Prime Minister Mexi would like to 
solve the country's economic problems with the assistance of 
countries that do not have direct differences or common borders 
with Albania. Given the Albanians' traditional suspicion that 
Slavs and Greeks have territorial ambitions against them, they 
believe that such assistance must necessarily come from other 
large countries such as the United States first, followed by 
Turkey and Italy, even at the cost of certain disadvantages, 
Nathanail writes. As a result, he continues, Washington is 
expanding its penetration of Albania, as is Turkey, since 
two-thirds of the Albanian population are Muslims. Based on the 
above, it is impossible to be optimistic for the immediate 
future of Greek-Albanian relations, Nathanail writes, pointing 
out that according to experts from the Greek Center of 
International Studies, bilateral relations will worsen before 
entering a far-off period of relaxation when Albania realizes 
only Greece can save its economy. Until such time, he says, the 
Greek minority must survive to be able to play its historical 
role.

<F P=106> [Report by Roula Kambouriani from New York--live] </F>
  [Text] Ladies and gentlemen, good evening from New York, 
where these days there is very intense diplomatic activity in an 
attempt to lift the impasse in the Skopje [The Former Yugoslav 
Republic of Macedonia--FYROM] issue. Prime Minister Andreas 
Papandreou could possibly meet with UN Secretary General Butrus 
Butrus-Ghali on Wednesday [27 April]. On that same day, Foreign 
Minister Karolos Papoulias will have a meeting with 
Butrus-Ghali. Today, Foreign Minister Papoulias met with Cyrus 
Vance, UN special mediator on the Skopje issue. In the previous 
few days, Vance had meetings with Matthew Nimetz, U.S. envoy on 
the Skopje issue, and Skopean Foreign Minister Stevo 
Crvenkovski. Vance will again meet the Skopjean foreign 
minister in the coming days. Furthermore, Vance will meet 
Papoulias again before Thursday. 
  I expect goodwill moves from both sides, Vance said during 
his arrival for the meeting with Papoulias. Following are the 
remarks of the two men after their meeting, which lasted for one 
hour. 
  [Begin recording] [Kambouriani] Both Vance and Papoulias 
said that the effort will continue and that they are in 
continuous contact. When Vance was asked whether there will be 
an end to the impasse before the end of the week, he said: I do 
not want to guess when that will take place. Asked whether a 
new formula for a solution of the Skopje issue is being 
examined, Foreign Minister Papoulias said: 
  [Papoulias] Various proposals are under examination, but in 
general the effort centers on overcoming the impasse. 
  [Unidentified correspondent] Mr. Vance earlier talked about 
goodwill moves by both sides. What is your comment? 
  [Papoulias] Look, the position of the Greek Government is 
known and I think that Vance's goodwill services continue and 
this is the positive at this time. 
  [Kambouriani] Vance said that there are no plans for a 
meeting with Prime Minister Papandreou, and Papoulias ruled out 
a meeting, at this stage, with Skopjean counterpart Crvenkovski. 
[end recording]

27 percent and negatively by 38 percent, KKE leader Aleka 
Papariga is viewed positively by 13 percent and negatively by 59 
percent, and Coalition leader Nikos Konstandopoulos is viewed 
positively by 33 percent and negatively by 31 percent.

government's course of action, 8 percent say they are "very 
satisfied," 22 percent that they are "satisfied," 29 percent 
that they are "not very satisfied," 37 percent that they are 
"not at all satisfied," and 4 percent do not know. 
  -  National 
issues are seen by 46 percent as the most important problem, 
followed by unemployment (43 percent), high cost of 
living/inflation (42 percent), and economic development (23 
percent). Other problems are education (9 percent), corruption 
(8 percent), crime, health, the environment, social security, 
and the protection of the country's institutions (6 
percent). 
  -  With regard to the Skopje problem, 45 percent believe 
that the PASOK policy is better than the ND's, 22 percent say 
there is no difference, 24 percent say it is worse, and 9 
percent do not answer.

<F P=106> [Column by Yalcin Dogan: "Cyprus Has Created Turmoil in </F>
Ankara" -- punctuation as published] 
  [Text] Ciller has suspended Turkey's aid to north Cyprus, 
including the transfer of funds.... In other words, she has 
imposed an effective "embargo" on north Cyprus.... However, not 
satisfied with that, she conveyed a message with Minister of 
State Mehmet Ali Yilmaz to the effect that she "will solve the 
problem. Therefore, Rauf Denktas must not create any 
difficulty." 
  "Two separate lobbies" have been established in Turkey on 
the 
subject of Cyprus. A very high-ranking official has jokingly 
said the following: "A U.S. lobby and a Turkish lobby exist in 
Ankara on the Cyprus problem.... President Clinton and Prime 
Minister Ciller make up the U.S. lobby and President Suleyman 
Demirel, Speaker of Parliament Husamettin Cindoruk, Foreign 
Minister Hikmet Cetin, and the TRNC [Turkish Republic of 
Northern Cyprus] Government make up the Turkish lobby!" Two 
opposing groups have confronted each other in the full meaning 
of the word at the present time.... 
  The promise Prime Minister Ciller made to President Clinton 
in the United States last week to the effect that she will 
resolve the Cyprus problem and the statement President Clinton 
made later to the effect that "Ciller has promised that an 
important development will take place in a few days" have 
created a turmoil in Ankara. A TRNC parliamentary delegation 
accompanied by Husamettin Cindoruk called on President Demirel 
at about the time when Ankara was informed on President 
Clinton's statement. The delegation arrived in Ankara to hold 
contacts "within the framework of the parliament but not with 
the government." The arrival of the TRNC delegation on the eve 
of a possible development on the Cyprus problem brought to light 
the existing rift in Ankara. 
<H5>  General Session on Cyprus To Be Held Earlier </H5>
  The Turkish Grand National Assembly [TGNA] decided to hold a 
general session on Cyprus some time ago. A decision was made a 
few weeks ago to hold the convocation on 3 May. A general 
session would be held on that day on Cyprus... However, 
Ciller's visit to the United States and the differing views in 
Ankara prompted the TGNA to change that date. A decision was 
made to hold it on Tuesday, 26 April. 
  The Cyprus problem suddenly became the focus of attention in 
domestic politics and the difference of views in the higher 
echelons of the administration came to light. According to the 
information the TRNC parliamentary delegation has conveyed to 
President Demirel and Husamettin Cindoruk, "Turkey suspended its 
financial aid to north Cyprus during the past few months." "A 
serious financial crisis exists in north Cyprus" because Ciller 
has suspended Turkey's financial aid. The TRNC Administration 
is unable to pay its employees. Although Ciller was informed of 
the situation a few times, she responded by informing the TRNC 
Administration that Turkey's aid will be "conditional." And, 
the condition she put forward was as follows: "The transfer of 
any kind of financial aid will be impossible until a political 
solution is found to solve the problem." 
  Turkey's annual aid to north Cyprus has totaled $50 million 
or $60 million so far. That amount was automatically 
transferred to the TRNC. However, it was suspended in 1994 in 
accordance with Ciller's instructions. That state of affairs 
has placed the TRNC in a difficult situation. 
<H5>  Tense Relations Between Ciller and Cetin </H5>
  Ciller refused the requests the TRNC conveyed to Ankara 
several times for the resumption of Turkey's financial aid. 
Consequently, the TRNC Administration became inclined to 
"replace the Turkish currency, which is used in north Cyprus, 
with either the U.S. or the British monetary units." The TRNC 
Administration is studying the question of which monetary unit 
it should adopt at the present time. 
  The TRNC delegation briefed President Demirel on the 
situation in detail yesterday. It has been reported that 
Demirel and Cindoruk assured the visiting delegation as follows: 
"Do not worry. Excluding Rauf Denktas is impossible. Solving 
the problem without Denktas is out of the question." It has 
also been reported that Foreign Minister Hikmet Cetin shared 
Demirel's and Cindoruk's views.... 
  According to very high-ranking sources, "a difference of 
opinion exists between Ciller and Cetin on the matters related 
to the TRNC." In fact, it has been claimed that "Ciller and 
Cetin have not been on speaking terms because of the tense 
situation between them for some time now. It has also been said 
that Demirel is trying to mediate to remove the tension between 
the two officials, that Cetin informs Demirel instead of Ciller 
on government affairs, and that Demirel later transfers the 
information he receives from Cetin to Ciller." 
  All that indicates that Ciller has made a promise to 
President Clinton "without consulting with anyone in Ankara." 
Nevertheless, the question as to what extent her promise can be 
fulfilled was unclear right from the beginning. What is crystal 
clear, however, is the fact that the officials in Ankara have 
clashed on the Cyprus problem and that a deep difference of 
views exists among them....

  [Text] Prime Minister Tansu Ciller has said that she did 
not make a promise to President Clinton on Cyprus when she met 
him in the White House some time ago. Stressing that she "is 
more sensitive than anyone else" on the question of safeguarding 
the rights of the Turkish Cypriot side, Ciller asserted: "We 
will do nothing that will conflict with the interests of Turkey 
and north Cyprus." On the Cyprus problem itself, Ciller said: 
"Nothing has taken place to cause alarm." 
  Prime Minister Ciller replied to journalists' questions 
during the reception Speaker of Parliament Husamettin Cindoruk 
held in the Turkish Grand National Assembly yesterday for 
Children's Day, which is celebrated on 23 April. Regarding a 
question on President Clinton's statement on Cyprus, she said: 
"Denktas has approved the package of confidence-building 
measures [CBM's]. Is that not so? However, he approved the 
first package. Certain changes were made in the second package. 
What we have said is that they should reconsider the matter and 
agree if they can do so. The Foreign Ministry is well informed 
on the matter. Nothing else has been said outside that 
framework. Therefore, there is nothing to cause alarm." 
  In a statement through the Prime Minister's Office Press 
Center yesterday, Ciller said that the Cyprus problem was 
"definitely" not discussed in the talks she had with President 
Clinton in camera after the two delegations met in the White 
House on 14 April. However, Ciller refrained from divulging 
President Clinton's views. Nevertheless, she outlined her own 
views, which were conveyed to the Foreign Ministry in a coded 
message. 
  Ciller said that President Clinton recalled the deadlock in 
the talks on the CBM's package. She explained that she 
responded as follows: "The TRNC [Turkish Republic of Northern 
Cyprus] agreed in principle to the original CBM's package. 
Turkey supported the TRNC in that regard. Later, however, the 
package was changed. An effort to reconcile the views of the 
two sides and have the talks on the package resumed by the end 
of April will be useful." 
  The press center's statement noted that the records of the 
Clinton-Ciller meeting were conveyed to the Foreign Ministry on 
the same day.

<F P=106> [Unattributed report: "Turmoil on Cyprus"] </F>
  [Text] The statement President Clinton made before he met 
Greek Prime Minister Andreas Papandreou, to the effect that "an 
important development will take place on the Cyprus problem in a 
few days and the ball is in Denktas' court" has created a 
turmoil in Ankara. The opposition parties moved into action and 
blamed Prime Minister Tansu Ciller after they read the report in 
HURRIYET's headlines. Ciller responded by saying: "I did not 
discuss the Cyprus problem with Clinton. Nor did he make such a 
statement." 
  However, Ciller's decision to suddenly send Ambassador 
Volkan 
Vural, who is her adviser, to Nicosia drew attention to the 
Cyprus problem in Ankara. Meanwhile, the Greek newspapers 
reported that one of Prime Minister Papandreou's advisers 
informed the Greek prime minister that "Ciller has made a 
promise. Denktas will approve the new package of 
confidence-building measures." That report created a reaction 
in the opposition party leaders. 
  President Suleyman Demirel was the first to react. Replying 
to a question on Clinton's statement during a reception in the 
Cankaya Mansion, he said: "Something that is wrong, something 
that is undesirable, and something that violates and harms the 
rights of Turkey, its kinsmen in north Cyprus, and the TRNC 
[Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus] cannot be accepted." 
Regarding the reports that Rauf Denktas has agreed to the 
package of confidence-building measures, Demirel said: "I 
conferred with the speaker of the TRNC Republican Assembly 
yesterday. As far as I know, the matter is being discussed. 
Meanwhile, I have been informed that the United States wants 
progress to be made in the talks. However, that is all. The 
question is not related to pressure but to the need for 
something to be done. That is the official information I have. 
Naturally, the problem is not a matter between Turkey and the 
United States. Nor is it between Turkey and Greece. It is 
related to the agreement the two communities will reach to 
coexist in Cyprus. That is a matter that does not closely 
concern Ankara. Naturally, Ankara maintains a very sensitive 
and careful approach on the Cyprus problem. That applies to 
public opinion, the parliament, and the government. I am also 
very careful." 
  Demirel's attention was drawn to Clinton's statement that 
the 
problem will be solved in a few days. He replied: "He has 
mentioned two or three days. We shall wait to see developments 
in the next few days." 
  Meanwhile, Foreign Minister Hikmet Cetin said: "I have the 
text of the records on the meeting Prime Minister Ciller had 
with President Clinton. Ciller has not made a promise." 
  Motherland Party leader Mesut Yilmaz's reaction was as 
follows: I cautioned the prime minister before her visit to the 
United States. I was worried that a concession might be made on 
Cyprus. The prime minister must disclose the views she exchanged 
with Clinton, particularly the promise that was made to him. We 
proposed that the Turkish Grand National Assembly [TGNA] hold a 
general session on the Cyprus problem. We have conferred with 
the speaker of the TGNA. The convocation will be held on 
Tuesday. I shall address the session and explain our anxiety on 
the Cyprus problem. 
  Prosperity Party leader Necmettin Erbakan reacted as 
follows: 
No one can make a concession. An administration that has lost 
its grass roots cannot make a concession on the matter. A 
secret policy cannot be maintained within the state. The 
records on the prime minister's meeting with President Clinton 
in the United States must be placed in the archives. 
  Minister of State and Deputy Prime Minister Murat Karayalcin 
said: I do not believe that the reports are true. The prime 
minister will issue a statement on the matter.

  [Text] Ankara, April 25 (A.A.) -- Deputy Foreign Minister 
Ozdem Sanberk said Monday [25 April] that Turkey always 
supported the idea of overcoming confidence crisis between two 
communities on Cyprus. 
  Sanberk speaking before meeting with UN special envoy for 
Cyprus, Joe Clark, and his aides Gustave Feissel and John Paul 
Cavanaugh said Turkey always wanted a secure atmosphere to find 
a peaceful solution to Cyprus problem. 
  Recalling that the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus 
(TRNC) 
has accepted the points included to the original confidence 
building measures package of July 1993 and Turkey has supported 
this, Sanberk said the UN proposed package has been twisted 
after talks which began on February 17, 1994. 
  Clark told the press that the confidence building measures 
have reached a point and it would be a pity to stop it during 
this process. 
  Clark said he has met with Greek Foreign Minister Karolos 
Papoulias in New York and is due to meet with Turkish officials 
in Ankara on Monday and Tuesday. 
  Clark called for a contribution from everybody. 
  `We arrived at this point with Turkey's active support and 
contributions,' Clark said. 
  He claimed that the TRNC would lose very important economic 
advantages if the process failed to succeed. 
  He also said the package will benefit both sides and the 
partial lifting of the embargo will strengthen the TRNC's 
economy by 20 percent. 
  The confidence building measures package has two points, one 
being the opening of the uninhabited Maras [Varosha] section for 
Greek settlement under UN supervision, and the other being the 
opening of the Lefkose [Nicosia] Airport also under UN direction 
and the partial lifting of the embargo imposed on the Turkish 
side. 
  The envoys will leave Turkey early Wednesday morning.

  [Excerpts] Joe Clark, the UN secretary general's special 
envoy in Cyprus and former Canadian prime minister; his aide, 
Gustave Feissel; and John Paul Cavanaugh, a UN political aide, 
have been holding contacts in Ankara. [passage omitted] 
  After their meeting with Foreign Ministry Under Secretary 
Ozdem Sanberk, Clark said that mutual lack of trust remains the 
main problem in Cyprus. He pointed out that in the meeting, 
they discussed various points relating to the 
confidence-building measures [CBM's]. He said: One of the 
points was what specific advantages the Turkish Cypriot side can 
be given to balance the specific advantage the Greek Cypriots 
will get when they are allowed to resettle in Maras [Varosha]. 
Naturally, these advantages cannot be realized without an 
agreement. 
  In turn, Sanberk said that they exchanged views on the 
CBM's. 
He pointed out that he explained to Clark that the amendments 
made to the original version of the CBM's -- the one to which 
the Turkish Cypriots had agreed in principle -- substantially 
changed the basic spirit and parameters of the package. Sanberk 
went on to say that Clark expressed his views and briefed the 
Turkish side on the contacts he has held on the issue.

<F P=106> [Column by Ertugrul Ozkok: "Foreign Minister Cetin's </F>
Reaction to NATO" -- punctuation as published] 
  [Text] The Turkish Ministry of Foreign Affairs was on full 
alert yesterday. Working Under Foreign Minister Hikmet Cetin, a 
crisis group established a command center to monitor the three 
fronts around Turkey round the clock. Gorazde was not the only 
case on the Ministry's agenda. The crisis group also focused on 
the incidents in Azerbaijan and northern Iraq. 
  Cetin arrived at the Ministry and set up his working group 
early in the morning. They worked until midnight. Undoubtedly, 
the priority issued on the crisis group's agenda was that of the 
incidents in Gorazde, which is about to fall. Cetin kept 
calling President Suleyman Demirel and the officials in Bosnia. 
The group studied events in Gorazde minute by minute. The 
Serbian forces had advanced almost up to Gorazde's central 
areas. The city was about to fall. But NATO remained inactive. 
It failed to launch the necessary operations. 
<H5>  When, If Not Today? </H5>
  The most important piece of information Cetin received was 
as 
follows: Commander Rose of the UN forces in Bosnia had called 
for urgent air support. But UN representative Akashi was 
undecided on the issue. And it couldn't be said that he was in 
favor of the idea. That was why the expected NATO operation was 
not launched. Cetin's views on NATO gradually began to change in 
the afternoon. When would NATO use the authority transferred to 
it if it didn't use it today? The view that gained weight in 
Cetin's consultations with his close colleagues was: "NATO will 
suffer seriously if it fails to achieve a result. No one has 
the right to place NATO in such a situation. NATO has remained 
helpless." 
<H5>  Remove the Helplessness </H5>
  That viewpoint spread by late afternoon. The developments 
that took place would most likely place NATO in a helpless 
situation. One of the two British aircraft that took off to bomb 
the Serbian positions around Gorazde was shot down. That made 
NATO look like a ridiculous organization. And that along with 
its helplessness. 
  Conflicting reports came in from Italy. One of them said 
that several NATO aircraft took off for Gorazde. But neither 
the NATO general headquarters nor the UN organization in New 
York confirmed it. Tension emerged at that time. Did NATO 
aircraft take off? If so, would they attack the Serbian forces? 
That NATO would not launch an operation against them became 
apparent by 2100. This seriously disappointed the crisis group. 
  Cetin began to talk in a loud voice. No one had the right to 
place NATO in such a ridiculous situation. NATO was not a 
helpless organization. Why did it agree to shoulder such an 
important responsibility if it was reluctant to fulfill its 
requirements? What was even worse was that NATO would be unable 
to achieve effective results in its humanitarian mission. 
  Considering that, Cetin prepared to make a harsh statement 
against NATO the next day. He decided that the following day he 
would outline the feelings and views he couldn't express that 
night. 
  Developments in Gorazde have raised serious questions in 
Turkey regarding its confidence in NATO. Obviously, Turkey will 
be deeply worried by NATO's situation if Cetin's views forms the 
basis of Turkey's general policy. 
<H5>  Turkey's Approach to the CSCE </H5>
  Undoubtedly, the anxiety NATO has caused in Turkey may have 
a 
bearing on Ankara's approach to the CSCE, because very important 
humanitarian problems were uncovered in the world after the CSCE 
was established. The situation in Azerbaijan is an example. 
The tragic developments in Azerbaijan and Bosnia were important 
humanitarian issues, which are within the framework of CSCE's 
basic principles. 
  The CSCE has no mechanism to obstruct a war. NATO and the UN 
establishments are the only mechanisms it can use. But neither 
the UN peacekeeping forces nor NATO has been able to influence a 
country like Serbia, the economy of which is almost on the verge 
of collapse. 
  NATO has been reluctant to take any action to protect the 
70,000 people who are faced with the threat of massacre, 
regardless of the authority it received from its general 
headquarters and the UN organization, the Kaaba of the world. 
  How can NATO be effective on other issues if it fails to act 
as an effective organization on Bosnia? 
<H5>  Hair-Raising Views </H5>
  Undoubtedly, many questions can be asked if we look into the 
past. Turkey is one of NATO's flank countries. It served that 
organization against the former Soviet Union for many decades. 
It fulfilled all its obligations as a NATO country in a 
dangerous geographic location. In fact, it even allowed the U-2 
reconnaissance aircraft to take off from its territory. In 
other words, compared with the other NATO members, the threat 
Turkey was confronted with was the most serious at the time. 
  The question that should be asked is this: How would NATO 
have acted as a deterrent organization if a clash had taken 
place between its members and the former Soviet Union? The 
views and convictions on the developments that took place in the 
past become more and more hair-raising when NATO's approach to 
Bosnia is considered. Would NATO have moved to support Turkey 
in a clash with the former Soviet Union in the past? Or, would 
it have contented itself with sending two aircraft to help 
Turkey, one of which would have most likely been downed in the 
northern Black Sea region and the other would have escaped with 
great difficulty? 
<H5>  Political Geography Can Change </H5>
  NATO's helplessness regarding Bosnia may upset many of the 
scenarios and projects on serious international projects. It 
may encourage many governments that have problems with their 
ethnic communities. NATO and the United Nations have failed to 
protect the Bosnian people against genocide. Will they be able 
to protect the minority communities from the threat of a 
massacre in remote countries in the future? 
  Yes, NATO's helplessness on Bosnia may change the scenarios 
in the political geography in the world. Dictators may become 
more daring. The humanitarian principles that have been 
established by the CSCE may be undermined. The people who 
struggle for their cultural rights and ethnic traditions in many 
parts of the world, including those who believe that they have 
almost achieved their objectives, may be seriously disappointed. 
<H5>  Bosnia Would Have Saved the World </H5>
  A NATO operation in Bosnia would not have been only for the 
Bosnian people. It would also have been a lesson to the forces 
in other countries that are inclined to create a situation 
similar to Bosnia. Unfortunately, the helpless situation in 
Bosnia has created an atmosphere suitable for a new kind of 
political psychology in various parts of the world. 
  Yesterday, HURRIYET described NATO in its headlines as a 
"helpless organization." As far as the world is concerned, the 
cost of that state of helplessness may be very high.

<F P=106> [Interview with Prime Minister Tansu Ciller by Ruediger </F>
Moniac; place and date not given: "Ciller: Clear the 
Misunderstandings"] 
  [Text] Bonn -- Almost two weeks after the beginning of the 
mammoth trial against 13 occupiers of the Turkish Consulate in 
Munich, some 3,000 people participated in peaceful 
demonstrations in Munich and Duesseldorf on Saturday [23 April] 
against the deportation of Kurds and German arms supplies to 
Turkey. In Munich, 2,000 demonstrators followed the call of the 
Alliance Against Racism. Kurdish women and children with flags 
and posters gathered for a demonstration in Duesseldorf that was 
registered as a "children's festival." Several hundred police 
were in action in both cities. In an interview with DIE WELT, 
Turkish Prime Minister Tansu Ciller has meanwhile commented on 
the basic issues of the conflict. 
  [Moniac] Attacks have been carried out against Turks -- your 
fellow countrymen -- in Moelln, Solingen, and now also 
Bielefeld. Prime Minister, what do you think of that? 
  [Ciller] After the attack of Solingen we asked the German 
authorities to clearly condemn such brutal acts of hostility 
against foreigners, and to protect Turks living in Germany 
against assaults and to take the guilty ones to court. It is 
not acceptable for foreigners to be confronted with such 
assaults. For more than 30 years, my fellow countrymen have 
lived and worked in Germany, having become part of society 
there. They have contributed to society in social, cultural, 
and economic terms. This is why they expect to be able to 
continue to live in peace there. 
  [Moniac] How do you intend to refute accusations according 
to which Turkey is using German arms, the further supply of 
which has meanwhile been stopped by Bonn, against the Kurds. 
  [Ciller] Turkey has emphasized that German military aid is 
being used in line with the agreements concluded with the 
Federal Government. Any claims of misuse are absolutely 
unfounded and have been intentionally concocted by certain 
groups to impair Turkish-German relations. We hope that the 
Federal Government will remove the issue from German politics, 
which seems to be influenced by the election campaign atmosphere 
these days. 
  [Moniac] Can Turkey do without German arms? 
  [Ciller] We are interested in continuing constructive 
cooperation with Germany and other NATO members in the military 
sphere. It is of great benefit for both sides and for NATO as a 
whole. Yet, one should not forget that competition in the 
armament market is stiff and that Turkey is not dependent on a 
single source as far as military goods are concerned. 
  [Moniac] How should German arms exports be stimulated again? 
  [Ciller] The initiative lies with the Federal Government, 
whose members we appreciate highly. We hope that, within the 
framework of long-standing Turkish-German friendship, the 
Federal Government will not be influenced by certain groups that 
want to impair our relations. 
  [Moniac] Does the Turkish Government also have instruments 
to exert pressure? 
  [Ciller] We are not intending to exert pressure. Our 
objective is to clarify the misunderstandings. Everything else 
lies within the responsibility of German authorities. It is 
true that we have to take public opinion in Turkey into account. 
Nevertheless, we are convinced that our Turkish-German 
friendship will drive away the clouds above our relationship. 
  [Moniac] The first Kurds holding Turkish passports have been 
deported to Turkey. Can you guarantee that they will neither be 
tortured nor executed? 
  [Ciller] Turkey is a democracy based on the principles of 
law and order with unrestricted respect for human rights. 
Turkey is a member of various international institutions for 
the prevention of torture and mistreatment. Such acts are also 
defined as major crimes by the Turkish Penal Code. As far as 
claims that deportees are threatened with capital punishment in 
Turkey are concerned, I would like to say the following: Under 
Turkish law, such sentences have to be ratified by parliament. 
Since 1984, the Turkish Parliament has not ratified a single 
case of capital punishment, which is why death sentences have 
not been carried out. Besides, application for asylum in 
another country is not a punishable act under Turkish law. 
Therefore, these persons will not be subject to criminal 
persecution in Turkey for having filed an application for asylum.

<F P=106> [First of an unspecified number of installments of an </F>
"abridgment" of an interview with Abdullah Ocalan, leader of the 
Workers Party of Kurdistan, PKK, by reporters Ertugrul Kurkcu, 
Ragip Duran, Behcet Avsar in Barr Ilyas in Lebanon on 21 March] 
  [Text] [OZGUR GUNDEM] In your message to the International 
Conference on Northwestern Kurdistan, you proposed a cease-fire 
for the second time. You also agreed to abide by all the 
decisions of the conference. Why? 
  [Ocalan] I felt a need to repeat this cease-fire offer to 
clear ourselves of responsibility. It was mostly addressed to 
the Western public, rather than Turks; and was announced partly 
at the request of our friends. I told them our views were 
consistent, that nothing had changed. But they asked: "Could 
you not put it in writing?" I told them I was not afraid to do 
that, and in an act of modesty, I went as far as to say I would 
abide by the decisions made by the conference. The Western 
alternative shows interest in a democratic solution, even a 
limited one. The West does not fully accept the renunciation of 
our national identity, it is impossible for them to deny a 
people's cultural identity. Therefore, do not disparage my 
pledge that "right now I accept any decisions you make." The 
result was clear from the start and I had to respect it. I 
asked if it would have any practical results and could it lead 
to other developments? It seems the decisions of the conference 
will have a significant impact on the Western public. Already, 
parliamentarians are increasing their support for our proposals. 
Influential people from various parliaments participated in the 
conference, and I hope it will influence their governments. 
Diplomatic channels have already been opened, including ties 
with the big powers. 
<H5>  France and Germany Will Backtrack </H5>
  [OZGUR GUNDEM] Germany and France joined Turkey last winter 
in declaring your organization illegal and terroristic. Do 
these new developments mean those countries are retracting their 
statements? 
  [Ocalan] There will be a clear renunciation of these 
statements, and that will not be all. Why were such statements 
made in the first place? Because they had an important place in 
the plans of the United States and the West. At one point, 
Mitterrand told Ciller: "We will make your star shine." The 
meaning of this is very clear: "You take certain steps and in 
return we will boost your popularity." Do you know when France 
made this statement? A day before the True Path Party Congress. 
Ciller needed some success, a great victory to win over the 
congress. The West expressed their support for her, and this is 
how the "star wars were won." Soon after that, France and 
Germany made certain joint decisions with the knowledge of the 
United States. They expected things of Ciller; she had to take 
certain steps on the Kurdish problem. We were aware of the 
West's inclination, and therefore we wanted to show that we were 
not opposed to their policies as far as values are concerned and 
that we were not opposing this on the battlefield. Now, the 
West is returning to its original policy and is abandoning the 
idea of "giving moral support Ciller's shining star." Why? 
Because "she failed to fulfill the promises she made." Ciller 
had long been under the influence of the special warfare forces, 
and was acting as their mouthpiece. The West realized this and 
asked: "What does that finger wagging by Gures mean? Can he 
raise his finger against a prime minister?" [reference to a 
newspaper photo of Chief of General Staff Dogan Gures raising an 
admonishing finger over a sullen Ciller] The West noticed this. 
Of course, this symbolically reflects a reality -- she has come 
under the control of the Army. The promises have come to naught 
and there is nothing to show for it! Now, the West is angry at 
this. In addition to backtracking, it has also withdrawn its 
support. As the system requires, NATO still generally supports 
Turkey, but that is a different matter. Here I am talking about 
this government. Something new has arisen; my proposals had an 
enormous impact. Just the way the cease-fire proposal last year 
created an extraordinary effect in Turkey, the present one has 
generated a far greater impact on the international level. I 
think that this will put a lot of pressure on Turkey. 
  [OZGUR GUNDEM] The concluding statement of the conference 
links the intractable Kurdish problem to the West's policy of 
dividing up the Middle East and Kurdistan during and after World 
War I. Is this new attitude linked with the PKK's diplomatic 
initiatives, or with the democratization of the West? 
  [Ocalan] Undoubtedly, Turkish realities foiled the West's 
policies; this is evident. They are unable to carry out their 
policies and have nothing left to say on the Kurdish problem. 
In the past the approach was: "The Kurdish problem cannot be 
solved by the PKK [Workers Party of Kurdistan]." For the last 
ten years, a Kurdish solution without the PKK was the most 
fashionable. The United States spearheaded this policy. The 
great difference is that now they say: "This cannot be 
accomplished without the PKK." This is a dramatic development; 
it is the achievement of the year. The fact that the PKK has 
been accepted as a factor in the solution will have 
repercussions. Another assessment of the conference was: "We 
have made a great mistake by seeing the PKK in this light thus 
far, we have had a mistaken view of it. We should have realized 
that the problem cannot be solved without the PKK. Our 
governments wanted to isolate the PKK and they supported the 
war, which has led to much bloodshed. The West -- France, 
Germany, and the United States -- are responsible for the 
bloodshed. We will pressure our governments to repent of their 
historic sin on the Kurdish problem and for supporting the 12 
September regime [the Turkish Government since the 1980 coup 
d'etat]. Seeing that this job cannot be done without the PKK, 
we will stress the importance of establishing contact with it." 
The conference adopted decisions in line with this assessment. 
<H5>  We Are Not Controlled by the West </H5>
  [OZGUR GUNDEM] What path will your party follow after the 
conference? 
  [Ocalan] A period of diplomacy has now begun. The friendly 
parliamentarians, influential persons, professors, thinkers, and 
ministers are participating in developments and will be able to 
meet with all the ambassadors. This is a new trend, and I think 
it will intensify in April. This does not mean that the PKK has 
fallen under the control of the West. No! We are protecting 
our identity! We are really attached to our independence and 
freedom. There are no concessions on this issue! But on the 
other hand, we are sure it is senseless to make enemies out of 
the West for no reason at all. The West has its own values. 
Logic and democracy require that these values be taken into 
account and unity be achieved around them. The fanatical 
Turkish leftist and rightist circles consider that "the PKK is 
collaborating with the West." No! The conference decisions 
show the degree of Western support for Turkey. The West is 
equally responsible for the bloodshed. It is a fact that the 
West fought against us bitterly, and the United States was the 
leading force in this war. Again, it was the United States 
which supervised the tortures in Diyarbakir [reference to Kurds 
detained in Diyarbakir prison after the 1980 coup]. For many 
long years the United States supported plans to eliminate the 
PKK. The October 1992 attack against us during the war in the 
south [northern Iraq] was guided by the United States. The West 
also kept silent during the latest bombing of the Zhalah camp. 
As soon as four [Serbian] planes take off in Bosnia the West 
shoots them down; but when 50 planes raided Zhalah they approved 
of it. The region now is under Poised Hammer's jurisdiction. 
This raid shows the extent of the support given to Turkey. But 
now the West sees that it is responsible for the bloodshed. We 
proved their responsibility, and now they now want to back away 
from this policy. This backtracking is not a bad thing. 
Naturally, we will again announce that we are ready if they 
want to promote democratic and cultural rights and a political 
solution to the problem. We will say: "We express our 
agreement and compliance in advance" with any possible 
solutions, as logic and democracy require, not as an act of 
surrender or collusion as some claim.

  [Text] Ankara--Weary of recent political and economic 
developments in this country, a majority of Turks have no 
confidence in the government's "economic measures package" but 
still believe democracy will continue without a military 
takeover, a Turkish Daily News [TDN] poll conducted last week 
has shown. 
  The TDN last week randomly polled a total of 2,455 Turks in 
five provincial centers and two towns, questioning them on 
popular confidence in the economic package announced by Prime 
Minister Tansu Ciller on April 5. 
  Three questions were put. A majority of those polled said 
they did not believe the economic measures would solve the 
country's economic problems and said they have no confidence 
that the state will participate in the "sacrifice" which the 
government has asked the people to make. 
  A majority also said that despite these deficiencies, the 
ailing economic situation would not lead to an interruption of 
the democratic order by the military. 
  Asked whether the "package" would solve Turkey's problems, 
63.42 percent of those questioned said "no," while only 34.46 
percent replied positively. Those who did not believe the 
package would be of any use numbered 1,557 against the 846 
people who expressed confidence in it and 52 people, or 2.12 
percent, refused to comment. 
  When asked whether they believed the state would make the 
necessary sacrifice for the package to work, a majority of 71.28 
percent, or a total of 1,750 people replied, "No." Only 638 of 
those polled, 25.98 percent, said, "Yes," while 67 refused to 
comment. 
  Of those polled, 102 (4.17 percent) refused to comment on 
the 
question: "If this package does not solve the problems, will 
there be a military coup?" But the majority gave a clear "no" 
(65.94 percent, representing 1,619 people). Only 734, or 29.89 
percent, believe there will be a military takeover. In the 
Turkish capital of Ankara, of the 1,055 people randomly polled 
in several districts, including downtown Kizilay and Ulus, over 
a period of two days, 65.9 percent of the citizens said they did 
not believe the package would solve their problems and 70.9 
percent said they did not believe the state would make any 
sacrifices. While 56 percent said a failure of the measures 
would not lead to a military coup, 35.8 percent said it would. 
In Istanbul, Turkey's largest city, of the 577 people polled, 
48.8 percent said the new economic package would not solve 
Turkey's problems, and a mere two percent more (50 percent) said 
that it would. As in Ankara, a majority said there would not be 
a coup--representing 79.8 percent of the polled. 
  Results in the Aegean port city of Izmir were similar among 
the 418 randomly polled, with 74.4 percent saying the measures 
would not work, 77 percent saying the state would not make 
sacrifices and 71.5 percent saying there would not be a military 
coup in the case of failure. 
  Of the people polled in the southern touristic resort city 
of 
Antalya and the western industrial city of Bursa, 69.5 percent 
said they did not believe the measures were any solution to 
Turkey's problems and 74.7 percent said they did not believe the 
state would make any sacrifice--as it has promised to do. About 
the likelihood of a military takeover, 62.1 percent said they 
did not believe it likely. 
  In the resort towns of Bodrum and Marmaris, where the TDN 
has 
offices, 61.7 percent of those polled said the economic package 
would not solve Turkey's problems, 68.5 percent said the state 
would make no sacrifice and 64.5 percent said they did not 
believe the military would intervene when the package failed. 
  Comments: 
  Those questioned in all of the cities where the TDN public 
opinion poll was conducted expressed a deep lack of confidence 
in the government's economic package mainly because they do not 
trust the state will make its share of the sacrifice. Some of 
those who refused to comment said they still did not know the 
contents of the package, while the main criticism was directed 
at government waste of its own resources. 
  In the main, the comments reflected a lack of trust in state 
organizations and administrations, with criticism such as: 
"They always promise, but never do what they say," and "First 
they should make sacrifices and then ask the people to do the 
same." 
  One widely heard view from those who believe that a military 
coup can take place in Turkey was based not on a possible 
economic failure but on the possibility of the pro-Islamic 
Welfare Party coming to power. A majority of those who fear a 
coup may take place commented that this would happen only if the 
RP came to power or there were attempts at establishing Shariat 
rule in Turkey. 
  Some of the comments on the possibility of a coup by those 
polled were as follows: 
  "If Shariat comes there will be a coup." 
  "There can never be another coup in Turkey." 
  "If a coup is staged this will thrust us back by ten years." 
"There will be a popular revolt, not a coup, if the package 
fails." 
  Among those polled, there was also a feeling in favour of 
"making a change", and some responded by saying that all 
establishment parties had been tried and it was now time to try 
the Islamic experience. 
  The TDN poll also revealed, once again, that when questioned 
on military coups and the armed forces, a considerable number of 
Turks are still reluctant to comment.

  [Text] Ankara, April 25 (AA) -- Constitutional Court 
President Yekta Gungor Ozden today called for a new constitution 
to underline democracy in Turkey. 
  "A new constitution, suitable to our nation, should be 
prepared at the soonest, to bring rules which would strengthen 
the democratic and secular structure of the Republic of Turkey, 
based on human rights," Ozden said. 
  Speaking at the ceremony marking the 32nd year of the 
Constitutional Court, Ozden said that the Turkish nation was 
founded on the concept of humanity, rather than a racist 
understanding and the national characteristic of the republic 
cannot possibly be changed by force. 
  Ozden said that sovereignty belonged unconditionally to the 
Turkish nation not to parliament. 
  "Parliament is an organ authorized, on behalf of the nation, 
to legislate and execute," he said. 
  Ozden warned against illegal rallies which were in fact 
rehearsals for establishing a Shariah (Islamic law) state and 
were exploiting democracy in Turkey. 
  ``National, regional or city-level sheikhs or dervishes, 
political dervish lodges cannot be allowed or considered valid. 
  ``Law is our scientific illumination,'' he said. ``To live 
under freedom, happiness and confidence requires independence 
and willpower, rather than pressure and violence. 
  ``This state and country belongs to us all. We shall live 
with pride and make our state live in pride, if we appreciate 
the value of these and are aware of our responsibilities.''

<F P=106> [Article in four installments by Rusen Cakir: "Understanding </F>
the Prosperity Party"] 
<H5>  [10 Apr p 23] </H5>
  [Text] The organization of the Prosperity Party [PP] is 
described as the "worry beads model." The PP appoints an 
official to every neighborhood. That official finds and 
appoints other officials to every avenue, every street, and even 
every apartment building. Inspectors check on the work of the 
neighborhood officials, who are directly attached to the party's 
district chairman. In each province, there are party councils 
composed of 50 members and 50 reserve members. Similar councils 
function in the districts, too. 
  In all its units, in parallel with its main organization, 
the 
PP has mobilized the women in "ladies committees." After every 
election, the PP gets ready for another election as if it is 
going to be held the next day. The organization model is also 
implemented in the ballot boxes. In other words, the 
neighborhood officials appoint committees made up of at least 
three people for every ballot box in their area. The duties of 
this committee are to collect information about all the voters 
registered to that ballot box, to brief the party propagandists 
on these voters when necessary, and especially to do whatever it 
can to ensure that the voter expected to vote for the PP goes to 
the ballot box. 
  Currently, PP members fall into three basic groups. First, 
there are the "founding big brothers" who advocate the "National 
View," which is an extension of the National Order Party and the 
National Salvation Party [NSP]. They are followed by the young 
NSP members of the seventies. Those who joined the movement 
after 1980 make up the third category. 
  The "founding big brothers" enjoy uncontested authority and 
respect within the party. They lose their status only as a 
result of certain high-level conflicts or because of health 
reasons. The general headquarters and the Turkish Grand 
National Assembly group of the PP are composed mainly of these 
members. The second group is composed mainly of members in 
their thirties and forties who are usually administrators in 
provincial organizations and in local authorities. Those who 
followed the 1968 events with envy from afar as religious 
students are now formulating and implementing the new PP 
policies with social democratic, civilian populist, and, at 
times, liberal tendencies. Those who were students during the 
seventies or in the early eighties, on the other hand, are 
closer to radical Islamic trends. 
  Prominent in the third category are those who have broken 
away from different ideologies, women of all ages, students who 
were politicized during the Islamic wave of the eighties, young 
workers, and young unemployed citizens. 
  The abundant middle cadres of the PP (mostly middle-aged) 
provide the equilibrium between the enthusiasm and dynamism of 
the grass roots and the caution and meticulousness of the top 
cadres. The high-level administrators -- no doubt Necmettin 
Erbakan in particular -- appear inaccessible and legendary in 
the eyes of the grass roots, who continuously come into contact 
with the middle cadres. 
  Maybe this is why Erbakan conducts more tours in the country 
than other leaders, allows party members to kiss his hand, and 
wins their hearts by turning the inaccessible into accessible. 
  The PP, which does not appear to have any factional 
conflicts, is actually a very complex coalition. For example, 
PP members in central Anatolia are more provincial and closer to 
Turkish nationalism, and their religion is widely mixed with 
Alawite contradictions. Those in the Black Sea region display 
more urban qualities and incorporate the religious element into 
politics more. The Kurdish identity in southeast Anatolia, where 
religious schools have always been predominant, is becoming 
increasingly prominent. The big cities, in turn, incorporate all 
of these characteristics. 
  Undoubtedly, the way to advance such a complex organization 
and prevent power squabbles is to limit the democratic channels 
within the party as much as possible and replace them with 
centralism. 
  At this juncture, Erbakan's personality becomes important. 
Erbakan, who has been operating the National View movement with 
practically the same top cadres for the past quarter of a 
century (Oguzhan Asilturk, Sevket Kazan, Recai Kutan, Fehim 
Adak, and Ali Oguz), is the embodiment of the party center. All 
the important decisions in the PP are made by Erbakan (or so it 
seems). Erbakan has the final say (sometimes also the first) in 
determining election candidates, party central decisionmaking 
and executive council members at congresses, and assembly group 
leaders. 
<H5>  Prosperity's Identity </H5>
  The fact that decisions within the PP, which in essence is a 
coalition, are reached unanimously or to be more accurate the 
fact that decisions of the party oligarchy dictated by Erbakan 
are endorsed unanimously cannot be explained through Erbakan's 
personality. The PP's main magic is that it has, above all, 
managed to convert its members to Prosperity. 
  The PP, which can be viewed as a religious organization from 
the outside, actually has an organizational concept which can be 
termed secular. The PP possesses the mechanism for transforming 
the individual joining its ranks, irrespective of his motives 
for joining, his past or future, into a Prosperity member. 
These mechanisms begin functioning as soon as the individual 
establishes contact with the party. 
  Erbakan has never claimed to be the sheikh and his attitude 
has rendered things easier. Since the death of Mehmed Zahid 
Kotku on 13 November, 1980, however, Erbakan has claimed that 
political authority should precede religious authority, which 
has led to serious problems. 
  PP members refer to their leader as "Mujahid Erbakan." In 
other words, the PP is an organization for "jihad." Although 
being versed in religious issues may carry prestige within the 
party it does not bring along status. The way to status is 
through having good organizational skills, eloquence, and 
expertise in certain issues. No doubt, it is desirable that a 
party member with some of these characteristics also be an 
authority on religion, but this is not required. No one within 
the PP interferes with anyone else's adherence to religious 
obligations. It is taken for granted that everyone is 
fulfilling the requirements of Islam. Theoretically, however, 
each PP member has the right to interfere in the daily life of 
any other member. 
  One of the secrets for the success of the National View 
movement, which has been in Turkish politics for over 25 years 
through the legality and power attained from the argument that 
"Islam does not separate between religion and state affairs as 
is the case in Christianity," is that it has gradually made a 
distinction between religion and state affairs and it has, at 
the same time, put state affairs above those of religion. The 
embarrassed NSP administrator of the past who could not answer a 
question relating to the interpretation of an Islamic scripture 
has now been replaced by PP administrators who proudly reply 
"address your questions on scriptures to the pertinent 
authorities." 
<H5>  The Goal Is Political Power </H5>
  Today's PP members have dedicated themselves to "formulating 
projects on Turkey's concrete problems" rather than religious 
issues. The National View can thus be viewed as a movement that 
modernizes and secularizes the religious, which is the case with 
all Islamic political groups in the world. Since the National 
View is at the same time a communicational organization and 
since this strategy of communications has, since the eighties, 
been directed to those who are not religious, it has aimed at 
training cadres expert in economics and politics. This stand 
further strengthens the process of secularization which the 
movement has entered. The role of theologians and clergy is 
gradually diminishing within the PP. The Prosperity identity 
every member adopts in the beginning is actually a secular one 
that has been given the patina of Islam. The Islamic dimension 
of this identity is very shallow, static, and confused since it 
has frequently been deformed due to legal reasons. As a result, 
PP members, who agree in general on Islamic goals (for example 
to attain sharia), when asked to go into the details of these 
goals (for example the sharia) will come up with thousands of 
opposing interpretations. 
  When, however, asked to go into the details of the political 
dimensions of the Prosperity identity the members will agree in 
general irrespective of their region or ethnic origin. The 
political dimension is also very dynamic, constantly developing 
and changing, but it keeps on coming to the very same point: 
That of gaining political power. 
<H5>  [11 Apr p 21] </H5>
  [Text] According to unofficial final results of the 27 
March 1994 local elections, the Prosperity Party [PP] received a 
total of 5,340,969 votes. It increased its share of the vote to 
19 percent, and got a total of 327 mayoral positions of which 
six were in cities, 22 in provinces, 92 in districts, and 207 in 
townships. These elections show that once again, the PP was very 
successful in the southeast. It got the mayoral positions in 
the provinces of Mus, Agri, Bingol, Bitlis, Batman, Siirt, 
Diyarbakir, Van, Sanliurfa, and Adiyaman. As in the past, the 
PP received the highest rate of votes in the southeast. 
  Even though the official figures have not been released yet, 
it is believed that the election boycott by the Democracy Party 
[DEP] helped raise the number of PP's votes. It is being 
alleged that some of the voters abided by the DEP's instructions 
and either did not vote or cast invalid votes deliberately. It 
is being said that close to 50 percent of the voters boycotted 
the elections in certain parts of the southeast. 
  For example, the PP received 40,000 votes or 26.6 percent in 
Siirt in 1989. According to figures given by the TRT [Turkish 
Radio and Television], the PP received 21,000 votes in Siirt in 
the 1994 local elections. However, the rate was 31.5 percent. 
  The PP received 52,000 votes or 19.6 percent of the vote in 
Diyarbakir in 1989. This time, it received 25,000 more votes 
but managed to almost double its percentage of votes to 33 
percent. 
  Similarly, after five years, the PP got only 1,000 more 
votes 
in Mardin but its percentage went up by 6 percent. 
<H5>  The Effect of Kurdish Votes </H5>
  Another allegation that is being made is that in the 
southeast, the PP got a significant number of civil servants' 
votes, like policemen, special team members, officers and so on. 
DEP officials deny that DEP voters voted for the PP. However, 
it is conceivable that part of the DEP supporters gave up the 
boycott and voted for the centrist parties and the PP in order 
to prevent the election of the candidates of the Nationalist 
Action Party [NAP] and the Great Unity Party [GUP] -- parties 
which took part in the elections through state support. 
  Regardless of these facts, the 1994 local elections show 
that 
the PP took important steps in rehabilitating its relations with 
the southeast -- the PP's traditional vote depot. 
  A much more important conclusion we can draw from the 1994 
elections, is that the PP clearly showed that it is a movement 
that is centered in the big cities. It won the mayoral 
positions in five metropolises [as published] and 28 provinces 
[as published]. However, it lagged even behind the Social 
Democratic Populist Party [SDPP] by winning only a total of 338 
mayoral positions in districts and townships [as published]. 
  The PP won mayoral positions in the five provinces it had 
won 
in 1989 -- including in Van and Sanliurfa which it had lost in 
the by- elections. The other mayoral positions in 23 provinces 
it won this time used to belong to the following parties: 11 to 
the SDPP, six to the True Path Party [TPP], four to the 
Motherland Party [ANAP], one each to the Nationalist Labor Party 
[NLP] and the Republican People's Party [RPP]. 
  As you can see, the PP got mayoral positions and 
consequently 
the votes from all the parties, but particularly from the SDPP 
which had emerged as the victorious party in the 1989 local 
elections. By getting the mayoral positions in the metropolises 
of Istanbul and Ankara, the PP confirmed that. 
  The March 1994 elections also confirmed that the PP's engine 
power is its organization in Istanbul. In earlier elections, 
the PP's average percentage for all of Turkey and for Istanbul 
were almost the same, while this time the average for Istanbul 
was 5 to 6 points higher. As a result, the PP got 17 mayoral 
positions in Istanbul. 
<H5>  The Success in the Metropolitan Areas </H5>
  The PP, which entered the political scene in the 1984 local 
elections with a 4.4 percent vote, increased its number of votes 
in every subsequent election, finally reaching 19.0 percent in 
the 1994 local elections. A comparative study of the number of 
votes received by the PP in all the elections demonstrate that 
contrary to common belief, this party is not a "peasant" party, 
but an urban party which is developing in the cities. The PP, 
which proved it is an urban party by winning the mayoral posts 
in 28 provinces in the latest elections, has actually been an 
urban party since the first elections it participated in. 
  When we study the number of PP votes in the 26 largest 
provinces, we see that the PP received more votes than its 
nationwide average in 11 of these provinces in 1984, in seven of 
them in 1987, in nine of them in 1989, in 10 of them in 1991, 
and in 11 of them in 1994. The list of these 11 provinces in the 
latest elections presents an interesting picture: Ankara, 
Diyarbakir, Erzurum, Gaziantep, Istanbul, Kayseri, Kocaeli, 
Konya, Kahramanmaras, Sakarya, and Trabzon. Given the fact 
that, except the last three provinces, eight provinces have 
metropolitan area status from a local authority viewpoint and 
that the total number of metropolitan areas in Turkey is 15, we 
can conclude that the PP is the choice of approximately one out 
of four voters in more than half of the country's leading 
industrial, commercial, educational, tourism, cultural, and 
administrative centers. The PP, which lost the mayoral 
elections in Gaziantep and Kocaeli to SDPP by only a slight 
margin, won the mayoral posts in all the metropolitan areas in 
central and eastern Anatolia. 
<H5>  The Areas Where the PP is Weak </H5>
  The four provinces where the PP is weakest consist of 
Edirne, 
Kirklareli, Mugla, an Tunceli. In Antalya, Aydin, Canakkale, 
Denizli, Izmir, Icel, Kastamonu, Tekirdag, Bartin, and Ardahan, 
the PP received between 5 and 10 percent of the votes. In other 
words, with the exceptions of Tunceli and Ardahan, the PP is 
unable to rise to prominence in the coastal strips of the 
Aegean, the Mediterranean, and the western Black Sea. The PP, 
which increased its votes by 14.6 points in 10 years, owes this 
increase largely to central, eastern, and southeast Anatolia, 
and the industrial regions in the eastern Black Sea and Marmara. 
  To understand the extent of the success attained by the PP 
in 
the recent elections, it will be more meaningful to compare the 
results of the 27 March 1994 elections to the results of the 
1989 local elections. The 1991 general elections could lead to 
misleading comparisons because of the alliances. The PP 
increased its votes by nine points in five years and did not 
regress in any of the regions. The lowest increases were noted 
in Mugla at 0.8 percent, in Edirne at 1.2 percent, in Kirklareli 
at 1.6 percent, and in Kastamonu at 2.3 percent. The biggest 
leap forward of 21.5 percent was registered in Malatya. This 
was followed by 19.3 percent in Bingol, 15.9 in Sakarya, 15.2 in 
Erzincan, 14.5 in Adiyaman, 14.4 in Ankara, 14.1 in Istanbul, 
Kayseri, and Kocaeli, and 14.04 in Corum. 
<H5>  The PP-NAP Rivalry </H5>
  It became clear in the 1994 elections that the 
nationalist-conservative votes, which were concentrated in ANAP 
and the TPP in the wake of the 12 September 1980 military 
intervention, moved away from the center in the past 10 years. 
In the 1991 elections, the PP-NLP-Democratic Reform Party [DRP] 
alliance received 16.9 percent of the votes. In 1994, the PP 
won 19.0 percent, the NLP, which now goes under the name of NAP, 
won 8.0 percent, the GUP, which broke off from the NAP, won 1.2 
percent, and the DRP, which changed its name to Nation Party 
[NP], received 0.4 percent of the votes. In other words, the 
total percent of the votes received by the alliance exceeded 28. 
The total number of votes received by the PP, the NAP, the GUP, 
and the NP ranged between 40 and 50 percent in the following 
provinces: Bayburt, Yozgat, Sivas, Erzurum, Bingol, Konya, 
Kayseri, Gumushane, Karaman, Cankiri, Elazig, Corum, Aksaray, 
Erzincan, Kahramanmaras. 
  In most of these provinces, there was a fierce race between 
the PP and the NAP. While scoring points by "not recognizing 
the Kurdish reality," the NAP used the democratic line advocated 
by some of the "civilian" members of the rival party for the 
solution of the Kurdish problem as an excuse to accuse these 
persons of belonging to the PKK [Workers Party of Kurdistan]. 
Democratic Left Party leader Bulent Ecevit's "pro-Kurdish" 
accusation leveled at the PP served the interests of the NAP in 
these areas. 
  While both parties tried to steal votes from the Sunni- 
conservative grassroots, the PP developed policies for the 
benefit of low-income Alawite citizens, who live in shantytowns 
in urban centers, who have been alienated from the social 
democrats, and who are afraid of the NAP. Although it is 
difficult to prove, it appears that the PP received votes from 
this sector as well. 
<H5>  [12 Apr p 21] </H5>
  [Text] Following the Prosperity Party [PP] victory in the 
local elections, there is new tension. This is felt among 
citizens who engage in largely prejudicial predictions regarding 
the possible measures PP municipalities may adopt. These 
individuals are apprehensive about these possible changes. For 
others the election victory symbolizes that "the time for 
revenge has finally come." This tension is felt in our daily 
life. 
  The tension stems from the fact that PP opponents and 
supporters do not consider themselves equal. The opponents of 
the PP consider themselves above the supporters of the party. 
These opponents attempt to prove their superiority through 
arguments such as "they are 18 percent, as opposed to our 82 
percent." The opponents are especially unable to accept the 
fact that the PP will run the municipalities of Ankara and 
Istanbul. 
  The supporters of the party, on the other hand, believe that 
the election results accord them superiority. We observe that 
this sector of the population -- scorned since the republic's 
establishment and treated as second-class citizens to be ignored 
rather than accorded the proportional interest it deserved prior 
to the recent elections -- is afflicted with a wounded sense of 
citizenship accompanied by a wounded awareness of Islam. These 
mutual claims of superiority become claims of the real ownership 
over Turkey. The "Istanbul is ours and will remain ours" 
slogans heard during PP demonstrations merely epitomize the "us 
and them" discrimination. 
<H5>  Is the Prosperity Victory Lasting? </H5>
  Even though the PP failed to attain Necmettin Erbakan's goal 
of "30-35 percent of the votes and 1,000 municipal posts," it is 
clear that the party emerged victorious from the 1994 elections. 
Also clear is that the fragmentation of the centrist parties 
contributed to this election victory. This victory, however, 
brings the PP to the brink of a test for which it may be 
unprepared. 
  The PP, gained strength far from public view. Developing 
away from the political limelight resulted in certain advantages 
as well as disadvantages for the party. There is no need to 
dwell on the advantages, but the degree to which the PP will 
brave the disadvantages will determine the future of this party. 
The mayoral posts it has won could make or break the PP, 
because it must satisfy many categories with different 
expectations. The traditional grassroots of the National View 
movement occupies the top of this list. To please this sector, 
which for better or for worse has Islamic aspirations, the 
municipalities of the PP must adopt some Islamization measures. 
This is required to dismiss criticism from Islamic circles 
which accuse the PP of not being pro-Islam. These 
municipalities are also obliged to engage in Islamization moves 
to distinguish them from other parties. Moreover, this will 
enable them to win over the conservative masses which lean 
towards the rightist parties outside the PP. If the promises to 
build a mosque in Taksim Square; close down the public brothels; 
allocate different buses for female students; and refuse 
licenses for alcoholic drinks are fulfilled, these will 
inevitably be followed by other measures. Given the fact that 
the biggest wish of the PP grassroots consists of not allowing 
women with uncovered heads to work in PP municipalities and, if 
possible, not allowing women to work in these places altogether, 
we can say that this is the limit of the Islamization measures. 
<H5>  Work, Food, and Service </H5>
  The PP municipalities, however, will feel the shadow of the 
state, especially the army, over them in all their moves, 
particularly in the big cities. It is therefore very likely 
that the PP administration will follow previous mayors and not 
allow the state to interfere, in matters such as closing down 
brothels and tell its grassroots, who are demanding further 
Islamization measures, to "wait until the party takes over the 
government and establishes a just order." 
  The sector that will push the PP furthest consists of the 
needy and destitute masses who sympathized with the party for 
socioeconomic reasons. These masses, who are difficult to 
please with Islamization measures, are expecting employment, 
food, and service. The PP approached these masses with populist 
statements and extended assistance in cash or in kind, thus 
giving the message that "what we are doing is the guarantee of 
what we will do in the future." The PP must now develop 
concrete projects and realize them successfully. 
  The claim that there will be no bribery or corruption in PP 
municipalities will be put to the test during this period. The 
PP will try at all costs not to allow any black marks to tarnish 
its municipalities until the first elections. To this end, PP 
mayors, who are obliged to continue to work to a large extent 
with the old cadres, will try to control the old personnel 
through trusted persons they will place in key positions. It is 
evident that during this coming period, allegations against the 
PP will focus on nepotism rather than bribery and corruption. 
<H5>  Imitating the Motherland Party [ANAP] </H5>
  PP mayors can also be expected to launch several "mega" 
projects. Conservative business circles will be the first ones 
to come to mind for new resources. Many businessmen will 
inevitably discover conservatism in the wake of the PP municipal 
election victory. It is known that MUSIAD [?Muslim Businessmen 
Association] gained many new members after the elections. For 
example, Ankara Mayor Melih Gokcek referred to "ultra mega" 
projects and said that these will be submitted to a tender in 
the private sector. The PP is showing signs that it will 
imitate the ANAP municipalities during the years 1984-1989. 
This may be followed by a recourse to oil-rich Arab countries, 
using PP leader Erbakan's connections. 
  Even if resources are found, it will be necessary to find 
the 
necessary personnel. In actual fact, the conservative sector 
has sufficient professional administrators to manage all of the 
country's municipalities. It is not clear, however, to what 
extent the PP will or will want to benefit from them. The fate 
of the PP municipalities will be directly affected by whether 
personnel appointments will be determined according to loyalty 
or merit. PP mayors may be expected to act rationally, but it 
is also possible that the party headquarters and Erbakan will 
appoint "political commissioners" to important municipalities. 
Moreover, Tayyip Erdogan and Melih Gokcek could each rise 
towards the position of party leadership. 
<H5>  Mega Projects </H5>
  The "better understanding from technology" element of the 
PP's Islamic grassroots will gain confidence in proportion to 
the success of "mega" projects. In addition, circles outside 
the PP will become more tolerant of this party with each 
success. However, these projects are directed toward the 
"center" and therefore the poor, who shifted their preference 
from the social democrats to the PP, will not be that affected 
by these projects, apart from temporary employment 
possibilities. The masses looking for "now, instant" solutions 
to their problems will find no answers from the "mega" projects 
because they are long-term projects. 
  So, what the PP leaders carry out in this sector -- in 
addition to distributing food during Ramadan and fuel in winter; 
conducting collective circumcisions and establishing a "marriage 
waqf" for the young people -- is very important. 
  In the past, the PP district mayors complained of not 
getting 
enough attention and support from the SDPP Metropolitan Mayor 
Nurettin Sozen [as published]. They no longer have such 
problems. Will the SDPP or ANAP mayors of Sisli, Bakirkoy, 
Besiktas, and Kadikoy have similar problems? Tayyip Erdogan is 
making promises that he will treat everybody equally. Will he 
be able to keep his promise? 
  Will the en masse layoffs -- postponed by other PP 
municipalities until after the elections -- be implemented after 
the reactions in Kagithane? If they are, what guidelines will 
there be? Will PP supporters be given the jobs of those who 
were laid off? This type of questioning can be expanded. It 
will then be obvious that the PP mayors will be subjected to the 
same questions addressed to other party leaders. The difference 
is that the PP has not yet been tested in municipalities and its 
perspective from outside the system due to its Islamic motifs. 
<H5>  [13 Apr p 21] </H5>
  [Text] The National View achieved the biggest ascent in 
its history on 27 March 1994 and has embarked on an unknown 
future. Undoubtedly, this future will be determined by the steps 
taken by the Prosperity Party [PP] and its rivals and changes in 
international and national conjunctures. The rivals must have 
noticed that it suits the PP to be presented as a force "outside 
the system." However, instead of admitting the truth, they are 
developing a new strategy of challenging the PP to prove its 
sincerity by presenting the PP's claims of being an insider as a 
new situation. 
  To determine its future, the PP must be successful in the 
municipalities, or at least give that impression. This is 
essential, but not sufficient on its own. Whether it wants it 
or not, the PP, which has become the party of the masses, has to 
abide by these requirements. Otherwise, efforts to keep the 
"ideological backbone" in good condition can take it back to the 
10 percent margin. 
  PP circles can certainly get rid of the "party of the 
masses" 
label which is associated with degeneration, but the first 
condition for this is the full operation of the democratic 
channels inside the party. This is the most important handicap 
facing the PP. The PP's success stems also from the party 
administration preventing the natural organizational 
permutations. On account of its centralized structure -- far 
from democratic -- a great number of sectors which contributed 
to PP's success are not represented in its leadership. The 
National Youth Waqf -- the backbone of the party -- is headed 
by leaders and administrators who are not young anymore and the 
ladies committees are supervised by certain members of the 
provincial administrative councils. In short, the PP leadership 
is approaching its grassroots with affection but with suspicion. 
<H5>  Women in the PP </H5>
  A study of the status of PP women, who greatly contributed 
to 
the success of the party and who are expected to influence its 
future, offers important data regarding intraparty democracy. 
There were no women mayoral candidates, although it is women 
who constitute the most dynamic groups at all party meetings and 
who have knocked on every door to conduct party propaganda. In 
an interview published in the March 1994 issue of NEHIR 
magazine, Sibel Eraslan, chairman of the PP Istanbul Women's 
Committee, said: "Currently, we are in the center of active 
politics. It will be the PP women who will decide whether or 
not to assume office in local authorities or in the central 
administration, on the condition that our delegates make such a 
request and our administrators view it positively. This is a 
matter of historical process, which will finally be decided upon 
by PP women. I know that our delegates proposed the names of 
some of our colleagues for membership in municipal councils. In 
other words, we have names for candidates, but only God knows 
what the future holds." 
  After this interview, Eraslan, whom we met at the 25 March 
Sultanahmet meeting, said that only five PP women in Bakirkoy, 
Beykoz, and Kadikoy were submitted as municipal council member 
candidates out of all the districts in Istanbul. Another PP 
member had earlier reported that serious discussions were 
conducted at provincial and district administrative councils on 
the subject of women candidates and that a significant part of 
the all-male administrators opposed women candidates on the 
grounds that it constitutes "liberalism." Women in the PP, 
whose duty to care for children and cook can be overlooked when 
it is necessary to knock on doors to promote the party, are told 
that "their place is in the home" when they want to exercise the 
right to be elected. As stated by Eraslan, however, the PP 
women who are at the center of active politics, know and are 
learning that, in addition to the right to elect, which is 
considered sacred by their administrators, they are the ones who 
will decide whether they want to exercise their right to be 
elected. As it happens, Eraslan declares that she will become a 
deputy, but she must wait three years until she is 30 years old. 
<H5>  Intellectuals in the PP </H5>
  The PP's future will also be determined by the nature of its 
relations with independent Muslim intellectuals. The PP, which 
has stayed away from intellectuals in the past for fear that 
they will voice opinions against party discipline, has begun 
opening up to them in recent years. The PP submitted some 
Muslim nonparty candidates during the general and local 
elections based on the belief that they will not pose any 
problems because of the responsibility they will shoulder; and 
this proved to be largely justified. 
  The party, which is now at the head of many municipalities, 
needs educated people at least to conduct cultural activities. 
It is known, however, that some young Muslim intellectuals, who 
were employed as press or cultural advisers in district 
municipalities, did not work in harmony with the mayors. The 
mayors were not willing to provide a wide autonomous area for 
these intellectuals who accepted the jobs because they were in 
financial difficulties. The formula of "how much money do you 
want?" will probably continue because there are many needy 
university graduates, educated religious intellectuals, and 
semi-intellectuals. There will certainly also be PP mayors who 
will regard the creativity and industriousness of Muslim 
intellectuals as an advantage and not view the issue as a simple 
employment procedure. It is these mayors who can seriously 
contribute to Turkey's cultural life and improve the PP's image. 
<H5>  Democracy Is the Solution </H5>
  It is claimed that PP municipalities will restrain 
themselves 
and try to appear charming to outsiders for two years because of 
the upcoming general elections in 1996. According to another 
claim, the PP will benefit from the further impoverishment of 
the large masses as a result of the "historic stability package" 
announced on 5 April 1994. 
  However, the fact that PP leader Necmettin Erbakan warned 
Prime Minister Tansu Ciller, who explained the stability 
measures to him, about "possible social explosions" could be 
seen as an indication that this prediction is not necessarily 
correct. If the economic measures fail and the system 
collapses, the PP will also be crushed under the wreckage, 
because it is also part of the system. 
  All the same, as in many other things, the PP is capable of 
benefiting from the stability package as well, because among the 
big parties, the socioeconomic opposition argument of "the rich 
are becoming richer and the poor are becoming poorer" has been 
monopolized by the PP. If the stability package falls short of 
causing the total collapse of the system and merely results in 
the people's suffering, then, barring extraordinary 
circumstances, PP victory in the coming elections appears to be 
certain. 
  The PP victory is an opportunity for Turkey to return to 
real 
politics and shatter the depoliticization of the 12 September 
period. But, the sectors which do not have the strength or the 
inclination to compete with the PP in the political arena are 
consciously rejecting this opportunity and calling each other 
for help. 
  It is desirable for Turkey as a whole that the PP, which 
contains fundamentalist, democratic, authoritarian, as well as 
pro-freedom elements, adopt a democratic line, just like the 
other parties. Everyone has a duty with regard to the 
democratization of the PP. Everyone now has a right to speak 
about the PP, which has become the property of the whole of 
Turkey for the first time. Those who do not support the PP 
should seek ways of coexisting and working together in mutual 
understanding with PP supporters, while maintaining their 
differences.

<F P=106> [Interview with UN Secretary General Butrus Butrus-Ghali by </F>
Sir David Frost; from the "Breakfast with Frost" program on 24 
April; Frost in studio, Butrus-Ghali in New York -- recorded] 
  [Text] [Frost] Earlier I spoke with the United Nations 
Secretary General Butrus Butrus-Ghali, and I began by asking him 
whether the UN would authorize air strikes if the Serbs met some 
but not all of NATO's conditions. 
  [Butrus-Ghali] This is a very technical question, I perceive 
that this had to be negotiated by the people who are on the 
ground. If they see that the violation is a real violation then 
we will use the air strikes without hesitation. 
  [Frost] If there is no response to the ultimatum, how does 
the coordination work. Can NATO then on the basis of your 
letter, and so on, can they just go ahead with air strikes, or 
do they have to get your approval? 
  [Butrus-Ghali] They have to get the approval of my special 
representative who is on the ground, because we have troops in a 
United Nations forces on the ground, and we must protect them. 
So the special representative in coordination or collaboration 
with the command of United Nations on the ground will decide 
where and when they have to use the air support. 
  [Frost] They will decide that? 
  [Butrus-Ghali] Yes. In other words you need the agreement of 
the two parties -- the NATO and the United Nations. 
  [Frost] Then what about when it comes, Mr. Secretary 
General, 
to the actual targets, do they have to be specifically agreed. 
I mean if one side wants to attack only encampments.... 
  [Butrus-Ghali] ...do you see, there is a perfect 
coordination 
between the military people of the NATO and the military people 
of the United Nations, they will coordinate and they will chose 
together what are the targets which ought to be bombed by the 
NATO air power. 
  [Frost] And what about when it comes time to stop. If either 
one, if either the UN or NATO want to stop, then the bombing 
stops? 
  [Butrus-Ghali] Yes, supposing that the United Nations say 
for 
the time being it will represent a danger for our soldiers or we 
are negotiating and let us postpone this air strike. They will 
coordinate with the NATO, and the NATO will postpone. 
  [Frost] Do you think secretary general, that in fact these 
air strikes could -- we've seen indications of this -- could 
these air strikes endanger in fact, either UN personnel or UN 
peacekeeping forces? 
  [Butrus-Ghali] This is why we are coordinating and this is 
why we are insisting to obtain the agreement of the UN. This is 
the reason that we want to offer the maximum of protection to 
our United Nations staff, to our personnel working in the 
humanitarian assistance, and to the peacekeeping forces. 
  [Frost] There hasn't been progress in Bosnia, and of course 
the blame has been attached to the UN. Has it been a major blow 
to the UN the fact that there's been no progress? 
  [Butrus-Ghali] Certainly it is a blow to the image of the 
UN, but the expert who knows the reality knows quite well that 
the responsibility is shared between the UN and the major member 
states. The UN have no army, no money, so unless the member 
states will be ready to sustain the decision which had been 
adopted by the UN, i.e. by the member states, we will not be 
able to execute the different resolutions that have been 
adopted. So there is a very special relation between the UN and 
the member states. 
  [Frost] And in fact you're disappointed really at the number 
of troops made available? 
  [Butrus-Ghali] This is another aspect -- we have, since June 
last year, been trying to obtain additional troops, and we have 
obtained a resolution from the Security Council, but we have not 
been able to obtain those additional troops. Because the air 
strikes have a value of dissuasion to reinforce the bargaining 
position of my mediators, but practically unless we have ground 
forces, our forces on the ground, it will be quite difficult to 
obtain a military result with air power only. 
  [Frost] So you were disappointed I presume, that when Friday 
[22 April], President Clinton reaffirmed that his troops would 
only be available after a peace. You need troops before a peace. 
  [Butrus-Ghali] Yes I need troops before peace, but I was not 
disappointed, because I know quite well what are the positions 
of the United States, and the position of many other major 
members of the international community, who are ready to help 
the United Nations in different other activities, but not in 
participating in peacekeeping operations. 
  [Frost] In terms of the situation though, this action and 
the 
fact that you asked for this action at the beginning of the 
week, I suppose means that you've decided that as of now the 
Bosnian Serbs -- the target of these air strikes -- are the 
aggressors? 
  [Butrus-Ghali] Yes. The Bosnians are the aggressors, but you 
see you may have aggressors from the other side too. So the air 
strike will punish all those who are not respecting the 
resolutions adopted by the United Nations, or the last 
resolution which was adopted the NATO. 
  [Frost] And Mr. Akashi made a reference a few days ago to 
there being certain circumstances in which the UN might pull out 
of Bosnia. Are there any circumstances in which you might pull 
out of Bosnia? 
  [Butrus-Ghali] Certainly I will not advocate this. But this 
decision, if it will have to be taken, has to be taken by the 
Security Council. Because the troops are there according to a 
decision which was taken by the Security Council. If we want to 
pull out the troops, to diminish the number of the troops, this 
is a decision that will have to be taken by the Security 
Council. I'm in favor to maintain our presence, to continue to 
work on the ground until we will find a solution to this problem. 
  [Frost] Tell me something secretary general, looking back 
over the last two years or so, can you perceive from your unique 
position, was there somewhere where the international community, 
the nations of the world, the tactics went wrong? 
  [Butrus-Ghali] Yes I believe that what is important [is] 
that 
during the last two years, that the member states still have not 
decided if they want to reinforce the United Nations or not. 
The member states have not decided if they want to give a role 
to the United Nations in peacekeeping operations, in solving 
international disputes, in reinforcing international 
cooperation. There is still [the fact that] the United Nations 
as such is not a priority for the majority of the member states. 
They have their bilateral diplomacy, they have their own 
defense, and the United Nations is an important instrument but 
it is still a marginal instrument. And this is one of the 
explanations why, during the last two years, we have not been 
able to cope with all the problems, because we have received 
demands every day from the 1,600 observers who are working now 
in South Africa, to control the elections, to the negotiations 
that are going on in Salvador, or in Guatemala, to the situation 
in Kigali, or in Bujumbura or in Mozambique, or in Angola.... 
  [Frost] So are you saying you think that while it's clear 
that the UN can succeed at peacekeeping, that in fact 
peacemaking is getting too difficult a task? 
  [Butrus-Ghali] I will say that UN can succeed in 
peacekeeping 
and UN can even succeed in peacemaking or even in peace 
enforcement, on condition that we receive the necessary support 
from the member states. There are certain elements where 
certainly we failed, like what happened in Goradze is a failure 
for the United Nations, I will even say more, it is a 
humiliation for the United Nations, but this is one setback. 
You must see the other element of the other situation where we 
have been successful -- in Cambodia, in Salvador. 
  [Frost] Do you think there's any hope that the safe havens, 
so-called, will become safe in the future or will the phrase 
safe haven seem like a bitter joke? 
  [Butrus-Ghali] No the safe haven is just a step toward the 
comprehensive solution of the problem of former Yugoslavia. The 
safe haven must be considered as just a step. We need to 
continue to negotiate, we need a global approach so that we will 
reach a comprehensive peace and a comprehensive just and lasting 
peace in former Yugoslavia. We must continue to negotiate, we 
must continue the dialogue until we find a peaceful solution. 
And until we move to a second step -- we have already appointed 
a coordinator in Sarajevo for the reconstruction, because this 
is the first step, once we agree then we have to build the 
peace, we have to do the reconstruction, the rehabilitation, the 
return of millions of refugees.

<F P=106> [Report by Dieter Kindermann: "Haider: FPOe Will Carry Out </F>
Anti-EU Campaign After All!"] 
  [Text] Vienna -- The FPOe [Freedom Party of Austria] has 
turned a new pirouette in its dance on eggs regarding the 
European Union [EU]: It is going to embark on an anti-EU 
campaign after all. "Contrary to our original intentions," 
Joerg Haider admitted yesterday. Why are they doing it then? 
"Because the chances are very favorable that we can still stop 
the government taking the wrong path it is taking," Haider 
stated. 
  At the FPOe's special congress on the EU in Villach on 9 
April, 85.5 percent of the delegates voted for the double 
strategy: 

  -  The FPOe members of parliament were urged to 
reject the EU laws; 
  -  FPOe supporters and citizens are, however, 
given a free choice in the referendum. 
  At yesterday's FPOe Executive Committee meeting behind 
closed 
doors in Bad Tatzmannsdorf it was decided to initiate an anti-EU 
campaign. Haider said, "I myself will appear at large rallies 
to clearly explain the FPOe's arguments for Austria and against 
the EU of Maastricht." 
  One of the FPOe's prominent politicians, Hirnschall, 
expressed disappointment: "This does not correspond to what was 
decided in Villach. There was no mention of an anti-EU 
campaign." Hirnschall said that the campaign is "a danger for 
EU membership, because it will certainly arouse emotions and 
heat up the atmosphere."

<F P=106> [Interview with Wim Kok, Labor Party leader, by Frank Van </F>
Emel; place and date not given: "Kok, the Changed Labor Party 
Leader"--first paragraph is Rotterdam NRC HANDELSBLAD 
introduction] 
  [Excerpts] [passage omitted] Wim Kok only comes into his 
element when he starts talking about content. He can speak 
passionately about the new approach the outgoing government had 
to the environment, the Treaty of Maastricht, and social 
renewal. His approach is based on convincing people, on finding 
support within society, rather than on rules and regulations 
imposed from above. Kok wants to continue in this way during the 
next term of government. His outline says a great deal about 
the way he wants to govern the country. "Traditional policy, as 
pursued in this country," the PvdA leader says, "is too often 
based on implementing a couple of objectives laid down in a 
government pact. It is rare for a process-based approach to be 
adopted, with the question "what do you want?" being immediately 
linked to the question "how are you going to do it? I am in 
favor of such a process-based approach for the next government. 
If we form the new government in a couple of weeks time, I will 
press for a new style of government along these lines." 
  [Empel] What does that mean specifically? 
  [Kok] I am convinced that if we state that we are going to 
help thousands of the long-term unemployed to find a job, it 
remains a nonstarter if you do not simultaneously try to 
implement such a project from the ground up. Specifically, this 
means that divisions between institutions, the employment 
office, social service, and various training institutes must be 
removed and that room must be created for initiative and 
creativity. 
  [Empel] That is like the approach adopted by Bill Clinton 
and 
Al Gore in the United States: Reinventing government. 
  [Kok] Yes. I discussed this recently with Frank de Grave. 
An excellent man, De Grave (VVD [People's Party for Freedom and 
Democracy] alderman for finances on the Amsterdam city council 
-- NRC HANDELSBLAD editor's note). When forming the Amsterdam 
city council, several parties were in favor of further 
developing the "Jan Schaefer school of thought," namely the 
productive use of benefit money to create jobs in the care 
sector, public supervision, etc. We came to the mutual 
conclusion that we must be through with bureaucracies. And this 
requires a project-based approach: If you do not decide to do 
this when forming a new government, then you may as well forget 
about it altogether. That is my aim when forming a new 
government. [passage omitted] 
  [Empel] Over the last 18 months, without being aware of it, 
we have been presented with a new Kok. Can this Kok, for 
example, also get on with D66 [Democratic 66] leader Hans van 
Mierlo? Or is Van Mierlo still wary following the 1989 
government? 
  [Kok] I don't think so. It is so long ago. Three matters 
were involved when forming that government: The number of 
ministers, the furious opposition to the D66 by the CDA 
[Christian Democrat Party] which feared its own position of 
power would be compromised and our own strong preference to 
simply get on with running the country. The danger that such a 
government with the PvdA would not be achieved weighed very 
heavily among the PvdA faction. Since then, relations between 
the D66 and the PvdA in general, and between Hans and myself in 
particular, have sufficiently normalized to be able to look to 
the future with a great deal of confidence. 
  [Empel] Your consensus approach does not always have the 
desired effect. Things went seriously wrong over the WAO [Law 
on Labor Disability] with the previous government . 
  [Kok] The WAO was a different kind of matter. In that case, 
it was not enough to set a course and to acquire the widest 
possible support. Something of this nature applies to major 
infrastructure projects: the extension of Schiphol airport, the 
Betuwe line. There also you are facing fundamental conflicts of 
interest, which you cannot overcome with conviction alone. 
  You often hear calls for a better presentation. Hans van 
Mierlo is very good at that. I then say: If that leads to 
saying "we need more time" -- when you know very well that there 
is no alternative -- then you are avoiding your responsibility 
to make decisions which will have to be made sooner or later. 
The D66 does that more often. In the case of the Betuwe line, 
Schiphol, and the WAO. 
  [Empel] What do you think needs to change in the next 
government? 
  [Kok] Governing over the next four years is not a matter of 
business as usual. We must perform better on a number of 
points. Is the citizen getting sufficient value for his money? 
We must set ourselves a task. Not fine sentences laid down in 
a government pact but an action plan. And if bureaucracies have 
to be brushed aside to make room, so be it. That is the only 
way to restore trust to the citizens. If such a new approach 
results in recognizable results, the citizen will once again 
believe that the government is there for him and not that he is 
there for the government.

<F P=106> [By Stephen Alderman, PRESS ASSOCIATION parliamentary staff] </F>
  [Text] Foreign Secretary Douglas Hurd today rejected 
Opposition demands for more United Nations troops to be sent to 
war-torn Rwanda. Labour Foreign Affairs Spokesman Dr Kim 
Howells said 100,000 people had been slaughtered in the Central 
African country in the past two weeks. He asked why Britain had 
approved a UN decision to reduce peace-keeping troops there from 
2,700 to 270. "Is there one level of compassion for our 
European friends in Bosnia and another for black Africans?" 
  Brian Donohoe, Labour MP for Cunninghame South, protested 
the 
UN security force in Rwanda was doing "absolutely nothing." He 
demanded: "When is the Government going to put pressure on the 
UN to bring back the troops to safeguard the lives of those that 
are being slaughtered in that country today?" 
  Mr Hurd replied: "I am not sure how either of you suppose 
that maintaining a UN force at the original scale is going to 
help assuage these horrors." 
  The UN Security Council had concluded it was no longer 
possible for the UN force to carry out its mandate, he said. 
"I assure you there is no magic in keeping troops there, if 
there is not something useful which they can do."

Kanther and his Croatian counterpart, Ivan Jarnjak, signed an 
agreement in Bonn today which makes provisions for, among other 
things, the repatriation of former civil war refugees from 
Croatia. The Interior Ministry announced in Bonn today that the 
federal states can now begin repatriation on 1 May. This 
applies to refugees who came to Germany before 22 May 1992. 
  To handle the devastation caused by the war, repatriation 
will take place in stages. Moreover, refugees from the areas of 
Croatia occupied, disputed, or devastated by the Serbs will not 
be returned until a second phase in the first half year of 1995.

<F P=106> [Report by Sebastiano Messina: "Berlusconi's `Mentor' </F>
Spadolini"] 
  [Excerpts] Rome -- It is true, [Forza Italia leader] 
Berlusconi is, as a matter of fact, thinking of a "guarantor" 
who would dispel any suspicions that he may mix his private 
interests with his official duties -- and it is precisely 
[former Senate Speaker] Giovanni Spadolini's name that he has in 
mind. The leaks published by LA REPUBBLICA about the long 
conversation at the Quirinale [president's palace] between the 
head of state and the man who by now is regarded as his nominee 
for the premiership were confirmed yesterday evening by 
Berlusconi spokesman Antonio Tajani. 
  A few lines, whose meaning is very clear: "Forza Italia 
Chairman Silvio Berlusconi is currently exploring a number of 
solutions to the question of guarantees, on the assumption that 
he might be entrusted with the task of forming the new 
government. One such possibility is that of an impartial 
guarantor. If we think in terms of a figure above suspicion and 
offering the guarantees of objectivity, independence, and 
honesty, we can only think of men of Giovanni Spadolini's 
stature." 
  A guarantor is therefore part of the Knight's [Berlusconi 
nickname] plans. But what real powers will he have? Ever since 
Silvio Berlusconi left [President] Oscar Luigi Scalfaro's study, 
promising Italians that, together with a list of ministers, he 
will also bring his "guarantee formula" to the Quirinale, the 
guarantor dilemma has become the real knot of the crisis. This, 
even more than the Viminale [Interior Ministry] and even more 
than federalism, is the last hurdle between the Knight and the 
Palazzo Chigi [government seat], the last formality before being 
crowned "premier" of the second republic. [Passage omitted] 
  The opposition, that is to say, the alignment that raised 
the 
problem of guarantees, smells a rat. "This guarantor story 
looks very much like a piece of mockery, an attempt to hoodwink 
Italians," [Segni Pact] Mariotto Segni remarked. Speaking on 
behalf of the Greens, [Greens' Coordinator] Carlo Ripa di Meana 
went as far as referring to a swindle: "Recently we have had our 
share of pasteboard guarantors, and of constantly infringed 
rules and practices. Now the idea of a superguarantor (whether 
Spadolini or someone else makes no difference), whose legal 
nature and authority are unclear, smacks of an attempt to betray 
the citizens' trust." "It is a lot of hot air, an absurd formula 
which makes no sense at all," PPI [Italian Popular Party] member 
Saverio D'Amelio said. 
  Not even the League seemed very enthusiastic about the 
possibility of a guarantor: "We would like to know what powers 
such a guarantor would have," Francesco Speroni, the League's 
floor leader in the Senate, warned, adding: "The real checks 
will be political in nature, because Berlusconi is not going to 
be Il Duce [Mussolini], only the prime minister. Of course, if 
we ever have a government full of Fininvest men, the day they 
constitute a majority and pass a decree-law for immediate 
execution, then the problem will arise...."

  [Text] The new Bosnia contact group -- which is designed to 
put political "punch" into the quest for a peace settlement -- 
is to visit the battle zones soon for urgent discussions with 
the warring parties. 
  This was decided at the first meeting of the group at the 
Foreign Office in London today. It comprises representatives of 
Russia, the United States, the European Union [EU] and the 
United Nations. 
  After the meeting a spokesman said: "They agreed their 
priority was to try to restore the momentum of the peace 
process. They will explore urgently the prospects for a 
cessation of hostilities and engaging the parties in 
negotiations about a settlement. 
  ``Their work will be conducted within the framework given by 
the EU and UN and the group will travel to Bosnia shortly for 
discussions with the parties,'' the spokesman added.

<F P=106> [Interview with UK Foreign Secretary Douglas Hurd by Peter </F>
Snow in London on 25 April from the "Newsnight" program -- 
recorded] 
  [Text] [Snow] I spoke to the Foreign Secretary Douglas 
Hurd, and I asked him whether the world wouldn't take this rush 
of meetings in London to mean that all was confusion and 
indecision. 
  [Hurd] Everyone today was clear on the military side. The 
Bosnian Serbs have to pull out beyond Gorazde, out of the 
exclusion zone, or they run the risk of being struck, so that's 
clear. 
  [Snow] Their troops as well, their infantry, all of them? 
  [Hurd] Their heavy weapons, the ones laid down in the NATO 
decision. But what we're also clear about is that the efforts 
being made by the Russians, by the Europeans, by the Americans 
for a negotiated settlement have got to be brought together, and 
that's the meaning and purpose of the contact group meeting here 
in the Foreign Office tomorrow. All of them together for the 
first time. 
  [Snow] Now the other part of tomorrow night's ultimatum 
talks 
about the other safe areas which are declared outside Sarajevo, 
Gorazde, and beyond that. How can you declare the intention 
that you have of protecting those safe areas with air strikes, 
when it failed in Gorazde? 
  [Hurd] Well, hasn't failed in Sarajevo and provided there 
are.... 
  [Snow, interrupting] We're talking about in Gorazde.... 
  [Hurd, interrupting] It hasn't worked so far in Gorazde and 
there's been hideous suffering and atrocity meanwhile. This 
comes down to the question of troops for the UN forces, because 
you need people on the ground, as well as forces in the air; 
it's something we discussed today. The troops contributors are 
not coming forward, the blockage is now the money, and it is 
extremely important that in the coming weeks everybody, but 
particularly the Americans, unloose the purse-strings so that 
the United Nations can actually put into the field the forces 
which it will need to implement peace as peace grows, as we hope 
it will. 
  [Snow] But they're not there at the moment, and yet you're 
declaring that you will protect these safe areas. Am I right? 
  [Hurd] They are there at the moment. Every one of the safe 
areas that you mentioned, except Gorazde, has UN forces in 
them.... 
  [Snow, interrupting] Enough? 
  [Hurd] Enough for the purpose of the Security Council 
resolution and the NATO decision. If we were to extend that 
principle to other areas, not named -- and you are perfectly 
right, we don't at the moment have the resources, which is why 
we are not doing that. 
  [Snow] But let me be clear. You are saying that if the Serbs 
try in Zepa, in Srebrenica, in Tuzla, what they did in Gorazde 
-- you know you will be able to stop them? 
  [Hurd] I believe we will be able to stop them. There are 
troops there, and they now have a clear warning, a clear 
decision about an exclusion zone. Neither of those facts were 
there in Gorazde last week. 
  [Snow] Do you think on the whole, looking back over this 
whole thing, it was a mistake to commit yourself to principles, 
to policies, that you simply were unwilling to defend in 
practice? 
  [Hurd] The safe areas -- the Security Council named them as 
safe areas and at the same time appealed for troops. We 
responded, the French responded, one or two other countries 
responded, but the total response was inadequate. So you got 
the situation which haunts us from Goradze.... 
  [Snow, interrupting] Why didn't you say they weren't safe 
any more? Why didn't you say they are not safe, those safe areas? 
  [Hurd] Because then that of course is an immediate incentive 
to overrun them, but when we got to Maglaj this year, I made it 
quite clear that we could not support naming new safe areas, 
until there were troops to make them safe. Which is what has 
happened in Maglaj. So there is a lesson to be drawn there. 
But I believe now as regards the areas which have been covered 
it will be possible to secure them. 
  [Snow] So looking very broadly ahead at a timetable, this 
contact group sits down tomorrow, it works out guidelines for 
the way forward from here. When, realistically, would you hope 
to see a cease-fire throughout Bosnia? 
  [Hurd] I think it's a cessation of hostilities, i.e. it's a 
bit more than just a cease-fire, it's actually getting the heavy 
weapons, it's dealing with it in the same way as Sarajevo has 
been dealt with. I can't tell you the answer to that. I think 
the Bosnian Muslims will be reluctant simply to see the Serbs 
sit on the existing lines with any air of permanence. Therefore 
one has to link the cessation of hostilities with the effort and 
the pressure to get the Serbs to withdraw into the sort of map 
which has to be agreed and gives them a fair but not excessive 
share of the Bosnia in which all three communities have to live. 
  [Snow] Do you think if we look very coolly at what the Serbs 
have achieved so far, do you think they must be very nearly at 
the limit of what they actually aim to achieve in terms of 
conquest? 
  [Hurd] But they won't be able to retain it. There's no real 
life there, and in order to get life going again for themselves 
and their children, they are going to have to withdraw from a 
large part of the territory they occupy. That is what -- the 
contact group is just a diplomatic technique -- but that is what 
the rest of the world, including the Russians, have to point out 
to them.

  [Text] Tashkent, April 26 (AFP) -- French President 
Francois Mitterrand, in Uzbekistan Tuesday [26 April], called 
for an immediate international conference on Bosnia, involving 
the European Union, Russia, the United States and the United 
Nations. 
  A conference proposed by Russian President Boris Yeltsin and 
supported by U.S. President Bill Clinton for next month "must 
take place but sooner, if possible immediately," Mitterrand said. 
  "The way the military conflict is taking the upper hand over 
diplomatic negotiations must not be allowed," he told a press 
conference. 
  A contact group was formed in London at ambassadorial level 
Monday to try to coordinate policy on ending the fighting in 
Bosnia. The group comprises representatives of the United 
States, Russia, the European Union and the United Nations. 
  "It is time that the great powers, together with the warring 
parties, set out an accord that it suits them to agree to," 
Mitterrand said Tuesday. 
  "The process of demanding in the name of the United Nations 
a 
retreat of Bosnian Serb military forces was very useful in 
Sarajevo. Why not continue it in the designated security zones?" 
he added.

  [Text] The decision to carry out air strikes against the 
Serbs should be taken in Brussels by the NATO command, which 
would need the UN green light. This afternoon the international 
community seems determined to make sure that this new ultimatum 
is respected, even if President Mitterrand thinks that it will 
be unnecessary to resort to air strikes. Francois Mitterrand 
was interviewed by Ralph Pinto in Tashkent, Uzbekistan: 
  [Begin Mitterrand recording] I believe that the UN forces 
are 
thinking that the ultimatum is going to be respected by the 
deadline. I have nothing else to add. My wish, naturally, is 
for military intervention to be avoided if it is not deemed 
necessary -- that is, if Serb forces and their positions conform 
to the conditions set by the international community. You will 
then be informed and so will I. 
  I hope that all this will be settled in a peaceful way, and 
that is why France took the initiative to call for the holding 
of an international conference -- and it is a good thing that it 
has been taken up by others. Unlike what happened in the past, 
this conference will be held parallel to the ultimatum and 
attended by at least the United States, Russia, and the EU 
[European Union] under the aegis of the United Nations. [end 
recording]

<F P=106> [Interview with French Foreign Minister Alain Juppe by Peter </F>
Snow in London on 25 April from the "Newsnight" program -- 
recorded] 
  [Text] [Snow] I asked the French Foreign Minister Alain 
Juppe how he would persuade a skeptical world audience that any 
new peace plan for Bosnia would actually be enforced. 
  [Juppe] We have enforced our principles in Sarajevo, and we 
are enforcing them in Gorazde, because the goal which we had 
when we approved the resolution of the Security Council and the 
decision of the Atlantic Alliance has been reached now in 
Gorazde. 
  [Snow] The problem is, isn't it, that the Serbs, although 
they may have stopped shelling Gorazde now and are pulling their 
heavy weapons out, they're still there, their infantry isn't 
pulling back. Doesn't mean that Gorazde is effectively 
neutralized? 
  [Juppe] I don't think so. Sarajevo is not neutralized, life 
is coming again in Sarajevo. And we have the same target in 
Gorazde and it's only a first step of course, because the 
solution will be diplomatic and political and not military. We 
must have a cease-fire, then a cessation of hostilities, then a 
withdrawal of troops, and then a political settlement. And the 
withdrawal, the final withdrawal of Serb troops, will take place 
only when we have a political and global settlement in Bosnia, 
of course. 
  [Snow] Are you confident, Foreign Minister, that you can get 
the Serbs not just to stop where they are, not just to cease 
fire, but to withdraw from where they are? 
  [Juppe] The Serbs have accepted the percentage of the 
territory of Bosnia of about 50 percent, so they must withdraw 
by about 20 percent, according to their presence at the moment 
on the ground. So that's the target.

Bosnia-Herzegovina under the United Nations be placed under 
NATO's command. 
  The NATO Military Committee meetings, where the developments 
in Bosnia-Herzegovina were mainly discussed, have ended in 
Brussels. Gen. Dogan Gures, who attended the meetings, held a 
news conference in Brussels this morning. He pointed out that 
NATO is troubled about Bosnia-Herzegovina, and that the debates 
at the Military Committee focused on the respectability and 
prestige of the alliance. 
  ANATOLIA reports that at his news conference, Gen. Gures 
pointed out that NATO is decisive about Bosnia-Herzegovina but 
that the political decision must be made by the United Nations. 
He also said that to establish peace in Bosnia-Herzegovina, the 
air force and navy are not enough, and that the ground forces in 
that country must be placed under NATO's command even if they 
remain under UN control. [passage omitted] 
  Gen. Gures then left Brussels for Paris as the guest of his

  [Text] Vienna, April 27 (AFP) -- North Korea Wednesday [27 
April] responded to conditions posed by the International Atomic 
Energy Agency (IAEA) for inspection of one of its nuclear 
plants, but diplomatic sources close to the Agency said the 
response was not fully satisfactory. 
  The IAEA had set a series of conditions to the sending of 
inspectors to monitor the replacement of spent nuclear fuel rods 
at a five megawatt reactor at Yongbyon, a plant which the United 
States suspects of being used to produce nuclear weapons. 
  The North Korean "response is currently being examined by 
the 
IAEA services and we are in consultation with Agency member 
states," IAEA spokesman David Kyd said. 
  A diplomatic source close to the Agency said however that 
"the North Korean response might not be entirely satisfactory 
and it is practically ruled out that inspectors [will] leave 
(for Korea) before the end of the week." 
  Differences reportedly centred on how the spent fuel rods 
should be controlled, the source said. 
  "It is essential for the IAEA, that our inspectors be 
allowed 
to take samples of some of the spent fuel to prove that the 
North Koreans have not diverted any nuclear material for 
military ends. We want to be present during the whole period of 
the unloading of the reactor and we demand that all the spent 
fuel from the reactor be placed under the Agency's control," Kyd 
said. 
  The North Koreans have said they want to start unloading the 
reactor at the beginning of May and have consequently asked that 
the IAEA send inspectors as soon as possible. The whole 
operation should last about two months, Kyd said.

<F P=106> [Ingrid Hedstrom report: "EU Committee Said Yes to Sweden"] </F>
  [Text] Brussels -- The Foreign Affairs Committee of the 
European Parliament yesterday voted to urge the European 
Parliament to say yes to Swedish membership of the EU from 1 
January 1995. The Committee also adopted resolutions covering 
Norway, Finland, and Austria. 
  But the debate which preceded the decision was irritated and 
confused and hardly provided any guarantees about how things 
will go in the decisive parliamentary vote next week. 
  The Committee adopted its resolution on Sweden's membership 
application with a vote of 15. Seven members voted against the 
resolution and two members abstained. 
  A passage to the effect that the Foreign Affairs Committee 
is 
only voting for Sweden to be admitted to the EU at New Year 1995 
"out of a general sense of political responsibility" was thrown 
in at the last moment. Sweden receives a yes from the Committee 
"despite the much discussed shortcomings in the EU's 
institutional development and the procedural shortcomings 
relating to informing the European Parliament about the 
membership agreements," the resolution states. 
  And in the debate several members expressed their bitterness 
that the Parliament has not been given any binding promises 
about reform of EU bodies. Many EU members of Parliament have 
demanded a stronger position for the Parliament and/or a 
strengthening of the EU's supranational role as a condition for 
voting yes to the enlargement of the EU -- an issue on which the 
Parliament now has a right of veto -- but have had little 
response to their demand. 
  "People have completely ignored the conditions the 
Parliament 
laid down," former French Foreign Minister Claude Cheysson 
complained. 
  Many members were also dissatisfied with the procedure for 
the important vote, which will be held on 4 May, according to a 
preliminary agenda. The European Parliament will only be able 
to vote yes or no to approving the agreements with Sweden, 
Norway, Finland, and Austria. Only the following day will there 
be a debate and votes on Parliament's own resolutions which in 
principle will then be meaningless. 
  The notion that the resolutions, which are adopted the day 
after the main vote, can be seen as "explanations of voting 
behavior" from the Parliament was an idea that received an 
unfavorable reception from many Committee members. 
  And the uncertainty about what will happen in the Parliament 
remains to the very end. Despite the fact that the vote on the 
EFTA [European Free Trade Association] countries' membership 
agreements is now on the agenda there remain three opportunities 
to remove it during next week's parliamentary session.

  [Text] Luxembourg, April 26 (AFP) -- Budgetary constraints 
imposed by the European Commission on setting European Union 
[EU] farm prices for the 1994-95 crop year have paralyzed 
ministers' negotiations on those prices in Luxembourg, 
delegation sources said on Tuesday [26 April]. 
  They said the chances of reaching agreement this week on EU 
farm prices for the new farm year looked very slim, and the 
majority of delegations consider measures suggested by 
Agriculture Commissioner Rene Steichen as insufficient or even 
unacceptable. 
  Greece, the current EU president, wants quick agreement and 
was carrying out intensive consultations with the member 
delegations. But a suggested compromise worked out Monday night 
by Steichen and Greek Agriculture Minister Giorgos Moraitis got 
an unenthusiastic reception on Tuesday from some delegations. 
  Discussions were made particularly difficult by numerous 
specific demands made by each EU delegation taking part in the 
price negotiations.

yesterday over German attempts to ban British beef because of 
fears of "mad cow" disease. 
  Herr Jochen Borchert, German Agriculture Minister, told 
journalists at an EC meeting in Luxembourg that he was now 
seeking "a European solution." This appears to be a significant 
climb-down, as Herr Horst Seehofer, the German Health Minister, 
said last month that Germany would take unilateral action 
against British beef imports. 
  The German position has found no sympathy in Brussels, where 
Agriculture and Health Ministers have pronounced themselves 
content with measures taken by Britain to ensure that meat from 
infected cows does not enter the human food chain. The European 
Commission has also warned Germany that unilateral restrictions 
would be illegal. 
  The battle is not yet over. Herr Borchert will be pushing 
the Commission to institute more screening procedures for beef, 
but it appears that the threat of unilateral action has been 
withdrawn. 
  However, Mrs Gillian Shephard, Britain's Agriculture 
Minister, said: "It is clearly a retreat by the Germans. I am 
not prepared to tolerate any question of a unilateral ban on a 
British product." 
  She has accused Germany of scare-mongering by voicing fears 
about British beef. These, she contended, were having a 
devastating effect on an export business worth some 8 million 
pounds a year, and were affecting other British products such as 
lamb. 
  To encourage Germany to back down, the Commission has 
announced measures that include a study of procedures for the 
processing of meat-and-bone meal, considered the primary cause 
of infection. Britain has already banned the feeding of cows on 
meal from other ruminants, after recognition that meal from 
diseased sheep was the most likely cause of cow infection.

<F P=106> [Unattributed article: "Martens Ready To Assume </F>
Responsibilities"] 
  [Text] If the EPP [European People's Party], the Belgian 
Government, and the other European Governments find Wilfried 
Martens the best man to head the European Commission (EC), he 
will be prepared to assume his responsibilities, Wilfried 
Martens told GAZET VAN ANTWERPEN. 
  Wilfried Martens: "The matter must be seen in a wider 
context. There are no official candidates for the EC presidency. 
With Jacques Delors, the European Socialists have headed the 
Commission for 10 years. It is only normal for a Christian 
Democrat to have a turn. It is also clear that someone from a 
small country, such as one of the Benelux countries, has the 
best chance." 
  An additional point in Wilfried Martens favor is the desire 
repeatedly expressed by the European Council of government 
leaders for the new president of the EC Commission to be a past 
or present head of government. 
  It is thus only logical for names such as Ruud Lubbers and 
Wilfried Martens to come up. "But Jean-Luc Dehaene," Martens 
says, "would be a good president. Agreement must also be 
reached concerning other important posts, including the 
presidency of the European Parliament." 
  Immediately following the European elections in May, the 
presidents of the European Christian Democrat parties and 
Christian Democrat government leaders will meet to discuss the 
situation. "But a lot will obviously depend," Martens says "on 
the attitude of the other governments." 
  As EPP president, Martens says he is "relaxed" about the 
situation. As president, he must also adopt a neutral stance. 
"I am therefore restrained in my comments. But everyone knows 
my convictions and knows what I stand for." The question as to 
whether or not he is a candidate for the presidency of the EC 
Commission is therefore only indirectly answered. 
  "If the EPP, the Belgian Government, and the other 
government 
leaders consider that I am the most suitable man, then I will 
not evade my responsibilities."

<F P=106> [Unattributed report: "No Tax Increases"] </F>
  [Excerpt] On Tuesday [26 April] Chancellor Franz Vranitzky 
stated that, not least because of the transition measures 
envisaged in the agreement between the Social Democratic Party 
of Austria and the Austrian People's Party, raising taxes will 
not be necessary in the eventuality of accession to the European 
Union [EU]. 
  The planned financial means serve to support economic 
development and thus revitalize consumption. This automatically 
leads to higher tax revenues. Vranitzky also expects a positive 
effect on purchasing from planned stricter price controls to 
make sure that price reductions resulting from EU membership are 
indeed passed on to the consumer. 
  The government has passed on to parliament the necessary 
documents to discuss accession to the EU in time so that both 
the government and the opposition have a "sufficient cushion of 
time" to discuss the matter. Thus, in his view, there is 
nothing that speaks against holding the referendum on 12 June, 
Vranitzky stressed. Austria has decided to hold the referendum 
before summer because his understanding of democracy indicates 
that the people's positive decision should be made by the time 
the EU Treaty, with the four new members, is signed at the end 
of June. No one should get the impression that the government 
is signing such an important treaty over the heads of the 
people, Vranitzky said. 
  In deciding the amounts set down in the agreement to finance 
the balanced package for professional and social groups, the 
government relied on the official figures provided by the 
Economics Research Institute [WIFO]. Asked about the statements 
by WIFO expert Fritz Breuss to the parliamentary EU committee, 
Vranitkzy said that there is a "wide range of expert opinion"; 
he can, however only rely on official figures. Vranitzky thinks 
that the figures used in the agreement are appropriate, but he 
admits that it has been clear from the very start that during 
the first two or three years after accession to the EU there 
will be a difficult budget situation because of the economic 
stimuli, which, however, will also ease because of the better 
economic prospects in the EU. 
  In Vranitzky's view, in addition to agriculture and 
manufacturing industry, the most important items of the 
agreement are improvements in labor law and health, the 
introduction of the European shop council, the reactivation of 
Article 39a of the Labor Market Promotion Law, and the promise 
to support the Austrian steel industry with money from the 
budget if analogous measures are introduced in the EU. 
  Freedom Party of Austria [FPOe] Chairman Joerg Haider sees 
his negative attitude toward the EU confirmed by the information 
provided by WIFO expert Fritz Breuss. In Breuss' view, the 
budget deficit threatens to rise to 135 billion schillings and 
tax increases cannot be avoided. In the view of Greens Deputy 
Johannes Voggenhuber, WIFO expert Breuss is telling the truth 
about the consequences of EU membership for the budget. The 
government is covering up this matter and exerting pressure on 
the WIFO, Voggenhuber said. 
  WIFO chief Helmut Kramer distanced himself from Breuss' 
statements at the parliamentary EU hearing. "We did not arrive 
at these figures," Kramer said. This is the "private opinion of 
the expert." 
  The Ministry of Agriculture also rejected Breuss' statement 
and stressed that the claim that 100 billion schillings are to 
be paid to Austrian agriculture over the next four years for 
adjustments to the EU is completely unfounded. In addition, the 
theory that solidarity leads to budget problems is untenable, 
nor can one speak of excessive compensation for losses in 
agricultural income. 
  FPOe politicians Walter Meischberger and Holger Bauer called 
the chancellor's statements an "incredible faux pas" and said 
that the head of government is ridiculing WIFO experts. 
  Finance Minister Ferdinand Lacina and State Secretary 
Johannes Ditz also made it clear that Austria's accession to the 
EU will not entail higher taxes.

<F P=106> [Unattributed report: "Resolution by OeVP Executive </F>
Committee: `In Favor of EU Entry'"] 
  [Text] On Wednesday [27 April], the Federal Executive 
Committee of the Austrian People's Party [OeVP] passed a 
resolution on the European Union [EU]. In its declaration, the 
OeVP "invites all people, irrespective of party affiliation, to 
support this future course for Austria." 
  Under the leadership of Foreign Minister Alois Mock an 
"excellent result" was achieved in the negotiations, "which has 
made possible our support for EU entry." The OeVP describes 
itself as a "guarantor that there will be no tax increases in 
connection with EU accession." 
  For the OeVP, the EU referendum is the "most important 
national issue of the outgoing 20th century. This is why we 
will do everything we can to keep the referendum on EU accession 
out of the debate on daily and party politics. We are 
particularly anxious to see -- if possible -- all citizens 
participate in this vote, regardless of their convictions." 
  In the statement, the OeVP also describes itself as the 
"driving force and guarantor" for accompanying national measures 
in preparation for EU membership. Thus, it has been ensured that 
accession will not take place to the discomfort or the 
disadvantage of a weaker social group. In terms of the national 
economy, EU membership will have positive effects for Austrian 
employees, for industry, and for farmers. 
  It is the OeVP's goal to secure the achievements of farmers 
on a permanent basis and to make it possible for farmers to 
prosper. The national accompanying measures guarantee that 
Austrian farmers will get adequate financial compensation and 
will thus be able to cope with the EU entry. The necessary 
structural reforms in the farming sector can thus be 
accomplished. 
  A set of measures has been devised for the protection of 
Austria as an economic and industrial center. To ease the 
transit traffic burden, additional railroad capacity on the 
Austrian part of the Munich-Verona route has been promised. 
This will make it necessary to build a new underground railroad 
track through the lower Inn Valley. This track can make a 
decisive contribution to relieving the population along the 
Tirolean transit routes of some of the burden. 
  Regarding employees, the OeVP Federal Executive Committee 
points to a new employment protection law. It contains 
improvements in the spheres of occupational health and safety 
equipment. Austrian accesion to the EU will also stimulate the 
labor market. The Wifo Economic Research Institute has 
predicted an increase of 55,000 jobs between 1995 and 2000. 
Some 7.5 billion schillings would be provided from the European 
Union's social fund for fighting unemployment until the end of 
1999. 
  For the OeVP, EU membership is "our country's most important 
step in terms of security policy, comparable in its significance 
only to the conclusion of the State Treaty." As the 
eastern-most part of stable Europe, Austria lies in immediate 
proximity to the conflict zones in the Balkans and the CIS 
republics. It is for this reason alone that Austria must try to 
seek security in an alliance. It is important to have partners 
"who stand firmly behind us even when only the first signs of a 
crisis are showing."

<F P=106> [Unattributed report: "For a Social Europe"] </F>
  [Text] On Wednesday [27 April] the Federal Executive 
Committee of the Austrian Trade Union Federation (OeGB) decided 
to recommend to the working people, "while fully respecting 
other opinions," to vote affirmatively on Austria's accession to 
the European Union [EU] in the 12 June referendum. 
  "After concluding a long process of deliberation and after 
all the results of the negotiations have been presented, the 
OeGB is convinced that Austria's accession to the EU is to be 
assessed positively after weighing all prospects and risks," a 
resolution entitled "Austria as a Business Location -- Europe as 
a Business Location," which was adopted by the Federal Executive 
committee, says. 
  The OeGB sees "the participation in the referendum and the 
yes to the EU as a first step toward participating in the 
shaping of Europe's future and, at the same time, toward 
consolidating and expanding Austria as a business location. And 
it sees it as a chance for a peaceful, democratic, and social 
Europe, a Europe of the working people, which has the goal of 
work and prosperity for all." 
  "Austria's trade unions are committed to a democratic, 
peaceful, and social Europe. Our goal is work for all, 
coexistence in peace and democratic freedom. This is the basic 
premise of the answer to the question whether the Austrian 
people are to decide for or against accession to the EU," the 
OeGB states in its resolution. 
  The OeGB calls on the Austrian Government to play an active 
role in shaping the "social area of Europe." This involves 
jointly raising social standards, a common active employment 
policy, more intensive efforts in the field of basic and 
advanced training, and the active role of the EU in the fields 
of environmental and consumer policy, as well as solidarity with 
the weaker groups inside and outside the EU. 
  In its resolution the OeGB points to the economic advantages 
of EU membership, but, at the same time, stresses that a purely 
economic point of view is not enough. "Our goal must also be 
the establishment of a social Europe. Only if the concerns of 
the working people are taken into account and social framework 
conditions are developed accordingly, can the single market have 
a beneficial effect for all strata of the population." 
  Important concerns of the OeGB, such as safeguarding 
neutrality, preserving our social standards, or maintaining the 
ecological goals of the Transit Treaty, have been successfully 
pushed through in the membership negotiations. The government 
and the political parties now have the task of implementing 
accompanying measures so as to make sure that the problems 
arising from accession to the EU for the economic sectors and 
the regions as well as for the working people employed there can 
be overcome. 
  The OeGB expects the Austrian Government to tackle labor's 
problems quickly and effectively. For this purpose labor 
foundations and other active employment measures are to be 
implemented as a priority measure. The financial means 
necessary for this purpose must also be ensureds. Furthermore, 
the OeGB expects that social standards will not be reduced with 
the justification of increasing competitiveness. In addition, 
the OeGB calls for a more effective struggle against illegal 
employment. OeGB President Fritz Verzetnitsch sees the 
recommendation to vote "yes" in the EU referendum not as 
patronizing but as an aid for orientation.

  [Text] Vienna, 26 Apr (INA) -- A delegation of the Arab 
Socialist Ba'th Party led by 'Abd-al-Razzaq al-Hashimi, director 
of the Foreign Relations Bureau of the Iraq Command of the Ba'th 
Party, met in Vienna today with Mr. Henkel, the official in 
charge of the Middle East department at the Austrian Foreign 
Ministry. 
  During the meeting, the Iraqi delegation explained the 
latest 
developments in the Iraq-UN talks, pointing out that Iraq has 
fulfilled its international obligations and that this requires 
that the Security Council honor its commitments toward Iraq and 
lift the economic blockade. 
  Mr. Henkel expressed his understanding of Iraq's position, 
stressing the importance of relations between Iraq and Austria 
and the need to develop them in the interest of the common 
objectives of the two countries. 
  The Ba'th Party delegation also met with Alfred Kerstel of 
the Federal Council, the upper house of parliament. Discussions 
dealt with relations between Iraq and Austria and ways of 
developing them, as well as the recent developments at the 
Security Council and Iraq's implementation of its obligations. 
  In a press statement following the meeting, Mr. Kerstel said 
the two sides stressed the importance of working to create 
foundations for a just and lasting peace in the region, 
especially after Iraq's implementation of all UN resolutions. 
  Mr. Kerstel added that the situation in Iraq has become very 
difficult as a result of the continued economic blockade against 
it and the severe shortage of food and medicine, stressing the 
need to work to lift the blockade. 
  Mr. Kerstel suggested sending a delegation of Austrian youth 
and journalists to Baghdad to familiarize themselves with the 
situation in Iraq.

Iraqis"] 
  [Text] Salzburg -- This week an Iraqi economic delegation 
has been allowed to make propaganda in Austria for lifting the 
UN sanctions. It paid a midday "official" (provincial press 
service) visit to Salzburg. According to the Freedom Party of 
Austria [FPOe] group of the provincial parliament, the 
delegation had been invited by the "Group of Liberal 
Entrepreneurs" (RFW), whose federal chairman is Helmut 
Haigermoser, an FPOe deputy in the federal parliament. The 
Iraqis were received by Margot Hofer, the future third diet 
president of the FPOe. Hofer reported that the Iraqis had 
pointed to the "disastrous humanitarian situation" and the "high 
infant mortality." If this is true, the sanctions should be 
lifted, she said. 
  Last year a trip by FPOe politicians, including Haigermoser, 
to Iraq, which is being boycotted by the international 
community, sparked harsh criticism. The FPOe delegation visited 
Baghdad at the invitation of Husayn's regime.

<F P=106> [Interview with Joerg Haider, chairman of the Freedom Party </F>
of Austria [FPOe], by Werner Schima; place and date not given: 
"I Can Live With Isolation"] 
  [Excerpt] [Schima] Before the controversy in the province 
of Carinthia [about which of the coalition parties would provide 
the provincial governor] -- you acted as one of the major 
parties -- you said you would not recommend how to vote in the 
referendum on the European Union [EU]. Since the problems in 
Carinthia you have been acting like a spurned lover with a chip 
on your shoulder and are initiating an anti-EU campaign. 
  [Haider] I do not have a chip on my shoulder. Our strategy 
has not changed. The term anti-EU campaign was used by the 
media. We just want to provide information. 
  [Schima] About the disadvantages of membership. And then you 
tell the people that you do not care how they vote? 
  [Haider] Of course, we care. I am just convinced that my 
arguments are the better ones and that no recommendation is 
necessary. 
  [Schima] Will you disrupt the holding of the referendum on 
12 
June with tricks in the Nationalrat's standing orders or 
filibustering in Parliament? 
  [Haider] We wanted a date in autumn -- but postponing the 
referendum by a week is pointless. Therefore, we accept 12 June 
now. 
  [Schima] Will you also accept the result of the referendum? 
By pointing to the possibilities of challenging the results 
because of defects in the text of the treaty you have left 
yourself a loophole. 
  [Haider] The FPOe will accept it. However, we cannot 
guarantee that the referendum will not be challenged by citizens 
who are critical of the EU. 
  [Schima] Your prediction for the referendum? 
  [Haider] A very narrow no. 
  [Schima] A NEWS poll has shown that 52 percent of Austrians 
think it is right to isolate you. Is it not frustrating in the 
long run having to haunt the scene as a pariah? 
  [Haider] I can live with isolation quite well. And it is not 
a shame to be isolated by Mr. Fuhrmann [parliamentary leader of 
the Social Democratic Party of Austria]. On the contrary: It 
is better to polarize than to leave everybody indifferent. It 
would be worse not interesting anyone. 
  [Schima] However, your dream of becoming chancellor in 1998 
seems to be over, which is also in the interest of Austrians. 
According to the polls, only 4 percent want you as chancellor, 
43 percent would prefer you to continue in opposition. 
  [Haider] The dream is more alive than ever. The FPOe will 
remain in opposition for another four years, and in 1998 it will 
overtake the Austrian People's Party. [passage omitted]

<F P=106> [Unattributed report: "The Upswing Came in the Fourth </F>
Quarter"] 
  [Text] According to preliminary results of the national 
accounting done by the Economic Research Institute (WIFO), the 
Austrian GDP amounted to 2,109.7 billion shillings in current 
1993 prices. This was nominally 3.6 percent more than last 
year, but 0.3 percent less after adjusting for inflation. 
  The increase in overall labor productivity (real GDP per 
working person) was again 0.2 percent lower than the year 
before. In the course of the year the economy picked up 
steadily, as we have already reported, and grew by 0.8 percent 
during the fourth quarter. The fact that the recession was at 
least partly alleviated in Austria is shown by the growth of 
private and public consumption (plus 0.8 percent and 2 percent 
respectively in real terms). In foreign trade with goods the 
national economy lost 3.3 percent in real terms in exports and 
3.5 percent in imports. Including services as well as 
"invisible goods," the exports undercut the level of 1992 by 1.7 
percent in real terms; imports, on the other hand, rose by 0.2 
percent. 
  Prices for the available volume of goods and services rose 
by 
3.2 percent in 1993, which was again less than those for the GDP 
at 3.9 percent. Given slightly declining import prices and 
slightly rising export prices, the terms of trade for domestic 
foreign trade once again improved compared with 1992. 
<H5>  Construction Sector Experiences Revival </H5>
  The Association of Austrian Industrial Construction 
Enterprises (VIBOe) sees feeble signs of a recovery. While in 
1993 they registered only a nominal increase in turnover of 1.7 
percent to 123.875 billion, 1994 started out well. In January 
turnover amounted to 5.198 billion schillings, thus being 10.8 
percent higher than in January 1993. Of that 2.91 billion 
schillings went to crafts and 2.288 billion to industry. 
  The "traditional" winter unemployment in the construction 
sector continued to decline. At the end of January 1994 75,686 
persons were employed, which is 2.4 percent more than during the 
same month last year.

Arms Exports"] 
  [Text] The international community must set stricter rules 
for the trade in light weapons. That way conflicts in 
developing countries in particular could be managed and 
prevented. 
  Cooperation Development Minister Pronk made his comments 
yesterday in a speech at Groningen University. He referred to 
the importance of much tighter policies on arms exports. Pronk 
said that the proliferation of light weapons like mortars, 
grenades, land mines and machine guns caused more instability 
than the proliferation of heavy weapons. That had been proved 
in practice. Out of the 30 large armed conflicts which took 
place in the world in 1993, 26 were fought virtually entirely 
with small and light weapons. 
  Pronk said that the countries of the former Soviet Union and 
the Central and East European states in particular should 
increase their monitoring of light arm exports.

<F P=106> [Unattributed article: "VVD Ready To Work With D66 and CDA"] </F>
  [Text] Last night in Amsterdam, VVD [People's Party for 
Freedom and Democracy] leader Bolkstein expressed a strong 
preference for a new coalition government between the VVD, D66 
[Democrats 66] and CDA [Christian Democratic Appeal]. He also 
announced that the VVD would not enter into a coalition with the 
CDA and PvdA [Labor Party]. 
  The chances of seeing a "purple coalition" between the D66, 
PvdA and VVD, as advocated so strongly by D66 leader Hans Van 
Mierlo, seem very slight following these statements, as PvdA 
leader Wim Kok yesterday expressed his preference for a 
coalition between the PvdA, D66 and CDA. 
  According to Bolkstein, only one of the present coalition 
members CDA and PvdA can be included in the new government. 
"One of the coalition parties belongs on the opposition 
benches. This government has seen to that." 
  He is least enthusiastic about seeing the PvdA return to 
government as he sees the party as strongly divided in the light 
of contrasting statements by prominent PvdA members. This is 
why the liberal leader prefers a government formed by the 
expected election winners, the VVD and D66, supplemented by the 
CDA. Speaking to EO radio, Kok stated that a coalition between 
the PvdA and VVD was less obviously evident than a pact between 
the PvdA and CDA. Kok probably does not rule out in advance any 
possibility of cooperation with the VVD, but he does not want to 
create the impression of exuding an "anti-CDA" sentiment. CDA 
leader Brinkman reacted with great satisfaction to this: 
"Fortunately, PvdA members are repenting." 
  Kok admitted that he had agreed with Bolkstein last summer 
that the parties would not mutually exclude one another from a 
coalition. But yesterday he stated that cooperation with the VVD 
was now less evident due to the election programs. Major 
obstacles not only include the minimum system of social security 
proposed by the VVD, but also authorization for migrants. Kok 
believes that speculation regarding a "purple coalition" of the 
Pvda, VVD and D66 is excessively dictated by an "anti-CDA 
sentiment." 
  D66 will not join a future government unless there are new 
initiatives for social and political reform, D66 leader Van 
Mierlo said yesterday in Utrecht. "I do not see us as part of a 
government which does not make a start with the referendum. The 
D66 is never going to simply shuffle along. We will not be a 
part of that. W will press for a new approach." 
  Van Mierlo stated that D66 has become an essential component 
of any new government. He also no longer wants to remain a 
bystander.

<F P=106> [Report on a debate between Labor Party leader Wim Kok and </F>
Democrats 66 leader Hans van Mierlo by Arnold Koper and Co 
Welgraven; place and date not given: "You Have No Partner and 
Neither Do I"] 
  [Excerpts] [passage omitted] The subject is the purple 
coalition and the mini-system for social security advocated by 
the VVD [People's Party for Freedom and Democracy] that such a 
government is preventing. Or is it? Kok reproaches Van Mierlo 
for having made concessions to the VVD too early on. It is no 
secret that the D66 [Democrats 66] will go far to ensure that a 
coalition is formed without the CDA [Christian Democratic 
Appeal]. 
  [Van Mierlo] Wim, never again may you say that I am starting 
to embrace the minisystem. It is simply not true! We are 
virtually the first people in the country to have rejected the 
minisystem. 
  [Kok] There is an ugly discrepancy between what you say one 
day and what you say the next. First I hear you say to the VVD 
that you want a purple coalition, but that there can be no 
minisystem. That is hard talk, words after my own heart. Then, 
two days later I hear you say to Bolkestein: "Naturally we 
fulfill a bridging function; it is a matter for discussion." In 
actual fact what you are saying is that there can be no 
minisystem, but that you will have to talk about it. That is 
making too major a concession to Bolkestein on a subject that is 
very close to my heart. 
  [Van Mierlo] How can you listen to someone so maliciously? 
Our election platform clearly states that we reject the 
minisystem. That is it. Then I said to the VVD: "You are the 
only ones who want such a system." To the PvdA [Labor Party] I 
said: "You are the only people in the country who are telling 
me that nothing has to be changed in the social security sector. 
My conclusion is that you will both have to shift your opinion, 
and I expect that you will end up somewhere in the neighborhood 
of our ideas. And naturally I intend to make concessions. In 
this country you cannot make coalitions without making 
concessions." [passage omitted] 
  [Kok] This is an historic moment in Netherlands relations. 
The CDA's position of power is being considerably limited. 
Also by the fact that the major parties are no longer excluding 
each other. The CDA can therefore no longer divide and rule and 
manipulate things so that it remains at the center of power 
after all. We are all going into these elections without 
partners. Hans, you have no partner nor do I. We have shaken 
off our chains. 
  [Van Mierlo] And arms. How long ago was it that you said 
that the government must be the stake of this election? 
  [Kok] I am still the only person to defend this government 
policy. Our partner has turned his back on us. The CDA is so 
confused and embarrassed that it is common knowledge that the 
party needs to create a kind of image of the enemy just outside 
the door for the sake of restoring harmony within itself. 
  I am going openly into the elections, with an open mind 
regarding the coalition possibilities thereafter. Personally, 
the preference for a purple coalition does not rank in first 
place. For me, the most important question is this: How can we 
secure the best platform outcome for a government in which the 
PvdA and D66 can lay a firm, progressive foundation? I am quite 
clear about its contents, less clear about the color. Hans is 
quite clear about the color, and less clear about the contents. 
  [Van Mierlo] Mind what you say. The content is plain to see 
in our election platform. I remember when we were reproached 
for never making any choices in advance. Now we are the only 
ones to do so. And with good reason. I believe that there 
really is a need for change in this country. Nothing is working 
any more. No. You have been busy for four years and not one 
single major operation has taken off. Do you know what has 
taken off? The mobile air brigade. Provided that you at least 
throw Ter Beek the pennies he needs to set it up. 
  Our first option is a purple coalition. That is what we are 
betting on. And I shall not say what our second option is. My 
lips are sealed. Because then you would know exactly what and 
whom you have to sabotage. I am not going to play right into 
your hands. 
  [Kok] Are you thinking of a government including the CDA, 
VVD, and D66? 
  [Van Mierlo] I am not thinking of that in particular at the 
moment. 
  [Kok] But you are not ruling it out either? 
  [Van Mierlo] I have not ruled out any government 
configuration whatsoever. 
  [Kok] Interesting. 
  [Van Mierlo] Come now! Do stop that nonsense! I have been 
saying that for a full year! 
  [Kok] Extremely interesting. For it is well-known that you 
are entertaining the possibility of proceeding to form a 
government with two right-wing parties. 
  [Van Mierlo] I want that particular purple coalition, and I 
am fighting to obtain it. So I am not going to answer your 
question, because that would mean me losing my opportunity for 
such a coalition. 
  [Kok] And yet you did give your answer, because you did not 
rule it out. [end Kok] 
  Whichever coalition comes about, it will have to place 
employment at the top of the agenda, definitely now that 
unemployment is rising at such an alarming rate. Is full 
employment still a feasible objective? PvdA leaders like Van 
Dam and Kalma, two of the authors of the election platform, have 
their doubts. Neither Kok nor Van Mierlo wants to lay claim to 
that analysis. [passage omitted] 
  [Kok] Will it be possible to achieve full employment in the 
medium term? The answer is "no." That is clear, but do not 
forget that despite the very high unemployment figures we are 
seeing an annual flow of some 400,000 unemployed people. So 
there are still prospects for many of them. The real problem 
lies in long-term unemployment. That is why two weeks ago I 
launched a new social norm for the upcoming government term: 
Long-term unemployment must be brought back down to two percent. 
  [Van Mierlo] I do not think that anyone can predict what 
effect technological processes have in terms of unemployment in 
West Europe. Moreover, no one knows whether we will succeed in 
reforming the Netherlands economy. Nevertheless, I do not think 
that you must assume that full employment is no longer possible. 
Even if there were talk of jobless growth (economic growth 
without growth in jobs), it is still important for social and 
psychological reasons to strive for full employment, because the 
effort you deploy to combat unemployment will be all the greater 
if you assume that full employment is still possible. 
  [Kok] The idea of economic growth without growth in jobs 
only 
applies for part of the economy. In major industry, and in the 
banking and insurance sectors, the developments are indeed such 
that in the medium term we will not see much growth in 
employment. In addition, the possibilities of what was 
previously called redistribution of work often remain 
underexposed. That is a bit of an old-fashioned concept, too 
much of a "macro term," but individual decisions to make work 
shorter hours and in a different manner have a place in the 
pattern for new generations on the labor market. Lastly, I think 
that we must create new opportunities for the large group of 
long-term unemployed people, who have no prospects at all. In a 
future government term a minister or state secretary should be 
able to make an innovative, unorthodox project of this -- 
reforging benefit payments to help the long-term unemployed find 
a job. 
  D66 also wants to create "cheap" work, but Van Mierlo is 
afraid that the PvdA will place the burden of creating it on 
those in the middle income bracket. On balance, that could be 
counterproductive. 
  [Van Mierlo] If you want to improve the structure of the 
economy -- telematics, environmental technology, biotechnology 
-- then you must not levy unnecessarily heavy taxes on the work 
that must be carried out to do this. According to the PvdA 
platform, of each extra guilder earned by the middle income 
groups (43 to 90 thousand guilders), 66 cents will go to the 
collective tax burden, whereas with us the figure is 55 cents. 
In the long term, that will create better conditions for growth 
in employment in those sectors where the people on the underside 
[of society] can also benefit by being pushed through. [end Van 
Mierlo] 
  Nevertheless, the fight against unemployment will not become 
a breaking point between the PvdA and D66. Things are more 
difficult with social security. Is not the PvdA making the same 
mistake as at the last elections. Is it not once again making 
promises it cannot keep? 
  Van Mierlo points ironically to the WAO (Occupational 
Disability Insurance Act) debacle. "I will never accuse you of 
social betrayal. However, the way in which you attacked 
occupational disability has ruined the whole climate." 
  Wim Kok admitted that mistakes have been made regarding 
presentation, but he said that he still stands behind the 
content of the new WAO. "Indeed, the results are beginning to 
show. I have trouble understanding how someone who now says 
that things cannot go on like this with social security can at 
the same time think that in 1991 and 1992 we just let the WAO 
take its course. On one occasion we should have started 
earlier, while on the other we should just wait." 
  The question was whether the PvdA had not once again 
promised 
too much. Are the voters to be surprised once again with 
unannounced interventions in social security? 
  Kok responded with irritation: "If the use of a social law 
increases to the extent that we saw in the early 1990's with the 
WAO, then that creates new circumstances. If the call for help 
grows because the application of a law can no longer be 
controlled, then that can force adjustments. If the economy 
stagnates, as it has done over the past two years, then that has 
drastic consequences for everything. And if new circumstances 
arise following the appearance of a electoral platform, then it 
is a question of logic and purity for the leadership to talk 
about the consequences of this with the people." 
  [Van Mierlo] What you are now saying is not in your 
platform. 
It suggests that enough has been done, and that further 
intervention would not be necessary. In your last platform you 
came up with the link. 
  [Kok] Hans, you must not caricature this. That so-called 
link was never an objective, merely a means to an end. An 
instrument -- and here we have a difference of opinion -- for 
ensuring that the people on the underside of society are looked 
after somewhat more than people with higher incomes. 
  [Van Mierlo] Yet nothing has come of this over the past four 
years. Benefits have fallen in terms of buying power. I do not 
want to blame this on you. All I am saying is that your 
platform is not a reliable policy indicator for the next four 
years. 
  [Kok] We are simply not living in a command economy. In some 
companies, where things are going somewhat better, people are 
receiving pay raises that are higher than we would have actually 
wanted. The market that we are so fervently wishing upon other 
countries has an influence of its own on the development of 
wages. 
  [Van Mierlo] So that means that you can allow yourselves the 
illusion of an electoral platform as long as the practical 
aspects do not get in the way. 
  [Kok] That is true for all parties, including yours. 
  [Van Mierlo] With the difference that we make less promises.

<F P=106> [Unattributed article: "PvdA Continues To Rise in Opinion </F>
Polls"] 
  [Text] The PvdA [Labor Party] is continuing its advance in 
the opinion polls. The CDA [Christian Democratic Alliance] is 
crawling up laboriously, but remains far behind its fellow 
coalition member. The Christian Democrats' support, converted 
into seats, would put them at the same level as the VVD 
[People's Party for Freedom And Democracy]. D66 [Democrats 66] 
and Green Left are giving ground. 
  This was shown in a NIPO [Netherlands Institute for Public 
Opinion and Market Analysis] opinion poll released on Monday [25 
April] afternoon. If elections were held now, then the PvdA 
would get 35 seats (22.4 percent). Last week's NIPO poll gave 
the party led by Kok 33 seats. 
  The CDA has managed to reverse the decline of recent weeks 
into a cautious recovery. The NIPO poll confirms the upward 
turn indicated by the Interview pollsters, although the CDA's 
gain remains modest. Compared with a week ago the Christian 
Democrats managed to win one seat and climb to 29 seats. This 
takes them to the same number of seats as the VVD. In 
percentage terms the CDA (with 18.6 percent) is still slightly 
behind the liberals (with 18.8 percent). 
  D66 had to give further ground, according to the NIPO poll. 
The party could count on 25 seats compared with 26 a week ago, 
according to the latest poll. A few weeks ago D66 stood at 28 
seats in the opinion polls. 
  The strong loss in support of the CD [Center Democrats] is a 
striking feature of the NIPO poll. According to the figures 
published on Monday Janmaat's party would gain four seats. Last 
week the CD would have gained seven seats. 
  The senior citizens' parties are holding their support. The 
AOV [General Union of Senior Citizens] is stable at five seats 
while the +\55 Union will also gain one seat, according to the 
NIPO poll. 
  The leading candidates of the four main parties did not 
discuss the new opinion poll in detail. They concentrated more 
on the question of who will presently form a cabinet with whom. 
The PvdA leader pointed to the big differences in the programs 
of his party and the VVD. Therefore he did not want to form a 
purple coalition with this party and D66 simply with the goal of 
putting the CDA in the opposition. The CDA's leading candidate 
Brinkman indicated that he was happy that Kok was not further 
accentuating the differences. 
  VVD leader Bolkestein is continuing to insist that one of 
the 
two present coalition partners should go into opposition, since 
both the CDA and PvdA are facing heavy losses of respectively 25 
and 14 seats, according to opinion polls. 
  D66's leading candidate, Van Mierlo, continues to support a 
purple coalition. If that does not succeed, then his party is 
ready to cooperate with another coalition. As the most central 
party of the center, D66 appears to be in the comfortable 
position that it is indispensable for a three-party cabinet. 
  On Monday the NCW [Netherlands Christian Trade Union 
Federation] attacked the positions of the two leading PvdA 
candidates, Kok and Wallage. It rejected Kok's call for a 
long-term central agreement and Wallage's comments on redundancy 
rights.

<F P=106> [Unattributed report: "Robust Growth in Trade With China"] </F>
  [Text] Trade with the Chinese countries (China, Taiwan, and 
Hong Kong) boomed in 1993. Exports grew by 40 percent, even 
faster than imports, which rose by 36 percent. The trade 
deficit with the Chinese countries rose during the same period 
to about 3.5 billion guilders, around 850 million guilders more 
than in the same period the year before. This was apparent from 
trade figures for the Chinese countries covering the period 
January-October 1993. 
<H5>  Exports To China </H5>
  Exports to China passed the 1 billion guilder mark in 1993. 
All F-100's are now included in the figures for Netherlands 
exports to China. If the Netherlands export figures are 
corrected to compensate for this incidental item then the 
increase in exports would be "just" 50 percent. In that case, 
exports -- corrected for airplanes -- would not exceed 1 billion 
guilders in 1993. In addition, the growth in exports to China 
is supported by the semi-finished products sector. This sector 
multiplied its exports sixfold for a total of 145 million 
guilders. The main articles involved are iron and steel 
products (blast furnaces). It is also striking that exports of 
chemicals to China dropped slightly. 
  Exports to Taiwan and Hong Kong rose virtually across the 
board. 
  There are no real ups or downs. By far the Netherlands' most 
important export products to these countries are capital goods. 
<H5>  Imports of Machines </H5>
  The growth of imports from the Chinese countries was 
primarily found in the sector of machines and transportation 
equipment and other end products. The first category concerns 
chiefly consumer durables, such as consumer electronics and 
household white goods, as well as capital goods such as 
computers and computer parts, in which the growth in electron 
tubes and transistors is striking. This growth is supported 
primarily by imports from Taiwan. In the sector of other end 
products, the growth in imports of clothing, footwear, and toys 
is striking. This growth is supported by imports from China and 
Hong Kong. 
  The CBS [Central Office for Statistics] is assuming that 
annual figures for 1993 will be released before 1 May.

<F P=106> [By Sian Clare and Chris Moncrieff, PRESS ASSOCIATION News] </F>
  [Text] German Chancellor Helmut Kohl today pledged to join 
Britain in commemorating the 50th anniversary of the end of 
World War II next year. But he said he had never sought to 
attend the D-Day commemorations this year and would have 
declined any invitation to do so. Mr. Kohl was speaking at the 
end of a day-long summit with the Prime Minister at Chequers and 
in London. Other British ministers met their German 
counterparts at the same time. 
  Mr. Major told a news conference at the Foreign Office that 
"the Anglo-German relationship is in very good heart indeed." 
  Mr. Kohl agreed: "The relationship is an excellent one and 
has been for a long time. I don't think we should make any 
bones about that. But in every family there are obviously 
disagreements. As to the events that happened 50 years ago, 
quite frankly I really do not understand what people are talking 
about. At no point did I seek to get invited to the 
commemorations for D-Day. Had I been invited I would not have 
attended. This was very well known and it has not been an issue 
between us." 
  Chancellor Kohl spoke of his wish to join with Britain in 
commemorating the end of the war. He said it would be both 
countries' duty to "remember the dead and pay our respects to 
the victims." He said both nations felt obliged to see to it 
that no generation would ever be in such a situation again in 
Europe. 
  The Prime Minister said that during the talks the two 
leaders 
spent some time discussing the Bosnian situation. "There is no 
doubt that after the setback earlier this month, the UN has 
taken a step forward today with the withdrawal of Serb heavy 
weapons from the surrounds of Gorazde." 
  Mr. Major said this had been due to the "skilful and 
courageous work" of UN forces on the ground. "We are both 
determined to help NATO and the UN deter aggression against any 
of the safe areas. But the real prize is a negotiated 
settlement." 
  Turning to the South African elections, Mr. Major said: 
"Both 
Britain and Germany have worked for many years, very often very 
closely together, to help bring about change in South Africa. 
We both wish to do all we can to assist the incoming government 
after the elections are concluded. We hope to see business 
investing there develop and harness the economic potential we 
both believe exists in South Africa." 
  The Prime Minister said that both he and Mr. Kohl wished to 
bring the young people of Britain and Germany closer together 
and to improve mutual understanding of each other's country. 
"The Chancellor and I agreed we would ask our officials to come 
up with specific and imaginative proposals on this." 
  Mr. Major said both he and the Chancellor wished to see "a 
substantial reduction in the regulatory burden on business" 
because this would help economic growth and competitiveness. 
"You are going to hear a good deal more about deregulation in 
Europe," Mr. Major added.

  [Text] Mr. Gheorghe Tinca, Romanian minister of national 
defense, who is paying an official visit to Great Britain, 
signed today, together with his British counterpart Malcolm 
Rifkind, an memorandum of understanding and a program of 
contacts for 1994-1995. These were assessed by the Romanian 
minister as a cornerstone for the future cooperation between the 
two countries, thus establishing the legal framework for future 
bilateral actions and for other actions within the Partnership 
for Peace scheme. 
  Today's program of the Romanian minister of national defense 
included talks with British Defense Secretary Malcolm Rifkind 
and the minister of state for the armed forces and a roundtable 
on security problems in our region. The discussions emphasized 
a certain similarity in our approaches to European problems and 
the various areas of conflict, the Romanian minister of national 
defense said, adding that he also had a meeting with the 
representatives of renowned companies, such as Rolls Royce and 
British Aerospace, which are producing top technology both for 
national defense and civilian sectors.

  [Text] A Soviet-built plane will be spying over British 
military installations this week -- with the blessing of NATO. 
  Described as part of the Ukrainian Air Force, the Antonov 30 
will exercise its rights under the open skies treaty by carrying 
out surveillance sorties. 
  The treaty provides for various nations to fly over each 
others territory to gather intelligence using aerial 
photography, radar and video cameras. 
  It will be the first time an Antonov 30 from Ukraine is seen 
here as it flies over Lincolnshire to RAF Scampton on Thursday. 
  The Ukrainians will be hosted by a team from the Joint Arms 
Control Implementation Group, which is based at Scampton and has 
reciprocal arrangements for carrying out similar spying missions 
over former Iron Curtain countries.

<F P=106> [By Charles Miller, PRESS ASSOCIATION defense correspondent] </F>
  [Text] The armed forces are not a luxury and excessive cuts 
will damage Britain's security and reputation, Defence Secretary 
Malcolm Rifkind told the Treasury today. His warning came as 
ministers and senior officials prepared to draw up final 
recommendations for spending reductions in a bid to find 2.3 
billion pounds savings in line with Treasury demands. 
  Mr. Rifkind set out his stall in the annual defence white 
paper, which officials admitted was necessarily "bland" because 
the Front Line First review would not be completed until July. 
However, it revealed significant new cuts in the manpower 
strengths of the Royal Navy and RAF [Royal Air Force]. 
  By April 1, 1995, the Navy will fall by an extra 1,500 to 
51,000, while the RAF will lose a further 3,000 men and drop to 
70,000. However, the Front Line First review is expected to 
recommend that manpower plummets to around 45,000 in the Navy 
and around 60,000 in the RAF by the turn of the century. 
  The first meeting of ministers and the so-called executive 
group scheduled for Thursday was today postponed until next week. 
  Mr. Rifkind repeatedly emphasised that the "fighting 
capabilities" of the armed forces were sacrosanct. "We have no 
intention of making any further reductions in the fighting 
capabilities of our armed forces," he said. And, in a thinly 
veiled warning to the Treasury, the white paper said: "Our armed 
forces are widely regarded -- and rightly -- as a valuable and 
prestigious national asset. The possession of such an asset is 
not a luxury; and it is not something we could surrender without 
grave injury to the security and reputation of this country." 
  Strong armed forces were essential so long as Britain wanted 
to play an active part in international affairs. Although the 
end of the Cold War was welcomed, nationalism and extremism were 
"sadly" on the march. It would be many years before it became 
clear whether Russia -- with its huge arsenal of weapons -- 
would be able to develop into a permanent friend of the West and 
a stable democracy. 
  The white paper warned that Britain will face increasing 
challenges and that there could be even greater calls on the 
armed forces if hopes for greater stability fail to materialise. 
"We do not intend to take risks with our security," said the 
white paper. "The penalties for misjudgment would be too severe." 
  At a London briefing, Mr. Rifkind said it was the 
Government's intention that Britain should remain one of the 
world's most formidable military powers. 
  The review, details of which will be announced in late July, 
had gone better than predicted. The Defence Secretary said he 
was "pretty confident" of not only meeting the requirements but 
of having savings to "enhance the fighting capabilities of our 
armed forces." 
  Asked about proposals to slash around 20,000 civilian and 
military jobs, he stressed: "The crucial question is not overall 
manpower but how you use your manpower and whether they are 
being used in the most productive form." 
  But Labour immediately denounced the white paper as a 
charade 
and a whitewash. David Clark, shadow defence secretary, said: 
"It is a transparent attempt to try to get the Tories out of a 
short-term political problem at the expense of the long-term 
security of Britain. Defence Secretary Malcolm Rifkind does not 
want to jeopardise Tory chances in the local and European 
elections by revealing the full extent of his cuts." 
  Since December, 33 studies have been carried out into the 
entire support sector in a bid to find the necessary savings. 
These studies -- apart from two -- are now complete and will be 
discussed by the ministerial/executive group, which includes the 
financial director of Marks &amp; Spencer Christopher Littmoden 
and 
senior officials from the Treasury and the Downing Street policy 
unit. A final package of recommendations will be put together 
from the various studies and presented to Mr. Rifkind in the 
middle of next month. 
  Among the proposals are 20 percent cuts in senior officers 
and officials, a similar cut in the 11,000-strong Procurement 
Executive, the closure of hundreds of buildings including 
military colleges, and widespread privatisation of fleets of 
non-fighting aircraft and vehicles. 
  One of the most politically contentious issues is the naval 
base at Rosyth in Fife, which the Royal Navy has recommended for 
closure with warships moved to Portsmouth. 
  Mr. Rifkind insisted that if any recommendation could be 
shown to jeopardise the fighting capabilities of the armed 
forces, it would not be accepted.

<F P=106> [Roland Gribben article: "Britain Is Wasting Its Time in EC </F>
Says Young"] 
  [Text] Britain is wasting its time as a member of the EC, 
Lord Young said in his presidential address to the Institute of 
Directors' annual convention yesterday. 
  He made a stinging attack on the Community and urged 
business 
leaders to look to the faster growing economies in the Far East 
where they faced less restrictions. 
  Lord Young, who chided the Institute for its criticism of 
the 
EC when he was Trade and Industry Secretary in Lady Thatcher's 
second administration, asked his audience of 2,800 businessmen: 
"What are we doing in the European Union?" 
  He added: "Largely, I suggest, wasting our time in inward 
looking arguments about lost causes, causes like single 
currencies and various forms of political union. Fiddling while 
the Treaty of Rome burns." 
  Lord Young was pessimistic about the next inter-governmental 
conference on the EC producing a "bonfire of directives" or 
taking "an axe to the institutions of the Union." 
  It was more likely to give more power to bureaucrats in 
Brussels, reduce democracy by extending qualified majority 
voting and end up ensuring that the "good Brussels principle of 
equal misery, otherwise known as harmonisation should be spread 
across the entire Union." 
  He added: "We should be examining the work of the Commission 
and the European parliament. This is probably our last chance 
to wake up before the world passes us by." 
  The number of unemployed in Europe now represented the 
"sixth 
largest state in the union." 
  Lord Young said: "As their number rises, so rises all the 
social tensions that we have seen in Germany and France the very 
self-same tensions, fattened on a diet of unemployment that 
Hitler and his like exploited so well some 60 years ago." 
  "As a result the greatest growth industry in Europe are the 
parties of the extreme, whether of the Left or the Right." 
  He said the futile arguments over Europe were dividing 
Britain. "With our obsession with Europe we see only the 
stagnation and lack of will of our partners in the Union." 
  He said companies should turn their attention to the fast 
growing economies of China, Korea, Taiwan, Hong Kong and 
Singapore. By the turn of the century there would be 50 million 
Asian households with an income of $30,000.

<F P=106> [By Grania Langdon-Down, PRESS ASSOCIATION crime </F>
correspondent] 
  [Text] The largest seizure of cocaine in the UK, valued at 
250 million pounds sterling, was found in drums of bitumen on 
its way from South America to Poland, it was disclosed today. 
  The 1,300 kilos of particularly high purity cocaine were 
discovered in a consignment of 48 drums by officers who searched 
a ship when it called in at Birkenhead, Merseyside, on January 
24. 
  Customs officers removed the cocaine and substituted other 
drums on board the Polish-American ship the MV Jurata, which was 
en route from Venezuela to Poland, and tracked it to Gdynia 
hoping to identify the smugglers, chief investigations officer 
Douglas Tweddle said today. 
  One man is being interviewed by Polish police after the 
drums 
were delivered to a warehouse on the outskirts of Warsaw on 
February 3, but customs officers were not able to identify the 
West European figures behind the deal. 
  Mr Tweddle said: "This massive seizure confirms intelligence 
reports that the South American `narcobarons' are targeting 
cocaine shipments on West Europe and are seeking to use South 
American countries as a back door. We are delighted to have 
been able to work with the Polish authorities to inflict this 
major blow on these drug traffickers." 
  Customs believe some of the cocaine would have filtered on 
to 
the streets of the UK. 
  Forty officers were involved in Operation Ayala, named after 
a racehorse which ran in the Grand National. 
  Customs identified the shipping route from South America to 
former Soviet states as a likely path for cocaine shipments. 
  Based on that intelligence they decided to carry out an 
intensive search of the MV Jurata's load. The crew of the ship 
were not involved and the substitute drums were sent on 
unnoticed. 
  It is the second large seizure of cocaine being routed by 
the 
South American cartels to Poland. UK customs tipped off Polish 
authorities about another consignment which led to 520 kilos of 
cocaine being seized in Poland. 
  Suspicion had fallen on 48 barrels of bitumen found in the 
drums. The first one was genuine but the other 47 had inner 
containers each packed with up to 30 kilos of cocaine. 
  They had been insulated to protect the drugs from the heat 
of 
the bitumen. 
  Mr Tweddle said in early January they had been able to 
identify a separate consignment travelling direct from South 
America to Poland which enabled the authorities there to seize 
520 kilos of cocaine. 
  The two operations meant the authorities had prevented two 
tonnes of cocaine with a UK street value of 400 million pounds 
sterling flooding on to the West European market. 
  "There is little doubt some of it would have ended up in 
Britain, probably via Germany and Holland. We hope this success 
will act as a catalyst for further ones in the future," Mr 
Tweddle said at the Customs House in London. 
  He said the Jurata was a "tramp steamer" which had stopped 
off at Birkenhead to unload some legitimate cargo. It had then 
stopped at Hamburg before completing its journey to Poland. 
  The seizure was the largest, not only in the UK, but also in 
Central and East Europe. There have been bigger hauls in Spain 
and Holland. 
  "With the collapse of the former Soviet Union, the Customs 
services in Central and East Europe are not particularly well 
developed and traffickers see places like Poland and Russia as 
an easy back door to West Europe," he said. 
  The previous biggest UK haul -- 907 kilos -- was discovered 
two years. [sentence as received]

<F P=106> ["tl"-signed report: "Bonn Trying To Gain Wider Support for </F>
EU Enlargement"] 
  [Text] Bonn -- In Bonn's view, enlargement of the European 
Union [EU] will be the focal point of German-British 
consultations in Chequers. The controversial British rebate on 
payments to the EU budget will, however, not be discussed during 
the summit, the Federal Government said. 
  Bonn is extremely interested in the European Parliament's 
approval of EU enlargement by Austria, Sweden, Norway, and 
Finland on 4 May. That is why Foreign Minister Klaus Kinkel 
will be going to Brussels in the evening following talks in 
London and Chequers to discuss the matter with German members of 
parliament. 
  In his talks with Prime Minister John Major, Chancellor 
Helmut Kohl also wants to address "the consistent moving toward 
the EU" of the Central and East European states. This was also 
the topic that Kohl put at the center of his working lunch with 
Jaques Delors in Bonn yesterday. 
  Economics Minister Guenter Rexrodt will have comprehensive 
talks with British Trade and Industry Secretary Michael 
Heseltine in London. Rexrodt is planning to visit the European 
capitals in the near future in preparation for the German [EU] 
presidency in the second half of 1994. London is considered the 
first and most important destination; a second visit by Rexrodt 
is scheduled for 9 July. 
  The economics minister is mainly seeking Britain's support 
for the deregulation offensive that he wants to make the focus 
of the second half of 1994. Competitiveness of European 
industry will be the central issue of the London talks. 
  Rexrodt and Heseltine also want to discuss aviation, 
telecommunications, and steel. In the field of aviation, the 
so-called future large aircraft, the joint production of a 
transport aircraft, will be discussed. Another item on the 
agenda is the joint development and production of aeroengines. 
This includes a comprehensive harmonization of export controls 
for dual use products that has been demanded by German industry. 
  German-British trade declined last year due to recession 
(- 3.9 percent in imports, - 0.3 percent in exports). In 
1992, German imports amounted to 43.57 billion German marks 
[DM], and exports were DM51.95, while the relevant figures were 
DM33.16 billion and DM46.61 billion in 1993. As in previous 
years, Germany was Britain's major trading partner in 1993 (14.0 
percent of foreign trade). Great Britain is one of the most 
important trading partners for the FRG as well (6.9 percent of 
foreign trade). 
  The Finance Ministry said yesterday that the German side 
wants to discuss the 1995 EU budget and financial implications 
of EU enlargement with British Chancellor of the Exchequer 
Kenneth Clarke. Another issue to be discussed is EU-wide 
measures against fraud. 
  Bonn denies that the EU rebate of DM6 billion per year, 
which 
Great Britain was granted in 1985, will be discussed in the 
London talks. Yet, it is not only the coalition parties and the 
finance minister, but also the Social Democratic opposition that 
wants to reshuffle EU finances in Germany's favor. The rebate 
for Great Britain is no longer justified, the Social Democratic 
Party's deputy chairwoman Heidemarie Wieczorek-Zeul said only 
recently.

<F P=106> [Report by Gerd Brueggemann: "Strategies Against Poverty"] </F>
  [Excerpts] Washington -- The United Nations estimates that 
the number of refugees seeking security and new life 
perspectives in other countries is approximately 100 million 
worldwide, with trends pointing strongly upwards. The World 
Bank has thus made this problem, along with issues of population 
growth, the focus of its annual spring meeting, which ended in 
Washington on Tuesday [26 April]. [passage omitted] 
  Federal Economic Cooperation Minister Carl-Dieter Spranger, 
who represented the Federal Government in Washington, pointed 
out that all measures suggested by the World Bank have to be 
accompanied by programs for the promotion of economic 
development because only then could one tackle the economic 
reasons of population growth and migratory movements. [passage 
omitted] 
  Spranger pleaded for close cooperation between 
industrialized 
and development countries with the objective to "contain 
international refugee and migratory movements and make them 
controllable." In regions with a large population, drain 
projects must be supported financially that diminish the reasons 
for exodus and migration in the countries of origin. Support 
for the reintegration of people who return to their home country 
is also of preeminent importance. 
  Apart from the population problem, much time was spent 
discussing the situation of world trade after the conclusion of 
the Uruguay Round. The World Bank expects the new GATT 
agreement to lead to $200-300 billion in annual income growths 
worldwide. With full implementation of the agreement, one-third 
of that amount would go to the developing countries. However, 
it is to be expected that not all countries will participate 
equally. Minister Spranger stated that this is why he strongly 
suggested that the World Bank and the IMF provide particular 
support to those countries that benefit only marginally from the 
GATT round.

  [Text] Taipei -- According to information that 
HANDELSBLATT received in Taiwan, the country is to get German 
submarines through cooperation with U.S. firms. The total order 
will be in the range of 10 billion German marks [DM]. 
Apparently, the supply of submarines to Taiwan is to open the 
door for selling a German ICE [Intercity Express] high-speed 
train worth DM30 billion to the Chinese island republic. Direct 
supply of submarines to Taiwan, but not cooperation, had been 
prohibited by the Federal Security Council in Bonn. 
HANDELSBLATT has been told that the U.S. Congress is expected 
to amend the Taiwan Act in the near future to create the legal 
possibilities in the United States for supplying the submarines 
produced jointly by German and U.S. firms.

  [Text] Bonn (DDP/ADN) -- The German Government has rejected 
reports that the supply of German submarines to Taiwan, 
originally banned in early 1993, is to go ahead after all via a 
different route. A government spokesman said today in response 
to a query that Bonn has "no plans" to send Taiwan any 
submarines via a cooperation agreement with U.S. firms. 
  Contrary to usual practice, German Chancellor Helmut Kohl 
stated publicly following a secret meeting of the Federal 
Security Council on 28 January 1993 that delivery is out of the 
question as far as Bonn is concerned. This position has not 
changed. 
  According to reports published in the HANDELSBLATT and NEUE 
ZEIT, the submarine deal with Taiwan is supposed to be worth 
around 10 billion German marks [DM]. In addition, the supply of 
the submarines is intended to open the way for the sale of the 
German Intercity Express high-speed train, a deal worth a total 
of around DM30 billion.

<F P=106> [Speech by Chancellor Helmut Kohl at the opening of the </F>
German-Singapore Economic Forum in the Chancellor's Office in 
Bonn on 13 April] 
  [Text] Esteemed Mr. Prime Minister, esteemed guests from 
Singapore, ladies and gentlemen, Dear Mr. Von Pierer: 
  It is a great pleasure for me, Mr. Prime Minister, to 
welcome 
you here today. Since my visit to your country about a year 
ago, we have been able to make good progress in fleshing out the 
agreements we achieved at that time. Today, at the beginning of 
our talks, we discussed further initiatives, which we want to 
shape intensively over the next 12 months. 
  Over the past years Asia has increasingly developed to an 
international economic and political focal area. As a turntable 
in the Southeast Asian region, your country, Mr. Prime Minister, 
is playing a special role in this respect. 
  Therefore I welcome the fact that today we are able to 
continue our dialogue about the deepening of our relations in 
the political, economic, technological, and cultural field. 
  During my visit to your country we discussed for the first 
time the idea of even closer cooperation between German and 
Singapore companies on the growing markets of the Asian region. 
I cite the PRC in this connection. I could also cite India or, 
for instance, aspiring Vietnam. There our companies can achieve 
great advantages if they proceed together. 
  I would like to especially express my pleasure, Mr. Prime 
Minister, that your predecessor, current Senior Minister Lee 
Kuan Yew, will visit us in a few days and that this also shows 
the strength of our relations. 
  In our talks we have always agreed on the particular 
importance that we attribute to the relations of our two 
countries in the economic and technological fields. The 
economic associations of our two countries -- and I would like 
to stress this gratefully here -- also decided in favor of this 
involvement right from the start. 
  Therefore today we can sign the founding document of the 
German-Singapore Economic Forum under the patronage of the 
Asia-Pacific Committee of German Industry. 
  However, I also want to stress that relations with your 
country and with Asia in general are of great importance not 
only for economic reasons but also with a view to cultural and 
political cooperation. 
  Germany must be and remain a country open to the world. This 
also includes that we cultivate friendship with many countries 
in the world. I am happy that the friendly cooperation with 
your country, Mr. Prime Minister, has developed so well. 
  In particular, I am happy that with the establishment of the 
German-Singapore Economic Forum we have managed to take another 
concrete step toward implementing the Federal Government's Asia 
concept. It is our response to the great and constantly 
increasing importance of the Asian region in the international 
economy. The task of the forum is to bring together companies 
from Germany and Singapore with similar interests in a direct 
and pragmatic way and to make good use of joint opportunities. 
  I note with pleasure that two projects have been signed 
today. The German laender are also open toward our idea of 
cooperation, in particular with regard to the PRC. Only 
recently did a delegation of entrepreneurs, headed by the 
Bavarian economics minister and accompanied by an official 
representative of Singapore, visit a Chinese partner province. 
A delegation from Baden-Wuerttemberg will soon visit two 
industrial parks in China, which have been planned by Singapore. 
  In this connection I would also like to mention that we 
expect Chinese Premier Li Peng to visit in a few weeks. It is 
our intention to contribute to having the important role of this 
important country in the Asian region meet with more attention 
and understanding both in the fields of economy and trade and in 
international politics in general. 
  Today I expect the visit of the mayor of Shanghai and in a 
few days the mayor or the representative of Guangzhou. I 
consider these intensive talks and contacts very important to 
gradually deepen political cooperation. 
  Esteemed Mr. Prime Minister, your country is enjoying an 
excellent reputation as a dynamic economic center in the Asian 
region. German companies have long valued this fact. Nowhere 
else in the aspiring markets in Southeast Asia are there more 
subsidiaries and representations of German companies than in 
Singapore. In many cases, they already fulfill supraregional 
business tasks. This is also a good basis for success in the 
work of the German-Singapore Economic Forum. 
  Mr. Prime Minister, I would like to express once again my 
pleasure at your visit. From our friendly personal relationship 
I derive the certainty that we will continue this good 
cooperation in the future. If a problem were to arise at some 
time, or some matter were not to proceed as intended, we have 
agreed, Mr. Prime Minister, not to wait long but to contribute 
toward a quick solution in a personal talk.

<F P=106> ["sm"-signed report: "Rexrodt Wants To Upgrade Taipei </F>
Politically, Too"] 
  [Excerpt] Taipei, 26 Apr -- After talks with leading 
politicians in Taipei, Economics Minister Guenter Rexrodt sees 
"very good chances" for the export of the German high-speed 
train, Intercity Express [ICE], to Taiwan. 
  The parliament in Taipei wants to make a basic decision in 
the period between May and July on the construction of a 350-km 
high-speed link between the capital in the north of the island 
and the industrial town of Koahsiung in the south, which would 
cost $17 billion. 
  Not only the success of the Intercity Express in Germany and 
the advanced technology speak for the German system, but also 
the fact that a German consortium is offering a private 
financing and operating scheme in accordance with the wishes of 
the Taiwanese parliament. Under the leadership of the Daimler 
subsidiary AEG, the German enterprises are prepared to make a 
comprehensive technology transfer, so that the Taiwanese 
industry, too, will profit from this project. 
  Rexrodt also stressed Germany's interest in the export of 
air 
buses, of short-distance traffic systems for the conurbation 
centers of the island, and of power plants and energy supply 
systems. 
  Basically, the government is interested in an 
intensification 
of economic relations, the economics minister stated during his 
talks with State President Lee Teng-hui, Economics Minister 
Chiang, Transportation Minister Liu, and leading 
parliamentarians. 
  Rexrodt welcomed the plan to establish a Taiwan center in 
Frankfurt and promised German support for the Taipei 
Government's wish to rejoin the United Nations and to be 
accepted by the newly founded World Trade Organization. 
  The Chinese partners demanded that Taiwan be deleted from 
the 
"H list" for exports, which includes countries that need a 
special permit for the export of goods that can be used for 
military and civilian purposes. Rexrodt stressed that the 
Federal Government is currently considering reducing this list 
from 36 to 8-12 countries. 
  A decision will be made by the summer. The German economics 
minister promised his partners in Taiwan that he will examine 
whether the next of the FRG's Asian economic conferences can 
take place in Taipei in 1996. [passage omitted]

<F P=106> ["hig"-signed report: "Convincing People by Creating Jobs"] </F>
  [Text] Bonn, 26 Apr -- The European trade unions are 
calling for a public and private investment program in Europe to 
curb unemployment. At the same time, an active labor market 
policy should open up new opportunities -- particularly through 
qualification programs. This was demanded by the chairman of 
the metal workers trade union, Klaus Zwickel, at an employment 
forum in Bonn, which was jointly organized by the European 
Commission, the German Trade Union Federation, and the 
Hans-Boeckler Foundation. "Europe must convince people by 
creating jobs," Zwickel demanded. This is the best publicity for 
the European Union [EU]. Currently, there are 20 million 
unemployed [11 percent] in the EU. 
  Jacques Delors, the president of the European Commission, 
used the event to emphatically support the Commission's 
proposals for the promotion of employment (white paper). The 
white paper is no attempt to change the balance of power in 
Europe, Delors stressed. Brussels does not want any additional 
authority. He warned against relaxing efforts to eliminate the 
structural causes of unemployment in view of the economic 
recovery. Delors called for a reversal of the logic of the 
current employment policy: Active expenditure promoting 
employment must be given priority. Unemployment benefits must 
only be granted as a last resort by the employment offices. 
According to Delors, new jobs will primarily be created in the 
sphere of social services, in the leisure and environmental 
industry, and in the media. However, these must not be "jobs a 
la McDonald," Zwickel demanded. The creation of future-oriented 
jobs in the industry and services on the basis of social 
benefits must be promoted. The reduction of unemployment must 
not be achieved through further deregulation and by cutting 
wages, as planned by Economics Minister Guenter Rexrodt. 
Zwickel also criticized "obvious deficits" concerning the 
social laws of the EU. Hardly any progress has been achieved in 
the collective representation of the employees. He expressed 
the hope that the Commission, the Council, and the European 
Parliament will not make it easier for the employers at the 
European level to prevent social regulations as is the case at 
the national level. The employment target must be clearly 
stipulated in the economic policy of the EU. So far, neither 
the instruments nor the institutions for an active European 
employment policy exist. The commission's white paper is merely 
an initial step to fill the dangerous gap in the employment 
policy. 
  Delors promised that he will try to ensure that the trade 
unions are granted adequate representation in the EU. This is 
necessary for Europe's social cohesion. It is important for the 
social partners to prove soon that they are responsible partners 
without whose cooperation nothing can be achieved. There can be 
no economic development without a social dimension, he stressed.

<F P=106> [Interview with Finance Minister Theo Waigel by Peter De </F>
Thier in Washington on 25 April: "Waigel Contradicts IMF 
Forecasts"] 
  [Text] Washington, 25 Apr -- Federal Finance Minister Theo 
Waigel does not share the IMF's pessimism about Germany's 
prospects for growth. In a SUEDDEUTSCHE ZEITUNG interview at 
the sidelines of the IMF and World Bank Spring Conference in 
Washington, Waigel said that he was banking on a growth rate of 
1.5 percent for Germany as a whole. The U.S. Government has not 
sought to pressure Germany into lowering its interest rates; 
U.S. Treasury Secretary Lloyd Bentsen knows how to value the 
independence of the Bundesbank. That aside, the United States 
has taken account of the fact that interest rates in the FRG are 
at a historically low level. 
  [De Thier] The FRG does not fare that well in the IMF world 
economic report. A growth rate of only 0.7 percent is expected 
for 1994. How can demands for moves to stimulate the economy be 
reconciled with your plans to consolidate the budget? 
  [Haider] I do not share the IMF's views on the prospects for 
growth. I am of the opinion that the report does not take 
sufficient account of the upturn in eastern Germany. The 
Federal Government believes that this year a growth rate of 1.5 
percent can be achieved for Germany as a whole. Favorable 
interest rates compared with the United States and the downward 
trend in inflation will further improve the overall situation. 
The IMF world economic outlook also contains a very positive 
assessment of our fiscal policy. The Federal Government's 
medium-term consolidation course is also considered a positive 
sign. 
  [De Thier] The IMF and the U.S. Government are demanding 
tougher measures to introduce more flexibility into the labor 
market. What can be implemented in the medium term in this 
respect? 
  [Waigel] We already dealt with that exhaustively at the G-7 
summit in Detroit. Everybody is in agreement on the need for 
more flexible labor markets. We need lower wage settlements to 
prevent production costs from rising. With respect to part-time 
work, we are well behind internationally, but in the case of 
support for medium-sized business, we are envied by our partner 
countries. In the case of greater flexibility, each country 
must do something by itself. However, we have laid emphasis on 
some important points with the Federal Government's action 
program. 
  [De Thier] Despite the latest reductions in key interest 
rates, your U.S. counterpart has repeatedly said that the 
Bundesbank has more scope for reducing interest rates further. 
Did the United States apply more pressure during the G-7 summit? 
  [Waigel] The U.S. Government has not made any more demands 
on Germany. Treasury Secretary Bentsen knows how to value the 
independence of the Bundesbank. The U.S. and the other G-7 
ministers explicitly welcomed the fact that the Bundesbank has 
used the scope available to it for interest rate cuts and in the 
short term, we are two percentage points behind last year's 
levels. The United States has also taken into account the fact 
that interest rates in the FRG have almost reached a 
historically low level and are still below long-term interest 
rates in the United States. 
  [De Thier] In view of the downward trend in interest rates 
in the United States and Germany, are you afraid that capital 
will leave the country? 
  [Waigel] Not at all, because in the end, the interest rate 
decisions in both countries were made in a way that has not 
caused tension in the exchange rates. The German mark's 
exchange rate in relation to the dollar has remained stable. As 
Germany's balance of payments -- including invisible trade -- 
deficit is declining, we also expect this stability to remain. 
  [De Thier] It is known that at the IMF, the Federal 
Government is opposed to issuing new drawing rights to the 
successor republics to the Soviet Union. How do you view the 
alternatives, such as the redistribution of the drawing rights 
that are already available? 
  [Waigel] We are ready to consider all alternatives to 
issuing new drawing rights. Of course, the IMF must see to it 
that the new member countries have a chance to participate in 
all the special drawing rights that are available.

  [Text] The Bonn coalition meeting today put on ice the 
controversial Bundeswehr cutbacks planned by Defense Minister 
Volker Ruehe. Under pressure from Foreign Minister Klaus 
Kinkel, the meeting decided to postpone a decision and to set up 
a working party. This is to devise an alternative plan for the 
future of the Bundeswehr, based on Ruehe's proposals. Foreign 
Minister Kinkel expressed his opposition to the planned 
reduction of the armed forces to 340,000 men.

<F P=106> ["eli"-signed report: "CDU Leadership Supports Ruehe's </F>
Bundeswehr Plans"] 
  [Text] Bonn -- The Christian Democratic Union [CDU] 
presidium is backing Defense Minister Volker Ruehe in the 
dispute about the Bundeswehr reform and has widely approved of 
"basic considerations" on a reform of the forces. CDU Secretary 
General Werner Hintze said in Bonn on Wednesday [27 April] that 
it is important to increase the Bundeswehr's efficiency and to 
prepare it for its future tasks. The presidium has worked out 
five principles on which the reform will be based: Compulsory 
military service must be maintained and equity in conscription 
increased. A structural reform must adjust the Bundeswehr to 
its new tasks, such as establishing crisis-reaction forces. The 
army needs modern equipment. And finally, some streamlining is 
necessary in the organization. 
  Hintze emphasized that the size of the army and the duration 
of military service must take these principles into account. 
Defense Minister Ruehe, who is a member of the CDU presidium, 
has always stressed that cutting the time of military service by 
two months and reducing the army to 340,000 troops is the only 
way to meet these requirements. Hintze pointed out that the 
working group set up by the coalition must produce results 
quickly and must not discuss the matter "for months." The 
secretary general said the talks should be concluded before the 
summer recess as the soldiers have a right to security of 
planning. 
  Social Democratic Party [SPD] Chairman Rudolf Scharping 
accused Ruehe of doing harm to the Bundeswehr. Scharping spoke 
of a "tug-of-war between two worn-out coalition partners 
motivated by party politics" that is carried out at the expense 
of the Bundeswehr. But the troops need perspectives they can 
rely on. They did enormous work in German unification and they 
have a right for speculations to come to an end. In its party 
program, the SPD is aiming at reducing the army to 300,000 
troops.

<F P=106> [Interview with Bundeswehr Inspector Hartmut Bagger by Frank </F>
E. Lippold; place and date not given: "The Gap Between the 
Mandate and the Funds Is Widening More and More"] 
  [Text] [Lippold] You have taken over your new function as 
army inspector at a time when the Bundeswehr is in a critical 
political and financial situation. How do you assess the 
situation? 
  [Bagger] Regarding the changed and increased spectrum of 
tasks, I, as the inspector, want a broad political and social 
consensus. In the past, it was also founded on basic military 
questions in our country. It is a great psychical strain for 
the affected soldiers and their families to identify themselves 
-- for example, in Somalia -- with a mission and to take 
personal risks, while uncompromising debates on the 
constitutionality of this mission are held in public. The 
Bundeswehr took over these new tasks and, at the same time, the 
available financial means were repeatedly cut. The gap between 
the mandate and the funds is widening more and more. 
  [Lippold] What can this lead to? 
  [Bagger] Effects can already be felt today in the training. 
However, the long-term consequences will be more serious because 
investment funds to modernize the army to the necessary extent 
are lacking. I am concerned about that. 
  [Lippold] What are the most important tasks and objectives 
of the new army structure? 
  [Bagger] The army must be able to fulfill tasks in the 
complete sphere of future operations, which range from the 
defense of Germany and its alliance partners to participation in 
humanitarian measures and peace missions. These objectives were 
implemented on the basis of resources in army Reform 5. The 
capability to defend our country continues to be our supreme 
objective. However, the security policy situation permits main 
defense forces, which need not be completely operational, to be 
used for this purpose in times of peace. 
  [Lippold] Who remains in a state of combat readiness? 
  [Bagger] About one-third of our forces are to be operational 
and in a permanent state of combat readiness. After the 
establishment of the constitutional prerequisites, they can be 
employed for crisis management within the framework of NATO and 
the Western European Union. Main defense forces and 
crisis-reaction forces continue to be part of an "overall 
system." When called to action, the army divisions should be 
mainly assigned to the multinational corps, since security can 
only be achieved through an alliance, as shown by our past. 
Thus, integration within multinational structures is also a 
characteristic of army Reform 5. 
  [Lippold] How can we prevent the development of a two-class 
army, that is to say the existence of privileged crisis-reaction 
forces and inferior troops for the defense of the country? 
  [Bagger] The term "two-class army" does not live up to my 
idea of the future democratic structure of the army. It implies 
a qualitative graduation. It is a fact that, in the future, we 
will have crisis-reaction forces and main defense forces that 
have to fulfill different tasks. Crisis-reaction forces must be 
made available, put in a state of combat readiness at short 
notice, and be highly mobile and flexible. Depending on 
mobilization, part of the main defense forces can be employed 
after an appropriate preparation period. The security policy 
situation permits this. 
  [Lippold] The defense budget, too? 
  [Bagger] In view of tight budgetary constraints, we will 
have to set priorities. These are now the crisis-reaction 
forces because there is a greater demand for a follow-up on 
their equipment and, according to the present assessment, the 
probability of their employment is comparably high. We are 
forced to make cuts in the main defense forces. 
  [Lippold] That is to say, there will be bipartition after 
all? 
  [Bagger] The unity of the army must not be lost. A 
qualitative differential between individual units that impairs 
their functioning would jeopardize the functioning of the army. 
As the person who is militarily responsible for the operational 
readiness of the army, I insist on maintaining the compatibility 
of crisis-reaction forces and main defense forces regarding the 
regular exchange of personnel and appropriate equipment. It is 
nothing new in the German army that we use weapons systems that 
vary in their modernness. 
  [Lippold] What tasks from the "German Unity" program does 
the army have to perform in the new laender? 
  [Bagger] The takeover of soldiers of the former National 
People's Army into long-term service as military servicemen or 
professional soldiers has been concluded. We are now trying to 
provide the soldiers who have been taken over with the necessary 
training that corresponds to their employment. The exchange 
between west and east will further advance the process of 
growing together. This growing together of people has to be 
promoted further and followed up in case of need where required. 
  [Lippold] What about the environment? 
  [Bagger] A uniform standard is also to be provided for the 
external framework, the barracks, and soldiers' apartments. 
Priority was given to this intention in the plan on the 
infrastructure. However, as a result of the repeated budget 
cuts, the financial means to carry out the necessary 
construction measures in time are lacking. 
  [Lippold] Your church grammar-school teachers reportedly 
criticized your decision to become a soldier as "some kind of 
recalcitrance on the part of a teenage lout." Do you think that 
the soldier's profession and military service as a whole has to 
be explained anew and socially upgraded? 
  [Bagger] The preservation of external security continues to 
be a basic function of the state, independent of analyses of any 
threats. For this task, every draftee continues to be 
indispensable and will remain so in the future as well. We 
certainly have to make people increasingly aware of the fact 
that the defense of the country and the alliance has to be 
carried out in the alliance area and not exclusively on German 
soil. In this way, following the security policy change in 
Europe, we are arriving at a situation in which the soldiers and 
also draftees of our allies have been for a period of 30 years. 
Again and again, military service has to be explained and 
justified to those who are to assume this civic duty. The young 
citizen should also do his duty in the increased spectrum of 
tasks because he understands that this is necessary. 
  [Lippold] Who can bring this home to him? 
  [Bagger] This is a political and social task. There is a 
pent-up demand in Germany. The Bundeswehr and the army are 
prepared to do their share. However, we also ask for the 
support of the parties and the public. Such an information and 
learning process is necessary. All of us must understand what 
it means to be a sovereign state and to be challenged -- in the 
positive sense -- as a sovereign state in Europe and the world.

<F P=106> [Interview with Heidemarie Wieczorek-Zeul, member of the SPD </F>
Executive Committee, by Ursula Knapp; place and date not given: 
"The Parliament Must Decide"] 
  [Text] [Knapp] The daily pictures from Gorazde are cruel. 
In view of such a dramatic development, is the Social Democratic 
Party of Germany [SPD] still able to maintain its position -- 
that is, to reject an armed intervention, including Bundeswehr 
soldiers? 
  [Wieczorek-Zeul] The situation is horrible. However, it is 
correct that so far, no party in Germany has demanded that 
German pilots fly air raids in the former Yugoslavia. God knows 
that military restraint in this region is appropriate for us. 
Any armed intervention would only exacerbate the situation even 
more. 
  As a last consequence, the question arises for the United 
States and NATO whether they should enter a ground war that 
cannot be won or whether they should try -- with military 
pressure and ultimatums as well -- to finally achieve political 
solutions, for example, at an international conference, as 
suggested by Yeltsin and Clinton. 
  However, I also want to point out one thing. NATO does not 
need to intervene in Turkey because it is already there. 
Nevertheless, it has been watching thousands of Kurds being 
massacred in eastern Anatolia over the years. In Rwanda, the 
United Nations need not intervene either because it is already 
there with blue helmets. It is now withdrawing them and leaving 
25,000 people who fled to its refuge to their fate. There are 
terrible double standards here. I feel that the discussion on 
the former Yugoslavia is often only used as a pretext in the 
domestic policy discussion in Germany to prepare completely 
different employment opportunities for the Bundeswehr. 
  [Knapp] One can also point out that the UN Security Council, 
not the Federal Government, resolved the missions in what 
remains of Yugoslavia. 
  [Wieczorek-Zeul] The UN Security Council adopted the 
resolutions, but the question of how and by whom they are to be 
implemented is the sovereign decision of each member country -- 
that is, also the FRG. The resolutions authorize the countries 
to become active, but they do not commit countries to war 
missions. 
  The constitutional side is a completely different business: 
Before the Federal Constitutional Court, we are above all 
interested in putting an end to the creeping development where 
it is tried to dissolve the limits set by the Basic Law. The 
Federal Constitutional Court took our complaints very seriously, 
as was shown by the hearing. The Bundeswehr can only be used 
for its own defense and the defense of the alliance partners -- 
that is, the NATO states. Those who want other employment 
opportunities must change the Constitution. The SPD has also 
made it clear how far it is prepared to change the Constitution. 
  [Knapp] How far? 
  [Wieczorek-Zeul] We are explicitly saying: the possibility 
of blue helmet missions and participation in blockades, which 
are definitely also an instrument of military constraint. 
However, it has to be ensured that the German Parliament 
decides on every individual mission. Things must not develop in 
the direction of soldiers and young draftees being dispatched 
all over the world. After all, German soldiers, young draftees, 
have to be able to serve on a safe constitutional basis. 
  [Knapp] What if NATO resolves further bombardments in 
Bosnia-Herzegovina on the basis of the UN resolution? 
  [Wieczorek-Zeul] Germany's participation in bombardments in 
the former Yugoslavia would be politically wrong and not covered 
by constitutional law. 
  [Knapp] Even after an amendment to the constitution that 
would be supported by the SPD? 
  [Wieczorek-Zeul] The Bundeswehr should not be involved in 
warfare. 
  [Knapp] It is rumored that, with your opinion, you no longer 
represent the majority within the SPD Executive Committee, at 
any rate not Rudolf Scharping. 
  [Wieczorek-Zeul] I am presenting the position that the SPD 
formulated in its party congress decisions. On this basis, we 
also presented the draft of a government program, which also 
reflects my position. Rudolf Scharping also made it repeatedly 
clear that the Bundeswehr will not participate in worldwide 
combat missions under a government led by the SPD. If someone 
wanted to change the SPD line, he would have to be open about 
his dealings. 
  As for the rest: Everyone who demands that German soldiers 
should go to war has to ask himself: Is he prepared to go 
himself or only prepared to send others? I am personally not 
prepared to send young German draftees and soldiers to war.

<F P=106> [Unattributed report: "Bosnia Is a Test for Russia"] </F>
  [Text] Bonn, 27 Apr -- The CSU [Christian-Social Union] 
wants to integrate the countries of Central Europe in West 
European and North Atlantic institutions "quickly and 
decisively." Christian Schmidt, chairman of the foreign policy 
working committee of the CSU land group in the Bundestag, said 
at a CSU foreign policy congress in Bonn that the opening-out of 
the WEU, NATO, and European Union [EU] is a "question of 
Europe's future." There is a "unique chance" of expanding an 
all-European "peaceful order" right now, he said. This chance 
might disappear in a few years' time. 
  Referring to Serbia and Russia, both Schmidt and CSU Land 
Chairman Glos pointed out that the young Central European 
democracies are afraid of new wars. These countries feel that 
the West is not taking their worries seriously. This applies 
not just to Poland, the Czech and Slovak Republics, and Hungary; 
but also, for instance, to Slovenia. 
  According to the CSU land group, the Central European 
countries should be associated with the WEU "soon" and take part 
in EU foreign policy consultations. They should be able to join 
NATO "in the medium term." The decision about this rests with 
the individual countries themselves and NATO. "There is no 
right of confirmation whatsoever concerning countries outside 
NATO," he said, with reference to Russian demands on this 
subject. 
  Relations between Russia, CIS, and NATO should lead to a 
close partnership. Glos said that the West wants to "win over" 
Russia as a partner, but veto rights should not be linked to 
Moscow's important role. "Certain internal political 
developments in Russia" are a cause for concern, he said. 
Russia's conduct in Bosnia is a "test of its credibility," 
according to Glos. "The hour of truth has come," he said. 
  Schmidt said that bilateral agreements between NATO and 
Russia concerning strategic cooperation and joint international 
peacekeeping activity are possible. However, it is 
"unthinkable" for Russia to join NATO right now. Even so, 
cooperation with Russia is of "decisive importance" for the 
development of a European security structure. The security 
partnership with the Russian Federation must include a strategic 
and stabilizing partnership for Europe. In view of the internal 
political differences within Russia on the subject of NATO's 
"Partnership for Peace" [PfP] offer, Schmidt called upon the 
German Government to explain to Moscow that PfP mainly concerns 
the stability of peace. "Also in this respect, Europe is 
condemned to the success of Yeltsin and the reformers," said 
Schmidt. 
  As far as the EU is concerned, the CSU insists that the 
Maastricht Treaty Review Conference scheduled for 1996 should 
encourage a consolidation of West European foreign and security 
policy. The EU must "involve itself more thoroughly" in Bosnia 
and Croatia. Schmidt said: "The danger of a conflagration in 
the European home cannot be offset by the use of half-strength 
fire doors alone."

<F P=106> [Dietrich Menkens report: "Green Grass Roots Rebelling </F>
Against Leaders"] 
  [Excerpts] Berlin -- Among those Greens, who have entered 
in a coalition with the Social Democratic Party of Germany 
[SPD], resistance is growing against the coalition course with 
the SPD set down by the party leaders. At land delegates' 
meetings in Baden-Wuerttemberg, Lower Saxony, and Berlin over 
the weekend [23-24 April] the "cozying up to the Social 
Democrats" was sometimes loudly condemned. The Greens in 
Stuttgart announced that they will make their own election 
statement, in which they will distance themselves in some issues 
from the decisions made by the Mannheim federal congress. 
There, prominent party representatives, such as Ludger Volmer 
and Joschka Fischer, had persuaded the party to make a clear 
coalition statement in favor of the SPD. 
  The grass roots in Lower Saxony are rebelling most strongly. 
In protest against the pragmatic course, the delegates of the 
land party congress in Wilhelmshaven elected Gila Altmann, a 
representative of the left wing, to place one on the ticket for 
the next Bundestag election. She was one of the harshest 
domestic policy critics of the red-green coalition in Hannover. 
[passage omitted] 
  Daniel Cohn-Bendit, an "ultraleftist" at the national level, 
has even threatened with a party split. The reason: The 
pragmatists are pushing the left wing out of the party. The 
main addressee of the criticism is the "secret party chairman," 
Hesse Environment Minister Fischer, who wants to maneuver the 
Greens to the political center. On the weekend he said for the 
first time that for him a coalition with SPD and Free Democratic 
Party of Germany would be conceivable. Fischer is propagating 
"a feasible reform policy, with which 51 percent of the voters" 
can be reached. [passage omitted]

<F P=106> ["gb" report: "Money Market Rates Falling"] </F>
  [Text] Frankfurt/Main, 27 Apr -- On Wednesday [27 April] 
the German Bundesbank granted loans to the business banks at an 
interest rate of 5.47 percent within the framework of its weekly 
money market business. Last week, this so-called third prime 
rate was still 5.58 percent. Shortly afterwards the Belgian 
National Bank announced a reduction of its money market rate 
from 5.7 to 5.6 percent. Experts consider it likely that over 
the next few days other central banks in Europe will also 
slightly reduce their interest rates.

<F P=106> [Speech by Finance Minister Theo Waigel in the Bundestag in </F>
Bonn, in a debate on the spring report of six leading German 
economic research institutes; broadcast in progress -- live] 
  [Excerpts] In Washington I took the opportunity to 
describe the German Government's economic and financial strategy 
as the basis for the upswing now clearly emerging. Our 
international partners appreciate and recognize, above all in 
the light of our overcoming the reunification process, that 
through our savings and growth policies over the last year we 
have been successful in our balancing act aimed at limiting 
deficits while at the same time creating an important boost to 
growth. This also applies to January's investment and 
innovation package aimed at small- and medium-scale firms. 
  Our financial policy is on the right track. We have enjoyed 
more significant success in terms of consolidation than many 
others. According to IMF calculations, Germany will achieve the 
best results in reducing the structural budget deficit by 1995. 
[applause] 
  Together with Japan, we will next year have the lowest 
structural deficit among the leading industrial states. Our G-7 
partners have acknowledged that this determined policy of 
consolidation will allow us to meet the criterion for joining 
the currency union on time, stipulated in the Maastricht Treaty 
as a deficit quota measuring 3 percent of GDP. 
  An issue which was prominent at earlier conferences figured 
hardly at all this time around in Washington; namely, the 
question of allegedly excessive German interest rates. Looking 
back, our path of stringent budget consolidation twinned with 
cautious but steady interest rate cuts by the Bundesbank has 
proven to be wise, correct, and forward-thinking. [applause] 
  This has enabled us to meet the markets' expectations 
regarding stability. It allowed Germany to attain low long-term 
interest rates by international standards during the difficult 
first few years following reunification. Germany's long-term 
interest rates are now 2 percentage points below the long-term 
average. Even the most recent interest rate fluctuation proved 
to be lower than in most other countries. For the first time in 
four years, the interest rates on the German capital market are 
lower than those of the United States. This represents a vote 
of confidence by the markets for Germany's efforts toward 
stabilization as well as future economic developments. 
  The success of our economic and financial strategy has also 
stretched to inflation rates. The IMF as well as the research 
institutes expect a fall in inflation to an average of 3 percent 
in 1994. During the second half of the year it will fall back 
below 3 percent. 
  However, the IMF will probably have to revise its prognosis 
on one point. A growth rate of 0.9 per cent for Germany as a 
whole in 1994 is, in view of the almost across-the-board upswing 
among the economic indicators, too little. I have therefore 
offered IMF director Michel Camdessus a bet that it will be 
substantially higher. Now that the research institutes have in 
effect joined in this bet with their prediction of 1 percent 
growth for western Germany and 1.5 per cent for Germany as a 
whole, I am relaxed about the inspection of my estimate at the 
end of the year. What Mr. Rexrodt [economic affairs minister] 
predicted in his annual economic report will in fact be 
bettered; he was right on target with his prediction. [applause] 
  In the years 1992 to 1994 there was growth, for example, 
for eastern Germany of over 26 percent. That can be compared 
with the losses in production in the countries of Central and 
East Europe. You should just look at the places which have not 
had the benefit of the type of aid we have given in the transfer 
of funds from West to East. And the people in the former GDR 
would be in the same plight as people in Bulgaria and Romania if 
your [Social Democratic Party--SPD] policy were in force, and 
you should be ashamed if you do not take that into account. 
[applause] [passage omitted] 
  Ladies and gentlemen: Today, Germany and Europe are in 
direct 
competition with the successful industrial nations of East Asia. 
North America has also formed itself into a strong economic bloc 
in NAFTA. We must derive our strategy of adaptation from these 
international developments. We cannot afford esoteric ideas 
based on a national framework. Last December's report on 
Germany as an industrial location and the action program for 
more growth and jobs show us confronting international 
developments. On the other hand, the SPD has nothing to offer 
but tired slogans about redistribution of wealth and the 10th 
edition of their standard jobs program dating back to the 1970s. 
  We will only move forward on the narrow path of growth by 
setting the right course on tax policy. In the view of the 
research institutes there must be no additional burdening of 
those who make a special contribution to added value. We mean by 
this the so-called higher earners, whom the SPD see as belonging 
to an annual income bracket as low as 40,000 to 50,000 German 
marks. [passage omitted] 
  The report of the institutes and the most recent 
international meetings underline that we are on the right path. 
The initial criticism with regard to an alleged burden on the 
world economy arising from reunification is being transformed 
more and more into an astonished recognition of what we are 
achieving in economic and financial policy in spite of the 
unique historic tasks. We can already clearly see the process 
of normalization reflected in the statistics. Public sector 
deficits, the level of borrowing, growth, the rate of inflation, 
and unemployment are at least following the international 
average. Often we can show better results that other comparable 
industrial nations. [passage omitted] 
  All the efforts and all the difficult decisions have proven 
worthwhile. This is no wishful thinking. The clear figures and 
facts of the experts at home and abroad show we are right and 
the decision at the federal elections in October will be 
determined by these facts.

<F P=106> [Wolfgang Koydl commentary: "What Will Come After Saddam?"] </F>
  [Text] Sometimes, in silent hours of self-knowledge, even 
George Bush must begin to see that his fantastic Desert Storm 
made quite a stir, but moved little in the Gulf: The oil 
emirate of Kuwait has slid back into its authoritarian 
feudalism, and arch-rogue Saddam Husayn is still in office. The 
former U.S. President has to look for the mistake in his own 
quarters, because he always said one thing, did the second, and 
wanted the third. 
  This changeling of a U.S. policy for the Persian Gulf was 
inherited by Bill Clinton, to whom not many new things for this 
region, where 65 percent of the world's known oil reserves are 
deposited, have occurred since that time. On the whole, 
Washington limits itself to sticking to the regime of sanctions 
that the United Nations imposed against Iraq more than three 
years ago. 
  However, this embargo has had few effects, at any rate fewer 
than the West had hoped for at first. In Baghdad there is no 
indication of a broad opposition to the regime of Saddam that 
has developed from need, rather of a certain solidarity. 
Moreover, the sanctions had an effect to the contrary. On the 
one hand, a dangerous diplomatic vacuum developed in 
Mesopotamia. Iraq was declared a leper to whom nobody talks -- 
and of whom, therefore, nobody knows anything. On the other 
hand, the sanctions are preventing the West from considering a 
political strategy for the Gulf because they lead one to believe 
in sham stability: As long as Saddam Husayn rules, he 
guarantees Iraq's cohesion and, at the same time, justifies the 
international quarantine that, on its part, is defusing 
Baghdad's potential threat. In this way, the embargo is 
degenerating into a comfortable control instrument that seems to 
make any crisis planning superfluous. 
  However, it would be appropriate to think about the time 
following the lifting of the sanctions. After all, several 
scenarios are conceivable, if not probable: 1) The gradual 
softening of the embargo. This would enable Saddam to rearm 
himself secretly. 2) Increased international pressure that 
leads to the lifting of the sanctions by the United Nations. In 
that case, Saddam would remain in power and would have won all 
along the line. 3) The overthrow of the despot by people from 
his clan or the military (of which there are indications in 
Baghdad). In that case, the successor would have another name, 
but he would have the same moustache or would pursue more or 
less the same policy as Saddam. 4) The overthrow of the regime 
by a popular uprising. This might lead to a civil war, in which 
Turkey, Saudi Arabia, and above all Iran would probably be 
involved. 
  The West, particularly Washington, is not prepared for any 
of 
these variants. The reason is alarmingly banal: The United 
States does not know what it wants. Personal revenge on Saddam? 
This is desirable because the man is a criminal, but it is not 
necessarily the guideline of a rational foreign policy. The 
overthrow of the ruling class in Iraq? This is understandable, 
but hardly feasible in view of the economic and political power 
and the sheer will to survive of Saddam's courtiers and 
officers. The punishment of the 18 million people of Iraq? 
What for, perhaps because they did not get rid of the 
dictatorship long ago? Leading Iraq back to the community of 
civilized states? Not even Kuwait and Saudi Arabia, the United 
States' closest partners in the Gulf, are fulfilling this 
criterion. 
  The latest attempt by U.S. [National] Security Adviser 
Anthony Lake to outline a new Gulf policy was an excuse rather 
than an answer to these questions: Accordingly, the times when 
Washington alternately supported Iran and Iraq as a regional 
policeman are said to be over; the new magic word is dual 
containment [preceding two words in English], of both Tehran and 
Baghdad. 
  If only the United States did not hurt itself in this tour 
de 
force. If Washington really wants to keep these two historical 
Gulf superpowers in check, it has to ensure alone the security 
of one of the most important and dangerous regions of the world 
-- with its permanent troop presence and permanent bases. It 
would be pure self-deception to rely on Saudi Arabia. This 
artificial product of a state is highly unstable and might 
completely break down under the pressure of a close U.S. 
embrace: One can easily slip on oil. 
  A responsible policy for the Gulf must be the exact opposite 
of dual containment, that is, dual involvement. That means that 
the United States recognizes the historical, economic, 
political, and military role of Tehran and Baghdad in this 
region. Both states have to be involved in a comprehensive 
political concept where everything, from oil prices via 
disarmament to joint security, can be discussed. The United 
States wants a stable Gulf, so that the flow of oil does not 
come to a standstill. The neighboring states have exactly the 
same interest. This is not a bad basis for a Gulf policy.

  [Text] Jacques Delors, who was the guest of Arte 
Television's Transit program this evening, said he entirely 
agrees with the NATO ultimatum given to the Serbs. The 
president of the European Commission in Brussels thinks that an 
international peace conference should be held as soon as 
possible: 
  [Begin Delors recording] As things stand now, that is what 
has to be done. Then if the Serbs have finally understood, an 
international peace conference should be organized in order to 
find a solution, which will unfortunately be based on the 
partition of the territory, which is now inevitable. 
  This is the second time I have felt ashamed in my life. The 
first time was when I ran away, walking a 500-km distance, 
running away from the German troops in 1940 during the invasion 
of my country, when there were no French troops to defend us. 
This is the second time I have felt ashamed of myself. The 
first time I was 12 or 13 years old. The construction of Europe 
gave me hope that this would all change. I am nearing the end 
of my career and I fear that I will bear this shame until the 
end of life. Yes I am ashamed! [end Delors recording]

<F P=106> [News conference held by Romanian President Ion Iliescu at </F>
the Palais Marigny, in Paris on 15 April: "News Conference by 
President Ion Iliescu in Paris"] 
  [Text] 
<H5>  Statement Before the News Conference </H5>
  [Iliescu] I would like to say just a few words. The 
political part of the visit is drawing to its end. I would like 
to say that the entire visit, my talks with politicians, the 
prime minister, the foreign minister, and the presidents of the 
two chambers of parliament, and my meetings with the 
representatives of the employers have been very open and 
friendly. First, we wanted to convey our message of friendship 
toward France, on this, my first visit here at this level -- 
that is, my first state visit to France, as I have been to 
France on several other occasions in the past, for various 
international conferences or on private visits, about a year and 
a half ago, but this is my first state visit here -- and I 
believe that it marks an important political moment in the 
development of political relations between our two countries. 
This visit is also a response to President Mitterrand's visit 
to Romania. Second, the political discussions that I have 
conducted here offered an opportunity to draw up a balance sheet 
of the state of our relations. We came to the joint conclusion 
that political, scientific, and human relations are developing 
very favorably. We can ascertain, both in Romania and France, 
that regardless of the political differences in terms of 
government, a constant atmosphere of good relations between our 
countries is being maintained at the bilateral level. We want 
to emphasize and underscore this. Another very important aspect 
stressed during the visit is the joint interest in developing 
our economic relations. In my political discussions as well as 
in the talks with the representatives from business, I pointed 
out the need to develop bilateral ties in this sphere and 
France's role in our economic relations. We noted that there 
are many positive examples of mutually advantageous relations, 
but we also noted that the situation in this field is pretty 
modest, hence we should jointly make further efforts to 
capitalize on the overall positive climate in the economic 
sphere, as well. Of course, there are problems in our country, 
since we are in a time of transition. There is a lot of 
inertia, inertia of the state apparatus and economic units, as 
well as disruption caused by the abolition of the old 
structures and decentralization. All these phenomena are linked 
to the transition and are causing problems. However, we must 
overcome these difficulties. We have a joint interest in 
economic integration into Europe. France must ratify Romania's 
association accord with the European Community, a procedure 
which will take place next week; the Senate will ratify the 
accord at the beginning of May. Thus, Romania will be 
integrated into this system of relations. We also talked about 
the political problems of the continent -- the Yugoslav 
conflict, security problems, and the French initiative regarding 
a European framework of stability. Generally speaking, I would 
like to point out that all the talks that I have held here have 
been positive and that I found a platform for cooperation and 
for expanding our bilateral ties. We also had a festive moment 
at the Paris City Hall and I took that opportunity to convey our 
sentiments to the citizens of Paris as well as the intention to 
develop our relations at this level, too, that is between our 
local administrations. 
<H5>  The Dialogue With Journalists </H5>
  [Correspondent] Are any agreements going to be signed during 
your visit here? 
  [Iliescu] It is not the object of our state visit to sign 
economic agreements. We just reviewed all aspects of political 
and other relations between our countries and emphasized the 
joint will and desire to capitalize on the very favorable 
framework of the relations between our countries, to consolidate 
it, to facilitate the expansion of bilateral relations, and to 
take joint steps at various European levels to promote stability 
and security on the continent as well as the process of 
all-European integration. 
  [Correspondent] Mr. President, a Paris daily has today 
published an article by Doina Cornea [leader of Romania's 
opposition Group for Social Dialogue], who, instead of welcoming 
you to France, actually criticizes the authorities in Romania 
for hesitation -- and I would like you to clarify this for the 
French press -- for hesitation over Romania's policy between 
East and West and the results of this hesitation. 
  [Iliescu] We are not surprised about Mrs. Cornea's opinions. 
She constantly says "no" to everything; therefore her statements 
always have an emotional connotation for electoral purposes. 
Therefore, I believe one should not attach too much importance 
to her assessments. Regarding our foreign policy, I do not 
think one can talk about vacillation, but, on the contrary, 
there is a constant element in our foreign policy that, I could 
say, enjoys an unanimous backing, regardless of Romania's 
internal controversies and problems, which are natural in any 
political struggle. I believe that there is a very broad 
understanding, as far as the political language and consensus 
are concerned, on the major points of our foreign policy. We 
have been able to ascertain this at various times when Romania 
had to adopt certain positions and I have noticed that there is 
a common platform of understanding on these issues. 
  What does "oscillation between East and West" mean? All 
the West European countries are interested in and are promoting 
an active policy toward Central and East Europe and toward 
Russia, in particular. What Mrs. Cornea wants, s what she is 
aiming at and the ideas that she is advocating, is that Romania 
should promote a policy designed to create tension in relations 
with Russia. However, this is not in Romania's national 
interest. Neither the United States nor the European countries 
think that it is in their interest to promote such a policy. I 
emphasized a special aspect of the issue, which I believe I even 
told our French partners about, namely that France is 
represented in Chisinau by its embassy in Moscow, not by the 
French ambassador in Bucharest. Hence, you can see how far 
sensitivity toward relations with Russia goes. Therefore, what 
are we supposed to show? Such a thing is totally unwise. I 
believe that last night's statements by President Mitterrand on 
the balanced nature of Romanian policy are a commensurate 
assessment of an experienced politician, who shows greater 
understanding for Romania's national interests than certain 
Romanians, who have no political feeling toward the problems of 
concern for Romania. 
  [Correspondent] Mr. President, you have conducted a steady 
diplomatic activity in the Balkans. What is Romania's mediating 
role in the region? 
  [Iliescu] Of course Romania, as well as the close neighbors 
of former Yugoslavia and of Serbia, is very concerned with the 
events in the former Yugoslavia. Romania is directly affected 
by the embargo. But the conflict as such, which can pose a great 
danger for the entire region, directly affects and concerns us. 
There is no doubt that our means are very modest. 
Nevertheless, despite all this, we have made and continue to 
make efforts to contribute to creating a favorable climate for a 
political solution. We conducted talks on the issue with 
important French politicians yesterday and today. We found a 
common platform on the conclusion that military methods cannot 
help solve the problem. Generally speaking, military means 
cannot offer solutions. On the contrary, they create 
complications and exacerbate tensions. That is why I believe 
that we should promote only political solutions and all efforts 
should focus in this direction. We appreciate all the efforts 
made by the European Community, the United States, and Russia to 
contribute to a rapprochement and a proper climate for helping 
the parties directly involved to find political solutions. Of 
course, when conflicts break out -- and it is always easy to 
trigger a conflict -- it is much more difficult to stop them. 
When the conflicts have already taken on proportions and people 
have been killed, then the vendetta exacerbates the situation. 
This is how the situation has evolved in the former Yugoslavia: 
First the conflict broke out between the Serbs and the Croats 
and later on it extended to Bosnia; well, it is much more 
difficult now to find an acceptable solution for all sides. We 
have also witnessed certain contradictory developments, since 
there are times when there is hope for a solution. In the last 
few days, I have witnessed quite a few contradictory moments. 
We hope that a solution will finally be found. In this case, 
as far as Bosnia is concerned, it is clear that we cannot 
resolve the problem without the Serbs and that solutions must be 
found to facilitate the dialogue among all sides in Bosnia -- 
the Croats, the Muslims, and the Serbs -- together. I cannot 
make any comments on the raids. Anyhow, I consider the resort to 
force and military means -- we have proof of it before us -- as 
ineffective in solving problems. One should make further 
efforts to support political dialogue and solutions. 
  [Correspondent] You have often said that France is one of 
the 
most friendly countries toward Romania. I would like to know to 
what extent this visit to Paris will help overcome the 
reservations that certain European countries still have toward 
Romania. 
  [Iliescu] I would say that, from this viewpoint, things have 
improved and the evolution has been quite positive in recent 
years within the Council of Europe and the European Union. 
There has also been a change in the position of various 
countries in Europe vis-a- vis Romania and Romania's admission 
to these European institutions. This means that there is a 
positive evolution in general. France has helped us throughout 
this period in direct talks and in other negotiations within 
these European bodies and I hope that this visit will make a new 
contribution to improving the overall climate for our 
integration into Europe and for our direct relations with the 
other states in West Europe. 
  [Correspondent] I would like to ask you, Mr. President, 
whether the problem of the minorities, and especially the 
Hungarian minority, was mentioned during the talks? In a 
broader sense, do you think that Hungary and Romania are very 
far from signing a friendship agreement? 
  [Iliescu] We have not particularly focussed on these 
matters, 
but, of course, in talking about a stability pact in Europe and 
in Central and East Europe, we tackled the issue of relations 
between neighboring countries and mentioned our position of 
openness toward everything concerned with relations with all our 
neighbors, and particularly Hungary. 
  I believe that others have problems in accepting Romanian 
tradition and legislation, particularly with regard to the 
Hungarian minority, since we are talking about it. In talks 
held with Hungary's representatives -- not here, of course -- we 
have noted that it is more difficult for Hungary accept Romanian 
policy regarding legislation and constitutional provisions on 
the parliamentary representation of all minorities; various 
studies; teaching and education in the mother tongue; and 
communication and cultural institutions in the mother tongue. 
These apply not to the Hungarian minority, which is the largest 
and has these possibilities, but also for the smaller ones, too. 
In this respect, we have no difficulty in discussing and 
adjusting ourselves to European norms. I believe that others 
have more difficulty in adjusting to these norms than we have. 
However, I think that on this issue of good understanding with 
the neighbors, it is not only the problem of the minorities that 
counts, but also the whole range of issues linked to relations 
of good understanding among the neighbors. We would also like 
to create such a climate. We believe that we have good relations 
with our neighbors, even with Hungary. There is some 
controversy regarding various aspects, even with regard to the 
basic political treaty between our countries, but I hope that 
after the elections [in Hungary], when things quiet down, we 
will find a common solution to create a legal basis for good 
neighborliness between our countries. There is no reason for us 
not to maintain normal relations between our countries. We have 
a common interest in promoting relations of good neighborliness. 
We can say that, even now, we have better economic relations 
with Hungary than with the other neighboring countries and that 
all the conditions exist for good communications between our 
countries and the citizens of our countries. Therefore, I hope 
that the climate will improve after the electoral campaign, 
which generally affects the people's thinking. 
  [Correspondent] Mr. President, what answer will you give to 
King Mihai's request to spend the Orthodox Easter in Timisoara? 
Maybe you will change your attitude, in view of the evolution 
toward a calmer situation in your country? 
  [Iliescu] I have openly stated my attitude vis-a-vis this 
visit. Former King Mihai was already in Romania for the Easter 
holiday in 1992. Last October, he made a similar request. I 
asked him to regard his visit to Romania as private, not as the 
sovereign, as he put it. In this respect, we asked him to adopt 
a clear position regarding his attitude toward the existing 
constitutional form of the Romanian state. We asked him to 
respect this choice of the Romanian people and the private 
character of his visit. However, this problem will be resolved 
by the Romanian Government, through direct communications with 
him. This is not necessarily the way for him to give an answer, 
but he must make a clear commitment if he wants to receive a 
visa. You know that the members of the Bourbon family were not 
allowed to visit France for a whole century. The first Bourbon 
was allowed to set foot in France only during de Gaulle's time. 
You know that in Italy no representative of the royal family 
has been allowed in the country since 1947. You also know the 
Greek Government's position vis-a-vis the former king. We do 
not want to take similar measures, but we want to have clear-cut 
relations in this respect. 
  [Correspondent] Romania is member of the Francophonie [group 
of countries]. The French Parliament is currently holding a 
debate on the French language. What are your feelings in this 
respect and what can you say in this connection? 
  [Iliescu] Romania participated in the last meetings in Paris 
and Mauritius as a full member of the organization. We belong 
to several Francophonie commissions. Therefore, we are already 
an active member and are concretely participating in the 
activities of this organization. We even suggested that a 
Francophonie meeting should be organized in our country. The 
matter is still under discussion. The next meeting will held in 
Benin. As for 1997, there is a proposal from Vietnam in this 
respect, which will be accepted. Consequently, Romania will 
offer to host the meeting in 1999. 
  [Correspondent] What are your results regarding the 
encouragement of foreign investment in Romania? Are there 
pressures from abroad for further political reforms to be 
promoted? 
  [Iliescu] I believe that we have very liberal legal and 
juridical provisions for stimulating foreign investment and 
there is already an active presence of the foreign capital in 
our economy. We have some 30,000 joint companies with foreign 
capital. However, the level of investment is still very modest, 
since the invested capital amounts to $1 billion. Therefore, 
we expect proposals for larger investment. We have a new 
government initiative, which is now being discussed in 
parliament, for new incentives to be granted to large investment 
projects in excess of $50 million. Similarly, we are also 
discussing a law on setting up free trade zones. We are now 
organizing free-trade zones near Constanta and we hope that 
these new facilities will encourage the participation of large 
investors. Investors from all over Europe are operating in our 
country, from France, Italy -- Italy ranks third in investment, 
while France is in the second place -- Germany, England, and the 
Netherlands. These states have already made sizable investment. 
The Japanese and South Koreans will follow suit. Therefore, we 
have accumulated some experience and we hope to develop it 
further in the near future. 
  [Correspondent] Mr. President, you said that France would 
be the best investor for Romania. If my information is correct, 
the sum total of the capital invested is $80 million. This is 
no small amount, but then again, it is no big sum either. On 
the other hand, you realize that France is going through a 
rather difficult economic period right now. Under these 
circumstances, do you think that your visit will mark the start 
of overcoming reticence? What are your hopes after this visit? 
  [Iliescu] I discussed this subject particularly with Premier 
Edouard Balladur and the representative of the French employers. 
On the one hand, we praised the positive French presence and 
certain interesting and efficient experiments. For instance, 
there is the ALCATEL company, which has set up a joint company 
in Timisoara to produce telephone exchanges, as an integral part 
of a strategic program to modernize the central urban telephone 
network in Romania. There are two companies participating in 
this program, which thus ensures a proper competitive framework. 
There is AlcateL, with a joint company set up in Timisoara, and 
Siemens, with a joint company in Bucharest called 
Electromagnetica. Together with the Ministry of Communications, 
all sides have divided their assignments among themselves and 
are competing to cover the entire territory with new equipment. 
We have had three stages in the development of the telephone 
network in Romania. The first stage -- 60 years ago -- was 
based on mechanical technology and is still operational today in 
Bucharest, at the Telephone Palace. The second stage began in 
the 1960's, with technology assimilated from domestic 
production. The first step was made by Electromagnetica in this 
respect. Now we are entering the third stage, based on the 
computerization of telephone communications. Therefore, this is 
a good experience, properly appreciated by both the French and 
Romanian sides. A second experience that I would like to 
mention is linked to my recent visits and talks with the 
Bouygues company. This is one of the strongest and 
internationally known companies in construction. It is building 
the most important project currently under construction in 
Bucharest, namely the World Trade Center, as an institution that 
will be integrated into the global computerized communication 
network in international trade, with its center at the World 
Trade Center in New York. The complex will include a Star 
Jument Hotel, shops, exhibition halls, and office space for 
commercial companies. This also represents an interesting 
experiment. Bouygues has cooperated with Romanian designers, 
experts, and engineers, hence it has been a good experience. 
Bouygues plans to expand this kind of activity in Romania. 
Similarly, there are cooperation ventures in electronics, the 
start of cooperation with companies from Lorraine, and there are 
interesting projects in agriculture; in this respect, I recently 
visited a seed-producing joint company. I would also note a 
three-year-old joint experiment in sugar beet growing and 
processing. I visited the Urziceni factory, which has joined 
the project and has shown good and profitable results, including 
for our French partner. There are quite a few projects that 
prove the use and mutual benefit of cooperation. Both of our 
sides assessed the volume of this participation as still rather 
modest. However, despite certain difficulties, we believe that 
it is possible to expand it. I have examined this matter with 
the representatives of the French employers and with Prime 
Minister Balladur, who promised to examine certain aspects 
directly linked to credits, so as to ensure the appropriate 
facilities. Therefore, I believe that my visit and talks have 
made an important contribution to stimulating common interests 
along these lines. 
  [Correspondent] Mr. President, since I suspect you of being 
an emotional man, I would like to suggest the following 
scenario: Suppose that you had just arrived in Paris now, not in 
your capacity as president, but as simple Romanian citizen, and 
had discovered Paris adorned with Romanian and French flags. 
The question is: What kind of thoughts would spring to your 
mind? Then, I would like you to tell me whether you can give us 
some details about the continuation of the French-Romanian 
dialogue at high or other levels. 
  [Iliescu] Regarding the emotional aspect, I would obviously 
feel very pleased with such an expression of mutual sentiments 
of friendship, which are but a continuation of a very rich 
tradition throughout our history. Regarding the prospects for 
continued dialogue, this is very clear. We are talking about 
determination to continue this dialogue. We are expecting the 
visit of the French foreign minister to Bucharest at the 
beginning of next autumn. Similarly, we have invited Prime 
Minister Balladur to visit Romania at the end of the year, and 
Mr. Balladur has accepted. We have also invited the president 
of France, Mr. Francois Mitterrand, to pay another visit to 
Romania. We also expect a number of visits at the ministerial 
level this year, in order to work out the concrete details of 
the joint projects in various fields, including the economic one.

<F P=106> [Article by Andre Dumoulin, research assistant at the </F>
European Institute for Research and Data on Peace and Security 
(GRIP) in Brussels: "A Profound Review of the French 
Prestrategic Concept"] 
  [Text] If the debate about the method of using the 
technical nuclear weapons in the possession of NATO has never 
really ceased, the French prestrategic component, of which the 
Pluton, and then the Hades, missiles were the symbols and the 
stakes at risk, have never been excluded from it. From foreign 
sources, the perception of the nonstrategic component of the 
French nuclear force has periodically been put forth as a 
justification for the refusal to participate, with full 
confidence, in the building of a secure Europe with Paris as the 
motivating force and guarantor of stability, based on its 
minimal strategic deterrent capacity. 
  From the historical point of view, and apart from the 
transition from the concept of a warning shot as a test to that 
of a final warning that must have its own military efficiency, 
the prestrategic doctrine has undergone many fluctuations. 
  However, certain French politicians and experts, including 
Jacques Chirac and Francois Heisbourg, have finally advanced the 
idea of carrying out the final warning on the very territory of 
the aggressor. While this proposed method has the advantage of 
avoiding collateral damage to close allies and of being entirely 
attributable (the opponent's radar would determine precisely who 
was responsible for the ground-to-ground shot), confusion could 
develop about the distinction between a warning shot and a 
strategic shot, with consequences one can readily imagine. 
Paradoxically, this desire to make the final warning dependent 
on a strike of strategic range had the effect of stripping the 
principle of tactical nuclear warning of its legitimacy. 
  If the Hades can no longer be the potential basis for the 
building of a secure Europe, and if French doctrinal specificity 
in the prestrategic realm has never resolved the basic 
contradiction between the political message of the atom and 
nuclear support of tactical maneuvers, France today must 
approach the doctrine of the prestrategic warning strike in a 
different way. 
  Nuclear weapons today are undergoing a veritable conceptual 
and doctrinal revolution that is being given further impetus by 
the reduction in military budgets. This change is operating in 
two main directions. 
  First of all, we are seeing a rebirth of the strategic 
level. 
In other words, a considerable number of so-called tactical 
conventional weapons will in the end be used within a strategic 
framework, while in the nuclear sector, their counterparts with 
a limited range of action in the nuclear sector will have to be 
enhanced to give them greater range, or they will vanish from 
the military landscape. 
  The second trend is toward conventional weapons and 
polyvalence in the weapons systems previously assigned an 
exclusively nuclear capacity. Based on the lessons of the Gulf 
war, the numerous stages of infrastrategic nuclear deterrence 
might be replaced by conventional deterrence through the use of 
strategies based on strikes from a distance, preventive strikes, 
and classic long-distance strategic strikes. 
  Tactical nuclear weapons are being replaced by 
high-precision 
classic weapons with very powerful explosive charges--MLRS 
[multiple rocket launchers], FAE [fuel air explosive] bombs, 
bombs with a zone-saturation effect, and conventional cruise 
missiles. These replacements are capable of achieving the same 
results in the field, while they also eliminate the problem of 
certain undesirable effects, both immediate and deferred, such 
as unacceptable collateral damage, residual radioactivity, and 
political and philosophical criticisms. 
  With the effort to ensure greater polyvalence for its 
prestrategic aerial vectors, France should be able to approach 
the problem of the warning strike today with greater 
flexibility. The emergence of a multipolar world makes an update 
the "three-circle" strategy and a review of the doctrine and the 
needs related to the prestrategic strike necessary. The goal is 
indeed a transition from such a specifically East-West warning 
to an "all-points" strategy. This requirement for flexible use 
is only met by the cruise missile. 
  Where the strategic nuclear weapon would continue to serve 
as 
life insurance for the vital interests of France, the 
conventional weapons for retaliation, which are less powerful 
but more accurate, would have the task of conveying warning 
messages on more tolerable, but equally effective, levels. 
  At the intermediary level, a high-altitude warning strike in 
the form of EMP [electromagnetic pulse] charges would provide 
earlier protection of the vital interests of France, making 
clear the possibility, as an entirely last resort, of strategic 
nuclear intervention in the event that this deterrent measure 
failed. 
  There is nothing to prevent the establishment of a new 
French 
prestrategic concept based on conventional weapons. At a time 
when nuclear weapons cannot cover all of the risks with which 
France might be faced, and when its vital interests at the heart 
of the nation are less and less threatened, in the military 
sense, it becomes desirable to organize the conventional 
resources and to extend their use to strategic missions. 
  In addition, conventional warning weapons are better suited 
to a sharp, precise, and very meaningful blow delivered within a 
context that is no longer exclusively East-West, but 
multidirectional, with strategic and political-military goals 
that have high priority but are less and less vital, in that 
they do not in any way involve a threat to the national survival 
of continental France. 
  The use of conventional weapons for a prestrategic strike 
would also have the advantage of simultaneously preventing the 
disproportionate use of weapons, by limiting the process to the 
reasonable conventional level, as well as facilitating speedier 
coercive and classic warning strikes without the danger of 
escalation to extreme measures. It will from now on be a matter 
of a conventional deterrent that is credible because it is 
practical, as distinguished from nuclear deterrence based on the 
nonuse of the weapon. 
  At a time when the new British defense white paper, 
"Defending Our Future," which came out last July, has raised 
further questions raised about the nuclear air-to-ground missile 
that was to replace the WE-177 gravity bombs, and which was to 
be the possible focus of cooperation with France or the United 
States, it is probable that Paris cannot avoid a redefinition of 
prestrategic nuclear missions. 
  With the probable disappearance of chemical weapons toward 
the year 2000, the elimination of a large part of the 
American-Russian nuclear theater and tactical weapons, as well 
as the reductions in the strategic realm resulting from the 
START [Spacecraft Technology and Advanced Reentry Tests] 
treaties, the remaining nuclear potential will increasingly be 
considered in terms of the logic of nonwar, within a context of 
"existential deterrence," thus being reduced to a subsidiary and 
residual role. Following this new definition, the 
high-technology conventional weapons will be able to acquire a 
deterrent capacity that, unlike that of nuclear weapons, can be 
more easily adapted to conflict situations of low or moderate 
intensity. 
  Today, clarification and the placing of nuclear instruments 
and pertinent doctrine in proper perspective are needed. In 
France, the drafting of the white paper and the military 
planning law expected this coming spring should favor this new 
strategic approach, setting aside certain contingencies and 
taboos.

<F P=106> [Report by Jean-Francois Couvrat: "An Extremely Austere </F>
Budget With One Target: Unemployment"] 
  [Excerpt] Reducing unemployment is Edouard Balladur's sole 
objective for next year. He will devote to it all the available 
state financial resources, in other words, savings made 
elsewhere. Hence the extreme budgetary austerity imposed on his 
ministers in the guidelines he sent to them yesterday. They are 
to reduce their administrative spending by 8 percent with the 
franc at its present value, and any operational spending which 
does not involve legislative, regulatory, or contractual 
commitments by the state by 15 percent. Ministers will have to 
justify their equipment spending project by project. Finally, 
they will have to implement a redeployment of civil service 
staff: The guideline letter does not mention cuts in staffing 
levels but, setting the expected productivity increases by civil 
servants at 1.5 percent, it aims to form a kind of "reserve" 
force facilitating redeployment. 
  On these bases, the budget negotiations promise to be very 
tight, in keeping with the aims defined in these initial 
guidelines. There is no doubt that services adopted by vote 
will be called into question, that the granting of all kinds of 
state subsidies and benefits will be tightened up, or even that 
some services regarded as unnecessary may find their future at 
stake in the coming weeks. These are all initiatives suggested 
in letters sent by Budget Minister Nicolas Sarkozy to most of 
his colleagues at the same time as the prime minister's letter. 
  The Budget Ministry stresses that this is the only way to 
achieve the government's objective, i.e., a reduction in 
unemployment, within the narrow framework laid down by the 
five-year law on public finances and the Franco-German 
convergence plan. And this is to be achieved in an economic 
situation which is still fragile: Those who are drawing up the 
budget are at present counting on a growth rate of 2.4 percent 
in 1995, in other words rather less than the official forecast 
(2.7 percent) and than the rate hoped for by Edmond Alphandery 
(3 percent). [passage omitted]

<F P=106> [Interview with Economics Minister Edmond Alphandery by </F>
Daniel Vigneron; place and date not given: "Alphandery: 
`Europe Must Not Fear Asia'"] 
  [Text] [Vigneron] French economic influence is waning in 
Africa and the Maghreb, limited in Asia, and marginal in 
America. Is this decline unavoidable, or does the current 
government have the will to react? Do we have the capacity to 
change this situation? 
  [Alphandery] I do not agree with this view of a decline. I 
think it is quite the opposite. Look at Africa: France helped 
mobilize the Bretton Woods institutions when the countries of 
the CFA [African Financial Community] area broke down 
completely, and it allocated considerable resources to cancel 
the debt of 25-billion francs [Fr]. We are making a major 
effort in Asia, as you will see at the next annual meeting of 
the Asian Development Bank, of which France holds the 
presidency. For example, we played a decisive role in bringing 
Vietnam back onto the international stage. In addition, France 
has maintained the high level of aid it provides to developing 
countries. On the American continent, French companies are 
making inroads through direct investments, and we are set to 
double our share in the capital of the Interamerican Development 
Bank. We have major investments in East Europe and Russia, a 
point which I will return to. Thus, our foreign policy under 
[Prime Minister] Edouard Balladur and [Foreign Minister] Alain 
Juppe, and especially our foreign economic policy, is very 
active, much more so than in recent years. The situation is not 
like before World War I, but our country still holds some sway 
and we certainly have not collapsed, since we are the world's 
fourth largest exporter. 
  [Vigneron] How do you see Europe's economic future compared 
with that of our major American and Asian competitors? Is there 
a way for European industry to increase its competitiveness 
other than through relocation? 
  [Alphandery] We must be careful not to base our view of 
Europe's future on the depressed situation from which we are 
just emerging. Structurally speaking, our continent has major 
advantages. For decades now, Europe has accumulated a 
formidable stock of physical and financial capital. Moreover, 
it has unrivaled human resources. Who, apart from the 
Americans, can pride themselves on such a dense network of 
high-performance universities, educational establishments, and 
research bodies? Of course, Europe has its problems, but we are 
trying to resolve them. This is presently the case with our 
attempts to find a more flexible labor structure, which lies at 
the heart of European thinking, irrespective of the different 
ideas some countries may have. It is also true that our 
secondary education is perhaps not as suited as it should be to 
the requirements of the modern world. Another problem is the 
ponderousness of our administrative structures. However, I 
believe our structural strengths outweigh our weaknesses. Europe 
must not fear the dynamism of Asia, quite the contrary. All the 
better if Asia is developing, as there are major markets there 
for our industry. 
  [Vigneron] In these conditions, why do you defend the idea 
of 
a social clause, which will not solve the situation of extreme 
social poverty in the Third World and whose possible 
effectiveness looks very limited? Is this not rather a 
hypocritical way of protecting ourselves from competition from 
poor nations? 
  [Alphandery] We got our message across very clearly at the 
G-7 summit on employment in Detroit. The way in which I argued 
for the clause proved that there is no underlying protectionism, 
so much so that the Americans adopted it. It is in no way an 
attempt to prevent developing countries from benefiting from a 
comparative advantage, that is certainly not the aim. What we 
are saying is that there are situations that are morally 
unacceptable -- I am thinking of child labor or forced labor -- 
and which concern human rights. We wanted to obtain the 
possibility of discussing this issue of social standards as soon 
as possible in the framework of the future World Trade 
Organization (WTO). The Marrakesh plan clearly lays the ground 
for this. 
  [Vigneron] Do you think, like the Americans, that the OECD 
should play a more active role in managing major international 
problems? 
  [Alphandery] First, I would like to say that the OECD has 
done its job well. The G-7 summit has moreover assigned it 
important studies, such as that on the labor situation, which 
was very much appreciated, and, more recently, a study on 
obstacles to growth. The OECD is therefore performing its role 
well. In addition, it receives little criticism. The 
organization is well-managed and I can see no reason to change a 
winning team. That is why I would like Jean-Claude Paye to 
continue in his job. In any event, he has the support of France 
and many other countries. 
  [Vigneron] How far along are we with the studies on 
employment that are to be presented at the next G-7 summit in 
Naples? 
  [Alphandery] The Detroit summit on employment was something 
of a first, since traditionally the G-7 meetings have been 
devoted to financial and monetary issues. This initiative by 
the United States concluded with a very interesting result. Of 
course, there is no single answer to the unemployment problem, 
but there were points of agreement. For example, everyone 
agreed that unemployment is as much a structural as an economic 
problem, and that small- and medium-sized enterprises [SMEs] are 
a valuable source of jobs. Similarly, everyone agreed on the 
need for flexibility in the labor market. The policy of vainly 
forging ahead by increasing budget deficits was unanimously 
rejected. In short, the discussion was considered sufficiently 
in-depth to justify a follow-up at the Naples summit. 
  [Vigneron] Is there a good level of coordination within the 
G-7? 
  [Alphandery] Yes, rather good. The G-7 managed to put out 
some important messages. The proof of this is that Japan 
announced a number of recovery plans, and Europe continued to 
cut interest rates. This proves that the voice of the G-7 was 
listened to and that this forum of coordination is far from 
being useless. I stress the word "forum," because the G-7 is 
not an institution and France refuses any moves toward making it 
one. 
  [Vigneron] Let us move on to consider Europe. Has Franco 
German rapprochement made any progress and, after the latest 
German interest rate cuts, do you feel completely in step with 
Bundesbank monetary policy? 
  [Alphandery] The important thing, and I would like to 
emphasize this, is that Europe is continuing to cut short rates 
despite the rise in Americans interest rates. Yesterday, the 
[Bank of France's] Monetary Policy Committee cut its key rates. 
The two cuts in German interest rates in the space of a single 
week are also welcome. Naturally, this creates a favorable 
climate across Europe. Why? Because the basic economic 
conditions are favorable for monetary relaxation. We are 
therefore on the right tracks, despite the recent rise in U.S. 
long-term interest rates. Looking beyond that, the central 
problem is medium-term cooperation, and especially French-German 
cooperation. The fact that we decided last summer to present 
all our convergence programs and develop them on the basis of 
similar inflation and budget deficit hypotheses was a major 
factor for the stability of Europe and the European Monetary 
System in particular. If ever a signal was clearly perceived by 
the international community, this was it. It is based on the 
extremely simple idea that economic convergence is a 
precondition for monetary convergence. 
  [Vigneron] What are the concrete signs of this convergence? 
  [Alphandery] First and foremost, both the French and German 
economies are recovering at quite similar rates: German growth 
should be around 1 to 1.5 percent this year, while we are 
forecasting 1.4 percent for France. We have similar aims in 
terms of budget deficit. There is also another point that is 
very positive, particularly for the smooth introduction of the 
second phase of Economic and Monetary Union [EMU]: Germany and 
France will consecutively assume the presidency of the European 
Union [EU]. Moreover, within the scope of the Franco-German 
Economic and Financial Council, I intend to propose to my German 
counterpart, Theo Waigel, a continuous and joint program to 
ensure that the action taken by the German presidency will be 
continued by the French presidency. This is a very beneficial 
coincidence for European construction. 
  [Vigneron] With the entry, next year, of four new members 
and 
the prospect of further EU enlargement to include East European 
countries by the year 2000, how do you see Europe's 
institutional and monetary future? Is the nature of the EU not 
going to change, and is a multispeed Europe not unavoidable? 
  [Alphandery] I am convinced that enlargement through four 
new 
members will enrich the EU. These are high-income countries and 
they will be net creditors. The enrichment will be both literal 
and figurative! Of course, this enlargement must go 
hand-in-hand with a deepening of the EU. I will see to this 
personally since, in the first quarter of 1995, I will be the 
first president of the Council of Economic and Finance Ministers 
for the new, 16-strong Europe. As for what you call the 
two-speed Europe, it would be impossible to have different 
speeds because Europe is based on the principle of equality 
between states. However, for technical reasons, the Maastricht 
Treaty itself provides for a variable calendar for Europe. 
Depending on the degree to which the convergence criteria are 
met, some countries will be ready for EMU before others. It is 
wise to ask everyone to meet the convergence criteria and to let 
everyone do so at their own rate. 
  [Vigneron] Do you not think that the five or six states 
that will be capable of forming a monetary union will adopt 
economic measures that will further distance them from the other 
states? 
  [Alphandery] I do not think so. It would, on the contrary, 
be a major factor of attraction. When the other countries see 
that the states that have already achieved monetary union are 
greatly benefiting from this, they will make even more of an 
effort to speed up their integration. They will be stimulated 
by this. 
  [Vigneron] Compared with the measures taken since 1989 by 
previous governments, does France now have a new policy with 
regard to the East European countries in transition? In a way, 
do you not have the feeling that France has missed out on an 
historic, political, and above all economic opportunity to renew 
ties, given its past influence in this region of the world? 
  [Alphandery] I will say, first, that foreign policy does not 
fluctuate according to the whim of governments. Diplomacy is 
often marked by continuity. However, there have been a number of 
notable shifts in our policy with regard to Central and East 
Europe. In particular, there is our will to implement concrete 
projects that are more immediately noticeable to the people and 
more directly profitable to the emergence of an economic fabric 
of private SMEs that will create future employment in these 
countries. On this last point, I do not agree with your 
analysis: Many of the officials with whom I have contacts in 
these countries have expressed their satisfaction at what we are 
doing. 
  For example, at the beginning of last week, in St. 
Petersburg, I met with the Russian prime minister and the town's 
mayor and I saw for myself how much they appreciate France's 
involvement, both on its own initiative and in association with 
the international community, as part of the European Bank for 
Reconstruction and Development [EBRD] and the G-7, to ensure 
development in Russia and other countries. France has mobilized 
considerable resources and is one of the largest contributors to 
development in East Europe. The figures prove it: From 1990 to 
1993 inclusive, France contributed Fr63.6 billion to help 
finance East European countries, in the form of direct, 
bilateral, or EU aid (Fr16.6 billion); export credits (Fr11 
billion); and debt restructuring (Fr36 billion for the French 
share). This considerable effort has made France the fourth 
largest contributor of aid to Russia (behind Germany, the United 
States, and Japan) and the second for aid to Central and East 
Europe (behind Germany but ahead of the United States and 
Japan). We are also the fourth largest investor in the whole 
area (behind Germany, the United States, and Italy, but ahead of 
Japan). As you can see, we are firmly established among the 
leaders. We are also very well represented by French companies. 
Look at St. Petersburg: Credit Lyonnais has offices there, and 
the Banque Nationale de Paris. 
  [Vigneron] France is the second largest foreign investor in 
St. Petersburg, behind Spain. 
  [Alphandery] I suggested to Mr. Sobchak (Anatoliy Sobtchak, 
the mayor of St. Petersburg) that the St. Petersburg region 
should benefit as a priority from the EBRD venture capital fund 
that we have backed to the tune of Fr120 million. France is 
present, and this presence is appreciated. My Hungarian 
counterpart told me that recently, as did the Romanian president 
during his recent visit to Paris. Do not forget that France 
also has obligations toward other areas of the world, like 
Africa. 
  [Vigneron] You recently attended the meeting of the CFA area 
ministers. Do you expect a favorable context to develop that 
would give an economic impetus to Africa? 
  [Alphandery] Let us remain prudent. The devaluation of the 
CFA franc was a very delicate operation. For the time being, 
everything is going well: Inflation remains under control, most 
of the countries have signed an agreement with the IMF, and 
there has been no social explosion. However, the battle has not 
yet been won. We must remain vigilant. In particular, we must 
maintain wage levels, broaden the tax base, and generally ensure 
that there are no divergent policies within the zone. If the 
operation succeeds, it will create the conditions for renewed 
competitiveness and, as a result, the well-being of the African 
people--whose purchasing power has been severely dented by the 
national deficits and financial asphyxiation--has been improved. 
The countries of the CFA area must now return to growth so that 
they can find the room for maneuver enabling them to implement 
the structural reforms that are so vital for development. 
  [Vigneron] Over the last 30 years, France has been closely 
involved in the economic policy of the countries of black 
Africa. Is not their failure to adjust--which resulted in the 
devaluation--first and foremost France's failure? 
  [Alphandery] No, not at all. The real problem was the 
deterioration in the terms of trade during the second half of 
the eighties. The sudden drop in market prices for certain 
types of raw material almost ruined a number of African 
countries. It is true that this situation could have been 
resolved by devaluing the CFA franc at an earlier stage. 
However, the African countries hesitated for a long time before 
they made this difficult decision. 
  [Vigneron] France at last appears to have taken an interest 
in the Asian markets. Do you think that the COFACE [French 
Insurance Company for External Trade] guarantees will make it 
possible for us to increase our economic presence, which is 
currently judged insufficient in this area of strong growth? 
  [Alphandery] Asia is a very diverse area with many 
opportunities for our companies, but it is also an area of high 
risk and intense competition. I therefore think that it is a 
good sign that 40 percent of COFACE's 1993 pledges and 25 
percent of its actual guarantees cover Asia. Our presence in 
Asia can never be high enough, but the results are there: For 
example, our exports to Asia are growing rapidly and were up 15 
percent in 1993. That means that jobs are being created or 
saved in France. 
  [Vigneron] But what about relocations? 
  [Alphandery] Relocation works both ways. You also have 
capital from all over the world investing in France. I cannot 
repeat enough that, in 1992, France was on a par with Britain 
and outperformed any other country in attracting direct foreign 
investments. That just shows how attractive France is and 
proves that we are an open country. 
  [Vigneron] Are you developing a specific policy with regard 
to the four Asian tigers [Hong Kong, Singapore, South Korea, and 
Taiwan]? 
  [Alphandery] You know, our trade deficit with those four 
countries as a whole is positive. The only one with which we 
have a trade deficit is Taiwan. The success we had in Korea 
with the high-speed train proves how well we are performing. In 
these countries, our aim is also to increase sales of financial 
services. Our financial system is very competitive and is one 
of our main strengths. We make the best use of our strengths. 
During the GATT negotiations, along with my U.S. counterpart 
Lloyd Bentsen, I laid much emphasis on the liberalization of the 
financial markets, especially in Asia. We will continue to push 
this point because negotiations are to resume in this area. 
  [Vigneron] You are president of the Board of Governors of 
the 
Asian Development Bank [ADB]. France will host the bank's 
annual meeting in Nice in early May. What are your expectations? 
  [Alphandery] We expect 2,500 delegates, 1,000 of whom are 
bankers. The ADB is a development bank that is working very 
well, to such an extent that it is to double its capital from 
$24 billion to $48 billion. In Nice, the extraordinary economic 
development in this region of the world will be confirmed. 
However, it will also be a forum for making new contacts. In 
this respect, I believe that the fact we are welcoming a large 
number of Asian business leaders to France will be an 
unprecedented opportunity for French companies to lay the ground 
for future relations.

  [Text] Paris, April 28 (AFP) -- Air France made a net 
consolidated loss after minority interests of 8.476 billion 
francs (1.5 billion dollars) last year, the state-controlled 
airline said on Thursday [28 April] at the end of a board 
meeting. 
  In 1992 the company had reported a loss of 3.266 billion 
francs. 
  The results for 1993 included a provision of 1.8 billion 
francs to restructure the company. 
  The board delayed a decision on the sale of its majority 
holding in the Meridien hotel group, the company said. It had 
decided to "accept the view of the privatisation commission to 
choose between the two bids which had been retained." 
  These bids are from the British Forte group and from the 
French Accor company. 
  Air France is believed to have debts of 37 billion francs, 
analysts here noted, and is struggling to survive its massive 
losses. 
  Restructuring of the company is linked to liberalisation of 
the French air transport industry which was taken a step 
forwards on Wednesday when the commission of the European Union 
found in favour of a complaint by the French TAT airline against 
the French government. 
  TAT, of which British Airways (BA) owns 49.9 percent, 
obtained an instruction from the Commission to the French 
Government that it must open Orly airport south of Paris to 
flights to Toulouse and to London. 
  BA said that this effectively opened Orly to other airlines. 
  The French Government wants to inject 20 billion francs into 
Air France and has said that half of this sum could be provided 
this year if the EU Commission approved it under competition law. 
  The Commission, in approving a takeover by Air France of the 
French airline Air Inter in 1990, had laid down as a condition 
that France should open its markets gradually to more 
competition from within the European Union. 
  The French Transport Ministry said late on Wednesday that it 
would appeal to the European Court of Justice against the 
decision about Orly. 
  The decision would entail "serious consequences, by opening 
the whole French internal network to competition without a 
transitional period," it said.

  [Text] The situation, a month after the general elections, 
is that President Oscar Luigi Scalfaro has ended his 
consultations [to form a government], and Forza Italia leader 
Silvio Berlusconi is one step away from being asked to form the 
next government. Fabrizio Ferragni reports from the Quirinale 
[president's official office and residence]: 
  [Ferragni] Behind me you can see President Scalfaro, who has 
just emerged. He came here about five minutes ago to say hello 
to us -- the journalists who have been following the meetings. 
  The president made a short statement. There were no 
questions. Basically he said that he was the guarantor -- in the 
last few days the subject of guarantors has been discussed. I 
will be the guarantor of the Constitution, of the principles of 
the Constitution, and of the unity of this country, he said. 
  Scalfaro is expected to ask someone to form a government 
tomorrow morning, and it is almost certain that it will be 
Silvio Berlusconi.

<F P=106> [Report by Guido Dell'Anquila] </F>
  [Excerpts] It seemed as though it had all been sorted out: 
President Scalfaro was going to be a super-guarantor and was 
ready to appoint Berlusconi premier. Then problems started and 
Berlusconi has still not been asked to form a government. 
[passage omitted] 
  [Dell'Aquila] It is not Scalfaro who is 
hesitating--Berlusconi has asked for more time. He wants all 
the pieces of the jigsaw in place before he takes up the mantle, 
in order to avoid surprises. 
  There are at least two problems which still have to be 
solved. On the one hand there is the problem of 
guarantees--Berlusconi's dual role as premier and businessman. 
Yesterday, Scalfaro came forward to play the role of 
super-guarantor, but today the Northern League has applied the 
brakes. The League's Francesco Speroni has said: Berlusconi 
will be watched by us and by parliament. 
  The other problem still waiting to be solved concerns the 
much criticized plan to divide the functions of the Interior 
Ministry. However, the Northern League is sticking to its guns.

    [Editorial Report] Rome RAI Uno Television Network in 
Italian during its news program at 2100 GMT on 27 April carries 
a 22-minute interview with Northern League leader Umberto Bossi. 
  Asked to comment on the possible division of the Interior 
Ministry, Bossi says: "Local government need not be run by the 
same ministry that runs the police, the country's security. 
These two things are different, which is how they should be. 
What is being discussed is not the separation of the ministry's 
local government sector from its security sector. The Interior 
Ministry is what we are discussing. We believe it is essential, 
it is in the League's hands to offer the country and ourselves 
guarantees. In the government coalition, there are parties that 
have their origins in the Christian Democratic Party, and if 
they are given the Interior Ministry, this would mean complete 
continuity with the old government." 
  Bossi confirms this is why the Northern League is opposed to 
the idea of former President Francesco Cossiga becoming interior 
minister. He says that if the League does not obtain the 
Interior Ministry, he would be happy with the Ministry of the 
Autonomous Regions. He says: "If the League does not obtain the 
guarantee that it can carry out certain checks -- I say this 
again and stress it in the country's interest -- in the interest 
of democracy, we could, we would still support the government, 
but we would do this from the outside." 
  Bossi says he is completely opposed to Radical leader Marco 
Pannella being appointed foreign minister. He says that Forza 
Italia is wrong to see Pannella as some sort of bridge with the 
Left, and that he is not the right man for such an important and 
sensitive post. 
  Bossi also stresses what he saw as the need for an 
anti-trust 
law: "The situation is difficult with a prime minister like 
Berlusconi, who is an eminent businessman. I do not mean that 
eminent businessman should not be politicians or become prime 
ministers. They can, but on certain conditions, that is, on 
condition that there is no conflict of private and public 
interest. It is clear and easy to understand why this should be. 
A series of legal complaints could be made, which could bring 
the government to a standstill." 
  Bossi says that the Northern League also wants the Treasury 
Ministry: "Without exaggerating, the League believes that it is 
very important we have the Treasury Ministry and not the Budget 
Ministry, which is what we have been offered, because the 
Treasury Ministry controls spending. If we do not have control 
over spending and the country's security, it would be like 
asking the League to sign a blank check. In a situation where 
the prime minister is an eminent businessman, in a country 
without a serious, real anti-trust law -- there is an anti-trust 
law; we started off with an anti-trust law based on sectors, and 
four or five years ago, for the first time, we voted in an 
anti-trust law; but it is controlled politically -- there is a 
political guarantor rather than the ordinary judiciary. The 
results of this anti-trust law are plain to see: they are the 
bankruptcy of important sectors such as steel and chemicals." 
  Bossi says he believes a privatization policy should be 
aimed 
at creating widespread ownership and not selling state assets to 
a few powerful families.

<F P=106> [Report by Ingrid Steiner: "Brugger: `Neofascists Are </F>
Starting an Avalanche"] 
  [Text] The South Tirolean People's Party (SVP) howled in 
outrage about the latest statements by the Italian neofascists 
(MSI) [Movimento Sociale Italiano] in and about South Tirol. 
Therefore, at the special meeting with the protective power 
Austria today, Thursday, SVP Chairman Siegfried Brugger wants to 
get an "assessment of the new situation in Italy" from Vienna. 
Said Brugger in an interview with KURIER: 
  -- about the neofascists: 
  "Italy is the first country in West Europe to make old and 
new fascists socially acceptable. A party that has never 
distanced itself from fascism will participate in the 
government," Burger states, seeing "reason for concern." And 
when Italian MSI Chairman Fini "is permitted to call Mussolini 
the greatest statesman of the 20th century, something dangerous 
is going on," Brugger told KURIER. "I am afraid that the slogans 
of the MSI are indeed developing in the direction that they are 
aiming for." 
  -- on safeguarding the autonomy: 
  The SVP chairman sees difficult times ahead for the minority 
Germans and Ladins. Therefore, together with Vienna it must be 
examined "to what extent the security mechanisms of our autonomy 
are internationally anchored and effective to defend our 
autonomy." 
  -- on help from the outside: 
  However, Brugger also expects diplomatic pressure on Italy 
-- 
because international treaties are involved. "If one carelessly 
undermines international treaties, one starts an avalanche. And 
this might also have a dangerous effect on South Tirol."

<F P=106> [Henrique Cymerman and Oriol Domingo report: "Jordi Pujol </F>
Demands Turnaround in Autonomy as Condition for CiU's Supporting 
Government"] 
  [Excerpt] Tel Aviv/Barcelona -- Premier Jordi Pujol 
explained yesterday that "Convergence and Union's support for 
the government requires that, in addition to the conditions of 
combating corruption -- which is a condition which the Spanish 
Socialist Workers Party sets itself and which requires 
convincing conduct by the government -- and of maintaining a 
policy which favors the productive economy, there be fulfilled 
the condition of a real impetus to autonomy, which is a matter 
of absolute priority for which I set no deadlines but which must 
not be delayed." 
  The Catalan premier gave these explanations in Tel Aviv 
during a two-day stay on the occasion of the European basketball 
final, of which he took advantage in order to maintain economic 
and political contacts. 
<H5>  Warning </H5>
  After meeting with Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhaq Rabin, 
Pujol told journalists at the Spanish Embassy that he "feels a 
need to point out" that the support for the government has been 
constant and thoroughgoing, and that an effective change has 
been achieved in economic policy, but as far as the turnaround 
in autonomy is concerned, "the results are very limited, and I 
would not like any member of the government to believe that the 
autonomy sphere is something secondary." [passage omitted]

<F P=106> [Pilar F. Canales report: "Mendez Proposes Tripartite Grand </F>
Pact"] 
  [Excerpt] Madrid -- At his first appearance before the 
Senate Labor and Social Security Committee since replacing 
Nicolas Redondo, UGT [General Workers Union] Secretary General 
Candido Mendez yesterday emphasized the need to conclude a 
tripartite grand agreement for employment, provided that the 
government reconsiders a labor reform "which is extremely 
negative, will not create employment, and will not attract 
investments." 
  He appealed to the senators "not to disappoint workers, the 
trade union movement, and the voice of the public" and to 
"desist from going ahead with the labor reform" in the form in 
which it has has been drafted, although for him the ideal thing 
would be for the the bill to be withdrawn or, at least, for its 
passage to be stopped. 
  Asked whether keeping the reform would be an insurmountable 
obstacle to securing the agreement, he stated that "it would be 
very difficult if the government's labor reform is taken to its 
logical conclusion, but we will do our best." 
  Mendez explained that he held a meeting with Workers 
Commissions Secretary General Antonio Gutierrez, and stated that 
he fully supports the proposal of a pact for employment. He 
added that before making any proposal to the government and the 
Spanish Confederation of Employers Organizations, he prefers to 
meet first with the king and with the PSV [housing cooperative] 
victims. 
<H5>  Stances </H5>
  The UGT secretary general repeated the same stances already 
set out by Nicolas Redondo -- that is: 
  Economic policy: The reform of the labor market will not in 
itself create jobs; in his opinion, a change is needed in the 
government's economic policy, envisaging "an industrial recovery 
and an improvement of infrastructures." 
  Will to negotiate: He reiterated the will to negotiate of 
the UGT, "which always has its hand outstretched to negotiate 
something fair and balanced." 
  Lack of understanding: He regretted the lack of 
understanding between the government, employers, and trade 
unions, which, in his opinion, "will create tensions in the 1994 
collective bargaining." 
  Making dismissal cheaper: Candido Mendez believes that it is 
"extremely bad" to allow "dismissals in an enterprise with 
profits, on the basis of something bad that could happen in the 
future." 
  Apprenticeship contracts: The UGT leader pointed out that 
apprenticeship contracts are being made "in breach of the law if 
training is not given by employers." 
  Trade union election rules: He denied that "minority trade 
unions will be discriminated against" under the proposed new 
trade union election rules, as the Platform for Trade Union 
Freedom is asserting. [passage omitted]

  [Excerpts] A Civil Guard was shot dead this morning in a 
terrorist attack carried out in the Valle de Trapaga near 
Bilbao. The police are looking for a woman and another two 
people who fled the scene. Felisa Aldai reports from Bilbao: 
  [Aldai] The 39-year-old civil guard, Benigno Villalobos 
Blanco, died in what appears to have been the latest attack 
carried out by the ETA [Basque Fatherland and Liberty] terrorist 
group. Benigno Lobos was leaving his home at around 0800 when, 
acording to eyewitnesses, he was shot at by two men and a woman 
who fled the scene in a Fiat car with Santander numberplates. 
[passage omitted] 
  This attack takes place only 24 days after the ETA terrorist 
group killed another civil guard in Bilbao, Fernando Jimenez 
Pascual. On this occasion the terrorist group planted a 
powerful explosive under his car. This latest attack would seem 
to point to the existence of a new reorganized ETA Vizcaya 
commando.

<F P=106> [Editorial: "The Tragedy in Gorazde"] </F>
  [Text] To abandon Gorazde and deliver the city's Muslim 
inhabitants to the mercy of the Bosnian Serbs is a moral, 
political, and military tragedy for which Europe will pay a very 
high price. So it is, and so it will be, and it is no use 
packaging this fact in realpolitik explanations. The nightmare 
in Gorazde and the humanitarian catastrophe now under way will 
haunt us far into the future. 
  The responsibility for things having come this far rests, as 
far as the latest phases of the procession of events, not least 
on Russia. As the traditional ally of the Serbs, the Russians 
insisted on playing a quite important role in solving the 
Yugoslav conflict, only to find out what has long been clear to 
all others, namely that the Bosnian Serbs are not to be counted 
upon. In the process of coming to this realization, Moscow 
protested so loudly about NATO's two bomb attacks that this was 
understood by the Serbs, correctly, as it turned out, as a 
signal that their advance could continue without risk of a 
tougher international course of action. From the United States 
have come very contradictory statements as the situation at the 
front has become worse and worse. First the government in 
Washington denied that air attacks were being contemplated in 
the discussions, then these were employed to a very limited 
extent, and then -- when they were not as effective as intended 
-- the United States failed to follow them up militarily, and 
instead offered new diplomatic initiatives. The European Union 
has confined itself to a still more threadbare declaration about 
increasing diplomatic pressure on the attacking Serbs. 
  The result is that the UN's credibility has received a 
deathblow, since it has been seen that the resolution that 
designated Gorazde and other Muslim enclaves as safe areas that 
cannot be overrun militarily has proven completely worthless. 
The line that was drawn in the sand could thus still be crossed. 
This is obviously first of all an expression of a growing 
cynicism from the Serbian side, but it is also a striking defeat 
for the world as a whole. To both present as well as potential 
despots everywhere a signal has been sent that the international 
community can be reduced to a paper tiger as long as sufficient 
determination is shown. What now? A minimum requirement must be 
that the UN's authorization be expanded so that there is no 
doubt about the international will to protect the other safe 
areas, including Tuzla, where Danish tanks are deployed. In this 
connection, happily, Prime Minister Poul Nyrup Rasmussen 
yesterday on behalf of Denmark backed the demand for an expanded 
mandate. It is apparently too late to save Gorazde from a 
horrible fate, but the humiliation ought to be used to ensure 
that no repetitions occur.

  [Excerpts] Finnish President Martti Ahtisaari has offered 
Finland as a mediator in the dispute between Russia and Estonia 
over the withdrawal of Russian troops from Estonia. Speaking on 
Wednesday [27 April], President Ahtisaari expressed the hope 
that Russia and Estonia can settle their differences on their 
own, but if their talks become deadlocked Finland could mediate 
if both sides asked for help. (?Wilf Stinger) reports: [passage 
omitted] 
  President Ahtisaari said Wednesday that he hopes that the 
two 
parties themselves can find agreement without outside help. If 
Finland were to become involved, he said, the first step would 
be to find out if there is a real chance that its efforts would 
be effective--if there's actually a solid basis for agreement. 
The president described the situation as one which would 
require the desire of both sides for the Finns to act as 
mediators, and also a desire by both sides to reach a 
settlement. President Ahtisaari also pointed out to the press 
that (?often) in international disputes the expression of the 
need for a mediator is in fact an act of faith in finding a 
settlement. The mediator is not always actually needed.

  [Text] Finland wants further clarification of Russia's 
announcement that it will close the Vaertsilae border crossing 
point for the duration of this summer. The Russian Foreign 
Ministry has announced that the border is being closed for 
construction work, which will start at the beginning of June. 
Russia estimates that the work will be completed by mid-August. 
Finland is seeking to gain further clarification about the 
closure of Vaertsilae by organizing a meeting of Finnish and 
Russian frontier delegates. 
  The Vaertsilae border crossing station near Niirala in 
northern Karelia has been kept open by mutual agreement between 
the frontier delegates. Thus far, it has not been open to 
international traffic. During Vaertsilae's closure, the Russian 
authorities recommend that goods traffic use the Uukuniemi and 
that passenger traffic use the Vartius border crossing points.

  [Text] The Interior Ministry has handed a report to 
President Martti Ahtisaari on the guarding of the frontier along 
Sweden and Norway. The issue of frontier surveillance was 
raised during Ahtisaari's state visit to Sweden. Sweden thinks 
that in the last few years Finland has militarized the 
surveillance of the western border. The Frontier Guard thinks, 
however, that the opposite is the case because Finland has 
reduced the number of frontier guards on the western border in 
the last few years.

<F P=106> [Report on interview with Lieutenant General Arne Solli, </F>
Norway's next defense chief, by Olav Trygge Storvik; place and 
date not given] 
  [Text] Lieutenant General Arne Solli, Norway's next 
defense chief, recommends Norwegian EU [European Union] 
membership. "Becoming a member of the EU would without doubt be 
advantageous to Norwegian security," Solli said in an interview 
with AFTENPOSTEN. 
  "It is true that we are members of NATO, but if we look at 
developments inside the alliance, I think it would be an 
advantage from the point of view of security to have stronger 
ties to the European pillar within NATO." 
  After a year as supreme commander in northern Norway 
Lieutenant General Arne Solli was yesterday appointed the new 
defense chief to succeed Admiral Torolf Rein. The timing of the 
government appointment came as a surprise, even though it has 
been clear for some time that Solli was a strong candidate. 
Even though the government has made the appointment now, the 
changeover will not take place until 31 October. 
  The future defense chief made it clear that he does not want 
to be used by either side in any controversial domestic 
political showdown on the EU issue. He was therefore unwilling 
to touch on all the advantages and disadvantages of Norwegian EU 
membership. On the other hand it would be remarkable if Norway's 
top professional soldier did not have views about what he thinks 
best serves Norway's security interests. 
  But if Norway does not become a member of the EU after the 
referendum? "Yes, well, then we will just have to make the best 
of the situation," Solli said. "We would still be a member of 
NATO and relations with the United States will always be 
important to us, whether or not we are a member of the EU. The 
problem is that we could be left standing outside forums where 
important decisions that will have a direct effect on us are 
reached." 
  The next defense chief said that he has held talks with U.S. 
military authorities which he described as "good" and in which 
he met with "understanding" for Norway's defense problems. "I 
think that the Americans have given us good signals recently 
that they take defense cooperation with Norway seriously. I 
take the outcome of the COB [Colocated Operating Base] 
negotiations as support for my view on this point," he said. 
  But will the United States continue to have defense 
interests 
in the northern regions now that its former rival is no more? 
"I agree that we do not need to conjure up the image of an 
opponent who no longer exists. However, neither can we ignore 
the fact that we are living in an unstable international 
situation. Changes could take place, and they could take place 
quickly. We must therefore have a potential to defend ourselves 
and bring reinforcements into the country," the future defense 
chief said. 
  He believes that EU membership will give even greater 
security. And in addition membership will open up new 
perspectives for the defense of the Nordic area. "I am thinking 
here of the longer-term perspectives which open up here if 
Sweden and Finland also join the EU," Solli said. He believes 
that in such a situation it would be logical to coordinate 
defense policy and defense plans on a Nordic basis. But here 
realizes that there is some way to go before this happens. 
"This is a nonissue today. For neither Sweden nor Finland have 
given any signals in this direction, but it could become an 
issue if all three countries become members of the EU," Solli 
said. 
  He takes the view that the country's defense chief has a 
duty 
to an play active role in providing information about the state 
of the country's defenses and about his view of current defense 
problems. He thinks that the current defense chief, Torolf Rein, 
has been good in this respect, but he expressed regrets that it 
is not always easy to attract the attention of the media despite 
the efforts made. 
  Solli believes that the defense leadership should not 
abandon 
the concept of "anti-invasion defenses" even though some people 
have urged this. "No, I think that we should keep the concept," 
he said. "It describes our capacity to meet and attack with a 
united force and with action by all three branches of the 
defense forces. The concept will continue to have validity in 
the future. We must use all the means at our disposal to try to 
make anti-invasion defenses in northern Norway a reality. The 
problem today is acquiring the money that is needed," he said.

<F P=106> [Editorial: "Whaling"] </F>
  [Text] In the run-up to the annual meeting of the 
International Whaling Commission (IWC) in less than a month's 
time the war of nerves has begun again. While the British 
Sunday newspaper, THE OBSERVER, reports that leading countries 
in the IWC -- led by the United States and Great Britain -- have 
ready a draft agreement which means that the way is being paved 
for a reintroduction of whaling quotas, it is reported from 
Washington that there is nothing to indicate that the U.S. 
Government has changed course on the whaling issue. 
  In the United States and several of the EU [European Union] 
countries public opinion has some very strong feelings against 
whaling, and it is probably less than likely that it will prove 
possible in the short term to reach agreement in the IWC on a 
resumption of commercial whaling. It looks, however, as if the 
United States is on its way toward accepting the principle of 
the scientifically based management of whale stocks. Even 
though there will still be some way to go before it is possible 
to achieve agreement on whaling quotas, a change in the U.S. 
stance represents an admission that there is a scientific 
foundation for exploiting whale stocks in some waters. This can 
quite rightly be interpreted as a decisive breakthrough for the 
arguments on which Norway has stood firm since the government 
gave the green light for 300 minke whales to be caught. 
  It is important for the future of the commission that such 
agreement on scientifically based resource management is 
achieved. If the whaling nations and the other countries in the 
IWC remain divided in the views they take on this point, there 
is a great likelihood that the IWC will split. Nations that 
have produced documentary evidence that there is a scientific 
base for whaling could resign from the organization -- and this 
would mean that the IWC would be turned into a purely 
conservationist organization.

  [Text] Swedish Defense Minister Anders Bjorck says the U.S. 
restrictions on Sweden exporting its new JAS Grippen jet fighter 
are counterproductive and could hasten the development of a 
joint European defense industry. Almost a third of the 
components of the single engined JAS are made in the United 
States, and because of this Washington requires veto rights for 
each individual export deal. Bjorck describes this as unfair 
saying Sweden cannot accept a system that puts its interests 
subordinate to those of the United States. He added that 
companies in Sweden's defense sector would look at European 
alternatives for the plane unless Washington relaxed its policy.

  [Text] Swedish Defence Minister Anders Bjoerck says this 
neutral country is likely to join NATO's Partnership for Peace 
programme next month. Bjoerck says the centre right 
government's proposal to join the programme will probably pass 
through parliament with little or no opposition. But the 
defence minister adds, joining Partnership for Peace does not 
mean Sweden is abandoning its traditional neutrality. 
  Fourteen countries--all East European states and former 
Soviet republics--have so far signed up to join the scheme. 
Another neutral Nordic country, Finland, has also said it will 
join the programme. The other three Nordic countries--Denmark, 
Norway and Iceland--are already full members of NATO.

<F P=106> [Report by Sune Olofson: "Bildt Irritated by Supreme </F>
Commander's Remarks"] 
  [Text] Prime Minister Carl Bildt has tired of Supreme 
Commander Bengt Gustafsson's repeated remarks in support of a 
Nordic military alliance. At a meeting with the press in Kalmar 
yesterday Carl Bildt called on the supreme commander to find out 
what decisions the Riksdag has come to in this respect. 
  "Military alliances are not on the agenda. This is a clear 
message to the supreme commander who should stick to the 
Riksdag's well founded decisions. The supreme commander is a 
civil servant in a sensitive field and should be aware of the 
Riksdag's decisions regarding military nonalignment," Carl Bildt 
said. 
  Bengt Gustafsson thinks that membership of the EU [European 
Union] opens up possibilities of military alliances and in the 
long term even for cooperation between the Nordic defense 
forces. Gustafsson has also pointed out that the politicians 
"are not sufficiently mature" to pursue this discussion. 
  According to information received by SVENSKA DAGBLADET, 
behind Bildt's comments there is a growing irritation in the 
Prime Minister's Office with Bengt Gustafsson's frankness which 
has not decreased as he approaches retirement. Gustafsson 
retires in June and is to be succeeded by General Owe Wiktorin. 
  "The supreme commander should not push his agenda in the 
field of security policy," said Carl Bildt's press chief, Lars 
Christiansson, who on two previous occasions has been forced to 
rebuff the supreme commander's remarks about a Nordic defense 
league. 
  Bengt Gustafsson's recurrent remarks have given rise to 
surprise at the Prime Minister's Office and at the Defense 
Ministry since the content of these initiatives is in conflict 
with Sweden's official security policy. 
  A Defense Ministry official told SVENSKA DAGBLADET that "the 
supreme commander can be seen as unpredictable, like an unsafe 
antitank rifle." 
  "The supreme commander's remarks have also given rise to 
recurrent questions and comments abroad where people have 
naturally been wondering what is happening in Sweden. It is 
regrettable that the supreme commander is continuing in the same 
vein, despite the fact that the government has corrected his 
statements in the past," Lars Christiansson pointed out. 
  Gustafsson made his latest thrust last Friday in an 
interview 
with the Finnish newspaper, HELSINGIN SANOMAT. In the past the 
supreme commander has spoken in pretty general terms about the 
importance of a joint Nordic defense alliance. This time he 
went one step further: 
  "We could begin, for example, with joint surveillance over 
the Baltic Sea and link up air surveillance systems. We would 
then be able to see together what was happening around us." 
  Bengt Gustafsson went on: 
  "Any possible new military threat would not affect only one 
or two countries in the Nordic area -- it would affect all of 
them because the Nordic area is a strategic region. We might 
just as well use taxpayers' money as efficiently as possible and 
unite our defenses." 
  In the interview Bengt Gustafsson complained about the 
immaturity of politicians and their lack of interest in Nordic 
defense cooperation. 
  However, in the past Bengt Gustafsson has received the 
support of several of the Nordic countries' generals. But 
Finland's General Gustav Hagglund -- Bengt Gustafsson's 
counterpart -- pointed out in a speech in Stockholm in December 
last year that a Nordic defense league would probably bring with 
it greater risks for Sweden, and better prospects of military 
assistance for Finland. 
  At the heart of this whole problem is what future path the 
Nordic area should follow in respect to the defense alliances of 
NATO and the WEU [Western European Union]. Officially, the EU 
[European Union] countries will discuss defense and security 
policy in 1996. Only then will the countries of the Nordic area 
-- if they are members of the EU by then -- need to make up 
their minds about the question of military alliances.

<F P=106> [Report by Thomas Michelsen: "Johansson Said Yes to the EU"] </F>
  [Text] The Center Party leadership has finally said yes to 
the EU [European Union]. With voting figures of 16 for and 2 
against, the party executive yesterday decided to urge the 
party's extraordinary congress to say yes. 
  At the same time Center Party leader Olof Johansson wants 
nothing to do with party whips. Everyone must be able to vote 
in line with the conclusions they have reached. 
  Olof Johansson has also backed away from his earlier 
position: that he, as party leader, should lead the campaign to 
promote the line adopted by the party congress. He is now 
unwilling to answer the question of what he will do if the 
Center Party's extraordinary congress says no to the EU. 
  "I do not want to speculate about what will happen if the 
congress says no. The power lies with the congress," Olof 
Johansson said. 
  He reiterated what he has been saying recently: He believes 
that things are inclining toward a yes at the Center Party 
extraordinary congress. 
  Why then has he avoided making his position clear for so 
long? 
  "This is a process. I did not want to give any indications 
until the Center Party's district meetings had reached their 
decisions. Now they have done so. I am part of a popular 
movement and reach my decisions as part of a popular movement," 
Olof Johansson said. 
  Once upon a time Olof Johansson said no to the EEC, as the 
EU 
was once called, because it was not pan-European enough. 
  "But I have undergone a change over the last 30 years, and 
Europe has too," Olof Johansson said yesterday. 
  The reason why the party executive is now saying yes is 
because it wants to be involved in influencing policy in Europe. 
But the Center Party does not agree with everything which is 
being planned in the EU. 
  "I do not believe in a common currency and central bank," 
Olof Johansson said. He does not want monetary union. And 
Sweden must not give up more self-determination than necessary. 
  Center Party deputy chairman Andreas Carlgren said that the 
Center Party is a broad church. "We are able to show that we 
have divergent views of the question," said Carlgren, who thinks 
that the Center Party has handled the EU question more 
democratically than other parties.

  [Text] Spain and Sweden have called on other countries to 
contribute more UN troops to Bosnia. The call came during the 
visit of Spanish Foreign Minister Javier Solana Madariaga to 
Sweden. 
  The two countries have sent around 1,200 troops each to the 
UN protection forces in Bosnia. Solana Madariaga and Swedish 
Foreign Minister Margaretha af Ugglas say a sizeable UN presence 
is necessary in the former Yugoslavia to avoid a spread of 
hostilities.

  [Excerpt] [passage omitted] Following his two and 
one-half hour meeting with UN special envoy Joe Clark today, 
President Rauf Denktas told journalists: We are discussing the 
issues you know about. The point is that either the amended 
document should be restored to its original form or certain 
elements that we consider satisfactory should be added to it. 
Denktas said that after his meeting with Kliridhis tomorrow, 
Clark will probably bring certain answers to the Turkish Cypriot 
side. Asked if elements satisfactory to the Turkish Cypriots 
will be added to the package, Denktas said: I do not know. We 
will see tomorrow. 
  Denktas pointed out that the UN officials are insisting on 
their proposals while the Turkish Cypriots are insisting on 
their own views. He stressed that the Turkish Cypriot side made 
certain flexible proposals during the talks and will wait for 
the results. 
  Replying to another question, Denktas said the element of 
time is still being stressed in the talks. He said: According 
to the UN officials, tomorrow is the last day, but if they see 
any encouraging signs, they will probably stay another couple of 
days.

<F P=106> ["Text" of "exclusive" interview with Turkish Cypriot leader </F>
Rauf Denktas by Mehmet Ali Akpinar, general director of 
publications of KIBRIS, in Nicosia; date not given] 
  [Text] [Akpinar] Can a solution be imposed against your 
will and the free will of the Turkish Cypriot people? Can you 
comment on the consequences of the effort to impose a solution 
on Cyprus? 
  [Denktas] My will depends on how I can successfully 
represent 
the Turkish Cypriot people. I am trying to conclude an 
agreement that will be acceptable to my people. The Republican 
Assembly will endorse the agreement that is made. Meanwhile, we 
will have to hold a referendum in accordance with our 
Constitution. That is because the matter concerns the question 
of territory. So, what do those who put pressure on me to say 
yes to this or that stand to gain from something that is imposed 
on me in one way or another if I fail to have it endorsed by the 
Republican Assembly and if I lose in the referendum? In that 
case, I will have to disappear. Therefore, those who are 
convinced that they can conclude an agreement that conflicts 
with the Turkish Cypriot people's will are mistaken. That 
cannot be done. 
  [Akpinar] What do you mean by saying that you will have to 
disappear? 
  [Denktas] I would have to withdraw. If my people do not 
support the agreement I conclude, then I would be forced to 
disappear from the scene. That would mean that I have been 
unsuccessful in representing their will. That is why I wish to 
inform the people that that is what I have given, this is what 
we have gotten in return, it is substantial, and it belongs to 
us. However, they [UN officials] have failed to give a tangible 
form to what will be given to us until now. They have failed to 
include what we will receive in the package. They have said: 
"Sign and then we will see what can be done." They have made a 
promise that they "will give." How can that be? 
  [Akpinar] Statements have been made to the effect that 
Turkey 
is the country that has suffered most from the no-solution 
situation. Can you comment on them? 
  [Denktas] That is a matter of how one looks at the problem. 
It is a fact that the Cyprus problem has constantly gotten in 
the way Turkey's contacts with foreign countries. That is why 
Turkey sincerely wants to have the problem solved, that is, in 
an honorable way. It wants the security of the Turkish Cypriots 
to be guaranteed. It also wants the concessions to be 
reciprocal. We have moved together with Turkey on those matters 
so far. I believe that there has not been a change in that 
regard. 
  [Akpinar] Prime Minister Tansu Ciller has said: "We are 
determined to have the Cyprus problem solved and we stand to 
gain most from the solution of that problem." Would a hasty 
solution on the basis of territorial concessions, that is, as in 
the case of Maras, create a problem that will force the Turkish 
Cypriots to make additional concessions on the territorial issue 
in the future? 
  [Denktas] Naturally, it will. We have to foil the designs 
that are against us in the talks. For example, I wish to recall 
a design related to the documents and maps that were submitted 
as non-documents and non-maps. We were asked to agree to 
discuss them. Later, however, they were suddenly changed against 
us and described as the "UN secretary general's proposals." 
They were then submitted to the UN Security Council to be 
approved. That is the trick that has to be blocked. The 
Turkish Cypriot people must not be a part in it. Nor should 
Turkey be involved in such an approach. Otherwise, we do not 
stand to gain anything. 
  [Akpinar] How would you define an honorable, just, and 
durable solution to the problem? 
  [Denktas] An honorable, just, and durable solution must 
provide for a bizonal agreement. It must definitely be a 
balanced solution, which will provide for political equality and 
sovereignty rights for the two sides. We can build upon those 
principles, provided they are accepted. If any one of the 
concepts of equality, right to sovereignty, balance, and the 
maintenance of Turkey's effective guarantee is put aside or 
weakened, then the matter will end right there and then. The 
Greek Cypriot side's objective is to either remove or 
effectively weaken all those concepts by quickly joining the 
European Union. They are clearly moving to achieve that plan. 
We have to say something against that. We have to declare that 
we will break off the talks if the Greek Cypriots pursue that 
plan and if the inclination to allow Cyprus to become a member 
of the European Union in the light of the conviction that the 
Greek Cypriots represent the Cyprus Government is maintained. 
That is the point we have arrived at. The pressure that has 
been directed at us is forcing us to take further steps. It is 
time to show that we will not yield to pressure.

  [Text] Central Bank Governor Avxendis Avxendiou 
categorically rejected a report in a French magazine that Cyprus 
is a transfer point of dirty money. Avxendiou stressed that the 
banking system in Cyprus is clean. Correspondent Petros 
Konstandinou has the following report: 
  [Begin recording] [Konstandinou] Cyprus' banking system has 
become a target in the foreign press. A report in the French 
magazine L'EXPRESS represents Cyprus as a transfer point for 
dirty money. Central Bank Governor Avxendiou categorically 
rejected the report and added that it is not the first time that 
something like this has happened. 
  [Avxendiou] I cannot rule out that there are isolated cases, 
but I reject the possibility and the claim that Cyprus is a 
point of systematic laundering of dirty money. 
  [Konstandinou] Have there even been isolated cases of which 
you are aware? 
  [Avxendiou] No, not even one case has come to our attention 
because if we become aware of something like this, you realize 
that the measures that we would take would be really drastic. 
  [Konstandinou] In order to safeguard the banking system, 
Avxendiou said, there is continuous and systematic control of 
both Cypriot and foreign banks. All officials of all banks, he 
said, have been given strict instructions to be very careful in 
their dealings. The banks have also been instructed not to open 
an account for anyone unless they first prove their identity.

<F P=106> [Column by Ertugrul Ozkok: "Help Me Resolve the Cyprus </F>
Problem"--punctuation as published] 
  [Text] Prime Minister Ciller will deliver a very important 
speech during the meeting the True Path Party [TPP] 
parliamentary group will hold tomorrow. During the speech, she 
will detail for the first time her clear and resolute approach 
to a solution of the Cyprus problem. 
  Some 48 hours before her historic speech to the TPP 
parliamentary group, Ciller made a statement that may have a 
bearing on the meeting the parliament will hold on the Cyprus 
problem. Ciller expressed her views as directly as possible: 
"Several circles are making charges about the Cyprus problem. 
However, that is a wrong approach." 
  She then continued with her important remarks. 
<H5>  Heroic Statements </H5>
  "We have had to deal with that problem for 20 years. It has 
confronted us as an obstacle everywhere and at every 
opportunity. Turkey is the country that has suffered most from 
the state of no solution." 
  Ciller said that she is determined to solve the problem. In 
fact, she said so in a very clear way: "I am determined to move 
toward a solution. I shall outline all that when I address the 
parliament on Tuesday." 
  In her following statement, Ciller seemed to declare war on 
everyone who has obstructed a solution to the problem. She 
said: "I have studied past developments. Someone always did 
something to obstruct a solution to the problem when a 
settlement was close. Claims are being made that I promised 
Clinton that I would make a concession. I have not bargained 
with Clinton on anything. I have not made a concession in 
return for an economic aid package." 
  Ciller made a prediction on the parliament's meeting 
tomorrow. She said: "I am aware that they [the deputies] will 
make heroic speeches tomorrow. However, I am determined this 
time." 
  What does the Foreign Ministry contemplate on the matter? 
Ciller said that she had a telephone conversation with Foreign 
Minister Hikmet Cetin yesterday morning. The parliament's 
meeting tomorrow was the only subject they discussed. 
<H5>  The Foreign Ministry Convinced Me </H5>
  What is Hikmet Cetin's opinion on the matter? Prime Minister 
Ciller said: "I explained all that to Hikmet Cetin in the 
morning. He maintained similar views. In fact, the Foreign 
Ministry has convinced me. I held talks with Ambassador Inal 
Batu in New York and Ambassador Nuzhet Kandemir in Washington. 
That is how I made up my mind. On no other matter have I 
agreed with the Foreign Ministry as much as I have agreed with 
it on this problem." 
  Ciller appealed to the people for a solution to the Cyprus 
problem. She also gave a guarantee. She said: "Come, let us 
resolve that problem. Let us remove the great obstacle against 
Turkey. Turkey is the country that stands to gain most from the 
solution to that problem. The solution of the Cyprus problem is 
in the interest of Turkey and the Turkish Cypriots. As the 
prime minister, I promise that I will safeguard the rights of 
the Turkish Cypriots." 
  Concluding, Ciller reiterated: "We are closer to a solution 
than we have ever been before. It will be a pity if we waste 
that opportunity and fail to resolve the problem. In view of 
that, I appeal for the support of the people and the parliament." 
  Ciller is the fifth prime minister I have talked with on the 
Cyprus problem since I have been a journalist. It was the first 
time I observed a Turkish prime minister maintain such a 
determined approach on the Cyprus problem. 
  Former President Turgut Ozal expressed similar views in the 
past. However, his comments were made off the record. His views 
on the solution of the Cyprus problem were almost similar. He 
stressed that there was a good opportunity for the settlement of 
the problem after the Gulf War. 
<H5>  The No-Solution Lobby </H5>
  However, Ozal was confronted with a very strong opposition. 
Everyone is aware of the existence of an "antisolution" lobby in 
Turkey. In view of that, I believe that Ciller's speech will be 
confronted with a strong resistance in the parliament tomorrow. 
  However, the initiation for a realistic and calm process to 
achieve a solution to the Cyprus problem will be useful. It is 
common knowledge that Turkey is frequently confronted with that 
problem. So, Turkey has to make a realistic assessment of 
several of its problems. The Cyprus problem has become a 
serious factor that obstructs Turkey's important foreign 
relations and its effort to integrate with Europe. 
  Meanwhile, the effects of the developments in southeastern 
Turkey on the significant economic crisis in the country must 
not be underestimated. 
  Bringing all this to light may be embarrassing to many 
officials. We may even say that we are prepared to give up many 
things just for the sake of maintaining these problems. 
<H5>  I Support Ciller </H5>
  However, we are living in a realistic world. We have 
observed the effects of the economic crisis on our daily lives. 
Many of us may not be able to visualize the cost we may have to 
pay in the near future. Nevertheless, the social wounds and 
problems that will be created when thousands of people lose 
their jobs have to be considered beforehand. In view of that, I 
support Prime Minister Ciller's determination to solve the 
Cyprus problem. Although I have criticized her on many other 
issues, I wish to clearly stress that I agree with her on that 
problem.

  [Text] Prosperity Party [PP] leader Necmettin Erbakan has 
said that his party does not consider negotiations on the Cyprus 
issue necessary. If negotiations must be held, he said, they 
must be held only after the existence of two communities having 
equal rights is accepted. 
  Addressing PP deputies today, Erbakan said that the first 
thing to do is to strengthen the Turkish Republic of Northern 
Cyprus [TRNC] and to ensure that it is recognized. From the 
beginning, he said, we have been calling for the existence of 
two independent separate states on the island. 
  [Begin Erbakan recording] Everybody knows that we never 
cared for these negotiations from the beginning. We have only 
one problem in Cyprus and it is to ensure that the TRNC is 
recognized first by the Muslim countries and then by the entire 
world, then to help strengthen the TRNC and increase its 
prosperity. That is our only Cyprus problem. [end recording] 
  Erbakan said that if negotiations must be held, they must be 
held only after the equality of the two communities is accepted. 
The issues can be discussed separately in the negotiations, he 
said. 
  The PP leader pointed out that the United Nations has been 
defending the same principles for the past 15 years, but that 
since Butrus-Ghali became secretary general, the UN started to 
ask for concessions. Erbakan stressed that the Turkish Grand 
National Assembly rejected this stand both on 10 June and with 
its resolution yesterday. 
  On the economy, Erbakan said that inflation and foreign debt 
will increase fast and the growth rate drop. He said that for a 
solution either early elections or a new coalition is necessary.

  [Text] The Turkish Grand National Assembly [TGNA] has 
stated that the Turkish nation will by no means approve of a 
solution unacceptable to the Turkish Cypriot people. The 
political parties represented at the TGNA issued a joint 
communique on the Cyprus issue and addressed to the nations of 
the world. 
  The communique read by the TGNA deputy speaker Yasin 
Hatipoglu confirms that the TGNA endorses the Turkish Cypriot 
people's 30-year-old just and legal struggle for their basic 
sovereignty, security, and equality. The statement points out 
that a just, realistic, and permanent solution to the Cyprus 
issue can only be achieved by the free will of the two people on 
the island. The statement notes that a return to the pre-1974 
conditions is inconceivable and stresses that a solution 
unacceptable to the Turkish Cypriot people will not be approved 
by the Turkish nation. 
  The statement notes: The TGNA announces that Turkey is 
determined to fulfill its duties and responsibilities as 
stipulated by agreements -- that of a guarantor. The communique 
notes that the negotiations can continue under the basic 
condition that there are two equal communities with equal rights 
in Cyprus. The statement indicates that a solution to the 
Cyprus issue can be achieved if the issue is discussed in all 
its entirety, by holding free negotiations between 
representatives of the two communities, and without any external 
intervention. The statement further notes that an agreement 
attained by means of negotiations can be valid only after both 
communities give their approval. 
  The statement further expresses appreciation of President 
Rauf Denktas' efforts toward peace. 
  The conclusion of the communique expresses the following 
views: 
  [Begin Hatipoglu recording] The TGNA announces that Turkey 
endorses the Turkish Cypriot cause with determination and that 
it will extend assistance to the TRNC in all areas. On this 
occasion, we would like to express once more the Turkish 
people's determination in fulfilling its responsibilities. [end

<F P=106> [Column by Ferai Tinc: "Clinton Should Not Have Met </F>
Papandreou" -- punctuation as published] 
  [Text] President Clinton's decision to meet Greek Prime 
Minister Andreas Papandreou was a tactical error. His talks 
with Papandreou in the White House when the Serbs were 
threatening to massacre 65,000 people in Gorazde and reject the 
warnings that have been made to them has weakened not only the 
U.S. approach on the developments in Bosnia but also the policy 
of all the allies. 
  In an article in THE NEW YORK TIMES, Robert Kaplan, who is 
the author of "Balkan Ghosts," said that Clinton has sent the 
wrong message to the Serbs by receiving Papandreou. He also 
recalled the developments that preceded the Gulf War. It will 
be recalled that the U.S. ambassador to Iraq held talks with 
Saddam Husayn and conveyed the wrong message to him prior to the 
war. Saddam Husayn was convinced that the United States 
approved his intention to occupy Kuwait. 
  It has been 15 days since NATO's first operation over 
Gorazde, which was unsuccessful. The second operation last week 
was even worse. Consequently, the Serbs began to play with the 
residents of Gorazde, just like a cat plays with a mouse. 
  Let us consider the developments that took place during the 
past week. The UN officials convened with great difficulty 
after the UN organization was insulted and described as "a 
useless organization" by everyone. The NATO officials met the 
next day. The only specific decision that was adopted was that 
an operation against the Serbs would not be launched before 
Russia was consulted. 
  The Serbs shrugged at NATO's ultimatum at the moment it was 
conveyed to them. 
  The weak political will in the two organizations is the main 
reason for the failure to implement NATO's decisions. Halting 
the Serbs by bombing one or two of their positions as a warning 
is impossible. However, it must be noted that the NATO 
countries are required to provide additional aircraft and troops 
for an extensive operation. Meanwhile, a need may arise for an 
extensive ground operation. However, no one is prepared for 
that. Obviously, the international community is helpless 
against the Serbs. 
  Under the circumstances, Russia and Greece are doing 
everything they can to further weaken the international 
alliance, which is already fragile. 
  Papandreou is the only leader who opposed NATO's ultimatum 
on 
Sarajevo. He is also the leader who has violated the 
international embargo on former Yugoslavia most by maintaining 
the supply of fuel and other commodities to Serbia. Considering 
that, Clinton's decision to hold talks with Papandreou on the 
question of the Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia when a 
resolute stand is required against the Serbs was a very wrong 
approach. 
  Clinton's talks with Papandreou on the Cyprus problem were 
even more meaningless. 
  Is it not possible to inform those who ask Ankara to make 
concessions so that they can encourage a reconciliation between 
Turkey and Greece to regard Greece's approach on Bosnia and the 
Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia as an example? As far as 
talks with that country are concerned, Turkey has its own 
conditions.

  [Text] Ankara, April 27 (A.A.) -- Foreign Ministry 
spokesman Ferhat Ataman said on Wednesday [27 April] that claims 
that the United States threatened Turkey on Turkish-Iraqi oil 
pipeline were false. 
  `Threats and blackmail cannot take place between two allies 
who have deep friendly relations,' Ataman said. 
  Speaking at a weekly news conference Ataman recalled Prime 
Minister Tansu Ciller's words as saying Turkey has incurred a 
loss of 20 billion U.S. dollars because of the Gulf crisis. 
  `This loss continues to gradually grow,' he said. 
  Ataman said there is no difference of opinion that the 
Turkish-Iraqi pipeline should be rescued as this important 
pipeline remained idle there. 
  `The problem is how this rescue will take place within the 
United Nations system,' he said. 
  He said Turkey worked on several alternatives to rescue the 
pipeline. 
  `We will continue our discussions with Iraq and our 
coalition 
partners on the issue,' he said. 
  Ataman said Turkey's aim is to rescue the pipeline within 
the 
framework of existing principles and a technical operation. 
  `We have no intention to circumvent the embargo,' he said.

  [Text] Ankara--Turkish troops that have been in northern 
Iraq since last Tuesday [26 April] have reportedly started to 
establish a buffer zone on the border to cut off logistic 
supplies to Kurdish separatists. 
  Prime Minister Tansu Ciller said Tuesday that a massive 
operation against the outlawed Kurdistan Workers' Party (PKK) 
was continuing in the region, and made "a final appeal" to 
separatist militants to surrender before the summer. "Our state 
will embrace anyone who surrenders," Ciller said, as local 
sources in the southeast reported an immense troop deployment to 
the region and a buildup of Turkish forces on the Iraqi border. 
  Sources said Tuesday that there was a heavy bombardment of 
separatist targets in the Shiva and Haftanin regions of northern 
Iraq and that a land operation was continuing near Sinah. A 
major deployment of Turkish troops was also observed in the 
vicinity of Kani Masi, an area previously cleared by warplanes 
and helicopter gunships. An unofficial Turkish military 
headquarters was established in Kani Masi on Monday, and 
helicopters were ferrying in new troops the following day. One 
unconfirmed report had it that Turkish troops had also crossed 
into northern Iraq near the Iranian border and were accompanied 
by peshmerges of Mas'ud Barzani's Kurdistan Democrat Party (KDP). 
  Operations in Turkey also continued, with new vehicles and 
troops arriving in the border region and land and air operations 
continuing on Gabar mountain. Local sources said villages on 
Gabar and Mt. Cudi had been evacuated and that the civilians had 
fled either to Kumcati or northern Iraq. 
  Addressing her ruling True Path Party (DYP) group meeting on 
Tuesday, Ciller implied that the Turkish campaign would gain 
momentum by this summer and defined the struggle against 
terrorism as "Turkey's most important problem." 
  She denied separatist claims that Turkey mistreated those 
who 
surrendered and said: "Come and surrender before it's too late. 
Your end should not come in sorrow. Come and let us enjoy the 
resources of this country together." 
  Her statement came a day after a senior PKK leader claimed 
that Turkey aimed at creating a permanent security zone within 
Iraq and official sources in Ankara said that the Turkish 
presence in the region would last throughout the summer. In an 
interview he gave to the PKK-affiliated Kurd-A news agency on 
Monday, Military Council commander Cemil Bayik (Cuma) claimed 
that Turkey wanted to occupy part of the region. 
  He alleged that troops would be advancing southwards in the 
coming days and suggested troops might even reach Zakho and 
Dahuk. Bayil also described the operation as more important than 
Turkey's incursion into Iraq in 1992 and said that this time 
Turkey intended to stay put. 
  Local sources claimed on Monday that Turkish tanks moving 
out 
of the Zap region of Turkey's Hakkari Province had moved into 
Iraq and had reached Kani Masi via a mountain road. Turkish 
commandos, supported by warplanes and military helicopters, 
entered the region last week and local sources have put the 
total number of troops currently in northern Iraq at around 
5,000. 
  Witnesses said hundreds of paramilitary village guards were 
assisting the troops. As part of the operation on Gabar 
Mountain, troops have seized nine mortars, seven anti-aircraft 
guns, three rocket launchers, 61 assault rifles, 70 
anti-personnel mines, 98 grenades and approximately 170,000 
rounds of ammunition, in one week. 
  Turkey recently deployed around 100,000 fresh troops to the 
Southeast and has a total of approximately 400,000 security 
personnel, including soldiers, policemen, intelligence officers 
and village guards, to fight the separatists in the region. PKK 
leader Abdullah Ocalan said earlier that this was "the final 
conflict" between his organization and Turkey, warning all 
militants to be prepared for a massive crackdown.

  [Text] Ankara, April 27 (A.A.) -- A section of the high 
tension lines that supply electricity to the Kurds of Northern 
Iraq as part of the humanitarian aid from Turkey was bombed and 
destroyed by terrorists. 
  Foreign Ministry spokesman Ferhat Ataman told a weekly press 
conference today that the separatist terrorist organization PKK 
[Workers Party of Kurdistan] had destroyed the Silopi-Zakho part 
of the line for the second time Sunday [24 April]. 
  After destroying the line, the terrorists also set landmines 
in the region to prevent teams from repairing the line. 
  `This action against the people of Northern Iraq, should be 
a 
regrettable incident which should teach everyone a lesson,' 
Ataman said. 
  Ataman added that the line would be repaired at the soonest, 
to supply power to the people Northern Iraqis, as part of 
Turkey's humanitarian assistance to those people. 
  Ataman went on to say that ambassadors from 16 countries 
were 
called to Ankara for an evaluation meeting which will take place 
on May 4. 
  The meeting will review Turkey's relations with the West 
from 
the point-of-view of security and politics. 
  Ataman said that Turkey was placing intensive emphasis on 
the 
Iranians who were wounded during Turkey's cross-border operation 
on the terrorist camp near Zhala which is on the Iran/Iraq 
border. 
  He added that the compensation claims of Iran were under 
evaluation.

  [Text] Ankara--Diplomatic traffic is increasing between 
Iran and Turkey due to a recently established climate of close 
cooperation in economic, political and security spheres. 
Iranian First Deputy Foreign Minister Mohammad Hashemi, Iranian 
President Hashemi-Rafsanjani's brother and former head of 
Iranian radio and television, is expected to visit Turkey on May 
2, diplomatic sources told TURKISH DAILY NEWS [TDN]. 
  "Economic and political issues will be discussed by Turkish 
officials during this visit. Hashemi will hold a meeting with 
Turkish Foreign Ministry Under Secretary Ozdem Sanberk and is 
expected to be received by Foreign Minister Hikmet Cetin and 
President Suleyman Demirel," a high-ranking Iranian official 
told TDN. 
  Hashemi will outline the Iranian government's views on 
latest 
developments in the region and the world, the same source said. 
"The Karabakh question, the Bosnia problem and the issue of 
northern Iraq will be the main topics of the consultations. The 
views of the Turkish and Iranian governments are quite similar 
on these subjects. The question for the two friendly countries 
is how to act together to solve these problems. Economic issues 
will also be discussed by Turkish and Iranian officials. There 
is a political will to accelerate economic relations between the 
two countries," he disclosed. 
  Iran has recently launched a new liberalization project, 
designed by President Hashemi-Rafsanjani, that aims to create a 
powerful economic system, which will integrate Iran into the 
global economic system. Hashemi-Rafsanjani is proposing a 
privatization campaign for state-owned enterprises, to lift 
government subsidies, to develop Iran's resources other than 
crude oil, to encourage exporters and lessen the Iranian 
economy's dependence on oil revenues. 
  Meanwhile, a Turkish delegation, comprising Eximbank, 
Treasury and State Pipeline company (BOTAS) officials, will 
visit Iran in early May. 
  During the visit, Turkish and Iranian officials will discuss 
the natural gas pipeline project, which there are plans to 
extend to Europe via Turkey. Iran, which ranks second in the 
world in terms of natural gas resources, is attaching great 
importance to this project since its oil export revenues are 
declining due to low world market prices. Turkey is also trying 
to break its dependence on natural gas imports from the Russian 
Federation. 
  Turkey has taken an extremely positive stance toward this 
project. "We want to realize it as soon as possible," Hayrettin 
Uzun, general director of BOTAS, told TDN. 
  The delegation will determine the conditions of the purchase 
by Turkey of 3 million barrels of crude oil from Iran. This 
deal was decided on at the Turkey-Iran Joint Economic Commission 
meeting in Tehran in February. 
  The talks will also focus on the economic difficulties 
facing 
both countries. Iran, which is trying to reschedule its foreign 
debts to Western countries, is expected to propose repaying its 
$70 million debt to Turkey in cash instead of with crude oil, 
despite its shortage of foreign currency. Turkish and Iranian 
officials will discuss how to develop the two countries' 
secondary resources with the aim of increasing their revenues. 
Economic relations and opportunities for cooperation with the 
Central Asian republics will be two of the main items discussed 
during the talks. 
<H5>  Security Talks </H5>
  Meanwhile, the eighth Turkey-Iran Joint Security Committee 
meeting is continuing in Tehran, having begun on Monday. 
Interior Ministry Deputy Undersecretary Muharrem Goktayoglu is 
attending the meeting, as the head of the Turkish delegation. 
Decisions reached in previous security meetings and the 
activities of the subcommittees are among the topics being 
debated. 
  The committee is working on developing new policies to be 
implemented in the future. 
  The Joint Security Committee was established by a security 
agreement signed in 1992 in Tehran. According to this 
agreement, Iran has been handing over members of the outlawed 
Kurdistan Workers' Party (PKK) to Turkey. 
  The security agreement foresees the type of cooperation 
between Turkey and Iran that will lead these countries to 
handing over individuals who are suspected of perpetrating acts 
against either country. Within the framework of this agreement, 
joint security committees and subcommittees hold periodic 
meetings to discuss latest security developments.

Bosnia-Herzegovina Contact Group with the UN secretary general 
and the Security Council.

Bosnia-Herzegovina. We will explain that we are determined to 
make the necessary efforts to this end. We will then meet with 
the Security Council members. Then we will meet with the UN

<F P=106> ["Commentary" by Yalcin Ozer: "Ciller's Political Angle Is </F>
Being Restricted"] 
  [Excerpt] With the prime minister's return from her U.S. 
visit the issue of a cabinet reshuffle has been included on the 
agenda. The public is expecting a reshuffle and a restructuring 
within the cabinet. 
  While the public expects a reshuffle the leaders of the 
coalition partners have other problems to tackle.... Let us 
begin with Ciller. 
  Ciller is struggling against a secret "Demirel opposition" 
within the TPP [True Path Party]. This opposition, which was 
working against the TPP during the local election campaign, 
supported the ANAP [Motherland Party] candidates in important 
centers such as Istanbul and Bursa. 
  The aim was to prepare a great election defeat for Ciller 
thus ousting her from the party. The election results, however, 
did not please the opposition. 
  This opposition, which retreated a bit given the election 
results, has bounced back since then.... There has been no 
change in either goal or calculation. There has only been a 
slight delay and postponement. That is all.... 
  Ciller does not have many trump cards against the opposition 
because the TPP has a weak majority in the Assembly anyway. As 
for the TPP electorate, it is not ready for such a struggle.... 
Furthermore, the opposition is led by the president (in other 
words Demirel).... Therefore, Ciller, whether she wants it or 
not, has to maintain harmonious relations with Demirel.... 
  The main characteristics of this opposition are the 
following; 
  The first is staffing... They want the best state cadres to 
be at their disposal. Their complaints to the president are 
based on the principle that "she is isolating and antagonizing 
our senior colleagues"... Whatever the conditions, they want 
the state to increase employment and they want to be in charge 
of appointing personnel to the newly created cadres. 
  Secondly, this opposition is against the economic stability 
measures. Many among them believe that the Ozal Model is 
responsible for the current crisis and that, therefore, if this 
model is abandoned the economy will automatically heal 
itself.... Almost all within this opposition, and especially 
[Assembly Speaker] Cindoruk, are against the closing down or 
liquidation of the State Economic Enterprises that are in the 
red. One will recall that in the past Demirel has also said 
that the duty of the state was not to close down these 
enterprises and lay off workers but to find a solution, though 
he did not specify what this solution should be. 
  These conditions are, in a way, putting Ciller in a 
difficult 
position. The prime minister has, thus far, not been able to 
form a good team around herself. People like Esat Kiratlioglu 
and Necmettin Cevheri, though they are very valuable on an 
individual basis, cannot contribute much to the masses. If one 
removes Yildirim Aktuna from the picture, there will be no one 
else left.... Ciller should speedily surround herself with 
charismatic cadres like Aktuna but who are also experienced and 
youthful.... [passage omitted]

<F P=106> [Report by Yavuz Baydar] </F>
  [Text] Ankara--The Turkish press and media, hit hard by the 
escalating economic crisis, continue to sack hundreds of 
journalists without any advance warning. 
  Reports from media circles say that at least 2,000 
journalists, reporters and other workers involved in the media 
have lost their jobs in the course of the last two weeks, as a 
result of attempts by leading media companies to reduce the size 
of their workforce. 
  The reason for this "shrinking campaign" is reported to be 
the increasing price of paper, higher production costs and the 
dramatic decrease in advertising, caused by the economic turmoil 
in Turkey. Most leading newspapers are now published with fewer 
pages than before. 
  Also, the new Radio-TV Bill, which strictly limits the 
number 
of commercials and obliges the media to respect copyright, has 
provoked a feeling of concern about the future among media 
moguls. 
<H5>  Chain of Sackings </H5>
  TGRT-TV and TURKIYE daily, owned by the IHLAS group, have so 
far sacked at least 700 journalists. Some of them were 
reportedly asked to provide technical and economic services, a 
proposal which they rejected. 
  ATV and SABAH daily have by now dismissed at least 500 
people. Sources within SABAH say the newspaper is facing the 
worst crisis ever, and that a new wave of redundancies seem 
inevitable. "Almost half of the 3,000 people employed risk 
losing their jobs at the moment," one source said. 
  Among the journalists who lost their jobs recently are Refik 
Durbas, coordinator of the arts page, and Sebnem Senyener, New 
York correspondent. 
  The other two newspaper giants, HURRIYET and MILLIYET, have 
also sacked a proportion of their staff. It is reported that a 
total of 700 people have been forced to go. 
  Kanal D, a private TV channel owned jointly by 
MILLIYET-owner 
Aydin Dogan and the DOGUS group, is confronted with a crisis as 
well. It is reported that workers' wages have been frozen and 
recruitments suspended. 
  Kanal 6, a private TV channel owned by Ahmet Ozal, sacked 
last week 241 of its personnel in the Programming, Advertising, 
and Technical Departments. Kanal 6 is reported to have huge 
debts, and CUMHURIYET daily reported last Sunday that it was on 
sale. There seems to be a great deal of turbulence within the 
semi-official ANATOLIA news agency as well. They are reported 
to have sacked between 57 and 300 journalists. 
<H5>  Political Interference </H5>
  With the increasing anxiety in the ANATOLIA news agency, two 
journalists are said to have been sacked by "order of the prime 
minister," following their articles on the economic austerity 
package, reported CUMHURIYET newspaper on Tuesday. 
  Emine Cal and Fatma Orhan Coskunoglu are reported to have 
been pressured by Mehmet Bican, a member of ANATOLIA's 
administrative board and the prime minister's press adviser, to 
disclose their sources of information. When the reporters 
refused to do so, Bican asked the board to dismiss them, saying, 
"It is the wish of the prime minister." ANATOLIA fired them on 
the grounds that "their articles were causing trouble for the 
agency." 
<H5>  High Fines for InterStar TV </H5>
  Cem Uzan, owner of the private TV channel 
InterStar,--together with two TV presenters and five 
high-ranking executives of InterStar--was fined a total of TL 2 
billion, on the grounds that the party propaganda and insults 
broadcast on the television channel had been a breach of the 
Election Law.

  [Text] Government Spokesman Evangelos Venizelos said the 
Albanian Government's decision not to reduce the number of 
staffers at the Greek Embassy in Tirana is considered to be a 
positive development. For this reason, he added, the Greek 
Government did not make a corresponding reduction of Albanian 
diplomatic personnel in Athens. The spokesman made this 
statement in response to a question on the status of relations 
between Greece and Albania before the meeting between the 
foreign ministers of the two countries, Karolos Papoulias and 
Alfred Serreqi, on 3 May in Geneva. 
  Venizelos also referred to the recent statements by Albanian 
officials, which have contributed to the artificial tension. We 
do not pay attention to these statements, he said, because we 
wish for the improvement of Greek-Albanian relations; we are a 
country that accepts a large number of Albanians who, either 
legally or illegally, work in our country; and we feel our 
responsibility as a country trying to achieve stability in the 
Balkans. 
  Finally, the government spokesman said that respect for 
international law and the rights of the [Greek] minority in 
Albania does not depend on the meeting between Papoulias and 
Serreqi, and its outcome.

  [Text] Government Spokesman Evangelos Venizelos today said 
that the letter from the Albanian permanent representative to 
the United Nations Security Council is vague and unfounded. 
  Venizelos said that this letter reminds him of the letter 
from Albanian Foreign Minister Alfred Serreqi that asked the 
United Nations to condemn Greece as a terrorist state because of 
the incident at Ano Episkopi and its friendship with the Serbs. 
  The spokesman added that, in view of the 3 May meeting in 
Zurich between Greek Foreign Minister Karolos Papoulias and 
Serreqi, the Greek Government wants to be cautious about its 
statements since Greek positions are understood by the 
international community.

  [Text] Government Spokesman Evangelos Venizelos said that a 
firm goal of Greek foreign policy is to improve Greek-Turkish 
relations. However, this improvement inevitably depends on the 
Cyprus issue, he stressed. 
  If [Turkish Prime Minister] Mrs. Ciller wants to assume 
initiatives regarding the Cyprus issue, she should realize that 
the issue is a problem of invasion and occupation of a large 
part of the island by Turkish forces. The Turkish and Turkish 
Cypriot sides should therefore show good intentions, he said. 
These intentions, the spokesman concluded, should be associated 
with both the confidence-building measures and the substance of 
the Cyprus issue.

<F P=106> [Ylva Nilsson report: "Charm Offensive Had the Desired </F>
Effect"] 
  [Excerpt] The charm which Prime Ministers Carl Bildt and 
Gro Harlem Brundtland turned on during Tuesday's [19 April] 
visit to the European Parliament [EP] -- or perhaps the 
intellectual strength of Jacques Delors -- seems to have done 
the trick. According to a straw poll, there are now at least 
280 -- perhaps as many as 310 -- certain "yes" votes (of the 
necessary 260) in the European Parliament in favor of new EU 
[European Union] members, and it is as good as certain that the 
Parliament really will vote on the issue in May. 
  A major uncertainty factor in the tough timetable necessary 
to bring Sweden into the EU in 1995 now seems to have been 
removed. After the Tuesday and Wednesday meetings and debates at 
the European Parliament, it is as good as certain that the 
Swedish, Norwegian, Finnish, and Austrian membership agreements 
will be added to the agenda and voted on in May. The Christian 
Democrats -- the Parliament's second biggest party -- decided 
Tuesday evening that the issue should be raised for discussion 
in May. The socialists did not hold their meeting until 
Wednesday evening but earlier that day their group leader, 
Jean-Pierre Cot, estimated that at least 130 of the almost 200 
socialist deputies were in favor of raising the matter for 
discussion in May. 
  It is true that there are no guarantees that there will be a 
sufficient number of "yes" votes in support of enlargement (at 
least 260 out of a total of 518) when the matter is voted on, 
but the party groupings' latest straw poll says that there are 
at least 280, perhaps 310, who intend to vote "yes." [passage

<F P=106> [SN, APA report: "Austria Was Involved More Strongly in </F>
Trade With Far East in 1993"] 
  [Text] Vienna -- The extraordinarily rapid economic 
development of the Far East states made these countries one of 
the most promising markets for Austrian business. In 1993 
domestic exports to Japan, China, Korea, Hong Kong, Taiwan, and 
Singapore rose by 10.5 percent to 18.7 billion schillings (4 
percent of overall exports). These were set off by a volume of 
imports that had increased by 4.1 percent to 46 billion 
schillings (8.2 percent of overall imports). 
  Trade with China increased sharply. According to trade 
delegate Ernst Laschan, exports were expanded by 41 percent to 
3.7 billion schillings; imports rose by 30 percent to 7.8 
billion schillings. The most important export goods were 
machines "made in Austria." This provided about 69 percent of 
export revenues. However, the future lies not so much in direct 
exports but in joint ventures, Laschan said. At the moment 
there are fewer than 10 of these joint ventures; by the end of 
the year another five are to be added, however. 
  In 1993 Austria registered a record growth of exports to 
Korea: They rose by 50 percent to 2.2 billion schillings. Trade 
delegate Gerhard Meschke sees "excellent export prospects also 
for the future." Korea is in the process of developing from a 
low-wage country to a highly technicized industrial state. This 
increasingly gives rise to a demand for high-technology 
solutions to problems. 
  The second most important overseas market after the United 
States was and is Japan. However, because of the current 
weakness of its economy and the resulting weak demand, in 1993 
exports to Japan declined by 4.3 percent to 7.2 billion 
schillings. "Still, Austrian exporters have mastered the crisis 
of the Japanese economy better than expected," Wolfgang Kueng, 
trade delegate in Japan, stresses. In 1994 exports to Japan are 
expected to rise again. The strong yen will force Japanese 
industry to buy more products abroad, which will primarily 
benefit domestic subcontractors for the automobile industry.

<F P=106> [By Sarah Womack, PRESS ASSOCIATION lobby correspondent] </F>
  [Text] German Chancellor Helmut Kohl flew into Britain for 
today's Anglo-German summit to be met by John Major and a full 
guard of honour. The one-day meeting provides Mr Major with an 
opportunity to enhance his image as a European statesman in 
advance of June's Euro elections after an embarrassing climbdown 
over EU [European Union] voting rights. 
  Officials have stressed the close personal relationship 
between the two leaders but divisions between Germany and 
Britain have been reported over who should be the next president 
of the European Commission. Britain wants Sir Leon Brittan, 
the senior British Commissioner, to succeed Jacques Delors in 
the 150,000 pound sterling a year job. But it is understood Mr 
Kohl favours Belgian Premier Jean-Luc Dehaene. Tory Euro 
sceptics claim Mr Dehaene is an avowed federalist. 
  Stepping out of a German Air Force jet at RAF Northolt, west 
London, Mr Kohl refused to be drawn on the issue. He joked 
that he could then be required to back every member state's 
chosen candidate each time he visited their country. 
  Mr Major said: "It is our view that Sir Leon is the best 
candidate. We will need to discuss that with all our 
colleagues, it will be a collective decision." 
  Mr Kohl stressed the warmth of Britain's relationship with 
Germany and Mr Major said he was delighted to see "such a good 
friend of the UK" back on British soil. 
  Turning briefly to the situation in Gorazde, Mr Major said: 
"It does seem we had a pretty quiet night in Gorazde. At the 
moment aid is getting in and patients are getting out. I am 
delighted that is proving to be the case and I hope further 
examination today will show that the Serb armaments have been 
moved 20 kilometres away, as requested." 
  The two leaders then boarded a helicopter for Chequers, Mr 
Major's official country residence, for around three hours of 
talks before they return to London to join their respective 
economic and foreign ministers, who are holding separate talks, 
for a news conference at the Foreign Office.

<F P=106> [Unattributed report: "CIS Disarmament: With Bonn's Money </F>
and High Technology"] 
  [Text] With German "know-how" and 20 million German marks 
[DM] (for 1993-94) for the time being, the FRG Government wants 
to accelerate the abolition of chemical and nuclear means of 
mass destruction in Russia and Ukraine. At the moment, the 
Russians can destroy only about 2,000 nuclear warheads per year. 
On the territory of the former Soviet Union there are 30,000 
nuclear warheads and, in Russia alone, 40,000 tonnes of chemical 
weapons. It would take 15 to 20 years to destroy these stocks. 
  An internal paper of the Foreign Ministry says that, in 
October 1993, an agreement was concluded with the Defense 
Ministry in Moscow on the construction of a pilot plant for the 
destruction of the chemical combat agents, lewisite and yperite, 
in the area of Saratov (final price DM62 million). A mobile 
laboratory for the analysis of combat agents was handed over to 
the Russians already in December 1993. The costs for the 
"disarmament aid for chemical weapons" in 1993: about DM5 
million. For the accelerated disarmament of their nuclear 
weapons Russia and Ukraine have asked the Federal Government 
this year for equipment as well as control and safety systems at 
a value of about DM17 million.

  [Text] Paris, April 27 (AFP) -- France "demands" the 
immediate and unconditional release of 11 aid workers held by 
Bosnian Serbs for more than two weeks on the outskirts of 
Sarajevo, Foreign Minister Alain Juppe said Wednesday [27 April]. 
  The 11 French aid workers, members of the "Premiere urgence" 
humanitarian group, were detained by Bosnian Serbs on April 8 on 
charges of trying to smuggle arms to Bosnian Moslems. 
  The workers "did their humanitarian duty and nothing else," 
the minister told parliament, adding that they had been "set 
up," with weapons purposefully put aboard their convoy. 
  Their arrest and detention in Bosnian Serb barracks followed 
a warning by the North Atlantic Treaty Organisation that it 
would bomb Bosnian Serb forces if they did not remove their 
heavy weapons from around Sarajevo.

<F P=106> [Report by Bent Winther: "Archrivals Move Forward Again"] </F>
  [Text] The archrivals in Danish political life, the 
Liberal Party and the Social Democrats, move forward in today's 
Gallup poll. While the Center Democrats fall below the 
threshold for representation in the Folketing for the second 
month in a row. 
  An unclear Folketing in which neither the four parties which 
currently form the government nor the Conservative People's 
Party, the Liberal Party, and the Progress Party together can 
produce a majority. 
  This, according to the Gallup Institute, would be the 
outcome 
of an election today. The poll does not show any major shift in 
the relative strengths of the two blocs since last month. 
  However, what is most striking is that the Liberal Party has 
again moved forward after being on the retreat since December 
last year. In December Prime Minister Poul Nyrup Rasmussen 
(Social Democratic Party) teased Liberal Party leader Uffe 
Ellemann-Jensen that he had peaked too early. Now there is 
everything to indicate that the Liberal Party has regained its 
form. Its successes would seem, however, to be at the expense 
of the other major nonsocialist party, the Conservative People's 
Party. 
  At the same time the Social Democrats have improved their 
poor figures from last month. However, the biggest government 
party is still four percentage points below its excellent 
election result in 1990. 
  The Center Democrats have, it would seem, still not gotten 
over their downturn and the split after the Bente Juncker affair 
in February. For the second month in a row the party is faced 
with the prospect of disappearing from the Folketing. 
  On the other hand the Christian People's Party, which holds 
its national conference during the weekend can be happy that it 
is nicely above the representation threshold and is now in fact 
as big as the Radical Liberal Party.

  [Text] Joe Clark, the UN secretary general's special 
representative on Cyprus, arrived in Cyprus from Turkey this 
afternoon and will meet [Turkish Cypriot leader] Rauf Denktas at 
1800 this afternoon. 
  Speaking at Larnaca Airport on his arrival, Clark avoided 
announcing the Turkish stance on the 21 March document on ways 
of implementing the confidence-building measures. Replying to a 
series of questions from CyBC [Cyprus Broadcasting Corporation] 
on the issue, Clark said that he did not expect Turkish 
authorities to explain their recent statements that they perhaps 
intended for someone else. He said he had the opportunity to 
deal with some wrong impressions that exist in Turkey, one of 
which is that there are two documents. There are not two 
documents but one and we will discuss ways to implement it. 
Clark also noted that the decision to accept or reject [the 
document] should be made by the two communities based on actual 
events. He also said that he will not present a new set of 
proposals. Asked about the purpose of his meeting tomorrow with 
President Glavkos Kliridhis, who has accepted the document, 
Clark answered that he will discuss ways of implementing the set 
of proposals that Kliridhis and Denktas have accepted in 
principle. Furthermore, Clark said that he would be surprised 
if a new extension is given for an answer from the Turkish side.

<F P=106> [Announcer-read report over video] </F>
  [Text] Prime Minister Tansu Ciller has pointed out that 
unfounded rumors about the Cyprus issue have been spread 
recently in order to confuse the people. She stressed that it 
is out of the question for Turkey to make any concessions on 
such a vital issue. Ciller said: I did not make any promises 
about Cyprus to anyone behind closed doors in the United States 
or anywhere else. 
  Addressing a meeting of the True Path Party National 
Assembly 
group, Ciller pointed out that Turkey's foreign policy follows a 
line that was drawn up by Ataturk and which has not changed 
since the republic was founded. She explained that Turkish 
foreign policy is based on national consensus and is above the 
party. She stressed that exploiting this issue by making 
unfounded speculations about it will only weaken the country. 
  Ciller charged that certain circles have been making 
unfounded allegations recently to the effect that concessions 
will be made in Cyprus as a result of Turkey's economic 
difficulties. Ciller said: 
  [Begin recording] Let me say it clearly: Neither I nor any 
prime minister of the Turkish Republic can make concessions on 
the Cyprus issue -- one of Turkey's most vital issues -- because 
of economic or other reasons. [applause] No prime minister can 
do that. It is inconceivable. Such unfortunate rumors and 
allegations hurt our country first and foremost. [applause] I 
am again saying clearly that I did not make any promises about 
Cyprus to anyone behind closed doors in the United States or 
anywhere else. [end recording] 
  The prime minister pointed out that Turkey's views on Cyprus 
were conveyed to the U.S. Administration in written form. 
  [Begin Ciller recording] This is what President Clinton said 
to me regarding this issue: The Cyprus issue is at an impasse. 
Can you help? 
  Almost every U.S. President has spoken to almost all our 
prime ministers along these lines at various platforms. This is 
not a new development. Whenever a Turkish prime minister went 
to the United States, he heard these remarks from the U.S. 
Administration. There is nothing new in that. 
  My reply to President Clinton's remarks was as follows, in 
brief: The Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus had agreed to the 
original confidence-building measures [CBM's]. The package was 
later changed to satisfy the Greek Cypriots. The frequent 
changes in the package are causing difficulties. Nonetheless, 
let us look at the latest situation once again. Let us look for 
the common ground between the two sides. In fact, that is the 
aim of the CBM's. 
  That is the essence of what we said. [end recording]

<F P=106> [Article by Ertugrul Kurkcu: "Peace: A Rational End to the </F>
Southeast Conflict"] 
  [Text] The Ciller government has launched an austerity 
program which is basically aimed at closing an immense public 
deficit of $7 billion. Leaving aside the question of the 
consistency of the austerity measures themselves, the unfeasible 
and ambitious privatization plans, the lack of determination and 
discipline in levying additional taxes on prosperous social 
groups, not to mention a prospective deterioration in the 
already disturbed social balances once the program itself is 
fully implemented, Prime Minister Tansu Ciller's set of economic 
and financial measures, as a matter of fact, misses its basic 
goal; namely, overcoming the public deficit. 
  A public deficit by definition basically arises from the 
state's unproductive expenditures as every high school graduate 
could simply guess. 
  Yet, even after having introduced a new set of austerity 
measures, the government has obviously left the major source of 
public expenditures--state expenses on security and defense 
which approximately comprise one-third of the budget--intact. 
Ciller, however, still calls on the nation to swallow this 
"bitter pill," or she warns, the nation's fate will be at stake. 
If the nation is really to swallow this "bitter pill," if the 
government has really to close down or sell out State Economic 
Enterprises, and lay off thousands of public employees on the 
pretext that they are "economically unproductive," then why does 
the government let the most unproductive allotment in the budget 
grow in inverse proportions? 
  Who has decided that the nation through the state should 
invest in guns but not in butter? And in economic and social 
terms how feasible or profitable is it to invest in guns or, in 
other terms, in war? 
  According to Ciller and her closet aides, Turkey in the last 
decade has spent TL 800 trillion in order to support security 
operations in the Southeast. She moreover plans to spend a 
further TL 400 billion in the next 16 months. 
  Yet during the decade old conflict in the Southeast, the 
"enemy," the PKK (Kurdistan Workers' Party) forces, have grown 
from 250 in 1984 to 20,000 in 1994. 
  Except for the security mechanism, which has swollen to huge 
dimensions, the state has been deprived of all its public 
functions in the state of emergency region. Meanwhile 
clandestine, fundamentalist organizations such as Hezbollah have 
been allowed to speak through secular mechanisms. 
  Local people have fallen victim to frequent instances of 
torture and mistreatment. 
  The economy, in turn, has come to a halt, the free 
circulation of goods, money and people between the country's 
West and the Southeast provinces has almost stopped. The 
countryside has been devastated, forests set on fire, 
agricultural areas destroyed and livestock and farming nearly 
abandoned. 
  People from the countryside have had to group themselves in 
and around the region's bigger cities or immigrated to Western 
cities such as Mersin, Adana, Istanbul, and Ankara, turning 
these metropolitan centers into ungovernable, big villages. And 
the immense human sacrifice included at least 10,000 people, 
more than 2,000 of whom were civilians, and resulted in growing 
ethnic and religious tension among the citizens of various 
origins both in the region and in the West. The overall result: 
A decade's balance sheet, after enormous spending on war and in 
spite of all material and human sacrifice, has now produced a 
country which is failing when judged by two major international 
criteria. It has an incredibly bad human rights record and an 
ever falling economic credibility. 
  After having given her one year to pursue the so-called 
path to a "military solution" to the Kurdish question, the 
Western allies now question some of Ciller's policies. Bonn 
suspends military aid at least temporarily; Washington hedges 
about additional economic aid to Turkey; and the British 
Parliament hosts a major PKK official in order to hear his 
version of the Kurdish problem. Just at that fatal point "the 
enemy," the rebel PKK leader Abdullah Ocalan, offers Turkey 
another chance for a lasting peace, one year after the abortive 
call for a cease-fire in March 1993. 
  "Just recognize our Kurdish identity and render 
constitutional guarantees to our claims for self-government. We 
are ready to concede any solution within Turkey's present 
boundaries," Ocalan says. "No territorial claims, no 
separatism." 
  Yet, it seems that the government and the Army are 
determined 
to pursue their path to "military solutions," with the naive 
belief that the PKK is already isolated from the "people" and 
will inevitably yield to the immense military pressure already 
in progress. 
  The outcome of the ongoing military crackdown on the PKK 
forces, which extends from the east bank of the Euphrates to 
deep in northern Iraq, and which, the military claims, will 
continue until the PKK is "finally eradicated" from the region, 
will eventually show the Turkish public if the "military 
solution" to the Kurdish question is, or was, any solution at 
all. 
  Turkey's citizens of both Kurdish and Turkish origins have 
already paid an immense price both in material and human terms 
for the war or to repeat the chief of staff's terminology for 
the "low intensity warfare" in the Southeast. Now at the height 
of the flagrant clashes in northern Iraq, it is high time to 
develop concrete and conceivable plans for peace. 
  There is no reason to believe that Kurds would submit their 
"national identity" as a result of military force, the appeal to 
which has cost the citizen of this country a whole decade, 
thousands of lives and billions of dollars. 
  The reverse contains more truth; the unreasonable appeal to 
force by successive Turkish governments has awakened the Kurds 
to their "national identity" on such a scale that even the 
present moderate overtones displayed by the PKK might be viewed 
as rather "fainthearted" by thousands of Kurdish victims of the 
conflict. No one should fool himself or herself into thinking 
that Ocalan's latest offer for peace results from an 
organizational and political weaknesses or from a deteriorating 
position in the region. 
  On the contrary, there is every proof that Ocalan's 
influence 
in his own organization is at its peak and the PKK's influence 
among Kurds in other parts of the region--in Syria, Iran, Iraq 
and Armenia--is on the increase. 
  Yet, Ocalan seeks peace just when he has reached maximum 
control over his sphere of influence, for he seems to be a wise 
enough leader to understand that he is historically incapable of 
inflicting a final defeat on the Turkish Army; yet he is equally 
confident that his forces cannot be finally defeated by the 
Turkish Army. Thus, arises an offer for peace, before a 
decade's military stalemate makes the country a huge junkyard 
and a massive cemetery, a country in which he believes Kurds are 
fated to live together with Turks. 
  Now, after having spoiled the nation's fortunes and 
resources 
for decades on guns in order to deny the identities of its 
Kurdish brethren, Turkey has to decide. Is not peace more 
profitable than the war? Is not investing on production more 
feasible that spending on the military? Is not recognizing 
Kurds as constituents of a democratic Turkey more progressive 
and more humane that recognizing them as our "enemies?"

  [Text] Vienna (DPA) -- The International Atomic Energy 
Agency (IAEA) is still waiting with the inspection of the 
5-megawatt research reactor in the North Korean nuclear center 
of Yongbyon. The authority first wants binding promises from 
Pyongyang that the inspectors are permitted to carry out 
important control measures, IAEA spokesman Hans Friedrich Meyer 
told DPA in Vienna on Thursday [28 April]. "We will certainly 
not only stand aside and watch!" 
  Last week, North Korea had offered to allow the IAEA to 
monitor the necessary exchange of the fuel rods. In the letter, 
the IAEA inspectors had been invited to be "present." "We 
explained to North Korea once again that we want to carry out 
inspection activities and what they are," Meyer said. As 
reported from diplomatic circles in Vienna, the nuclear 
authority wants to measure above all the burned-out fuel rods. 
The diplomats hope that such analyses will provide them with 
the information on whether plutonium was set aside for the 
construction of nuclear bombs. 
  As early as in its first answer to Pyongyang, which accepted 
in principle the invitation from North Korea, the nuclear 
authority had pointed out that inspections are also becoming 
necessary again in the other nuclear plants. In particular, the 
radiochemical laboratory in Yongbyon is at issue. In contrasts 
to all agreements, North Korea denied access to the laboratory 
to the experts of the UN organization in the course of the 
latest IAEA inspection one month ago. As a result, the nuclear 
authority decided to refer the nuclear dispute to the UN 
Security Council.

<F P=106> [Article signed MV/SV/NB: "International Conference on </F>
Control of Chemical Substances Opens in Stockholm"] 
  [Text] Stockholm/Bern, 25 April (ATS/DPA) -- The 
international conference on the control of chemical substances 
opened on Monday [25 April] in Stockholm. Over the course of 
five days, representatives of 130 states, including Switzerland, 
will discuss how to use and transport toxic chemical substances 
to ensure greater respect for the environment. 
  Among the issues that will be discussed are the increased 
production and use of chemical substances in Third World 
countries. These states often do not have the financial 
resources and technical know-how to use these products in an 
environmentally friendly way. Moreover, these countries are 
increasingly being subjected to toxic waste exports from 
industrialized countries. 
  The Swiss delegation in the Swedish capital is led by Rudolf 
Baerfuss, head of international affairs at the Federal Office of 
the Environment, Forests and Countryside. According to a press 
release issued by the Interior Ministry, the conference should 
decide to increase coordination between the institutions already 
active in the field of dangerous chemical substances. In 
addition, Chapter 19 of Agenda 21 adopted at the Rio summit in 
June 1992 will be put into effect. 
  The decisions made in Stockholm will be implemented by the 
secretariat of the international program on the safety of 
dangerous substances. This secretariat has been placed under 
the authority of the UN program for the environment, the World 
Health Organization, and the International Labor Organization.

<F P=106> [Paul Brown report: "Pesticides Kill 40,000 a Year Says UN </F>
Expert"] 
  [Text] At least 40,000 people are killed each year by 
misuse of pesticides and up to one million are made ill or 
permanently damaged, Jan Huismans, of the United Nations 
environment programme said yesterday. 
  Many of the chemicals are made in Europe and North America 
and are exported to developing countries where they are used by 
illiterate farmers who have no concept of the damage they are 
doing to themselves, he said. 
  Mr Huismans, who is assistant executive director of the 
unit, 
was speaking on the opening day of the conference in Stockholm, 
aimed at controlling the worldwide use of chemicals. 
  Many of the delegations from 130 countries have been paid 
for 
by the United Kingdom which after the United States and Japan is 
the largest contributor to the International Programme of 
Chemical Safety. 
  The big worldwide increase in chemical use has led to 
widespread misapplications on crops and application in climates 
for which the chemicals were not designed. Many of those used 
on food crops have never been tested to see what long-term 
effects they have on the environment or people. 
  Dr Hirishi Nakajimo, director general of the World Health 
Organisation, said in other areas ignorance was also widespread. 
The UN inspectors who visited the Iraq chemical warfare 
factories after the Gulf war were shocked to find operators had 
no idea what they were dealing with. 
  Professor Klaus Topfer, the German environment minister, 
said 
his government was trying to clean up some of the problems in 
East Europe caused by exports from the former East Germany. 
  The Stockholm meeting is the first International Conference 
on Chemical Safety and is expected to set up a worldwide system 
to classify chemicals, test them and control their use. 
  Dr Gerald James, from the Department of Health, leading the 
British delegation, said training of people in countries that 
used the chemicals was vital. "People have to realise that 
pesticides are extremely nasty, made deliberately toxic to kill 
something." 
  The UK was keen on the principle of "informed consent." This 
meant that before chemicals were exported the country receiving 
them was fully aware of the dangers if they were not controlled. 
  Sometimes governments receiving the chemicals were informed 
but the people who used them had no idea of the consequences of 
handling them. 
  Professor Topfer said with the world population increasing 
by 
28,000 a day many would starve unless food production was 
stimulated and protected by chemicals.

<F P=106> [Unattributed article: "NATO: Italy Hosts `Dynamic Impact' </F>
Exercises"] 
  [Text] (ANSA) Rome, April 26 -- NATO forces will stage 
"Dynamic Impact" exercises in the central western Mediterranean, 
May 4-19, aimed at training convention forces to deal with 
crisis situations, the supreme headquarters of allied forces in 
Europe (SHAPE) announced today. 
  SHAPE said operation Dynamic Impact was an exercise which 
employed the use of land, sea, air and amphibious forces and 
command centers. The exercise includes naval and air operations 
in the central-western Mediterranean and land and amphibious 
operations in Italy-Friuli, Tuscany and Emilia-Romagna with the 
employment of armed forces from eleven nations -- Belgium, 
France, Germany, United States, Netherlands, Portugal, Britain, 
Greece, Italy, Spain and Turkey. 
  France and Spain, while not fully integrated into NATO's 
military structure, will participate with land, sea and air 
forces in the framework of normal training exercises with the 
allies. 
  In order to enhance security and avoid or at least reduce 
inconveniences for civil air traffic, all activities have been 
coordinated between civil and military authorities in the 
framework of the NATO Committee for European Air Space 
Coordination (CEAC). 
  Operation Dynamic Impact, will be carried out under the 
command of the new chief of allied forces in southern Europe, 
Admiral Leighton Smith.

  [Text] Vienna, April 26 (CTK) -- On the eighth anniversary 
of the Chernobyl catastrophe, Austrian Environment Minister 
Maria Rauch-Kallat called for the nuclear power station at 
Jaslovske Bohunice, West Slovakia, to be converted to a 
gas-fired plant as soon as possible. 
  "The West European nuclear lobby is trying to get into 
Slovakia and replace Bohunice with another nuclear power 
station. In the West, nuclear power can no longer be put forward 
as a solution, and there is thus an attempt here to conquer the 
hopeful market in East Europe," Rauch-Kallat said in a press 
statement. 
  The participation of the American firm Westinghouse in the 
completion of Temelin nuclear power station in South Bohemia is 
clearly considered a green light for further similar activity, 
the minister warned. In her contacts with Slovak leaders, 
therefore, she had repeatedly emphasized Austrian fears. 
  "We have also found out that the possibility of changing 
Bohunice into a gas-fired power station is becoming more and 
more the subject of serious discussion," Rauch-Kallat said, 
adding that a significant contribution towards this had been 
made by an Austrian-Swiss study showing that such a project was 
feasible. 
  Members of the Austrian environmental movement Global 2000 
protested in Vienna today against the participation by the 
French company Electricite de France (EdF) in the completion of 
the Mochovce nuclear power station in West Slovakia. Activists 
abseiled off the roof of the EdF building in Vienna and hung up 
a banner saying "EdF -- Hands off Mochovce." 
  Global 2000 say Mochovce is only a gateway to the East 
European nuclear market for EdF, and that the company is mainly 
planning to modernize VVER-440/213 reactors. Besides 
Westinghouse, EdF is the most significant supporter of nuclear 
power in East Europe, they add.

<F P=106> [Article signed EHK: "Delcroix Advocates Division of Tasks </F>
Regarding European Defense"] 
  [Text] Brussels, 25 Apr (BELGA) -- Defense is becoming 
increasingly expensive and will become unaffordable in the long 
term. We are not long away from the time when, especially for a 
small European country, maintaining a full-fledged land, air, 
and sea force will be a utopian endeavor. In a federal Europe, 
the solution can be found in a highly advanced division of tasks 
and a streamlining of the "cost" factor. This is what Defense 
Minister Leo Delcroix said on Monday [25 April] during a speech 
given to the Belgium-Netherlands Association. 
  As far as this division of tasks is concerned, Leo Delcroix 
is thinking in particular of the Netherlands, a country which, 
together with Belgium, is a member of a number of international 
organizations. He said "he was convinced that they are both 
being called upon to go even further into bilateralism." 
  He also came out in favor of greater selectivity and better 
quality in defining defense needs and wondered how prepared we 
were to invest in defense to ensure our security as well as our 
policy of development aid. 
  Finally, he once again raised the matter of Belgian 
participation in UN operations and the latest events in Rwanda. 
According to him, security and development are closely linked, 
and we are currently working on a development policy "in the 
broad sense of the term." He felt that we must have the courage 
to review old conceptions and the customary definitions and 
classifications. The minister also said that "we must check and 
see whether the means at our disposal could be used better or 
whether the time had come to think of new means which did not 
seem available before or which, in any case, were not wanted." 
The defense minister added that "he was holding a `constructive 
dialogue' with State Secretary for Development Cooperation Erik 
Derycke. We have already been able to achieve certain things 
together," he said.

<F P=106> [Kevin Brown and Philip Stephens report: "Portillo Moves To </F>
Calm Tory Fears on Looming Defence Cuts"] 
  [Text] Mr Michael Portillo, chief secretary to the 
Treasury, yesterday sought to defuse a row over defence cuts by 
insisting that Conservative backbench fears about the 
effectiveness of the armed forces were misplaced. 
  Amid concern that the issue could develop into another 
political embarrassment for the government, senior ministers 
said reports that substantial savings have been identified by 33 
defence ministry working groups were "broadly correct." 
  Decisions on which proposed cuts will be implemented are 
unlikely to be taken until shortly before the annual defence 
white paper in July, after the local elections on May 5 and the 
European poll on June 9. Mr John Major, the prime minister, is 
likely to face awkward questions in the Commons today after the 
expected release of the defence estimates, although details of 
the proposed cuts are likely to be excluded. 
  Mr Malcolm Rifkind, defence secretary, said the government 
had "not the slightest intention of sanctioning any proposal 
that would reduce the fighting capability" of the forces. "What 
I am anxious to do is find sufficient savings where defence 
expenditure can be switched from support to the front line to 
actually enhance the capability of our fighting forces," he said. 
  But the most significant intervention came from Mr Portillo 
who let it be known that he was seeking improved efficiency 
rather than across-the-board cuts. His aides said Mr Rifkind 
would be allowed to plough back into the front-line forces any 
savings achieved by the rationalisation programme. 
  In the past the Treasury has sought to claw back savings 
made 
from defence cuts, but the aides pointed to a key passage in a 
speech by Mr Portillo last week in which he stressed the 
increasing demands on the military. 
  "To respond to this new world, our forces need to be 
flexible 
and battle-ready. They must not be hampered by bureaucracy, 
their budgets must be spent efficiently and intelligently. 
Every effort must be focused on the front line," Mr Portillo 
said. 
  The cuts identified by the working parties are understood to 
include up to 20,000 jobs, mergers of headquarters 
organisations, property sales and vehicle leasing. The naval 
base at Rosyth, Fife, may also be closed.

<F P=106> [Editorial: "Rethinking UK Defence"] </F>
  [Text] Yesterday's white paper on defence is pure 
politics. It is a holding operation, designed to get the 
government through the forthcoming round of local elections, 
by-elections, and contests for seats in the European Parliament. 
The camouflage is transparent. 
  The paper intimates, as might be expected, that defence is 
important. At the same time it affirms that cost savings are 
being sought in response to the budget cuts announced in 
November. Mr Malcolm Rifkind, the defence secretary, has put on 
record his understanding that, if economies greater than those 
asked for are found, the cash released may be diverted to the 
front line forces. Savings in excess of the 2.3 billion pounds 
agreed with the Treasury may therefore be anticipated. 
  Much of what may be expected is already evident. Civilians, 
who are cheaper to employ, may be used for back-room tasks. 
Stock holding, and the storage of spares, may be almost 
entirely privatised. Overall levels of support staff may be 
cut. There may be fewer senior officers, following a management 
downsizing equivalent to that undertaken in non-military 
enterprises. Expensive institutions, such as Royal Navy and RAF 
[Royal Air Force] staff colleges, may be closed. The courses 
could be transferred to an army facility. The Royal Navy have 
recommended that the base at Rosyth in Fife be shut. 
  Most of the items in the above list are of the sort that 
governments prefer to avoid when the are about to face the 
electorate. Job losses and redundancies are never popular. 
Defenders of Rosyth are already much agitated. The Labour 
leader, Mr John Smith, has begun to taunt the government for its 
"piecemeal cuts." He is hitting home. There is little stomach 
in the Conservative part for further reductions in defence 
spending. In consequence, nothing specific will be announced 
until July, when the voting is over. 
<H5>  Overriding Fault </H5>
  The white paper's overriding fault, however, is that it is 
more likely to set off a debate about candle-ends than a 
fundamental reappraisal of Britain's defence policy. 
Accountancy has its place. Yet it is deep thinking that is 
required. Mr Smith has called for a full defence review. Serb 
expansionism has engendered a less dovish mood than is 
traditional on the Labour benches. Mr Paddy Ashdown, the leader 
of the Liberal Democrats, confessed on Monday that he had been 
wrong to advocate sweeping defence cuts after the Berlin wall 
came down. "It is now clear that we shall see not peace in 
Europe, but vicious conflicts of a type which we thought we had 
banished half a century ago," he said. 
<H5>  Confusion Reigns </H5>
  Whether or not Mr Ashdown is right, Europe should certainly 
prepare itself against the day when it must maintain its own 
stability. In its present mood the United States can no longer 
be regarded as the Atlantic community's policeman. President 
Bush saw the conflict in former Yugoslavia as primarily Europe's 
business, which it is. President Clinton, a reluctant ally, has 
resolutely refused to commit U.S. ground forces while the 
fighting continues. The United States remains attached to NATO, 
but the depth of its commitment may not remain constant. 
  On the eastern side of the Atlantic, confusion reigns. 
Britain plans to reduce defence spending to around 3 per cent 
of gross national product in the late 1990s, as against 5.3 per 
cent a decade ago. Most European countries, France excepted, 
plan to spend below Britain's projected level. In the absence 
of a clear pan-European foreign policy framework no one can tell 
whether these amounts are sufficient. The necessary framework 
cannot be constructed while Germany remains uncertain about its 
future defence role, or while France deludes itself that it can 
behave as a great power, or while Britain distances itself from 
the continent. 
  In short, there is no cohesion of European thought or 
action, 
and little underlying agreement on the future presence in Europe 
of U.S. forces. A proper white paper would set out the foreign 
policy options and the defence decisions that flow from them. 
The starting point would be to focus British eyes on both NATO 
and the European Union. That is more important than the defence 
of Tory seats in a borough council or two.

<F P=106> [Philip Bassett article: "CBI Sees No Need for Further Cut </F>
in Rates"] 
  [Text] Business leaders yesterday saw no need for further 
interest rate cuts after a leading industrial survey showed 
manufacturing output rising at its fastest for five years. 
  But the latest Confederation of British Industry [CBI] 
quarterly industrial trends report showed a weakening in 
business confidence and investment intentions, and still more 
job losses to come in manufacturing industry. 
  Government ministers will draw comfort from the CBl's 
evidence of continuing economic recovery and from the unusual 
statement by the CBI that business would prefer policy stability 
rather than any further cuts in interest rates -- particularly 
if they were small and likely to be reversed. 
  The Treasury saw the findings of the April trends survey as 
encouraging, and in line with the general picture of an 
improving economy. Officials pointed in particular to positive 
signs on exports. They thought, too, that the 14-point slide in 
business confidence largely reflected the changed timing of the 
Budget and to some extent the impact of the April tax rises. 
  But City analysts saw the CBI findings as disappointing, 
especially since April traditionally sees a seasonal surge in 
confidence. 
  But the CBI stressed that the survey of 1,219 companies, 
accounting for about half the UK's manufacturing employment and 
exports, indicated continued recovery. 
  The survey's main findings included: 
  l. Confidence. The balance of firms declaring an increase 
in optimism fell back from 27 to 13 per cent. The usual April 
upturn did not occur for the first time in a decade. 
  2. Output. Expectations of increased output remain at a 
high level -- at a balance of 16 per cent, the fastest rate of 
increase since April 1989. The CBI said its figures pointed to 
a growth of 0.8 per cent in manufacturing output over the second 
half of this year. 
  3. Orders. Demand is expected to continue rising at its 
current rate; a net balance of 16 per cent of companies reported 
higher orders. 
  4. Exports. Export orders rose slightly more quickly than 
in the four months to January, and a balance of 18 per cent of 
companies forecast that they will continue to rise over the next 
four months. 
  5. Investment. The balance of firms planning to invest more 
slipped back from 7 per cent in January to 4 per cent. Kate 
Barker, CBI chief economics adviser, said: "The lack of strength 
in investment is worrying for the Government." The proportion 
of companies saying they are working below capacity is slightly 
up. 
  6. Jobs. Manufacturing firms are still pointing to a fall 
in employment, in contrast to government figures. CBI officials 
said a further 28,000 job losses were predicted for the second 
quarter.

<F P=106> [Article by Jonathan Eyal, director of studies at the Royal </F>
United Services Institute in London: "Another Walk-on Part for 
Moscow"] 
  [Text] With this week's meetings in London, international 
efforts to tackle the Yugoslav war have come full circle. 
Originally, the European Union asserted a leading role in the 
Balkans. After failing comprehensively, it passed the problem 
to the UN, which in turn handed it to NATO. The involvement of 
NATO brought in the Americans and that, predictably, drew in the 
Russians. Three years after the Yugoslav crisis started, the 
governments concerned decided on a measure they could have 
implemented from the start: they established a "contact group" 
of officials to co-ordinate policies in Yugoslavia. 
  Ostensibly, a contact group makes sense. The positions of 
the NATO governments and the Kremlin appear to be drawing 
closer. NATO's failure to stop the Serbs destroying Gorazde was 
followed by the failure of the Russian envoy in the Balkans, 
deputy foreign minister Vitaliy Churkin, to achieve the same end 
through persuasion. 
  The U.S. Administration has been pushing for stronger NATO 
action in Yugoslavia precisely because it assumes that this time 
the Russians are unlikely to object. Yet appearances can be 
deceptive: the contact group is a device intended to take a 
middle course between engaging Moscow in the Balkans and keeping 
the Russians away. And, despite the current efforts, the West 
is almost guaranteed to continue misreading the message from the 
Kremlin. 
  We have persuaded ourselves that the Russians have a 
historic 
friendship with the Serbs. But although history plays a part in 
the Balkans, it tends to provide only justification, not the 
reason, for the Serbs' current policies. True, many Russians 
feel some affinity with them. Historically, though, 
Russian-Serb relations were dominated more by confrontation than 
co-operation. 
  Nationalist politicians in Moscow today may have an interest 
in reviving a historic pan-Slav alliance. But this is not 
necessarily the same as friendship with the Serbs; Slovenia, 
Croatia, Macedonia and Bulgaria are also Slav nations. It is 
often forgotten, moreover, that Serbia's political elite was 
educated at a time when Moscow was viewed as Yugoslavia's mortal 
enemy. All Serb generals now fighting in Bosnia were trained 
for a possible Soviet invasion. In short, the "traditional" 
Russian-Serb friendship is nothing more than a temporary 
marriage of convenience and is unlikely to last. 
  Isolated from the world, Serbs see Moscow as their only 
protector against military action from the West. But they are 
also determined to show that they will not allow the Kremlin to 
interfere with their war plans. Hence they ignored Russia's 
demands for a halt to the carnage around Gorazde. 
  Having the limits of their influence exposed has been 
frustrating for Russia's diplomats. But this does not mean that 
Boris Yeltsin is now ready to give the West a free hand in the 
Balkans. From the Russian perspective, the most important 
consideration is not the ultimate arrangements in Yugoslavia, 
but the lessons that the Balkan war may have for future European 
security structures and the precedents Western action may set. 
  Since the collapse of the Soviet Union, Russian politicians 
kept the notion of a "strategic partnership" with the West. It 
is easy to see what they had in mind: although weakened, Russia 
should continue to occupy a place at the top table and be 
involved in important decisions. The West understood this need, 
and paid lip service to the concept. But events in Yugoslavia 
exposed how insubstantial it was. 
  Russia's every demand for a new UN mandate in the Balkans 
has 
been rejected. Instead, the West has insisted on reinterpreting 
resolutions already adopted by the Security Council. Often, as 
far as Moscow was concerned, they did this without consulting 
the Kremlin. The decision to nominate NATO to implement UN 
policies in Bosnia was taken without consulting the Russians; so 
was the decision to issue an ultimatum on Sarajevo, the shooting 
down of four Serb planes over Bosnia and the launch of air 
strikes on Gorazde on 10 April. At each stage, the West 
promised the Russians would be involved, but this happened 
after, not before, a decision was taken. 
  The tactic was familiar to the Russians, for it was the same 
as the one used by the United States before the Gulf war. 
Moscow was also excluded from the Arab-Israeli peace 
negotiations: the Russian foreign minister was invited only to 
the signing ceremony in Washington, just an actor in a vast 
Western-sponsored photo-opportunity. 
  So, when NATO issued its ultimatum on Sarajevo this 
February, 
Mr Yeltsin was determined not to be surprised again: instead of 
relying on Western promises, he deployed troops around the 
Bosnian capital, so ensuring that his country could no longer be 
ignored. 
  Russia's main interest in Yugoslavia is to uphold a single 
idea: that NATO should not be allowed to do as it pleases in 
what Moscow still considers a Russian sphere of influence. The 
West may be right to challenge this view. But to annoy the 
Russians and fail to achieve any purpose in Yugoslavia is the 
worst of both worlds. 
  Mr Yeltsin has recently revived his call for a summit on 
Yugoslavia. The American administration has no interest in a 
new conference that could force it to take on unwelcome 
commitments. So, instead of a summit, this contact group will 
now attempt to devise a joint East-West strategy that will allow 
the Russians to claim they remain involved, while upholding 
NATO's leading role in the Balkans. The creation of the group, 
without prior consultation with either Spain or Canada, has 
already infuriated both of these serious contributors to the 
Yugloslav peace-keeping force. And the chances are that this 
entire exercise will do little to change the situation on the 
ground. 
  The contact group may restrict the Serbs' ability to play 
off 
one power against another. But realities do not change: the 
Americans would like the Bosnians to accept that their republic 
is irrevocably divided, but cannot say so publicly; the Russians 
would like to limit NATO's involvement in the region, but do not 
wish to pick a fight with the West over Yugoslavia. 
  The truth that the creation of the contact group seeks to 
hide is simple. The interests of the West and those of Russia 
do not coincide in the Balkans. For the Russians, the status 
quo, created by Serb aggression, is acceptable; for the West, it 
is not. The Balkans require a genuine commitment from 
governments that believe strife in the area actually matters for 
European security. The creation of the contact group sends 
exactly the opposite message: bereft of new ideas, all 
governments have agreed that their main purpose is to shelve 
further disputes between themselves -- the very same lowest 
common denominator that has failed every time in Yugoslavia.

  [Excerpts] Beirut (DPA) -- On Tuesday [26 April] the 
family of Lebanese Muhamad Ali Hamadi, who is in prison in 
Germany, denied press reports that terrorist Ali 'Abbas Hamadi, 
who was deported from Germany last year, has returned to Germany 
to free his brother. On 21 April, Bonn security circles reported 
that corresponding clues are being investigated. [passage 
omitted] 
  On Tuesday the Arab daily AL HAYAH, which is published in 
London, carried a statement of the Hamadi clan, which is very 
influential in Lebanon. The statement says that reports 
"according to which 'Abbas Hamadi is currently in Germany and is 
secretly preparing his brother's escape from prison" are 
"completely wrong." 'Abbas Hamadi is still in Lebanon and 
receives medical treatment because of "the suffering he was 
subjected to in German prisons."

  [Text] Bonn (DPA) -- The attacks of fundamentalist Muslims 
in Algeria and Egypt have given rise to concern in Bonn. For 
safety reasons the German Embassy in Algeria has already sent 
half of its staff home or to safe neighboring countries, Helmut 
Schaefer (Free Democratic Party of Germany), minister of state 
in the Foreign Minister, announced on Wednesday [27 April]. 
Presenting a profound analysis of German policy toward Northern 
Africa at the German-Tunisian Society, Schaefer stressed that 
Tunisia and Morocco are the only reliable anchors of stability 
in this region. 
  In Algeria one must fear a rise in violence because of the 
extremists in the Mouvement Islamique Armee as well as in the 
Groupement Islamique Armee. Since the beginning of 1992 the 
fight has already claimed 3,500 lives, including those of 35 
foreigners. So far, the government has not managed to establish 
a dialogue among the parties, Schaefer said. 
  The domestic policy situation in Egypt has "become more 
difficult," Schaefer admitted. While Egypt's active political 
role in the Middle East peace process is welcomed, the internal 
conflict of the government with the radical Islamic 
fundamentalists is growing. Schaefer stressed that, with its 
current annual development aid of 225 million German marks, 
Germany occupies second place among all donor countries behind 
the United States. Necessary restructuring must be tackled 
carefully so as not to provide the Islamic fundamentalists with 
new nurturing soil because of mass layoffs. 
  Furthermore, Schaefer pointed out that Libya occupies third 
place among Germany's suppliers of crude oil. Bonn is still 
urging Libya's cooperation with the United Nations in clarifying 
the Lockerbie attack.

  [Text] Bonn (DPA) -- Surprisingly, the Bonn coalition 
leaders have temporarily shelved the disputed Bundeswehr thrift 
plans presented by Defense Minister Volker Ruehe, [according to 
the] Christian Democratic Union [CDU]. Obviously as a result of 
pressure exerted by Foreign Minister Klaus Kinkel, Free 
Democratic Party of Germany [FDP], the body, chaired by 
Chancellor Helmut Kohl, decided on Tuesday [26 April] to 
establish a working group consisting of defense experts of the 
CDU/Christian Social Union [CSU] and the FDP. These experts are 
to intensively discuss Ruehe's plans -- including the reduction 
of the armed forces to 340,000 men -- before any decisions are 
made. 
  According to reports from coalition circles, a detailed 
commitment to the future structure and strength of the 
Bundeswehr has been avoided. This is to be made before the 
Bundestag elections, if possible even before the summer recess, 
participants in the meeting said. 
  Kinkel had reportedly come out against the reduction of the 
armed forces to 340,000 men, which Ruehe is striving for, and 
has insisted on the current upper limit of 370,000 men. 
Primarily, it must be asked how big the Bundeswehr must be in 
view of Germany's security policy, Kinkel said. This determines 
the financial demand and not the other way round, namely that 
the financial demand determines the size of the Bundeswehr. In 
the CDU/CSU, too, the number of soldiers is disputed. 
  After the meetings of the coalition representatives and the 
Cabinet, Ruehe stressed that, apart from the question of 
personnel, the basic issues of his concept met with agreement. 
This applies to the financial demand of 47.5 billion German 
marks per year, the division of the Bundeswehr in crisis 
reaction forces and main defense forces, as well as a 
correspondingly differentiated military service of 12 and 10 
months respectively. General compulsory military service is to 
be maintained in any case, Ruehe told journalists. This year no 
further decisions will be made about the future of individual 
barracks. 
  Ruehe repeated his view that with the current financial 
volume it is not possible to maintain a strength of 370,000 men, 
modernize the Bundeswehr, and raise the investment share from 
the current 20 percent to the planned 30 percent all at the same 
time. The savings outside personnel reduction, which Kinkel is 
demanding, are envisaged in his concept anyway, Ruehe said. He 
is confident regarding the further discussion; he feels "very 
much supported" by his party. CDU/CSU circles said that the 
decision by the coalition representatives was surprising after 
the FDP had signalled basic agreement after talks with Ruehe 
over the past few days. 
  The German Bundeswehr Association has meanwhile called the 
minister's ideas "well founded." In the future, too, the army 
will be large enough to fulfill its tasks, Association Manager 
Bernhard Gertz said on Deutschlandradio Berlin. 
  In the response to a parliamentary inquiry by the Party of 
Democratic Socialism, the Federal Government stated on Monday 
that about 169,000 recruits were drafted for basic military 
service last year.

  [Text] Bonn (DPA) -- FRG Finance Minister Theo Waigel 
(Christian Social Union) now sees the beginning of a lasting 
economic upswing in the FRG. At the beginning of a Bundestag 
debate on the latest spring report by the economic research 
institutes on Thursday [28 April], the finance minister 
rejected, however, the institutes' demand for a real easing of 
the tax burden on the companies to support economic growth. 
Such pre-financing models are out of the question, the finance 
minister said. There will not be any tax reductions "on tick." 
  However, the corporate tax reform and the easing of the 
burden on families must not be postponed, Waigel announced. 
This will be financed by the reduction of possibilities for tax 
write-offs. Pointing to the latest discussions of the industrial 
countries in Washington, the deliberations of the East Europe 
Bank in St. Petersburg, Russia, and the German-British summit, 
Waigel stressed that it is internationally recognized that 
Germany, like Japan, has achieved the greatest success in 
reducing the structural deficits. Thus, the FRG will also 
fulfill the criteria for entering the third stage of the 
European Monetary Union with a common currency in time. 
  Hans-Ulrich Klose, chairman of the Social Democratic Party 
of 
Germany Bundestag group, on the other hand, stated that the 
economic engine is "still just crawling ahead." The structural 
problems of the country have not changed. The report confirms 
the "chancellor's failure" in shaping the economy and in 
reducing the high unemployment. The growth for all of Germany 
of 1.5 percent, which the institutes mentioned, is a swallow, 
but one swallow does not make a spring. Klose called for a 
supplementary tax that spares the lower income groups, as well 
as for renouncing the solidarity surcharge for all people 
eligible to pay tax.

  [Text] Nuremberg (DPA) -- The city of Nuremberg has banned 
an election campaign rally of the radical right-wing 
Republikaner. Two counterdemonstrations in the city center, 
which had also been registered for Saturday [30 April], have 
also been prohibited. Directives to this effect were issued by 
the city's public order office on Tuesday, on the instructions 
of Nuremberg Mayor Peter Schoenlein (of the Social Democratic 
Party of Germany). Schoenlein argued that the planned rally on 
the eve of 1 May was more and more becoming an "explosive danger 
for the city's internal security and its good reputation," since 
one had to expect the rally to take a violence course.

  [Text] Dusseldorf -- In the view of the North 
Rhine-Westphalian Interior Minister Herbert Schnoor (Social 
Democratic Party), the Republikaner are currently the most 
dangerous party in the right-wing extremist camp. On presenting 
his land's report on the protection of the constitution in 
Dusseldorf on Wednesday [27 April], Schnoor pointed out that the 
party is using a middle-class camouflage, while relying more 
than ever on xenophobic propaganda. Individual members are even 
prepared to use violence against foreigners. 
  While stating that the Republikaner tend toward right-wing 
extremism, Federal Interior Minister Manfred Kanther (Christian 
Democratic Union) on the other hand, merely called them a 
right-wing radical group recently. 
  According to Schnoor, in the run-up to the elections the 
Republikaner are increasingly joined by new members sharing a 
firm right-wing extremist view of the world. Last year, they 
increased their membership in North Rhine-Westphalia from 2,100 
to 2,500. The constitution protection report speaks of a total 
of 25 right-wing extremist and neo-Nazi parties and groups with 
a membership of 9,200 in 1993. The previous year there had been 
23 organizations with 8,800 members. The biggest right-wing 
extremist party is the German People's Union with 5,000 members. 
  The number of politically motivated incidences of violence 
in 
North Rhine-Westphalia shows a large increase. Last year, there 
were a total of 827 acts of violence carried out against a 
political background, which is almost 20 percent more than in 
1992, Schnoor said. Xenophobia was the motive for more than 50 
percent of all attacks.

  [Text] Bonn (DPA) -- In possible coalition negotiations 
with the Social Democratic Party of Germany [SPD] after the 
Bundestag election, the Alliance 90/Greens will insist on the 
abandonment of nuclear energy, possibly within two years. It 
will not be easy to push this through, but it is economically 
and technically possible, Ludger Volmer, spokesman of the 
Federal Executive Committee, said before journalists in Bonn on 
Tuesday [26 April] on the occasion of the eighth anniversary of 
the nuclear catastrophe at Chernobyl. One can build on the 1986 
SPD decision to abandon nuclear power within 10 years. 
  Volmer and his party friends Klaus-Dieter Feige and Manfred 
Busch affirmed the call for the immediate shutdown of all 
Chernobyl-type reactors, which are the most dangerous timebombs 
in East Europe. Retrofitting measures that cost billions 
[currency not specified] would not reduce the risk of a new 
catastrophe. New energy policy priorities have to be set. The 
abandonment of nuclear energy in Germany can break existing 
barriers and initiate an energy policy throughout Europe that is 
oriented toward ecological restraint, it was stated.

  [Text] Bonn (DPA) -- Orders received in east German 
industry increased in value by 4.2 percent in February compared 
with the previous month and by 23.9 percent compared with the 
same month last year. The demand was supported by domestic 
customers, whose orders increased by 10.5 percent -- not 
seasonally adjusted -- compared with January, while foreign 
orders declined considerably, by 29 percent, the FRG Economics 
Ministry reported in Bonn on Wednesday [27 April]. In January 
orders to the manufacturing industry had declined by 8.7 percent 
overall, including 18.9 percent for investment goods. In 
February this sector experienced the strongest increase with a 
gain of 11.2 percent. The consumer goods industry registered an 
increase in orders by 3.3 percent, while 9.5 percent fewer 
orders were received in the basic material and producer goods 
industry. 
  Comparing the two months of January and February with 
November and December 1993, orders declined by 3.5 percent -- 
domestic orders by 1 percent and foreign orders by 17.5 percent. 
Compared with January and February 1993, on the other hand, 
orders rose clearly by 24.9 percent.

<F P=106> [Unattributed article: "Vatican/Rwanda: Vatican Proposes </F>
International Peace Talks"] 
  [Text] (ANSA) Vatican City, April 27 -- The Vatican on 
Wednesday [27 April] asked that an international peace 
conference on Rwanda be organized, to be attended by the two 
rival tribes in the central African country, the heads of state 
of neighboring countries and the Western countries most involved 
or interested in the region's development. 
  The appeal was issued by the Vatican's "Cor Unum" Papal 
Council, which is headed by Roger Etchegaray and deals with 
relations between Catholic organizations and international aid 
bodies. 
  In its statement, the council also urged the international 
community "to intensify its presence in the field and diplomatic 
mediation, since one cannot remain indifferent or passive in the 
face of this genocide." 
  Cor Unum officials on April 25 met officials from about 30 
Catholic organizations and from the United Nations High 
Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) to discuss ways and means of 
allowing relief aid to reach Rwandan refugees who are fleeing 
attacks from Hutu and Tutsi tribes. 
  "To understand the seriousness of the conflict," the 
Vatican's statement said, "one must remember that the largest 
exodus is taking place since the Gulf War, involving hundreds of 
thousands of people in flight. Victims are innumerable, 
especially among civilians."

<F P=106> [Unattributed article: "Berlusconi Message of U.S. Forza </F>
Italia Clubs"] 
  [Text] (ANSA) New York, April 26 -- A guarantee that a new 
Italian coalition government led by Forza Italia would be in the 
centre was given late last night by phone from its leader Silvio 
Berlusconi in his message to American Forza Italia convention in 
New York. 
  Speaking from Milan, the Italian media magnate told the 
American National Association of Forza Italia Clubs (ANFIA), "I 
have read many articles from the United States that depict us as 
being a rightist coalition sustained by neo-fascists.... I want 
to assure you that Forza Italia is the pivot of the coalition. 
We are leading it and our presence guarantees that it is in the 
centre." 
  Berlusconi, tipped to be the next premier, went on to tell 
his supporters, gathered here to inaugurate the official 
founding of ANFIA at the Mayfair Baglioni Hotel, how the 
contribution of the American people will play a role in the 
foreign policy of his eventual government. 
  Representing Berlusconi at the convention was newly elected 
MP Mauro Bortoloso, who spoke of Forza Italia's commitment to 
extending the vote to Italian expatriates. In order to make 
such a vote more valid, he added, it was necessary to correct 
the way events in Italy have been presented abroad. 
  There are an estimated eighty full members of the three 
Forza 
Italia Clubs presently established in New York, New Jersey and 
Connecticut. The role of the association, as explained by 
general secretary Roberto Comelli, is to make a direct appeal to 
Italians in America "to build an efficient community, an 
authoritative partner to give efficient support to a winning 
Italy." It is hoped that eventually 100 clubs will soon be set 
up in New York state alone. 
  While in New York, Bortoloso led a Forza Italia delegation 
which made stops at City Hall and the World Trade Center, for 
discussion with various American political figures of Italian 
descent.

<F P=106> [Unattributed report on Spanish Prime Minister Felipe </F>
Gonzalez' 19 April "state of the nation" speech in parliament 
building in Madrid: "The Debate: Gonzalez' Speech"] 
  [Text] 
<H8>  Corruption </H8>
<H5>  "Six Promises in Six Minutes" </H5>
  Felipe Gonzalez yesterday turned corruption into a preamble 
of just six minutes to his state of the nation speech. Before 
analyzing the economic crisis, the impetus to autonomy, the 
democratic impetus, and Europe, Gonzalez laid down his stance on 
former Bank of Spain Governor Mariano Rubio and former Civil 
Guard Director General Luis Roldan. 
  "I wish to lay down the government's stance on the 
accusations of corruption which have appeared over the past few 
weeks, creating an atmosphere of great concern among the public. 
In the election campaign, we promised to act vigorously and 
energetically against the corruption cases which might arise, 
trying to remove from public life those people who through their 
conduct did not deserve the trust placed in them. We also want 
the law to act with due dispatch to clarify matters which may be 
criminal and correspondingly to elucidate responsibilities.... 
  ``The government, fully accepting its responsibilities, 
deems 
it essential to tackle these problems and restore social 
confidence. It is true that we are experiencing an atmosphere of 
distrust, and even the danger of disaffection with democratic 
values, weakening the ability to meet the challenges of the 
crisis. In the case of the former Civil Guard director general, 
a committee of enquiry has been set up in parliament. We have 
handed over the material which will make it possible to clarify 
the matters which are the committee's purpose, and so we will 
act in any case that arises. We hope that with the utmost 
dispatch it will reach conclusions which will enable us to see 
clearly the problems reported in parliament's proper sphere. At 
the same time, the law will elucidate whatever responsibilities 
there were, and the tax inspectorate has been acting, gentlemen, 
to the same end over the past few months.... 
  "The setting up of another committee for the case of the 
former Bank of Spain governor has also been requested by several 
parliamentary groups, including our own. In this matter, too, 
we have acted promptly and vigorously. I regard this case as 
extremely important, and deem myself directly concerned by it in 
having proposed his appointment and having supported the former 
governor's honor at the time of the Ibercorps crisis. We have 
tried unsuccessfully to induce the former governor to explain to 
the public whether the accusations leveled against him are true 
or not, whether or not he kept money concealed, whether or not 
he fulfilled his tax obligations, and so forth. Not even his 
appearance before the Economy and Finance Committee last Friday, 
which we ourselves requested, has served to clarify his conduct." 
<H5>  Elucidate Responsibilities </H5>
  "At the same time, we have urged the government attorney's 
office to act immediately, having placed all the material and 
human resources at its disposal, and we have set the tax 
inspectorate to work to investigate thoroughly and elucidate 
responsibilities in its proper sphere. I must inform the house 
that even before this parliament began its proceedings, the 
government attorney's office and the tax inspectorate had 
already done so. 
  ``We deem it desirable to improve the conditions and the 
legal and instrumental resources to combat the phenomenon of 
corruption in the rule-of-law state in which we live. So we are 
not only prepared to amend this house's standing orders in order 
to facilitate the investigation of these matters; we will 
introduce, as we have promised, some changes in the rules, and 
are willing to study the proposals which the groups may make. 
  ``In the first place, we will propose amending the law on 
the 
National Audit Office in order to widen its area of 
responsibility and to increase the office's means of monitoring 
and oversight. 
  ``Second, we will immediately introduce a more complete and 
strict classification of conduct connected with corruption 
offenses and greater severity in the penalties to be imposed in 
amending the penal code. 
  ``Third, we will increase efficiency in the judicial 
response 
through procedural reforms. 
  ``Fourth, we will propose setting up a special attorney's 
office charged with prosecuting economic and corruption offenses. 
  ``Fifth, we will set up a specific group in the General 
Directorate of the State Legal Service, charged with defending 
the public treasury's interests by taking part in any judicial 
proceedings for offenses of this nature. 
  ``To this must be added the plan to amend the General Budget 
Law, which will strengthen economic and financial oversight of 
the public sector through mechanisms which will make possible 
greater effectiveness in the examination of the Auditor 
General's Office's audits and, where appropriate, elucidating 
the corresponding political and administrative responsibilities. 
These proposals are strengthened by the strong social 
condemnation of corruption.'' 
<H8>  Economic Crisis </H8>
<H5>  "Trend Reversed" </H5>
  ``In this period, the government's activity as a whole has 
pursued as its main aim surmounting the crisis with a view to 
job creation.... Achieving this aim requires emerging from the 
economic crisis which has affected Spain and the whole of Europe 
over the past two years, and also emerging from it vigorously 
and confidently.... 
  ``During the past nine months, the recessionary trend has 
been reversed, thanks to our economy's ability to respond, the 
efforts of many employers and workers, and, overall, the 
appropriate policy which we have been implementing.... 
  ``The Budgets Law, the Fiscal and Financial Measures Law, 
and 
the package of reforms of the labor market are the most 
important measures of the past nine months.... 
  ``Our exchange rate has been put at levels more consistent 
with our economy's basic characteristics.... Interest 
rates...have fallen by over 5 percent.... 
  ``With respect to inflation,...this year's figures are 
encouraging.... The public deficit showed considerable strains 
in 1992, was very high in 1993, and is forecast to remain high 
in 1994.... 
  ``(Foreign investment) will remain here insofar as 
conditions 
of competitiveness are right.... 
  ``The social security pensions system is viable, makes it 
possible to fund current pensions, and will also make it 
possible to fund future pensions....'' 
<H8>  Impetus </H8>
<H5>  Autonomous Communities </H5>
  "We have now spent a good number of years in the process of 
building them; a dynamic process which has changed the 
distribution of power and the exercise of political activity in 
our country. It is a process which neither can nor should stop, 
but one in which it is perfectly desirable and possible to move 
forward if we are guided by loyalty, territorial balance, and 
solidarity. The aim is a more decentralized, more effective 
state, closer to citizens -- a state of autonomous communities 
-- with which to face the 21st century. 
  ``...The government's proposal (on the implementation of 
autonomy) is meant to take shape in a joint interpretation of 
the [autonomy] statutes, which, within the framework of the 
consequent bilateral relations and the Constitutional Court's 
jurisprudence, will make it possible to define by mutual 
agreement the scope of the sections on powers contained in the 
statutes.'' 
<H5>  Democracy </H5>
  "All the other groups (except the People's Party) have 
proposed to this house the election of a candidate for the post 
of ombudsman; a proposal which, as you gentlemen know, will be 
voted on next week. If the People's Party group's (blocking) 
stance changes, and this election goes through, we will be able 
immediately and with the greatest possible agreement to set 
about filling the other vacancies in the institutional bodies, 
including the Spanish Radio and Television System board. 
  ``However, if the current situation continues, the 
government will immediately propose to the parliamentary groups 
that we start studying amending the legal rules, with the aim, 
while always ensuring a high level of agreement, of surmounting 
the insurmountable obstacle posed by a political party's 
deciding to practice an institutional blockage.'' 
<H8>  Europe </H8>
<H5>  "Our Viewpoint Counts" </H5>
  ``The entry into force of the treaty on European union, the 
approval of the European initiative on growth and employment, 
the white paper on growth, competitiveness, and employment, and 
the negotiations on the Union's enlargement are developments 
which decisively influence Spanish life. 
  ``Our future as a country is linked to the European Union's 
future, and we will therefore continue to strive to ensure that 
the political project of integration develops effectively for 
the whole, but also satisfactorily for Spanish interests.... 
  ``We must continue with our task of convergence with the 
other countries in Economic and Monetary Union.... The fact 
that some doubts about timetables or dates have arisen should be 
no cause for concern.... 
  ``No country is able today to surmount the economic crisis 
in 
isolation. In an interdependent world such as ours, the 
solution to the crisis must necessarily be a European 
solution.... In order to adopt a policy of economic revival, to 
take decisions on the major infrastructures which must be 
tackled in the future, and in order to design policies such as 
environmental policy, the European sphere is a more appropriate 
sphere than the national spheres. Spain aims increasingly not 
just to be in Europe but to count in Europe, and to play the 
role which befits it as one of the major European countries.... 
Our viewpoint counts increasingly in Europe....''

<F P=106> [Article by Victorino Ruiz de Azua: "Aznar Leaves Gonzalez </F>
Only One Choice: `Go!'"] 
  [Text] Madrid -- Responsibility, responsibilities, 
responsible. People's Party Chairman Jose Maria Aznar rang the 
changes on the word at least 49 times in his one-hour speech [at 
the 19 April Congress of Deputies state of the nation debate], 
and constantly applied it to head of government Felipe Gonzalez, 
in order to conclude: "Go!" According to the People's Party 
leader, Gonzalez, with his credibility ruined, has no honorable 
solution left except to "tender his resignation to the king," 
and advise King Juan Carlos on the Socialist who should succeed 
him in the government. Aznar, however, avoided referring to a 
censure motion or calling for a vote of confidence, and made it 
quite clear that he does not want an early election now. 
  Gonzalez found grounds in Aznar's reply for making his 
message clearer. He is not prepared to resign, and his 
intention is to complete the legislative term. Aznar chose a 
tactic of wearing down his opponent, but striving to emphasize 
that he is in no hurry to attain power through an early 
election. His role was rather that of somebody seeking to take 
up the general dissatisfaction and strengthen himself as an 
alternative. 
  In his speech, he left no room for pity: "What will be the 
next scandal, Mr. Gonzalez? What extremes have we had to go to 
for this question alone to sum up the state of the nation?" 
That was the beginning, and the end was the resignation call. 
In between, there was a lengthy reflection full of direct 
questions to the prime minister and recollections of the 
rejections of and votes against committees of enquiry which 
Gonzalez and the Spanish Socialist Workers Party have reeled off 
over the past few years. 
  He argued that the head of government, through his 
passivity, 
has encouraged the impression of impunity and contributed to the 
current atmosphere. As a result, according to Aznar, Gonzalez 
is not only politically responsible for the appointment of 
alleged corrupt people as chiefs of the Civil Guard or the Bank 
of Spain, but also "is too late, even to wash his own face." 
  In the People's Party leader's opinion, the promises to 
investigate the Roldan or Rubio affairs now are just an attempt 
to ensure that the responsibility falls on "a scapegoat, whom 
(the Socialists) attack with the fury of the convert." 
  Aznar emphasized that parliament should speak not of the 
culprits -- a task for the courts -- but of the individuals 
responsibile for making the appointments and who now should 
answer for the appointees' misconduct. "It is you," he 
concluded, looking at Gonzalez's seat, "who are responsible for 
helping to create the most unbreathable moral atmosphere of our 
recent history." 
  Aware that Gonzalez's weak spot is credibility, the People's 
Party leader rubbed salt into the same wound in the second 
section of his speech, devoted to deriding the announcements of 
economic recovery. 
  Aznar concluded by denying Gonzalez even the ability to 
maintain political stability, which is threatened by the 
atmosphere of public distrust about corruption, and said that he 
can no longer correct matters. As long as he he stays in power, 
"we can expect no sincerity, no solution." Hence, according to 
the People's Party chairman, his responsibility is to resign and 
hand over his post to another Socialist. 
  Gonzalez opted for taking up the gauntlet and replying to 
Aznar immediately, without waiting for speeches by the other 
spokesmen. Much livelier than in the morning, the head of 
government accused the People's Party chairman of delivering 
tirades without saying "anything at all" about what can be done 
with the country. Determined to strike back, the head of 
government cited the prosecution of Miguel Perez Villar, Aznar's 
former councillor in Castille and Leon, for the alleged 
irregular granting of public aid, and asked who takes political 
responsibility for his appointment. 
  In a parliamentary "look who's talking" gesture, Aznar 
rejoined that his party voted for the establishment of a 
committee of enquiry in the parliament of Castille and Leon, and 
called for one in the Congress over the Naseiro affair, but the 
Socialists voted against. Gonzalez recalled that the People's 
Party voted against the application [for lifting parliamentary 
immunity] of deputy Sanchis, involved in that affair. Aznar 
announced that his group will call for a committee to 
investigate the Filesa affair (the application will be submitted 
at the registry this very morning), and Gonzalez warned him that 
perhaps he will be surprised if the Socialists accept it and 
propose extending it.

<F P=106> [Unattributed report: "Anguita Calls On Prime Minister To </F>
Take Responsibility and Go"] 
  [Text] Madrid -- United Left leader Julio Anguita endorsed 
[People's Party Chairman] Jose Maria Aznar's proposal [issued 19 
April during the Congress of Deputies state of nation debate], 
which explicitly called on Felipe Gonzalez to resign as prime 
minister. Anguita also enlarged on the idea already expressed 
by him on other occasions of demanding a policy of democratic 
economic planning, and asserted the need to meet the challenge 
of transforming Spain into a federal state. 
  The United Left-Initiative for Catalonia leader asserted 
that 
the current situation necessitates "making a decision," and 
added that he is convinced that on the Socialist benches "there 
will be somebody capable of taking up the mandate which his 
political force received in the polls last 6 June." In 
Anguita's opinion, Gonzalez's resignation, which he demanded 
"quite calmly but with complete responsibility," "is necessary." 
  Anguita described a scene marked by "economic disorder, 
social disorder, political disorder, moral disorder, and ethical 
disorder." From there he leapt to the demand for Gonzalez's 
resignation, and immediately asserted that his group calls for 
"hope" and "optimism." Anguita continued in that tone, openly 
addressing the public, not just the house, in dwelling on his 
call "for courage." 
  He then tackled the problem of the reform of economic 
policy, 
and, taking as his basis Article 128 of the Constitution ("All 
the country's wealth in its various forms, regardless of its 
ownership, is subordinate to the general interest"), he 
proceeded to explain the need to get under way the democratic 
planning of the economy. In Anguita's opinion, this means "the 
management of collective demand, meeting basic needs in housing, 
public transport, health, and education," and performing, he 
said, "the task of a compass and guide for private enterprise." 
<H5>  Public Sector </H5>
  So that no doubts would be left about his overall view of 
the 
economy through planning, he deemed it essential to link to this 
"a boost for a strong democratized public sector." In this 
field he took specific steps in saying that a strong public 
sector is also necessary for the financial system, and "would 
begin with an immediate halt to the privatization of Argentaria, 
making it the financial driving force for the small- and 
medium-sized enterprises and cooperatives." 
  He took yet another step in spelling out his economic 
proposals in asserting from the rostrum the need for "the 
Argentaria corporation to purchase Banesto [Credit Bank of 
Spain]," and rejecting independence for the Bank of Spain, a 
bill approved by parliament. 
  The last feature of his economic policy was to demand "the 
workers full participation in business decisions which affect 
them, especially with respect to setting up compulsory 
investment funds to channel part of business profits into job 
creation." 
  Anguita did not abandon his stance of radical reforms, and 
tackled the need to build a federal state, convinced, he said, 
"that building that state on the basis of the existing 
constitutional situation is a matter of acceptance, commitment, 
and supportive action." 
  The United Left leader admitted that that federal state 
would 
entail, among other things, an extensive reorganization of local 
administration and turning the Senate into a house of 
territorial representation, and he added the concomitant of 
"Armed Forces based on the professional status of all their 
members." 
  Anguita delved into Europe, with new proposals for complete 
change. He himself asserted that "a radical change" is needed 
in the building of Europe. 
  He concluded with a number of proposals for transforming 
current political conduct, the "obscure foundations of which 
underpin corruption." Anguita said it is necessary to reform 
the electoral system, the Congress and the Senate, Justice, the 
National Audit Office and parliamentary oversight of public 
expenditure, the election of the institutions' bodies, the 
Economic and Social Council, the Spanish Radio and Television 
System charter, the public administrations, and the funding of 
parties.

<F P=106> [Juan G. Ibanez report: "Roca Warns Socialists That He Will </F>
Withdraw His Support From Them Unless Corruption Is Thoroughly 
Combated"] 
  [Text] Madrid -- Miquel Roca yesterday gave Felipe 
Gonzalez the fuel for the government to carry on, but he warned 
him that that assistance could end unless the Socialists are 
able to use it correctly right now, namely to make every effort 
to combat corruption. He held the government responsible for 
success or failure in that task. CiU [Convergence and Union] 
thus made it clear that it stands by its parliamentary pact with 
the PSOE [Spanish Socialist Workers Party], but also that it 
could soon be broken off if the Socialists do not regain their 
credibility. 
  The CiU spokesman based his [Congress of Deputies] state of 
the nation speech on confidence and hope -- confidence because 
of the perceptible signs of economic recovery, and hope that the 
Socialists will prevent corruption from handicapping recovery. 
  Roca confronted Gonzalez with evidence that the confidence 
in 
the government, which is essential for investments and job 
creation, "has been seriously eroded." "In order to restore 
that confidence," he told him, "you, Mr. Prime Minister, must 
convince society that the struggle against any instance of 
corruption will be led and directed by the government itself; 
that you, Mr. Prime Minister, accept full responsibility for 
this action." 
  Roca was very cautious in describing the current corruption 
scandals -- "a disturbing and irritating phenomenon" -- but was 
emphatic in his warning to the government about the Catalan 
nationalists' support for the PSOE. When calling on Gonzalez to 
regain day by day his now weakened credibility, he warned him: 
"For this you will not lack the necessary stability, but you 
could lack it if you do not achieve this." 
  Roca, who did not miss the opportunity to proclaim that none 
of the improvements in the economic situation is unconnected 
with CiU's initiative or cooperation, asserted the urgent need 
for a new urban rents law and the urgent implementation of the 
labor reform, and the need to amend the social security system 
and to modernize and streamline the functioning of the 
administration of justice. 
<H5>  Slowness and Impunity </H5>
  With respect to corruption, he said that slowness is a party 
to impunity. Accordingly, he proposed that Congress define a 
shortened legal procedure which, without detriment to legal and 
procedural safeguards, would ensure rapid handling of corruption 
cases. "Society should learn quickly whether or a not a report 
is well-founded; it should know whether the report is untrue or 
if corruption is a fact," Roca stated. 
  The CiU spokesman also proposed making it a requirement that 
before taking office, those holding public posts of some 
importance be examined by a parliamentary committee on their 
professional and personal careers. Last, in view of the biased 
leaks concerning the debates of the committees of enquiry, he 
proposed that they cease to be secret. 
  Roca's speech was applauded by several Socialist deputies 
and 
received in silence by his group colleagues, which caused 
laughter among the People's Party seats.

<F P=106> [Announcer-read report over video] </F>
  [Text] Foreign Minister Hikmet Cetin has asked the UN 
Security Council to lift the arms embargo imposed on the Muslims 
of Bosnia-Herzegovina. After attending the meeting of the 
Islamic Conference Organization's [ICO] Bosnia-Herzegovina 
Contact Group, Cetin addressed the Security Council. 
  Cetin said that the Muslims in Bosnia-Herzegovina are trying 
to defend themselves and democracy, adding that Security Council 
Resolution 713 regarding the embargo cannot and should not be 
enforced with regard to Bosnia-Herzegovina. Pointing out that 
the interference with this right is encouraging Serbian 
aggression, Cetin added that the world public should learn from 
the recent developments in Gorazde. He noted that the embargo 
on the aggressor should be strengthened and that diplomatic 
pressure should be applied to the Serbs. Stressing that the 
defeat of the United Nations in Bosnia-Herzegovina would 
adversely affect the Balkans, Europe, and the entire world, 
Cetin added that one cannot remain impartial when one side is 
the aggressor and the other the victim. Cetin said: The 
aggressor understands only harshness and fierceness. How can we 
create an atmosphere conducive to peace talks if we leave the 
Bosnians undefended? 
  Cetin said the NATO decisions should be implemented 
immediately in order to defend the safe havens in 
Bosnia-Herzegovina. Recalling that Bosnia-Herzegovina is not 
made up of only safe havens, Cetin added that these regions 
should not be turned into open prisons. He noted that the time 
has come for the Security Council to prevent the ethnic 
cleansing in Bosnia-Herzegovina. 
  Cetin stated that following the first NATO ultimatum 
concerning Sarajevo, Turkey asked that it be extended to cover 
the other safe havens. Condemning the Serbian genocide against 
the Bosnians and pointing out that the Serb attacks on Gorazde 
are aimed at testing the effectiveness of the United Nations, 
Cetin recalled that Turkey's efforts to raise this issue did not 
yield any results. He further welcomed last night's Security 
Council resolution on the reinforcement of the peacekeeping 
forces in former Yugoslavia. 
  Expressing Turkey's wish to begin high level talks on the 
issue of Bosnia-Herzegovina, Cetin noted the need to invite the 
ICO Contact Group to such a conference. Pointing out that 
Turkey will continue to assist the Bosnians, Cetin concluded by 
saying that from the very start, Turkey has supported the idea 
of securing a just and lasting peace in Bosnia-Herzegovina 
through negotiations. 
  After the Security Council meeting, Cetin left New York for 
Turkey.

  [Text] Brussels, April 27 (AFP) -- The EU [European Union] 
was considering Wednesday [27 April] contributing to the 
construction of two new nuclear reactors in Ukraine if Kiev shut 
down completely the Chernobyl plant, the European Commission 
said. 
  A Commission spokesman said the 12-member European Union was 
considering the move as one of a series of aid options for 
Ukraine proposed by the EU's executive. 
  The building of the two new reactors would take years, the 
Commission said, adding that the proposal envisaged financing to 
ensure the gradual decommissioning of the two reactors still 
operating at Chernobyl, the scene of the world's worst peacetime 
nuclear catastrophe in April 1986. 
  The remaining reactors are responsible for around 7 percent 
of Ukraine's energy production. 
  The Commission wants the two reactors to be phased out, 
along 
with an assurance that a third reactor at Chernobyl, shut down 
last year after a major fire, will not be reopened. 
  On Monday in Moscow Ukrainian President Leonid Kravchuk 
warned that only foreign aid and alternative energy sources 
could secure the closure of Chernobyl nuclear plant. 
  The same day French Environment Minister Michel Barnier had 
pleaded for the partially crippled power station to be shut down. 
  Barnier said Chernobyl's number four reactor -- which 
exploded eight years ago -- urgently needed to be topped off 
with a second protective bunker. 
  But Kravchuk said that Ukraine alone was incapable of 
funding 
the closure of the complex. 
  "The West only provides helpful slogans and has yet to give 
us the financing it has promised," he said, adding that, unless 
the security of the whole complex could be guaranteed, "Europe 
will find itself under threat of another misfortune." 
  In 1992 and 1993, the EU accorded Ukraine a total of 61 
million dollars to fund staff training programmes and additional 
security measures in the country's nuclear power sector. 
  Wednesday's Chernobyl offer was one of a package of 
proposals 
to shore up Ukraine's battered economy covering the agricultural 
and nuclear energy sectors. 
  Funding for the programme could be cleared rapidly if it is 
approved at an EU meeting May 16 and 17, the Commission 
spokesman said.

<F P=106> [By Jacques Hasday] </F>
  [Text] Mons, Belgium, April 28 (AFP) -- The squat green 
pre-fab was a Cold War HQ, where the United States, France and 
Britain planned to fight a Soviet blockade of Berlin which could 
have sparked World War Three. 
  That was the old Europe. But on Thursday [28 April] the 
building became the first home for an ambitious programme to get 
the military machines of the former Cold War enemies working 
together for peace instead of planning war. 
  "From today this building will represent a new NATO and a 
new 
Europe," said U.S. General George Joulwan, supreme commander of 
NATO forces in Europe, as he inaugurated the temporary 
headquarters of the Partnership for Peace programme. 
  The pre-fab faces a monument comprising a large piece of the 
Berlin Wall, which officially ended the Cold War when it 
crumbled in 1989. 
  The so-called coordination cell is located at the Supreme 
Headquarters Allied Powers in Europe (SHAPE), nerve centre of 
the North Atlantic Treaty Organisation. 
  Fourteen countries have joined the Partnership since it was 
announced in January, most of them hoping that it will be a 
half-way house to membership of NATO. Poland and Romania have 
already submitted detailed working programmes. 
  One by one, during the ceremony, the name of each new member 
was called out and its flag displayed. 
  In order of joining, they are Romania, Lithuania, Poland, 
Estonia, Hungary, Ukraine, Slovakia, Bulgaria, Latvia, Albania, 
the Czech Republic, Moldova, Georgia and Slovenia. 
  Russia was absent but NATO's deputy secretary general, 
Sergio 
Silvio Balanzino, said he hoped it would join the Partnership 
before the end of the European summer. 
  Joulwan told journalists: "We look forward to working with 
the Russian military." NATO regards Russia as a big catch for 
the Partnership. But Moscow has blown hot and cold over the 
past month. 
  First it said it wanted a better deal more appropriate to 
its 
big-power status, then cancelled a signing date last week in 
apparent irritation over NATO air strikes against Bosnian Serbs 
in Bosnia-Herzegovina two weeks ago. 
  NATO officials now believe that the Russians will join soon, 
in line with Moscow's new partnership with the United States and 
the European Union in the search for a peaceful settlement in 
Bosnia. 
  Partnership for Peace is a flexible programme ranging from 
simple military training and advice to participation in 
full-scale military manoeuvres and peace-keeping exercises, 
depending on what each country can manage and afford. 
  Thus, each country will be asked to pay a "reasonable rent" 
for their place in the green pre-fab, known as "Live Oak," where 
joint manoeuvres and other exercises will be planned. 
  "Live Oak" has done a lot of travelling since it was first 
erected in 1959 as a headquarters for U.S., French and British 
preparations to counter a second Soviet blockade of Berlin 
expected in the late 1950's. 
  It was first put up in 1959 at Saint-Germain-en-Laye, near 
Paris, then moved to nearby Rocquencourt in 1961, then to Mons 
in 1967. Joulwan called it "the symbol of old divisions of 
Europe."

  [Text] Today, at NATO headquarters in Brussels, Mr. 
Gheorghe Tinca, Romania's minister of national defense, handed 
over Romania's presentation document regarding our country's 
concrete participation in the Partnership for Peace [PFP] scheme 
to Mr. Sergio Silvio Balanzino, NATO delegate secretary general. 
The document basically lists the measures being adopted by 
Romania to achieve the political goals of the Partnership as 
well as the means and activities envisaged to implement the PFP 
program. 
  On the occasion of the submission of the presentation 
document, Mr. Tinca and Mr. Balanzino had an almost 40-minute 
meeting devoted to relations between our country and NATO and to 
the prospects of bilateral cooperation, including within the 
framework of the positive implementation of the PFP. 
  During the talks, the sides assessed the contents of the 
document, which will now be examined by the North Atlantic 
alliance. Negotiations will be held with the Romanian delegation 
in the next few weeks, after which NATO will submit its own 
contribution to this cooperation. A program for a bilateral 
partnership will be worked out between Romania and NATO. The 
NATO delegate secretary general praised our country's presence 
in the front-ranking group, since Romania was the first country 
to sign the Partnership document and submitted the presentation 
document two days after Poland. This is proof of our country's 
seriousness on this matter. 
  After the document was handed over, the NATO delegate 
secretary general and the Romanian minister of national defense 
had a brief meeting with the press. On this occasion, they 
emphasized the significance of this political act, which 
reiterates Romania's active commitment to ensuring the success 
of the PFP program as well as our country's firm desire to 
deepen its integration into the political and military 
structures of the North Atlantic alliance. This report has been 
sent to us by press correspondent Andrei Barsan.

<F P=106> [Report signed BBR/CA: "Dehaene `Wants To Succeed Delors'"] </F>
  [Excerpt] During a talk with Herman Van Rompuy, deputy 
prime minister and budget minister (of the CVP [Flemish 
Christian People's Party]), and CVP Chairman Johan Van Hecke, 
Jean-Luc Dehaene expressed his wish "to succeed Jacques Delors 
as president of the European Commission (EC)." DE MORGEN 
learned this yesterday from senior government circles. So far, 
Dehaene has left it up in the air as to whether he was 
interested in or had been asked to be the EC president, uttering 
only a sharp "no comment." 
  The report that the Germans and French had expressed their 
preference for the Belgian prime minister appeared in THE 
GUARDIAN in early March and led to quite a bit of excitement in 
the government. Not only was it remarkable that the energetic 
approach of the nonconformist Dehaene in Europe was esteemed 
but, in addition, everyone knows that the current government is 
identified with the person of the prime minister. Replacing him 
would be a tough job and would seriously compromise the survival 
of the government. Delors' succession must take effect on 1 
January 1995, the government still has a bit less than a year to 
go. [passage omitted]

<F P=106> [Article by Rory Watson and Victor Smart: "Lubbers Falling </F>
Behind in Fight for Delors Crown"] 
  [Text] Belgian Prime Minister Jean-Luc Dehaene has taken a 
decisive lead in his battle with his Dutch counterpart Ruud 
Lubbers to succeed Jacques Delors as president of the European 
Commission. Both candidates, who are still formally undeclared, 
are firm but pragmatic federalists and would want to push ahead 
further and faster with Maastricht-style integration. 
  Dehaene has pulled ahead of his Dutch rival in the race to 
win the top job in Brussels and represent Europe on the world 
stage thanks to tokens of support from France and Germany. 
Senior sources in Copenhagen have revealed to THE EUROPEAN that 
Denmark is also throwing its weight behind the Belgian. 
  Meanwhile Britain, apparently fearful that it could end up 
backing a loser, now appears to be ready to swing behind Dehaene 
in spite of his strongly federalist views. Although London 
believes that Sir Leon Brittan, its senior European 
Commissioner, has the vision to acquit himself well in the job, 
the government has begun to recognise that as a former member of 
the Thatcher cabinet he is unlikely to win sufficient backing 
from Britain's European partners. 
  "We don't want to be seen to be vetoing Dehaene. He is 
becoming unstoppable," said one top British diplomat. Even so, 
such an endorsement will embarrass the British prime minister, 
who crossed swords with Dehaene recently in the row over the 
blocking minority in the Council of Ministers. Conservative MPs 
in Westminster are already angry that Delors' successor seems 
certain to share his enthusiasm for extending Brussels' powers. 
  Until recently Lubbers, 54, the Netherlands' longest serving 
prime minister and chairman of the European Summit which 
approved the Maastricht Treaty, had been seen as Delors' natural 
heir. But he has refused to throw his hat in the ring until the 
Dutch go to the polls on 3 May. He will then step down after 12 
years as the head of the government and leave the domestic 
political scene. 
  Lubbers' critics say he has lost Chancellor Kohl's support 
partly because he bent over backwards at Maastricht to placate 
the UK on the planned European social legislation and partly 
because he was hesitant in endorsing German reunification. 
  But Lubbers cohorts have not yet thrown in the towel. 
"Dehaene was only contacted by Kohl and President Mitterrand to 
ensure they had a second candidate in case Lubbers dropped out," 
predicted one Dutch commentator. "Lubbers cannot speak out now 
and will have to wait until after the election." 
  In the meantime Dehaene has been making the running. 
Variously nicknamed, the "bulldozer" or the "bomb disposal 
expert," he has reportedly told senior party colleagues: "If I 
am invited to become Commission president I will certainly not 
decline the offer." 
  The director general of GATT, Irishman Peter Sutherland, has 
announced that he will leave Geneva at the end of his current 
term of office in December, but he is seen very much as an 
outsider. In some European capitals, including London and 
Madrid, there is dismay that so few eligible candidates exist 
for the coveted role. "You would think that there might be 
some real choice but in the end only a couple of people stand a 
chance, and they have a virtually identical outlook," said a 
British diplomat. 
  Despite this, both Britain and Spain have been reassured by 
the background of Dehaene. He has a reputation of being a 
pragmatic federalist who wants to strengthen the EU [European 
Union]. But as a Christian Democrat used to surviving in 
coalition governments, he is seen as a conciliator. 
  Dehaene is also a far more clubbable individual than 
Lubbers, 
according to observers. As Commission presidents their styles 
would be different: the tenacious, table-thumping Dehaene 
compared with the more urbane Lubbers. 
  Above all, neither man is seen as such a powerful visionary 
as Delors, something that has made the Frenchman seem doubly 
dangerous in the eyes of Eurosceptics. 
  Nonetheless the selection of the ninth Commission president 
comes at a crucial time for the Union. First, the new man has 
to smooth the arrival of Austria and three Scandinavian 
countries into the EU. Even more perilous will be steering the 
EU through the minefield of the next phase of treaty reform in 
1996, a process which risks reopening the scars of the 
Maastricht Treaty debate. 
  This threatens to expose gaping wounds in the Union: two 
camps are already emerging between those like Germany and France 
who want a fresh dose of federalism and those like Britain who 
want to put the entire process into reverse. 
  The debate must be conducted not just with the groundswell 
of 
popular opposition Brussels apparently growing, but with Spain, 
Italy and Britain beginning to ask themselves against the use 
qualified majority voting which streamlines EU decision-making 
[sentence as published]. 
  Heads of government must come to a final choice on who is to 
follow Delors at the June Summit on Corfu. But if they are to 
avoid an almighty row, the decision will effectively be stitched 
up behind closed doors well before then. 
  After 10 years with a Socialist from a large country at the 
helm, the pendulum dictates that Delors' successor should be a 
Christian Democrat, even though only four EU members -- Germany, 
Luxembourg, Belgium and the Netherlands -- have Christian 
Democrats in power. 
  But in the complex three-dimensional chess of EU politics, 
the favourite does not always grab the prize. Ten years ago, 
the odds-on contender to become Commission president was the 
former European Commission French foreign minister and 
Anglophile Claude Cheysson. Britain's then prime minister 
Margaret Thatcher, vetoed him and gave her approval to the 
second choice, compromise candidate, Jacques Delors. The rest 
is history.

<F P=106> [Ian Mather article: "Self-Interest That Exposes Europe's </F>
Southern Flank"] 
  [Text] The European Union's [EU] continued refusal to 
tackle the explosion of violence in the Maghreb under its 
newly-created common foreign policy has awakened fears that 
Europe is dangerously neglecting its exposed southern flank. 
  Spain in particular is pressing the other EU states to make 
the Maghreb, which consists of Algeria, Morocco, Tunisia, Libya 
and Mauritania a priority for a co-ordinated EU initiative, 
warning that the Union could otherwise receive some nasty shocks. 
  The turmoil in North Africa has grown dramatically since 
last 
November when, under the Maastricht Treaty, a list of common 
foreign policy "joint actions" was defined. Even so most EU 
states, preoccupied with ex-Yugoslavia and the issue of Central 
and East Europe, remain reluctant to bring their weight behind 
attempts to solve the violence. 
  The latest ominous development is in Algeria, where most of 
France's remaining 2,000 nationals are fleeing a virtual civil 
war. Islamic fundamentalism, rooted in economic deprivation, is 
cutting a swathe right across North Africa. Algeria is the 
tinder box. If the fundamentalists win in Algeria, a bush fire 
could sweep away the other relatively stable governments of the 
Maghreb. 
  The Europe Union faces the threat of mass migration and the 
transplantation of terrorism on to European soil as well as the 
destruction of trading and political relations. That is why 
stability and prosperity in the Maghreb are vital for security, 
not just in the Mediterranean region, but throughout the EU. 
  When the European governments decided on their priorities 
for 
the common foreign and security policy inaugurated by the 
Maastricht Treaty, they decided to concentrate on the former 
Yugoslavia, Russia, the Middle East, South Africa and Somalia. 
The Maghreb was too close to home, and too many special 
national interests were involved. 
  Five years ago things looked more promising. A serious 
attempt was made by the European Commission to create a free 
trade area with the Maghreb, backed up by political ties. It 
was sparked by a letter from King Hassan of Morocco to the EC 
proposing Moroccan membership. The Commission said that the 
request could not be considered as Morocco was not a European 
country. 
  However, the idea took root that North Africa should be 
helped. In addition to providing aid for development efforts 
were to be made to build the economies of North African 
societies through small businesses in the hope of building a 
middle class. There was also to be help for debt repayments 
through a new development bank. 
  Two years ago, in its first formal declaration dealing with 
north Africa, the European Community at the Lisbon summit 
expressed its determination to foster "partnership" with the 
Maghreb. 
  But the free trade initiative has fizzled out, and nothing 
has come of the Lisbon declaration. The economic downturn in 
Europe led EU countries which had economic interests that 
conflicted with those of the Maghreb to pursue their own 
short-term advantage. 
  Spain was the first to ignore attempts towards free trade 
when it decided to protect its fishermen rather than agree to a 
fisheries pact with Morocco. Spain, concerned about its Canary 
Islands produce, then followed France in the GATT talks in 
forcing the EU to agree to a minimum entry price for vegetables 
and fruit at the Maghreb's expense. 
  Attempts are now under way to compensate Morocco, but 
Germany 
and Britain are opposing Spain's proposal to grant extra EU 
funds to support Morocco's balance of payments. 
  A bloc-to-bloc approach with the Maghreb Union, an economic 
group formed to negotiate trade agreements, is in any case 
impossible. Libya is excluded from any EU initiatives, because 
it is the target of sanctions resulting from the bombing of the 
Pan Am Boeing 747 over Lockerbie, Scotland, in which 270 people 
died. Moreover, Colonel al-Qadhdhafi seems to be losing his 
grip, leading to the fascinating idea that Europe might find 
itself bolstering his regime on the grounds that anything is 
preferable to anti-Western Islamic fundamentalism. 
  Mauritania is also ineligible for any deals with the EU 
because it gets separate benefits from the Lome Convention, 
which gives preferential trading terms with the EC to former 
colonies. But it is the most fragile country of all Algeria -- 
which is the case study of how the interests of individual EU 
nations continue to take precedence over a common EU foreign 
policy. The EU is split over Algeria. France, which as the 
former colonial power has most to gain from a return to 
stability, is pressing for a loan of $1billion to Algeria to 
help solve the balance of payments crisis. But Germany and 
Britain are sceptical about a loan they believe would delay 
economic reforms. 
  Tunisia has been struggling to make something meaningful out 
of the Maghreb Union. But even Tunisia will not be strong 
enough to be able to offer fully free trade with the EU until 
around 2010. There are still hopes of finalising partnership 
deals with Morocco and Tunisia by the end of the year, and with 
Algeria later, unless that country falls into a political abyss. 
  But this will not be enough. The EU's policy towards the 
Maghreb consists of a fatal combination of good intent 
accompanied by narrow national self-interest. As member states 
argue over where the money should come from, events might well 
overtake them.

<F P=106> [APA report: "Busek -- Vranitzky: Uncertainty About </F>
Austria -- NATO"] 
  [Text] Linz/Vienna -- Yesterday there was uncertainty 
about a NEUES VOLKSBLATT report. The Linz newspaper reported in 
its Wednesday [27 April] edition that Austria would join NATO's 
Partnership for Peace. Vice Chancellor Erhard Busek and 
Chancellor Franz Vranitzky had reportedly agreed on this without 
giving a date for signing the treaty. Busek reportedly made a 
corresponding statement during a visit to the newspaper's 
editorial office. 
  Busek's office then said that the report on an agreement 
between the chancellor and the vice chancellor is "not topical." 
The talks did take place, but the central subject was "the 
expansion of specific cooperation with in the framework of 
NATO's humanitarian activities," according to Busek's spokesman. 
A statement by Busek that Austria cannot continue to be a 
"beneficiary of others' security policy" [sicherheitspolitischer 
Trittbrettfahrer] was not made in this form. 
  A spokesman for the chancellor also denied such an 
agreement, 
and spoke of an "excessive interpretation" by NEUES VOLKSBLATT.

<F P=106> [Report by Otto Klambauer and Herwig Schmidl: "Is the </F>
Border at the Brenner Uncertain?"] 
  [Excerpt] In South Tirol the world is no longer in the 
balance: Since the election victory of the right-wing alliance 
of Forza Italia, the Northern League, and the neofascists, the 
South Tirol problem is in the headlines again. 
  The reason: Italy's neofascists. First it was the hymns of 
praise by MSI [Italian Social Movement] leaders about 
Mussolini's era that set the alarm bells ringing in South Tirol. 
Now, neofascist Mirko Tremaglia has finally caused a commotion 
on the Eisack and Etsch Rivers: He is calling for the annulment 
of the Osimo treaties, in which Italy and Yugoslavia set down 
the rights of the Italian minority in Istria and Dalmatia in 
1975. In the same breath, Tremaglia is demanding a revision of 
the existing borders. 
  In South Tirol it is generally accepted that if Italy's 
borders are uncertain, then South Tirol's autonomy is also 
uncertain. South Tirol People's Party Chairman Brugger counters 
with the argument that autonomy is a foregone conclusion. The 
"Union for South Tirol" has a harsher formulation: End "the 
time of whining and gestures of protest" -- now it is necessary 
to also make preparations "for the revision of the unjust border 
at the Brenner" and the "departure of South Tirol from Italy." 
  Today, Thursday, South Tirol's Governor Durnwalder and 
Brugger will travel to Vienna for a special summit on South 
Tirol. One thing is clear: The situation involving South Tirol 
cannot leave Austria, as a protective power, indifferent. This 
was confirmed by Foreign Minister Mock in an interview with 
KURIER: "As the protective power, we are watching the discussion 
with great attention." Mock warns: "We are proceeding from the 
assumption that both neighbors are interested in respecting the 
agreements that have been concluded (South Tirol package -- the 
editor)!" 
  What is making the situation difficult at the moment is that 
there is still no new Italian Government -- and thus, there is 
no partner for the talks. Austria, at least, hopes -- and urges 
-- continuity in bilateral relations, that is, also for a 
commitment of the new Italian Government to the existing South 
Tirol treaties. Mock told KURIER: "Exactly. Hopefully there 
will be the continuity that you are talking about! I must 
assume that the new government, too, will observe the current 
legal provisions." 
  Mock wants to establish contact quickly with the new 
government in Rome: "It lies in the nature of the matter that 
neighbors always establish basic contacts quickly, as soon as 
there is a new government." [passage omitted]

<F P=106> [Report by Stefan Galoppi: "Khol: `This is More Dangerous </F>
Than Any Time Since 1945'"] 
  [Text] In Vienna, too, [South Tirol politician Pietro] 
Mitolo's demand for a change in the South Tirol package has 
given rise to excitement. Andreas Khol, the South Tirol expert 
of the Austrian People's Party, said in an interview with KURIER: 
  -- about Mitolo's demand: 
  "He is not alone; his statements must be taken very 
seriously. For the first time, the neofascists are in the 
government in Rome. In this respect the situation is more 
dangerous than any time since 1945." 
  -- about consequences for Austria: 
  "We must remain level-headed. We are willing to defend the 
vital rights of the South Tiroleans, if they are threatened. 
The conference in Vienna must send a clear signal to Italy that 
we will prevent any restriction of autonomy. At the moment 
everything is just a controversy among the parties, but if the 
new Italian Government were to implement specific measures, the 
Austrian Government would have to react." 
  -- about potential countermeasures: 
  "The ambassador could be recalled for consultations and the 
Italian ambassador could be summoned to the Foreign Ministry to 
receive a note of protest. One could call for negotiations. 
Rome knows that any violation of the autonomy package will end 
up before the International Court of Justice. It is the great 
advantage of the package that it guarantees an international 
instance." 
  -- about the effects on the border at the Brenner: 
  "The other side determines the tone. We are interested in 
friendly relations. If Italy, however, were to question the 
borders, it must accept that we will call the Brenner border 
into question."

<F P=106> [Report signed "jk": "`Not Stand Idly By Like a Lamb'"] </F>
  [Text] Vienna -- At the moment, Austria does "not have the 
slightest reason to doubt Italy's loyalty to the treaty," 
Andreas Khol, foreign policy spokesman for the Austrian People's 
Party, said in a news conference with South Tirol Governor Luis 
Durnwalder in Vienna on Thursday [29 April]. One assumes that 
the future government in Rome will not touch South Tirol's 
autonomy. If, however, things turn out differently, "we will not 
stand idly by like a lamb." 
  The background to this are statements from neofascist 
circles 
that form part of the Italian right-wing alliance and that have 
challenged parts of South Tirol's autonomy, on the one hand, and 
called for the revision of the Osimo treaty, on the other, which 
settles Italy's border with the former Yugoslavia. 
  Durnwalder and Siegfried Brugger, chairman of the South 
Tirol 
People's Party (SVP), called on Foreign Minister Alois Mock on 
Thursday, when they were assured of Austria's function as the 
protecting power. Even before, Mock had noted that developments 
in Italy would be observed carefully. 
  As Durnwalder emphasized once more, the SVP will not agree 
to 
a government with neofascist ministers. If only "the smallest 
part" of autonomy be threatened, South Tirol would immediately 
resort to all necessary means at all levels. "Then, even 
self-determination would no longer be a foreign word to us." 
  What is irritating for Khol is that fascist ideas have come 
to the surface in Italy. Those who challenge the Osimo treaties 
, question any postwar borders. "Austria can certainly not keep 
out of this dynamism," Khol said in allusion to the Brenner 
border.

<F P=106> [Article by Pol Van Den Driessche: "Flanders Concluding </F>
First Treaty With Poland"] 
  [Excerpts] For the first time in recent history, Flanders 
will conclude an international treaty. During early June in 
Warsaw, Flemish Prime Minister Luc Van den Brande will sign a 
cooperation treaty between Flanders and Poland. It will 
probably be followed by a Flemish-Hungarian treaty. [passage 
omitted] 
<H5>  Aid </H5>
  The establishment of the treaty was preceded by many years 
of 
preparation and cooperation. Through the New Europe Fund, the 
Flemish Government invested 200 million Belgian francs in 
cooperation projects with Poland. The talks were concluded last 
month. The treaty covers virtually all fields which fall within 
the Flemish Parliament's competence. It deals with the 
development of the SME [small- and medium-sized companies] 
sector, with professional training and labor relations, with 
evolutions in the field of environment, and with culture. 
  The draft treaty will be submitted to the federal 
government, 
which will verify within 30 days whether or not the treaty goes 
against federal powers. No one is expecting any problems, even 
though it is no secret that the Belgian foreign minister is not 
at all pleased with the phenomenon that regions are going 
"offshore" in an increasingly independent way. 
  After that, nothing else will stand in the way of the 
treaty's signature, which is scheduled for 6 or 7 June in the 
Polish capital. Then the Flemish Council will have to approve 
it. Only then will the Flemish-Polish treaty be ratified and 
have international force of law.

<F P=106> [Report signed WV: "Belgian Consumers Just as Optimistic as </F>
Other Europeans"] 
  [Text] The confidence of the Belgian consumer has increased 
more over the last two months than in the rest of the European 
Union (EU). In March, Belgium's confidence index rose to minus 
22 compared to minus 25 in January, while in the EU it rose to 
minus 22 from minus 24. As a result, for the first time since 
March last year, the Belgian consumer is just as optimistic as 
the average European. 
  This is the picture which emerges from the figures for 
February and March recently published by the EU. The EU 
organizes a monthly "harmonized EU survey among the Union's 
consumers" in order to determine a consumer confidence index. As 
part of this survey, 20,000 consumers are interviewed. In 
Belgium, the survey is conducted by the Dimarso agency. 
  The sharp rise in consumer confidence in Belgium since the 
end of last year suggests that the economic recovery which began 
in the second quarter of last year is lasting and balanced. 
Household consumption largely determines the level of demand in 
the economy, representing more than 60 percent of the GDP. 
  Some economists were concerned at the end of last year 
because at that time consumer confidence was not following the 
increase in business confidence. Business confidence, as 
assessed by the National Bank surveys, has been growing since 
the summer of 1993. This confidence has had a strong impact on 
the supply-side of the economy, that is production. 
  The relatively slow reaction among consumers was no doubt 
due 
to uncertainty regarding the crisis plan. The Dehaene 
government announced a social pact in July, but was unable to 
reach agreement with the social partners. This is why it opted 
for a crisis plan, that was only finally completed in November.

  [Text] As far as the environment is concerned, Belgium 
presently has over 7,000 cubic meters of low radioactive waste. 
This waste is stored in safe locations in the Mol area. 
However, 50 years from now, more locations will have to be 
found as it is expected that the quantity of such waste will 
grow to 150,000 cubic meters. The organization responsible for 
storing radioactive waste, the ONDRAF [National Office for 
Nuclear Waste], has set up a list with 100 zones spread over 50 
communes where dumping sites for low radioactive waste could be 
located. The final decision will be made in 1997, but 
Greenpeace already has denounced the ONDRAF plan as 
"unreliable." Sabine Breulet reports: 
  [Breulet] Low radioactive waste originates from nuclear 
plants, research institutes, and hospitals. It is estimated 
that its half-life is approximately 30 years. The ONDRAF 
project calls for building a concrete storage house on clay or 
schistous ground covering 30 hectares. The site should make it 
possible to store 100,000 cubic meters of processed waste. A 
total of 98 zones spread over Flanders and Wallonia meet the 
criteria required for this dumping site. Fifty communes are 
being considered for this site, but only one will be designated. 
The final choice should be made by 1997 and then be followed by 
the approval requests. Thus, the dumping site for this type of 
waste will not be built until the year 2000.

<F P=106> [Report by Peter de Graaf and Wio Joustra: "Netherlands and </F>
Belgian Navies To Integrate"] 
  [Excerpts] The Hague/Brussels -- The Navies of the 
Netherlands and Belgium are going to strengthen their 
cooperation. In the near future, there will be talk of an all 
but complete operational integration of the most important 
surface ships of the two navies. 
  The frigates and minehunters of both countries will then, in 
practice, comprise a single navy, although control of the ships 
will remain in national hands. The command center for the joint 
fleet will be in Den Helder, manned by military personnel from 
both countries. [passage omitted] 
  In The Hague there was talk Tuesday [26 April] that this was 
similar to the German-Netherlands Army Corps to be set up in 
Muenster. This corps will comprise two German divisions and one 
Netherlands division. The difference is that the 
German-Netherlands Corps will be under a revolving command. The 
Netherlands Navy commander will continue to be the primary 
person responsible for the joint navy with Belgium. [passage 
omitted] 
  The cooperation is designed mainly to produce military 
budget 
savings. The Netherlands Navy will have to reduce its personnel 
nearly 30 percent by the year 2000. With a total budget 
reduction of 18 percent since 1989 and considering that the 
Navy's budget accounts for some 20 percent of the overall 
defense budget, it is clear that there have been major savings 
in this branch of the Armed Forces over the past five years.

<F P=106> [By Sian Clare, PRESS ASSOCIATION lobby correspondent] </F>
  [Text] Britain today issued a stern warning to Iran that it 
must have no contact with the IRA. Iran's charge d'affaires 
Gholam Reza Ansari was summoned to see Foreign Office [FO] 
Minister Douglas Hogg following reports that Tehran's spies have 
been secretly helping the terrorists. 
  After the 10-minute showdown at the Foreign Office, a FO 
spokesman said: "We are convinced that there have been contacts 
between Iranian intelligence and the IRA. We take the gravest 
view of any contact which might assist or encourage terrorism. 
Mr. Hogg summoned the Iranian charge to convey our concern and 
to request an assurance at senior level that contact would be 
immediately and conclusively severed." 
  Britain believes contacts have been going on for some time 
and it is clear measures will be taken against Tehran if today's 
warning has no effect. Relations between the two countries are 
already sour following the late Ayatollah Khomeyni's death order 
on author Salman Rushdie over his controversial book, The 
Satanic Verses. Britain and Iran do not have full diplomatic 
relations, with only an Iranian charge d'affaires in London, 
instead of an ambassador. But Britain is unlikely to break off 
all diplomatic relations with such an important Middle East 
country and will be reluctant to impose sanctions. 
  The Iranian embassy refused to comment on today's events. 
  The Government is believed to be concerned that Iran was 
planning to supply money and arms to the IRA. 
  Later, Mr. Ansari told ITN's Lunchtime News that his meeting 
with Mr Hogg was very friendly. "I was informed about their 
concern. I am sure it is not right, but I will be in contact 
with my country -- definitely it is not right."

  [Text] The Iranian Charge d'Affaires Gholam Reza Ansari 
tonight "emphatically denied" his country was involved in 
supplying arms or money to the IRA. "There is absolutely no 
contact between the intelligence services of our country and 
provisional IRA," he said. 
  "We naturally understand that any such contact would produce 
a feeling of revulsion in the UK, but as there is none, there is 
no need for alarm or criticism. There is no shred of evidence 
to support these astonishing claims. They are without 
foundation, there is no basis for them and there is no truth in 
the suggestion that Iran supports terrorism in Northern Ireland 
or in any part of the world." 
  He blamed the reports on unnamed "elements" who he said 
wanted to damage relations between Britain and Iran. He said 
that he was notified that he was being summoned to the meeting 
with Mr. Hogg on Wednesday [27 April]. 
  He said that during discussion the foreign minister had not 
presented him with any firm evidence to support the allegations. 
However, he did confirm that Mr. Hogg raised the name of an 
Iranian official, Amir Hoseyn Taghavi, who was named in Greek 
newspaper reports as the head of the Western European Department 
of the Iranian intelligence Ministry, and who was said to be 
involved in the negotiations with the IRA.

<F P=106> [By Gavin Cordon, Sian Clare and Chris Moncrieff, PRESS </F>
ASSOCIATION] 
  [Text] The Government tonight faced calls for sanctions 
against Iran after revealing the Tehran regime provided funds 
for the IRA. The demands by Unionist MPs followed Foreign Office 
disclosures that the Iranian intelligence service had been 
assisting the terrorists. 
  But Iran's charge d'affaires in London strongly denied his 
country supplied either money or weapons. "There is absolutely 
no contact between the intelligence services of our country and 
the IRA," Gholam Reza Ansari told a news conference. 
  He was summoned to the Foreign Office earlier today for a 
10-minute dressing down from Minister of State Douglas Hogg, in 
which it was made clear the flow of cash to terrorist coffers 
must cease. 
  A Foreign Office spokesman said: "We are convinced that 
there 
have been contacts between Iranian intelligence and the IRA. We 
take the gravest view of any contact which might assist or 
encourage terrorism." 
  The row marked a downturn in Anglo-Iranian relations already 
soured by the long-running dispute over Ayatollah Khomeyni's 
"fatwa" calling for the death of Satanic Verses author Salman 
Rushdie. 
  It also raised disturbing questions about the IRA's 
continuing ability to attract support for its campaign of 
violence from overseas backers. 
  The Foreign Office's analysis was greeted with scepticism in 
Dublin, where Prime Minister Albert Reynolds said he knew 
nothing of reported links between Iran and the IRA. "I do not 
accept any part of the allegations until they are established." 
  In London, furious Unionist MPs called for tough measures 
against Tehran. The Rev. Ian Paisley, leader of the Democratic 
Unionist Party, said: "I have no doubt that international 
terrorists and these countries that are really led by terrorists 
are all in cahoots." 
  He added: "If the Iranian Government doesn't break off its 
relations and show true repentance, sanctions should be imposed 
on Iran. There is no difference between a government like Iraq 
killing people and Iran supplying arms to terrorists to kill 
people. They are both equally guilty." 
  David Trimble, Ulster Unionist MP for Upper Bann, said: 
"Merely slapping their wrists isn't going to be enough. They 
should be looking at economic and diplomatic measures to make 
life uncomfortable for the Iranian regime." 
  The matter was also raised by Popular Unionist Sir James 
Kilfedder (Down N) in the Commons during Northern Ireland 
questions. 
  The decision to publicly upbraid the Iranians followed 
publication of reports in Greek and Middle Eastern newspapers, 
although officials said they had had "conclusive" evidence of 
the links for some time. 
  A Government spokesman said in what was thought to be a 
reference to the intelligence services MI5 and MI6: "The 
Government has reason to believe from independent information 
that these reports were accurate." 
  According to one Greek press report, Iranian representatives 
met the IRA in a number of European countries. Cash was handed 
over and arms were said to have been promised. The report named 
an Iranian official, Amir Hoseyn Taghavi, said to be the head of 
the Western European Department of the Iranian Intelligence 
Ministry, as being involved in the discussions. Mr. Ansari 
said Mr. Taghavi's name was raised by Mr. Hogg during their 
meeting today. 
  The disclosures came at a time of intensified terrorist 
violence in Northern Ireland, with eight killings in the 
province in the last eight days. They also followed a 
crackdown on the IRA's racketeering activities, which provide 
much of the funding for its campaign. 
  In the past the IRA has looked to sympathisers in the United 
States and Libya for cash and weapons, so there was little 
surprise among terrorism experts that it had reportedly extended 
its links to Tehran. Paul Wilkinson, professor of 
international relations at St. Andrew's University, said: "The 
IRA is always looking around for arms and cash from a state like 
Iran that has been involved in terrorism." 
  Dr. Conor Gearty, a reader of law at King's College, London, 
said there was a long history of commercial links between Iran 
and the Irish Republic. 
  "This is not a great surprise. This link with Iran must have 
come from intelligence," he said. "It would have been logical 
for the IRA to have sought help from Iran. Look how well they 
did out of their links with Libya. It would be a case of 
`England's enemy is the IRA's friend.'"

<F P=106> [Report by M.J. Tzou and Debbie Kuo] </F>
  [Text] Paris, April 22 (CNA) -- France's Cogema [General 
Nuclear Materials Company] and the Taiwan Power Company 
[Taipower] are set to enter into a deal whereby Cogema will 
provide Taipower with the technologies it needs to manage and 
safely recycle Taiwan's stock of nuclear waste. 
  While meeting with a Taiwan power company delegation, Cogema 
deputy managing director Bernard Lenail said recycling spent 
fuel discharged from nuclear power plants to produce usable fuel 
like uranium and plutonium has become a world trend, especially 
now that stocks of uranium have decreased substantially 
worldwide over the past decade. 
  Lenail said Taipower cannot either economically or 
environmentally afford to keep storing waste from Taiwan's three 
nuclear power plants, which Taipower says has accumulated at an 
alarming pace since the first plant became operational in 1987. 
  Nuclear fuel recycling is well established in France, Lenail 
said. More than 80 percent of the world's spent nuclear waste 
is reprocessed there. 
  The Taipower mission visited an enriched uranium processing 
plant in Nimes in southern France and a major nuclear waste 
processing plant in Troyes in central France during its 
fact-finding trip. 
  The mission members said they were impressed by the 
environmental "miracles" they saw in the vicinity of the nuclear 
plants, including fish and crocodile ponds using hot water 
dischargd from the plants, green fields, and herds of grazing 
cows. 
  About 75 percent of France's energy comes from nuclear power 
plants, and 70 percent of the fuel consumed by Taipower's three 
nuclear power plants is supplied by France.

<F P=106> [News conference by Silvio Berlusconi, prime </F>
minister-designate, with unidentified correspondents from the 
Presidential Palace -- live] 
  [Text] [Announcer] Just before 1700 [1600 GMT] Forza Italia 
leader Silvio Berlusconi went to the Presidential Palace, where 
he was entrusted with the task of forming a new government by 
President Scalfaro. Berlusconi has now finished his meeting 
with Scalfaro. Fabrizio Ferrari reports from the Presidential 
Palace: 
  [Berlusconi, broadcast in progress] Moderation and the 
refusal of any kind of extremism and fanaticism are an essential 
part of the style of government which I intend to follow. The 
first point is morality in political life. The members of the 
government whom I will name completely by myself and under my 
responsibility -- in line with Article 92 of the Constitution -- 
will be unreproachable people who will be asked to behave in an 
unreproachable way. The way the state works -- as far as the 
power and the life of the government are concerned -- will be 
examined [word indistinct] with the utmost transparency. 
  My predecessors, amid many difficulties and with no clear 
political majority, tried to relaunch the economy. In order to 
do so, a new climate of confidence for businesses and work must 
be created. Public debt must be reduced, unemployment must be 
reduced, savings must be protected, and investments increased. 
There is also the need for a more just and simpler tax system. 
One that is less of a burden for those activities that create 
wealth. Little by little, we must give the economic system more 
and more liberty and confidence in harmony with our country's 
European commitments. The stock exchange trend and other 
economic indicators confirm that this task is a difficult, but 
not impossible one. 
  The third point is the unavoidable priority of social 
solidarity. A modern state must be less intrusive and more 
efficient. Parties must step back and public institutions must 
become once again the center of government activity with the aim 
of protecting the whole of the community, poor and suffering 
people first. Social solidarity does not need beautiful words, 
it needs efficient services, run at a cost that is compatible 
with a market economy having a permanent and methodical fight 
against waste. But there cannot be social solidarity without 
giving law and order back to the whole country. 
  Italy is one country and cannot be split. It is a republic 
based on local authorities. Government and parliament are the 
center of a public system hugely decentralized. This includes 
regions, provinces, and towns. A further effort towards forms 
of territorial self-government, which reflects the present 
debate on federalism, is desirable. But in order to have a 
solid republican renewal, we must first have a stable government 
capable of doing an undisturbed and long-term job. I will do 
all I can, under my responsibility, in order to form a 
government without paying any attention to the old political 
games, to the rule of dividing up [power and posts], or to mean 
personal interests. Parliament and the citizens will be 
constantly informed -- it is their right -- about the policies 
and the activities of the government. 
  As for the problem raised by many people about the 
possibility of someone like me becoming prime minister, one who 
occupies an important position in economic life -- including the 
media -- I think I must give some precise information after the 
head of state honored me highly by entrusting me with the task 
of forming the new government. There is an antitrust law in our 
body of laws: It created a guarantor of competition and free 
market. He/she has the power to guarantee, check, and also 
impose sanctions in order to protect the market and fair 
competition. There is also law number 223 of 1990 which created 
the guarantor for broadcasting and publishing: He/she has the 
special power to guarantee, check, and also to impose sanctions 
in areas which include the press, television, and advertising. 
However, I really have a special desire to give the widest and 
most objective guarantees on this issue. This is why I can 
announce right now that as soon as the government is formed, I 
will appoint a committee made up of three famous and respected 
lawyers: Professor Antonio La Pergola, a former president of 
the Constitutional Court; Professor Giorgio Crisci, president of 
the Council of State; and Professor Agostino Gambino, commercial 
law professor at the Sapienza University in Rome. They already 
have said they are available for the job and the president of 
the republic has already approved of them. Their task will be 
to renew and complete the present laws so that the mere hint 
that those who are in government are mixing their private and 
public interests shall be avoided. I will take the proposals 
put forward by the committee to the cabinet so that they are 
transformed into bills to be approved by parliament. As for the 
particular field of the media, pending a change of the present 
law, I will entrust the same committee with studying a formula 
which would give sufficient guarantees. However, I think that 
the best guarantees of all are commitment, love for public 
service, and lack of personal interest with which I am about to 
carry out this task and possible future government activity. 
  As I was coming here, I met many people. There were crowds 
outside my house and at the entrance to the presidency. They 
wished me luck, they sent me kisses and reminded me of the 
expectations people have right now. I realize this is a 
difficult moment for our country and that there are serious 
problems. I realize that there are great expectations and that 
it would be easy to disappoint people. I believe I can 
guarantee one thing: that this government, if we succeed in 
forming a government, will be a balanced team, full of energy 
and enthusiasm, with a lot of new faces. I will make every 
necessary effort, work as hard as is required and make any 
necessary sacrifice, in order to do all that is possible not to 
disappoint anyone. I believe we can come through the current 
situation. I do not believe anyone has a magic wand, nor that 
anyone, even in government, can work miracles. However, I do 
believe that our people and our extraordinary country can 
achieve a real miracle. I believe that if everyone together 
rolls up their shirt sleeves, the country can get back on the 
road to growth and kickstart the economy, in order that we can 
think about a country -- an Italy -- which is more just, more 
open to the needs of those who are suffering, more modern, more 
efficient, which is better thought of in Europe and the world, 
and is more prosperous and more peaceful. This is the task I 
feel I am taking on in the eyes of all Italians. My task will 
be to give everything I possibly can and to make every effort 
not to fail expectations, nor to let anyone down. Thank you. 
  [Unidentified correspondent] Excuse me [passage indistinct] 
  [Berlusconi] Of course not, even if I have begun to think 
about candidates for every ministerial position, in order to 
find the best man for the right job. To this end, I think it 
would be opportune to make a final choice only after I have 
completed all the work that I am undertaking, the work involved 
in the consultations I am holding. To this end, I will spend 
the last few days of this week finely tuning the first draft of 
our program. I will also meet members of the political forces 
in the Freedom and Good Government Alliance and start to hold 
the consultations on Monday. 
  As for consultations, I think it would be a good idea to 
change the order in which I have seen consultations held in the 
past. I believe it is right that meetings start with exponents 
of the world of work and production, followed by members of the 
various [trades unions and employers] confederations, in order 
to obtain from them an accurate picture of the current situation 
in the country -- of the economy -- and to listen to the 
solutions they think would be most likely to solve our problems. 
Only at the end of this meeting will I meet members of the 
political forces in order to discuss with them what has emerged 
from the previous meetings. I will then take what has emerged 
from these proceedings to both chambers of parliament for 
approval. 
  [Correspondent] Excuse me, Prime Minister [passage 
indistinct]. 
  [Berlusconi] I have not set a final date and the president 
agrees with this. I believe the most important thing is to 
build the best team and to get the best program ready. I 
believe this must be done in however much time it takes so the 
best possible result is achieved. Therefore, I have not set a 
final date even if I know the current situation is as it is and 
too much time must not be wasted. 
  [Correspondent] You will be the first prime minister to own 
and enjoy the support of three important television networks. Is 
there even the remotest possibility that you will this year give 
up ownership and control of at least two of these networks? 
  [Berlusconi] In this situation, I must say, for the time 
being there is no immediate possibility that one of these 
networks may be sold. They are -- and together they make up an 
important communications group -- the most important group in 
the country -- so they are not objects that can be disposed of 
easily. Anyhow, I believe that the professionalism of all the 
directors and journalists who work for these networks offers a 
guarantee that the news services of these networks will operate 
correctly. 
  I believe there is also the possibility, through the 
committee we have appointed, to produce norms that can be added 
to the system of norms that already exists in our legal system, 
in order to give absolute guarantees to all. I know that our 
laws, concerning the possible occupations of a prime minister 
and of a government, contain a whole series of situations and 
guarantees. Apart from a prime minister's conscience and his 
interest in his image and prestige -- I believe you can all 
understand how important this is...[pauses] I believe this 
insuperable boundary comes first and should reassure everyone. 
  I believe that the functions of the other government 
components are in themselves a control. Even if they are allies 
they could find themselves in disagreement with the prime 
minister. The parliamentary opposition also exercises a 
control, as does the parliament as a whole. Professionals 
working in the news services exercise a control. Public opinion 
exercises a control. There is also the control exercised by the 
media watchdog, the control exercised by the antitrust 
authority, and the control exercised by public prosecutors' 
offices. So, there is already a system of controls in place 
that I believe should make people look at this problem in a less 
partisan fashion than has sometimes been the case. To this I can 
add the appointments of the three people I referred to earlier 
-- I believe they will proceed to further examine all norms in 
order to bring about a situation that offers absolute guarantees. 
  [Correspondent] Over the last 48 hours a lot has been said 
about a possible division of the Interior Ministry. Is this 
still being debated? 
  [Berlusconi] I do not believe from what we know so far that 
decisions are possible or that ministries can be merged or that 
single ministries can be split up or divided. I believe that it 
is right that we must get to know the machinery of government, 
of the state. I believe that only afterward can decisions be 
made in one direction or the other. This is my opinion from 
having deepened...[pauses] This is a contradictory term because 
I must immediately and briefly add that having taken stock of 
the ministries situation it was my intention to give a clear 
demonstration of my determination to reduce public spending by, 
among other things, reducing the number of ministries and 
undersecretaries, but I realized, looking closely at the 
machinery of public bureaucracy, that for now it is not possible 
to make a decision that has been properly thought through. It 
would be making decisions for the sake of decisions -- something 
I want to steer well clear of. 
  [Correspondent] Could I ask two things? First, do you have 
any idea how long the work carried out by the three wise men 
will take -- the committee -- how long will it take? Second, 
did you feel more emotional today, while you were reading your 
speech as the prime minister designate, or on the day you 
decided to enter the political fray? I think both days were 
emotionally charged. 
  [Berlusconi] As far as your first question is concerned, 
these men will be appointed immediately -- it will be among the 
government's first actions -- and they will take the necessary 
time to carry out what we are asking them to do. For this 
reason I cannot predict how long it will take, but I do not 
think it will be long -- a question of a few months, I think. 
  As far as feeling emotional is concerned, I think you have 
the right to be emotional when on the one hand you change your 
life completely, as was the case on the day I entered the fray 
-- and I must say I feel emotional today as well because I feel 
I have a great responsibility on my shoulders. I have been in 
touch with the people over these last few months, and above all 
with some of the poorest people. They told me about their 
problems and wanted the state to do something to help them. I 
feel I have an enormous responsibility to these people. I feel 
this responsibility as I have never felt one before. I feel 
that I am at the center of a huge responsibility. I believe 
that I will be able to make every effort, to use all my 
strength, not to let these people down, and to find in the 
framework of what is possible -- via the machinery of 
government, among other things -- to find answers and above all 
improve the condition of these people and improve life in 
general in our country. I have often asked what they really 
wanted. The question [as heard] that I hear most often is that 
they want something good to happen. I think we will make every 
effort to do something good. 
  [Correspondent] This question is for a live news program on 
RAI Due Television Network. You have just explained the main 
points of what is basically a moderate program. How can it 
satisfy the extreme demands made by some of your political 
allies? 
  [Berlusconi] I cannot recall any extreme demand, any demand 
that is not moderate, balanced, and measured. I think there 
have been statements made by individuals. They were probably 
exaggerated by the media. When I sit around a table with my 
allies to discuss concrete problems, I find they are measured, 
balanced, and full of common sense. In any case, this is the 
style of government the prime minister will have to guarantee to 
his allies, to parliament, and to the whole country. It will be 
a government of people with common sense, experienced people, 
people who can come up with original solutions and who have the 
courage to change. They are balanced, measured, and reflective 
people. 
  [Correspondent] I would like to ask you a question about 
your 
personal interests abroad. Have you come up with some solution, 
as I think that the three wise men are maybe not in the position 
to give advice.... 
  [Berlusconi, interrupting] I do not have personal interests 
abroad. The Fininvest group, which I left as far as operational 
management is concerned -- as you know I have resigned from all 
posts in the Fininvest group -- only has a stake in Tele Cinco 
in Spain. This is the most important company. As for that 
company, the present managers of the group are thinking about 
solutions, and it has not been ruled out that the stake could be 
sold. 
  [Correspondent] Your ally Bossi insists that he wants the 
Interior Ministry. Some League's members said today that they 
would enter the government. The Cusani trial is about to 
finish. Are you still considering Di Pietro? [Di Pietro, 
prosecutor at the Cusani bribes trial, has been repeatedly 
mentioned as a possible candidate for the post of interior 
minister]. 
  [Berlusconi] I do not want to discuss the names of 
ministers. 
It is a very complicated issue, which will be tackled in the 
next few days. We have this period of time, from today to the 
day when we shall present the complete government team, to 
consider, in all its aspects, the problem of who the ministers 
will be. Allow me not to give you an answer on this issue. 
  [Correspondent] Can you tell me how you intend to proceed as 
far as institutional and constitutional reform are concerned? 
Do you have a schedule and do you intend to find an agreement 
with the largest possible part of parliament? 
  [Berlusconi] There is a very precise law, there is the 
Constitution, which is our first law. It says clearly how the 
Constitution can be changed. It is clear that only that part 
can be followed, and quite clearly if the reforms are important 
ones, they will have to be submitted to the decision of the 
Italian people through a referendum. 
  [Correspondent] After what you said, I think that the lists 
for the European elections will be prepared before the 
government is formed. Do you think that you are going to be a 
candidate in the European elections in some constituency? 
  [Berlusconi] Allow me for the moment to be the figure I 
represent, that is the prime minister-designate. That is, 
someone who must consider the interests of all the Italians and 
not the interests of one political side, even if mine is not a 
party, it is only a movement. I am happy to answer your 
questions but only if they are questions about the future 
activity of the prime minister. 
  [Correspondent] [question indistinct] 
  [Berlusconi] As you know, we have always paid much attention 
to what I call the other half of heaven, that is to the world of 
women. Not only the brave women who work, but also the women who 
remain at home and who sacrifice themselves to raise children 
and to take care of the family. I think that we shall pay much 
attention both to their situation and, more generally, to the 
situation of families. I think that many of the measures we have 
been working on already, and which are measures that I hope will 
soon become law, concern precisely the family. And let me add 
that, on this issue, our program will really stress our 
tradition, our cultural tradition, which includes the values we 
have learned, the basic values of Catholic religion. I can tell 
you that we are seriously studying the possibility of a ministry 
of family. I think that what we manage to do will be something 
really new. 
  [Correspondent] A question about foreign affairs: will the 
country's policies be followed, in particular as far as our 
eastern borders are concerned? 
  [Berlusconi] We shall certainly continue the same policy. We 
shall certainly confirm our love and admiration of the European 
institutions and for a Europe that is increasingly moving toward 
unification, even a monetary one. We shall confirm our Atlantic 
policy. As for the borders, I think that things are already 
clear. Even those who made certain demands have explained 
clearly what they meant. I think that what is demanded is only 
reciprocity as far as the Italian minorities in that state are 
concerned. Thank you very much for being here. I am now going 
to inform the speakers of the Chamber of Deputies and of the 
Senate and outgoing prime minister Ciampi of the task with which 
I have been entrusted. Thank you.

<F P=106> [Unattributed report: "A Platform To Change Italy in 100 </F>
Days"] 
  [Text] Rome -- Here is the platform covering the "first 100 
days" of Berlusconi's government: a 25-page draft -- the 
outcome of a number of meetings held by the majority -- 
outlining the new government's first measures. The text provides 
for speeding up of the privatization process, but National 
Alliance Senate floor leader Giulio Maceratini hurried to say 
that he had never seen the text presented at majority floor 
leaders' meetings, and that therefore it was "apocryphal." 
Nevertheless, we list here some of the salient points of the 
text which is being circulated. 
  -- Abolition of income tax on incomes up to 10 million lire. 
  -- Tax rebates for companies creating new jobs. 
  -- Rapid introduction of institutionalized temporary work. 
  -- Work and training contracts amended to provide more 
favorable terms for businesses. 
  -- Full deregulation of workforce contracting, including 
nominal employment offers, for companies with more than three 
and less than 15 employees. 
  -- Urgent unfreezing of financing for the south of Italy. 
  -- Suspension of Article 6 of law 537/93 on tendering 
contracts, a regulation which was introduced by the latest 
Finance Bill. 
  -- Electoral reform introducing a majority system, 
abolishing 
the 25-percent proportional quota. 
  -- Introduction of a constitutional regulation for the 
budget. 
  -- Application of only two VAT rates. 
  -- Review of the law on pension funds. 
  -- Introduction of "household allowances" for families with 
low incomes and children. 
  -- Review of personal income tax rates to help large 
families.

<F P=106> [Interview with Antonio Martino, Forza Italia economist, by </F>
Giovanni Negri; place and date not given: "Italy's Role as 
Cinderella of Europe Must End" -- first three paragraphs are 
L'INDIPENDENTE introduction] 
  [Text] Rome -- Italy is looking to the West, and Antonio 
Martino's version of its foreign policy is taking shape. 
  As the most likely candidate for foreign minister, he set 
out 
for L'INDIPENDENTE the broad outlines of Italy's future foreign 
policy, Second Republic style. 
  Silvio Berlusconi has made up his mind: If the National 
Alliance also is present in the country's government, it must be 
clearly understood that Italy's image abroad will be sharply 
defined: His choice of Martino is intended to show that the 
"Italian revolution" must not be misunderstood. 
  It is liberal, democratic, and western. This implies an open 
alliance with the United States, friendship with Israel, Italy's 
release from its role as "the Cinderella of Europe," 
antiprotectionism in economics, and human rights in philosophy. 
Here is Martino's thinking, as he prepares to leave for the 
United States, on the very eve of Clinton's visit (June) and the 
G-7 summit in Naples (July) and as battles rage in Rome for the 
Interior and other ministries. 
  [Negri] One-third Beirut, one-third Finland, and one-third 
Vatican: Is half a century of foreign policy as defined by 
Andreotti finished? 
  [Martino] Yes, times have changed. Both since when my father 
laid the first foundations of the European Union and since the 
fall of the Berlin Wall. 
  [Negri] But you are an economist. Why the Foreign Ministry? 
  [Martino] I could say that it is a very important economic 
ministry, that at the international level economics is of 
supreme importance. But I want to be clearer than that. There 
is some truth in the words "new international order" -- woe 
betide us if we permit an explosion of protectionism and 
national egoism. Economic war between great giants such as 
NAFTA, the European Union, and the Far East would be fatal. We 
are independent, the challenges are posed at the global level, 
and regression and isolation must be strongly discouraged. 
  [Negri] Leaving philosophy aside, what will you tell 
Clinton? 
  [Martino] I know the United States well. It will be a good 
relationship, irrespective of what color the administration is. 
Also the time is past when visits were mere photo opportunities, 
emblematic of a foreign policy which had sunk into decline. 
  [Negri] You are stubbornly nonconfessional. What is the 
future of Italian-Vatican relations? 
  [Martino] Precisely because I am nonconfessional, I do not 
have to prove myself. We will have even better, and clearer, 
relations with the Vatican. 
  [Negri] Is it true that you are pro-Israeli? 
  [Martino] The utmost encouragement must be given to the 
peace 
process in the Middle East. This is why friendship with all the 
sides involved is necessary. 
  [Negri] I understand diplomatic language, but Andreotti was 
pro-Arab. 
  [Martino] The problem is how to gain peace through 
negotiation. With this objective, we will never adopt a 
preconceived alignment with either side. 
  [Negri] At the Foreign Ministry you will inherit the image 
of 
an Italy relegated to the second league, at least in Europe. 
  [Martino] More important than image is identity -- that is, 
conduct consistent with our Europeanist conviction and with the 
pledges demanded. We say that we must set our own house in 
order. There must be an end to slovenliness and the failure to 
honor deadlines. Then we will enjoy greater credibility in what 
we have to say. 
  [Negri] Let us move onto the current situation. The main 
priority is the former Yugoslavia. 
  [Martino] We will be in the forefront of defending human 
rights. But it is irresponsible to set the cart before the 
horse: I will simply say that this is the first point on which 
I am concentrating. 
  [Negri] Elections are taking place in South Africa. 
  [Martino] Let us hope that the elections take place 
peacefully. But we must be aware that in that kind of situation 
there are often internal conflicts, such as the present ones 
between the ANC and Buthelezi's Inkatha movement, which are even 
fiercer than the conflict between blacks and whites. 
  [Negri] What about China, of which Andreotti and De Michelis 
were so fond? 
  [Martino] There is a gigantic experiment in the 
liberalization of the economy, for the present without a 
transition to democracy. But can economic development spread 
while leaving a centralized government unchanged? 
  [Negri] There has been corruption within the context of 
international cooperation. Will there be changes in the Foreign 
Ministry? 
  [Martino] If cooperation is what it has been hitherto, that 
is, transfers between governments, then I am against that. You 
cannot benefit a country by sending money to authoritarian, 
corrupt, and dictatorial bureaucracies. The direct transfer of 
aid and know-how to the people and involvement by private 
concerns are another matter. 
  [Negri] But without development in the Third and Fourth 
Worlds, there will be a growth in the already enormous 
emigration toward the wealthy countries. 
  [Martino] We must not make mistaken assumptions. We are well 
aware of what prevents development (protectionism, restrictions, 
and inefficient public action), but we know much less about what 
makes it possible from area to area. There are no magic wands 
that can be waved. As for emigration, ours are a people who 
have exported workers to the four corners of the world; in fact 
in South America there is virtually another Italy to be kept in 
mind. So we must be more open with those who come here to work, 
and stricter with those who mistakenly believe they can find an 
illusory El Dorado here. 
  [Negri] In conclusion, why did Berlusconi choose you for the 
Foreign Ministry? 
  [Martino] Without embarrassment, I believe that he respects 
me and realizes how necessary it is to strengthen our foreign 
policy.

  [Text] The expected split at the center of Mario Segni's 
Pact for Italy officially took place this afternoon with the 
presentation to the press of the Liberal Democrat Foundation by 
dissident members of the pact. Alberto Michelini, Stainano, 
Tremonti, Siciliani, and Pelanda announced their departure, a 
little after the ultimatum given to them by Mario Segni: "With 
me, or against me." 
  According to the dissidents, Segni's prejudicial opposition 
is static, while they, on the other hand, are willing to enter 
into negotiation with the government. As far as the question of 
the government confidence motion is concerned, the dissidents 
may vote against, abstain, or, if they follow their manifesto, 
vote for the government.

  [Text] Vatican City, April 29 (AFP) -- Pope John Paul II 
will be operated on Friday [29 April] after breaking his right 
thighbone in a fall, a specialist treating the 73-year-old 
pontiff said. 
  The operation will take place "in about an hour," said 
Doctor 
Corrado Manni, top anaesthesiologist at Rome's Catholic 
Unversity. 
  The pope was rushed to hospital early Friday in Rome's 
Gemelli clinic. 
  Vatican spokesman Joaquin Navarro said the pope broke the 
tip 
of his femur bone when he "fell accidentally in the bathroom in 
his apartment" around 11 p.m. (2100 GMT) Thursday night. 
  The pope was to have begun a visit to Sicily later Friday.

  [Excerpts] The operation on the pope's fractured right 
thigh bone, which he broke in a fall, was successfully completed 
at around 1530. The pope has already been taken to his 
apartment in Rome's Gemelli Hospital, where he was treated this 
morning. Valter Vecellio reports from the hospital. 
  [Vecellio] As you have just said, the operation on John Paul 
II's right thigh ended at about 1500 this afternoon. It was 
successful and the doctors are happy. [passage omitted] 
  Professors Fineschi and Sanguinetti, who operated on the 
pope, are happy, and a news conference is currently under way in 
a room in Gemelli Hospital. Doctors are giving details about the 
pope's medical condition. 
  It is expected that the pope will convalesce here at Gemelli 
Hospital for about 10 days, and then his recuperation program 
will begin. [passage omitted]

  [Excerpt] Adriano Moreira, chairman of the ad hoc 
parliamentary committee to monitor the situation in East Timor, 
has resigned because he believes the issues of how to help the 
cause of human rights in Timor and of how to hand Macao over to 
China need to be reconsidered. Speaking to Renascenca, Adriano 
Moreira said his decision to stand down did not mean the end of 
the parliamentary committee: 
  [Begin recording] [Moreira] What this is about is the fact 
that the way circumstances have evolved turns the issue, as far 
as Portugal is concerned, into the issue of Portugal's policy in 
the Pacific region. Both Macao, which is extremely important, 
and Timor, the most serious of challenges in view of the adverse 
conditions surrounding the cause of recognizing the rights of 
the Timorese, are components of the question. With 
circumstances having, in my opinion, evolved in this direction, 
it seems necessary to me not only to have the matter discussed 
by the House, but also to propose that the instruments for 
intervention in this area be changed. 
  [Unidentified correspondent] What instruments do you 
advocate? 
  [Moreira] They concern, first, the definition of the 
government's responsibilities vis-a-vis Macao, and, second, the 
intervention of the assembly itself in the general question of 
Portugal's interests in the Pacific, which includes the Timorese 
question. 
  The president of the Portuguese Assembly has shown the 
greatest interest in this manner of posing the question, and 
said he will be raising it at the meeting of parliamentary party 
leaders. [passage omitted] [end recording]

  [Text] Admiral Fuzeta da Ponte, the head of the Portuguese 
Armed Forces, would like to move faster with the modernization 
program of the Portuguese forces. He said this will facilitate 
Portugal's participation in peace operations in an European 
theater. Fuzeta da Ponte was speaking to RTP after a meeting in 
Brussels dominated by the crisis in Bosnia. He was interviewed 
by Pedro Oliveira. 
  [Oliveira] As for Portugal's contribution to international 
peace efforts, Admiral Fuzeta da Ponte stressed the need to 
proceed with the modernization program for the Portuguese 
forces. In an interview with RTP, Fuzeta da Ponte began by 
reiterating Portugal's Euro-Atlanticist vocation. 
  [Begin recording] [Da Ponte] I believe that the government 
-- 
and the country -- have clearly defined that we are a 
Euro-Atlantic nation. Therefore, our Euro-Atlanticism means 
that we have great responsibilities toward Europe, and that is 
what we are dealing with. But Atlanticism means other 
responsibilities that go beyond Europe proper and that follow on 
from Portugal's own history and its Atlantic aspect. I am 
referring, as I said, to our participation in terms of support 
to our former colonies. We are in Mozambique, we are and have 
been in Angola -- and continue to be -- everywhere, this is a 
national feeling [word indistinct]...[pauses] that seems to 
identify with the state's opinion that we should be represented 
there. 
  In Europe, we must have prepared forces on a par with the 
European forces. I would say that in terms of the three 
branches of the Armed Forces the last steps, taken recently, 
point to certain equipment that favors, on the other hand, we 
have to prepare the personnel so they can move that equipment 
[sentence as heard]. It is to this effect that our efforts are 
pointing. 
  [Oliveira] Even so, in your opinion are there shortcomings 
in 
the Portuguese Armed Forces that should be tackled? 
  [Da Ponte] Naturally there are restrictions, everyone knows 
there are restrictions, we are not the only ones to have them. 
But I think that the pace of our modernization leaves us all a 
little unhappy. We would like to move faster, and why? Because 
as you know our Armed Forces were equipped for an old colonial 
war and only recently have we come out of that vision and begun 
to alter the structure, the means, and the legislation to that 
effect. My dissatisfaction, shall we say, is that we cannot do 
this any faster because of the restrictions that are perfectly 
compatible with national needs. [end recording]

<F P=106> [Ken Pottinger report: "Poverty Is Thorn on `Rose' of </F>
Portuguese Democracy"] 
  [Text] Lisbon -- Twenty years after the April Revolution 
set Portugal on the road to democracy, the peasants of the 
Alentejo find their lot little changed. While modern 
technologies have helped revolutionise the manufacturing sector, 
agricultural penury persists. Tia Maria Silva, a 63-year-old 
fruit picker in Lagamecas, edging the Alentejo, earns 2 pounds 
an hour. She lives in one of the pockets of poverty and 
underdevelopment described last week by President Mario Soares 
as "thorns on the rose of Portuguese democracy". 
  But the country has also entered the modern era: it has one 
of the highest rates of digital phone use in Europe; there are 
projected new multi-media data highways, and plans for science 
and technology parks and industry-oriented research centres. 
  The Auto-Europa plant, a Joint Ford-Volkswagen venture, is 
evidence of Portugal's growing competitive edge since it entered 
the EC in 1986. The project is credited with helping push the 
country's manufacturing infrastructure into the next century. 
  The first generation of children born in the democratic era, 
dubbed the "blue jeans and ecology set", are also coming of age. 
  Raised in a multi-party system that tolerates free speech, 
their values are different to those of their parents, who lived 
under the fascists and were taught to respect church and 
authority. 
  But the new generation has its problems, mostly caused by 
the 
generally low standard of the universal and formerly free 
education. 
  Schooling is a national Achilles heel, there were 16 
governments between 1974 and 1987, each with its own education 
programme. 
  The young are locked in a battle for jobs and security and 
face a tide of hard drug and alcohol abuse. Racism, against 
black immigrants is growing. 
  Senhor Eduardo Almeida Catroga, the Finance Minister, 
recently warned that manufacturing competitiveness was being 
compromised by poorly-trained managers, while "generally low 
national levels of schooling" were hurting the modernisation 
drive. 
  His concerns are shared by parents and students, whose 
regular protests have rattled the government over the past two 
years. 
  There was relief in Europe when the present ruling Social 
Democrats won the first of two straight parliamentary majorities 
and secured political stability. 
  The revolution restored democracy, opening the door to EC 
membership, and Senhor Soares, then foreign minister and 
Socialist Party leader, never tired of saying: "The EC is 
Portuguese democracy's life insurance policy." 
  If one figure towers over the rest it is Senhor Soares. 
Polls published this week show 54 per cent of those questioned 
regard him as having the most significant influence on public 
life since 1974. His efforts laid the groundwork for the modern 
Portugal, and many citizens are clearly grateful.

  [Text] [Announcer] Spain has decided to prolong its 
presence in UN Operations in Mozambique [ONUMOZ] with 21 
officers from the three services after the first 20 servicemen 
end their year-long tour of duty. 
  Wednesday [27 April], the last four Spanish officers to 
finish their mission in Mozambique arrive in Madrid. At the 
beginning of March, four came back, and yesterday, 11 others 
returned. 
  The Spanish relief is already deployed in Mozambique. Just 
like the others belonging to the UN force, they are in charge of 
overseeing the peace accords between the Mozambique Liberation 
Front in the government [Frelimo] and the Mozambican National 
Resistance [Renamo] that makes up the guerrillas. 
  Fifteen Civil Guardsmen have been working alongside the 
20-odd Spanish officers for the last few days.

<F P=106> [Jose Maria Brunet report: "Government Satisfied at </F>
Achieving Common Front With Congress Against Corruption"] 
  [Excerpt] Madrid -- The government believes that the state 
of the nation debate was "positive." Minister of Presidency 
Alfredo Perez Rubalcaba said yesterday that the cabinet examined 
the results of these parliamentary sessions and concluded that 
it was emphasized at the sessions that the government and 
parliament "have decided to tackle corruption together," through 
the approval of "a number of measures that include those the 
prime minister presented in his speech and many others from 
other groups." 
  "It is important," he added, "that the public know that 
parliament and government have decided to launch a joint 
struggle against this problem of corruption, and that both, in 
their respective areas of activity, will do everything possible 
to avert this kind of problem in their respective spheres -- 
that is, with respect to the prevention, investigation, and 
punishment of those who commit irregularities in public life." 
<H5>  Parliament's Role </H5>
  Rubalcaba stated that the epithet "positive" that the 
government gives this debate is also based on the fact that 
parliament has regained "the central role" in political life, 
and has debated society's "main concerns" -- the economic crisis 
and corruption. 
  The minister emphasized that, in his opinion, "it was 
possible to demonstrate (in the debate) that the government's 
record over the past 10 months is favorable." "This record," he 
continued, "is especially clear with respect to the struggle 
against the crisis. A parliamentary majority believes that the 
worst is over and we are beginning to have signs of recovery, 
although a section of parliament does not accept this." 
  In addition, the government believes that the debate has 
highlighted the existence of conditions of stability for 
government activity, which is especially important for 
"surmounting the (economic) crisis." "The parliamentary 
stability of government activity," he said, "has emerged 
strengthened," because "the main axis comprising the Socialist 
group and that of Convergence and Union has stood fast."

<F P=106> [Gonzalo Lopez Alba report: "PSOE Deputies Think Solchaga </F>
Should Have Already Resigned"] 
  [Text] PSOE [Spanish Socialist Workers Party] deputies 
think that Carlos Solchaga should have already resigned from his 
post as floor leader of the Socialist Group in parliament 
because, as the net draws tighter around the "Rubio case," it 
will be more difficult to make political capital out of his 
decision. Another part of the group, however, maintains that an 
early resignation would only clear the way for other 
resignations to be demanded, more specifically the resignation 
of [Prime Minister] Felipe Gonzalez. 
  Concern and uncertainty prevail in the climate of 
"temporariness" being experienced by the Socialist Group in 
parliament. The members of the group are already placing bets 
on the candidates best placed to succeed Carlos Solchaga. His 
resignation is felt to be inevitable, especially if it is 
confirmed that the Bank of Spain gave preferred treatment to 
Ibercorp during Mariano Rubio's term, which would demolish the 
defense that the irregularities under investigation were 
committed in the area of private dealings. 
  The Socialist group is divided into three major blocs, which 
do not necessarily correspond to the labels of "renovators" and 
"Guerristas" [Alfonso Guerra supporters], and it would appear 
that a majority is gradually forming that feels that it is 
inevitable that their floor leader must resign. 
  A broad core of deputies thinks that Solchaga should have 
already resigned. Their argument is that the passing time will 
only contribute to letting "the situation rot away" and will 
make it difficult, if not impossible, to make "political 
capital" out of the resignation. These deputies feel that 
Solchaga should have left his post before the debate on the 
state of the nation. 
  Another broad group defend their view that it is necessary 
to 
be extremely cautious when deciding on a time to submit his 
resignation since, if it is done too early, it will quickly be 
forgotten and will only serve to clear the way for demands that 
Felipe Gonzalez himself resign. 
  Lastly, a third group maintains that "since he did not 
resign 
when the scandal broke, then it does not matter if he resigns 
today or in a month's time, because the damage has already been 
done." 
  The government and the PSOE leadership maintain that "we 
will 
decide on the political responsibilities when the time is right, 
not when the opposition or the media want us to." In this 
regard, there is a virtually unanimous feeling that the ideal 
time would be when the public prosecutor investigating the case 
forwards his decision to the judge. The executive feels that 
this could happen late next week. By then, Felipe Gonzalez, who 
will begin an official visit to Romania and Bulgaria next Monday 
[2 May], will have already returned to his office at the Moncloa 
[prime minister's residence]. 
  Socialist sources have pointed out that one of the factors 
that has delayed Solchaga's resignation is that Felipe Gonzalez 
has refused to be deprived of one of his closest collaborators. 
Since the last elections were held, Jose Luis Corcuera and 
Carlos Solchaga, two of his closest advisers, to whom he had 
entrusted a fundamental part of his plan to renovate the PSOE, 
have been jeopardized politically by the Roldan and Rubio cases 
respectively. 
  In the "pools" organized by the Socialist deputies, the 
candidates best placed to replace Solchaga are Joaquin Almunia, 
another former minister, and the Minister of Presidency Alfredo 
Perez Rubalcaba. However, appointing the former would leave a 
major hole in the PSOE executive, since he is felt to be the 
"strong man" of the renovators, whereas appointing the latter 
would force a government reshuffle and would deprive it of 
someone who is beginning to be categorized in Socialist circles 
as "de facto deputy prime minister."

<F P=106> [A.M. report: "Solchaga Avoids Making Statement on </F>
Resignation, Emphasizes `Very Good' Relations Between PSOE and 
CiU"] 
  [Text] Carlos Solchaga, floor leader of the Socialist group 
in parliament, yesterday avoided making a statement on whether 
he will hand in his resignation as a PSOE [Spanish Socialist 
Workers Party] official at the Congress of Deputies. On the 
contrary, he alluded -- albeit indirectly -- to his intention to 
carry on in his post. Nevertheless, during a lunch in which, 
together with Miguel Roca of the CiU [Convergence and Union] he 
presented the book Catalonia by the Year 2010, 
Solchaga did not wish to talk openly, preferring to block -- 
without being able to conceal his discomfort -- any reference to 
his resignation. 
  When his turn came to comment on the contents of the book, 
the PSOE leader asked the other participants if they could hear 
well from all the seats. On his left, from the end of the 
table, a journalist commented out loud "well enough to hear a 
resignation." With an annoyed expression, and facing a tense 
silence, the former economy minister responded, as if he had not 
heard (although it was perfectly audible): "Excuse me?" The 
journalist, somewhat embarrassed, excused himself by saying "it 
was just a comment," which Solchaga, in a clearly annoyed tone, 
dismissed with a contemptuous "brilliant, quite brilliant." 
  Afterwards, his speech, which was listened to with great 
anticipation, as have all his speeches since last Monday [25 
April] when he placed his mandate at the executive's disposal, 
was often full of praise for the CiU, and especially Miguel 
Roca. He defined the PSOE's relations with the center-right 
nationalist coalition as "frank and very good," and said they 
were a substantial factor in achieving political governability 
"at a time of tension and a time when we do not have an absolute 
majority." He then sent a message that can be interpreted as an 
intention to carry on in his post as the Socialist spokesman in 
the Congress of Deputies. Solchaga said: "I am going to make a 
political statement so that no doubt remains: I am working and 
will continue to work -- with the agreement of my party -- to 
ensure that these relations (with the CiU) are optimal." It is 
true that at no time did he say whether he was thinking of 
carrying out this task as the head of the Socialist Group or as 
an ordinary rank-and-file deputy. 
  The praise heaped on the spokesman for the Catalan Group, 
however, exceeded even that lavished on the CiU. He said that 
"as long as people like Roca, and others, are around, the 
political scenarios for Catalonia and Spain are likely to be 
positive. And I will promote these relations without the 
slightest reservation."

<F P=106> [Unattributed report: "Aznar Believes Early Election Is </F>
Only Solution"] 
  [Text] Madrid -- People's Party Chairman Jose Maria Aznar 
believes that the state of the nation debate did not enable the 
government to restore confidence to the Spanish people or 
society to believe that a resolute struggle against inflation 
will really be undertaken now, because there is no reason to 
believe that a government that has done nothing in so many years 
will do so now; he therefore believes that the solution is an 
early election, which he asserts will come soon. 
  In an interview on the Antena 3 television channel, the 
People's Party chairman forecast that there will be an early 
election soon because "a weak government, under suspicion, with 
problems of corruption, unemployment, and daily pressures, is a 
situation that I do not believe the public wants to last for 
long." 
  However, Aznar continued to defend the correctness of the 
stance of the People's Party, which called on Gonzalez to resign 
in the debate, instead of submitting a censure motion. The main 
opposition party's leader explained that the People's Party 
eschewed this possibility "because it did not seem reasonable to 
me, since an election was held just 10 months ago." 
  Aznar was pessimistic about the possibility that the state 
of 
the nation debate and the resolutions will serve to tackle 
corruption, and stated that the experience of the past few years 
shows that the struggle against corruption has been 
unsuccessful. "Those who have temporized with corruption, 
tolerated it, and protected it through their actions or 
omissions," he said, "cannot combat corruption, and so I expect 
very little from the measures that the government has proposed." 
  What the People's Party chairman does expect is that 
"citizens will react in order to combat corruption," and he 
added that "the powerlessness that many people feel will be 
surmounted, but not because of what is going to be done by the 
government, which will do nothing, but because most citizens may 
have already decided that corruption must be combated," 
referring to the possiblity of changing this through the polls. 
<H5>  Change of Attitudes </H5>
  "The next national election will see what Spain needs most 
-- 
a change of attitudes and of policy that will serve to guarantee 
the Spanish people's future," he said. The People's Party 
leader also took the opportunity to convey "calm and confidence" 
to the Spanish people, "because, however difficult the 
circumstances -- and they are -- Spain will move ahead, and we 
must trust in ourselves and in the possibilities of our nation 
and democracy, which have the means -- essentially through 
alternation -- to surmount difficult circumstances." 
  Aznar doubted the government's will to combat corruption, 
"because, during the state of the nation debate," he said, 
"Felipe Gonzalez' credibility was put to the test" in the voting 
on the People's Party proposal to set up a specific committee on 
Filesa, which the Socialists opposed. He described as 
"irresponsible" the Spanish Socialist Workers Party's trying to 
"smear everything" and all the parties with corruption, although 
he asserted that he has no objection to People's Party funding 
being investigated. Aznar deems it urgent to combat corruption, 
"because it harms democracy, and a blow has been dealt to the 
institutions' credibility." 
  In addition, Abel Matutes, the People's Party candidate in 
the European elections, stated in Ibiza that "Felipe Gonzalez 
wishes to end corruption," and expressed his desire for "this 
intention to succeed," although he specified that "there are 
political responsibilities," according to EFE.

<F P=106> [G. Lopez Alba report: "Polls Used by Government Show </F>
People's Party Two to Five Points Ahead of Spanish Socialist 
Workers' Party"] 
  [Text] Madrid -- The People's Party [PP] currently has a 
2-5 percent lead over the PSOE [Spanish Socialist Workers Party] 
in voting intentions, according to the polls used by the 
government. This lead is cut for predictions for the European 
elections, although polls carried out by the PP give it a lead 
in this case of between five and seven points. Elements in the 
PSOE believe that, after the European elections, [Prime 
Minister] Felipe Gonzalez will have to change the composition of 
his government. 
  Before it was the economic crisis, now it is corruption. 
According to all the opinion polls -- those used by the 
government and those commissioned by Jose Maria Aznar's PP -- 
while voting intentions for the PSOE continue to follow a 
downward trend, those for the PP continue to rise. 
  The opinion polls the government is working with give the PP 
a two to five point lead in voting intentions if a general 
election were to be held now. However, government sources state 
that voting intentions were "somewhat better" when the people 
polled were asked how they would vote in the upcoming European 
elections on 12 June. 
  This evaluation, however, contradicts the polls used by the 
PP. PP sources put its lead for the European elections at 
around five or six points, which would give it a cushion of 20 
to 28 seats. 
  It is clear from the government polls that the main cause of 
the Socialists' electoral decline is their loss of credibility 
resulting from the corruption scandals. In this respect, our 
sources indicate that, although the people polled can still not 
clearly see the signs of economic recovery, they are beginning 
to "feel" it. With regard to corruption, government sources 
admit that "at times we have reacted too slowly" in the face of 
corruption allegations. 
  Despite the fact that the results of the polls are not very 
promising, the Socialists are confident that they can avoid the 
European elections being an electoral catastrophe with wider 
implications for the national political situation. 
  Elements in the PSOE believe that, after these elections 
Felipe Gonzalez will have to reshuffle his cabinet to give fresh 
impetus to government action -- something that the Guerristas 
[Alfonso Guerra supporters] demanded after the federal congress. 
  Representatives of the group headed by PSOE Deputy General 
Secretary Alfonso Guerra still believe that the inclusion of a 
Guerrista in the government would contribute to a faster healing 
of the party's open wounds. 
  Certain Socialist leaders also believe that this government 
reshuffle should be followed by the decision to hold a vote of 
confidence in parliament, although this would mean forcing the 
Catalan Convergence and Union [CiU] party to again demonstrate 
its support for the Socialist government.

<F P=106> [Unattributed report: "Cuevas Maintains That UGT's Proposal </F>
Is More of Same Thing"] 
  [Excerpt] Madrid -- CEOE [Spanish Confederation of 
Employers Organizations] Chairman Jose Maria Cuevas did not 
appear too hopeful yesterday afternoon about the possibility 
that social dialogue -- between the government, employers, and 
trade unions -- will be resumed. In his opinion, the proposal 
of consultation made a few hours earlier by General Workers 
Union Secretary General Candido Mendez means more of the same 
thing, since it entails a radical reconsideration of the labor 
reform currently passing through parliament, COLPISA reports. 
  The statements by the bosses' boss were made in the Senate 
where he went like the other social interlocutors in order to 
set out his views on changing the labor regulations. 
  The CEOE chairman reiterated to the Social and Employment 
Policy Committee that the approaching changes "are 
insufficient." He stated once more that the cost of dismissals 
remains high under the bills. 
<H5>  "Imposition" </H5>
  Jose Maria Cuevas initially described Candido Mendez' 
proposal as "useful," but later said that it is "an imposition." 
He stated that the withdrawal of the labor reform must be 
negotiated with "the parents who made it" -- not with the CEOE. 
"With the deputies, with the government, with the parliamentary 
forces, and so forth," he counted, while emphasizing that the 
reform is necessary and urgent. 
  In short, in the employers' leader's opinion, the proposal 
by 
Nicolas Redondo's replacement "has begun badly because it is to 
return to where we were." 
  The CEOE chairman refused to comment on Felipe Gonzalez' 
speech. He argued that his tight schedule prevented him from 
following the Congress of Deputies debate. However, he 
explained that he does not share the government's optimistic 
view on emerging from the crisis. "Some economic indicators are 
recovering, but not the country's economy. I do not believe 
that we are in a process of clear expansion," he specified. 
  He reiterated the employers' will to negotiate on an 
agreement for employment "if the trade unions' proposal is 
sincere," he emphasized. [passage omitted]

  [Text] The Bolivian foreign affairs and finance ministers 
begin an official visit to Spain today in Madrid in search of 
business partners among Spanish firms for their state 
telecommunications, electricity, petrol, gas, air transport, and 
railway companies. 
  Bolivian Foreign Minister Antonio Aranibar Quiroga and 
Finance Minister Fernando Alvaro Cosio [name as received], have 
a full agenda including meetings with King Juan Carlos, Prime 
Minister Felipe Gonzalez, Foreign Minister Javier Solana, as 
well as Justice Minister Alberto Belloch, Interior Minister 
Antoni Asuncion, and Trade Minister Javier Gomez-Navarro. In 
addition, they will have a business breakfast with Spanish 
businessmen. 
  Bolivia has started a program of state company 
privatizations 
in which the private partner will take total control of the 
management for an ongoing term and will be the sole owner of the 
profits. 
  Spanish aid for Bolivia is another item on the agenda. Since 
1989 Spain has granted credits to Bolivia worth $200 million, 
half of which have been used, while the rest is waiting for the 
Bolivian projects to be financed to be identified.

  [Text] President Rauf Denktas has declared that the only 
reason for the deadlock in the proximity talks concerning the 
implementation of the confidence-building measures package 
consists of the changes in favor of the Greek Cypriots 
introduced into the original package. Denktas said: If the 
Greek Cypriots had remained loyal to the original package and if 
the UN Secretariat General had not agreed to any changes, as 
demanded of us, then these difficulties would probably not have 
arisen. 
  Denktas held a news conference this afternoon following the 
announcement by Joe Clark, UN secretary general's special envoy 
in Cyprus, that the negotiating process with regard to the 
implementation of the confidence-building measures package has 
broken down, after a meeting with Denktas. Explaining that the 
Greek Cypriots asked for a change, were granted this wish, and 
did their utmost to undermine the package, Denktas said: They 
can rejoice that they have succeeded in doing this. Anyway, no 
Greek Cypriot leader was in favor of this package in the 
beginning. Kliridhis himself had accepted the package, because 
it suited his tactics. 
  The change introduced to the package allows planes from 
Greek 
Cypriot airlines to use the Lefkosa [Nicosia] International 
Airport, while the use of the airport by Turkish Cypriot planes 
is based on the condition that all writings and logos be removed 
from the planes, Denktas remarked. He noted that Kliridhis is 
pretending to accept the package, knowing that it will be 
rejected by the Turkish Cypriot side and this will make it 
easier for the Greek Cypriots to become a member of the European 
Union [EU]. Expressing the hope that the EU will approach the 
Cyprus issue in a more positive light in the future, Denktas 
said that if the matter is approached in a realistic way, the 
Greek Cypriots will resort to every possible maneuver to remain 
the legitimate Cyprus government on the island and will continue 
to deceive the world. 
  Denktas declared: We displayed a sensitive and constructive 
stand, but the Greek Cypriots' tactics led this matter into an 
impasse.

  [Text] The last-minute effort by the UN representatives to 
achieve agreement on the confidence-building measures has ended 
with no results. Joe Clark, the UN secretary general's special 
representative, said after his meeting today with Rauf Denktas: 
I have no agreement to announce. 
  Mr. Clark added that after this meeting he does not think 
there is any reason for further consultations. Mr. Clark 
further noted that he wants to think about what he has discussed 
here as well as about his meetings with the representatives of 
Greece and Turkey before he proceeds with any recommendations. 
  In a statement after his meeting with Joe Clark, Rauf 
Denktas 
said that he expects responsibility for the deadlock in the 
talks will be attributed to the Turkish Cypriot side. According 
to REUTER, Rauf Denktas said that he foresees that the Turkish 
Cypriot side will be accused of refusing to accept the demands 
of the Greek Cypriot side which, as he put it, have been added 
to the initial package of measures proposed by the United 
Nations. Denktas noted: We will be accused again because we do 
not give in to anything that the Greek Cypriots demand. At this 
point, REUTER points out that Joe Clark denied repeatedly that 
the confidence-building measures package had been changed 
considerably in favor of the Greek Cypriot side. At the same 
time, revealing once again the Turkish Cypriot side's true 
intentions, the Turkish Cypriot leader said that the Cyprus 
issue cannot be solved so long as the international community 
recognizes the Government of the Republic of Cyprus as the only 
legal government in Cyprus. Denktas added: The price that we 
will pay for not accepting this situation is much smaller than 
the one we would pay if we accept it. 
  Earlier today, Mr. Clark had a meeting with President 
Glavkos 
Kliridhis, who reiterated to Joe Clark that, if Rauf Denktas 
does not accept the document within the framework of the time 
limit set by the Security Council, he sees no reason to continue 
discussion on the confidence-building measures nor does he 
intend to continue. Government spokesman Ioannis Kasoulidhis 
briefed the journalists in this connection and said that our 
side is now awaiting the UN secretary general's report to be 
submitted; it will record the facts and should attribute 
responsibility where they should be. 
  Joe Clark and Gustave Feissel are now briefing the 
ambassadors of the five permanent members of the Security 
Council. 
  A senior government source has told the Cyprus Broadcasting 
Corporation that now the UN secretary general's representatives 
also attribute responsibility to the Turkish side for the 
failure of the proximity talks. According to the same source, 
at least two countries of the European Union [EU]--Britain and 
Germany--now agree with the Cyprus Government's position that 
the process for Cypriot accession to the EU should be expedited, 
and this is something that would work to put pressure on the 
Turkish side. The government source made this statement after 
the meeting President Glavkos Kliridhis had this morning with 
the UN officials and after a meeting the president also had with 
the German ambassador to Cyprus.

  [Text] Prime Minister Hakki Atun has stated that the 
Turkish Cypriot side did its utmost regarding the proximity 
talks on the confidence-building measures. 
  In a statement to BRT [Bayrak Radio and Television], Atun 
recalled that the Turkish Cypriot side took chances by 
displaying its goodwill when it accepted the package in 
principle so that the talks would continue. Atun added, 
however, that the advantages to the Turkish Cypriot side did not 
materialize in the package. Indicating that the Greek Cypriots 
changed the package to their favor, Atun said the Turkish 
Cypriot side's requests and concerns are always disregarded. 
  Pointing out that the UN officials asked for other areas in 
addition to Maras [Varosha], Atun stressed that it is out of 
question to accept a package which is unacceptable to the 
people, in which embargoes are not eased, and in which there are 
no concrete gains for the Turkish Cypriot side.

<F P=106> ["Text" of statement by Ozker Ozgur, Turkish Cypriot </F>
minister of state and deputy prime minister and leader of the 
Republican Turkish Party, in Nicosia on 28 April -- recorded] 
  [Text] The indirect talks on the package of 
confidence-building measures seem to have broken off. However, 
I do not wish to draw the conclusion that the talks have 
completely broken off. It is common knowledge that the 
confidence-building measures package is a whole package. The 
indirect talks focused on three or four main points, which were 
related to the question of access from south Cyprus to Maras 
[Varosha], the map of the area, the use of Nicosia International 
Airport by the airline companies, and the customs procedures. 
  The question of access from south Cyprus to the closed area 
of Maras was brought up in the meeting that was held today. 
However, Joe Clark, the UN secretary general's special 
representative, did not wish to inform the Turkish Cypriot side 
of the Greek Cypriot side's approach and the UN officials' views 
on the other matters. 
  I have already said that the package is a whole package. It 
has been described as the confidence-building measures package. 
In view of that, a middle way cannot be found if the views of 
the sides on the whole of the package are not brought to light. 
Selecting only one issue from the package and concentrating on 
it without focusing attention on the others will not move the 
sides anywhere. In other words, a mistake has been made in 
connection with the method that has been applied in the process. 
That mistake has to be quickly rectified. 
  Therefore, Mr. Joe Clark must make an appropriate assessment 
on the situation at this point. He must seriously consider what 
he should do to resuscitate the negotiations process.

  [Text] The indirect talks on the implementation of the 
package of confidence-building measures have ended without any 
agreement. Speaking after the talks he held with President Rauf 
Denktas today, Joe Clark, the UN secretary general's special 
representative, said that an agreement has not been reached and 
no progress has been made on the problem. President Denktas 
said later that the talks ended at an impasse and broke off as a 
result of the Greek Cypriot side's irreconcilable approach and 
the holes that have been drilled in the confidence-building 
measures package. 
  [Begin Denktas recording] The only reason for the conclusion 
of the exercise in this way is the move they [UN officials] made 
to include a road in the package, which the two sides agreed to 
at the beginning on the condition that a change would not be 
made in it. They asked that our troops be withdrawn from that 
road. They abandoned their request for the withdrawal of our 
troops today. Instead, they said that the troops must not be 
visible from that road. How will they not be visible? We said 
that that is not the only problem. We have another pending 
problem, which is related to their map. We said: The process 
will collapse if you insist on that map because we do not accept 
it. You have given two maps to us. The first map was given to 
us in New York on 1 May 1993. It was a realistic map, which 
depicted the fenced area. We began the process of the talks on 
the basis of that map. However, you submitted a new map one and 
a half months ago. It took a piece of land from our military 
area, a piece of land that has no connection with the fenced 
area. Therefore, we cannot accept that map. 
  He [Joe Clark] said that the map was placed on the 
negotiation table and that the talks would collapse if we did 
not accept it. Well, why have you forced us to hold talks on the 
question of access to Maras [Varosha] since the talks will 
collapse because of that map? We cannot agree to that map. 
  Furthermore, we said that you have mentioned the question of 
the use of the Nicosia Airport by Greek Cypriot passenger 
aircraft. That matter was not included in the package. 
Obviously, that is an addition to the package. Glavkos 
Kliridhis put forward the condition that the airline companies 
based in Cyprus would not use the airport. He also said that 
that applied to the Cyprus Airways company. That is how we 
agreed to the package. However, we were informed later that the 
Cyprus Airways company would use the airport. Kliridhis further 
said that the Turkish Cypriot Airlines company could use the 
airport on the condition that its aircraft had no inscription or 
logos on them. That meant that the Turkish Cypriot passenger 
aircraft would take off and land like pirate aircraft. 
  Well, the concept of equality is a basic principle. We have 
asked whether or not the same conditions would apply to the 
Greek Cypriot passenger aircraft if we agreed to allow them to 
use the Nicosia Airport. Will the inscriptions and logos on the 
Greek Cypriot aircraft be erased? Will the Greek Cypriot 
aircraft be under the UN administrator's control, as is the case 
with the Turkish Cypriot aircraft? Will the Greek Cypriot 
aircraft be registered in Athens? If not, then will the Greek 
Cypriot side agree to the registration of our passenger aircraft 
in Nicosia? Does the Greek Cypriot side agree to all that? 
  He said that the Greek Cypriots will not agree to all that. 
The Greek Cypriot passenger aircraft will use Nicosia Airport 
under their company name but will comply with the UN 
administrator's conditions. Considering our demand for 
equality, we asked whether the Turkish Cypriot aircraft would be 
allowed only one flight if the Greek Cypriots ask for the right 
to fly once a day? All that has not been clarified. 
  We have been informed that a fair and just system will be 
established. However, the additions that have been made are 
such that they will cause the package to collapse. The 
recognition of that right for the Cyprus Airways Company will be 
tantamount to recognizing the most fundamental political right 
for the Greek Cypriot side at our expense. However, they do not 
wish to realize that state of affairs. As far as they are 
concerned, that right is very natural and the Cyprus Airways 
Company can benefit from it. 
  As far as we are concerned, we cannot move any further in 
light of such an approach. Meanwhile, a tangible form has not 
yet been given to the rights they have promised to give to us. 
  We have been talking on the package. However, he informed us 
today that we should take up the issues one by one, starting 
with the question of access [to Varosa]. Why should we discuss 
the question of access? It is related to your map, which I do 
not accept. First, you should correct that map. We can hold 
talks on it later. Considering the rights you have given to the 
Greek Cypriots, let us use the northern part of Dhimokratias 
Avenue. However, they have not even bothered to discuss the 
matter. 
  In view of all that, I believe that they will probably 
consider the matter once again. A new UN report may be drawn 
up, in which we may be reprimanded. Nevertheless, considering 
the promise we have made to our Republican Assembly, we have 
acted with goodwill and moderation and maintained the talks 
until now by agreeing to many points. Otherwise, the talks 
would have ended a long time ago. 
  Mr. Clark is well aware of the fact that the UN officials 
placed two maps on the negotiation table and that we have agreed 
to the concept of holding talks on the fenced part of Maras. 
Nevertheless, he disregarded that and said that is the map which 
has been placed on the negotiation table, you have to accept it, 
and it cannot be changed. That approach has undermined 
everything. [end recording]

  [Text] Turkish Foreign Minister Hikmet Cetin has stated 
that Turkey wants a just, permanent, viable, and realistic 
solution in Cyprus. After attending the meeting of the Islamic 
Conference Organization's Bosnia-Herzegovina Contact Group in 
New York, Cetin returned to Turkey. 
  In a statement he issued at Istanbul's Ataturk Airport on 
his 
return, Cetin said Turkey wants a Cyprus solution more than 
anybody else. Cetin stressed, however, that a solution which 
will result in reestablishing the pre-1974 hardships is not 
possible. Indicating that the leaders of the two communities 
meeting between themselves is a means toward a realistic 
solution, Cetin stated that on this issue Turkey supports the 
Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus and will continue to do so. 
Cetin further noted that there can be no question of applying 
pressure regarding this issue.

  [Text] The ambassadors of the five UN Security Council 
permanent members in Nicosia said their governments are 
disappointed and concerned over the situation described by Joe 
Clark concerning his efforts for the confidence-building 
measures. This was noted in a communique issued late this 
afternoon after the five ambassadors met at the British High 
Commission with the UN official on the Cyprus issue. 
  The communique, which was read to the journalists by British 
Deputy High Commissioner Colin Jennings, also notes that Joe 
Clark informed the five ambassadors that after his meeting with 
Rauf Denktas he has decided that there is no reason at this 
stage to continue the consultations. The communique recalls 
that the Security Council members fully support the UN Secretary 
General's efforts and it was they who had asked Butrus-Ghali to 
submit a complete report to the Security Council. 
  In a statement to journalists after the communique was read, 
Mr. Clark reiterated that he would like to give some thought to 
the recommendations before submitting them to the secretary 
general. He added that when this process is complete, there 
will be a clear record of what was proposed, what was rejected, 
and by whom. Mr. Clark also said that there is no reason for 
him to enter into discussions about who is responsible. 
  The UN official on the Cyprus issue will leave Cyprus 
tomorrow morning.

  [Text] Joe Clark, the UN secretary general's special 
envoy, has expressed his feeling that there will be consequences 
from the failure of the talks on the confidence-building 
measures and added that nobody can predict what these 
consequences will be. 
  Before leaving Cyprus this morning, Mr. Clark told CyBC 
[Cyprus Broadcasting Corporation] that in the end all the 
Cypriot people will pay the price for the failure of the talks. 
He noted that Rauf Denktas was very hasty in stating that the 
process had collapsed, and added that Denktas has ulterior 
motives for what he does and says. Mr. Clark added: I cannot 
say anything else except that Denktas intentionally and hastily 
said our efforts had collapsed. Mr. Clark said the United 
Nations must decide to continue its mission and to study 
seriously the suggestions he will submit later. 
  Mr. Clark also noted that there has not been enough good 
faith or political will to solve the problems. When asked what 
should be done to create such a will, he said that in addition 
to the two leaders in Cyprus there are other voices which should 
probably be encouraged to take a bigger part in the 
consultations.

  [Text] A British major in the Secret Services, who is based 
at Episkopi on Akrotiri Base, is in "Direct Liaison" with the 
Turkish Secret Services. The same English spy participated in 
the mixed team of English-American spies who acted at Larnaca 
Airport when an aircraft was transporting war materiel for the 
defense of Cyprus. He travels in a "Land Rover" with a Cypriot 
license plate, and he has been seen many times entering the 
Turkish-occupied areas at Dhekelia-Pergamos. 
  I MAKHI reveals today that: "He is Major Edwin Dougan, who 
is one of the leading members of the British Espionage Service 
MI-6, serving (seemingly) at the Episkopi Camp." 
  The "hardcore team" of the English-American spies who were 
arrested by members of the National Guard--and then handed over 
to the police--consisted of three officers: Two English and one 
American. According to I MAKHI's information, English Maj. 
Edwin Dougan of the "MI-6" was the "companion...." of American 
Maj. Scott David Dorney, assistant military attache at the U.S. 
Embassy. Coordinator of these two spies was Lieutenant Colonel 
John Anderson, who serves as military attache at the British 
High Commission. 
  I MAKHI has information revealing that on the day of his 
"espionage action" Edwin Dougan was traveling in a "Land Rover" 
with civilian license plate numbers BB495. 
  Diplomatic sources have revealed to I MAKHI that the "Land 
Rover" with license plate BB495 has been seen many times in the 
past heading for the Turkish-occupied areas and entering these 
areas from the direction of Dhekelia-Pergamos. 
  According to other I MAKHI's information, American Maj. 
Scott 
David Dorney graduated from the War School of Greece in 
1989-1990, speaks Greek fluently, and frequently visits Greece. 
  However, concerning this serious case of espionage against 
the defense of Cyprus and the security of the Republic of 
Cyprus, although there is no official follow-up to it--for the 
time being--the competent security authorities (Central 
Intelligence Service and the Second Staff Bureau of the National 
Guard General Staff) "have not been inactive." 
  Every piece of information is evaluated and cross-checked 
carefully. It appears that the tentacles of espionage against 
the National Guard are long. 
  What causes concern are that the recipients (as was also 
revealed by I MAKHI) of the espionage material are the Turks and 
what the spies' aims are. 
  Meanwhile, the English and American diplomatic spokesmen in 
Nicosia deny all this "about espionage and they do not want to 
hear another word...." 
  Moreover, in order to show that their men are not 
spies...they have announced that "their men are not going to be 
sent home...." In any case, the American Dorney and the 
Englishmen Anderson and Dougan have cut their movements to a 
minimum, rarely leaving their offices....

  [Text] KKE [Greek Communist Party] Secretary General Aleka 
Papariga returned from her official visit to Cyprus, where she 
met with Cypriot President Glavkos Kliridhis and Cypriot party 
leaders. 
  In a statement issued on the Cyprus issue, Mrs. Papariga 
maintained that the United States, Britain, and Turkey are not 
interested in a specific way out of the problem. She noted: It 
is more to their benefit that Cyprus remain as it is, with a 
sort of a de facto partition, so they can intervene for their 
own interests in the region. Mrs. Papariga stressed that what 
we need in Greece today is pressure on the government to change 
its direction on the Cyprus issue. 
  Commenting on Prime Minister Andreas Papandreou's meetings 
in 
the United States on the Cyprus issue, Mrs. Papariga said: 
Alas, if we stay with President Clinton's assurances, 
particularly when we know his more general [words indistinct] 
role in the Balkans.

justification. 
  This decision has been made by the Guerrilla Command, which

This difficult decision was made after taking into 
consideration the fact that the Command knows very well that no 
one arrested is in any way responsible, since those who carried 
out the mission returned to their base safely. [passage omitted]

    [Editorial Report] The discussion regarding the name and 
intentions of The Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia (FYROM) 
continued to attract the attention of the Greek press. 
<H5>  `Collective Neurosis' on FYROM Criticized </H5>
  Writing in the 5 April Athens daily I KATHIMERINI, Thanos 
Lipovats, professor of political psychology at Pandios 
University, remarks that "the nationalistic, anti-European, and 
anti-American hysteria of the last few weeks--led by part of the 
press, the mass media, the parties, and the Orthodox 
Church--with regard to the present clash of interests with the 
FYROM resembles the symptoms of a collective neurosis." Seeking 
the reasons for such "hysteria," Lipovats notes that FYROM is a 
"small, new country of people with little historical background 
that has tried too hastily to acquire an identity by abusing the 
symbols of a neighbor [Greece] with an ancient history." 
Lipovats argues that the "Slavo-Macedonian majority" in the 
FYROM is not politically homogeneous, with only part of it being 
"chauvinistic and anti-Greek" while the majority still views 
Greece favorably. The Greek Government's "feckless" policy 
toward the Macedonia issue in the last four years has reinforced 
the intransigence of certain elements of the FYROM's population; 
in addition, what Lipovats terms the "foolish" talk about an 
"Islamic arc" and an opposing "Orthodox arc" has led to Greece's 
isolation within the European Union (EU) and pushed the FYROM to 
seek support from Turkey. Contending that the resulting 
confusion has encouraged "backward, conservative, and 
anti-European forces" in Greece, Lipovats writes that the 
"so-called national consensus" on the FYROM has created an 
"unholy alliance between church and state based on the abuse of 
both history and religion." The violence of the Greek attitude 
on FYROM, manifested through newspaper articles, rallies, and 
political pronouncements, is unrelated to the reality of the 
FYROM issue, which is of "limited and undramatic" importance, 
Lipovats concludes. 
<H5>  Andrianopoulos Accepts `Macedonia' as Geographic Unit </H5>
  A brief commentary in the 10 April Athens weekly KIRIAKATIKI 
ELEVTHEROTIPIA states that New Democracy (ND) luminary Andreas 
Andrianopoulos praised Bulgaria for recognizing FYROM as the 
"Republic of Macedonia" based on the argument that this "is a 
mere geographical term and, moreover, its inhabitants are not 
Macedonians but Bulgarians." Andrianopoulos is reported as 
saying that Greece "could have taken the same tack, remaining 
unconcerned about the name issue and recognizing Skopje's 
geographical entity, but reserving the right to take action in 
response to possible future talk about the `unredeemed nation of 
Macedonians.'" "It is not coincidental," Andrianopoulos is 
quoted as saying, that the Macedonians "have not uttered a word 
about Bulgaria." 
<H5>  Deal Advocated on Macedonia Name Issue </H5>
  An article in the 9 April Athens daily ELEVTHEROTIPIA cites 
ND deputy and former Minister of Education Yeoryios Souflias as 
saying that Greece should negotiate with the FYROM on a 
composite name that would include the term "Macedonia" followed 
by a geographical definition. The article reports that at a 
recent speech in Salonica, Souflias said that "instead of 
aspiring to the most desirable, it is time to move in the 
direction of the most achievable."

  [Editorial Report] The Greek press has covered developments 
at the recently concluded Panhellenic Socialist Movement (PASOK) 
congress. 
<H5>  Alevras Criticizes Leadership </H5>
  According to an article in the 16 April Athens daily 
ELEVTHEROTIPIA, PASOK oldtimer and former president of the 
Chamber of Deputies Yiannis Alevras unleashed a series of 
attacks during the PASOK congress directed at what he claimed is 
"the total takeover of PASOK by large economic interests." 
Alevras is cited as saying that "socialism is not only an 
ideology but a lifestyle as well." Those who govern, he added, 
must live within the "most transparent of walls." He criticized 
the government for forgetting the "still existing 
underprivileged" Greeks and for its "continuing unstable 
course," accusing it of being concerned solely with the economic 
crisis and its diplomatic efforts on Macedonia. Alevras blamed 
the party leadership for organizing the congress with "unseemly 
haste" and for "hunting votes." The article notes the attack 
was a "first" for Alevras, who declared he is not a candidate 
for any position. An editorial in the 16 April ELEVTHEROTIPIA 
noted that the much-applauded Alevras "told many truths," which 
are subscribed to by all concerned about the crisis of 
confidence that prevails in Greek political life. The editorial 
also noted that government spokesman Evangelos Venizelos, whose 
reply to Alevras' statements was "rather ironical," did not show 
Alevras the respect he deserves. 
<H5>  Simitas on Solution of Country's Problems </H5>
  The same article in the 16 April ELEVTHEROTIPIA reported 
Minister of Industry and Commerce Kostas Simitis as indirectly 
criticizing the government during the congress. Simitis 
declared that the country will solve its problems by achieving a 
competitive economy through interaction with the international 
environment, ending the tendency to make "subjects" out of 
"citizens," redistributing income and wealth by taxing large 
economic interests, becoming more sensitive on tax evasion 
matters, and no longer allowing party members to become "mere 
professional politicians." He added that "unity" must become the 
PASOK password. 
<H5>  Liani Against `Religious Lobbies' </H5>
  In the same article, the prime minister's wife, Dhimitra 
Liani, is reported to have sent the congress a written "proposal 
for consideration" focusing on the "protection of Hellenism and 
Orthodoxy" and the attention to be paid to the plight of Pondian 
Greeks. She warned against the "religious lobbies that exert 
pressure and even achieve the goal of military intervention," as 
well as against the "economic interests using religion as a 
disguise that are changing the balance in the Balkans." 
<H5>  Yennimatas, Vaso Papandreou Statements </H5>
  The same article reported that ailing Minister of National 
Economy Yiorgos Yennimatas' written message to the congress 
counseling unity and the preservation of a united front on 
Greece's national issues of Cyprus, Thraki, the Aegean, the 
Balkans, Skopje, and Ipiros met with enthusiastic applause. The 
article also reports that former Eurodeputy and present PASOK 
deputy Vaso Papandreou declared that during the government's 
first five months mistakes were made concerning certain policies 
and choices of people. Such errors must not be repeated, she 
said, if the Greek people are not to be disappointed in the 
PASOK government. Papandreou charged that internal democracy is 
not functioning and that transparency and meritocracy are 
lacking. She also denounced, as she had done in the past, the 
"brotherly knifings" that are increasingly occurring "under the 
table." While not putting into question Prime Minister Andreas 
Papandreou's role and contribution, the former Eurodeputy said 
"this does not mean that party organs must be downgraded." 
According to an article in the 16 April Athens daily TA NEA, 
Vaso Papandreou's statements provoked the anger of PASOK central 
committee member Kostas Paipoutlidhis, who followed her on the 
podium. Paipoutlidhis attacked Vaso Papandreou and others like 
her who "monopolize publicity" by being mentioned daily in the 
news. He also accused her of being absent from the PASOK 
struggle in 1989, "ensconced as she was in the comfortable 
salons of Brussels." Paipoutlidhis's reaction was greeted by 
"pandemonium," the article reports, and split the congress 
between those who applauded him and a majority who criticized 
him.

  [Text] Foreign Minister Hikmet Cetin has stated that 
Turkey expects more determination from the United Nations 
regarding the Bosnia-Herzegovina issue and asked the embargo on 
Bosnia be lifted if NATO's recent decisions are not effective. 
Cetin issued statements at Istanbul's Ataturk Airport after 
returning from New York, where he had gone to attend the meeting 
of the Islamic Conference Organization's [ICO] 
Bosnia-Herzegovina Contact Group. 
  Cetin said that the urgent measures necessary to stop the 
tragedy in Bosnia-Herzegovina were discussed at the meeting and 
stated that the issues agreed upon were compiled into a 22-item 
statement. Cetin indicated that this statement was announced to 
the world and also submitted to the UN Security Council. 
  Cetin noted that the statement issued by the ICO Contact 
Group stresses once more the international failure regarding the 
attacks on Gorazde, which is declared a safe haven by the United 
Nations. Noting that the Belgrade administration and its 
extensions are wholly responsible for the genocide in 
Bosnia-Herzegovina, the statement requests the International 
Court -- established to judge war crimes -- to start work at 
once. The statement further notes that the ICO supports all 
international efforts aimed at stopping the cruelty in Bosnia 
and points to the necessity of having international protection 
for the people of Sandzak and Kosovo. 
  Cetin explained that he delivered a speech at the UN 
Security 
Council pointing out the necessity of having more determined and 
urgent actions taken by the United Nations. Indicating that 700 
lives were lost in Gorazde because of the lack of this 
determination, Cetin said that he had expressed this view at the 
UN Security Council. Cetin said: 
  [Begin Cetin recording] I have once more expressed that 
Turkey expects more determination from the United Nations. I 
also clearly stated that it is necessary to lift the arms 
embargo on Bosnia-Herzegovina if NATO decisions are ineffective 
and the Bosnians given the right to self-defense. [end 
recording] 
  Cetin also stated that, while in New York, he held a meeting 
with the U.S. representative to the United Nations on the 
Turkey-Iraq oil pipeline. Cetin said that he explained to the 
U.S. representative that Turkey is not after an implementation 
which ignores the UN embargo. Pointing out that Turkey's direct 
and indirect losses from this issue amounted to $20 billion, 
Cetin said that, notwithstanding, Turkey abides by the UN 
resolutions. Explaining that new and greater losses may incur 
from the inactive pipeline, Cetin said Turkey's aim is an 
initiative to use the pipeline within the framework of UN 
resolutions. 
  Stating his views on the Cyprus issue, Cetin said that 
Turkey 
is not under pressure from any country and added that Turkey 
more than anybody wants a solution to the Cyprus issue. Stating 
that this solution should be a realistic and a just solution 
which will not take Cyprus back to pre-1974 conditions, Cetin 
stressed that a solution can be achieved only if the leaders of 
the two communities reach an agreement. Stating that reopening 
the Iraq-Turkey pipeline should not be confused with finding a 
solution to the Cyprus issue, Cetin said these two issues are 
separate and should be regarded as developments independent of 
each other.

<F P=106> [Report on an "exclusive" interview with President Suleyman </F>
Demirel by Ilnur Cevik in Ankara; date not given] 
  [Text] President Suleyman Demirel said Turkey is a country 
where we have freedom. "Despite this, I do not feel people have 
fully understood what that means. In the troubles we have 
experienced in the past and are now experiencing, we see that 
people have difficulty understanding what freedom actually is. 
If there is freedom, then actions which the laws forbid will be 
regarded as crimes and all other actions will be tolerated. [no 
closing quotation marks as published] 
  The president stressed that "if certain circles or people 
decide certain actions which are not regarded as crimes by law 
are actually crimes and if they also decide to penalize these 
actions, then they may land Turkey in deep unrest. We have seen 
in the past people being tried for things which are not actually 
crimes and then they have been acquitted by courts. When this 
is the case, certain people start criticizing the courts. If 
you do not accept the rulings of the courts, if you do not obey 
the laws, if you regard yourself as the court and declare your 
own laws, then the end result will be chaos." 
  Demirel complained about the attitude of the press in Turkey 
and said he had warned several times in the past that the press 
was stepping out of line. "It is very important that the press 
report about events in a free atmosphere, but the press has to 
be aware that there are other democratic institutions which have 
to be respected and that people have to accept their authorities 
and their rulings and should not try to damage them." He seemed 
to be referring to media pressure on the courts, especially the 
Supreme Election Board, which has come under fire for its 
rulings both before and after the elections. 
  Demirel said in the year 1994 the Turkish Republic has two 
major assets. One is the constitutional state based on rules 
and the other is the state institutions that will execute these 
rules. "You can criticize this if these institutions of the 
state do not function properly, but if none of the institutions 
function, then this means the state is paralyzed. I cannot even 
envisage such a thing in Turkey." 
  "Democratic reflex is a must for the state to function 
properly," Demirel said, adding that if a nation does not raise 
its voice when the country is not being run properly, then the 
people deserve such administrators. "How can the people raise 
their voice? They can do this through democratic platforms. We 
have a free press in Turkey. We have a freely elected Parliament 
where 11 parties are being represented. The rally squares and 
the streets are free. No one should panic if the streets and 
the squares of a country are being used for demonstrations 
because I feel the right to demonstrate is one of the most 
sacred rights given to people by democracy." 
  "We have to keep all channels open for people to express 
themselves and seek their rights. One such channel is the right 
to demonstrate. If you deny them such rights, then they will 
feel justified to show resistance." 
<H5>  A Consensus Needed </H5>
  Demirel said Turks have to reach a national consensus on 
whether the republic, democracy, secularism and religion can go 
hand in hand together. 
  "Is democracy an institution which harms the republic? We 
have to differentiate between democracy and the republic because 
you can have a republic and you can have a democratic republic. 
Does secularism harm democracy and the republic? Does 
secularism harm Islam? Is Islam against secularism, democracy 
and the republic? I feel the Turkish people have to reach a 
consensus on all these issues." 
  Demirel said in a country where 99.9 percent of the people 
are Muslims, secularism cannot be considered as atheism and it 
cannot be applied as atheism. He pointed out that secularism is 
the umbrella for freedom of religion and conscience in the 
Turkish Republic. "The word secularism is being misused in 
Turkey. The state is secular but individuals cannot be secular 
as they either believe in God or they do not. The individual 
either worships completely, partially or not at all. This is 
all between the individual and God, and in the Muslim faith what 
is important for a person is to believe that God is one. A 
person will not stop being a Muslim just because she or he does 
not worship. What is sin and what is not is up to God." The 
president stressed that believing in God, praying and following 
God's orders does not mean a person is against secularism. "I 
was the person who told a rally crowd in Sakarya in 1965 (when 
he became prime minister after his Justice Party won a landslide 
in the elections) that everyone should proudly declare they are 
Muslims in Turkey. If a person is saying he is a Muslim with 
pride or if he is calling God's name, there is nothing 
anti-secular about all this. Why should some people regard it 
as an anti-secular act if people pray, go to the mosque, listen 
to prayers or if God's name is chanted? In Britain their 
national anthem says "God save the Queen" and the American 
dollar bears the writing "In God we trust." 
<H5>  Religion and Politics </H5>
  Demirel said the exploitation of religion by politicians is 
nothing new in human history. "The fact that some people try to 
exploit the religious feelings of the people is nothing new for 
the world or for Turkey. You should remember that for the past 
40 years, since we switched to a multi-party system, we have 
been struggling for this in Turkey. I was the one who urged 
everyone not to bring religion into the schools, the mosques or 
the military barracks. I was also the one who urged everyone to 
proudly announce they are Muslims." 
  Demirel said if people want to pray, they should go to the 
mosque. He pointed out that there are 65,000 mosques and 83,000 
Muslim clergy in Turkey who are ready to serve the public. "If 
the imams (Muslim clergy) who preach at mosques try to 
indoctrinate people with daily politics, they will split the 
congregation because daily politics changes overnight while even 
a single comma in God's teachings does not change." Demirel 
said Muslim preachers have to use the teachings of God and 
nothing else. "If you carry the issues being discussed in 
newspapers to the mosque, then you will only divide the people. 
However, Islam rejects division and discord. I want to declare 
clearly that exploiting religion for political gains is discord 
and whoever does this is seriously harming religion." 
<H5>  Secularism and Turkey </H5>
  Demirel said it is impossible for anyone to reject 
secularism 
in Turkey but stressed the conditions in Turkey had changed 
between the early years of the republic and now. "I think the 
application of secularism in the 1930s was a bit mistaken. 
People may have been satisfied with the application of 
secularism at the time. Some people may not have liked this, 
but we have to accept things according to the conditions of 
those times. There were claims that Islam was an obstacle to 
development while secularism was seen as atheism. Those were 
also the times when Marxism was spreading throughout most of the 
world and Marxist ideology regarded religion as the opium of the 
masses. So it is hard to say Turkey could remain far apart from 
the influences of these trends." 
  The president said at first Turkey did not start off as a 
secular state. He pointed out that the first 1924 Constitution 
said the religion of the Turkish Republic is Islam and this was 
dropped in 1928 and until 1937 there was no mention of 
secularism in the constitution. 
  Demirel said when he came to power as prime minister, he 
managed to explain to the people what secularism was. "We 
understood what secularism was and we managed to convey this to 
the people. Secularism is not against Islam. A person who 
fulfills the requirements of Islam should not complain about 
secularism as secularism is not against beliefs, does not 
prevent people from praying and does not obstruct religious 
education. [no closing quotations marks as published] 
  The head of state says debate on religion in Turkey dates 
back to 150 years. "The people running the Ottoman empire 
sought the reasons why we could not progress while we were left 
backward and while we were alienated from the other countries in 
Europe. I support the view that religion is not an obstacle for 
Turkey's development. Secularism does not prevent people from 
fulfilling their religious rights. If a person says he is a 
Muslim, he does not violate secularism. But if people use the 
name of God, the Koran and the name of the Prophet to win 
sympathy from people and to exploit people's feelings for 
personal gains, then they are committing a sin. I say people 
should call God's name only in appropriate places and times. 
When you start doing something, do it in the name of God, call 
God's name whenever you feel like it. That is up to the 
individual. But, when you turn all this into an instrument for 
showing off and when you try to derive some benefits out of all 
this, then you are committing a great sin. We have tried to 
spread these views in Turkey, and we have eased some of the 
tension in the past." 
<H5>  Fundamentalism in Turkey </H5>
  Asked if Turkey would become a fundamentalist state, Demirel 
said that before anything we should understand what 
fundamentalism is. "What do we have to do to transform Turkey 
into a fundamentalist state? First, you have to change the 
Constitution. There is an article which defines the state 
system in Turkey. You have to change that article. You have to 
change the principle in the Constitution that the Turkish 
Republic is a secular, democratic and social state based on 
laws. So you have to take out the word `secular' and insert 
that the Turkish Republic is a state based on religion. That 
would mean you would be going back to 1924 and 1928. Turkey went 
through an evolution and social incidents do not work backwards 
but, on the contrary, they move forwards." 
  Demirel said when people try to turn the Turkish Republic 
into a fundamentalist state, they have to change the laws as 
well as the Constitution. "They have to transform the laws of 
the Turkish Republic according to the teachings of the Koran but 
which teachings?" 
  The president explained that the Koran deals with five 
basic areas. He said the first area is to do with believing in 
God. This covers the belief that God is one and that Hz. 
[Prophet] Muhammad is his prophet. Whoever believes in this is 
a Muslim. 
  Demirel explained that the second area is praying and 
worshiping. This includes praying, fasting, helping the poor and 
the needy and going to Mecca for pilgrimage. If a person does 
not do these things or does them partially, then he or she will 
be committing a sin. "If you beg for forgiveness, God, which is 
merciful, will forgive you. In the teachings of the Koran it 
says you may be committing many sins but one good action may 
wipe away all the sins. You may not be aware that you have done 
a good deed, but God knows and will forgive you for all your 
sins. So it is all between God and the individual." The third 
area is punishment in the world. The Koran does not only define 
the day of judgement but it also defines how people will be 
punished if they violate the rights of others. "If you steal, 
you will be punished. So the Koran also specifies punishments 
for various crimes." 
  The fourth area in the Koran defines "procedures" for 
earthly 
issues. It sets rules for relations between individuals, the 
relationship between men and women, the rules of marriage and 
divorce and alimony as well as inheritance. 
  The fifth area is "morality." It sets the rules of what is 
good and what is bad. It urges people to behave well, not to 
lie, to help one another, not to cheat. "These are all rules of 
morality which no civilized person would reject." 
  "Now let us look at all these five areas and see if 
secularism is an obstacle for any of them. Secularism does not 
prohibit belief in God or the Prophet. Neither does secularism 
obstruct praying and worshipping. Regarding the third and 
fourth areas which the Koran covers on punishment and other 
legal arrangements, we see that in Turkey we have the penal code 
and the civil code. So when you have fundamentalism you will 
annul these laws and replace them with the punishments and other 
legal arrangements specified in the Koran. So if you do not do 
this will that country we regarded as a non-Muslim state? Won't 
they regard Turkey as a Muslim country? We regard a Muslim 
country as a country where the majority of the people are 
believers in Islam. A secular state is a state where secularism 
works like an umbrella over religion and where there is no 
obstructions and repression against religion." 
  Demirel said that for Turkey to become a fundamentalist 
state 
first its proponents have to obtain the powers to be able to 
change the constitution. "But the Turkish people are satisfied 
with secularism because it does not prevent them from praying, 
it does not interfere in their beliefs, it does not say `be a 
bad person and do not obey the teachings of the Koran to be 
honest' and it has adopted the rules of the Koran on punishments 
and legal arrangements according to the requirements of 
contemporary times. All this was done way back in 1926 and no 
one objected to it. In the past 68 years there have been no 
claims that because Turkey changed its laws it committed a crime 
against the Koran and that Turks became non-Muslims." 
<H5>  The Nation Rules </H5>
  Demirel pointed out that the Koran refers to "the rule of 
God" and that some people say, "You cannot talk about national 
will and the rule of the people because there is only the rule 
of God." The president said that this point needed clarifying. 
"We agree that the ultimate right to rule belongs to God. But 
the rule of God is universal, while there is also `partial' 
rule. In Islamic thinking, the right of a nation to rule itself 
is not against the divine orders of God. As a matter of fact, 
both our Prophet and the caliphates that came after him have run 
the state. If a person runs a country according to the divine 
orders of God, he does not violate God's will and the universal 
rule of God. Many times [in] the Koran God tells Muslims to 
`rule a country through justice.' God also says, `Give the 
right to rule to those who are capable.' Here we see that God 
wants the people to be ruled by the people. So, if you hand 
power over to those who are capable of running a country, then 
you are fulfilling God's wishes. So when you say, `Be just and 
give power to those capable of ruling, can this be regarded as 
fundamentalism? No it cannot. Can people claim this exists in 
the Koran and that we are not obeying it? Of course not. If we 
act as God wishes, can people claim we are fundamentalists?" 
  Demirel said that no one in Turkey demands a fundamentalist 
order, "while there are some who want Shari'ah (Islamic law) and 
these people are rather vague about what they really want...." 
Demirel admitted that Turkey had adopted the criminal, civil, 
commerce and inheritance codes of the West, saying that this may 
have been regarded as ignoring the principles of Islam. "Yet no 
one can say such a country is not Muslim. On the contrary, 
Turkey is the leading Islamic country." 
  Demirel said that none of the 55 Islamic countries had ever 
claimed that Turkey was not an Islamic country. The president 
stressed that Turkey today is a country run by liberal policies, 
liberal economic principles, secularism and the law. He 
emphasized that the country had not only preserved its national 
values and its identity, but had also respected universal 
values. He said that Turkey accepted globalism, as well as 
international peace and cooperation. "None of these contradict 
Turkey's Muslim identity. Turkey has to live up to all these 
principles and values." "I have asked a series of questions. I 
asked myself and several other people, how can you set up a 
state based on Islamic principles? Can the Koran and the 
teachings of the Prophet be the principles of a state? Don't 
democracy and secularism fulfill the requirements of the Koran 
and the teachings of the Prophet? What do the Koran and the 
teachings of the Prophet call for? How did Turkey in the past, 
and how do the present 55 Islamic countries try to adapt their 
state systems to the Koran and the teachings of the Prophet? I 
have come to the conclusion that all past and present states 
have tried to adapt the requirements of Islam to the realities 
of their times. Thus the demands of those who call for Islamic 
law and order have never been realized. This is called 
`political Islam.' It is called `political Islam and 
traditionalist law.' Is there anything preventing us from 
practising our faith in the present order in Turkey? Of course 
not." 
  Demirel warned that there were those in Turkey who hurt the 
religious feelings of the people. "Certain people are trying to 
make every action seem as though it were directed against 
secularism. This harms religious feeling, provoking a reaction 
among the people. If you allow people to practice their 
religion they will not seek new avenues. But if you do not, 
then there will be those who claim to be the voice of the 
believers. In 1977 I spoke at rallies and told the people that 
there were people claiming to be their voice. So I asked them, 
`Does anyone prevent you from going to the mosque or attending 
prayers? If you want to recite the Koran, is there anyone who 
tries to prevent you from doing so? If there are such people, I 
will overcome them." 
  Demirel said it is impossible to say that the state system 
in 
Turkey has been set up according to the principles of the Koran. 
Yet, he added that it is also wrong to say Turkey is not a 
Muslim country. 
  "We can say that while in Turkey we have fulfilled three of 
the main principles of Islam which are to believe in God and the 
Prophet, to worship and to promote morality, we have also 
adapted the Koranic rules on punishment and conduct to the 
requirements of our times. For example, the Koran says if a 
person steals something, then you should sever his arm. Yet 
Prophet Omer changed that rule and gave a different punishment 
because he said we need the arm of the man to plough in the 
fields and to fight in wars. In the Koran it says you have to 
kill a person who murders another person. But later the Koran 
also says if the relatives of the murdered person forgives the 
killer, then they get blood money. As you see the Koran is 
always reasonable." 
  Demirel said the people in general are rather uninformed 
about religion and secularism. "Those who defend secularism 
don't know anything about religion, and those who support 
religion don't know anything about secularism." 
  The president said there is no reason why anyone should have 
any doubts that Turkey may become a fundamentalist state. 
"About 72 percent of our population is under the age of 35, and 
it is very hard to steer these people this way or that way. 
These people have tasted what a secular republic is and what 
democracy is. These people have not lost their religion. 
Religion is there and so is secularism. So there is no reason 
for anyone to fear that Turkey may become another Algeria." 
  Demirel said a majority of the nation is happy with 
secularism while he said there are also those who are not. 
"This is nothing new. These people have been complaining about 
secularism for the past century. The debate on this subject has 
been going on since Turkey became a secular country. In the 
Ottoman era there were those who were saying religion is an 
obstacle for development. Among the Republican intellectuals 
there are those who do not know about religious principles and 
who regard secularism as unlimited freedom. I have studied all 
these at length, and I concluded that secularism does not mean 
atheism. In Turkey, religion belongs to the people and the 
individuals. I say give the people the freedom to believe in 
God." 
  Asked if the model in Turkey could also help the West 
overcome the fears of spread of fundamentalism in the world, the 
president said, "Absolutely. Fundamentalism is being debated 
throughout the world. Some people call it, `the revenge of 
God.'" Actually secularism is not our invention. It has come 
about in Europe because of the struggle between the church and 
the state. Demirel pointed out that unlike the church the 
Muslim faith is not organized. "Only the Shiites are organized. 
We do not have that. Our Prophet told his people that he is 
only charged with giving God's messages to the people. God says 
the Prophet is his envoy to present the message. God says the 
Prophet will give the message and then it is up to the believers 
whether or not they will obey. If they do not obey, then it is 
a matter between God and the individual. So it is meaningless 
if individuals oppose secularism under these conditions. So if 
a man says he is a believer, we should tell him to worship God 
but also ask him not to interfere in the lifestyle of others. 
The Koran says: `Nothing will be done under pressure in the 
Muslim faith.'"

<F P=106> [Report by Ismet G. Imset] </F>
  [Text] Ankara--A division has struck the Turkish media on 
how to treat the pro-Islamic Welfare Party (RP) and whether to 
allow its supporters to freely express their views on television 
and in the press. 
  Many journalists and commentators who claim to be 
secularists 
have launched a campaign to suppress reporting on the RP and to 
block Islamic activists from expressing their opinions in their 
newspapers and on their programs. 
  Those who argue that the RP, as a political party, has the 
right to express itself and that it is the duty of journalists 
to insure impartial reporting are rapidly becoming a minority in 
Turkey's confused, state-subsidized yet bankrupt and ignorant 
press world. 
  Meanwhile, fear is growing among the more responsible and 
objective newsmen that the concerted reaction against the RP 
could strengthen the radical Islamists within this party and 
weaken the stance of the currently-dominant reformists and 
moderates. 
  Concern has increased over the past week that attempts at 
pulling the Welfare into the system and make it part of the 
establishment rather than being against it may fail in the view 
of a systematic attack on this party. 
  Reports from within the RP are that the media's reaction to 
this party which is influencing mainly urban-based masses is 
leading increasingly to a frustration which radical groups are 
skillfully exploiting. 
  The first disagreements on this issue have surfaced since 
Tuesday [26 April] with SABAH columnist Mehmet Ali Birand on 
Monday night interviewing the Welfare Party's (RP) acting group 
chairman, Sevket Kazan, on television. 
  Kazan, who lashed out at the media for blasting at his 
party, 
disclosed during Birand's popular 32nd Day program that certain 
circles identifying themselves as "secularists" were sending 
threatening letters both to his party and to other individuals. 
The politician also showed some of the letters bearing pictures 
of modern and secular Turkey's founder Mustafa Kemal Ataturk and 
promising on behalf of the "secularists" to "fight to the last 
drop of our blood." 
  "They are the ones who have declared war on us," Kazan 
complained, referring to criticism of RP Chairman Necmettin 
Erbakan's earlier remarks that the Welfare would come to power 
and "60 million will decide on whether this transition will be a 
peaceful one or a bloody one." 
  This remark, scissored out of a lengthy speech Erbakan made 
to his party's Parliament group, was a reference to threats 
targeting the party, Kazan explained. 
  As Birand rightfully expressed on Wednesday, the Welfare 
Party phenomena has become a test for democracy in Turkey both 
for this party and the country altogether. 
  But for allowing Kazan to speak in his program and for 
letting an Islamic activist woman argue her views, Birand has 
fallen under attack, like several other of his colleagues in the 
Turkish press, for giving the Welfare the opportunity to 
propagate. 
  In clear defiance of the Press Code of Professional Ethics 
which has been approved of by all major newspapers, Birand has 
been blasted by his own colleagues over the past two days. On 
Tuesday, respected and widely popular columnist Hincal Uluc, who 
writes on the same page as Birand, lashed out at the latter for 
allowing "Shariah (Islamic order) supporters" to appear on 
television one after another and stressed that "Shariah and 
democracy are two separate things which cannot go together." 
  "Now tell me Mehmet Ali," he asked. "Why should such an easy 
propaganda opportunity be given on the country's most widely 
watched television channel to people who can freely establish 
their own radios, television, newspapers and magazines?" 
Birand's staunch rival Emin Colasan of HURRIYET, a journalist 
who often expresses the views of Turkey's hard-liners in his 
column and who recently boasted of being a "Mehmetchik (soldier) 
journalist," joined in the criticism the following day. Quoting 
Uluc in his own column titled something like "make a good profit 
Mehmet Ali" and using idioms to belittle Birand's program staff, 
Colasan said this journalist had done wrong by allowing Muslim 
politicians to appear on the television and for failing to give 
Kazan a hard time. 
  Earlier, Colasan had referred to Birand as among the 
"ignorant, sold out" circles with bad intentions. "They are 
spoiling and pumping up the Refah and Shariah supporters," he 
said in a similar accusative commentary on Friday. 
  It is evident by now that a concerted campaign is underway 
to 
tackle with the Refah victory and everyone who gives them the 
opportunity to express their views, including objective 
journalists, are being accused of anything short of treason. 
"What kind of democratic mentality is this?" asked one 
columnist during the week. "You will allow a party you like to 
be elected, but when a party you dislike is elected, you say 
this cannot be." 
  Reaction to Welfare throughout Turkey's larger cities 
appears 
also to be serving the government and other power circles in 
this secular country. Secular reaction, gradually taking the 
form of an anti-Islamic trend, is clearly boosting public 
support to the military in a time Turkey is advancing towards a 
new economic and political crisis. 
  On Wednesday, HURRIYET reported that the Office of the Chief 
of Staff had ordered all officers and petty officers to wear 
badges of Ataturk symbolizing their belief in his principals. 
Last week, Prime Minister Tansu Ciller reportedly told U.S. 
President Bill Clinton in Washington that if her economic 
package or government failed, the Welfare would be coming to 
Turkey. 
  The concerted effort turning the spotlights on the Welfare 
Party is clearly serving both government and military circles in 
Turkey for now. But the threat is that it is increasingly 
forcing the Welfare to move out of the system, isolating its 
reformist and moderate elements and increasing the weight of 
radical activists within the party. 
  Some observers believe the policy adopted towards Refah is 
now similar to that launched against the pro-Kurdish Democracy 
Party (DEP) earlier this year, aimed perhaps at pushing this 
party out of the system as well and forcing it into a 
radicalization.

<F P=106> [Article by Rene Haquin: "Rwanda: Nonassistance During </F>
Massacre?"] 
  [Excerpts] Some serious questions are being asked while 
reactions increase following the "open letter to our leaders" 
from the "Mortier platoon" of Flawinne, to which the 10 blue 
helmets massacred in Kigali belonged. The comrades in arms and 
the families of the victims are accusing the command of 
"nonassistance to persons in danger and a lack of team spirit" 
and are casting doubt on "the competence of certain officers." 
  On Tuesday [26 April], General Charlier replied that "no 
element gives reason to believe that the command failed." 
[passage omitted] 
  Did not the Rwandan Prime Minister's escort come under the 
UN 
mandate? The CGSP [General Directorate for Public Services] 
military union asks whether this mandate "explicitly" excluded 
the use of force except in cases of legitimate defense and 
whether the Belgian Government accepted this without reservation. 
  Who gave the order to hand over the weapons? Why were they 
not assisted? The CGSP asks who made such decisions: The UN 
civil or military authorities, Belgian politicians in Brussels 
or at the embassy in Kigali, the Chief of Staff in Belgium or 
the Belgian command in Kigali? [passage omitted] 
  Defense Minister Leo Delcroix has stated that the initial 
findings of the UN enquiry should be known by mid-May, but that 
on the basis of the first elements, there was "no failing of 
responsibility at the command level, Lieutenant Lotin and the 
UNAMIR [UN Mission in Rwanda] command acted correctly." Leo 
Delcroix is of the opinion that any armed intervention should 
"take into count the threat which would have been posed to the 
two other groups of blue helmets who were also surrounded." (15 
at the airport and seven in another area -- editor's note).

  [Excerpts] In Rwanda, the intermittent bombing of Kigali 
continues. [passage omitted]. However, the government formed 
after the death of President Habyarimana is pursuing its 
diplomatic offensive in Africa and in Europe. The Rwandan 
foreign minister has been in Paris since last Monday [25 April]. 
Jerome Bicamumpaka was received at the Elysee, at the Matignon 
[prime minister's office], and at the Foreign Ministry. The 
next leg of Jerome Bicamumpaka's visit was to be Belgium, but it 
will probably not take place, Monique Mas says: 
  [Mas] No, Brussels does not wish to receive Jerome 
Bicamumpaka. The Belgian Foreign Ministry has even stressed that 
the visa he demanded was refused. Belgium has not severed its 
diplomatic relations with Rwanda and it is thus continuing to 
deal with the Rwandan ambassador in Brussels. It is difficult, 
however, for Belgium to receive the representative of a 
government which it has accused of involvement in the attack on 
the presidential plane and a government which put all the 
responsibility for the bloodbath on the Rwandan civilian 
opposition and the FPR [Rwandan Patriotic Front], and above all 
on the United Nations and, especially, the Belgian blue helmets.

<F P=106> [Unattributed report: "`If the Italian Social Movement </F>
Participates in Italy's New Government, European Union 
Regulations Will Not Allow Boycotting Neofascist Ministers,' 
Paris says"] 
  [Text] The Matignon [prime minister's office] has not yet 
prepared an official policy with regard to the participation of 
neofascists in a government of a European Union [EU] member 
state. [Prime Minister] Edouard Balladur has apparently issued 
no specific guidelines for his ministers to follow in European 
councils. In prime ministerial circles, comments are heard -- 
although these are only preliminary thoughts, not decisions -- 
that the French Government's attitude will vary depending on the 
positions adopted by those Italian ministers who happen to be 
MSI [Italian Social Movement] members. If they advocate 
neofascist positions, France should fight them, we are told, but 
otherwise, EU rules include no provision for boycotting a 
democratically elected government. 
  Although [former Socialist Culture Minister] Jack Lang 
championed a boycott before the national convention of the 
Socialist Party on 17 April, the party's leadership argued that 
this position lacked realism. [Socialist Party Secretary 
General] Michel Rocard felt the need to issue a press release 
stating that the presence of neofascist ministers, should it be 
confirmed, would be "a serious cause for concern." "The very 
notion is unacceptable," he added. "Fifty years after World War 
II, it is not possible to forget what became of Europe under 
fascism and Nazism." The Socialist Party decided to start talks 
with other European socialist and social democratic parties 
"with a view to adopting a common position in European 
institutions, especially at the European Parliament." 
  Charles Millon, president of the UDF [French Democratic 
Union] group in the National Assembly, also mentioned the 
prospect of an Italian government including neofascist 
ministers. On 24 April on Radio J [private station], he said he 
wished "that EU members would make it very clear to the 
president of the Italian Republic that the government he is to 
call to office (must be) devoted to the values of the European 
civilization, that is, respect for human rights, for the 
individual, and for democratic principles." 
  Mr. Millon added that should the values "still be fascist 
values, which do not square with European philosophy (...), 
there will be a major problem." "The EU is like wedlock; to be 
married, the partners should have common social and political 
views," he concluded. He has been so far the only UDF member to 
take a stand on the issue. 
  At the RPR [Rally for the Republic], people close to 
[National Assembly President] Philippe Seguin noted that Jacques 
Chirac has had telephone conversations with Gianfranco Fini, the 
former MSI national secretary and the founder of the National 
Alliance; that Isere Deputy Richard Cazenave has attended the 
founding conference of Mr. Fini's new party; and that [Interior 
Minister] Charles Pasqua has said that he maintains a close 
relationship with [Forza Italia leader] Silvio Berlusconi. 
However, Mr. Seguin has never been shy of admitting that in his 
eyes, "the only noteworthy party in Italy is the PDS" 
(Democratic Party of the Left, the former Communist Party). And 
neither has he tried to hide his affinity with Giorgio 
Napolitano (PDS), the former speaker of the Italian House of 
Representatives, who has now been replaced by Irene Pivetti 
(Northern League).

  [Text] Renamo [Mozambique National Resistance] leader 
Afonso Dhlakama left Portugal about an hour ago. Before 
leaving, he expressed his confidence in the role of Portuguese 
investors in Mozambique. He described the investment as 
essential to peace. Despite being pleased, Dhlakama criticized 
the Portuguese Government once more. He said the government 
should have acted sooner, and that would have prevented death 
and destruction in Mozambique. 
  [Begin Dhlakama recording] I have always criticized some of 
the Portuguese Government's attitudes. This time I told PUBLICO 
that things have changed and that is why many people died in my 
country. I have said before that if the Portuguese Government 
had understood five years ago that it was necessary for the 
sides to negotiate, it would have pressured the regime, the 
Frelimo [Mozambique Liberation Front] government, and perhaps 
only a few people would have died, and perhaps what happened -- 
the destruction -- could have been prevented. I blame the 
Portuguese Government for this. [end recording]

  [Excerpts] At noon today, Joe Clark, the UN secretary 
general's special representative in Cyprus, said that no 
agreement has been reached on the confidence-building measures 
and that there is no reason for further talks with the two 
sides, at least today. He said: After my meeting today with 
Turkish Cypriot leader Rauf Denktas, I do not think there is any 
reason for me to hold any more talks. 
  In a statement at the Ledra Palace checkpoint, Clark said 
that before making any suggestions, he wants to think about what 
he discussed here and in his meetings with Greek and Turkish 
representatives. Asked if he suggested any changes to the 21 
March UN document, Clark said: I only dealt with one 
suggestion. We always had just one package, nothing more, and 
the issue was how to implement it. I asked that we deal with it 
imaginatively. We have worked on it but reached no agreement. 
  Clark and Gustave Feissel, the UN secretary general's 
alternate special representative in Cyprus, will brief the 
ambassadors of the five UN Security Council permanent members on 
their meetings in Nicosia and Ankara. The meeting will be held 
at 1800 today at the British High Commission. Clark will leave 
Cyprus at 0800 tomorrow. [passage omitted] 
  In answer to a question, government spokesman Ioannis 
Kasoulidhis said it seems that the new UN effort has reached a 
deadlock. He said that our side is now waiting for the UN 
secretary general to submit his report, which would recount the 
events and should attribute responsibilities where they exist. 
Asked whether Clark will have a new meeting with the president, 
Kasoulidhis said the UN envoy wished the president Happy Easter 
and bade him farewell. He added that if anything comes up, the 
president will never refuse to meet with Clark. 
  After meeting Kliridhis, Clark said he had a lengthy meeting 
with the president, adding that there is no reason for further 
comment in view of the new meeting with Denktas.

  [Text] Consultations on Skopje [The Former Yugoslav 
Republic of Yugoslavia--FYROM] continued today at the top level 
in UN Headquarters, where Prime Minister Andreas Papandreou met 
with the UN secretary general. Our New York special 
correspondent Roula Kambouryianni reports. 
  [Begin recording] [Kambouryianni] No specific positive 
developments can be discerned on the Skopje issue. However, UN 
Secretary General Butrus Butrus-Ghali did not ask for Security 
Council intervention, and the mediation effort by Cyrus Vance is 
continuing. This is what Prime Minister Andreas Papandreou said 
after his 40-minute meeting with Butrus-Ghali in the presence of 
Foreign Minister Karolos Papoulias and Mr. Cyrus Vance. Before 
the meeting, Mr. Butrus-Ghali held consultations both with Mr. 
Vance and with Matthew Nimetz, State Department special 
coordinator on the Skopje issue. 
  In addition to the Skopje question, the Cyprus and Bosnian 
issues were also discussed. As the prime minister said, however, 
we did not touch on matters of substance. After the failure of 
the talks on the confidence-building measures, the Greek side 
expressed its regret for the deadlock in the Cyprus issue 
because of the Turkish intransigence. 
  [Papandreou] We expressed our regret for the course of the 
Cyprus issue. There have already been 20 years of occupation, 
and the process should change so that we end with a solution 
acceptable to the people of Cyprus, a solution that will be just 
and lasting. 
  [Kambouryianni] Responding to a Turkish correspondent's 
question on relations with Turkey, the prime minister said that 
we hope they will improve, and we are doing all we can in this 
direction. 
  Coming out of UN Headquarters, Mr. Vance described the 
meeting as very positive. He said: We have cooperated with Mr. 
Papandreou in the past; let us hope that progress will be made 
soon. The prime minister and members of the Greek delegation 
will leave for Athens today. [end recording]
