<H5>  1. Introduction </H5>
  If you were driving in your car and got caught in a traffic 
jam, you would not know whether there was a detour route 
available. If that detour could get you to your destination 
faster, you would not hesitate in taking it. 
  Furthermore, if you always knew when there was an available 
parking lot nearby where you could park your car, you would not 
have to worry so much about fighting for parking places, and not 
have to be pay for expensive parking tickets. 
  The basic functions of a car is not only the driving part 
but 
also getting to your destination safely, reliably, and quickly, 
so the route that you take has important implications. Avoiding 
illegal stops along the highway also has direct links to keeping 
traffic volumes down on the roads. 
  The Vehicle Information and Communication System 
(hereinafter 
VICS) is a system that provides this type of essential 
information to the driver and assists the driver in 
decision-making. 
<H5>  2. Purpose and Benefits of VICS </H5>
<H5>  2.1 Background of VICS Research </H5>
  The automobile is preferred by people for its convenience, 
so 
this means that the demands on the roads will steadily grow. 
  The roads receiving this traffic are supposedly being 
widened 
and improved, but it will not be long before we reach the base 
of this demand, resulting in severe congestion and calling into 
question the basic role of the automobile. 
  There is also a serious concern about the rising number of 
traffic deaths over the past few years that could be reduced by 
having more driving safety programs and more traffic safety 
equipment. 
  The Vehicle Information and Communication System (VICS) is a 
system that provides people with information they need when 
driving. That information is used to keep traffic flows moving 
in the right direction, and not the least, to make driving 
smoother and safer. 
<H5>  2.2 Aim of VICS </H5>
  This system offers drivers information on the time certain 
basic things take when traveling. 
  These for the most part include information such as whether 
a 
road is open or not due to accidents or construction, the origin 
and destination of a trip, degree of traffic congestion, and 
also travel time on each road. 
  A driver in his car gets this information, and using his 
judgment, selects the fastest route available to get him to his 
destination. The use of this system will bring about a 
redistribution of traffic. 
  For quite some time, the over-concentration of traffic has 
accelerated the reduction in the ability of the roads to handle 
this traffic capacity, a phenomena that has come to be known as 
a traffic jam. On the other hand, however, there is a growing 
recognition that a redistribution of traffic will quickly 
restore the ability of the roads to handle this traffic, and 
ease or get rid of these traffic jams. 
  In other words, drivers seeking more convenient routes that 
give them a faster alternative to their destination will help 
make better use of the road networks, and will, secondly, help 
ease or eliminate traffic congestion. 
  Furthermore, the easing and reduction of traffic congestion 
decreases driver irritability and frustration because the 
driving time is shorter and the arrival time is known. Putting 
drivers more at ease also helps prevent auto accidents due to 
driver carelessness. In Figure 1, we show the benefits of the 
system. 

<FIG ID=JPRS-JST-014L-08A>      Figure 1. VICS Benefits </FIG>

  The opposite is often the case. For example, parked cars 
along the road which are there tending to their own immediate 
needs have a negative effect in that they dramatically reduce 
the ability of the roads to handle traffic. 
  The VICS system seems too good to be true in that trying to 
accommodate the needs of the individual in turn benefits society. 
<H5>  2.3 Infrastructure Enables Japan To Take World Lead </H5>
  In addition to the social aspect, the infrastructure already 
exists in Japan to erect such a system easily. 
  The first part of this is that the information the system 
requires has already been collected for administrative purposes 
and is available for use. A big advantage that we have over 
other countries is that traffic information is systematically 
gathered by a public safety commission and traffic authorities 
(Table 1). 
  Table 1. VICS Information (In Planning) 
  1. Road and Traffic Information 


    -  Traveling time (areas, times, etc.) 
  -  Traffic congestion 
(areas, times, etc.) 
  -  Accidents (locations, causes, etc.) 
  -  Traffic laws (areas, particulars, etc.) 
  -  Other information 

    2. Road and Traffic Related Information 


    -  Parking sites (locations, availability, etc.) 
  -  Other 
information [end table] 

    The second area that we already have in place here in Japan 
is that research has been almost completed on another system 
that was used to confirm the technical feasibility of this 
system. 
  The third factor is the sophistication of the on-board 
equipment used in automobiles and the progress being made in 
building cars with more advanced features. Car navigation 
systems, in particular, have shown remarkable growth since 
manufacturers started coming out with these systems after the 
Japan Digital Road Map Association began offering digital road 
maps. There are now more than 300,000 car navigation systems in 
use today (Figure 2). 

<FIG ID=JPRS-JST-014L-09A>      Figure 2. Car Navigation Systems </FIG>

<H5>  3. VICS Promotional Activities and Research Organizations </H5>
<H5>  3.1 VICS Promotional Activities </H5>
  In introducing a new traffic information system for moving 
vehicles, the National Police Agency (NPA), the Ministry of 
Posts and Telecommunication (MPT), and the Ministry of 
Construction (MC), recognizing the need to synthesize those 
traffic information systems in which companies have been doing 
R&amp;D in order to achieve safer and smoother traffic flow, 
came up 
with a single system called the Vehicle Information and 
Communication System, and in March 1990 set up the VICS Liaison 
Committee. 
  Later, in December of that year, a group of companies united 
to form a VICS company and business center, but before putting 
it into operation, quickly established the VICS Promotional 
Council with cooperation from the above named ministries and 
agencies. 
  In October 1991, the Vehicle Information and Communication 
System (VICS) was established with over 200 participating 
corporations and groups, with most new VICS members joining by 
prearrangement from the break-up of the AMTICS Promotion Council 
and the RACS Promotion Council (Table 2). 
  Details Surrounding Formation of VICS Promotion 
Council 


    -  March 1990: VICS Promotion Council started by National 
Police Agency, Ministry of Posts and Telecommunications, and 
Ministry of Construction 
  -  December 1990: Interim report released 
by VICS Liaison Committee 

    (1) Three ministries/agencies work jointly toward 
realization 
of VICS 
  (2) VICS Promotion Council formed by private corporations as 
preliminary organization to VICS company 


    -  September 1991: VICS Promotion Council meeting 
convened 

    Council Promoter: Koichiro Toyoda, president, Toyota Motor 
Corp. (chairman at that time) 


    -  October 1991: Establishment of VICS Promotion Council 

    Goal: Quickly put Vehicle Information and Communication 
System (VICS) into operation, and expedite business side. 
  Chairman: Hiroshi Inose, director, Gakujitsu Joho Center 
  Members: Oki Electric, Sumitomo Denko, Toyota, Nissan, NEC, 
Hitachi, Matsushita Electric works and 207 other corporations 
and organizations 
  Thus, VICS was added to the list of traffic information 
system projects being carried out around the world as shown in 
Figure 3. The aim of the projects is the implementation of such 
systems. 

<FIG ID=JPRS-JST-014L-10A>      Figure 3. Vehicle Communication System Related Projects Around the World </FIG>

<H5>  3.2 VICS Research Organizations </H5>
  In studying how to implement VICS, we organized a study 
group 
to look at each of the items that needed to be researched, and 
brought these items up in a committee format. 
  The study group was divided into three committees, and these 
were further divided into subcommittees in order to deal more 
effectively with both specialized and comprehensive studies. 
  First, there is the "business committee." This committee is 
made up of a "systems subcommittee" which is studying the 
implementation of VICS and what needs to be done with regard to 
commercializing VICS as well as the business side including 
income and expenses, a "safety subcommittee" which is doing 
studies to make sure that VICS information does not present 
problems in terms of safe driving and yet is marketable, and a 
"database subcommittee" whose aim it is to satisfy the needs of 
the user. The job of the safety subcommittee is to absolutely 
avoid the side effects that take place when VICS is used as a 
specific remedy to make traffic flow safer and smoother. This is 
an important item that supports the implementation of VICS from 
the side. 
  The "research committee" is divided into a "beacon 
subcommittee," an "FM multiplier subcommittee," and a 
"teleterminal subcommittee" that have been formed to look into 
each of the media which VICS uses, how the media should actually 
be used, and the compatibility with VICS. 
  A proposal was also received from the National Police Agency 
on whether an optical vehicle sensing device that they planned 
to implement, and which also has a two-way communication 
feature, could be used in the VICS system as a light beacon, so 
in April 1993, a "light beacon subcommittee" was formed. 
  The "testing committee" is made up of a "demonstration and 
testing subcommittee" which was formed in the fall of 1992. This 
subcommittee is in the process of speeding up preparations to 
demonstrate and test the system in order to gain a better 
understanding of the effectiveness and necessity of the system. 
<H5>  4. VICS Outlined </H5>
<H5>  4.1 Designing a User-Oriented Product </H5>
  We believed that the first conditions that VICS must meet 
are 
availability, ease of use, and cheap enough for users to afford 
because this product has yet to demonstrate its usefulness in 
the world. 
  The VICS system is made up of four different systems 
according to function, namely, an information gathering system, 
a data processing and editing system, an information 
broadcasting system, and an information utilization system (cf. 
Figure 4). 

<FIG ID=JPRS-JST-014L-10B>      Figure 4. System Overview of VICS </FIG>

  In studying each of these systems, the first things we 
considered was whether to use something that was already 
available on the market as basic infrastructure, or whether to 
share infrastructure as needed in the future, and secondly, to 
make sure that the user could bear the overall cost burden. 
  Next, we emphasized the real time properties of data from 
the 
view of being useful to the driver, and set an upper limit of 
five minutes on the time it takes for data to be sent from an 
information source to the on-board navigation equipment. As 
policy, we tried to avoid having the system equipment be too 
unnecessarily complex, and looked at ways of configuring the 
systems so that data was received and stored efficiently and the 
information mainly used as links (segments of numbered roads). 
This also helped compress the overall volume of information, 
thereby making more information available with the same amount 
of data transmitted, and moving the system one step closer to 
the goal of "anytime, anyplace." 
  The third thing that we considered was one-source processing 
and information broadcasting. One area that the user is 
completely unaware is that the different broadcasting sources 
and broadcasting media differ according to the contents of the 
data and the road type the car is traveling. For that reason, we 
made it conditional that VICS cover the information sources 
needed by drivers, and that the information be processed and 
broadcast by a single source as traffic information or 
traffic-related information. 
  In order to promote widespread use of VICS, the data 
processing and broadcasting system were looked at in terms of 
how it could be designed to meet the needs of the user (Table 3). 
  Basic Requirements of VICS 
  1. Efficient infrastructure 
  (1) Use existing infrastructure 
  (2) Share new infrastructure 
  2. Real time information 
  (1) Time performance of system 
  (2) Usefulness of information 
  3. Single-source processing and broadcasting of information 
  (1) Cover necessary information sources 
  (2) Consolidate management configuration 
  4. Ensure product diversity 
  (1) Utilize media characteristics 
  (2) Broadcast configurations compatible with use 
<H5>  4.2 Using Government Collected Data </H5>
  Various public safety commissions and traffic authorities 
are 
collecting for administrative purposes assorted traffic 
information on things such as traffic accidents and traffic 
jams, and VICS is being given this information through the Japan 
Road Traffic Information Center which is a joint government 
organization run by the National Police Agency and the Ministry 
of Construction. For example, there are 74 traffic control 
centers set up in cities throughout Japan. That means that 
traffic signals are now generally controlled according to 
traffic information collected by vehicle sensing devices. A 
portion of this information is given as ordinary traffic 
information through traffic information display boards, or 
through radio or television, but behind that, there exists an 
enormous amount of stored information. 
  This is how a basic data collection system has been built in 
Japan, but before VICS can be put on the market, there needs to 
be more study done including standardizing the definitions and 
units of measurements that differ slightly between each traffic 
authority. 
  In addition to that, we also have to find a way to collect 
other traffic-related information such as relates to parking in 
an effective and systematic way. 
<H5>  4.3 Center System and Database </H5>
  The VICS Center will be the central place that processes and 
edits the data to make it easier for drivers to make effective 
use of the data in terms of "anytime and anyplace." 
  The basic aim of the VICS Center is to receive and 
efficiently store data as information which VICS can use to 
bridge links, but to do that, the center's systems must have 
databases combining link management configurations for each 
information source so that all the information forms a network. 
In specific terms, an information source will make no difference 
to a driver wanting to use a high-speed route to his destination 
if he cannot get through on either the high-speed route or 
regular routes. 
  This is particularly true in terms of travel information. 
VICS is not a road network made up of units of distance, but 
ideally is a network made up of units of time, and this time 
reflects the traffic conditions occurring at those times in real 
time. 
  For the user, the most practical piece of usable information 
is the "fastest route" to one's destination, which is displayed 
on the on-board navigation equipment in the car. 
  This is simply because the traffic congestion problems 
mentioned in the opening section would not get too far out of 
hand if drivers had indications of such congestion. 
  Furthermore, in considering the use of on-board navigation 
equipment, it is essential that the links used in navigation 
system databases now on the market be compatible, and that the 
equipment be built so that it can withstand new links being 
added in the future corresponding to roads in which traffic 
authorities have gathered data, or to the expansion of those 
roads. We also have to devise some way of guaranteeing continued 
use of existing systems now being used in vehicles. A study of 
VICS links in support of VICS databases is being done with this 
very point in mind (cf. Figure 5). 

<FIG ID=JPRS-JST-014L-11A>      Figure 5. Link Conversion Configuration </FIG>

  The compatibility between VICS links and other individual 
on-board map database links will hopefully be resolved by a 
digital road map database bridge being offered by the Japan 
Digital Road Map Association. 
  In coming up with the on-board map display, consideration 
was 
given not only to displaying information based on links, but 
also to direct use of data and to having relatively inexpensive 
"simple graphics display" or "character display" for data 
processing or editing. 
<H5>  4.4 VICS Media Promoting Product Diversity </H5>
  (1) FM Multiplier Broadcasting 
  In order to achieve the goal "anyplace/anytime," we must not 
only widen the areas being served but we must be able to 
transmit large volumes of data instantly covering all types of 
information (cf. Figure 6). The media best suited to do this is 
FM multiplier broadcasts. So this past May, the Electricity 
Utility Industrial Council issued the technical standards for 
characters, graphics, and data for a mobile vehicle, but VICS 
also contributed to this study. 

<FIG ID=JPRS-JST-014L-12A>      Figure 6. Example of FM Multiplier Transmission Format </FIG>

  The unique feature of FM multiplier broadcasts is that it is 
cheaper and covers a wider service area than can be obtained 
with the existing broadcasting equipment being used. The degree 
to which cost can be lowered, however, is based to a certain 
degree on the advances and technical progress made in the 
processing functions of on-board equipment, and on the way that 
information is selected from the large volume of data received, 
which has tended to place quite a load on the on-board equipment. 
  For example, the map display selects information 
automatically by displaying the place where one's car is 
located, but judging by the current cost of equipment, it would 
take quite a long time before any social benefit was born out of 
that. 
  That is why an FM multiplier system has an area code added 
to 
the information being broadcast. If the on-board equipment is 
provided with some sort of auto-positioning detection feature, 
it will enable data to be filtered out automatically. 
<H5>  (2) Beacon </H5>
  Beacons provide users in the middle with data by filtering 
out that data which is unnecessary, and by doing so they lighten 
the load on the on-board equipment. The biggest feature of a 
beacon system, which receives data on the road intermittently, 
has to do with the location where the car receives data. 
Accordingly, if only filtered information is received from 
beacons at the spot where it is received, the on-board equipment 
will basically only have to display that information which it 
receives. 
  This information could include nearby parking lots, or the 
driving time required from there to certain main points. In 
addition to traffic information, we are also considering beacons 
offering road information such as places that make the present 
location obvious, place names, shapes of traffic intersections, 
and destinations. 
  Beacons will also be able to form service areas out of the 
places where traffic information is needed. 
  Studies are now being done on using both semi-microwave and 
infrared radiation as an information medium of this beacon 
system. 
<H5>  (3) Teleterminals </H5>
  As far as what is in store for information broadcasting in 
the future, thought is being given to individual driver requests. 
  Teleterminals are the media best suited to achieve this with 
VICS. 
  Teleterminals themselves have already been put to commercial 
use, and being very similar in construction to a portable 
cellular telephone, are effective two-way data communication 
devices. A broadcasting-type teleterminal is the kind used in 
traffic communication systems. The teleterminal was fully tested 
in the AMTICS pilot experiment, and in practical experiments 
conducted during the Osaka Flower and Garden Show. 
  In order to have a request-based VICS information 
broadcasting system, we must first take a hard look at the needs 
that exist, and then study information access methods that 
specialize in requests made by drivers, and the databases that 
correspond to those methods (Table 4). 



  ----------------------------------------------------------------------------- 
|Table 4. Characteristics of VICS Media                                     | 
----------------------------------------------------------------------------- 
|                  |Beacon            |FM Multiplier     |Teleterminal      |

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

----------------------------------------------------------------------------- 


  The teleterminal is thought to exhibit great utility when 
equipped with audio recognition as a standard feature, but 
studies have shown it not to be inefficient in its present stage 
of development, so we decided to do a study to see what was 
missing after setting it up to offer simple directions. 
<H5>  4.5 ...Good Products Amid the Competition </H5>
  The last are the on-board systems that utilize information. 
We believe that the fierce competition between major 
manufacturers has provided us with an inexpensive good-quality 
product without it ever having been manufactured or sold. 
  A manufacturing company bases its decisions on whether a 
market is tilting toward the high end with an emphasis on 
features and performance, or whether it is tilting toward a 
large market by having simpler features and lower prices, or it 
bases its decisions on which media or product type to target 
given the competition. 
  For that reason, the aim with regard to VICS is to disclose 
which type of information can be broadcast using what type of 
format. By doing these types of study in a committee format, we 
are hoping to come up with on-board equipment that reflects the 
needs of the user and can be put into operation. 
<H5>  5. Commercializing VICS </H5>
<H5>  5.1 VICS Cost and Efficiency </H5>
  When we looked at what it would take to develop an efficient 
VICS broadcasting system throughout the country, we found that a 
centralized system would be cheaper than a decentralized system 
having centers in each of the prefectures. 
  To be more realistic, however, it would seem to be better to 
have several centralized blocks throughout the country because 
we have to make sure we have a back-up system in case of 
emergencies. 
  In a typical case such as this, the working expenses needed 
over a 10-year time period are estimated to be &yen;390 million 
with the largest portion of that amount, &yen;300 million, going 
toward plant and equipment costs (&yen;288 million for 
information broadcasting equipment, and &yen;12 million for 
center equipment), and &yen;90 million going toward management 
and operating expenses (&yen;26 million for items associated 
with center). 
  When a market survey was done to estimate how far-reaching 
the use of on-board equipment will become, the results indicated 
more than 18 million units in operation within 10 years. 
  If we include the &yen;500,000 in expenses for existing 
navigational equipment and radios as additional on-board 
equipment, that total rises to &yen;820 million. 
  When we calculate the benefit to society of implementing 
VICS 
on this basis, we find that the time saved by shortening driving 
time and the reduced fuel consumption that results produces a 
savings of roughly &yen;5 trillion. 
  Accordingly, the cost of operating VICS over a 10-year 
period 
is estimated at roughly &yen;1.2 trillion, but it has a &yen;5 
trillion return benefit. 
  When we consider the combined use of both a radio beacon 
system in which traffic authorities build the information 
broadcast infrastructure and an optical vehicle sensing system 
installed by the safety commission, and also consider the 
on-board equipment costs excluding those costs absorbed by the 
user, we find that VICS will cost an additional &yen;38 million, 
but that the benefit to society will actually be more than 100 
times greater at roughly &yen;5 trillion. 
<H5>  5.2 VICS Beneficiary </H5>
  The dilemma that VICS finds itself in is that although the 
benefits outweigh the financial risks, the system cannot be 
installed and put into immediate service. 
  In studies undertaken earlier, it was found that it was too 
much of a burden for a VICS business unit to have an 
infrastructure for providing information, and that such a 
company could not be formed into a business. Accordingly, after 
an infrastructure of sorts has been built, the business side of 
VICS will have to be set up jointly. 
  The most important thing is how to obtain revenue. Excluding 
the safety, environmental, and market-creating advantages of 
VICS, the economic effect alone of smoother traffic is greater 
than the cost of the system, so the question of who should bear 
the burden of costs is really the major question. 
  Ideally speaking, the costs of the system should be born 
fairly between those who benefit from the system. Those who 
benefit from the economic effects resulting from smoother 
traffic include all the people driving on the roads. In that 
regard, there are more cars without VICS systems than there are 
cars with VICS, which are the information users. Moreover, the 
users of cars equipped with VICS are already having to bear the 
equipment costs associated with bringing this system up on-line 
for society's benefit. 
<H5>  6. Conclusion </H5>
  It takes quite a bit of money to build and operate VICS. 
Since VICS uses information collected by public officials and 
benefits society as a whole, it should not be made into a 
typical profit-making business. 
  In determining the beneficiaries of the system and who 
should 
pay for the cost of installation, it will be important in the 
future to determine how much of an effect broadcasting 
time-keyed information has, and what effect equalized driving 
times will have on actual traffic volumes on the road, and 
subsequently, to determine how, where, and when this can be 
achieved. 
  For people who have the system in their cars, VICS provides 
more flexibility in the routes that they can take, and in 
selecting those routes, is not the type of equipment that issues 
commands or instructions from the outside, but rather more than 
anything else, is user-friendly in the fact that it allows the 
driver of a car to make his own decisions based on position and 
availability. It is a system that makes effective use of road 
resources which are quite limited, and contributes toward safer 
and smoother traffic on roads and highways. 
  This fall, we are planning to hold a public demonstration of 
VICS in hopes of gaining wider public support and understanding 
of the system. Having received more cooperation than ever before 
from the government, we hope to have the VICS system up in 
operation soon.

<F P=106> [Article by T. Sasaki, H. Higuchi, T. Takasaka, T. Harada, </F>
T. Nakajima, and H. Okamura, Mitsubishi Motors Corp.] 
  [Text] The need for efficient ways to develop truck 
components, which in the paper described below is an axle system 
part, has resulted in a study of systematic CAE (computer-aided 
engineering) approach. The aim of the study is to predict the 
forces from the road acting on the axle system of a truck by 
mechanical analysis, and similarly, do a structural analysis and 
fatigue life analysis. 
<H5>  1. Introduction </H5>
  In the early development of the automobile, new designs and 
specification modifications were arrived at in the planning and 
design stage by estimating the forces acting on a vehicle during 
operation, and estimating the loads of component parts receiving 
those forces. 
  That eventually made it necessary to perfect a comprehensive 
method for estimating such forces by mechanical analysis CAE and 
structural analysis CAE. In Figure 1, we show a flow chart of 
that process. In specific terms, it means establishing a basic 
structural analysis model during the initial vehicle development 
stage and then creating applied models based on the intended use 
of the vehicle. In this paper, we try to estimate the forces 
acting on the axle system of a vehicle from the road surface 
under different driving conditions, and apply those results in a 
structural analysis of the axle system components in question, 
and try to estimate and assess the strength and fatigue life of 
those parts. 

<FIG ID=JPRS-JST-014L-14A></FIG>

<H5>         2. About CAE Model </H5>
<H5>  2.1 CAE Application </H5>
  Focusing on the front independent suspension of a compact 
truck, we simulated driving over rough terrain, turning, and 
braking, and also simulated driving over an irregular road 
surface. Treating those results as input conditions, we assessed 
the fatigue life of the system by performing a structural 
analysis of the knuckles in the front independent suspension. In 
Figure 2, we show a schematic drawing of the double-wishbone 
front independent suspension used for the simulation. In 
commercial vehicles, in particular, there is very little data 
available on actual performance and knowhow because independent 
suspension systems have only been around for a fairly short 
time. The tough conditions under which the vehicle is used, the 
many specifications, and the difficulty in testing critical 
states make it hard to determine test conditions. 

<FIG ID=JPRS-JST-014L-15A>      Figure 2. Front Independent Suspension </FIG>

  For those reasons, we did additional studies to determine 
what effect the CAE method may have on improving development 
efficiency. 
<H5>  2.2 Structural Analysis Vehicle Model </H5>
  In Figure 3, we show a structural analysis model of the 
vehicle used in the simulations (double-axle rear wheel drive 
cargo truck). The model used for the simulations was a full 
vehicle model consisting of a frame, rear body, axles, 
suspension system, tires, cab, engine, and transmission. To 
analyze vehicle movement, a mechanical movement analysis 
software (ADAMS and ADAMS/Tire) was used. The models used in the 
simulation included a basic model prepared by a group of 
specialists during the design and planning stage of the vehicle 
based on a structural analysis of the solid body elements, as 
well as applied models depending on the intended use of the 
vehicle.[.sup](1,2)[/] Our main aim here was to do a 
mechanical analysis of axle system parts, and being concerned 
about computational efficiency and accuracy, we worked with a 
model of the main solid body elements. 

<FIG ID=JPRS-JST-014L-15B>      Figure 3. Vehicle Model Produced by ADAMS </FIG>

<H5>  2.3 Mechanical Analysis Model of Axle Parts </H5>
  In Figure 4, we show a mechanical analysis model of the 
knuckle. For boundary conditions, we used the forces acting on 
the tires obtained by mechanical analysis. For support 
conditions, we used a model in which mechanical linkages are 
supported simply. With this level of modeling, the initial 
evaluations verified that an allowable accuracy had been 
achieved based on a comparison between actual and calculated 
measurements. 

<FIG ID=JPRS-JST-014L-15C>      Figure 4. BEM[.sup]*[/] Model and Boundary Conditions </FIG>

  The analytic solving was done using SURFES (general-purpose 
boundary element method),[.sup](3)[/] and the preprocessing 
was done using a general-purpose CAE software (concept 
station/I-DEAS). By being able to modify the shape of components 
having a complex three-dimensional walled structure such as was 
found in this study (e.g. making light-weight walls), we found 
the boundary element method to be better at sticking 
two-dimensional elements to the parts surface and easier to 
study than the finite element method which has three-dimensional 
solid elements. Computers are limited, however, in the number of 
possible contacts, so this method is really unsuitable for large 
models. In order to give direction to CAE design in the design 
department,[.sup](4)[/] we found it effective to make the 
analytical models as small as possible and do studies of models 
having mobility. 
<H5>  2.4 Assessing Fatigue Life </H5>
  First, we created a mechanical analysis and structural 
analysis model based on actual operating conditions of a truck 
to produce a frequency drawing of the stress fluctuation stress 
amplitude in order to evaluate the strength of the truck, and 
following that, estimated the fatigue life of the truck based on 
fatigue failure from cumulative linear wear and tear. The study 
was done here based on actual operating conditions while driving 
on the irregular road surface described above. A special-purpose 
software known as MALIAN was used for the evaluation. 
<H5>  3. CAE Simulation </H5>
<H5>  3.1 Road Simulation </H5>
  We compared the calculated forces acting on the tires from 
the road surface derived from the mechanical analysis model with 
the measurements taken from actual on-road operations. Measuring 
the stress of the axle components at certain points, we used the 
following conversion factor _a_[.sub]i[/] in order to find 
the road surface forces acting on the tires. 
  conversion factor _a_[.sub]i[/] = (force acting on 
tires)[.sub]i[/]/(stress values at evaluation 
points)[.sub]i[/] (1) 
  [.sub]i[/] = up/down, right/left, and forward/backward 
directions 
  The conversion factor was derived from actual data taken 
from 
bench tests performed on the axle parts. 
  In Figure 5, we show a comparison of the calculated and 
actual forces acting on the tire from the road surface when 
driving over a sinusoidal projection. Next, we discuss the 
simulation of irregular road surfaces to assess the durability 
of axle components. In Figure 6, we show a portion of the data 
obtained by measuring the irregular road surface using a laser 
displacement gauge.[.sup](6)[/] In Figure 7, we show a 
comparison of the calculated and actual forces acting on the 
tire from the road based on mechanical analysis using the road 
surface data obtained in Figure 6, and a distribution curve 
calculated from actual measurements. Figures 5 and 7 show that a 
correlation exists between the two, and that the analysis model 
is valid. 

<FIG ID=JPRS-JST-014L-16A>      Figure 5. Force Acting on Tire Driving Over Sinusoidal Projection (Actual and Calculated) </FIG>



<FIG ID=JPRS-JST-014L-16B>      Figure 6. Profile of an Irregular Road Surface </FIG>



<FIG ID=JPRS-JST-014L-16C>      Figure 7. Tire Force Response and Frequency Distribution </FIG>

<H5>  3.2 Stress Analysis Simulation </H5>
  In Figure 8, we show a comparison of actual and calculated 
stress generated at the R part of the axial root of the spindle 
when driving over a sinusoidal projection. We found these to be 
in virtual agreement. 

<FIG ID=JPRS-JST-014L-16D>      Figure 8. Stress Response at Root of Spindle </FIG>

  In Figure 9 [figure not reproduced], we show a stress 
analysis of the knuckle while a car is driving over an irregular 
road surface. In Figure 10 [figure not reproduced], we show a 
stress analysis of the knuckle while the car is being turned. 
This is when maximum stress is being generated at the R part of 
the axial root of the spindle. The different forces acting on 
the tire from the road causes changes in the position of maximum 
stress produced at the knuckle, so additional studies are needed 
for each vehicle operating mode. 
  In Figure 11, the response data of forces acting on the tire 
from the road is used to show a response time and 
stress-frequency distribution curve for stress calculations at 
the place where maximum stress is generated, which was found 
assuming a linear alignment of forces acting on the tire. 

<FIG ID=JPRS-JST-014L-17A>      Figure 11. Stress Response and Frequency Distribution </FIG>
<FIG ID=JPRS-JST-014L-17B>      Figure 11. cont. </FIG>

<H5>  3.3 Simulation To Evaluate Fatigue Life </H5>
  In Figure 12, we show an evaluation of fatigue life using a 
stress-distribution curve for places where maximum stress is 
generated while driving over an irregular road. Here, we used a 
P-S-N diagram to make the evaluation based on cumulative linear 
wear and tear, and degree of stress damage.[.sup](5)[/] We 
used a Miner calculation to compensate for values less than the 
stress limit. In the case of Figure 12, the degree of stress 
damage in the knuckle is less than 1, and passes the target set. 

<FIG ID=JPRS-JST-014L-17C>      Figure 12. Fatigue Life Estimation Chart </FIG>

<H5>  3.4 Approaches Used for Special Conditions </H5>
  In Figure 13, we show the actual and calculated results of 
stress generated at the R part of the axial root of the knuckle 
spindles when driving a vehicle over a sinusoidal projection, 
turning, and braking quickly. A closer concurrence was obtained 
with turning than with either of the other two, but this may be 
because the precise tire characteristics, particularly the 
rigidity along the horizontal axis and road surface æ, cannot 
be ascertained with any degree of accuracy. 

<FIG ID=JPRS-JST-014L-17D>      Figure 13. Maximum/Minimum Stress at Root of Spindle </FIG>

  Provided that there is linear alignment, we found that by 
integrating various vehicle conditions that we could produce 
accurate simulated models under dangerous and hard to verify 
conditions, and even under particularly bad conditions. 
<H5>  4. Conclusion </H5>
  Our research into innovative ways to analyze the component 
parts in development vehicles included the following: 
  (1) We estimated the road load acting on the components of a 
moving truck by mechanical analysis, and did a structural 
analysis of the parts. We tried a systematic approach to 
evaluate fatigue life, and getting good results, came up with a 
technology to do analysis based on CAE. 
  (2) We found that the application of this technology was 
particularly essential in the planning stage while in 
development and design, and that promoting CAE design 
(structural analysis) based on expert CAE support contributed 
enormously to development efficiency. 
  (3) In order to further improve this technology in the 
future, we concluded that we need to improve how CAE is used and 
build an engineering database with certain CAE models in mind.

  [Text] In order to investigate the vibration 
characteristics of exhaust pipes, we developed a computer system 
that uses the finite element method (FEM). This system enables 
the production of simple FEM models whose numerical calculations 
agree quite well with actual measurements. In this paper, we 
give an overview of the system and discuss some applications of 
the system in design. 
<H5>  1. Introduction </H5>
  As automobiles have gotten more sophisticated and higher 
quality over the past few years, there have been more and more 
demands for vibrational sounds to be reduced. The large degree 
to which the exhaust system contributes to vibrational sound 
makes it necessary that even small measures be taken to reduce 
vibration. Due to earlier studies to make the automobile 
lighter, cheaper, and faster, a lot of hope is being placed on 
simulation technology. 
  The vibrational sound produced by the exhaust system of a 
car 
can be divided into three types, namely, emission noise, 
radiation noise, and vibration transmission noise. A study was 
launched to analyze vibration transmission by the finite element 
method.[.sup](1,2,3)[/] The method that had been used until 
now involved a stress analysis using a plate model of the 
tailpipe joined to the muffler. An actual exhaust system, 
however, uses both a catalytic converter and flexible pipe, so 
it takes an enormous amount of time to create a computation 
model when trying to make a plate model of all the elements. 
Furthermore, since doing analysis requires specialized 
knowledge, the average design specialist finds it difficult to 
use such systems. 
  That being the case, in trying to reduce internal car noise 
caused by the exhaust system and improve the tailpipe's ability 
to withstand engine vibration, we developed a vibration 
characteristic analysis system for exhaust systems that the 
ordinary design engineer could use. A system such as this 
enables a series of work operations starting with the 
preparation of the computation model to the display of results 
to be performed effortlessly on a CAE terminal. The system also 
enables models of catalytic converters and flexible pipes to be 
done simply and accurately. In this paper, we provide an 
overview of the analysis system, and discuss ways of practically 
reducing vibration in cars by studying the computational 
accuracy of the exhaust system which includes a catalytic 
converter and flexible pipe. 
<H5>  2. System Outlined </H5>
  In order to analyze the vibration transmission 
characteristic 
of the entire exhaust system, we built a system in which the 
ordinary design engineer could do on a CAE terminal without much 
difficulty. In Figure 1, we show the configuration of the system 
and the computational flow. The system consists of CAD, 
preprocessing, postprocessing, a characteristic data unit, and a 
solver. 


<FIG ID=JPRS-JST-014L-18A>      Figure 1. Calculation Flow </FIG>

  The computation model is concerned with the area directly 
after the exhaust manifold from the flange to the end of the 
exhaust system, but also includes various support elements 
mounted to the body. As seen in Figure 2, the model is made one 
component at a time and a standard mesh pattern is used to 
automatically separate the components in the database. The model 
separates the different pipes into beam elements, and the 
muffler, flange, and supports into plate elements. In developing 
the model, consideration is given to reducing the rigidity of 
the curved pipe, and to reducing the Young percentage in 
materials. The engine vibration data, which is input externally, 
and the actual data on things such as quality, dynamic spring 
constant, and attenuation constant, which are the 
characteristics of the flexible pipe and catalytic converter, 
are input from a CAD terminal. 

<FIG ID=JPRS-JST-014L-19A>      Figure 2. Modeling Image </FIG>

  In Figure 3, we illustrate a computation model. This 
particular model consists of 3,000 nodal points and 2,100 
elements, and took more than 16 hours to create. This was, 
however, five times faster than conventional systems when it 
comes to making a model of this type. 

<FIG ID=JPRS-JST-014L-19B>      Figure 3. Structure and FEM Element Division of Exhaust System </FIG>

  Merely by separating the input into eigenvalue and response 
calculations, we eliminated the need to set analysis conditions 
which require a lot of time and special expertise. The computer 
used for the calculations was a Cray Y-MP supercomputer. The 
analysis program used was called NASTRAN. 
  The calculated results were displayed so that reconfigured 
diagrams, animation, vibration, stress frequency 
characteristics, and stress distribution could be processed with 
minimal operation. 
  This type of system allows an ordinary design specialist to 
create a computation model, display the results, and analyze the 
vibration transmission characteristic of an exhaust system. 
<H5>  3. Study of Computational Accuracy </H5>
  Using the FEM system, we did an analysis of the exhaust 
system and compared the results obtained with actual 
measurements based on hammer excitation. The areas of comparison 
were the frequency responses obtained from the resonance mode 
and No. 1 support unit in the exhaust system. 
<H5>  3.1 Basic Exhaust System </H5>
  The basic exhaust system shown in Figure 3 is comprised of a 
sub-muffler, a main muffler, and pipes and supports that link 
them together. In Figure 4, we show a comparison between 
calculated and actual measurements. There was good agreement 
between actual and calculated values for both the frequency 
responses and resonance modes. In terms of computation accuracy, 
the resonance frequency fell within +/- 10 Hz and the vibration 
level to within +/- 5 dB, providing a level of accuracy good 
enough for commercial use. 

<FIG ID=JPRS-JST-014L-20A>      Figure 4. Base of Exhaust System </FIG>

<H5>  3.2 Exhaust System With Catalytic Converter </H5>
  We added a catalytic converter to the exhaust system used in 
the previous section and studied computation accuracy. We input 
the actual mass and moment of inertia along three axes of the 
catalytic converter, and as shown in Figure 5, constructed a 
model in which the mass points were linked by solid body and 
spring elements. In Figure 6, we show a comparison between 
calculated and actual measurements. There was good agreement 
between actual and measured for both frequency responses and 
resonance modes, and due to the addition of the catalytic 
converter, we were able to estimate the changes in the vibration 
characteristic of the exhaust system. In terms of computation 
accuracy, resonance frequency fell within +/- 10 Hz and the 
vibration level was within +/- 10 dB, providing us with a level 
of accuracy good enough for commercial use. 

<FIG ID=JPRS-JST-014L-20B>      Figure 5. FEM Model of Catalytic Converter </FIG>


<FIG ID=JPRS-JST-014L-20C>      Figure 6. Exhaust System With Catalytic Converter </FIG>

<H5>  3.3 Exhaust System Built With Flexible Piping </H5>
  We added flexible pipe to the exhaust system used in the 
previous section and studied computation accuracy. We input the 
actual mass and dynamic spring constant along three axes of the 
flexible piping, and as shown in Figure 7, constructed a beam 
model. In Figure 8, we show a comparison between calculated and 
actual measurements. There was good agreement between actual and 
measured for both frequency response tendencies and resonance 
modes. There was a big gap of more than 90Hz between actual and 
measured in the vibration level, but this was because the 
calculated results produced a frequency response diagram in 
which there was a uniform applied damping constant throughout 
the entire excitation mode compared to actual measurements in 
which the damping effect on the flexible piping was irregular. 

<FIG ID=JPRS-JST-014L-20D>      Figure 7. FEM Model of Flexible Pipe </FIG>



<FIG ID=JPRS-JST-014L-20E>      Figure 8. Exhaust System With Flexible Pipe </FIG>

  As we have seen above, using this system, we are now able to 
satisfactorily estimate the vibration transmission 
characteristic of an exhaust system. 
<H5>  4. Applications for Reduced Exhaust System Vibration </H5>
  The main compelling force acting on the exhaust system is 
the 
vibration of the power plant, which includes the engine among 
other things. Generally speaking, when the resonance frequencies 
of the exhaust system are vibrating at the same frequency as 
these, the exhaust system vibrates severely. This causes sound 
problems such as poor idling or loud internal noises, and 
strength problems as well, including the inability to withstand 
resonating vibrations. To resolve these problems, we installed 
flexible pipe, a mass damper, and dynamic damper to help reduce 
the points of resonance and resonance levels, and reduce the 
body transmission force by tuning the support system (cf. Figure 
9). 

<FIG ID=JPRS-JST-014L-21A>      Figure 9. Conceptual Scheme for Reducing Exhaust Vibration </FIG>

<H5>  4.1 Effect of Bending Rigidity in Flexible Piping </H5>
  We examined the effect that the bending rigidity of the 
flexible pipe has on the overall vibration characteristic of the 
exhaust system. For the computation model, we used the same 
exhaust system as was used in Section 3.3 above which had a 
catalytic converter and flexible pipe, and input the bending 
rigidity of the pipe as initial -20% and -40% 
changes. In 
Figure 10, we show the frequency response results for the No. 1 
support unit. We can predict from this that changing the bending 
rigidity of the piping to more than 50Hz is an effective means 
of reducing the resonance frequency of the exhaust system. 

<FIG ID=JPRS-JST-014L-21B>      Figure 10. Effect of Spring Constant </FIG>

<H5>  4.2 Effect of Support Positions </H5>
  Next, using the same computation model as in the previous 
section, we examined what effect the position of the No. 1 
support unit, which is a response point, has on the overall 
vibration characteristic of the exhaust system. We moved the 
position of the support unit backward relative to the exhaust 
system at 100mm intervals. In Figure 11, we show the frequency 
response results for the No. 1 support unit. This has a 50Hz or 
more effect on the exhaust system, so we can estimate what the 
effect will be relative to the resonance mode. For example, in 
contrast to resonance frequencies in the 60Hz resonance mode, we 
can estimate that the peak characteristic of the vibrations will 
all but disappear by moving the support unit back by 200mm. 

<FIG ID=JPRS-JST-014L-21C>      Figure 11. Effect of Flexible Pipe Position </FIG>

<H5>  4.3 Practical Applications in Cars </H5>
  Finally, we look at some examples of how this system can be 
applied practically to actual car exhaust systems that have 
adopted flexible pipe as shown in Figure 12. This exhaust system 
had an exhaust system resonance of about 25Hz when first 
developed. In Figure 13, we show the actual and measured 
frequency responses of the No. 2 support unit before any 
corrective actions had been taken. By studying numerous cases, 
we determined that adding a No. 2 support mass damper would be 
an effective corrective measure. In Figure 14, we show the 
numerical results from adding the damper. In the actual car, 
adding the damper was effective in reducing resonance vibration 
by 2Hz and the vibration level by 5 dB.

<FIG ID=JPRS-JST-014L-22C>      Figure 14. Effect of Damper </FIG>


<H5>  5. Conclusion </H5>
  (1) We developed a vibration characteristic analysis system 
for exhaust systems that any ordinary design specialist would 
not find difficult to use. 
  (2) We studied making models of a flexible pipe and 
catalytic 
converter, and in so doing, were able to predict the vibration 
characteristic of the exhaust system with good accuracy. 
  (3) Using this system, we were able to estimate the 
vibration 
characteristic of the exhaust system and effectively reduce 
vibrations.

  [Text] In this paper, we present existing and potential 
applications of CFD in designing automobiles by supercomputers, 
and outline the necessary CFD methodology. In recent years, CFD 
has been used to better understand internal and external 
aerodynamic flows, the intake and exhaust flows of engines, and 
air circulation within cars. In this paper, we also discuss what 
the requirements are for designing automobiles with CFD, and 
finally, say something about future trends and outlooks. 
<H5>  1. Introduction </H5>
  In 1986, the automobile industry in Japan started using 
supercomputers to assist in doing structural analysis and 
collision analysis. In the last few years, a lot of companies 
have started using CFD (computational fluid dynamics) in areas 
where large memories are involved. The reason for this we 
believe is that collision/safety analysis has reached more or 
less the same level in companies, so companies are now turning 
their attention to the use of CFD in R&amp;D on aerodynamics, 
engine 
combustion, and air-circulation analysis in order to achieve 
better fuel consumption, lower exhaust emissions, and better 
driving comfort, thus, CFD is steadily being used more and more 
in the design stages of automobiles. 
  In this paper, we discuss the role of CFD in designing 
automobiles, and at the same time describe how supercomputers 
have been used over the past few years in CFD-based R&amp;D and 
design. 
<H5>  2. CFD Applications and Characteristics </H5>
  As we can see from Figure 1 [figure not reproduced], there 
are a lot of important areas in which CFD applications can 
directly affect the performance of a car. In the last few years 
especially, companies are turning to CFD as a design tool for 
achieving lower fuel consumption, lower exhaust emissions, and 
better driving comfort, and are now using it to a greater degree 
in design departments for doing R&amp;D. 
  The cycle in which car models change has shown a tendency to 
grow from five to six years, but it is also important that new 
models be put out quickly that meet the needs of users, 
therefore, we find that there are more demands now then ever 
before to shorten design and development time. One of the ways 
suggested to deal with shorter turnaround times is to use CFD in 
design to shorten development time, reduce prototype cost, and 
improve performance. 
  When developing a new automobile, we also want to have an 
analysis method that we can easily use to do routine analysis 
work that is unrelated to designing automobiles, so even in 
computational flow dynamics, standard analysis techniques must 
be developed that enable comparative studies to be done in areas 
such as complex mixed flow analysis. 
<H5>  3. Role of CFD in Design </H5>
  If we were going to use CFD in design in its present state, 
it would be inadequate in terms of reliability, accuracy, 
cost-performance, and ease of use. The main problems are as 
follows: 
  (1) It has no computational ability to accurately capture 
mixed flows. 
  (2) It cannot produce a mesh of complex shape very easily. 
  (3) It takes a long time to do calculations and requires a 
large memory. 
  Below, we list the roles that CFD could play: 
  (1) It could be used to analyze complex flows with a simple 
generalized computation method. 
  (2) It could be used to do inexpensive high-speed output 
even 
in a large analysis. 
  (3) It could be used as necessary to establish reliable 
calculations and evaluation methods. 
  The problem areas and possibilities described above tend to 
run counter to each other, therefore, it is essential that an 
ample study of approaches and methods be taken in CFD R&amp;D. 
  With that in mind, we at Daihatsu Motors have adopted the 
following methods/approaches to make CFD analysis more practical: 
  (1) Use a k-_e_ mixed flow model 
  (2) Reduce computing time to less than 20 hours with one 
CRAY 
computer 
  (3) Show a sizable reduction in analysis error to less than 
10 percent 
  In order to create a balance between three elements, namely, 
producing computation meshes, doing fluid computations, and 
visualizing flow, we purchased some high-quality market software 
and put together a supercomputing network (cf. Figure 2 [figure 
not reproduced]). At present, we are using a Cray supercomputer 
at the rate of about 500 hours per month for CFD analysis. In 
Figures 3 and 4 [figures not reproduced], we show supercomputer 
applications by analysis field and use. 
<H5>  4. Different Types of Analysis and Design Output </H5>
<H5>  4.1 Aerodynamic Analysis </H5>
  At Daihatsu, we have adopted two different approaches to 
analysis in the design stage. The first is aerodynamic analysis 
of the vehicle periphery using the SCRYU code[.sup](1)[/] in 
a BFC coordinate system as shown in Figure 5 [figure not 
reproduced]. The aim of this approach is to produce a Cray model 
having no unevenness in the air flow to the engine compartment, 
the door mirror, and the floor. In approximately 20 hours of 
computing time, we were able to analyze the resistance 
coefficient and lift coefficient to a less than 5 percent margin 
of error, and have been using this approach in developing body 
designs having little resistance and dynamic lift. 
  The other method is heat flow analysis within the engine 
compartment using the STREAM code in a Cartesian coordinate 
system[.sup](2)[/] as shown in Figure 6 [figure not 
reproduced]. Investigating the effect of the fan, we were able 
to analyze the average rate of flow through the radiator in two 
hours of computing time to within a 10 percent margin of error, 
and at the same time, find the temperature distribution within 
the engine compartment. There has been a tendency over the past 
few years toward higher engine compartment temperatures due to 
new freon substitutes and the engine undercover used to reduce 
external noise, so this approach has been used a lot as an 
analysis tool to study design openings and engine compartment 
layouts in the design and planning stage. 
<H5>  4.2 Engine Flow Analysis </H5>
  As we can see from Figure 7 [figure not reproduced], we have 
been using CFD in a three-dimensional analysis[.sup](3)[/] of 
flows within the engine cylinder using a special engine analysis 
code (AVL-FIRE) that is able to use both the BFC coordinate 
system and a non-structural mesh coordinate system. The 
calculations we do from the dead points on the intake to the 
dead points in the compression at every 0.25ë crank angle 
take approximately 15 hours of computation time. With this 
analysis, we have been working on the shifting boundary problems 
in the valves and pistons and the rezoning of the mesh within 
the cylinder. Engine flow analysis has proved useful in 
optimizing swirls, tumbles, mixed energy flows, and intake 
resistance, etc. that largely influence the shape of the 
scavenger port, and it has also proved useful in developing 
engines with high output and low fuel consumption. It is 
particularly challenging, indeed, to use it in analyzing flows 
within the engine cylinder even experimentally, so in that 
sense, CFD can help to optimize the shape of the engine in the 
design stage, and after prototyping, can be useful in doing 
detailed analysis by experimentation. 
<H5>  4.3 Air-Conditioning Analysis </H5>
  As is shown in Figure 8 [figure not reproduced], we are 
using 
the STAR-CD code in a non-structural mesh system to analyze 
window defrosting by a defroster nozzle.[.sup](4)[/] There is 
a strong correlation between window defrosting and surface 
velocity, so if we can predict the surface velocity on the glass 
based on the output flow from the defroster nozzle, we will be 
able to estimate window defrosting. Used with an EWS, this code 
enables high-speed computations in 20 hours time. Moreover, 
taking a view toward ergonomics, we are also analyzing interior 
air flows to get an idea of the velocities near the heads of 
passengers in hopes of developing an optimum air-conditioning 
system. 
<H5>  5. Conclusion </H5>
  In order to further improve the effectiveness of CFD in 
design, the following problems need to be tackled: 
  (1) Standardizing analyses by an auto-mesh system 
  (2) Achieving more accurate computation by an improved mixed 
flow theory 
  (3) Achieving inexpensive high-speed computations using a 
super high-speed parallel computer 
  In the foregoing sections, we described the present 
situation 
at Daihatsu Motors in which we are actively promoting the use of 
computational flow dynamics in R&amp;D and design using 
supercomputers. There are a lot of areas where CFD is an 
unknown, so we can expect to see it play a larger role in the 
future. We believe the time is coming when software will undergo 
the same kind of technical revolution as hardware, and that 
there is a good possibility that we will see codes then that are 
unthinkable now.

<F P=106> [Article by T. Kuriyama, Daihatsu Motor Co., Ltd.] </F>
  [Text] Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) affects many 
areas of automobile design. The development of the supercomputer 
has spurred interest in CFD research. There are very few case 
studies in which CFD has been used as a design tool. The areas 
that present the biggest difficulties in using CFD include 
geometrical complexity, unsteady and turbulent flows, and 
boundary conditions. In this paper, we present some practical 
ways in which CFD has been used, and outline what the 
requirements are for using CFD. We also discuss the management 
of CFD R&amp;D. 
<H5>  1. Introduction </H5>
  Starting in 1986, right about the same time that 
supercomputers first appeared, scientists working in the field 
of CAE analysis began doing research into collision analysis and 
fluid analysis. Collision analysis is being used more and more 
in design and laboratory testing, and has contributed enormously 
to shorter lead times for new automobiles, lower prototype 
costs, and improved performance. On the other hand, however, 
there appears to be some doubts about fluid analysis as 
exemplified by aerodynamic analysis. We believe that this is due 
to the fact that very little has been produced in the way of 
concrete results where fluid analysis has been used in design, 
despite the fact that a great deal of time and effort has gone 
into R&amp;D. 
  In this paper, we try not to describe the complex techniques 
used in analyzing fluids, but rather discuss the question of 
what we could expect if computational fluid dynamics was used in 
research and development and design with a personal view toward 
uses in this company. 
<H5>  2. Reasons Why is CFD Ineffective in Design </H5>
  As we can see from Table 1, there are a lot of areas where 
CFD has a direct effect on the performance of a car. In the last 
few years in particular, companies are turning to CFD as a 
design tool for achieving lower fuel consumption, lower exhaust 
emissions, and better driving comfort, and it would not be 
overstating matters to say that CFD is being used more and more. 
There are some CFD researchers who believe that the technology 
would have already been developed if high-performance computers 
were available, but as things stand now, CFD is inadequate in 
terms of reliability, analysis precision, cost-performance, and 
ease of use.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 


  Below, we list the three main reasons for this: 
  (1) It lacks a computation method for accurately 
representing 
mixed viscous flows (k-_e_ mixed flow model, LES, advanced 
three-dimensional differential calculus, etc.). 
  (2) It cannot produce a mesh around complex shapes very 
easily (Cartesian mesh, BFC, unstructured mesh, etc.). 
  (3) It takes a long time to do calculations and requires a 
large memory (no inexpensive, large-scale CPUs or memories 
available at present time). 
  What is at the bottom of this is that more than 
10[.sup]13[/] grid points are needed in order to calculate 
three-dimensional mixed flows (based on the Kolmogorov vortex 
scale of Re10[.sup]6[/] Reynolds number), and no matter how 
advanced super high-speed parallel computers become, there is 
still a limit in numerical analysis to being able to directly 
solve Navier-Stokes equations that describe viscous flows. 
<H5>  3. Various CFD Approaches </H5>
<H5>  3.1 Mixed Flow Model </H5>
  At the present time, one of the practical problems being 
faced in theoretical research into CFD is constructing a mixed 
flow model. This is a problem of trying to present a 
comprehensive picture of flow by averaging the amount of small 
swirls and fluctuations in a mixed flow. The Japanese automobile 
industry is divided into those companies whose researchers use 
the k-_e_ mixed flow model, and those companies whose 
researchers do not use the mixed flow model but rather solve 
direct Navier-Stokes equations by rough computational grids. 
  In Table 2, we show the unique characteristics of both 
approaches. The important point to remember here is that both 
approaches have their weaknesses. When considering CFD use in 
design, the following conditions must be met: 
  (1) Simple generalized computation method 
  (2) Inexpensive high-speed output 
  (3) Reliable calculations and evaluation methods 



  ----------------------------------------------------------------------------- 
|Table 2. CFD Approaches                                                    |

----------------------------------------------------------------------------- 


  Moreover, the technical level at which most designers wish 
to 
see CFD is not for absolute evaluations having the same level of 
accuracy as experiments but rather in relative evaluations in 
which designers can judge the relative merits of a number of 
different design plans. 
  Even if the supercomputer makes notable progress in the 
future in terms of the above conditions, it will still be 
necessary to introduce appropriate models to analyze mixed 
flows. We could say that the CFD approach using the k-_e_ mixed 
flow model is the early method of choice among design 
specialists at this time. There are some designers, however, who 
have the knowhow to know the weaknesses of the k-_e_ mixed flow 
model, and are able to make careful analysis and analyze 
relative changes. 
<H5>  3.2 Pre- and Post-Processing Programs--Areas of Complexity </H5>
  In CFD, it is necessary to form discrete spaces around an 
object having a complex shape, that is, to divide it into a 
grid. Some different types of grids include Cartesian meshes, 
body-fitted coordinate meshes, and non-structural meshes, but 
there are no discrete methods at the present time which 
integrate these. For that reason, it is necessary to separate 
grid types according to their strengths and weaknesses as shown 
in Table 3. Conversely, however, since there are no good 
grid-generating preprocessing programs that specialize in fluid 
analysis, a decision has to be made with regard to the desired 
accuracy and the time allowed to produce the grid. 



  ----------------------------------------------------------------------------

---------------------------------------------------------------------------- 


  The use of post-processing software, which visualizes flow, 
is divided into those uses having mainly to do with good 
responses, i.e. being able to simply compare calculated results 
with actual measurements, and to use those mainly concerned with 
beautiful appealing visual presentations although they might be 
more time-consuming and expensive. 
<H5>  3.3 Computer and CFD </H5>
  The person in charge of computational flow dynamics is 
always 
complaining about the CPU not having enough memory. This is 
because the finer he/she draws the mesh, the greater the 
importance of computational accuracy. The addition of more grid 
points is not an issue when it comes to structural analysis. 
Thereupon, what is necessary is that the person in charge of CFD 
be aware of the purpose for which it is being used. It is 
important that CFD be steadily made more practical while 
techniques are developed that enable it to be used with fewer 
large-scale calculations and better cost-performance. It will 
not be too many years from now when we see a technical 
revolution in supercomputers in which massive parallel computers 
and supercomputers will be downsized to desktop models. In any 
event, we must not forget that developing computational flow 
dynamics based on advances in computers will realistically yield 
more useful analyses and alleviate some of the work entrusted to 
designers. 
<H5>  4. Present Status of CFD in Daihatsu </H5>
  In Figures 1, 2, 3, and 4 [figures not reproduced], we show 
some examples of the work Daihatsu is doing with CFD in R&amp;D 
and 
design.[.sup](1-3)[/] Also, in Figure 5, we show the computer 
system being used with CFD. We select a hardware and software 
suited to the type of analysis and put it into full service. We 
check the following basic points when developing a model: 
  (1) Ascertain the needs of the designer and determine the 
time required. 
  (2) Lay down the results to come out of analysis in stages. 
  (3) Select a method that does not require a lot of CPUs. 

<FIG ID=JPRS-JST-014L-26A>      Figure 5. CFD Supercomputing Network </FIG>

  Organizationally speaking, the persons in charge of CFD are 
assigned to a single group and are responsible for both hardware 
and software. This naturally promotes a good interchange with 
respect to problem areas and knowhow, and enables models to be 
developed with greater efficiency. Moreover, the design, 
testing, and CFD groups have formed a single entity and are 
promoting various R&amp;D activities including projects involving 
the development of new automobiles. 
<H5>  5. R&amp;D </H5>
  Computer makers have been coming out with one new product 
after another, but software companies too have been coming out 
with one new CFD software package after another. One of the big 
choices that has to be made with regards to software is whether 
to purchase it on the market, or develop it in-house. There has 
been a tendency until now to equate the development of software 
with a company's technical strength, but in recent years, the 
questions have come down buying commercial software or 
developing it in-house software, and how far does it go in 
clarifying phenomena and how much does it contribute to product 
development. The research institutes of companies are no longer 
places that develop software, but instead are becoming places 
that develop and apply analysis techniques and knowhow. If we 
talk about effective research or improving technology, it 
generally means adapting software to fit the needs of the 
company after it has been purchased, and developing new 
technologies with in-house knowhow. To that extent, the 
performance of commercial software has been much improved over 
the past few years. The research conducted by universities and 
corporations is naturally quite different. Universities focus on 
basic research while companies focus on applied research, so it 
is important that these two groups work together to exchange 
information. In other words, it would probably be more effective 
for companies to adopt the specialized system of research shown 
in Figure 6. 

<FIG ID=JPRS-JST-014L-27A>      Figure 6. Role of Various Laboratories in CFD Research </FIG>

<H5>  6. Making CFD Useful in Design </H5>
  In order for CFD to be used in design, we will start 
providing the design specialists and test researchers with 
estimates prior to the test results being received in order that 
we can begin trying to gain their confidence. Since the faster 
we get the results the better, it will be necessary to devise a 
way to simplify and standardize the analysis method, and be able 
to output data quicker. Needless to say, we think it would be 
best if designers were able to do the analysis, but the flow 
phenomenon itself is quite complex, so in most cases, a CFD 
specialist must be called in to determine whether the 
calculations are correct or not. In other words, it is important 
not to believe the CFD calculations as they are given, but to 
use estimates and opinions corrected by knowledgeable analysts. 
  As things stand now, CFD fails to produce adequate 
calculations no matter what the task, so it is only natural to 
want to use these calculations with earlier experiences and 
adopt a single track approach. In other words, to ignore the 
parts that do not have a major effect on flows, simplify shape 
as much as possible, and quickly output calculations. After 
that, the tested knowhow that has been built up from previous 
test results is used as a shortcut in making CFD useful in 
design. 
<H5>  7. Conclusion </H5>
  Below, we list the main points taken from our discussion 
above on the practical use of computational flow analysis in 
R&amp;D 
and design. 
  (1) A computer is necessary for analyzing mixed flow models 
no matter how advanced. 
  (2) Researchers must develop techniques that meet design 
needs. 
  (3) If earlier knowhow is added to simplified calculations, 
CFD can be made sufficiently useful in design. 
  Now and then we see an analysis in which the flows are 
beautifully animated and which make heavy use of computers, but 
more often than not, they lack a colorful presentation and are a 
long way from being of practical use in design. It will probably 
be necessary for CFD to plod along a dark and lonely road step 
by step until it builds up its own credibility.

<H5>  1. Introduction </H5>
  As the economic recession continues, a social re-examination 
seems to be taking place with regard to giving consumers the 
kinds of products and services that they really want. I believe 
that in times such as this there is more of a demand for 
authentic products and technologies. What I mean here by 
authentic is providing a basic value for goods purchased that 
gives the average customer a sense of satisfaction. 
  To meet these needs requires mature technologies that show 
an 
understanding of the consumer and what they want. The mature 
technologies referred to here are consumer technologies that 
essentially solve the problems that people consider important to 
them. For that reason, I think that we are entering a time in 
which research institutes that have stockpiled many different 
technologies will be asked to lead the way. 
  Therefore, in this paper, I would like to introduce the 
Mazda 
Technical Research Center, and in doing so, discuss what it is 
doing to address these new social trends. 
<H5>  2. Research Center Profiled </H5>
  The first technical research center that Mazda established 
to 
concentrate on new technologies was in 1985 at its headquarters 
in Hiroshima, and then in 1987, it added the Yokohama Technical 
Research Center in Yokohama. The basic "idea" behind opening the 
technical research center here in Yokohama was, to use the 
slogan at the time, "build an automobile culture." What this 
means is not treating the car simply as a means of travel, but 
treating it as one of the essential elements of society and 
culture that people need. 
  When the research centers initially received word of this 
new 
slogan, the research center at Mazda headquarters in Hiroshima 
decided to put its emphasis on new technologies that were 
directly related to the development of car types, whereas the 
research center in Yokohama decided it would focus on basic 
technologies in advanced fields oriented toward automobile 
technologies of the 21st century. At present, the two research 
centers are exchanging ideas and deepening ties with one another 
based on respective areas of expertise, and are steadily playing 
more important roles as the core places within Mazda for 
developing new technologies. 
  Next, before we get into specific research activities, I 
would like to discuss my own views regarding research. 
<H5>  3. Personal Views Regarding Research </H5>
  Research institutes are at the pinnacle of research and 
development, and have an important mission in developing and 
exploring consumer technologies. For that reason, I feel that 
research institutes have to reflect the long-term and 
medium-term needs of consumers in their research. 
  With that in mind, I would like to take the opportunity here 
to state the direction I believe that consumer trends are going. 
  Until now, companies have stressed high value-added cars 
that 
offer more in the way of diversity, performance, and 
functionality. In the future, however, there will probably be a 
shift from superficial "enjoyment" needs to more basic 
"enjoyment" needs. The need, for example, to maintain respect 
for human life, whether one's own or others, is growing ever 
more stronger in terms of both product safety and the 
environment. 
  For example, something has to be done about the more than 
10,000 people a year that die in auto accidents, and the other 
problems that exist such as environmental pollution caused by 
carbon dioxide and nitrous oxides, and also find other energy 
alternatives to petroleum. These problems are an immediate and 
future threat to ourselves, our families, and our children, and 
are cause for concern. 
  These are essentially problems that have to do with the car 
itself, so if we are to resolve these issues, we must steadily 
stockpile those technologies with an eye toward the future. 
  With that said, I would now like to introduce some areas of 
research to show the work we are doing in tackling some of these 
problems. 
<H5>  4. Research Activities Outlined </H5>
  In this section, I have divided the research activities into 
"environment-friendly" and "people-friendly" research, and 
focused in on particular research projects in each area from the 
perspective discussed above of addressing the basic needs of 
today's consumers. 
<H5>  4.1 "Environment-Friendly" Technologies </H5>
  What we mean here by "environment-friendly technologies" are 
those technologies for solving the environmental and energy 
resource problems we are likely to face in the 21st century. 
More specifically, it means those technologies concerned with 
developing energy alternatives to petroleum, and those 
technologies concerned with recycling that try to limit exhaust 
gas emissions by researching new combustion methods for reducing 
carbon dioxide and nitrous oxide emissions, and making effective 
use of resources. 
  (1) Technologies for Developing Energy Substitutes 
  I would like to start by talking about the hydrogen 
rotary-engine automobile (HR-X). This car was developed to 
convey the image of an urban-type commuter car to be used in a 
21st century environment restored with light and greenery. 
Figure 1 [figure not reproduced] is a photograph of the HR-X 
car. A hydrogen rotary engine is a clean engine that burns 
hydrogen, and is revolutionary in the sense that it does not 
emit carbon dioxide nor destroy natural cycles. 
  More recently, we developed a prototype model of that car 
outfitted with a hydrogen fuel cell, and successfully test drove 
it for the first time. Figure 2 [figure not reproduced] is a 
photograph of the hydrogen fuel cell car. This car enabled us to 
clarify a number of technical issues having to do with 
outfitting a car such as this, and took us one step closer 
toward achieving the goal of a future society based on 
hydrogen-fueled cars. 
<H5>  (2) Technologies for Controlling Exhaust Gas Emissions </H5>
  In terms of research on engines, we are researching the 
composition of fuel mixtures and combustion mechanism using a 
variety of methods including both visual and computer-based. In 
trying to change the flame propagation process, we have been 
doing research on a peripheral combustion process that causes 
the spark ignition to occur from the periphery of the cylinder. 
Using this technique, we were able to reduce nitrous oxide 
emissions dramatically, and bring about a major improvement in 
lean burn combustion. That research received the Asahara 
Academic Achievement Award at the 42nd Japan Society of 
Automotive Engineers Conference. 
<H5>  (3) Recycling Technologies </H5>
  We are also doing research on materials in terms of 
recycling, which includes both metals and plastics, and in so 
doing, have developed a recyclable plastic composite made of a 
plastic fiber-reinforced liquid crystal polymer. We now have the 
ability to recycle plastic composites that were once virtually 
impossible to recycle, and are able to make more effective use 
of our resources. 
<H5>  4.2 "People-Friendly" Technologies </H5>
  What we mean here by "people-friendly" technologies are 
those 
technologies concerned with understanding the needs of the 
driver and passengers, and those concerned with improving safety 
in order to make the automobile society we live in more 
enjoyable and trouble-free. 
  (1) Preventive Safety 
  We are involved in a number of research projects on advanced 
technologies concerned with preventing accidents. One of these 
involves a "safe driving support system," and another a "road 
traffic communication system." 
  The safe driving support system is a system that acts as a 
back-up in case of driver error, and the communication system is 
a system for providing drivers with safety information about the 
roads. For example, in the safe driving support system project, 
we are doing research on automatic brakes and a white-line 
recognition method. 
  In Figure 3 [figure not reproduced], we show the test car we 
are using in our research on white-line recognition by image 
processing. Mounted in the trunk of the car is a high-speed 
computer programmed to recognize road features. 
  (2) Human Technologies 
  We are also making headway in research on a "driver 
simulator" in order to elucidate the driving psychology and 
behavior characteristics of drivers. In Figure 4, we show a 
general drawing of the driving simulator with a driver on board. 
The driving simulator is expected to be used as a tool for 
elucidating causes of auto accidents, and also as a tool for 
researching driving characteristics of beginners and older 
drivers. 

<FIG ID=JPRS-JST-014L-29A>      Figure 4. General Drawing of Driving Simulator </FIG>

  We have also been doing research on ways to evaluate driver 
alertness by measuring brain waves so that we can take those 
habits into account when designing the inside of the car so as 
to make it harder for the driver to fall asleep. Figure 5 
[figure not reproduced] shows an experiment being conducted to 
ascertain the relationship between brain wave signals and 
delayed responses in humans due to decreased alertness (person 
being tested in photograph is author of article). 
  There are a lot of central functions in the human brain that 
remain unknown. I think that by creating an understanding of 
driver characteristics such as recognition, alertness, and 
fatigue by studying brain activities that we can offer new 
consumer technologies for improved safety. 
<H5>  5. Conclusion </H5>
  In the foregoing, we profiled the entire research center and 
discussed some individual research projects. 
  I think that the keys to providing consumers with what they 
want in terms of basic values are the technologies that we have 
been busy stockpiling. 
  In introducing the research center from this perspective, we 
want to thank the many technical engineers and researchers 
specializing in automobile technology for their help in shedding 
some light on the research projects being carried out within the 
center.

  A new research project has been presented that will focus on 
the advanced technology required by the next generation of 
helicopters. According to sources, the Japan Key Tech Center 
will spearhead establishment of a research corporation at the 
end of March with collaboration of five private manufacturers 
including Kawasaki Heavy Industries and Shimadzii Corporation. 
They plan to jointly invest a total of 9 billion yen during the 
7-year period by the end of the year 2000. The project's 
objectives are to establish a technology for reduced noise, 
safety and scheduled flight in order to develop high operability 
commuter helicopters less dependent on good weather or pilot 
skill. Based on the research results, the project will be 
expanded to include joint development with overseas aircraft and 
helicopter manufacturers. 
  The ability of helicopters to take off and land at urban 
heliports has attracted considerable attention as part of a high 
speed transportation system in the 21st century. In addition to 
the Japan Key Tech Center (investment rate:59.9%), 5 
private 
companies including Kawasaki Heavy Industries. Ltd. 
(19.3%), 
Shimadzu Corporation (3. 6%), Tokyo Avionics Instruments 
(3.3%). Teijin Seiki Co., Ltd. (2.3%), and Japan 
Aircraft Mfg. 
Co.. Ltd., (l.6%) have jointly invested to establish a 
research 
development corporation called. ``The Commuter Helicopter 
Advanced Technology Research Corporation,'' (tentative name) on 
2l March. The headquarters will be located at KHI's Gifu Plant. 
KHI President Hiroshi Oba will also hold the presidency of the 
new research company. 
  The research will include ``outside aircraft noise reduction 
technology'' for quieter rotor systems using the latest computer 
fluid analysis technology, a control system for easy operation, 
and ``flight safety technology'' which combines flight and 
management systems. The research will be funded at a level of 9 
billion yen during the 7-year period by the end of the year 
2000. Helicopter pilots will concentrate only on conducting 
flight safety. 
  Details of the research schedule include concept study, 
specifications at the system level, and system initiatives in 
FY94, basic level research and testing in FY95-97, testing at 
the system and operational levels, and evaluation of research 
objectives in FY98-2000. 
  Environmental safety and expansion of the helicopter market 
are expected to be realized through establishment of this key 
technology. It eventually will lead to technology exchange and 
international joint development. Also a wide range of 
applications in other areas such as general purpose helicopters, 
ship navigation support systems, and reduced noise blower are 
said to be possible

  Novel Characterization for Powder Particles in Ceramic Green 
Body. K. Uematsu (Nagaoka University of Technology) 
  A novel method was developed to characterize powder 
particles 
in alumina powder compact. This method consists of the liquid 
immersion technique coupled with polarized microscopy. New 
features found in the green body include huge particles and 
orientation of particles. The significance of these features on 
the subsequent processing and properties of final ceramic is 
discussed. 
  Effect of Pressing Pattern on Deformation of Granule During 
Compaction Process. Y. Zhang, N. Uchida, and K. Uematsu (Nagaoka 
University of Technology) 
  Internal structures of green bodies compacted with spray 
dried alumina powder were examined by a liquid immersion 
technique and SEM. The samples were prepared by uniaxial 
pressing at various pressures and subsequent isostatical 
pressing at 100 MPa. The voids between granules in the green 
body decreased with increasing uniaxial pressure. 
  Temperature Change of Viscosity Characteristics of Silicon 
Nitride Slurry. A. Umino, Y. Zhang, N. Uchida, K. Uematsu 
(Nagaoka University of Technology), and T. Ogata (Toray) 
  The effect of temperature on viscosity of slurry was 
examined 
in this study at various dispersant concentrations. The 
viscosity of slurry decreased with increasing temperature. At 
all temperatures, the minimum viscosities were found in the 
dispersant concentration range of 2.6 to 2.8 wt%. 
  Synthesis of _b_+_b_-Alumina by Reaction Sintering. H. 
Shinya 
and Y. Hirata (Kagoshima U.) 
  Effects of BaTiO[.sub]3[/] addition on phase compositions 
and electrical properties were investigated on 
_b_+_b_-alumina 
prepared by reaction sintering of 
Na[.sub]2[/]O-MgO-Al[.sub]2[/]O[.sub]3[/] at 
1600ë-1620ëC. Addition of BaTiO[.sub]3[/] of 0.1-1 
mol% based on the amount of _a_-Al[.sub]2[/]O[.sub]3[/] 
was effective to produce monolithic _b_ phase without 
decreasing 
significantly the bulk density of _b_-phase. Electrical 
conductivity was lowered by the addition of BaTiO[.sub]3[/]. 
  Control of Pore Diameter of Anatase Porous Ceramics by 
Hydrothermal Hot-Pressing. K. Yanagisawa, M. Sasaki, M. 
Nishioka, K. Ioku, and N. Yamasaki (Fac. Sci., Kochi Univ.) 
  Anatase porous ceramics were prepared from the spherical 
particles of amorphous titania by hydrothermal hot-pressing. 
Pores in the ceramics consisted of large ones corresponding to 
interstices in secondary spherical particles, and small ones to 
those in anatase fine crystals. The large pores vanished at high 
temperature and pressure. The pore diameter distribution was 
controlled by hydrothermal hot-pressing conditions. 
  Preparation of Silica Porous Ceramics by Hydrothermal 
Hot-Pressing -- Microstructure Control and Compressive Strength. 
K. Yanagisawa, M. Nishioka, K. Ioku, and N. Yamasaki (Fac. Sci., 
Kochi Univ.) 
  Porous ceramics were prepared from the commercial silica gel 
consisted of fine spherical particles (diameter: 18 nm) by 
hydrothermal hot-pressing at low temperatures below 300ëC. 
The pore diameter distribution was controlled by hydrothermal 
hot-pressing conditions. The relation between the pore diameter 
distribution and the compressive strength is described. 
  Sintering Behavior of SiC During Hot Pressing. T. Shiroya, 
H. 
Yonezawa, K. Kijima, and T. Tanaka (Kyoto IT) 
  Silicon carbide powders containing 1 wt% carbon and 
0-1 wt% 
boron as additives were hot pressed at 1800-2200ëC under 
20-40 MPa for 1 h in argon atmosphere. Effects of amount of 
additives, sintering temperature, and pressure on sintered 
density were investigated. In this study, only 0.15 wt% 
boron 
additive can promote densification of SiC powder compacts. 
  Fabrication of SiC/C Composite Materials by Employing COPNA 
Resin as a Carbon Source. M. Iio, T. Maekawa, Y. Takao, Y. 
Shimizu, and M. Egashira (Nagasaki University) 
  SiC/C composite materials were fabricated by firing 
SiC/COPNA 
resin or SiC/SiO[.sub]2[/]/COPNA resin mixtures in 
N[.sub]2[/] or Ar atmosphere at temperatures in the range of 
1000 to 2000ëC for 2 h. In the latter system, the 
SiO[.sub]2[/] content in the composite materials decreased 
with increasing firing temperature, and formation of whiskers 
was observed when they were fired at 1300-1500ëC. On the 
other hand, no whiskers were found in the composite materials 
fired above 1800ëC, suggesting the formation of SiC 
particles by the reaction of SiO[.sub]2[/] with COPNA resin, 
and also the potential advantage of COPNA resin in promoting the 
reaction sintering of SiC ceramics. 
  Preparation of Ceramic Fiber/Alumina/Metal Composites by 
Reactive Infiltration Process. K. Inoue, T. Watari, T. Torikai, 
and O. Matsuda (Faculty of Science and Engineering, Saga 
University) 
  Al[.sub]2[/]O[.sub]3[/]/Al and ceramic 
fiber/Al[.sub]2[/]O[.sub]3[/]/Al composites were prepared 
by the infiltration of Al metal into 
Al[.sub]2[/]O[.sub]3[/] or 
Al[.sub]2[/]O[.sub]3[/]/fiber compacts accompanying the 
oxidation of Al metal. It needs the aid of glass to proceed this 
process. The effects of infiltration conditions such as 
temperature, atmosphere, the kinds of glass and porous body, on 
oxidation growth of composite were examined. According to this 
process, a dense ZrO[.sub]2[/] 
fiber/Al[.sub]2[/]O[.sub]3[/]/Al composites could be 
obtained without shrinkage. 
  Synthesis of Zirconia Dried Gel by Metal Alkoxide. Y. 
Shimizu, K. Kobayashi, and M. Koizumi (The University of Ryukoku) 
  Isopropanol solution of zirconium n-butoxide was prepared by 
adding diethanolamine. The prepared solution was hydrolysised to 
form wet gel. Through syneresis process, monolithic zirconia 
dried gel were obtained by the careful heat-treatment. 
  Study of Phases in Rare-Earth Modified Zirconia Synthesized 
by Coprecipitation Process. M. Ozawa and S. Suzuki (Nagoya 
Institute of Technology), C.-K. Loong and J. W. Richardson 
(Argonne National Laboratory, U.S.A.) 
  The crystal structure of rare-earth modified zirconia from 
coprecipitation process were studied by neutron and X-ray 
diffraction technique. A Rietveld analysis of neutron-ray powder 
patterns revealed a tetragonal phase with relaxation of oxygen 
in Zr[.sub]0.9[/]La[.sub]0.1[/]O[.sub]1.95[/] and 
Zr[.sub]0.9[/]Nd[.sub]0.1[/]O[.sub]1.95[/]. 
  Effect of Al-Alkoxide Addition on Sinterability and Strength 
of Zirconia. M. Inaba, Y. Zhang, N. Uchida, K. Uematsu (Nagaoka 
Univ. of Tech.), K. Mori, M. Sumi (Mitsubishi Heavy Industries, 
Ltd.) 
  This study presents the effect of Al-alkoxide addition on 
sinterability and strength of YSZ. The addition of 1-3 
mol% 
Al-alkoxide reduced the sintering temperature by about 100ëC 
and increased the strength by about 80%. 
  Surface Area of CeO[.sub]2[/] Powder Fabricated by Various 
Methods. N. Okumura, A. Akiyama, and Y. Ikuma (Kanagawa I.T.) 
  Cerium oxide powder was fabricated from 
Ce(SO[.sub]4[/])[.sub]2[/] or 
Ce(NO[.sub]3[/])[.sub]3[/] solution to which various kinds 
of organic acids were added. After calcination at 850ëC, the 
powders were characterized by SEM and BET. It was found that for 
Ce(SO[.sub]4[/])[.sub]2[/], dicarboxylic acid was the best 
acid and for Ce(NO[.sub]3[/])[.sub]3[/], aliphatic oxy 
acid was the best. 
  Mesopore Control of Macroporous Silica Gels Having 
Phase-Separated Morphology by Solvent Exchange. K. Kitayama, K. 
Nakanishi, and N. Soga (Faculty of Engineering, Kyoto Univ.) 
  Silica gels having phase-separated interconnected morphology 
in micrometer range have been prepared by hydrolyzing 
alkoxysilane in the presence of poly(ethylene oxide) (PEO). In 
order to modify the structure in nanometer range, solvent 
exchange treatments in various aqueous solutions have been 
performed. When the gels were leached in an aqueous ammonia 
solution, their pore size changed drastically. In basic 
condition, the pore size reached an equilibrium value under 
constant solution pH and temperature. The equilibrium pore size 
increased as solution pH or temperature was raised. 
  Effect of Ultrasound on Ripening of Aluminogels (2). M. 
Katsumoto, N. Enomoto, and Z. Nakagawa (Res. Lab. Engin. Matls., 
TIT) 
  High-power ultrasound was applied to the ripening of 
amorphous aluminogels in aqueous solution. When ultrasonicated 
at a lower power of the sonicator, the crystallization of the 
gels was promoted; while at a higher power crystallization was 
disturbed by ultrasonic treatment. It is thought that the 
dissolution of gels was accelerated and as a result the 
formation of bayerite was promoted by moderate sonication, but 
that the growth of bayerite was suppressed by excessive 
sonication. 
  Effect of Ultrasonic Irradiation on Precipitation of Ti 
Oxalate From Solution (2). Hee-Lack Choi, Naoya Enomoto, and 
Zenbe-e Nakagawa (Res. Lab. Eng. Mater., T.I.T.) 
  Ultrasonic irradiation was applied during the precipitation 
of titanium oxalate in an ethanolic solution of oxalic acid. The 
precipitation reaction was accelerated by ultrasound. In this 
report, for the better understanding of ultrasonic effect on the 
precipitation reaction we examined the reaction product which is 
unidentified. 
  [.sup]27[/]Al NMR Study of the 
Al[.sub]2[/]O[.sub]3[/] Formation Process From Chemically 
Modified Al-Alkoxides. N. Tohge (Kinki University), K. Tadanaga, 
T. Iwami, and T. Minami (Osaka Prefecture University) 
  The formation processes of Al[.sub]2[/]O[.sub]3[/] from 
Al-alkoxide chemically modified with ethylacetoacetate (EAcAc) 
were investigated using [.sup]27[/]Al NMR. [.sup]27[/]Al 
NMR spectra showed that the reaction of EAcAc with 
Al(O-sec-Bu)[.sup]3[/] led to the formation of 
six-coordinated structural units. It was found that many kinds 
of condensed six-coordinated structural units, most of which 
were chelated with EAcAc, were present in the sols after 
hydrolysis. 
  Preparation of Ferrite/Alloy Composite Powders Using Redox 
Reaction. H. Kobayashi, K. Saito, N. Hiratsuka, and T. Mitamura 
(Saitama University) 
  The composite powders of nickel zinc ferrite and nickel-iron 
alloy were prepared from _a_-Fe[.sub]2[/]O[.sub]3[/], 
NiCl[.sub]2[/] and Zn under an Ar gas stream using redox 
reaction. Ni-Fe alloy powder, nickel zinc ferrite powder and 
non-magnetic zinc oxide powder were produced with increasing of 
Zn amount and heating temperature. The lattice constant of the 
ferrite was increased with dissolving Zn into the ferrite. The 
saturation magnetization and coercive force of the composite 
powders prepared were 89.7 emu/g and 78.6 Oe, respectively. 
  Synthesis of MoSi[.sub]2[/] Powder by Carbothermal 
Reduction Process. Y. Ishizaka and J. Hojo (Fac. Eng., Kyushu 
Univ.) 
  MoSi[.sub]2[/] powder was prepared by a carbothermal 
reduction process using MoO[.sub]3[/], quartz and active 
carbon at 1400ëC in Ar + H[.sub]2[/] (50%) atmosphere. 
Excess quartz was needed to produce MoSi[.sub]2[/] single 
phase without lower silicides (Mo[.sub]5[/]Si[.sub]3[/], 
Mo[.sub]5[/]Si[.sub]3[/]C). After treated with HF 
solution, the powder was 0.5-2 æm in size. 
MoSi[.sub]2[/]-SiC composite powder was also obtained by 
adjusting an excess of quartz and active carbon. 
  Synthesis of Organic Derivatives of Zirconium Phosphate by a 
New-Developed Interlayer Amidation Method. T. Kijima, S. 
Watanabe, and M. Machida (Miyazaki University) 
  A new approach to organic derivatives of zirconium phosphate 
through interlayer amidation was applied to the zirconium 
carboxyethylphosphonate-alkyldiamines and -alkylmonoamines 
systems and the applicability to both systems is discussed. 
  Synthesis and Structure of a New Layered Aluminum-Containing 
Vanadium Oxide 
(Al[.sub]x[/]V[.sub]1-x[/])[.sub]2[/]O[.sub]5-4x[/](OH)[.sub]4x[/] 
. 
Y. Oka, T. Yao, and N. Yamamoto (Kyoto U.) 
  A new vanadium oxide with a layered structure was 
hydrothermally synthesized. The composition of the compound was 
found to be 
(Al[.sub]x[/]V[.sub]1-x[/])[.sub]2[/]O[.sub]5-4x[/](OH)[.sub]4x[/] 

and the X-ray Rietveld analysis revealed the double-sheet 
structure of the M[.sub]2[/]O[.sub]5[/] layer (M = V, Al) 
analogous to those of the layered hydrated vanadium oxides. The 
layers are held by hydrogen bonds. 
  Preparation, Structure and Intercalation of Chalcogenides 
With Layered Composite Crystal Structures. Y. Oosawa, Y. Gotoh, 
J. Akimoto, M. Sohma, H. Hayakawa (NIMCR), and M. Onoda (NIRIM) 
  Three kinds of selenides with layered composite crystal 
structures are formed in Pb-Nb-Se system: (PbSe)1.14(NbSe2)m 
([A] for m = 1, [B] for m = 2, [C] for m = 3). Dependence of the 
product species on the preparation temperature and composition 
has been investigated. Rietvelt analyses of [B], [C] and their 
N2H4.H20 intercalation compounds with 0 0 L diffraction profile 
have been carried out to determine the atomic coordinates in the 
layer-stacking direction. Two new selenides have been found in 
the Pb-Ti-Se system. 
  Effect of Neutron Irradiation on Knoop Microhardness of 
MgO-3Al[.sub]2[/]O[.sub]3[/] Single Crystal. T. Yano, M. 
Ikari (Res. Lab. Nucl. Reactors, TIT), and T. Iseki (Dept. 
Inorg. Mater., TIT) 
  The Knoop microhardness of several orientations on the (100) 
surface of neutron irradiated and unirradiated 
MgO-3Al[.sub]2[/]O[.sub]3[/] single crystals were 
measured. It was confirmed that the Knoop microhardness of the 
MgO-3Al[.sub]2[/]O[.sub]3[/] single crystal was hardened 
by about 4-14% by the neutron irradiation. Both of the 
(111) 
&lt;110&gt;  and the (110) &lt;110&gt;  slip systems 
are simultaneously active in the unirradiated crystal, however, 
in the neutron irradiated crystal, the (111) &lt;110&gt; 
should be the dominant slip system. 
  Preparation and Properties of Si Doped 
Al[.sub]x[/]Cu[.sub]y[/]B[.sub]105[/] Crystals. Shigeru 
Okada, Tuyoshi Nakayama, Kunio Kudou, Kenya Hamano (Kanagawa 
University), and Torsten Lundstrom (Uppsala University) 
  Si doped Al[.sub]x[/]Cu[.sub]y[/]B[.sub]105[/] 
crystals were prepared by the reaction between aluminium, 
silicon and boron powders using a molten copper flux under an 
argon atmosphere. As-grown Si doped 
Al[.sub]x[/]Cu[.sub]y[/]B[.sub]105[/] crystals were 
used for the study of measurements of density and unit cell 
dimensions. The largest crystals prepared have the maximum 
dimensions of about 2.88mm x 2.20mm x 2.16mm. 
  Hedvall Effect of Al[.sub]2[/]O[.sub]3[/] on Sintering 
Behavior of (Co,Ni)O. A. Nakajima and H. Segawa (Nikko Kyodo 
Co., Ltd.) 
  Effect of Al[.sub]2[/]O[.sub]3[/] addition on sintering 
of (Co,Ni)O was investigated. Starting 
Al[.sub]2[/]O[.sub]3[/] had amorphous phase, and it 
accelerated densification of (Co,Ni)O by making solid solution 
at the temperature of its crystallization. This acceleration was 
considered to be caused by increasing diffusion constant as a 
result of crystallization of Al[.sub]2[/]O[.sub]3[/] 
subsequent to increasing the amount of making solid solution. 
  The Effect of ZrO[.sub]2[/] Addition on NiO-CoO Solid 
Solution. R. Suzuki, H. Nakamura, and H. Segawa (Nikko Kyodo 
Co., Ltd.) 
  Relationship between density, microstructure of sintered 
body 
and the amount of added ZrO[.sub]2[/] was investigated. As a 
result of this investigation, when the amount of added 
ZrO[.sub]2[/] was 3 to 4 wt%, the density of sintered body 
was the maximum and the sintered body added 0.2 wt% 
Al[.sub]2[/]O[.sub]3[/] had higher density. Average grain 
size decreased with increasing the amount of added 
ZrO[.sub]2[/]. 
  Synthesis of Al[.sub]2[/]TiO[.sub]5[/] System Powder 
and Its Sinterability. S. Tanaka (Tosoh Co.), S. Nagashima and 
A. Kato (Kyushu University) 
  An Al[.sub]2[/]O[.sub]3[/]-Y[.sub]2[/]O[.sub]3[/] 
hydrate-coated TiO[.sub]2[/] powder was synthesized by a 
homogeneous precipitation technique and its sinterability was 
studied. Densities of sintered bodies increased in calcination 
temperature (800-1350ëC) and sintering temperature 
(1400-1500ëC). Crystalline phase in sintered bodies were 
Al[.sub]2[/]TiO[.sub]5[/], 
_a_-Al[.sub]2[/]O[.sub]3[/], 
Y[.sub]2[/]Ti[.sub]2[/]O[.sub]7[/]. Effect of stirring 
rate during synthesis of powder on morphology and sinterability 
of product was also studied. 
  Preparation and Sintering Behavior of Alumina-Coated 
SiC(w,p). H. Nakamura, K. Naito, M. Yoshinaga, and A. Kato 
(Faculty of Engineering, Kyushu Univ.) 
  Preparation of alumina-coated SiC whiskers or SiC particles 
and their sinterability were studied. Stirring rate during 
coating gives a marked effect on morphology of precipitate. 
Stirring rate required for preparation of coalescence-free 
coated body depends on the volume of reacting solution. Use of 
alumina-coated SiC powder for sintering improved the 
distribution of SiC in Al[.sub]2[/]O[.sub]3[/], indicating 
that coated particles were useful for good distribution of 
dispersed phase in matrix phase. 
  Effect of SiO[.sub]2[/] Addition on the Synthesis and 
Sinterability of Mg-Al Spinel. Insuk Yi, Naoya Enomoto, and 
Zenbe-e Nakagawa (Res. Lab. Eng. Mat., TIT) 
  The sinterability of Mg-Al spinel doped with SiO[.sub]2[/] 
have been studied by X-ray diffractometry and Scanning Electron 
microscope. The addition of SiO[.sub]2[/] remarkably decrease 
the porosity of the specimens sintered at 1500ëC for 2 h. 
This is due to the formation of liquid phase such as cordierite 
etc. during densifying. 
  Effect of Impurities Addition on the Phase Change in 
Li[.sub]2[/]Ti[.sub]3[/]O[.sub]7[/]. D. Tsubone, K. 
Igarashi, and T. Shimizu (Chiba Institute of Technology) 
  Sb[.sub]2[/]O[.sub]5[/]-added R (ramsdellite) phase was 
synthesized by the melt-quenching method. The phase changes in 
the Sb[.sub]2[/]O[.sub]5[/]-added R phase occurred 
similarly to the non-added R phase following the route 
quenched-R H (hexagonal phase) S+r (spinel and rutile) 
R. But addition of Sb[.sub]2[/]O[.sub]5[/] retarded 
the H S+r successive decomposition reaction and stabilized 
the H phase at high temperatures.

and 
Its Some Properties. Suguru Tashiro, Tsutomu Mashimo (Kumamoto 
University), Katsuyoshi Oh-ishi, Yasuhiko Syono (Tohoku 
University) 
  Shock compression recovery experiments of the porous sample 
of tantalum nitride with a hexagonal structure (CoSn-type) were 
performed in the impact velocity range up to 1.5 km/s to 
synthesis B1-type tantalum nitride. Almost single phase B1-type 
tantalum nitride bulk body was prepared by shock compression. 
The lattice parameter of the shock synthesized B1-type phase was 
determined to be a[.sub]0[/] = 0.43363+(1) nm. The chemical 
formula was estimated to be TaN[.sub]0.96-0.99[/] by the 
instrumental chemical analysis. 
  Coloration Due to Ni[.sup]2+[/] in CaO Matrix. T. 
Nakashima, N. Motohira, Y. Nakamura, and H. Yanagida (Fac. of 
Eng., Univ. of Tokyo) 
  Characteristic coloration is observed on 
Ca[.sub]x[/]Ni[.sub]1-x[/]O (0.95 &lt; x &lt; 0.98) sintered 
at higher temperatures. Their coloration shows variation with 
NiO content and absorption at 490 nm decreased and 420,640 nm 
appeared with increasing NiO content. From ESR spectra 
coordination number of Ni[.sup]2+[/] is judged to vary from 
stable six coordination into characteristic. 
  Sinterability and Oxygen Semipermeability of the Sintered 
Bodies From La[.sub]0.6[/]Sr[.sub]0.4[/]CoO[.sub]3[/] 
Powder. Y. Mutoh and T. Sakamoto (Fukuoka Ind. T. Center) K. 
Morinaga and N. Yamazoe (Graduate School of Engineering 
Sciences, Kyusyu Univ.) 
  La[.sub]0.6[/]Sr[.sub]0.4[/]CoO[.sub]3[/] powder 
prepared by the thermal decomposition of acetic acids was 
calcinated at 800-1100ëC and grinded for 1 day or 7 days in 
ball mill. Particle size distribution of the powder grinded for 
7 days was indepented [as published] of calcination temperature. 
Relative density of 1200-1400ëC sintered bodies fabricated 
from the powders calcinated at 900-1100ëC was 
97-100%. The 
relationship between the grain size of the sintered bodies and 
oxygen permeability was discussed. 
  The Effect of Dispersing Medium on Mechanical Properties of 
Al[.sub]2[/]O[.sub]3[/]. H. Kitayama, A. Nakahira, and K. 
Niihara (ISIR, Osaka University) 
  By milling in organic medium, organic species were adsorbed 
on oxide powder surface. Effects of these organic species on the 
sintering process were investigated. Microstructural observation 
revealed that the adsorbed species had effects on the 
microstructure of Al[.sub]2[/]O[.sub]3[/]. Variations of 
some mechanical properties with the adsorbed species will be 
discussed. 
  Effect of Microstructure on Mechanical Properties of 
Al[.sub]2[/]O[.sub]3[/] Ceramics. T. Koyama, A. Nishiyama 
(Mitsubishi Materials), and K. Niihara (Osaka University) 
  Bending strength, fracture toughness, fracture energy and 
crack extension resistance were evaluated for 
Al[.sub]2[/]O[.sub]3[/] ceramics with equi-axed and 
platelet grains. The bending strength decreased and the fracture 
toughness (SEPB) increased with an increase in the grain size 
for Al[.sub]2[/]O[.sub]3[/] ceramics with equi-axed and 
platelet grains, but the ceramics with platelet grains had 
higher toughness and the maximum value was 6.6 MPa 
m[.sup]1/2[/]. 
  Fabrication of Functionally Gradient Ceramics by Planetary 
Slip Casting. H. Kobayashi (College of Industrial Technology) 
  Functionally gradient Al[.sub]2[/]O[.sub]3[/] having 
different particle sizes and 
Al[.sub]2[/]O[.sub]3[/]-ZrSiO[.sub]4[/] pipe ceramics 
were fabricated in plaster molds by the planetary slip casting 
method. The molds set on a disk revolved both round its axis and 
on their axis. The functionally structures were controlled by 
changing the casting time of each slurry during green forming 
and the revolutions per minute of molds. 
  Study on Mullite-Zircon Composite Materials (Part 1). K. 
Hamano and U. Yanagida (Kanagawa U.) 
  From mixture of kaolin and zirconia, zircon began to form at 
around the temperature of transformation of 
monoclinic-tetragonal zirconia. So mullite-zircon composite 
materials could be prepared from the mixtures of kaolin, alumina 
and zirconia. The maximum amount of zircon formation can be 
obtained at about 1500ëC, and at higher the zircon was 
decomposed. Mechanical properties of the composites were 
improved with increase of ``nominal content of zircon,'' i.e., 
zirconia addition and raising their firing temperature up to 
about 1500ëC, and further their thermal expansion 
coefficient was a little lowered with increase of ``the nominal 
content of zircon.'' 
  Aluminium Titanate Formation From Mixtures of Corundum and 
Rutile. A. Kamezaki, K. Hamano, and S. Okada (Dept. of Appl. 
Chem., Faculty of Engineering, Kanagawa U.) 
  Aluminium titanate (AT) formation between fine corundum 
powder and coarse rutile single crystals, or fine rutile powder 
and coarse corundum single crystals were observed. AT layer was 
formed inside of rutile phase, and grew with holding time up to 
about 8 hours, and then rate of the growth decreased. From the 
result of polarization microscope observation, a part of the AT 
layer was formed with parallel orientated AT grains of 10 
æm-20 æm in size. 
  Formation and Properties of Ln-Si-O-N Glasses. M. Ohashi, K. 
Nakamura, K. Hirao, and S. Kanzaki (GIRIN) 
  The homogeneous Y-Si-O-N glasses containing nitrogen atoms 
of 
15 or 20 eq% were prepared from the compositions in the 
vicinity of the eutectic point which has the lowest temperature 
in those on SiO[.sub]2[/]-Y[.sub]2[/]O[.sub]3[/] phase 
diagram. The density, the elastic moduli and the glass 
transition temperature of the glasses increased with 
incorporation of N. The coefficient of thermal expansion, the 
density, the elastic moduli and the transition temperature 
increased with Y content. Furthermore, the effect of cationic 
field strength on properties of Ln-Si-O-N glasses (where Ln = 
lanthanides or Y) was investigated. 
  Preparation of Cordierite Film for the Substrate of 
Electronic Circuit by the Sol-Gel Process. K. Etou, T. Sei, and 
T. Tsuchiya (Faculty of Industrial Science and Technology, 
Science University of Tokyo) 
  The preparation of cordierite thin films was investigated by 
the sol-gel process. The coordination number of Al was analyzed 
by NMR measurement due to the used solvent effect. 
  Hot Compaction of PSZ Powder Utilizing Underwater-Shock 
Wave. 
R. Tomoshige (Kumamoto Institute of Technology), Y. Kakoki, K. 
Imamura, M. Nishida, and A. Chiba (Kumamoto University) 
  Partially stabilized zirconia (PSZ) powder was hot-compacted 
by using underwater-shock wave. The obtained compacts were 
heat-treated at 1473 to 1873 K for 5 h. The compacts and 
heat-treated ones were investigated by hardness and fracture 
toughness tests and electron microscopy. Our experimental 
results are summarized as follows: (1) The compacts heat-treated 
above 1673 K showed higher hardness values than commercial 
products. (2) Fracture toughness value of 12.0 MPa 
(m)[.sup]1/2[/] was observed in the compacts heat-treated at 
1673 K. 
  Slip Casting of Silicon Nitride and Mechanical Properties of 
Sintered Body (Part 5). S. Sano, K. Oda, Y. Shibasaki (GIRIN), 
and K. Ohshima (Toshiba Ceramics) 
  The slip casting of silicon nitride was studied to develop a 
complicated shape forming method for the fabrication of 
Si[.sub]3[/]N[.sub]4[/] engineering ceramics. In this 
study, Si[.sub]3[/]N[.sub]4[/] produced by silica 
reduction was used as the starting powder. From the slurry 
containing 75 wt% solid, a high density green body (2.03 
g/cm[.sup]3[/]) was obtained. The 
Si[.sub]3[/]N[.sub]4[/] sintered at 1775ëC for 10 h at 
0.9 MPa N[.sub]2[/] pressure showed high flexural strength of 
about 1 GPa. 
  Microstructural Control of _b_-Si[.sub]3[/]N[.sub]4[/] 
by Addition of _b_-Si[.sub]3[/]N[.sub]4[/] Seeds. N. 
Hirosaki, Y. Okamoto, Y. Akimune (Nissan Motor Co., Ltd.), and 
M. Mitomo (NIRIM) 
  Microstructural development during liquid-phase sintering of 
fine _b_-Si[.sub]3[/]N[.sub]4[/] powder containing large 
_b_ particles was studied. The large grains acted as seeds for 
grain growth and in-situ composite microstructure containing 
size-controlled large grains was obtained. 
  Si[.sub]3[/]N[.sub]4[/] Compact Prepared by Spark 
Plasma Sintering. M. Omori, A. Okubo, and T. Hirai (IMR Tohoku 
University) 
  Y[.sub]4[/]Al[.sub]2[/]O[.sub]9[/] is the compound 
with martensitic transformation. To synthesize a toughened 
ceramic like zirconia, the growth of grains was depressed using 
a spark plasma sintering equipment. 
Si[.sub]3[/]N[.sub]4[/] reacted with 
Y[.sub]4[/]Al[.sub]2[/]O[.sub]9[/], so the strength and 
toughness was decreased. The grain size of 
Si[.sub]3[/]N[.sub]4[/] was controlled under 250 æm and 
good for the toughness. It is necessary to suppress the reaction. 
  Dual Phase Sialon (9). Sintering Reaction Between 
Y-_a_'-Sialon and _a_-Si[.sub]3[/]N[.sub]4[/]. Y. Ukyo and 
S. Wada (Toyota Central Research and Development Labs. Inc.) 
  Sintering reaction between Y-_a_'-sialon and 
_a_-Si[.sub]3[/]N[.sub]4[/] was investigated by 
hot-pressing the mixtures of _a_-Si[.sub]3[/]N[.sub]4[/] 
powders containing various amount of Y-_a_'-sialon. Shrinkage 
proceeded rapidly above 1600ëC and amount of Y-_a_'-sialon 
in starting powders did not affect the shrinkage behavior. No 
other phase was formed during sintering. Sintered bodies were 
composed of _b_'-sialon and Y-_a_'-sialon of which solid 
solubility was lower than that of starting powders. 
  Sintering of Ground BN Powders From a Different Starting 
Material. T. Hagio and Y. Yoshida (Government Industrial 
Research Institute, Kyusyu) 
  BN ceramics were fabricated by normal sintering method using 
various BN powders which were obtained by heating a synthesized 
BN powder at a different temperature. The powders alone were 
hard to sinter with a large free expansion. The grinding alters 
BN powder to make its consolidated compact strong on heat 
treatment. Relatively dense BN ceramics was obtained from the 
ground powder of well-crystallized BN. 
  Slip Casting of Al[.sub]2[/]O[.sub]3[/]-W Continuous 
Functionally Gradient Material. M. Hidaka, H. Takebe, K. 
Morinaga (Department of Materials Science and Technology, 
Graduate School of Engineering Sciences, Kyushu University), J. 
Chu, K. Hayashi (TOTO Ltd.) 
  A continuous functionally gradient material was produced 
using slip casting method. The difference of the sedimentary 
velocity of particles within a slip due to the density 
difference among the species and the size difference among the 
particles were used to obtain a body with gradually distributed 
Al[.sub]2[/]O[.sub]3[/] and W contents. Compositional 
gradient within this type of samples were examined by electron 
probe microanalysis. 
  Properties of SiC-BN Nanocomposites and Effect of 
TiB[.sub]2[/]-Addition. N. Oyama, J. Hojo (Fac. Eng., Kyushu 
Univ.), K. Kishi, S. Umebayashi (Gov. Ind. Res. Inst. Kyushu) 
  SiC-BN nanocomposites were produced by hot-pressing of the 
fine composite powder. The nanocomposites showed a remarkable 
improvement of thermal shock resistance compared with 
conventional SiC-BN composites produced from the mixed powder. 
However, the fracture toughness was reduced. The addition of 
TiB[.sub]2[/] particles to SiC-BN nanocomposite increased the 
fracture toughness without a serious decrease in thermal shock 
resistance. 
  Strengthening of Si[.sub]3[/]N[.sub]4[/] Matrix 
Composites by the Addition of SiC Particles. T. Hirano, A. 
Nakahira, and K. Niihara (ISIR, Osaka University) 
  Si[.sub]3[/]N[.sub]4[/] matrix composites reinforced by 
5 vol% of SiC particles having different particle sizes 
were 
fabricated using the hot-pressing technique. The average 
particle size of added SiC particles were 3.50, 1.26, 0.27, 0.15 
and 0.04 æm respectively. The mechanical properties and 
microstructure of these composites were investigated. The 
relative density was slightly increased, on increasing the size 
of added SiC particles. The maximum average strength of these 
composites was 1.3 GPa after the addition of SiC particles 
having an average particle size of 0.27 æm. Beside 0.04 
æm 
SiC addition, the fracture toughness were independent of the 
size of added SiC particles. 
  Mechanical Properties and Processing of 
Al[.sub]2[/]O[.sub]3[/]-SiC-YAG Composites by Formation of 
YAG Phase. B. K. Jang (U. Tokyo), M. Enoki and T. Kishi (RCAST, 
U. Tokyo) 
  Al[.sub]2[/]O[.sub]3[/]/SiC/YAG hybrid composite were 
fabricated by hot-pressing. The grain size of 
Al[.sub]2[/]O[.sub]3[/] monolith increased with increasing 
sintering temperature and sintering time, while that of 
Al[.sub]2[/]O[.sub]3[/]-SiC-YAG composites was effectively 
restrained due to the incorporation of YAG and SiC particulates 
into alumina matrix. The mechanical properties, such as bending 
strength and fracture toughness of 
Al[.sub]2[/]O[.sub]3[/]-SiC-YAG composites were higher 
than that of alumina monolith. 
  Study of Self-Reinforced Behavior of Silicon Nitride 
Ceramics 
by Reaction Bonding Methods. Yoshiyuki Yasutomi, Motoyuki 
Miyata, and Shigeru Kikuchi (Hitachi Res. Lab., Hitachi, Ltd.) 
  The nitridation mechanism depends on the Si powder size. In 
case of fine Si powder, the Si[.sub]3[/]N[.sub]4[/] grains 
corresponds to size of original Si particles, which was produced 
by nitrogen diffusion in the Si particles. On the other hand, in 
case of large Si powder, long elongated 
Si[.sub]3[/]N[.sub]4[/] grains are produced in the 
nitrided body by vapor-liquid-solid reaction route. In this 
study, microstructure control of Si[.sub]3[/]N[.sub]4[/] 
ceramics by using reaction bonding method with mixtures of the 
two type Si powder is discussed. The effect of controlling the 
Si powder size on mechanical properties of reaction bonded 
Si[.sub]3[/]N[.sub]4[/] ceramics was investigated. 
  Fabrication and Mechanical Properties of Zirconia/Alumina 
Whisker Composites. N. Tamari, T. Tanaka, and I. Kondoh (GIRI, 
Osaka) 
  On the fabrication of zirconia/alumina whisker composites 
using hot-pressing, although little improvement of bending 
strengths was observed, fracture toughness became higher by 
replacing zirconia containing 3 mol% yttria with zirconia 
containing 2 mol% yttria. The technique of spark plasma 
sintering brought on dense zirconia/alumina whisker composites 
at lower temperature than hot-pressing and the composites with 
higher bending strengths and fracture toughness than hot-pressed 
bodies. 
  Silicon Carbide Fiber Reinforced Si-N Composites Prepared by 
Polysilazane Impregnation Method (1). H. Morozumi, K. Sato, A. 
Tezuka, H. Kaya, and T. Isoda (TONEN Corporation) 
  High strength silicon carbide fiber reinforced Si-N 
composites (-307 MPa) were obtained by applying polysilazane 
impregnation and pyrolysis method to a plain weave stacked 
prepreg. These 2D composites showed the same effectiveness as 
carbon fiber reinforced Si-N composites. 
  Influence of Fiber-Sheet Distance on the Mechanical 
Properties of SiC Fiber Reinforced SiAlON. Ueno Kazuo, Inoue 
Takahiro (GIRI, Osaka), Teremoto Naohiro (Osaka Elect. Commun. 
Univ., Undergraduate School) 
  SiAlON composite reinforced with CVD SiC fiber was 
fabricated 
from the alternative stacking of matrix green and SiC fiber 
sheet with different distance between the fiber sheet, by 
hot-pressing at 1500ëC under the N[.sub]2[/] pressure of 
0.2 MPa for 30 min. Full-dense composite contains the fiber 
sheets with the distance of 0.56-1.0mm. Ambient temperature 
bending strength of the composite (ca. 350 MPa) is comparative 
with that of monolithic SiAlON, but high temperature strength at 
1000ëC is improved. The composite having the fiber sheet 
distance of 0.67mm shows the highest value of the 
work-of-fracture, that is, ca. 2100 J/m[.sup]2[/] among other 
composites, that is far bigger than the value of monolithic, 100 
J/m[.sup]2[/]. 
  Synthesis of Glass/Alumina Composite by Crystallization of 
Corundum. A. Matsumoto and T. Nishikawa (TOTO Ltd.) 
  Alumina dispersed glass composite was synthesized by 
corundum 
crystallization from glass matrix. The composite was prepared by 
firing sericite or kaolinite-nepherine syenite, all of which are 
cheap natural products. Corundum grew as hexagonal plate 
crystals dispersed so uniformly that can't be expected by 
alumina premixing method. 
  Colloidal Processing of New Zealand Kaolin. Yuji Higashi and 
Yoshihiro Hirata (Kagoshima Univ.) 
  New Zealand kaolin and alumina woven fabrics were formed 
into 
laminated composites (57 vol% woven fabrics) by doctor 
blade 
method of aqueous suspensions containing polyacrylic ammonium 
and methyl cellulose at pH 8. The green composites were 
hot-pressed to 86.3% theoretical density at 1350ëC 
for 1 hr 
at 39 MPa in a N[.sub]2[/] atmosphere. 
  Synthesis of Bismuth Oxide-Clay Composites by an 
Intercalation. T. Endo, T. Izumitani, H. Takizawa, M. Shimada 
(Tohoku Univ.), and S. Shin (Nat. Inst. Mater. Chem. Res.) 
  Bismuth oxide-clay composites were prepared by the 
intercalation of polynuclear species such as 
Bi[.sub]6[/]O[.sub]4[/](OH)[.sub]8[/][.sup]2+[/] 
etc. formed as a result of hydrolysis of 
4BiNO[.sub]3[/](OH)[.sub]2[/]BiO(OH) in distilled water at 
95ëC. The basal plane of the resulting composite was in the 
range of 16-32 A depending on the concentration of Bi-species. 
On calcining below 400ëC, the surface area was about 180 
m[.sup]2[/]/g for the 16A-composite and 10 m[.sup]2[/]/g 
for the 32A-composite, respectively. This result was perhaps 
responsible for the different stratification of Bi-species. 
  Mechanical Properties of Cement Paste Dispersed Graphite 
Particles. T. Nishikawa, C. Ishikawa, and M. Takatsu (NIT) 
  Compressive, bending strength or fracture toughness of 
cement 
pastes dispersed the non-reactive graphite particles was 
investigated. The addition of graphite caused the increase of 
bending strength, but the decrease of compressive strength. The 
results were discussed according to the fracture energy and the 
crack propagation. 
  Synthesis of Inorganic-Organic Hybrid Materials Using a 
Silicate Cluster. I. Hasegawa, M. Ishida, and S. Motojima (Gifu 
University) 
  A new type of inorganic-organic hybrid materials have been 
synthesized by the reaction of a silicate cluster with the 
double four-membered ring structure 
(Si[.sub]8[/]O[.sub]20[/][.sup]8-[/]) and 
dimethyldichlorosilane in 2.2-dimethoxypropane. IR and 
solid-state CP MAS [.sup]29[/]Si NMR spectroscopies of solid 
products indicated that the products are composed of the 
Si[.sub]8[/]O[.sub]20[/][.sup]8-[/] structure as a 
building unit which is linked by 
(CH[.sub]3[/])[.sub]2[/]Si units. The products were 
thermally stable up to 370ëC in air and increased in 
specific surface area by heating at 300ëC. 
  Preparation of Screen Printing Inks With Oxide Phosphors. S. 
Tsutsumi (Fuji Seisakusho Co., Ltd.), N. Sakamoto (Fukuoka Ind. 
Tech. Center), and K. Muraoka (Graduate School of Engineering 
Sciences, Kyushu Univ.) 
  Viscosity control of high concentrated suspensions was 
studied to establish a preparation guide of screen printing ink 
with oxide phosphors. Flow curves (relationship bet. shear rate 
and shear stress) of ink samples were approximated with an 
equation _ee_ = k[.sup]-1[/]_s_[.sup]1-n[/], where _ee_, k, 
_s_ and n were apparent viscosity, viscosity index, shear 
stress 
and flow index, respectively. It was found that n was useful and 
simple parameter to control viscosities of screen printing inks. 
  Preparation of 
Pb(Ni[.sub]1/3[/]Nb[.sub]2/3[/])O[.sub]3[/] Thin Films 
by Sol-Gel Method. S. Yoneda, S. Takahashi, and M. Kuwabara 
(Kyushu IT) 
  Pb(Ni[.sub]1/3[/]Nb[.sub]2/3[/])O[.sub]3[/] thin 
films were prepared on BaPbO[.sub]3[/] substrates by sol-gel 
method. The perovskite phase was formed in the films by firing 
at 600ëC, while in the form of powder firing at 900ëC 
was required to yield the perovskite phase. It has been 
confirmed that the use of BaPbO[.sub]3[/] having a perovskite 
structure as a substrate was effective to lower the temperature 
of the Pb(Ni[.sub]1/3[/]Nb[.sub]2/3[/])O[.sub]3[/] 
perovskite phase. 
  Preparation and Optical Properties of 
TiO[.sub]2[/]-SiO[.sub]2[/] Coatings by the Sol-Gel 
Process. Chii-Shyang Hwang and Chou Wen-Chung (National Cheng 
Kung University) 
  TiO[.sub]2[/]-SiO[.sub]2[/] optical films were prepared 
by the dip-coating via modified hydrolysis of Ti &amp; Si 
alkoxides. 
The film thickness, microstructures and the properties of films 
were investigated, by the various process parameters including 
composition and viscosity of solution, withdrawing speed of 
substrate, heat treatment condition. 
  Preparation of Transparent and Conductive Cadmium Stannate 
Thin Films by Sol-Gel Method. T. Furusaki, S. Azuma, J. 
Takahashi, and K. Kodaira (Hokkaido University) 
  Transparent and conductive Cd[.sub]2[/]SnO[.sub]4[/] 
thin films were prepared on fused silica substrates at 
550ë-750ëC in a covered crucible by sol-gel method. The 
films were smooth and were strongly adhesive to a substrate. The 
thickness of the films was 100 nm. 
  Synthesis and Characterization of Amorphous 
LiNbO[.sub]3[/] Particles Derived From Metal Alkoxides. S. 
Ono, Y. Nishi, and H. Mochizuki (Nagoya Municipal Industrial 
Research Institute) 
  Amorphous LiNbO[.sub]3[/] particles can be produced from 
the dehydration of LiNb(OH)[.sub]6[/] particles by 
heat-treatment at 200ëC for 2 h. LiNb(OH)[.sub]6[/] 
particles precipitate by hydrolyzing the lithium and niobium 
double alkoxides solutions under the controlled H[.sub]2[/]O 
concentration in the range of 
Rw(H[.sub]2[/]O/LiNb(OEt)[.sub]6[/])4.0-7.5. Particles 
radii varied from 40 nm to 100 nm with increasing the 
H[.sub]2[/]O concentrations and showed narrow size 
distributions. 
  Preparation and Crystallization of Fine Alkoxide-Derived 
Mullite/SiC or Mullite/Si[.sub]3[/]N[.sub]4[/] Composite 
Precursor Powders. H. Suzuki, H. Nishiuti (Toyota Technological 
Institute), and H. Kamiya (Tokyo University of Agriculture and 
Technology) 
  Fine composite precursor powders of mullite/SiC or 
mullite/Si[.sub]3[/]N[.sub]4[/] were prepared by 
spray-drying the precursor solutions with uniformly dispersed 
SiC ultra-fine powders or Si[.sub]3[/]N[.sub]4[/] 
whiskers. This novel process will allow distribution of SiC or 
Si[.sub]3[/]N[.sub]4[/] in the raw powders, leading to the 
high-performance composite ceramics by sintering these precursor 
powders. This paper describes the morphology and crystallization 
behavior of composite precursor powders prepared by this novel 
process. Si[.sub]3[/]N[.sub]4[/] reacted at relatively low 
temperature with mullite precursor in the ambient atmosphere, 
whereas SiC did not react after crystallization of orthorhombic 
mullite. The results showed that the composite ceramics with 
very uniform structure or nanosize-composites can be prepared by

  Effect of Prehydrolysis on the Structure of a Complex 
Alkoxide as a Cordierite Precursor and Their Crystallization 
Behavior. T. Fukui (Krosaki Co.), C. Sakurai (Nippon Steel Co.), 
and M. Okuyama (NGK Spark Plug Co., Ltd.) 
  The complex alkoxides as cordierite precursors were 
synthesized by reactions of prehydrolyzed TEOSs with Al and Mg 
alkoxides, and effect of prehydrolysis on an alkoxide structure 
was analyzed by IR, [.sup]27[/]Al- and [.sup]29[/]Si-NMR 
spectroscopies. The crystallization of the resultant gels from 
the complex alkoxides was also studied, and a relation between 
the alkoxide structure and the crystallization was considered. 
When water ratio to TEOS (H[.sub]2[/]O/TEOS) of prehydrolysis 
is &lt;1.2, the (EtO)[.sub]3[/]Si-Al = structure in the complex 
alkoxide increases with increasing water ratio. When 
H[.sub]2[/]O/TEOS is &gt; 1.2, the condensation degree of 
aluminosilicate skeleton (-(Si-O-Al)[.sub]n[/]-) increases 
with increasing water ratio. Mg alkoxide coordinates to the Al 
atom in aluminosilicate regardless of water ratio of 
prehydrolysis. For a temperature at the low end of the range for 
formation of _a_-cordierite, increasing the water ratio of 
prehydrolysis is effective under these hydrolysis conditions, 
because a larger number of Si-O-Al bondings are introduced into 
the Mg-Al-Si complex alkoxides. 
  Effects of Seeding on Phase Transformation and Microcracking 
in Complex-Alkoxide-Derived Cordierite. M. Okuyama (NGK Spark 
Plug), T. Fukui (Kurosaki Refractory), and C. Sakurai (Nippon 
Steel) 
  Cordierite gel powder prepared by the hydrolysis of an 
alkoxide-complex was seeded with crystalline _a_-cordierite 
particles. The seeding appeared to promote a direct formation of 
the _a_-cordierite from the amorphous state. The development of 
microcracks due to æ-_a_ cordierite transformation could be 
prevented by the modified crystallization behavior, resulting in 
the improved flexural strength of _a_-cordierite of 190 MPa. 
The 
seeding also lowered the crystallization temperatures of 
_a_-cordierite to 900ëC, which could be attributed to the 
epitaxial crystallization of the chemically homogeneous mother 
powder.

Precursor. Y. Saitoh, Y. Sugahara, and K. Kuroda (Waseda 
University) 
  The pyrolysis of an AlN precursor, 
poly(isopropyliminoalane), 
was investigated by means of TG-MS and TG-GCMS. The major weight 
loss occurred between 220ëC and 540ëC. Compounds 
containing aluminium and hydrocarbons were detected in the 
temperature range 220-320ëC and 320-540ëC, respectively.

Monolayer Useful for Designing Functional Films. K. Umeda, K. 
Kawanabe, Y. Takao, Y. Shimizu, and M. Egashira (Nagasaki 
University) 
  Attempts were made to develop fabrication technique of a 
monolayer consisting of uniform and spherical SiO[.sub]2[/] 
fine particles. Dehydration-condensation reactions between 
surface hydroxyl groups on a Si substrate and carboxyl groups in 
a dicarboxylic acid film prepared on the substrate by the 
Langmuir-Brodgett process, followed by the same reactions 
between surface hydroxyl groups on SiO[.sub]2[/] particles 
and carboxyl groups at the opposite side of the film, enabled us 
to fabricate a monolayer of SiO[.sub]2[/] particles tightly 
bonded to the substrate. In addition, it was revealed that 
pretreatment of SiO[.sub]2[/] particles with boric acid was 
indispensable for fabricating a closed packing monolayer. 
  Patterning of Oxide Thin Films by the Photolysis of 
Chemically Modified Metal-Alkoxides. N. Tohge (Kinki U.), K. 
Shinmou and T. Minami (Osaka Pref. U.) 
  UV irradiation on the gel films prepared from Zr or 
Ti-alkoxides modified with _b_-diketone dissociated the chelate 
bonds in the films and made the gel films insoluble in leaching 
solutions. Based on these changes in properties of gel films by 
the UV irradiation, fine-patterning process for oxide films such 
as ZrO[.sub]2[/] and TiO[.sub]2[/] have been developed.

aqueous solutions containing barium ion at room temperature by 
electrochemical method. Highly crystalline BaWO[.sub]4[/] 
films were prepared even at room temperature without any heat 
treatment. The thin films consist of grains with about 1 æm 
in 
size. The weight change of deposited film was dependent on the 
holding time and the applied current density during the 
electrolysis.

Isopropoxide. Y. Suyama (JFCC), M. Nagasawa (TTI), Y. Tomokiyo, 
T. Manabe (Kyusyu Univ.) 
  Single crystals of metal alkoxide complexes have the 
possibility of direct conversion into oxides with well-defined 
and homogeneous composition at atomic level. We synthesized a 
single crystal of Ba-Ti isopropoxide, and the crystal was found 
to be converted into BaTiO[.sub]3[/] at 100ëC. The 
particle size and crystal structure of BaTiO[.sub]3[/] 
derived from the Ba-Ti isopropoxide crystal were investigated. 
  Barium Titanate Ceramics Prepared From Ba-Ti-O Amorphous 
Fine 
Particles. S. Wada, T. Suzuki, and T. Noma (Faculty of 
Technology, Tokyo University of Agriculture and Technology) 
  Ba-Ti-O amorphous fine particles were synthesized by mist 
decomposition method from barium and titanium nitrates. Barium 
titanate ceramics with various grain sizes (30-500 nm) were 
prepared by hot pressing (50 MPa, 1000-1100ëC) of these 
particles. These dielectric constants decreased as the average 
grain sizes of barium titanate ceramics decreased, and the size 
effect was observed in the ceramics with the average grain size 
greater than 30 nm.

Ba(Mg[.sub]1/3[/]Ta[.sub]2/3[/])O[.sub]3[/] Perovskite 
by Hydrolysis of Metal Alkoxides. S. Katayama, I. Yoshinaga, T. 
Nagai, and M. Sugiyama (Nippon Steel Co.) 
  Crystalline 
Ba(Mg[.sub]1/3[/]Ta[.sub]2/3[/])O[.sub]3[/] powders 
were synthesized at a low temperature (around 100ëC) by 
hydrolysis of Ba, Mg, and Ta alkoxides. The alkoxides were 
hydrolyzed in the H[.sub]2[/]O:OR ratio (r) of 10 under 
refluxing to yield a crystalline precipitate, although the 
hydrolysis with a small amount of water (r = 2) gave an 
amorphous precipitate. In the case of non-refluxing, amorphous 
precipitates were obtained, even in the ratio of r = 10.

difficulties in the availability of a niobium precursor 
compatible with chemical routes. Coprecipitation methods were 
investigated using an aqueous solution of lead and magnesium 
nitrates, and peroxo-niobium complexes prepared from niobium 
hydrogen oxalate with hydrogen peroxide. Coprecipitate

Mn[.sup]2+[/], La[.sup]3+[/] and oxidizing agent. This 
film was immersed in a solution containing Sr[.sup]2+[/] 
ions. The amount of Sr incorporated into the precursor was 
dependent on the concentration of Sr[.sup]2+[/] ion in the 
solution and the immersion time.

electrolysis part of the method. The film thickness increased 
linearly to more than 2 æm with an increase in current passed 
through the Ti anode. Current efficiency increased from 0.8 to 
3.0% with decreasing potential of the Ti anode from +16.0 
to 
+8.0 V vs. Ag/AgCl.

size of the colloid were between 2 to 3 nm and the crystalline 
phase of them was Zincite at any synthesis temperatures. A blue 
shift of absorption edge was also observed in UV-VIS absorption 
spectra. As the synthesis temperature increased, the absorption 
edge shifted to longer wavelength.

precipitation method using urea, the initial precipitation 
behavior of aluminum hydroxide in the presence of sulfate ion 
was investigated. It was observed that the growth of aluminum 
hydroxide particles occurred discretely up to ca. 80 nm in 
diameter, but above this size the growth occurred by 
accompanying the particle coalescence in the course of the 
precipitation of aluminum hydroxide. 
  Thermal and Mechanical Properties of Boron or Carbon-Rich 
B[.sub]4[/]C Crystals. Knio Kudou, Shigeru Okada, Torsten 
Lundstrom, Masaaki Miyamoto, and Yasuo Hikichi (Kanagawa U.,

Takeuchi, Y. Tsutsui, and K. Sawano (Process Technology Research 
Laboratories, Nippon Steel Corporation) 
  The friction and wear behaviors between 
BN-Si[.sub]3[/]N[.sub]4[/] composite ceramics and metal 
were investigated using a pin-on-disk tester. The wear rate of 
ceramic pins were strongly dependent on the surface roughness of 
the metal disk. The coefficient of friction did not change 
significantly in the case of rough surface metal, while the 
coefficient decreased with increasing BN content in the case of 
the smooth surface metal. 
  The Effect of Trace Impurities on the Sinterability and 
Electrical Conductivity of Yttria Stabilized Zirconia With Small 
Al[.sub]2[/]O[.sub]3[/] Additions (1-10 wt%). M. Mori, H. 
Itoh, and T. Abe (CRIEPI)

wt% 
Al[.sub]2[/]O[.sub]3[/], which showed the highest 
electrical conductivity at 1000ëC and the highest 
sinterability, contained the least quantity of sodium after 
heating at 1300 or 1400ëC. It is suggested that 
Na[.sub]2[/]O-Al[.sub]2[/]O[.sub]3[/]-SiO[.sub]2[/] 
interaction at grain boundaries of 8YSZ particles offers a 
possible explanation for the improvements in sinterability and 
ionic conductivity. 
  Effects of Additional CuO on Sintering of

In[.sub]2[/]O[.sub]3[/] were sintered at the temperature 
range from 1000 to 1400ëC for 1 hr. The sintered ceramics 
had the low bulk densities of 3.5 to 3.8 g/cm[.sup]3[/]. On 
addition of CuO above 2 wt.% to the compacts, the bulk 
densities of the ceramics increased up to 5.7 g/cm[.sup]3[/] 
and their electrical resistivities decreased down to the order 
of 10[.sup]-2[/] _O_cm with increasing the sintering 
temperature.

Capacitors (MLC) With High Specific Capacitance. T. Mori, A. 
Ochi (NEC, Fundamental Res. Labs.), and M. Kondo (NEC Circuit 
Component Div.) 
  Ag-Pd alloy can be used as internal electrodes of lead-based 
MLCs. Effects of silver on sintering of lead-based dielectric 
ceramics were studied by measuring a sintering temperature of 
dielectric ceramics added 0-0.5 mol% of silver. A 0.5 
mol% of 
silver addition causes a fall in sintering temperature by 
150ëC. SEM observation around the internal electrodes of 
MLCs were also done in order to study the sintering behavior.

in amorphous SiN[.sub]y[/]. It was revealed from 
magnetization curves that either ferromagnetic or paramagnetic 
Si-Fe-N film is able to be prepared by controlling sputtering 
conditions. An annealing effect on magnetic property of Si-Fe-N 
composites is also discussed.

  Tantalum oxide films which can be used as corrosion 
resistant 
materials on metallic substrates were prepared by KrF excimer 
laser CVD. Electrical resistivity of tantalum oxide films were

Phase Reaction Method. J. Hojo, M. Fukuoka (Fac. Eng., Kyushu 
Univ.), A. Yasutake, J. Izumi (Mitsubishi Heavy Ind.) 
  Fine composite powders of 
SiO[.sub]2[/]-Al[.sub]2[/]O[.sub]3[/] system were 
produced from SiCl[.sub]4[/]-AlCl[.sub]3[/]-O[.sub]2[/] 
reaction system. Powder products were amorphous. The particle 
size was 40-200 nm. SiO[.sub]2[/] particles had a large 
surface area near 300 m[.sup]2[/]/g because of the porous 
structure. The surface area was reduced by the inclusion of 
Al[.sub]2[/]O[.sub]3[/] and the addition of 
H[.sub]2[/]O to reaction atmosphere because pores in 
particles disappeared.

SiO[.sub]2[/]-Al[.sub]2[/]O[.sub]3[/] powder prepared 
by the vapor-phase reaction was nitrided by the carbothermal 
reduction at 1400ëC for 3 h; this powder was then heated at 
1000ëC for 1 h under the flowing of O[.sub]2[/]. The 
final powder was composed of spherical particles with diameters 
of -0.03 æm.

on TEM photograph and was varied from 10 nm to 200 nm. 
  The Preparation of AlN Powder by the Reaction in Vapor Phase 
and Its Characterization. M. Yamazaki, M. Tanaka, K. Sudoh, and 
K. Wakimura (Mitsui Toatsu Chem., Inc.) 
  Low carbon content amorphous AlN powder is prepared from 
NH[.sub]3[/] and triethylaluminum (TEA) by vapor phase 
reaction at 400-800ëC. The relation between the reaction 
condition and the carbon content in the product powder was 
investigated. It was revealed that the carbon in the amorphous 
AlN powder consists of at least two species. One species is 
derived from ethyl group of TEA, and another one is derived from 
the carbon compound that is generated by TEA pyrolysis. These 
carbon species have a difference in the volatility at the 
elevated temperature in the crystallization process. 
  Silica Fiber Synthesized by Oxidation of SiO Gas. H. Kotaka 
(Toshiba Ceramics, STK Ceramics Lab.) and H. Saito (Toyota 
Technological Institute, STK Ceramics Lab.) 
  Silica fiber was synthesized by oxidation of SiO gas 
generated from the reaction between Si and SiO[.sub]2[/]

Silicon Nitride Whiskers (2). H. Ono, M. Noguchi, Y. Mizuhara, 
T. Ishihara, and Y. Takita (Faculty of Engineering, Oita 
University) 
  The morphology and the yield of the 
Si[.sub]3[/]N[.sub]4[/] whiskers were varied by the 
addition of transition metals such as Fe, Ni, Cr, and Co, i.e., 
diameter of the formed whiskers increased by the addition of Co 
or Cr. It became apparent that Outside Whiskers grew on the wall 
where temperature was 920-1335ëC in a tubular reactor 
irrespective of starting materials. 
  Microwave Luminescence Properties of SiC Whiskers. K. Amita,

University) 
  Microwave luminescence properties of SiC whiskers prepared 
by 
thermal decomposition of sulfur-containing silicon oil have been 
investigated under different atmospheres. Microwave luminescence 
spectrum could be obtained in both low (0.3 Torr) and high 
(0.001 Torr) vacuum for the whiskers prepared, but only in the 
low vacuum for commercially available ones. All of sharp peaks 
in the spectrum at the low vacuum were ascribed to residual 
gases in the environment, but at the high vacuum a peak 
corresponding to the band gap of _b_-SiC (2.3 eV) was observed 
at around 550 nm, in addition to large and broad peaks beyond 
600 nm.

Y[.sub]2[/]O[.sub]3[/] as additive) composite was 
hot-pressed at 1500ëC for 30 min. The composite showed lower 
bending strength than that of monolithic SiAlON at room 
temperature, but strength degradation at 1200ëC was improved 
than that of monolithic SiAlON. The composite exhibited high 
fracture toughness and the work of fracture.

Na[.sub]2[/]O-SiO[.sub]2[/]-TiO[.sub]2[/] system at 
temperature of 1173 to 1373 K for 1.8 ks in vacuum. Addition of 
Cu decreased the equilibrium contact angle between Titanium and 
solder. Addition of MnO increased the bond strength. In the case 
of PSZ/Na[.sub]2[/]O-SiO[.sub]2[/]-Cu-MnO-CoO/Titanium, 
the bond strength was 72 MPa. Heat treatment at 573 K for 
jointed specimen increased the bond strength to 120 MPa. 
  Wire Electro-Discharge Machining of the Structural Ceramics. 
T. Matsuo and E. Oshima (Kumamoto University) 
  Conductive ceramics such as ZrO[.sub]2[/]-NbC. Sialon-TiN, 
etc. were machined by a wire electro-discharge machine. The 
work-plates of 10mm thickness have been cut by a 0.25mm dia. 
brass wire in pure water. In this study, machining rate as well 
as surface roughness was measured under different conditions and 
NbC contents. Also, the side gap and warp were studied. Thus, 
the optimum conductive carbide content and machining conditions 
were evident for the wire EDM from standpoints of productivity 
and surface quality. 
  Mechanical Properties Observation of 
Al[.sub]2[/]O[.sub]3[/] and 
Al[.sub]2[/]O[.sub]3[/]/Metal Nanocomposites by 
Ultra-Micro Indentation Technique. T. Sekino, H. Kitayama, A. 
Nakahira, and K. Niihara (ISIR, Osaka U.) 
  Some mechanical properties of monolithic 
Al[.sub]2[/]O[.sub]3[/] and 
Al[.sub]2[/]O[.sub]3[/]/metal nanocomposites were 
investigated by using ultra-micro indentation technique for a 
Berkovich type indenter. The load-displacement behavior has been 
measured at the maximum indentation force of 10 to 400 mN. 
Micro-hardness, elastic modulus and elastic-plastic deformation 
phenomena were calculated by using averaged raw data. Both 
Al[.sub]2[/]O[.sub]3[/] and 
Al[.sub]2[/]O[.sub]3[/]/metal composites indicated the 
elastic deformation even at maximum indentation force of 10 mN, 
however, plastic deformation of 
Al[.sub]2[/]O[.sub]3[/]/metal composites were accelerated. 
  Influence of Temperature on Microstructure and Tensile 
Strength of Al[.sub]2[/]O[.sub]3[/] Fibers. H. Iwanaga 
(Faculty of Liberal Arts, Nagasaki University), M. Ichihara, S. 
Takeuchi (Institute for Solid State Physics, The University of 
Tokyo) 
  Alumina monofilaments (10 æm in diameter) were composed 
of 
many crystallites of 0.1-0.5 æm in diameter, within which 
many 
small pores were distributed. Growth morphology of the 
crystallites and pores were observed by TEM. Tensile strength 
measurements of the filaments were carried out at elevated 
temperature. Relation between their morphology and tensile 
strength at high temperature was discussed. 
  High-Temperature Fracture and Slow Crack Growth of 
Polycrystalline Mullite. R. Saito, Y. Okamoto, K. Hayashi, and 
T. Nishikawa (Kyoto I.T.) 
  Fracture behavior of mullite at high temperatures was 
investigated by the constant-stress and constant-stress rate 
techniques. SCG region was observed at all fracture surfaces. 
Apparent critical stress intensity factor at the high 
temperature depends on stress rate, decreasing to 3.0-3.5 
MPam[.sup]1/2[/] with increasing stress rate. Mullite with 
large grain has greater crack velocity compared with fine 
grained mullite. 
  Mechanical Properties of 
ZrO[.sub]2[/]-Al[.sub]2[/]O[.sub]3[/]-WC Ceramic 
Composites Prepared by Slip Casting. K. Noda, T. Shiono, K. 
Hayashi (Kyoto Institute of Technology), R. Shikata, T. 
Nishikawa (Osaka Cement Co., Ltd.) 
  The addition of WC to the Zirconia-Alumina composites 
improved the mechanical properties. The composites were prepared 
by slip-casting method. The composites were sintered in vacuum 
at 1700ëC for 3 hr and isostatically pressed at 1700ëC 
for 1 hr under a pressure of 180 MPa in Ar. Flexural strength of 
the composites was 1500 MPa and was not satisfactorily improved, 
but the fracture toughness was enhanced to 9 
MPa-m[.sup]1/2[/] by the addition of WC. 
  Elastic Moduli and Fracture Toughness of 
CeO[.sub]2[/]-Containing Tetragonal Zirconia Polycrystals 
(Ce-TZP). Y. Kubota (Tosoh), M. Ashizuka and H. Hokazono (Kyu. 
Inst. Tech.) 
  Elastic moduli and fracture toughness of 12 mol% 
CeO[.sub]2[/]-containing tetragonal zirconia polycrystals 
(grain size: 28 æm for Z12C-I, 6.1 æm for Z12C-II) were 
measured as a function of temperature. Young's moduli were 
194-195G, and fracture toughnesses were 6.4 for Z12C-I and 6.7 
MPa-m[.sup]1/2[/] for Z12C-II at room temperature. 
  On the Influence of Temperature to Elastic Modulus and 
Strength of MgO-Partially Stabilized Zirconia. Y. Kubota 
(Tosoh), M. Ashizuka and E. Ishida (Kyu. Inst. Tech.) 
  Elastic modulus and fracture toughness of 9 mol% 
MgO-partially stabilized zirconia was measured as a function of 
temperature. Young's modulus showed the minimum value around 
600ëC in heating process and increased with falling 
temperature in the cooling process. On the other hand, the 
fracture strength was not changed by rising temperature up to 
750ëC in the heating process and showed the maximum value at 
450-500ëC in the cooling process. 
  Creep Deformation of ZrO[.sub]2[/]-Particle Dispersed MgO 
at High Temperature. E. Yasuda, K. Sekine, and T. Akatsu (RLEM 
TIT) 
  Compressive creep of MgO polycrystalline in which 
ZrO[.sub]2[/] particles are dispersed at 1400-1500ëC 
under 6-30 MPa were studied. The steady state creep rates vs. 
stress curves of ZrO[.sub]2[/]/MgO were characterized by a 
transition in stress exponent n the same as those of monolithic 
MgO. It was found that the transition stress of 
ZrO[.sub]2[/]/MgO were higher than that of monolithic MgO. 
  R-Curve Behavior of Ce-TZP/Lanthanum-_b_-Alumina 
Composites. 
T. Fujii, Y. Hamada (Nisshin Flour Milling Co., Ltd.) and S. 
Hirano, M. Miura (Nagoya University) 
  Ce-TZP/Lanthanum-_b_-Alumina composites with a fracture 
toughness of 9-12 MPa-m[.sup]0.5[/] had been developed. An 
indentation-strength method was used for measurement of R-curves 
in these composites (0 wt.% and 0.2 wt.% MnO[.sub]2[/] 
addition). The _b_ values (the slope of indented bar strength 
vs. indentation load on a log-log plot) of these composites were 
0.176 for 0 wt.% MnO[.sub]2[/] and 0.108 for 0.2 wt.% 
MnO[.sub]2[/] addition respectively. 
  High Temperature Strength of Rapidly Solidified Mullite 
Ceramics Containing ZrO[.sub]2[/]. H. Ito, K. Morino 
(Tokuyama College of Tech.), Y. Yamasaki, K. Takagi (Technical 
Research Lab., Toyo Kohan Co., Ltd.) 
  Amorphous mullite ceramic powders containing ZrO[.sub]2[/] 
prepared by Rapid Solidification (RS) were hot-pressed to study 
the characteristics of sintered compacts at elevated 
temperatures. These compacts showed less reduction of strength 
than those without the RS treatment with increasing temperature. 
Dilatometric measurements revealed that the phase transformation 
of ZrO[.sub]2[/] was suppressed in the RS sample due to a 
fine microstructure. This indicated that the phase 
transformation of ZrO[.sub]2[/] led to decrease of the 
strength at elevated temperatures. 
  Cyclic Fatigue Properties of Si[.sub]3[/]N[.sub]4[/] 
Ceramics at Room Temperature. M. Ogawa and K. Isozaki (Denki 
Kagaku Kogyo K.K.) 
  Cyclic fatigue tests of Si[.sub]3[/]N[.sub]4[/] 
ceramics were carried out at room temperature to investigate the 
influences of starting powder on the fatigue behavior. Higher 
fatigue resistance for cyclic stresses in 3-point bending method 
was obtained for the sintered body prepared from 
Si[.sub]3[/]N[.sub]4[/] powder with higher _a_-phase 
content. 
  High Temperature Properties of SiO[.sub]2[/] Doped 
Si[.sub]3[/]N[.sub]4[/] Ceramics. M. Isomura, T. Takahashi 
(NGK Insulators, Ltd.), Y. Endoh, Y. Furuse (Tokyo Electric 
Power Company) 
  High temperature properties of SiO[.sub]2[/] doped 
Si[.sub]3[/]N[.sub]4[/] ceramic were examined up to 
1600ëC. Specimens were prepared by encapsulation-HIP 
process. The hipped material showed almost constant strength 
around 600 MPa between RT and 1600ëC, high creep resistance 
at 1500ëC and good oxidation resistance up to 1600ëC. 
  Microstructure and Mechanical Properties of Composites in 
the 
Si-Al-O-N System. J. Tani, A. Nakahira, and K. Niihara (ISIR, 
Osaka University) 
  We have successfully fabricated high strength Si-Al-O-N 
composites prepared by hot-pressing mixtures of fine 
_g_-Al[.sub]2[/]O[.sub]3[/] and 
_a_-Si[.sub]3[/]N[.sub]4[/] powders at 1600ëC. In the 
present study, the relationship between microstructure and 
mechanical properties of these composites was investigated. TEM 
observations revealed that fine Si[.sub]3[/]N[.sub]4[/] 
particles were dispersed both within the 
Al[.sub]2[/]O[.sub]3[/] matrix grains and at the grain 
boundaries. Surface structure of selected grains in the atomic 
scale was also performed by AFM with much higher lateral and 
vertical resolution compared with SEM. 
  Fiber-Matrix Interface and Mechanical Properties of 3D 
C[.sup]F[/]/SiC Composites. K. Igashira, K. Nishio, J. 
Fujioka, and S. Okazaki (Kawasaki Heavy Industries, Ltd.) 
  The 3D-C[.sup]F[/]/SiC composites were prepared by polymer 
conversion method. Some modifications in processing were done so 
as to control the properties of fiber-matrix interface. 
Mechanical properties of the composite was remarkably affected 
by condition on fiber-matrix interface. 
  Flexural Creep Behavior of Al[.sub]2[/]O[.sub]3[/] 
Doped SiC at 1600ëC in Air. H. Takahashi (Asahi Glass Co., 
Ltd.), Gou Iyogi and Seiichi Hamada (Tokyo Electric Power 
Company) 
  Four point flexural creep behavior of 
Al[.sub]2[/]O[.sub]3[/] doped SiC was investigated over 
the temperature range from 1400 to 1600ëC in ambient air. 
The stress exponents obtained below 1500ëC were close to 2 
though that at 1600ëC was 3.3. Apparent activation energies 
were calculated 400 to 490 kJ/mol. Microscopic observation of 
crept samples suggests the severe degradation of grain boundary 
at 1600ëC by oxidation. 
  High-Temperature Mechanical Properties of TiC 
Particulate-Dispersed SiC Composites. X. H. Tong, T. Iseki 
(Tokyo Inst. of Technol.), B-W. Lin (Indust. Technol. Res. 
Inst., Taiwan, R.O.C.) 
  Up to 1600ëC, high temperature bending strength and 
fracture toughness of Ti doped SiC/TiC composites were measured. 
The bending strength of SiC/TiC composites did not change up to 
1200ëC, decreased at 1400ëC and slightly increased at 
1600ëC due to remarkable growth of 
Ti[.sub]3[/]SiC[.sub]2[/] crystal particles just at 
1400ëC. The existence of Ti[.sub]3[/]SiC[.sub]2[/] in 
the microstructure of hot pressed SiC/TiC composites was 
confirmed by XRD. 
  Residual Strain in Metal Boride Particle Dispersed SiC 
Ceramics. T. Mizutani and A. Tsuge (Toshiba R&amp;D Center) 
  The Selsing's formula is extended to the general formulas 
which contains the effects of dispersed particle amount by using 
a pseudo cell model and a concentric double sphere 
approximation. The derived formulas are applied to 
pTiB[.sub]2[/], pZrB[.sub]2[/] or pWB amount effect on the 
unit lattice volume measured with X-ray diffraction analysis on 
the surface of SiC composite with dispersed particles. 
  Mechanical Properties of Surface Treatment Carbon Fiber 
Reinforced SiC Matrix Composites. K. Naito, H. Yoshida, and C. 
Yamagishi (Nihon Cement Co., Ltd.) 
  SiC layer of 0.3 micron thick was deposited on carbon fiber 
at 1500ëC by CVD method. The fiber reinforced SiC matrix 
composite was fabricated by Hot-Press sintering method. SiC film 
was coated on the composite to examine its oxidation resistance. 
The composites coated SiC were exposed for 200 hours in 
N[.sub]2[/]/O[.sub]2[/] gas mixture at 1450ëC. In the 
results, oxidation properties were improved, because of flexural 
strength after oxidation test was as much as that before test. 
  Mechanical Properties of Intermetallic Compound NiAl 
Prepared 
by Reaction Sintering Method. M. Inoue, K. Kudo, Y. Yamaguchi, 
and K. Suganuma (National Defense Academy) 
  Reaction mechanisms and mechanical properties of NiAl 
prepared by reaction sintering were investigated. Fully 
densified monolithic NiAl could by synthesized successfully by 
vacuum hot-pressing at 1100-1500ëC. The defect strengthening 
and hardening due to nonstoichiometry were confirmed. The 
effects of defect structures to mechanical properties will be 
discussed. 
  Shear Properties of Carbon Fiber Reinforced Ceramic 
Composites. K. Nakano, A. Kamiya (GIRIN), H. Tomida, Y. Nishino 
(NIT), T. W. Chou (Univ. of Delaware) 
  Shear strength (_t_zx) and mode II strain energy release 
rate 
(G[.sub]IIC[/]) of unidirectional carbon fiber reinforced SiC 
and Si[.sub]3[/]N[.sub]4[/] composites, which were 
fabricated by using organosilicon polymer precursors, were 
measured by employing the DNS and ENF methods, respectively. 
These composites showed 30-45 MPa in _t_zx and 0.5-0.7 
kJ/m[.sup]2[/] in G[.sub]IIC[/]. 
  Anomalous Shock Compression Behavior of the 
Y[.sub]2[/]O[.sub]3[/]-Doped Tetragonal Zirconia. T. 
Mashimo (Kumamoto University) and D. E. Grady (Sandia National 
Laboratory, USA) 
  Precise particle-velocity measurements were performed on the 
Y[.sub]2[/]O[.sub]3[/]-doped tetragonal zirconia by the 
VISAR method. Very fine three-wave structures were observed, 
while the normal two-wave structures were observed on the cubic 
zirconias. Release waves from Hugoni of state of 11-13 GPa 
suggested an anomalous large spall property. These unusual shock 
wave profiles may be related to the phase transitions of the 
tetragonal zirconia. 
  Strength Under Shock Compression of the 
Microstructure-Controlled Si[.sub]3[/]N[.sub]4[/] 
Ceramics. A. Nakamura, T. Mashimo (Kumamoto University), and A. 
Yamakawa (Sumitomo Electric Co., Ltd.) 
  In order to study the effects of microstructure on the 
shock-yielding property, the Hugoniot-compression curves of 
grain-controlled and SiC-whisker doped 
Si[.sub]3[/]N[.sub]4[/] ceramics were measured by means of 
the inclined-mirror method combined with a powder gun. The HEL 
stress of the grain-controlled ones, whose grain dimensions were 
finer, were larger than the normal ones. The SiC-whisker doped 
Si[.sub]3[/]N[.sub]4[/] ceramics showed an anomalous shock 
wave profile. 
  Improvement of Sodium Corrosion Characteristics of 
Al[.sub]2[/]O[.sub]3[/] by High Purification. Y. Hirakawa, 
E. Yoshida, Y. Tachi, and S. Kano (Power Reactor and Nuclear 
Fuel Development Corporation, Oarai Engineering Center) 
  Creation of advanced materials is an essential issue to 
attain innovative improvement of fast reactor performance to 
achieve its excellent economics. This paper clarifies the effect 
of improvements on the sodium corrosion resistance of purified 
Al[.sub]2[/]O[.sub]3[/]. 
  Steam Corrosion of Plasma Sprayed, 
Y[.sub]2[/]O[.sub]3[/] Stabilized ZrO[.sub]2[/] 
Coatings. K. Yasuda, M. Itoh, S. Arai, and T. Suzuki (R&amp;D 
Center, Toshiba Corp.) 
  Experiments on the t-m phase transformation of 
ZrO[.sub]2[/] containing 8 wt% Y[.sub]2[/]O[.sub]3[/] 
on the average were carried out under a saturated steam 
atmosphere to understand the mechanism of steam corrosion from 
the viewpoint of Y distribution. The phase transformation 
occurred in heterogeneously Y distributed t-ZrO[.sub]2[/] 
coatings, but it did not occur in homogeneously Y distributed 
ones. This result suggests that a homogeneous Y distribution in 
t-ZrO[.sub]2[/] depresses the phase transformation. 
  Behavior of ZrO[.sub]2[/]-SiO[.sub]2[/] Spray Coating 
at Elevated Temperature. Y. Kurisu, M. Amano, Y. Sinohara 
(Nippon Steel Corp.), H. Saka, K. Kuroda (Nagoya University) 
  The stability of ZrO[.sub]2[/]-SiO[.sub]2[/] spray 
coating in contact with Fe[.sub]3[/]O[.sub]4[/] powder 
were evaluated at elevated temperature. At the coating surface, 
tetragonal ZrO[.sub]2[/] transformed into monoclinic 
ZrO[.sub]2[/] for the transfer of the stabilizer element (Ca) 
caused by the iron diffusion into silica glass. The 
transformation of ZrO[.sub]2[/] can be inhibited by the use 
of Y[.sub]2[/]O[.sub]3[/] as a stabilizer. 
  Durability of WC/TZP Ceramics in Aqueous Environment. Tetsuo 
Yoshio, Yuushi Hara (Okayama Univ.), Kohei Oda (Yonago NCT), 
Toshihiko Nishida (Kyoto IT), and Takaki Masaki (Toray 
Industries Inc.) 
  The primary emphasis of this work is on chemical durability 
of zirconia composite (WC/Y-TZP) in aqueous environments. Water 
corrosion of the ceramics proceeds with weight loss caused by 
dissolution of W. Its extent varies with the processing 
conditions and WC content. The results suggest that an 
understanding of these chemical evaluations might be important 
for improvement of the aging-degradation durability of WC/Y-TZP. 
  Preparation and Properties of Porous Ceramics Using 
_a_-Quartz Particles. S. Furuta, H. Nakao, and H. Katsuki (Saga 
Ceramics Research Laboratory) 
  _a_-Quartz particles were used for raw material to produce 
porous ceramics. Their pore diameter and porosity were changed 
by particle size and some additives which were useful for the 
formation of the green body. The abrasion test of porous body by 
stirring showed a minimum weight loss when bentonite was used 
for the additives. 
  Effect of Talc Grain Size on the Pore Distribution of 
Cordierite Ceramics. M. Nakahara, Y. Hashizuka, Y. Kondo, and K. 
Hamano (Kagawa Industrial Technology Center, Kanagawa Univesity) 
  Effect of talc grain size on the pore distribution and 
bending strength of cordierite ceramics was studied. Six kinds 
of samples were prepared, and examined their apparent porosity, 
pore distribution and bending strength. 
  Synthesis of Spherical Porous Silica Particles. H. Mori, H. 
Yamashita, and T. Maekawa (Ehime University) 
  Spherical porous silica glass whose average diameter is 40 
æm are synthesized by the sol-gel process in W/O emulsions 
and 
a successive thermal treatment. The pore size can be controlled 
by changing temperature of thermal treatment. The presence of 
residual carbons can be avoided by decreasing unreacted 
alkoxides with increasing water content of the initial solution 
at the sol-gel process. 
  Preparation and Characterization of Porous Glass in 
Na[.sub]2[/]O-B[.sub]2[/]O[.sub]3[/]-CaO-SiO[.sub]2[/] 
System. T. Nakamura, H. Yamashita, and T. Maekawa (Ehime 
University) 
  Porous glass was prepared by phase separation process. The 
pore diameter, the specific surface area can be controlled by 
this process. From the result of elemental analysis, the main 
ingredients are silicate whose silica content exceeds more than 
99%. 
  Preparation of Siloxane Oligomer by Phase Separation. H. 
Iyanagi, Y. Takasuka (Pola Lab.), and S. Hirano (Nagoya Univ.) 
  A unique siloxane oligomer was separated from reaction 
mixture when N-phenyl-_g_-aminopropyl-trimethoxysilane was 
hydrolyzed and polycondensated using NH[.sub]4[/] OH without 
stirring. Molecular weight distribution of the oligomer was 
rather sharp and mean molecular weight was not so affected by 
the period until phase separation. It was considered that the 
unique oligomer was synthesized through prevention of 
polycondensation by phase separation. 
  Behavior of Organically Modified Fibrous Silicas in Aqueous 
Solution. Y. Miyamae, H. Iyanagi, Y. Takasuka (POLA Lab.), and 
S. Hirano (Nagoya Univ.) 
  Organically modified fibrous silicas were prepared by the 
sol-gel method of alkoxysilane. We found the fibrous silicas 
treated by heating had the ability of decolorizing the dye 
solution. The pH values of the fibrous silicas varied with their 
heat treatment temperature in aqueous solution. The behavior 
changed with their structure of organic groups. The variation of 
pH values were related to the behavior of the dye decolorization. 
  Synthesis of Fibrous Sodium Titanate Hydrate. H. Suzuki, K. 
Igarashi, and T. Shimizu (Chiba Institute of Technology) 
  The synthesis of fibrous sodium titanate hydrate was 
examined 
by hydrothermal reaction of fibrous titanium dioxide hydrate and 
sodium hydroxide. The reaction approached closely to the 
completion when the concentration of sodium hydroxide was higher 
than 5 mol/l at the temperature of 130ëC. The product had an 
X-ray diffraction pattern with the largest peak at lattice 
spacing of 1.1 nm. 
  Powder Synthesis by Emulsion Firing. K. Takatori and S. Hori 
(Toyota CRDL) 
  Two oxide powders, ZrO[.sub]2[/] and ZrTiO[.sub]4[/], 
were synthesized by an emulsion firing method. The emulsions 
containing metal ions in the aqueous droplets were air atomized 
and fired to yield oxide powders. The synthesized powders were 
characterized by SEM, BET and XRD. They were spherical and 
submicrometer in size. The emulsion firing method was considered 
to be applicable to synthesize fine mixed-oxide powders. 
  Preparation of Mixed Valence Bismuth Oxides From Alkaline 
Aqueous Solutions. N. Kinomura, M. Hosoda, and H. Kojima 
(Yamanashi Univ.) 
  Pyrochlore type 
Na[.sub]0.39[/]Bi[.sub]3.45[/]O[.sub]7[/] and 
BiO[.sub]x[/] containing Bi[.sup]5+[/] were prepared by 
low temperature hydrothermal reaction using hydrated sodium 
bismuth oxide, NaBiO[.sub]3[/]-nH[.sub]2[/]O, as a 
starting material. The mean valence of Bi in the pyrochlore is 
3.94. The X-ray powder pattern for the pyrochlore was indexed in 
the cubic system with a = 1.0943(8) nm. The crystal structure 
was refined with the X-ray powder Rietveld method. The 
pyrochlore decomposes above 380ëC with two steps of weight 
losses caused by complete reduction from Bi[.sup]5+[/] to 
Bi[.sup]3+[/]. 
  Preparation of ZrO[.sub]2[/]-Al[.sub]2[/]O[.sub]3[/] 
Composite Particles by Thermal Decomposition of Metallo-Organic 
Compounds. H. Yoshimatsu (Okayama Ceramics Research Foundation), 
Y. Miura, A. Osaka (Okayama University), and H. Kawasaki 
(Industrial Technology Center of Okayama Prefecture) 
  Gels prepared from ethyl acetoacetate aluminium 
di-iso-propylate (ALCH) and zirconium n-butoxide were heated 
between 700ëC and 1400ëC in air to prepare 
ZrO[.sub]2[/]-Al[.sub]2[/]O[.sub]3[/] composite 
particles. The volume fraction (V[.sub]t[/]) of tetragonal 
ZrO[.sub]2[/] in the total amount of ZrO[.sub]2[/] for the 
ALCH derived particles heated at 1400ëC for 2 h was greater 
than that for the particles with the same Zr/Al ratio from 
mixtures of aluminium sec-butoxide and zirconium n-butoxide. 
  Preparation of _b_'-Sialon by a Sol-Gel Method. C. Sakurai 
and T. Nose (Advanced Mater. &amp; Tech. Research Labs., Nippon 
Steel Corp.) 
  _b_'-Sialon (Z = 2) was prepared by a sol-gel method using 
_g_-(aminoethyl)aminopropyltrimethoxysilane and aluminum 
s-butoxide modified with triethanolamine. Single phase 
_b_'-Sialon was obtained at 1500ëC in N[.sub]2[/] by 
carbothermal-reduction-nitridation. Existence of Al-O-Si bonding 
in the gel was important to synthesize single phase _b_'-Sialon 
at lower temperature. 
  Synthesis and Hot Isostatic Pressing of Ni-Se-Te Materials. 
T. Hattori, S. Nishiyama, T. Matsuzaki (Chiba University) 
  NiSe and NiTe were prepared by solid state reactions in 
vacuum. These synthesized powders were mixed and CIPed into 
pellets, followed by HIPing in capsules. The amount of 
substitution of Te for Se was comparatively small, less than 25 
mol%. In the other way, Se substituted for Te in NiTe 
more than 
25 mol%. The density of HIPed NiSe-NiTe body increased 
with 
increasing amount of Te up to 50 mol%. It seems to be 
because 
the melting point was depressed by solid solution. The density 
of NiTe was highest. 
  Fabrication and Characterization of 
Al[.sub]2[/]O[.sub]3[/]/TiC/Ni/TiC/Al[.sub]2[/]O[.sub]3[/] 
Symmetrical FGMs by SHS/HIP. Z. Li, K. Tanihata, Y. Miyamoto 
(ISIR, Osaka Univ.) 
  The symmetrically arranged functionally gradient materials 
of 
Al[.sub]2[/]O[.sub]3[/]/TiC/Ni/TiC/Al[.sub]2[/]O[.sub]3[/] 
densified using Si fuel at 100 MPa N[.sub]2[/] pressure by 
SHS/HIP. The product size was about _P_ 30 x 6mm. The Ni 
content 
was 20 to 30 wt% at the center layer and diffused toward 
the 
Al[.sub]2[/]O[.sub]3[/] layer. The surface hardness and 
toughness were similar to the bulk 
Al[.sub]2[/]O[.sub]3[/], but decreased and increased 
remarkably toward the inside respectively. The 
Al[.sub]2[/]O[.sub]3[/] surface had the compressive 
residual stress of about 200 MPa. Flexural strength ranged in 
600 to 700 MPa which depended on the microstructure. 
  Mechanical and Electrical Properties of 
Al[.sub]2[/]O[.sub]3[/]/Metal Composites With Continuous 
Al[.sub]2[/]O[.sub]3[/] and Metal Phases. Y. Batai, T. 
Watari, T. Torikai, and O. Matsuda (Saga University) 
  The composites consisted of Al[.sub]2[/]O[.sub]3[/], Al 
and Si grew by oxidizing Al-Si-MgO powder compacts. The 
electrical conductivity of the composite (50% oxidation) 
was 
0.94 _O_[.sup]-1[/]-cm[.sup]-1[/]. This indicates Al phase 
is continuous. The bending strength of the composites had the 
maximum value of 412 MPa in case that oxidation ratio was 
50%. 
The fracture toughness of the composites increased with 
decreasing oxidation ratio and was 4.88 MPa-m[.sup]1/2[/] in 
case that oxidation ratio was 35%. 
  Combustion Synthesized TiC Body With Dense Surface Layer. M. 
Ohyanagi, M. Shibuya, and M. Zoizumi (Ryukoku University) 
  TiC cylindrical body with dense surface layer was fabricated 
by combustion synthesis. The dense surface layer can be formed 
in the green density greater than approximately 75%. The 
reactant compacts were ignited by using an ignition pellet of 
loose powder compact consisting of same content as the reactant. 
Effects of the green density and an exposed gas pressure on a 
fabrication of the dense surface layer were studied. The 
features of the layer were also reported. 
  SHS Casting of MoSi[.sub]2[/] and FeSi[.sub]2[/]. Osamu 
Yamada (Osaka Industrial Univ.) 
  The new thermite type SHS process (TM-SHS) has been 
developed 
by combining the modified thermite reaction and the combustion 
synthesis reaction. The TM-SHS has potentiality for increasing 
reaction temperature over melting points of such silicide 
ceramics as MoSi[.sub]2[/] and FeSi[.sub]2[/] due to large 
formation heat, and for casting the molten products. 
  Compatibility of Various Ceramics in Elevated Temperature 
Sodium. Y. Tachi, E. Yoshida, Y. Hirakawa, and S. Kano (Power 
Reactor and Nuclear Fuel Development Corporation, Oarai 
Engineering Center) 
  Research has been carried out on the creation of new 
ceramics 
to be used under severe nuclear environment in order to attain 
an innovative improvement of fast reactor performance by using 
their excellent heat-resisting properties, etc. Sodium 
compatibility of various ceramics has been evaluated by their 
weight change resulted from sodium exposure tests at 550 and 
650ëC for 1000 and 4000 hours. 
  High Temperature Oxidation Behavior of Silicon Nitride 
Ceramics. M. Ueki, Y. Sato (Nippon Steel Corp.), and K. Kurokawa 
(Hokkaido University) 
  Two types of silicon nitride ceramics with 
Y[.sub]2[/]O[.sub]3[/] and Al[.sub]2[/]O[.sub]3[/] 
added as sintering aids in different volume percentages and 
another type of silicon nitride ceramic with 
Y[.sub]2[/]O[.sub]3[/] and HfO[.sub]2[/] added as 
sintering aids were investigated for high-temperature oxidation 
behavior in the temperature region of 1100 to 1300ëC. 
  Corrosion Study of Silicon Nitride Ceramics in Plutonium 
Nitrate Solution (2). T. Kurita, Y. Suzuki (Power Reactor and 
Nuclear Fuel Development Corporation), and K. Uematsu (Nagaoka 
Univ. Tech.) 
  Corrosion behavior of silicon nitride ceramics was 
investigated in plutonium nitrate solution. Sample was examined 
with weight loss, corrosion layer and SEM. Elements dissolved in 
plutonium nitrate solution were determined with the DCP analysis. 
  Corrosion Behavior of Structural Ceramics in Combustion Gas 
Flow. Y. Endo, Y. Furuse (Tokyo Electric Power Co.), H. 
Kobayashi, T. Takahashi (NGK Insulators, Ltd.), A. Hashimoto 
(Mitsui Engineering &amp; Shipbuilding Co., Ltd.) 
  Corrosion behavior of ceramics was investigated under 
operational conditions of gas turbines. From investigations by 
SEM observation, X-ray diffraction and measurement of surface 
profiles, it is considered that surface layers which could be 
protective against further oxidation were not formed on the 
surface of Si[.sub]3[/]N[.sub]4[/] specimens exposed to 
combustion gas flow. Results of 100 hr exposure test indicate 
that ceramic oxide coatings can be effective to increase 
corrosion resistance of Si[.sub]3[/]N[.sub]4[/]. 
  Oxidation Behavior of Cubic-Boron Nitride Powder at High 
Temperature. M. Tabira, K. Kobayashi, Y. Uchiyama, H. M. Cheng, 
and H. Sano (Faculty of Engineering, Nagasaki University) 
  Oxidation behavior of 8 cubic-BN powders was investigated in 
dry air at elevated temperature comparing with that of 
hexagonal-BN. Weight loss started at about 1000ëC for c-BN 
and no weight gain was observed, while weight gain started at 
850ëC for h-BN showing the maximum at 1150ëC. Many pores 
and cracks were observed on the surface of oxidized c-BN powder. 
It was considered that both formation and evaporation of 
B[.sub]2[/]O[.sub]3[/] proceeded at the same time for 
oxidation of c-BN and this caused the TG curve with no weight 
gain. 
  Oxidation and Strength Degradation of SiC Fibers in Air and 
Water. (T.I.T.) Yu. Gogotsi and M. Yoshimura 
  Fiber-reinforced ceramic matrix composites are being 
developed for a variety of applications. Knowledge of the 
environmental effects on mechanical properties of the fiber is 
essential for composite design and property prediction. The 
objectives of this work were to investigate the mechanism of 
oxidation of SiC fibers in air and water and to determine the 
tensile strength and Young's modulus of the fibers after 
oxidation and hydrothermal corrosion. 
  A Tentative Preparation of _b_-SiC-Coated Carbon Fiber. S. 
Yamada (Nishi Tokyo Univ.), E. Yasuda, T. Akatsu (TIT), and M. 
Kimura (Tokai Univ.) 
  To improve the heat-proof temperature of carbon fiber, 
carbonized and graphitized carbon fibers derived from PAN were 
heat-treated with SiO at 1400ëC in vacuo for various 
minutes. _b_-SiC-coated fibers showed over 100ëC higher 
temperature where 2% weight-decrease appeared. 
  Compositional Analysis and SEM Observation at the Interfaces 
in Oxidation of ZrC Single Crystals. S. Shimada, M. Nishisako, 
M. Inagaki (Hokkaido University), and K. Yamamoto (Dowa Kogyo) 
  The oxidation of ZrC single crystals was carried out at 
500-600ëC and Po[.sub]2[/] = 2.6 kPa. It was found that 
the ZrO[.sub]2[/] phase is divided into two zones 1 and 2. 
Zone 1 showed a steep concentration gradient of oxygen and 
contained as much as carbon of 14-27 at%. Zone 2 was 
found to 
contain the 7-17 at% carbon, and many pores and cracks. 
  Effect of LaB[.sub]6[/] Addition and Grinding Treatment on 
Graphitization of Oil Coke. S. Araki, K. Kobayashi, Y. Uchiyama, 
H. M. Cheng, and H. Sano (Nagasaki Univ.) 
  Effect of grinding and LaB[.sub]6[/] addition was 
investigated on graphitization and sinterability of raw oil coke 
powder. Grinding was found to lower graphitizability and improve 
sinterability of the powder. Oil coke with 5 wt% 
LaB[.sub]6[/] heat treated at 2500ëC indicated a higher 
value of d[.sub](002)[/] than unadded oil coke. 
  High Temperature Oxidation of SiC-C Particle Mixtures. M. 
Ishikawa, H. Nanri, M. Wakamatsu, K. Watanabe (Taiko 
Refractories Co., Ltd.), N. Takeuchi, S. Ishida (Kyoto IT) 
  The oxidation behavior of SiC-C particle mixtures was 
studied 
at 600 to 1400ëC in O[.sub]2[/]-Ar mixture. Oxidation was 
monitored by the measurement of the evolved CO and 
CO[.sub]2[/] using quadrupole mass spectrometer. 
  Oxidation Resistance of Carbon Fiber Reinforced SiC Matrix 
Composites. K. Nishio, K. Igashira, J. Fujioka, and S. Okazaki 
(Kawasaki Heavy Industries, Ltd.) 
  Mono- and multi-layer SiC films were coated on carbon fiber 
reinforced SiC matrix composites by CVD method to improve their 
oxidation resistance. Cracks in the SiC coatings occurred during 
CVD process were sealed with B[.sub]2[/]O[.sub]3[/], 
coated composites were subjected to cyclic oxidation tests in 
air at 1350ëC. Weight change of the composites coated with 
SiC multi-layers was smaller than that of the composite coated 
with SiC mono-layer. 
  High Temperature Behavior of Additive Metals in MgO-C 
Bricks. 
E. Hatae, T. Suruga, J. Yoshitomi, and I. Furusato (Krosaki 
Corporation) 
  MgO-C bricks have excellent slag and thermal shock 
resistance 
and are widely used in converters. It is well known that metals 
such as Al, Si, and Al-Mg alloy are added to prevent oxidation 
of MgO-C bricks. We will mainly discuss the high temperature 
behavior of MgO-C bricks with Al, Al-Mg alloy and Mg-B 
additions. We also investigated the addition of Mg-B material to 
MgO-C bricks. Consequently, oxidation resistance and hot M.O.R. 
were found to be greatly improved by less than 1% 
additions of 
Mg-B material together with less than 5% Al or Al-Mg 
alloy. 
  Properties of Alumina-Magnesia Castable Refractories for 
Steel Ladles. K. Yamaguchi, I. Takita, K. Furuta, Y. Matsuo, Y. 
Urita (Krosaki Co. Monolithic Div.) 
  We have made improvements in Alumina-Magnesia castable 
refractories for steel ladles. It was recognized that use of 
fine magnesia powder and super fine silica powder brings about 
superior corrosion resistance. The reason why corrosion 
resistance is improved result from improved density, due to 
spinel expansion under load. 
  Changes of Elasticity by Slag Penetration Into Monolithic 
Refractories. E. Udagawa, E. Maeda, and T. Nozaki (Iron &amp; 
Steel 
Research Labs., Kawasaki Steel Corp.) 
  The structural spalling derived from slag penetration is the 
most significant phenomenon for wear of refractories. Then we 
investigated about changes of material properties such as 
elasticity by slag penetration into magnesia based monolithic 
refractories. Elasticity of the material measured at room 
temperature increased by slag penetration, and the magnitude of 
it was great at the hot face side of specimen compared with the 
place at penetrated CaO finally reached. 
  Quantitative Evaluation of the Dimensions of Process Zone 
and 
Crack-Face Bridging Region. H. Kurita and M. Sakai (TUT) 
  The fracture toughness of ceramic materials is controlled by 
the frontal process zone as well as the crack-face bridging 
behind the crack-tip. In graphite materials, the process zone 
size is extremely large. Its R-curve behavior is dominated by 
grain bridging. These zone sizes are evaluated quantitatively 
through a fracture mechanics approach. 
  Evaluation of Fatigue Crack Growth Characteristics of 
Alumina 
Ceramics. F. Tamai (Industrial Technology Center of Saga) and K. 
Hirano (Mechanical Engineering Lab., AIST, MITI) 
  In order to know the influence of cyclic load on the crack 
propagation behavior of sintered alumina, static and cyclic 
fatigue crack growth tests were carried out over a wide range of 
fatigue crack growth rate. The crack growth rate da/dN was 
independent of frequency. In cases of R, R = 0.1, 0.5, the crack 
growth rate in cyclic fatigue was higher than that in static 
fatigue. The effective stress intensity factor range 
_D_K[.sub]eff[/], together with K[.sub]max[/], is a useful 
parameter to describe the cyclic crack propagation rate. 
  Effect of Notch-Root Radius on the Fracture Toughness of 
Alumina Ceramic. T. Nishida, Y. Hanaki (Kyoto I.T.) 
  The dependence of the K[.sub]IC[/] value on the notch-tip 
radius has been examined up to notch radii as small as few 
microns in a dense, fine-grained polycrystalline alumina 
ceramic. The K[.sub]IC[/] value was found to be independent 
of the notch sharpness for tip radii &lt;10 æm. 
  The Crack Growth Resistance of an In-situ Toughened 
Si[.sub]3[/]N[.sub]4[/] Ceramics at Elevated Temperatures. 
T. Miyajima, Y. Yamauchi, and T. Ohji (GIRIN) 
  The crack growth resistance (R-curve) and the fracture 
toughness (G[.sub]Ic[/]) of a rod-like 
_b_-Si[.sub]3[/]N[.sub]4[/] toughened 
Si[.sub]3[/]N[.sub]4[/] ceramics were determined by the 
use of AM-DCB specimen at elevated temperatures. The effect of 
the fractured temperature on the maximum crack growth resistance 
(R[.sup]ì[/]) was more sensitive than that on the fracture 
toughness. The results from this R-curve study indicate that 
integral relationship of crack-face bridging force and bridging 
length take minimum-value about 1100ëC and maximum about 
1200ëC at displacement rate of 0.005mm/min. 
  Failure Probability Assessment of 
Si[.sub]3[/]N[.sub]4[/] Ceramics Under Multi-Axial Stress 
States. T. Kato and K. Isozaki (Denki Kagaku Kogyo K.K.) 
  The failure probability in the compression test of ring 
specimen was calculated using the mechanical properties obtained 
from 3-point bending test. Three kinds of criteria were 
evaluated in the calculations. The calculated values of penny 
shaped crack criterion and G-criterion were in good agreement 
with the experimental values. 
  Temperature Dependence of the Elastic Moduli, Dilational and 
Shear Internal Frictions (I). M. Fukuhara, A. Sanpei (Toshiba 
Tungaloy), I. Yamauchi (Cho-onpa Kogyo) 
  We succeeded to develop a high temperature-simultaneous 
measuring system for all elastic moduli (Young's, shear and bulk 
moduli, Poisson's ratio and Lame parameter), dilational and 
shear internal friction values from room temperature to 1823 K, 
by an ultrasonic pulse sing-around method. These elastic moduli 
and Lame parameter of _a_-Al[.sub]2[/]O[.sub]3[/], (Y)TZP 
and _b_'-sialon decrease and their Poisson's ratio increases 
with increasing temperature, suggesting activation of shear mode 
in the high temperature region. 
  Temperature Dependence of the Elastic Moduli, Dilational and 
Shear Internal Frictions (II). M. Fukuhara, A. Sanpei (Toshiba 
Tungaloy), I. Yamauchi (Cho-onpa Kogyo) 
  The elastic moduli and Poisson's ratio of (Y)TZP and 
_b_'-sialon decrease and increases with increasing of 
temperature, respectively. The high-temperature shear internal 
friction for (Y)TZP and sialon are more sensitive to strain and 
softening of glassy phase at grain boundaries, compared with the 
dilational one. Rapid increase in dilational friction 
corresponds to grain boundary sliding phenomena such as 
superplasticity and recrystallization. 
  Problems of Fitting Fatigue Data of Ceramics to a Straight 
Line. N. Yamada, Y. Nakasuji, and H. Sakai (NGK Insulators, Ltd.) 
  The method of straight line fitting and the variability of 
estimated crack growth parameter n for fatigue data of ceramics 
were considered. The least square method (LSM) was applied to 
Monte Carlo simulation data of the static fatigue life time 
obtained from the Weibull distribution of initial strengths and 
the power law of the slow crack growth. The average of crack 
growth parameter n estimated by the LSM is not in agreement with 
the true value. The standard deviation of n is relatively large 
and influenced by the Weibull modulus m. 
  Ultrasonic Fatigue Test of Sintered 
Si[.sub]3[/]N[.sub]4[/] (III). T. Makino, Y. Nakasuji, H. 
Sakai, and M. Matsui (NGK Insulators, Ltd.) 
  Ultrasonic fatigue test of sintered 
Si[.sub]3[/]N[.sub]4[/] was conducted to evaluate the 
influence of precrack length on fatigue behavior. S-N curves 
show the reverse S-shaped behavior. Fatigue limit depends on the 
precrack length. The longer the precrack length is, the smaller 
the difference between fast fracture strength and fatigue limit 
becomes. 
  Effect of Applied Stress Ratio on Fatigue Lifetime 
Distribution of Polycrystalline Alumina Ceramics. T. Ina, K. 
Yasuda, K. Jinbo, Y. Matsuo, and S. Kimura 
  The lifetime distribution on cyclic fatigue loading was 
investigated on variable applied stress ratio. The range of 
lifetime distribution on cyclic fatigue loading was narrower 
than on static loading. This suggests that fatigue behavior 
between under cyclic loading and static loading is different. 
  Evaluations of Quenching Liquid Used on the Quenching Method 
for Ceramics. T. Nishikawa, T. Gao, M. Hibi, and M. Takatsu (NIT) 
  Transitional temperatures in the specimen were measured 
after 
quenching and analyzed with various quenching liquids. The heat 
transfer coefficients h were obtained for each temperature 
difference. The mixture of mineral oil and butanol proved to be 
the suitable quenching liquid for thermal shock test of ceramics. 
  Corrosion of Hexagonal Boron Nitride in Oxygen and Water at 
Elevated Temperatures. Kohei Oda (Yonago National College of 
Technology) and Tetsuo Yoshio (Okayama University) 
  This work is concerned with the reactions between h-BN 
materials and common oxidizing media, such as oxygen and 
H[.sub]2[/]O. The oxidation and hydrothermal corrosion 
kinetics for h-BN were found to obey linear rate law and 
described by the surface chemical reaction controlled shrinking 
model. The apparent activation energies were found to be 300 
kJ/mol in dry oxygen and 60 kJ/mol in water, respectively. 
Corrosion behavior of sintered h-BN will be discussed with 
regard to its microstructure. 
  Transmission Electron Microscopy of Grain Boundaries in MgO 
Aggregates. T. Matsui, J. Nakao, H. Nakamura, H. Taira (Process 
Tech. Res. Lab., Nippon Steel Corp.), and M. Ueki (Adv. Mat. 
&amp; 
Tech. Res. Lab., Nippon Steel Corp.) 
  Observation of grain boundaries for MgO aggregates with 
different purities was performed using transmission electron 
microscope. The MgO aggregate, containing about 0.5 wt% 
B[.sub]2[/]O[.sub]3[/] as impurities, has glassy 
grain-boundary phases. On the other hand the MgO aggregate, 
containing only 0.003 wt% B[.sub]2[/]O[.sub]3[/] as 
impurities, has crystalline grain-boundary phases. 
  Phase Transition Enthalpy Between Tetragonal and Monoclinic 
Phases in ZrO[.sub]2[/]-Y[.sub]2[/]O[.sub]3[/] and 
ZrO[.sub]2[/]-CeO[.sub]2[/] Solid Solutions. M. Yashima, 
H. Takashina, M. Kakihana, M. Yoshimura (Tokyo Institute of 
Technology), T. Mitsuhashi, T. Ikegami (National Institute for 
Research in Inorganic Materials) 
  Compositionally homogeneous 
ZrO[.sub]2[/]-Y[.sub]2[/]O[.sub]3[/] and 
ZrO[.sub]2[/]-CeO[.sub]2[/] solid solutions were prepared 
by arc melting and by sintering, respectively. Transition 
enthalpy between tetragonal and monoclinic phases, which were 
determined by DSC (Differential Scanning Calorimetry) 
measurements, decreased with an increase of dopant content. The 
DSC peak broadened and the transition temperature decreased 
linearly with an increase of dopant content.

  [Text] Crystal structure of _a_-AlB[.sub]12[/] 
(tetragonal; space group, P4[.sub]1[/]2[.sub]1[/]2 or 
P4[.sub]3[/]2[.sub]1[/]2) has been studied by 
single-crystal X-ray diffractometry and an isotope effect in 
bond lengths of the icosahedral B[.sub]12[/] network was 
examined. The crystals were prepared from high-temperature 
aluminum solutions. A mixture of Al and the B-10 (99%) or 
B-11 
(90%) enriched elemental boron powder was placed in an 
alumina 
crucible and heated under an argon atmosphere up to 1500ëC, 
kept for 3 h, and then slowly cooled to room temperature. The 
crystals of (_a_-AlB[.sub]12[/](B-10) or 
(_a_-AlB[.sub]12[/](B-11) grown in the reaction mixture were 
separated by dissolving an excess of Al with hot hydrochloric 
acid. 
  Well-formed single crystals with an approximately octahedral 
form bounded with [101] planes were used for the lattice 
constants and intensity measurements, which were made with a 
four-circle diffractometer equipped with Mo 
K[.sub]_a_/_a_1[/] radiation. Starting from published 
data,[.sup]1[/] the structure was refined with the aid of a 
full-matrix least squares program to the R(Rw) values of 
0.028(0.035) and 0.025(0.033) for _a_-AlB[.sub]12[/](B-10) 
and a- AlB[.sub]12[/](B-11), respectively. The structural 
parameters (atomic coordinates, occupancies of Al sites, 
temperature factors) obtained for one crystal were the same as 
their respective equivalents for the other, demonstrating that 
the crystal structure including the nature of metal distribution 
is the same in both crystals. As shown in the following, 
however, there were appreciable differences in the lattice 
constants of the two crystals: 
  (Enraf-Nonius CAD-4 four-circle diffractometer; 
MoK[.sub]_a_l[/], 0.70930 Angstrom, 20ëC) 
  _a_-AlB[.sub]10[/](B-10): a = 10.1570(4),c = 
14.2622(7) Angstrom 
  _a_-AlB[.sub]11[/](B-11): a = 10.1559(4),c = 
14.2587(7) Angstrom 
  reflecting the difference between the mass numbers of B-10 
and B-11, which may affect the thermal vibration of boron atoms 
in a different degree and thus producing different B-B bond 
lengths of the icosahedral B[.sub]12[/] network in the two 
crystals. Structural details of the _a_-AlB[.sub]12[/] 
structure and metal distribution in it will be presented.

  [Text] Recently, wear-resistant materials require a wide 
range of properties such as corrosion and oxidation resistance, 
electrical and thermal conductivity, etc., in addition to wear 
resistance. Borides, especially transition metal borides, have 
intrinsic properties, i.e., high melting point, high hardness 
and electrical conductivity, hence they are promising candidates 
for the wear-resistant application. However, poor sinterability 
and extreme brittleness of borides have notorious disadvantages 
to form solid structures in spite of their excellent properties. 
  One solution to the above problem had reached the 
combination 
of a boride with a tough metal matrix, namely a boride base 
cermet. But strong chemical reaction between a boride and a 
metal matrix failed in the fabrication of the cermet with 
satisfactory mechanical properties due to the formation of 
brittle third phases. 
  By enhancing the reaction between a boride and a metal 
matrix 
instead of restricting it between them, a novel strategy to form 
a ternary boride coexisted with metal during the sintering 
process starting with a binary boride and a metal resulted in 
successful achievement of a cemented boride with excellent wear 
resistance and mechanical properties. 
  This new sintering technique, named reaction boronizing 
sintering, has already developed three ternary boride base 
cermets; namely, Mo[.sub]2[/]FeB[.sub]2[/],[.sup]1[/] 
MO[.sub]2[/]NI- B[.sub]2[/],[.sup]2[/] and 
WCoB[.sup]3[/] base ones. These new ternary boride base 
cermets have been successfully applied to wear-resistant 
applications such as injection molding machine parts, can-making 
tools, hot copper extruding dies, etc. 
  In this paper, criteria for the development of ternary 
boride 
base cermets and the characteristics of those will be discussed.

  [Text] Boron-rich semiconductors have unique three centered 
covalent bonds and eight kinds of crystalline structures with 
icosahedral clusters (B[.sub]12[/]). Though other seven 
elemental semiconductors, e.g., Si, P, Se, have rather simple 
bonding nature, i.e., sp[.sup]3[/], p[.sup]3[/], 
p[.sup]2[/], only boron has such complicated bonds. Aluminum 
is an element which belongs to the same third group as boron and 
has the same icosahedral cluster (Al[.sub]12[/]) in metallic 
quasicrystalline alloys. On the other hand, C[.sub]60[/] 
molecular solid is also an elemental semiconductor which has 
almost sp[.sup]2[/] bond and C[.sub]60[/] cluster has an 
icosahedral symmetry. Bonding nature between C[.sub]60[/] is 
van der Waals type, though that between clusters in boron-rich 
semiconductors is covalent. It is interesting to investigate the 
interrelation between boron-rich semiconductors, aluminum-based 
quasicrystalline metals and C[.sub]60[/] molecular solids. 
Boron-rich solids are considered to be candidates for a 
semiconducting quasicrystal. 
  Quasicrystals have been found in many kinds of, but only 
metallic alloy systems. Boron-rich solids are considered to be 
icosahedral approximate crystals which have the same local 
structures as an icosahedral quasicrystal. Analyzing the 
crystalline structure of _a_- and _b_- rhombohedral boron as 
approximates, atomic structures of two unit cells of the 
icosahedral quasicrystal are constructed. Based on cohesive 
energy calculated by the molecular orbital method, the 
_a_-rhombohedral boron type quasicrystal can be realized. Among 
the (_a_-rhombohedral type structures, the distortion of 
B[.sub]12[/] is the smallest and rhombohedral axis angle is 
close to the icosahedral angle for the B-C system. A search for 
semiconducting quasicrystal has been experimentally done in the 
B-C system. A new type of approximate phase of icosahedral 
quasicrystal has been found on the way to crystallization of the 
B[.sub]95[/]C[.sub]5[/] amorphous phase. 
  The crystalline structure of the _b_-rhombohedral boron is 
considered to have B[.sub]84[/] soccer-ball clusters at 
vertices of the rhombohedral unit cell. The B[.sub]84[/] 
cluster is constructed of B[.sub]60[/] outer soccer-ball 
shell and B[.sub]24[/] inner double icosahedral. This 
crystalline structure is essentially the same as the face 
centered cubic structure of C[.sub]60[/]. Though lattice 
constants are almost the same (about 1 nm), soccer-balls have 
larger diameters and are closer to each other for the _b_-boron 
than for C[.sub]60[/]. This corresponds to that bonds between 
the C[.sub]60[/] clusters are van der Waals type and those 
between B[.sub]84[/] clusters are covalent. In spite of this 
different bonding nature, energy band gaps are similar (about 
1.5 Ev) for bothmaterials. Though electrical conductivity and 
magnetic susceptibility of alkali metal doped C[.sub]60[/] is 
metallic and shows superconducting transition, those of the 
_b_-boron remain to be semiconductive up to several percent 
metal doping and the conductivity has a variable-range hopping 
type temperature dependence. For the _b_-boron, the Fermi level 
is pinned at the localized intrinsic acceptor level and a 
carrier may form a bipolaron.

  [Text] Twelve boron (B) atoms form an icosahedral cluster 
B[.sub]12[/], and these icosahedra form a pseudo-fcc crystal 
that is called _a_-B. Motivated by the recent discovery of new 
superconducting materials A[.sub]x[/]C[.sub]60[/], we have 
theoretically explored new intercalation compounds based on 
_a_-B to find out a possibility of superconductivity. In this 
talk we investigate three kinds of boron intercalation 
compounds, and show the features of their electronic structures 
calculated by the first principle calculations. As the positions 
of intercalated sites, we consider 1) an octahedral site, 2) 
tetrahedral sites and 3) both ends of an interstitial chain 
along the body diagonal, which correspond to phosphorous 
positions of B[.sub]12[/]P[.sub]2[/] structure. Since 
there is not enough space to accommodate large atoms between 
icosahedra, we chose lithium (Li) atom as an intercalant, due to 
the smallest ionic radius of 0.68 A among all the alkali-metal 
atoms. 
  In cases where Li's are intercalated into octahedral and 
tetrahedral sites, an energy band of Li character appears above 
the lowest conduction band of B character, and thus the Li 2s 
electrons are transferred into lower conduction bands with B 
character. As a result, the Fermi level crosses the lowest 
conduction band in the former and the two lower conduction bands 
in the latter, respectively. 
  In the cases where Li's are intercalated into interstitial 
sites, the charge density calculations show that Li-B hybridized 
bands newly appear in the higher valence band region of B. As a 
result, the Fermi level crosses two higher valence bands, and 
hole-like carriers appear in this case. We call this 
intercalation compound ``acceptor-type metal.'' 
  The present results show that both donor-type and 
acceptor-type metallic materials call be obtained by 
intercalating the same species of intercalant atoms. In this 
respect ``boron'' is different from C[.sub]60[/] fullerides 
and graphite intercalation compounds (GICs). By calculating the 
total energies of these compounds, we show that the compound of 
octahedral intercalation sites, B[.sub]12[/]Li(O), has the 
lowest energy. Thus this donor-type compound is expected to 
appear as the first step of intercalation. 
  In order to investigate a possibility of superconductivity 
especially in the case where Li's are intercalated into 
octahedral sites, we have calculated the density of states for 
this compound. Its value at the Fermi energy is 0.26/eV x atom, 
which is very close to that of K[.sub]3[/]C[.sub]60[/] 
calculated by Saito and Oshiyama.[.sup]1[/]

  [Text] Boron carbide (B[.sub]12[/]C[.sub]3[/]) and 
boron phosphide (B[.sub]12[/]P[.sub]2[/]) are materials 
which belong to boron modification of the a-rhombohedral type, 
and accordingly their physical properties can be understood in 
the same line as for _a_-rhombohedral boron. Their vibrational 
properties have recently been studied, in particular by Raman 
spectroscopy. With respect to optical properties, 
_a_-rhombohedral B is classified to uniaxial crystal, and hence 
the anisotropy of the vibrational properties is very important. 
The space group of the crystal is R3m and the crystal is not 
piezoelectric. Hence, Raman active vibrations are by no means 
polar modes. In Raman scattering, the standard procedure of 
group theory is valid for the identification of vibrations. 
Calculation of the scattering efficiency is straightforward and 
the peak frequencies are independent of the angle :gv between 
the wave vector of a phonon and the c-axis. 
  For IR spectra, on the contrary, the situation is a little 
different. Not only the intensity but the peak frequency depend 
the angle _th_. The degeneracy predicted by group theory is 
sometimes lifted due to the presence of the macroscopic electric 
field. An anisotropy of this kind is illustrated in the figure 
for two hypothetical cases. Figure (a) illustrates the case that 
the electrical interaction overcomes the anisotropy of the 
crystal, while figure (b) shows the case that the anisotropy of 
the crystal overcomes the electrical interaction. In the latter 
case, the anisotropy becomes appreciable in IR spectra. 
Effective charge is another aspect of anisotropy appearing in 
the charge distribution. This quantity is a measure of the 
separation between the TO and LO modes. 



<FIG ID=JPRS-JST-012L-23A>      Figure 1. Angular Dependence of the Phonon Frequency. (a) Electrical-interaction predominant; (b) Anisotropy </FIG>


   An anisotropy of such a kind has not been studied for these 
materials. Part of the reason is the difficulty of obtaining 
good-quality crystals. Another part lies in the measurement 
itself. For bulk crystals, only reflectance type is available 
for IR spectra, precise determination of the peak by 
Reststrahlen is relatively difficult, owing to its rather broad 
nature. For this purpose, it is more desirable to use the 
transmission-type spectroscopy for thin films. Technological 
development in thin film growth by molecular beam methods brings 
us the potential to solve this problem, good-quality 
B[.sub]12[/]P[.sub][/]2 singlecrystal will become to be 
available. 
  In the present paper, we represent preliminary discussion of 
vibrational properties, which will serve as an aid for the 
interpretation of vibrational spectra of boron-rich solids with 
rhombohedral structure.

<H5>  Introduction </H5>
  Superconducting alkali-metal doped f.c.c. C[.sub]60[/] 
attracts experimental and theoretical interests. While, among 
the icosahedral boron solids, both _a_- and _b_-rhombohedral 
boron have crystalline structures similar to that of f.c.c. 
C[.sub]60[/] in their dimensions, as well. The disparities, 
however, between them are listed as follows. 

  -  The interaction between the soccer-ball clusters is 
covalent in _b_-B. 
  -  The soccer-ball cage of _b_-B is not empty 
(2 icosahedra are in it). 
  -  As for doping sites of _b_-B 
rhombohedron, two tetrahedral sites have almost the same size as 
those in f.c.c. C[.sub]60[/], while octahedral site is 
occupied with another boron cluster (there are two other kinds 
of sites in _b_-B). 
  This paper reports the study on the electronic properties of 
icosahedral boron solids in the way of doping electrons from 
alkali metal and other groups of metal. 
<H5>  Experimental </H5>
  Alkali metal was evaporated and doped into _b_-B crystal 
in 
sealed glass tube.[.sup]1[/] Cu and Al doped samples were 
precipitated from B, Cu and Al melts (I. Higashi, et al.). X-ray 
diffraction analysis was carried out for structural 
investigation, conductivity was measured in van der Pauw method 
and magnetic susceptibility was obtained by SQUID. 
<H5>  Results and Discussion </H5>
  The measured conductivity showed a variable range hopping 
type conduction rather than thermal activation type one, and the 
values at room temperature increased with increasing Cu and Li 
concentration. The magnetic susceptibility obtained was the 
superposition of diamagnetic component and Curie-Weiss type 
paramagnetic one. Up to about 2at.% of Cu concentration 
and 
after Li doping, doped electron showed little contribution to 
each component. 
  To clarify these properties, the band scheme of _b_-B is 
drawn qualitatively as follows. A localized intrinsic acceptor 
level islocated above the valence band. This level is thought to 
be originated from a split-off intramolecular orbital of an 
electron deficient B[.sub]12[/] distorted by the Jahn-Teller 
effect. Since doped electron occupies only this level, neither 
metallic conduction nor magnetism (Pauli paramagnetism as in the 
case of alkali metal doped C[.sub]60[/]) is observed. In 
addition, formation of singlet bipolaron at the level may 
prevent the electron to contribute to localized magnetic moment. 
<H5>  Conclusion </H5>
  The crystalline structure of _b_-rhombohedral boron is 
essentially similar to that of f.c.c. C[.sub]60[/]. Doped 
electron in _b_-B shows variable range hopping type conduction 
and hardly contributes to magnetic susceptibility up to several 
atomic percentages. The electron occupies an intrinsic acceptor 
level originated from B[.sub]12[/] icosahedral cluster and 
may form bipolaron.

  [Text] We have studied the vapor phase growth of BP on 
sapphire to examine the mechanism of epitaxial growth and to 
perform direct measurements of semiconducting properties of BP 
single crystal, so that we have succeeded in growing BP single 
crystal film on sapphire for the first time. 
  The chemical vapor deposition (CVD) growth of BP on near 
(1120) oriented sapphire substrates was conducted by the thermal 
decomposition of a B[.sub]2[/]H[.sub]6[/]-PH[.sub]3[/] 
mixture in hydrogen atmosphere.[.sup]1[/] After the heat 
treatments of susceptor and the substrate,[.sup]1[/] growth 
was made at gas flow rates of 20, 500 and 2500cc/min, for 
B[.sub]2[/]H[.sub]6[/] (1% in H[.sub]2[/]), 
PH[.sub]3[/] (5% in H[.sub]2[/]) and H[.sub]2[/], 
respectively, in the temperature range of 800 to 1050ëC at a 
deposition time of 1.5hr. The films growing at the temperature 
ranges of 950 to 1050ëC, and 800 to 900ëC were colored 
orange-red and black, respectively. They were polycrystals 
except for the growth temperatures of 1000 and 1050ëC. The 
BP films grown at 1050ëC were peeled after several days to 
remain ultra thin film on substrate showing strike RHEED 
pattern. X-ray diffraction pattern of the peeled film was to be 
BP with the lattice constant of a[.sub]0[/]=4.54 Angstrom. 
The BP film grown on the ultra thin film indicated single 
crystalline RHEED pattern. Some areas showed similar RHEED 
pattern as that of BP on Si (111). The Si (111) grows 
epitaxially on Al[.sub]2[/]O[.sub]3[/] 
(1120),[.sub]2[/] suggesting that BP (111) would also grow on 
Al[.sub]2[/]O[.sub]3[/] (1120). But the surface of the 
films were not smooth. 
  The films grown at 1000ëC indicate highly oriented 
single 
crystalline pattern. In order to alter the crystal quality, we 
have adopted crystal growth by buffer BP layer at low 
temperatures (450-600ëC for 40-80 sec). After low 
temperature growth and annealing process at 1000ëC for 5 min 
under B[.sub]2[/] or PH[.sub]3[/] atmosphere, crystal 
growth was carried out at the temperature of 1000ëC under 
the above mentioned conditions. BP single crystalline layers 
were grown by growing buffer layer of BP at 550ëC and 
annealing at 1000ëC in hydrogen atmosphere, which is 
confirmed by X-ray diffraction and RHEED patterns. The 
orientation relationship was (111) BP/(0001) sapphire; [110] 
BP//[1120] sapphire, and [112] BP//[1010] sapphire, and (111) 
BP/-(1120) sapphire. 
  The obtained film exhibited p-type conductor. The Hall 
measurements by van der Pauw method indicate that the film with 
buffer layer has highermobility than that without buffer layer. 
Then the buffer layer would diminish the autodoping from the 
substrate. 
  This study was performed through Special Coordination Funds 
of the Science and Technology Agency of the Japanese Government.

  [Text] LaB[.sub]6[/] single crystals prepared by the FZ 
method are widely used as thermionic electron emitters. However, 
the crystal tips for the emitters must be cut out of the high 
quality parts because of subgrain boundaries. We reported that 
the boundary-free crystals were prepared by adding 
CeB[.sub]6[/], without any influence on the emission 
properties.[.sup]1,2[/] On the other hand, the boundaries 
were also removed from LaB[.sub]6[/] crystals by the 
traveling solvent floating zone method.[.sup]3[/] In this 
presentation, by using both of the above methods, the higher 
quality crystals were tried to be prepared. 
  The crystals were prepared in 7 atm of ambient argon gas by 
the RF- heating FZ method. The feed rod was prepared by 
sintering a mixture of LaB[.sub]6[/] and CeB[.sub]6[/] 
powders. The initial molten zone was formed by melting La and/or 
Ce metal lump. The growth rate was 0.5 cm/h. The grown crystals 
were 0.9 cm in diameter and 6 cm long. 
  Distribution of La, Ce and B was examined at the growing 
interface. The Ce content in the crystal increased by 10% 
due 
to evaporation, compared with the feed rod. The cases where the 
boundary-free crystals were obtained are shown as circles in 
Figure l. By using both methods, the amounts of added 
CeB[.sub]6[/] and La/Ce flux were decreased. Consequently, 
the strain of lattices and the void densities in the crystals 
decreased to be less than half.

  [Text] The K-V (K_a_) X-ray emission 
(fluorescence) spectra are emitted by the electric dipole 
transition of an electron from 2p to 1s 
orbital after the photoionization of one of the 1s 
electron (V denotes valence hole state). The 
2p orbitals of boron, carbon, nitrogen, and fluorine 
form valence molecular orbitals (i.e., a valence band) in the 
compounds. Therefore the K-V X-ray line shapes 
represent the local (X-ray emitting atom) and partial 
(2p) electron density of states (DOS) of the 
compounds. The discrete-variational (DV) Hartree-Fock-Slater 
(X_a_) calculations of carbon 2p DOS of 
various carbon compounds have successfully reproduced the 
measured carbon K-V X-ray line shapes of benzene, 
C[.sub]60[/],[.sup]1[/] C[.sub]70[/],[.sup]2[/] 
graphite, and diamond.[.sup]3[/] We then extend these 
calculations to various boron compounds in the present paper. 
The boron 2p DOS of various boron compounds (B, 
B[.sub]4[/]C, BN, B[.sub]2[/]O[.sub]3[/], 
B[.sub]6[/]O, BF[.sub]3[/], ...) are calculated by the 
DV-X_a_ method with a cluster-molecule approximation, 
where, e.g., B[.sub]12[/] molecule is calculated in place of 
a solid boron. The calculated B 2p DOS is compared 
with the measured X-ray emission spectra in the literature, 
resulting in satisfactory agreement between the calculation and 
the experiment.

  [Text] Recently, several X-ray emission threshold 
experiments have been attempted to elucidate satellite 
structures in X-ray emission spectra using monochromatized 
synchrotron radiation.[.sup]1,2[/] The satellite structure in 
BK_a_ emission spectra of boron oxide and boron nitride is 
particularly interesting because the origin of the high- energy 
satellites is not predicted from DV-X_a_ molecular orbital 
calculations.[.sup]3[/] The aim of this study is to 
investigate the satellite structure in the BK_a_ emission 
spectra of the boron compounds from threshold experiments using 
highly brilliant undulator radiation as an excitation probe. 
  Spectroscopic measurements were carried out on a fluorescent 
X-ray spectrometer of sophisticated design[.sup]4,5[/] 
installed on an undulator beamline (BL-16U)[.sup]6,7[/] at 
the Photon Factory. 
  A prominent increase in the high-energy satellite peak 
heights was first observed when the excitation energy was tuned 
to the narrow pre-edge peak in the B1s absorption spectrum 
corresponding to the transition from B(1s) to an unoccupied 
anti-bonding orbital (pã*). It is therefore confirmed that 
the 
high-energy satellites originate from resonant reemission due to 
a B(1s)-pã* -B(1s[.sup]-l[/]) transition. This resonant 
reemission phenomenon reflects the electric structure of the 
localized anti-bonding pã* orbital in

  [Text] The effect of micro and nanostructure effects on the 
mechanical properties such as hardness, fracture strength, 
toughness and high-temperature strength were investigated for 
the monolithic B[.sub]4[/]C and B[.sub]4[/]C/SiC, 
B[.sub]4[/]C/TiB[.sub]2[/] and 
B[.sub]4[/]C/SiC/TiB[.sub]2[/] composites. These 
composites were fabricated by hot-pressing the homogeneous 
mixtures of B[.sub]4[/]C, SiC and TiC powders in Ar 
atmosphere at 1900ë to 2200ëC. X-ray diffraction 
analysis indicated that the TiB[.sub]2[/] was formed by 
reacting the TiC with B[.sub]4[/]C during sintering. Scanning 
and high resolution transmission electron microscopic 
observation revealed that the finer SiC and TiB[.sub]2[/] 
grains less than 100nm were mainly dispersed within the 
B[.sub]4[/]C matrix grains, although the larger grains were, 
of course, located at the grain boundaries of B[.sub]4[/]C 
grains. 
  It is well known that the intragranular nanosized grains 
improved remarkably the mechanical properties, in particular, 
the fracture strength even at high temperatures in the composite 
systems such as Al[.sub]2[/]O[.sub]3[/]/SiC, 
Al[.sub]2[/]O[.sub]3[/]/Si[.sub]3[/]N[.sub]4[/], 
MgO/SiC, mullite/SiC, Al[.sub]2[/]O[.sub]3[/]/TiC and 
Si[.sub]3[/]N[.sub]4[/]/SiC. As expected from the results 
reported for these composites, the nanosized TiB[.sub]2[/] 
and SiC strongly improved the mechanical properties of 
B[.sub]4[/]C. The fracture toughness and strength were over 
two times improved as compared with those of monolithic 
B[.sub]4[/]C. And the improved strength and toughness did not 
degradate up to the temperatures of 1200ë to 1300ëC even 
in the air atmosphere. 
  In this presentation, the processes micro- and nanostructure 
mechanical properties relationship will be discussed in detail. 
Special emphasis will be placed on the understanding of the 
nanosized dispersion effects.

  [Text] Ti(C,N)-TiB[.sub]2[/] ceramics which are 
developed by us can be used for cutting tools and wear-resistant 
materials.[.sup]1,2[/] Although Ti(C,N)-TiB[.sub]2[/] 
ceramics cutting tools have long lives in carbon steel cutting, 
they have too low fracture toughness K[.sub]IC[/] to be used 
for intermittent and conventional cutting. So, the effects of 
the additives m- ZrO[.sub]2[/] and t-ZrO[.sub]2[/] which 
was partially stabilized by 2mol%Y[.sub]2[/]O[.sub]3[/] 
addition and stabilized by 12mol%CeO[.sub]2[/] addition on 
mechanical properties of Ti(C,N)- 
TiB[.sub]2[/]-ZrO[.sub]2[/] ceramics were made clear 
firstly. As the result, it was found that 40% addition of 
m-ZrO[.sub]2[/] to Ti(C,N)-TiB[.sub]2[/] system could 
increase a fracture toughness K[.sub]IC[/] from 3.2 to 7.5 
MPam[.sup]1/2[/], also addition of t-ZrO[.sub]2[/] which 
were stabilized by 2mol%Y[.sub]2[/]O[.sub]3[/] and 
12mol%CeO[.sub]2[/] could increase the fracture toughness 
K[.sub]IC[/] from 2.3 to 4.5 and to 4 MPa[.sup]1/2[/], 
respectively. Next, it was investigated how the amount of 
m-ZrO[.sub]2[/] affects the mechanical properties of 
Ti(C,N)-TiB[.sub]2[/]-m-ZrO ceramics. As the results, 
Ti(C,N)- TiB[.sub]2[/]-m-ZrO[.sub]2[/] ceramics containing 
over 30wt% m- ZrO[.sub]2[/] have higher fracture toughness 
than 6 MPam[.sup]1/2[/]. It is thought that a high fracture 
toughness K[.sub]IC[/] caused from t in phase 
transformation and difference of thermal expansion between 
ZrO[.sub]2[/] and the matrix of TiB[.sub]2[/] and Ti(C,N).

  [Text] Plasma-assisted coating of boron thin films, 
so-called ``boronization'', has been recently used in magnetic 
confinement fusion devices. This technique is a very powerful 
means to reduce contamination of a hot fusion plasma by oxygen 
and metal impurities released from vessels. On a technical side, 
however, some difficulties remain: 
  1) the use of highly toxic and explosive gas diborane 
(B[.sub]2[/]H[.sub]6[/]) requires considerable efforts for 
safe handling; 
  2) boron films are not uniformly coated because of extremely 
large devices; 
  3) removal of degraded boron films is necessary after 
long-term use. 
  In this paper, we present new methods of boronization 
developed in a small-scale laboratory experiment. First of all, 
we have proposed the use of a much less hazardous boride, 
decaborane (B[.sub]10[/]H[.sub]14[/] 99.7ëC mp, 
213ëC bp)[.sup]1,2[/] and the technique has been 
successfully applied to the JT-60U, one of the largest three 
fusion devices in the world. A hydrogen atom content in boron 
thin films was measured by [.sup]15[/]N resonant nuclear 
reaction and the analysis revealed a rapid decrease in the H 
content with increasing deposition temperature (150-300ëC). 
  Secondly, a scaling law for nonuniformity of boron film 
deposition has been investigated with a pressure and a discharge 
current as parameters. The measured dependence of the e-folding 
length for the nonuniformity agreed with a prediction in a 
one-dimensional fluid model for plasma chemical vapor deposition 
(CVD). 
  Thirdly, boron thin films were deposited by thermal 
decomposition (pyrolysis) of decaborane in the absence of a glow 
plasma. High deposition rates on a hot wall (ò 350ëC) were 
obtained with the activation energy of 39 kcal/mol. 
  Finally, we proposed in situ boronization by injecting a 
decaborane pellet into a hot fusion plasma. A small pellet of 
solid decaborane can easily be fabricated by warming up and 
pressing a decaborane crystal into a small hole.

  [Text] Due to the resemblance of the crystalline structure 
between graphite and hexagonal BN, the generation of new curious 
properties, both electrical and optical, are expected by 
synthesizing the hybrid ceramic alloy such as BCN. 
  In the several investigations[.sup]1-4[/] on the 
preparation of BCN by the chemical vapor deposition (CVD) 
method, BCl[.sub]3[/] and NH[.sub]3[/] have been used 
mainly as boron and nitrogen source materials, respectively. 
Materials such as C[.sub]2[/]H[.sub]2[/], CH[.sub]3[/], 
C[.sub]3[/]H[.sub]8[/], and CCl[.sub]4[/], have been 
used as carbon sources. 
  In this paper, BCN films are deposited by metal organic CVD 
using triethylboron (TEB) and ammonia as a source materials. The 
apparatus used in this experiment is a horizontal type quartz 
reaction tube (50_P_ x 500L) with an external heating 
electrical 
furnace. Silicon and fused quartz plate (12 x 12 x 
0.4mm[.sup]3[/]) are used as substrate and are set on a 
graphite pedestal at an angle of 3ë to the horizon. The 
substrate temperature was 700[.sub]c[/]C to 1050ëC and 
the ratio of TEB to NH[.sub]3[/] was 0 to 10. Hydrogen or 
argon was used as the carrier gas of TEB and its effect to the 
films deposited was examined. 
  The composition of the films deposited at 750ëC using 
hydrogen carrier gas is shown in Figure 1 as a function of molar 
ratio of ammonia to TEB. The composition is determined by 
electron probe microanalyzer (EPMA). Nitrogen content in the 
film increases with increasing ammonia steeply at first and then 
gently at above NH[.sub]3[/]/TEB=0.8. The contents of boron 
and carbon in the film decrease with increasing ammonia. From 
this result, it is suggested that the ratio of the three 
components in the film is controlled by the ratio of ammonia to 
TEB. X- ray diffractograms of deposits show very wide 
diffraction line corresponding to 002 planes of hexagonal BN and 
graphite. The deposits seem to be microcrystalline or amorphous.

  [Text] Pulse laser induced breakdown technique has been 
used to synthesize fine powders. The dielectric gas 
breakdown[.sup]1[/] creates a plasma and subsequent chemical 
reaction even where a resonant condition does not exist. The 
CO[.sub]2[/] laser beam (wavelength: 9.6 æm, pulsewidth: 2 
æsec, pulse energy: 0.4-1.5 J) was focused by a 
BaF[.sub]2[/] lens through a KBr window into a glass reaction 
cell filled with raw material gas. B, TiB[.sub]2[/], and 
B[.sub]4[/]C powders were prepared from 
BCl[.sub]3[/]+H[.sub]2[/], 
BCl[.sub]3[/]+TiCl[.sub]4[/]+H[.sub]2[/], and 
BBr[.sub]3[/]+CH[.sub]4[/]+H[.sub]2[/] gas mixture 
respectively. The particulate materials were characterized by 
scanning electron microscopy, ICP atomic emission spectroscopy, 
and X-ray and electron diffraction. It was found that the 
short-range order structure of boron powders deposited on a cold 
reaction wall was similar to that of 
_b_-rhombohedral.[.sup]2[/] Produced TiB[.sub]2[/] and 
B[.sub]4[/]C were crystalline. The particles were 
monodispersed and the particle sizes of the powders were 0.1-0.3 
æm. The yields of powder were increased linearly with 
increasing laser pulse energy, whereas average particle size was 
independent of energy. The threshold of breakdown in the gas 
mixture of total pressure of 250 Torr was about 600 
J/cm[.sup]2[/] and was inversely proportional to the total 
pressure of the gas in a logarithmic scale, and the proportional 
constant was -0.52 for BCl[.sub]3[/]+H[.sub]2[/]. About 
90% of incident pulse energy was absorbed by plasma in the 
reactant gas.

  [Text] The crystal chemistry of the Er-Rh-B system has 
received considerable attention from researchers in the fields 
of magnetism and superconductivity. As shown in Figure 1 three 
ternary borides exist at Rh-rich composition. The present paper 
reports the crystal growth and crystal structure, and magnetic 
and superconducting properties of the ternary compounds. 

<FIG ID=JPRS-JST-012L-29A>      Figure 1. Phase Diagram of Er-Rh-B System (Rh corner) </FIG>


  The single crystals of ternary borides were successfully 
grown by the flux method using a molten copper as a solvent. The 
reagents used were 99.9% pure Er, 99.9% pure Rh 
and 99.8% 
pure B. They were weighed in stoichiometric proportion and mixed 
with 99.999% pure Cu in a weight ratio between 1:8 and 
1:10. 
The mixture was placed in a recrystallized alumina crucible. The 
crucible was inserted in a vertical electric furnace. A purified 
He gas flow was used as a protecting atmosphere against 
oxidation. The mixture of starting materials was heated at a 
rate of 400ëCh[.sup]-1[/], held at 1350ë[.sub]c[/] 
for 10h, and then slowly cooled down at a rate of 
1ëCh[.sup]-1[/]. After the temperature reached 
1080ëC, the furnace was rapidly cooled down to room 
temperature. The crystals were separated by dissolving Cu in 
dilute nitric acid. 
  ErRh[.sub]3[/]B[.sub]2[/]: Hexagonal rods of 
silver metallic luster were obtained. The crystal structure of 
the ErRh[.sub]3[/]B[.sub]2[/] belongs to a monoclinic 
system isomorphous with ErIr[.sub]3[/]B[.sub]2[/] type 
structure. Lattice parameters of the 
ErRh[.sub]3[/][.sup]11[/]B[.sub]2[/] are a=5.3547(3) 
Angstrom, b=9.2824(5) Angstrom, c=3.1017(2) Angstrom, 
_b_=90.893(5) Angstrom, V=154.15(2) Angstrom[.sup]3[/]. This 
compound shows strongly anisotropic properties and takes a 
ferromagnetic ordering at 27K with its easy axis along the 
c-direction. 
  ErRh[.sub]4[/]B[.sub]4[/]: Needle like 
rectangulars of silver metallic luster were obtained. The 
crystal structure is primitive tetragonal with the 
CeCO[.sub]4[/]B[.sub]4[/] type. The lattice parameters are 
a=5.304(1) and c=7.395(2) Angstrom. This compound is interesting 
because of the coexistence of superconductivity and 
ferromagnetism in it. From the electrical resistivity 
measurement, the superconducting transition temperature is found 
to be 8.55K with thetransition width _D_T[.sub]c1[/] = 3OmK. 
The reentrant transition temperature T[.sub]c2[/] is 0.84K 
for cooling run. The residual resistivity ratio 
RRR=(300K)/R(T[.sub]c1[/]) is 7.8. 
  ErRh[.sub]3[/]B: Silver metallic luster cubes were 
obtained. This compound has a cubic perovskite structure. The 
lattice parameter is a=4.146(1) Angstrom. This compound exhibits 
normal paramagnetic behavior.

  [Text] Boron nitride (BN) having a graphite-like layer 
structure usually crystallizes into hexagonal form (hBN) with a 
two-layered stacking sequence AA'AA'. Another BN with 
three-layered sequence ABCABC like rhombohedral graphite 
(rhombohedral boron nitride, rBN) has been known to be produced 
in coexistence with hBN under particular synthetic conditions. 
It has been found that the rBN structure was formed due to an 
effect of monovalent anions in such systems, and the synthetic 
method of pure rBN was established based on these 
findings.[.sup]1[/] In the present study, it will be shown 
that the effect of anions on the formation of rBN decreases 
systematically in an anion series, to offer an evidence of our 
proposed mechanism of rBN formation. 
<H5>  Experiment </H5>
  An 1:1.1 (mol) mixture of sodium tetrahydroborate 
(NaBH[.sub]4[/]) and ammonium chloride (NH[.sub]4[/]Cl) 
was heated at 600ëC in N[.sub]2[/] for 10 minutes, washed 
with water and methanol to remove coproduced NaCl after it had 
cooled down. The BN precursor thus obtained was mixed with a 
series of anions in the forms of NaF, NaCl, NaBr, NaI, and KCN, 
respectively, and heated at 900ëC and 1000ëC for 10 
hours in N[.sub]2[/]. The recovered samples were examined by 
X-ray diffractometry, scanning electron microscope (SEM) and IR 
and Raman spectroscopy after they were treated with water to 
remove salts. 
<H5>  Results </H5>
  The precursor was composed of BN containing traces of NaCl, 
and obtained in 80% yield. It showed a typical diffraction 
pattern of turbostratic structure with broad 00l, and 
10 peaks. The structure of the precursor was changed to rBN 
after it was heated with KCN, NaF or NaCl. The rBN peaks, 101 at 
42.6ë (2_th_ CuK_a_) and 012 at 45.5ë other than 
00l peaks relating to interlayer distances were 
clearly observed. The intensity and sharpness of these peaks 
decreased according to the above order of the three salts. 
Traces of those peaks were observed in the sample treated with 
NaBr, and could not in the case of Ani. 
  It is concluded that the catalytic power to produce rBN 
decreases according to the order of the following anion series: 
CN, F, Cl, Br, I. The series coincides, with the well-known 
order of coordination strength of anions, and the fact strongly 
supports the formation mechanism of rBN based on the 
coordination of anions.

  [Text] Polycrystalline boron films were deposited by plasma 
assisted chemical vapor deposition. The source gas was diborane 
or trichloroboron. The structure of film was characterized by 
transmission electron beam diffraction. The optical energy gap 
was estimated from the energy dispersion of photo-absorption 
coefficient. The electrical properties were determined from Hall 
measurement. 
  Figure 1 shows the schematic representation of deposition 
system. Reaction chamber was made from quartz tube with the 
diameter of 42 cm. The RF power was applied by a couple of ring 
electrodes. The frequency was 13.56 MHz. The diborane gas was 
diluted to 5% with hydrogen gas. The substrate 
temperature was 
600-900ëC.

  [Text] A new type of MO[.sub]2[/]NiB[.sub]2[/]boride 
base hard alloys[.sup]1[/] was developed by the authors. The 
new hard alloys consist of a MO[.sub]2[/]NiB[.sub]2[/] 
type boride as a hard phase and a nickel base binder alloyed 
with Cr, Mo and other elements, both of which are formed by a 
boride forming reaction during liquid phase sintering. 
  Mechanical properties and microstructure of the new hard 
alloys were studied by using 
Ni-6wt%B-58.6wt%Mo-Xwt%Cr model 
alloys. Microstructure of the new hard alloys considerably 
affected mechanical properties of those. The maximum transverse 
rupture strength (TRS) of 2.3 GPa is obtained at lOwt%Cr 
content. Crystal structure of a MO[.sub]2[/]NiB[.sub]2[/] 
type boride changes from the orthorhombic 
M[.sub]3[/]B[.sub]2[/] (M:Metal) at Owt%Cr content to the 
tetragonal M[.sub]3[/]B[.sub]2[/] at lOwt%Cr content. 
High TRS value at lOwt%Cr is attributed to the formation 
of the 
tetragonal M[.sub]3[/]B[.sub]2[/] type boride. The 
Rietveld structure analysis of X-ray powder diffraction data of 
the borides resulted that the orthorhombic 
M[.sub]3[/]B[.sub]2[/] type boride classified in space 
group D[.sup]25[/][.sub]2h[/]-I[.sub]mmm[/], which is 
similar to the result of the orthorhombic 
W[.sub]2[/]CoB[.sub]2[/] type boride,[.sup]2[/] and 
the, tetragonal M[.sub]3[/]B[.sub]2[/] type boride in 
space group D[.sup]5[/][.sub]4h[/]-P [.sub]4/mbm[/]. 
  It is concluded that Cr addition causes crystal structural 
change of boride from orthorhombic to tetragonal 
M[.sub]3[/]B[.sub]2[/] type boride, and improves 
mechanical properties of the new hard alloys. The result of 
transmission electron microscopy (TEM) of the new hard alloys 
will be reported.

  [Text] Refractory borides have not only the high resistance 
to thermals and chemicals, but also the special characteristics 
as thermal electron radiation and superconductivity. Because the 
borides have an availability as a functional electronic 
material, rapid progress has been made in recent years. Although 
synthesis method and evaluation method on crystals and thick 
films have been studied,[.sup]1-3[/] analytical methods for 
the evaluation of synthesized borides are not established. We 
have prepared a series of oxide standards for the analysis of 
impurities in the boride,[.sup]4[/] and have determined the 
impurities in the synthesized boride crystals and thick films. 
  A series of oxide standards containing impurities of 
0.0018-0.2080% Cr, Mn, Fe, Co, Ni, Cu, and Zn were 
prepared by 
adding measured quantities of standard solutions containing the 
above elements to X-ray fluorescently pure B, P, Zr and Ti 
solutions.[.sup]4[/] After the solutions were evaporated to 
dryness in a crucible on a hotplate, the precursor of the oxide 
standards were heated with an electric furnace to 600ëC for 
12 hours at a constant heating rate of 50ëC/hour. 
  Calibration curves related log I/C and log E were obtained 
by 
the X-ray fluorescence method with the standards mentioned 
above. Where I is X-ray intensity, C is concentration of 
measured impurities, and E is X-ray energy. Standard deviation 
and coefficients of correlations of the curves were 
0.0082-0.0128 and 0.990-0.999, respectively. It was found that 
crystals of TiB[.sub]2[/] and ZrB[.sub]2[/] synthesized by 
the zone refining method had less impurities than those of 
powder type raw materials.

  [Text] The ternary system ErRh[.sub]3[/]B[.sub]2[/] 
is known to be ferromagnetic and to crystallize in a 
basecentered monoclinic structure (space group C2/m), 
which is slightly distorted from hexagonal symmetry. Recent 
X-ray and magnetic susceptibility studies[.sup]1,2[/]) show 
that the system is more complex. 
  From powder X-ray diffraction the lattice constants of 
ErRh[.sub]3[/][.sup]11[/]B[.sub]2[/] were determined to 
be a = 5,3547(3) Angstrom; b = 9,2824(5) Angstrom; c = 3,1017(2) 
Angstrom and _b_ = 90,893(5) Angstrom.[.sup]2[/] X-ray 
oscillation film technique observations on a single crystal of 
ErRh[.sub]3[/]B[.sub]2[/] show a superstructure with a six 
doubling of the c-axis.[.sup]1[/] 
  Magnetization measurements show considerable anisotropy. At 
T[.sub]N[/] = 27 K, the data indicates ferromagnetic order 
with the spins directed parallel to the c-axis. However, the 
magnetization curve shows a maximum at 27 K. The magnetization 
decreases on further cooling and ends up at a value of 
75% of 
it's maximum value. In order to investigate both the crystal and 
the magnetic structure, initial investigations of 
ErRh[.sub]3[/][.sup]11[/]B[.sub]2[/] has been performed 
on a four-circle neutron diffractometer using neutrons of 
wavelength 1,013 Angstrom. Scans parallel to the 
c[.sup]*[/]-axis indicated clearly a doubling of the c-axis, 
but no six doubling was seen. However, the resolution was too 
low to eliminate the presence of additional satellite 
reflections. 
  At 15 K we observed strong ferromagnetic scattering. In 
addition we observed some scattering at (010), (030) and (100), 
all three of them systematically extinct above T[.sub]N[/]. 
There also seemed to be weak scattering at 
(0[.sub]3[/][.sup]4[/]0) and 
(0[.sub]3[/][.sup]8[/]0). This indicates that the magnetic 
ordering is not a simple ferromagnet. 
  Experiments on a triple axis spectrometer, using cold 
neutrons(_l_ = 4 Angstrom) are planned. In this experiment we 
expect to be able to resolve the crystalline superstructure and 
follow the magnetic scattering as a function of temperature.

  [Text] There are two different and complementary approaches 
to study electronic structure of solids, i.e., band theory and 
the molecular orbital (MO) method. The MO cluster calculations 
which treat a small fraction of a crystal can clarify the aspect 
of chemical bond correlated with the electronic structures, 
providing the description in the real space. The MO approach is 
more desirable for understanding of boron and boron-rich 
compound solids containing the icosahedron because of their 
rather complicated crystal structure. Indeed, the concept of the 
MO's in the icosahedral B[.sub]12[/] unit successfully 
explains the properties of these materials: insulating property, 
stability of the structure of _a_-rhombohedral B type, and 
forming of the so-called three-center bond. This groundwork was 
done by Longuet-Higgins and Roberts many years ago.[.sup]1[/] 
Although their discussion on the electronic structure is 
complete from the standpoint of symmetry properties, there 
remains difficulty of numerical estimation yet. 
  Numerical calculations will reveal detailed electronic 
structures of boron and bring us a quantitative account for the 
trends in physical properties among the boron-rich compounds 
(e.g., insulating or semiconducting characters). There is 
another reason to perform such calculations. Many experiments 
show that amorphous boron also belongs to semiconductor, even 
though there has been so far reported no explicit evidence of 
long periods of covalent-bond sequence in the amorphous phase. 
This suggests importance of the short-range order for character 
of these material. Therefore, it is interesting to examine 
change in the electronic structure with various parameters, such 
as bond length and local symmetry. 
  We perform cluster calculations for the electronic structure 
of _a_-rhombohedral boron, using the discrete-variation (DV) 
X_a_ method. To carry out this study, it is very important to 
construct a proper model of the cluster. We adopt, as a first 
step, the cluster of icosahedral B[.sub]12[/] with the 
nearest neighbor atoms as shown in the figure. Six boron atoms 
are attached to the rhombohedral vertices of the centered 
icosahedron and twelve boron atoms are attached to the 
equatorial sites. Boron atoms of the latter group form the 
three-center bond in the x-y plane. Each boron atom of the 
nearest neighbor of the icosahedron is terminated by two 
hydrogen atoms, the geometry of which is determined by reference 
to the diborane molecule.

  [Text] The crystal structure of 
B[.sub]13[/]P[.sub]2[/] has been determined to be the 
_a_-rhombohedral boron structure with two phosphorous atoms 
(partly replaced by boron) in a unit cell from X-ray 
diffraction.[.sup]1[/] We measured P 3p electron density of 
states (DOS) of B[.sub]13[/]P[.sub]2[/] by X-ray emission 
spectroscopy.[.sup]2[/] 
  We calculate the P 3p DOS of three structures of 
B[.sub]13[/]P[.sub]2[/]: (a) the two P sites are fully 
occupied by P, (b) one of the P sites is replaced by B and (c) 
one of the P sites is vacant. In Figure 1, the calculated DOS 
are compared with the measured P 3p DOS. It is found from Figure 
1 that the experiment remarkably agrees with model (c), but does 
not agree with model (a) nor (b). Consequently one of the P 
sites is vacant and is not replaced by B. We conclude that the 
structure of B[.sub]13[/]P[.sub]2[/] is that shown in 
Figure 2.

  [Text] In the crystallography, it is assumed that an ideal 
crystal is constructed by the infinite repetition of identical 
structural units in space. Therefore, a five-fold axis of 
symmetry cannot exist in a periodic lattice because it is not 
possible to fill all space with a connected array of pentagons. 
However, in 1984, Scechtman, et al.[.sup]1[/] found a 
material with icosahedral point symmetry in a rapidly solidified 
Al-Mn alloy. This is the first discovery of ``Quasicrystal.'' 
Since the discovery, quasicrystals have been found in many 
kinds, but only metallic alloy systems.[.sup]2[/] It is 
interesting to inquire whether a quasicrystalline structure can 
be stable in a covalent bonding system. Boron-rich solids with 
B[.sub]12[/] icosahedral clusters are great candidates for a 
semiconducting quasicrystal. This is because the icosahedral 
point symmetry is typical for quasicrystalline structure. 
  We analyzed the crystalline structure of the 
_a_-rhombohedral 
boron as a 0/1-2/0 rhombohedral approximant structure of the 
icosahedral quasicrystal, and then constructed the _a_-boron 
type quasicrystal. The cohesive energy of the _a_-, 
_b_-rhombohedral boron and the _a_-boron type quasicrystal 
was 
estimated using a molecular orbital total energy calculation. 
According to the calculation, realization of the _a_-boron type 
quasicrystal is expected. 
  Experimental search for semiconducting quasicrystal has been 
done in the B-C system. The distortion of B[.sub]12[/] is 
smallest in the B-C system. If the B[.sub]12[/] cluster is 
distorted spontaneously, there is no reason why the icosahedral 
symmetry grows. This is why we chose the B-C system. Amorphous 
films of B[.sub]100-x[/]C[.sub]x[/] (x=3,5 and 7) were 
prepared by an electron-beam evaporation technique. Then they 
were examined for the transformation by heat treatment. This is 
because most of the metallic quasicrystals have been found as a 
metastable phase in a nonequilibrium process. We found a new 
phase in the annealing process. The electron and X-ray 
diffraction patterns from the phase are identified to be that of 
the 1/0-1/0-0/1 orthorhombic crystalline approximant of the 
icosahedral quasicrystal. In many cases, the crystalline 
approximants have been found near the composition or temperature 
range in which the quasicrystal is formed. Therefore, it is 
possible to realize the semiconducting quasicrystal in 
boron-rich solids.

  [Text] In our previous works[.sup]1,2[/] short-range 
order (SRO) structures of amorphous boron's (a-boron) were 
analyzed by the radial distribution function (RDF) method. The 
a-boron samples analyzed were metallic boron films, 
whisker-like, and fiber prepared by thermal chemical vapor 
deposition (CVD),[.sup]1[/] and fine powders deposited at 
ambient (room) temperature by a laser-induced dielectric 
breakdown (LIDB) reaction.[.sup]2[/] It was found that the 
SRO structures as observed on the reduced RDF's, 
G(r)[.sub]obs[/]'S, gave similar undulations to those derived 
from the _b_-rhombohedral boron structure regardless of the 
differences in their appearance and growth conditions. 
  In the present work, we have studied by using the same 
method 
the following various types of a-boron different from those 
described above: 
  i) Reddish brown powders of Moissan boron[.sup]3[/] 
produced by Mg metallothermic reduction of boron oxide: MTR. 
  ii) Metallic thin films deposited at 530ëC at low 
pressure as 0.1 Pa (7.5 x 10[.sup]-4[/] torr) of a mixed gas 
of B[.sub]2[/]H[.sub]6[/]+H[.sub]2[/] (30% in 
B[.sub]2[/]H[.sub]6[/]) by the electron cyclotron 
resonance (ECR) plasma CVD method[.sup]4,5[/]: LPCVD. 
  iii) Metallic thin films vacuum deposited (10[.sup]-6[/] 
torr) from sintered Moissan boron by irradiation of electron 
beams (acceleration voltage: 4 kV, I[.sub]emis[/]: 
110 mA): PVD. 
  iv) Dark brown films vacuum deposited (10[.sup]-6[/] 
torr) by laser ablation of metallic boron (ND:YAG laser, 10 Hz, 
pulse energy: 0.1 J, pulse width: 4ns): LPVD. 
  The SRO structures of a-boron here obtained are almost the 
same as those published previously. Thus the SRO structure of 
a-boron does not depend on the preparative methods and the boron 
sources. These remind the term ``Ideal'' amorphous 
state.[.sup]6[/] The SRO structure is 
recapitulated[.sup]1[/] that the a-boron has a short range 
order in that the B[.sub]12[/] icosahedra are linked along 
their pseudo-fivefold axes with a rotation of up to ã/5 with 
respect to each other (out of phase).

  [Text] Doping mechanism has been an actual problem of 
physics and chemistry of boron-rich compounds. This is a 
non-standard problem because of their complex lattices. The 
results of MgAlB[.sub]14[/] structure and doping study are 
summarized in this paper. MgAlB[.sub]14[/] was prepared by 
the solution melting method, Fe introduction (2 at%) was 
made 
in the process of hot pressing in vacuum. 
  There are two types of voids I and II in the 
MgAlB[.sub]14[/] lattice: I is occupied by Mg and surrounded 
by 16 B atoms at 2,379-2,925 Angstrom (filling 78%), II is 
occupied by Al and surrounded by 12 B atom at 2,0663[sic]-2,824 
Angstrom (filling 75%). Thus, the II void has a lower 
size and 
a lower symmetry. 
  The Mossbauer spectrum of MgAlB[.sub]14[/] represents a 
single line (isomer shift ø = 0,12mms[.sup]-1[/] and 
doublet (ø = 1,8mms[.sup]-1[/], quadropoule splitting _D_ = 
1mms[.sup]-1[/]. This means that Fe[.sup]+3[/] localized 
in I voids instead of Mg is a donor but Fe[.sup]+2[/] 
localized in II voids is an acceptor. The concentration ratio 
Fe[.sup]+3[/]/Fe[.sup]+2[/] = 3:1 which, as a result of 
compensation, leads to donor action. It is supported by the 
thermoelectric power: S = 400 æVK[.sup]-1[/] and 10 
æVK[.sup]- 1[/] (300K) for undoped and doped material, 
respectively.

<F P=106> [Article by Hidenaka Kato, staff writer] </F>
  [Text] Four foreign aerospace firms will join the 
government-backed project to produce the YSX passenger jet, 
Ministry of Trade and Industry officials said last week. The 
plane would be the first commercial airliner produced by Japan's 
aircraft industry since 1972. 
  Three Western companies -- Boeing Co. of the U.S., Aviation 
de Transport Regional, a French-Italian joint venture and 
Saab-Scania AB of Sweden -- plus the state-run Aviation 
Industries of China will this year join feasibility studies for 
the mid-range YSX aircraft, say the officials. 
  Since halting production of the short-range YS11 passenger 
aircraft in 1972, the Japanese aerospace industry has long 
talked of producing another commercial plane. The YSX, aimed to 
begin service early next century, has a capacity for 70-80 
passengers and a cruising range of between 1,000-1,300 nautical 
miles (1,800-2,400 km). 
  The foreign participation is seen as vital -- particularly 
that of Chinese. The Japan Aircraft Development Corp. (JADC), a 
private consortium backed by MITI, always aimed to attract 
partners with big markets. 
  Industry estimates suggest that China will need up to 800 
airplanes in the next 15 years and will become the world's 
third-largest aviation market next to the U.S. and Japan. That 
demand would make ready-made sales for mid-range regional jets 
like the YSX. 
  Foreign partnerships should also help reduce development 
costs, estimated to total &yen;80 billion ($708 million). 
  MITI, together with JADC, launched the first feasibility 
study in 1989. Since then almost &yen;400 million has been spent 
on the project. 
  For fiscal 1994, starting next April, MITI plans to allocate 
&yen;1.6 billion for the YSX regional jetliner with another 
&yen;800 million coming from the private sector members of JADC. 
  The foreign firms are expected to become full members of the 
development team in fiscal 1995, although no concrete agreements 
have yet been made on the partners' status when the feasibility 
study finishes, said a MITI official. JADC hopes to start 
engineering the YSX in 1997. 
  The non-Japanese companies hope to take advantage of the 
growing demand for small passenger aircraft, industry observers 
explained. Boeing, the world's largest aircraft builder, for 
example, currently has no airplanes with less than 100 seats. 
  JADC estimates a total of 650 airplanes with less than 100 
seats will be needed on the world market during the first decade 
of the next century. At least 300-400 orders would be required 
for the project to break even. 
  There are considerable risks. Many European aircraft 
builders 
are also trying to enter the small-to-mid-range jet market and 
have projects for planes with less than 100 seats already 
up-and-running. Both Saab and ATR have independently-launched 
projects to develop aircraft similar in size to the YSX. That 
could, fear Japanese officials, marginalize their involvement in 
the YSX project. 
  Those with long memories will also point to the previous 
Japanese commercial airliner, the YS11, a 75-seat plane, which 
was a commercial flop. 
  European manufacturers are already touting their own 
commuter 
aircraft on the Japanese market. Nichimen Corp., Japan's 
second-tier trading house, will carry out demonstration flights 
of German Dolnier 328 in Tokyo and Okinawa in March, hoping to 
win orders. Bombardier Inc. of Canada has also proposed a 50 
seater small aircraft.

<H5>  1. Introduction </H5>
  The world's deepest drop shaft facility for microgravity 
experiments, using a former coal mine shaft, was constructed at 
Kamisunagawa, Hokkaido, Japan, in 1991. This drop shaft has a 
free fall depth of 490 m and a total depth of 710 m. Unlike 
similar facilities in the U.S. and Europe, which have vacuum 
shafts, an atmospheric shaft has been chosen for this facility 
in view of the exceptional depth of the shaft. The rocket-shaped 
capsule (1.8 m in diameter, 8 m in length, 5.7 tons in maximum 
weight) falls through the drop shaft and produces microgravity 
of approximately 1 x 10[.sup]-5[/] G for 10 seconds. A double 
capsule arrangement has been adopted. Microgravity condition is 
produced by floating the inner capsule in which the experimental 
devices are loaded, in the vacuum space of the outer capsule 
while falling. Two vertical steel rails are installed opposite 
each other in the drop shaft, and the outer capsule falls 
between the rails controlled by magnetic guidance system. The 
atmospheric drag exerted on the outer capsule is counteracted by 
a compressed air jet thruster. The motion of the inner capsule 
(except that in the direction of gravitation) is controlled by 
electromagnetic bearings just after being released. In this 
paper, we present an outline of this system. 
<H5>  2. Basic Specifications and System Concept </H5>
  On development, basic specifications were settled as 
follows: 
  1. Microgravity time: over 10 seconds 
  2. Microgravity level: less than 1.0 x 10[.sup]-4[/] G 
  3. Deceleration at braking: less than 10 G 
  4. Maximum payload weight: approximately 1,000 kg 
  5. Real-time data transmission device between falling 
capsule 
and control room including color image. 
  The adopted system concepts to realize these required 
specifications are as follows: 
  (1) Unlike similar facilities in the U.S. and Europe, which 
have vacuum shafts, an atmospheric shaft has been adopted, in 
view of the exceptional depth of the shaft, and in due 
consideration of the simplicity of braking, recovering, and 
maintaining the capsule. 
  (2) Atmospheric drag while falling is compensated for by a 
compressed air jet thruster. 
  (3) A double capsule arrangement is adopted. The inner 
capsule in which the experimental devices are loaded, floats in 
the vacuum space of the outer capsule while falling and produces 
microgravity condition. 
  (4) Two vertical steel rails are installed opposite each 
other in the drop shaft and the outer capsule falls between 
rails controlled by magnetic guidance system. 
  (5) The free fall of 490 m results in Corioli's force 
displacing the inner capsule horizontally by 175mm relative to 
the outer capsule, which falls vertically guided by the rails. 
Then the inner capsule is released from the offset position by 
90mm westward and lands at a position offset by 85mm eastward, 
relative to the center axis of the outer capsule. 
  (6) After a free fall of 10 seconds, the capsule plunges 
into 
the closed tube and is gently decelerated by compressing air 
inside the tube. 
  (7) Recovery of the capsule is done by operating the 
capsule-recovering equipment from the control room. 
  (8) An optical communication system between the falling 
capsule and the bottom of the shaft is installed. 
  A schematic cross-section of this facility is shown in 
Figure 
2. 
<H5>  3. Structural Design of the Capsule </H5>
  Figure 1 shows the outside view of the capsule. 

<FIG ID=JPRS-JST-012L-37A>      Figure 1. General View of Capsule </FIG>



<FIG ID=JPRS-JST-012L-38A>      Figure 2. System Concept </FIG>


  The capsule is composed of three modules as illustrated in 
Figure 3. The total length is 8,375mm, the diameter is 1,800mm, 
and the maximum weight is 5.7 tons including the experimental 
devices. 

<FIG ID=JPRS-JST-012L-38B>      Figure 3. Structure of Capsule Module </FIG>


  The capsule is a welded aluminum alloy structure. The main 
structural part of each module is a stiffened shell 7mm in 
thickness. As the capsule plunges into the braking zone, it is 
exposed to an aerodynamical force that is too large to be 
controlled completely by magnetic guidance system. Touchdown 
bearings (called skids) are provided at the joint part of the 
modules to prevent the guide magnets from touching the rails. 
  Experiments to determine the shape of the capsule were 
carried out using a wind tunnel. Tens of models of different 
shapes were tested. The models were 1/10 scale of the real 
capsule. Aerodynamic forces acting on the models were measured. 
The influence of the shape of added parts, such as guide magnet, 
on air resistance force was examined. The influence of 
structures installed in the drop shaft on air drag was also 
studied. The shape of the outer capsule and the capacity of the 
compressed air jet thruster to counteract air drag while falling 
were determined from these experimental data. 
  The space between the inner and outer capsules is evacuated 
to prevent acoustic vibration being transmitted to the inner 
capsule. The inner and outer capsules are connected by fine 
optical cables to transmit the signal while falling. 
<H5>  4. Release of Inner and Outer Capsule and Microgravity </H5>
Performance 
  Figure 4 shows the capsule in the condition ready for 
release, but still suspended at the top of the shaft. The outer 
capsule is locked to the shaft top by a hydraulic clamp, with 
the inner capsule suspended by an electromagnetic clamp to the 
top of the evacuated interior payload module. Releasing of the 
inner and outer capsules follows the time sequence indicated in 
Figure 5. By decreasing the coil current of the electromagnet 
suspending the inner capsule, the inner capsule begins to fall. 
When the force retained by magnetic clamp lowers to 85 percent 
of the inner capsule weight, an answer signal indicating ``inner 
capsule released'' is transmitted. Some 35 msec later, the outer 
capsule release command is generated, and the outer capsule is 
actually released about 20 msec later. 

<FIG ID=JPRS-JST-012L-39A>      Figure 4. Schematic Diagram of Capsule </FIG>



<FIG ID=JPRS-JST-012L-39B>      Figure 5. Time Sequence of Inner and Outer Capsule </FIG>


   Upon release, the outer capsule is magnetically guided in 
its 
fall between a pair of steel rails laid along the drop shaft. 
The inner capsule must fall freely in the vacuum space 
surrounding it without coming into mechanical contact with the 
outer capsule structure. For this purpose, its movement is 
restricted by magnetic bearings to five degrees of freedom 
except downward translation, for 0.4 second just after release. 
As the inner capsule is released about 55 msec before the outer 
capsule is released, the inner capsule displaces downward to 
dislodge itself from the narrow gap between the magnetic 
bearings about one second after release. The vertical distance 
between the two capsules is detected by an optical sensor 
mounted on the outer capsule. The thruster jets are then 
controlled by a feedback loop using the signal from the sensor, 
to maintain the inner capsule within the prescribed range of 
distance: between the lower edge of the magnetic bearings and 
the bottom of the shock absorber. 
  After a free fall of 10 seconds, the capsule plunges into 
the 
deceleration zone. At this time, the inner capsule is still 
floating. To minimize the impact of landing on the bottom shock 
absorber, the distance between the inner and outer capsules is 
controlled so that when entering the braking zone, the inner 
capsule is as close as possible to the bottom shock absorber. 
<H5>  5. Magnetic Guidance System of Outer Capsule </H5>
  A pair of vertical steel rails (144mm x 160mm in cross 
section) is installed diametrically opposing each other in the 
drop shaft. The attraction-type electromagnetic levitation 
method was chosen. Six pairs of electromagnets are provided on 
the outer capsule, each pair saddling a guide rail as shown in 
Figure 6. Their attractive forces are individually controlled 
for stiffness and damping by controllers mounted on the capsule. 
Other components provided near each magnet are an eddy current 
displacement meter to detect the gap between the magnet and 
rail, and an accelerometer to measure the absolute acceleration 
in the horizontal direction. The magnetic force of each magnet 
is 3,000 N max. in Y-direction and 1,500 N max. in Z-direction. 
The rail-to-magnet gap is 8mm, and the rail-to-skid gap is set 
to 2.5 to 3mm for each side. 

<FIG ID=JPRS-JST-012L-39C>      Figure 6. Layout of Guide Magnet </FIG>


  The motion of the capsule is controlled in five axes (i.e., 
except that in the direction of gravity pull) by six pairs of 
electromagnets. Because two pairs are in the Y-direction and 
four are in the Z-direction, control of the Z-axis can become 
excessive. For this reason, we have adopted the co-operative 
control method for the Z-axis: only three motions, translation, 
inclination, and rotation about the Z-axis, are picked up in 
input signals, and are subjected to positive control. 
  The input signals for control are the gap between the magnet 
and the rail, and absolute acceleration in horizontal direction, 
from which absolute velocity, relative velocity, and relative 
displacement (relative to the rail) are fed back for control. 
Optimization of each control gain was done by trial and error in 
more than 10 drop tests. The block diagram of the magnetic 
guidance system is illustrated in Figure 7. 

<FIG ID=JPRS-JST-012L-40A>      Figure 7. Block Diagram of Magnetic Guidance System </FIG>


  The outer capsule falling data in Y-direction as seen at the 
guide magnet are presented in Figure 8. It shows that in the 
free fall zone, the outer capsule is satisfactorily guided by 
the magnetic guidance system and falls without touching the 
rails. But as the capsule plunges into the braking zone, it is 
exposed to large aerodynamic forces and the skids of the capsule 
touch the rails many times while falling. 

<FIG ID=JPRS-JST-012L-40B>      Figure 8. Outer Capsule Falling Data </FIG>


<H5>  6. Motion Control of the Inner Capsule Just After Released </H5>
  To maintain the microgravity environment created in the 
inner 
capsule on its free fall, it is necessary that the inner capsule 
does not touch the outer capsule. The gap between the two 
capsules is 75mm on each side, and as such contact can occur 
when the inner capsule is released with a certain initial 
velocity, the initial velocity in the horizontal direction must 
be reduced to less than 7.5mm/s. 
  To reduce this initial velocity, the motion of the inner 
capsule (except that in the direction of gravitation) is 
controlled for 0.4 second just after release. To perform this 
control, five sets of magnetic bearings are mounted on the outer 
capsule; two sets against the top portion of the inner capsule 
and three sets against its bottom portion. 
  The activation sequence of the magnetic bearings is as 
follows: First, the inner capsule is held by the inner capsule 
holding clamp (top magnet), which in turn is supported with a 
rod by the outer capsule. Then the lower three pairs of magnets 
are turned on to bring the capsule into an equilibrium position 
determined by the tension of the top magnet's support rod and 
the combined control force of the three sets of magnets. Because 
activation of the upper two pairs of magnets at this moment will 
bring about an excess degree of freedom of two for the force 
acting on the capsule, the control point may not be stabilized 
properly. To forestall this problem, the target control point 
(i.e., the zero-in point) that was originally set for the upper 
bearings is cancelled first, and is reset to the status quo 
position. As a consequence, when the upper pairs are activated, 
the inner capsule does not move from this target position. Then, 
highly stable control of the five sets of magnetic bearings 
becomes possible after the inner capsule is released from the 
top magnet. We call this process the auto presetting. 
  Since the time expended in motion control is that much time 
lost for the microgravity experimentation, the control time must 
be as short as possible. Although this time can be reduced, 
theoretically at least, by raising the control gain, but in 
reality the gain cannot be raised indefinitely, because all the 
control is done from the outer capsule, such an act will 
inevitably couple the motion of the inner capsule to that of the 
outer capsule. The control gain and the control duration time 
are optimized by conducting simulation analysis for the motion 
of both capsules, and are duly improved conducting drop tests. 
<H5>  7. Compressed Air Jet Thruster System </H5>
  The thruster device is mounted on the thruster module as 
shown in Figure 3. Three compressed air reservoirs of 20 MPa are 
installed. There are three compressed air lines, in each line, 
air is led through a pressure control valve that ensures the 
prescribed service pressure, and then branches into three 
thruster valves, each feeding a pair of nozzles, each pair being 
mounted diametrically across the outer capsule axis and 
numbering 18 in all. The nine thruster valves control the jets 
issuing from the relevant nozzles in the ON/OFF mode: the 
combination of valves 0 to 9 ensures control in nine steps of 
aggregate thrust force. For these valves, a compact lightweight 
type was selected after thorough testing to ascertain its 
capability to control a large flow of compressed air with a 
sufficiently rapid response. The service pressure is 4.7 MPa and 
the maximum available thrust force is 7.15 KN. 
  The thruster control system flow is illustrated in Figure 9. 
The vertical distance between the inner and outer capsule is 
detected by infrared sensor. The transmitted signal is converted 
from analog to digital form after passing a low-pass filter, 
then processed in the PID algorithm to derive the thruster valve 
manipulating variable. The output from controller is converted 
into driving signals for the nine thruster valves, to regulate 
these valves in ON/OFF mode through valve drivers. To eliminate 
accidental actuation by noise as well as hunting repetition, the 
controller software is provided with a hysteresis lag of 0.06 V 
between OFF and ON signals. 

<FIG ID=JPRS-JST-012L-41A>      Figure 9. Block Diagram of Gas Jet Thruster System </FIG>


  Thruster system operating data are presented in Figure 10. 
The inner capsule, having been released about 55 msec earlier 
than the outer capsule, is dislodged from the narrow gap between 
the magnetic bearings in about 1 second; when it reaches the 
prescribed control position, the thruster valves are actuated to 
accelerate the outer capsule. In this case, seven thruster 
valves are actuated. Then, the thrusters are shut down once, and 
as the capsule continues to fall, the increasing atmospheric 
drag exerted by the accelerating downward capsule velocity is 
counteracted by successive re-actuation of the thruster valve. 
The foregoing progress of the vertical distance between the 
inner and the outer capsule is timed so that, when the inner 
capsule attains a position 20-60mm above the shock absorber, the 
capsule enters the braking zone. 

<FIG ID=JPRS-JST-012L-42A>      Figure 10. Thruster System Operating Data </FIG>


<H5>  8. Braking and Recovery of the Capsule </H5>
  The capsule 1.8 m in diameter falls through the free fall 
zone 4.8 m in diameter for 10 seconds. Then the capsule plunges 
into the braking tube 1.9 m in diameter and 200 m in length with 
a velocity of 98 m/sec. Because the bottom of the braking tube 
is closed, and the gap between the capsule and braking tube is 
very narrow, air inside the braking tube is compressed and 
decelerates the capsule. Fourteen sets of mechanical braking 
shoes are installed at the bottom of the braking tube. Once the 
capsule comes to this section, braking shoes catch the capsule 
mechanically and the capsule is stopped. 
  Confirming that the capsule is held by the mechanical brake, 
the capsule recovering equipment is sent down from the top of 
the shaft on a wire rope and the capsule is recovered on the 
ground some tens of minutes after being released. 
  If, by any chance, the mechanical brake should malfunction, 
the capsule plunges into the emergency stopping zone filled with 
a cushioning material and is stopped without serious damage. 
  This braking system was developed by Mitsui Engineering and 
Shipbuilding Co., Ltd. 
<H5>  9. Laser Communication </H5>
  An optical communication system is installed. In this 
system, 
laser light is transmitted through the air between the capsule 
and the bottom of the shaft. The results of experiments in the 
falling capsule are observed in real-time by this optical 
transmitter. The command data can be also transmitted in 
real-time from the control room to the capsule by this system. 
This communication system was developed by Toshiba Corporation. 
<H5>  10. Performance </H5>
  The falling tests at the site prove that the required 
specifications are fully met as follows: 
  Microgravity time: 10.0-10.2 sec. 
  Microgravity level: approximately 10[.sup]-5[/] G 
  Deceleration at braking: about 8.3 G 
  Figures 11 and 12 show the acceleration of the inner capsule 
measured during falling test.

<FIG ID=JPRS-JST-012L-42C>      Figure 12. Deceleration Data Obtained in Free Fall Experiment </FIG>


<H5>  11. Concluding Remarks </H5>

Center (JAMIC) and more than 500 times of microgravity 
experiments had been successfully performed by the end of April 
1993. 
  Development of this facility was carried out under a 
contract 
research program on the orders of the New Energy and Industrial 
Technology Development Organization (NEDO).

Department, National Aerospace Laboratory] 
  [Text] As part of joint academic-private sector element 
research on a turbo propulsion system for the space plane and 
supersonic/ultra-supersonic plane, research is being conducted 
at the National Aerospace Laboratory on supersonic intake in 
two-dimensional mixed compression form. The goal of this 
research is two-dimensional variable form intake up to mach 5 
(focusing mainly on mach 3). Up to now, overall tests have been 
conducted, such as supersonic wind tunnel tests, partial element 
model tests, basic aerodynamic tests and CFD. In this article we 
will introduce the results of tests concerning improvements to 
the subsonic diffuser aimed at improving the intake's pressure 
recovery performance. 
  The following are some of the reasons for the loss that 
arises between the subsonic diffuser and the area near the 
throat where vertical shock waves occur: 
  (1) Interference between vertical shock waves and wall 
surface boundary layer; 
  (2) flow separation inside the subsonic diffuser; 
  (3) growth of corner eddies inside the subsonic diffuser. 
  This loss accounts for a relatively large part of intake 
losses, and it became clear that the subsonic diffuser flow 
path, including the air bleed in the throat section, had to be 
improved. Thus model tests using a small-scale continuous type 
mach 2 supersonic wind tunnel (supersonic heat transfer wind 
tunnel) were carried out to improve subsonic diffusers with 
vertical shock waves. 
  Tests were conducted on five models to clarify the effect of 
entry mach differences (M[.sub]1[/]=1.9, 1.35) and pressure 
gradient. Figure 1 shows a representative part of test sections 
and models and Photo 1 is an external view of an entry mach 1.35 
wind tunnel test section. 

<FIG ID=JPRS-JST-012L-43A>      Figure 1:  Subsonic Diffuser Models </FIG>



<FIG ID=JPRS-JST-012L-44A>      Photo 1: External View of Diffuser Model (Low Mach Model) Connected to Small-Scale Supersonic Wind Tunnel </FIG>


  In the model there are boundary layer air bleed holes in the 
vertical shock wave upper flow, and in the low mach test 
section, slits were made in the throat section to simulate 
actual intake. 
  Here, we will discuss three models: SB-11 (dA/dx=c), with 
uniform sectional area change and straight wall composition; and 
SB-12 and SB-21, in which mach gradient is set with flow 
direction (dM/dx= -0.0018 and -0.0031, respectively). Figure 2 
shows experimental results in terms of flow direction pressure 
distribution. With model SB-21, which has a low entry mach, 
overall pressure recovery is high because vertical shock wave 
loss is small, and it was found that a lower loss than the 
straight wall model could be achieved by setting the mach 
gradient. It is thought that the main factors are: (1) High 
pressure gradient near the vertical shock waves encourages 
separation; and (2) boundary layer behavior greatly depends on 
pressure gradient. 

<FIG ID=JPRS-JST-012L-44B>      Figure 2: Static Pressure Recovery of Each Subsonic Diffuser Model </FIG>


  Figure 3 shows the outcome of applying the above results to 
the mach 3 intake model. Performance was improved about 
12% by 
changing pressure gradient (shown graphically in Figure 3 by 
squares to triangles), and a target pressure recovery rate of 
0.81 (circles in Figure 3) was achieved by eliminating corner 
eddies. 

<FIG ID=JPRS-JST-012L-44C>      Figure 3:  Mach 3 Intake Model Pressure Recovery </FIG>


  Model testing also is underway on the effect of mach 
gradient, shortened diffuser length and three-dimensionality.

<F P=106> [Article by Koichiro Tani, Ramjet Propulsion Research </F>
Department, National Aerospace Laboratory] 
  [Text] One technology that is essential for the development 
of the space plane is the scramjet engine, which achieves thrust 
by supersonic combustion--spraying hydrogen fuel into a 
high-mach air flow. At the National Aerospace Laboratory, 
various types of scramjet tests have been conducted for 5 years. 
Of these, the tests involving air intake and compression have 
been focused on aerodynamic characteristics research. This 
research was a study of scramjet startup characteristics at 
minimum operation. Figure 1 shows the shape of the air intake 
model. Shape parameters that determine the aerodynamic 
characteristics are represented by side wall leading edge 
inclination (_a_) and contraction ratio (CR). These two 
parameters were incrementally changed to seek startup 
boundaries, and along with this, aerodynamic characteristics in 
the startup/non-startup transition zone were investigated. 

<FIG ID=JPRS-JST-012L-45A>      Figure 1:  Air Intake Model </FIG>


  The experiments were conducted in a mach 4 blow-down tunnel 
at the Kakuda laboratory. For the experiments, 30 models with 
different shapes were prepared and inflow boundary layer 
thickness was varied by attaching them either to a flat plate in 
the wind tunnel (Case A) or directly to the wind tunnel wall 
(Case B). Boundary layer thickness was about 1/8 of model height 
in Case A, and about 1/2 of model height in Case B. Wall 
pressure and pitot pressure measurements were taken to reveal 
aerodynamic characteristics. Also, to make flow composition 
visible, schlieren observation was used for inside the air 
intake and oil flow was used for the surface flow. 
  Figure 2 is a schlieren photograph of the flow at the time 
of 
startup/non-startup. Oblique shock waves which can be clearly 
confirmed at startup time become blurred at non-startup time as 
they face the lower flow. This is because the separation shock 
waves that are generated on the ceiling wall at non-startup time 
substantially change the internal part of the flow. Figure 3 
shows how this looks when observed by the oil flow method. In 
this figure, Line A corresponds to where the oblique shock waves 
created by the sidewall are reflected and Line B corresponds to 
a new separation line which the separation shock waves create on 
the side wall surface. As the CR increases, Line B gradually 
moves from the inner part of the air intake to the upper flow, 
and finally moves in front of the air intake. 

<FIG ID=JPRS-JST-012L-46A>      Figure 2:  Model Internal Schlieren Photograph </FIG>



<FIG ID=JPRS-JST-012L-46B>      Figure 3: Oil Flow Photographs of Side Wall </FIG>


  In this manner, changes in the shape of the air intake side 
wall change the separative state of the ceiling boundary layer, 
and when this happens, the separation shock waves change the 
flow in the internal part of the air intake. The transition of 
this flow follows changes in the location of separation shock 
waves and, in the case of the axisymmetric air intake, it is 
impossible to fully observe the startup state with just the flow 
speed in the throat section, the narrowest part of the flow 
path. Therefore, the startup characteristic of each air intake 
was evaluated by using two criteria for grouping, as shown in 
Figure 4. One is grouping by location of separation shock waves. 
At startup time, the separation shock waves are near the throat 
(circles in the figure). They moves to the forward edge of the 
air intake (triangles in the figure), and finally jump out in 
front of the intake (squares in the figure). Aerodynamic 
performance (total pressure recovery rate, captured flow volume 
rate, etc.) gets worse as the separation shock waves move, but 
throat flow speed does not necessarily become subsonic. The 
other grouping is simply when the average flow speed in the 
throat is above (unfilled shapes in the figure) and below 
(filled shapes) the speed of sound. In terms of the role of 
transmitting the supersonic flow to the combustor, the states 
represented by solid triangles and squares in the figure can be 
said to be fully non-startup. 

<FIG ID=JPRS-JST-012L-47A>      Figure 4:  Startup State Groupings </FIG>


  As seen in Figure 4, startup generally is difficult toward 
the advance angle, which tells us that startup is difficult when 
CR is high. The model with leading edge angle of almost 0ë 
and high CR in particular can be easily shifted to a completely 
non-startup state. Moreover, when compared to Case B, which has 
a thick boundary layer, Case A has a broad full startup zone, 
but it has a narrow transition zone, and changes in shape cause 
rapid change in state. Incidentally, total pressure recovery 
rate (ratio of total pressure in main flow and average pressure 
in throat) at startup is 40 - 70% for Case A, but it is 
20 - 
45% for Case B because of strong influence of the boundary 
layer, which has low total pressure. In the future, studies will 
be done on air intake shapes that will, in accordance with the 
needs of the combustor, achieve prescribed pressure increases at 
the throat surface while suppressing ceiling wall separation. 
  These tests were conducted as part of joint research with 
Mitsubishi Heavy Industries.

Aerospace Laboratory] 
  [Text] To confirm the practicality of a multi-truncated 
pyramid base pitot tube that was being developed through 
co-research with the Tokyo Aircraft Instruments Company, the 
pitot tube was attached to the tip of the nose boom of the Queen 
Air B-65, an aircraft used to conduct experiments, for a flight 
test. The pitot tube is to be mounted on the space plane (HOPE) 
and the HOPE small-scale experimental landing aircraft. As of 9 
September, there have been three modification inspection flights 
and five data collection flights, and good data was collected 
without any special breakdowns. Through the use of heads up 
display, flight tests were carried out with precision and 
efficiency and equipment for the STOL (short takeoff and 
landing) experimental aircraft was used for on-board and ground 
data collection. 
  The multi-truncated pyramid base pitot tube can measure air 
speed amount and direction simultaneously while fixed to the 
aircraft. Moreover, it is a type of 5-hole tube that was 
developed as an air current sensor that does not have the 
problems of movable sections or complex correction procedures, 
and based on the 5 pressures, it can find angle of incidence, 
angle of side-slip speed, altitude, etc. 
  With flight tests, it is difficult to test precision, but 
data concerning the precision of the pitot tube already had been 
collected in wind tunnel tests. In these tests, therefore, 
emphasis was placed on functions, dynamic characteristics, the 
effects of vibration, temperature and air pressure changes, 
practicality and reliability. 
  Pressure signals from the multi-truncated pyramid base pitot 
tube are converted by the speed vector processing unit attached 
to the instrument rack in the aircraft cabin into angle of 
incidence, angle of side-slip, speed, altitude, etc., and is 
output at the rate of 16 times per second by the ARINC429 bus. 
This output is displayed and recorded by an on-board PC monitor 
and also is combined with other measurement signals by the 
ARINC-PCM multiplexer. Data was collected on speed and altitude 
for the purpose of data comparison by diverging the pressure 
from a conventional pitot tube for cockpit instrument use and 
from the static pressure hole and using a speed and altitude 
transducer. A vane was attached to the boom tip on the right 
wing end, and angle of incidence and angle of side-slip were 
used as reference data. Aircraft attitude angle, acceleration, 
path angle, etc., were measured with inertial navigation 
equipment (IRU). Data recorders were not mounted on the aircraft 
because all data was transmitted to the ground by telemetry. 
  The following were the results of the flight tests: 
  (1) While on the ground, equipment ceased to function due to 
momentary power loss on the aircraft, but there was no abnormal 
shutdown of equipment during flight. 
  (2) During horizontal, regular flight, speed and altitude 
data from conventional instruments and from the multi-truncated 
pyramid base pitot tube were compared, and it was confirmed that 
the output was adequate. Figure 1 is a sample from an altitude 
of about 2,400 meters (8,000 feet). The error slope for speed is 
the effect of position error. 

<FIG ID=JPRS-JST-012L-48A>      Figure 1:  Altitude, Speed Signal Comparison </FIG>


  (3) Data on angle of incidence and angle of side-slip 
collected during horizontal regular flight by three methods -- 
vane, IRU and multi-truncated pyramid base pitot tube system -- 
were compared. Absolute values differed because the wing tip 
section and nose section were under separate local flow 
conditions, but they all displayed essentially the same 
behavior. Figure 2 is a sample from an altitude of about 3,000 m 
(10,000 ft). 

<FIG ID=JPRS-JST-012L-49A>      Figure 2:  Angle of Incidence Signal Comparison </FIG>


  (4) There was no difference between cases when a pitot 
heater 
was used and when it was not. 
  (5) Angle of incidence and angle of side-slip response 
characteristics resulting from vertical short-term movement 
caused by sudden elevator manipulation and from Dutch roll 
resulting from sudden rudder manipulation were studied. Figure 3 
shows response time samples at about 2,400 m (8,00 ft) altitude 
and about 50 m/s (100 kt) speed. 

<FIG ID=JPRS-JST-012L-50A>      Figure 3: Angle of Incidence Response Times </FIG>


  (6) Angle of incidence sweep tests were conducted and angle 
of incidence data was collected from 0ë to 21ë. 
  (7) Angle of side-slip sweep tests were conducted and angle 
of side-slip data was collected from -13ë to +14ë. 
  (8) Visual inspection after landing did not turn up any 
clogging of holes due to insects, dust, etc. 
  These flight tests confirmed that this pitot tube can stand 
up to use as air flow sensors for use in flight tests, but since 
some software problems were revealed, modifications are 
scheduled to be made before the next experiment. Additionally, 
since the minimum external air temperature was 8ëC at 3,000 
m (10,000 ft) altitude, there was no problem with moisture 
adhesion, but that effect is scheduled to be investigated 
through experiments during the winter.

  [Text] Commercial nickel-hydrogen batteries which are 
replaceable with nickel-cadmium (Ni-Cd) batteries have been put 
to wide use for personal computers, cordless telephones, etc. 
The batteries have an electrode containing hydrogen occulsion 
alloy instead of the cadmium electrode of Ni-Cd batteries and 
are called Ni-MH (Metal Hydride) batteries. Their internal 
reaction is similar to that of the Ni-Cd batteries developed for 
space use with one difference. Hydrogen generated when they 
charge and discharge is stored as high-pressure gas in Ni-Cd 
batteries, but in Ni-MH batteries, the hydrogen is absorbed in 
the hydrogen occulsion alloy. 
  Hydrogen occulsion alloy can absorb a volume of hydrogen 
1,000 times its own volume and produce metal hydride. This new 
material can release absorbed hydrogen and was developed 20 
years ago. Its applications include hydrogen storage and heat 
pumps which utilize heat generation and release associated with 
hydrogen absorption and release, but its widest application has 
been in batteries. 
  Ni-MH batteries are similar to Ni-Cd batteries and 
Ni-H[.sub]2[/] batteries which were previously developed for 
space use. Their applicability began being evaluated two years 
ago using small commercial batteries. The evaluation results 
were very satisfactory, and batteries with characteristics 
superior to those of Ni-Cd batteries can be expected. 
  Full-scale research was started in FY 1992 based on the 
above 
evaluation results, and 35 AH batteries were trial-produced 
utilizing space-use Ni-Cd battery technology. The energy density 
of the trial-produced cells was 20 percent better in both weight 
and volume than that of Ni-Cd battery cells to be used 
Engineering Test Satellite-VI (ETS-VI) and the Advanced Earth 
Observing Satellite (ADEOS). Additional scale and weight 
reduction can be expected. 

<FIG ID=JPRS-JST-012L-51A>      Trial-Produced Cell </FIG>


  It should be possible to produce excellent space-use Ni-MH 
batteries by evaluating their characteristics on a long-term 
basis and reflecting the results in advanced improvements of 
characteristics such as service life extension. Japan is leading 
the world in Ni-MH battery technology and will promote advanced 
research and development in this area will be promoted by 
accumulating experience with these batteries on board small 
satellites.

Center, NASDA] 
  [Text] Fundamental research on thermally driven gas flow; 
on liquid separation technology utilizing surface tension, 
evaporation and condensation technology; and on liquid transport 
technology utilizing vapor pressure change in the space 
environment will be conducted. Experiments to verify the 
principles of these technologies are conducted in the Spacelab. 
  Since electric power used for spacecraft operation is 
eventually converted to unnecessary heat, it is necessary to 
remove the heat from the spacecraft to space through radiators. 
The size and electric power consumption of future spacecraft are 
expected to enlarge significantly. The distance between the heat 
source and the radiators will then lengthen, and unnecessary 
heat to be radiated will also increase. 
  Accordingly, fluid loops (called two-phase fluid loops) 
utilizing latent heat of vaporization of liquid (heat absorbed 
from the surroundings when a matter changes its phase from 
liquid to vapor; the heat is ejected when the phase changes from 
vapor to liquid) have been proposed for the temperature control 
inside spacecraft and heat transport from the heat sources 
inside spacecraft to radiators. Japan, Europe, and the U.S. 
started to conduct fluid loop research since 1980's. A two-phase 
fluid loop is outlined in Figure 1. The two-phase fluid loop 
consists of the following components: 
  (1) Cold Plate (CP) for absorbing heat and vaporizing the 
fluid; 
  (2) Pump to send the liquid to Radiator CP in order to emit 
the heat to space and condense the vapor; 
  (3) Accumulator to control the inner pressure of the 
two-phase fluid loop; 
  (4) Liquid and vapor paths connecting the above; 
  (5) Control system. 

<FIG ID=JPRS-JST-012L-58A>      Figure 1. Flow Pattern in Residual Gravity </FIG>


  The CP receives heat from the equipment installed on it from 
a pump and uses the heat to vaporize the liquid sent to it. The 
vapor absorbs unnecessary heat as latent heat of vaporization, 
is transported to the radiator, and condensed by radiating heat 
to space. The vapor then returns to the liquid phase. The CP 
temperature approaches the liquid vaporization temperature which 
in turn depends on the inner pressure of the two-phase fluid 
loop. Accordingly, the CP temperature can be managed by 
controlling the inner pressure of the loop with the accumulator. 
The accumulator controls the inner pressure of the two-phase 
fluid loop by transferring the liquid to or from the two-phase 
fluid loop. 
  A thermally driven accumulator will be used in the two-phase 
fluid loop undergoing research by the National Space Development 
Agency of Japan (NASDA). The liquid inlet and outlet section 
have a capillary structure and are designed to collect only 
liquid there. Fine grooves are engraved on the accumulator's 
inner wall to help form a thin liquid film. Vaporization of the 
liquid film or condensation of the vapor on the grooved section 
can be accomplished by heating or cooling the accumulator. This 
controls the inner pressure of the accumulator, and the liquid 
in the accumulator is driven. The experiment in IML-2 is to 
verify the principle of thermal drive using the principle model 
of the accumulator called the Thermally Driven Flow Unit (TDFU). 
  The principle of the TDFU is shown in Figure 2. The TDFU 
consists of two steel vessels with an observation window, two 
thermoelectric elements (elements for converting electric energy 
to thermal energy and vice versa; they are heated or cooled 
depending on the direction of electric current) for heating and 
cooling the vessels, and a heat sink which smooths heat input to 
and output from the thermoelectric elements. The inner wall of 
each vessel is grooved, and the two vessels are connected with a 
tube to facilitate liquid movement. The inner part of the vessel 
consists of two sections. One section is the capillary structure 
on the connecting tube side of the vessel; the other is the 
hollow section on the opposite side. Distilled water is used as 
the working fluid. The gas and liquid in the vessel are 
separated due to the higher affinity of the vessel inner surface 
for gas than for liquid (difference of wettability) and tendency 
of liquid of larger surface tension to collect in the capillary 
structure section. In microgravity, wettability and capillary 
force play important roles in controlling liquids in gas-liquid 
separation. 

<FIG ID=JPRS-JST-012L-59A>      Figure 2. Experiment Vessel of CDU </FIG>


  When an electric current is applied to the thermoelectric 
elements, one vessel is heated while the other is cooled. The 
inner pressure of the vessel heated increases due to the 
vaporization of liquid, and the inner pressure of the vessel 
cooled decreases due to the condensation of the vapor. The 
liquid moves from the heated side to the cooled side due to the 
pressure difference thus produced. 
  The experiment is conducted with the VIBES's vibration 
isolation mechanism on and off. The gas and liquid conditions in 
the vessels are observed and recorded to understand and confirm 
the principle of thermally driven flow. 
  The results obtained from this experiment will not only be 
reflected in the design of two-phase fluid loop accumulators but 
is also expected to be applicable to fundamental technology for 
space development, such as energy technology, thermal control 
technology, environmental control technology, and liquid 
transport.

  [Text] Perfect zero gravity conditions do not exist in the 
Space Shuttle or Space Station. Some steady-state gravity 
(residual gravity) caused by air resistance and shifting from 
the gravitational center remains. There is also some vibration 
(g-jitter) caused by human activities and the operation of 
various machines. The residual microgravity is deemed to 
generate new flow or influence flow however minute it might be. 
To learn these effects, therefore, is very important in the 
field of fluid handling and material processing. 
  The residual gravity is estimated to be 10-5 to 10-6 g and 
causes a slight flow in one direction. G-jitter is a vibration 
with various frequencies at levels of 10-3 to 10-4 g. Lower 
frequencies are expected to influence flow, and higher 
frequencies, to exert a strong influence on the dispersion. 
Computer-simulated flow in residual gravity and g-jitter is 
shown in Figure 1. In this case, the flow is disturbed by low 
frequency. 

<FIG ID=JPRS-JST-012L-59B>      Figure 3. Ground Simulation Test of Electrolytic Color </FIG>


  In the experiment, an experiment vessel as shown in Figure 2 
is used for actually observing and quantitatively measuring such 
phenomena. The rectangular solid vessel (7 by 8 by 2 
centimeters) is filled with water, salt, and pigment 
(phenolphthalein). A temperature gradient is then induced in the 
liquid by heating (70ëC) the upper surface of the vessel. 
The temperature gradient causes a flow when gravitational 
acceleration exists. The flow is observed by the electrolytic 
color development method. The solution of salt is electrolyzed 
by installing the anode (silver plate) and the cathode 
(palladium wire) in the vessel and turning on electricity. The 
pigment is discolored by the hydrogen ion concentration (pH) 
change near the cathode. The flow can be detected by the moving 
pattern of the discolored portion. Actual discoloration on the 
ground is shown in Figure 3. The transparent liquid becomes 
reddish purple. In electrolyzing the solution of salt, chlorine 
gas is generated at the anode and hydrogen gas at the cathode. 
In this experiment, those gases are absorbed by the silver and 
the palladium respectively and the generation of bubbles which 
hinder the experiment is prevented. 

<FIG ID=JPRS-JST-012L-59C>      Figure 1. Light Response of Goldfish </FIG>

A heater is embedded in the upper surface of the vessel 
and thermocouples for temperature measurement on the left and 
right faces. A bellows is attached on the left face of the 
vessel to allow sample solution expansion due to heating. As too 
much discoloration of the pigment hinders flow pattern 
observation, the cathode (palladium wire) is painted red in 
places to prevent discoloration of the pigment at these 
places. 


<FIG ID=JPRS-JST-012L-60A>      Figure 2. Change of Light Response of Goldfish </FIG>


  In space, the Convection Diffusion Unit (CDU) with the above 
vessel installed will be housed in VIBES, and experiments will 
be conducted with isolation on and off to determine whether the 
Shuttle vibration is mitigated or not. The effects of the 
g-jitter will be better understood by comparing the results of 
the two cases.

Mechanism   of Vestibular Adaptation of Fish Under Microgravity

University] 
  [Text] Animals on Earth always controlled their attitude 
and movement with reference to gravity. They adjust their 
attitude by integrating the sense of sight and soimatosthesia 
with the function of the vestibular otolith organ. They will 
adapt to the change of vestibular sense as time elapses when 
they are put in an utterly new environment such as microgravity. 
Man sometimes exhibits symptoms of space motion sickness during 
the adaptation process. In ``Fuwatto '92,'' the role of the 
otolith organ in attitude control in microgravity was examined 
using two carps. Goldfishes are used in IML-2 to investigate the 
temporal change of the attitude control mechanism using their 
attitude and behavior as indices (i.e., to clarify the 
adaptation process in microgravity and the process to re-adapt 
to ordinary gravity on Earth). 
  Though goldfishes exhibit various attitudes and behavior, 
their innate reaction to turn their back to the light source is 
useful for observing the interaction between the sense of sight 
and gravitational sense. Figure 1 shows the reaction. In the 
natural environment on Earth, gravity works toward the bottom 
and light comes from the top. In such an environment, the 
goldfish takes an attitude with its belly down and its back up. 
When the light is applied from the side, it tries to turn its 
back toward the light but is not completely successful due to 
the downward gravitational sense. The most important organs for 
sensing gravity are the left and right vestibular organs. If 
both of them are removed, the goldfish turns its back to the 
light source independent of the direction from which the light 
comes (see Figure 2). However, the inclination decreases as time 
elapses and becomes constant in 6 months. In contrast, the 
goldfish which has undergone surgery to remove only the left or 
light vestibular organ inclines significantly to the operated 
side and the inclination toward the intact side increases a 
little (Figure 3). The inclination toward the operated side 
decreases with time, but the inclination toward the intact side 
rarely changes. The goldfish eventually adapts a balanced 
position between both sides. During short (20 second) exposures 
to microgravity obtained during parabolic flight of an airplane, 
the inclination angles of these goldfishes approach 90 degrees, 
and the attitude seemed to be controlled by the sense of sight. 

<FIG ID=JPRS-JST-012L-60B>      Figure 3. Change of Light Response of Goldfish </FIG>




  In the space experiment, a total of six goldfishes, 
including 
two which had had the vestibular organ on one side removed 2 
weeks earlier, one with both organs intact were flown in space. 
Changes in the reaction to the light source during and after the 
flight were photographed with a video recorder to analyze 
adaptation to the gravitational environment change. Clarifying 
the adaptation mechanism of the sensing system, with emphasis on 
the vestibular system, should provide useful information to 
clarify and provide countermeasures against space motion 
sickness, an important problem in space medicine. The experiment 
is expected to reveal the interaction between vestibular organs 
on both sides and with other senses.

  [Text] NEC has developed a new type of laser element whose 
current required for laser oscillation is the smallest in the 
world. Pulsed radiation at room temperature with a current 
[threshold] value of 190 microamperes was achieved and this 
broke the previous world record. By way of comparison, this is 
less than one-tenth of the current used by conventional elements 
and it means a large reduction in electrical power for 
semiconductor lasers. The new element is also structured to 
accommodate high density integration and it can be useful for 
the realization of such things as super high speed optical 
computers, which use optical signals to process information, and 
optical circuitry devices. 
  The developed element is a type of surface-emission laser 
which emits radiation in a direction perpendicular to the 
substrate of the semiconductor. It emits infrared laser 
radiation at a wavelength of about 1 micron. The structure is 
unique in that the active radiation layer is sandwiched on both 
sides by multilayered semiconductor films. One side of the 
multilayered film is finely cut into a cylindrical shape. The 
diameter of the cylindrical part is 5 microns and the height is 
4 microns. 
  The multilayered film plays the role of a reflecting mirror 
for laser oscillation and by designing the thickness of one 
layer so that it is equal to the size of the wavelength, 
radiation loss is considerably limited. The conventional film 
layer has a margin of error of around 1 percent but NEC, by 
successfully establishing conditions for molecular beam crystal 
growth technology [molecular beam epitaxy], held it down to less 
than 0.3 percent. Moreover, by using a cylindrical structure, 
the radiation is efficiently confined inside it, and a reduction 
of the current value necessary for laser oscillation was 
achieved. 
  It was experimentally confirmed that the new element began 
oscillation at 190 microamperes and, at 2 milliamperes, there 
was an optical output of 50 microwatts. The world's smallest 
previous semiconductor oscillation current value was 250 
microamperes. However, the element holding the world record was 
a conventional type that oscillates in a direction horizontal to 
the substrate and integration was difficult. Basically, since 
the newly developed element is a surface emission-type, it can 
be integrated and manufactured just like an ordinary transistor. 
  Currently, the resistance of the element is large and the 
efficiency is low, making continuous oscillation impossible. The 
next step will be to make progress toward continuous oscillation 
and improvement in the efficiency. 
  The semiconductor laser element is mostly used by itself as 
an optical source for compact disks and optical communications. 
However, if multiple integration can be accomplished, its uses 
will be expanded. For example, there is a possibility for using 
it for such things as optical computers, which process imagery 
data without conversion into electrical signals, or as an 
optical source for high-speed optical circuitry which switches 
multiple signals. 
  When the operating current per semiconductor laser is high, 
large electric power is necessary and integration is difficult. 
In order to make integration practical, the problem has been 
that of how to reduce the value of the oscillation current.

<H5>  Improving Nuclear Safety -- Future Directions </H5>
  [Morris Rosen, Assistant Director General for Nuclear 
Safety, 
International Atomic Energy Agency] 
  There are three themes which can provide some overview of 
the 
future worldwide directions in nuclear safety. The first deals 
with the many safety improvements already proposed for the next 
generation of reactors. In all leading nuclear power countries, 
evolutionary plants are being developed for large scale 
implementation around the turn of the century. They contain 
numerous safety improvements based on the vast accumulated 
operational experience and include new design features as well 
as design simplifications. Already high safety levels continue 
to increase. The increase in safety by any measure is 
impressive. Estimates of severe core damage likelihood for the 
evolutionary designs are below 1 in 10,000 per reactor per year 
and are now comparable to natural disaster frequencies. The 
future will call for a continued process of evolutionary safety 
development along with designs with greater inherent safety and 
more passive systems requiring less mechanical and human actions. 
  The many improvements already made are closely involved with 
human performance. While operational incidents are often due to 
design errors and mechanical failures, the real root causes can 
lie in organizational and individual deficiencies due to 
failings in what is termed Safety Culture. Safety 
culture is a new concept which has only evolved over the past 
several years. It is the aggregate qualities, both in 
organizations and in individuals, which make safety an 
overriding priority. It has two major components. One is 
concerned with the individuals' attitudes and responses, and the 
other is the organizational framework in which they work. 
Attitudes can be influenced by education and training and 
perhaps more so by psychological and environmental factors. 
Organizational styles can also be influenced so as to promote 
policies which encourage attitudes favorable to safety. Safety 
culture is necessary not only at the operational level, that is 
at the utility and the plant, but also at the governmental 
level, in the regulatory body and as well in design, 
construction and research organizations. An introduction to this 
important subject, is the second theme of this talk. 
  The global nature of nuclear safety leads to the concluding 
theme. This is a discussion of the preparatory efforts underway 
for an International Nuclear Safety Convention, an agreement 
which could be the cornerstone of improving nuclear safety 
worldwide. Although contentious points remain, the preparatory 
work has advanced to the point where an agreed text should soon 
be ready with adoption by a Diplomatic Conference likely next 
year. In general the difficulty in formulating an agreed text 
has arisen from the difference in approach between those 
countries desiring a very detailed and strict convention and 
those wishing a less demanding one. The former wishes to see 
binding internationally agreed upon safety codes, mandatory 
safety reviews, detailed reporting, and emergency plans 
involving neighboring countries. The latter desires a convention 
based on more general safety fundamentals and on safety culture 
principles. It has been agreed that the convention will be 
limited to civil nuclear power plants, but there will likely be 
a commitment to begin negotiations on an international 
instrument on the safety of waste management. 
<H5>  Safety Issues in Russia's Nuclear Power </H5>
  [A. Abagyan, Director General, VNIIAES, Russian Federation] 
  The safety of Russia's operating NPPs is on the one hand 
determined by today's status of its nuclear power industry and 
on the other hand -- by the modern international safety 
requirements. 
  The nuclear power is characterized by the existence of 
different types of nuclear units (mainly VVER and RBMK type) of 
different generations. Presently nine NPPs are in operation in 
Russia which incorporate 29 units with the total capacity of 
21,242 MW. 
  The operating units can be conditionally broken down into 
two 
generations: 
  -- First generation units (``older'' units). These were 
designed prior to the development and enforcement of the basic 
Safety Codes and Guides in the former USSR. 
  -- Second generation units. These were developed in 
accordance with the Safety Codes developed with account for 
operational experience with the units of the first generation. 
  In total there are 13 units of the first generation. These 
include four VVER-440/230 units and four RBMK-1000 units 
constructed before 1978. These ``older'' units from the 
viewpoint of modern international safety requirements are the 
most seriously criticized ones. The paper addresses the safety 
issues of these units and conditions of their operation up to 
expiration of the design lifetime -- up to 2000-2005. 
  Improvement of the safety level of the units of second 
generation is to a great extent associated with improvement of 
their instrumentation of diagnostic and information system. 
  Further expansion of nuclear program in Russia is related 
with the use of VVER-1000 reactors of the third generation and 
also of the new generation of light water reactors based on the 
modern international criteria of inherent fault immunity and use 
of passive safety systems. 
<H5>  IAEA's Nuclear Power Plant Safety Programs in Eastern Europe </H5>
and Countries of the Former Soviet Union 
  [L. Lederman, IAEA, Division of Nuclear Safety] 
  The safety on nuclear power plants in operation in Eastern 
Europe and in countries of the former Soviet Union is a matter 
of great international concern. However, the current energy 
supply and demand in these countries allows little scope for 
immediately closing down less safe plants. A realistic approach 
must deal with urgent short term improvements to reduce safety 
risks pending a feasible long term solution. This long term 
solution could combine alternative energy supply, improvements 
towards a more efficient use of energy and safety upgradings and 
reconstruction of the nuclear power plants. 
  There are currently 57 NPP of the WWER and RBMK types in 
operation and 16 under construction in these countries. 
  Efforts have been underway to deal with the problem. The 
IAEA 
has initiated in 1990 new and major activities to supplement its 
ongoing safety services. Significant bilateral and multilateral 
assistance activities have been initiated by the USA, Japan and 
other OECD countries. There are projects funded by the 
Commission of the European Communities. The European Bank for 
Reconstruction and Development in London, the European 
Investment Bank in Luxembourg, and the World Bank are also 
considering financing safety improvements. 
  Implementing a mechanism for effective co-ordination of 
current international efforts has not been an easy task. One 
should however recognize that the difficulties encountered so 
far in producing effective co-ordination are not very different 
from those associated with past assistance efforts of such 
magnitude and complexity. Since the beginning of 1992 a 
mechanism for co-ordination, established through a G-24 Working 
Group which meets in Brussels, has been in place. It has been 
chaired by the CEC with IAEA participation in a technical 
advisory capacity. 
  In December 1991 the Agency completed the first phase of the 
extrabudgetary programme on the safety of WWER-440/230 plants 
and issued a technical document (IAEA-TECDOC-640) containing -- 
inter alia -- the results of safety review missions to all 
WWER-440/230 plants. The document evaluates the significance of 
the identified safety issues and provides a basis for the short 
and long-term activities required in order to improve plant 
safety. Early in 1992 the IAEA published ``An overview and major 
findings of the extrabudgetary programme on the safety of 
WWER-440 model 230 nuclear power plants'' (STI/PUB/912). 
  The second phase of the programme, currently in progress, 
focuses on assisting Member States to plan and evaluate 
modifications (as regards both hardware and the conduct of 
operations) and to verify that proposed modifications respond to 
concerns identified during the programme's first phase. 
  There is an international consensus that, together with 
WWER-440/230 plants, RBMK plants are the ones requiring most 
urgent attention and safety improvements. 
  The Agency has started in 1992 an ``International Programme 
on Safety Assessment of RBMK Reactors.'' 
  The objective of the programme is to review the scope and 
results of safety evaluations performed, the technical basis for 
the safety improvements implemented or planned and to establish 
international consensus on priority actions. The results of this 
programme will contribute to establishing a basis for decisions 
on technical and financial support for implementation of 
measures to improve safety. 
  In December 1992, an Advisory Group with participants from 
21 
countries and five international organizations reviewed the 
progress of the Agency's nuclear safety programmes for Eastern 
Europe and countries of the former Soviet Union and advised on 
future activities and necessary co-ordination. 
  In general it was agreed that the Agency's programmes had 
been very useful and that the planned future activities 
responded to the needs of countries constructing and/or 
operating WWER and RBMK plants. The IAEA programme was then 
extended to include other types of WWERs namely 440 model 213 
and 1000 NPPs.

<H5>  Issues Related to the Safety of Nuclear Power Reactors in </H5>
the Former Eastern-Bloc Countries -- A Western Viewpoint 
  [S. Chakraborty, Swiss Federal Nuclear Safety Inspectorate, 
CH-5232 Villigen-HSK, Switzerland] 
  Abstract 
  Reviews performed by several international organizations, 
including those of the International Atomic Energy Agency 
(IAEA), the Organization for Economic Cooperation and 
Development (OECD) countries, and several other countries have 
identified many concerns related to design, siting (i.e., plant 
sites near major tectonic faults), operation, maintenance, 
management, safety culture, and regulatory mechanisms in the 
nuclear power industries of the former Eastern bloc countries. 
This situation is now compounded with the economic and political 
problems that have ensued since the break-up of the former 
Eastern bloc. 
  The objective of this paper is to discuss the safety 
concerns 
with the Eastern nuclear power plants and ways to address the 
current debacle, based on the experience with the Western 
nuclear power development programs and current safety and 
regulatory standards and practices. Finally, the approach to 
improving the safety of nuclear power reactors in the former 
Eastern-bloc countries is proposed based on the lessons learned 
from the Western nuclear power development, construction and 
operation over the past 40 years. 
  A multi-pronged safety resolution approach consisting of the 
following is needed: 
  1. A rehabilitation of safety culture within the Eastern 
nuclear operations and regulatory process; 
  2. Development of a comprehensive nuclear regulatory process 
and safety acceptability criteria; 
  3. Assessment of plant vulnerabilities and most 
cost-effective ways of plant modifications; 
  4. Development of programs for operational training, testing 
procedures, and maintenance; and 
  5. Development of revised design standards and licensing 
procedures for modernization of the Eastern nuclear power 
industries. 
  The safety improvements that are a prerequisite for the 
faith 
in nuclear power encompass not only reduction of risk from 
severe accidents but also reduction of economic risk (which 
could threaten the national economy of less developed countries) 
and improvements in operational reliability. 
<H5>  Japanese Assistance and Cooperation to the Former Soviet </H5>
Union and Central and East European Countries To Improve Nuclear 
Safety 
  [Toshio Okazaki, Deputy Director General, Atomic Energy 
Bureau, Science and Technology Agency] 
  Background 
  At the July, 1992, summit meeting in Munich, nuclear safety 
in the former Soviet Union and other Central and East European 
countries was recognized to give cause for great concern 
requiring urgent solutions, and the summit participants agreed 
on a set of multilateral assistance measures, which were 
included in the summit's economic declaration. 
  Accordingly, the Japanese government had already been 
implementing bilateral assistance (coordinated with that of the 
Western nations) and it now also takes part in multilateral 
efforts, for example, through contributions to the Nuclear 
Safety Account, which was established to supplement bilateral 
measures by bilateral programs. 
  At the Tokyo Summit in July of this year, the same issue was 
addressed again, and the importance of immediate action to 
ensure safety was reiterated. 
  Nature of Japanese Assistance 
  Starting with measures requiring immediate implementation, 
efforts to improve the safety of Soviet-designed NPP's are 
focused on operational safety improvements, near-term technical 
improvements to plants based on safety assessments, and 
enhancing regulatory regimes. The following types of assistance 
are being rendered: 
  (1) Multilateral Programs 
  The IAEA dispatches experts and conducts study meetings to 
assess the safety of Soviet-designed nuclear NPP's. The Japanese 
government participates in those safety-assessment meetings, and 
cooperates with the IAEA, including with extra-budgetary 
contributions to the program. 
  For near-term improvements in the technical aspects of 
nuclear safety, the government makes financial contributions to 
the Nuclear Safety Account. Contributions will also be made to 
the OECD-NEA, specifically for their efforts to increase safety 
from a long-term point of view. 
  (2) Bilateral Programs 
  The Japanese government conducts safety-related 
international 
training programs for experts including nuclear safety 
regulators, operators and engineers of the nuclear power plants 
in the former Soviet Union and Central and East European States. 
In addition to this, the government has launched other 
cooperative efforts, including installation of Leak Detection 
System with High Temperature Resistant Microphones in Nuclear 
Power Plant to detect leakage from the reactor pipelines; 
training for those responsible for operational management, using 
simulators installed at the Nuclear Power Plant Safety Operation 
Training Center in Russia; and others. 
  Japan is also planning to send specialists to exchange 
information on nuclear power safety with their counterparts in 
the various countries.

  [Text] The Kansai Electric Power Company and Sumitomo 
Electric Industries, Ltd., have succeeded in co-developing a 
bismuth-based superconducting current lead wire. It has current 
capacity of 2,500 amperes, the highest for an oxide 
superconductor, and the amount of heat penetration into helium 
is .412 watts per kiloampere. It can be used as current lead 
wires for superconductive magnetic energy storage (SMES) devices 
and other equipment that apply superconductivity, and its 
performance does not degrade in magnetic fields. 
  Two types of lead wire were developed; one has 500 ampere 
capacity and the other 2,500 amperes. In the 500 ampere lead 
wire, a silver-clad, bismuth-based oxide semiconducting wire 3.5 
millimeters (mm) wide and 0.15mm thick has been laminated. As 
for the 2,500 ampere lead, a modified version of the 500 ampere 
wire is the standard unit, and 4 of them are set side by side. 
Total length of the wire is 560mm, and it is fixed in an epoxy 
resin support material to increase mechanical strength. 
  Generally, copper has been used for current lead wire for 
superconductive equipment, but the wire has to be thicker for 
stronger current and the generation of joule heat caused by the 
resistance of the material itself also is a problem. That is why 
hopes have been pinned on oxide superconductors, which have 
superior heat penetration. Until now, however, maximum capacity 
achieved with a yttrium-base wire was 1,800 amperes.

  [Text] From April 1994, the Superconducting Sensor Research 
Institute (in Inzai-machi, Inba-gun, Chiba Prefecture; Tsuneo 
Nakahara, Chairman) will begin experimental measurement of very 
weak magnetic fields in the brain, using a direct-current 
superconducting quantum interference device (DC-SQUID) in the 
world's most advanced super high performance magnetic shield 
room. Initially, magnetic fields in the brain and heart will be 
measured with a system that has 64 channels using SQUID and 16 
channels using high-temperature superconduction; the 
interrelationship of this with data from imaging diagnostic and 
other equipment will be studied; and the goal will be to 
complete a 200-channel biological magnetic field measurement 
imaging system. 
  The Superconducting Sensor Research Institute will begin 
experimental measurement of magnetic fields in the brain and 
heart from FY94. With the goal of completing a SQUID clinical 
testing system by the end of March 1994, a metal-base SQUID and 
high-temperature superconducting SQUID system will be introduced 
and a maximum of 20 types of permanent magnet MRIs (magnetic 
resonance imaging diagnostic equipment) will be set up in a 
magnetic shield room that was recently installed in a Tokyo 
Denki University laboratory in Inba-gun, Chiba Prefecture. 
  The external form of the magnetic shield room is a 6-meter 
pseudo-sphere with 32 sides that is made up of a 20-sided 
hexagonal form exactly like a soccer ball and a 12-sided 
pentagonal form. It is made of a total of five layers (four 
permalloy magnetic shield plates developed by NKK Corporation 
and one aluminum shield plate). It is the first in the world to 
succeed in weakening magnetic fields in the external environment 
to less than one-fifteenth. It was decided to go a step further 
to clinical data measurement experiments with the SQUID system. 
  Biodata already is demonstrating a major effect on 
diagnostics now that techniques such as x-ray CT and MRI have 
been put to practical use. The biological magnetic field 
measurement imaging system, by measuring the magnetic fields as 
they exist in the body, will further aid in the estimation of 
the state of activity of nerves and muscles that generate the 
magnetic fields and the diagnoses of minute functional 
abnormalities of the brain or heart. However, magnetic fields 
generated by the body are extremely faint, from .01 to .00000001 
of geomagnetism, so development of a SQUID flux meter for 
measurement as well as environmental adjustment to shut out 
environmental magnetism were essential. 
  Hereafter, the Superconducting Sensor Research Institute 
plans to use the already developed 64-channel metal-based SQUID, 
which operates at the temperature of liquid helium, the 
16-channel high-temperature superconducting SQUID, which works 
at the temperature of liquid nitrogen, and the magnetic shield 
room to discover the interrelationship with clinical data. It 
also plans to work on software development. 
  The Superconducting Sensor Research Institute is an R&amp;D 
company that was formed in March 1990 through investments by the 
Basic Technological Research Promotion Center and 10 private 
firms -- Hitachi, Sumitomo Electric Industries, Yokogawa 
Electric, Shimadzu Corporation, Daikin Industries, Seiko 
Electronics Industries, Takenaka Komuten, Ulvac Corporation, 
Toshiba Corporation, and Shimizu Corporation.

  [Text] The likelihood is increasing that superconducting 
cables will be used for power transmission around the beginning 
of the 21st Century. This is because it has become impossible to 
avoid the establishment of nuclear power plants in more distant 
locations and this has substantially increased transmission 
power loss. The Society of Non-Traditional Technology predicts 
that it will be possible to to build superconducting 
transmission cables in a loop around a city for the cost of 
building one nuclear power plant. Development of superconducting 
power transmission is proceeding apace, and the application of 
superconductivity to power transmission is of as much interest 
as superconductive power generation and power storage. 
  Superconductivity technology has advanced from just direct 
current to alternating current as well; with wire materials such 
as niobium-titanium and niobium-tin(III), technological 
development for passage of high density current has been 
realized; and rapid progress is being made on the development of 
peripheral equipment as well. 
  As for power transmission technology, however, although 
practical application of the very high pressure of 1 million 
volts has been realized with existing technology, nuclear power 
plants, the main source of electric power, are gradually being 
located farther from points of consumption, and transmission 
loss is expected to become a serious problem from the viewpoint 
of energy conservation. 
  Thus the interest in using superconductivity in transmission 
lines. The Society of Non-Traditional Technology and others have 
estimated that superconducting transmission line loops around 
Tokyo, Osaka and Nagoya can be built at the same cost as one 
nuclear power plant. There is no loss whatsoever when 
superconductivity is used in power transmission, unlike 
conventional power transmission, and it is hoped that this will 
be realized along with the use of superconductivity in power 
generation and storage. 
  With regard to long-term energy outlook, there is the view 
that around the year 2000, when delays in construction of 
nuclear power plants will grow conspicuous, we will be forced to 
increase our dependence on oil, coal and liquefied natural gas 
(LNG). Thus superconductive power transmission, in combination 
with the extension of technological development, is starting to 
look more practical.

  [Text] As part of development of a linear motor train for 
use on water and land that has been advanced mainly by Kyushu 
University, the ``Marine Express (ME) Concept Research 
Committee'' (Kyushu University Engineering Department Professor 
Toshiaki Ota, representative) has succeeded in an experiment 
with levitating and running a model car (ME03) that has been 
equipped with permanent magnets. It is said that the premise of 
this experiment was land travel and, unlike the linear motor car 
that is being tested at the Japan Railways (JR) Research 
Institute in Miyagi Prefecture, which levitates only at high 
speeds, the ME03 can float even at standstill and is well-suited 
for city transport. The ME03 was unveiled to companies and 
relevant government agencies at a recently held meeting to 
report the results of the research. 
  The ME concept is a program for using magnetic force to 
levitate and run a train above rails laid on land and in the 
ocean. In June 1990, the model car ME01 was successfully tested 
for running under water, and the experiment with running the 
ME03 on land concludes the first stage of the experiments. 
Hereafter, plans for the second stage of experiments call for 
running a model of actual size. This stage is expected to last 3 
- 4 years, and the committee plans to request research funding 
from the national government. 
  The ME03 is composed of 3 cars. Total length is about 220 
centimeters (cm), width is 50 cm and height is 20 cm. Total 
weight of the cars is about 150 kilograms. In the experiment, 
the amount of current through a 10-meter coil on a rail was 
modulated and the cars were levitated and run by the resulting 
force of magnetic repulsion between the coil and the permanent 
magnets on the cars.

  [Text] A research group led by Professor Toyonobu Yoshida 
of Tokyo University's Engineering Department recently succeeded 
in fabricating a yttrium-base superconducting thin film on a 
strontium-titanium-oxygen (STO) substrate, using a heat 
plasma/flash vaporization technique. When this method is used, 
subsequent processing usually is not required to manifest 
superconductivity and a yttrium-base superconducting thin film 
of large area can be produced in an extremely short time, so it 
has great industrial merit as well. Research already has started 
on specific applications, and this research group plans to do 
applied research aimed at finding other uses. 
  Professor Yoshida, et al., have succeeded in synthesizing a 
YBaCuO (yttrium-barium-copper-oxygen) high-temperature 
superconducting thin film with a plasma process known as heat 
plasma/flash vaporization. With this method, 10[.sup]18[/] 
oxygen atoms, which have higher reactivity than ECR plasma, are 
flashed at the rate of 1 square centimeter (cm) per second and 
metal film formation is carried out in a gaseous state. The 
research group mixed particles of an alloy of vanadium-silicon 
and niobium-silicon, applied 40 kilowatt heat plasma/flash 
vaporization, and in 15 minutes formed a superconducting thin 
film 1 to 2 microns thick in the shape of a cylinder 14 cm in 
diameter on the STO substrate. 
  Study of the thin film confirmed that it was 
YBa[.sub]2[/]Cu[.sub]3[/]O[.sub]x[/], 123 [composition 
ratio], and in superconductive phase. 10[.sup]6[/] A 
(angstroms) per square cm superconductivity was confirmed. It is 
said that for the substrate, magnesium oxide or zirconia also 
are possible instead of STO. 
  Additionally, with this method, the after-processing that is 
usually essential for high-temperature superconductors is not 
necessary. It is thought that what demonstrates 
superconductivity is slow cooling in the oxygen and that the 
reason a large thin film can be formed in such a short time 
probably is that accumulation speed is faster because in 
radicals, cluster-like coating occurs. 
  Some of Professor Yoshida's group has begun joint research 
with companies on specific uses, and it is said that prospects 
for development have been confirmed. High-temperature 
superconductivity research samples certainly do not require 
after-processing and this leads to cost reduction. This 
advantage in processing has raised expectations for expanding 
the uses of this superconducting thin film.

  [Text] The Electrotechnical Lab (ETL) of the Agency of 
Industrial Science and Technology has succeeded in synthesizing 
a new type of high-temperature superconducting material that 
contains silver, and has confirmed that it becomes 
superconductive (electrical resistance is zero) at absolute 
temperature 117ë (-156ëC). This is the highest critical 
temperature (temperature at which superconductive state is 
shown) achieved for a substance that does not use elements with 
high toxicity such as mercury or thallium. 
  The synthesized substance is composed of silver, barium, 
calcium, copper and oxygen in the ratio of 1:2:3:4:10. 
Superconducting state was confirmed by full diamagnetism and 
full conductivity. In addition to high critical temperature, 
preliminary test results indicate that critical current density, 
which shows size of current flow, will be high, 1 million 
amperes per square centimeter. 
  Director Hideo Ihara of the superconductive materials 
laboratory packed a gold capsule with silver and other materials 
and synthesized a 4 millimeter square mass at high pressure 
(50,000 atmospheres) and high temperature (1,100ëC). The 
most popular method of fabricating superconducting material is 
to deposit molecular layers one by one, but weaknesses of this 
method include the fact that metal decomposes easily and the 
fact that oxygen tends to escape from the crystal structure. 
  Hereafter, study to reveal crystal structure with great 
precision will be advanced. Also, since the space between layers 
of copper oxide, which demonstrate superconductivity, can be 
reduced if silver is used, it is possible that material with 
even better performance can be developed. 
  Until now, the best critical temperature recorded for 
low-toxicity superconducting substances was absolute temperature 
110ë (-163ëC) for a substance using bismuth.

O[.sub]8+ø[/] single crystals in air by the travelling 
solvent floating zone method and measured the structural and 
electromagnetic properties of the sintered feed, first-scanned

Bi[.sub]2[/]Sr[.sub]2[/]Ca[.sub]1[/]Cu[.sub]2[/] 
O[.sub]8+ø[/] phase, but the first-scanned feed includes

and Bi[.sub]2[/]Sr[.sub]3-x[/] 
Ca[.sub]x[/]O[.sub]y[/] (x-1) phases as minor phases. The 
grown single crystal samples exhibit higher superconducting 
transition temperature and the narrower transition width 
compared with the sintered and first-scanned feed samples. The 
high resolution electron microscope images and electron 
diffraction patterns indicate that the single crystal samples 
have an incommensurate superstructure along the b-axis with a 
period of about 5a. The superconducting transition temperatures 
(zero resistivity values) along the a-, b- and c-axis for the 
single crystal samples have nearly the same value of 83 K. 
_r_[.sub]b[/]/_r_[.sub]a[/] and 
_r_[.sub]c[/]/_r_[.sub]a[/] at room temperature are 1.67 
and 250 respectively. 
<H5>  1. Introduction </H5>
  Materials[.sup]1[/] are divided into congruently and 
incongruently melting categories according to their melting 
behavior. Congruently melting material, corresponds to A or C 
phase in Figure 1, can coexist in equilibrium with the liquid 
phase of the same composition above melting point. While 
incongruently melting material, corresponding to B phase in 
Figure 1, decomposes into the solid and liquid phase of 
different compositions upon heating. 

<FIG ID=JPRS-JST-012L-68A>      Figure 1. Congruently and incongruently melting compound. </FIG>


  Compound B starts to decompose into the solid and liquid 
phase upon heating at temperature T[.sub]o[/] through 
peritectic reaction, then the solid and liquid phase have 
compositions A and X[.sub]1[/] respectively at temperature 
T[.sub]1[/]. If compound B is slowly cooled from high 
temperature, solid phase of A starts to precipitate at 
T[.sub]E[/] and the composition of liquid changes from E to F 
with decreasing temperature. If temperature is further decreased 
below T[.sub]o[/], solid phase of B precipitates while the 
composition of liquid phase changes from F to G. Therefore, 
composition A precipitates from the liquid phase between D and 
F, but composition B precipitates between F and G. Namely, 
congruently melting material can be grown from the liquid phase 
of same composition, but incongruently melting material should 
be grown from the liquid phase of different composition. In the 
case of incongruently melting material, an undesirable solid 
phase may be precipitated later because the composition of 
liquid phase changes continuously with precipitating solid 
phase. Therefore, we keep the composition of liquid phase 
unchanged by supplying additional B compound as much as 
precipitated, when we grow single crystal of composition B from 
the liquid phase between F and G. 
  Most of the high-temperature oxide superconductors are known 
to be incongruently melting materials. High-temperature 
superconductors have been grown by various methods such as slow 
cooling,[.sup]2[/] directional solidification,[.sup]3[/] 
top seeded solution growth (TSSG)[.sup]4[/] and travelling 
solvent floating zone (TSFZ) method.[.sup]5-7[/] High quality 
single crystals have been obtained by the TSFZ method because 
this method has the merit of no contamination from the crucible 
compared with the other methods. Takegawa et al.[.sup]5[/] 
first succeeded in growing 
Bi[.sub]2.2[/]Sr[.sub]1.8[/]Ca[.sub]1[/]Cu[.sub]2[/] 
O[.sub]8+ø[/] single crystal from the liquid phase of 
Bi[.sub]2.4[/]Sr[.sub]1.5[/]Ca[.sub]1[/]Cu[.sub]1.8[/] 
O[.sub]8+ø[/] by the TSFZ method. They reported that the 
single crystal grew along the a-axis and had the same 
composition as the feed prepared through the solid-state 
reaction within experimental error. 
  In this work we have grown the 
Bi[.sub]2[/]Sr[.sub]2[/]Ca[.sub]1[/]Cu[.sub]2[/] 
O[.sub]8+ø[/] (hereafter, Bi(2212)) single crystal by the 
TSFZ method and investigated the structural and electromagnetic 
properties of the sintered feed, first-scanned feed and the 
grown single crystal. 
<H5>  2. Crystal Growth </H5>
  The feed and the solvent (act as a liquid phase from which 
the single crystal grows) were prepared through the solid-state 
reaction using powders of Bi[.sub]2[/]O[.sub]3[/], 
CaCO[.sub]3[/] and CuO as starting materials. The starting 
materials were mixed in the nominal compositions of 
Bi[.sub]2.2[/]Sr[.sub]1.8[/]Ca[.sub]1[/]Cu[.sub]2[/] 
O[.sub]8+ø[/] for feed and 
Bi[.sub]2.4[/]Sr[.sub]1.5[/]Ca[.sub]1[/]Cu[.sub]1.8[/] 
O[.sub]8+ø[/] for solvent, and calcined in air at 810ëC 
for 12 h. The calcined materials were pulverized and pressed 
into rods of 8mm diameter and 100mm length under a pressure of 
20 kg/cm[.sup]2[/]. Then the feed rods were sintered in air 
at 850ëC for 62 h with intermediate grinding, and the 
solvent rods were sintered under the same conditions for 12 h. 
  The feed, solvent and seed were arranged in an infrared 
radiation furnace with double halogen lamps and ellipsoidal 
mirrors (NEC, SC-35HD) as shown in Figure 2. The infrared 
radiation from halogen lamps is focused by ellipsoidal mirrors 
and melts the solvent located at the focal point of the mirrors. 
The feed, solvent and seed are shifted synchronously downward 
slowly during the crystal growth. Then, the feed composition is 
precipitated at position I[.sub]2[/] as much as dissolved at 
I[.sub]1[/] while keeping the liquid composition unchanged. 
The details of the crystal growth can be found 
elsewhere.[.sup]5,8[/] 

<FIG ID=JPRS-JST-012L-69A>      Figure 2. Schematic representation of the configuration of seed, solvent and feed in an infrared radiation furnace. The </FIG>


  A part of liquid phase may be sucked up into the feed by 
capillary force if a porous feed is used. In such a case the 
feed should be shifted downward additionally in order to supply 
sufficient liquid for the crystal growth. But this induces the 
change of the liquid composition and an undesirable secondary 
phase may be grown as explained in the introduction. So, we 
first prepared a dense feed by performing the first-scan at a 
high rate of 8mm/h as shown in Figure 2(a). The first-scanned 
feed consisted of very small single crystal. The density of the 
sintered and first-scanned feed was about 45% and 
90% of the 
theoretical value of Bi(2212) phase respectively. 
  The first-scanned feed was used as a feed for the 
second-scan 
(single crystal growth). The amount of solvent was 1.5 g and 0.5 
g for the first- and second-scans respectively. The feed and 
seed were rotated in opposite directions at a rate of 13 rpm 
during each scan in order to homogenize the molten zone. The 
crystal growth was carried out for 3-4 days at a rate of 
0.5mm/h, and we obtained crystal boule of _P_ = 6-7mm and l = 
35-40mm as shown in Figure 3(a). However, the crystal boule is 
not a single crystal as a whole, but consisted of many single 
crystals. Figure 3(b) shows the single crystals separated from 
the crystal boule with a wire cutter and a knife. Single 
crystals were easily cleaved along the c-axis due to the weak 
bonding between double BiO[.sub]2[/] layers. The well 
developed surface in Figure 3(b) is c-plane. Moreover, we could 
also easily distinguish between the a- and b-axis because 
Bi(2212) crystal is well known to grow along the a-axis. The 
density of the single crystal was above 95% of the 
theoretical 
value. 

<FIG ID=JPRS-JST-012L-70A>      Figure 3. Photographs of (a) the crystal boule grown by TSFZ method and (b) single crystals separated from the crystal </FIG>


<H5>  3. Structural Properties </H5>
  Powder XRD patterns of the sintered feed, first-scanned feed 
and grown crystals were observed using CuK_a_ line as an 
incident radiation. We have measured the XRD pattern of the 
grown crystal after powdering it in order to compare it with 
those of feeds and to check whether impurity phases are involved 
or not. Figure 4 confirms that most of the sintered feed and the 
grown crystal consisted of Bi(2212) phase, although very tiny 
peaks of Bi[.sub]2[/]Sr[.sub]2[/]Cu[.sub]1[/] 
O[.sub]6+ø[/] (hereafter, Bi(2201)) phase are observed 
around 22ë and 26ë for the crystal samples. However, 
Bi(2201) phase and 
Bi[.sub]2[/]Sr[.sub]3-x[/]Ca[.sub]x[/]O[.sub]y[/] 
(x-1) phase are distinctly observed in the first-scanned feed 
grown at a high rate of 8mm/h. This tendency is consistent with 
the result of Kubo et al.[.sup]8[/] They reported that the 
volume fraction of Bi(2201) phase decreased with decreasing the 
crystal growth rate. 

<FIG ID=JPRS-JST-012L-70B>      Figure 4. Powder X-ray diffraction patterns of the sintered feed, first-scanned feed and grown crystal. </FIG>


  The 
Bi[.sub]2[/]Sr[.sub]3-x[/]Ca[.sub]x[/]O[.sub]y[/] 
(X-1) phase, which was first observed by Ikeda et 
al.,[.sup]9[/] and identified by Sato et al.,[.sup]10[/] 
appears in a sample annealed in nitrogen or below 700ëC in 
air, namely, in an oxygen-deficient condition. Hence, it is 
considered that the oxygen content in the first-scanned feed is 
lower than that in the sintered feed or grown crystal. The peak 
positions of Bi(2212) phase in each specimen are nearly the 
same, suggesting that the compositions of the grown crystal is 
nearly the same as that of the feeds. 
  We have observed the backscattered Laue diffraction pattern 
for the grown single crystal using continuous CuK_a_ line as an 
incident radiation. As shown in Figure 5, the Laue diffraction 
pattern consists of layered spots due to the layered structure 
of the crystal along the c-axis.[.sup]11,12[/] However, we 
could observe no Laue diffraction pattern with the incident 
radiation along the a- or b-axis. 

<FIG ID=JPRS-JST-012L-70C>      Figure 5. Laue X-ray backscattering photograph of the grown single crystal taken with an incident beam parallel to the </FIG>


  Figure 6 shows the high resolution electron microscope image 
of the grown single crystal taken with an incident beam along 
the a-axis. The whitish spots represent the oxygen atoms or the 
vacancy. The large dark spots just upper and below the whitish 
lines along the b-axis correspond to the Bi atoms. Double 
BiO[.sub]2[/] layers repeat along the c-axis with a period of 
about 30 Angstroms. Five less dark dotted lines, corresponding 
to the Sr, Ca and Cu atoms, also can be observed between double 
BiO[.sub]2[/] layers, which confirms that the grown single 
crystal is a Bi(2212) phase. 

<FIG ID=JPRS-JST-012L-71A>      Figure 6. High resolution electron microscope image of the single crystal viewed along the a-axis. </FIG>


  Figure 6 shows that the double BiO[.sub]2[/] layers are 
modulated into the Bi rich and Bi deficient regions. The dark 
region, Bi rich region, and less dark region, Bi deficient 
region, in double BiO[.sub]2[/] layers are repeated along the 
b-axis which induce a superstructure along this direction. The 
superstructure has a period of 10 atomic distance for the 
majority part, but a period of 9 atomic distance for another 
part in Figure 6, this implies that the single crystal has an 
incommensurate superstructure[.sup]13-15[/] along the b-axis 
with a period of about 4.8a. Moreover, the atomic layers of Sr, 
Ca and Cu are also modulated into the honeycomb pattern due to 
the effect of the modulation of double BiO[.sub]2[/] layers. 
  The superstructure along the b-axis can be observed more 
distinctly in the electron diffraction pattern. Figure 7 shows 
the electron diffraction pattern of the single crystal taken 
with an incident beam along the a- and c-axis. The period of the 
principal diffraction spots along the b-axis is nearly the same 
as that along the a-axis suggesting that the averaged atomic 
distances along the a- and b-axis are nearly the same. However, 
there are also minor diffraction spots along the b-axis with a 
period of about 1/5 of the principal period. The period of the 
real lattice is inversely proportional to that of the 
diffraction pattern because the diffraction pattern is 
represented in reciprocal lattice space. Therefore Figure 7(a) 
confirms that Bi(2212) phase has a superstructure along the 
b-axis with a period of about 5a which is consistent with the 
result of high resolution image. The superstructure along the 
b-axis can also be observed in Figure 7(b) taken with an 
incident beam along the a-axis. Figure 7(b) shows that the 
lattice parameter along the c-axis is about 6a. 

<FIG ID=JPRS-JST-012L-71B>      Figure 7. Electron diffraction pattern of the single crystal with an incident beam along (a) the c- and (b) </FIG>


<H5>   4. Electromagnetic Properties </H5>
  The dc magnetization measurements were carried out using a 
Quantum Design SQUID magnetometer. Figure 8 shows the field 
cooled magnetization curves for the samples of sintered feed, 
first-scanned feed and the grown crystal taken at a field of 10 
G. As for the crystal, electromagnetic properties were measured 
after air annealing. The crystal was heat treated at 840ëC 
for 30 min. and cooled to 400ëC at a rate of 12ëC/h, 
then furnace cooled below 200ëC. The magnetic field was 
applied parallel to the c-axis for the crystal. 
T[.sub]c[/](onset)s for the sintered and first-scanned feed 
are nearly the same. However, the transition for the 
first-scanned feed is broader than that for the sintered feed, 
presumably because of the mixed secondary phases, such as, 
Bi(2212) and 
Bi[.sub]2[/]Sr[.sub]3-x[/]Ca[.sub]x[/]O[.sub]y[/] 
(x-1). The single crystal specimen shows not only higher 
T[.sub]c[/](onset) of 84 K but also narrower transitions, 
_D_T[.sub]c[/] (10-90%) of about 4.5 K, as compared to the 
feeds suggesting that the grown crystal is more homogeneous than 
the feeds. 

<FIG ID=JPRS-JST-012L-72A>      Figure 8. Field cooled superconducting transitions of the sintered feed, first-scanned feed and crystal taken using 10 G </FIG>


  Figure 9 shows the temperature dependence of resistivity for 
each specimen. Electrical resistivity was measured using the 
four-probe method with a current of 1-2 mA. Current was along 
the a-axis for the single crystal. Each specimen shows metallic 
resistivity behavior in the normal state. T[.sub]c[/](zero) 
increases with processing, from the sintered feed to the single 
crystal. T[.sub]c[/](zero)s for the sintered feed, 
first-scanned feed and single crystal are about 45 K, 58 K and 
83 K respectively. In case of the magnetization vs. temperature 
relation, the superconducting transition of the first-scanned 
feed is broader as compared to that of the sintered feed as 
shown in Figure 8, although the T[.sub]c[/](onset) for the 
first-scanned feed is nearly the same as that for the sintered 
feed. However, it is considered that the first-scanned feed 
shows not only higher T[.sub]c[/](zero) but also narrower 
_D_T[.sub]c[/] compared to that of the sintered feed in 
resistivity measurements since the density of the first-scanned 
feed is about two times of that of the sintered feed, so that 
the superconducting path is well connected in the first-scanned 
feed. The resistivity of the first-scanned feed is larger than 
that of the sintered feed because of the presence of mixed 
secondary phases of Bi(2201) and 
Bi[.sub]2[/]Sr[.sub]3-x[/]Ca[.sub]x[/]O[.sub]y[/] 
(x-1) phase. 

<FIG ID=JPRS-JST-012L-72B>      Figure 9. Temperature dependence of the resistivity for the sintered feed, first-scanned feed and single crystal. The </FIG>


  The temperature dependence of resistivity along the a-, b- 
and c-axis of the grown single crystal is shown in Figure 10. 
The resistivity curves in CuO[.sub]2[/] plane show metallic 
behavior in the normal state while that along the c-axis makes a 
small peak around T[.sub]c[/]. 

<FIG ID=JPRS-JST-012L-73A>      Figure 10. Temperature dependence of the resistivity along the a-, b- and c-axis of the single crystal. The dimension of </FIG>


  Although _r_[.sub]a[/] and _r_[.sub]b[/] are well known 
to show metallic behavior in the normal state, _r_[.sub]c[/] 
is controversial. Martin et al.[.sup]16[/] reported the 
semiconductor like _r_[.sub]c[/] with 
_r_[.sub]c[/]/_r_[.sub]a[/] - 1.5 x 10[.sup]5[/], but 
Yasuda et al.[.sup]17[/] obtained metal like _r_[.sub]c[/] 
with _r_[.sub]c[/]/_r_[.sub]ab[/] - 500 which is 
consistent with our results. T[.sub]c[/](zero)s along the a-, 
b- and c-axis have nearly the same value of 83 K. Anisotropic 
ratio of _r_[.sub]c[/]/_r_[.sub]ab[/] for Bi(2212) is much 
larger than that for YBCO phase[.sup]18[/] suggesting the 
two-dimensionality is more evident in the Bi(2212) phase. 
_r_[.sub]b[/]/_r_[.sub]a[/] and 
_r_[.sub]c[/]/_r_[.sub]a[/] values are about 1.67 and 250 
in this experiment, but Martin et al. had obtained different 
results with _r_[.sub]b[/]/_r_[.sub]a[/] - 0.5 and 
_r_[.sub]c[/]/_r_[.sub]a[/] - 1.5 x 10[.sup]5[/]. It is 
considered that the difference may come from, (i) although 
Martin et al. had measured the resistivity anisotropy for 
Bi[.sub]2[/]Sr[.sub]2.2[/]Ca[.sub]0.8[/]Cu.O[.sub]8+ø[/] 
single crystal, 
Bi[.sub]2.2[/]Sr[.sub]1.8[/]Ca[.sub]1[/]Cu.O[.sub]8+ø[/] 
single crystal has been used as a specimen in the present 
measurement, and (ii) Martin et al. had measured the resistivity 
by Montgomery method,[.sup]19,20[/] but we have measured by 
conventional four-probe method in our experiment. 
<H5>  5. Summary </H5>
  We have grown 
Bi[.sub]2[/]Sr[.sub]2[/]Ca[.sub]1[/]Cu[.sub]2[/] 
O[.sub]8+ø[/] single crystals in air by the travelling 
solvent floating zone method through twice scanning process. The 
density of the specimen increases with processing from the 
sintered feed to the grown single crystal. Most of the sintered 
feed and the grown crystal consist of 
Bi[.sub]2[/]Sr[.sub]2[/]Ca[.sub]1[/]Cu[.sub]2[/] 
O[.sub]8+ø[/] phase, but the first-scanned feed grown at a 
high rate of 8mm/h involves 
Bi[.sub]2[/]Sr[.sub]2[/]Cu[.sub]1[/]O[.sub]6+ø[/] 
and 
Bi[.sub]2[/]Sr[.sub]3-x[/]Ca[.sub]x[/]O[.sub]y[/] 
(x-1) phases as minor phases. T[.sub]c[/](zero)s of the 
sintered feed, first-scanned feed and grown crystal are about 45 
K, 58 K and 83 K respectively. The susceptibility and 
resistivity measurement show that the single crystal not only 
higher has superconducting transition temperature but also 
narrower transition width suggesting that the grown single 
crystal is more homogeneous as compared with the feeds. [as 
published] The high resolution electron microscope image and 
electron diffraction pattern show the single crystal has an 
incommensurate superstructure along the b-axis with a period of 
about 4.8a. The resistivity anisotropy of 
_r_[.sub]c[/]/_r_[.sub]a[/] is about 250 which is larger 
than that of YBCO phase suggesting that the two dimensionality 
is more evident in Bi(2212) phase.

<H5>  Abstract </H5>
  A 94 GHz-band low noise downconverter has been developed by 
combining an InP-HEMT low noise amplifier, a pseudomorphic HEMT 
mixer and a dielectric resonator oscillator, each fabricated 
using the planar circuit technology. The downconverter shows a 
noise figure of less than 4.9 dB and a conversion gain of 
greater than 11 dB. 
<H5>  I. Introduction </H5>
  Recent progress in the high electron mobility transistor 
(HEMT) technology has stimulated the development of low noise 
amplifiers (LNAs) at 94 GHz-band and above [1-3]. HEMT mixers 
[4] and dielectric resonator oscillators (DROs) [5] have also 
been developed to realize W-band low noise converters (LNCs). An 
LNC incorporating a HEMT LNA and a HEMT mixer has been reported 
[6]. 
  We have recently developed a 94 GHz-band LNC by combining a 
HEMT LNA, a HEMT mixer and a DRO. Though all the three 
downconverter components have planar circuit configurations, 
they are connected together via waveguide interfaces as an 
initial step to check the downconverter performance. The LNC 
showed a noise figure of less than 4.9 dB and a conversion gain 
of greater than 11 dB for 94 GHz-band. In this paper, the HEMT 
LNA, the HEMT mixer and the DRO using a Gunn diode are described 
as well as the overall performance of the LNC. 
<H5>  II. HEMT Devices </H5>
  We have developed both InP-based InAlAs/InGaAs HEMTs 
(InP-HEMTs) and AlGaAs/InGaAs pseudomorphic HEMTs (P-HEMTs) for 
W-band applications. Figure 1 shows the top view of the HEMT 
chip with a T-shaped 0.1 æ m x 50 æ m gate. The chip 
size is 
150 æ m x 170 æ m and the thickness is 70 æ m. The 
bonding 
pads of each electrode are designed as small as possible in 
order to reduce stray capacitances. The chip layout and size are 
the same for both types of HEMTS. 

<FIG ID=JPRS-JST-012L-75A>      Figure 1. Top View of HEMT Chip </FIG>


  The InP-HEMT shows a minimum noise figure of 2.7 dB with an 
associated gain of 5.4 dB at 94 GHz when biased at Vds=1.0V and 
Ids=6 mA. The cutoff frequency ft of this device is as high as 
260 GHz, when biased for a maximum gain. The P-HEMT exhibits a 
minimum noise figure of 3.9 dB with an associated gain of 5.0 dB 
at 94 GHz when biased at Vd=2.0 V and Ids=11 mA. 
<H5>  III. Low Noise Amplifiers (LNA) </H5>
  Both InP-HEMT LNA and P-HEMT LNA have been developed. These 
LNAs are 5-stage single-ended MIC amplifier chains with 
waveguide input and output interfaces. Finline waveguide to 
microstrip transitions fabricated on teflon-glass substrate with 
a relative dielectric constant 

<FIG ID=JPRS-JST-012L-76A>      Figure 2. Inner View of LNA </FIG>

  r = 2.1 and a thickness of 0.13mm are used for the waveguide 
to MIC transitions. The insertion loss of each transition is 
about 1 dB at 94 GHz. 
  The single stage unit amplifier is built on a KOVAR metal 
carrier which measures 5mm long and 10mm wide. The input and 
output matching circuits including the quarter-wavelength 
coupled lines for DC block and quarter-wavelength RF chokes for 
DC bias are formed on ceramic substrates with 


  r = 5 and thickness of 0.1mm. The loss of these circuits is 
estimated to be 0.2 dB. The unit amplifier has been designed and 
fabricated for the minimum noise figure. After embedding the 
unit amplifier in the 5-stage amplifier housing, a small circuit 
trimming has been performed to obtain a minimum overall noise 
figure. 
  Figure 2 shows an inner view of the LNA. Comparison of the 
measured noise figure and gain between the InP-HEMT LNA and 
P-HEMT LNA is given in Figure 3. The InP-HEMT LNA shows a noise 
figure of 4.6 dB and a gain of greater than 20 dB at the center 
frequency f[.sub]0[/], while the P-HEMT LNA shows a noise 
figure of 6.2 dB and a gain of 21.5 dB at the same center 
frequency. The InP-HEMT LNA has proved to be superior to the 
P-HEMT LNA in terms of noise figure.

<H5>  IV. HEMT Mixer </H5>
  Devices for mixers should have a higher breakdown voltage 
than for LNAs, since they are subject to a relatively high power 
LO drive. We have chosen the P-HEMT for the mixer application, 
judging from the fact that its breakdown voltage is much higher 
than that of the InP-HEMT. The mixer developed in this work is a 
drain mixer with LO drive at the drain and RF drive at the gate. 
The IF signal of 3 GHz is obtained from the drain through a 
choke circuit for LO and RF frequencies. The gate and drain 
matching circuits are fabricated on a 0.1mm thick ceramic 
substrate with 


  r = 5. The IF matching circuit including a drain bias choke 
is formed on 0.1mm thick alumina substrates to reduce circuit 
size, since the IF frequency f[.sub]IF[/] is chosen to be 3 
GHz. All the circuits are integrated on a metal carrier as small 
as 5mm x 10mm. 
  Figure 4 shows an inner view of the HEMT mixer with RF and 
LO 
port waveguide-to-microstrip transitions and a coaxial IF output 
connector. Figure 5 demonstrates a measured conversion loss of 
the HEMT mixer at the center frequency f[.sub]0[/] as a 
function of LO power. The LO frequency f[.sub]LO[/] is chosen 
to be f[.sub]0[/]-f[.sub]IF[/]. The conversion loss is 
measured to be 5.1 dB for an LO drive power of 10 dBm, at which 
the IF output power at 1 dB gain compression point is found to 
be -2 dBm. The SSB noise figure of the HEMT mixer is 11.5 dB at 
a 7 dBm LO drive.

<H5>  V. Dielectric Resonator Oscillator (DRO) </H5>
  Figure 6 shows a schematic circuit configuration of the 
frequency-stabilized DRO with a drop-in isolator for better load 
pulling. 

<FIG ID=JPRS-JST-012L-77A>      Figure 6. Schematic Circuit Configuration of DRO </FIG>

  Dielectric resonators operating at a higher order mode may 
be 
preferable for stabilizing a 94 GHz oscillator, considering that 
the higher order mode operation enables us to employ a larger 
size resonator than those of the TE[.sub]01[/]ø dominant 
mode, thereby giving a higher Q-factor and an easier handling. 
The use of whispering gallery mode resonator is an example based 
on this idea [5,7]. Higher order mode resonators are, however, 
very position sensitive with respect to their coupling to the 
circuit. We realized the necessary coupling of higher order mode 
resonator by adjusting the coupling position carefully and 
adding a mechanical tuner. In this way, we could make our DRO 
temperature stable between -5 to 40ëC . The exact mode 
number of the resonator is not determined yet. 
  Figure 7 shows the inner view of the DRO. The Gunn diode 
used 
is an InP Gunn diode (NW-50) manufactured by Acrotec. The diode 
is packaged in a pill which measures 0.8mm in diameter and 0.9mm 
in height. The dielectric resonator is a ceramic disk with 
&lt;graphic&gt; &lt;/graphic&gt; 

  [Text] r = 24.6, a thickness of 0.4mm and a diameter of 
3.2mm. 
The resonator is attached with an adhesive on an MIC substrate 
made of ceramic with 
&lt;graphic&gt; &lt;/graphic&gt; 

  [Text]r = 5 and a thickness of 0.1mm. The adhesive not only 
deteriorates the coupling condition but also affects the 
oscillation frequency. Thus a mechanical tuner is added to the 
DRO housing for fine oscillation frequency adjustment. The 
frequency can be adjusted by plus or minus 10 MHz. 

<FIG ID=JPRS-JST-012L-77B>      Figure 7. Inner View of DRO with Top Cover Removed </FIG>

  [Text] Figure 8 shows the measured oscillation frequency 
and output 
power vs. temperatures from -5 to 40ëC. The frequency change 
is 100 MHz and the output power varies from 6.7 dBm to 7.9 dBm. 
In this temperature test, the oscillation has been found stable 
for OFF and ON of bias supply. Figure 9 shows a measured 
spectrum of the DRO.

<FIG ID=JPRS-JST-012L-77D>      Figure 9. Spectrum of Oscillator Output Signal </FIG>

<H5>  VI. Low Noise Downconverter (LNC) </H5>
  Figure 10 shows a block diagram of the 94 GHz-band LNC. 
Since 
the purpose of the present work is to assess the feasibility of 
LNC, the developed InP-HEMT LNA, P-HEMT mixer and DRO are 
connected via waveguide interfaces. The waveguide isolator is 
used to ensure the LNA performance. The band pass filter is 
employed to eliminate the image signal at which the LNA has more 
than 15 dB gain. 

<FIG ID=JPRS-JST-012L-78A>      Figure 10. Block Diagram of LNC </FIG>


  Figure 11 shows the assembled downconverter. Figure 12 
demonstrates the measured noise figure and conversion gain of 
the downconverter. The noise figure is 4.9 dB and the conversion 
gain is greater than 11 dB at the center frequency. 

<FIG ID=JPRS-JST-012L-78B>      Figure 11. Outer View of the LNC </FIG>



<FIG ID=JPRS-JST-012L-78C>      Figure 12. Measured Conversion Gain and Noise Figure of LNC </FIG>


<H5>  VII. Conclusion </H5>
  We have developed two types of HEMT LNA, a P-HEMT mixer, a 
dielectric resonator oscillator using the planar circuit 
technology and successfully combined these components to build a 
94 GHz low noise downconverter. The downconverter incorporating 
the InP-HEMT LNA has shown a noise figure of less than 4.9 dB 
and a conversion gain of greater than 11 dB at 94 GHz-band. 
  Our work in the next phase will include 
waveguide-interface-less connection of the planar circuit 
components and the development of HEMT DROs.

  The U.S battery manufacturer Horizon Battery Technologies 
Inc. has established a representative office in Japan and begun 
activities for electric vehicle (EV) battery business with 
Japanese car makers. Horizon's lead battery consists of a glass 
filament coating woven in a mesh. In such points as durability, 
recharging time, and running time, it is superior to ordinary 
lead batteries. The company, in opening its representative 
office, is searching for business opportunities in Japan, where 
EV development is moving ahead. For now, Horizon will sell the 
batteries for EV use but is planning for the future to develop 
them for large-scale use in power generation. The company's 
battery consists of layers of glass filament mesh alternating 
with material permeated with sulfuric acid. The battery's 
features are that there is no leakage due to vibrations, the 
material is resistant to corrosion, and the battery requires no 
adding of water or other maintenance. The recharging rate in 
rapid recharging is 50 percent in eight minutes and 99 percent 
in 30 minutes. Moreover, the battery lasts through over 900 
rechargings, making it superior to ordinary batteries in cost 
and durability. In the United States, the company has had an 
inquiry from Chrysler, which is investigating the possibility of 
using its battery in electric vehicles. Horizon, judging that 
there is demand in Japan, where the Ministry of International 
Trade and Industry has been at the center of planning to 
popularize electric vehicles, has established a representative 
office here and decided to contact Japanese car makers. Horizon 
is a battery manufacturer established in June 1993 as a joint 
venture between BDM Technologies Inc., a company offering such 
engineering services as production technology and transportation 
systems, and Electrosource Inc., a venture firm that develops 
batteries. Horizon has been engaged in limited production of EV 
batteries. Moreover, having also been planning licensed 
production on a global scale, the company has been investigating 
the possibility of advancing into Japan.

  [Text] Research work on intelligent vehicles utilizing 
communication and control technologies have been promoted. Goals 
and objectives of its concept are to reduce congestion, increase 
traffic efficiency, improve safety and reduce environmental 
impacts. Operational test named Vehicle Information and 
Communication System (VICS), in which Toyota participates and 
plays a leading role is now about to start in Japan. In the 
U.S., lots of area-wide projects including large scale field 
tests have also been planned and deployed under the 
participation from public/private/academic sectors. While in 
Europe, PROMETHEUS and DRIVE projects are now running in the EC 
domain. 
<H5>  1. Introduction </H5>
  In Japan, experiments dealing with road information and 
traffic control system has been conducted since 1973 under the 
auspices of the Ministry of International Trade and Industry. 
Viability of this technology, which has exerted tremendous 
influence worldwide, is studied by VICS, a project that has been 
set up to use the public tests of the Ministry of Construction's 
Road Automobile Communication System (RACS) and the National 
Police Agency's Advanced Mobile Traffic Information and 
Communication System (AMTICS), and that is run jointly by these 
two government bodies the Ministry of Posts and 
Telecommunications. [as published] 
  In Europe, development of ALI started up in the 
mid-seventies, and a large-scale test, called ALI-SCOUT, was 
carried out in Berlin in 1987. International research projects 
within Europe were established with PROMETHEUS, launched in 
1986, and DRIVE, begun in 1988. In the States in 1987, the 
research team Mobility 2000 was formed as a voluntary group from 
academics, federal and state transportation officials, and 
representatives of the private industries. This group set up the 
foundations of IVHS America (the Intelligent Vehicle Highway 
Society of America), established in 1991. 
<H5>  2. Trends in Development Projects in Japan </H5>
  In the field of road traffic information and traffic 
control, 
a project called Comprehensive Automobile Traffic Control System 
(CACS) was begun back in 1973, and AMTICS and RACS tests 
verified that dynamic route guidance could lead to lower 
congestion. In the area of automatic driving, a vehicle was 
driven automatically at 100 km/h in 1967, and further R&amp;D has 
been done since then. The following paragraphs outline the 
principal projects in which Japanese ministries and agencies are 
involved. 
  2.1 VICS (Vehicle Information and Communication 
System) 
  The VICS Promotion Council was established in 1991 by 
representatives of the National Police Agency; the Ministry of 
Posts and Telecommunications; the Ministry of Construction; 
three extra-departmental bodies, namely the Japan Traffic 
Management Technology Association, the Research &amp; Development 
Center for Radio Systems, and the Highway Industry Development 
Organization; and over 200 corporations and organizations from 
the private sector. 
  The purpose of VICS was to provide road traffic information 
that would lead to greater safety, smoothing traffic flow and 
preservation of the environment. 
  The system can supply information on congestion, accidents, 
regulations, and parking space. This is expected to result in 
reduced driving confusion, the elimination of unnecessary 
traffic and well distributed traffic flow. Demonstration tests 
are planned to be carried out in Tokyo during 1993. Toyota is 
playing some of central role in this project, and its staffs 
hold the positions of Representative Promoter, Vice-chairman, 
and Chairman of the Steering Committee. 
  2.1.1 Architecture of VICS 
  Figure 1 illustrates the architecture of VICS. It is made up 
of four areas: information collection, editing and processing, 
communication media, and in-vehicle equipment. 

<FIG ID=JPRS-JST-012L-81A>      Figure 1. VICS Architecture (Source: VICS Promotion Council) </FIG>

  (1) Information collection: Congestion, accident and 
temporary regulation information is collected in realtime by 
vehicle detectors and ITV cameras and transmitted to the VICS 
center. 
  (2) Editing and processing: The VICS center edits and 
processes the received information and passes this on to the 
media. 
  (3) Communication media: Three media are being planned 
currently. 

  -  Beacon: This would send traffic information to vehicles 
passing directly beneath the transmitter erected on the roadside. 
  -  FM &amp; Multiplex broadcast: Codified traffic information is 
combined and transmitted in conventional broadcasts. Information 
could be supplied over a comparatively wide area of 30 km in 
diameter. 
  -  Teleterminal: This would perform two-way communication over 
an 
area of 3 km in diameter. This is now planned for testing on a 
commercial base now. 

    (4) In-vehicle equipment: Three types of in-vehicle 
equipment 
are being studied. 

  -  Map display type: Displays congestion information and 
parking space information superimposed on a detailed map drawn 
by the in-vehicle map database. 
  -  Simple diagram display type: Does not have an in-vehicle map 
database, but displays simple diagrams and text. 
  -  Text display type: Displays text and symbols. 

    2.2 ARTS (Advanced Road Traffic System) 
  With the 21st century near at hand, feasibility studies are 
underway for a road traffic system having new functions suitable 
to the next generation of roads. Research and development is 
being propelled by HIDO, the Ministry of Construction's 
extra-departmental arm, and associated private corporations. 
  The working groups of ARTS are the Vehicle Headway Control 
System Working Group, LCX (Leakage Coaxial Cable) Working Group, 
and Guidelight System Working Group. These groups are engaged in 
an extensive range of R&amp;D covering display and warning of 
surrounding vehicle positions, warning of on-coming vehicles, 
and continuous infrastructure-vehicle communication technology. 
  Here too, Toyota participates in the ARTS committees, 
technical sub-committees, and working groups. 
  2.3 SSVS (Super Smart Vehicle System) 
  The Association of Electronics Technology for Automobile 
Traffic and Driving (JSK) was commissioned by the Mechanical 
Social Systems Foundation to collaborate with interested private 
corporations on studying 21st century traffic and transportation 
systems that will incorporate dramatically advancing 
technologies in the fields of information communication, image 
processing, and electronic control. 
  From early in 1992, the following representative systems 
have 
been studied. 
  (1) Cooperative Driving System 
  Aims at safety for the vehicle group and smooth travel 
through vehicle to vehicle communication. 
  (2) Control Configured Vehicle System With Ultra-Little 
Vehicles 
  Aims at easing traffic jams by having ultra-little vehicles 
travel in groups. 
  (3) Active Driver Assistance System for Avoiding Emergencies 
  Aims to enhance safety by supporting the driver at each 
stage 
from offering information services through to automatic driving 
services. 
  (4) Advanced Intelligent Intersection System 
  Aims to make traffic safer and more streamlined by providing 
information, warnings, and traffic flow control at intersections. 
  (5) Intelligent Logistics Information System 
  Aims to improve logistics efficient and less labor-intensive 
by means of an intelligent control system using an integrated 
information network. 
  (6) Intelligent Situation-Recognizing System 
  The common underlying technologies for image processing, 
sensors and the above systems are being studied. 
  At the moment, studies are being conducted with the view of 
making specific project proposals, and Toyota staffs are taking 
part either as leaders of working groups or as committee members. 
  2.4 Research Committee on Provision of Expressway 
Information 
  In 1990 the Japan Highway Public Corporation commissioned 
the 
Express Highway Research Foundation of Japan to collaborate with 
concerned private corporations in studying technical directions 
of ``new information systems'' and ``automatic driving systems'' 
that are expected to be incorporated in expressway facilities in 
the 21st century. 
  The study group includes the Automatic Driving Subcommittee, 
the Driving Support Subcommittee, and the Vehicle Communication 
Subcommittee. Toyota participates in both the Automatic Driving 
and the Driving Support Subcommittees. The Automatic Driving 
Subcommittee studies concepts for automatic driving systems for 
expressways. The Driving Support Subcommittee is looking into 
obstacles and route abnormality warning systems, surface 
condition warning systems, poor visibility relief systems, side 
wind warning systems, and systems to supplement the driver's 
physical functions. 
  2.5 ASV (Advanced Safety Vehicle) 
  In 1991, the Regional Traffic Office of the Ministry of 
Transport formed a project team together with experts and 
interested automobile manufacturers to carry out research over a 
five-year period. The project is testing an ASV with the view of 
working out future safety measures. In addition to conventional 
technologies, the project is applying electronic control 
technologies in carrying out (1) preventive safety measures for 
normal traveling, (2) accident avoidance measures, (3) measures 
to mitigate the harm caused by collisions, and (4) measures to 
prevent secondary damage. 
  From 1992 through 1995 the project is building and 
evaluating 
prototype vehicles, and intends to expedite development of 
safety technologies. Toyota is also involved in planning and 
developing the ASV. 
<H5>  3. Trends in the U.S. </H5>
  In the late sixties, the Experimental Route Guidance System 
(ERGS) was developed under the auspices of the Department of 
Transportation. This system used loop antennas buried beneath 
the road surface to perform digital communication, providing 
vehicles with guidance on how to proceed to optimum routes to 
reach their destinations. This project was studied in theory 
only, and did not go as far as actual tests. Nevertheless it was 
a world pioneer in the field of vehicle information 
communication systems. 
  Following this project, attention turned to resources for 
extending and repairing highways. The expressway network that 
covered the entire nation made a tremendous contribution to 
America's economic progress. Meanwhile, there was a blank in the 
development of vehicle traffic/driving systems. Around the 
mid-eighties, problems of congestion, accidents, and pollution 
began to emerge in most regions. Clearly, further extension of 
roads was both financially and environmentally unsound, and the 
development of traffic systems was seen to be of increasing 
importance. 
  Birth of IVHS America (Intelligent Vehicle Highway 
Society of America) 
  Whether in terms of industry or academia, vehicle 
traffic/driving systems occupy a wide-ranging and vast 
territory. As well as the technologies in the fields of traffic 
engineering, civil engineering, mechanics, electricity and 
electronics, control, and information, the subject involves 
human factors and legal matters, and it has other facets because 
of its connection with traffic economics and traffic policies. 
These characteristics necessitate an organization with enough 
punch to provide general coordination for the entire field. The 
progress of projects in Japan and Europe involving industry, 
government and academic sectors served as a major stimulus, 
added to which there was a fear that U.S. industry would be left 
behind. Hence, in September 1988, Congress requested the 
Department of Transport to report on IVHS activities in America. 
Leaders of independent R&amp;D efforts in the various states 
banded 
together to form a voluntary organization of representatives 
from industry, government, and academia. 
  This was called ``Mobility 2000.'' As a result of many 
meetings, it analyzed the feasibility and benefits of technical 
areas, and summed up the importance and necessity of embarking 
on IVHS research and development. Largely on the basis of these 
results, the Department of Transport submitted a general report 
to Congress. Ultimately, the activities of Mobility 2000 
blossomed into IVHS America. 
  In December 1990, IVHS America was inaugurated as a 
committee 
composed of members from the industrial, government and academic 
ranks, charged with the task to engage in R&amp;D and educational 
activities related to IVHS technologies. In March of the 
following year, it was authorized as a Federal Advisory 
Committee for the Department of Transportation. 
  Objectives of IVHS America 
  The activities of IVHS America are as follows: 

  -  Advises the Department of Transportation with regard to 
IVHS plans. 
  -  Devises targets and plans for IVHS. 
  -  Promotes IVHS R&amp;D. 
  -  Engages in support activities for the preparation and 
decision 
to deploy IVHS. 
  -  Tackles administrative and institutional matters. 
  -  Coordinates international cooperation. 
  -  Tackles the setting of standards and uniformity. 
  -  Releases information concerning IVHS. 
  -  Proposes reform policies concerning central and regional 
jurisdictional matters. 
  -  Decides the architecture and role of the system. 

    Organization of IVHS America 
  Figure 2 [not reproduced] illustrates the organization of 
IVHS America. Members number upward of 500, counting corporate 
and individual members. Basically, industrial-university 
interests take the lead in conferences and committees, with the 
government assuming the office and secretarial roles. As the 
figure shows, there are 11 technical committees. 
  These meet several times a year to map out the plans and 
progress of the research and development for which they are 
responsible. Particularly influential are the committees working 
on developing systems, especially the Advanced Traveler 
Information Systems (ATIS), Advanced Traffic Management Systems 
(ATMS), Advanced Vehicle Control Systems (AVCS), and Commercial 
Vehicle Operations (CVO). Committees dealing with safety/human 
factors and legal issues check these aspects from the viewpoint 
of human engineering, the law and the social structure, and 
study ways obtaining consensus. The Advanced Public 
Transportation Systems (APTS) were added recently for the 
purpose of attaining efficiency including organic linkage 
between vehicles and public traffic systems. The committee 
line-up is completed with a special touch, the Benefits, 
Evaluation, and Costs Committee. 
  The task of clinching the roles for IVHS is taken on by 
subcommittees. These are the Strategic Planning Subcommittee, 
International Liaison Subcommittee, and Informational 
Clearinghouse and Editorial Review Subcommittee. 
  Operations of IVHS America 
  IVHS America was given an impressive kickoff when, in 
December 1991, the Intermodal Surface Transportation Efficiency 
Act authorized a six-year budget of $155 billion, of which a 
$660 million, six-year budget was allocated for R&amp;D. Congress 
directed the Department of Transportation to submit a 
``Strategic Plan for IVHS in the United States.'' In June 1992, 
in response to the request from the Department of 
Transportation, IVHS America set out a strategic scenario for 
R&amp;D covering time spans of 5, 10, and 20 years, and plans for 
proceeding with and deploying IVHS. It has been acting 
vigorously since then. The following November it submitted the 
1994-95 Tactical Plan based on the strategic plan. This 
delineated the order of priority for R&amp;D and field tests, as 
well as requests for funding. 
  In the realm of international cooperation, IVHS America has 
been no less energetic, visiting Europe and Japan to observe how 
other nations are going about their R&amp;D and seeking technical 
and human resources exchange. In Japan, the Ministry of 
International Trade and Industry (MITI) noted this trend, and 
set about plans for interchange of IVHS America people, for 
information exchange, and for international activities that 
would set the stage for standardization. 
  Toyota's Participation in IVHS America 
  Toyota was a corporate member of IVHS America from the 
outset, and collaborates with TTC, TMCS and the U.S. Toyota 
Group companies in having seats on all the various technical 
committees, making diverse proposals and providing technical 
cooperation, and positively contributing to international 
interchange activities. Further, this Spring, Toyota cooperated 
in sending a Japan Fellow from the JSK to work in the IVHS 
America office, and also began committee activities and 
information exchange. 
  The following sections introduce some of the experimental 
projects involving basic research by traffic and transportation 
research institutes of leading universities, information 
communication systems developed mainly by private industry, and 
guidance from state authorities. 
  3.1 Pathfinder Project 
  Between Los Angeles and Santa Monica runs one highway and 
five parallel general roads. This project was begun for the 
purpose of resolving the chronic highway congestion here, by 
using information communication technology to send appropriate 
information to drivers and to control traffic overall. 
  This project is operated by the Californian State 
Transportation Committee and the California Department of 
Transportation. It has a budget of around $40 million. Different 
means of transmitting information to the driver are being used, 
such as traffic information services via radio broadcasts and 
telephone, communication from the roadside infrastructure to the 
vehicle's navigation system, and changeable message boards. The 
experiment has now entered Phase III. 
  3.2 Guidestar Project 
  This is a large-scale experiment covering a 250-mile highway 
stretching between the twin cities of Minneapolis and Saint Paul 
in Minnesota. The project aims to reduce congestion and 
accidents and to improve mobility by providing traffic control 
and traffic information. 
  The project is run by the Federal Highway Agency (FHWA), the 
Minnesota State Department of Transportation, and the Minnesota 
University Traffic Research Center. Currently the experiment 
covers an array of services including information on congestion 
status and the shortest route to the driver's destination, 
online control of high-speed lamps and interchanges, and 
realtime processing for accidents. 
  3.3 TravTek Project 
  TravTek is the name of a field test in Orlando, Florida 
(home 
of Disneyworld) offering travel information, traffic 
information, route guidance and other driver service information. 
  In this test, a traffic control center offers realtime 
information via digital data broadcasts to 100 rental cars 
equipped with in-vehicle devices that can display the following 
information: 

  -  Map information and text information on locations of 
traffic congestion, accidents and construction, as well as other 
services. 
  -  Route guidance by means of simple symbols such as directional 
arrow 

    This spring marks the end of the one-year test. The system 
is 
now being evaluated and improved. 
<H5>  4. Trends in Development Projects in Europe </H5>
  In Europe, from 1979 through 1982, the Autofahrer Leitund 
Informations System (ALI) developed by Volkswagen and Blaupunkt 
was tested on the German autobahn. ALI was a route guidance 
system using an induction loop for infrastructure-vehicle 
communication and measuring traffic flow. Later, ALI merged with 
the Siemens-developed AUTOSCOUT, which used infrared ray 
communication. The new ALI-SCOUT implemented full-scale tests in 
Berlin in 1991. 
  In Europe, the all-embracing R&amp;D project for vehicle 
traffic/driving systems was PROMETHEUS, promoted by a group 
representing most European car manufacturers. It has been 
succeeded by DRIVE, a project promoted by the EC. 
  PROMETHEUS and DRIVE conduct R&amp;D of European unified 
traffic 
and driving systems from the standpoints of the vehicle and 
infrastructure respectively. These projects are planning and 
implementing deployment experiments currently. In 1991, the 
European Road Transport Telematics Implementation Co-ordination 
Organization (ERTICO) was established as a nonprofit, 
pan-European organization to promote deployment tests of the 
R&amp;D 
results of such projects as PROMETHEUS and DRIVE. ERTICO aims to 
propel these projects along by promoting such activities as 
liaison among concerned parties, legal issues, funding, and 
forming friendly public opinions. 
  4.1 PROMETHEUS (PROgraMme for a European Traffic with 
Highest Efficiency and Unprecedented Safety) 
  PROMETHEUS was begun by the European automotive industry, 
merging with the EUREKA project in 1986. 
  In 1986, 19 automobile manufacturers, 56 electronics 
manufacturers and 115 basic research institutes had joined the 
project and were making research proposals. In the 1989 research 
phase, its annual budget was 90 MECU, two-thirds of which was 
borne by private industry. The remaining third was supplied by 
the various governments. 
  PROMETHEUS aims to develop an accident avoidance system to 
reduce accidents, a superior traffic information system to 
reduce fuel consumption, noise, and exhaust, and a 
state-of-the-art information system to improve traffic flow. 
  In the PROMETHEUS approach, a vehicle is one element in the 
traffic system, and the in-vehicle and infrastructure 
information technology are to be developed together. When the 
traffic infrastructure for all Europe is completed, it is 
predicted that road safety will improve by 30 percent and that 
traffic will become 20 percent more efficient. In September 
1991, the results of PROMETHEUS research were put through a 
demonstration test in Torino, Italy. The details are outlined 
below. 
  Vision Enhancement 
  This function provides the driver with visual information 
about the scenery and road conditions. Ultraviolet illumination 
is used to light up traffic signs, pedestrians, and vehicles. 
Research is looking into displaying images taken by a near 
infrared camera to warn of danger, displaying thermal images of 
pedestrians taken by a far infrared camera, and 
``head-up-display'' in which the scene the driver sees is 
overlapped with the image acquired by the sensor (for night and 
foggy scenarios). 
  Ultraviolet and infrared rays do not dazzle the occupants of 
the oncoming vehicle, and yet it enables vision that is 
unattainable by normal illumination. 
  Lateral Control 
  This function detects the lane clearly marked on the road, 
and either gives a warning or corrects the steering when the 
driver's attention slackens so much that the vehicle is about to 
veer out of the lane. 
  Collision Avoidance 
  Multiple sensors detect the conditions in front of the 
vehicle, and control the axle, break, and handle. 
  Microwave radar, laser radar, TV camera and image processing 
technologies are being studied as means of recognizing the 
surrounding conditions. Through vehicle to vehicle 
communication, vehicle movements can be mutually adjusted, and 
information communicated. The collision avoidance technology may 
be used in the short term for warning. 
  Cooperative Driving and Emergency Warning 
  Medium-range road information can be exchanged through 
intervehicle and vehicle-infrastructure communication, so that 
accidents ahead can be reported to police, ambulance and 
following traffic, and collisions can be avoided. 
  Autonomous Intelligent Cruise Control 
  When no vehicle is detected ahead, this function works like 
an ordinary cruise control. When a vehicle is detected, it 
switches to distance control. The sensor used is similar to the 
collision avoidance sensor described above. This control does 
not include the steering wheel, but controls the axle and break. 
  Commercial Fleet Management 
  A European unified information chain is to be created to 
enable improved transport planning, lower unused cargo space, 
monitor valuable and dangerous cargoes, and improve emergency 
reporting procedures. The system will enable position 
determination, and communication of traffic information and 
freight service messages. 
  Dual Mode Route Guidance System 
  This system provides route guidance by using realtime 
traffic 
information. Currently, media being studied for communicating 
the traffic information include FM multiplex, digital cellular 
phone, and roadside beacon. 
  Travel Information Services 
  Travelers will be provided with public transport 
information, 
as well as information and booking services for Park &amp; Ride 
facilities. Travel information will be available at home, the 
office, public terminals, and in the vehicle, and technologies 
employed will include FM multiplex, telephone, and Videotex. 
  4.2 DRIVE (Dedicated Road and Infrastructure for 
Vehicle safety in Europe) 
  Underwritten by the EC, DRIVE is one of the EC R&amp;D 
programs 
aimed at strengthening the international competitiveness of 
European industries. The purpose of DRIVE is to build a uniform 
European traffic infrastructure. DRIVE has been given stimulus 
by the research into vehicle traffic/driving systems carried out 
in different countries, such as the PROMETHEUS project. Its 
establishment was announced in 1987, and it was launched 
formally in 1988. With 71 projects being funded, its budget is 
around 60 MECU. 
  DRIVE works on R&amp;D into traffic information 
technologies, 
evaluation of strategic options, and proposals for 
standardization. 
  Technical Fields Studied by DRIVE 
  DRIVE is studying project deployment in the fields listed 
below, from the viewpoints of social, legal and institutional 
issues. 

  -  Dynamic route guidance using cellular phones 
  -  Prototypes of automatic tolling systems 
  -  Prototype of digital maps 
  -  Prototypes of all types of traffic control systems 
  -  Incorporation of route guidance in traffic control systems 
  -  Reduction of air pollution through communication systems 
  -  Management of commercial freight operations 

    The original DRIVE project was wound up in 1992, and was 
succeeded by DRIVE II, which is being implemented between 1991 
and 1994. The activities of DRIVE II fall into three types, 
being deployment strategies for system engineering in the 
Advanced Transport Telematics (ATT) field, technical research, 
and evaluation of pilot projects. Topics covered by DRIVE II 
research include the following: 

  -  Demand Management 
  -  Traffic and Travel Information 
  -  Integrated Urban Traffic Management 
  -  Integrated Inter-urban Traffic Management 
  -  Driver Assistance &amp; Cooperative Driving 
  -  Freight &amp; Fleet Management 
  -  Public Transport Management 

<H5>    5. Conclusion </H5>
  In the 1970's, such projects as Japan's CACS and West 
Germany's ALI were at the stage of detecting traffic flow and 
optimizing control of traffic lights, and gave guidance to 
vehicles in an overall effort to improve traffic flow. 
  In the latter half of the eighties, Europe had two major 
projects underway, the manufacturer-oriented PROMETHEUS and the 
government-led DRIVE, in readiness to build an all-Europe 
uniform traffic communications environment. 
  These movements prompted the U.S. interests to form Mobility 
2000, out of which grew IVHS America, a project devoted to 
comprehensive development and demonstration test strategies. 
  The Japanese projects and IVHS America have been influenced 
by the fact that PROMETHEUS offers in-vehicle control in 
addition to traffic information, route guidance, and traffic 
management. 
  Thus, the Japanese, American and European projects have 
proceeded with their R&amp;D and demonstration tests while 
keeping 
an eye on developments elsewhere, and it appears that we are 
about to witness a tremendous surge in the role of intelligent 
functions in vehicles and traffic infrastructure. The automobile 
is a global product, and we must try to increasingly supply 
excellent products at low cost, as well as prevent user 
confusion caused by differing operation methods. To this end we 
need to standardize the systems worldwide in the early stages 
through automobile manufacturers, infrastructure manufacturers, 
governments and academicians cooperating on a global scale to 
map out the system construction.

 Development 
Planning Div.] 
  [Text] Various intelligent technologies and devices have 
been introduced into vehicles to improve safety, comfortability, 
reliability and economy, to satisfy the requirements for 
environmental protection and information-oriented society, and 
to incorporate considerations for the growing aged population. 
Especially in the fields of active safety design and 
human-machine interface, remarkable progress has been made by 
utilizing advanced electronics and other technologies. The 
technologies expected for providing vehicles with further 
intelligence in response to the social demands should cover a 
very wide range including materials, semiconductors, control 
methods, information communication and ergonomics. In other 
words, we must develop vehicles that are kind to people, society 
and the earth by making effective use of the fruits of the 
research and development activities in these fields. 
<H5>  1. Introduction </H5>
  Development of automotive technologies in the history of 
automobiles over 100 years can be referred to as steps toward 
realization of intelligent vehicles. Driving vehicles may be 
considered a combination of high-grade complicated physical and 
mental (intellectual) activities. Technologies for supporting 
and executing these activities can be called intelligent 
technologies in a wide sense. Some examples of intelligent 
technologies introduced in the past are checking the driver's 
operation, unit operation, meter indications and driving 
environment as well as information exchange with external 
systems. Vehicles today are based on technologies in a very wide 
range. In the process of providing vehicles with further 
intelligence in the future, the results of scientific and 
technological research and development activities in a wider 
range calling for interdisciplinary and interindustrial 
cooperation will be incorporated. In this paper, we will 
introduce the technologies which will contribute to the 
attainment and satisfaction of the existing and expected needs 
and functions concerning vehicles. 
<H5>  2. Assignments and Orientation for Developing Automotive </H5>
Technologies 
  The most important assignment for automotive technologies is 
to satisfy various requirements in the fields of environmental 
protection, energy resources and safety. Major environmental 
issues are exhaust emission control, improvement of fuel economy 
leading to reduction of CO[.sub]2[/], substitution of CFC and 
recycling of materials. Examples of exhaust emission control 
technologies are the three-way catalytic converter that reduces 
HC, CO and NO[.sub]x[/] at the same time, knock control 
system (KCS) that optimizes the thermal efficiency of the engine 
for better fuel economy and idle speed control (ISC) system that 
controls the engine speed at idle. Since improvement of safety, 
on the other hand, involves human factors such as drivers and 
pedestrians, results of future research activities in the fields 
of ergonomics, psychology and physiology are required to be 
incorporated. Implementation of active safety technologies for 
appropriate coverage of such human characteristics as fatigue, 
forgetfulness and mistake are expected especially. Furthermore, 
improvement of the human-machine interface and development of a 
traffic system that organically links roads and vehicles are 
desired in preparation for expected increases in traffic 
density, vehicle speeds and aged population. 
<H5>  3. Active Safety Technologies </H5>
  As the concept of active safety is relatively abstract and 
may be interpreted in many ways, we have tried classification in 
terms of the method for avoiding danger, type of danger and 
situation involving danger. First, the active safety technology 
can be referred to as the technology for avoiding human errors 
by substituting the operating functions of the driver. 
  The operating functions performed by the driver may roughly 
be divided into the seven following steps: 
  (1) Perceiving the present traveling state of the vehicle 
being driven and the surrounding situation. 
  (2) Predicting the state in the next moment on the basis of 
past experience and knowledge. 
  (3) Estimating the difference between the target (expected) 
state and predicted state to judge (determine) the necessary 
operation. 
  (4) Performing appropriate operations according to the 
result 
of judgment. 
  (5) Checking if the change resulting from the operations has 
brought about the optimum (target) state and performing 
correcting operation as required. 
  (6) Memorizing (or physically mastering) the result for 
future use in the same situation. 
  (7) Returning to step (5) or (1) again. 
  Though the time period for steps (1) to (7) is generally 
extremely short, much dispersion or an error will arise 
depending on the driving conditions (time zone, weather, road 
environment, etc.) at the moment and driver's characteristics 
(driving experience, age, degree of fatigue, etc.). In 
substituting a part of driver's operating functions that can be 
divided into steps (1) to (7) above, the active safety devices 
should perform the following functions: 
  (1) Supporting the driver's perceiving activities 
  (a) Indication of objective physical values by 
meters 
  (b) Environmental recognition systems (radar system, 
external pattern recognition system for perceiving obstacles, 
road signs and road shape, etc.) 
  (c) Systems for ensuring field of vision and 
improving visibility (automatic wiper, anti-glare mirror, 
monitor camera, etc.) 
  (d) Guidance for appropriate driving operation 
  (2) Alarm and warning by knowledge base 
  (a) Prediction and detection of inappropriate or 
wrong driving operation 
  (b) Indication of limits for driving 
  (c) Detection of abnormal vehicle state 
  (3) Emergency intervention 
  When the driver operates incorrectly to generate an 
emergency 
state for which simple alarming may be too late to avoid a 
danger, the manual input portion is isolated from the 
man-machine system and changed over to be driven by the wire 
system for forced braking or steering, for example. In this 
case, forced intervention of the machine side requires matching 
with the reaction and feeling of the driver. 
  (4) Partially automatic operation 
  This means autonomous driving by recognizing the external 
situation and calculating the path by the image recognition 
system and expert system during traveling in a fixed environment 
with relatively little external variation (noise) as on an 
expressway or traveling at low speeds as at the time of garaging. 
  The second type of active safety technology is for warning 
and alarming the driver by predicting and detecting 
physiological and mental states such as fatigue and drowsiness 
of the driver. Technologies of this type have been studied in 
the fields of labor science and ergonomics, but study in the 
automotive field has just started. 
  Development of technologies for measuring driver's facial 
expression, heart rate and brain waves, for analyzing the 
correlation with fatigue and for warning is necessary. 
  The third type is the technology for realizing comfortable 
driving environment gentle to the driver to cause little 
fatigue. It means to quantitatively grasp the conditions likely 
to cause fatigue of the driver and the environment comfortable 
or disagreeable to the driver so as to determine the vehicle 
dimensions and control the interior conditions accordingly. Some 
examples are enhancing the ride comfort, controllability and 
stability, upgrading the air conditioner, improving NVH (noise, 
vibration and harshness), and improving the visibility of 
display and meters. Especially in the field of display, long 
focal-length instruments (virtual image meters) and HUD 
(heads-up display) for reducing change in the line of sight and 
focal adjustment have been developed. Further upgrading by 
introduction of advanced holography, CG (computer graphics) and 
VR (virtual reality) is expected in the future. Table 1 shows 
the examples of active safety systems.

<H5>  4. Human Interface </H5>
  Human interface is closely related to the active safety 
technologies explained in the previous chapter. The speech 
recognition technology aims at reducing the operation load. 
Applications to mobile telephone (hands-free telephone), audio 
system and air conditioner operation, and destination input to 
the navigation system have been reported. The specific speaker 
recognition system was mostly used in the early stage, but 
unspecific speaker recognition system will be introduced in the 
future. These should be used selectively according to each 
application system. 
  The speech synthesis technology began with Toyota Speak 
Monitor in 1980, and has been inherited in the voice navigation 
system. It will be necessary to eliminate unnaturalness in 
speech generation timing, message repetition and tone felt by 
the listener for accurate understanding of the meaning. 
  As regards the display technology, it will become important 
to study the method for communicating an increasing amount of 
information generated both inside and outside of the vehicle 
accurately for easy understanding by the driver. It is therefore 
important to develop the display method (software) matching the 
characteristic of human sense of vision and the hardware for 
realizing it with good coordination. The display system in the 
cockpit of the airplane has optimized the priority of displayed 
information and selective use of colors in good coordination 
with the buzzer, synthesized speech and vibration. The 
instrument panel in vehicles will develop into an intellectual 
interface incorporating the knowledge in visual psychology and 
sonics. 
<H5>  5. Control Methods </H5>
  The term ``nonlinear technology'' has made its appearance 
only recently. It is a generic term for neural networks, fuzzy 
systems, fluctuative control, chaos and fractal. Application of 
this new technical thought to the field of engineering has been 
proposed. The fuzzy control has already been applied to cruise 
control, AT (automatic transmission) shift change control and 
air conditioning control, and pattern recognition by neural 
networks and nonlinear adaptive control system making use of 
parallel distributed processing and learning function have been 
reported. 
  The fluctuative control is based on the experimental result 
showing that fluctuation frequency f and the intensity of 
fluctuation (power spectrum) are distributed inversely 
proportional to each other in phenomena (such as breeze, 
vibration of vehicles and classical music) agreeable to human 
beings. (This is called l/f fluctuation.) The heartbeat cycle 
and alpha brain wave are also said to have the characteristic of 
l/f fluctuation. 
  Chaos and fractal theorems are said to be able to find out a 
certain kind of regularity in seemingly irregular events. It is 
possible that these theorems may be applied to the analysis of 
human body measurement data. 
<H5>  6. Information Communication System </H5>
  Adaptation of vehicles to the information age is an 
extremely 
important task. Mobile telephone and portable telephone have 
already been put into service as members of mobile communication 
systems and the demand is predicted to increase greatly in the 
future. Information communication is confronting a turning point 
as represented by implementation of the vehicle mounted portable 
telephone system and digital mobile telephone system as well as 
freeing of using radio equipment and antennas. 
  Communication networks surrounding vehicles with the public 
telephone network application system including vehicle mounted 
facsimile as the core are being enriched. In addition to the 
conventional running turning and stopping functions, vehicles 
can be said to have obtained the communicating and speaking 
functions. Future development to cover the satellite 
broadcasting, communication system, new cordless telephone (PHP: 
personal handy phone) system and future public land mobile 
telecommunication system (FPLMTS) is also expected. Figure 1 
[not reproduced] shows the communication networks surrounding 
vehicles. 
  The navigation system, on the other hand, will develop from 
the initial dead reckoning system to the map matching and GPS 
applied systems. In the near future, it will be integrated with 
the traffic information system for communication with the 
infrastructure as the VICS (vehicle information and 
communication system) for example. It is also expected that an 
intelligent vehicle/road traffic system with the road vehicle 
communication technology as the core will be implemented in the 
future. Table 2 shows the examples of future road traffic 
systems.

<H5>  7. Elementary Technologies </H5>
  Electronics has contributed much toward realization of 
intelligent vehicles. Especially, the development of 
semiconductor technology has been keeping pace with the 
development in the intelligence of vehicles. 
  Various intelligent sensors and actuators provided with 
excellent precision and response as well as many special 
microcomputers capable of processing high-grade control logics 
with sufficient durability to severe operating environment on 
vehicles have been introduced to combine electronic means to the 
conventional mechanical structure effectively so as to create 
characteristics and functions that are difficult to be realized 
simply by improving mechanisms. Development of high level 
programming language for automotive control system and 
implementation of the development environment for testing and 
debugging prototype programs are also important tasks for 
adaptation to diversification and upgrading of microcomputer 
systems in the future. 
  In the field of sensors, intelligent sensors with high 
precision in small sizes by high-precision microstructure 
fabrication called micromachining have been put into practical 
use. Some examples are the manifold pressure sensor for lean 
burn system, semiconductor G sensor for air bag and 
semiconductor negative pressure sensor for EFI. 
  Heat resistant elements, pressure resistant elements, power 
devices (contactless relays) and high density packaging 
technology or surface mount device technology have been 
developed in addition. Development of applications of the EEPROM 
and flash memory as memory elements is also expected. 
High-performance glass, functional film, electro-chromic (EC) 
and electro-luminescence (EL) devices, LCF (light control 
filter), high-output laser diode and radio-frequency oscillator 
are expected to be developed as display devices and new sensors. 
<H5>  8. Systematization Technology </H5>
  The fault diagnosis systems have been put into practical use 
in the forms of both on-board and off-board. It is considered to 
be improved further, but standardization in the industry is 
desired. 
  Effectiveness of the ECU network in suppressing the increase 
in the wire harness size has been confirmed. Standardization of 
the network protocol is being studied. Power circuit control 
will add to its importance for counteracting increases in the 
current consumption and engine load resulting from increase in 
electronic devices. 
<H5>  9. Conclusion </H5>
  We have roughly explained the examples of technologies for 
providing vehicles with further intelligence and the 
technologies for supporting realization of such technologies. In 
addition to the approach for providing intelligence by selecting 
intelligent behaviors of personified vehicles, we have also 
described the intelligence from the viewpoint of convenience of 
vehicles for people who use the vehicles. In providing vehicles 
with further intelligence, it is necessary to understand drivers 
as men and to study ergonomic design and human-machine interface 
further. In the future, we would like to form the desirable 
image of intelligent vehicle convenient for the people after 
fully understanding the difference between men and machines. The 
environment surrounding vehicles is expected to continue quick 
changes but the necessity of producing safer and comfortable 
vehicles that are kind to people and the earth will remain 
unchanged.

Development Div. III] 
  [Text] An Automated Highway Vehicle System using a computer 
vision system has been developed and some test running has been 
executed by the prototype vehicle. This paper describes a system 
architecture, a white line detection method, a lateral control 
method, a longitudinal control method, results of experiment and 
technical trends. The white line detection method has high 
accuracy and robustness to environmental conditions by using 
line edge extraction, a road knowledge model and electric 
shutter control. A lateral control method makes use of preview 
information (a front white line position data) and is able to 
execute a stable automated running at 60 km/h. A longitudinal 
control method is able to execute an accurate and smooth 
following running by driving force control method and a front 
vehicle detection method. 
<H5>  1. Introduction </H5>
  To realize the safer and more pleasant driving, various 
efforts have been made in developing intelligent vehicles. To 
cope with the recent large scale and complex problems of the 
safety, traffic jams, and other transportation and environmental 
protection problems, it is thought that the higher level 
intelligence will be required in the future. As one of the 
directions toward this objective, an automated vehicle system is 
drawing attention and vigorous research and development are 
underway (Table 1). With these in the background, we have begun 
the development of automated vehicle driving system in 
assumption of automated driving on the exclusive lane of a 
highway as we thought that it is the closest to the operational 
application of the automated driving. Functional requirements 
for the automated driving include a lateral control (lane 
keeping), longitudinal control, collision avoidance control, 
etc. and various methods are proposed for realizing these 
functions. Particularly, the running lane detection is the 
nucleus of the automated driving technology. Table 2 indicates 
the characteristics of the principal detection methods. Of these 
methods, the vision method, for example, has disadvantages in 
the processing speed and environment resistance (rain, night, 
etc.) compared with other methods. Yet, as in the case of a man 
who drives by watching some meters ahead, this method enables a 
smooth and stable lateral control since it can obtain preview 
information. In addition, using the preview information, the 
vision method can provide the front vehicle and obstacle 
detection functions which are important for the longitudinal 
control and collision avoidance control. In the case of other 
methods, completely different means are needed, however. Thus 
the preview information is the most important characteristic of 
the vision method, whose development to a system of higher 
performance can be expected with the application of recognition 
technology of road geometry, vehicle, and road sign. From the 
reason stated above, we have developed the automated vehicle 
system that applies the vision (white line) information. This 
paper reports on the system architecture, lateral control 
method, and the longitudinal control method.

<H5>  2. System Architecture </H5>
  Photo 1 [not reproduced] shows a prototype vehicle for the 
automated vehicle system. Using a Crown Majesta for the base, 
this vehicle is installed with the hardware shown in Figure 1. 

<FIG ID=JPRS-JST-012L-91A>      Figure 1. System Architecture </FIG>

  2.1 Computer 
  A computer (hereinafter referred to as ECU: Electronic 
Control Unit) is arranged for each device for the host, image 
processing, actuator control, and the sensor processing. With 
this architecture, the system has attained the real time 
operability through the load reduction from the host ECU, and 
the fail-safe measures through the mutual supervision of ECUs. 
  2.2 Image Processing System 
  The image processing system consists of a CCD camera and the 
white line detection device. It outputs the white line data for 
lateral control. 
  2.2.1 CCD Camera 
  A compact 2/3 inch CCD camera is installed to the left side 
of the inside rear view mirror. It has the lens focusing 
distance of 10mm and is mounted at a depression angle of about 
24 degrees in consideration of the effect from backlighting and 
the vehicle pitching and the white line detection area. 
  2.2.2 White Line Detection Device 
  While various methods are proposed for the white line 
detection, we have adopted a line edge extraction method for the 
present system in consideration of the installability to the 
vehicle and reliability. The white line detection under this 
method consists of the following two processing: 
  (1) Edge extraction processing 
  The monochromatic luminance data input from the CCD camera 
is 
differentiated using a method called Sobel operator, and the 
points having a sharp variation in luminance (for example, the 
borderline between the white line and the road surface) in 
succession is extracted as the edge. This is processed by the 
special hardware at a high speed. 
  (2) White line recognition processing 
  In the preprocessing, the edges of the roadside guardrail 
and 
the buildings are extracted in addition to the white line. To 
select the correct white line from this list of line segments, 
the following knowledge concerning the white line is used: 

  -  The detection position of the white line continuously 
changes. 
  -  The road curvature does not change sharply. 
  -  The white line segment is amply long compared with other 
false 
line segments. 

    Through the above-mentioned processing, the white lines on 
the right and left hand sides as shown in Photo 2 [not 
reproduced] are detected. The processing time required from the 
pickup of the image to the output of data is about 300 ms. The 
white line position data is output to the host ECU at every 100 
ms through the parallel image processing using three sheets of 
the board, however, and the lateral control is executed 
accordingly. However, since the brightness of the road surface 
varies by the weather, time zone, shade, etc. during the actual 
running, the electronic shutter speed of the CCD camera is 
controlled according to the luminance from the central portion 
of the running lane to maintain the robustness to the brightness. 
  2.3 Steering Drive System 
  The steering drive system consists of a DC motor, ECU, 
steering angle sensor, etc. as shown in Figure 2. 

<FIG ID=JPRS-JST-012L-92A>      Figure 2. Steering Driving System </FIG>

  2.3.1 Steering Actuator 
  The steering actuator consists of an electronic clutch and 
the reduction gear beside a 3 phase 12 pole brushless DC motor. 
The driving performance of the main shaft portion is as follows: 

  -  Maximum rotation speed: 80 rpm 
  -  Maximum steering effort: 3.53 N-m 
  -  Minimum steering angle: 1.67 degrees 

    2.3.2 Steering ECU 
  The steering ECU drives the DC motor according to the target 
steering angle input from the host ECU. It monitors the steering 
angle sensor to control the absolute steering angle and one 
steering amount. In addition, it turns the electronic clutch 
ON-OFF according to the instruction from the host ECU. 
  2.4 Longitudinal Distance Sensor 
  A scanning type laser radar is installed in the radiator 
grille. It has a scanning angle of 300R (minimum curve of 
highway) and is set for detecting front vehicle running 100 m 
ahead. 

  -  Detection distance: 5 to 120 m 
  -  Scanning range: +/- 15 degrees (horizontal direction) 
  -  Beam vertical angle: +/- 0.5 degree (vertical direction) 
  -  Scanning time: 120 ms/scan 

<H5>    3. Vehicle Control Algorithm </H5>
  This section describes the lateral control method, 
longitudinal control method, and the front vehicle detection 
method for vehicle control. 
  3.1 Lateral Control Method 
  In the lateral control, compatibility is demanded between 
the 
high precision lane keeping performance and the direction 
keeping performance to a target lane. 
  Several control methods have been proposed concerning the 
steering control.[.sup]1,2[/] We have examined a linear 
predictable correction model as shown in Figure 3 in 
consideration of the control performance[.sup]3[/] of the 
various control models and the capacity of CPU used. To simplify 
the control system, the steering drive system has been 
structured to respond promptly to the vehicle dynamics and that 
with the servo mechanism functioning independently to a target 
steering angle. Consequently, for the control system, a PD 
controller to compensate for the deviation (lateral deviation) 
and the direction (differential of lateral deviation) to the 
target lane as shown with equation (1): 
  _th_ = K(L, V)e[.sub]t[/] + G(L, 
V)(e[.sub]t[/]-e[.sub]t-1[/]) (1) 
  Where: 
  _th_ = Target steering angle 
  L = Preview distance 
  V = Vehicle speed 
  K(L, V) = Proportional gain 
  G(L, V) = Differential gain 
  e[.sub]t[/], e[.sub]t-1[/] = Lateral deviation 

<FIG ID=JPRS-JST-012L-93A>      Figure 3. Steering Control Model </FIG>

  3.2 Longitudinal Control Method 
  Important things in the lateral and the collision avoidance 
control are correct detection of front vehicle on the own 
running lane and the precision maintenance of safe longitudinal 
distance from it for the purpose of maintenance of the safety 
and the improvement of traffic efficiency. 
  3.2.1 Front Vehicle Detection Method 
  To correctly detect the front vehicle and the collision 
avoidance object on the own lane, the detection accuracy has 
been improved by combining the scan type laser radar with 
images. First, the own running lane (white line) as obtained 
from the images is converted to the plane 
coordinates.[.sup]4[/] And if a point presumed to be a 
vehicle from the distance data and the horizontal angle data 
from the laser radar should exist inside the own lane on the 
plane coordinates, it is judged to be the front vehicle. 
  Figure 4 shows the front vehicle detection by converting the 
white line data on the image picked up from the curve of 150R to 
the plane coordinates on which the distance data is laid. In 
this case, the lane detection error was maximum 1.2 m in the 
longitudinal direction and 0.2 m in the lateral direction. 

<FIG ID=JPRS-JST-012L-93B>      Figure 4. Front Vehicle Detection </FIG>

  3.2.2 Longitudinal Control Method 
  To maintain a longitudinal control correctly, a driving 
force 
control method using the vehicle model was examined. As shown in 
equation (2), the target driving force is calculated from the 
target longitudinal distance, real longitudinal distance, closed 
relative velocity, etc., and the throttle and brake are 
controlled according to the value of driving force. 
  F = M(K(D-D[.sub]t[/])-GV[.sub]r[/]) (2) 
  F ò Mg[.sub]0[/] throttle control 
  F &lt; Mg[.sub]0[/] brake control 
  Where: 
  F = Target driving force 
  M = Vehicle mass 
  L = Proportional gain 
  G = Differential gain 
  D = Real longitudinal distance 
  D[.sub]t[/] = Target longitudinal distance 
  V[.sub]r[/] = Closed relative velocity 
  g[.sub]0[/] = Coastdown deceleration 
<H5>  4. Running Test </H5>
  4.1 Result of Lateral Control 
  Running tests were conducted on the test course including 
curves of minimum 80R to examine the characteristics of 
respective parameters, and the target control constants were set 
up. 
  4.1.1 Setting of Parameters 
  First the basic examination was conducted using the 
simulation of simple vehicle model on the preview distance L and 
the control gain. The control gain was set so that the lateral 
deviation e from the target lane in the straight running will be 
the minimum value. When the vehicle passed the curve of 80R 
under the same gain, the lane keeping performance was maintained 
while the preview distance L = 15 to 30 m, but when L = under 15 
m, the lane keeping performance was understeer, and when L = 
over 30 m, the same performance was oversteer. 
  Using the above results as precondition, a running test was 
conducted at 60 km/h to obtain the target preview distance L and 
the control gain. The preview distance L was set for 10, 20, and 
30 m. On each preview distance, the gain was set so that the 
lateral deviation e on the straight course and the curve (80R) 
will be a minimum and the vehicle was run under the automated 
steering. Figures 5 and 6 show the result of the testing from 
which the following matters have been understood on the preview 
distance L and the control gain: 

  -  When L is made greater, the proportional gain becomes 
smaller, and the stability increases. 
  -  The proportional gains for the straight line and the curve 
differ. When L is small, compensation is required by detecting 
the road curvature. When L = 20 to 30 m, a stable running 
performance can be maintained with a fixed gain. 
  -  The greater L, the faster the entry of the lane data. For 
example, steering starts before entering the curve and the lane 
is deviated toward the inner wheel. When L is under 25 m, the 
lane keeping performance is maintained. 


<FIG ID=JPRS-JST-012L-94A>        Figure 5. Preview Distance and Lane Keeping </FIG>



<FIG ID=JPRS-JST-012L-95A>       Figure 6. Control Gain </FIG>

  Judging from the above, the preview distance L should be set 
at 20 to 25 m to maintain the steering performance (lane keeping 
performance and stability). 
  On the other hand, the preview distance should be set as 
close to the vehicle as possible in the white line detection. 
This is for preventing the detection error due to the shielding 
of white line by the front vehicle when the preview distance is 
long, reflection of the sun light on the road surfaces, and the 
thinning of the white line on the image. 
  From the above, the preview distance L is set to 20 m for 
the 
present system. Then the control gain is set again by giving 
consideration to the balance of the running performance on the 
straight course and the curve. 
  4.1.2 Evaluation of Steering Performance 
  Figure 7 shows the result of automated running at 60 km/h by 
using the preview distance and the control gain as determined in 
the preceding section. When compared with the manual steering 
(Figure 8) for checking the steering control performance, it was 
found that the fluctuation of lateral deviation e was within 20 
cm for both automatic and manual steering. This indicated that 
the automatic steering has a fairly high level of lane keeping 
performance. When the yaw rate fluctuation cycle was checked, 
however, the cycle for the automatic steering was short. It was 
only several seconds to some 15 seconds for the manual steering. 
And the stability was somewhat lowered. This was caused because 
the steering actuator was of the step driving type which was 
unable to make minute steering and required more frequent 
steering correction. This fact is reflected in the steering 
fluctuation of these two modes of steering. The fluctuation of 
manual steering was +/- 2 degrees while that of the automatic 
steering was +/- 4 degrees. Thus, although the automatic 
steering was slightly inferior to the manual steering in the 
aspect of stability, it achieved such steering performance as 
the lane keeping, which was close to the manual steering, by 
using a comparatively simple linear predictable correction 
model. When the driving speed rises, however, time lag from the 
image processing adversely affects the automatic steering, 
degrading the lane keeping performance. This shortcoming may be 
coped with to a certain extent by adjusting the preview distance 
and/or the control gain. It is imperative for the automatic 
steering system to increase the image processing speed to 
realize stable driving at 100 km/h, however.

<FIG ID=JPRS-JST-012L-96A>      Figure 8. Manual Drive </FIG>

  4.2 Result of Longitudinal Control 
  Figure 9 shows the result of following running when the 
front 
vehicle is driven at 30 to 40 km/h. When the 
acceleration/deceleration of the front vehicle was under +/- 0.2 
G, it was possible to maintain the longitudinal control with 
about +/- 1 m error. When the acceleration/deceleration became 
greater, however, detection error occurred because of the change 
of the laser radar beam direction due to the pitching of vehicle 
body or the target performance failed to be accomplished because 
of the delay of response from the throttle and the brake 
actuator. 

<FIG ID=JPRS-JST-012L-96B>      Figure 9. Following Running </FIG>

  Regarding the front vehicle detection, the front vehicle on 
the own lane was correctly detected on the flat straight line 
and the curve of 150R. When the front vehicle was more than 60 m 
ahead, some detection error occurred due to the degraded white 
line data accuracy. 
<H5>  5. Conclusion </H5>
  We have developed an automated vehicle system using images 
(white line) as the principal information. We have indicated 
that a smooth automatic driving is possible at 60 km/h with the 
use of a simple control model. 
  Since the steering performance becomes degraded under this 
control method when the preview distance is made smaller, it is 
difficult to achieve stable driving with the deviation data from 
just under the magnetic induction cable, etc. Although preview 
information is quite effective, it is necessary to improve the 
image processing speed and develop a steering control method 
using the road information (such as curve curvature, etc.) to 
realize stable automated driving at a higher vehicle speed in 
the future. To achieve the operational application of automated 
vehicle system, it is imperative for us to develop an 
environment observation technique that uses the higher image 
recognition for the purpose of obstacle avoidance and 
coordination driving with other vehicles. Moreover, to realize a 
high degree of reliability, it would be necessary for us to have 
a composite system with the communications system and 
infrastructure in addition to images. 
  There is a prediction that the automated driving will be 
realized at the beginning of 21st century in some form or other. 
In either case, there are many technical problems to solve. 
Moreover, the automated vehicle system involves a basic problem 
of whether the responsibility of driving lies on the driver or 
the vehicle. In this connection, the matter requires thorough 
discussion so that the social consensus would be reached 
concerning the application system and the governing law after 
giving consideration to every possible situation that may arise 
from the automated driving. On the basis of these matters, we 
intend to develop more intelligent automated vehicle system in 
the future.

<F P=106> [Article by Toru Ito, Research &amp; Development Div. III] </F>
  [Text] Toyota Motor Corporation has developed a navigation 
system which automatically computes the route to the destination 
and guides the driver using a synthetic voice. This navigation 
system was developed for the purpose of providing a system 
capable of reducing the load on the driver and helping him reach 
his destination smoothly and more safely than by conventional 
means. 
  This system has the following features: route information 
display by means of digital mapping, present position indication 
and guidance timing detection via signals from a satellite and 
vehicle-mounted sensors, high quality voice guidance on the 
course to take and the intersection name, automatic display of 
intersection routing diagram, route re-calculating function, 
etc. This paper describes these operations and the navigation 
system configuration. 
<H5>  1. Introduction </H5>
  At present, ways of making vehicles more intelligent are 
being energetically studied all over the world. In particular, 
the vehicle information system is seen as offering the 
possibility of early realization of operational application. 
Overseas, Intelligent Vehicle and Highway Systems (IVHS) and 
other research projects are being vigorously promoted. In Japan, 
Toyota took the lead in 1987 by developing a location system 
that indicated the present position with a cursor on a color 
cathode ray tube (CRT), followed in 1991 by a navigation system 
that calculated and displayed routing to a specified destination 
in 1991. Thus, Toyota leads the way in the development of a 
vehicle information system. This voice navigation system is a 
more advanced version of the conventional navigation 
system.[.sup]1[/] Figure 1 shows the progress of these 
navigation systems. 

<FIG ID=JPRS-JST-012L-97A>      Figure 1. Progress of Navigation Systems </FIG>

<H5>  2. Characteristics and Functions of the System </H5>
  Toyota's voice navigation system has the following 
characteristics: 
  (1) Digital mapping indication using a full color Thin Film 
Transistor Liquid Crystal Display (TFT LCD) built into the 
instrument panel. 
  (2) Automatic detection of present position using a hybrid 
map-matching and Global Positioning System (GPS). 
  (3) Automatic calculation of a typical route to the vicinity 
of a destination that can be selected and specified from the 
address, telephone number and number of point, and on-screen 
indication of the route map. 
  (4) Route guidance in a high quality voice using the names 
of 
intersections, destination names of the expressways and other 
proper names recorded on eight Compact Disc-Read Only Memory 
(CD-ROM) discs. 
  (5) Automatic indication of intersection guidance diagram 
that enables the driver to determine which way to go at 
intersections and their characteristics. 
  (6) Route re-calculation function that makes guidance route 
changes to be made easily while traveling. 
<H5>  3. System Configuration </H5>
  Figure 2 shows the installation layout of the parts which 
make up the presently developed navigation system. Figure 3 
shows the block diagram of the same system. 

<FIG ID=JPRS-JST-012L-98A>      Figure 2. Onboard System Layout </FIG>



<FIG ID=JPRS-JST-012L-98B>      Figure 3. System Block Diagram </FIG>


  A 6-inch full color TFT LCD system is installed in the 
center 
of the instrument panel. The computer, CD-ROM auto-changer, GPS 
receiver and TV tuner are installed in the luggage compartment. 
The geomagnetic sensor is installed on the lower rear side of 
the roof. The front wheel sensor is shared with that of the 
Antilock Brake System (ABS). The GPS antenna is a planar 
microstrip type of a diversity receiving system. It is mounted 
under the instrument panel and the rear package tray so as not 
to degrade the body styling. The entire system employs a total 
of 10 CPUs. 
  Principal functions of the main computer (hereinafter 
referred to as the computer) are as follows: 
  (1) Calculating the present position, (2) drawing the 
digital 
mapping, (3) high-speed route calculation, (4) voice guidance, 
(5) indication of other audio and air-conditioning states, (6) 
indication of maintenance and other vehicle state information, 
(7) interpreting Compact Disc CRt Applied FormaT (CDCRAFT), (8) 
diagnosing and other processing. 
  Hardware includes two high-speed, 16-bit CPUs, 7M bytes 
memory, a graphic control processor, video RAM, a speech data 
processor, a high-speed communication interface with CD-ROM, a 
signal input interface from the vehicle sensor, and a drive 
circuit for geomagnetic sensor. The mapping and voice guidance 
data are recorded on eight CD-ROM discs in ISO 9660 format. From 
the quality point of view, Adaptive Delta Pulse Code Modulation 
(ADPCM) is used for recording the voice guidance data. Decoding 
of ADPCM is processed by a special LSI. The voice data is 
monaurally recorded with a cutoff frequency of 9.5 kHz and 
compressed 16 times. The computer accesses the CD-ROM and reads 
the ADPCM data to carry out D/A conversion each time voice 
guidance is needed. The guidance voice is generated by a 
one-channel audio amplifier built into the computer and output 
from a speaker mounted in the door on the driver's side. The 
volume is adjustable in five stages. When the guidance voice is 
output, the radio and/or other audio system output is switched 
by relay for this speaker only, enabling passengers to continue 
listening to the radio and/or other audio system output while 
the route guidance voice is being output. 
<H5>  4. Basic Navigation Functions </H5>
  Figure 4 shows the block diagram of the basic navigation 
functions. The principal navigation functions based on the 
digital mapping recorded on the CD-ROM include the following: 
(1) mapping display of the present position along with the 
sensor, GPS and map-matching, (2) display of reference maps and 
destination designations according to the address and/or point 
names selected, (3) calculation and indication of the route to 
the vicinity of a specified destination from the present 
position, (4) guidance to the vicinity of the destination using 
voice and intersection guide diagrams. 

<FIG ID=JPRS-JST-012L-99A>      Figure 4. Basic Function of Navigation </FIG>

  4.1 Map Indication of the Present Position 
  The present position is calculated by composing the findings 
of (1) geomagnetic sensor, (2) front wheel sensor, (3) steering 
angle sensor, (4) speed sensor, (5) GPS and (6) map-matching. 
Maps are displayed in 1/20,480 thousand [as published] to 
1/10,000th scale (1 cm on the screen is equivalent to 100 m) in 
double pitch. The map of the present position is automatically 
and instantaneously displayed on the screen by pressing the 
``Present position'' switch. The map scrolls smoothly as the 
present position moves. 
  4.2 Reference Map Indication and Destination 
Designation 
  Seven methods of designating the destination are possible 
including specifying of the name of the point, telephone number, 
and an enlarged sectional map from the master map of the nation. 
  There are 23 types of point names including addresses, 
stations, hospitals, etc. Moreover, using the touch-switch on 
the screen enables the destination to be set from a retrieved 
map. If a telephone number specified by the driver is not 
recorded on the CD-ROM, the area map is displayed from the 
telephone office number. If the ``previous departure point'' is 
specified, the system sets the starting point where the last 
routing guidance was made the present destination. This function 
is effective when starting out from a hotel or other point of 
previous destination. When the system is not operated for a 
period of time, a ``help'' function is incorporated that 
explains the operating method by voice. 
  4.3 Calculation of Route and Indication 
  After specifying the destination, the driver sets the 
conditions for calculating the route. There are two kinds of 
conditions. One is whether the route includes passing points or 
not. If included, they are to be specified just as specifying 
the destination. The other is whether toll roads are to have 
priority or not. If there is a passing point, the route may be 
set separately from the present position to the passing point 
and then to the destination. 
  When the route calculation conditions are set, the computer 
starts calculating the route to the specified destination. 
  A map is indicated on the screen in a scale that allows both 
the present position and the destination to be covered on the 
same screen. For the route calculation method, the modified 
Dijkstra's algorithm is used. If the destination is a long 
distance away, calculation time is shortened by using 
precalculated expressway networks. The cost of road links is 
determined by the length of each link, type of road, width of 
road, traffic control, and right, left and U-turns. 
  It takes an average of about 50 seconds for the computer to 
calculate and display the route. 
  If the destination is far away and the area is recorded on a 
different CD-ROM disc, the calculation may require 10 to 20 
seconds more time to allow the CD-ROM auto-changer to change 
discs. When the routing calculation ends, the entire route is 
indicated by a red link. 
  The computer then describes the main roads over the entire 
route to the driver by voice, for example, ``Take Route 123.'' 
When the driver checks the guidance and touches the ``Start 
guidance'' switch, an enlarged map (in 1/10,000th or 1/40,000th 
scale) of the present position is displayed with a red link. 
  If the driver takes the wrong route or intentionally detours 
from the set route, the screen indicates the ``Recalculate'' 
switch. When the driver touches the switch, the computer 
indicates the calculation for returning on to the initially set 
route in an area about 4 km away from the present position. 
Figure 6 [not reproduced] shows the recalculation function. If 
the driver desires to have the entire route to the vicinity of 
the destination indicated anew, he simply touches the 
``Recalculate'' switch one more time. The computer then 
recalculates the entire route to the vicinity of the destination 
from the present position and displays the result. Helped by 
these functions, the driver can easily change the guidance route 
at will according to traffic conditions, restrictions and the 
current state of the road. 
  4.4 Guidance on Route 
  Guidance on the route while traveling or navigating is 
basically provided through the coordinated operation of three 
guidance modes consisting of (1) display of a map showing both 
the route and the present position, (2) display of intersection 
guide diagram, and (3) route guidance by voice. 
  The driver checks the relationship between the route and the 
present position or the topography of the vicinity and the 
present position according to the map (1). 
  The driver checks the route and the name of the next 
intersection, the form of road connection at this intersection 
in detail, buildings that serve as road markers (for example, a 
bank), and the distance to the center of the intersection, 
according to the guide diagram (2). 
  The driver thus receives correct information on the 
direction 
to go ample time prior to arriving at the intersection where 
branching is necessary according to the guidance given by voice 
(3), enabling him to drive with ease without having to 
frequently check the information displayed in (1) and/or (2). 
This contributes to safer driving. 
  The screen automatically changes to the intersection guide 
diagram from the map of the present position approximately 300 m 
away from the intersection. Figure 7 [not reproduced] shows 
typical intersection guide diagram. 
  The intersection guide diagram indicates an area of 
approximately 150 m x 150 m in fixed state (without scrolling) 
with the direction of travel to the top of the screen. The 
distance from the present position to the center of the 
intersection is indicated by a bar graph in the lower right-hand 
corner. The circle and the arrow-shaped cursor move in about 50 
m steps to indicate the present position. The screen indicates 
the route on the intersection road diagram using a separate 
colored line. When the vehicle travels about 50 m beyond the 
intersection, the intersection guide diagram automatically 
returns to the map of the present position. 
  4.5 Route Guidance by Voice 
  Normally, the computer provides voice guidance automatically 
when needed. If the driver particularly wishes to listen to the 
voice guidance, pressing of the ``Guide voice'' switch actuates 
the system to respond according to the current situation. 
  Voice guidance is provided in complete phrases using a 
combination of basic guide text patterns, word patterns, and 
data on proper names. The basic guidance pattern is determined 
by the direction of travel, distance to the next intersection 
and the one after it, the type of intersection (a four-way 
intersection of an ordinary road, roundabout or expressway 
exit), the type of road (ordinary road, expressway, urban 
highway or toll road), and the width of the road (number of 
lanes), presence of toll gates, etc. Data on the proper names 
are used as reference to enable the driver to check the 
intersection and the direction of travel. For example, it refers 
to the names of intersections, expressways, national routes, 
expressway interchanges, and expressway destination guides (road 
markers). A female voice is used similar to that of a tour 
guide. Figure 8 [not reproduced] shows some examples of spoken 
guidance. 
  On a general road, the system provides guidance on the 
direction to travel and the name of the intersection about 700 m 
and 300 m before reaching it (in the case of a road having two 
lanes and driving on one side), or on an expressway, the name of 
the destination on the road sign or the road name about 2 km and 
1 km before arriving at the junction. In cases where 
intersections appear in succession and no distance is available, 
guidance is given for two intersections at the same time. When 
the vehicle has to travel a long distance after turning at an 
intersection, the computer explains the distance to the next 
intersection by saying, ``Continue cruising-along this road for 
about 4 km,'' so that the driver can relax and concentrate on 
driving. If the driver presses the ``Guidance voice'' switch 
during or before the guidance, the system responds by saying, 
for example, ``About 500 m ahead, make a right at Toyota Town,'' 
according to the current distance to the intersection. 
  Moreover, the system calculates the timing according to the 
vehicle speed and the time required to complete the guidance. 
Voice guidance is started slightly ahead of time so that the 
vehicle will be at the announced distance from the intersection 
by the time the guidance ends. The system uses over 120 types of 
guidance patterns according to the route and situation. As thus 
far described, the computer provides the driver with appropriate 
voice guidance in consideration of the road connection form, 
distance required for changing lanes, guidance timing according 
to the driving speed, difficulty involved in passing through a 
series of intersections, road sign matching, and so forth. 
  It has been verified that this intelligent voice guidance 
reduces the number of times the driver is required to watch the 
display and the time needed for checking, and lowers the 
driver's heart rate before intersections, and the load on 
him.[.sup]2[/] 
<H5>  5. Navigation Data </H5>
  The computer mainly provides maps of roads over 3 meters 
wide, road connection data for routing, junction guidance 
diagram, guidance voice and index data. Figure 9 shows the 
amount of recorded digital mapping data available. 

<FIG ID=JPRS-JST-12L-101A>      Figure 9. Digital Mapping Data </FIG>

<H5>  6. Conclusion </H5>
  We have realized an intelligent system for correct 
navigation 
that reduces the load on drivers by using large-capacity CD-ROMs 
and a high performance computer, voice and road data for 
guidance based on actual surveys of 160,000 intersections, 
optimized voice guidance logic according to route and driving 
conditions, flexible modification of the guidance route, and so 
forth. Future research problems include the provision of dynamic 
route guidance based on traffic information on road congestion 
and restrictions fed back by the infrastructure, as well as cost 
reduction and standardization of mapping data and the 
development of infrastructure. In the future, we expect to be 
able to develop more intelligent and practical systems and 
expand their use along with the development of the 
infrastructure as a means of improving the traffic environment, 
economic efficiency and safety.

<H5>  Abstract </H5>
  A lean burn engine has lately received considerable 
attentions in viewpoint of saving energy and prevention of 
global warming. 
  In 1992, Toyota introduced a new 1.6 l DOHC 4-valve lean 
burn 
engine to Japanese market, which was adaptable to medium class 
vehicle and vehicle with automatic transmission. 
  In this paper, a comparison is made between Toyota's 
previous 
lean burn engine and the new one. Further description is given 
upon fuel economy and exhaust emission performances of new lean 
burn engine, which are achieved through technologies such as a 
new intake port design and a new lean mixture feedback control 
system with combustion pressure sensor. 
<H5>  1. Introduction </H5>
  Reduction of fuel consumption has been attracting much 
attention in viewpoint of energy saving and prevention of global 
warming. In such a background, many engines adopt the system in 
which the air-fuel ratio is controlled in the window gate of 
3-way catalyst. This system is very effective in reducing the 
exhaust emission, but leaves a room for improvement in terms of 
fuel consumption because the air-fuel ratio is controlled at the 
stoichiometric air-fuel ratio. A lean burn engine is attracting 
attention as a means to reduce both the exhaust emission and the 
fuel consumption.[.sup]1,2[/] 
  Toyota Motor Corporation has long been studying the lean 
burn 
engine and has introduced several lean-burn 
engines[.sup]3,4[/] into the market since 1984 (Figure 1). 

<FIG ID=JPRS-JST-12L-102A>      Figure 1. History of Toyota Lean-Burn Engine Development </FIG>

  In this paper, we will clarify the problems with the 
previous 
lean burn engines and report a new lean burn engine we have 
developed for solving such problems. 
<H5>  2. Basic Construction of Lean Burn System </H5>
  Figure 2 shows the principle of satisfying the requirements 
of low fuel consumption and NO[.sub]x[/] emission in the lean 
burn engine. When the conventional engine is operated with a 
lean air fuel ratio, the NO[.sub]x[/] regulation standard 
cannot be satisfied within the allowable torque fluctuation 
limit. If the following problems are solved, improvement of fuel 
consumption can be attained while satisfying the NO[.sub]x[/] 
regulation standard within the allowable torque fluctuation 
limit: 
  (1) Combustion improvement in lean mixture conditions 
  (2) Precise control of air fuel ratio in lean mixture 
conditions 

<FIG ID=JPRS-JST-12L-102B>      Figure 2. Principle of Lean-Burn System </FIG>

<H5>  3. Outline of Previous Lean Burn Engine and Existing Problems </H5>
  3.1 Outline of Previous Lean Burn Engine 
  Figure 3 shows the construction of the 4-valve, 4-cylinder, 
1587 cc engine system for Europe (satisfying German exhaust 
emission control annex 23) used as the base for development. 
This is different from the conventional three-way catalyst 
system in the three following points: 
  (1) Intake port with a swirl control valve (SCV) (Figure 4) 
  With a partial load, the SCV is closed to make the intake 
air 
flow only in the helical passage to generate a swirl to attain 
lean burn, while the SCV is opened to attain a high output, with 
a high load. 
  (2) Sequential injection control 
  The injection timing is optimized to satisfy both the 
specified torque fluctuation and NO[.sub]x[/] emission. 
  (3) Air-fuel ratio feedback control in lean mixture area by 
a 
lean mixture sensor 
  A lean mixture sensor for detecting the air-fuel ratio from 
the oxygen concentration is adopted. It also serves as the 
O[.sub]2[/] by switching of the input circuit when the load 
is high. 

<FIG ID=JPRS-JST-12L-103A>      Figure 3. Previous System Construction </FIG>


<FIG ID=JPRS-JST-12L-103B>      Figure 4. Previous Intake Port </FIG>


  3.2 Fuel Consumption Improvement, NO[.sub]x[/] 
Emission and Problems 
  Figure 5 shows the relationship between the NO[.sub]x[/] 
emission and fuel consumption in each test mode. The vehicle 
used for the test was a manual transmission (M/T) vehicle in 
European specification with an equivalent inertia weight of 1.25 
ton. In the FTP-75 and EPA-HWY modes specified in Annex 23, the 
NO[.sub]x[/] regulation standard was satisfied while the fuel 
consumption is improved by 10 percent or more compared to that 
with the three-way catalyst system (stoichiometric mixture 
system). There, however, exists the following problems: 
  (1) Enlargement of lean mixture area 
  In the new EC mode (maximum speed: 120 km/h), NO[.sub]x[/] 
emission is relatively high and the fuel consumption improvement 
effect is relatively low. This is because the volumetric 
efficiency with closed SCV is low in the high speed area and 
relatively richer mixture is required to obtain the enough 
output. To reduce the NO[.sub]x[/] emission and improve the 
fuel consumption in the high speed range, it is necessary to 
enlarge the lean mixture area by increasing the intake air flow 
when the SCV is closed. 
  (2) Reduction of NO[.sub]x[/] emission 
  In the domestic 10-15 mode test, the fuel consumption is 
improved by about 10 percent as compared with the stoichiometric 
mixture system, but the NO[.sub]x[/] emission does not 
satisfy the standard. At present NO[.sub]x[/] purification by 
the catalyst is impossible in the lean mixture area, reduction 
of the NO[.sub]x[/] emission from the engine itself is 
necessary to realize the lean burn engine on a vehicle with 
automatic transmission (A/T) while satisfying the domestic 
standard. 

<FIG ID=JPRS-JST-12L-104A>      Figure 5. Comparison of NO[.sub]x[/] and Fuel </FIG>

<H5>  4. New Lean Burn Engine </H5>
  4.1 System Outline 
  The outline and performance of the new lean burn engine are 
to be reported here. The engine used for the test is planned to 
be mounted on M/T or A/T vehicle with an equivalent inertia 
weight of 1.25 ton while satisfying the domestic emission 
control standard (in 10-15 mode). Figure 6 shows the new system 
composition. The differences from the previous system are as 
follows: 
  (1) Enlargement of lean mixture area by adoption of new 
intake port 
  (2) Reduction of NO[.sub]x[/] emission by a new air-fuel 
mixture control system using a combustion pressure sensor 
  (3) Improvement of fuel consumption in stoichiometric 
mixture 
area by adoption of electrically controlled EGR system (A/T 
vehicle) 

<FIG ID=JPRS-JST-12L-104B>      Figure 6. New System Construction </FIG>

  4.1.1 Structure of New Intake Port and Its 
Performance 
  In the lean burn engine, improvement of combustion was 
realized by high in-cylinder turbulence such as swirl. The 
previous swirl intake port was designed to increase air flow 
velocity by restricting the cross section of the intake port 
(see Figure 4). In consequence, it was very difficult to satisfy 
both high volumetric efficiency and combustion improvement at a 
high engine speed when the SCV is closed. 
  To overcome this problem, a new intake port for 4 valves has 
been developed as shown in Figure 7. This port consists of a 
helical port and straight port which are almost separated. The 
helical port has a projecting wall for swirl generation. A 
two-hole type injector is adopted and placed downstream the SCV. 
With a partial load, the SCV is closed and the intake air flows 
mainly through the helical port to generate a swirl. A part of 
the flow is led through the connecting passage between the 
helical port and straight port and generates a high speed flow 
for atomization of the fuel on the straight port side. While the 
fuel was atomized and homogenized by a strong swirl (swirl 
ratio: 2.2) in the previous intake port, the new intake port 
adopts the fuel supply system with relatively low swirl ratio of 
1.7 to 1.8 to realize lean burn. As a result, the constriction 
of the intake port can be relaxed to attain high volumetric 
efficiency when the SCV is closed, and to increase the intake 
air flow by 45 percent. 

<FIG ID=JPRS-JST-12L-104C>      Figure 7. New Intake Port </FIG>

  We have compared the performance of the new intake port with 
that of the previous intake port. Figure 8 shows the comparison 
of the partial load performance in the lean mixture area with 
that of the previous intake port. The combustion performance is 
equivalent or superior to those with the previous intake port. 
It has also been found that the improvement of the lean mixture 
limit is effective for the improvement of the limit of dilution 
of the mixture by the EGR gas. Figure 9 compares the lean 
mixture area. The lean mixture area is greatly enlarged by 
adoption of the new intake port, and is wide enough to cover a 
practical cruising area in Japan. It also shows that the full 
load performance is much improved.

  The target air-fuel ratio in the feedback control with the 
lean mixture sensor should be set with a margin on the rich side 
from the lean mixture limit in consideration of dispersion of 
the sensor or engine and the weather conditions (Figure 2). 
Reduction of this margin will enable the NO[.sub]x[/] 
emission to be reduced. For this purpose, a new air fuel ratio 
feedback control system using a combustion pressure sensor has 
been developed. In this system, air fuel ratio is controlled to 
maintain the torque fluctuation at the specified level by 
detecting the lean mixture limit or torque fluctuation limit 
directly from the combustion state. 
  Figure 10 shows the structure of the combustion pressure 
sensor. The combustion pressure is transmitted from the 
diaphragm to the force detecting device via the ceramic rod and 
hemisphere. The force detective device converts the pressure 
into the voltage by the piezoelectric effect. This signal is 
output after amplification by the built-in amplifier. 

<FIG ID=JPRS-JST-12L-105C>      Figure 10. Structure of Combustion Pressure Sensor </FIG>

  In this system, the combustion pressure sensor is installed 
only at cylinder No. 1. 
  The control method is explained below. 
  (1) Calculating the torque substitution value (T) 
  The value substituting the torque can be calculated 
according 
to the following equation by measuring the combustion pressure 
sensor signal near the end of the intake stroke (P[.sub]0[/]) 
and at the specified crank angle in the expansion stroke 
(P[.sub]1[/]-P[.sub]4[/]) as shown in Figure 11. 
  T = _a_[.sub]1[/](P[.sub]1[/] - P[.sub]0[/]) + 
_a_[.sub]2[/](P[.sub]2[/] - P[.sub]0[/]) + 
_a_[.sub]3[/](P[.sub]3[/] - P[.sub]0[/]) + 
_a_[.sub]4[/](P[.sub]4[/] - P[.sub]0[/]) 
  where _a_[.sub]j[/] is the pressure-torque conversion 
coefficient with the crank angle as the parameter. 

<FIG ID=JPRS-JST-12L-105D>      Figure 11. Study on Torque Substitution Value </FIG>

  Figure 11 shows the good correlation between the torque 
substitution value obtained by this method and the brake torque. 
  (2) Calculating torque fluctuation [_D_T] 
  Calculate the average of the absolute difference between the 
preceding and current torque substitution values over N times of 
measurements. 


  (3) Air-fuel ratio control 
  Fuel injection time TAU is corrected according to the result 
of comparison between _D_T and criterion _b_. 
  F[.sub]i[/] = F[.sub]i - 1[/] + _g_(_D_T - _b_) 
  TAU = F[.sub]i[/]-TP 
  _g_: Constant (positive value) 
  F[.sub]i[/]: Fuel injection time correction term 
  TP: Basic injection time 
  Figure 12 shows the feedback controllability by this method. 
This figure shows the case where the lean or rich signal is 
input forcibly. 

<FIG ID=JPRS-JST-12L-106A>      Figure 12. Feedback Controllability </FIG>

  In either case, the degree of convergence to the target 
torque fluctuation level (criterion _b_) has been confirmed 
sufficient. Criterion _b_ here is determined according to the 
allowable surge level actually felt on the vehicle. 
  As a result of the lean mixture limit feedback control, it 
has become possible to reduce the NO[.sub]x[/] by about 30 
percent as shown in Figure 8, with the fuel consumption ratio 
remained in the same level. 
  4.1.3 Electrically Controlled EGR System 
  The EGR driven by a stepping motor has been adopted for A/T 
vehicle to improve the fuel consumption in stoichiometric 
mixture area frequently used in acceleration (Figure 13). 

<FIG ID=JPRS-JST-12L-106B>      Figure 13. EGR Valve Structure </FIG>

  As compared with the conventional EGR system, the new system 
has good EGR controllability near to the limit. And it allows 
EGR to be possible even in the high load area while the intake 
manifold pressure is low, because new system does not need a 
vacuum source for valve operation. As a result, improvement in 
fuel consumption is obtained as shown in Figure 14. 

<FIG ID=JPRS-JST-12L-107A>      Figure 14. Effect of Electrically Controlled EGR System </FIG>

  4.2 Effect of Fuel Consumption Improvement 
  As compared with the conventional three-way catalyst system 
engines, the new lean burn engine has been confirmed to bring 
about improvement of the fuel consumption by 9 to 11 percent, 
both in the 10-15 mode and at a constant speed of 60 km/h as 
shown in Figure 15 while satisfying the NO[.sub]x[/] 
regulation standard. 

<FIG ID=JPRS-JST-12L-107B>         Figure 15. Effect of Fuel Consumption Improvement </FIG>

<H5>  5. Conclusion </H5>
  (1) A new intake port satisfying both lean burn and high 
output up to the high intake air volume area has been developed. 
  (2) The NO[.sub]x[/] emission has been reduced by 
introduction of lean combustion limit feedback control using the 
combustion pressure sensor, allowing application of the lean 
burn engine to the 1.25 ton class and A/T vehicles. 
  (3) The electrically controlled EGR system adopted in the 
A/T 
vehicles has successfully reduced fuel consumption in the 
stoichiometric mixture area.

  [Text] On February 9, 1994, the Science Council (the 
Ministry of Education's advisory body headed by chairman Kenichi 
Fukui) put together an interim report entitled, "Promotion of 
International Scientific Exchange." It contains a measure 
designed to curb the excessive outflow of Japanese scientific 
talent so that the present lopsided international scientific 
exchange situation can be corrected. Pointing out numerous 
barriers to participation foreign researchers face in the areas 
of language and housing, the report proposes construction of 
additional housing facilities and other measures designed to 
remove these obstacles. This is the first time that the Science 
Council has put together a report dealing with international 
exchange. 
  The number of researchers sent abroad by Japan's national 
universities for the purpose of conducting research or to 
present their research findings is now reaching 36,000 a year, 
while the number of foreign researchers coming to Japan is no 
more than 12,800 a year (according to the 1992 record in both 
cases). In other words, the number of Japanese researchers going 
abroad far exceeds that of foreign researchers coming to Japan. 
  In order to alter this situation, the council's interim 
report requests the reorganization and strengthening of the 
Japan Society for the Promotion of Science (JSPS), an 
organization which serves as an intermediary in the matter of 
international scientific exchange. According to the Ministry of 
Education, in terms of budget and member lineup, the JSPS, in 
charge of scientific fields, compares unfavorably with other 
organizations similarly involved in the promotion of 
international scientific exchange, and the Ministry of Education 
believes that this is what impedes participation of foreign 
researchers in exchange programs. 
  In receiving foreign researchers, moreover, the council is 
requesting the JSPS to be flexible and ready to accommodate in 
deciding the duration of their stay and processing of 
formalities for determining their eligibility. Under the 
existing Japanese system, it was not possible to give an 
extension to foreign researchers if their stay in Japan does not 
straddle two fiscal years since, under the present system, the 
account for foreign researchers must be closed at the end of 
each fiscal year. Since such a barrier does not exist either in 
the United States or Europe, the report describes this system as 
"one of the features of the exchange program of which Japan 
should be ashamed." (Akito Arima, Director of The Institute of 
Physical and Chemical Research (RIKEN)). 
  Whether the enforcement of such a policy would resolve the 
problem of "an excessive outflow of Japanese researchers" is an 
extremely fine point. According to some sources, within the 
Science Council, there are those who contend that "if Japan's 
research level is high, then no matter how high a rent may be in 
Japan, foreign researchers would not hesitate even a minute to 
come to Japan."

  [Text] On February 1, 1994, Mitsubishi Materials made an 
announcement of its newly-founded, wholly-owned "intellectual 
property service" company. The new company will be engaged 
mainly in collection and analysis of patent and technical 
information concerning manufacturing, mining, and information 
industries. Effective February 1, together with the intellectual 
property division, previously designated as the patent division, 
the company will expand the scope of its activity, strengthening 
survey functions and going after orders from external sources, 
in addition to the management of various types of ownership. A 
target set for the first year is an annual turnover of &yen;200 
million. 
  The amount of capital invested in the new company is &yen;10 
million. Mr. Giichi Yamaguchi, the former patent division chief, 
has assumed the position of president. The staff consists of 13 
members, most of whom have been transferred from either the 
former patent division or the research institute. The new 
intellectual property division is staffed by approximately 20 
employees. 
  In the past, it was the patent division which primarily had 
handled the management of manufacturing and mining proprietary 
rights at Mitsubishi Materials Corp. However, as workloads in 
the area of information gathering and analysis had increased 
and, moreover, as the company had realized that technologies 
which it had accumulated in the broad business areas of metallic 
and non-metallic materials, machine tools, and cement would be 
marketable, the company decided to establish a new firm with an 
eye on consulting business as a part of the new venture. 
  In the beginning, the new company will provide service only 
to the head office's intellectual property division and the 
various firms belonging to the Mitsubishi group. In the future, 
however, the company will go after business from outside firms 
by offering consulting, technical training, and engineering 
development services in industrial proprietary rights, such as 
patents, utility models, and new designs.

  [Text] Gifu Prefecture's Kakamigahara City is planning to 
establish an R&amp;D base for virtual reality technology. The 
deindustrialization of the existing automobile parts and apparel 
industries, which have been hit hard by the high exchange rate 
of the yen, the city has decided to entice the R&amp;D divisions 
of 
VR-related companies to fill the industrial void. However, the 
fact that the local businesses have had little exposure to 
VR-related industries, combined with the fact that the 
accumulation of VR technology by the prefecture itself is 
neglibile, left the local companies in bewilderment. How is the 
city going to pursuade companies located both outside and within 
the prefecture to set up their R&amp;D bases in Kakamigahara? The 
issues are numerous. 
  Kakamigahara City is proceeding with this plan after it had 
been approved by the country under the provision of its 
Intelligent Construction Site Law (the law governing the 
promotion of the aggregate of specified enterprises designed to 
contribute to the advancement of regional industries). A total 
of 38 organizations and businesses, including Gifu Prefecture, 
Kakamigahara City, the Regional Development and Maintenance 
Public Corporation, and local businesses, invested in an R&amp;D 
organization, V.R. Techno Center, Kakamigahara City (Governor of 
Gifu Prefecture, Hiroshi Kajihara, serving as the center's 
director), which will serve as a parent body of this 
undertaking. Thus, the techno-center officially began its 
operations in April, 1993, with a total capital of &yen;2.3 
billion. Among the investors are Kawasaki Heavy Industries, 
Mitsubishi Electric, Sony, Sanyo Electric, Kansai Electric 
Power, Shimizu Corporation, and Sega Enterprise, an impressive 
lineup of major companies from outside the prefecture. 
  A site planned for construction of the center is located in 
the Suei District of Kakamigahara City, with a total development 
area of 17 hectares. Of these, an area of 1 hectare will be used 
as a building lot, with a surrounding lot of approximately 8 
hectares to be used in creation and maintenance of the "VR 
Techno Japan," a business development designed to attract 
private industries to construct their R&amp;D facilities. By this 
fall, the purchase of the building lot will be completed, with 
construction and creation of facilities starting in 1994/95. The 
sale of parceled land is expected to begin in 1996. In addition 
to VR-related companies, the city plans to invite participation 
of information processing, software development, mechanical 
design, and design companies as well. 
  The center which will be constructed at the investment of 
&yen;2.2 billion will have the floor space of approximately 
3,340 square meters. It will be equipped with a VR research 
laboratory, a shared research laboratory, a computer graphics 
and CAD/CAM (computer-assisted design and manufacturing) 
practice room, and a rental research laboratory. A large-scale 
supercomputer capability will also be introduced to the center 
on an hourly rental basis. 
  "Today, when even the automobile industry is facing 
deindustrialization as a result of moving its manufacturing base 
to overseas sites, we must make the first move by constructing a 
VR technology base." Governor Kajihara, who directs the project 
as the center's top executive, has high hopes for VR as one of 
the most promising industries to emerge in the post-automobile 
industrial era. The fact that Kawasaki Heavy Industries' 
aerospace division, equipped with a test flight simulation 
center, is located in Kakamigahara is an advantage to the city. 
The Prefecture's corporate enterprise section views this as an 
advantage since "the accumulation of aerospace-related 
businesses such as this will be helpful in the development of VR 
technology." 
  However, many local businesses have reservations as 
indicated 
by their reactions, "since the future is unknown, we don't know 
how we can participate in this project." Even among the 
corporate investors, there are some who are saying, "our 
investment basically is no more than what we felt was our 
obligation to the business community. The project itself does 
not interest us that much." In order to uncover companies' 
needs, the center established a research forum, calling mainly 
for participation of local businesses. Because of the 
recessionary economy, however, response has been slow. Akira 
Takeuchi, chief of the corporate construction site section, also 
[says], "VR technology is rapidly advancing. Of all the local 
self-government bodies in the country, we were the first to come 
up with this idea of using VR technology to revitalize our local 
economy. It simply doesn't make sense if we are to slow down 
now."

  [Text] The Patent Office has decided to assist ASEAN 
countries in their training programs designed to develop 
qualified corporate patent administrators and agents, beginning 
in 1994. This decision is calculated to achieve smooth operation 
of intellectual property right systems while, at the same time, 
protecting Japanese companies from the onslaught of the 
imitation products now flooding the market. The Patent Office 
will make arrangements for trainees to be received by private 
companies and patent attorneys' offices where they will be given 
the opportunities to learn and practice patent administrative 
work. The Patent Office is seeking the cooperation of 
invention-related groups under its umbrella, as well as that of 
private companies. This is the first time the training involving 
overseas private sector personnel is supported by the Patent 
Office. 
  With the consent of the Uruguay Round of GATT, ASEAN 
countries' intellectual property system and the functions of 
related government bureaus are rapidly being reorganized and 
improved. For instance, the Thai Government has raised its 
intellectual property section to the status of "bureau," while 
working on the idea of establishing within the baht economic 
sphere (which also includes Vietnam and Cambodia) a copyright 
center designed to provide guidance in the matter of copyright 
protection. Indonesia, in the meantime, began strengthening its 
intellectual property protection measure by establishing its own 
copyright-patent-trademark bureau. 
  In contrast to these governmental actions, very little has 
been accomplished by the private sector. This is attributed to 
the fact that companies in ASEAN countries, as a rule, do not 
have a section devoted to patent administration; moreover, 
lawyers or patent attorneys qualified to handle matters related 
to patent application and processing as well as protection are 
rarely found among company personnel. 
  For this reason, each country was searching for ways to open 
pipelines to private sectors. At the Japan-ASEAN patent 
specialist meeting held on January 15, 1994, in Changmai, 
Thailand, an overwhelming number of participants urged Japan to 
provide assistance in the training of private-sector patent 
specialists. The Patent Office, therefore, had decided to 
involve Japanese companies and patent attorneys' offices in the 
program, arranging them to receive ASEAN trainees and providing 
necessary in-service training. 
  Specifically, using Hatsumei Kyokai (Japan Institute of 
Invention and Innovation), (which made a good showing when it 
undertook the JICA-based training program), as a point of 
contact, and through the Japan Patent Association and the 
Society of Patent Attorneys, the Patent Office will request 
corporations, patent attorneys' offices, and invention-related 
groups to receive ASEAN trainees for in-service training. As for 
dispatching patent specialists abroad, the Patent Office already 
has sent examiners to Thailand and Indonesia to do consulting 
work as special advisors to the bureau chief of each government 
for a period of two years. What the Patent Office will do now is 
to offer this arrangement to businesses as well.

<F P=106> [Article by Haruo Shiotani, Editing Member] </F>
  [Text] The reason why sport is universally loved, 
transcending differences in language and customs of countries, 
is that it is played under common rules. Although these rules 
vary by the type of sport played -- some are simple while others 
are extremely complex -- basically, the same rules apply in each 
sport regardless of where it is played. Since matches are played 
with the same rules, they can generate tremendous enthusiasm in 
players and spectators alike. In J League matches, although I 
did notice violations of rules by some players, I was not 
convinced the referee's application of rules was correct either. 
This type of situation is creating a barrier to the 
internationalization of Japanese soccer. 
  The key to internationalization lies in common rules and 
fair 
application of those rules. This is not limited only to the 
field of sports. In order for all nations to compete and grow 
together, healthy competition is essential. In the field of 
economy, in order to prevent each country from making its own 
rules and using these rules as an excuse to close its market to 
other nations, GATT was created, a place where countries could 
get together and establish common rules governing tariff and 
trade. It was the United States which led the way, selling the 
idea of GATT to the rest of the world. That same United States, 
however, recently handed down its ruling concerning uniform 
patent rules, a decision which clearly violates the principle of 
internationalization. The U.S. has refused, for the time being, 
to change its system based on the principle of granting patent 
to the first to invent. 
  There are two types of patent systems, depending upon who 
will be granted patent, viz., to the first to invent or to the 
first to file an application. Although, at a glance, the system 
granting the patent to the party who can prove it was the first 
to invent appears logical; in practice, it is extremely 
difficult to legally establish who really is the first to come 
up with a given invention. The United States is the only country 
among industrialized nations which still is using this system. 
The system designed to grant the patent to the first to file an 
application, on the other hand, simplifies examination and 
authorization processes. This is the system adopted by most 
advanced nations, such as Japan and Western European countries, 
across the board. 
  Today, when technology is spreading across national borders, 
if countries do not have a uniform patent system, it is not 
possible to generate healthy competition in technological 
fields. The patent tends to create various problems which hamper 
internationalization, viz., examination setups, the duration of 
patents, and application of patents in foreign languages. For 
the past 10 years, the World Intellectual Property Organization 
(WIPO) has been working on the creation of new international 
rules by reconciling various countries' systems. 
  Based on the debate conducted at WIPO, a draft for the World 
Patent Accord Convention was completed last year and was to be 
adopted at a diplomatic conference. The focal point of the 
conference was whether the United States would be willing to 
change its "first-inventor" system. In response to the requests 
of various countries, Japan has been preparing for changing its 
setup by reducing the time required for examination and 
submitting applications in English. Almost all requests made by 
the United States to other countries have been accepted. Because 
of the council's report, the Bush Administration was leaning 
toward the "first-applicant" system. 
  The situation was changed overnight, however, when the 
Clinton Administration took over. The shift to the first 
applicant system was to be reexamined. In spite of the wishes of 
the various countries which had been anxiously watching the 
United States's move since last summer and waiting for its 
response by postponing the diplomatic conference, the U.S. 
recently decided to adhere to the "first-to-invent" system. The 
firmly-rooted opposition of individual investors, academic 
circles, and organizations (that do not have patent specialists 
on their staff) to the "first-to-apply" system appeared to have 
succeeded. 
  The realization of the patent convention, toward which the 
world's advanced nations had devoted their efforts during the 
past 10 years, once again has become remote. We realize that 
changing the existing system of many years at the request of 
foreign countries is bound to meet with strong resistance. 
However, they should know that in the matter of patent systems, 
all participating countries have made a concession of one kind 
or another, thereby equally sharing the pains resulting from 
such concessions without which new international rules could not 
be written. Only by competing fiercely on the common ground, can 
we develop superior technologies and achieve widespread use of 
those technologies. 
  I wonder if the most recent ruling by the United States may 
have the effect of pouring cold water, as it were, on the rising 
trend of technological internationalization. The United States 
had been edgy about the continuing copying of its technologies 
and designs occurring in the developing nations. At the same 
time, however, it had continued to give preferential treatment 
to its own patent applications by going back and recognizing 
pre-application dates as legitimate dates of inventions, whereas 
with foreign applications field, they considered only the dates 
of applications as the legitimate dates of inventions. 
  This may have been the reflection of the direction into 
which 
the Clinton Administration's technical policy is moving, viz., 
placing greater emphasis on industrial technology over science 
and application development over basic research. To be sure, as 
long as the present system is maintained, the chances are that 
the United States most likely will have the upper hand in most 
litigation concerned with intellectual property. It is a fact, 
nevertheless, that the respect which the world had held for the 
United States, a country which led the world in free competition 
under the slogan of fairness, will be severely damaged, because 
the situation is too much like a soccer game with one 
participant playing with an advantage of not having an off-side 
rule.

  [Text] The Agency of Industrial Science and Technology 
(AIST) began examining partial revision of the method of 
allocating research funds; namely, the addition of the "reward 
type" funding method, aimed at rewarding original ideas and 
results produced during the course of experiments, to the 
existing "budget type" allocation method, which is designed to 
fund projects only with clearly defined goals. Since R&amp;D 
projects, funded by the budget type method, cannot fail, they 
will have to select themes which are risk-free, namely, 
extensions of the existing technologies. Projects which are 
supported by the reward-type funding, on the other hand, can 
take risks, thereby producing totally unexpected results. 
However, since incorporating this new method of funding into the 
existing budget-based accounting system was found somewhat 
difficult, AIST will have to find a way to solve this problem. 
  For example, with a blueprint currently under consideration, 
MITI will provide a general research direction in its 
announcement, such as "an instrument for measuring emotion, 
designed to perceive such human emotions as joy and anger based 
on a person's appearance so that ideas or prototype devices 
which will achieve this goal can be solicited from researchers 
working at national research institutes, universities, or 
private industries." MITI, then, will select the best candidate 
for its project. What AIST is doing is to provide R&amp;D funds 
using a method known as "a competition with prize money." 
  With the existing R&amp;D system supported by the 
budget-type 
funding, at the time a project is undertaken, its method and 
goal, for the most part, are already decided. "Collect marine 
organisms to obtain useful genes and matter" and "Develop 
heat-resistant material and use it to build an ultra-supersonic 
aircraft" are two such examples. The reward-type projects, on 
the other hand, are allowed greater flexibility and freedom in 
terms of method and idea. 
  MITI has been successful in handling projects with 
relatively 
clear-cut goals, such as the establishment of semiconductor 
manufacturing techniques or the mass production of solar cells. 
On the other hand, its performance in developing uniquely 
original technology, the kind of projects which take the world 
by surprise, had been less than impressive. 
  Concluding that such weakness was caused by the vary 
characteristic of the non-risk type project research, AIST has 
designed the type of research known as a leading-edge research, 
which can permit a certain amount of failure, in its industrial 
science and technology R&amp;D system. 
  The idea of using a reward funding formula for a part of a 
MITI research project has taken the above design one step 
further. Since the project is open to all qualified researchers 
willing to submit their ideas or prototype devices and since 
their selection process also is open, they tend to be picked up 
by mass media, which means that AIST can hope for rekindling of 
public interest in science and technology.

  [Text] In order to promote cooperation with various 
countries in Asia, the Science and Technology Agency (STA) will 
establish an "Information Center" (a temporary designation) 
which will be in charge of gathering and making available R&amp;D 
information to various countries. This is a part of STA's policy 
aimed at a substantial buildup of ASCA (Asian Scientific 
Cooperation Association), an organization consisting of various 
countries' ministers of science. Moreover, in addition to 
pursuing as a part of an ASCA project the construction of 
researchers' international networks, a project which STA 
launched early this year, STA will hold an ASCA seminar in March 
in Japan. The seminar will be attended by experts from the 
various countries involved. 
  The objectives of the information center are to gather and 
make available data produced by research organizations and 
researchers of various countries so that they may provide useful 
information for those recommending international joint research 
projects or those drawing up government policies. The 
installation of the information center will not be officially 
decided until this fall when the ASCA members will assemble in 
the Philippines for the 13th ASCA meeting. In substance, 
however, STA plans to start the center's activities prior to 
that meeting and has begun collecting the following basic data: 
(1) catalogs of various countries' research organizations; and 
(2) trends of various countries' science policies. 
  Moreover, at the forthcoming meeting in the Philippines, STA 
will propose as an ASCA undertaking the global research network 
project, which was started early this year, with STA playing a 
central role, as part of Japan's effort to build a network 
linking research organizations both here and abroad. 
  The first task of this project will be to gather global 
environmental fluctuation data, including precipitations, 
vegetation, and oceans, in cooperation with research 
organizations in Asia. After the initial data gathering has been 
completed, STA's plan is to propose additional themes for the 
areas of life science and materials. 
  In the meantime, ASCA seminars, with the participation of 
experts from various Asian countries, will be held beginning 
this year. The first two seminars will be held in March, in 
Saitama Prefecture's Ohmiya City and in Tokyo. The themes will 
be "Science and Technology and Regional Technical Innovations" 
and "Use and Control of Microorganisms in Asia," respectively. 
  ASCA draws participants from 24 countries, including China, 
Korea, Indonesia, Malaysia, Australia, and New Zealand. Each 
year, alternately a cabinet rank officials' meeting or an 
administrators' meeting is held.

<F P=106> [Article by Kumamoto Technopolis Foundation] </F>
  [Text] Kumamoto Technopolis Foundation was established in 
November 1983 as a third-sector entity involving industry, 
academics, and government. In April of the following year, under 
the provision of the Technopolis Law, it was designated as 
Technopolis No. 1. 
  Located at the foot of the majestic Mount Gairin, the 
"techno 
research park," adjacent to Kumamoto International Airport, is 
where the Technopolis Center, Electromechanical Engineering 
Research Laboratory and Kumamoto University's Joint Regional 
Research Center, together with 12 companies, including 
leading-edge research laboratories and software developers, are 
pursuing R&amp;D activities. 
  The principal undertakings and characteristics of this 
foundation are as follows: 
  The Electromechanical Engineering Research Laboratory was 
established in April 1985 as a research organ of this 
third-sector foundation. The laboratory, staffed by 12 
researchers specializing in the fields of automation, computer, 
and data processing, conducts joint research with local colleges 
and businesses. It also undertakes both commissioned and its own 
independent research. The results of its work are reflected in 
improved technological capabilities, as well as new product 
development, of local companies. The laboratory, moreover, 
provides small and medium-sized businesses with technical 
guidance and consulting utilizing its technical know-how. 
  In order to assist in the development of technical personnel 
for local industries, the laboratory began giving a lecture 
series at Kumamoto University, providing "Tahara School," aimed 
at development of business executives, as well as a range of 
management and technical training courses designed for different 
levels of personnel. The laboratory, furthermore, is conducting 
a two-year technical training program with a one-to-one 
student-teacher (laboratory's research staff) ratio. The program 
already has produced 35 graduates, all of whom are currently 
active in local businesses. 
  As for the financial support essential to any R&amp;D 
activities, 
using the yield on the foundation endowment, several financial 
schemes, offering a guarantee of obligation or low interest 
financing, financial assistance to R&amp;D (no interest 
financing) 
and to joint industrial, academic, and governmental research 
(funding assistance), are being made available. 
  The regional technical exchange is being promoted through 
the 
organization and vigorous activities mounted by various research 
forums involving industrial, academic, and governmental efforts. 
Especially the "Kumamoto Intelligent System Technology Research 
Forum" (an abbreviated designation: RIST), whose membership is 
subscribed by 56 local companies and some 50 professors from 
universities and technical colleges, has contributed 
substantially in raising technical levels through annual 
symposiums on introduction of intelligent technology to regional 
industries, monthly technical forums, various types of seminars 
held several times a month, as well as through joint research. 
Moreover, when a bio endowment was established in 1993, the 
biotechnical R&amp;D enterprise was undertaken. 
  Information services offered to regional industries consist 
of online search of various commercial databases, including 
industries, manpower resources, technical papers, and patents, 
and the publication of a PR magazine covering the laboratory's 
activities. 
  The foundation has been active since October 1985, serving 
as 
an executive office of Japan Technomart. In July 1993, in order 
to strengthen the foundation's communication functions with its 
members, an advisor was appointed. 
  Since its inception 10 years ago, the foundation has 
contributed to the accumulation of technologies at 
Electromechanical Engineering Research Laboratory, the raising 
of local industries' technical sophistication levels, and the 
promotion of industries. 
  While further improving unique technologies and creating new 
ones, using as a basis the accumulation of technologies and 
construction of the industrial foundation achieved during the 
first phase, the Kumamoto Technopolis Program is proceeding with 
its second phase at the same time, undertaking construction of 
the second Technopark, whose aim is to create the "incubation 
field" complete with the "housing and recreational" environment 
and city functions which will be appealing to working people. 
  In the future, together with the promotion of regional 
industries by further strengthening ties with the Prefectural 
Industrial Technology Center and through the promotion of the 
joint project involving industry, academics, and government 
closely connected to the region, and vigorous support to the 
promotion of local businesses, the foundation will work on 
specific policies which will prove effective in the construction 
of the technopolis.

<F P=106> [Article by Hiroshi Kashiwagi, Director General, Agency of </F>
Industrial Science and Technology, MITI] 
  [Text] Taking this opportunity, I wish all of you a Happy 
New Year and offer my views on the coming year. 
  The world still is feeling the aftershock of a tremendous 
historical change which effectively ended the structure built by 
the East-West Cold War. Regional conflicts are breaking out in 
various areas of the world. Finally freed from the problem of 
military security, the United States and Western European 
countries are giving their domestic economic issues their first 
priority. Triggered by the worldwide economic recession, these 
countries are moving toward regionalist and protectionist 
economy. Thus economic frictions increasingly are becoming 
acute. In spite of this, Japan was strongly urged to maintain 
and strengthen its free-trade system, to assist in the recovery 
of world economy, and to play a leading role in dealing with 
problems on a global scale, including those of global 
environment, in a responsible manner. 
  The Japanese economy, however, is far from robust, as 
indicated by weak consumer spending and drastic cutbacks 
business is making in capital investment. Combined with these is 
some worrisome turn of events, such as the drastic rise in the 
value of the yen, which further exacerbates our recessionary 
economy. Judging from the maturity of the Japanese market, 
combined with the clouded future outlook and the sense of being 
blocked in, it now appears that it will be a long time before 
the Japanese economy can come out of the recession. These 
conditions may eventually affect the industry's R&amp;D divisions 
hitherto considered sacred. Moreover, with the rising value of 
the yen, Japanese companies are increasingly moving their 
manufacturing bases abroad, creating concern for eventual 
deindustriarization of Japan. The question we face now is one of 
how Japan can maintain its technological base which thus far has 
supported its economic development. 
  The Ministry of International Trade and Industry is keenly 
aware of the importance of Japan's role as a leading member of 
the international community in achieving full economic recovery 
and in meeting the challenge of the 21st century, full of 
vitality and richness, while overcoming restraining factors of 
aging society and the problem of energy versus environment. 
Our future actions will be focused on the theme of "a 
contribution to outside world and a reform within Japan." In 
other words, we will be reviewing the past economic structure 
and be prepared to endure the pains accompanying such a reform 
in part. It is important that we take down "creatively" the 
existing systems suffering from structural fatigue so that, 
through change and investment, we can achieve further economic 
development. 
  It is especially essential for Japan to open up a new 
industrial field and maintain its vitality. In order to achieve 
this, we must promote original basic R&amp;D, searching for 
technical seeds which will be the "seed" of a new industry. 
Original basic R&amp;D will enable Japan to contribute not only 
to 
its own economic and technological development but also to 
international development, as well, by dispatching to the rest 
of the world the knowledge gained. 
  Moreover, in dealing from the overall standpoint with global 
environmental problems and the limits imposed by resource and 
energy, we feel that our solution to these problems must be 
based on the findings of R&amp;D. It will be necessary to 
transfer 
energy and environment technologies that will be developed by 
Japan to other countries. 
  To be in line with MITI's basic policies, AIST has built up 
its R&amp;D systems by the following means: (1) the creation of 
the 
Industrial Science and Technology R&amp;D System by combining the 
existing Large-Scale Industrial Technology R&amp;D System with 
the 
R&amp;D Project of Basic Technologies for Energy and Industrial 
Technology Development Future Industries; and (2) creation of 
Exploratory Energy and Environment Technology Development 
Project (New Sunshine Project) by combining the New Energy 
Technology R&amp;D (Sunshine Project), the Energy Conservation 
Technology R&amp;D (Moonlight Project), and the Research 
Institute 
of Innovative Technologies for the Earth (RITE). Moreover, we 
have changed the designation of each region's industrial 
technology test laboratory to governmental industrial technology 
research institute and, at the same time, reorganized and 
improved its research setup. Moreover, with the enactment and 
enforcement of laws regulating the R&amp;D of "medical welfare 
equipment and tools" and promotion of their use, we have put 
into effect a new policy designed to aid private sectors engaged 
in the R&amp;D of "medical welfare equipment and tools." 
  For fiscal 1995, AIST will continue pursuing the following 
measures designed to deal with both international and domestic 
problems mentioned previously. 
  First of all, in order to strengthen the structure of the 
R&amp;D 
systems, we will continue to work on the industrial science and 
technology research and development guidelines which both 
generally and specifically present the direction and course of 
R&amp;D which MITI will pursue. Moreover, we will continue 
improving 
AIST's research facilities and equipment so that solid 
advancement will be made in the fields of creative basic R&amp;D 
and 
the research undertaking closely connected to people's 
livelihood. 
  Secondly, we will work on achieving full capabilities of our 
industrial science and technology R&amp;D systems. The creative 
basic R&amp;D; the New Sunshine Project designed to deal with 
energy 
and global environmental problems in appropriate fashion; 
R&amp;D of 
medical welfare equipment and machinery, a type of R&amp;D 
designed 
to achieve comfort and abundance in life, will be conducted 
under the government research institutes and industrial science 
and technology R&amp;D system (more commonly known as the 
"industrial technology system"). Moreover, we will pursue the 
type of research and development using excellent regional art 
and craft technology. We will continue to promote regional 
large-scale projects and other regional technology R&amp;D aiming 
for the establishment of a unique industrial technological 
foundation. Also, under the industrial technology system now 
entering upon its second year, we are planning to start a new 
R&amp;D project on "synergy ceramics." 
  Thirdly, in order to ensure the medium- and long-range 
development bases, we will support the private sector's 
industrial technology developments. We will promote R&amp;D 
through 
financial investments and a system of taxation. In order to step 
up the private sector's experimental research in basic 
technology, we will provide support through the Japan Key 
Technology Center. We will also continue to work on a measure 
designed to support small- and medium-sized businesses' unique 
technology development which will emerge as Japan's next 
generation of industries. 
  Fourthly, we will reorganize and improve Japan's R&amp;D 
foundations. In order to step up the type of R&amp;D efforts 
extending throughout Japan, we must improve industrial 
technology networks through which research manpower and research 
data can be obtained. Moreover, in order to carry out R&amp;D 
effectively, as a preliminary step, we will conduct basic 
research for the purpose of providing guidance. Moreover, we 
will proceed with the reorganization of the research system 
dealing with the foundation of standards, aimed at achieving the 
kind of society which will provide people with a comfortable and 
enriched lifestyle as well as a harmonious environment. The 
reorganization of the system used in the preservation and 
creative utilization of the industrial technological history so 
that the historical materials can be put to use in training of 
superior research personnel. 
  Finally, international research cooperation through the 
advancement of international joint research projects involving 
the United States and other advanced countries, developing 
nations, the former Soviet Union, and eastern European 
countries; the Human Frontier Science Program; and the Subsidies 
for International R&amp;D Cooperation (funded by a NEDO grant). 
Moreover, we will continue working on a measure which will 
enable us to actively cooperate with the OECD Commission on 
Science and Technology Policy (CSTP) to achieve an 
internationally harmonious technological policy. 
  At the risk of sounding repetitive, let me say that the 
establishment of new industrial science technology will be 
crucial to the construction of a foundation for the medium- and 
long-range developments, without which it would be difficult to 
make both Japan and the rest of the world a place of vitality 
and abundance. Consequently, under the cooperation of 
industrial, academic, and governmental sectors, it will be 
extremely important for us to make every effort to advance the 
basic R&amp;D involving Japan and never to backpedal it. 
  Through the enforcement of these policies, I wish to fulfill 
my heavy responsibility as the director general of AIST. Your 
understanding and cooperation in this connection will be greatly 
appreciated. I wish you all a happy and prosperous New Year.

<F P=106> [Article by Sadakazu Shindo, Chairman, Japan Industrial </F>
Technology Association] 
  [Text] Happy New Year! 
  Taking this opportunity, I wish to say a few words. 
  The year 1993 saw the collapse of bubble economy, a huge 
wave 
of the rising yen which almost swept us away, a continuing 
recession, and it ended without showing any sign of recovery 
from the recession. What we are seeking in the year 1994 is what 
will free us from this recessionary economy. The conditions in 
the United States, on the other hand, are very different from 
those of Japan and the European countries. It has come out of 
the recession and is currently showing steady economic growth. 
One of the factors which has contributed to the U.S.'s economic 
recovery is that the country is attaching great importance to 
the technology learned from Japan. This is especially evident in 
recent improvement evident in the quality of the U.S.-made 
automobiles, and it is the automobile industry which made it 
possible for the U.S. economy to achieve growth. This tells us 
that emphasis on technology will be essential especially during 
recessionary times. 
  Needless to say, development of industrial technology 
changes 
not only industries and economic activities, but also our mode 
of living. These changes, conversely, will become a motive power 
necessary for the development of industrial technology. Demand 
for industrial technology will grow not only as a part of the 
means of dealing with the recession, but also as a means of 
dealing with the problems of environment on a global scale, of 
energy, and of resources. 
  After viewing the future prospects, the Ministry of 
International Trade and Industry has revealed its own visions in 
various areas. In order to meet the challenge of the future, the 
Agency of Industrial Science and Technology has also reorganized 
its research institutes and put into effect its various plans, 
such as starting the industrial science technology development 
system and the New Sunshine Project. In order to give this idea 
a form, our association is devoting its effort to fulfill our 
role as "a technological bridge linking government and industry" 
since its establishment. 
  As the noteworthy topics of 1993, we would like to mention 
that a party of the English House of Common (a Science 
Technology Commission mission) and a survey committee from 
Malaysia and Mexico came to us seeking the answer to the 
question of "How the technology owned by the country is 
transferred to the private sector." These people were 
interested in the problems associated with state-owned 
technology transfer, especially that of patents; technical 
exchange among the industrial, academic, and governmental 
sectors; and transfer of state-owned technology to small- and 
medium-sized businesses. The visits of theses overseas parties 
made us aware of the importance of the tasks assigned to the 
association. 
  As expectations to industrial technologies grow bigger, we 
feel that we must make every effort to achieve our mission as a 
bridge linking government and industry while reviewing the 
association's work and its systems. 
  I shall be grateful if all of you, members and associates, 
will give us your guidance and support, and with this I wish to 
conclude my speech and wish you all a very happy New Year.

  [Text] The National Institute of Materials and Chemical 
Research (NIMC) of the Agency of Industrial Science and 
Technology (AIST) has developed a new separation/recovery 
technology for high purity carbon nanotubes that now are 
attracting attention as future large scale advanced materials. 
Carbon nanotubes are expected to have a variety of properties. 
They can be synthesized only with high levels of impurities, 
therefore, it has been difficult to make precise property 
evaluations. They are still in the basic research stage, but 
nanotubes of "above 99 percent purity" are expected, according 
to the NIMC. The latest development is likely to attract 
considerable attention because it may represent substantial 
progress in research on the properties of carbon nanotubes. 
  Development was carried out by Chief Researchers Morio 
Yumura 
and Kunio Uchida of the Reaction Engineering Lab at the 
Department of Chemical Systems of the NIMC. 
  Carbon nanotubes are contained in the substances deposited 
on 
the cathode when the starter material graphite is heated at a 
high temperature by arc discharge. However, this substance 
contains a large amount of graphite-like material and amorphous 
carbon impurities in addition to carbon nanotubes. 
  The currently known separation/refinery technology for 
carbon 
nanotubes involves dipping a coarsely ground substance in 
ethanol. Carbon nanotubes are recovered from the supernatant 
ethanol after supersonic waves are applied. However, this 
conventional separation/refinery method leaves impurities, and 
the presence of those impurities has hindered precise property 
evaluations. 
  The new technology calls for further fine pulverization of 
the carbon nanotubes and impurities in supernatant ethanol to 
loosen them all up. 
  Next, the pulverized substances are taken out of the ethanol 
and put into water containing dispersant and then placed in a 
centrifugal separator. The supernatant liquid produced at this 
time is put through a filter. 
  At this stage, most of the amorphous carbon is eliminated, 
but a small amount of graphite-like substances remain. And so, 
finally, they are sintered at a high temperature, about 
750ëC, to eliminate the graphite-like substances. 
  Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) observation of the 
remaining substances revealed the separation of carbon nanotubes 
that contained almost no impurities.

<F P=106> [Editorial: Japan's Fine-Ceramics Industry To Create New </F>
Vision"] 
  [Text] Japan Fine Ceramics Association (JFCA) is about to 
undertake its second-largest project following the long-term 
fine-ceramics market forecast it thrashed out in 1988. Its 
mission: The creation of a new industry "vision." Behind this 
decision is the simmering of fine-ceramics development fever in 
recent years, prompted in part by the recession. We think a 
fresh, long-range vision is needed, and applaud the industry's 
rise to the challenge. 
  The trouble with the industry's original vision goes back to 
1989, when, based on a JFCA forecast, Symposium on Basic 
Problems of Fine Ceramics Industry (advisory body to MITI) 
predicted the fine-ceramics market would expand to &yen;6 
trillion by 2000. Many companies then developed fine ceramics 
blindly, and forged their strategies around this rosy forecast 
in the absence of other indicators. Now, four years later, 
virtually all of these firms have lost sight of the original 
vision's aims. 
  What has changed in only four years? For one thing, the 
vision itself was formed during a period of high economic growth 
which has since subsided considerably. But probably the biggest 
factor was mistaken judgment. Fine-ceramics makers, in pursuing 
the materials' excellent properties, were too hasty in assessing 
the practical-application possibilities within user industries. 
  Any new vision must first start with an explanation from 
JFCA 
regarding why the initial approaches failed. This will require 
an elaborate inquiry in which not only materials suppliers, but 
also -- from a practical-application standpoint as well -- 
product makers and component manufacturers should take part. 
  In conducting the inquiry, a one-by-one examination of 
fine-ceramic materials and components in practical use today is 
essential for reassessing the industry's true status. The 
results can then provide companies with uniform-level targets as 
they restructure their development operations. 
  It is now more than 10 years since the new-materials rage 
caught on, and those companies with nothing to show for their 
efforts need a healthy dose of determination to survive the 
lingering recession. Some in the fields of advanced materials 
centered on plastics are drastically restructuring, while others 
are withdrawing or forming alliances with others. 
  A similar trend is taking shape among fine-ceramics makers. 
Under the circumstances, the new JFCA vision can present 
valuable guidance for companies revamping their strategies. We 
look to the vision to provide new ideas to direct them.

  [Text] Japan's fine-ceramics industry is in a major 
transition period. Although it had experienced steady growth for 
over 10 years, the industry is now in a condition of 
unprecedentedly serious proportions, hard hit by the fall in 
demand caused by the prolonged economic slump, cost 
differentials with established materials as well as cutbacks in 
its R&amp;D expenses and personnel as a result of the industry's 
poor performance. 
  Withdrawal from the industry by raw-material and other 
makers, and suspension of R&amp;D have become a grisly reality. 
Fine 
ceramics now stand at the crossroads. Will they end up as merely 
the lead-off batter in the fierce new-materials game or will 
they overcome their many difficulties and become the real star 
of the new-materials troupe? 
<H5>  Dow Plans Full-Scale Production of Al Nitride Via Cost </H5>
Reduction 
  The announcement by America's Dow Chemical Co. of an 
industrialization plan for aluminum nitride has been one of the 
hottest news topics for the fine-ceramics industry this year. It 
had been anticipated that Dow Chemical, who had been eagerly 
engaged in the study of nitride fine ceramics, would launch 
industrialization of the business sooner or later, but industry 
circles were surprised when the announcement came during this 
worst-ever slump. Moreover, the said plan overwhelmed those in 
the fine-ceramics industry, and other observers as well, with 
its ambitious scale and the strategy taken by the company: it 
plans to industrialize and sell, mainly in the Japanese market, 
aluminum-nitride powder in an amount of approximately 1,200 t/y, 
while current world demand for the material stands at only 
several hundred t/y. 
  In the history of the Japanese fine-ceramics industry, there 
have been business judgments similar to that of Dow Chemical, 
although on a smaller scale. Japan's Ube Industries took such a 
course when it began industrialization of silicon-nitride 
powders, as did Tosoh Corp. with zirconia powder. 
  Although both companies constructed their large-scale plans 
to meet existing domestic consumption plus prospective 
world-market demand, the facilities are now compelled to operate 
at a low level due to sluggish demand. 
  Dow's industrialization project may not proceed as smoothly 
as planned, although the company has presented a definite target 
for cost-cutting by means of mass production, unlike its 
Japanese counterparts. "Aluminum nitride has great potential 
demand. Though there are users who cannot afford to use it now 
as much as they'd like because of its high price, we will be 
able to supply them with the product at half the current market 
price." (Dow) This is just what these potential users have been 
waiting to hear. 
<H5>  Sales Likely To Mark Negative Growth for Second Consecutive </H5>
Year 
  Volumewise fine-ceramics sales for 1992 plunged 8.4 percent 
from the level of the previous year, according to statistics of 
the fine-ceramics industry released by the Ministry of 
International Trade and Industry. The negative growth was the 
second since 1986, when the ministry started recording 
statistics, but the rate of decrease was the largest. As the low 
operating rate is continuing this year, the figure for this year 
will most likely register for the first time negative growth for 
a second consecutive year. Recovery will not be seen until 1994. 
  What has brought about this situation? The main cause is the 
prolonged recession. Since it is a material still under 
development, fine ceramics may not recover like established 
industrial materials when the economy recovers; fine ceramics 
together with other new materials may have to start from scratch 
because their reliability has not yet been established. If the 
relationship with present users is discontinued, development on 
the users' side may also be discontinued. 
  In the electronics industry, a major user of fine ceramics, 
and the automobile industry, a prospective user, the switch to 
materials cheaper than fine ceramics is under way for some 
parts, although these industries are requesting cost reductions. 
  Material makers as well as parts makers are faced with a 
crucial decision: whether to invest more money and manpower to 
further develop new products and realize cost reduction or to 
discontinue industrialization of the business. 
  Another problem is that fine ceramics is used by many 
enterprises in their new business sectors, where part of the 
profits obtained from their main businesses has been invested. 
Many enterprises are suffering from the poor performances of 
their main businesses, and one material maker has withdrawn from 
the business. Effects on other makers are now under close 
observation.

<H5>  "Synergy Ceramics" Project Will Start Afresh </H5>
  Meanwhile, various countermeasures relating to the 
reinforcement of industrial infrastructure have been taken this 
year. In the field of R&amp;D, a project called "High-Order 
Structural Control Fused Inorganic Materials (synergy 
ceramics)," which had been promoted as a leading research 
activity, will start afresh from the next fiscal year based on 
the research and development system of industrial science and 
technology. 
  The aim of the project is to improve, to a great degree, the 
properties of fine ceramics by concurrent control at each level 
of atomic, molecular and macro structure and to create new fine 
ceramics capable of performing, synergistically and 
concurrently, plural functions which are not normally feasible. 
  Development is expected for such industrial uses as follows: 
heat exchanger for gas-turbine generators and solid electrolyte 
fuel cells in the field of energy; functional material for 
purification system for diesel engine exhaust gas and 
NO[.sub]x[/] purification catalyser in the environmental 
protection field; materials for supersonic aircraft and the 
space shuttle in the space and aviation field; and the general 
industrial material field. 
  Another project "High-Temperature CO[.sub]2[/] Separation 
and Recovery/Recycling Technologies" will begin next year. It 
aims at developing a system which uses ceramics separation 
membrane to separate CO[.sub]2[/] at high temperatures above 
300ëC from high-temperature exhaust gas generated from power 
plants and cement factories, as well as the application of 
segregated carbon dioxide. Zeolite-applied porous membrane, 
porous glass-based segregation membrane, and fused 
carbonate-carried membrane are being considered. This is the 
first project for environmental protection to take advantage of 
the properties of fine ceramics, such as that of its 
heat-resistance. 
<H5>  Standardization Meet Due Next Spring in Tokyo </H5>
  International standardization of fine ceramics, a 
long-standing problem for the Japanese fine-ceramics industry, 
began recently. The ISO (International Standardization 
Organization) set up a special committee for fine ceramics 
(TC206) in December of last year. Since Japan has been entrusted 
with the management of the committee, a parent body for 
management promotion, "Promotion Council for International 
Standardization of Fine Ceramics," was established in July this 
year. 
  The council will tackle "standardization anticipation": How 
to standardize experiment and assessment methods in anticipation 
of the direction of technological developments in high-tech 
fields and make the standardization concepts common language 
among technical circles. 
  Already the council is actively engaged in coordination of 
standards with the U.S. and the EC as well as discussions with 
nations whose representatives will be on the committee. The 
first general meeting of ISO/TC206 will be held in Tokyo next 
spring. Along with the international activity, a domestic 
committee, made up of specialists in industrial, official, and 
academic circles, was formed within the Fine Ceramics Society of 
Japan. The committee has started research for the purpose of 
constructing a database for fine ceramics. To secure users' 
trust, it is necessary to provide them with information on the 
properties of the material in a readily available way, the 
database should be reinforced with guaranteed values of physical 
properties, in order to expand demand for fine ceramics. 
  The plan calls for research on the existing database and the 
industrial needs for the database, its structure, selection of 
data, development of network and selection of access system for 
the current fiscal year. Establishment of a database, based on 
the results of the research, is planned for the next fiscal year 
and thereafter. 
  In the past, a great market in the future for fine ceramics 
was foreseen, providing the basis of corporate judgments for 
industrialization. However, now that the world and the 
environment surrounding fine ceramics have markedly changed, 
corporate awareness may also have to be modified. Apart from 
judging the continuation of the business from the viewpoint of 
an individual company, this may be the chance for making the 
best use of its past development results in cooperation or 
tie-up with other companies. After all, fine ceramics is the key 
material to support the advanced information-oriented society of 
the 21st century. 
<H5>  [Box, p 6] </H5>
<H5>  "Competition and Cooperation Hold Key to Industry's Future" </H5>
  A mood of pessimism is engulfing the fine-ceramics industry 
caused by slackening demand for the materials under Japan's 
economic recession. But this does not necessarily portend a dark 
future for the industry. For fine-ceramics makers, the important 
thing is "attitude" reform. Specifically, they should either 
present users with easier-to-use products or consider how to 
better provide consistent, general-purpose information. This is 
necessary from the standpoint of encouraging crossovers from 
rival materials to fine ceramics and in cultivating new demand 
sources. The ability to do this may hold the key to the 
industry's future. 
  A period of more than 10 years has elapsed since fine 
ceramics caught the world's attention as promising new 
materials. Looking back over this period, it is clear that the 
industry's approach -- namely emphasizing R&amp;D for 
technologies 
to support next-generation industries -- has played a 
significant role in this regard. 
  Remarkable achievements were made in improving the 
properties 
of fine ceramics and in appraising related technologies as well. 
In particular, the improved characteristics rekindled 
anticipation of unlimited possibilities for fine ceramics. 
  Viewed from a market perspective, the physical improvements 
coupled with Japan's period of high economic growth kept 
fine-ceramics demand expanding smoothly during this time. 
  But the economy's lapse into recession put a damper on 
fine-ceramics demand growth. Although applications themselves 
have been expanding, most of this growth has been observed 
within specific areas of use. In other words, manufacturers as 
yet have been unable to establish a base for fine ceramics as 
general-purpose materials and components. In this sense, the 
industry is approaching a turning point. 
  Spurring crossovers from existing materials to fine ceramics 
will require both competition and cooperation. Up to now 
fine-ceramics makers for the most part have provided users with 
technological information and services, and standardized their 
products, on an individual basis. They must pay closer attention 
to users' needs in the future. 
  With these considerations in mind, the Ministry of 
International Trade and Industry has taken up 
medium-to-long-term challenges facing the industry and proposed 
several R&amp;D themes, including High-Order Structural Control 
Fused Inorganic Materials (synergy ceramics) and High 
Temperature CO[.sub]2[/] Separation and Recovery/Recycling 
Technologies. The ministry is also pursuing international 
standardization and database building for fine ceramics. 
Although such efforts are being undertaken in a tripartite 
government, industry and academia arrangement, the enthusiasm 
shown by industry is especially encouraging. 
  Japan must build up its technological development capacity 
to 
remain competitive in the 21st century. Since technological 
innovation energizes industry, and materials play a key role in 
this process, fine ceramics would seem to offer much promise. We 
hope industry will recognize this and pursue fine-ceramics 
development with confidence.

<H5>  Abstract </H5>
  Recent trends in low temperature growth of diamond films 
(LTGD) were reviewed. 
  LTGD can be classified into non substrate-heating processes 
and substrate heating processes. In non substrate-heating 
processes, room temperature growth of diamond has been 
demonstrated by sputtering, rf plasma, and laser excitation 
methods. However, film quality has still not been quantitatively 
analyzed. In substrate-heating processes, polycrystalline 
diamond growth has been confirmed at substrate temperature 
between 80 and 135ëC by microwave plasma of both 
CO-H[.sub]2[/] and CO-O[.sub]2[/]-H[.sub]2[/] systems, 
electron cyclotron resonance plasma of 
C[.sub]2[/]H[.sub]5[/]OH-[H[.sub]2[/], Ar, He] systems, 
and tantalum filament decomposition of the 
CH[.sub]4[/]-H[.sub]2[/] system. Source gases providing 
oxygen and excess atomic hydrogen in the gas phase were found to 
be suitable for LTGD because these species suppress the 
inclusion of amorphous components and the degradation of 
crystallinity which are likely to occur at low substrate 
temperature. The lowest substrate temperature for synthesis of 
diamond films with the same crystallinity as natural diamond is 
about 400ëC. Film quality deteriorated below 400ëC, 
which may be due to the incorporations of H, O, and OH from the 
gas phase into the diamond films. 
  Growth rates are between 0.01 and 0.1 æm/h near 
400ëC, 
and 0.035 and 0.3 æm/h at 130ëC. Growth rates can be 
accelerated by Ar or He additions to source gas, whereas inert 
gases have a possibility of deteriorating film quality. 
<H5>  Introduction </H5>
  Low temperature growth of diamond films (LTGD) is a critical 
point if diamond applications are to be extended to 
semiconductors, optical emitting materials, optical and 
mechanical coating materials, and heat sinks. Diamond chemical 
vapor deposition (CVD) has been conventionally realized at 
substrate temperatures (Ts) between 800 and 1,000ëC. Diamond 
growth at Ts lower than 800ëC has recently been realized by 
a variety of processes and gas systems.[.sup]1-46[/]

decomposition,[.sup]9,46[/] and graphite 
sputtering[.sup]10[/] methods have been applied to synthesis 
of polycrystalline diamond films. In this paper, development 
trends in LTGD are discussed from the viewpoints of both 
processes and source gas systems with specific reference to the 
roles of atomic hydrogen and oxygen for high quality diamond 
synthesis. Conditions for a suitable environment for LTGD are 
clarified. Additionally, limitations to high quality diamond 
film synthesis are investigated by comparing both the full width 
at half maximum (FWHM) of diamond Raman lines and growth rates 
of previously reported samples. 
<H5>  Difficulties in LTGD </H5>
  Figure 1 [not reproduced] shows macro Raman spectra and SEM 
images of samples (1)-(3) prepared on a silicon substrate using 
the microwave plasma of the conventional CO[7%]-H[.sub]2[/] 
system at Ts between 130 and 750ëC. FWHM of these samples 
were obtained from high resolution macro Raman analyses. Details 
of the experimental procedure are shown in reference 40. 
  Surface morphology with a columnar polycrystalline structure 
was seen for sample (1). Crystallite size dropped on lowering 
Ts; it dropped from 0.54-1.5 æm [sample (1)] to 0.15-0.46 
æm 
[sample (2)]. By contrast, sample (3) had a totally different 
crystalline phase, consisting of amorphous-like particles with 
diameters of 0.1-0.26 æm. These white-looking particles did 
not adhere to the silicon substrate; they were easily scratched 
off, even by a thin paper. 
  A sharp diamond Raman line was seen for sample (1) (grown at 
750ëC) with a broad peak near 1450 cm[.sup]-1[/] 
originating from amorphous hydrogenated carbon in a 
polyacetylene structure.[.sup]47[/] The diamond Raman line 
decreased in intensity on lowering Ts, and it was hidden in the 
polyacetylene peak at 130ëC [sample (3)]. This indicated 
that diamond growth was suppressed at low Ts, while amorphous 
component deposition was enhanced, which is in agreement with 
findings from SEM observations. 
  FWHM broadened on reducing Ts (6.4 cm[.sup]-1[/] at 
750ëC, 8.3 cm[.sup]-1[/] at 403ëC, 19.5 
cm[.sup]-1[/] at 130ëC) suggesting that low temperature 
growth caused a deterioration of crystallinity, specifically at 
130ëC. 
  Difficulties with low temperature growth have been clarified 
as enhancement of amorphous component production and degradation 
of crystallinity. These points must be overcome to realize 
synthesis of high quality diamond films at low Ts. In spite of 
these difficulties, high quality films have been recently 
obtained at Ts below 800ëC. 
<H5>  Trends of LTGD </H5>
  Figures 2 and 3 [figures not reproduced] show thermocouple 
measurements of Ts against reported years in terms of processes 
and gas systems employed for LTGD, respectively. Ts is defined 
as the temperature required for the synthesis of 
polycrystallites or polycrystalline films in a cubic diamond 
structure, and the plotted Ts is the lowest temperature 
attempted in each reference. According to Figures 2 and 3, LTGD 
methods can be classified into [A] non substrate-heating 
processes and [B] substrate-heating processes (RTG: Room 
Temperature Growth). 
  The first RTG was demonstrated by graphite sputtering using 
either an ion beam of Ar or hydrogen in 1985.[.sup]10[/] 
Subsequently, RTG was confirmed using ArF excimer laser 
decomposition of C[.sub]2[/]H[.sub]2[/] diluted with 
H[.sub]2[/],[.sup]9[/] and rf plasma of a 
CH[.sub]4[/]-Ar system.[.sup]13[/] Rebello and Subramaniam 
have reported RTG at high growth rates [5-10 æm/h] using ArF 
excimer laser reactions in a CO-H[.sub]2[/] 
system;[.sup]46[/] they confirmed the growth of well-defined 
diamond crystallites by SEM and Raman spectra. 
  LTGD by the substrate-heating processes has been attempted 
since 1982 when high quality films were prepared by the filament 
assisted decomposition of a CH[.sub]4[/]-H[.sub]2[/] 
system at 610ëC.[.sup]5[/] LTGD at 430ëC was reported 
by the microwave plasma (MP) of the same 
CH[.sub]4[/]-H[.sub]2[/] system[.sup]24[/] in 1989. 
Recently, high quality films were synthesized at 130ëC using 
MP of a CO-O[.sub]2[/]-H[.sub]2[/] system[.sup]40[/] 
and at 140ëC by dc plasma of the 
CH[.sub]4[/](1%)-H[.sub]2[/] system.[.sup]6[/] The 
tungsten filament decomposition of the 
CH[.sub]4[/](1%)-H[.sub]2[/] system[.sup]17[/] has 
also been verified as a primary method for LTGD (Ts = 
130ëC). And 80-100ëC growth of diamond has been 
presented by ECR plasma, suggesting the possibility of 
RTG.[.sup]45[/] 
  According to Figure 3, the above LTGD, for [B] 
substrate-heating processes, was achieved using a number of 
oxygen-containing gas systems and the 
CH[.sub]4[/](&lt;5%)-H[.sub]2[/] system. These particular 
gas systems have a little oxygen or a large amount of atomic 
hydrogen present in their gas phases; both of which contribute 
to suppression of the decay of film quality occurring at low Ts 
mentioned before. 
<H5>  The Roles of Atomic Hydrogen and Oxygen in LTGD </H5>
  Reported Ts is plotted against CH[.sub]4[/] concentration 
([CH[.sub]4[/]]) in Figure 4 [not reproduced] using data from 
a number of 
references.[.sup]2,4,5-8,10-11,14-17,20,23,34,37,38[/] Only 
600ëC growth was reported when [CH[.sub]4[/]] was 10 
percent. At low [CH[.sub]4[/]], diamond synthesis is possible 
in a much more extensive Ts region; 300-980ëC 
([CH[.sub]4[/]] = 5 percent), and 135-1040ëC 
([CH[.sub]4[/]] = 1 percent). This implies that an atmosphere 
with low CH[.sub]4[/] concentration is suitable for LTGD. 
  The necessity of low [CH[.sub]4[/]] for LTGD has also been 
pointed out by Ihara et al.[.sup]17[/] They carried out 
135ëC growth with tantalum filament CVD using 
CH[.sub]4[/][0.4-5%]-H[.sub]2[/] systems. The diamond 
grew at Ts between 300 and 700ëC when [CH[.sub]4[/]] was 
3 percent, and well-defined polycrystallites could be 
synthesized at Ts between 135 and 700ëC at [CH[.sub]4[/]] 
ranging from 0.4 to 1 percent. One reason for this success of 
LTGD was suggested to be due to high filament temperature 
(2300ëC) providing excess atomic hydrogen in the gas phase. 
  Through two-photon excited LIF studies, atomic hydrogen 
concentration [H] was found to decrease by a factor of 0.5 when 
[CH[.sub]4[/]] increased from 0 to 5 percent in a 
filament-assisted CVD system.[.sup]48[/] This was also 
confirmed by others.[.sup]49[/] 
  On the other hand, to know the effect of [CH[.sub]4[/]] on 
[H] in the plasma-assisted CVD system, we adopted plasma 
emission actinometry[.sup]50-51[/] using Ar as an 
actinometer. Figure 5 [not reproduced] shows IH/IAr against 
[CH[.sub]4[/]] in a low output microwave plasma CVD 
system,[.sup]39-41[/] where IH and IAr are optical emission 
intensities of H_a_ (6563 Angstroms) and Ar (7504 Angstroms), 
respectively. IH/IAr was suggested to be in proportion to 
[H].[.sup]51[/] Figure 5 clearly shows a steep increase of 
IH/IAr with lowering [CH[.sub]4[/]], implying that low 
[CH[.sub]4[/]] provides an excess atomic hydrogen environment. 
  The above convincing results showing the increase of [H] 
with 
[CH[.sub]4[/]] reduction in both filament-assisted and 
plasma-assisted CVD systems have led to the conclusion that 
recent success with LTGD at low [CH[.sub]4[/]] in Figure 4 
may relate to a large amount of atomic hydrogen in the gas phase. 
  According to Figure 3, oxygen-containing gas systems have 
been frequently employed for LTGD. Focusing on the roles of 
oxygen, Ts was plotted as a function of O/C in Figure 6 [not 
reproduced] using data in previous 
references[.sup]1-4,7,11,16,18-22,24-27,38-45[/] where 
various plasmas of oxygen-containing gas systems were adopted. 
It can be said that lower temperature growth is possible in such 
gas systems with higher values of O/C. Specifically, LTGD at Ts 
lower than 400ëC was confirmed in CO-H[.sub]2[/], 
CO-O[.sub]2[/]-H[.sub]2[/], 
CH[.sub]4[/]-O[.sub]2[/]-H[.sub]2[/], 
CH[.sub]3[/]OH-H[.sub]2[/], and 
C[.sub]2[/]H[.sub]5[/]OH-H[.sub]2[/] systems. Among 
these, LTGD at Ts between 100 and 130ëC (presently the 
lowest level) was demonstrated in 
CO-H[.sub]2[/],[.sup]40[/] 
CO-O[.sub]2[/]-H[.sub]2[/],[.sup]40[/] and 
CH[.sub]3[/]OH-H[.sub]2[/][.sup]45[/] systems. 
  Figure 7 [not reproduced] indicates IH/IAr as a function of 
O/C atomic ratio in a low output microwave plasma CVD 
system[.sup]39-41[/] for a number of conventionally employed 
gas combinations. An increase of IH/IAr occurred on multiplying 
the O/C atomic ratio, which was also observed by 
others.[.sup]52[/] This may be because oxygen inhibits 
surface recombinations of atomic hydrogen occurring on the cold 
quartz wall.[.sup]51[/] These facts in Figures 6-7 indicate 
that oxygen-containing gas systems providing an excess atomic 
hydrogen atmosphere are also suitable for LTGD. 
  As mentioned in the previous section, LTG caused an 
enhancement of amorphous component deposition, resulting in both 
the suppression of diamond growth and degradation of 
crystallinity. The key roles of atomic hydrogen in diamond 
growth have been frequently discussed, including etching of 
amorphous carbon and graphitic carbon,[.sup]15[/] suppression 
of amorphous hydrogenated carbon formation in a polyacetylene 
structure,[.sup]47[/] etc. All these functions may contribute 
to prevention of non-crystalline phase deposition which is 
likely to occur at low Ts, resulting in selective growth of 
diamond. 
  Other than the currently observed increase of C[H], the 
roles 
of oxygen have also been suggested as follows: etching of 
amorphous components,[.sup]40[/] inhibition of carbon ã 
bonding at the surface,[.sup]53[/] improvement of 
crystallinity,[.sup]40,43[/] suppression of impurity 
incorporation.[.sup]54-55[/] These functions are considered 
to be effective for the prevention of both amorphous component 
production in diamond films and the deterioration of 
crystallinity, resulting in synthesis of high quality films even 
at low Ts. 
  From the above discussion on the roles of atomic hydrogen 
and 
oxygen, we can draw the conclusion that an atmosphere containing 
excess atomic hydrogen and a small amount of oxygen is suitable 
for LTGD. 
<H5>  Limitation of Substrate Temperature for High Quality Diamond </H5>
Films 
  FWHM values of diamond Raman lines for previously reported 
samples[.sup]5,18,20,27-38,40-42[/] are plotted against Ts in 
Figure 8 [not reproduced]. Since only a few data are presented 
at low Ts (&lt;500ëC),[.sup]40[/], it is difficult to 
determine a limit of Ts. For the time being, it can be said that 
the limit of Ts for synthesis of diamond films with almost the 
same crystallinity as natural diamond (FWHM = 3.0 
cm[.sup]-1[/]) is near 400ëC.[.sup]40[/] We employed a 
low output microwave (80W) plasma of the 
CO[8%]-O[.sub]2[/](2.2%)-H[.sub]2[/] system. FWHM of 
synthesized films at 411ëC was 4.0 
cm[.sup]-1[/].[.sup]40[/] FWHM of the films synthesized 
below 400ëC broadened to 10-20 
cm[.sup]-1[/],[.sup]40[/] indicating that 400ëC is a 
critical temperature to determine the quality of diamond films. 
The reason for the degradation of crystallinity at 
130ëC[.sup]40[/] (Figure 8) may relate to the gas systems 
employed (we employed both 
CO[8%]-O[.sub]2[/](2.2%)-H[.sub]2[/] and 
CO(7%)-H[.sub]2[/] systems in reference 40). It has been 
recently clarified by XPS studies that oxygen inclusion in 
diamond films occurred at low Ts.[.sup]45[/] Atomic hydrogen, 
atomic oxygen, and OH radicals produced in the gas phase of 
oxygen-based gas systems (alcohol, acetone, alcohol and water) 
are incorporated in diamond films.[.sup]56[/] Additionally, 
cathodoluminescence (noted as CL) studies have indicated the 
possibility of oxygen incorporation in diamond films synthesized 
in the microwave plasma of the 
CH[.sub]4[/](0.5%)-O[.sub]2[/](0.1%)-H[.sub]2[/] 
system.[.sup]57[/] All these findings suggest that one reason 
for crystallinity deterioration seen at low Ts (&lt;400ëC) in 
Figure 8 may be oxygen incorporation in diamond films. 
<H5>  Growth Rates </H5>
  Growth rates (Vg) are plotted against Ts in Figure 9 [not 
reproduced]. Vg necessarily depends on processes, gas systems, 
carbon source gas concentration, etc. Roughly speaking, Vg 
ranges from 0.01 to 0.2 æm/h near 400ëC, and 0.035 to 0.3 
æm/h near 130ëC. The enhancement of diamond growth at low 
Ts is an attractive topic. We have reported that Vg was 
accelerated by a factor of 2-5 with the addition of 4 percent Ar 
to a CO-H[.sub]2[/] system.[.sup]39[/] The metastable Ar 
atoms were suggested to collide with gas phase species and 
promote their excitation and decomposition, resulting in the 
enhancement of diamond growth.[.sup]39[/] The increase of 
growth rate by argon has also been recently reported by 
comparison of Vg for 
C[.sub]2[/]H[.sub]5[/]OH(25%)-H[.sub]2[/], 
C[.sub]2[/]H[.sub]5[/]OH(25%)-Ar, and 
C[.sub]2[/]H[.sub]5[/]OH(25%)-He systems.[.sup]45[/] 
However, we have found that a large amount of Ar addition causes 
silicon incorporation or vacancy formation in diamond films due 
to collisions of high energy Ar atoms with the quartz wall, 
silicon substrate, and growth surface, consequently 
deteriorating film quality. According to our recent studies, 
cauliflower-like microcrystallites were seen by SEM, and the 
intensity of the GR1 band (CL) increased for the film grown in a 
CO(4%)-Ar(9.7%)-H[.sub]2[/] system.[.sup]58[/] 
  Remarkably, much higher growth rates have been obtained by 
multiphoton excitation of CO (X[.sup]1[/] _s_[.sup]+[/] 
a[.sup]3[/] ã) diluted with H[.sub]2[/] by ArF (193 
nm) laser.[.sup]46[/] Well-defined diamond crystallites with 
diameters of 5-10 æm were synthesized per hour at room 
temperature, which means a significantly high growth rate of 
5-10 æm/h. This is an exceptional and promising result 
deviating from conventional data shown in the hatched region of 
Figure 9. 
<H5>  Conclusion </H5>
  Recent trends in LTGD were reviewed and the following 
results 
were obtained. 
  (1) LTGD could be classified into non substrate-heating 
(room 
temperature growth) and substrate-heating processes. 
  (2) In non substrate-heating processes, room temperature 
growth was confirmed by graphite sputtering with a hydrogen ion 
beam, radio frequency plasma of the CH[.sub]4[/]/Ar system, 
and ArF excimer laser excitation of the CO-H[.sub]2[/] system. 
  (3) In non substrate-heating processes, diamond film quality 
has not been quantitatively estimated yet, as by FWHM analyses 
of diamond Raman lines. However, well-defined crystallites with 
a sharp diamond Raman line were found to be synthesized at room 
temperature by ArF excimer laser CVD using the CO-H[.sub]2[/] 
system. 
  (4) In substrate-heating processes, polycrystalline diamond 
film growth was confirmed at 130ëC by microwave plasma of 
both CO-H[.sub]2[/] and CO-O[.sub]2[/]-H[.sub]2[/] 
systems, 80-100ëC by ECR plasmas of 
C[.sub]2[/]H[.sub]5[/]OH-[H[.sub]2[/], He, Ar] systems, 
and 135ëC by filament decomposition of the 
CH[.sub]4[/]-H[.sub]2[/] system. 
  (5) Gas systems providing oxygen and excess atomic hydrogen 
in the gas phase are suitable for LTGD in substrate-heating 
processes. 
  (6) In substrate-heating processes, the lowest Ts for the 
growth of films with almost the same crystallinity as natural 
diamond is about 400ëC. The crystallinity deteriorates below 
400ëC, which may be due to defect production caused by 
incorporations of gaseous species such as H, O, and OH into 
diamond films. 
  (7) Growth rates are between 0.01 and 0.2 æm/h near 
400ëC, and 0.035 and 0.3 æm/h at 130ëC. Growth rates 
can be accelerated by Ar or He additions to source gas, whereas 
inert gases have the possibility of deteriorating film quality. 
  Finally, there are few data regarding physical, chemical, 
and 
semiconducting properties of low temperature growth films. 
Analyses of these properties are necessary to extend 
applications to practical use.

  [Text] Direct transformation of graphite to diamond and SiC 
heteroepitaxial growth on Si(001) were studied by molecular 
dynamics simulations using the Tersoff potentials of carbon and 
silicon. The carbon lattice of graphite was compressed along 
c-axis and graphite diamond transformations were observed 
after lattice relaxations. Hexagonal diamond and cubic diamond 
were synthesized from graphite without any large atomic 
displacements. Heteroepitaxial growth of single crystal 3c-SiC 
on Si(001) was observed after carbonization of the Si(001) 
surface. Breaking of the Si-Si bonds and shrinkage of the [110] 
Si rows with C atoms are possible mechanisms for the 
heteroepitaxial growth of SiC on Si(001). 
<H5>  1. Introduction </H5>
  We have used molecular dynamics (MD) simulations to 
understand microchemistry and microstructure of the material 
syntheses and thin film growth.[.sup]1-4[/] MD simulations 
enable us to follow atomic trajectories and configurational 
changes in the processes. In this paper, mechanisms of direct 
transformation of graphite to diamond and SiC heteroepitaxial 
growth on Si(001) were studied at atomic scale using MD 
simulations. 
  The simulations were carried out using the Tersoff many-body 
empirical potential for Si and C.[.sup]5[/] The positions and 
velocities of every atom in the computational cell were 
calculated following each time step by integrating the equations 
of motion using the Schofield algorithm.[.sup]6[/] The 
potential energies and forces associated with each atom in the 
computational cell, as well as the total potential energy and 
maximum force value, were calculated for each time step and 
atomic configurations were allowed to relax. The calculations 
were carried out using MD and quasidynamic (QD) 
techniques.[.sup]2[/] The position and velocity of each atom 
were computed in a fully dynamic mode until both the total 
potential energy and the total force of the ensemble 
(independently) reached minima at which point the velocity of 
each atom was set to zero. The system allowed to evolve further. 
The procedure was repeated until stable atom positions with 
approximately zero net force were obtained. After the QD 
relaxations, initial unstable configurations changed to more 
stable configurations which corresponded to a local potential 
energy minimum. 
<H5>  2. Graphite Diamond Transformations </H5>
  Direct transformation of graphite (G) to diamond (D) has 
been 
reported using explosive shock compression[.sup]7,8[/] and 
static high pressure methods.[.sup]9[/] Cubic diamond (cD) 
and/or hexagonal diamond (hD) was synthesized by these methods. 
Several models of mechanisms of these direct transformations of 
G D was proposed.[.sup]8[/] Nevertheless a model of G 
cD included unreasonable 60 degrees rotation or long slip of the 
(0001)[.sub]G[/] planes. Another model of direct 
transformation of G cD was initiated by rhombohedral 
graphite (rG) which contained few percent in natural graphite. 
Figure 1 [not reproduced] shows these conventional models of G 
cD. 
  Direct transformations of G hD and G cD are discussed 
using the MD and QD simulations. The carbon lattice of graphite 
was compressed along [0001][.sub]G[/] axis. Small slip of the 
(0001)[.sub]G[/] plane and small displacement of each atom in 
the (0001)[.sub]G[/] plane were introduced to the initial 
configurations of the QD relaxations. Direct transformation of G 
hD and G cD were observed. Mechanisms of these G D 
transformations were illustrated in Figure 2 [not reproduced]. 
<H5>  2.1. MD Simulations of G hD </H5>
  G hD was observed when the QD relaxation was simulated 
using the initial configurations as follows. The 
(0001)[.sub]G[/] plane spacing of 3.35 Angstroms was 
compressed to the (1 010)[.sub]hD[/] plane spacing of 2.18 
Angstroms. Small displacements of 0.05 Angstrom perpendicular to 
the (0001)[.sub]G[/] planes were introduced to the atoms in 
the directions of the small arrows in Figure 2. Lower 
(0001)[.sub]G[/] plane was slipped 0.5 Angstrom in the [10 1 
0][.sub]G[/] direction as illustrated by large arrow in 
Figure 2. 
  After the relaxation, lower (0001)[.sub]G[/] plane slipped 
along the arrow and atoms 9, 12, 13, 16 displaced in the 
[0001][.sub]G[/] direction. Upper plane atoms 10 and 11 made 
bonds with lower plane atoms 13 and 16, respectively. 
Relationships of the crystal axes between G and hD and the 
stable atomic spacings (Angstroms) in each configuration were 
  [0001][.sub]G[/] [1 010][.sub]hD[/]: 3.35/2.18 (1), 
  [1 2 1 0][.sub]G[/] [1 2 1 0][.sub]hD[/]: 
2.53/2.52 (2), 
  [10 1 0][.sub]G[/] [0001][.sub]hD[/]: 
2.19/2.06 (3). 
  This mechanism of G hD transformation agrees with the 
reported conventional models.[.sup]8[/] 
<H5>  2.2. MD Simulations of G cD </H5>
  On the other hand, G cD was observed when the QD 
relaxation was simulated using the initial configurations as 
follows. The (0001)[.sub]G[/] plane spacing of 3.35 Angstroms 
was compressed to 2.18 Angstroms. Small displacements of 0.1 
Angstrom perpendicular to the (0001)[.sub]G[/] planes were 
introduced to the atoms in the directions of the small arrows in 
Figure 2. No slip of the (0001)[.sub]G[/] plane was 
introduced. 
  After the relaxation, lower (0001)[.sub]G[/] plane slipped 
along the arrow (opposite direction to that of the G hD) and 
atoms 1, 4, 5, 8 displaced in the [0001][.sub]G[/] direction. 
The bonds 2, 3 and 6, 7 were broken. The shaded parts of the 
(0001)[.sub]G[/] plane changed to the plane perpendicular to 
the initial (0001)[.sub]G[/] plane. Lower plane atom 8 made 
bonds with upper plane atoms 2 and 3. Relationships of the 
crystal axes between G and cD and the stable atomic spacings in 
each configuration were 
  [0001][.sub]G[/] [001][.sub]cD[/]: 3.35/1.78 (4), 
  [1 2 1 0][.sub]G[/] [1 10][.sub]cD[/]: 
2.53/2.52 (5), 
  [10 1 0][.sub]G[/] [110][.sub]cD[/]: 2.19/2.52 (6). 
  This mechanism of G cD transformation is different from 
the conventional models. 
<H5>  2.3. Discussions </H5>
  Experimental studies suggested that the axes relationship [1 
2 1 0][.sub]hD[/] [1 10][.sub]cD[/] of the synthesized 
diamond and syntheses of the fiber structure along the [1 2 1 
0][.sub]hD[/] direction by the shock compression. 
  In our models, cD and hD synthesized by the direct 
transformation of G exhibited relationships of (2) and (5). This 
result suggests the relationship of [1 2 1 0][.sub]hD[/] [1 
10][.sub]cD[/] which agrees with the experimental results. 
The difference of the lattice spacing between G and D in the G 
D transformations were small (&lt;1 percent) along the [1 2 1 
0][.sub]G[/] direction and large (&gt; 13 percent for cD, &gt; 5 
percent for hD) along the [10 1 0][.sub]G[/] direction. These 
differences of the lattice spacings may cause the syntheses of 
the fiber structure along [1 2 1 0][.sub]hD[/]. 
  New G cD mechanism without unreasonable rotations or 
displacements is proposed by the MD simulations. 
<H5>  3. SiC Growth on Si(001) </H5>
  Heteroepitaxial growth of cubic silicon carbide (3c-SiC; 
_b_-SiC) on Si wafers has been investigated and the surface 
reaction (carbonization) of a single crystal Si wafer with 
gaseous hydrocarbons at elevated temperature is essential to 
grow epitaxial single crystal 3c-SiC thin films.[.sup]10[/] 
In this paper, the mechanism of the carbonization of the Si(001) 
surface is studied at atomic scale using the MD and QD 
simulations. 
<H5>  3.1. MD Simulations </H5>
  Thirty-six carbon adatoms were deposited on the surface of 
the Si lattice whose dimension was 10 x 10 x 8 and the 
configurational change after the QD relaxation was studied. 
  Figure 3 [not reproduced] shows atomic configurations of the 
relaxed Si(001) surface with the C adatoms after 15,000 steps of 
QD calculations. In the carbonized region, the [110] rows of the 
(001) surface Si atoms shrink in the [110] direction with C 
atoms. The side view of the third [110] Si-C row from the top in 
Figure 3(a) is shown in Figure 3(b). It is clearly observed that 
the Si surface layer atoms are pulled by the C atoms in the 
[110] direction to form bonds of Si-C. Some of the Si surface 
layer atoms (for example, atoms 1 and 2) are unconnected from 
the second layer Si atoms (3, 4 and 5, 6, respectively). The 
breaking of the Si-Si bonds between first and second layers 
enables the shrinkage of the [110] row of Si surface atoms with 
C atoms in the direction of [110]. Si atom 1 is displaced along 
the arrow in Figure 3(a), (b) by C atom _a_ and makes new bonds 
with Si atoms 5 and 6 while atom 1 initially has bonds with Si 
atoms 3 and 4. 
  Two-layer two-dimensional configurations of Si and C (Figure 
3(b)) correspond to the 3c-SiC configurations whose crystal 
directions are 3c-SiC[001]//Si[001] and 3c-SiC[110]//Si[110]. 
This directional relationship between epitaxial 3c-SiC and the 
Si substrate agree with reported experimental 
results.[.sup]10[/] Five atom spacings of carbons in the SiC 
configurations coincide with four atom spacings of the Si 
lattice as illustrated by vertical lines in Figure 3(b). This 
relationship agrees with the bond length ratio of the 
crystalline lattice; Si/SiC = 2.35/1.89 ÷ 5/4. Possible 
heteroepitaxial growth mechanisms of 3c-SiC on the Si(001) 
surface are elucidated by the MD simulation as the breaking of 
the Si-Si bonds between first and second layer atoms in the Si 
lattice and the shrinkage of the [110] row of the Si lattice 
atoms with the C atoms.

  [Text] Spaceplanes seem to have a bright future as a highly 
efficient, safe and reliable space transportation system for the 
21st century. Construction of Japan's first engine wind tunnel 
capable of testing the ramjets required for spaceplanes has been 
completed at the Kakuda Research Center. The opening ceremony 
was held on 7 October 1993. The ceremony was attended by 137 
guests including former Science and Technology Agency Director 
General Soichiro Ito and the Space Activities Commission's 
Acting Chairman Tamiya Nomura. The test facility was shown to 
the visitors at 2:30 p.m. and the ceremony was held at the 
Kakuda City Center at 4 p.m. 
  The construction plan was authorized in FY88 and 
construction 
began in 1989. 
  The facility can simulate on the ground engine inlet 
conditions equivalent to Mach 4, 6, and 8 during flights at 
altitudes of between 20 and 35 km. In order to heat high 
pressure gas to a maximum of 2300ëC at up to 100 atmospheres 
of pressure, heat reservoir and combustion heaters are used 
together. The heat reservoir heater, 2 meters in diameter and 
about 10 meters in height, contains aluminum oxide bricks which 
operate as a heat exchanger. The combustion heater burns a 
hydrogen and oxygen mixture. The ramjet is placed in an air 
current which is accelerated through a supersonic nozzle with a 
51 cm square outlet to measure the engine performance and the 
pressure and the temperature of every part of the engine. In 
order to approximate altitude conditions, the ramjet engine test 
facility is connected to the exhaust system of the existing 
rocket engine high-altitude sky performance testing facility and 
the pressure in the low chamber where the engine and propulsion 
measuring equipment is located is lowered to 1/10 - 1/100 
atmospheres. 
  This testing facility is the first of its kind in Japan. 
Other features of the ramjet and scramjet performance test 
facility, one of the best facilities in the world, include: 
  1) Ability to simulate a wide range of flight conditions 
from 
Mach 4 to 8. 
  2) The world's largest facility able to test up to Mach 6 
using pure gas heated by a heat reservoir heater. 
  3) Comparison of engine performance within heated pure gas 
and combustion simulated gas. 
  4) Simulation of engine regenerative cooling through control 
of the temperature of hydrogen and engine fuel, from -253ëC 
to 500ëC. 
  5) Ability to measure the main thrust, and vertical moment 
generated by the engine. 
  The engine wind tunnel will be used not only for testing 
high-speed flight range in Japan, but also as a significant 
resource for joint use by the rest of the world. 
  At present the National Aerospace Laboratory [NAL] is making 
a water cooling type subscale engine prototype as Japan's first 
scramjet for testing. Comprehensive engine performance tests are 
scheduled in this new test facility. Through the tests, the 
results of the research conducted so far on elements such as air 
inlet, combustor, and nozzle, parts of the engine and cooling 
structures will be reconfirmed. NAL will clarify the mutual 
interference effect when different elements are combined. NAL 
intends to further promote ram-/scram-jet engine research by 
completing a test engine that best combines those elemental 
features. 
  The program has had its ups and downs since initiation in 
1986. The most crucial task was to expand the cross-section of 
the wind tunnel to twice the size of that originally planned 
space specifications for the engine tunnel called for a precise 
combustion simulation and cooling structure. Also the pressure 
required by the facility had to be increased because the 
simulated flight altitude at Mach 8 was decreased from 40 km to 
35 km. The above two tasks strained both budget and technology. 
However, with much support from concerned parties, including 
Kobe Steel and the Science and Technology Agency, the facility 
has finally been completed. The exterior building was 
constructed in cooperation with Tohoku Region Construction 
Bureau and Ishihara Construction Co., Ltd. and the facilities 
were prepared in cooperation with Yuatech and Nissin Setsubi.

<H5>  I. Introduction </H5>
  The SFU (Space Flyer Unit) (Fig. 1) is the first mission 
carried out with the cooperation of three governmental bodies in 
Japan, i.e., the Science and Technology Agency, the Ministry of 
International Trade and Industry (MITI), and the Ministry of 
Education. IHI was awarded a contract from the National Space 
Development Agency of Japan (NASDA) regarding development of an 
EFFU: (Exposed Facility Flyer Unit) loaded on an SFU, and a 
contract from the Institute for Unmanned Space Experiment Free 
Flyer regarding development of both a GHF (Gradient Heating 
Furnace) and a MHF (Mirror Heating Furnace). IHI designed the 
control system for these pieces of equipment. The SFU is the 
first Japanese satellite planned for retrieval and reuse. Its 
launch by an H-2 rocket is for February 1995 with retrieval by a 
U.S. space shuttle after several months of experiments and 
observations, including those in the fields of materials, 
biology, and astronomy, in orbit some 500 km above the earth. 

<FIG ID=JPRS-JST-015L-19A>      Fig. 1 Configuration of SFU </FIG>


  This paper describes the means of satisfying the 
requirements 
of EFFU for both completing the mission and the EFFU's safety, 
two aims that seem to conflict with each other, and also 
increase the efficiency of the power amplifier for providing 
power to the GHF and MHF, high accuracy positioning of sample 
exchange unit, controlled thaw in heatpipes, etc. 
<H5>  2. EFFU and Its Control </H5>
<H5>  2.1 Outline of EFFU </H5>
  In the space station plan promoted by NASA and carried out 
by 
Japan, Europe, and Canada, Japan is to develop and operate the 
JEM (Japanese Experimental Module). IHI is in charge of total 
system coordination of the exposed facility of the JEM. EFFU is 
to carry out experiments on improving the reliability of the 
principal elemental technology of exposed equipment and also to 
support joint training for experiment skills. The following 
experiments in orbit are scheduled: 
<H5>  (1) Elemental Technology of Thermal Control by Fluid Loop </H5>
(TCS: Thermal Control System) 
  In the exposed facility of FEM, more electric power is 
consumed than by a conventional satellite. Accordingly, the heat 
accumulated is difficult to dispose of merely through conduction 
to the metallic body and radiation into space. Thermal control 
using a fluid loop is adopted in which fluid is forcibly 
circulated to absorb the heat generated. In the EFFU, a system 
is assembled to simulate the actual control loop, which consists 
of a fluid pump (400 Hz, canned motor) as the principal 
equipment and other instruments and devices fitted to piping, 
such as differential pressure sensors, temperature sensors, 
solenoid valves, heat absorbing cold plates, and radiator. The 
EFFU will be the first space unit in Japan with thermal control 
performed by a fluid loop. 
<H5>  (2) EEU (Equipment Exchange Unit) </H5>
  Payloads loaded on the exposed facility have to be exchanged 
by a manipulator in orbit. The equipment exchanging mechanism 
for the purpose is provided with actuators for working in vacuum 
and the solid-lubricated bearing of the actuator is one of the 
featured elements. 
<H5>  (3) Collecting Micro-G Characteristics Data </H5>
  One of the characteristics of space is a micro-gravity 
environment. Detection and identification of gravity 
disturbances caused by the acceleration of the flying unit (in 
EFFU, those from the operation of pump, valve, equipment 
exchange unit, etc.) are planned. 
<H5>  (4) Exposing Experiment on Requisite Materials </H5>
  Differing from a synchronous satellite, a space unit in low 
orbit is spared from the effects of cosmic rays or collisions 
with meteorites. But, currently material deterioration caused by 
atomic state oxygen in the earth's atmosphere which exists 
although thinly, is a new problem. A variety of material samples 
will be loaded and investigated after retrieval. 
<H5>  (5) Gas Dynamics Experiment </H5>
  The EFFU is one of the payloads of SFU, but this experiment 
unit can be regarded as a payload of EFFU. This was developed by 
NEC Corporation under a contract with the NASDA. 
<H5>  2.2 Control System of the EFFU </H5>
  Control of the EFFU is carried out by individual control 
unit, centering around the electrical power distribution unit 
(EPDU) which distributes power to each load and the EFFU control 
unit (ECU) which controls the whole EFFU system, besides taking 
charge of communication with the SFU. The features of each 
control are described below: 
  1. ECU (EFFU Control Unit) 
  This is installed at the center of the EFFU control systems 
and controls and monitors all controls in the EFFU (Table 1). It 
is also provided with a data interface for SFU command/telemetry 
(response and transmission of data). The ECU has a converter, 
which converts a fluctuating primary source (DC 32.5 to 51.5 V) 
into power with a stable voltage. Because communication with the 
earth on a circum-earth orbit is possible for only a few minutes 
per day, communication is limited to 875 bit/s because of the 
capacity of the data storage device. As commands from the earth 
are also limited as above, logic is provided to control 
functions that make operation fully automatic. The change of 
configuration (all of the specification) for the space unit is 
required to undergo full verification (through tests, etc.). The 
control software, therefore, are loaded as firmware. 
  2. EPDU (Electric Power Distribution Unit) 
  Not only [is] it provided with a function to deliver power 
received from SFU to each electronic equipment and heater, it is 
also equipped with fuses to protect heater power lines. The 
structures of fuses are designed with built-in redundancy in 
case of a failure. 
  3. Invertor (F-INV) 
  The invertor supplies power to a fluid pump for circulating 
coolant, inverting DC to AC 400 Hz, and is actuated by a signal 
from the ECU. 
  4. EEU Controller (MDU: Motor Drive Unit) 
  The driver of the motor of the EEU is started by a command 
from the ECU for rotation permit and direction of rotation, and 
is stopped automatically by a limit switch. The ECU monitors 
operation/failure of EEU through status signal (analog/digital). 
  5. GDEF (Gas Dynamics Experiment Facility) 
  It is provided with an intelligent electronic device which 
controls the experiment independently. The GDEF is connected to 
ECU by commands to start/stop the experiment and telemetry which 
relays experimental data to the SFU.

<FIG ID=JPRS-JST-015L-21A></FIG>


<H5>         2.2.1 Design Conditions </H5>
  The following conditions have to be met when designing 
control devices for use in space. 
<H5>  (1) Adaptation to Limited Resources </H5>
  As the launching capacity and the resources available in 
space are limited, power demand, weight, volume, the amount of 
communication necessary, and heat released have to be designed 
to meet the designed allotment for each item of equipment. In 
particular, the electric power for EFFU is critical, being an 
average of 430 W and a maximum of 700 W, so that EFFU itself 
sets the operation rule for the GDEF and the EEU, which does not 
allow both units to be operated at the same time. 
<H5>  (2) Adaptation to the Environment in Space </H5>
  (a) Vibration resistance 
  Construction must resist an environment for launching of 
rocket (sine wave 15 G[.sub]o-p[/]). 
  (b) Heat resistance 
  The large difference between the temperature when the 
satellite is in the sun and out of the sun (-30 to +60ë C) 
and the difficulty of heat disposal in vacuum (where there is no 
convection, and the heat generated in controllers has to be 
conducted from the device through circuit board, chassis, and 
structure, and is finally disposed of in space through 
radiation) should be considered. 
  (c) Resistance against radiation 
  There can be a failure of a material or functional 
deterioration caused by the accumulated total radiation dose 
from electrons or protons in space following long-term exposure, 
and failures due to bit-inversion of memory/register caused by 
attacks from high energy particles. The former can be avoided 
using rad hard parts, but some difficulties still occur due to 
restrictions on the selection of parts. As countermeasures 
against the latter, means are taken such as providing an 
automatic data correction function for the RAM, or adding a 
watchdog function or undefined address interrupting function 
(when an undefined domain is addressed, an interruption is 
caused to make the processor find and detect the error) to 
prevent microprocessors from over-running or entering an endless 
loop. 
<H5>  (3) Reliability </H5>
  As the space unit cannot be repaired during operation, high 
reliability is required for the total system, realization of 
which must be done in steps, starting from the QA of every 
constituent part, to a sub-system, and finally to the whole 
system. 
<H5>  (4) Safety </H5>
  During retrieval by space shuttle, NASA's safety 
requirements 
have to be met (triple safety guards, in which even if two 
guards fail, the remaining one works). 
  To confirm fulfillment of these requirements, environmental 
tests are being carried out (vibration, shock, acoustic noise, 
heating in vacuum, electro-magnetic compatibility), and even in 
designing stage evaluation committees according to each design 
phase, are meeting to assess the appropriateness of the design 
work. 
<H5>  2.3 Features of EFFU Controlling System </H5>
<H5>  2.3.1 Problems of the System </H5>
  When the control system is structured, interlock functions 
must be provided from the viewpoint of safety, which shut down 
the system safely to prevent possible damage whenever an 
abnormality is found by the signal indicating temperature, 
pressure, voltage, current, etc., of the measuring system. These 
interlock functions, however, may cause a total system shutdown 
when only one failure is indicated by a sensor signal. 
<H5>  2.3.2 Consideration To Be Given in the Design Stage </H5>
  To improve reliability and prevent the system from shutting 
down due to just one failure, the following considerations are 
given in the design: 
  1. Redundant design 
  2. Fail-safe design 
  3. Derating design (safety margin design) 
  4. Use of reliable parts 
<H5>  2.3.3 Design of the EFFU Control System </H5>
  In the case of the EFFU system, a fail-safe and dilating 
design and use of reliable parts could be adopted, but a 
redundant design could be adopted for both sensor system and 
facility because of weight and volume restrictions. To fulfill 
the mission but still ensure safety, the interlock release 
function described below is provided. That is, when the ECU 
notices an extraordinary phenomenon, the system is shut down 
first to assure safety. The ECU immediately sends an error 
flag/error code to the earth, which gives details of the 
failure, allowing identification of the failure on the earth. 
<H5>  2.3.4 Items for Interlock Cancellation </H5>
  As cancellation of interlock in nature conflicts with the 
requirements of safety, identification and selection of 
interlock cancellation items (Table 2) required very serious 
consideration. All of these items are commonly used for control 
and inspection, and are limited to those in which a failure of 
the sensor concerned can be identified by data from other 
sensors.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 


<H5>  2.3.5 Operation of Interlock Release </H5>
  As shown in Fig. 5, when the error codes from the EFFU 
through the SFU are received by the earth station, the engineers 
at the station start data analyses to identify the cause of the 
failure using monitoring equipment on the earth. And when it is 
assured that the cause is a sensor failure and safety is not 
affected, release of the interlocking device is requested to the 
land control station to restart experiments. The command sent by 
land control station is delivered to the EFFU through the SFU to 
re-start the experiment. 

<FIG ID=JPRS-JST-015L-22A>      Fig. 5 Operation for Cancellation of Interlock </FIG>


  Release of interlocking devices is designed to be determined 
by failure analyses conducted on the earth station because of 
the long operation period of the SFU. The experiments in orbit 
are carried out under a time-sharing program between the three 
participating governmental bodies, which gives sufficient time 
for identifying a failure in the EFFU and a decision 
countermeasure while experiments other than those of the EFFU 
are being carried out. 
<H5>  2.3.6 Tasks for Future Operations </H5>
  An operation manual needs to be prepared that identifies the 
nature of a sensor failure by other sensors. This manual is for 
identifying a sensor failure sensor quickly and accurately 
during operation, using means such as flow charts with clear 
threshold values, which are based on environmental and 
functional experiment data obtained from the engineer model (EM) 
and the proto-flight model (PFM). 
<H5>  3. GHF/MHF and Their Control </H5>
<H5>  3.1 Outline of GHF and MHF </H5>
  GHF is a semiconductor manufacturing equipment (electric 
furnace), in which crystals are grown by moving the boundary 
surface of a solid/liquid state of a sample sealed in a 
cartridge at a determined speed, while giving temperature 
gradient to the sample. Eleven cartridges are provided, which 
can be continuously heat-treated by a sample exchange equipment. 
  MHF is similar furnace in which crystal growth is achieved 
by 
focusing a heating beam from a halogen lamp on a sample in a 
cartridge to form a melted surface, moving the furnace at a 
determined speed. Seven sample cartridges are provided. MHF is 
provided with a function to prevent irregular heating by 
rotating the sample due to the disadvantage of having only a 
one-point heating source. 
  Both the GHF and the MHF consist of control system, furnace, 
and sample exchanger. Figure 6 is the system diagram of GHF. 
Figure 7 is an illustration of the completed MHF. The GHF and 
the MHF are respectively mounted on a box-like structure called 
the PLU (Payload Unit) supplied by clients and are loaded on the 
SFU. The GHF on the PLU is illustrated in Figure 8. 

<FIG ID=JPRS-JST-015L-23A>      Fig. 6 Functional Diagram of GHF </FIG>


<FIG ID=JPRS-JST-015L-23B>      Fig. 7 MHF </FIG>



<FIG ID=JPRS-JST-015L-23C>      Fig. 8 GHF With PLU </FIG>



<H5>  3.2 Control of GHF and MHF </H5>
  Control of GHF and MHF is carried out by respective control 
equipment (GHF-CE, MHF-CE). The functions and features of each 
control equipment are as follows. 
<H5>  3.2.1 Communication Interface Between SFU Bus </H5>
  Like EFFU, the communication interface includes the 
following 
four. 
  Discrete on/off signal (start/stop) 
  Fault interface (shut-off request on fault) 
  Command (two-way communication with bus) 
  Telemetry (data communication to bus) 
<H5>  3.2.2 Temperature Control of GHF </H5>
  A thermocouple is provided for each of the three heaters of 
the GHF for control. The GHF-CE controls these heaters 
independently, aiming to form the same temperature profile as 
that previously determined in the land experiment. 
  To meet the safety requirements of NASA (assuring safety 
even 
under double failures), three mutually independent temperature 
limiters are provided against overheating of the heaters to shut 
off the power supply to the GHF at the pre-set limiting 
temperature. One of the limiters is a software limiter operated 
by a CPU, while the other two consist only of hardware. For the 
latter hardware limiters not operated through CPU, consideration 
is given to assure they work properly even when the software 
limiter fails, as in a CPU runaway caused by cosmic rays. 
  These three limiters are of the type in which thermal 
measurement errors in the thermocouple caused by the 
environmental temperature fluctuation are automatically 
compensated. 
<H5>  3.2.3 Power Control in MHF </H5>
  In the MHF, the power input to one heating lamp is 
IPD-controlled to achieve a power profile that is the same as 
that predetermined by land experiments. 
  Like the GHF, the MHF is also provided with three 
independent 
over-heat limiters. In the case of MHF, however, the structure 
of the furnace does not allow the furnace temperature to be 
directly measured for preventing the overheating of the heating 
lamp. Therefore, unlike the GHF which is provided with 
temperature limiters a method is adopted whereby overheating of 
the furnace heating lamp is detected by the voltage of the power 
input. That is, noticing that the electric resistance of the 
lamp filament varies in proportion to its temperature, the 
method utilizes the fact that even when constant power is 
supplied to the lamp, if the furnace becomes overheated the 
supply voltage increases above normal and overheating is 
detected by this excessive voltage. 
<H5>  3.2.4 High-Efficiency Power Amplifier </H5>
  Control device of GHF-CE and MHF-CE have to meet designing 
conditions capable to deal with: 
  [1] Severe restrictions from resources such as power, 
weight, 
and dimensions. 
  [2] The restriction of heat disposal is severe. In addition, 
for the power amplifier, the principal component of the control 
system, there are the following difficult design conditions. 
  [3] The heater lamp of the furnace being a load, is short 
and 
fat to give the required vibration resistance, this making the 
electric resistance of the lamp as low as some 1 ohm, thus 
causing more power loss. 
  [4] The electromagnetic compatibility (EMC) with the 
satellite system requires the amount of noise affecting the 
powerline to be limited and the necessity of performing 
restriction of inrush current of start-up. 
  Accordingly, the power amplifier must be highly efficient 
even at a low resistance load, and still be small and light 
after meeting the EMC requirement. Under these restrictions, a 
push-pull type of high efficiency power amplifier with a 70 kHz 
switching frequency was developed (Table 3). To realize high 
efficiency, the following design features were incorporated: 
  [1] Optimization of snubber for balancing the loss and noise 
(if the snubber is strengthened noise is reduced, however the 
loss increases making efficiency low). 
  [2] Optimization of switching frequency (with increased 
frequency, the weight and dimensions of transformer/inductor 
will be cut but efficiency will decrease). 
  [3] By connecting in parallel the switching FET and the 
primary input capacitor, the loss power was cut by decreasing 
its register element. 
  [4] Applying high density outfit technique. 
  These design parameters were determined for their optimum 
values by rotating the cycle of analyzing/experimenting in the 
development steps consisting of elemental prototype, engineering 
model, and proto-flight model. In particular, for assessing the 
heat disposal of high heat generating elements, temperature 
distribution measurement by a thermo-viewer and a heat test are 
conducted to ensure the high density outfit design is adequate. 

<FIG ID=JPRS-JST-015L-24A>      Table 3. Specification of Power Amplifier </FIG>


<H5>  3.2.5 Function of Sample Exchange Control </H5>
  The sample exchange equipment is required to position with 
high accuracy the sample within an eccentricity of less than +/- 
0.1mm between the center of the furnace and that of the sample. 
Especially for the MHF, if the focus of the heating ray is 
off-center from the fusing point of cartridge, the impact on the 
experiment is great, because the required heating temperature 
might not be reached. Due to the above reasons, the accuracy of 
turning angle control for the sample cartridge positioning motor 
is required to be within less than +/- 0.08 degrees. 
  To realize such high accuracy, a non-contact type high 
accuracy position sensor is adopted and, by combining a rough 
accuracy sensor and fine accuracy sensors together, a sensing 
accuracy of about +/- 0.0083 degree (0.5 minutes) can be 
obtained. 
  A low vibration motor was developed to create a microgravity 
atmosphere. The order of the gravity generated by the motor is 
10[.sup]-6[/]G. 
<H5>  3.2.6 Control of Thaw in Heat Pipe </H5>
  The heat pipe developed for heat disposal in furnaces uses 
water as a cooling fluid. If SFU started operation at a 
temperature below zero, a case often expected in the operation 
of the SFU, the fluid might [be] frozen. If the fluid is frozen, 
the furnace might overheat due to poor heat disposal because of 
deterioration of heat transfer. Furthermore, only the fluid near 
the furnace is thawed, and the evaporated fluid causing very 
high pressures in the heat pipe, might break the heat pipe, 
which is a serious safety problem. 
  Therefore, controlling thaw of the heat pipe is 
automatically 
started upon commencement of furnace operations. This control is 
carried out by judging freeze or thaw from the temperature 
rising pattern measured by temperature sensors provided on the 
heat pipes. When operation of furnace is started, a small power 
supply of some 50W is provided first to the furnace. With frozen 
liquid, the temperature of the heatpipe shows a rise once and 
then decreases as shown in Fig. 9a. The point where decreasing 
begins is judged to be the thawing point. On the other hand, 
when it is already thawed and the power continues to be supplied 
if the temperature does not rise above a certain temperature as 
shown in Fig. 9b, it is judged to be the thawing point. The 
relation between time and temperature for the judgment was 
determined by data in land testing. With this control, the 
thawing of the heat pipe can be reliably carried out, regardless 
of the state of the fluid. 

<FIG ID=JPRS-JST-015L-25A>      Fig. 9 Temperature Rise Pattern of Heat Pipe </FIG>


  For safety, even if this control does not work due to 
possible CPU runaway, a rupture of the heat pipe caused by its 
overheating can be avoided with two independent thermostats 
installed on the heat pipe. 
<H5>  3.2.7 Parameter-Changing Function </H5>
  For the control parameters of furnaces (e.g., target 
temperature, heating time, furnace traveling speed), data proved 
in land tests and installed in the PROM of the CE are used. 
However, the equipment has to wait about two years before its 
flight, during which period it is assembled as a satellite, and 
undergoes various system test procedures. Therefore, functions 
are provided to change the control parameters with commands from 
the earth, because [1] many changes might be required for 
parameters installed in the PROM as the result of land 
experiments thereafter, and [2] to facilitate operation of the 
field experiment staff. 
  The above function was not necessarily required for the 
existing experiment system of small rockets because its 
operating time is only a few minutes. While for experiments in 
the space shuttle, a scientist in the crew can operate the 
equipment. 
  The function of changing parameters is executed under the 
procedure below: 
  [1] The control parameters must be checked previously on the 
earth to confirm that the change causes no problem from land 
experiment or other means. 
  [2] The parameter values for experiment desired to be 
changed 
are made to be recorded in the change data memory on RAM of CE's 
of GHF and MHF by the command from the earth. 
  [3] When this experiment is to be executed, the program 
checks automatically whether there are data recorded in the 
change data memory, and if such data exists, the experiment is 
carried out with the new data replacing the old parameter values. 
<H5>  4. Conclusion </H5>
  Production of the PFM for each item of equipment are 
completed, and the SFU system tests are now being carried out. 
Following these tests, the equipment will be delivered after 
some minor work, such as replacement of consumable spare parts. 
We will exert our best efforts to make the equipment work 
properly in the actual flight to bring about successful 
experiments. 
  It should be noted that the development of both the GHF and 
the MHF have been carried out under a contract given to IHI by 
the New Energy and Industry Technology Development Organization 
(NEDO).

  [Text] The third and fourth solid propellant storage 
facilities store the solid rocket boosters (SRBs) for H-II 
launch vehicles. They are located 2km northeast of Yoshinobu 
Launch Site and are surrounded by embankments and fences. 
<H5>  Major Structure and Functions of Third and Fourth Solid </H5>
Propellant Storage Facilities 
<H5>  (1)Building </H5>
  The third and fourth solid propellant storage facilities are 
reinforced concrete buildings, each with 478 square meters of 
floor space. The ceilings of the facilities have a 
blast-releasing structure to release inside pressures above the 
specified pressure. Each facility consists of a storage facility 
and an air-conditioning machine room where an air-conditioner 
and other equipment, such as signal transmission unit and 
temperature and humidity monitoring unit, are installed. 
<H5>  (2)Electric, Air-Conditioning, and Other Equipment </H5>
  1) Electric equipment has an explosion-proof structure. 
  2) Debonding and cracking, which might cause abnormal 
combustion or explosions, may occur between the rocket chamber 
and the propellant due to temperature and humidity changes 
during their storage. Therefore, the temperature and humidity 
are controlled by employing a circulating air-conditioning 
system. The warm or cool air is injected from the upper part of 
the wall, and the air is sucked from the lower part of the wall 
passing through the air-conditioning machine through the 
concrete ducts. Twenty percent of the circulated air is replaced 
with fresh air. Temperature and humidity sensors are installed 
in the facilities and their data can be monitored and recorded 
at the Operation Monitoring Building (adjacent to Osaki Power 
Supply Facility). 
  3) Two 15-ton explosion-proof hoists are installed on the 
girder for transferring SRBs in and out and moving them in the 
facility. 
  4) Intruders are monitored at the Integrated Disaster 
Prevention Monitoring Station through vibration sensors 
installed on the doors and ceilings, a warning system with door 
switches on the doors, and ITV cameras installed on the 
embankments. 

<FIG ID=JPRS-JST-015L-27A>      FIGURE </FIG>


  The electric, air-conditioning, and other equipment consists 
of the items below: 
  1. Lighting equipment; 2. Electric power equipment; 3. 
Incoming transfer equipment; 4. Telephone equipment; 5. Signal 
equipment; 6. Lightening protection equipment; 7. Disaster

jointly by the National Space Development Agency of Japan 
(NASDA), the Institute of Space and Astronautical Science 
(ISAS), and the New Energy and Industrial Technology Development

  The Space Flyer Unit (SFU) core system is being developed by 
ISAS in cooperation with NEDO. NASDA is responsible for 
launching SFU by the H-II launch vehicle, supporting SFU 
tracking and control operation by ISAS, and developing SFU-borne 
Exposed Facility Flyer Unit (EFFU) which is the NASDA experiment 
mission. 
  The SFU is scheduled to be launched with the Geostationary 
Meteorological Satellite-5 (GMS-5) in the season of 
January-February 1995 by the H-II Launch Vehicle Flight No. 3 
from Tanegashima Space Center. It will be retrieved by the NASA 
Space Shuttle in the summer of 1995 after operating for six 
months on-orbit. 
  NASDA selected as its SFU experiment mission the validation 
experiment of the component model of the "Exposed Facility" for 
the Japanese Experiment Module (JEM) for the international Space 
Station "Freedom" and the "Vapor-Phase Growth Fundamental 
Experiment," a common experiment. They were developed and 
assembled into the EFFU as shown in Fig. 1. 

<FIG ID=JPRS-JST-015L-28A>      Fig. 1 Structure of EFFU </FIG>


  The main purposes of validating the component model of the 
exposed facility are to verify the operation of the separation 
and connection mechanism used for replacing experiment equipment 
in space, to establish an active thermal control system with 
fluid heat transfer loop, to establish microgravity measuring 
technology in microgravity conditions, and to evaluate the 
characteristics of the materials exposed to space environments. 
  Homogeneity of plasma generation in microgravity is observed 
and the diamond substrate growth in the plasma environments is 
verified using the Gas Dynamics Experiment Facility (GDEF) to 
conduct the Vapor-Phase Growth Fundamental Experiment. 
  The test of the EFFU itself was completed in the summer of 
1992 and the EFFU was assembled into the SFU core body. The 
one-year SFU system test was to verify the compatibility of the 
EFFU with the SFU core system was completed.

  [Text] ETS-VI Protoflight Test Completed: Three 
Tests Conducted in Addition to Six Major Experiment Themes; 
Testing Entered Final Stage in Preparation for Launch in 1994. 
  The Engineering Test Satellite-VI (ETS-VI) is a 2-ton 
three-axis-stabilized geostationary satellite scheduled to be 
launched in the August-September launch season in 1994 by H-II 
Launch Vehicle Flight No. 2. The purpose of the satellite is to 
establish fundamental technologies for applications satellites 
and to develop, test and validate the satellite-borne equipment 
required for advanced satellite communication technology. 
  ETS-VI has undergone protoflight testing at the Spacecraft 
Integration and Test Building in Tsukuba Space Center since 
March 1992, and all tests were completed at the end of August 
1993. The protoflight test, including environmental testing in 
simulated space environments, is to verify the appropriateness 
of the ETS-VI satellite design and to confirm the designed 
functions in space. The major tests conducted are described 
below. 
<H5>  (1) Electric Performance Test </H5>
  Electric function and performance of the satellite were 
tested. 
<H5>  (2) Mass Property Test </H5>
  The satellite weight and center of gravity were measured. 
<H5>  (3) Vibration Test </H5>
  Sinusoidal vibration equivalent to that generated during 
rocket launch was applied to the satellite. Strength and 
rigidity of the satellite structure in this environment and 
satellite-borne equipment resistance against vibration were 
verified. 
<H5>  (4) Acoustic Test </H5>
  Acoustic loads equivalent to those generated during rocket 
launch were applied to the satellite in the Acoustic Chamber. 
Strength of the satellite structure in the acoustic environments 
at the launch and the satellite-borne equipment resistance 
against the acoustic environments were verified. 
<H5>  (5) Deployment and Separation Shock Test </H5>
  Resistance of the satellite and satellite-borne equipment to 
shocks generated by pyrotechnic ignition (*1) was tested. 
Deployment and separation functions were verified at the same 
time. 
<H5>  (6)Thermal Equilibrium and Thermal Vacuum Test </H5>
  The satellite was put in the large space chamber which 
simulates the vacuum and cryogenic conditions in space and given 
thermal input by the Simulated Solar Ray Irradiation Equipment 
and thermal infrared lamps. Thermal design and thermal function 
and performance on orbit and electrical performance of the 
satellite in the thermal vacuum environments were verified. 
  In addition to the above tests, alignment measurement, solar 
paddle irradiation test, and propulsion system leak test, etc. 
were included in the protoflight test. The satellite will be 
transported to Tanegashima Space Center for launch in April 1994 
after undergoing partial modification necessary to employ it in 
flight and compatibility tests for intersatellite data relay 
experiment. The satellite will undergo final verification and 
preparation at the launch site.

  [Text] ADEOS System Passed EM Development Test and 
Opened to Public: System Development Test and Compatibility 
Test With ETS-VI and Ground System Generally Successful. 
  The Advanced Earth Observing Satellite (ADEOS) system 
engineering model (EM) development test was conducted from May 
to August 1993 at Tsukuba Space Center. The system EM was put in 
the radio anechoic chamber in the Radio Test Building, where the 
bus equipment performance and function and the interfaces with 
the mission equipment were verified. The model was also tested 
in the electromagnetic environments produced by the satellite 
communication equipment. The tests verified that the satellite 
operation and the observation data transmission were 
satisfactory. Data acquired during the test were evaluated by 
the observation sensor development organizations to verify good 
interfaces with the satellite. The results of the development 
test will be used for establishing the protoflight test 
procedures as well as reflected into the protoflight model 
design. 
  A compatibility test between ADEOS, the Engineering Test 
Satellite-VI (ETS-VI), and the experiment ground system was 
conducted, following the system engineering model development 
test. The purpose of the test was to verify the interface 
between the above three systems by connecting them on the ground 
to obtain data for the experiment base line for NASDA's first 
intersatellite communication experiment between ADEOS, ETS-VI, 
and the experiment ground system. Good communication was 
verified, but some problems were discovered in the interfaces. 
These were reflected into the design of ADEOS protoflight model 
and the experiment ground system. 
  A series of environmental tests, including acoustic, 
vibration, and shock tests, was conducted on the structural and 
thermal model (STM) since April 1993 at the Spacecraft 
Integration and Test Building of Tsukuba Space Center. The tests 
were completed, and the model was published to the press on 
September 17, 1993. STM has undergone thermal vacuum tests since 
late November 1993.

  [Text] In July 1993, the Advisory Panel on Space Transfer 
and Return System (chaired by Shigebumi Saito, Professor 
Emeritus of the University of Tokyo) of the Space Activities 
Commission (SAC) concluded a report on Space Transfer and Return 
System. The report pointed out that, considering the variety of 
space activities in the 21st century, the research and 
development on an unmanned winged re-entry vehicle launched by 
an expendable launch vehicle to meet the needs of the early 
2000s should be started. It also pointed out that it is 
important to conduct a flight test in this century using a 
transportation technology test vehicle. 

<FIG ID=JPRS-JST-015L-31A>      FIGURE </FIG>


  The National Space Development Agency of Japan (NASDA) is 
conducting the space transportation system research in 
accordance with the SAC guidelines described below. 


    -  Design study on a transportation technology test 
vehicle which can be launched by H-II launch vehicle to 
establish system technology covering subjects from the launch of 
an unmanned winged re-entry vehicle to atmospheric re-entry and 
landing is being conducted. 
  -  The experiment vehicle, Orbital 
Re-entry Experiment (OREX), which simulates the structure of the 
nose portion of a winged space transportation vehicle, was 
trial-produced and is being serviced at the launch site for the 
orbit re-entry experiment. OREX will be launched by the H-II 
Launch Vehicle Test Flight No. 1 scheduled for launch on 
February 1, 1994. It will acquire data related to structural 
materials and designs which resist high temperature when it 
re-enters the atmosphere from orbit. 
  -  Preparation is being made 
to launch lift vehicle by the J-I rocket for flight at an 
altitude of 100km to acquire flight data during hypersonic 
flight (at mach 15) of the winged re-entry vehicle. 
  -  Preparation 
is being made for small-scale automatic landing experiments. A 
scale model of the winged transportation vehicle will be 
released from a high altitude and allowed to automatically land 
on the runway using a fully automatic guidance control.

  [Text] A new type of artificial fatty droplet, or liposome, 
has been developed that can be used in a controlled manner to 
fuse with the membranes of living cells. 
  The liposome was developed as a way to extract useful 
products made by cells in a new type of bioreactor being 
developed in Japan called the micro-cell reactor. But it also 
appears to be a promising vehicle for delivery of drugs to 
target cells in the body. The work was carried out by the Agency 
of Industrial Science and Technology's National Institute of 
Bioscience and Human-Technology. 
  The liposome readily fuses with fatty membranes because it 
incorporates the same protein that the influenza virus uses to 
breach the cell membrane and infect cells. Cholesterol and 
another compound are mixed. This viral protein is then affixed 
around the periphery, producing a protein-studded liposome less 
than a micron in diameter. 
  When these liposomes and red blood cells are mixed in a 
neutral solution, nothing happens. But when the acidity is 
raised a little, as many as 80 percent of the liposomes fuse 
with the red blood cells. This experiment shows that it is 
possible to control fusion events between the liposomes and 
cells. 
  The micro-cell reactor differs from conventional bioreactors 
in that all processes, from the introduction of raw materials 
and energy, to the final stage of production when it is time to 
extract useful substances, takes place inside living cells. The 
process is designed to boost productivity. The national 
institute developed the liposome as part of its effort to 
develop an exocyte system to extract useful products from the 
reactor.

<F P=106> [Article by Aya Furuta, staff writer] </F>
  [Text] In simple terms, gene therapy means enlisting the 
genetic blueprint of life in the battle to cure disease. While 
the technique is still at the basic research stage, some 
clinical success has already been reported, especially in the 
U.S. 
  In Japan, the government has finally set up screening 
committees for gene therapy trials, so now it is only a matter 
of time before Japanese clinical researchers can investigate the 
tremendous potential of this therapeutic technique. 
  Gene therapy was initially viewed mainly as a way to treat 
specific genetic disorders. But it is now seen in a larger 
context as a potential strategy for dealing with such general 
disorders as cancer and heart disease, in addition to fixing 
specific gene malfunctions. 
<H5>  Loaded Gun </H5>
  Whether aiming for something broad like heart disease or 
pinpointing a specific genetic problem, gene therapy involves 
the introduction of foreign genetic information into the body's 
cells. 
  Sometimes the goal is to throw a precisely aimed monkey 
wrench into the works, but most often the objective is to coax 
cells into incorporating the new genetic material and 
translating the genetic information into useful therapeutic 
substances. 
  In this sense, gene therapy is similar to the genetic 
engineering which has been going on for years. The difference, 
of course, is that the cells being genetically manipulated are 
human cells, and they are not cells in a plastic dish, but cells 
in people's bodies. 
  This raises numerous ethical questions, not least of which 
is 
the problem of people custom-ordering specific traits for their 
children. Technically, that is not possible yet because not 
enough is known about the human genome. Even so, ethical 
committees have already begun to address such topics. 
  In the meantime, a more pressing issue involves the safety 
of 
the techniques employed in gene therapy. The standard way of 
introducing foreign genetic material into cells is to ferry it 
in aboard viruses injected into the body. 
  The danger for gene therapy is that a virus used as a 
"vector" to introduce useful genetic material may itself start 
replicating inside the patient. Another danger is that the 
foreign genetic material could be introduced at a site 
disruptive to other important genes. 
  For this reason, scientists are looking at alternative 
approaches, such as using fatty droplets as the vector, and 
removing cells from the body and genetically engineering them in 
a controlled laboratory setting before returning them to the 
patient. 
<H5>  On Target </H5>
  Assuming that gene therapy can be made safe, what are the 
possible applications? One of the major targets is cancer. 
  At Niigata University, Kenichi Tanaka is studying gene 
therapy as a means of treating ovarian cancer. His strategy is 
to genetically alter the cancer cells so that they start 
producing an enzyme normally produced by the herpes virus, and 
then to kill the cancer cells with a herpes drug. 
  In experiments on mice, Tanaka says he can shrink tumors to 
less than half their original size in two weeks. "If I can, I'd 
like to start clinical trials within the year," says a hopeful 
Tanaka. 

<FIG ID=JPRS-JST-015L-32A>      FIGURE </FIG>


  At the National Cancer Research Institute, Teruhiko Yoshida 
and Kazunori Aoki are developing a gene therapy for pancreatic 
cancer that has metastasized throughout the gut. This type of 
cancer is believed to be triggered by a gene called K-ras. 
  The researchers propose introducing a gene into the body 
that 
directs the continual production of a substance to block K-ras 
and inhibit the proliferation of cancer cells. Work is still at 
the stage of animal testing, however, and it could be some time 
before the therapy can be tested on humans. 
  In the end, cancer may turn out to be too tall an order for 
gene therapy alone. Cancer cells multiply extremely rapidly, and 
to be completely effective it might be necessary to introduce 
therapeutic genes into every cell. "The reality is that we now 
can only insert genes into about 5-10 percent of cells," says 
Tanaka. 
  But as long as there is no truly effective treatment for 
progressive cancers, gene therapy used alongside chemotherapy 
"would certainly strengthen our hand," says Yoshida. 
  Meanwhile, gene therapy remains the most promising way to 
cure hereditary disorders caused by defects in single genes. 
  There is already one success story: gene therapy has been 
used in the U.S. to treat children lacking a properly 
functioning gene for the enzyme adenosine deaminase (ADA). In 
the absence of this enzyme, people experience severe 
immunodeficiency. 
  In Japan, researchers at Hokkaido University are preparing 
for a similar project to treat ADA deficiency. Other researchers 
are developing gene therapy strategies to treat different 
genetic disorders. For example, Yoichi Nabeshima at the National 
Center of Neurology and Psychology is leading an effort to 
tackle Duchenne's muscular dystrophy. 
  It was only recently that the faulty gene responsible for 
this muscle-degenerating disease was identified. Nabeshima's 
idea is to inject a vector carrying a functional copy of this 
gene into the bloodstream, from where it would be transported 
throughout the body. 
  There are still many questions to be resolved, however, such 
as how to make a gene function on the muscles only, and not on 
the liver or kidneys.

  [Text] Koichi Komatsu, assistant professor of the 
Chemistry Laboratory of Kyoto University, et. al., have 
synthesized a new organic compound that is highly reactive with 
other substances. As a hydrocarbon it dissolves readily in 
organic solvents, and its processability is excellent. Although 
the research is still in its preliminary stages, Assistant 
Professor Komatsu hopes to use the new compound to develop 
functional materials such as catalysts that control 
single-electron reactions, or electrical elements. 
  The new organic compound is 
tetrakis-bicylcoocteno-cyclooctatetraene, whose structure 
consists of an octagonal cyclic hydrocarbon to which four 
T-shaped portions are attached. It is capable of accepting and 
donating four electrons, becoming either an ion with a charge of 
+2 or an ion with a charge of -2. This is a larger number of 
electrons than previously known organic compounds could accept 
and donate, which makes it highly reactive with other substances. 
  The first step in the synthesis is to react a bromide of the 
T-shaped bicyclooctene with an organic solvent. By removing the 
bromine while simultaneously causing four molecules to react 
with each other, an octagonal cyclic hydrocarbon is formed as 
four bicycloocteno portions join together. The new compound is 
stable in air at room temperature. Highly reactive free radicals 
are generated by exposure to visible light, showing that it is 
an organic catalyst that reacts with other substances. 
  Organic compounds dissolve more easily in organic solvents 
than do inorganic catalysts. Assistant Professor Komatsu says, 
"This is still the preliminary stage of research, so the fields 
of application are not yet clear, but the excellent stabilty and 
solubility should lead to functional material applications."

  [Text] The Japan High Polymer Center is beginning a 
program in the development and application of high functionality 
separation film technology for uses such as petroleum 
purification. In the past there has been a concern with finding 
methods of reducing the harm to the environment while saving 
energy if a separation film process were to be used to purify 
petroleum. Both the technological and financial aspects of the 
problem have been discussed. As the result of about one year of 
research, the Ministry of International Trade and Industry 
(MITI) reports that such applications are in fact possible, and 
is therefore establishing the Advanced Materials Laboratory at 
the High Polymer Center. MITI is also embarking on this research 
and development in cooperation with the film manufacturers Tore 
and Nitto Electric, as well as with petroleum purification 
companies, the engineering industry, and universities. 
  The separation of liquids and gases with polymer films has 
made great technological strides in recent years and is used for 
a wide range of applications. However, distillation is still the 
basic step in the petroleum purification process. The use of 
separation films has merit, but MITI says that new technological 
advances are required because "these liquids have high 
viscosity." In fact, there are as yet no examples of successful 
application anywhere in the world. 
  MITI's Center for Promoting the Petroleum Industry has been 
investigating the suitability of separation films for pertroleum 
purification. Their conclusion is that the technology is 
difficult but application is possible if the necessary advances 
can be made in polymer technology. MITI also said that it will 
support increased technical cooperation with oil-producing 
nations such as Saudi Arabia. 
  The focus of this research and development will be the High 
Polymer Center. Technical investigations will be carried out by 
the Joint International Separation Film Specialists Research 
Committee, studying the state of experimental research. 
Participants include scholars such as Professor Naoshi Kimura of 
Tokyo University and Professor Teruhiko Oya of Yokohama National 
University, the Materials Engineering Technology Laboratory, 
Arabia Oil, Shukko Kosan, Chiyoda Kako Kensetsu, Tore, and Nitto 
Electric. Research will be conducted at the Advanced Materials 
Laboratory that is expected to be completed by February of next 
year, with Tore and Nitto Electric in charge. 
  The 1993 budget calls for expenditures of about &yen;200 
million (about $2 million), and MITI expects the project to last 
10 years. Film materials are currently made from polyimides or 
PPS, but materials of higher functionality will be sought. MITI 
also says that research will attempt to find applications 
through modularization and bench plants.

  [Text] Due to its promotion of technology for the advanced 
re-use of energy and resources, the Japanese steel industry is 
known as a representative recycling industry. Having to handle 
as much as 50 million tons of by-products annually, the industry 
has been involved from the earliest stages in the technological 
development of methods capable of transforming these products 
into reusable resources. Slag, for example, was formerly 
disposed of as land fill. But today 100 percent of blast furnace 
slag is usefully recycled, mostly as an ingredient of cement, 
while more than 75 percent of BOF and electric furnace slag is 
recycled. The Japan Iron and Steel Federation has recently 
released the current recycling situation of the Japanese steel 
industry. 
  Slag consists of two types: blast furnace slag, which is a 
by-product of the ironmaking process wherein iron ore is reduced 
to make iron, and steelmaking slag -- basic-oxygen furnace (BOF) 
slag and electric furnace slag -- which is a by-product of the 
process whereby pig iron is refined to steel. Blast furnace slag 
is produced at a rate of about 320 kg for every ton of pig iron. 
Within the ironmaking process, slag inevitably results from the 
need to use limestone for extracting all impurities, such as 
silica and alumina, from the iron ore. As for steelmaking slag, 
on the other hand, for every ton of crude steel produced there 
are about 134 kg of BOF slag and 120 kg of electric furnace 
slag, respectively. At current levels of iron and steel 
production in Japan, about 30 million tons of blast furnace slag 
and 13 million tons of steelmaking plant slag are created, for a 
huge annual total exceeding 43 million tons. 
<H5>  100 Percent Recycling of Blast Furnace Slag </H5>
  The history of blast furnace slag recycling goes back to the 
early 1900s. At that time, slag was already being used in cement 
and road-building materials, but real efforts by the Japanese 
steel industry in this area began with the formation in 1976 of 
the Slag Recycling Committee by the Japan Iron and Steel 
Federation. As a result, in 1990, 100 percent of blast furnace 
slag was recycled as a reusable resource. This came about with 
the consolidation of industry efforts, as in the aforementioned 
committee, and with the established evaluation of blast furnace 
slag as a water-hardenable material. 
  Particularly, granulated slag is in great demand as an 
excellent raw material for cement, with 56.5 percent going into 
cement production in 1990. As a result, the granulating ratio of 
blast furnace slag has risen sharply in recent years. 
Subsequently as a material for road and railway use (road 
construction and aggregate for concrete), it commands 23 percent. 
  Blast furnace cement in particular has a suppressing effect 
on the alkali-aggregate reactions that cause deterioration in 
concrete structures. Furthermore, it is drawing attention with 
regard to the global environment because, compared to 
conventional cements (Portland cement), the manufacturing 
process requires 50 percent less energy. 
<H5>  Steelmaking Slag </H5>
  Of all disposable BOF slag, effective reuse is made of 88 
percent or 8.90 million tons, for electric furnace slag the 
total is 75 percent or 2.40 million tons. Compared to 1980 when 
only one-fourth of all BOF slag and one-half of all electric 
furnace slag was used simply for land reclamation, there has 
been steady progress in the effective reuse of slag. 
  Most applications are in roads and railways, harbor 
construction, and foundation improvement, although some usage is 
even occurring in fertilizers and soil improvement. Although the 
use of steelmaking slag as a roadbed material can cause a 
phenomenon known as expansion cracking, this can be corrected 
with the proper preparatory processing. 
  In addition to its use as aggregate for cement and roads, 
slag is also employed in calcium silicate fertilizers and 
fertilizers containing phosphates and minerals. It is also made 
into sintered paving tiles and is used to improve water quality 
and ground soil. Moreover, as rock wool it is finding 
broad-ranging use in many types of building materials. 
<H5>  93 Percent Recycling of Dust </H5>
  Because iron ore is melted and hot metal is refined at high 
temperatures, the steel industry has a multitude of dust 
collectors in place. Dust is captured in these collectors at a 
rate of about 5 million tons per year. A look at the reuse of 
this dust shows that since it has considerable iron content, 
almost all (60 percent) of it is returned to the sintering 
machines as an ironmaking raw material. 
<H5>  Reduced Sludge Production </H5>
  The steel industry uses massive amounts of water for cooling 
and cleaning. Because the water used to clean mill rolls and 
finished steel products accumulates iron- and oil-laden grime, 
it must be treated. The water treatment facilities used for this 
purpose extract about 700,000 tons per year (dry base) of 
various types of sludge. 
  The recycling of these sludges lags behind that of slag and 
dust, with just under 30 percent being used as sintering 
material in order to recover the iron contained therein. 
  Also, hydrochloric acid is used at the steelworks to clean 
the surfaces of steel sheets, thereby removing iron oxide. From 
the waste hydrochloric acid produced at this time, good quality 
iron oxides are recovered. Recently, since ferrite is utilized 
in the constituent materials of cutting-edge data processing 
equipment, such as AV equipment, magnetic tapes and magnet cores 
for computers, this iron oxide is being used as a raw material 
in ferrite production. 

<FIG ID=JPRS-JST-015L-36A>      FIGURE </FIG>


  The Japanese steel industry's recycling technology is 
recognized around the world as the most advanced of its kind. 
The reuse of resources pertains not only to the effective use of 
materials but to environmental preservation as well. The 
Japanese steel industry conducts technical cooperation with the 
understanding that global protection of the environment is well 
served by sharing with the world these technologies as well as 
other already existing, yet superb technologies for energy 
conservation, highly efficient iron- and steelmaking operations 
and waste treatment.

  [Text] Tokyo Gas Co. and Mitsubishi Heavy Industries Ltd. 
have jointly developed what they claim is the first fuel cell 
that utilizes city gas made from the liquified natural gas, 
instead of hydrogen, as fuel. 
  The companies have already succeeded in generating 5 kW of 
electricity with the fuel cell. The solid-macromolecule-type 
fuel cell can generate electricity more effectively than other 
types, the company officials said. 
  The key technology of the fuel cell is a newly developed 
device that extracts pure hydrogen from city gas with thin 
palladium films. The companies plan to continue testing the fuel 
cell until 1996, and are expected to commercialize it early next 
century. 
  Fuel cells are expected to serve as future electricity 
generators in urban areas because they produce less nitrogen 
oxide, noise and vibrations.

  [Text] Consumers want to purchase environment-friendly 
products, and manufacturers want to accommodate them. But how to 
calculate the environmental impact of, say, a car or a 
refrigerator or an entire building? 
  That is a problem which has just recently begun to be 
addressed in a process called life-cycle assessment. 
  It is not just a matter of measuring the environmental 
impact 
of a product while in use. The entire life cycle of the product 
must be considered, embracing the acquisition of natural 
resources, the production of materials, the manufacture of 
goods, the distribution of goods, the use of those goods and 
finally their disposal, including recycling wherever possible. 
  Moves are afoot to establish international standards for the 
assessment of the environmental impact of various products. In 
the meantime, government, academic and corporate groups are 
grappling on their own with the problem of how to devise valid 
evaluation methods. 
  Since global warming and destruction of the ozone layer are 
foremost in the minds of people worried about the environmental 
impact of industrial activity, many efforts at life-cycle 
assessment focus on the generation of carbon dioxide and 
chlorofluorocarbons. 
<H5>  Life of a Building </H5>
  A life-cycle assessment for buildings was made by 
researchers 
from Waseda University and Nikken Sekkei Ltd., the largest 
architectural designing company in Japan. They asked how carbon 
dioxide emissions would change if the building were designed to 
be more energy efficient and to last longer. For their study, 
they considered every stage in the life of a building, from 
construction through operation and renovation to final 
demolition. 
  According to their calculations, if the building were 
designed with state-of-the-art air conditioning and other 
systems to reduce energy consumption by 50 percent during 
operation, more carbon dioxide would be generated during the 
construction of the building. Nevertheless, emissions could be 
reduced by 18 percent over the entire life of the building. 
  A similar life-cycle assessment for automobiles was carried 
out by the University of Tokyo and the National Institution for 
Environmental Studies. They calculated that carbon dioxide 
emissions equivalent to 8.3 metric tons of carbon are released 
for each car. The calculation takes into account the 
manufacture, use, maintenance and disposal of cars. 
  Fuel consumption accounts for 70 percent of the lost carbon, 
which should not be surprising. But another 10 percent comes 
from the construction and maintenance of roads for the cars to 
drive on. The researchers note that this is a significant amount 
and argue that roadway infrastructure is a factor which cannot 
be ignored when evaluating the environmental impact of cars. 
  At the company level, Canon Inc. recently calculated the 
amount of carbon dioxide released during the life cycle of the 
replaceable toner cartridges used in its photocopiers. The 
company's assessment took into account overseas transport of the 
toner and looked at how recycling could cut down on emissions. 
  Life-cycle assessments are not limited to evaluations of 
greenhouse gas emissions. IBM Japan Ltd., for example, is 
studying ways to design computers that are easier to recycle. 
The process involves evaluating how easily machines can be 
dismantled. 
  Meanwhile, the Plastic Waste Management Institute is 
investigating plastic materials and evaluating how the 
conservation of raw materials and energy would cut down on the 
emission of environmental pollutants. 
<H5>  Unravelling the Knot </H5>
  Despite such efforts, life-cycle assessment is still a young 
science and many problems still need to be resolved. For 
example, carbon dioxide is not the only harmful substance 
produced during product life cycles; solid wastes and nitrogen 
oxides are also released. It is difficult to untangle all the 
factors and decide which have significant impact on the 
environment. 
  The Ministry of International Trade and Industry wants to 
collect more data on the subject. It feels that none of the 
evaluation methods have been fully substantiated yet. For this 
reason, government agencies including the Science and Technology 
Agency and the Environment Agency are working to develop new 
methods while keeping a close eye on efforts by researchers 
elsewhere in the field.

  [Text] The production and use of substances used as 
substitutes for chlorofluorocarbons should be regulated because 
they damage the earth's ozone layer too, an environmental 
advisory council said Thursday. 
  The Central Environment Council made the proposal to Wakako 
Hironaka, director general of the Environment Agency. She was 
urged to revise the current legislation on protecting the ozone 
layer to comply with an international agreement, strengthened in 
November 1992, on phasing out ozone-depleting chemicals. 
  The agency hopes to submit the revision to the current Diet 
session. 
  CFCs -- industrial gases used as refrigerator coolants, in 
plastic foams and in aerosols -- are blamed for depleting the 
ozone layer, which filters out the sun's harmful ultraviolet 
rays. 
  Signatories of the Montreal Protocol agreed in November 1992 
to ban the use of CFCs by the end of 1995, four years earlier 
than initially planned. 
  They also agreed to begin regulating consumption of 
alternatives to CFCs, such as hydrochlorofluorocarbons. If the 
law is revised, the use of HCFCs, for instance, will also be 
phased out by around 2030. 
  To prevent CFCs from being emitted into the atmosphere, the 
council proposed that a system be set up that encourages 
recycling and collecting of substances from refrigerators and 
other cooling devices that are presently thrown away as waste. 
  The costs of recycling and collecting should be shared among 
manufacturers, distributors and consumers, the council said. 
  An advisory body to the Ministry of International Trade and 
Industry recommended similar measures last month.

Yamamoto (Manuscript received June 4, 1993); first paragraph 
introductory comment] 
  [Text] This paper describes a knowledge-based system to 
support concurrent design and analysis. The system, DESSIA 
(Design Support System for Integrated Analysis) provides 
designers with information to analyze a problem and obtain 
design outputs by using the expertise accumulated in the system. 
The system combines a knowledge base, engineering database, and 
program library in an object-oriented expert shell. The system 
is flexible and evolutional. Programs and data can be 
registered, maintained, and developed with little labor, thereby 
providing a systematic framework for constructing and developing 
hierarchical databases of programs and data for concurrent 
design and analysis. 
<H5>  1. Introduction </H5>
  The design cycle of complex large-scale structures such as 
aircraft and nuclear plants, and that of missions for space 
stations and space robots usually has an intricate feedback 
structure. For instance, in the case of aircraft the design 
cycle begins with a number of design specifications such as 
payload mass, flight performance, and cost, followed by a 
variety of analyses for factors such as weight, aerodynamics, 
and propulsion. These are generally analyzed by different 
technical groups, which cooperate in numerous discussions based 
on the latest information before finally coming up with a 
feasible design concept. An entire project can no longer be 
evaluated by a single designer. This makes the designers' most 
important task the integration of researcher's expertise, 
usually expressed in the form of technical programs and data, 
into a single refined design concept. This work is called 
concurrent design and analysis. This paper presents a 
knowledge-based system which helps designers to perform 
concurrent design and analysis by accelerating communication 
between designers and researchers. 
  Unfortunately, the current computer environment is 
insufficiently flexible for easy management and integration of 
technical programs and data. Underlying problems hindering 
efficiency fall mainly into two groups. First, integration of 
basic technical knowledge is typically represented by integrated 
engineering programs of different technical groups. For example, 
to analyze flight performance, which is often done in terms of 
flight range and flight time, at least four engineering 
programs--weight analysis, aerodynamics analysis, propulsion 
analysis, and flight performance analysis--must be combined. The 
resulting large, compound program can be used to analyze how a 
change in body structure or engine performance influences flight 
performance. The programs, which are developed independently, 
are too inflexible to be interfaced. Also, once combined into a 
large single program, component programs become very difficult 
to maintain. Second, most engineering programs have a number of 
input and output data items. They are usually scattered, 
redundant, disconnected, and jumbled because of the many 
independent groups involved. This wastes huge amounts of memory. 
Even worse, it becomes very hard to clarify data relationships 
and determine the most appropriate design data from the ocean of 
numerical values involved. All these problems restrict the 
problem-solving and decision-making capabilities of designers in 
the design cycle. 
  The above problems have been known for more than 20 years at 
NASA and the Boeing Aerospace Company, and many systems have 
been constructed in an attempt to overcome 
them[.sup]1)-5)[/]. Historically, the point that determined 
the success of a system was its overall flexibility and 
maintainability. Previous approaches in which programs were 
connected at the source level or through databases, have been 
unsuccessful, mainly because of the inflexible procedural 
control structures in compound programs and the difficulty of 
ensuring consistent maintenance of compound and component 
programs. A few years ago, Boeing Computer Services constructed 
a knowledge-based system, called Expert Executive, in which 
programs are loosely connected through knowledge bases of 
input/output arguments and procedural 
information[.sup]6)-8)[/]. The system reportedly works better 
than its predecessors. However, it focuses mainly on program 
integration and neglects the treatment of massive amounts of 
data and its relation to program integration. 
  This paper describes a knowledge-based system, called DESSIA 
(Design Support System for Integrated Analysis), which solves 
all the above problems. DESSIA is based on the following: 
  1) Concurrent management of programs and data 
  The system separates programs from data as completely as 
possible and constructs different tree structures. The program 
and data trees are interrelated, and their relationship is 
accumulated as interface tables in the knowledge base. The 
purpose of this separation is to enable programs and data to be 
maintained separately and provide a framework for concurrent 
management of programs and data. 
  2) Semiautomatic program integration 
  The system provides macrocommands to form a large-scale 
compound program by combining programs registered in the program 
tree. These commands logically check interface information 
stored as cross references between argument names in the 
knowledge base. Then, these commands semiautomatically determine 
the execution sequence of programs. Programs are not connected 
at the source level. Instead, they are connected through input 
and output argument names contained in the knowledge base. 
  3) Optimization of design parameters 
  The system provides a general purpose optimization method 
for 
design parameters. Using this function, designers can obtain 
optimized design parameters under any constraints. This function 
is based on a nonlinear programming method called the complex 
method. To exploit the advantage of a concurrent design 
environment containing workstations connected through networks, 
this function has been extended to run in a distribution scheme. 
  DESSIA enables comprehensive, synchronized treatment of 
programs and data. The program and data trees evolve 
independently while preserving their flexibility and 
maintainability. At the same time, they are closely 
interconnected through a chain of I/O arguments in the knowledge 
base. 
<H5>  2. Concurrent Management of Programs and Data </H5>
  In many of the so-called general-purpose programs, so many 
items must be selected to reach a function that the user is apt 
to give up before the function is even reached. Item selection 
is embedded in such a program inflexibly, making it essentially 
a closed compound system. These programs may be powerful for 
system use, but procedures are difficult to modify, for example, 
by connecting the system to external programs. This difficulty 
mainly arises because the system does open argument items in an 
interface to other programs. The rationale behind separating 
programs and data is to open up program interfaces and construct 
independent databases for programs and data. 
<H5>  2.1 Interface Table </H5>
  Programs and data are separated as follows. In view of the 
above-mentioned shortcoming in general-purpose programs, a 
program should have only one function. As shown in Fig. 1, all 
program input and output arguments are placed outside, and 
values are read from the input file and then written to an 
output file. The number of I/O files is not limited. We then 
provide an interface table between I/O arguments and files. For 
example, the total weight input argument is specified by an 
input file name and a sequence number in the table. The sequence 
number indicates the position of the total weight input argument 
in the input file. For array data, DESSIA provides a frame for 
which array dimensions are registered. 

<FIG ID=JPRS-JST-015L-39A>      Fig. 1. Interface table between I/O arguments and I/O </FIG>


<H5>  2.2 Program and Data Trees </H5>
  I/O arguments extracted from the program are distributed and 
registered in the categorized data tree (see Fig. 2). If the 
data tree has not grown enough to accommodate all I/O arguments, 
argument items and category blocks can easily be added. The 
aggregation of separated programs constitutes another tree 
structure, called a program tree. 

<FIG ID=JPRS-JST-015L-39B>      Fig. 2. Data tree; categorized I/O arguments. </FIG>

  The values of each argument are accumulated in the data 
tree, 
which maintains the form of each category block. This block of 
actual values is called a category instance in the nomenclature 
of object-oriented paradigms. Note that although programs and 
data are registered separately in their respective trees, they 
are connected through argument names. Values in the data tree 
flow along argument names, passing through the interface table 
to reach program I/O files. 
<H5>  2.3 Effects of Separation </H5>
  The separation has the following effects. Assume that 
several 
programs are registered sequentially in the system (see Fig. 3). 
The owner of program X first looks into the data tree and 
identifies argument items of program X. If the data tree cannot 
manage all the arguments of program X, the owner of program X 
extends the data tree. Finally, program X is registered in an 
appropriate part of the program tree. This procedure is 
repeated. As the number of programs increases, the program tree 
and data tree evolve from a course to fine structure and 
constitute a domain-specific program library and a 
domain-specific engineering database. 

<FIG ID=JPRS-JST-015L-40A>      Fig. 3. Sequential registration of programs and </FIG>


  As programs are registered sequentially, the system 
accumulates program and data interfaces spontaneously through 
the data tree. This means that once program X is registered, the 
data tree can automatically induce connections of I/O arguments 
as shown in Fig. 4. Here, initial connection means that the two 
programs share the same input arguments. Final-initial 
connection means that the output of one of the two programs is 
connected to an input of the other. Of course, the owner of 
program X does not know the structure of these interfaces in 
advance, but the system knows that argument i is 
shared in programs A and X by comparing argument names in the 
interface tables defined for these programs. 

<FIG ID=JPRS-JST-015L-40B>      Fig. 4. Connections of I/O arguments. </FIG>


<H5>  2.4 Concurrency of Program/Data Management </H5>
  A common method of constructing large-scale systems is to 
determine the interfaces between modules by designing the module 
structure of the system from the beginning, and then implement 
each module. This top-down style works quite well when there is 
no ambiguity in the system architecture or in any algorithm. 
However, it usually lacks flexibility in terms of the ability to 
change specifications during implementation. 
  In contrast, DESSIA accumulates each expert's knowledge on 
the program and data trees in terms of domain specific programs 
and data from the bottom up. Experts can easily plug in or 
connect their own original programs and data into DESSIA without 
constraints. Once a program is plugged in, interfaces with other 
plugged-in programs are automatically set up through argument 
tags in a data tree. Experts can concurrently do their own 
design and analysis by using other programs and data in DESSIA. 
The only sequential (as opposed to concurrent) procedure in 
DESSIA is the plug-in procedure. This procedure can only be done 
by one person at a time, because otherwise the data tree would 
lack connection information between argument tags. 
<H5>  3. Compound Analysis </H5>
<H5>  3.1 Construction of a Compound Program </H5>
  One of the "natural" ways to construct a large compound 
program with several component programs is to manually and 
arbitrarily provide interface programs. In contrast, in DESSIA, 
compound programs are obtained by "cutting" unnecessary 
interfaces that are automatically provided by the system. 
  In DESSIA, the integration procedure consists of four steps 
(see Fig. 5). In step 1, the component programs to be integrated 
are selected from the program tree. The system then 
automatically connects these programs through the interface 
information of arguments. Second, in step 2, the sequence 
conditions for program execution are imposed. For example, A &lt; 
B in Fig. 5 means that program A is executed before program B. 
Similarly, * &lt; E means that program E is executed last. These 
sequence conditions automatically cut some of the connections 
between arguments. The resulting integrated diagram may still 
have logical inconsistencies such as internal loops or competent 
connections, which means that several outputs may be connected 
to the same input (see Fig. 5). In step 3, inconsistencies are 
removed from the integrated diagram by cutting unnecessary 
connections. Steps 2 and 3 are iterated alternately, as 
required, to make a complete diagram. In step 4, the system 
decides the execution sequence of component programs by 
following the argument connections in the diagram. The completed 
diagram is saved for later use. Note that the removal of 
inconsistencies in the diagram currently depends entirely on the 
designers' decisions. The system does not automatically 
construct an entire diagram unassisted, but presents materials 
in real time for the designers to evaluate. Hence the 
description "semiautomatic." 

<FIG ID=JPRS-JST-015L-41A>      Fig. 5. Compound analysis in semiautomatic program </FIG>


  Figure 6 shows a program-integration example for the 
analysis 
of aircraft flight performance, in which five component programs 
are selected. The arrows indicate the output to input 
connections of the arguments, and lines without arrows indicate 
the input to input connections of the arguments. We impose the 
sequence condition that the descent performance program is 
executed last; therefore, the output of this program is the 
final descent performance. The system then asks which of the two 
connections is more appropriate for the total weight of the 
descent performance. This is a typical logical inconsistency; 
that is, an example of competent connection. The most probable 
decision of the designer will be that the total weight of the 
ascent performance program is more appropriate because of fuel 
consumption. After cutting either of these connections, we 
finally obtain a consistent diagram. Of course, if different 
conditions are imposed, a different diagram is obtained. When 
connecting the same program more than twice or constructing a 
highly-hierarchical compound program, we adopt a step-by-step 
approach. First, we construct a compound program with different 
component programs based on the procedure mentioned above, and 
regard it as one component program. We then add new or 
previously used component programs to the compound program 
repeatedly. This repetition completes the compound program 
construction we require. 

<FIG ID=JPRS-JST-015L-41B>      Fig. 6. Example of program integration. </FIG>


<H5>  3.2 Management of Compound Data </H5>
  Usually, in an engineering program, it is effective to 
classify input and output arguments based on their semantic 
nature. The effectiveness becomes more evident when dealing with 
programs having a hundred input/output arguments or more (see 
Fig. 7). Each block is called a category block. As mentioned in 
chapter 2, each category block of arguments is distributed and 
embedded in the data tree. This can be done in two ways. One way 
is to make a new category block in the data tree, and then 
register the corresponding arguments. The other is to find a 
corresponding category block from among those already registered 
in the data tree, and then identify each argument with the 
corresponding argument in the category block or add new argument 
items to the category block. 

<FIG ID=JPRS-JST-015L-42A>      Fig. 7. Example of categorization of massive amount of </FIG>


  Actual data for each category block is accumulated in the 
form of a category block replica, called a category instance, in 
the data tree. The total set of input and output data for each 
engineering program can be specified in terms of the combination 
of these category instances. (see Fig. 8). 

<FIG ID=JPRS-JST-015L-42B>      Fig. 8. Combination of category instances. </FIG>


  The categorization avoids redundancy in data. For example, 
if 
we construct a compound program as shown in Fig. 6, the system 
automatically assigns category blocks to each component program, 
with the category instances of "structure" expressing the same 
data in the data tree. Once a compound program is constructed, 
the system retains the connection of programs and the 
combination of category instances that relate to this compound 
program. This enables us to clarify the interrelationship of 
category instances by following the vertical and horizontal 
connections of category instances (see Fig. 9). In Fig. 9, the 
vertical connections correspond to the combination of category 
instances in Fig. 8. 

<FIG ID=JPRS-JST-015L-43A>      Fig. 9. Compound program and related combination of </FIG>


<H5>  4. Optimization of Parameters </H5>
  DESSIA uses an optimization module to provide the minimum or 
maximum values for design parameters such as weight, fuel 
consumption, and cost. 
  Many methods of obtaining the (local) minimum or maximum 
value for a multivariable function have been investigated. These 
methods are classified into two general groups: mathematical 
programming and calculus of variations. These methods are 
further categorized into linear and nonlinear types (see Fig. 
10). The mathematical programming methods include the notable 
Karmarker method[.sup]9)[/], which is linear, and the 
well-known Davidson, Fletcher, Powell (DFP) 
method[.sup]10)[/], which is nonlinear. The calculus of 
variations methods include Kalman's controller design 
formulation[.sup]11)[/]. 

<FIG ID=JPRS-JST-015L-43B>      Fig. 10. Classification of optimization methods. </FIG>


  We decided that the complex mathematical programming 
method[.sup]12)[/] is the most appropriate optimization 
technique for DESSIA because of the following reasons: 
  1) Large-scale systems are, in general, very complicated 
nonlinear objects, and therefore, it might not be possible to 
describe them analytically. 
  2) Usually, to obtain optimal values, a number of 
constraints 
expressed by equality and inequality must be taken into account. 
  3) The evaluation function of optimization is not 
necessarily 
described analytically; therefore, we cannot assume that the 
evaluation function can be differentiated. 
  The complex method can be applied to a very wide range of 
linear and nonlinear systems, both with and without an 
analytical object description. Also, this method can be extended 
to distributed computation under an environment of connected 
workstations. Therefore, the distributed complex method is 
suitable for the environment of concurrent design and analysis. 
<H5>  4.1 Distributed Complex Method </H5>
  Let us consider the following optimization problem: Minimize 
an evaluation function f (x[.sub]1[/], ..., x[.sub]n[/]) 
of n independent variables under the following inequality 
conditions: 

  Using the complex method, the main procedure for the above 
optimization problem is as follows: 
  1) Take n + 1 points in an n-dimensional space. 
  2) Find n + 1 better points from the previous n + 1 points 
by 
calculating the evaluation function at each point. 
  3) Repeat step 2 until the n-dimensional polyhedron 
described 
by the n + 1 points shrinks to a small region. 
  In the complex method, inequality conditions (1) are 
transformed into penalty functions P[.sub]k[/] which take 
the value of 0.0 when conditions (1) are satisfied, otherwise, 
they take a very large positive value. Then, the evaluation 
function f is modified by adding P[.sub]k[/]: 
  S = f + _e_ over k P [.sub]k[/] (2) 
  In the complex method, the modified evaluation function S is 
minimized instead of f. If the maximum of f is needed, the sign 
of f is inverted. The flowchart of the complex method is shown 
in Fig. 11. Each one-dimensional search is carried out by means 
of distributed computation, and the maximum degree of 
distribution is n when the number of independent variables is n. 

<FIG ID=JPRS-JST-015L-44A>      Fig. 11. Flowchart of complex method. </FIG>


<H5>  4.2 Example Calculation </H5>
  We applied the distributed complex method to obtain an 
optimum path for a manipulator of the Experimental Test 
Satellite VII (ETS-VII), which is to be launched in 
1997[.sup]13)-15)[/]. Figure 12 shows a computer graphics 
model of this satellite. The most serious control problem 
regarding the ETS-VII is how to minimize attitude disturbances 
due to manipulator movements so that the communication link is 
not broken. This problem is solved by finding a manipulator path 
which minimizes or locally minimizes attitude disturbances. 

<FIG ID=JPRS-JST-015L-44B>      Fig. 12. ETS-VII concept. </FIG>


  As an evaluation function, we take the maximum of 
feedforward 
angular momentum L[.sub]Wff[/] for the momentum wheels (see 
Fig. 13 for the notation). L[.sub]Wff[/] is given by: 


<FIG ID=JPRS-JST-015L-44C>      Fig. 13. Coordinate definition. </FIG>


  where 
  Q[.sub]x[/] = max (0 ó t ó t[.sub]F[/]) | 
L[.sub]Wffx[/] (t)/M[.sub]x[/] |, 
  Q[.sub]y[/] = max (0 ó t ó t[.sub]F[/]) | 
L[.sub]Wffy[/] (t)/M[.sub]y[/] |, 
  Q[.sub]z[/] = max (0 ó t ó t[.sub]F[/]) | 
L[.sub]Wffz[/] (t)/M[.sub]z[/] |,(5) 
  The constraints are limits for each joint angle: 
  _th_min i ó _th_[.sub]i[/] ó _th_ max i, i = 1, ..., 
6

  The initial inputs for the optimization are the initial and 
final manipulator positions, and the movement time 
t[.sub]F[/]. In general all paths connecting the initial and 
final positions should be checked to obtain the exact optimum 
path. However, we restrict the search region to a feasible path 
set in which each joint is assumed to follow a trapezoidal 
velocity pattern (see Fig. 14). The acceleration time 
t[.sub]Ai[/] and the deceleration time t[.sub]Di[/] are 
independent variables of the complex method. Since the ETS-VII's 
manipulator has 6 degrees of freedom, the maximum distribution 
degree is 2 x 6 = 12. 


<FIG ID=JPRS-JST-015L-45A>      Fig. 14. Joint velocity pattern. </FIG>

  We set the physical parameters of the ETS-VII as follows: 
manipulator mass = 100 kg; manipulator length = 2 m; satellite 
main-body mass = 2 tons; and m[.sub]xx[/] = 5,000 
kgm[.sup]2[/], m[.sub]yy[/] = 2,000 kgm[.sup]2[/], 
m[.sub]zz[/] = 5,000 kgm[.sup]2[/] for the satellite's 
main-body inertia. 
  Table 1 shows the initial inputs for the optimization. The 
initial and final manipulator positions are shown in Fig. 15. 
The result of the optimization is summarized in Table 2. We used 
12 S-4 workstations for the optimization (see section 5.2 for 
details). When the procedures were distributed between 12 
workstations, the computation time was reduced to about 
one-tenth of the time when only one workstation was used. In 
this optimization, there was no delay associated with the 
communication link because only a few bytes of data were 
transmitted through the ethernet cables.

<FIG ID=JPRS-JST-015L-45B>      Fig. 15. Initial path and optimized path </FIG>


  As shown in Fig. 15, the optimized path brings the tip of 
the 
manipulator toward the center of mass of the satellite's main 
body and then curves it away to the final position. This is 
physically reasonable and holds very well in almost any 
situation. 
<H5>  5. Implementation </H5>
<H5>  5.1 System architecture for program/data management </H5>
  Considering the easy realization of the system architecture, 
we have adopted an object-oriented expert shell to implement the 
system. We used ESHELL/X on UTI-LISP developed at Fujitsu to 
implement the first version of DESSIA on a mainframe computer. 
We then converted the system for SPARC stations using the 
commercial expert shell "ART" on Common Lisp. 
  The basic idea of object-oriented systems is to define the 
"object," which is a unit composed of methods and properties, 
and create an algorithm by sending messages between objects. 
There are two levels of objects: class-level objects and 
instance-level objects. Class-level objects can be copied as 
instance-level objects dynamically. In DESSIA, the components of 
the program and data trees are expressed by instance-level 
objects produced by class-level objects, and the interfaces 
between programs and data are represented by "slot values" 
which are ready for the connection. Each time programs and data 
are registered in the system, the corresponding class-level 
objects produce instance objects and append them to the program 
and data trees. 
  Figure 16 shows the class structure for program/data 
management. The classes are categorized into three groups: the 
program manager group, compound program/data manager group, and 
argument manager group. They are further divided into resident 
classes and others. The core of the system currently consists of 
more than 20 class-level objects and about 150 methods. 

<FIG ID=JPRS-JST-015L-46A>      Fig. 16. Class structure for program/data </FIG>


<H5>  5.2 System architecture for distributed complex method </H5>
  In general, there are two methods for distributed 
computation: tightly coupled and loosely coupled. In DESSIA, we 
assume an environment consisting of workstations connected by 
NFS. Therefore the distributed complex method was realized using 
a client/server model with UNIX's IPC (Interprocess 
Communications). Figure 17 shows the concept of the distributed 
computer environment for DESSIA. The manager host is the 
workstation which manages the local host workstations. A local 
host is a workstation which runs a distributed process. The 
terminal host is the workstation used to enter DESSIA and define 
an optimization calculation. In general, the manager host and 
terminal hosts also function as local hosts. Also, any local 
host can become a terminal host for a different user. 

<FIG ID=JPRS-JST-015L-46B>      Fig. 17. Client/server model for optimization in </FIG>


  The design specifications for the distributed complex method 
are as follows: 
  1) M processes can be distributed between N local hosts. (M 
can be greater than N in general). 
  2) Users can register other workstations as local hosts. 
  3) Users can easily register optimization modules at any 
terminal host using the `plug-in' procedure of DESSIA. 
  4) Program/data management in DESSIA can be done on any 
terminal host, and the concurrency of program/data editing is 
handled by the manager host. 
  Based on these specifications, we realized the following 
client/server processes: 
  1) Host Manager (HM): a server process that runs on the 
manager host. 
  2) Local Host Manager (LHM): a server process that runs on 
each local host and is activated by HM. 
  3) Prototype Process Manager (PPM): a server process that 
runs on the manager host and managing PPs and is activated by HM. 
  4) Prototype Process (PP): an object process that runs on 
each local host and is activated by LHM. 
  5) Process (P): a process that runs on each local host, 
executes an actual distributed object, and is activated by PP. 
  6) Client Process (CP): a client process that runs on the 
terminal host and is primarily activated by a user as required. 
  Initially, DESSIA is awakened on the manager host by a user. 
Then, HM is activated on the manager host and LHM is activated 
on each local host. HM and the LHMs then wait for a message from 
a terminal-host's client process. A user then enters DESSIA at a 
terminal host and wakes up a client process, which then does the 
following: 
  1) Asks HM to wake up PPM and PPs through the LHMs. 
  2) Asks PPM to set the initial inputs for each PP. 
  3) Asks each PP to wake up Ps. (The total number of Ps is 
M.). 
  4) Waits for a computed result from each P. 
  5) Releases the finished Ps. 
  We assume that all terminals and local workstations have the 
same versions of OS and libraries. If the versions are not the 
same, execution modules for the complex method must be 
recompiled beforehand at a local workstation. 
<H5>  6. Conclusion </H5>
  We have analyzed some of the problems in the computer 
environment surrounding designers whose role is to integrate the 
programs and data that express the expertise of researchers. We 
have developed a knowledge-based system to support these 
designers. 
  This system is evolutional. As the programs and data are 
registered, the program and data trees in the knowledge base 
become proportionally larger. Combining programs in the program 
tree enables a large-scale compound program to be built without 
programming. The resultant execution data is arranged in the 
data tree, which can be regarded as an engineering database 
interconnected with a chain of I/O arguments. 
  We introduced the complex method into DESSIA as an 
optimization tool to obtain the maximum or minimum of any 
nonlinear function. We extended this method into a distributed 
complex method to suit the network environment. Preliminary 
experiments showed that the distributed complex method reduced 
the computation time almost in proportion to the number of 
workstations. 
  Improvements planned for the near future include: 
  1) Implementation by C[.sup]++[/] 
  In view of the current trend for object-oriented 
programming, 
implementation by C[.sup]++[/] instead of a Lisp-based expert 
shell will provide more flexibility and compatibility. 
  2) Scheduling of distributed computation 
  Computation efficiency will be improved by scheduling the 
degree of distribution based on the workstations' CPU power and 
occupancy. 
  3) Graphical human-machine interface 
  A flexible graphical HMI such as GUI Builder will make it 
relatively easy to construct large-scale compound programs on 
DESSIA, as shown in Fig. 18.

  [Text] Equipment assembly factories have to consider the 
design and construction of efficient manufacturing and assembly 
lines, and complete work management from the early stages of 
production. 
  This expert system serves as a support tool for use in 
dealing with these issues, and can quickly and easily prepare 
basic manufacturing data for work management, such as assembly 
work sheets and standard-time tables, in the production 
preparation stage before the start of manufacture. 
<H5>  1. Introduction </H5>
  Fujitsu is a data-processing and communications equipment 
manufacturer with a wide range of products--from integrated 
circuits and semi-conductor products to large computers and 
communications equipment. Over the last few years, Fujitsu's 
product line-up has been expanded to include items such as 
personal computers and workstations. This expansion reflects the 
trend toward downsizing in computers, and, as a result, has 
greatly changed the production environment. In addition, product 
life cycles are becoming shorter and design changes are 
occurring more frequently. This is because, until recently, the 
main users of computers have been companies, but the market is 
now shifting toward individuals, whose tastes are more likely to 
change. These factors are making demand forecasting more and 
more difficult. Furthermore, conventional methods are 
insufficient for managing factories successfully. 
<H5>  2. Issues of Assembly Factories </H5>
  Given the above situation, the most important issues facing 
assembly factories are the design and construction of the most 
suitable manufacturing line, total work management, and 
production stability from the start of mass production. Figure 1 
shows the relationship between product life cycle and 
production. The dotted lines indicate the relationship curves of 
conventional products, and the solid lines indicate those of new 
personal products. For conventional products, the flow of the 
manufacturing line is checked for any problems after production 
has started and the standard time is estimated using industrial 
engineering (IE) techniques, such as the stopwatch method, after 
production stabilizes. A work is managed and upgraded based on 
the standard time to facilitate cost reduction. This procedure 
is inappropriate for new products, however, because even if the 
standard time is estimated the production model may change 
before proper management can be applied. In this state, the 
management accuracy gradually deteriorates, and, if no measures 
are taken, a work may eventually be left to operators at the 
factory and carried out without management. 

<FIG ID=JPRS-JST-015L-48A>      Fig. 1. Changes in production environment. </FIG>


  To cope with the above problems, manufacturing standards for 
work management must be established in the production 
preparation stage before the start of manufacture. As shown in 
Fig. 2, the basic data consists of design criteria such as work 
and the standard time, and is used widely in product design, 
planning and estimation. 

<FIG ID=JPRS-JST-015L-49A>      Fig. 2. Uses of basic data. </FIG>


  However, estimating the standard time brings about the 
problems shown in Fig. 3. Fujitsu has therefore developed a new 
expert tool for IE that tackles these problems. The new tool 
uses both conventional IE techniques and artificial intelligence 
(AI) so that work can be managed at the same level as for 
conventional products even in a complicated production 
environment. 

<FIG ID=JPRS-JST-015L-49B>      Fig. 3. Current problems in estimating the standard time </FIG>


  This paper presents the new system in detail. 
<H5>  3. Aims in Development </H5>
  During our study of system implementation we set the 
following development goals to solve the above-mentioned 
problems: 
  1) Time 
  The system enables production preparations to be made before 
the start of production. 
  2) Speed 
  The system can quickly process data on new products and 
products whose design has changed. 
  3) Consistency 
  The system enables any supervisor, manufacturing engineer, 
or 
designer to estimate and use standard time consistently. 
  4) Generality and adaptability 
  The system can be used by divisions dealing with different 
products, and is adaptable to changing conditions. 
  Details of the system are presented below. 
<H5>  4. System Outline </H5>
<H5>  4.1 System Features </H5>
  As shown in the system outline in Fig. 4, the new system 
uses 
a Fujitsu FM-R personal computer, and automatically creates 
product assembly flowcharts and estimates the standard time 
based on the component data input from the engineering database. 
This system is called the standard-time estimating expert 
system, or STEIN. 
  STEIN has the following features: 
  1) Can be linked with CAD 
  2) Adaptable, and allows manufacturing expertise to be 
stored 
in databases 
  3) Enables creation of the basic data 
  4) Has a wide range of applications and is easy to use. 
  With the first feature, data entry by the operator is 
minimized through the use of component data created by CAD, such 
as part names and drawing numbers included in design 
information, and the equipment assembly sequence produced by the 
designer. In addition, parts data can be processed in the 
trial-manufacture stage, where the parts data is made complete, 
and design changes reflected quickly. 

<FIG ID=JPRS-JST-015L-50A>      Fig. 4. System outline. </FIG>


  The second feature means that the expertise on manufacture 
possessed by manufacturing engineers and technicians is stored 
in the knowledge database in the form of rules and tables, so 
expertise can be added or updated easily and the system can be 
reorganized to meet user specifications. 
  The third feature is a database containing data in a 
standardized format called "basic data," which has been 
established for use in a wide range of applications. 
  The fourth feature comes from the system's modular 
structure, 
which minimizes the modification required for manipulating parts 
data and specifications peculiar to the user. Moreover, the 
system uses a mouse as an input device to prevent operation 
errors and to improve operability in processing jobs. 
<H5>  4.3 System Module Configuration </H5>
  Figure 5 shows the system module configuration. STEIN 
consists of the main module, which performs work analysis and 
standard-time estimation and six other modules. 

<FIG ID=JPRS-JST-015L-50B>      Fig. 5. System module configuration. </FIG>


  Among the six modules, data conversion (STEIN _P_), data 
editing (STEIN _P_ and STEIN _g_), manufacturing base data 
conversion (STEIN _t_), and matching (STEIN _ch_) are the 
preprocessing modules of the system. If the format of the parts 
data prepared by the user differs from the basic data format 
when the system is installed, the format conversion section in 
STEIN _P_ can be modified so that the data can be input easily 
into the system. CAD might not be used by all the design 
departments of each user. For a department not using CAD, the 
system can be operated by creating an input file using a 
data-editing module (STEIN _P_ or STEIN _g_). 
  If design changes are made frequently, using STEIN _ch_ 
enables a previous version of data for which conditions have 
already been established to be used in a new data which doesn't 
estimate standard times and work conditions, thus allowing the 
design changes to be reflected quickly. Figure 6 shows the 
system operating environment. 

<FIG ID=JPRS-JST-015L-50C>      Fig. 6. System operating environment. </FIG>


  In addition to the FM-R mentioned earlier, at least 8 Mbytes 
of RAM, a hard drive with a minimum storage capacity of 40 
Mbytes, a mouse, and a printer are required. 
  The required software includes the MS-DOS[.sup]TM[/] 
operating system, the GCLISP language, and the expert system 
construction support tool ESHEEL/FM. If data is exchanged with a 
higher-level system, an emulator board and emulation software 
are also required. 
<H5>  4.3 Work Analysis and Standard-Time Estimation (STEIN </H5>
_a_) 
  Figure 7 shows the processing steps for routing and 
standard-time estimation. The knowledge databases required for 
routing and standard-time estimation are the database for work 
analysis (knowledge 1) and that for standard-time estimation 
(knowledge 2). Knowledge is discussed in detail in section 4.4. 

<FIG ID=JPRS-JST-015L-51A>      Fig. 7. Processing steps. </FIG>


  First, component data is read. Then, the hierarchical 
structure of the equipment configuration is structured without 
alteration, and the results are converted into data grouped into 
frames. 
  Figure 8 shows the data grouped into frames. Grouping data 
into frames enables the data to be connected by a semantic 
network, which facilitates the retrieval of necessary 
information and structure-related changes. 

<FIG ID=JPRS-JST-015L-51B>      Fig. 8. Data grouped into frames. </FIG>


  For each component, knowledge 1 prepares information such as 
the component classification shown in Fig. 9 based on the 
component name and drawing number. Classifying components 
entails grouping them into aggregates for the determination of 
their characteristics and attributes. Components are put into 
groups, such as a group of components for fastening a certain 
component or a group of components to be mounted in the first or 
last work, so that the work to be done can be easily determined. 

<FIG ID=JPRS-JST-015L-52A>      Fig. 9. Component classifications. </FIG>


  Consider the classification shown in Fig. 9 as an example. 
If 
the names of components contain the word "screw," all those 
components are classified as being screw components and 
fastening components. Then, routing is done according to the 
rules about the component-mounting order included in knowledge 
1. As shown in Fig. 10, if the rules specify that the screw is 
the component to fasten the immediately preceding component, 
namely the metal fitting, and that a stick-on component called a 
label must be used in the last work, the mounting order is 
determined and work is done for each component. Once routing is 
completed, each work step is assigned a work item name based on 
the work item names defined in knowledge 2 and the rules 
provided in knowledge 1. 
&lt;graphic&gt; 

<FIG ID=JPRS-JST-015L-52B>      Fig. 10. Process determination and work item name </FIG>


  In the example shown in Fig. 10, the work step that involves 
the component classified as being a metal-fitting component and 
the component classified as being a screw component is 
automatically assigned the work item name, metal-fitting 
mounting. Lastly, the standard time is estimated for each work 
item. In this step, the working conditions for estimating the 
standard time, such as the distance the components are moved, 
the weight of the components, and the tool used, are determined 
based on knowledge 1, and the time values are calculated from 
expressions defined in knowledge 2. If working conditions have 
not been determined according to the rules provided in knowledge 
1, manual alteration is required. 
  STEIN _a_ has an alteration function that enables 
error-free 
alterations to be made easily. Figure 11 shows the screen for 
editing the work, and Fig. 12 shows the screen for editing the 
working conditions. Most editing operations can be performed 
using the mouse. In the editing of work, work item names can be 
changed and added, and the order of work steps can be changed. 
The operator selects the appropriate function key command menu, 
then specifies the work item to be changed with the mouse. All 
operations are performed interactively as instructed by 
messages. In the editing of working conditions, the working 
conditions and set values registered in the time estimation 
table provided in the knowledge for standard-time calculation 
are displayed. If a set value differs from the corresponding 
actual value, the operator corrects the set value. Selection is 
performed by selecting choices at the bottom of the screen with 
the mouse. Operations are very simple, and can be mastered 
quickly. The assembly flowchart, shown in Fig. 13, is explained 
below. 

<FIG ID=JPRS-JST-015L-52C>      Fig. 11. Screen for editing work. </FIG>



<FIG ID=JPRS-JST-015L-52D>      Fig. 12. Screen for editing working conditions. </FIG>


<FIG ID=JPRS-JST-015L-53A>      Fig. 13. Printed output. </FIG>



  Print processing outputs component assembly flowcharts 
showing component names, drawing numbers, quantities, work 
items, and the standard time. If notes or memorandums on a 
component or work step are entered on the screen shown in Fig. 
11, the entered information is also printed in the flowchart. A 
version management list showing the version numbers of data and 
knowledge databases in the system is also printed out. This list 
enables engineers to manage processing results version by 
version. 
<H5>  4.4 Knowledge Editing (STEIN _O_) </H5>
  Knowledge maintenance is important for the operation of 
expert systems. It is inadvisable to edit knowledge frequently 
after system operation has started. Therefore, knowledge must be 
fully extracted and incorporated into the system before system 
operation is started. Even if sufficient knowledge is extracted 
and incorporated in advance, however, the system cannot remain 
complete forever. Changes in knowledge often occur in the early 
stages of system operation, and still occur after operation has 
stabilized. For this reason, it is more efficient to improve the 
quality of knowledge while the system is being used. In this 
case, knowledge is changed after the user starts operation, so 
the user must be able to edit knowledge without modifying the 
system during operation. The STEIN _O_ module is provided so 
that knowledge can be edited easily through an improved 
human-machine interface (HMI). This module has the following 
features: 
  1) Experts can edit their expertise into easily 
understandable information because all knowledge is expressed in 
Japanese sentences, and no expertise on artificial intelligence 
is required for editing. 
  2) Changes in knowledge are reflected in the system 
immediately. 
  3) The module has a print function that can print knowledge 
in a form that enables the printed output to be filed 
immediately and a function that automatically checks knowledge. 
These functions facilitate the checking of knowledge and ensure 
correct editing of rules. 
  Details of knowledge editing are explained below. 

<FIG ID=JPRS-JST-015L-53B></FIG>


<H5>         4.4.1 Knowledge for Work Analysis </H5>
  Knowledge is organized in the hierarchical structure shown 
in 
Fig. 14, and classified and arranged in four categories: 
knowledge for component information specification, knowledge for 
process information specification, knowledge for work item 
specification and knowledge for working condition specification. 
Each type of knowledge is defined in the IF ... 
THEN[.sup]1)[/] format in Japanese. 
  1) Knowledge for component information specification. 
  This type of knowledge is used to classify components, 
change 
component names, or specify information about components such as 
component size. Examples of this type of knowledge are "if the 
name of a component contains the word connector, then the 
classification of that component is connector," and "if the 
component classification is screw, then read the screw length 
from the drawing and set the read data." 
  2) Knowledge for process information specification 
  If a screw is tightened on a unit during assembly work, that 
unit and screw are used in a single work step. Knowledge for 
assembly sequence editing is used to identify work steps and 
group components for each step. An example of this kind of 
knowledge is "if the classification of the component is screw 
and the classification of the preceding component is unit, then 
these components are used in the same work step." 
  3) Knowledge for work item specification 
  This type of knowledge is used to specify necessary work 
items based on the information about components grouped on a 
step basis. An example of this type of knowledge is "the work 
item of a work step involving a connector and screws is 
connector mounting, and a connector connection work is added." 
With this type of knowledge, as many work items as required can 
be specified for each work step. Notes on work can also be 
specified; for instance, "The work item of a work step involving 
only connectors is connector connection. The memorandum on the 
work is `connect the connector in correct direction'." 
  4) Knowledge for working condition specification 
  When the standard time is estimated using a time estimation 
table, working conditions are defined as work state variables. 
This type of knowledge is used to adjust working conditions to 
reflect the actual state. Examples of this type of knowledge are 
"the working condition `number of screws' is the value of the 
`quantity' of a component of which component classification is 
screw" and "if the component classification is power unit, the 
working condition `component weight' is `considerably heavy'." 
Basic information required for specifying working conditions can 
be copied automatically from any place in the work information 
area. 
<H5>  4.4.2 Knowledge for Standard-Time Calculation </H5>
  To calculate the standard time for each activity shown in an 
assembly flowchart, the time estimation table is required. Work 
is defined as a combination of several work elements. Work 
elements[.sup]2)[/] are the basic unit of work; they cannot 
be further subdivided. Defining work as a combination of work 
elements simplifies and ensures the maintenance and management 
of work items. Because work elements are used commonly in 
various types of work, working conditions are defined so that a 
certain degree of generality is kept, and work elements are 
defined by expressions having the defined working conditions as 
variables. A working condition is defined as a pair: a choice 
and its corresponding time value. 

<FIG ID=JPRS-JST-015L-54A>      Fig. 15. Organization of standard-time calculation </FIG>


  As shown in Fig. 15, knowledge for standard-time calculation 
is organized in a three-level structure: work item, work 
element, and working condition. For example, the work called 
mounting consists of three work elements: component pickup, 
component setting, and screw tightening. Each work element is 
further defined using working conditions such as component 
pickup area and component weight. In the example of mounting 
work shown in Fig. 16, the standard time is calculated as 
described below. 

<FIG ID=JPRS-JST-015L-54B>      Fig. 16. Example of mounting. </FIG>


  First, working conditions are specified for each work 
element. Examples are shown below. 
  Component pickup area = component shelf (1), 
  Component weight = less than 1 kg (0), 
  Unpacking = none (0), 
  Number of insertions = 1 (1), 
  Concurrent work = none (0), 
  The number in parentheses is the value corresponding to the 
choice selected as the working condition. 
  The time value for each work element is as follows: 
  Component pickup = 0.004 
  X component pickup area 
  X component pickup area + 0.004 
  X component weight + 0.0555 
  X unpacking + 0.016 = 0.02. 
  Component setting = 0.01 
  X number of insertions + 0.01 
  X concurrent work + ... = 0.08, 
  Screw tightening = ... = 0.344. 
  The standard time value for the mounting work is then 
calculated from the following expression: 
  (Component pickup + component setting + screw tightening) X 
number of components = 0.888 (minute) 
  This hierarchical structure simplifies work specification 
and 
enables the time estimation table to be edited easily. 
<H5>  4.4.3 Operating Procedure </H5>
  This subsection describes how to edit knowledge. Figure 17 
shows the screen for editing work item information. Every 
operation can be performed using the mouse. If the user 
specifies the data to be changed with the mouse, the necessary 
choices are displayed in the selection field at the bottom of 
the screen. The user then selects a choice with the mouse. If 
input from the keyboard is required, this request is displayed 
in the selection area at the bottom of the screen. 

<FIG ID=JPRS-JST-015L-55A>      Fig. 17. Screen for editing work item Fig. 18. Screen for editing knowledge for standard-time </FIG>


  Figure 18 shows the screen for editing knowledge for 
standard-time calculation. The system always grasps the linkage 
relationship between work items, work elements, and working 
conditions. Therefore, the user does not have to remember that 
relationship and merely needs to make required changes. The 
system has a function for printing knowledge for work analysis 
and standard-time calculation in an easily readable layout on 
A4-size paper. These functions ensure correct editing. 

<FIG ID=JPRS-JST-015L-55B>      Fig. 18. Screen for editing knowledge for standard-time </FIG>


  The program for editing the time estimation table can be 
activated as a separate system. If the editing program is 
installed in a laptop computer, the user can edit the time 
estimation table while measuring work at the factory and can 
input editing results immediately to STEIN _a_ for execution. 
Thus, people who know nothing about programs can edit knowledge. 
<H5>  5. Improved Efficiency </H5>
  Using STEIN[.sup]3)[/] greatly improves the efficiency of 
process design and standard-time estimation. Figure 19 shows a 
comparison of the processing time required when a manufacturing 
engineer did routing and estimated the standard time in the 
conventional way (that is, based on actual measurements and 
drawings), and when he used STEIN. A total processing time of 
one year has been estimated for both cases based on the time 
required for routing, the standard-time estimation for a new 
model and the time required because of design changes, and the 
estimated total processing time for both cases has been 
compared. If the time required for processing in the 
conventional way is expressed as 100 percent, the time required 
to perform processing with STEIN is 20 percent, or only 
one-fifth. The new system can not only improve the working 
efficiency, but can also immediately update already estimated 
standard times whenever necessary and improve the accuracy of 
time values. 

<FIG ID=JPRS-JST-015L-56A>      Fig. 19. Improvement in working efficiency. </FIG>


<H5>  6. Conclusion </H5>
  With the new system, STEIN, we were able to quickly prepare 
basic data necessary for managing an equipment assembly factory, 
and achieved our original goals. 
  We have also developed another application based on STEIN, 
which is capable of determining the most suitable work sequence 
for a factory line. This application is now ready for use. 
Future work includes the development of a system that uses the 
technology applied to distributed processing performed in a 
network, uses shared basic information more effectively, and is 
linked with a planning system such as a scheduling system or a 
component delivery planning system. 
  In the manufacturing sector, the use of computer-integrated 
manufacturing (CIM) is becoming increasingly widespread. Some of 
the problems inherent in this technology have been solved, but 
many problems including unsuccessful transfer of expertise on 
manufacturing, still remain. Even when a factory is built with 
CIM, the factory cannot be expected to expand production without 
further human effort. The goal is to create a production system 
that can be supported and operated by experts posted at 
important points. We firmly believe that STEIN can support CIM 
and further develop into a vital tool for assisting these 
experts.

  [Text] AIST's National Institute of Bioscience and Human 
Technology (NIBH) has developed a CAD (computer-aided design) 
system incorporating virtual reality. This makes it possible to 
design transformation of a material on the computer with the 
feeling of doing workmanship in clay. It is now easy to design 
products with subtle curves for which previously models had to 
be built. 
  The newly-developed system includes a manipulator maneuvered 
by a person, a computer, and a monitor that shows virtual space. 
The manipulator can move lengthwise, sideways, or in height in 
addition to rotating. It has six degrees of freedom and moves 
throughout three-dimensional space. 
  The grasp of the manipulator is moved on the screen by the 
cursor. It can be maneuvered on the screen just like pushing 
clay with a scoop. The sense of resistance and the 
transformation of the virtual material can freely be regulated. 
  A rapid calculation algorithm (direct deformation 
manipulation method or DDM) to directly and smoothly change the 
place touched by the cursor was developed for transforming the 
virtual material. It succeeds in reflecting changes on the 
screen as the manipulator moves. 
  Automotive steering wheel, body and other products are often 
made with a combination of subtle curves which are finely 
altered in ways unseen to the eye. They have needed models 
remade and checked by hand. It has also taken time to design 
parts such as helicopter rotors which have complex curves. This 
new system will help simplify this kind of design.

  [Text] AIST's Government Industrial Research Institute, 
Osaka ([GIRIO] Reikichi Iwamoto, chief) has developed a 
micro-actuator (drive apparatus), a bonding of metal to the 
surface of high polymer electrolyte film which can bend and 
rotate in response to a one-volt signal and move in a way 
similar to that of living muscle in terms of cilia movement, 
undulation, and so on. Its structure is simple. Since it can 
easily be made only some ten microns in size, it appears that it 
can be used as medical micromachines, for example, micro-pumps 
or micro-robots. 
  Until recently high polymer actuator development tested only 
the use of swelling high polymer gel, but that had the drawback 
of slow response time. Moreover, it was difficult to use in a 
living body because high voltage was needed to drive it with a 
signal and hydrogen gas would be given off by electrolysis in 
bodily fluids. 
  In 1992 GIRIO chemically plated silver onto fluorine resin 
ion exchange film and ascertained that when electricity was sent 
along a lead line attached to both sides of the film, the film 
was driven by low voltage. Later research on its functions 
confirmed it: it was several tens of microns small, it moved on 
low voltage, there were no emissions of gas due to electrolysis, 
it moved freely at low to high speeds, varying with frequency of 
1-100 Hz, and it showed responsiveness similar to living muscle. 
Its endurance was confirmed in experiments which showed stable 
behavior for more than two months, including usage more than 5 
million times. 
  Revolution and bending should be possible using these 
functions. If it can be made to move like a fin it can be used 
as a micro-pump inside the body or as the propeller for a 
micro-robot swimming through bodily fluids. "It can probably be 
used soon for opening or closing valves or as a micro-valve or 
artificial pancreas-type liquid drug release control," said 
Keisuke Oguro, chief of GIRIO's energy and environmental 
materials division. The movement of the actuator is influenced 
by ions in the solution and type of electrode metal, so it is 
possible to design actuators that have different movement 
functions by altering these conditions.

<F P=106> [Interview with president of IRE-POLUS Company] </F>
  [Text] 
<H5>  Introduction </H5>
  The attention received by Russian lasers at INTEROPT '93 is 
fresh in our memory. Recently Valentin P. Gaponchev, president 
of the Russian laser manufacturer IRE-POLUS, visited Japan and 
spoke with our editors about the history and present status of 
laser research in Russia and about his company's business 
strategy. 
  OPTRONICS: Tell us about the history of laser 
research in Russia. 
  Gaponchev: Laser research in Russia began about 
the same time it did in the U.S. Many kinds of research were 
conducted beginning in the early 1960s by scientists at 
universities, government research institutes, and businesses. 
Until about 10 years ago we obtained many outstanding results 
and possessed very advanced technology, but hardly any of that 
information was conveyed to Western nations. The fact was that 
strict secrecy was maintained in the country, and even our own 
researchers did not know what other Soviet researchers were 
doing in detail. 
  For example, researchers at my company developed a 100 kW 
class YAG laser 10 years ago, and I myself developed the 
phosphite glass used in glass lasers in 1969. Furthermore, eight 
years ago we had already developed a Q-switched Cr:YAG laser 
used in range finders, etc., with better performance than those 
used by Western companies today. 
  At that time 200-300 large companies, and it becomes a vast 
number if we include all the small companies, were involved in 
laser research. Research on laser technology was also heavily 
emphasized at universities and government research institutes. 
There were a lot of laboratories doing research on solid state 
lasers, but only a few were working with semiconductor lasers. 
Furthermore, all this R&amp;D was essentially for military use, 
and 
no thought was given to converting lasers to civilian use. 
  OPTRONICS: What is the present status of laser 
research? 
  Gaponchev: Researchers are suffering from monetary 
problems because beginning last year government research 
spending, especially military spending, was cut considerably. 
Because government funding was determined in the past by the 
size of the organization and number of people employed rather 
than the content of the research, the major research 
organizations hired more and more people in their desire for 
funding. Actually, however, about 90 percent of the personnel 
were unnecessary, and those conducting research accounted for 
only about 10 percent of the total, so there were only a few 
researchers in the true sense of the word. 
  The way for our scientists to survive from now on will be to 
jump feet first into the free market economy on their own and 
actually compete with Western products. We can't expect that 
kind of change from large companies, however. The fact is that 
they are not investing capital in developing new technology. 
Almost all their money is used to pay researchers' salaries, so 
research is not adequately funded. 
  Therefore, from a practical standpoint, the most effective 
solution is to start a new company and assemble researchers. 
Government funds will just be wasted if they are sent to places 
operating under the old system, so they are now being directed 
to new companies instead. 
  These past few years more than 100,000 companies have 
requested government funding to carry out high-tech development, 
and in laser-related fields there are more than 1,000 companies 
requesting startup funds. However, almost all of them are just 
companies on paper and all they really want is government funds. 
They are insipid companies that merely want to sell the 
technology that the nation has already developed. As far as I 
know, only about 10 companies at most are actually developing 
commercial products. 
  Almost all the companies involved with lasers were 
established by groups from departments in government research 
organizations. Their product lines are small, so they do not 
receive funding from the government, and it is difficult for 
them to develop new products. 
  Our best human resources, technology, and equipment are 
leaking away into foreign countries. The companies that remain 
have already lost competitive strength, and that puts Russian 
companies in a dangerous fix. There is a small number of 
companies, however, that are investing in new equipment, and in 
fact, some strong companies are emerging. IRE-POLUS is one of 
those companies. 
  OPTRONICS: Tell us the history of IRE-POLUS. 
  Gaponchev: IRE-POLUS was established in 1990 by 
the merger of two groups of scientists. One of them was the IRE 
group, where I was conducting research on laser materials. The 
other was a group from POLUS, one of Russia's leading solid 
state laser research organizations, and is led by Alexander 
Chestakov. 
  Our researchers and their friends supplied 89 percent of the 
capital, and the remaining 11 percent came from the government. 
Because only a small amount of our capital is from the 
government, we can do research, development and sales with 
almost complete freedom. Our capital was originally about 
$2,000, but now we have about $20,000,000, and we have invested 
about $15,000,000 of that money in new technology such as 
equipment and facilities. Over the past three years we have 
reinvested 90-95 percent of our profits in new technology. These 
investments are for the development of high quality items to 
meet our unique specifications such as the materials and optical 
parts necessary to develop laser equipment. 
  Our goal is to develop new solid state lasers and systems. 
We 
plan to proceed with development to the prototype and 
small-volume mass production level in response to the market, 
and if the market demands a large quantity of our products, we 
will license the manufacturing out to Western companies. We 
started with a staff of 27, and now we have about 250 people 
working for us with about 50 Ph.D's. 
  OPTRONICS: Tell us something about your products. 
  Gaponchev: For example, our Er:fiber amplifier has 
a high output of 150 mW and is very compact. Right now we are 
developing a 500 mW model, and we have achieved oscillation at 
the experimental level. 
  Our Er:fiber laser has a high output of 200 mW and uses 
direct diode excitation. We have finished development of a 500 
mW prototype. We have also developed green and blue lasers that 
employ nonlinear optic crystals and up-conversion for use at 
wavelengths of 1.5 æm and at 1 æm with Nd, Yb, etc. We 
have 
developed fiber lasers in the 20-30 W class and in the future we 
expect output of several hundred W. Compared with lamp and diode 
excitation formats, our lasers are compact, highly efficient, 
low in cost, and do not require cooling, so we expect 
applications for them in industry and medical therapy. 
  Our Nd:YAG lasers have achieved high outputs of up to 3 kW, 
and we also manufacture a single mode type. Our 1.5 kW class 
laser has a compact resonator of about 40 cm, and our single 
mode type has an efficiency almost as good as multimode types. 
  We still have to address problems with the power source and 
chiller, however. Because there are no good suppliers in Russia, 
and we have not developed these items in-house, we want to do 
business with a reputable manufacturer from a Western nation. 
  We are also working hard on tunable lasers such as the 
Ti:sapphire laser. We started with high quality crystals and 
proceeded with development of green Nd:YAG lasers. We have 
completed development of a green laser with an output of 10 W CW 
and 30 W Q-switched. In addition, we have developed a Cr:YAG 
laser that can cover the range from 1.35 æm to 1.6 æm, 
and a 
diode pump Yb:fiber laser capable of continuous variation from 
1.04 æm to 1.18 æm. We are now building prototypes of 
both. 
  We are also working on development of Ho:YAG lasers and 
Er:YAG lasers for medical equipment. These perform as well as 
the most advanced lasers in Western nations, and we have begun 
our activities in this field by setting the prices low enough 
that they can be used in medicine and establishing a subsidiary 
for dedicated sales. 
  OPTRONICS: What about semiconductor lasers? 
  Gaponchev: We are thinking of developing 
semiconductor lasers for excitation purposes. We have developed 
semiconductor lasers for the fiber lasers, and we hope to become 
as strong in the field as Western semiconductor laser 
manufacturers. 
  We are also working on the development of E/O and A/O 
devices 
and fiber sensors. Our fiber thermometers are compact, have a 
precision of +/- 0.01ëC, a range of -50 to +150ëC, and 
their cost is about the same as high precision thermocouple 
thermometers. The catheter internal insertion type with a 200 
æm sensor head can be used to control temperatures in heat 
therapy for cancer. The cost will be only one-tenth those made 
in the U.S., and we are looking for companies in Japan and 
elsewhere to do mass production. 
  Another item we are working on is the fiber gyro, and we 
want 
to form a partnership with a Japanese company for manufacture 
and sales. As far as price is concerned, we have supplied them 
for communications satellite attitude control for about $1,000, 
and we expect they will run about $100 for use in automobiles. 
  OPTRONICS: Low prices are your strength, but do 
you expect them to stay that way? 
  Gaponchev: I think there are two reasons why 
products from the old communist bloc were inexpensive. The first 
is that their performance was inferior to products from the 
West. The second is that their initial cost was extremely low 
because they came out of government research institutes. 
Therefore, it was possible to price them low and make a good 
profit. 
  However, when we think about supplying stable quality and 
performance and establishing a service system, the market prices 
of Russian lasers will probably approach those from the rest of 
the world before too long. It is true that in the past there was 
a major price difference because material and labor costs were 
low, but the gap with the West has been steadily closing. 
Because the prices of Russian products are rising, there may be 
cases in the future where it will be less expensive to buy 
something made in the West. 
  Actually, the price of metal has gone up 30 times already 
this year. The frames for our equipment that we used to make for 
$200-$300 now cost 10 times more, and the cost of manufacturing 
an Nd:YAG rod has jumped from $50 last year to about $200 today. 
  OPTRONICS: What was the purpose of your visit to 
Japan? 
  Gaponchev: I visited at the invitation of TEM for 
installing laser equipment and strengthening our cooperative 
relationship. At the same time I wanted to sound out the 
possibilities for joint ventures with Japanese companies and 
having them provide OEM. Right now our main market is Europe, 
then the U.S. We have subsidiaries in both places. As far as the 
Japanese market is concerned, there are still a lot of unknowns, 
but we would definitely like to enter it. 
  It is true that the situation in Russia today is unstable. 
Inflation is out of control, the interest rates at lending 
institutions are very high, and there is a limit to how much we 
can borrow. Therefore, we have high hopes for financial aid and 
support from Western nations. Unfortunately, it is my impression 
that Japanese companies are not very eager to invest. Contrast 
that with China. China is building its own plants for 
development and manufacturing based on Russian technology, and 
it looks like their purpose is for military use. 
  OPTRONICS: Thank you very much for speaking with 
us.

  [Text] The heavy particle beam accelerator is expected to 
become a new trump card in the fight against cancer. One such 
device has been installed at the National Institute of 
Radiological Sciences (NIRS) and preparations are underway for 
it to begin operation next year. Four main contractors, 
Mitsubishi Electric Corporation, Hitachi, Toshiba, and Sumitomo 
Heavy Industries, plus 150 subcontractors have been working on 
development of the accelerator for nearly 10 years [sic] since 
1988. The accelerator was formally presented to NIRS on 30 
September. 
  This therapeutic device ionizes heavy particles such as 
helium and carbon, accelerates them to 84 percent the speed of 
light in an accelerator called a synchrotron, and focuses the 
beam on cancer cells inside the human body. The main parts of 
the device are an ion source, a pre-accelerator, and a main 
accelerator. In this system, heavy particles that have been 
accelerated in the two linear pre-accelerators are accelerated 
even more in the main accelerator, which is 40 meters in 
diameter and consists of two synchrotrons, until they reach 84 
percent the speed of light. The beam can be directed into three 
treatment rooms. The device has been installed in the NIRS Heavy 
Particle Beam Wing that was opened on 13 October. The total 
cost, including the building, was &yen;32.6 billion, and the 
device itself cost &yen;18.2 billion. 
  The largest parts of this device are the accelerators. 
Accelerators have been used almost exclusively for atomic 
particle experiments in physics and materials research at 
universities and research laboratories. No matter where we look 
in the world, it is extremely rare for four electric product 
manufacturers to cooperate in building this kind of therapeutic 
device. 
  Mitsubishi Electric designed the overall system, the control 
system, the cooling system, and supervised work on the high 
energy beam transport system and the irradiation treatment 
delivery system. Hitachi was responsible for the electromagnets 
and electromagnetic power sources for the main accelerator. 
Toshiba was responsible for the main accelerator's high 
frequency cavities, vacuum ducts, and inlet/outlet beam 
transport systems. Sumitomo Heavy Industries was in charge of 
the injection system including the ion source and the linear 
accelerators. 
  The advantage of using a heavy particle beam to treat cancer 
is that it can be aimed accurately at the tumor to destroy the 
cancer cells efficiently without damaging other tissue in the 
body. 
  The heavy particle beam accelerator uses particles heavier 
than electrons such as helium, carbon, neon, silicon and even 
argon. When it is adjusted to a specific irradiation energy, the 
beam can be aimed at a particular spot. The beam has a strong 
biological effect at the spot where the beam is focused, so it 
is a very powerful tool for destroying cancer cells. This 
treatment is expected to be especially effective against 
heretofore hard to treat cancers such as lung cancer, prostate 
cancer, and bone cancer (osteosarcoma) because it is remote, 
painless, aseptic, and cuts with the precision of a microscalpel. 
  The Lawrence Livermore Laboratory in the U.S. has 
established 
a track record for treating cancer with heavy particle beams, 
but that research was terminated in February 1993. On the other 
hand, a multipurpose heavy particle beam accelerator has been 
completed in Germany, and a plan is presently under review for 
setting up the device so it can also be used for medical 
research. 
  The therapeutic device installed at NIRS is the world's 
first 
heavy particle beam accelerator dedicated strictly to medical 
use, and researchers plan to use it not only for cancer therapy 
but also for accurate diagnoses.

<H5>  The Positive Use of Plutonium From LWRs Is Inseparably </H5>
Connected to the Fuel Cycle 
  Currently, within Japan, active discussion is going forward 
between groups such as the Atomic Energy Commission, the 
government, the utility companies, and the Power Reactor and 
Nuclear Fuel Development Corp. (PNC) regarding the future 
development of Fast-Breeder Reactors (FBR). We are publishing in 
this edition an extract of a portion of an article "Future FBR 
Topics -- FBR and Plutonium Utilization Technology," by Yoshiro 
Takahashi, deputy chairman of the PNC's Development Promotion 
headquarters. This article was taken from the proceedings of the 
"Reports and Lectures Meeting" which was carried out last month 
by the PNC. PNC has completed the prototype reactor "Monju," 
utilizing independent technology from the beginning of the 
development of this FBR. 
<H5>  The Appeal of FBRs </H5>
  First, from the standpoint of effective utilization of 
uranium resources, FBRs possess superior characteristics when 
compared to other types of reactors. 
  Chart No. 1 (below) shows an example of, when plutonium-fuel 
recycling is used, an appraisal of the relationship between the 
percentage composition of plutonium isotopes (as shown on the y 
axis) and the number of times the plutonium fuel is recycled (as 
shown on the x axis) for both Light-Water Reactors (LWR) and 
FBRs. Compared to LWRs, when recycling is done in an FBR, even 
if the number of recyclings is increased, the percentage of 
isotopes which can cause fission, in other words the amount of 
fissile plutonium, does not decrease significantly. In other 
words, if recycling is done in an FBR, it is possible to carry 
out the recycling countless times, and the problem of plutonium 
aging does not exist. 

<FIG ID=JPRS-JST-015L-61A>      Chart No. 1. Changes in the Composition of Pu Isotopes </FIG>


  Another appeal of FBRs is that elements such as minor 
actinides, which were hitherto considered waste materials, can 
be used as fuel in this type of reactor, and therefore, the 
burden placed on the back end can be reduced. Therefore, through 
burning the plutonium produced at LWRs and FBRs, this weak point 
of nuclear power utilization can be effectively utilized as a 
valuable resource. 
  Finally, because of FBR's superior rate of thermal 
efficiency, waste heat can be reduced to the utmost. This is an 
outstanding characteristic from the point of view of 
environmental protection. 
<H5>  Scenario for Bringing FBRs Into Actual Use </H5>
  Up until now, nuclear power utilization has developed 
relying 
on LWRs. In order to utilize FBRs, it is necessary to bring into 
harmony, and unify, LWR recycling technology and FBR recycling 
technology. When economic assessments are discussed, it is not 
fitting that just FBRs are talked about. Rather, the debate 
should include the evaluation of LWRs, FBRs, and recycling 
technology in general. We will show that the best scenario is 
for us to move, as quickly as possible, to discard the systems 
using mainly LWRs, and gradually move toward systems which rely 
on FBRs. 
  Chart No. 2 below shows the relationship between total 
free-world uranium demand and resource volume through around the 
year 2030, at which time the total demand will approach the 
total amount of resource supply. Because the percentage of 
facilities cost as a part of the total construction cost is 
high, if nuclear power plants are not used for their entire 
durability life-span, they are not economical. In fact, because 
fuel supplies are secured by long-term contracts which last for 
20 years, if you consider the amount of uranium secured by 
contract in 2030, the amount of uranium required will clearly 
exceed the total demand amount shown below. Therefore, it is 
possible that there could be a failure of the uranium supply 
balance before 2030. 

<FIG ID=JPRS-JST-015L-62A>      Chart No. 2. Free-World Uranium Demand </FIG>


  On the other hand, if new uranium resources are discovered, 
the urgency of this trend will be relieved. There are those who 
take the optimistic view of this situation, saying, "If the 
uranium supply balance breaks down, then the development of new 
uranium mines will proceed. Therefore, for the time being, there 
is no urgency with regard to uranium resources." This attitude 
of doing nothing while simply waiting for such good fortune is 
nothing more than underestimating the urgency of the uranium 
supply situation. No one can guarantee the discovery of new, 
large-scale uranium reserves. 
  To prepare for the urgent uranium supply situation, it is 
exceedingly important to prepare the technological systems 
required to make possible the utilization of FBR plutonium 
recycling by about 2030. 
  As long as uranium is used in LWRs, it is inevitable that 
plutonium will be produced. As stated above, it is FBRs that can 
make use of this plutonium and effectively utilize uranium 
resources. Next, I will explain why it is so important to 
introduce FBRs as quickly as possible. The following is an 
example of analysis showing just how much FBRs can contribute to 
the power supply, assuming the plutonium recycling technology 
system is prepared and FBRs are introduced into the system 
starting in 2030. 
  Chart No. 3 (below) shows the results of analysis based on 
the supposition of the high case as shown above, wherein Japan's 
nuclear power plant capacity at the end of 2030 tops 100 million 
kilowatts, and where the rate of growth experienced between 2010 
and 2030 continues after 2030. This analysis was based on the 
following suppositions: an annual amount of reprocessed spent 
fuel from LWRs, based on uranium mass conversion, of 1,600 tons, 
a life-span for LWRs and FBRs of 40 years, an FBR breeding ratio 
of 1.2, and an out-of-reactor fuel cycle duration of three years. 

<FIG ID=JPRS-JST-015L-62B>      Chart No. 3. Estimate of Nuclear Power Plant </FIG>


   Even in a case where FBRs are introduced, all of the spent 
fuel from LWRs and FBRs is rapidly reprocessed, and all of the 
plutonium recovered is utilized, after 2030, even if FBRs are 
introduced to their greatest possible extent, FBRs alone will 
not be able to keep pace with anticipated demand, and therefore, 
it will be necessary to build new LWRs. 
  Introduction of new LWRs now means that there will be no 
surplus of plutonium after 2030. In other words, this shows 
that, until around 2070, there will be inadequate supplies of 
plutonium to meet growing demand; plutonium for the FBRs which 
will replace the LWRs that have passed their life-spans. 
  Nobody is arguing the fact that we will need FBRs in the 
future, but we still rely on LWRs today. If we stop turning the 
spent fuel from these LWRs into waste, and instead recycle that 
fuel, it can become a stable energy supply for the future. The 
plutonium balance is currently being debated. There are many 
people who are of the opinion that, because of economic 
considerations, the bringing into actual use of FBRs should be 
pushed back later and later. It can be said, however, that the 
best way to bring this reactor technology into actual use is to 
build the reactor while making improvement after improvement, 
and while considering the pursuit of economic characteristics, 
steadily developing a demonstration reactor, and then a 
commercial reactor, while maintaining the plutonium balance. 
  Based on this analysis of an FBR introduction scenario, at 
an 
early period of FBR commercialization, it is necessary to 
increase the breeding ratio and decrease the time of the 
out-of-reactor cycle in order not to overuse FBRs at the 
beginning. Of course, if abundant supplies of uranium resources 
were available, then it would be possible to consider a more 
relaxed introduction scenario, however, based on the development 
efforts, it is important to utilize plutonium in FBRs at an 
early date. 
  Furthermore, when the FBRs have reached maturity, it is 
important to adjust their breeding ratio and, when mankind 
changes over to another energy source, to remove plutonium from 
the face of the earth. In other words, it is necessary to 
eliminate all of the plutonium. The development of technology 
which will make these things feasible is an obligation which has 
been placed upon the developers of today. With that, let's 
undertake this new duty in cooperation with countries such as 
the United States and France. 
<H5>  The Status of "Monju" </H5>
  Regarding the current status of FBR development, our country 
has completed the reactor "Monju," and we are at the stage where 
we can pursue the implementability and economic viability of a 
plant system that can extract heat as energy. 
  Currently, at "Monju," preparations are moving steadily 
forward in preparation for the first criticality of the reactor, 
which is scheduled for April of next year. After that, tests 
will take place on the reactor physics, the nuclear superheat, 
and output tests. If things go smoothly, the plant is planned to 
enter regular operations in the end of 1995. 
<H5>  Prospects for Commercialization </H5>
  Japan's demonstration reactors have entered into a stage 
where they can be steadily improved, based on "Monju." In order 
for FBRs to come into actual use, across the board improvements 
need to be planned in areas such as reactor safety and 
reliability along with reactor economy. Furthermore, it is also 
necessary to increase the level of acceptance for these reactors 
within society before the time of their commercialization around 
2030. In order to do this, it is necessary to steadily proceed 
with the construction operations of a demonstration reactor 
following after "Monju," and to carry out experimentation for 
the accumulation of technology and experience, and aimed at 
developing technology needed to bring FBRs toward future 
commercialization.

separation machine assembly facility being built by the Uranium 
Enrichment Machinery Company (Head office, Tokyo, President 
Shigemi Sugino) in Rokkasho-mura in Aomori Prefecture. 
  This company has a centrifugal separation machine parts 
fabrication and assembly plant in Sendai City in Miyagi 
Prefecture, however, operations at the uranium enrichment 
facility by Japan Nuclear Fuel Ltd. has begun, and future 
expansion work is continuing in earnest. Because of this, and 
also because of a desire to increase the centrifugal separator 
transport efficiency, ensure product quality, and at the urging 
of the prefecture where the facility is located, the company 
decided to construct the final assembly processing plant at the 
Rokkasho-mura factory, within the Ogawara development zone which 
is adjacent to the enrichment plant, and transfer this function 
from the Sendai facility. 
  As for the size of the facility, the area of the lot is 
around 40,000 square meters and the area of the construction 
site is approximately 4,000 square meters. The construction is 
scheduled to be completed by the end of the year, and 
construction completion ceremonies are slated for January 1994. 
The commencement of assembly operations is planned to start 
around the end of this fiscal year [the end of March 1994], and 
they will perform assembly operations starting at a rate of 150 
ton SWU/year of centrifugal separator for FY94. They plan, at 
first, to employ 20-30 people at this facility. 
  The Uranium Enrichment Machinery Company was established 
with 
&yen;3 billion, &yen;1 billion each coming from Hitachi, 
Toshiba, and Mitsubishi Heavy Industries. This company, which 
was established in December 1984, is Japan's only uranium 
enrichment centrifugal separation machinery manufacturer. 
Currently, they employ around 300 people.

<H5>  Efforts To Reform the Nuclear Power Development Long Term </H5>
Plan 
  Since 1956, the Atomic Energy Commission, in order to 
proceed 
with the use and development of nuclear power in a planned and 
comprehensive manner with the understanding and cooperation of 
the people, about once every five years, has published the 
Nuclear Power Development Long Term Plan (hereafter called the 
long term plan), in which is laid out general guidelines and 
concrete policies regarding the development and utilization of 
nuclear power. 
  The current long term plan was drawn up in June 1987, 
however, mirroring the great changes in the domestic and 
international situation with regard to nuclear power, such as 
the steady progress of Japan's nuclear power development 
(starting with the fuel cycle operations in Rokkasho-mura in 
Aomori Prefecture), the end of the East-West Cold War, rising 
fears over the proliferation of nuclear arms, and increased 
awareness of the global environmental problem. In July 1992, the 
Atomic Energy Commission decided to carry out a revision of the 
long term plan, and established, under its own auspices, a Long 
Term Plan Specialist Committee. 
  It was decided to establish five subcommittees under this 
Specialist Committee, the General Subcommittee, the First 
Subcommittee (light water reactor utilization), the Second 
Subcommittee (nuclear fuel recycling), the Third Subcommittee 
(nuclear non-proliferation and international aid), and the 
Fourth Subcommittee (technology development), and to set up 
various working groups within the subcommittees to consider the 
following problems: the First and Second Subcommittees to 
jointly look at radioactive waste countermeasures, the Third 
Subcommittee to look at nuclear non-proliferation 
countermeasures, and the Fourth Subcommittee to look at nuclear 
ships, high-temperature engineering research and 
experimentation, and the nuclear power workforce problem. 
Currently, studies are being carried out in the various 
subcommittees. 
  Furthermore, in view of the increased popular interest in 
nuclear power policy, which has been caused by factors such as 
the domestic and international situation with regard to nuclear 
fuel recycling, a broad range of opinions is being sought on the 
development of nuclear power from experienced scholars in areas 
other than nuclear power as part of the long term plan 
formulation process. It is thought to be significant that such 
views are to be reflected in the long term plan. A Long Term 
Plan Round-Table Group has been established in the Specialist 
Committee that is composed of professionals in fields other than 
nuclear power to discuss, in connection with this revision of 
the long term plan, just how our country's nuclear power 
development should take place. 
  The primary points to be discussed in connection with the 
revision of the long term plan include: 


    -  looking forward to the 21st century, the formulation of 
a long term and flexible nuclear power development system; 
  -  the 
coexistence of the peaceful use of nuclear power and nuclear 
non-proliferation under the new world order following an end to 
the Cold War; 
  -  international aid as one of the advanced countries 
which possess nuclear technology, the promotion of worthy 
guiding projects and basic research in countries with emerging 
technology, and the development of fundamental technology; and, 
  -  expanding the public's understanding of the necessity of 
nuclear power from the point of view of the dealing with 
international issues such as the energy problem and the 
environmental problem. 

    These are issues that will be discussed from the point of 
view of general topics connected to this revision of the long 
term plan. However, it is possible that the following important 
issues could be raised in connection with nuclear fuel recycling: 


    -  the necessity of nuclear fuel recycling and a 
reconfirmation of its significance; 
  -  the revealing of a rational 
nuclear fuel recycling plan, which has flexibility in its 
entirety, starting with the plan to develop fast breeder 
reactors; and, 
  -  the revealing of a nuclear fuel recycling plan 
that clearly shows that it can receive acceptance both 
domestically and internationally, based on factors such as the 
global situation with regard to nuclear non-proliferation. 

    As stated in this article, within an international situation 
that is undergoing radical change, this revision of the long 
term plan is extremely important in order to, while following 
the ideals laid down by the basic law on nuclear power, continue 
to obtain the understanding of the citizens of Japan and the 
international community, pursue the development of nuclear power 
(starting with nuclear fuel recycling) and, at the same time, 
plan for the securing of stable energy supplies and the 
promotion of the development of advanced technology, bring forth 
the renewal potential of nuclear power, and positively 
contribute to international society as a peaceful user of 
nuclear power. 
  The Atomic Energy Commission is in a position to, looking 
forward to the 21st century and in conformity to the climate of 
the times, listen to the views of various sectors with regard to 
the formulation of a new long term plan which incorporates basic 
guidelines on nuclear power development and specific policies on 
its promotion which our country should adopt.

<H5>  Substance Circulation Research in a Closed System </H5>
<H5>  Environmental Science and Technology Research Institute </H5>
<H5>  The Construction of a Simulation Facility Rokkasho-mura </H5>
  The Science and Technology Agency (STA) has embarked on a 
plan to build, starting next fiscal year, an "Ecosphere 
Substance Circulation Simulation Facility" in Rokkasho-mura in 
Aomori Prefecture. The purpose of this facility is to cast light 
on the behavior of radioactive substances in an ecosphere. 
  This facility is one which will carry out simulation 
experiments on the behavior and circulation characteristics of 
radioactive substances both on land and in the water, with the 
goal of grasping, over the mid- to long-term, the impact of 
radioactive substances on the environment. This facility is to 
be built in response to strong concerns over the influence of 
the radioactive substances found on the site of the nuclear fuel 
system facility on the environment and on humans through contact 
through things such as the food chain. 
<H5>  The Food Chain Will Also Be Studied </H5>
  This research facility will be composed of two facilities, 
the water-system ecosphere facility and the land-system 
ecosphere facility. The environmental conditions within the 
facility can be freely controlled to perform experiments 
imitating various kinds of environmental conditions. 

<FIG ID=JPRS-JST-015L-65A>      A Bird's-Eye View of the Simulation Facility </FIG>

  Because the land system ecosphere facility will study the 
conditions that would occur if radioactive substances escaped 
into the environment, the propagation of plant life, the 
movement of these substances to animals through the food-chain, 
and their introduction into the water sphere through means such 
as rainfall, this facility will be built to include: 
  1. A greenhouse with rainfall equipment; 
  2. An animal breeding building for the breeding of small 
animals; and 
  3. Dwellings to be used as residences by the researchers. 
  Furthermore, because the water system ecosphere will study 
things such as the food chain from plankton to fish species, it 
will include features such as: 
  1. A closed-system pool which imitates ocean surface 
conditions; and 
  2. A high pressure water tank that imitates conditions in 
mid- to deep-water. 
  Moreover, along with intercepting substances either entering 
from or exiting to the outside environment, both the land and 
water systems are equipped with circulation support equipment, 
such as temperature adjustment equipment, equipment to adjust 
gases such as carbon dioxide, oxygen, and nitrogen, and 
equipment to control the quality of the water, which allow both 
ecospheres to maintain their simulated environmental conditions. 
  These facilities have the following special characteristics: 
  1. Because they can imitate various natural environmental 
conditions, experiments can be performed under conditions close 
to those occurring naturally. 
  2. At the same time, they can imitate conditions in which 
measurements and experimentation would be difficult in the 
actual environment. 
  3. Furthermore, because there is no substance infiltration 
from, or escape to the outside environment, the course and 
conditions of the transference and circulation of substances 
within the facility can be correctly ascertained. 
  4. Moreover, the mutual influence of living things and the 
environment can be ascertained through the breeding and 
cultivation of animals and plants. 
<H5>  Interest Is Great, Even Internationally </H5>
  STA has requested &yen;4.6 billion in the FY94 budget for 
facility and equipment costs, and plans to equip the facility 
over a five-year plan starting next fiscal year. Construction 
and operation will be carried out by the Environmental Science 
and Technology Research Institute (non-profit organization). 
Other than the facility discussed in this article, this research 
institute is also promoting the planned "Closed-System Research 
Facility" studying the influence of radioactive substances on 
agricultural products and other plants. 
  These facilities will study the impact that radioactive 
substances have on living organisms and the environment, and 
because these are epoch-making facilities for environmental and 
ecological scientific research, they will probably be seen as 
core research centers for international environmental protection 
research.

  [Text] On the 19th, Japan Nuclear Fuel Ltd. made its first 
shipment of uranium fluoride VI (UF[.sub]6[/]) produced at 
the uranium enrichment factory at Rokkasho-mura in Aomori 
Prefecture. The uranium product was sealed into 15 cylinders and 
loaded onto a specialized truck bound for the reprocessing 
factory in Tokai-mura in Ibaraki Prefecture. This is the first 
shipment since operations began almost two years ago. The 
industrialization of uranium enrichment has entered into a new 
phase. 
  The uranium products in this shipment are to be used by 
Tokyo 
Electric Power Co., Kansai EPC, and Chubu EPC. After the uranium 
is converted into uranium dioxide at the reprocessing plant, it 
will be assembled into fuel assemblies at nuclear fuel 
processing plants in Tokai-mura, Kanagawa Prefecture, and Osaka 
Prefecture, and will then be shipped to the various power plants 
for use as fuel. There are no further shipments planned for 
FY93, with the prospects for the next delivery coming in FY94. 
  Regarding the transportation of this shipment, Japan Nuclear 
Fuel Ltd. said, "In the transport of this uranium we satisfied 
the country's technological standard from the outset, and 
carried it out taking total safety measures, such as forming a 
convoy which included escort vehicles in front of and behind the 
transport vehicle." 
  The enrichment factory, which began operations in March 
1992, 
currently produces enriched uranium at a rate of 450 ton 
separative work units (SWU) per year, but they are aiming at 
increasing production by an additional 150 ton SWU/year after 
April 1994. Ultimate plant capacity would be 1,500 ton SWU/year, 
however, permission from the government has only been obtained 
for 1,050 ton SWU/year. Operations to produce this level are 
scheduled to begin in FY98.

  [Text] A round-table conference between Satsuki Eda, 
director general of the Science and Technology Agency, and the 
heads of the power companies, was opened on the 19th at a hotel 
in Tokyo, at which an exchange of views took place on issues 
such as nuclear power. 
  At this venue, Director General Eda said in his greeting 
that 
nuclear power played an important role within the country's 
energy policy, indicated the government's intention to maintain 
its policy on this matter, and sought the cooperation of the 
power company executives. Furthermore, regarding fuel recycling, 
along with emphasizing that he would like to maintain the 
policies passed down to him, he said that, with regard to making 
information public, while there are many difficult problems, 
including the protection of nuclear substances and proprietary 
rights, "we would like to release as much information to the 
public as possible, from the standpoint that the information 
possessed by the administration is the public's information." 
  In response to this, Kohei Abe, chairman of the Federation 
of 
Electric Power Companies, stated that he felt strongly that the 
current administration was promoting a policy consistent with 
previous policy on nuclear power, and declared again the 
Federation's position to actively work for the promotion of the 
utilization of plutonium for electric power. Particularly, 
regarding plutonium which had returned from abroad, he said, "We 
plan to process MOX fuel abroad and transport it from overseas. 
We would like to make use of the transport experience that we 
obtained through the Akatsuki-maru'." Furthermore, the chairman 
indicated that, for progress in the development of nuclear 
power, it was extremely important to secure a new site [for a 
reactor]. He emphasized that, regarding the site problem, "We 
would like to grapple with this problem in the future with all 
of our might, while at the same time obtaining the understanding 
and cooperation of the people."

  [Text] 
<H5>  Most Significant Course of Nuclear Fuel Recycling </H5>
  EF: Let's begin with Mr. Suzuki. We sincerely 
appreciate your work on the Nuclear Fuel Recycling Expert 
Subcommittee Report issued on 10 July 1991. Since then the 
international trend toward non-proliferation has become more 
dynamic with the problems over what to do with the plutonium 
from dismantled nuclear weapons in the former Soviet Union, the 
transport of plutonium from France to Japan by the Akatsuki 
Maru, and so forth. What do you think? 
  Suzuki: Two years have passed since we issued the 
Nuclear Fuel Recycling Report, and during that time many factors 
for change have arisen. One key point in that report is the fact 
that it shows in numbers the cost of plutonium supply and demand 
over the next 20 years or so. Another point is that the report 
emphasizes we should reveal beforehand, both at home and abroad, 
Japan's plans for plutonium utilization, and in the spirit of 
openness, proceed with those plans. These two issues will be 
important from now on as well. 
  I think we should carefully reconsider the quantitative 
balance of supply and demand in the hearings to revise the 
Nuclear Energy Long-Term Plan. Moreover, as far as openness is 
concerned, I think it will be increasingly important for Japan 
to be as "up front" as possible about her plans for peaceful 
utilization of nuclear energy, when we consider the rapid shift 
toward nuclear disarmament accompanying the fall of the Soviet 
Union, the problems with North Korea and so forth. I sincerely 
hope the Long Term Plan subcommittee will consider this 
carefully. And if they do, then the key issue will be what will 
happen to Japan's FBR commercialization plans. 
  EF: It appears that the plan for FBR 
commercialization is "attached by its umbilical cord" to the 
hearings on the Long Term Plan. That means that FBR 
commercialization and plutonium utilization are really two sides 
of the same coin. This relationship became crystal clear when 
the continuous sintering furnace that makes fuel pellets for the 
prototype reactor Monju broke down and delayed criticality for 
the third time. Some people on the Basic Subpanel, which has the 
job of overseeing the Expert Subcommittee working on the Long 
Term Plan, have said that we must decide whether to give 
priority to the balance of plutonium supply and demand or to 
cost effectiveness. 
  Suzuki: Both cost effectiveness and balancing 
plutonium supply and demand are important, but in discussions up 
till now, consistency in government policy has been considered 
more important than cost effectiveness because of the position 
of the Atomic Energy Commission of Japan. So it seems to me that 
the discussion over plutonium supply and demand has received 
more attention. From an international standpoint, however, if we 
try to go ahead with a specific plan in the future, then it is 
important to consider how much it will cost. In that sense, many 
people are now discussing how we should handle the issue of cost 
effectiveness. At least that is my understanding. 
  Everyone associated with nuclear power in Japan believes 
that 
plutonium will surely become an important source of energy in 
the long run, but if we accept the premise that plutonium is 
absolutely necessary, then we also have to say that it does not 
matter how much it will cost. However, in order to master the 
use of plutonium for the future we must make the operation both 
streamlined and cost effective, and an extremely important point 
will be how much we can increase this cost-effective 
streamlining from now on. 
  MOX processing will cost more than uranium processing, but 
if 
we say it is better just because it costs more, that is not the 
true reason. Actually there are two advantages: we can cut down 
on uranium usage if we recycle plutonium in LWRs, and uranium 
enrichment will no longer be necessary. Furthermore, if we make 
plutonium mixed fuels, of course we have to pay the processing 
costs, but in any event we should be able to find a happy 
medium. I think we should make this a goal for technological 
development. 
  In other words, I think it is very important that we should 
attach great importance to the government's approach that we not 
possess "excess plutonium," and at the same time we should also 
pursue cost-effective streamlining of the operation. 
  EF: Mr. Washimi, what is the position of those in 
the electric power industry? 
  Washimi: From a security standpoint I think we 
should clearly adopt the concept of plutonium balance as 
national policy and move in the direction of not possessing 
"excess plutonium." I think the basic path to achieve this is to 
adopt MOX fuels and use plutonium in FBRs. My reason is that we 
cannot acquire energy for the 21st century if we do not utilize 
plutonium. 
  But when we consider cost effectiveness as well, we cannot 
simply say that pursuing a balance in supply and demand should 
be our policy no matter how much it costs. The electric power 
industry collects a fee from everyone who uses electricity, and 
one basis for making decisions is how much of that fee can be 
applied to the cost of preparing future energy supplies. 
  On the other hand, "technological development" takes a very 
long time to bear fruit. When we look at the history of LWR 
development, it has taken about 30 years. We have been told that 
even if we begin development for FBR commercialization today, it 
will be 2030 before the Age of the FBR truly arrives. All the 
people who are alive until that time will be customers of the 
electric power industry, and it is up to us to find out how much 
of their electric bill they will allow us to use to pay for 
technological development. 
  From that standpoint, the electric power industry cannot 
boldly promote FBR commercialization without the consent of the 
populace. Therefore, I believe the electric power industry 
should not act on its own, but should discuss the matter with 
scholars and the government. Then in some form or other we 
should draw a line to indicate how much capital we think we 
ought to invest in the future and strive to work within that 
range. 
  EF: Mr. Suzuki, the idea that plutonium 
utilization and FBRs will be expensive that has been embraced by 
Democratic Party non-proliferation hardliners in the U.S. 
Congress and Mr. Leventhal, the anti-plutonium activist, has 
attained wide acceptance. Most American nuclear weapons have 
plutonium warheads, and Americans' beliefs are strongly rooted 
in a society where peaceful and military uses of nuclear energy 
have been mixed together. 
  Suzuki: When plutonium is not recycled, it is 
commonly called "one-through." In the case of one-through, we 
cannot determine the final stopping point. In other words, can 
we or should we get rid of all our spent fuel? No country has 
tried this yet. Even in discussions in the U.S., comparisons are 
made without clarifying this issue, and so in the true sense of 
the word comparisons of cost effectiveness are not possible. 
  What is important in explaning why recycling is reasonable 
is 
whether spent fuel is considered a "useful resource" or not. I 
believe it is a useful resource, so for me the problem is when 
and how much of it will be recycled as a resource. Rather than 
simply a problem of cost effectiveness, I think this is a nearly 
insolvable problem if we do not consider how we will obtain a 
stable long-term supply of the resource. 
  In the past the rule has been that spent fuel will be 
recycled as a resource as soon as possible, but there is really 
no need to hurry. I think it is important to use the right 
amount of spent fuel at the right time as a resource, and 
definitely not dispose of it as waste. 
  EF: But Japan does not have a lot of land. 
  Washimi: Japan is a small country, but nuclear 
fuel itself is very compact, and we are still debating whether 
we should dispose of spent fuel entirely or keep it for 
processing. Either way, if we can obtain the consensus of the 
majority of the populace, it will not take up a lot of space. 
  On the other hand, by the second half of the 21st century we 
will begin to reach the end of our buried reserves of oil and 
natural gas, and their prices will gradually rise. Even if the 
FBR were developed right away, although it would be more 
expensive than generating electricity from oil-burning plants 
right now, as power producers we must give the highest priority 
to the issue of which path will place the smallest burden on our 
customers in the future, when prices of LNG and oil have gone 
up. I believe that we can acquire adequate cost effectiveness at 
that time by improving and developing our present FBR technology. 
<H5>  Weathering the Mass Media Storm </H5>
  EF: As a former newspaper reporter I was 
disappointed in the reporting of the transport of plutonium by 
the Akatsuki Maru. It took more than six years to complete the 
U.S-Japan Atomic Energy Agreement that places the two countries 
on an equal footing. At that time, near the end of the 
negotiations the U.S. was insisting on transport by air, but 
Japan resisted. However, the state of Alaska and others 
protested because Anchorage Airport would lie along the course, 
so the Murkowski Amendment was passed by Congress to reverse the 
U.S. position. If the newspaper reporters had bothered to learn 
the history behind plutonium transport, they would not have 
reported the event in that way. 
  Washimi: It is necessary to utilize plutonium in 
order to guarantee a future source of nuclear fuel for power 
generation. In accordance with this basic plan, we had the 
reprocessing done overseas, recovered the plutonium and brought 
it back on the Akatsuki Maru. I consider this one step we have 
taken toward the future. At that time we were opposed by 
Greenpeace, but I think that perhaps we did not strive hard 
enough to seek their understanding about plutonium. 
  In addition, we could not reveal absolutely every bit of 
information to the public because of the need to protect nuclear 
material. It is human nature that the more things we keep 
hidden, the more people want to know about them. My 
understanding is that the government is reviewing issues such as 
how to form mutual agreements and how much information can be 
released to the public. These are certainly issues that must be 
considered. 
  Therefore, we must hold firm to our basic plan for 
converting 
"unburnable" uranium 238, which accounts for 99.3 percent of all 
the uranium, into plutonium 239 and using it. 
  Suzuki: What Mr. Washimi said just now illustrates 
a good lesson. From the standpoint of protecting nuclear 
materials, in other words, from the standpoint of security, it 
is only natural that some information is difficult to disclose 
to the public. The government has followed the approach that it 
has responsibilities to the U.S. and to Europe, so information 
disclosed to the public should be kept to an absolute minimum. 
However, many ordinary citizens doubt whether that is the real 
issue or not. Information concerning safety is not for security 
but for safety, and they think that as much information as 
possible concerning safety should be available to the public. On 
the other hand, information that is absolutely necessary for 
security cannot be disclosed to the public. In reality, it is 
difficult to know where to draw the line. Through what we have 
just experienced we have learned that many people in Japan think 
non-disclosure should be kept to a bare minimum, and many people 
in places like France seem to feel the same way. 
  We have learned another important lesson as well. We 
Japanese 
tend to take for granted that because we are clearly limiting 
the use of plutonium to peaceful purposes and are not even 
considering military uses, people in other countries will 
naturally go along with our plans. Our experience has made us 
realize once more that that is not the case. 
  One more point is that because we Japanese tend to think 
about plutonium and atomic energy purely in terms of peaceful 
utilization, we have become somewhat insensitive to the uses of 
atomic energy in other countries. Japanese newspapers and other 
media have paid little attention to the North Korean problem. 
The Foreign Ministry has had several contacts through formal 
diplomatic channels, and that is what we expect. But newspapers 
and public opinion polls show almost no interest. I am sure that 
Americans find this hard to believe. They cannot understand how 
the Japanese can be so nonchalant about a neighboring country 
wanting to go nuclear. I am hoping that this flap about the 
Akatsuki Maru will be an opportunity for Japanese people to gain 
some understanding of the workings of international peace. 
  EF: I watched a special program broadcast on NHK 
on 23 May entitled "Japan, The Plutonium Superpower II: The 
Dream and Reality of Nuclear Fuel Recycling." I felt it was so 
biased that I sent a letter with several questions to their 
Office of Inquiry. They passed my letter on to the head of the 
Reporting Division, but the response I got back did not answer 
my questions. 
  Suzuki: Reporters talked to me too, but it 
appeared that the reporters had just come to me for information, 
and I did not appear on the program at all. When the reporters 
talked to me they made it clear what the program intended to 
say, so I was not too surprised. But when a reporting 
organization tackles the plutonium problem, I guess we can 
expect them to be rather critical. In many instances they did 
not acknowledge the facts, and I wish they were a little more 
enlightened. 
  Regardless of their approach, however, I am happy that they 
spent two evenings of prime time to look at plutonium. It may 
not have been directly effective in opening people's eyes, but a 
reporter from an unrelated magazine publisher visited me after 
watching the program and asked me if what he saw on the program 
was true. After I explained things to him, he wrote an article 
expounding the true facts of the situation, so there has been 
that kind of secondary effect. I like to look at it in a 
positive light. 
  EF: I watched it together with my wife, and after 
it was over my wife said to me, "Why don't you stop working your 
fingers to the bone? The future is so bleak, and developing the 
FBR will be a total waste." 
  Washimi: I agree with Mr. Suzuki that it was good 
for them to report on the plutonium issue. At least after the 
first part of the NHK special that is how we felt, but the 
second part was just too one-sided. 
  For example, the program stated that there are 5 million 
tons 
of uranium resources, so the FBR is totally unnecessary. Right 
now the amount of officially confirmed unmined uranium is 2.1 
million tons, and even if we include all the most probable 
additional estimated resources, it only comes to 3.4 million 
tons. The only way to get 5 million tons is to add in every 
speculation about uranium deposits that have not been confirmed 
and may or may not exist. We still do not know whether they are 
there or not. Not only that, the figures they use together with 
the 5 million tons are based on the premise that the price of 
uranium will go up to $100/lb. Right now it is only $10/lb, so I 
do not think their calculations are realistic. They should show 
more clearly how they arrived at those numbers. 
  Looking at another example, the program reported that 
reprocessing will produce a sixfold increase in nuclear waste. 
Actually, that is true right now, but we have reduced the amount 
of high-level waste with vitrification, and almost all the waste 
is low-level waste. I wish they would have dug a little deeper 
and explained there is a good chance that reprocessing will 
generate much less waste than direct disposal in the future 
thanks to a reduction in the amount of fuel we will use. 
  Finally, I wish they had taken a long-term view and 
addressed 
the basic issue that we were discussing earlier--that plutonium 
is an important energy resource for the future, and looked at 
our present situation in moving toward its application. 
  EF: What about my wife's statement that developing 
the FBR will be a total waste? 
  Washimi: A very long time is needed for 
technological development. Just looking at airplanes, 30 or 40 
years passed between the Wright brothers and jet aircraft. Even 
when we begin full-fledged commercialization of the FBR and work 
very hard at it, the development will take 30 to 40 years. 
Currently we are working very hard on research and development, 
but we should look beyond that and make decisions based on the 
FBR's usefulness as a source of energy. 
<H5>  FBR Commercialization and Domestic MOX Production Far Away </H5>
  EF: The power industry is leaning toward domestic 
production of MOX fuels, and I believe that preparations for 
domestic MOX production are one of the issues in the upcoming 
Long Term Plan review. 
  Suzuki: Construction has begun on the reprocessing 
plant at Rokkasho Village under the premise that it is for the 
utilization of recovered plutonium and uranium. The most 
effective way for utilizing it is in the form of MOX. Naturally, 
we must think about the structure of a domestic MOX fuel 
business. The electric power companies are encouraged by this 
move. 
  Up till now PNC has conducted technological development, 
mainly in the three fields of uranium enrichment, reprocessing, 
and MOX fuels as they relate to the fuel cycle. The mainstream 
of uranium enrichment and reprocessing has already moved to the 
private sector. So that leaves us with MOX fuels. When we look 
at the path of uranium enrichment and reprocessing in their 
transition from technological development to private sector 
commercialization, it appears there are ways to make better use 
of the fruits of technological development. 
  The biggest problem is personnel. I believe it is very 
important how we utilize the people who dealt with development 
of MOX fuel processing technology at PNC and who currently 
possess vital know-how when we make the transition to 
commercialization. I hope that this time, when we decide the 
direction of the business structure, we consider this issue much 
more carefully than we did in the past. 
  EF: I have seen the Plutonium Fuel No. 3 
Development Lab at PNC's Tokai Works. As you look at it from the 
front there is an FBR line on the left and an ATR line on the 
right. Four years have passed since the building for the ATR 
line was completed, but it is still standing empty. One reason 
is the delay at the Oma site for the ATR demonstration reactor, 
of course. I think PNC should bring in people from fuel 
manufacturers and together make MOX fuel both for the Oma 
reactor and for the plutonium thermal reactors for power company 
use. 
  Suzuki: Just as you say, the key point will be how 
well we make use of this opportunity and tie in the PNC experts 
in this field to commercialization. The ATR line is very 
important and it must proceed on schedule from now on. I have a 
feeling that the people involved with MOX fuels are taking a 
rather narrow approach. MOX fuels allow rather flexible designs 
to be made, and if we would do so I think cost-effective 
streamlining with MOX fuels will make a big jump forward. I hope 
this view will be included when decisions are made. 
  The heater on the sintering furnace for making fuel for 
Monju 
broke down recently, delaying criticality. The causes are rather 
complex, but fuel for the Monju has a plutonium content of more 
than 20 percent, with a maximum enrichment of about 25 percent. 
PNC has been making fuel for Fugen for a long time, but that 
fuel has a plutonium content of 1-2 percent, about 3 percent 
maximum. Going from that level to numbers in the 20 
percent-range means a plutonium content 10 times higher. Because 
it is difficult to guarantee the same kind of yield for a fuel 
with 10 times more plutonium, I expect this will become an issue 
from now on. 
  We can use a special campaign to make fuel for the FBR, but 
in the future we must make it on a production line that flows 
continuously in the same way we make fuel for the LWRs today. A 
very important issue will be how we achieve that level, and in 
that sense I would like to see the No. 3 Development Lab be 
actively utilized. 
  EF: When a conversation was held this spring among 
some of the most prominent leaders in this field, it was leaked 
that one issue for study in the Long Term Plan hearings will be, 
considering the present trend, whether the electric power 
industry can actually build a second or third demonstration 
reactor even though the present Long Term Plan states that two 
or three will be built. Judging from the present trend, when we 
look at the most recent hearings in the FBR Development Project 
Expert Subcommittee, some people may propose an international 
project for building the second and third demonstration reactors 
like ITER in which Japan, the U.S., EC and Russia have begun 
engineering designs for an experimental fusion reactor. 
  Washimi: Right now there is a hot debate going on 
about when the first demonstration reactor will be built. The 
present Long Term Plan calls for construction on the first 
demonstration reactor to begin in the latter half of the 1990s, 
but it must be sufficiently based on our experience with Monju, 
and we must still get some kind of yardstick on cost 
effectiveness. Furthermore, there are some technical problems 
that are still at the R&amp;D stage. However, the attitude of the 
electric power industry is that we should forge steadily ahead 
with the development of the first demonstration reactor. 
  As far as the second and third demonstration reactors are 
concerned, we should make our decisions with the belief that 
this technology will make steady progress. We are trying very 
hard to make our first demonstration reactor a large reactor 
like the Super Phenix in France, but it may not turn out that 
way. This is my personal opinion, but the larger the reactor, 
the more time it takes to deal with any kind of trouble. So I 
have a feeling that we may eventually have a small reactor. I 
believe that in addition to our experiences with the first 
demonstration reactor, our concept for the second demonstration 
reactor will be based on research on the various possibilities 
for building it in the future. 
  The third reactor lies even farther down the road, and 
although I am not completely sure, I expect that one important 
standard for making the decision will be how much it will cost. 
I believe it is important to reach a consensus on how much of 
the current fees for electricity should be used to pay for the 
cost of future energy. 
  EF: Mr. Suzuki, you made an excellent comment at 
the last meeting of the Expert Subcommittee. You said that if we 
proceed by focusing on the reactors, the burden will be passed 
on to the fuel cycle, and we will be forced to think about 
reactors in terms of the fuel cycle. 
  Suzuki: I made that statement right after we got 
the news that PNC's continuous sintering furnace that was making 
fuel for Monju had broken down and that Monju criticality would 
suffer a long delay. As we seek higher and higher levels of 
performance in reactor specifications, the burden falls on the 
fuel, and things get very difficult from the standpoint of 
acquiring fuel. Monju fuel has low density, and the rods are 
short and thin. When asked, PNC could not say it was unable to 
make that kind of fuel. Actually, making the fuel a little 
thicker and much denser would have been a lot easier. LWR fuel 
can be made that way. PNC has to make fuel that is harder to 
make than LWR fuel. I think it will be important in the future 
to adopt designs in which the reactor and the cycle are 
technologically in balance. 
  Now we are concerned with the process of making the 
transition to commercialization, so a very important issue will 
be how much we can improve our technology. In that sense, short 
term cost effectiveness and so forth are irrelevant. It is 
important that we think of this as technology linked to the 
future, and in that sense I want to see plans for demonstration 
reactors that take the fuel cycle into account. 
<H5>  Expectations for New Long Term Plan </H5>
  EF: In closing, do you have any requests for the 
Long Term Plan Expert Subcommittee? 
  Washimi: As a basic line of reasoning I hope that 
the Long Term Plan will not place too much emphasis on immediate 
results. Energy technology takes a very long time to develop, so 
it is not wise to make decisions based only on the present. It 
is important to take a long-range view. 
  I also hope the committee looks at things from the 
standpoint 
of the general populace. I am sure that the basic framework of 
the Long Term Plan will be clearly written down, but I am 
wondering whether it could be put in the form of a story that 
average citizens can understand? People concerned with atomic 
energy can understand if you say, "In the year two thousand and 
something-or-other we will do this," but I do not think the 
average citizen understands why. I think we need to publish a 
kind of "Cliff's Notes" to the Long Term Plan. 
  Suzuki: I work at a university and deal with young 
students. I want to think that in the future they will be active 
in the field of atomic energy. In that sense, the Long Term Plan 
is very important, and I think most people are particularly 
interested in what will happen to the FBR project. In the 
Nuclear Fuel Recycling Expert Subcommittee Report we issued two 
years ago, we said that we would need roughly 10-20 tons of 
plutonium for the FBR. I think this time we should express 
quantities more precisely. If we do so I think that people 
involved in reprocessing will be encouraged, and the target for 
MOX manufacturing will also become clear. 
  Of course, cost effectiveness is very important and power 
companies reflect this in electricity rates. Power companies 
cannot proceed on their own if the cost is too high. Therefore, 
the most important problem for the upcoming Long Term Plan 
sessions will be expressing the FBR project in a way that most 
people can go along with. 
  Not only in the field of atomic energy, but in other fields 
as well, Japan is showing her economic and technological 
strength to the rest of the world. We must ask whether Japan 
alone should bear the risks of technological developments that 
will benefit the whole world. As economic burdens continue to 
increase international cooperation often means merely providing 
funds. Atomic energy is different because by pouring both 
economic and technical strength into technological development 
of the FBR, we will benefit other nations as well in the future. 
I believe we have arrived at an age in which that will be our 
goal. If that is the case, there is a possibility the FBR 
project may be considered quite rational, even if the financial 
cost is considerable. 
  Washimi: I agree completely. We must approach this 
from the standpoint that the plutonium recycling FBR is not only 
energy for Japan, but energy for the whole world. We must also 
look at it as something for future generations as well as for 
those alive today. Therefore, cost effectiveness comes into play 
because the money will come from fees paid by today's users of 
electricity in Japan. Basically we must consider the future of 
the world's energy and ask ourselves how much of the burden our 
generation should bear.

  [Text] 
<H5>  World Reaction to Plutonium Utilization </H5>
  Sakai: First, I will ask you a question since you 
are the "Plutonium Man." You were the coordinator of the first 
large plutonium shipment from France on the Seishin Maru 
(arriving before dawn on 15 November 1984) and were in charge of 
the plutonium shipment on the Akatsuki Maru that attracted world 
attention from last fall through 5 January. As "Plutonium Man," 
what do you make of the nuclear non-proliferation trend in the 
world today? 
  Ishiwatari: I myself was not really aware of it, 
but I gladly accept the title "Plutonium Man." Your question is 
wide-ranging and difficult. Let me answer from the standpoint of 
a person who deals with atomic energy development in Japan. 
  Today, we must evaluate what the existence of the Nuclear 
Non-Proliferation Treaty (NPT), which has aroused such public 
interest, has meant to Japan. Japan signed the treaty on 3 
February 1970, but it took six years for the National Diet to 
ratify it. The NPT forms the basis for the world's present 
nuclear non-proliferation structure. And one major factor 
lurking behind the scenes with this treaty was the Cold War. At 
that time the "nuclear parity" between the U.S. and the Soviet 
Union formed the basis for world order. In one way of thinking, 
the NPT mechanism has developed as an attempt to solidify this 
structure, and therefore, bring about the most favorable outcome 
for the whole world. However, Japan knows that this structure 
has its own problems. That is why we have a history of six years 
of debate in the Diet before we finally ratified the treaty on 8 
June 1976. 
  At that time, there were three major subjects of debate in 
Japan. The first was a concern over the design of the treaty 
because for countries like Japan without nuclear weapons this 
was an "unfair" agreement, and in a sense granted special 
privileges to nations with nuclear weapons. The second was 
concern that the agreement might interfere with the peaceful 
utilization of atomic energy, which Japan was vigorously 
pursuing. The third point is probably not important today, but 
it was the view that we should leave the door open for Japan to 
choose to have nuclear weapons in the future and that "nuclear 
detonations for peaceful purposes" should be permitted. The 
treaty was ratified only after these issues were discussed at 
length. 
  Directly after ratification, PNC gained experience on its 
own 
in Japan-U.S. negotiations over the operation of the Tokai 
reprocessing plant. By successfully concluding those 
negotiations and continuing up to the present, PNC can make its 
own evaluations of the issues that were discussed at that time, 
and those evaluations will likely reflect those of Japan as a 
nation. Personally, we wanted all the countries with nuclear 
weapons to proceed with nuclear disarmament, but because the 
negotiations were conducted under an atmosphere of 
confrontation, the fact is that we did not press the issue too 
strongly. Recently we have seen progress in the form of the end 
of the Cold War, so I think we can judge what happened in light 
of that. 
  Let us look at what kinds of problems there were and what 
kinds of problems remain today. Japan prides herself as being in 
"faithful compliance" with the NPT, but when we look at the rest 
of the world, there are still some nations that have not signed 
the treaty. Many of these nations have taken the position that 
they will not sign the treaty because it is "unfair." We also 
suspect that some nations are developing their own nuclear 
weapons. And some nations do not comply faithfully with the 
treaty even though they have signed it. These kinds of problems 
have been revealed. And with this revelation, the question 
arises whether the treaty is functioning sufficiently in its 
present form. Already the debate has begun. These concerns will 
surely have a major effect on the extension of the treaty that 
is coming up in 1995. 
  Well-informed persons have been discussing the question of 
how Japan should respond to the extension issue, and today it is 
widely discussed. Opinions are gradually converging that Japan 
should agree to an "unlimited extension" as a major premise. If 
we do so, then we will face the problem of whether the IAEA 
nuclear non-proliferation structure is acceptable in its present 
form. I think it is commonly held worldwide that the present 
form is not perfect, and Japan must figue out how to respond to 
the kinds of problems I have described. 
  Of course, we must realize that Japan is in a special 
position because we are a country without nuclear weapons, but 
by adopting the course of reprocessing and plutonium utilization 
we end up on the far right of the political spectrum. In the 
past, Japan and the former West Germany were together on this, 
but Germany has withdrawn slightly from that path, whereas Japan 
is attempting to hold fast. We are concerned with how this will 
affect public opinion worldwide, and I think it is a very 
important problem. 
<H5>  Contribution of Peaceful Utilization Technology </H5>
  Sakai: The Japanese Government should emphasize 
Article 4 of the NPT that recognizes the right of countries 
without nuclear weapons to utilize atomic energy for peaceful 
purposes; in other words, excessive restrictions shall not be 
placed on peaceful utilization. After all, PNC has already made 
a major contribution to the world in technological development 
for the peaceful utilization of atomic energy with the TASTEX 
(Advanced Safeguard Technology Demonstrations [literal]) Project 
that included Japan, France, and four IAEA members conducted at 
the Tokai Reprocessing Plant at the beginning of President 
Carter's nuclear non-proliferation policy in 1977, the JASPAS 
(Japan Support Program for Agency Safeguards) Project, etc. 
  Ishiwatari: Just as you have pointed out, we plan 
to continue along this path in the future. A minute ago you said 
that Japan has a special position as a nation that does not 
possess nuclear weapons but is pursuing reprocessing and 
plutonium utilization. That is the position we have to take. 
Japan is the most appropriate nation in the world for pursuing 
this policy, and if Japan does not do so on her own, we will 
find ourselves in an untenable situation, so I think we ought to 
put much more effort into this than we have in the past. 
  Not only that, there are nations that are not part of the 
IAEA structure and other nations that do belong, but raise our 
suspicions because they conceal what they are doing. Technology 
cannot deal with these cases, and the basis for progress must be 
international diplomacy. I think that Japan ought to do her part 
on this front as well, and I expect that it will become an issue 
in the future. 
  In retrospect, the PNC team did not realize until 1977 that 
there are so many technological problems to be solved to achieve 
non-proliferation. At that point we became deeply aware of this 
kind of important technological development, and since that time 
we have worked very hard on it. You also pointed out that in the 
future we should use another one of our "weapons," the fruit of 
our efforts since 1977 (see accompanying table) for emphasizing 
Japan's position in the future. I agree with you completely and 
would like to see this done.

  Sakai: With respect to the problem of dismantled 
nuclear weapons as part of the U.S.-Russia move toward 
disarmament, ideas for international control policies have 
appeared such as IPS from the INCFE ([International Nuclear Fuel 
Cycle Evaluation] discussions held from fall 1977 to spring 
1980) and IMR under consideration by the IAEA so that plutonium 
from dismantled weapons does not have an adverse effect on 
peaceful utilization. 
  Ishiwatari: I recognize that this problem should 
be discussed from the standpoint of government rather than PNC. 
Because I am involved somewhat I have made a few observations, 
and basically I believe that the plutonium problems accompanying 
nuclear disarmament should be solved by countries with nuclear 
weapons in disarmament negotiations. 
  Many plans have come about as a result of these discussions. 
There are issues such as where the plutonium should be stored 
temporarily, what measures should be taken so that it cannot be 
reused for weapons, and looking farther down the road, whether 
it should be converted to peaceful uses. The debate has not yet 
begun, but at this stage a proposal for converting plutonium 
from dismantled nuclear weapons to peaceful uses has been 
circulated, and that proposal touches upon the peaceful 
utilization policy that Japan is presently pursuing. One point 
of contact will be through technology, and we must also deal 
with the problem of whether this additional plutonium will upset 
the balance of total plutonium supply and demand. 
  My own feeling is that the plutonium supply and demand 
balance will not be upset in the near future even if we add the 
plutonium removed from dismantled weapons. Weapon dismantling 
will not proceed all at once, so the plutonium used in those 
weapons will probably appear a little bit at a time under the 
guise of "excess plutonium." Therefore, I think it will be 
impossible for a large amount of plutonium from dismantled 
weapons to flood the peaceful utilization market all at once. In 
any event, if we do proceed with peaceful utilization, I expect 
that as a nation pursuing the peaceful utilization of plutonium 
we will end up cooperating with other nations in terms of 
technology and the market. I think that the technological 
developments we have made thus far will be sufficiently helpful. 
  Sakai: Early last year the media reported on a 
plan to provide cooperation in design technology for 
construction of a dedicated combustion reactor (FR) to burn 
plutonium in the former Soviet Union. 
  Ishiwatari: In fact, that may be possible, but a 
major premise is that the main framework will be determined in 
discussions between the two nuclear superpowers, and if they 
approve a policy of converting plutonium from dismantled weapons 
to peaceful uses, then we will have an opportunity to make a 
contribution. 
<H5>  New Long Term Plan Hearings and 25 Years of FBR Development </H5>
  Sakai: Turning to domestic problems, let us begin 
with the Atomic Energy Commission's hearings to revise the Long 
Term Plan. The hearings formally began on 2 September last year, 
but the report by the FBR Expert Subcommittee, upon which the 
plan is contingent, has fallen far behind the reports in other 
fields. More than a year has passed and finally it appears this 
report will be submitted to the Long Term Plan Expert 
Subcommittee. It seems that the role of FBR commercialization 
R&amp;D and its obligations will become very great. 
  Sakai: I worked on the Long Term Plan revision in 
1987, so I think I am well aware of the differences between then 
and now in the discussions. I sense a "change in the air" 
between the discussions then and those today. Essentially, each 
time has its own major trends, and we must make decisions based 
on what we believe at the present time. 
  You mentioned the role of PNC, so let me explain it this 
way. 
A pendulum swings back and forth over the course of time, and if 
you look at the bob from the side it has swung away from, it 
appears very far away, but if you look at it from a fixed point 
in the center, you note that it is merely swinging back and 
forth. The discussions will not make any progress if all the 
people involved do not acknowledge this. They should proceed 
with discussions well aware of where today's fixed point is and 
move toward a conclusion. 
  With this idea in mind, I can explain the role that the 
organization called PNC should play. When I was involved in the 
revision, the government's part meant PNC's part. We all 
recognize that PNC is still the major player today as well. As 
long as we proceed along the path of recycling and utilization 
of plutonium, PNC will take on the job of R&amp;D to establish 
the 
FBR system and prepare for its future commercialization. 
Therefore, we would find it odd if PNC's role has changed 
substantially or in some way behind the scenes. It would be 
strange to think that things are that much different today. PNC 
should understand that Japan has been swinging back and forth 
around the fixed axis in the center. By looking at the big 
picture, PNC can accurately recognize its role and determine its 
position. 
  PNC itself has changed greatly since 1987. Monju has been 
completed, and we are approaching criticality in the near 
future. The prototype reactor built with Japanese technology 
will soon reach criticality and full-fledged operational status 
is drawing near. During this period, PNC has compiled a large 
amount of technology. If we present our position to the 
committee based on these accomplishments, I believe the role 
that PNC should play will be determined automatically from those 
discussions. 
  Sakai: There is also the problem of criticality at 
Monju being delayed until next spring. When we consider the 
trouble with the fuel pellet continuous sintering furnace that 
occurred this June, I think that nuclear power industry should 
accept it as a lesson from the school of hard knocks that truly 
reveals the reactor and the fuel cycle as two sides of the same 
coin. 
  Ishiwatari: I must admit that in the past the 
orders to make a certain kind of fuel were dictated by the 
reactor design, and the fuel cycle was considered merely 
something that went along with it. Recently, however, the fuel 
cycle has also come to dictate specifications, and we have felt 
for some time that the best situation is to deal with the system 
as a whole. Each area proceeds with its R&amp;D under this 
premise. 
We all thought we were moving along the same path, but the 
trouble with the sintering furnace has sent a clear message and 
made us doubly aware of what can happen. Although the reactor 
still occupies the central position in the whole cycle, our 
R&amp;D 
must take the approach that the system must proceed as a whole. 
Naturally, this should be the case with commercialization as 
well, and we must hold fast to this approach in the future. 
  Sakai: One of our reporters recently toured Monju, 
and after he returned he said that what impressed him the most 
was a total of 160 people for operation and maintenance, 80 from 
the electric power industry and 80 from PNC, were making 
preparations to begin operation. Although people from the 
electric power industry may be there on temporary assignment, 10 
of them have been at Monju for more than four years, and they 
are bursting with pioneer spirit. 
  Ishiwatari: Basically, we finished construction on 
the Monju facility and have been running various kinds of tests 
since the end of last year to prepare for criticality. In the 
past there were many people from the electric power industry who 
worked with us at the O-arai Engineering Center and at the Monju 
construction site. Everyone was happy because reports indicated 
that this relationship was working out very well. I am deeply 
moved when people from the power industry say to me, "As an 
engineer, that was the best time of my life." We held a big 
get-together for the people from the electric power industry and 
let them tour Monju. Of course, I am not suggesting that they 
are not happy in their present assignments, but it is 
heart-warming to hear those words from the mouths of career 
engineers. 
<H5>  Japanese Approach to High Level Waste Disposal </H5>
  Sakai: Moving on to the question of policies to 
dispose of high-level radioactive waste, the Expert Subcommittee 
Report issued last summer clearly separated disposal into R&amp;D 
and an "implementation organization." I think that the 
Geological Disposal Basic Research Facility that was recently 
completed at Tokai Village should be used not only for R&amp;D, 
but 
also for the benefit of society. 
  Ishiwatari: Japan's policy is geological disposal, 
and PNC has been tabbed as the core organization for R&amp;D in 
that 
field. We must conduct research on the layers of the earth's 
crust. We must also do research on natural and artificial 
barriers. Psychologically, Japanese people have a lingering 
mistrust of the earth's crust far below the surface where they 
live. And not without reason, because we have suffered through a 
long history of destructive earthquakes, and if you dig down a 
little, the water just gushes out. Therefore, our perception is 
particularly strong that we are living on top of a very unstable 
crust, and most people carry that image around in the back of 
their minds. 
  On the other hand, when we look at countries like Canada, 
Sweden, and Switzerland where geological disposal is proceeding 
smoothly, one thing the people have in common is a feeling of 
trust toward the earth's crust underneath their dwellings. 
Because they believe that they are living on a firm foundation 
of bedrock, they genuinely feel that burying waste deep in the 
strong crust of the earth is safe. I am deeply aware of the 
disparity between Japan and other countries. 
  Although it is not true for all of Japan, there are parts of 
the earth's crust in Japan as well that will be stable for the 
next 10,000 or 100,000 years. We must find these places and 
demonstrate with scientific proof that they are stable. We must 
build a foundation by first doing the research, then 
demonstrating that there are dependable areas of the earth's 
crust under Japan where we can dispose of the waste. 
  The new facility at Tokai Village can adequately carry out 
the R&amp;D, and with this in mind we have also made a provision 
in 
our budget for changing the title of the Chubu Works division, 
which has been doing research on the earth's crust under Japan, 
to the Tono Center. Geological disposal is something for the 
distant future, but sound research on the basics will occupy a 
central position. We will build a recreation of the earth's 
crust above ground at Tokai Village to reflect this data and 
proceed with various kinds of research. These two interconnected 
R&amp;D projects will form the foundation for the future. After 
that 
we plan to move on to more specific projects. 
  We are talking now about many years in the future, but we 
want to proceed with R&amp;D in the fields PNC is responsible 
for so 
that we are ready when the time comes to implement geological 
disposal, and I think we can make it. When the time comes for 
implementation and we begin to ask whether there is any good 
location for geological disposal or not, the whole issue will be 
moot without reliable data. 
  Sakai: As you have just suggested, I think it will 
be extremely persuasive if you compile various data and process 
it with a supercomputer, display the results on a large screen, 
highlight the "disposal sites" on the large screen, and indicate 
whatever problems, etc., might be encountered. 
  Ishiwatari: We constructed the new facility at 
Tokai Village with the approach that geological disposal could 
not be built on chance, and had to be put together bit by bit 
from the ground up if we were to obtain consensus. More 
specifically, since the true mission of the facility is R&amp;D, 
it 
must perform that well. I think that based on its achievements, 
it will be called on later to act as the "implementation 
organization" that will actually be in charge of geological 
disposal. 
<H5>  Expectations for Atomic Energy Commission and Interpreting </H5>
U.S. Government Policy 
  Sakai: Finally, it appears that the electric power 
industry is beginning to consider building a domestic production 
system for the MOX fuels needed for plutonium utilization and 
plutonium thermal use. 
  Ishiwatari: After the reprocessing plant at 
Rokkasho Village starts up, we definitely must have MOX 
processing equipment to act as a "receiver" for the plutonium 
that it produces. This is a job for the electric power industry, 
but it is only natural that they turn to PNC for the technology, 
and I believe we must respond to their expectations. We had 
quite a struggle making fuel for Fugen, Joyo, and Monju, but 
through that hard work and experience we have reached a rather 
high level, technologically speaking. 
  Although the building has already been completed for the new 
ATR line, I am sorry to say that the inside is not ready. This 
is due to its relationship with the site for the Electric Power 
Development Company's "Oma Reactor." Because the No. 2 
Development Lab ATR line is getting rather old, instead of 
renovating it we have a provision in next year's budget to 
replace it with the ATR line in the No. 3 Development Lab on the 
same scale. After it starts up we will abandon the No. 2 
Development Lab, and the ATR line in the No. 3 Development Lab 
will begin operation, albeit on a small scale. In the meantime, 
if there is progress with the Electric Power Development 
Company's ATR demonstration reactor project (Oma Reactor), we 
will expand the line. 
  Another advantage will be that if, for example, the electric 
power industry looks at this line as a site for technology 
transfer so they can manufacture MOX fuel for plutonium 
utilization, we will also be ready to respond. In any event, we 
have requested a budget to set up the No. 3 Development Lab ATR 
line with these kinds of future prospects in mind. It will be on 
a small scale of about 10 tons, but we definitely want to go 
through with it. If the No. 2 Development Lab line breaks down, 
we will not be able to make fuel for Fugen. So we have this 
practical problem to deal with, and we are in the process of 
solving it. 
  In the area of fuels we have already transferred enrichment 
technology to the electric power industry. We are also 
transferring reprocessing technology in a variety of forms, but 
speaking from these experiences, transfer of fuel manufacturing 
technology will be more complex, and we expect it to take a lot 
of time and effort. Therefore, we must discuss this thoroughly 
with the electric power industry to arrange for a long-term, 
"systematic transfer of technology" and a mechanism for doing so. 
  Sakai: When we look at the track record of the 
Atomic Energy Commission, Japan finally joined the NPT in 1976 
after six years of debate. Looking back over the way government 
policy has unfolded during the last 37 years with the Japan-U.S. 
reprocessing negotiations in 1977, and the "riot" caused by 
bringing in the CANDU (Canadian-made deuterium reactor), 
thereafter, the Atomic Energy Commission has undergone "a 
baptism by fire." Because the new Long Term Plan must be 
formulated in the midst of a very fluid international situation, 
this will also be a "baptism by fire." Since you were once in 
their shoes, what are your hopes and expectations for the Atomic 
Energy Commission and the Long Term Plan Expert Subcommittee? 
  Ishiwatari: Times have changed, and on a large 
scale the government itself is undergoing a lot of change. A 
certain powerful political leader has stated emphatically that 
in this kind of situation it may be dangerous to demonstrate 
leadership, but it is even more dangerous not to, and I 
completely agree with him. Therefore, I hope they will take my 
opinions under consideration. 
  Sakai: That is the final wish of professor Hiromi 
Arisawa, who passed away on 7 March 1988. He was constantly 
seeking leadership in saying, "At any specific time people on 
the Atomic Energy Commission should approach their job with the 
attitude that they `carry their resignation letter in their 
pocket.'" 
  Ishiwatari: I hate to change the subject, but I 
would like to say one thing about plutonium from dismantled 
weapons. In the U.S. they refer to it as "excess plutonium," and 
a person near the top of the executive branch of the U.S. 
Government said they would like to study a little more what the 
phrase "excess plutonium" means. I thought a lot about what he 
implied, and one way of interpreting it, although it may be my 
personal bias, is that plutonium intended for peaceful 
utilization "is not excess plutonium because it has a use." The 
U.S. government clearly considers plutonium from dismantled 
weapons to be excess plutonium. However, there is a chance we 
will have an excess of plutonium in the field of peaceful 
utilization as well. That has already happened to some extent in 
the UK, and I have gradually come to understand that somehow or 
other those in charge of nuclear non-proliferation in the U.S. 
Government feel that an excess of plutonium might crop up here 
too. 
  Japan must understand that people in the U.S. Government 
view 
themselves as "guardians of the world against nuclear 
proliferation." If we invite misunderstanding and debate whether 
the total amount of plutonium we possess might contain an excess 
if we consider all the plutonium together, it will be a policy 
disaster. We must review things when we reach the stage where we 
are ready to mix it into the fuel. If, from the start, we debate 
whether all the plutonium should all be taken together, we will 
just invite confusion. We must carefully study what we should 
include and in what manner when we reach the stage of mixing it 
into fuel. If we do not, it will be a great obstacle to 
executing government policy in Japan. Recently, this has really 
struck home with me. 
  Sakai: Thank you very much for talking with us 
today.

  [Text] The new Long Term Plan for Atomic Energy Development 
and Utilization, which has undergone several revision hearings 
by the Atomic Energy Commission, makes projections into the 
second half of the 21st century. One of the most important 
issues is forming a government policy on the disposal of 
high-level radioactive wastes as a completion of the nuclear 
power generation cycle. A new facility owned by PNC, the central 
organization in developing this technology, has been completed 
at Tokai Village, Ibaraki Prefecture, and full-fledged testing 
and research began there at the end of October. 
  Called the "Geological Disposal Basic Research Facility," it 
will conduct simulation testing above ground on the deep 
geological disposal of high-level waste. The facility cost about 
&yen;3.2 billion to complete. The site will recreate above 
ground a deep geological environment several hundred meters 
below the surface where we plan to dispose of the waste and 
compile data to corroborate an assurance of safety for several 
thousand years. 
  PNC has already conducted tests and experiments for several 
years on the movement of underground water in bedrock and the 
amount of radioactivity leaching out of vitrified vessels at the 
Tono Mines (sedimentary rock layer) in Gifu Prefecture, at the 
Kamaishi Mines (crystalline schist layer) in Iwate Prefecture 
and at the Radioactive Materials Handling Facility at Tokai 
Village. This data will be compiled on computers at the new 
Geological Disposal Basic Research Facility allowing researchers 
to follow the historical changes over many years in that "world 
of darkness" far below the surface. 
  More specifically, using the latest computer graphics 
technology researchers can display high-level waste underground 
disposal sites on a large screen, can intentionally cause 
trouble such as earthquakes, and visualize the effects. Together 
with the unveiling of this ambitious R&amp;D facility, PNC held 
an 
international workshop for four days until 18 November for 120 
participants including about 20 specialists from the U.S., UK, 
France, Switzerland, Sweden, Canada, and Belgium, and these 
experts held discussions based on the images shown on the large 
screen. 
<H5>  Sealing Effects Learned From Many Years of Research and </H5>
Testing 
  Before introducing the details on this new facility that 
consists of a one-story Testing Wing (floor space about 1500 
m[.sup]2[/]) and a four-story Research Wing (floor space 
about 4500 m[.sup]2[/]), I will briefly discuss the results 
of several years of R&amp;D. 
  The high level liquid waste produced when recycling spent 
fuel will be surrounded by three layers (artificial barriers) 
and buried deep underground. First, the hot soup that contains 
intense radioactivity is melted together with borosilicate 
glass, which can withstand high heat, and solidified in a 
stainless steel cylinder (canister). This is called 
"vitrification," and it forms the first barrier. 
  Next, because this vitrified body will generate heat due to 
radioactive decay, it will be stored and cooled down in an 
above-ground facility for 30-50 years. After that the waste will 
actually be buried deep underground, and at that time it will be 
enclosed in a metal protective container (overpack), which forms 
the second barrier. Finally, it will be packed in a 
shock-absorbing material (bentonite, a type of clay, is a good 
candidate) that will lie between the container and the bedrock 
and form the third barrier. Underground water will not easily 
permeate the bentonite, and it will act as a protective mattress 
against geological pressure from the bedrock and earthquakes. 
Research has revealed the following information. 
  First Barrier 
  Vitrification acts to prevent radioactivity from leaching 
out 
into underground water. The scientific approach that supports 
this makes use of research on similar natural phenomena (natural 
analogs). The basalt glass that came to the surface during 
ancient eruptions on the Izu Peninsula and Mt. Fuji is 
physically and chemically similar to the borosilicate glass used 
in vitrification. 
  The rate of decomposition of this volcanic glass due to 
exposure to underground water over the past 2800 years or so is 
only a few microns per 1000 years, and when we look at its 
surface magnified more than 20,000 times with a scanning 
electron microscope, we see only a very thin voided layer where 
the atoms have escaped. The decomposition rate of borosilicate 
glass has been observed to be about 10 times as fast. (At this 
rate, we can make a simple calculation that radioactivity may 
first escape from a vitrified body between 100,000 to 1,000,000 
years in the future.) 
  An interesting result was obtained in this natural analog 
research quite recently by analyzing basalt glass collected from 
a layer of mudstone at Kamogawa City, Chiba Prefecture. This 
band lay at the bottom of the sea in prehistoric times, but over 
time it was lifted up and became dry land. This basalt glass 
that was collected came from a volcanic eruption several million 
years ago, and perhaps because it was enclosed in mud for such a 
long, long time, its surface showed almost no decomposition 
(voiding) when examined by SEM. 
  Second Barrier 
  For the overpack, the primary candidate is a container made 
of carbon steel. Studies of worst-case estimates show a 
corrosion progression of about 3 cm per 1000 years. The 
protective overpack wall is 30 cm thick, and it acts to resist 
geological pressures, so there is sufficient leeway in terms of 
corrosion. Recently the amount of water leaking from pipes in 
downtown Tokyo due to corrosion has reached a level where it can 
no longer be ignored, but this leakage is due to cracks 
generated by oxidation from oxygen in the soil. On the other 
hand, the environment deep underground is almost "oxygen free," 
and corrosion will not progress as it does on the earth's 
surface. 
  In the future researchers will verify whether the hydrogen 
gas generated in the corrosion reactions will form a protective 
layer on the surface of the overpack and serve as a 
"reinforcement" to keep underground water from penetrating or 
whether it will disperse into the earth's crust. This is one 
question the Testing Wing of the new facility will attempt to 
answer. 
  Third Barrier 
  It has been confirmed that at temperatures of 100ëC or 
less bentonite shows almost no decomposition and will serve to 
inhibit the movement of radioactivity. During deep underground 
burial this clay will be packed between the underground rock and 
the overpack at thicknesses ranging from several centimeters to 
one meter. Because the total weight of a canister and overpack 
is almost 12 tons, is there a chance it might sink? Analysis has 
already shown that it will sink about 1mm, but this still needs 
to be confirmed. 
  On the other hand, because bentonite is clay, will it turn 
to 
mud when it comes in contact with underground water and be 
stripped away? There is some data that shows it will not strip 
away unless the underground water is flowing fast at a large 
volume. Answering these questions will be another issue 
addressed by the Testing Wing of the new facility. 
<H5>  Making a Model With Data From Repetitive Testing </H5>
  Aside from these future issues, if we look at PNC's 
achievements over many years of testing and experiments, we 
reach the conclusion that the lifetime of the three barrier 
layers (artificial barriers) will surpass the 1000 years or so 
needed to reduce the level of radioactivity in high level waste. 
The Radioactive Waste Policy Expert Subcommittee of the Atomic 
Energy Commission checked this out and on 21 July this year 
pronounced the results "generally valid." The subcommittee 
pointed out that expansion and consolidation of data, and 
improvement of artificial barrier reliability should form the 
main thrust of future research. In response, various tests were 
begun at the end of October at the new facility. Researchers 
will work on deep underground geology based on new data and a 
"disposal model" that can make scientific predictions far into 
the future. 
  Estimating above ground the behavior of the "world of 
darkness" several hundred meters below and predicting what will 
occur over the next several thousand years are concepts 
difficult to grasp for the majority of people in their everyday 
lives. It is possible, however, to make predictions using 
scientific methods. By using our new knowledge about the 
performance of the materials that comprise the triple layer of 
artificial barriers, our previous knowledge from earth science 
about natural barriers in underground rock, and natural analog 
research that has told us the basalt glass collected at Kamogawa 
City, Chiba Prefecture, suffered almost no decomposition over 
several million years, we can assemble a "disposal model" and 
predict events far, far into the future where we ourselves 
cannot go. 
  Right now the R&amp;D methods for high level waste disposal 
are 
having a positive effect in other fields. For example, a 
symposium under the title "Long Term Corrosion Prediction and 
Countermeasures" was held this year in May at the annual 
convention of the Corrosion and Anti-Oxidation Society 
[literal], and representatives from PNC reported their results. 
In the past, the design concepts for structures such as bridges 
stretched less than 100 years into the future, but now the idea 
of "utilizing deep underground principles" has caught on, and it 
will be necessary to design structures that will last more than 
100 years, or even 1000 years into the future. 
  "Improving artificial barrier reliability" was one goal 
suggested by the Atomic Energy Commission's Expert Subcommittee. 
The Geological Disposal Basic Research Facility will compile 
data to build a more scientific "disposal model," and over time 
that model will get closer and closer to reality. 
<H5>  Visualization of Test Data and Report in Seven Years </H5>
  The Testing Wing is a large, open area like a school gym 
where various kinds of testing equipment are installed. The wing 
has a 2.8 ton overhead crane to handle real boulders. The main 
equipment includes the following devices. To analyze the 
movement of underground water in various layers of porous rock 
such as sedimentary rock, mudstone, sand/gravel rock, etc., 
there is a Porous Medium Hydrological Testing Apparatus that 
uses colored water. Granite (crystalline rock) originally 
contains very fine fissures, and because it is a candidate layer 
of bedrock for geological disposal, researchers will bring in 
granite blocks, add pressure to simulate the geological pressure 
environment at 500-1000 meters underground, and use the Fissured 
Medium Hydrological Testing Apparatus to analyze the movement of 
underground water in granite. There is also a Hydrogen Gas 
Behavior Testing Apparatus to follow the movement of hydrogen 
gas generated in the corrosion reactions noted above. The wing 
also has an Underground Water Property Forming Process Testing 
Apparatus to analyze what conditions determine the properties of 
water deep underground. Finally, there is the Cushioning 
Material Outflow Testing Apparatus to determine how much 
bentonite will be stripped away by underground water. 
  In the room next door there is the Chemical Equilibrium 
Reaction Testing Apparatus that will be used to recreate above 
ground the environment of bedrock in geological disposal sites 
several hundred meters underground. It immediately captures your 
imagination. It has a row of hermetically sealed steel boxes 
that contain oxygen and carbon dioxide at less than 0.1 ppm to 
create an almost completely "oxygen free" environment. 
Researchers use built-in gloves to introduce the materials that 
comprise the three barriers--borosilicate glass, carbon steel, 
and bentonite--and simulated underground water into the boxes. 
The device then performs detailed analysis of changes due to 
chemical reactions between the water and the materials. 
  The data from this Testing Wing plus the test data from the 
Tono Mines, Kamaishi Mines, etc., is sent to the Computer and 
Data Department on the third floor of the neighboring Research 
Wing. There the data is input into high performance computers 
and compiled in databases. A "disposal model" can be built by 
processing these various kinds of data on the computer. 
Recently, the data has been processed with computer graphic 
technology that is used in various fields to visualize the 
results. The results can be displayed on a giant 110-inch screen 
at the podium in the 120 seat conference room located on the 
fourth floor of this same Research Wing. 
  The electric power industry, which has the "producer's 
responsibility" to dispose of high level waste, has begun 
preparations for setting up a disposal implementation 
organization by the year 2000. This disposal implementation 
organization will be responsible for the design and construction 
of the actual disposal sites, but PNC will provide the technical 
support. Therefore, PNC is creating a more scientific "disposal 
model" based on the data obtained at the new facility over the 
upcoming seven years. By the year 2000 PNC will submit a report 
to the Atomic Energy Commission entitled "A Quantitative 
Evaluation of Artificial Barriers."

  [Text] As previously reported, the 1993 edition of the 
Nuclear Power Safety White Paper was released on 30 November. 
The special collection in this year's white paper is "Ensuring 
Safety Regarding the Use of Plutonium in Nuclear Reactor 
Facilities." Following last year's special collection, "Ensuring 
the Safety of the Nuclear Fuel Cycle," the white paper is 
expressing the concept that the safety of the fuel cycle and 
nuclear reactor facilities is being adequately ensured. Just how 
was the evaluation of the safety of fast-breeder reactors (FBR), 
one type of nuclear reactor facility, carried out? This article 
will present an outline of the description of the "Monju" 
reactor, which was given as an example. 
<H5>  "Monju" Safety Investigation </H5>
  We will explain, particularly, the special aspects of 
"Monju" 
with regard to just what type of investigation was carried out 
as part of the Nuclear Power Safety Committee's double check on 
each of the following points: 1) site conditions, 2) nuclear 
power facility safety design, 3) evaluation of exposure dose 
during normal operating periods, 4) safety design evaluation, 
and 5) site evaluation, as well as whether or not it was 
confirmed that there were no problems with regard to safety 
assurance. 
  Moreover, "Monju" has many unique characteristics which 
differ from light-water reactors, such as: 

  -  it was designed 
to operate at low pressure, but at high temperature, because it 
utilizes sodium (which has a high boiling point) as a coolant; 
  -  because it is a reactor which uses MOX fuel and has a reactor 
core which uses fast neutrons in its reaction, thus giving it 
the ability to breed, the reactor's output density and burnup 
rates are high; and, 
  -  a cover gas exists above the surface of 
liquid sodium. 

    While giving adequate considerations to these particular 
characteristics, an investigation was carried out into the 
appropriateness of the safety design and into the safety 
evaluation, based on previous experience operating FBRs and the 
results of research and development. 
<H5>  Nuclear Reactor Facility Safety Design </H5>
  (1) Nuclear Reactor Facility--General 
  With regard to the design of construction materials, 
systems, 
and equipment which are important for safety, because this 
reactor uses sodium (a high-temperature liquid metal) as a 
coolant, there are areas in the design which exceed the 
operational parameters used for light-water reactors. In such 
areas, it was decided to use a structure design policy that was 
created in consideration of the special characteristics 
associated with sodium reactors, based on factors such as the 
results of domestic experimentation and research and considering 
foreign standards. We confirmed that this basic policy was 
appropriate. 
  Moreover, regarding the chemical activity of sodium, 
countermeasures have been taken, such as covering the surface of 
the liquid sodium with an atmosphere of an inert gas (argon 
gas). Furthermore, in regard to response to and burnup reaction 
caused by leakage of the sodium, adequate measures have been 
devised with regard to leak detection, burnup control, and the 
minimization of thermal effects. We confirmed that the basic 
policy was one which was designed so that the safety functions 
of construction materials, systems, and equipment important to 
safety were not harmed by the use of sodium. 
  (2) Aseismatic Design 
  Nuclear reactors are facilities which need to have adequate 
earthquake-proofing to respond to the strongest possible 
earthquakes conceivable. Therefore, we confirmed that, along 
with carrying out a classification based on importance for 
earthquake-proofing of facilities, systems, and equipment 
important for safety, the facility was designed being able to 
withstand the maximum calculated possible earthquake. This 
calculation was based on factors such as a review of the records 
of previous earthquakes in the region of the facility and of 
surrounding regions, as well as a study of the region itself. 
Moreover, bearing in mind the nature of the sodium, which is 
used as coolant, we confirmed that the internal storage unit for 
the large volume of liquid sodium was classified appropriately 
in terms of aseismatic design. 
  (3) Important Systems and Equipment for the Safety of 
Nuclear 
Reactor Facilities 
  Regarding the nuclear reactor, considering the fact that it 
utilizes MOX fuel, sodium coolant, and high-speed neutrons, we 
confirmed that: 

  -  even though it was probable that, in the 
case of a sodium void, the reaction coefficient in the 
inner-reactor core would be positive, countermeasures for 
contingencies such as the prevention of sodium boiling were 
adequately thought out. Moreover, because of factors such as the 
reactor's output power coefficient being designed to possess the 
special characteristic of negative feedback (unique safety) and 
because the reactor was designed so that, even in a situation 
where the control rod which exerts the greatest influence over 
the rate of reaction could not be inserted, the reactor core 
could still be maintained within operational limits, we 
determined that the nuclear reactor's design was appropriate. 
  -  Considering the fuel burnup and the control rod insertion 
conditions, given facts such as, even in a situation 
anticipating power distribution during a state of maximum heat 
generation in each sphere, the fuel's maximum temperature would 
remain below its melting point, we determined that the fuel was 
sound and, additionally, that the temperature of the sodium 
coolant would remain below its boiling point. Therefore, we 
confirmed that the design of the nuclear reactor's thermal flow 
power was appropriate. 

    Regarding the instrumentation control system, we confirmed 
that this system was designed in a manner so that it could, 
during periods of both normal operations and abnormal 
transitional changes, operate to ensure the soundness of the 
nuclear reactor and other facilities, along with being able to 
monitor and/or regulate important parameters such as the 
temperature and flow rates in the primary and secondary coolant 
systems, the particle fluence rate, the liquid state of the 
sodium in the reactor vessel, and the temperature of the 
atmosphere beneath the nuclear reactor container floor, also 
maintaining these parameters within appropriate operational 
bounds. 
  Furthermore, we confirmed that the system was designed so 
that, even during accidents, it could be able to continuously 
monitor and record the temperature in the atmosphere beneath the 
nuclear reactor housing vessel floor and measure and monitor the 
density of radioactive materials within the primary argon gas 
system and in the nuclear reactor housing vessel. 
  Regarding the nuclear reactor's coolant system, we confirmed 
that it would be able to appropriately cool the reactor core 
during both normal operations and abnormal operational 
transitional changes, as well as during an accident. Along with 
that, it was considered highly unlikely that the nuclear 
reactor's coolant boundary (which acts as a barrier preventing 
radioactive substances in the primary coolant etc. from leaking 
to the outside) could be damaged. In other words, it was 
confirmed that: 

  -  the machinery and piping that make up the 
nuclear reactor's coolant boundary were designed, bearing in 
mind the nature of the sodium coolant which is used in the 
reactor (that functions under low pressure but with high 
temperatures), with appropriate consideration given to the 
material's special characteristics, including creep and factors 
such as their transitional thermal response power. Further, the 
system was designed so that, even during the period in which 
materials were supplied, important parts underwent regular 
necessary inspections; and, 
  -  even during a leak of the primary 
coolant, the plant was designed so that there would be no 
hindrance to the circulation of the primary coolant through 
measures such as the placing of primary coolant (which is 
essential for the reactor) in a guard vessel, which has adequate 
capacity for the reactor vessel and other systems. Furthermore, 
the system was designed so that, even during the period in which 
materials such as the reactor vessel and the guard vessel were 
supplied, important parts underwent regular necessary 
inspections. 

    Moreover, we also confirmed things such as: 

  -  the 
secondary coolant system is designed such that leaks from the 
primary coolant system to the secondary coolant system are 
restrained by maintaining the pressure in the secondary coolant 
system higher than that found in the primary system. 
Furthermore, even in cases where water/vapor leaks into the 
secondary coolant system because of damage to the steam 
generator heat transfer piping, the system has been designed to 
prevent the buildup of excessive pressure in the secondary 
coolant system through the automatic high-speed blowing 
operation of internal water and steam and through the 
installation of equipment to store the sodium/water reactive 
substance, and 
  -  in order to prevent solidification of the sodium 
in the primary or secondary coolant systems caused by excessive 
cooling, the system was designed to include emergency heating 
units. Even during periods when the reactor is shut down, the 
temperature of the sodium can be maintained at around 180ëC 
(the melting point of sodium is around 100ëC). 

    Regarding the reactor container, we confirmed that, 
considering situations such as a primary coolant leak accident, 
it could withstand the temperatures and pressures that would be 
produced by the release of the maximum possible amount of 
energy, and that its soundness would be able to be maintained 
without exceeding the fixed leak rate. 
<H5>  Evaluation of Exposure Dose During Periods of Normal </H5>
Operations [omitted] 
<H5>  Evaluation of the Safety Design </H5>
  (1) Analysis of Abnormal Transitional Changes During Reactor 
Operation 
  Regarding reactor operation, we confirmed that the analysis 
and estimates were appropriately performed on the following 
selected unusual transitional phenomena which could be caused by 
factors such as the possible simple breakage of equipment during 
the life-span of the nuclear reactor which could, at its worst, 
lead to malfunction, or simple operator error: 1. abnormal 
changes in the reaction rates or power distribution within the 
reactor core; 2. abnormal heat generation in, or heat removal 
from, the reactor core, and 3. phenomena associated with a 
chemical reaction of sodium. 
  Further, we confirmed that the standard used for making this 
evaluation was appropriate; namely, that in order for there to 
be no excessive damage to the fuel or the nuclear reactor 
coolant boundary, none of the following temperatures be 
exceeded: 

  -  the temperature in the heart of the thick fuel 
cladding would be less than 830ëC, 
  -  the temperature of the 
sodium in the reactor core would not reach its boiling point, 
  -  the temperature in the reactor coolant boundary be 600ëC, 
and 
  -  that the temperature never exceed 1.4 times the maximum 
operating temperature. 

    Therefore, as a result of the analysis/evaluation regarding 
any conceived abnormal transitional changes during reactor 
operation, we confirmed that any phenomenon could be resolved 
and the reactor could be returned to normal operational status 
before any damage could be caused to the reactor core or to the 
reactor's coolant boundary. 
  (2) Accident Analysis 
  There are cases of abnormal situations occurring which 
exceed 
those considered under "Abnormal Transitional Changes During 
Reactor Operation," even though it is thought that the frequency 
of such events occurring would be extremely small. The phenomena 
which must be considered from the point of view of evaluating 
the soundness of the reactor facility and the possibility of 
release of radioactive materials from the reactor into the 
surrounding environment, are: 1. an increase of the reaction 
rate within the reactor core; 2. a reduction in the 
functionality of the coolant in the reactor core; 3. an accident 
occurring connected with the handling of the fuel; 4. an 
accident connected with the waste-processing facility; 5. a 
sodium chemical reaction, and 6. an accident associated with the 
reactor cover gas system. We confirmed that the 
analysis/evaluations performed in such cases were appropriate. 
  We determined that the standard used for making this 
evaluation was appropriate. This standard was: 1. that no major 
damage occur to the reactor core, and that adequate cooling was 
still possible; 2. that the reactor container's leak rate remain 
below specified values (the temperature and pressure at the 
reactor container boundary be below the maximum operating 
temperature and pressure); 3. that the temperature of the 
reactor coolant boundary remain below 650ëC, and below 1.6 
times the maximum operating temperature, and 4. that such a 
situation would not pose a risk of significant radiation 
exposure to the surrounding public. 
  Moreover, we confirmed that, given the fact that the coolant 
used in the "Monju" reactor is sodium, adequate consideration 
and analysis was given to factors such as the probable positive 
reaction rates in the inner reactor core in case of sodium void 
and the impact of a burnup reaction of the leaked sodium. 
  As a result of this evaluation and analysis of possible 
accidents, we confirmed that an accident would not cause major 
damage to the reactor core or impede the cooling of the reactor 
core. We also confirmed that such an accident would not pose a 
risk of significant exposure to radioactivity to the public 
through the release of radioactive materials into the 
environment. 
  Moreover, in the case of "Monju," in addition to performing 
accident analysis, because our operating experience with 
sodium-cooled FBRs is limited, we considered phenomena that 
would have occurrence frequencies even less than those of 
accidents, but which would have important results, and, as a 
result of analysis/evaluation, confirmed that the release of 
radioactive materials would be adequately controlled.

  [Text] In February of next year, the CRC Research Institute 
is going to deliver a supercomputer system "Cray 92EL" made by 
the U.S. firm Cray Research to Kyoto University's Nuclear Energy 
Research Institute. 
  The CRC Research Institute received this order after it 
participated in a recent general competitive tender for the 
introduction of a computer system for Kyoto University's Nuclear 
Energy Research Institute. This company introduced the first 
supercomputer "Cray-1" into Japan, in 1980, and it has had 
additional experience marketing Cray computers since 1992. 
  The Nuclear Research Institute plans to use this 
supercomputer system to carry out large-scale and high-volume 
scientific and technological computations and for experimental 
research. Scientific and technological computations are to be 
carried out across a wide spectrum of research fields, starting 
with areas connected to nuclear power, such as nuclear reactor 
safety, nuclear power plant operation safety and reliability, 
and nuclear fusion reactor simulation, as well as new quantum 
energy engineering research and man-machine system research 
topics, including the high-precision analysis of boiling heat 
transmission and mixture flow, Beam Engineering simulations, and 
oscillating mechanisms for free-electron lasers. In the area of 
experimental research, this system will be used to perform 
functions such as analyzing and evaluating adaptive interface 
devices which integrate and process various biological 
information, an outer space-type interface which utilizes 
virtual reality, and the design of man-machine systems. 
  The system to be provided is an epoch-making one, which 
brings the functions of a Cray supercomputer to the desk-side. 
In a cabinet 60 cm wide, 66 cm deep, and 104 cm tall, a maximum 
of two processors, each of which has a theoretical maximum 
capacity of 133 MFLOPS, can be installed.

  [Text] The Ministry of Posts and Telecommunications (MPT) 
will establish an experimental high capacity hookup among 
research institutes using a high speed network that carries 60 
times more communications channels than present lines. MPT's 
Communications Research Laboratory (CRL), NTT, KDD, and Japanese 
computer manufacturers will be connected, while MPT will seek 
participation from overseas research institutions. This is an 
effort to compete against the United States which is promoting 
the National Research Education Network (NREN) program that 
links universities and research institutes throughout the United 
States. Both Japan and the United States are developing 
strategies with which to enter the multimedia era by 
establishing communications networks among research institutes 
as the core of their program. 
  This network incorporates the latest ATM (asynchronous 
transfer mode) switchboard which can control a large volume 
optical fiber network capable of carrying information at a 
maximum volume of 10 gigabits per second. Current NTT serviced 
communications lines have a maximum capacity of 150 megabits per 
second. The latest network's capacity is said to improve upon 
this by 66 times. 
  MPT's CRL, Communications Network Research Institute 
(Musashino City, Tokyo), KDD Research Institute (Kamifukuoka 
City, Saitama Prefecture), NHK's Broadcasting Technical Research 
Institute (Setagaya-ku, Tokyo), and the International 
Telecommunications Basic Technology Research Institute (ATR, 
Kyoto) representing a third sector, are to be connected. They 
are expected to be joined in the future by the research 
institutes of computer manufacturers, including NEC, Fujitsu, 
and IBM Japan. 
  The MPT has named this experiment the "Global Gigabit 
Network" (G Net), and plans to expand participation to include 
overseas research organizations using an overseas high speed 
network which KDD shares with AT&amp;T. 
  The G Net will focus on technical experiments concerning the 
operation and maintenance of networks, and development of new 
methods using supercomputers and databases owned by other 
facilities. The new methods will cover a wide area of 
communications including TV conferences through vivid images, 
and remote medical applications through which medical images 
will be transferred over long distances for diagnosis. They also 
plan to include environmental research to analyze air pollution 
and meteorological phenomenon on a global scale. 
  The MPT will spend &yen;488 million, a sum approved in the 
third FY93 supplementary budget, to facilitate computers and 
communication equipment at CRL. NTT will provide free of charge 
large volume optical fibers, while each research organization 
will arrange for their own equipment needs. Meanwhile, the 
participating organizations will form a liaison committee. The 
new network is scheduled to be ready by March 1995.

  [Text] The Nippon Telephone and Telegraph Corporation (NTT) 
announced on December 6 that it has experimentally succeeded in 
storing a large current in a synchrotron radiation (SR) system. 
It stabilized an electron beam in orbit and achieved the world's 
highest level storage ring current of 1,215 milliamperes. 
Productivity can be increased when the radiation is used for 
semiconductor fine processing applications because, the larger 
the current value, the stronger the radiation that can be 
obtained. It is expected that, when the related technologies are 
made ready, processing at a higher speed than that of the 
current ultra-violet exposure method can be done. 
  The experiment was done at a 16.8 meter-circumference 
small-scale system called "Super-ALIS," installed in NTT's LSI 
research facility. An electron beam accelerated to a high speed 
was deflected by superconducting magnets, causing the emission 
of radiation. Up until now, the current value was 500 
milliamperes. This improvement was made by such measures as (1) 
removing the excess electromagnetic field made by electrons that 
had completed the prior orbit and (2) devising the structure of 
the magnets to control the adverse effects caused by residual 
gases inside the system. 
  As a superconducting, small-scale system, this has the 
highest current value in the world, even including the 
large-scale systems using ordinary conducting magnets. It is 
comparable to the system at the Brookhaven National Laboratory 
in the United States, which has 1,200 milliamperes.

  [Text] The Agency of Industrial Science and Technology's 
[AIST] Electrotechnical Laboratory [ETL] announced on 2 March 
that it has succeeded for the first time in the world in 
obtaining imagery of the spatial distribution of atoms and 
molecules existing in microspace inside an ultra-vacuum. This 
will make it possible to measure the density of gaseous 
molecules in an ultra-vacuum domain. This technology is seen as 
useful for the advancement of atomcraft technology which designs 
and controls any structural material by manipulating atoms one 
by one. 
  The successful research team was led by Shingo Ichimura, 
chief of the surface control section of the laboratory's 
ultimate technology department. 
  The principle of imagery detection is that atoms and 
molecules in a vacuum are ionized by a laser and, using an ion 
detector, their distribution is investigated. In this 
experiment, an attempt was made to detect hydrogen molecules 
with a pressure of 1 ten-billionth of atmospheric pressure. 
  In the experiment, the laser radiation used for ionization 
was focused in the vacuum by an optical lens. The distribution 
of the ion generation around the laser's focal point was 
magnified by an electrostatic laser, consisting of two 
electrodes, and reflected onto the top of the ion detector. 
  The ion generation is at a maximum density at the focus of 
the radiation and the ionization rate diminishes in accordance 
with the separation from the focal point. For this reason, the 
form of the ion generation becomes spindle-shaped, having a 
maximum diameter in the vicinity of the focal point. In this 
experiment, the ionization domain's maximum diameter was about 
50 microns. 
  Previously, the ETL also ionized molecules and atoms by 
using 
a laser and is establishing atom counting technology which can 
count ionized gaseous molecules and atoms, one by one. The ETL, 
combining the current space measurement technologies, has opened 
the way for measuring molecular density inside an ultra-high 
vacuum.

<H5>  1. Introduction </H5>
  Although the number of sewage facilities has significantly 
increased in Japan's urban concentrations, this is not so in 
areas with low population density. Water pollution caused by 
wastewater, domestic and from small-scale industries, in these 
low population density areas constitutes a critical problem that 
needs to be solved as soon as possible. Wastewater treatment 
systems which are demanded for use in such areas must feature 
compactness, easy maintenance, high reliability, and capable to 
perform advanced treatment. One system which fulfills such 
requirements is the activated sludge wastewater treatment 
process which uses integrated type membrane separation (hollow 
fiber microfiltration membrane) modules. The authors have been 
engaged in the development of this system, currently in the 
practicalization stage, and have reported previously that the 
configuration of membrane module is vital factor for stable and 
continuous membrane separation on a long-term 
basis.[.sup]1[/] The following discusses membrane fouling, 
membrane washing, and other relevant topics which are consequent 
to recent test results. 
<H5>  2. Test Apparatus </H5>
  Activated Sludge Wastewater Treatment Process 
  Tests were carried out using a nitrified liquor recycling 
denitrification nitrification activated sludge treatment 
process. The influent was domestic sewage. The modules were 
submerged in a nitrification separation tank (3 m[.sup]3[/]) 
for solid-liquid separation. The volumetric aeration rate was 
set at 5.6 [1/h]. 
  Membrane &amp; Membrane Modules 
  Figure 1 shows a conceptual diagram of membrane module A. 
This module features hollow fiber membranes which are bent into 
a U-shape. The potted end, wherein the membrane fibers are 
potted in a circle, constitutes the filtrate collector. The 
U-shaped section features a support ring, which supports the 
gaps between the membrane fibers. 

<FIG ID=JPRS-JST-018L-01A>      Figure 1. Membrane Module A </FIG>


  Figure 2 shows a conceptual diagram of membrane module B. 
The 
hollow fibers are arranged and potted flatly. There are two 
filtrate collectors on both sides. Table 1 shows the 
specifications of both types of membrane modules.

  Filtration Method 
  The filtration was done intermittently, one cycle consisting 
of thirteen minutes of suction by a tube pump, to which each 
membrane module was connected, and a two minute interval. The 
pump flow rate was adjusted so the flux could be kept at a 
constant. The suction pressure was measured as the filtration 
pressure. 
<H5>  3. Test Results </H5>
  Membrane Module Configuration 
  A test operation using membrane module A was continued for 
over two years. Figure 3 shows variations in the filtration 
pressure during this period. The filtration pressure is 
corrected to 20ëC of water temperature. A comparison is made 
between the filtration pressure measured in the activated sludge 
and that measured in the filtrate following the washing process. 
There were two phases of variations in the filtration pressure 
of sludge: one which was a stationary phase, where the increase 
rate of the pressure was low, and the other which was the 
non-stationary phase, where the increase rate of the pressure 
was irregularly high. In the stationary phase, the membrane 
modules indicated favorable dispersion and the pressure increase 
rate was low at 1 [mAq/year]. This pressure variation matched 
well with pressure variations of the filtrate following the 
washing process. Considering that the variation in the 
filtration pressure of the filtrate following the washing 
process is due to membrane fouling, it can be assumed that 
membrane fouling progresses during the stationary phase. 
However, variation in the filtration pressure during the 
non-stationary phase was 2 [mAq/month], necessitating a washing 
which had to be done within a short period of time. Interfiber 
clogging was found in the membrane modules at this stage. 

<FIG ID=JPRS-JST-018L-02A>      Figure 3. Variations in Filtration Pressure of Membrane Module A </FIG>


  Membrane modules with interfiber clogging were removed from 
the tank and the sludge between the fibers washed off by tap 
water. After the operation was resumed, the filtration pressure 
in the sludge was almost identical to the filtrate pressure. 
Trends of pressure increase were identical to those before the 
washing. 
  Interfiber clogging was also found during the stationary 
phase, i.e., in the proximity of the filtrate collector of the 
modules. This was assumed to be due to small gaps between the 
hollow fibers in the proximity of the filtrate collector, also 
due to the fact that module washing by the water flow was 
ineffective there. However, the majority of the hollow fibers 
were favorably dispersed and it was possible to carry out a 
stable long-term operation under this phase. It is probable that 
interfiber clogging spreads over an entire module, i.e., after a 
few months of such favorable condition, but the cause of this 
clogging is yet to be clarified. The duration of the stationary 
phase showed a tendency to become shortened with the increase in 
the operation time and was approximately five months up to the 
third washing. An increase in the washing was found to be 
impractical in terms of maintenance and it was considered 
necessary to modify membrane module A. 
  Figure 4 shows filtration pressure variation of membrane 
module B. It indicates that a stationary phase had continued for 
seven months since the startup of the operation and that there 
was no occurrence of interfiber clogging. The pressure increase 
rate was only 0.5 [mAq/year], less than that of membrane module 
A. 

<FIG ID=JPRS-JST-018L-03A>      Figure 4. Variations in Filtration Pressure of Membrane Module B </FIG>


  As for the transition of the pressure increase rate, there 
was no clarification made on the cause of the shift from the 
stationary phase to the non-stationary one. However, prevention 
of interfiber clogging was found possible by sufficient washing 
of the membrane surface. The aeration flow causes more movement 
by the hollow fibers in module B, i.e., than that by the same in 
module A. The aeration flow and the movement of the fibers 
themselves causes a greater washing effect, both of which can be 
attributed to the prevention of interfiber clogging. 
  Flux and Membrane Fouling 
  Figure 5 shows the relationship between the pressure 
increase 
rate and flux. The pressure increase rate becomes higher along 
the increase of flux, and is proportional to the third power of 
the flux. The increase rate of hydrophobic membranes is higher 
than that of hydrophilic ones. It's indicating that membrane 
fouling progresses faster for hydrophobic membranes than for 
hydrophilic ones. Fujita et al.[.sup]2[/] indicate a similar 
trend in their report on potable water treatment by membrane 
filtration. 

<FIG ID=JPRS-JST-018L-04A>      Figure 5. Relationship Between Pressure Increase and </FIG>


   Membrane Washing 
  There are two objectives of membrane washing, washing off 
sludge that causes interfiber clogging and washing off 
pollutants that attach on membrane pores and cause membrane 
fouling. The former can be easily done by washing with water and 
the membranes retain their former condition. 
  Conditions that make it necessary to carry out washing for 
membrane fouling have yet to be clarified. However, tests were 
conducted to clarify which washing method was most effective for 
membrane fouling. An alkaline washing was attempted, taking into 
account that organic matter must be the cause of fouling. Figure 
6 shows the test results. 

<FIG ID=JPRS-JST-018L-04B>      Figure 6. Effects of Washing by Chemical  Solutions </FIG>


  A membrane immersed for two hours in a 5 percent NaOH 
solution with water temperature at 40ëC, resulted in a 
filtration pressure recovery to a value identical to the 
pressure of a new membrane. The washing effect was found to 
decrease with a drop in the chemical solution concentration and 
water temperature. 
  Membrane Module Life and Optimum Flux 
  It was confirmed through the tests conducted that the life 
of 
the membrane module could exceed two years. It is figured that 
membrane life was elongated by improvement made on the module 
configuration, the outcome of which was decrease in the pressure 
increase rate. Further long-term tests will be necessary to 
affirm this. 
  Insofar as designing a membrane separation system is 
concerned, a decrease in the number of modules could be achieved 
by setting the flux at a high value. Consequently, a saving in 
initial cost can be made. However, this leads to a faster 
progress of membrane fouling and washing by chemical solutions 
for pollutant removal becomes necessary. For this reason, the 
optimum flux was determined by the initial and running costs. 
  Although the present treatment method is designed for use in 
a small-scale treatment plant, to use a chemical washing system 
in such a plant is impractical even in economic terms. It will 
become necessary to transport the modules to a washing plant and 
this will increase maintenance requirement, not to mention 
increased costs. A solution here would be to set the flux to a 
predetermined value, considering the relation between the flux 
and factors such as membrane life, whereby washing by chemical 
solution would not be necessary.

  It was possible to maintain a favorable water quality 
without 
adopting any special maintenance practice. The ratio of total 
nitrogen removal was not favorable, because the DO level in 
denitrification tank did not indicate zero for the small BOD 
loading. As for phosphorus removal, it was the same level as 
that by the conventional activated sludge process, as no 
phosphorus removal system was applied. There was negative 
indication of E-coli groups; however they became detected along 
an increase in hollow fiber damage. One future objective would 
be to study the application of phosphorus removal methods fit 
for the said treatment. 
<H5>  4. Conclusion </H5>
  The following are results of tests on the activated sludge 
wastewater treatment process which featured the integrated type 
membrane separation (hollow fiber microfiltration membrane) 
modules. 
  1) There are two phases of variations in the filtration 
pressure during continuous filtration: one which was a 
stationary phase, wherein membrane fouling progresses, and the 
other which was a non-stationary phase, where interfiber 
clogging occurs. 
  2) The progress of membrane fouling was related to the flux, 
while the pressure increase rate was proportional to the third 
power of the flux. 
  3) Interfiber clogging could be easily dealt with by washing 
and the membranes retain their original pressure as a result. 
  4) Alkali washing of fouled membranes is effective to a high 
degree whereby the washed membranes could retain a state which 
is close to that of new membranes. 
  5) Module life was elongated to exceed two years by 
configuration improvement, but further studies are necessary to 
affirm this. 
  6) Optimum flux should be determined in an overall manner, 
i.e., considering factors such as the necessary washing and 
membrane life. 
  7) The treated water quality by the said process was 
favorable.

<H5>  Summary </H5>
  The catalytic wet oxidation process developed by Osaka Gas 
Co., Ltd. is designed to efficiently decompose the highly 
concentrated pollutants -- nitrogen compounds including ammonia, 
COD (Chemical Oxygen Demand) and BOD (Biochemical Oxygen Demand) 
components, etc. -- contained in wastewater and sludge. This 
paper will discuss the results of treating industrial 
wastewater, sludge and other waste substances with this process. 
<H5>  1. Introduction </H5>
  The treatment of residential wastes, including wastewater 
and 
sludge, is of grave social concern in light of global 
environmental problems. 
  The catalytic wet oxidation process, which is intended to 
decompose these wastes with great efficiency, employs air 
(oxygen) and specific mixtures of catalysts at high temperature 
and high pressure. 
  Unlike conventional treatment methods, the process in 
question is a new technique which is based on a quite different 
physic-chemical treatment for decomposing pollutants. In this 
process, highly concentrated pollutants, such as nitrogen 
compounds (including ammonia), COD and BOD components and 
sludge, are treated with very high efficiency in a single step 
without any dilution. The pollutants are oxidized, decomposed 
and converted into harmless N[.sub]2[/], CO[.sub]2[/], 
H[.sub]2[/]O, etc. As a result, no sludge requiring secondary 
treatment is generated, and the exhaust gas contains neither NOx 
nor SOx. What is more, surplus heat energy can be recovered in 
various ways depending on the treatment scale, while liquid 
clarification, deodorization, disinfection and other desirable 
effects can be obtained. The process can be applied to various 
types of systems: individual-treatment systems, with complete 
oxidative decomposition of pollutants; and combined-treatment 
systems, in which organic substances are first partially 
oxidized (low-molecular-weight substance processing) by 
catalytic action and then undergo further anaerobic digestion 
processes, to name two. The catalytic wet oxidation process can 
be widely applied to the treatment of various types of 
wastewater and sludge: industrial wastewater, sludge generated 
in the activated sludge processing of night soil, industrial 
wastewater and sewage water, residential wastes, and many others. 
<H5>  2. The Catalytic Wet Oxidation Process </H5>
  2-1. Features of the Process 
  This process has the following outstanding features not 
found 
in conventional treatment techniques such as, the noncatalytic 
wet oxidation process (called the Zimmerman Process). 
  (1) Compared to the conventional Zimmerman Process and 
similar wet oxidation processes, this process excess at removing 
highly concentrated CODcr and other components which contain 
persistent organic matter. 
  (2) This process can decompose various kinds of nitrogen 
compounds which may exist in the wastewater and convert them 
into nitrogen gas. The conventional processes cannot treat 
ammonia and other nitrogen components. 
  (3) Along with the very efficient treatment of pollutants, 
wastewater can be clarified, deodorized, disinfected, and then 
completely recycled. The exhaust gas contains neither NOx nor 
SOx and is odorless. 
  (4) Three to five hours after the system is started up, the 
process becomes stable. From then on the system will maintain a 
stable level of treatment without being affected by changes in 
raw water quality. 
  (5) The treatment system is compact in design and requires a 
relatively small installation space. 
  (6) Highly concentrated sludge, COD and BOD components, 
ammonia and other nitrogen compounds can be efficiently 
decomposed in a single stage process. Depending on the selected 
process conditions, persistent organic and inorganic matter can 
also be converted into easily decomposed or low-molecular-weight 
substances, which can then be treated by further biological 
processing (anaerobic and aerobic treatments). 
  This process has proved applicable not only to various kinds 
of industrial and residential wastewater but also to sludge 
discharged during the activated sludge treatment process of 
night soil, industrial wastewater and sewage water. 
  2-2. Processing Sequence 
  Figure 1 shows the processing sequence. The wastewater and 
sludge to be treated is first made homogeneous, preferably in 
the storage tank. Then it is pressurized and fed to the heat 
exchanger. Air is used as the source of oxygen. It is 
pressurized to nearly the same level as the feed water and mixed 
with the water just before it enters the heat exchanger. 

<FIG ID=JPRS-JST-018L-07A>      Figure 1. Flow Chart of the Catalytic Wet Oxidation  Process </FIG>


  The heat exchanger is usually a multi-tube type. A 
double-tube type is employed when a great many suspended solids 
are contained in the feed water or when scale builds up in the 
tube over time. The fixed bed of the reactor is charged with the 
required amount of catalyst, which triggers the decomposition of 
pollutants. 
  The mixture of unprocessed feed water and compressed air is 
preheated in an exchange of heat with the high-temperature gases 
and treated fluids coming out of the reactor in the 
gaseous/liquid phase flow. The mixture is thereby heated to the 
required temperature for starting the reaction. When the system 
first starts operation, a furnace is used to heat the feed 
fluid. When the target reaction temperature has been reached, 
the external thermal source is shut down. From that point on, 
the raw feed water is heated solely by the oxidized mixture 
flowing out of the system. This exchange of heat creates a 
self-sustaining temperature high enough to support the reaction. 
  2-3. Reaction Heat 
  Figure 2 shows the relationship between the level of 
organics 
in the wastewater and the amount of heat required for 
reaction.[.sup]1[/] In the wet oxidation process, autogenous 
combustion can be achieved in the range where the CODcr 
components in the wastewater (or sludge) exceed 10 g/l. In this 
process, the reaction heat derived from the decomposition of the 
COD components as well as the heat generated by the breakdown of 
the ammonia in the wastewater (or sludge) contribute to 
effective heat recovery. 

<FIG ID=JPRS-JST-018L-07B>      Figure 2. Amount of Organics in the Wastewater; Heat Requirements[.sup]1[/] (comparison of wet oxidation and </FIG>


  2-4. Reaction Conditions 
  The reaction conditions -- temperature, pressure, oxygen 
demand, pre-reaction pH value, etc. -- will vary with the 
components and their concentration in the wastewater or sludge, 
as well as with the target water quality level. The oxygen 
demand is the amount of oxygen that is required to completely 
oxidize and decompose the pollutants in the wastewater or 
sludge. Such pollutants can be fully decomposed with a volume of 
oxygen that is 1.05-1.2 times the theoretical oxygen demand. 
This figure is based on the decomposition reaction of each 
component, shown in Figure 3. 

<FIG ID=JPRS-JST-018L-08A>      Figure 3. Decomposition Reaction Formulae of Various Components in the Catalytic Wet Oxidation Process </FIG>


  The catalysts used in this process have proved to have a 
long 
service life in the high-temperature, high-pressure liquid phase 
of the process. The catalytic elements use titania, zirconia or 
the like (as either a one-element or two-element system) as the 
carrier and they also contain a mixture of precious or base 
metals (two or more metals) which comprise several percent of 
the element. As shown in Photo 1, these catalytic elements are 
spherical or honeycomb in shape. The amount of catalyst to be 
added to a specific system depends on the results expected from 
the treatment. 

<FIG ID=JPRS-JST-018L-08B>      Photo 1. Catalysts (left: honeycomb catalyst, right: spherical catalyst) </FIG>


  2-5. The Decomposition of Pollutants 
  Wastewater or sludge is introduced into the reactor, which 
has been charged with the catalyst, at a specified temperature 
and pressure. The pollutants in the water or sludge are 
decomposed in the reactions shown in Figure 3. As shown in 
Figure 4, COD components are decomposed into carbon dioxide and 
water after passing through an intermediate stage as a 
low-molecular-weight carboxylic acid.[.sup]2[/] The waste gas 
discharged from the reactor contains neither NOx nor SOx and is 
odorless. 

<FIG ID=JPRS-JST-018L-09A>      Figure 4. Mechanism of the Decomposition Reaction of COD Components </FIG>


<H5>  3. The Treatment of Industrial Wastewater </H5>
  3-1. The Treatment of Wastewater (Gas Liquor) From Coke 
Ovens 
  Table 1 shows the gas liquor treatment performance of a test 
plant with several reactors, each of which is 300mm in inner 
diameter and 6,500mm in height. (This plant was constructed in 
1979 with an initial wastewater treatment capacity of 6 
m[.sup]3[/]/day. Still in operation, the plant's treatment 
capacity can be boosted to 60 m[.sup]3[/]/day when the 
wastewater is relatively low in pollution. See Photo 2 [not 
reproduced]) 

  Highly concentrated COD and ammonia components are 
decomposed 
to a level of 10 mg/l or less after a 24-minute reaction (SV = 
2.5 Hr[.sup]-1[/]). Phenol and cyanide are decomposed to 
levels below the minimum limits of detection, and all suspended 
solids can be thoroughly removed. Meanwhile, NOx and SOx 
concentrations in the exhaust gas are reduced to levels below 
the minimum limits of determination (0.5 and 2.0 
Mg/Nm[.sup]3[/] respectively), with no signs of growth. It is 
assumed that the reaction mechanism, especially the catalytic 
COD reaction mechanism, provides a complex, sequentially 
competing reaction which produces low-molecular-weight carbonic 
acid as an intermediate product. The reaction rate formulae 
which match the experimental results are: 
  -d(X NH[.sub]3[/]/dt = K[.sub]1[/] x (C 
NH[.sub]3[/]) x (P O[.sub]2[/]) 
  -d(X COD)/dt = K[.sub]2[/] x (C COD)[.sup]2[/] x (P 
O[.sub]2[/]) 
  The reaction rate constants of the COD and ammonia 
components 
correlate with the reaction temperature (150-280ëC) of the 
processing gas liquor (initial pH 10.5 in reaction) as follows: 
  log K[.sub]1[/] NH[.sub]3[/] = 22.72 - 9119/T 
  log K[.sub]2[/] COD = 4.72 - 2020/T 
  As a result of the noncatalytic treatment of gas liquor, no 
decomposition of ammonia is seen and the COD decomposition rate 
is less than one hundredth that of catalytically treated gas 
liquor. Even if the reaction time is prolonged two- to sixfold, 
the residual COD value of about 1,000 mg/l remains nearly 
unchanged in the effluent. 
  It has been confirmed that the catalyst developed for this 
process is highly stable in actual use. An 11,000-hour catalyst 
service life test, processing gas liquor from a coke oven, 
showed that the catalytic activity was unchanged. The test 
conditions and results are given in Figure 5. When the reaction 
time is changed from 20 minutes to 35 minutes with the other 
conditions remaining the same, no ammonia is detected in the 
treated water and the COD value drops to below 10 mg/l. 

<FIG ID=JPRS-JST-018L-10A>      Figure 5. Continuous Activity Test Results: Gas Liquor </FIG>


  Figure 6 shows the results of case studies of material 
balance and heat balance after the treatment of gas liquor at a 
rate of 40 m[.sup]3[/]/hr.

  3-2. The Treatment of Wastewater Containing Highly 
Concentrated Cyanide[.sup]3[/] 
  The treatment of wastewater containing highly concentrated 
cyanide will be reported in detail in another session dealing 
with ``Desalination and Water Treatment in Harmony with the 
Environment.'' 
  3-3. The Treatment of Other Types of Industrial 
Wastewater 
  Table 2 shows the results of treating other types of 
industrial wastewater. 
&lt;graphic&gt; &lt;/graphic&gt; 

<H5>  4. The Treatment of Sludge </H5>[.sup]4,5,6[/] and Residential 
Wastes 
  4-1. The Treatment of Sludge 
  (1) The treatment system 
  Figure 7 shows a proposed new sewage and sludge treatment 
system. Conventional sewage treatment systems that process 
activated sludge need to retain the sludge for six to eight 
hours for processing. The proposed new system allows a shorter 
aeration time in order to effectively remove soluble BOD and COD 
components. In the proposed system, most of the earth and sand, 
extraneous large solids and suspended solids are removed in the 
first stage of settling and straining. Then an activated sludge 
process is used, requiring about two hours of aeration time. The 
suspended solids and surplus sludge which remain after the first 
stage of settling, straining and the final settling constitute 
about 2-6 percent of the total liquid. This liquid is then 
treated by the catalytic wet oxidation process. 

<FIG ID=JPRS-JST-018L-12A>      Figure 7. New Sewage and Sludge Treatment System </FIG>


  The process can be used in two different types of systems: 
individual-treatment systems and combined-treatment systems 
which include an anaerobic digestion process (see Figure 6). In 
the latter type of system, the sludge is made soluble and the 
persistent organic matter is converted to easily decomposed 
low-molecular-weight organic substances. The resulting fluid is 
fed as needed to a separation membrane to let particles with 
less than a certain molecular weight permeate through the 
membrane. The fluid that comes through this membrane then 
undergoes an anaerobic digestion process in order to recover the 
methane gas it can produce. The sludge generated during this 
process is circulated to the catalytic wet oxidation process for 
re-treatment. The inorganic matter (ash content) is removed from 
the system. 
  A research and development project was launched in 1991 with 
the cooperation of the Ministry of International Trade and 
Industry (MITI), the Water Re-use Promotion Center (WRPC), Osaka 
Gas Co., Ltd. and other participant corporations. 
  (2) The results of treating sludge[.sup]4,5[/] 
  In this test, sewage sludge was used to prepare a 
concentration-adjusted sample of sludge water. The results of 
the test, using 4 percent sewage sludge water at 270ëC and 
8.43 MPa of pressure, are shown in Table 3. 

  In the noncatalytic process, the amounts of the components 
do 
not change remarkably, even after one hour of reaction time. It 
is clear from this data that the catalyst plays a very effective 
role in this new treatment process. It should be noted that in 
the noncatalytic process the amount of NH[.sub]3[/]-N is 
increased. This is because the organic nitrogen components in 
the raw water are converted to NH[.sub]3[/]-N during 
processing. 
  In the catalytic process, T-N, NH[.sub]3[/]-N, 
COD[.sub]Mn[/], COD[.sub]Cr[/], BOD, TOD and TOC can all 
be almost completely removed in one hour of reaction time. To 
remove the scale which can build up in the system, periodic 
chemical flushing is carried out. 
  See references 4 and 5 the results of the anaerobic 
digestion 
processing sludge water which has been partially oxidized by the 
catalyst. 
  4-2. The Treatment of Residential Wastes 
  With the tremendous changes in lifestyle today, the volume 
of 
residential wastes has steadily increased. The treatment of 
those wastes is now a serious social issue for many reasons 
including the rising cost of collecting wastes, the shortage of 
incineration facilities, and the reduction in the number of 
landfills, to name just a few. 
  To solve these problems, a research and development project 
was launched in 1991 with the cooperation of the MITI, the New 
Energy and Industrial Technology Development Organization, the 
WRPC, Osaka Gas Co., Ltd. and other corporations. This project 
is designed to develop two systems to recover new energy from 
solid wastes and wastewater which have a high potential for 
recoverable energy. One system is a high-efficiency transfer 
system for solid wastes and wastewater, and the other is an 
energy recovery system which combines a physic-chemical waste 
treatment process (the process discussed in this paper) and a 
biological treatment process in an effective way. 
  This technological development program is specifically 
intended to carry out the following steps: pulverize kitchen 
garbage and combustible wastes (paper and plastics), turn the 
particles into sludge, make the sludge soluble in the 
noncatalytic section of the catalytic wet oxidation system, 
convert the resulting fluid to low-molecular-weight substances 
in the catalytic section, and recover the methane gas produced 
by these materials through the anaerobic digestion process. 
<H5>  5. Conclusion </H5>
  This catalytic wet oxidation process can be used to 
completely decompose the highly concentrated pollutants which 
are seen in various kinds of industrial wastewater and night 
soil. It is also more effective than ever before in treating 
sewage sludge, which contains a large quantity of solid organic 
matter, without having to dehydrate and dry the sludge. 
Depending on the selection of reaction conditions, this process 
can be used alone or combined with other processes. In the 
individual-treatment application, pollutants can be fully 
decomposed into harmless substances. In combined applications, 
solid organic matter is first made soluble and then converted 
into low-molecular-weight substances (easily decomposed 
organics) through a partial oxidation treatment. Finally a 
biological treatment of the material (anaerobic digestion 
treatment, for example) is carried out. The catalytic wet 
oxidation process causes a substantial improvement in 
performance in comparison to conventional processes such as heat 
treatment or the Zimmerman Process. In addition to the treatment 
of sewage sludge, residential wastes that have been pulverized, 
converted to sludge and mixed with highly concentrated 
wastewater, may also be treated with this process. 
  The authors hope that this process will be applied in many 
fields and contribute to solving today's environmental problems.

<H5>  Abstract </H5>
  Over the last 15 years steam injection has been the only 
method capable of significantly enhancing oil recovery in the 
German and Dutch oil fields producing a highly viscous crude. 
However, the steam injection has a negative impact on the oil 
reservoir pressure, since the steam to oil ratio is about 4. 
This means that for each produced barrel of oil, there is an 
accumulation of 4 barrels of condensed water coming from the 
injected steam. 
  The outcoming oil and water mixture is separated in 
decantation tanks. The oil is further processed and the 
remaining brine is a disposal stream. 
  The conventional method to dispose of the produced water is 
to pump it to separate reservoirs, such as a depleted 
underground gas reservoir, but this is limited to the available 
disposal capacity. Any other means to dispose the produced water 
to lakes or to rivers is prohibited by environmental 
regulations. The re-injection of the water back to the depleted 
reservoir is prohibited too based on the following: 
  -- Contamination of the potable quality ground water with 
oil 
through cracks in the formation because of the increased 
pressure of the reinjected water. 
  -- Raising the water table in adjacent residential areas due 
to the pressure of reinjected water, leading to the closing of 
ground water wells due to contamination. 
  -- Irreversible changes in underground locked crude pockets 
which may damage future oil exploration. 
  Based on careful investigations prepared by the oil 
companies 
operating in the German/Dutch oil fields it was decided to 
install a mechanical vapour compression unit to desalinate the 
produced water and use the distillate for boiler feed water, 
thus recycling the produced water and eliminating the previously 
mentioned drawbacks. 
  This paper outlines the process which allows the production 
of high quality boiler feed water for steam generation from 
produced water, eliminating the ecological dangers mentioned 
above. This is achieved by ensuring a permanent water balance in 
the oil reservoir in the form of a closed water cycle, thus 
preventing the excessive volume of injected steam and creating 
the continuous addition of water to the system either from the 
fresh water wells or other available water resources. 
<H5>  1. Introduction </H5>
  Steam enhanced oil production is a well established 
technology. In the thermal methods heavy crude oil is extracted 
by injecting large quantities of steam into the oil formation. 
  Continuous steam injection during a long period of time 
continuously disturbs the volumetric balance of the oil 
reservoir. At a steam oil ratio of 4:1, the injection of 4 
volumetric units of steam brings to the surface one volumetric 
unit of oil and four unit volumes of water in addition to the 
naturally present water in the oil reservoir. The produced water 
may be reinjected. However to avoid pressure increase in the 
reservoir an excess of three volumes has to be disposed to an 
empty gas reservoir or to environmentally allowable special 
disposal areas. 
  Three new additional volumes of fresh well or river water 
have to be used after treatment to generate the steam for 
injection. 
  A solution for the permanent water imbalance in the oil 
reservoir is to use treated produced water for boiler feed 
water, to control a closed water cycle in the oil production 
facility. The ``closed water loop'' does not add any extra water 
from water wells, rivers or any other fresh water sources. 
<H5>  2. General Process Description </H5>
  The process is shown in the attached process block diagram. 

<FIG ID=JPRS-JST-018L-14A>      Figure 1. Steam Enhanced Oil Production Process Block Diagram </FIG>


  The enhanced steam recovery method brings to the surface not 
only the oil but also significant quantities of formation water 
which are discharged back to the reservoir. 
  The mixture of hot oil and saline water is fed to oil/water 
separation plant. 
  After cooling the oil fraction is separated. The saline 
water 
fraction leaving the separation tank is treated in cascade for 
separation of residual oil and suspended solids. Before the 
produced water enters the MVC units to produce high quality 
boiler feed, it goes through a treatment stage to remove gases 
and dose an oxygen scavenger in order to keep the iron in 
soluble form. The distillate of the MVC unit is used as feed 
water to the steam boilers, whilst the brine is disposed to an 
injection well. Thus a permanent water balance is kept in the 
oil reservoir by forming a closed water cycle. 
<H5>  3. Process Description </H5>
  3.1 General 
  The vapour compression unit, which separates the feed into 
two streams -- distillate and brine is the heart of a system 
which transforms the produced water, originating from the 
oil/water separation tanks to boiler feed quality water. 
  The central position of the vapour compression distiller 
results from the fact that it represents the major investment in 
the system, and that its operation is far more sensitive than 
the rest of the system blocks. 
  Therefore, the design philosophy was to install a series of 
pre-treatment steps, each aimed at the removal of a certain 
potential risk to the smooth and trouble-free operation of the 
vapour compression distiller. 
  3.2 The Evaporator 
  The evaporator is classified as an open loop heat pump. It 
is 
composed of two main components, the heat transfer tubes and the 
compressor. The compressor sucks vapour from an evaporating 
falling film on the exterior of the heat transfer tubes and 
discharging them to the interior of the same tubes. The lift of 
the compressor supplies the needed thermal gradient for the 
evaporation of the falling film and the condensation of the 
vapour inside the tubes. 
  The heat transfer is the latent heat of condensation 
supplied 
via the tubes' wall as the latent heat of evaporation. In the 
temperature enthalpy diagram the process is described as two 
parallel lines (parallel to the enthalpy axis) at constant 
temperature. The top line represents the condensation and the 
bottom the evaporation. The conventional name of the evaporator 
is mechanical vapour compression (MVC). The mechanical structure 
of the MVC is explained as follows: 
  The main element of the unit is a horizontal, 10 m-long 
cylindrical vessel with a diameter of 4.5 m mounted on a 4 
m-high support structure. Within the vessel there is a nest of 
almost 7,500 horizontal heat transfer tubes (Figure 2). 

<FIG ID=JPRS-JST-018L-16A>      Figure 2. MVC -- Process Schematic </FIG>


  The water is sprayed on the heat transfer tubes by a number 
of spray nozzles thus covering the whole surface of the upper 
tubes with a thin water film. The tubes are arranged in such a 
way that the water drops by gravity from the upper tubes evenly 
distributing over the tubes below continuously forming thin 
films. The brine recirculation pump guarantees a continuous 
efficient circulation. After passing through the feed heat 
exchanger and the auxiliary condenser/vacuum degasser the feed 
water is added to the circulation flow. 
  A turbo-compressor sucks the vapour which has evaporated 
from 
the falling film. The vapour enters the vapour duct through mesh 
type mist eliminators and flows to the compressor suction port. 
From the compressor the vapour is discharged at higher pressure 
and temperature to the interior of the heat transfer tubes. 
There it condenses supplying the latent heat required for the 
evaporation process. 
  The condensate and the concentrated brine are pumped out 
after exchanging heat with the feed. Non-condensible gases (NCG) 
are first concentrated in the auxiliary condenser and then 
exhausted by means of a rotary vacuum pump, which also serves to 
create the initial vacuum. 
  The directly coupled compressor is tank-head flange-mounted 
to the vessel in a support frame. 
  The most important components are integrated into the 
support 
structure of the unit. These components are the brine and 
condensate pumps, brine recirculation pump and liquid ring 
vacuum pumps, the feed heat exchanger, which is divided into two 
sections, the control cabinet as well as all necessary control 
units, switchboards and display units. 
<H5>  4. Field Experience </H5>
  The first MVC of 600 m[.sup]3[/]/day distillate capacity 
unit went on stream in December, 1990 and the second during 
September, 1991. Both units were successfully commissioned and 
since then have been in continuous operation in the oil 
extraction facility. 
  The first unit was opened and thoroughly inspected after 
3,500 hours of continuous operation. The findings were as 
follows: 
  -- No performance decrease of the units due to deterioration 
of the heat transfer. 
  -- No scaling was found during the inspection of unit I. 
Heat 
transfer tubes, demister and compressor blades have not shown 
any fouling. 
  -- There were no corrosion attacks in the MVC unit itself. 
  -- Checks of the compressor bearings have not shown any wear 
or balance errors. 
  -- There are no particular changes in the vacuum tightness 
of 
the MVC plant. 
  As we can see from the table, the design parameters of the 
MVC units are conservative compared to the real test 
performance. The distillate production capacity of the units is 
up to 10 percent higher, and specific energy consumption is 6 
percent lower. Temperature is by 2.5ëC to 4ëC lower than 
the comparable designed parameters.

  The distillate quality tests with respect to suitability as 
boiler feed water were carried out by independent experts (TUV). 
The results were: 
  -- The distillate is of constantly good quality. 
  -- TUV has not recommended any further treatment to the 
distillate other than the regular chemical conditioning where 
the residual hardness is sequestered. 
  The inherent simplicity of the MVC unit, as well as the 
automatic controls and instrumentation, enable quick start up 
and shut down, and allow unattended round-the-clock operation. 
  Maintenance required is on a routine and normal basis for 
rotating equipment such as pumps and motors and for instruments 
and electrical equipment. 
  Lubrication is carried out on a preventive maintenance 
schedule as given in the operational and maintenance manuals. 
  The scale cleaning which is recommended by IDE after every 
6-12 months of continuous operation was found to be unnecessary 
to date. 
  The units consume, according to the design, moderate 
quantities of consumable materials such as hydrochloric acid, 
sodium hydroxide, scale inhibitor, oxygen scavenger and lube oil. 
  The units have been in continuous operation since their 
commissioning and allow the oil production company to continue 
to be an on-going facility for exploration of oil by steam 
injection, leaving the operation site ecologically safe. 
<H5>  5. Conclusions </H5>
  -- The mechanical vapour compression units have solved a 
major environmental and production problem by eliminating the 
volume of disposal of excess waste water (usually four times 
that of water per one volume unit of oil). 
  -- The closed water cycle operation no longer required a 
continuous consumption of fresh water (from wells or rivers) due 
to the recycle of produced water by desalination to obtain 
distillate in high quality to be used as boiler feed to generate 
steam for the oil production facility. 
  -- The installation of the MVC has been economically 
justified for enhancing oil production by steam injection. 
  -- The performance data of the units in operation are above 
those which were taken in consideration in the design phase.

<H5>  Abstract </H5>
  Rotary disk modules, developed for the separation of highly 
concentrated activated sludge, can be used in place of 
biological settling ponds to efficiently recycle sewage or waste 
water. Applied to sewage treatment, the rotary disk module 
allowed us to consistently obtain recycled water of T-N &lt; 5 
mg/l, BOD &lt; 2 mg/l, SS trace. When the module was applied to 
cafeteria waste water treatment, we were able to obtain recycled 
water of BOD &lt; 2 mg/l, SS trace. Flux through the module was, 
in both cases, able to be maintained at 1.5 
m[.sup]3[/]/m[.sup]2[/]d while filtering liquid of 10 to 
15 g/l MLSS. 
<H5>  Introduction </H5>
  As pollution in closed water regions grows worse and urban 
redevelopment becomes more extensive, it becomes all the more 
urgent to recycle sewage and commercial building waste water. 
Here, the Ministry of International Trade and Industry conducted 
a six-year (1985 through 1990) project, Research and Development 
on General Recycling Systems for Water. In conjunction with 
this, the authors supervised a project, Research and Development 
on Biological Nitrogen Removal Technique, directed at developing 
membrane reactors for sewage recycling. In the field of water 
treatment, membrane reactors have been utilized for grey water 
production devices[.sup]1[/] that combine membrane treatment 
with the activated sludge process. However, while this approach 
does have its advantages, it is limited by the large amount of 
power required to membrane-separate the highly concentrated 
activated sludge. 
  Here, we created a rotary disk module[.sup]2[/] for the 
low-power separation of highly concentrated liquid and, in 
extension, developed a membrane reactor that combines this with 
the biological nitrogen removal process. In this paper, we 
introduce this rotary disk module and the newly developed 
membrane reactor for sewage treatment. In addition, we access 
the performance of this system as applied to the recycling of 
cafeteria waste water and compare its cost to that of 
tubular-type modules. 
<H5>  2. Design of the Rotary Disk Module </H5>
  A conventional membrane module circulates the treatment 
liquid at a high flow rate so as to obtain a rapid flow at the 
membrane surface and a high flux through the surface. However, 
much power is consumed, because the pressure loss within the 
module is correspondingly high (i.e., a higher pressure is 
maintained than what is required for filtration alone). As 
opposed to this, rotating the membrane would, we thought, allow 
us to maintain a high liquid flow rate at the membrane surface 
without having to maintain high pressure. Therefore, relatively 
little power would be required to run the system. 
  The water collection mechanism of a rotary disk module is 
shown in Figure 1. A membrane disk, comprised of two support 
plates covered with a membrane over their surface, is fastened 
to a hollow rotary shaft which acts as a water collection tube. 
Filtering is carried out while the shaft rotates. To modularize 
the system, it is of course necessary to increase the filling 
density of the membrane by attaching many such disks to the 
rotary shaft. However, merely adding on extra disks decreases 
the flux through the surface by approximately one-half in a 
liquid having a high concentration of microorganisms. Here, 
installing baffle plates between the disks restores the flux to 
very nearly what it would be with only one disk.[.sup]3[/] 

<FIG ID=JPRS-JST-018L-18A>      Figure 1. Water Collection Mechanism of Rotary Disk Module </FIG>


  The engagement-type module (Figure 2) utilizes the disks of 
an adjacent rotary shaft in place of the baffle plates. Here, 
two shafts comprise one module. Not only is membrane filling 
density increased with this arrangement, but turbulent flow at 
the membrane surface is encouraged, thereby increasing the flux.

<H5>  3. Advanced Sewage Recycling System (a part of the Aqua </H5>
Renaissance '90 Project) 
  3-1. Experimental Apparatus 
  The experimental apparatus is comprised of a nitrogen 
removal 
tank (1.25 m[.sup]3[/]), a nitrification tank (1.25 
m[.sup]3[/]), and a rotary disk module (Membrane Area 7.44 
m[.sup]2[/]). Standard treatment capacity is 10 
m[.sup]3[/]/d. Retention time in the bioreaction tank was set 
at 6 hours. The rotary disk module consisted of two shafts, each 
with 12 disks of 500mm in diameter. The membrane was made out of 
a polysulfone. The data presented here was taken when using 
membranes having a cut-off molecular weight of 600,000. 
  The types of raw water were tested: sewage (case 1); water 
from methane-fermentation of sewage (case 2); and water from SS 
separation and from SS methane-fermentation of sewage (case 3). 
Flow paths and operating results are shown in Table 1. Figures 
for water quality shown in the table are average values 
throughout the operating period. 

<FIG ID=JPRS-JST-018L-19A>      FIGURE </FIG>


  3-2. Membrane Reactor Effectiveness 
  The rate of nitrogen removal in the activated sludge process 
increases with an increase in the recirculation ratio. Figure 3 
[not reproduced] presents data showing the effect of 
recirculation ratio in a membrane reactor. In both cases 1 and 
2, we see that, relative to theoretical removal rates for 
conventional processing, higher removal rates were obtained even 
at lower circulation rates. This is because of (a) nitrogen 
removal in the nitrification tank due to a higher concentration 
of microorganisms and (b) removal by the membrane of nitrogen 
components resulting from SS. Here, we note that using membranes 
is very effective. Furthermore, the very high rate of nitrogen 
removal observed in case 2 is due to nearly complete 
nitrification and denitrification resulting from efforts to 
remove nitrogen after nitrification. 
  The microorganisms had been acclimated from some time back, 
so this trial did not last long. Even so, we did achieve stable 
operation from the 15th to 70th day, producing, with retention 
times of 3 to 6 hours, treating water having 5 ml/l or less of 
T-N and 2 mg/l or less of BOD. Furthermore, the amount of excess 
sludge in this period was one-fifth of that resulting from 
conventional process. 
  Operating results for case 2 are shown in Figure 4 [not 
reproduced]. From the 150th day of operation, we began adding 
ammonium chloride to the raw water to increase the nitrogen 
load. Even with this, we were able to maintain stable operation 
throughout the year. In average values throughout the year, 
water quality was 31.3 mg/l total nitrogen and 9.5 mg/l BOD for 
the raw water and 0.93 mg/l nitrogen and less than 2 mg/l BOD 
for the treated water -- the treated water was fully able to be 
recycled. Very little excess sludge was generated during the 
operating period, and nitrogen was removed very efficiently. 
Furthermore, use of the rotary disk module forestalled any 
problems with flow blockage or the like -- the membrane reactor 
operated very smoothly. 
  3-3. Membrane Module Performance 
  Figure 5 [not reproduced] shows the change with time in flux 
upon continuous operation. Nearly the same flux is obtained in 
cases 1 and 2. In case 2, a flux of 1.5 
m[.sup]3[/]/m[.sup]2[/]d was obtained over 180 days of 
operation without chemical cleaning. The pressure at this time 
was low at 0.09 MPa, and the concentration of microorganisms in 
the module was 12 to 15 g/l. The power required to draw water 
through the membrane at this time (cutoff molecular weight = 
600,000, motor efficiency = 85 percent, pump efficiency = 60 
percent) was about 1 kWh/m[.sup]3[/]. By this, we confirmed 
that we could separate highly concentration liquid with 
relatively little power. 
  3-4. Comparison With Conventional Method 
  Table 2 presents a comparison for sewage between the 
conventional process (nitrified liquor recycling activated 
sludge process[.sup]4[/]) and the newly developed membrane 
reactor. Because a high concentration of microorganisms was able 
to be maintained with the membrane reactor, treatment time could 
be reduced by about two-thirds, even at low temperatures, and 
the volume of excess sludge was reduced by about four-fifths. 
The newly developed system consistently produced water of a 
quality -BOD = 2 mg/l max., T-N = 5 ml/l max. -- significantly 
higher than that produced by the conventional system. These and 
other results demonstrate the effectiveness of membrane 
reactors. However, it should be mentioned that the membrane 
reactor is probably not advantageous if the water is to be 
discharged after treatment -- it is only economically feasible 
when the treated water is to be recycled. 

<FIG ID=JPRS-JST-018L-20A>      FIGURE </FIG>


<H5>  4. Cafeteria Waste Water Recycling System </H5>
  4-1. Experimental Apparatus and Methods 
  Figure 6 shows the flow of the experimental apparatus 
(treatment capacity: 3 m[.sup]3[/]/d). The raw water is waste 
water from a cafeteria within the Matsudo Works of Hitachi Plant 
Engineering and Construction. After screening (2.0mm mesh) and 
oil separation (in a tank), the raw water is fed into a 
bioreaction tank (0.8 m[.sup]3[/]) for anaoxic and oxic 
treatment. Afterwards, the water is fed to a rotary disk module 
for solid/liquid separation. By this, treated water is obtained 
for recycling. Concentrated liquid from the module is fed back 
to the anaoxic tank. As treated water is removed from the 
system, an equal quantity of raw water is fed into the 
bioreaction treatment tank. 

<FIG ID=JPRS-JST-018L-21A>      Figure 6. Cafeteria Waste Water Recycling System Flow </FIG>


  The rotary disk module is comprised of two rotary shafts; 
the 
disks on one shaft run between the disks of the other. In this 
experiment, disk diameter is 500mm, and each shaft has six 
disks. The membrane is made of a polysulfone; the cutoff 
molecular weight is 750,000. A constant volume pump was attached 
to the treated water line (offtake) of the rotary disk module. 
The water was pulled through the membrane by the suction force 
of this pump. No chemical cleaning was performed within the 
period of this experiment. 
  4-2. Results of Continuous System Operation 
  The experimental apparatus was run in such a way that BOD-SS 
load was kept at 0.15 kg/kg-d. Figure 7 [not reproduced] shows 
the progression in flux over two months in continuous operation; 
Table 3 shows the results of water quality measurements taken 
over that period (``raw water'' in the table refers to water at 
the inlet of the biological treatment tank). At this time, 
liquid temperature in the biological treatment tank was 25 to 
33ëC, and MLSS was controlled to about 10 g/l. From Table 3, 
we note that high removal rates of over 90 percent were obtained 
for all water quality items and that the treated water was of a 
quality sufficient for recycling. Through this experiment, we 
have confirmed the efficiency of membrane treatment -- flux in 
the rotary disk module averaged 1.5 
m[.sup]3[/]/m[.sup]2[/]d, and simple screening was enough 
to prevent any problems from blockage by foreign objects.

  4.3. Running Cost 
  Table 4 presents a comparison of running costs between a 
rotary disk module and a tubular membrane module. Equipment 
depreciation and maintenance costs are not included. Because the 
rotary disk module, in comparison to the tubular membrane 
module, requires less power for filtration and has a higher 
flux, costs for power can be reduced by about half and costs for 
membrane changes can be reduced by about two-fifths.

<H5>  5. Summary </H5>
  Advanced sewage recycling system (a part of the Aqua 
Renaissance '90 Project) 
  (1) The use of a biological nitrogen removal process has 
enabled us to obtain recycled water of T-N &lt; 5 mg/l, BOD &lt; 
2 
mg/l, SS trace. 
  (2) By maintaining the microorganism concentration in the 
bioreaction tank at 10 to 15 g/l, we have succeeded in 
shortening the treatment time to one-third of that required by 
the conventional biological nitrogen removal method. 
  (3) With the rotary disk module, we have achieved stable 
performance and high flux. We also showed that it is possible to 
drive the rotary disk module with less power than required for a 
plate &amp; frame-type module. 
  Cafeteria waste water re-use system 
  In continuous operation, we obtained a stable supply of 
recycled water with a good quality of BOD &lt; 2 mg/l, SS trace. 
Also, we were able to maintain a flux of approximately 1.5 
m[.sup]3[/]/m[.sup]2[/]d without chemical cleaning.
