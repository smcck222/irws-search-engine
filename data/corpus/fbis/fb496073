<H5>  Abstract </H5>
  Removal of suspended solids from raw water is a basic 
technology in the water treatment to prevent rapid growth of 
cake layers. The conventional technology used for the removal is 
consisted of coagulation, sedimentation and filtration systems. 
However, when quality of raw water changes, the suspended solids 
leak into filtered water, often fouling subsequent RO membrane 
modules. If we can substitute conventional pretreatment system 
with membrane separation technology, the subsequent RO fouling 
will be eliminated and stable operation will become possible. At 
the same time, system will also be simplified. However, there 
have been no appropriate membrane modules applicable for the 
pretreatment system, and very few attempts have been made to 
replace the coagulation, sedimentation and filtration process 
with membrane system. 
  We succeeded in developing a new spiral membrane module 
which 
can directly feed the raw water containing suspended solids. Due 
to its construction with through water channels, this module is 
applicable to the direct feeding of the raw water containing a 
large quantity of suspended solids, promising the possible 
development of its new applications. However, the requirement 
for the application of this membrane separation technology to 
water treatment is the reduction of operational cost, that is, 
an increase in the filtration flux of the membrane module. 
  We studied how to increase the filtration flux from the 
three 
viewpoints: promotion of turbulent flow in raw water, 
coagulation effect and membrane backwashing. As a result, we 
found that intermittent membrane backwashing combined with 
turbulent flow promotion is an effective means to maintain high 
filtration flux of the membrane module. 
<H5>  1. Introduction </H5>
  In the course of membrane filtration, cake layers or gel 
layers are gradually formed on the membrane surface, decreasing 
the filtration rate. The major task of our new membrane module 
is to reduce the formation of cake layers on the membrane 
surface and improve the filtration flux without increasing 
energy consumption. Unless this task is achieved, it is 
difficult to apply the membrane module despite the good quality 
of filtered water. There are two physical solutions available; 
one is a hydraulic solution to increase the mass transfer rate 
by increasing crossflow velocity, and the other is to remove 
cake layers by membrane backwashing. These two solutions have 
been already put into industrial applications by improving 
configuration and operation of membrane modules. 
  In the field of water treatment, a combination of individual 
pretreatment processes (coagulation, sedimentation and 
filtration system) has been employed to remove suspended solids 
from raw water. If membrane separation technology can replace 
all these processes, it will stabilize the quality of treated 
water and minimize the installation area of pretreatment 
systems. Using our newly developed membrane module to which raw 
water can be fed directly, we studied the methods to obtain a 
high filtration flux. 
  The results of our study on the operating conditions of the 
membrane including crossflow velocity, backwashing and raw water 
treatment for obtaining a high filtration flux, as well as the 
results of experiments on the module using the raw water 
containing a large quantity of suspended solids are summarized 
below. 
<H5>  2. Experiments </H5>
  2.1 New Spiral Membrane Module 
  Spiral membrane module is widely used in the water treatment 
system. By designing a unique feed spacer of corrugated 
type[.sup]1[/] (Figure 1), we developed a new spiral 
module[.sup]2,3[/] (Figure 2 [not reproduced]) to which raw 
water containing suspended solids can be fed directly. 
Ultrafiltration membrane is applied to remove colloidal matters 
as well as suspended solids. Table 1 shows the operating 
conditions when raw water is fed to the module.

  2.2 Flat Channel Test Cell 
  Conventional spiral membrane modules are equipped with net 
spacers in the feed channel. For the conventional modules, cake 
layers formed on the membrane surface can be dissociated by 
backwashing, but the cakes are captured in the net spacers and 
not discharged from the module. As a result, backwashing does 
not work in the conventional membrane modules. Our newly 
developed membrane module is equipped with corrugated spacers, 
which can swiftly remove dissociated cakes from the module and 
achieve favorable backwashing effect. 
  To verify the effect of corrugated spacer, we inserted the 
spacer into a flat channel test cell (Figure 3) to simulate a 
practical membrane module and conducted various experiments on 
the cell. The test cell is made of transparent acrylic flat 
channels (3mmH x 40mmW x 840mmL). Figure 4 is a schematic 
drawing of the experimental system. 

<FIG ID=JPRS-JST-018L-24A>      Figure 3. Schematic Illustration of Flat Channel Test </FIG>



<FIG ID=JPRS-JST-018L-24B>       Figure 4. Schematic Drawing of the Experimental System </FIG>


<H5>  3. Results </H5>
  3.1 Filtration Flux in Raw Water Containing Suspended 
Solids 
  To study the turbulent flow promotion effect of the 
corrugated spacer, we provided one section inserted with the 
spacer and another without spacer in the test cell, and compared 
the filtration flux of these sections in tap water. In addition, 
to reproduce the raw water containing suspended solids, we 
injected soft particles, KC Flock (W-100, dp = 77 Êm by 
Sanyo-Kokusaku Pulp Co., Ltd.) into tap water to make the 
concentration of suspended solids to 2,100 mg/liter. 
  Figure 5 shows the time course change in the filtration 
flux. 
With or without the spacer, the membrane surface was colored to 
light yellow and the filtration flux decreased gradually with 
time. We injected KC Flock into the feed water after continuous 
operation for 240 hours when the filtration flux decreased to 
1.5 m[.sup]3[/]/m[.sup]2[/]/day. Immediately after the 
injection of the particles, filtration flux of the section 
inserted with the spacer increased sharply and became stable at 
2.2 m[.sup]3[/]/m[.sup]2[/]/day. On the contrary, 
filtration flux of the section without the spacer tended to 
further decrease after the addition of particles. 

<FIG ID=JPRS-JST-018L-25A>      Figure 5. Filtration Flux in Raw Water Containing Suspended Solid </FIG>


  The light yellow color changed immediately after the 
injection of the particles in the section with the spacer, and 
the white stripes reflecting the patterns of the spacer appeared 
on the membrane surface. Those white stripes are the original 
clean surface of the membrane. We assumed that the particles 
injected into the feed water collided against the membrane 
surface and dissociated the cake layers on the surface. 
  The corrugated spacer which promotes turbulent flow effect 
is 
effective to increase the filtration flux in the raw water 
containing suspended solids. However, the turbulent flow 
promotion effect of the spacer is not sufficient to increase the 
filtration flux when tap water almost free of suspended solids 
is fed. This is because tap water tends to precipitate metallic 
hydroxides and allows formation of rigid cake layers on the 
membrane surface. 
  3.2 Formation of Cake Layer in Tap Water 
  Figure 6 shows the time course change in the filtration flux 
of the flat channel test cell inserted with spacer when tap 
water was continuously fed. The filtration flux decreased with 
time but became stable when it reached 1 
m[.sup]3[/]/m[.sup]2[/]/day. 

<FIG ID=JPRS-JST-018L-25B>      Figure 6. Relationship Between Filtration Flux With Time in Tap Water </FIG>


  It was observed that a large quantity of light yellow 
gelatinous cakes adhered to the membrane surface. when the 
filtration flux was stable, the UF membrane was taken from the 
test cell for analysis. As shown in Table 2, the light yellow 
gelatinous cakes were composed of inorganic substances whose 
major components are iron and aluminum hydroxides and acid 
resistant insolubles like silica, and organic substances at the 
ratios of 77.5 percent and 22.5 percent respectively. Water 
content of the cakes was 96 percent. Assuming the density of the 
cakes as 1.0 g/cm[.sup]3[/], the cake layer was 0.56mm thick.

  Figure 7 shows the relationship between the operating 
pressure and filtration flux, and Figure 8 the relationship 
between the crossflow velocity and filtration flux when the 
filtration flux appeared to be stable. More than 1 
kg/cm[.sup]2[/], the filtration flux is hardly dependent on 
the pressure and less affected by the crossflow velocity. In tap 
water test, the gelatinous cake layers on the membrane surface 
become so rigid and irreversible that hydraulic operation can 
hardly dissociate them from the membrane surface.

<FIG ID=JPRS-JST-018L-26B>      Figure 8. Relationship Between Filtration Flux and Crossflow Velocity in Tap Water Test </FIG>



  3.3 Intermittent Operation and Filtration Flux 
  When the feed pump was stopped during the continuous feeding 
and then started again, dissociation of a part of the gelatinous 
cake layers from the membrane surface, and an increase in the 
filtration flux were observed. 
  Figure 9 shows the results of filtration flux with time when 
tap water was fed intermittently during pump-off period. 
Increment of recovered filtration flux gradually diminished with 
time, but in comparison with the filtration flux obtained under 
continuous water feeding as shown in Figure 6, slightly higher 
filtration flux was observed with the intermittent water feeding. 

<FIG ID=JPRS-JST-018L-27A>      Figure 9. Dependence of Filtration Flux on Time With Intermittent Operation </FIG>




  Although recovery of the filtration flux was limited in the 
intermittent operation alone, the result suggested improved 
filtration rate by dissociation of cake layers. 
  3.4 Feeding Industrial Water to the Membrane Module 
  Examination of the experimental results discussed above 
indicated hydraulic operation and membrane backwashing as the 
important factors for obtaining a high filtration flux. To 
verify the performance of the membrane module in the actual raw 
water containing suspended solids, we fed the industrial water 
heavily contaminated with organic substances to the newly 
developed spiral module. 
  Figure 10 is the flow sheet of this experiment. As we 
assumed 
it was unlikely to obtain a high filtration flux by directly 
feeding the industrial water, we injected poly-aluminum chloride 
(PAC) into the raw water to coagulate suspended solids. Figure 
11 shows the time course change in the filtration flux and the 
pressure loss (_D_P: inlet pressure - outlet pressure). 

<FIG ID=JPRS-JST-018L-27B>      Figure 10. Process Flow Diagram for Industrial Water Test </FIG>



<FIG ID=JPRS-JST-018L-28A>      Figure 11. Relationship Between Filtration Flux, Pressure </FIG>


  Without pH adjustment, the filtration flux decreased with 
time and was never stable. On the other hand, when pH was 
adjusted in a range from 6.0 to 6.5, the optimum coagulating 
condition for PAC, the flux was stable at 2 
m[.sup]3[/]/m[.sup]2[/]/day. Regardless of pH adjustment, 
the pressure loss did not increase, which indicated the limited 
growth of gelatinous cake layers on the membrane surface. 
  With the raw water like tap water containing less suspended 
solids, membrane backwashing alone without pretreatment of raw 
water was sufficient to obtain a high filtration flux. However, 
in the case of industrial water, coagulation of suspended solids 
was also required. We assume that PAC injection coagulated the 
colloidal matters contained in the industrial water and 
transformed them into suspended solids which were easily 
filtrated since they did not adhere to the membrane surface. 
<H5>  4. Conclusion </H5>
  Using raw water such as tap water which hardly contained 
suspended solids but tended to precipitate metallic hydroxides 
and form rigid cake layers on the membrane surface, we studied 
the operating conditions for producing a high filtration flux. 
We also evaluated the performance of our newly developed module 
using the industrial water heavily contaminated with organic 
substances. We obtained the following findings: 
  (1) In the case of tap water, the cakes formed on the 
membrane surface were compounds of inorganic substances mainly 
composed of iron and aluminum hydroxides and organic substances. 
  (2) Membrane backwashing at low pressure hindered compaction 
of the cakes, and combined with the hydraulic operation effect 
caused by turbulent flow, a high filtration flux was maintained. 
  (3) Swelling of cakes before compaction was to dissociate 
them from the membrane surface, and backwashing the membrane at 
high pressure was not necessary. 
  (4) Even with the flat channels of the test cell and the 
spiral membrane module in which corrugated spacers were 
inserted, backwashing became possible by increasing the number 
of membrane supports and distributing water load over the 
surface. 
  (5) In the case of raw water such as industrial water 
containing a large quantity of suspended solids, coagulation of 
the colloidal matters to transform them into suspended solids 
was required to obtain a high filtration flux.

<H5>  Summary </H5>
  A bench-scale membrane/activated-sludge wastewater treatment 
system was built and operated continuously for more than one 
year with peptone/glucose solution as a model waste water. 
During the course of the operation, biological treatment 
conditions such as load, sludge retention time and dissolved 
oxygen level were varied. Effects of these treatment conditions 
on soluble fraction components in the sludge and resulting 
permeate flux of the UF membrane were studied. 
  The permeate flux was in good correlation with the 
differential Dissolved Organic Carbon (DOC) between membrane 
feed and permeate. When sufficient dissolved oxygen (DO) was 
supplied, DOC was produced quantitatively from loaded substrate 
into the bioreactor. With lower DO level (1-2 mg/l), although 
the substrate was still completely digested, production of DOC 
increased. Prediction of permeate flux from biological treatment 
conditions was also attempted to give a guide line for 
controlling biological treatment conditions from a point of 
membrane separation performance.

<H5>  Introduction </H5>
  With increasing need for a compact wastewater treatment 
system and higher quality treatment, membrane technology has 
been introduced as a potential solid-liquid separation process 
for biological wastewater treatment systems. The membrane gives 
high quality, particle free permeate. It eliminates the bulking 
problem of activated-sludge and enables operation at high sludge 
concentration to allow high loading. The membrane seems to 
greatly simplify the system. However, with all these benefits, 
efficiency of the process strongly depends on permeate flux of 
the membrane. The flux is often affected by biological 
substances. In addition, unusually high loading and high sludge 
concentration may produce some substances to cause flux decline. 
It is therefore to be understood how biological treatment 
conditions affect properties of biological sludge and resulting 
flux. 
  In this study, relationship between biological conditions 
and 
membrane performance was examined by using a bench-scale 
membrane/activated-sludge wastewater treatment system with 
peptone/glucose solution as a model waste water. 
<H5>  Experimental </H5>
  Bench-Scale Membrane/Activated-Sludge Wastewater 
Treatment System Setup and Operating Conditions 
  The bench-scale system consists of 0.35 m[.sup]3[/] 
bioreactor (aeration tank) and two 4 inch spiral wound UF 
elements (Figure 1 [not reproduced]). The UF element contains a 
corrugated feed spacer which is specially developed for treating 
feeds containing high suspended solids.[.sup]1[/] A 
polysulfone UF membrane with nominal molecular weight cut off of 
50,000 dalton was used. The system was operated continuously by 
feeding a model wastewater containing peptone and glucose as 
substrates or organic contaminants. Periodically, biological 
treatment conditions were varied within the following range, 
volumetric load (Lv): 0.3-12 kg-BOD/day, sludge retention time 
(SRT): 1.75-35 day, sludge concentration: 4-12 
kg-MLSS/m[.sup]3[/], and dissolved oxygen (DO) level: 1-5 
mg/l. Ten sets of biological conditions were examined. Each set 
of conditions was kept constant until the bioreactor reached 
steady state. Operating pressure of the UF element was about 100 
kPa with 0.5 m/s cross flow rate. The UF element was chemically 
cleaned about once a month. Flux value at one or two weeks after 
the chemical cleaning was used as stable flux for each condition. 
  Analysis of Sludge Components and Membrane Permeate 
  During the operation, indices of organic matter solutes such 
as biochemical oxygen demand (BOD), dissolved organic carbon 
(DOC), sugar, protein were monitored for both the sludge and the 
membrane permeate. Gel-permeation chromatography was also 
applied to investigate molecular weight distribution of organic 
solutes. 
  Batch-Type Cross Flow UF Test 
  Soluble fraction of the sludge sampled from the bioreactor 
was separated by high-centrifugation (9,000 g x 20 min) as 
supernatant, and then applied to batch-type cross flow UF test 
to measure permeate flux. The soluble fraction was circulated 
through a thin channel filtration cell with 0.5mm (height) x 
40mm (width) x 60mm (length) channel was operated at 1.0 m/s 
cross flow rate and about 100 kPa transmembrane pressure. The UF 
membrane used was the same polysulfone membrane used in the 
bench-scale system. Flux value after one week's operation was 
measured and used as stable flux. 
<H5>  Results and Discussion </H5>
  Continuous Operation of the Bench-Scale System 
  The system was operated successfully for more than a year 
without any major trouble. BOD in the permeate was less than 5 
mg/l with 99 percent removal from the model wastewater. Permeate 
flux of the UF element was typically about 0.7 m/day at 
25ÎC. Though the flux was gradually decreased, it was 
restored completely by regular chemical cleaning about once a 
month. 
  Effects of Organic Solutes on Permeate Flux 
  As a preliminary test for investigating the effects of 
solutes on permeate flux of the membrane, a batch-type cross 
flow UF test was performed for soluble fraction of the sludge. 
Stable permeate flux of the soluble fraction from each set of 
biological treatment conditions was measured. Then relationships 
between concentration of various indices for organic solutes and 
the flux were examined. Then, plots of measured flux against 
differential concentration of solute indices were made. As shown 
in Figure 2 [not reproduced], good linear relationships were 
obtained for all the indices. There was no significant 
difference in dependency of the flux to four solute indices 
investigated. DOC was used for further investigation. 
  Effect of Organic Solutes on Permeate Flux of the UF 
Element 
  Permeate flux of the UF element was plotted against the 
differential DOC (_D_DOC) of the sludge and permeate in the 
same 
way as Figure 2. The flux was well correlated to _D_DOC as 
shown 
in Figure 3 [not reproduced]. This result suggests that even 
with suspended solids, the gel polarization theory can be 
applied for the system.[.sup]2,3[/] Then permeate flux J is 
expressed as the following Eqn. (1), 
  J = a + b log (_D_DOC) (1) 
  The values a and b obtained for the plot were 0.054 m/day 
and 
-0.37 m/day respectively. 
  Effects of Biological Treatment Conditions on 
Production of Organic Solutes in Sludge 
  Using DOC as an index for organic solutes in the sludge, 
production of organic solutes was analyzed. 
  For sludge concentration X in the bioreactor, the mass 
balance is described as Eqn. (2), 
  V dX/dt = Y Q[.sub]f[/] C[.sub]f[/] - (Q[.sub]b[/] C 
+ Q[.sub]p[/] C[.sub]p[/]) + _a_k[.sub]d[/] 
XV (2) 
  where, Y is sludge yield from substrate, k[.sub]d[/] is 
endogenous respiration constant. By substituting dX/dt = 0 for 
steady state, and fitting the experimental data to this 
equation, Y = 0.59 (kg-MLSS/kg-BOD), k[.sub]d[/] = 0.0013 
(day[.sup]-1[/]) were obtained. 
  The mass balance for DOC concentration C in the bioreactor 
is 
given by the Eqn. (3), 
  V dC/dt = Y[.sub]s[/] Q[.sub]f[/] C[.sub]f[/] - 
(Q[.sub]b[/] C + Q[.sub]p[/] C[.sub]p[/]) + 
_a_k[.sub]d[/] XV (3) 
  where, Y[.sub]s[/] is yield of DOC from substrate, and _a_ 
is DOC yield from sludge by endogenous respiration. 
  At steady state, dC/dt = 0, then from Eqns. (2) and (3), the 
following Eqn. (4) is derived, 
  C = [Y[.sub]s[/] + _a_ k[.sub]d[/] Y/(k[.sub]d[/] + 
Q[.sub]b[/]/V)] (Q[.sub]f[/] C[.sub]f[/]/V) 
RT[.sub]s[/] (4) 
  where, RT[.sub]s[/] = V/[Q[.sub]b[/] + (1-R) 
Q[.sub]p[/]], which corresponds to retention time of DOC, and 
R is the rejection of the membrane. In this equation, 
Q[.sub]b[/]/V means SRT, Q[.sub]f[/]C[.sub]f[/]/V is 
volumetric load L[.sub]v[/]. Then rearranging the Eqn. (4) 
gives Eqn. (5), 
  C/L[.sub]v[/]/RT[.sub]s[/] = Y[.sub]s[/] + _a_ 
k[.sub]d[/] Y/(k[.sub]d[/] + 1/SRT) (5) 
  With this equation, if the parameters Y[.sub]s[/] and _a_ 
are constant, plots of C/L[.sub]v[/]/RT[.sub]s[/] against 
(k[.sub]d[/] + 1/SRT) should give a straight line. As shown 
in Figure 5 [not reproduced], for operating conditions with 
sufficient dissolved oxygen (&gt;  3 mg/l) experimental data were 
in good linear relationship. It is thus indicated that the yield 
of DOC in the bioreactor, Y[.sub]s[/] was constant within the 
load and SRT range explored. Y[.sub]s[/] = 0.013 
(kg-DOC/kg-BOD), _a_ = 0.15 (kg-DOC/kg-MLSS) were obtained for 
this case. However, the data for low dissolved oxygen around 1 
to 2 mg/l was not included in the linear relationship. Increase 
in DOC production was indicated, even though BOD was still 
completely digested. Permeate flux of the element was also found 
to be lower than the other conditions. 
  Prediction of Permeate Flux From Biological Treatment 
Conditions 
  Using the above-mentioned consideration, prediction of 
permeate flux was attempted. In the Eqn. (1), _D_DOC is 
rewritten as (C - C[.sub]p[/]) = R . C. Then, Eqn. (4) can be 
substituted into the Eqn. (1). Permeate flux value for a given 
sludge concentration at various BOD load can be then calculated 
by using experimentally obtained parameters Y, k[.sub]d[/], 
Y[.sub]s[/], _a_. The result of the prediction is shown in 
Figure 5 with actual measured flux values. Although the 
agreement of the prediction lines with the actual flux values 
still need to be improved, this plot can be used as a guideline 
for controlling biological condition from a point of membrane 
separation. 
<H5>  Conclusions </H5>
  Permeate flux in the membrane/activated-sludge system was 
well agreed to the gel polarization model even high suspended 
solid is contained in the membrane feed. 
  When sufficient dissolved oxygen (&gt;  3 mg/l) was supplied, 
dissolved organic matter in the bioreactor was produced 
quantitatively from loaded BOD within the load range explored, 
which is from 0.3 to 12 kg-BOD/m[.sup]3[/]day. 
  A tentative plot for predicting permeate flux from 
biological 
operating condition was made for the system. It is demonstrated 
that this type of plot can be used as a guideline for 
controlling biological treatment condition in a 
membrane/bioreactor hybrid system from a point of membrane 
performance.

<H5>  Summary </H5>
  As one economical solution to the sludge disposal problem, 
direct thermochemical liquefaction was studied. A demonstration 
plant, which was capable of processing up to 5 t/d as dewatered 
sludge, was operated at the condition of high temperature and 
high pressure (300ÎC, 10 MPa). As a result, about a half of 
organic materials in sludge (48%maf) were converted into 
heavy 
oil and a quarter of the heavy oil synthesized (11%maf) 
were 
separated from the reaction mixture by high pressure 
distillation. Heating values of the heavy oils distilled were 
37-39 MJ/kg. 
  From the calculation of energy balance on a practical scale, 
it was estimated that 1.5 t/d of separated heavy oil could be 
produced as surplus energy through the treatment of 60 t/d of 
dewatered sewage sludge. 
<H5>  Introduction </H5>
  In Japan most of sewage sludge has been treated by 
incineration. However, the costs of conventional incineration 
methods are high because of their high energy consumption. 
Therefore, there is an urgent need to develop economical 
solutions to the sludge disposal problem, and one of these may 
be a direct thermochemical liquefaction. 
  American researchers have developed the direct 
thermochemical 
liquefaction of organic wastes, including urban refuse, 
agricultural wastes and sewage sludge, with synthesis gas and 
catalyst.[.sup]1[/] The direct thermochemical liquefaction of 
sewage sludge without reducing agent[.sup]2[/] and 
methodology of oil separation from liquefied sewage 
sludge[.sup]3[/] have been reported. The authors have 
investigated the liquefaction of sewage sludge under pressurized 
inert gas around 300ÎC and tested a pilot-plant (0.5 
t/d).[.sup]4-6[/] 
  Based on previous studies, a demonstration plant of sludge 
liquefaction was designed and constructed. 
<H5>  Experimental </H5>
  A demonstration plant is schematically shown in Figure 1. 
This plant was capable of processing up to 5 t/d as dewatered 
sludge, equivalent to the sewage treatment scale for about 
20,000 people. In this plant, the dewatered sludge was liquefied 
and distilled under the condition of high temperature and high 
pressure. The sludge was charged into the injection tank, which 
involved the piston in itself, by sludge pump. Then, the sludge 
was pressurized by high pressure water and conveyed into the 
reactor (indiameter 0.43 m, height 7.25 m) continuously by using 
two of the injection tanks by turns. The sludge was pre-heated 
by the vapor of the distillate product at the lower part of the 
reactor and heated to a given reaction temperature by the heat 
medium from electric boiler at the upper part of the reactor. 
The pressure in the reactor was kept at a given reaction 
pressure, which was set near the saturated vapor pressure of 
water at the reaction temperature. The reaction mixture, which 
was almost like a liquid, was distilled while high temperature 
and high pressure was maintained. The distillate and the 
reaction gas was cooled down at the cooler and depressurized to 
atmospheric pressure by let-down valve 1. The distillation 
residue was also depressurized through let-down valve 2 and 
flashed into the flash tank. The vapor sprung in the flash tank 
was condensed at the condenser and was recovered (condensate 
product). The bottom products were also obtained from the bottom 
of the flash tank. 

<FIG ID=JPRS-JST-018L-32A>      Figure 1. Schematic Flowsheet of the Demonstration Plant </FIG>


  Each product recovered (distillate, condensate, and bottom) 
was separated into three phases, that is, heavy oil, solid 
residue, and aqueous phase by means of a solvent extraction. The 
procedure of the separation is indicated in Figure 2. In this 
work, the definition of heavy oil is dichloromethane soluble 
material.

  Operating conditions and profile of starting materials are 
listed in Table 1. Distillate ratio was defined by equation (1).

  Raw mixed sludge (a mixture of raw primary sludge and raw

adding a polyelectrolyte coagulant. The term ``volatile solid'' 
means the content of organic material.

  Table 2 shows the organic material yields in Run 930219. 
Organic material yield was defined by equation (2). 
  Organic material yield (%) = weight of organic

  Heavy oil yield of the distillate (distillable heavy oil 
yield) was 11.2 %maf and the total of heavy oil yield of 
the 
distillate, condensate and bottom was 47.9 %maf. Solid 
residue 
was hardly contained in the distillate. This result means that 
about a half of organic materials in sludge were converted into 
the heavy oil and a quarter of the heavy oil synthesized could 
be separated into the distillate without a contamination of 
solid residue. The composition of reaction gas was mainly carbon 
dioxide (above 99 wt%). 
  Figure 3 shows the relationship between distillate ratio and 
distillable heavy oil yield. Distillable heavy oil yield 
increased with distillate ratio. However, the increase of 
distillate ratio may cause a plugging of the distillation 
residue in the pipe. It was supposed that upper limit of 
distillate ratio was 0.5.

  The heating values of the heavy oils are given in Table 3. 
The heating values of the heavy oils in the distillate indicated 
higher than those in the bottom. In other words, the heavy oil 
of superior quality could selectively be separated by 
distillation from components of heavy oils.

  In order to evaluate the feasibility of the sludge 
liquefaction process on a commercial scale, energy balance was 
calculated based on the data collected. The results are 
illustrated in Figure 4. The capacity of the plant in this 
estimation is 60 t/d as dewatered sludge, equivalent to the 
sewage treatment scale for about 200,000 people. It can be seen 
from Figure 4 that the sludge is treated without any auxiliary 
fuel. Furthermore, 1.5 tons of heavy oil are produced as surplus 
energy. This heavy oil can be available for boiler fuel or 
another application. In conclusion, the treatment of sewage 
sludge by this method could be sufficiently profitable.

<H5>  Abstract </H5>
  With polyether block amide (PEBA) membrane, which is widely 
known as aromatic hydrocarbon selective, study on removal of 
phenol from water by pervaporation was performed. 
  In order to discuss feasibility on pervaporation as 
wastewater treatment process and influence of impurities in 
waste flow to membrane performance, sorption experiments and 
pervaporation experiments were carried out with phenol-water 
binary solution and real industrial wastewater. 
  As the result of these investigations, PEBA membrane showed 
substantial potentiality for application of phenol contained 
wastewater treatment, subject that the wastewater should be 
purified to the required quality by vacuum distillation or other 
appropriate pretreatment. 
<H5>  1. Introduction </H5>
  Wastewater discharged from phenolic resin process contains 
5-10 percent phenol and several substances. Removal of phenols, 
which is difficult to resolve by conventional biological water 
treatment process, is usually achieved by liquid-liquid 
extraction. In this method, use of extraction solvent, i.e., 
methylisobutylketone (MIBK) might be undesirable in respect to 
environmental pollution, energy saving, running cost, etc. 
  An alternative way is dilution with water up to the 
concentration level enable to resolve phenols with biological 
treatment. This way is required for not only huge amount of 
water but also wide area for wastewater treatment system, i.e., 
activated sludge tank, sedimentation tank, etc. 
  Pervaporation is known as effective process for separation 
of 
organic aqueous solution in chemical industry, for example, 
dehydration of organic solvent, particularly formed azeotropics, 
with hydrophilic membrane and recovery of organics from water 
with hydrophobic membrane. The latter case has proposed some 
possibilities for recovery of organics included in wastewater. 
  It is reported by Boddeker et al. that polyether block amide 
(PEBA) offers significant potential for phenol selective 
membrane material. The property of membrane for real wastewater 
treatment is to keep high flux, high selectivity and durability 
for the time required. By utilizing pervaporation with PEBA 
membrane, depletion of phenol concentration in effluents from 
phenolic resin process, shown in Table 1, is discussed and 
compared with the case of binary solution.

<H5>  2. Experimental </H5>
  Sorption Experiments 
  In pervaporation process, separation factor is affected by 
preferential absorption of one of the components of feed liquid 
to the membrane. 
  It seems that to investigate sorption of phenols and other 
components to PEBA membrane is instrumental in evaluating 
pervaporation performance. 
  Small pieces of PEBA membrane (abt. 2 cm x 4 cm), which were 
dried in vacuum drier until no weight decrease was observed, 
were immersed in the sample liquid bottled in flask. After 
sorption equilibrium was achieved (abt. 72 hrs after immersion 
started) the membrane was picked up, blotted with tissues and 
putted in to vacuum evaporator. Weight and composition of liquid 
collected from membrane by vacuum evaporation were measured. 
Phenol-water binary solution and real wastewater were employed 
as sample liquid. Temperature was varied in binary solution 
experiment on 3 levels (30ÎC, 50ÎC and 70ÎC). In 
case of real wastewater, temperature was kept at 50ÎC. In 
order to observe transition of absorption volume, reiteration of 
above sorption procedure were executed both with binary solution 
and real wastewater respectively. 
  Pervaporation Experiments 
  Pervaporation experiments were conducted by batch type glass 
cell test apparatus shown in Figure 1. The effective membrane 
area was 21.05 cm[.sup]2[/]. The pressure at downstream side 
was kept below 1 torr and feed temperature was at 50ÎC. 
Composition of permeate and feed mixture were analyzed by gas 
chromatograph and absorptiometry. 

<FIG ID=JPRS-JST-018L-37A>      Figure 1. Pervaporation Celltest Unit </FIG>


  Total flux, phenol flux and selectivity are measured with 
phenol-water binary and real wastewater. To investigate membrane 
durability, the time required for reduction of phenol 
concentration from 5 percent to 300 ppm were measured in 
reiterative trials. 
<H5>  3. Results and Discussions </H5>
  Sorption Experiments 
  The results of sorption isotherms of phenol-water binary 
solution are given in Figure 2. In this figure, sorption 
quantity of phenol and water into the membrane was given as a 
function of the feed concentration. The sorption of phenols was 
proportionally linear up with increasing phenol concentration. 
In low phenol concentration range (below 1 percent), water 
sorption was constant. However in more than 1-2 percent phenol, 
water sorption was enhanced with increasing phenol 
concentration. With increasing temperature, increase in both 
water and phenol sorption were observed. This shows that with 
increasing phenol concentration in feed, PEBA membrane 
preferably adsorbed more phenol and became gradually swollen. In 
more than 1-2 percent phenol, the swelling of membrane made its 
structure loose enough to permeate water into it. 

<FIG ID=JPRS-JST-018L-38A>      Figure 2. Sorption Isotherms of Phenol and Water in PEBA Membrane </FIG>


  The results of the sorption reiteration with wastewater and 
binary solution are illustrated in Figures 3 and 4 respectively. 
Ratio of weight changes of dried membranes before and after 
immersion was defined as degree of swelling which was indicated 
by black circle in these figures. Sorbed phenol conc. symbolized 
X in these figures, means phenol concentration of the liquid 
collected from sorbed membrane. In spite of concentration of 
phenol sorption in wastewater was lower than that in binary 
solution, the degree of swelling in real wastewater was higher 
than that in binary solution. This may be attributed to several 
substances such as methanol and formaldehydes contained in 
wastewater. 

<FIG ID=JPRS-JST-018L-38B>      Figure 3. Relative Rate of Phenol Sorption From Waste Water by PEBA Membrane </FIG>


<FIG ID=JPRS-JST-018L-39A>      Figure 4. Relative Rate of Phenol Sorption From 5 wt% </FIG>


  As far as two months' continuous experiments, it seemed that 
degree of swelling of membrane was stable for both solutions. 
  Pervaporation Experiments 
  The pervaporation results with real wastewater is shown in 
Figure 5, where phenol flux is symbolized as black circle, water 
flux as black square and separation factor as black triangle. 

<FIG ID=JPRS-JST-018L-39B>      Figure 5. PEBA Membrane Performance </FIG>


  Compared with test results of binary solution, which are 
represented by the full lines in Figure 5, both flux and 
selectivity in wastewater are less than half. These data with 
consideration of sorption experiments, suggest that methanol, 
formaldehydes of other substances contained in wastewater might 
make membrane swollen. Furthermore, low phenol polymers included 
in wastewater accumulated on the membrane and hinder to pass 
through membrane. Thus, it resulted in lower membrane 
performance. 
  Figure 6 shows results of reiteration test with same 
membrane. In twice trial with binary solution, about 120 hrs 
each were required for depletion of phenol concentration less 
than 300 ppm. Then, twice trial with real wastewater were made. 
In first trial, it took about 240 hrs and in second run, phenol 
concentration could not reach less than 1121 ppm even after 309 
hrs operation. On the membrane surface used in this trial, 
reddish brown-color colloidal accumulates were observed. 
Therefore, we tried to devise appropriate pretreatment. As the 
most reliable way to remove these accumulative materials, vacuum 
distillation was adopted as pretreatment of wastewater. 
Condition of vacuum distillation were 100 Torr as operation 
pressure and at 50ÎC as feed temperature. 

<FIG ID=JPRS-JST-018L-40A>      Figure 6. Aging Test of PEBA Membrane With Real Feed </FIG>


  Square marks in Figure 6 indicate pervaporation data with 
wastewater after vacuum distillation. Phenol concentration could 
be decreased from 5 percent to less than 300 ppm in about 200 
hrs. Some results were obtained in successive eight runs. It 
shows that vacuum distillation would be effective as 
pretreatment. 
<H5>  4. Conclusions </H5>
  Through these experimental results, the following findings 
were obtained: 
  1) Using PEBA membrane, phenol concentration in water could 
be reduced from 5 percent up to less than 300 ppm, which was the 
concentration enable to resolve by conventional biological water 
treatment system. 
  2) Due to some substances contained in wastewater from 
industrial phenolic resin process, membrane performance was 
decreased. 
  3) According to sorption experiments, some substances in 
wastewater other than phenol caused swelling of membrane. 
  4) Vacuum distillation is effective as pretreatment for 
removal of harmful substances in wastewater.

<H5>  Summary </H5>
  Waste water from wheat starch production was treated by a 
membrane combined two phase methane fermentation system with 20 
kg/m[.sup]3[/]-day of COD loading. The following satisfactory 
results were obtained: BOD and SS concentration in the system 
effluent was under 50 mg/l and 90 mg/l respectively. More than 
99 percent of organic matter was removed. About 40,000 kcal of 
methane gas energy was recovered in an operation of 12-22 
kg/m[.sup]3[/]-day, and the average methane gasification rate 
and sludge yield rate were 0.33 
Nm[.sup]3[/]-CH[.sub]4[/]/kg-COD removed, and 0.12 
kg-VSS/kg-COD removed respectively. 
<H5>  Introduction </H5>
  Many industries, such as the food industry require an energy 
efficient system to treat the waste water, which may contain 
high strength dissolved and suspended organic matter. Anaerobic 
waste water treatment systems had advantages over aerobic ones 
in not only energy efficiency but less sludge yield and 
production of gas useful for fuel, but, on the other hand, had 
some drawbacks, such as unstability in treatment and high 
effluent concentration. 
  The process of anaerobic degradation roughly consists of 
acidogenesis, where organic matter degrades into organic acid, 
and methanogenesis, where organic acid degrades into methane and 
carbon dioxide. However, these two processes have to be 
separated in order to offer desirable circumstances that allow 
each bacteria to work in each process.[.sup]1,2[/] This has 
proven to be very difficult in actual operation. 
  A membrane combined two phase methane fermentation system 
has 
been developed to overcome such difficulties of anaerobic 
treatment. In this system, a membrane is placed between the 
acidogenic and methanogenic phase. Therefore, undegraded organic 
matter, SS and acidogenic bacteria remain in the acidogenic 
reactor (AR), and the methanogenic reactor (MR) is fed with 
membrane filtrate, mainly containing organic acid which can be 
utilized by methanogenic bacteria. One difficulty with this 
system is that SS is retained in the AR. This system was tested 
with wheat starch waste water containing high strength SS, and 
degradation of organic matter and organic loading was studied. 
<H5>  Pilot Plant </H5>
  Flow of Pilot Plant 
  Figure 1 shows the flow diagram of the pilot plant, which 
consisted of fixed bed AR, UASB[.sup]3[/] MR and membrane 
module. The feed water was the waste water from a wheat starch 
and gluten producing plant, owned by Nagata Industry Co., Ltd. 
The pH of waste water was adjusted in the feed tank and pumped 
to the heat exchanger, which recovers heat from the effluent 
from the MR. The preheated waste water was heated again to 
37ÎC by steam injection before being fed to the AR. The 
effluent from the AR was fed to the membrane module, and the 
filtrate was fed to the MR and the concentrate was recycled to 
the AR. The effluent from the MR was finally discharged out of 
the system through the heat exchanger. The gas produced in both 
reactors was desulfurized in the desulfurization towers, 
reserved in the gas holder and then discharged out of the 
system. Table 1 shows the specification of the pilot plant.

  Analysis of Waste Water 
  In the making of wheat starch and gluten are separated from 
wheat flour by water. 11-15 times as much water as wheat flour 
is used in the process and is then discharged as waste 
water.[.sup]4[/] Table 2 shows the results of an analysis of 
the waste water, which was sampled at 9 am.

<H5>  Results and Discussion </H5>
  COD Loading 
  To evaluate the efficiency of the system, the COD loading 
rate is contrasted with the TOC removal rate in Figure 2. The 
loading rate is per total capacity of the AR and the MR. As 
shown in Figure 2, the removal rate decreases a little as the 
loading rate increases. With 20 kg/m[.sup]3[/]-day of COD 
loading rate, however, 99 percent of TOC removal rate was kept 
and more than 99.8 percent of BOD removal rate was recorded. As 
a result, it is clear that the system can treat wheat starch 
waste water containing high strength SS with more than 20 
kg/m[.sup]3[/]-day of COD loading. 

<FIG ID=JPRS-JST-018L-45A>      Figure 2. Relation Between TOC Removal Rate and COD </FIG>


  Analysis of Waste Water 
  Table 3 shows the results of the analysis of the effluent in 
each process. The concentration of the AR effluent is higher 
than that of the feed water because undegraded matter and 
bacteria were concentrated by the membrane. The BOD of MR 
effluent mostly levels off at 50 mg/l and the SS concentration 
at about 100 mg/l. As the membrane filtrate, which is fed to the 
MR, contains no SS, all SS in the MR effluent is considered as 
biomass. The results prove the system could efficiently and 
stably treat waste water to a level of purity high enough to 
allow discharge into a river.

  Degradation in AR 
  The efficiency of AR to degrade organic matter was evaluated 
with the ability of liquefaction, total carbon amount of 
produced gas and membrane filtrate TOC to influent to AR, which 
was calculated per week. The gasification ratio was defined as 
the amount of carbon in produced gas to influent TOC. Figure 3 
shows the liquefaction ability and gasification ratio. Each 
ratio, of which the average was 86.5 percent and 23.6 percent 
respectively, decreased a little as COD loading increased. The 
excess sludge was extracted with a fixed ratio to feed amount 
from the reactor. Therefore, the increase of COD loading 
resulted in a concentration of membrane concentrate, which led 
to an increase in the amount of carbon in the sludge extraction. 
The 63 percent, carbon ratio of liquefaction minus that of gas 
shown in Figure 3, is carbon ratio fed to MR via membrane. 

<FIG ID=JPRS-JST-018L-46A>      Figure 3. Liquefaction and Gasification Ratio vs. COD </FIG>


  On the other hand, volatile fatty acid production is the 
most 
important degradation reaction in the AR. Figure 4 shows main 
volatile fatty acids content change with time in membrane 
filtrate. In Figure 4, propionate and n-butyrate content 
increased gradually over time, and COD loading increased too. it 
is likely that the acetogenesis reaction reaches its limit by 
the increase of COD loading. However, acetic acid content 
changed with time, and decreased greatly from 130 to 200 days. 

<FIG ID=JPRS-JST-018L-46B>      Figure 4. Main Volatile Fatty Acids Content vs. Elapsed </FIG>


  Figure 5 shows the change in the rate gas production over 
time in the AR. Because the gas production rate in this period 
increased, it is likely that methanogenic bacteria transformed 
acetic acid into gas. In order to operate the AR normally, it 
was necessary to suppress gas production to prevent severe 
foaming in the reactor. A decrease in the amount of methanogenic 
bacteria was attempted by drawing the excess sludge from the AR. 
As a result of the suppression of gas production in the reactor, 
the acetic acid content of filtrate increased and normal 
operation was maintained. 

<FIG ID=JPRS-JST-018L-47A>      Figure 5. Gas Production Ratio vs. Elapsed Time </FIG>


  Degradation in MR 
  The efficiency of degradation of the MR can be evaluated 
with 
the index of the TOC removal rate. Figure 6 contrasts the TOC 
removal rate with the COD loading in the reactor. While the rate 
decreased a little with the increase of COD loading, it was 
always over 98 percent even with 30 kg/m[.sup]3[/]-day of COD 
loading. This was because the influent to the reactor, which 
mostly consisted of organic acid and did not contain SS, was 
good for the USAB to operate most efficiently. Of the TOC 
removed in the reactor, approximately 96 percent was gasified 
and 2.5 percent transferred to bacteria, which indicates that 
the organic matter fed to the reactor had almost completely 
degraded. 

<FIG ID=JPRS-JST-018L-47B>      Figure 6. TOC Removal Rate vs. COD Loading Rate </FIG>


  Gas Production 
  The gas produced from the both reactors consisted of 62 
percent methane and 38 percent carbon dioxide, and amounted to 
7.6 Nm[.sup]3[/]/m[.sup]3[/]-feed waste water (2.0 in AR, 
5.6 in MR). Taking the energy level into account, when 1 
m[.sup]3[/] of waste water was treated, 40,000 kcal of energy 
with gas of about 5,400 kcal/m[.sup]3[/] was produced. 
  Figure 7 contrasts methane yield rate with the COD loading 
in 
the AR, the MR and the system. The methane yield rate in the 
system has little influence over the increase in COD loading. 
However, it decreases a little in the AR and increases in the 
MR. This is because organic acid content of AR effluent increase 
with the rise of COD loading, and as a result high strength 
organic acid was fed to the MR. Methane produced in the AR 
amounted to only one-fifth of that in the system, which meant 
that the acidogenesis reaction occurred mainly in it. The 
average gas yield rate of the system recorded high 0.336 
m[.sup]3[/]-CH[.sub]4[/]/kg-COD removed.[.sup]5[/] 


  Biomass Yield 
  Figure 8 contrasts the biomass yield rate per removed 
organic 
matter with COD loading. The biomass yield rate in the each 
reactor increases with the rise of the rate of COD loading. In 
this system, all SS separated is retained by the membrane in the 
AR. In spite of the many degradation reactions going on in the 
reactor, the organic matter removed is a little amount of gas 
and biomass. Almost organic matter flows out in the form of 
volatile fatty acid from the AR. Therefore average SS yield rate 
for removed organic matter was 0.248 kg-SS/kg-COD removed in the 
AR, a value which was comparatively high.[.sup]6[/] However, 
this is only 0.106 kg-SS/kg-COD removed for the whole system. On 
the other hand, the biomass yield rate of the MR was few 0.020 
kg-SS/removed COD,[.sup]7[/] because it was membrane filtrate 
containing more than 92 percent of organic acid that was fed to 
the reactor. That of the whole system was rather high 0.126 
kg-SS/removed COD, which is a good result considering that the 
waste water contained high strength SS and the system operated 
with high loading rate.

  Membrane Module 
  The membrane unit operated with constant amount of filtrate, 
and the linear velocity on the membrane surface was kept of 0.9 
m/sec for energy saving in this test. As a result, the flux per 
operating pressure was highly affected by SS concentration on 
the membrane surface. The membrane was regularly washed with 
reverse flow of membrane filtrate but not washed by any other 
method. The membrane could maintain the flux for SS 
concentration of 30,000 mg/l by washing with the filtrate, which 
proved the membrane was usable for treating high SS 
concentration solution. 
<H5>  Conclusions </H5>
  The pilot test fully proved the efficiency of the system. It 
surpasses other state-of-the-art reactors in treatment 
efficiency, high removal rate of organic matter and gasification 
rate as well as compactness of size. From these results, the 
anaerobic treatment was considered to be useful for low strength 
waste water as well as high strength waste water.

<H5>  Introduction </H5>
  Research and development on a methane fermentation treatment 
process, which would consume less energy and generate less 
excess sludge than treatment with activated sludge, would have 
significant implications. However, cases of sewage treatment by 
methane fermentation are very rare, and the application of this 
technique outside of tropical and subtropical areas would 
involve many problems yet to be solved. 
  The development of a field test was conducted on a scale of 
240 m[.sup]3[/]-d[.sup]-1[/]. The target was to establish 
a bioreactor system capable of achieving a 60 percent or higher 
gasification rate for organic matter in sewage, supplied at an 
organic load of 2 kg BOD-m[.sup]-3[/]-d[.sup]-1[/] or more. 
<H5>  Properties of Raw Sewage </H5>
  The properties of raw sewage are shown in Table 1. The ratio 
of dissolved organic matter to total organic matter is only 18 
to 25 percent.

<H5>  Process Flow </H5>
  A flow sheet of the process is shown in Figure 1. 

<FIG ID=JPRS-JST-018L-49A>      Figure 1. Process Flow Sheet of Field Test Plant for Sewage Treatment </FIG>


<H5>  Charging of Seed Sludge </H5>
  The anaerobic bioreactor (UASB) and hydrolyzation reactor 
were fed with seed sludge. The seed sludge for UASB was imported 
from the Netherlands. Its volume was 30.4 m[.sup]3[/], about 
40 percent of the UASB volume, and it had 78,000 
mg-l[.sup]-1[/] of TS and 58,000 mg-l[.sup]-1[/] of VS, or 
1,778 kg as VS. 
  The seed sludge for the hydrolyzation reactor was digested 
sludge in the existing treatment plant and had a volume of 6.55 
m[.sup]3[/], or 67.9 kg as VS. UASB started out treating 56 
m[.sup]3[/]-d[.sup]-1[/], and the treatment volume 
increased in stages as determined by the characteristics of the 
effluent. In three months, treatment volume reached 240 
m[.sup]3[/]-d[.sup]-1[/]. 
<H5>  Results </H5>
<H5>  Hydrolyzation Reactor </H5>
  The results are shown in Table 2. When the SRT was 445 days 
and the temperature in the reactor was 25ÎC, 84.8 percent of 
the VSS charged was decomposed, and methane gas was generated at 
a rate of 335 l per kg of the charged VSS or 395 l per kg of the 
decomposed VSS. When the SRT was 144 days, the VSS decomposition 
rate was 76.8 percent. Judging from the fact that the VSS 
decomposition rate reached only about 40 percent at 25ÎC 
without membrane separation, such results are attributable to 
the combination with the membrane separation system. When the 
return from the tank to concentrate the backwashing of the 
aerobic reactor was charged together, its ratio to the total 
charged VSS, increased from 30 percent to 39 percent, and from 
52 percent to 70 percent of the VSS decomposed at an SRT of 25 
to 29 days at 25ÎC. In this case, methane gas was generated 
at a rate of from 153 l to 206 l per kg of the decomposed VSS. 

  The concentrated water of the backwash mainly consisted of 
excess sludge from the aerobic reactor. It is far more difficult 
for this water to undergo hydrolyzation and solubilization than 
the concentrated water from the suspended solids separation 
device, and the higher its proportion in the charged VSS to the 
hydrolyzed liquid, the lower the VSS decomposition rate gets. 
When the proportion of the VSS from the concentrating tank of 
the backwash to the total charged VSS was about 35 percent, with 
no membrane separation system combined, the VSS decomposition 
rate would be around 45 percent at 35ÎC. The VSS 
decomposition rate of 52 percent or more at 25ÎC is thus 
attributable to the use of the membrane separation system. 
<H5>  Membrane Module System </H5>
  The membrane module system is designed to treat hydrolyzed 
liquid from the hydrolyzation reactor. Physical characteristics 
and the operating conditions are indicated in Table 3. A 
cross-flow filtering method is used, and the operation is 
carried out at a constant membrane linear velocity.

<H5>  Anaerobic Bioreactor (UASB) </H5>
  The pH and oxidation-reduction potential in the anaerobic 
bioreactor remained stable at 6.6 to 7.2 and -430 to -470 mV, 
respectively. The mean temperature in this reactor was 
17.8ÎC. 
  The BOD and SS content of the water inflow were reduced at 
20ÎC from 140 mg-l[.sup]-1[/] to 68 mg-l[.sup]-1[/] 
and from 178 mg-l[.sup]-1[/] to 59 mg-l[.sup]-1[/], 
respectively, while the daily volume of excess sludge generated 
was 8.4 kg, or 0.035 kg per m[.sup]3[/] of waste water. 
  Both sides of the anaerobic bioreactor are provided with 15 
sampling valves at 200-mm intervals between a height of 300mm 
and 3,100mm from the bottom. The liquid in the reactor was 
sampled with these valves to measure the VSS, and the results 
are shown in Figure 2. After the rated treatment capacity of 240 
m[.sup]3[/]-d[.sup]-1[/] came to be fully utilized, the 
distribution of the concentration hardly varied, standing at 
10,000 mg-l[.sup]-1[/] in the vicinity of the 
gas-solid-liquid separating section. 

<FIG ID=JPRS-JST-018L-51A>      Figure 2. Distribution of VSS Concentration in Anaerobic Bioreactor </FIG>


  The part in which the VSS was 10,000 mg-l[.sup]-1[/] or 
more was assumed to be the effective volume of the anaerobic 
bioreactor, and the load on this effective volume was 
calculated. The results showed that the load on the effective 
volume was 1.7 kg-m[.sup]-3[/]-d[.sup]-1[/] in terms of 
BOD, or 2.8 kg-m[.sup]-3[/]-d[.sup]-1[/] in terms of COD. 
When the backwash discharge from the aerobic reactor was 
returned to the separating device (filter), the load became 2.0 
kg-m[.sup]-3[/]-d[.sup]-1[/]. 
  When the temperature in the reactor reached about 20ÎC, 
the gas conversion rate changed from 44 percent to 84 percent in 
terms of BOD, or from 22 percent to 53 percent in terms of COD. 
The gas conversion rate in terms of BOD (COD) is defined by the 
oxygen required to completely oxidize the methane produced to 
the total BOD (COD) load. 
  The number of granules in the reactor 230 to 320 days after 
beginning treatment of 240 m[.sup]3[/]-d[.sup]-1[/] is 
shown in Table 4. A granule was defined as being larger than 
0.5mm[.sup]2[/], and the number of granules is based on the 
number present in 1 ml of the mixed liquor. 



  -----------------------------------------------------------------------------

----------------------------------------------------------------------------- 


  The number of granules decreases from the lower part close 
to 
the inlet pipe towards the upper part in the reactor. In the 
effective volume, there are from 100 to 150 granules per ml. 
  There is a clear difference in the concentration of calcium 
ions between seeding sludge and SS in raw sewage, as shown in 
Table 5. 



  ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 
|Table 5. Concentration of Calcium Ion                                        |

------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 


  According to this fact, measuring the calcium concentration 
in the granules at 260 to 300 days after beginning treatment of 
240 m[.sup]3[/]-d[.sup]-1[/] confirm to the theory that 
the granules partly consist of seeding sludge and partly of SS 
in raw sewage. Some of the seeding sludge becomes thin depending 
on the load. 
  The methanogenic activities of the liquid samples in the 
reactor, taken from the bottom, middle, and top layers of the 
anaerobic bioreactor, were measured by the following method. 
Measuring the volume of methane product under shaking the vials 
after being put the substrate, formic acid or acetic acid, into 
on the constant load. [as published] The shaking temperature was 
equalized to that in the reactor at the time of sampling. 
  Methanogenic activity is significantly affected by the 
temperature in the bioreactor. The acetic acid-fermenting 
methanogenic activity was found to be higher in the middle and 
bottom layers than in the top layer. 
<H5>  Aerobic Reactor </H5>
  Air for aeration was 1.8 Nm[.sup]3[/] per m[.sup]3[/] 
of treated water. Backwashing was automatically conducted twice 
a day by each reactor. When backwashing water was 75 
m[.sup]3[/]-d[.sup]-1[/] and backwashing air 60 
Nm[.sup]3[/]-d[.sup]-1[/], the backwashing effect was 
sufficient to keep the SS concentration in the drainage after 
backwashing below 100 mg-l[.sup]-1[/]. 
  The mean values of BOD and SS in the treated water were 10 
mg-l[.sup]-1[/] and 8.9 mg-l[.sup]-1[/], respectively, 
under a volumetric organic load of 1.9 
kg-BOD-m[.sup]-3[/]-d[.sup]-1[/]. BOD reduction rate was 
81.5 percent, and SS reduction rate was 84.7 percent. 
<H5>  Conclusion </H5>
  The average quality indicators of the input water were 173 
mg-l[.sup]-1[/] in BOD and 197 mg-l[.sup]-1[/] in SS, and 
those for the treated water were 10 mg-l[.sup]-1[/] in BOD 
and 8.9 mg-l[.sup]-1[/] in SS. The average temperature in the 
anaerobic bioreactor was 17.8ÎC. When a flow was used in 
which the drain from the backwashing of the aerobic rector was 
treated within the system and the average temperature in the 
anaerobic bioreactor was 20ÎC, the BOD and SS contents of 
the final treated water were 13 mg-l[.sup]-1[/] (4.4 
mg-l[.sup]-1[/] in ATU BOD) and 8.4 mg-l[.sup]-1[/], 
respectively. 
  When the average temperature in the anaerobic bioreactor was 
no less than 20ÎC, a gas conversion rate of 60 percent or 
more (in terms of BOD) was attained. 
  Excess sludge was generated at a daily rate of 8.46 kg from 
the hydrolyzation reactor and 8.4 kg from the anaerobic 
bioreactor. The daily rate from the whole plant was 16.86 kg, 
which amounts to 0.07 kg per m[.sup]3[/] of raw sewage. 
  When followed by post-treatment with an aerobic reactor, 
treatment with the two-phase methane fermentation system 
comprising a hydrolyzation reactor combined with separating 
membranes and a sludge blanket bioreactor (UASB) was found to 
steadily provide treated water of about 10 mg-l[.sup]-1[/] 
both in BOD and in SS. The volume of excess sludge was 0.07 kg 
per m[.sup]3[/] of raw sewage. This suggests that anaerobic 
treatment of raw sewage may be feasible in other than tropical 
and subtropical areas. The results also indicate that less 
excess sludge was generated than when using activated sludge. 
  Regarding the hydrolyzation reactor combined with separating 
membranes, the reduction rate for volatile suspended solids 
charged into the membrane fermentation reactor reached from 76.8 
percent to 84.8 percent under the condition that the temperature 
in the reactor is 25ÎC and only the raw sludge was charged 
from the separating device. 
  Charging into the methane fermentation reactor the sludge 
mixed the concentrated backwashing with the separated sludge 
from the separating device, the reduction rate for volatile 
suspended solids showed from 52 percent to 70 percent at 
25ÎC. Such high reduction rates for volatile suspended 
solids is attributable to the additional use of a membrane 
separation system.

<H5>  Summary </H5>
  Since 25 June 1992 the Bureau has been operating an advanced 
water purification facility which is a combination system of 
ozonation and biological activated carbon treatment -- to remove 
musty odor. 
  The treatment performance of this system is getting good 
results in treated water quality, because the facility can 
remove not only the musty odor substance (2-methyl isoborneol), 
but can also reduce the Anionic surfactants, Ammonia nitrogen 
and Trihalomethane formation potential consistently and 
effectively. In the year since the facility was introduced, the 
musty odor has been removed from purified water, according to 
our expectations, at the Kanamachi Purification Plant. 
<H5>  Introduction </H5>
  The Tokyo Metropolitan Government Bureau of Waterworks 
supplies purified water to about 12 million citizens in Tokyo. 
The total distributed amount per year was 1,783,310,000 cubic 
meters in fiscal 1992 and this year the maximum distributed 
amount per day was 5,780,000 cubic meters. The Bureau has 11 
purification plants including Kanamachi, Asaka, Higashi-murayama 
and others. The total purification capacity is 6,959,500 cubic 
meters per day (cf. Table 1). The raw water is obtained from 
three river systems as follows, the Tone River (80 percent), the 
Tama River (17 percent), and the Sagami River (3 percent).

  The Kanamachi purification plant is a very large plant. It 
has a daily purification capacity of 1,600,000 cubic meters -- 
that is about 23 percent of the Bureau's total purification 
capacity. This plant supplies purified water to about 2,500,000 
citizens. In recent years, at the Kanamachi purification plant, 
the pollution of raw water has occurred due to urbanization of 
the Edo River valley (cf. Figure 1). 

<FIG ID=JPRS-JST-018L-53A>      Figure 1. Fiscal Change of Raw Water Quality (Kanamachi P.P.) </FIG>


  In particular since 1972, the Kanamachi purification plant 
had been faced with the problem of the musty odor of the 
purified water in the summer season. As the result of an 
investigation, it was proved that the musty odor source 
substance is 2-Methyl isoborneol (2-MIB). So since 1984, we have 
coped with the musty odor problem with a powdered activated 
carbon adsorption treatment. But, the variation of 2-MIB 
concentration in raw water is so remarkable that the powdered 
activated carbon adsorption treatment did not prove sufficiently 
effective in musty odor removal (cf. Figure 2). So, in August 
1989, the Bureau started the construction of an advanced water 
purification facility, which is a combination system of 
ozonation and biological activated carbon (BAC) treatment to 
remove musty odor more effectively and consistently in the 
Kanamachi purification plant. As the first phase, an advanced 
water purification facility with the daily purification capacity 
of 260,000 cubic meters -- that is about one-sixth of the total 
daily purification capacity and is about one-fourth of the 
average daily distribution amount -- was established on June 25, 
1992. We are now supplying the advanced purified water by mixing 
uniformly with water purified by the conventional processes. 

<FIG ID=JPRS-JST-018L-54A>      Figure 2. A Case of Relation Between 2-MIB Conc. in Raw </FIG>


  The advanced water purification facility removes musty odor 
efficiently and also is effective in producing safer and tastier 
water, because it reduces Ammonia-Nitrogen (NH[.sub]3[/]-N), 
Anionic surfactants and Trihalomethane formation potential 
(THMFP). This facility's design and construction was based on 
the results of investigations and experiments conducted at the 
pilot plant for six years from 1984. As this facility is the 
first commercially operating plant for the Bureau, we are 
continuing various investigations and experiments to verify the 
results of experiments with the pilot plant and to get data and 
practical knowledge for the application and introduction of 
future phases and new projects. 
  Meanwhile, we would like to give a summary of the advanced 
water purification facility and the quality of the water 
purified with this facility. 
<H5>  The Summary of the Advanced Water Purification Facility and </H5>
Its Operational Condition 
  The advanced water purification facility in the Kanamachi 
purification plant consists of ozonation and BAC treatment and 
is installed between the sedimentation and the filtration 
processes. 
  The treatment process is as follows: Settled water is 
directed to the advanced water purification facility after 
coagulo-sedimentation without pre-chlorination. At this time, 
odor components and others are decomposed effectively by the 
strong oxidizing power of ozone and removed by activated carbon 
adsorption and biological oxidation with microorganisms. Next, 
the treated water is chlorinated (middle stage chlorination) and 
conveyed to the rapid sand filters. The purified water is 
distributed to users after disinfection with post-chlorination 
and pH adjusting. 

<FIG ID=JPRS-JST-018L-54B>      Figure 3. Flow Chart of Advanced Water Purification </FIG>


  The ozone contact basins (5 basins) are up-and-down flow 
type 
with three stage chambers. The effective depth of water is 6.0 
m, the contact time is 12 minutes, and the maximum ozone feeding 
rate is 3 mg-ozone/l (ppm). The each contact basin have a 
retaining chamber (retention time: 6 min). [as published] The 
ozone feeding rate varies due to the ozonized air feeding ratio 
in each chamber of the contact basin. The ozonized air feeding 
rate is three-sixths of the total feeding in the first chamber 
of the contact basin. In the second chamber, it is two-sixths, 
and it is one-sixth in the third chamber. The ozone feeding rate 
is controlled to keep the dissolved ozone concentration constant 
-- that is 0.2 ppm in treated water at exit of the retaining 
chamber. Generally, the ozone feeding rate is around 1 ppm, but 
it is changed according to the water quality (cf. Figure 4). 

<FIG ID=JPRS-JST-018L-55A>      Figure 4. Ozone Contact Basin </FIG>


  The activated carbon adsorption facility consists of 12 
basins, and the effective filter area is 100 square meters. The 
granular activated carbon used here is made of coal. The 
effective size is 1.2mm, the uniformity coefficient is 1.3, the 
bed depth is 2.5 m, and the linear velocity is 250 m per day 
(the empty bed contact time is about 15 minutes). The 
backwashing is carried out once every three to four days. The 
BAC filter is washed with air and water for four minutes, and 
then washed with water for 10 minutes (cf. Figure 5). 

<FIG ID=JPRS-JST-018L-55B>      Figure 5. A Backwashing Program of the BAC Adsorption Basin </FIG>


<H5>  Treatment Performance </H5>
  (1) 2-Methyl isoborneol (2-MIB) 
  In 1992, the condition of the Edo River was good because of 
the high level of precipitation from June to the middle of July 
-- the end of the rainy season. For this reason, 2-MIB in raw 
water showed a comparatively low value which was 65 ng/l at 
maximum value in July. The maximum value of 2-MIB in raw water 
rose up to 77 ng/l in August, and 140 ng/l in September, because 
there had been very little rain after the end of the rainy 
season. However, even though the 2-MIB concentration in raw 
water changed significantly, the removal of 2-MIB was carried 
out completely. About 20 percent of the 2-MIB is removed by 
coagulo-sedimentation and all of the rest is done by the 
combination of ozonation and BAC adsorption (cf. Figure 6). The 
maximum load of 2-MIB in the advanced water purification 
facility has been 120 ng/l. At that time 2-MIB was 7 ng/l in the 
ozone treated water and it was all removed all in the BAC 
treated water. 

<FIG ID=JPRS-JST-018L-55C>      Figure 6. 2-MIB Conc. and Removal Rate Against Raw Water </FIG>


  (2) Anionic surfactants (MBAS: Methylene Blue Active 
Substances) 
  The concentration of MBAS in raw water became comparatively 
higher in winter. It is assumed that the dilution rate is lower 
due to the decrease of the river flow and the biological 
decomposition activity in the river is lower due to the decrease 
of water temperature. The monthly MBAS average in fiscal 1992 
gradually became higher. For example: 0.09 mg/l in November, 
0.16 mg/l in December, and 0.21 mg/l in January. The maximum 
value was 0.52 mg/l in January. However, the water temperature 
was low (average water temperature was 6.4ÎC in January 
1993), the MBAS removal rate of BAC treated water against raw 
water was about 40 percent, and the treated water maintained a 
low concentration extremely well (cf. Figure 7). 

<FIG ID=JPRS-JST-018L-55D>      Figure 7. MBAS Conc. and Removal Rate Against Raw Water in </FIG>


  (3) Extinction coefficient at 260 nm (UV260) 
  It is said that the created quantity of trihalomethane is 
affected by the existence of organic substances which have 
unsaturated bond. Therefore, we measured UV260 value to 
supplement THMFP data and to make a representative index of 
organic substances. 
  Each one-third of UV260 value of raw water were decreased by 
the coagulo-sedimentation treatment and the ozonation treatment 
respectively. The UV260 value was very low after BAC adsorption 
treatment (cf. Figure 8). 

<FIG ID=JPRS-JST-018L-56A>      Figure 8. Extinction Coefficient at 260 nm off Process Water </FIG>


  Although in early passage the UV260 value of BAC treated 
water tended higher gradually, the rate soon become stable. It 
is supposed that this indicates the decline of the adsorption 
capacity of the granular activated carbon and that the BAC 
treatment performance becomes stable because of the oxydizing 
effect of microorganisms. 
  (4) Trihalomethane formation potential (THMFP) 
  The removal rate of THMFP by the advanced water purification 
treatment was nearly 100 percent at the first passage, because 
the activated carbon was fresh. But, after that the removal rate 
decreased gradually and it has been consistently at about a 
little over 60 percent since about six months after the first 
passage (treated water quantity is 15,000 times as much as the 
activated carbon quantity). The phenomenon that THMFP increases 
in ozonation did not appear in our investigation, in which the 
ozone feeding rate was changed from 0.5 to 2.0 ppm (cf. Figures 
9 and 10). 


<FIG ID=JPRS-JST-018L-56B>      Figure 9. Transition of THMFP Removal in Advanced </FIG>

<FIG ID=JPRS-JST-018L-56C>      Figure 10. THMFP in Process Water; ozone dosage is varied. </FIG>

  (5) The NH[.sub]3[/]-N removal and biological activity in 
the BAC 
  NH[.sub]3[/]-N can not be removed by ozonation treatment, 
but it can be decomposed during BAC treatment by the 
microorganisms which grow on the granular activated carbon. 
  After the first passage, the NH[.sub]3[/]-N removal rate 
gradually rose in the activated carbon adsorption basin, and in 
about two weeks it reached 100 percent (cf. Figure 11). It was 
assumed that in about two weeks in summer, the function of the 
BAC would be as indicated (cf. in Figure 11 -- the test passage 
term was before June 24). The NH[.sub]3[/]-N removal 
maintained a good rate. Also in winter, NH[.sub]3[/]-N was 
removed completely (cf. Table 2). Considering other analysis 
results -- such as the decrease of the dissolved oxygen and the 
heterotrophic bacteria colony counts -- it is supposed that the 
biological activity in the BAC layer was also very active even 
under low water temperature.

<H5>  Verification of Ozone Feeding Rate in Summer </H5>
  We established four ozone feeding rates that are 0.5, 1.0, 
1.5, 2.0 ppm at each contact basin, and we analyzed 2-MIB, UV260 
and dissolved ozone etc. at each of the three chamber exits and 
retaining chamber exits of each ozone contact basin. One result 
is shown in Figures 12 and 13.

<FIG ID=JPRS-JST-018L-57B>      Figure 13. Dissolved Ozone in Contact Basin Under Several </FIG>

<H5>  Conclusion </H5>
  The advanced water purification facility is consistently 
getting good results in regards to 2-MIB, which is the principal 
subject material to be removed; as well as with anionic 
surfactants, THMFP and NH[.sub]3[/]-N. 
  We have insured ``safer and tastier'' which has no musty 
odor 
by operating the advanced water purification facility for 
one-fourth of the total amount and carrying out the powdered 
activated carbon treatment for the other three-fourths. 
  In future, we would like to analyze a number of questions 
such as: the optimum ozone feeding rate; the time to the 
breakpoint of granular activated carbon; the suitable washing 
method of the BAC adsorption bed and the characteristic change 
of the activated carbon. In addition we would like to make use 
of the results for the proper operation of the facility and 
further advanced water purification process introduction.

<H5>  Abstract </H5>
  An experiment has been carried out at test plant for 
small-scale sewage that consists of a pretreatment unit, a 
suspended solid (SS) methanization reactor with a membrane 
module, and a nitrogen removal unit. After continuous 
experiments, the SS removal rate in the pretreatment unit was 
found to be more than 80 percent, the reduction rate of the 
Volatile Suspended Solid (VSS) in the SS methanization reactor 
was 51-79 percent under temperature conditions of 25-35ÎC 
and HRT 4.2-10.2 days, and the effluent from the nitrogen 
removal unit was stable at BOD of less than 2 mg/l and T-N of 
less than 5 mg/l. 
<H5>  Introduction </H5>
  Since 1988, this test plant experiment has been carried out 
as a part of the AQUA RENAISSANCE'90 PROJECT (a national project 
of the Ministry of International Trade and Industry of Japan). 
The objective of this Project is to develop a new system based 
on a combination of bioreactor and separation membrane 
technology, which can efficiently treat industrial waste water 
or sewage to recover methane gas from organic matters contained 
therein. In this study, sewage was treated. Today, in developing 
a new sewage treatment system, energy saving, minimization of 
sludge production, improvement of treated water quality, 
environmental protection, and such like, must all be taken into 
account to meet the needs of the times. 
  The greater part of organic matter contained in sewage is in 
the form of suspended solids (SS). In the system used for this 
study, SS separated from sewage is treated in a methane 
fermentation (SS methanization) reactor combined with a 
separation membrane module, while SS-separated sewage is 
subjected to removal of nitrogen and organic matter in a reactor 
combined with a separation membrane module. 
  Flow Diagram 
  Figure 1 shows the flow diagram for this experiment. 

<FIG ID=JPRS-JST-018L-58A>      Figure 1. Flow Diagram </FIG>


  The sewage is separated into low SS effluent and 
concentrated 
SS by the pretreatment unit. Then, the separated SS are treated 
in the SS methanization reactor combined with the SS separation 
membrane module. The low SS effluent from the pretreatment unit 
and the permeate of the membrane are mixed and treated in the 
nitrogen removal unit combined with the rotary disk membrane. 
This test plant has a capacity of 10 m[.sup]3[/]/day in the 
basic design. 
  Characteristics of the Units 
  Table 1 shows the characteristics of each unit in this 
system. 

  Raw Water 
  Raw sewage from the existing sewage treatment plant was used 
as the raw water for this experiment. The properties of the raw 
water are shown in Table 2.

<H5>  Results </H5>
  Pretreatment Unit 
  By utilizing polyurethane sponge as the collection material, 
this unit was able to operate efficiently and continuously 
removing SS efficiently, without being clogged. The SS 
concentration of raw and pretreated water, and the SS removal 
rate are shown in Figure 2 and Figure 3. The SS removal rate was 
continuously more than 80 percent and the unit was able to 
steadily supply concentrated water of a SS concentration higher 
than 10,000 mg/l. 

<FIG ID=JPRS-JST-018L-59A>      Figure 2. SS Concentration </FIG>



<FIG ID=JPRS-JST-018L-59B>      Figure 3. SS Removal Rate </FIG>


  SS Methanization Reactor 
  The concentrated SS from the pretreatment unit was 
solubilized and methane-fermented in this reactor at long SRT by 
combination with the SS separation membrane. 
  We investigated acid fermentation and methanization in 
mesophilic and thermophilic fermentation in two periods using 
the organic membrane and inorganic membrane. The reason we 
report the results of the methanization in two periods is 
because the solubilization rate of SS in the acid fermentation 
was lower than that in the methanization. SS concentration and 
VSS/SS ratio (percent) in the reactor under the long operation 
of mesophilic methanization are shown in Figure 4 and Figure 5. 
The data in Table 3 shows the results of the representative 
mechanization of SS. 

<FIG ID=JPRS-JST-018L-59C>      Figure 4. SS Concentration in the Reactor </FIG>


<FIG ID=JPRS-JST-018L-60A>      Figure 5. VSS/SS Ratio in the Reactor </FIG>


  The outline of the results in the methanization are as 
follows: 
  -- The VSS reduction rate under the thermophilic 
methanization ranged from 67 to 78 percent, but the difference 
between the mesophilic and thermophilic methanization was not 
big in view of the heating energy. The mesophilic conditions 
were therefore better. 
  -- In the mesophilic conditions, at 35ÎC, the VSS 
reduction rate was 51-79 percent (solubilization rate based on 
TOC was 45-56 percent) under the VSS volumetric load of 
0.93-1.94 Kg/m[.sup]3[/]-day and the HRT of 4.2-8.4 days. 
This efficient treatment compared with the conventional 
anaerobic digestion of SS in HRT of 15-30 days was reached by 
combination with the membrane module. 
  -- Decreasing the temperature from 30 to 25ÎC in the 
reactor did not greatly influence the VSS reduction rate. It was 
possible to maintain a rate from 67 to 70 percent with a VSS 
volumetric load of about 1 Kg/m[.sup]3[/]-day. 
(Solubilization rate was 52 percent.) 
  -- The volume of recovered methane from charged VSS was 
maintained from 270 to 317 l/Kg-VSS except for one case. 
  SS Separation Membrane Unit 
  Separation and returning of SS to the reactor by this 
inorganic membrane unit guaranteed a long SRT and the permeate 
contained almost no SS (SS &lt; 1 mg/l). 
  The results of the long time operation are shown in Figure 
6.[.sup]1[/] The permeate flux was maintained at 0.6-1.0 
m[.sup]3[/]/m[.sup]2[/]-day and the membrane module could 
be operated for the liquid containing high concentration SS 
(55,000 mg/l). TOC of the permeate was different between the 
mesophilic methanization (10-30 mg/l) and thermophilic 
methanization (500-1800 mg/l). Figure 7 shows the 
characteristics of the permeate flux to the SS concentration and 
membrane surface flow rate.[.sup]1[/] 

<FIG ID=JPRS-JST-018L-61A>      Figure 6. The Results in Long Operation </FIG>


<FIG ID=JPRS-JST-018L-61B>      Figure 7. Characteristics of the Permeate Flux </FIG>


  Table 4 shows the optimum conditions and the performance of 
this membrane unit. In this case the power consumption for 
membrane permeate was 6.92 Kwh/m[.sup]3[/]-permeate 
(efficiency 51 percent). That value is not big because the 
quantity of the concentrated SS into the SS methanization 
reactor was about 1 percent of the raw sewage water.

  Nitrogen Removal Unit 
  After removal of more than 80 percent SS in the pretreatment 
unit, the pretreated water was fed into a nitrogen removal unit 
comprising a denitrification tank, nitrification tank and rotary 
disk type membrane module. For the rotary disk membrane module, 
polysulfone membranes having a cut-off molecular weight of 
750,000 were mainly used. 
  When the denitrification tank had the same volume as the 
nitrification tank, the total nitrogen (T-N) removal rate was 
about 75 percent when methanol was added to the inlet water. 
Without the addition of methanol, this rate was about 52 
percent. At a volumetric T-N load of 0.24 kg/m[.sup]3[/]-day 
in the nitrification tank, and with 40 mg/l of methanol added, 
the BOD and T-N of treated water did not exceed 2 mg/l and 5 
mg/l, respectively. 
  After the denitrification tank was transformed to increase 
its volume twofold, it was possible to obtain treated water with 
a BOD of less than 2 mg/l and T-N of less than 5 mg/l without 
addition of methanol at a volumetric T-N load up to 0.14 
kg/m[.sup]3[/]-day. In this case, the permeate flux was about 
1.2 m[.sup]3[/]/m[.sup]2[/]-day under the operating 
pressure of 0.2 kg/cm[.sup]2[/] and MLSS of 14,000-15,000 
mg/l.[.sup]2[/] 
  Water Quality 
  An example of the water quality in the system is shown in 
Table 5. 

<H5>  Conclusion </H5>
  The pretreatment unit was able to supply the low SS water 
(removal rate &gt;  80 percent) and concentrated SS (SS &gt; 
10,000 
mg/l) steadily and continuously. So the methanization of the 
concentrated had a higher efficacy rate in the reactor combined 
with the membrane (VSS reduction rate of 51-79 percent 
(solubilization rate of 45-56 percent), HRT of 4.2-10.2 days, 
temperature at 25-35ÎC, permeate flux of 0.6-1.0 
m[.sup]3[/]/m[.sup]2[/]-day). The low SS water was treated 
by the nitrogen removal unit and effluent was of high enough 
quality to be reused (BOD &lt; 2 mg/l, T-N &lt; 5 mg/l). 
  On the other hand, this system was able to connect the 
simple 
aerobic treatment unit for the pretreated water in exchange for 
the nitrogen removal unit.

<H5>  1. Introduction </H5>
  In recent years, with the adoption of higher density in 
semiconductor integrated circuits, the quality requirements for 
ultrapure water have become increasingly higher purity. 
  Actually, it has been required to remove dissolved oxygen 
(hereinafter referred to as DO) from ultrapure water, in order 
to prevent growth of the native oxide layers on water surfaces. 
  The conventional processes for removal of DO from water 
include physical processes (e.g., vacuum degassing, purging with 
N[.sub]2[/] gas) and chemical process involving the addition 
of reducing agents with catalyzer. In achieving an extremely low 
concentration of DO by the conventional degassing processes, 
there are some problems; e.g., a large facility will be 
required, they will occur the increase of impurities, and a 
large amount of N[.sub]2[/] gas will be required. 
  This paper describes not only the method of reducing DO to 5 
ppb or less by UV ray, but also the decomposition and removal of 
TOC by UV ray. 
<H5>  2. Removal of DO by Using UV Ray </H5>
<H5>  2.1. Experimental and Principle </H5>
  DO reacts with hydrogen by irradiating UV ray which contains 
a wavelength of 185 nm. However, the reaction between DO and 
hydrogen does not occur by using UV ray of more than 254 nm. 
  Figure 1 shows the test equipment. Hydrogen gas was employed 
as the reducing agent and dissolved in water by using a 
gas-permeable membrane module. The gas-permeable membrane was 
polyolefine hollow fiber type. 

<FIG ID=JPRS-JST-018L-63A>      Figure 1. Experimental Equipment </FIG>


  Hydrogen gas dissolves in water because of the pressure 
level 
of difference outside to inside of membrane. Accordingly, it was 
easy to control very small amount of additional gas. Moreover, 
gas bubbles were not remained in water. 
  Low pressure mercury lamps and thimble tubes, which were 
used 
synthetic quartz glass, were installed in a UV reactor. 
  Irradiating water contained hydrogen with UV ray of 185 nm, 
DO or dissolved hydrogen (DH) is excited and DO reacts with DH 
to become water as follows. 
  1/2 O[.sub]2[/] + H[.sub]2[/] O* + 2H* 
H[.sub]2[/]O [h_n_ above first right arrow] 
<H5>  2.2. Effect of Water Depth </H5>
  UV of 185 nm wavelength is absorbed by water very well. It 
is 
necessary to bring DO and DH into contact with UV light zone, in 
order to gain higher efficiency of UV reactor. 
  Accordingly as depth of water layer increased, DO removing 
percentage of UV reactor went down as shown in Figure 2. 
Furthermore, the effect of water was strong according as 
retention time decreased. 

<FIG ID=JPRS-JST-018L-63B>      Figure 2. Depth of Water Layer and DO Removing Percentage </FIG>


  It is desirable to decrease water depth as thin as possible. 
However, on producing UV reactor it is difficult that the depth 
becomes 5mm or less. Accordingly, the retention time of actual 
UV reactor needs more than 20 seconds and form of buffer plates 
in UV reactor are devised. 
<H5>  2.3. Effect of Hydrogen Dosage </H5>
  Effect of hydrogen dosage injected into water was tested by 
using two kinds of UV reactors: One had UV lamp's output power 
level of 650 w and another had 1550 w. The results of the test 
are shown in Figure 3. Figure 3 shows the relationship between 
the rate of DO reaction efficiency and the amount of hydrogen 
indicated by 2H[.sub]2[/] per O[.sub]2[/] ratio. 

<FIG ID=JPRS-JST-018L-64A>      Figure 3. 2H[.sub]2[/]/O[.sub]2[/] Ratio and Rate of DO Reaction Efficiency </FIG>


  In case of A to have scarce intensity of UV irradiation, 
hydrogen per oxygen ratio is had to become more than four, in 
order to make the rate of DO reaction efficiency become one. 
However, in case of B to have enough intensity of UV 
irradiation, the rate of DO reaction efficiency becomes one if 
H[.sub]2[/] per O[.sub]2[/] ratio is more than 1.2. 
  DO concentration of influent is not constant at actual DO 
removal treatment. 
  Accordingly, excess amount of hydrogen gas is injected into 
water. 
<H5>  2.4. DO Removal Performance of Actual Equipment </H5>
  DO removal performance of actual equipment which had 
treatment ability of 10 m[.sup]3[/]/h, is shown in Figure 4. 
Additional dosage of hydrogen gas was one and a half times of 
H[.sub]2[/] per O[.sub]2[/] ratio for initial DO 
concentration of 100 Êg/l. 

<FIG ID=JPRS-JST-018L-65A>      Figure 4. DO Removal Performance </FIG>


  It kept always constant even if initial DO changed. It was 
enough satisfied to reduce the residual DO in treated water to 5 
Êg/l or less at initial DO of less than 100 Êg/l. 
  Furthermore, if initial DO is less than 30 Êg/l, it is 
possible to reduce DO to 1 Êg/l or less. 
<H5>  3. Decomposition of TOC by Using UV Ray </H5>
  It is known that the UV ray of 185 nm is able to decompose 
low molecular organic compounds without oxidizer. Accordingly, 
decomposition of TOC and removal of DO simultaneously achieved 
by using a same vessel of UV reactor. 
  TOC is decomposed into several kinds of organic acids and 
carbonic acid by UV irradiation. For example, decomposition 
products of ethylalcohol is shown in Table 1.

  This result was obtained under the conditions that flow rate 
of treatment was 300 l/h and a 70 w low pressure mercury lamp 
was used. 
  As a result, it seems to increase percentage of unknown 
matters according to an increase of initial ethylalcohol 
concentration. However, TOC of more than 80 percent was 
decomposed into several kinds of organic acids, particularly 
acetic acid, and carbonic acid. These organic acids and carbonic 
acid are easily removed by a conventional anion exchange resin. 
  As a result of long running actual equipment operation, TOC 
of treated water has stably become 2 to 3 Êg/l at initial TOC 
level from 10 to 20 Êg/l. 
<H5>  4. Ultrapure Water Unit at Used Point </H5>
  As shown in Figure 5, ultrapure water unit, which is used at 
a close point to the ULSI manufacturing place, consists of the 
following components: a gas permeable membrane module dissolving 
hydrogen, a UV reactor, modules of membrane deaerator for 
reducing residual dissolved hydrogen, ion exchange cartridge 
polishers, ultrafiltration membrane and non-particle pumps. 

<FIG ID=JPRS-JST-018L-66A>      Figure 5. Flow Sheet of Advanced Ultrapure Water Unit </FIG>


  Needless to say, 254 nm of UV ray has a sterilizing effect. 
  Therefore, this process has ability not only for removing of 
DO and TOC but also for the sterilizing of ultrapure water. 
  Table 2 shows water quality of the advanced ultrapure water 
unit.

<H5>  5. Conclusions </H5>
  1) Decomposition of TOC and removal of DO are simultaneously 
achieved by using a same vessel of UV reactor. This process does 
not cause any increase in impurities. 
  2) This process is very suitable to place as close to used 
points as possible, because of very compact size.

<H5>  Introduction </H5>
  Attempts to treat wastewater using new anaerobic digestion 
techniques have attracted great interest. 
  Certain wastewaters generated from pulp and paper mills have 
been treated, or attempted to be treated, by anaerobic 
digestion.[.sup]1-8[/] Treatment of sulfite or 
thermomechanical pulp discharges by anaerobic digestion has been 
proven to be successful, and is noted for its low cost and 
energy efficiency.[.sup]6-8[/] In Japan, however, dissolved 
sulfite pulp and thermomechanical pulp account for only 1.7 
percent and 7.3 percent of total pulp output, respectively. 
Treatment by anaerobic digestion has not yet been applied to 
discharges from kraft pulp mill plants, the combined output of 
which comprises a more than 75 percent share of overall pulp 
production.[.sup]9[/] 
  Evaporator condensate (EC) from the kraft pulp (KP) 
production process contains methanol as the main carbon source. 
Methanosarcinaceae, Methanococcaceae were 
known as methanol-utilizing methanogens.[.sup]10[/] Anaerobic 
digestion of these discharges has been difficult because 
sulfides or terpene-like oils, which are characteristic 
components in the wastewater, inhibit methanogenic 
growth.[.sup]4-5[/] As the shapes of these methanogens were 
irregular cocci and they did not make granulation like 
filamentous methanogen, application of porous materials or 
membrane system has been considered to be effective for their 
microbial retention. 
  In this paper, removing the oils, such as terpenes or sulfur 
compounds by microfiltration (MF) membrane and by a gas 
stripping system, the thermophilic anaerobic digestion of 
evaporator condensate was investigated using a fixed-bed reactor 
packed with porous pumice stone and ultrafiltration (UF) 
membrane modules for microbial retention. 
<H5>  Experimental </H5>
  Wastewater Characteristics and Additional Mineral 
Salts 
  Some analytical results of EC discharges are listed in Table 
1. The discharges contain high concentrations of organic matter, 
mainly methanol, and are discharged at relatively high 
temperatures (40-80ÎC). They also contain foul-smelling 
sulfur compounds, such as hydrogen sulfide, methyl mercaptan 
(MM), dimethyl sulfide (DMS), and dimethyl disulfide (DMDS), 
lignin-like materials, and small amounts of terpene 
oils.[.sup]4[/] 
  Since the raw EC did not contain minerals or nutrients, some 
mineral salts and nutrients were added to the raw EC as the 
previous report.[.sup]11[/] 

  Pilot Scale (5 m[.sup]3[/]) Bioreactor 
  A schematic diagram of the pilot plant is shown in Figure 1. 
The effective volume of the bioreactor was 5 m[.sup]3[/], and 
the fixed-bed was constructed with 3 m[.sup]3[/] of pumice 
stone (mean diameter: 3 cm, pore size: 50-100 Êm, the average 
void ratio: 76 percent). One m[.sup]3[/] of plastic support 
media (pole ring size 1 inch; specific surface area, 207 
m[.sup]2[/]/m[.sup]3[/]; void volume, 90 percent) was also 
packed to avoid channeling. Activated anaerobic sludge was 
inoculated as a seed sludge. EC from the KP plant was stored in 
a raw wastewater tank (a). After automatic pH adjustment in an 
oil separator (b), sulfur compounds in the wastewater were 
stripped and removed by evolved gas from the bioreactor (c). 
Concentrated oily materials were sent to a drain tank. Oily 
compounds were separated by a MF membrane module (e: pore size, 
0.2 Êm, made of Teflon). Filtrate was sent to a preparation 
tank (d), where the pH was adjusted to between 6.8 and 7.0 by 
injecting doses of NaOH. The prepared wastewater was sent to the 
anaerobic bioreactor. The temperature of the bioreactor was 
monitored and maintained at 53ÎC by thermostat. A UF 
membrane module (h: Kurita Water Treatment; graduatable 
molecular weight, 2 x 10[.sup]6[/]; made of polysulfone) or 
inorganic membrane module (g: Toto Kiki; pore size, 0.16 Êm; 
made from alumina) was provided for cells retention and 
recycling. Evolved biogas was desulfurized (i) and then burned 
(k). 

<FIG ID=JPRS-JST-018L-68A>      Figure 1. Schematic Diagram of Pilot-Scale Plant </FIG>


  Analyses 
  Analyses of methanol, acetate, propionate, gas components, 
sulfur compounds, total organic carbon (TOC) and BOD were 
measured by the same methods described in the previous 
report.[.sup]11[/] 
  HRT (d), TOC loading (kg-TOC/m[.sup]3[/]/d), BOD loading 
(Kg-BOD/m[.sup]3[/]/d), gasification based on TOC (percent), 
gasification based on BOD (percent), gas yield based on TOC 
(m[.sup]3[/]gas/Kg-TOC), and methane yield based on TOC 
(m[.sup]3[/] CH[.sub]4[/]/Kg-TOC) were calculated as the 
previous report.[.sup]11[/] 
<H5>  Results and Discussion </H5>
  Performance of Pilot Plant With MF Membrane 
  A creamy-oily constituent of EC, which included sulfur 
compounds, a small amount of many kinds of terpenes, their 
alcohols, and their aldehydes, was suspected as the inhibitor of 
the methane fermentation process.[.sup]4[/] As the result of 
a feasibility study on inhibitor removal, a MF membrane made by 
Teflon was selected for its resistibility, and confirmed that 
about 90 percent of the oily substances could be removed. 
  The results of continuous operation of the pilot-scale plant 
with the MF membrane are shown in Figure 2. Continuous feeding 
of the raw wastewater was started at 10 kg-BOD/m[.sup]3[/]/d 
(4.2 kg-TOC/m[.sup]3[/]/d). After 1 month, the loading had 
increased to 21.2 kg BOD/m[.sup]3[/]/d (7.0 kg 
TOC/m[.sup]3[/]/d), and 87.4 percent gasification based on 
BOD (78.8 percent of gasification based on TOC) and 91.8 percent 
BOD removal were attained. MLSS in the bioreactor also increased 
to 7.1 g/l with the UF membrane module system. After 1 month 
run, acetic acid was generated and gas production declined 
(Figure 2, arrow A). Afterwards the loading was reduced from 
25.2 kg-BOD/m[.sup]3[/]/d (8.1 kg-TOC/m[.sup]3[/]/d) to 
6.5 kg-BOD/m[.sup]3[/]/d (2.1 kg-TOC/m[.sup]3[/]/d) 
(Figure 2, arrow B). 

  There was some recovery, and the loading was slowly 
increased 
for a while, but the generation of volatile fatty acids 
continued and digester efficiency declined again (Figure 2, 
arrow C). The cause of the decline in digester efficiency was 
suggested to be that the concentration of inhibitive sulfur 
compounds in raw EC increased, and the sulfur compounds were not 
removed sufficiently by MF membrane (Table 2). 

<FIG ID=JPRS-JST-018L-68A>      Figure 2.Continuous Operation of the Bioreactor of with </FIG>

   Performance of the Bioreactor With MF Membrane and 
Stripping System 
  To remove the inhibitive sulfur compounds in raw EC, a 
stripping system using evolved gas from the digester was fitted 
to the oil separator. Under the stripping condition of 20 
m[.sup]3[/] of evolved gas/m[.sup]3[/]-raw EC, and at an 
oil separator tank temperature of 60ÎC, more than 80 percent 
of sulfur compounds were removed, but most of the methanol, the 
substrate for methanogen, remained (Table 2). Using this 
pretreated EC as a feed for the digester, continuous operation 
was carried out at a feed rate of 10 m[.sup]3[/]/d. 
  After loading was started at 30 kg-BOD/m[.sup]3[/]/d (9.3 
kg-TOC/m[.sup]3[/]/d), it was increased to 35 
kg-BOD/m[.sup]3[/]/d (10.6 kg-TOC/m[.sup]3[/]/d). No 
methanol remained in the effluent. Actual total gas and methane 
gas yield based on supplied TOC corresponded to the theoretical 
values, 1.45 m[.sup]3[/]/kg-TOC and 1.08 
m[.sup]3[/]/kg-TOC, respectively. The generation of volatile 
fatty acid was less than 300 mg/l through the operation period. 
The average loading was 35.5 kg-BOD/m[.sup]3[/]/d (10.7 
kg-TOC/m[.sup]3[/]/d) and the average BOD removal was 93 
percent through this operation period. The MLSS was kept at more 
than 7.6 g/l (Figure 3). 

<FIG ID=JPRS-JST-018L-70A>      Figure 3. Continuous Operation of the Bioreactor With MF </FIG>

<FIG ID=JPRS-JST-018L-71A>      Figure 4. Effect of UF membrane for microbial </FIG>



  The carbon and sulfur balance between pretreated EC, 
effluent 
and produced gas are shown in Table 3. From these data, it can 
be seen that 76.9 percent (41.2 kg/d) of supplied carbon (53.6 
kg/d) was changed into biogas, and 5.6 percent (3.0 kg/d) of it 
was thought to be changed biomass. Since DMDS was not found in 
the biogas as an effluent, DMDS seemed to have been changed into 
mm and H[.sub]2[/]S on the basis of the material balance. 
About 86.4 percent of inlet sulfur was contained in the evolved 
gas. 

  Effect of UF Membrane for Microbial Retention 
  A UF membrane was fitted to the fixed-bed bioreactor, and 
was 
able to provide effective microbial retention (Figure 3, max. 
9.4 g/l). The performance of the pilot-scale fixed-bed 
bioreactor with and without the UF membrane was compared (Figure 
4). When the loading was increased without the presence of the 
UF membrane, methanol remained at 15 kg-BOD/m[.sup]3[/]/d 
(5.5 kg-TOC/m[.sup]3[/]/d) loading. 

  By fitting the UF membrane to avoid microbial wash out, a 
loading more than 2 times as high (35.5 kg-BOD/m[.sup]3[/]/d, 
10.7 kg-TOC/m[.sup]3[/]/d) could be attained without residual 
methanol in the effluent. 
  Effect of Interruption by Feed Stoppage 
  Discharge of EC from the KP mill was sometimes stopped for 
various reasons, such as overhauling of the plant, machine 
repair, and so on. The stability of digester performance against 
interruption by feed stoppage was examined. After interruption 
by feed stoppage for 40 days, anaerobic digestion of EC was 
restarted at a loading of 10 kg-BOD/m[.sup]3[/]/d (4.2 
kg-TOC/m[.sup]3[/]/d), and after 2 days, the loading was set 
at 20 kg-BOD/m[.sup]3[/]/d (6.8 kg-TOC/m[.sup]3[/]/d). In 
the first 4 days, about 100 mg/l of acetic acid and propionic 
acid was generated, but no remarkable difference in digester 
performance was observed compared with the performance before 
the stoppage (Figure 5). 

<FIG ID=JPRS-JST-018L-72A>      FIGURE 5. </FIG>


  Economic Feasibility Study 
  The running costs of three methods (case 1, aerobic 
treatment 
system; case 2, anaerobic treatment with UF membrane + post 
aerobic treatment system; and case 3, anaerobic treatment 
without UF membrane + post aerobic treatment system) for the 
treatment of pulp and paper wastewater are compared in Table 4. 
&lt;graphic&gt; &lt;/graphic&gt; 

  The general assumptions for the treatment costs calculation 
were as follows: In the case 1, wastewater mixture (200 
mg-BOD/l, 160,000 m[.sup]3[/]) was treated at loading of 1.2 
kg-BOD/m[.sup]3[/]/d using a 27,000 m[.sup]3[/] aeration 
tank; in the case 2, EC (25 g-BOD/m[.sup]3[/], 400 
m[.sup]3[/]/d) was treated by anaerobic digestion at 35 
kg-BOD/m[.sup]3[/]/d using a 290 m[.sup]3[/] digester with 
UF membrane, and in the case 3, the EC was treated at 15 
kg-BOD/m[.sup]3[/]/d using a 670 m[.sup]3[/] digester 
without UF membrane, and in the case 2 or 3, the other 
wastewater was treated by aerobic treatment. In the aerobic 
treatment process, half the weight of influent BOD was converted 
to sludge (in the case 1, excess sludge yield was 16t dry-SS/d; 
in the case 2 or 3, excess sludge yield was 11.85t dry-SS/d). 
Evolved methane gas was 3,100 m[.sup]3[/]/d, and the energy 
was converted as the price of heavy oil. The conversion rates 
were as follows: electric power, &yen;16/kwh; price of heavy oil 
(&yen;25/l, 10,000 kcal/l); heat of methane combustion, 8,000 
kcal/l; UF membrane replacement (&yen;20,000/m[.sup]2[/], 
every three years); chemicals (N,P manure &yen;85,000/t, 
NaOH-&yen;69,000/t); treatment of excess 3 sludge, 
&yen;10,000/t; labor cost (1 person/year, &yen;4,015,000/year). 
  Anaerobic treatment with UF membrane + post aerobic 
treatment 
was more economical than aerobic treatment only, and reduction 
in total cost of &yen;194,000/d and &yen;1.22/m[.sup]3[/] 
wastewater were achieved because of energy recovery by evolved 
methane gas, with less production of excess sludge and less 
electric power consumption. In the case 3, total cost was 
reduced by &yen;0.13/m[.sup]3[/] wastewater compared with 
that of case 2 because of less electric power consumption and no 
membrane replacement cost.

<H5>  Summary </H5>
  Water resources for water supply of Tokyo depend on mainly 
surface water from many dams and rivers in the Kanto province, 
and ground water in a part of Tokyo. But because of increasing 
of water demand and retardation of water resource development, 
water shortage has occurred every several years. 
  The Tokyo Metropolitan Government (TMG) announced the new 
policy to conserve the limited water resource, and has 
implemented several measures to promote the consumer's 
consciousness of water-saving, use of reclaimed water and 
development of water-saving appliances. With the water for 
miscellaneous use (= nonpotable use), the TMG has encouraged 
``reuse of treated wastewater,'' ``use of industrial water for 
miscellaneous use,'' and ``use of rainwater.'' According to 
three types of reclaimed water systems; individual building-, 
limited area-, and broad area recycling system, the TMG 
established a guideline for the water for miscellaneous use. 
  This paper described background of the issue, contents of 
the 
guideline, results of the promotion and theme in future. 
<H5>  Introduction </H5>
  Tokyo is located in the south of the Kanto plain, in the 
middle of the Japanese archipelago. It has an area of about 
2,182 km[.sup]2[/], which is 0.6 percent of Japan's total 
area. Tokyo is one of the largest cities in the world with the 
resident population of 12 million, the daytime population of 
approximately 14 million. 
  Tokyo has continued to extend and develop as the capital 
city 
of Japan and the center of the country's political, economic, 
social, cultural and international activities. 
  However, as a result of the rapid urbanization and the 
concentration of population, Tokyo is faced with many difficult 
problems such as strain and delay of urban infrastructure, 
deterioration of the living environment and so on. Besides, the 
excessive concentration of business in the central part of Tokyo 
promoted the change in the pattern of land use, and the change 
in the working pattern from residential to commercial, and an 
increase in multistory buildings has caused high concentration 
of population more over. 
<H5>  Waterworks in Tokyo </H5>
  The TMG supplied potable water to the approximately 11.00 
million citizens living in the approximately 1,174 
km[.sup]2[/] area comprised of the 23 special wards and the 
22 cities and 3 towns in the Tama area. 
  The TMG takes most of its raw water from the three rivers 
flowing through or nearby the Tokyo metropolitan area: the Tone 
river, which supplies about 79 percent of the gross raw water, 
the Tama River about 17 percent and the Sagami River about 3 
percent. In addition to this, the TMG takes some raw water from 
the ground water in the Tama district. At present, the TMG 
secures water sources equivalent to 6.02 million 
m[.sup]3[/]/day in total and this figure is approximately 
commensurate with the demand. However, some of these water 
sources are not fully reliable as water source facilities have 
not been completed fully and the intake rate of water is 
occasionally restricted according to the situation of river 
flows and storage in dam reservoirs. 
  Moreover, water demand likely increases gradually as a 
result 
of urbanization in the Tama area, the western suburbs of Tokyo, 
and will reach 6.70 million m[.sup]3[/]/day by the year 2000. 
  The TMG operates 11 purification plants, which are capable 
to 
treat 6.96 million m[.sup]3[/]/day. This represents one of 
the largest water purification systems in the world. Table 1 
shows the outlines of waterworks in Tokyo.

<H5>  Water Shortage and Restriction on Water Supply </H5>
  At present water demand of Tokyo is nearly equivalent to its 
water resources. However, the water source is not yet reliable 
enough, so that the TMG's water intake is restricted 
occasionally during the water shortage period in summer. 
  Water intake was restricted 9 times and water supply was 
restricted 8 times in this past 20 years. Table 2 shows the 
history of water shortage.

<H5>  The Guideline for the Use of Miscellaneous Water </H5>
  The water demand in Tokyo has increased year by year during 
the 1960s and 1970s. Increase of 1.2 million m[.sup]3[/]/day 
in every five years during those days had taken place along with 
rapid economic growth of Japan. Hereafter water demand in Tokyo 
is also expected to increase slightly but steadily. At the same 
time, it is becoming more and more difficult to develop new 
water resources, which are now recognized as limited. It has 
been necessary for Tokyo to become a water conservation 
conscious city. In 1973, TMG announced the new policy on 
conserving the limited water resource and has been promoting 
measures through campaigns of voluntary saving and through 
development and commercialization of water saving equipment. The 
TMG also continues to promote the recycling of water. 
  In 1974, the TMG began to promote use of reclaimed water in 
large buildings in order to utilize water effectively and to 
reduce the load to sewerage systems. And in 1984, the TMG 
established the guideline for the recycling of wastewater, and 
has promoted above-mentioned measures more over. 
  In Tokyo, there are three types of reclaimed water systems 
according to its capacity as follows: 
  (1) Individual Building System: Type that an individual 
building has its own reclaiming equipment to treat its own 
wastewater and rain water on its given premises. The treated 
water is utilized for miscellaneous use within the building. 
  (2) Limited Area System: Type that several buildings in 
relatively limited district, for example large apartment 
complexes and urban redeveloped area, have a common reclaiming 
equipment to treat wastewater. 
  (3) Broad Area System: Type that many buildings in broad 
area 
use largely and widely reclaimed water which is usually supplied 
from sewage treatment plant or industrial water works. 
  An aim of the guideline is formation of a water saving city 
to promote use of reclaimed water in large building and is safe 
and appropriate maintenance and management of the equipments for 
reclaimed water. The content of the guideline is follows: 
  1) Area: 23 special wards and the Tama district except 
Okutamamachi town and Hinoharamura village. 
  2) Buildings: 
  (1) Building that has the total floor space more than 30,000 
m[.sup]2[/] and has planned miscellaneous water supply more 
than 100 m[.sup]3[/]/day (individual building- or limited 
area system). 
  (2) Building that has the total floor space more than 5,000 
m[.sup]2[/] or apartment complex that has more than 230 
households in service area of industrial waterworks. 
  (3) Building that is equal to (1) in an area where the 
advanced treated water from sewage works can be supplied (broad 
area system). 
  3) Use of miscellaneous water is limited for flushing toilet 
as a rule. 
  4) Quality of miscellaneous water is required to suit the 
following: 



  ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 
|Coliform group                        |Must not exceed 10 in 1 ml            | 
------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 
|pH                                    |5.8-8.6                               | 
------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 
|Odor and appearance                   |To be not discomfortable              | 
------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 
|Residual chlorine shall be in existence                                      | 
------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 


  The scale of the building is decided on the basis that the 
consumers cost of reclaimed water are proportionate to sum of 
potable water and sewerage charge. Therefore, it has been 
accepted to owners of building almost without problems, although 
the guideline is not forcible. 
  As a result of the promotion based on the guideline of the 
TMG, the number of consumers of water recycling have been 
increasing steadily, and reached 196 buildings and 26,672 
m[.sup]3[/]/day in individual and limited area system 
together, 19 and 6,082 m[.sup]3[/]/day in broad area system 
in Shinjuku subcenter district, and 328 and 20,818 
m[.sup]3[/]/day in industrial waterworks supply, respectively 
(Tables 3, 4). Examples of individual building system are 
``Ikebukuro Sunshine City'' and ``Tokyo Dome'' etc.

  Major treatment methods adopted in individual building- and 
limited area systems are biochemical treatment methods including 
activated sludge, contact oxidation, and so on, and physically 
treated methods including ultrafiltration methods (Figure 2 [not 
reproduced]). The former has reached 72 facilities and the 
latter has reached 70 facilities. In recent days, adoption of 
ultrafiltration method has increased. 
  Most of facilities have treated effluent from hand washing, 
restaurant drainage, and cooling drainage. In 44 buildings rain 
water has compensated for miscellaneous water. The treated water 
is used generally for flushing toilets. However, some part of it 
is also used for sprinkling and air-conditioning. 
<H5>  Supply of Industrial Water for Non-Manufacturing Customers </H5>
  The Industrial Waterworks of the TMG is responsible for the 
supply of the water for industrial use to the Koto and Johoku 
area in eastern Tokyo. This task has been done to prevent the 
pumping up of ground water, which caused serious land subsidence 
in that area in practice. 
  The TMG began to supply treated sewage water as industrial 
water in the Koto area in 1964. As a result, land subsidence has 
been effectively stopped, and its mission has been accomplished 
(Figure 3 [not reproduced]). 
  The demand for industrial water, however, has gradually 
decreased due to the relocation of factories outside the TMG's 
supply area, and due to water recycling efforts. 
  The TMG began to supply industrial water to 
non-manufacturing 
customers, i.e., incineration plants, truck terminals and 
schools, in order to conserve potable water from 1973 and have 
supplied apartment complexes for flushing toilets from 1976. The 
system of the Koto area uses treated sewage water as its water 
resource and contributes towards the creation of a water 
conservation conscious city greatly. Table 4 shows the supply 
industrial water to non-manufacturing customers. 
<H5>  Outline of Broad Area System Using of Treated Sewage Water </H5>
  In 1984, the Shinjuku Water Recycle Center started to 
perform 
a broad area recycling of treated municipal wastewater in the 
Shinjuku Subcenter District for high-rise buildings which were 
constructed as the redevelopment project of the District. Rapid 
sand filtrate from the Ochiai Treatment Plant is carried to the 
Water Recycle Center and is then chlorinated and distributed to 
19 high-rise buildings to be used only for flush toilets 
(Figures 4, 5 [not reproduced]). 
  The distribution area will be spread out 80 hectares in the 
part of Shinjuku Subcenter District and the maximum quantity of 
miscellaneous water supply of the plant will reach 8,000 
m[.sup]3[/]/day. 
  Further, in the coastal subcenter, to be developed on the 
landfill site in Tokyo Bay, the Ariake sewage works will 
distribute the advanced treated water to the neighbouring 
building complexes. In addition the broad area recycling system 
of the advanced treated wastewater is planned in a large scale 
redevelopment project area. 
<H5>  Water Recycling System in the New City Hall </H5>
  The New City Hall, TMG's office, completed in April 1991, is 
included in the served area of Shinjuku Water Recycle Center. 
The New City Hall is using reclaimed water from the Center for 
flushing of toilets, which requires water over 300 
m[.sup]3[/]/day, the rate of reclaimed water to total 
supplied water is 37 percent. Besides, rainwater fallen in the 
New City Hall site is collected and filtrated by micro-strainer 
and then used for sprinkling, ponds and flush toilets. The 
rainwater used miscellaneously is about 60 m[.sup]3[/]/day. 
The volume of storage tank of rain water is 1,320 m[.sup]3[/] 
and 700 m[.sup]3[/] of the stored water is secured always for 
fire prevention and besides a part of that is treated by 
ultrafiltration to supply for drink in emergency (Figure 6 [not 
reproduced]). 
<H5>  Theme in Future </H5>
  Because the use of reclaimed water is a new type of water 
use, related laws and ordinances are not sufficient yet. To 
promote the use of miscellaneous water much more, it is 
necessary to develop the unified measures concerning legislation 
and systems. In addition, there are several problems also about 
individual building- and limited area recycling system. For 
example, make up by potable water during the lack of wastewater 
as raw water, unstable quality of treated water, and the higher 
cost of recycled water than that of potable water. In order to 
solve these problems, it is necessary to promote the 
co-operation of investigations with the national government for 
reduction of users cost, development of new water treatment 
technology, and stabilization of quality of treated water. 
  To use water effectively, it will further be required to 
promote the recycling of reclaimed water, and the use of 
industrial water and rain water.

Sanki Engineering Co. Ltd., Japan] 
  [Text] Plans to regenerate building wastewater for reuse 
are being actively promoted for implementation, with an 
increasing number of wastewater regeneration installations 
(water reclamation systems) coming into operation every year. 
This is not only because the need is created by the already 
existing limitation to further development of water resources in 
urban areas as well as by the growing water demand in cities due 
to shortages of water, but also because the public sewer system 
is beginning to have relative shortages in capacity due to the 
ever-increasing volume of wastewater, as a result of the 
gravitation of the population toward cities. 
  Under such circumstances Sanki Engineering succeeded in 
developing its wastewater reclamation system utilizing the 
ultrafiltration membrane separation (UF membrane) technology. 
This treatment technology combines the activated sludge process 
with membrane separation. Since 1980 when its first full-scale 
installation came into being as a commercial size MSR (Membrane 
Sewage Reclamation) System Sanki Engineering has successfully 
installed a great number of plants utilizing this technology. At 
the same time the company has undertaken maintenance and 
operation management for these plants and through this 
experience has developed and acquired a broad knowledge of 
problems associated with operation management. 
  Building on this extensive operating experience Sanki 
Engineering discusses here the outline of the building 
wastewater regeneration and reuse technology incorporating the 
UF membrane separation technology. 
<H5>  1. Basic Requirements for a Building Wastewater Regeneration </H5>
System 
  As the basic requirements, the system must: 
  (1) be installed in small space; 
  (2) be easy to operate and maintain; 
  (3) produce treated water of high and stable quality; 
  (4) not cause secondary nuisance such as an odor problem, 
etc. 
<H5>  2. Selection of Flowsheets Recommended for Systems </H5>
Incorporating UF Membrane Separation Technology 
  Several alternative process flows can be considered as 
systems incorporating the UF membrane separation technology. 
  Introduced here is a representative process flow combining 
UF 
membrane separation with biological treatment (activated sludge 
process). Although some types of system flows do not incorporate 
biological treatment, it should be safe to adopt a system flow 
combined with biological treatment for building wastewater 
regeneration, since it is almost impossible to exclude living 
wastewater when reuse is considered within standard office 
buildings. 
  This paper discusses later ``The Kinds of Wastewater To Be 
Regenerated and Their Uses.'' 
<H5>  3. Kinds of Wastewater To Be Regenerated and Their Uses </H5>
  Building wastewater is classified into low BOD loading 
wastewater such as from washstands, washbasins, etc. and high 
BOD loading wastewater such as kitchen wastewater and sewage 
(toilet flush water), but any kind of building wastewater can in 
principle be regenerated for reuse, regardless of its source. 
  Special caution, however, is needed when the latter is used 
by itself or in case its mixing ratio is higher even when used 
together with low BOD loading wastewater. 
  The point is that it is necessary to remove oily substance 
contained in kitchen wastewater or to take necessary measures 
with the treated water (regenerated water for reuse) for its 
color in case of sewage. 
  3-1. Low BOD Loading Wastewater 
  (1) Wastewater From Washstands, Washbasins and Hot Water 
Makers 
  Wastewater from these sources amounts to about 10 percent of 
the total wastewater volume discharged from a standard office 
building, and, because lower in contaminants loading, should be 
given priority for reuse from a water quality standpoint. 
  In many cases, however, the volume of wastewater from these 
sources alone may not be sufficient to cover the required 
quantity of regenerated water. 
  (2) Blow Water From Cooling Towers 
  Wastewater from this source is virtually free from 
contaminants loading and of good quality, and, therefore, should 
be recovered for reuse, separately from living wastewater. 
  This kind of wastewater can be adequately treated for reuse 
by a simple method such as a usual type of filtration plus 
sterilization. 
  This kind of wastewater can be effectively treated together 
with rainwater, and does not require an application of the UF 
membrane separation system for its treatment. 
  3-2. High BOD Loading Wastewater 
  (1) Kitchen Wastewater 
  This is wastewater discharged from corporate dining rooms 
and 
other eating and drinking establishments. This kind of 
wastewater is very high in organic type contaminants loading and 
contains mainly BOD, oily substance, surface activating agents, 
etc. Because it is comparatively stable in volume and can serve 
as a nutrient source for microorganisms in the aeration tank, 
this kind of wastewater can be effectively treated together with 
low BOD loading wastewater. 
  It is, however, necessary to remove oily substance to a 
required level in case this kind of wastewater is used by itself 
or in case its mixing ratio with low BOD loading wastewater 
exceeds 30 percent when using the two kinds of wastewater 
together. This is because unless the level of oily substance 
removal is adequate, sludge generated in the biological 
treatment process will be of such nature that it tends to clog 
up the UF membrane. 
  (2) Sewage (Toilet Flush Water) 
  Because this kind of wastewater is very high in organic type 
contaminants loading and contains ammoniacal nitrogen, bilious 
coloring matter, etc., and further because oxidization of 
ammonia forms nitric acid resulting in lower pH, it is necessary 
to neutralize the regenerated water from this kind of wastewater 
for reuse and also to provide the aeration tank with acid-proof 
treatment. 
  It is also necessary to further treat this regenerated water 
by taking decoloring measures (by activated carbon, ozone 
treatment, etc.), as it takes on light yellow color because the 
substance formed from bilious coloring matter in it remains 
undissolved. 
  For those reasons there are few cases where this kind of 
wastewater is positively reclaimed for reuse even when the 
treatment system incorporates a UF membrane separation unit. 
However, the MSR system can be considered as an effective means 
in case this kind of wastewater needs to be regenerated for 
reuse, since decoloring effects on it can be expected by 
lowering the pH level of the aeration tank. 
<H5>  4. System Constitution </H5>
  Elements which constitute the system generally consist of 
the 
following, although they may vary somewhat with the kind of 
wastewater to be treated: 

  -  Screens (Screens with Coarse Openings, Screens with Fine 
Openings) 
  -  Pumps, Blowers, etc. 
  -  Ultrafiltration Unit 
  -  Aeration Tank 
  -  Other Tanks 

    In addition to the above, an oil removal device (pressurized 
flotation tank, etc.) and/or an activated carbon adsorption 
tower may be required in case measures are necessary to remove 
oily substance or color, depending on the kind of wastewater 
intended for reuse. 
<H5>  5. Features of the UF Membrane System </H5>
  (1) Availability of Regenerated Water of Stable and High 
Quality at All Times 
  Because organic matter is completely decomposed in the 
aeration tank and all of suspended solids are eliminated by the 
UF membrane separation unit, this system can produce treated 
water of extremely high quality. 
  This means that no special consideration is required of the 
materials of construction used for those piping and equipment 
handling this superior quality treated water and serves as a 
good proof that combination of the activated sludge process with 
the UF membrane separation technology makes a superior treatment 
system. 
  (2) Generation of Little Excess Sludge 
  Little excess sludge is generated, since activated sludge 
that can not pass through the UF membrane separation unit is 
concentrated and returned to the aeration tank. 
  This means that the propagation of microorganisms and their 
self-oxidization is well balanced by the increased concentration 
of activated sludge in the aeration tank. 
  (3) Compact, Reduced Size 
  Wastewater regeneration systems employing such processes as 
activated sludge process, contact oxidization process, rotating 
disc process, etc. require sedimentation tanks and may have to 
be equipped with two stages of biological treatment or followed 
by a sand filter, activated carbon adsorption tower, etc. in 
case high quality treated water is needed. 
  This system, however, requires no sedimentation tank nor 
does 
it almost require two stages of biological treatment of 
post-treatment equipment. 
  (4) Ease of Operation and Maintenance 
  Since this system requires no sedimentation tank, it is not 
necessary to control the volume of excess sludge to be returned. 
Consequently, the system is very easy to operate and maintain. 
  Furthermore, this system, not being subjected to effects 
from 
the settling characteristics of the sludge, is easy to manage in 
respect of operation, unlike other conventional types of systems 
equipped with sedimentation tanks which may have to heavily 
depend on filtration and other post-treatment equipment in case 
of handling a type of sludge difficult to settle. 
  (5) High Wastewater Recovery Rate 
  Ninety-nine percent or more of the original wastewater can 
be 
recovered as treated water, because little excess sludge is 
generated. 
  (6) No Odor Dispersion 
  Since all the process equipment is tightly enclosed, no odor 
dispersion occurs. 
<H5>  6. Uses for Regenerated Water </H5>
  Regenerated water is used as toilet flush water in almost 
all 
cases for the present time except that part of it is used as 
sprinkling water for gardens. Since the quality of regenerated 
water from the water reclamation system incorporating the 
activated sludge method combined with UF membrane separation is 
very high, it is expected that many other uses will be developed 
for this high quality treated water in the future. Uses will be 
found, for instance, as make-up water for cooling towers, 
landscaping water, car washing water, fire-extinguishing water, 
etc.

  [Text] 
<H5>  1. Preface </H5>
  The economic growth, which started in late 1950s, invited 
the 
concentration of population into urban areas, and the volume of 
city water consumption shows an uneven distribution by area. 
  For this reason, water is stored once in a dam or the like, 
then is used as the water source for city water as necessity 
arises; therefore, the water is not fresh enough, besides 
presents various problems, including the odor caused by algae, 
and the increased possibility of generation of trihalomethane 
(THM) due to the deposits of organic substances. Moreover, as 
compared with the ratio of population served with city water, 
that of sewage does not even reach a half. And, sewage often 
contains substances, that are unable to treat with ordinary 
sewage treatment method, which in turn invited the increase of 
materials that cannot be treated by the ordinary water 
purification method. For this reason, there arose the increased 
need of advanced water purification treatment; and, the 
construction of advanced water purification facilities is 
rapidly pushed ahead mostly in the Kanto and the Kansai areas. 
  Under such circumstances, studies are being made about the 
ozone treatment for advanced water purification treatment. 
  In this report will be explained the recycling of treated 
sewage. 
<H5>  2. Effects of Improving Water Quality by Ozone </H5>
  The most typical water quality improving effects by ozone 
may 
include (1) decolorization, (2) deodorizing, (3) disinfection, 
(4) prevention of adhesion of organic slime, and (5) decrease of 
COD. 
  Figure 1 [not reproduced] shows the examples of 
decolorization and deodorizing by ozone of sewage after 
secondary treatment. In these examples, both hue and odor were 
reduced with as little as 5-10 mg/l. For recycling the treated 
sewage to landscaping water, the decrease of hue and odor 
becomes necessary; and, the effects of ozone treatment are 
recognized in this field too, and the method has already been 
applied to over a dozen places. 
  If colitis germs are dispersed in water, and the ozone 
treatment test is realized, only as small as 0.25 mg/l of ozone 
would be required for almost completely killing germs whose 
initial bacterial count is 10[.sup]6[/] per milliliter. 
Figure 2 [not reproduced] shows the results of the ozone 
treatment test realized with the waste water after secondary 
treatment; the amount of ozone required for reducing the colitis 
germs increases to about 10 mg/l. This is because ozone reacted 
with contaminating materials; and, when disinfection is realized 
by ozone treatment, if the amount of contaminating materials is 
large, the amount of ozone required also increases. 
  The latent heat energy of the sewage after secondary 
treatment is increasingly used for heating and cooling of 
building, and heating and cooling of a wader area. But, organic 
materials remaining in the sewage after secondary treatment or 
components of scale may cause organic slime or scale in the heat 
exchanger or the piping, thus preventing the collection of the 
necessary heating value. For this reason, preventing organic 
slimes or scales would be indispensable for the recycling of 
heat energy. For preventing the deposition of organic slime, 
about 5 mg/l of ozone may be injected intermittently (normally 
once or twice a day) for about 5 minutes once a day, thus the 
running cost may prove to be economical. If oxygen is used as 
the raw material gas, it is also possible to use an ozone 
generator, which generates and stores ozone, may be used, when 
no ozone injection is realized; in the case, the running cost 
and the initial cost would prove to be further lower. [sentence

<H5>  3. History of the Development of Ozone Generator </H5>
  Production of industrial ozone generators was started in 
Japan around 1965; but, ozone generators introduced then 
resulted in fairly high running cost and initial cost. Since 
then a series of improvements was made to the ozone generator in 
order to respond to the requirements about ozone at water 
plants, sewerage facility, human wastes treatment plants, and 
manufacturing plants, thus reaching to the ozone generator we 
know these days. 
  Figure 3 [not reproduced] shows the change in the power 
consumption and that in the density of ozone generated. As 
compared with when 32.5 kWh power was needed, including 
auxiliary equipment, for producing 1 kg of ozone in 1972, at 
present the required power dropped to the 18 to 20 kW range, 
that means nearly 40 percent saving in energy. And, significant 
technological innovation was also achieved, as a result of which 
the density of ozone also nearly doubled from 10 
g/Nm[.sup]3[/] to 20 g/Nm[.sup]3[/]. During the same 
period of time, of ozone generating capacity of each unit when 
air us used as raw material was 38 kg 03/hr, the ozone generator 
by using oxygen as raw material produced 60 kg 03/hr; and, the 
number of units produced already exceeded 1,000. 
  Ozone generators currently available feature high 
efficiency, 
reduced space required, low price, high controllability, and 
high reliability. These advantages may be attributed, mainly to 
(1) Thanks to the high-frequency and high-density discharge by 
using the constant-current type inverter as the power source, 
the charge power per unit area of discharge tube could be 
largely increased; thus, the space required for the equipment 
could be reduced, and at the same time the density of ozone at 
the time of generation was raised, thus successfully reducing 
the amount of the raw material gas; (2) As the dimensional 
precision of glass electrode was remarkably improved, thus, 
making it possible to obtain smaller and ave [as published] 
discharge gap length, which in turn brought about optimum 
cooling effect in the discharge space and stable discharge, thus 
the ozone generation efficiency was improved; (3) Through the 
use of the constant-current type inverter, the control range of 
ozone generation volume expanded to 5 to 100 percent, besides 
the response property of generation volume regulation was 
improved; thus, promising superior response to load fluctuations 
in the volume of water or the quality of water; and, (4) Thanks 
to the development of an integral exclusive ozone generator and 
the energy-saving type air cooler/dryer unit, energy saving and 
space saving were made possible. 
<H5>  4. Ozone Reactors </H5>
  In order to cause ozone to effectively react to the object 
material, the following should be taken into account regarding 
the ozone reactor: 
  (1) Generally speaking, the smaller the LV is, the better 
the 
ozone absorption efficiency (ozone use efficiency), and the 
smaller becomes the amount of discharge ozone. However, for 
reducing the LV, the reactor has to be increased in size; thus, 
the LV for sewage should be kept at 25 m/hr or so. 
  (2) At the same amount of ozone generation, the higher the 
supply ozone density, the smaller becomes the volume of ozonized 
air; therefore, the value of LV may become smaller, thus the 
ozone absorption efficiency may be improved; but, the difference 
at 20 g/Nm[.sup]3[/] is small. 
  (3) The greater the water depth, the higher the solubility 
of 
ozone into water, thus the ozone absorption rate is improved. 
But, the ozonization air pressure at the ozone generator output 
is 0.7 kg/cm2-G; for this reason, the water depth in many cases 
is 4 to 5 m. 
  (4) The smaller the air bubble diameter, the higher the 
solubility of ozone into water, thus the ozone absorption 
efficiency is improved. However, in order to reduce the air 
bubble diameter, the diffuser pipe's air hole diameter should be 
made smaller, which in turn brings about a greater pressure 
loss; thus, the air bubble diameter is normally kept at 3mm or 
so. 
<H5>  5. Treatment of Residual Ozone </H5>
  For carrying out the ozone treatment, it is necessary to 
treat the residual ozone remaining in the ozone treatment water, 
and the discharged ozone (non-reacted ozone) that was not used, 
and remains in the gas as redundant ozone. 
  (1) If there exists residual ozone of high density and high 
water volume, ozone comes out of water into the atmospheric air, 
causing strong odor. In such event, discharge ozone treatment 
should be realized by ventilating air with fan, etc. As the 
degradation time of residual ozone in water is short, thus it is 
necessary to let the residual ozone self-degrade by setting 
aside a sufficient retention time by using the retention time as 
needed, by taking into account the effects on to the following 
steps. 
  (2) The discharge ozone (non-reacted ozone), that was not 
used in reaction and remains in the gas as redundant ozone 
should be treated. If no treatment is realized, there remains a 
strong odor of high-density ozone. Moreover, the discharge ozone 
in the air corrodes equipment, mainly the electric appliances, 
found nearby; and, if the discharge ozone is of high density, it 
may cause negative effects to human body. 
  Activated carbon is normally used for treatment of the 
discharged ozone. Activated carbon is filled in the discharge 
ozone degradation column, and is replaced once every 3 to 4 
months. The ozone degradation capacity of 1 g activated carbon 
is about 2 g of ozone for sewage. Ozone is discharged into air 
at the safe concentration level of 0.1 ppm or less from the 
outlet of the discharged ozone, manganese-based catalyst and 
activated carbon may be used together if the scale of the 
treatment facility is large. 
<H5>  6. Comparison of Ozone Treatment and Other Treatment Methods </H5>
  The ozone treatment brings about the water quality 
improvement effects and the disinfecting effects. When comparing 
the ozone treatment with other treatment methods, it will be 
necessary to select the object treatment method depending on the 
purpose: 
  (1) For purpose of the water quality improvement, to compare 
with the treatment with activated carbon. 
  (2) For disinfecting purpose, to compare with the NaClO 
(sodium hypochlorite) treatment or the ultraviolet ray treatment. 
  6.1 Comparison With Activated Carbon Treatment 
Method 
  In addition to the decrease of the hue, odor, COD, and 
surface active agent, both ozone treatment and activated carbon 
treatment bring about the following effects: 
  (1) Disinfection and increase of dissolved oxygen by the 
ozone treatment. 
  (2) Decrease of BOD by the activated carbon treatment. 
  For the water quality items, both methods have their own 
advantages and disadvantages; but, in many cases, both methods 
would bring about certain positive effects to such problem 
points as hue and odor. Moreover, the ozone treatment promises 
disinfecting effects, besides reducing space of installation, 
and lowering the cost of construction and maintenance. And, as 
the quality of the treated water does not change over the 
passage of time, the ozone treatment would be suitable, 
generally speaking, for the sewage water after secondary 
treatment. 
  6.2 Comparison With NaClO Treatment 
  The NaClO treatment, thanks to its sustainable disinfecting 
effects, is used in many fields whether for city water or for 
sewage. But, the ozone treatment may promise a wide range of 
compound effects, in addition to disinfection. As compared with 
the chlorine-based disinfectants, ozone treatment offer stronger 
disinfecting power against bacteria, and stronger inactivating 
power against viruses. THM is generated, if NaClO treatment 
method is used, but it can be reduced through the ozone 
treatment; thus, the ozone treatment method is known to be 
superior. In the future studies will be made for the combined 
use of the two methods, or using the ozone treatment mainly for 
killing germs by making the best of its characteristics; and, 
using chlorine-based disinfectant, which is less likely to form 
THM, if prolonged disinfecting effects are expected. 
  6.3 Comparison With Ultraviolet Ray Method 
  The ultraviolet ray treatment method, thanks to the easiness 
of installation, is often used for disinfecting clean water or 
air, which is not polluted much. However, for the ultraviolet 
ray treatment, the treatment effects may be halved if the lamp 
is stained; and, as the irradiation depth is shallow, a large 
number of lamps has to be set up. Furthermore, the lamp life is 
as short as half year to one year, besides durability is 
unpredictable; and, the lamp replacement cost is also high. 
  As compared with this, the ozone treatment promises stable 
effects, besides being able to handle from small to large 
quantity. As the running cost is also lower, the ozone treatment 
method would be more acceptable as compared with the ultraviolet 
treatment method. 
<H5>  7. Examples of Advanced Sewage Treatment Facility </H5>
  Figure 4 [not reproduced] shows an example of the actual 
treatment flow diagram of the advanced sewage treatment (when 
used to the intermediate water). The advanced sewage treatment 
is often applied to the landscaping water, water used for 
hydrophilic (waterfront facility) purposes, intermediate water 
system, etc. But, from the viewpoint of preservation of water 
quality, the ozone treatment would be increasingly used for 
improving the quality of discharged water. 
  The advanced sewage treatment facilities by using ozone 
currently operating in Japan are classified as follows by the 
purpose of application (main purposes): 



  ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 
|Landscaping water, hydrophilic (water-|9 facilities                          |

------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 
|Prevention of organic slime           |2 facilities                          | 
------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 


<H5>  8. Conclusion </H5>
  The ozone treatment facility already has history of nearly 
100 years in other nations; it has a history scarcely 20 years 
in Japan. However, in Japan where urban areas are highly 
populated, this requiring a large amount of water, the recycling 
of treated sewage would be indispensable. And, the expectation 
on the sewage treatment by using ozone will continue increasing. 
Thus, we are more than ready to push ahead with our R&amp;D 
efforts 
regarding the ozone generator and the ozone treatment facility.

<H5>  Preface </H5>
  In urban districts, the existing municipal water supply and 
effluent facilities are almost saturated as the result of the 
concentrated population and raised level of living. In order to 
solve such a problem, miscellaneous water utilization systems to 
treat waste water for reuse have been introduced in newly 
constructed large-size buildings in large cities such as Tokyo. 
Among such various systems, an actual example of reusing 
building waste water with tubular UF membrane is shown and 
result of study on applications of a dynamic membrane filtration 
method using hollow fiber MF membrane is discussed below. 
<H5>  Building Waste Water Reuse System Using Membrane </H5>
<H5>  Features </H5>
  The waste water recycle/reuse system using membrane is 
relatively free from influences coming from load fluctuation and 
as such can produce treated water of a stable quality because it 
is a physical treatment process using membrane as the main 
treatment medium. This system can be automatically operated, if 
one so desires, and therefore controlled easily. In addition, 
the equipment can be made compact in size. 
  Under the present conditions, the waste water reuse methods 
using membrane are broadly classified into the RO method and UF 
method. When these two methods are compared, the UF method is 
more advantageous with respect to the quality of the treated 
water, while the UF method is better with respect to the 
economics such as investment cost and operating expense. Use of 
the recycled building waste water is in almost all cases limited 
to flushing of toilet stools. Such a high level of water quality 
as that of drinking water is not required. thus, the UF method 
is though to be more appropriate. 
<H5>  Example of Implementation </H5>
  An example of implementation of the building waste water 
recycle/reuse system using UF membrane in a K building is shown 
below. The waste water is from the kitchens and miscellaneous 
waste water, mixed with part of sewerage. Figure 1 [not 
reproduced] shows a flow of the system. 
  In this system, waste water is contact-aerated, then 
cross-flow filtrated with tubular type PAN membrane of 13,000 in 
molecular weight cut-off, and finally disinfected with chlorine 
to recycle water. Recovery ratio of the recycled water is about 
70 percent. The membrane separation unit is periodically cleaned 
with a sponge ball and chemicals to maintain the flux. 
  The role of the UF membrane here is to remove the turbidity 
substance and unresolved high molecular components in the raw 
water. An example of treatment with this system is shown in 
Table 1.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 


  Recently, the presence of pathogenic bacteria has attracted 
public attention from the point of view of safety. With the 
membrane method, no fungi leak to the treated water. This is a 
very safe process in this respect. 
<H5>  Study on Application of Dynamic Membrane Filtration Method </H5>
  In order to reduce the water recycling cost, feasibility to 
recycle and reuse waste water from buildings by the dynamic 
filtration method using the MF membrane which is cheaper than 
the UF membrane was studied particularly from the standpoint of 
quality of the treated water. 
<H5>  Tests </H5>
  The above-described waste water from the K Building after 
contact aeration was filtrated with MF membrane and compared 
with water treated with the existing UF membrane facility. MF 
membrane of polyethylene hollow fiber of 0.2 Êm in pore 
diameter was used. The same cross-flow filtration method as with 
the UF membrane was adopted. Back wash method with permeated 
water was applied for the MF membrane because of the different 
membrane forms. Filtration conditions were so set that the 
energies used for cross-flow are equivalent. Respective 
filtration conditions are shown in Table 2.

<H5>  Results </H5>
  Examples of the qualities of water filtrated with the MF and 
UF membranes are shown in Table 3. The quality of treated water 
was on the same level for both membranes.

  The measurement of molecular weight distribution of water 
treated with membranes by the gel chromatography are shown in 
Figure 2 [not reproduced]. No component of molecular weight 
higher than several thousands was observed in water treated 
either with the MF or UF membrane. It seems that the 
characteristics of molecular weight cut-off depend on the 
dynamic membrane formed on the membrane surface more than on the 
membrane itself. 
  Then, the COD[.sub]Mn[/] of water treated with the 
membrane was measured before back wash, and 1, 3, 10, and 20 
minutes after it to examine changes in the quality of water 
against time. The results are shown in Table 4. Changes in the 
flux during this process are shown in Figure 3 [not reproduced]. 
The flux was changed from 0.8 to 1.0 
m[.sup]3[/]/m[.sup]2[/]-day from before the back wash. 
Dynamic membrane form is supposed to have changed but difference 
was not observed in the membrane-treated water. This suggests 
dynamic membrane of self-rejection type was formed.

<H5>  Conclusion </H5>
  Though there have been many examples of building waste water 
reuse systems making use of membrane in Japan, all of them have 
used the UF membrane before. The following reasons have been 
cited so far: 
  a. MF membrane is inferior with respect to the quality of 
treated water. 
  b. MF membrane causes clogging of SS in the pore. 
  Studies have been carried out on application of a building 
waste water reuse system using MF membrane. At least regarding 
the water quality, the same treatment result was obtained with 
the MF membrane as with the UF membrane. 
  As a subject to be taken up in the future in order to put 
the 
MF membrane into practical use for the waste water reuse 
systems, maintenance of high flux for a long time and economic 
efficiency should be furthermore studied. 
<H5>  Postface </H5>
  Among waste water reuse facilities, those of individual 
circulation type account for more than 80 percent. Their use was 
limited to washing toilet stools before. However, to recycle and 
reuse water more efficiently, an area circulation system is 
desirable to recycle and supply water covering an entire city or 
as a center for each district. With the increase of demand for 
water, wider district circulation systems will be employed. For 
the reclaimed water applications, their use will be increased 
not only to flushing toilet stools but also to supply water for 
sprinkling, hydrophile and other uses. It is an important 
subject of waste water reuse to develop treatment techniques 
suitable to objects, paying attention to the safety and economic 
efficiency.

<H5>  Summary </H5>
  The effluent of Tufftride Process, a soft nitriding process 
for iron-related material, contains concentrated iron cyanide 
complex. Due to the nature of the effluent, a treatment process 
employing conventional technology may become a complex one. For 
this reason, a simple advanced system with new technology has 
been hoped for. 
  Since 1991, Water Reuse Promotion Center (WRPC), 
collaborating with Osaka Gas Co., Ltd. (OGC) and Nihon 
Parkerizing Co., Ltd. (NPC), has been working to develop a new 
process for treating concentrated cyanide wastewater using OGC 
catalytic wet oxidation (CWO) process. Through the operation at 
NPC Sendai plant, it has been confirmed that the process is 
technically feasible and economically acceptable. 
<H5>  Introduction </H5>
  The effluent discharged from Tufftride Process, a soft 
nitriding process used in manufacturing industry such as 
automobiles and electric appliances, contains highly 
concentrated iron-cyanide complex at the total concentration 
level of CN 10,000-20,000 mg/l. State-of-the-art technologies 
adopted in treating the wastewater are Prussian Blue Process and 
Heat Hydrolysis Process. Prussian Blue Process is a method to 
sedimentate cyanide complex as an insoluble iron complex, 
followed by incineration of the sludge. Another conventional 
treatment system for concentrated cyanide wastewater is Heat 
Hydrolysis Process[.sup]1[/] shown in Figure 1 [not 
reproduced]. 
  If the treated water is to be directly discharged to river 
or 
sea, denitrification process is necessary. 
  This kind of wastewater is unable to be treated by a single 
step process. Therefore, from the view point of wastewater 
treatment and environment protection, development and 
exploitation of a new wastewater treatment technology has been 
awaited. 
  WRPC has carried out an experimental study on applying CWO 
process, developed by OGC to wastewaters containing concentrated 
and biologically-undecomposable composition. WRPC has conducted 
an experimental operation of a pilot plant of OG-CWO process in 
order to simplify and to improve economics of the wastewater 
treatment process of Tufftride effluent water. 
  This paper summarizes the result of operation since 1991 at 
Sendai pilot plant of NPC Sendai Works. 
<H5>  OG-CWO Process </H5>
  OGC has developed a wastewater treatment process using a 
catalyst aiming at treatment of industrial wastewater which 
contains high content of COD and/or ammonia. 
  Figure 2 [not reproduced] shows the process flow diagram of 
OG-CWO process.[.sup]2-4[/] 
  Raw wastewater is pumped up, mixed with air, heat-exchanged 
with high temperature reactor effluent and introduced into the 
catalytic reactor. In the catalytic reactor, COD and ammonia in 
the wastewater is oxidized and converted into carbon dioxide, 
water and nitrogen. In this manner, OG-CWO process 
simultaneously decomposes COD and ammonia in single step 
treatment, which is a remarkable feature of the process. 
  OG-CWO process is a unique wastewater treatment process 
which 
can completely decompose contaminants through single step 
reaction to obtain colorless and odorless clean water. Besides, 
the reaction heat is recovered to be utilized for on-site 
application. 
<H5>  Operation of Sendai Pilot Plant </H5>
  As shown in Table 1, the raw wastewater has high content of 
COD whose main components are potassium ferrocyanide 
(K[.sub]4[/][Fe(CN)[.sub]6[/]]) or potassium ferricyanide 
(K[.sub]3[/][Fe(CN)[.sub]6[/]]). Figure 3 [not reproduced] 
shows a photograph of the pilot plant in NPC Sendai Works. The 
plant with the capacity of 2 tons/d can treat the total effluent 
from Tufftride Process of the works.

  Process flow diagram of the plant is shown in Figure 4 [not

  Alkaline raw wastewater is heated up to 150 deg C in 
preheater and further heated to about 220 deg C by steam 
addition into the pretreater reactor. 
  At 220 deg C, iron cyanide complex is decomposed by 
hydrolysis and converted to tri-iron tetraoxide 
(Fe[.sub]3[/]O[.sub]4[/]), formic acid and ammonia as 
follows: 
  6K[.sub]4[/][Fe(CN)[.sub]6[/]] + 12NaOH + 
66H[.sub]2[/]O + O[.sub]2[/] 
  -&gt;  36NH[.sub]3[/] + 2Fe[.sub]3[/]O[.sub]4[/] + 
12HCOONa + 24HCOOK 
  Tri-iron tetraoxide (Fe[.sub]3[/]O[.sub]4[/]) sludge is 
gravitationally separated from the bulk water and discharged 
intermittently out of the bottom of the pretreater reactor. The 
pretreater effluent is introduced into the catalytic treatment 
process via the service tank. 
  The pretreated water is fed into the catalytic reactor with 
air at the temperature of 230 deg C. In the catalytic reactor, 
formic acid and ammonia in the pretreated water is completely 
decomposed by wet oxidation and become water, carbon dioxide and 
nitrogen. 
  4NH[.sub]3[/] + 3O[.sub]2[/] -&gt;  2N[.sub]2[/] + 
6H[.sub]2[/]O 
  2HCOOH + O[.sub]2[/] -&gt;  2CO[.sub]2[/] + 
2H[.sub]2[/]O 
  After heat-recovering and cooling, the effluent of the 
catalytic reactor is fed into liquid/gas separator to vent inert 
gas (CO[.sub]2[/], N[.sub]2[/] and excess air) and treated 
water is obtained. 
<H5>  Result and Discussions </H5>
  The quality of the raw wastewater, pretreated water and 
treated water is shown in Table 1. 
  The treated water from the catalytic reactor has a quality 
sufficient to be discharged to sewerage. From the beginning of 
the operation of the plant, the treated water has been 
discharged to the city sewerage. 
  The characteristics of the sludge from the pretreater 
reactor 
is shown in Table 2. Existence of half-decomposed cyanide 
complex in the Case A, non-air addition system, requires further 
treatment of the accompanied iron sludge of the pretreater 
effluent before introducing it to catalytic treatment. On the 
other hand, as the decomposition reaction in the pretreater 
reactor by air addition, Case B, is done completely, pretreater 
effluent does not contain those undecomposed cyanide complex. 
Air-addition system is incorporated in the ultimate pretreatment 
process.

  As described above, catalytic treatment process for the 
cyanide wastewater, comparing with the conventional system, has 
several features as follows: 

  -  simple system 
  -  closed processing 
  -  complete decomposition 
of cyanide complex 
  -  no harmful emission such as NOx, organic 
sludge, etc. 

    The plant is operated automatically, with simple start-up 
and 
shut down operation. 
<H5>  Desalination and Reuse of Treated Water </H5>[.sup]5[/] 
  As already described, thorough treatment of the concentrated 
cyanide wastewater from Tufftride Process has been successfully 
realized at the Sendai plant by applying OG-CWO Process. 
However, as the treated water from CWO process contains high 
content of potassium sulfate and sodium sulfate, it is desirable 
to remove those concentrated salts before discharging. 
  Ohya et al. have investigated a recovery method of sodium 
and 
potassium from the potassium/sodium sulfate mixture liquid. 
Na[.sub]2[/]SO[.sub]4[/]/K[.sub]2[/]SO[.sub]4[/] 
mixture is electrically dissociate and value added products, 
NaOH/KOH mixture and sulfate acid, are recovered by using a 
bipolar membrane. 
  Na[.sub]2[/]SO[.sub]4[/] -&gt;  NaOH + 
H[.sub]2[/]SO[.sub]4[/] 
  K[.sub]2[/]SO[.sub]4[/] -&gt;  KOH + 
H[.sub]2[/]SO[.sub]4[/] 
  Through an electrodialysis process using a monopolar 
membrane, NaOH and KOH, are separately recovered from the 
mixture of NaOH/KOH solution. 
  As a result, both desalination of the catalytic reactor 
effluent and recovery of value added chemicals will be 
effectively realized by membrane technology. 
  The first report of the desalination technology will be 
presented in the near future. 
<H5>  Postscript </H5>
  The experimental project of the process has been conducted 
under the guidance of the Ministry of International Trade and 
Industry (MITI) with the sponsorship of Japan Bicycle Racing 
Association. The experimental operation is scheduled for 
completion at the end of 1993 and NPC will take over the 
operation for commercial running.

<H5>  Introduction </H5>
  In TEPCO, as the share of nuclear power generation 
increases, 
adjusting capability of thermal power plants to meet the 
variation in demand of electricity has become important. In 
particular, medium capacity units such as the Goi Thermal Power 
Station, which consists of six units, are needed to carry out 
frequent start-ups and shut-downs. In order to fulfill the 
requirement, the Goi No. 2 unit has been refreshed and modified 
for DSS (Daily Start-up and Shut-down) operation in 1988. Since 
it is necessary to clean up and improve quality of feed water to 
the boiler more quickly in DSS operation than in conventional 
operation, the existing auxiliary precoat filters (PCF) were 
replaced with hollow fiber filters (HFF), which have been used 
in TEPCO's nuclear power stations. This paper describes the 
results of our four year operation of HFF as its effectiveness 
has been confirmed. 
<H5>  1. Background to Development </H5>
  1.1 Water Processing Technology Using Filters 
  Filter processing technology has seen rapid progress in 
recent years, with focus mainly on the manufacture of 
semi-conductors and the medical sector. Although its main 
objective in these fields is efficiently achieving water quality 
of ultra-high purity, the scale of processing has been small 
until now and the filters have generally been of the disposable 
type. 
  Since condensate filters for use in thermal power plants are 
required to produce feed water which is stable over the long 
term as well as being of high purity, TEPCO has installed PCFs 
and electro-magnetic filters (EMFs) until now. Meanwhile, in 
nuclear power plants, the demand for high-purity water quality 
has led to the development of the HFF for condensate processing, 
and this is currently being operated satisfactorily. 
  1.2 The State of Scale Damage in Once-Through Boilers 
and the Need Arising From DSS Modification 
  In recent years, scale damage such as that described below 
has gradually become apparent in base-load once-through UP 
boilers, caused for example by an increase in stop-start 
operations. 
  (Examples of scale damage) 
  a. Blocked strainer at the boiler feed pump inlet 
  b. Reduced efficiency in the high-pressure feed water heater 
  c. Boiler pressure loss 
  d. Malfunction in superheater temperature control caused by 
scale accumulation on the spray valve 
  Therefore, for the last few years we have been working on 
research into the relative efficiency and merits of various 
types of filters used for condensate purification. Moreover, in 
modifying to DSS operation, it has become necessary to remove 
impurities efficiently and in a short space of time. Thus, as a 
step towards solving these issues, we have decided to proceed 
with studies based on the hollow fiber filter, which is being 
used successfully for condensate purification in TEPCO nuclear 
power stations, considering the water quality in thermal power 
stations and the characteristics of operating methods. 
<H5>  2. The Hollow Fiber Filter </H5>
  2.1 The Principles and Properties of the Hollow Fiber 
Filter 
  As shown in Figure 1 [not reproduced], the hollow fiber 
filter can filter substances down to the coloid-range size. The 
fibers are hollow and macaroni-shaped, as shown in Figure 2 [not 
reproduced], with microscopic slit-shaped filtration holes of 
0.1 Êm or less in the outer surface. 
  The filtration principle, as shown in Figure 3 [not 
reproduced], is that condensate is passed from the outside to 
the inside of the hollow fibers, and non-solvent solids 
(referred to below as ``clad'') are extracted onto the surface 
of the hollow fibers. 
  The properties are as shown below. 
  1) Compared to conventional precoat filters, there is no 
need 
for an auxiliary precoating of the filter, and operation can be 
simplified thanks to the simple composition of the equipment and 
remote automatic control. 
  2) With a large number of fine-pore hollow fibers bunched 
together in module fashion, a large filter area can be secured, 
thus large volumes of condensate can be filtered even though the 
device itself is compact in size. It is particularly effective 
in cases where installation space is limited, such as in 
existing plants in which operation is underway. 
  3) Since it can remove all clad sized 0.1 Êm or more, 
outlet water quality of 1 ppb of clad or less can be ensured at 
all times regardless of the quality of water at the inlet, and 
this has a major effect on reducing the clean-up time when 
starting the unit. In addition, during normal operation high 
purity boiler feed water can be ensured. 
  2.2 The Economic Feasibility of Hollow Fibers 
  The hollow fiber was first developed for nuclear power 
plant, 
and in applying it to thermal power plant, there have been some 
problems in economic feasibility caused by differences in safety 
design rationale. Thus there was some doubt initially as to 
whether it would be feasible in terms of cost. 
  However, given the requirement for rigorous water quality 
conditions, if the hollow fiber filter is adopted after the 
modification of No. 2 unit to DSS it is forecast that the costs 
would be recovered in 4-5 years, with the effects and merits 
calculated as shown in Table 1. Therefore we decided to proceed 
with the development of HFF for thermal power plants.

<H5>  3. The Development and Deployment of Hollow Fiber Filters </H5>
for Thermal Power Plants 
  3.1 Development for Use in Thermal Power Plants 
  Because of differences in the conditions of nuclear power 
plants and water quality control, development was carried out 
with a mini-module to confirm points that needed particular care 
when designing hollow fiber filters for thermal power plants. 
  3.1.1 Agreement Between Filter Hole Bore and Filtration 
Speed 
  From condensate analysis results of Goi Thermal Power 
Station 
Unit No. 6 and test results of the HFF mini-module, it was 
confirmed that the undissolved matter was mainly composed of 
magnetite (Fe[.sub]3[/]O[.sub]4[/]), which has a peak of 5 
Êm as shown in Figure 4 [not reproduced], and that if this is 
permeated through filtration holes of 0.1 Êm or less at a 
filtration speed of about 0.1 m/h, there will be no blockage and 
all undissolved matter including magnetite can be removed while 
still retaining an extremely small slow rise in differential 
pressure. 
  As well as the above, we considered the effect of oil 
contained in the condensate directly after periodical 
inspections and at other times, and confirmed that, as this was 
an artificial undissolved substance that only occurred in 
microscopic amounts when a new hollow fiber filter was 
installed, it could be effectively managed by covering the outer 
surface of the hollow fiber filter in advance with a film 
membrane. 
  3.1.2 Improving the Alkali Resistance of Module 
Material 
  Since the condensate has a pH of 9.0-9.6 and thus a weak 
alkalinity, we checked the alkali resistance of the hollow 
fibers (polyethylene resin) and module structure elements known 
as the potting and coupling sections. 
  As a result, we confirmed that the polyethylene resin does 
not degenerate even under alkaline conditions, while for the 
module structure elements we decided to use a high polymer 
material whose strength is not affected by an alkaline 
environment. 
  3.2 Application to Thermal Power Plants 
  Condensate filters for nuclear power plants are designed for 
30 percent efficiency for purification operation, but in view of 
the horizontal development across to thermal power plants, we 
applied it with a 50 percent efficiency design for the rated 
flow of condensate in the Goi Unit No. 2, the main objective 
being to clear the water quality for DSS or WES operation, 
considering the demands of the role of load regulation. 
  3.2.1 Condensate Purifiers 
  The PCF in the No. 2 unit is composed of three parallel 
auxiliary precoat filters, and has a capacity to process a total 
condensate rated flow of about 700 t/h. 
  This device is located between the condensate pump and 
condensate demineralizer, and purifies the condensate in the 
sequence shown in Figure 5 [not reproduced]. 
  3.2.2 The Hollow Fiber Filter Device 
  The HFF has been installed in place of one of the existing 
PCFs. One of these devices has the capacity to process 50 
percent (350 t/h) of the rated condensate flow. Its composition 
and specifications are as shown in Figure 6 [not reproduced] and 
Table 2.

<H5>  4. Operating Conditions and Evaluation </H5>
  Continuous operation in the No. 2 unit was started on March 
29th 1988. In Table 2 we show the figures for approximately four 
years of operation since then, as well as evaluations. 
  Meanwhile, Table 3 shows a comparison of the methods of 
operating condensate purifiers accompanying the change to HFF 
equipment.

                                                 modification) 


  4.1 Characteristics of HFF Purification 
  When the unit was started, the outlet water quality was good 
with an impurity concentration of 1 ppb or less, regardless of 
fluctuations in the HFF inlet water quality. With the existing 
PCF, if the inlet impurity concentration is high the outlet 
concentration is also high and a long time has been required 
until the economizer inlet water quality standard has been 
satisfied. But with HFF we confirmed that high-concentration 
impurities during start-up can be removed in a short time, as 
shown in Figure 7 [not reproduced], and thus that the HFF makes 
a great contribution to both DSS and WES operation in thermal 
power units. 
  As a result, a target time of 150 minutes was achieved 
between ignition and full load when during DSS of unit No. 2. 
  4.2 Restoring Pressure Differential by Reverse 
Condensing 
  As a result of approximately 4 years of operation with 
reverse condensing whenever processed water amounted to 800,000 
m[.sup]3[/] or pressure differential rose 0.3 
kg/cm[.sup]2[/] above the initial value, we are now operating 
with a normal 0.8 kg/cm[.sup]2[/] change in pressure 
differential, as shown in Figure 8 [not reproduced]. 
  With a reverse condensor cycle (800,000 m[.sup]3[/]/cycle) 
in which an HFF clad trapping load of 10 g/cm[.sup]2[/] is 
assumed, after about three years of operation the rise in 
pressure differential per reverse condensor cycle has now 
flattened out at a low 0.1 kg/cm[.sup]2[/]. From this we can 
hypothesize that we may extend the cycle to 1-1.5 million 
m[.sup]3[/]/cycle in future. 
  4.3 Verification of the Filter Design Capacity 
  The iron concentration at the HFF outlet is stable at 1 ppb, 
regardless of the operating condition of the unit or the inlet 
concentration. Moreover, the total iron removal rate from 
start-up to full load is a high 98 percent, as shown in Figure 9 
[not reproduced]. From these facts we confirmed that we were 
correct to design for a maximum condensate flow of 1/2 (350 t/h). 
  4.4 Simplification of Operation and Maintenance 
  4.4.1 Operability 
  While with PCF approximately 50 on-site reverse condensor 
cycles are needed per year, with HFF it is possible to carry out 
around three per year, all by remote control from a central 
control room. 
  4.4.2 Reverse Condensing Time 
  While a single cycle of reverse condensing and precoating 
took 240 minutes with PCF, with HFF we have been able to aim for 
a reverse condensing time of 40 minutes, or a reduction of about 
3 hours. 
  4.5 Lightening the Load on the Demineralizer and 
Suppressing Clad Leakage to the Boiler Feed Water System 
  The vast reduction in impurities flowing in to the 
demineralizer means that the phenomenon of impurity coating on 
the resin is diminished. Thus it is now possible not only to 
prevent resin contamination but also to suppress effluence into 
the system by clad which is trapped in the mineralizer each time 
the condensate flow fluctuates. 
  4.6 Estimating Filter Life 
  The maximum pressure loss tolerated by the No. 2 unit HFF is 
2 kg/cm[.sup]2[/] from capacity of the condensate pump. As 
the speed of rise in pressure differential caused by the 
permanent blockage of filters through operation over one year is 
evaluated to be 2-3 times that of the initial year, estimated 
filter life is 7-8 years. 
  Meanwhile, as concerns filter life determined by reduction 
of 
HFF material strength, we are also beginning to understand the 
trends of changes in filter strength as a result of filter 
analysis and other minute checks carried out in each periodic 
inspection, and we are checking its soundness. In recent 
evaluations, our initial estimation of life has been shown to be 
correct, even considering the deterioration with age of 
materials. 
<H5>  5. Conclusion </H5>
  When we modified the No. 2 unit to DSS operation we took the 
opportunity to install the HFF in this instance in a thermal 
power plant, which differs from a nuclear power plant in the 
nature of its impurities, after repeatedly conducting adequate 
lab tests in advance to ascertain whether the hollow fiber 
filter manifested the filter efficiency for which it was 
designed. 
  From operating figures over about four years, it was 
confirmed that it had adequate purifying efficiency not only 
during normal operation but also in DSS and WES start-ups, that 
it was excellent in its reverse condensing properties, and that 
it would be sufficiently effective to have a reverse condensing 
cycle every 800,000 m[.sup]3[/]. 
  Furthermore, in fiscal 1992, we reexamined the design of 
components such as the diameter of filters, to reduce costs. As 
a result, it was confirmed that the total area of filters can be 
halved by doubling linear velocity, and accordingly, cost of 
modules can also be halved, as shown in Table 4.

  Meanwhile, since the condensate from a once-through boiler 
contains only around 0.5 percent ion impurities, and 99.5 
percent clad, we have assumed that conventional demineralizers 
fulfill a function only as basic ion exchangers in the event of 
seawater leaks. We have confirmed that for the role of clad 
processing, which takes up the majority of this, it is important 
that the condensate should be processed principally by HFF. This 
leads us to consider that the design concepts of secondary water 
processing for thermal power will change from now on through the 
adoption of the HFF as the condensate processing technology of 
the future.

  [Text] The various types of concentrators have been adopted 
as one of the main components of product line at various kinds 
of systems in the industrial field. Sasakura has developed the 
unique concentrator to utilize it for not only process 
components but also for the components of treatment process of 
industrial waste water. 
  Sasakura's concentrator of which type is horizontal tube 
evaporator with vapor compression system has significant unique 
design which was developed from the know-hows and experiences 
obtained at the desalination field. 
  The Sasakura's concentrators are generally classified in two 
types in accordance with the equipment used for the compression 
of released vapor, one is electrical motor driven turbo blower 
and the other is steam jet ejector. 
  These types of concentrators will be applied individually or 
jointly in series depending on the type of waste water and, 
therefore, can meet the wide requirement of various types of 
waste water. Furthermore, during the concentration process in 
the evaporator, evaporated vapor will be extracted from the 
system as product water which has sufficient quality to reuse 
after proper post treatment for intended service. 
  The major features of Sasakura's concentrator are as 
follows. 
  1. Stable operation with simple control. 
  2. Compact design requiring small installation area. 
  3. Economical design with lower cost of operation and 
maintenance. 
  4. Available for wide range of plant capacity. 
  In future, it is expected that any industrial waste water 
will not be allowed to discharge outside even after the 
neutralization to avoid the environmental disruption. 
  Under that circumstance, we believe that Sasakura's 
concentrator originated from the experiences of desalination 
technology by way of evaporation can surely contribute to build 
up new reuse system of various kinds of waste water on 
commercial base. 
  This paper explains the introduction of these concentrators 
and examples of installed experiences of waste water treatment. 
<H5>  Case 1. Waste Water Treatment at Demineralization Plant </H5>
  Previous Condition 
  Whole waste water after regeneration of ion exchange resin 
was sent to the outside for specific treatment to dispose. 
  Direct discharging of waste water after neutralization may 
not be allowed to avoid the environmental pollution by the 
highly concentrated chemical components in it. 
  Improved Condition 
  Sasakura's concentrator, reheat type evaporator with steam 
jet ejector, was installed to reduce the waste water quantity by 
90 percent of original one before sending it outside for 
disposal. 
  The distillate water obtained at the concentrator was reused 
and recycled as the industrial fresh water. 
  Eventually, the remarkable cost saving of waste water 
disposal had been performed.

<H5>  Case 2. Waste Water Treatment at Dry Cell Battery </H5>
Manufacturer 
  Previous Condition 
  Whole waste water, major chemical component is 5 percent 
sodium nitrate (NaNO[.sub]3[/]) was sent outside for specific 
treatment to dispose. 
  Improved Condition 
  Sasakura's concentrator, vacuum vapor compression type with 
turbo blower, was installed to reduce the waste water quantity 
by 87.5 percent of original one before sending it outside for 
disposal. 
  The distillate water obtained at the concentrator was reused 
as the industrial fresh water. 
  On the other hand, sodium nitrate concentration at the 
concentrator increases up to 40 percent and it is possible to 
recover the NaNO[.sub]3[/] from that concentrated waste water 
on commercial base. And actual plant to recover 
NaNO[.sub]3[/] is constructed.

<H5>  Case 3. Waste Water Treatment at Electro Deposition System </H5>
  It is essential for the manufacturer carrying out the 
electro 
deposition to make the whole waste water in closed cycle and no 
waste water is allowed to discharge outside to avoid the 
environmental pollution. 
  The waste water is mainly the washed water of metal surface 
before electro deposition and the rinsed water of resin at 
demineralization plant. 
  The Sasakura concentrator, vacuum vapor compression type 
with 
turbo blower, was installed to reduce the waste water quantity, 
by more than 95 percent and the remaining 5 percent or less 
waste water was sent to drum dryer to solidize the waste for 
disposal. 
  The dryer's size was remarkably reduced with the above 
concentrator. 
  The distillate water obtained at the concentrator was reused 
as the industrial fresh water.

<H5>  Case 4. Waste Water Treatment at Condenser Manufacturer </H5>
  The waste water was planned to recover for recycle use since 
the waste water contains hydrochloric acid, sodium nitrate and 
aluminium with its TDS is around 13,400 mg/l. 
  The evaporator type concentrator was adopted for that 
purpose 
and its vapor release rate was determined at 1,250 kg/H. 
  The concentrator, double effects reheat type evaporator with 
steam jet ejector, was particularly designed so that the heating 
steam from boiler may not be mixed with recovered hydrochloric 
acid nor concentrated waste water. 
  At the concentrator, the purified hydrochloric acid (approx. 
4 percent solution) at the distillate side and aluminium rich 
concentrated water (2.5 times of that in feed water) at the 
waste water side can be separately obtained.

<H5>  Summary </H5>
  In this presentation, we will mention new reverse osmosis 
membrane modules developed recently for novel ultrapure water 
production processes, ``SU-900S'' and ``SU-700P''. 
  ``SU-900S'' is the second stage membrane module in two stage 
RO process, and has high rejection of cations at low 
concentrations and high pH. Consequently in the two stage RO 
process using SU-700 for the first stage and SU-900S for the 
second one, high resistivity of product water, which is equal to 
the primary ion exchange process (5-10 M_O_-cm), can be 
obtained. 
  ``SU-700P'' is the RO membrane module for post-treatment of 
ion exchange process, and has high rejection of TOC and special 
cleanliness without self-elution. Consequently an induction 
period to attain an original TOC level of feed water can be 
shortened to less than several hours, and the TOC level finally 
reached can be 8-10 ppb lower than the original level of feed 
water TOC concentration (10-20 ppb) by using this module. 
<H5>  Introduction </H5>
  We have already developed several kinds of high performance 
polyamide composite membranes for reverse osmosis. They have 
replaced cellulose acetate membranes in the field of ultrapure 
water production, seawater desalination, softening and 
desalination of brackish water, and recovery of valuable 
materials. In the conventional ultrapure water production 
system, which example is shown in Figure 1 [not reproduced], the 
RO process is already indispensable fundamental technique 
because it is the most suitable separation technique for 
production of ultrapure water from raw water such as municipal 
or well water. 
  As Large Scale Integration (LSI) circuit technology has 
progressed and its micro-processing technology requires ultra 
clean environments and materials, the need for higher quality 
ultrapure water is growing and consequently organic extractables 
come out of ion exchange resins[.sup]1-3[/] are becoming a 
main problem. Table 1 shows the ultrapure water quality target 
for semiconductor manufacturing in Japan.[.sup]4[/]

  Another problem is fluctuation in water quality mainly 
caused 
by ion exchange processes using regeneration type resins. 
Furthermore, regeneration of resins is required every several 
days and needs plenty of chemicals. 
  An an effective solution to these problems, using ``two 
stage 
RO process'' and/or using RO for the post-treatment of ion 
exchange processes are proposed. 
<H5>  The Second Stage Membrane Module in Two Stage RO Process </H5>
  Figure 2 [not reproduced] shows promising examples of a two 
stage RO process in the ultrapure water production system for 
mega bits LSI. The process uses RO membranes in two stage and is 
designed to remove ions, TOC and silica in the primary pure 
water system and acts as a substitution for the primary ion 
exchange process. 
  The purpose of two stage RO process is to substitute 
regeneration type ion exchange process by RO. Therefore, the 
need for chemical regeneration and possible organic substances 
from ion exchange resin are eliminated. The resistivity of 
product water in this process is required 5-10 M_O_-cm. But 
until now it is ordinarily 1-3 M_O_-cm using conventional 
membrane modules such as SU-700 when the feed is typical tap 
water, owing to its low cation rejection at low feed 
concentration and insufficient removal of carbon dioxide. For 
the second stage membrane in such process, it is required high 
cation rejection at low feed concentration and effective removal 
of carbon dioxide. 
  The principle of carbon dioxide removal is shown in Figure 3 
[not reproduced]. In water, carbonic acid shows equilibrium 
among dissolved carbon dioxide gas, bicarbonate ion and 
carbonate ion. Since carbon dioxide gas dissolved in water 
cannot be effectively removed by RO membrane, it is necessary to 
make the raw water alkaline so as to convert the carbon dioxide 
gas to bicarbonate ion or carbonate ion, which can be 
effectively rejected by RO membrane. The carbon dioxide almost 
perfectly dissociates into bicarbonate ion and carbonate ion at 
approximately pH 9. Therefore, the pH of feed water is adjusted 
to be approximately 9 to greatly reject these ions by the RO 
membranes.[.sup]5[/] 
  The electrolyte rejection of conventional fully-aromatic 
polyamide composite membranes, such as SU-700, from aqueous 
solutions containing more than several hundred ppm of 
electrolytes are extremely high. However, if the electrolyte 
concentration is lowered to several ppm such as the feed of 
secondary membrane in the two stage RO process, the electrolyte 
rejection of these membranes is usually reduced. Especially if 
the operation of the RO is carried out at an alkaline pH, cation 
rejection is drastically reduced. 
  Therefore, high rejection of ions at pH 9 are required to 
attain the high resistivity value, and the elimination of silica 
and TOC is also expected. The requirements for the second 
membrane in the two stage RO process are as follows: 
  1) high cation rejection at high pH (ordinarily 9) 
  2) high bicarbonate and carbonate ion rejection 
  3) high silica and TOC rejection 
  4) low operating pressure 
  We have developed the RO membrane module designated 
``SU-900S'', which is based on fully-aromatic polyamide 
composite membrane but chemically modified by cationic 
functional group, and it has a high rejection of cation at low 
feed concentration and alkaline solution compared to SU-700, 
which is widely used as a primary RO module, and any other 
membrane modules. Figure 4 [not reproduced] shows the pH 
dependence of sodium and chloride ion rejection of SU-900S and 
SU-700 when the feed is 1 ppm NaCl. 
  Figure 5 [not reproduced] shows the pH dependence of 
resistivity and sodium ion concentration of product water 
attained by the two stage RO process. The first membrane is 
SU-710 and the second membrane is SU-910S. There are two cases 
concerning adding points of alkali solution; one is at the inlet 
of the first membrane (process A), the other is at the inlet of 
the second membrane (process B). Feed water is tap water in 
these experiments and the inlet pH at the second membrane is 
accurately measured. The recovery ratio of the second membrane 
is 30 percent. In both cases, high resistivity of product water 
is obtained. In process A, the resistivity of product water 
becomes 7.5 M_O_-cm at pH 9, and 3.6 M_O_-cm in process B. 
  In process B, because of a high amount of carbon dioxide in 
the feed to the second membrane, more alkali is needed to adjust 
the pH. By degasification of carbon dioxide the resistivity of 
product water will become higher. 
  In the two stage RO process using SU-700 for the first stage 
and SU-900S for the second one, high resistivity of product 
water, which is equal to the primary ion exchange process (5-10 
M_O_-cm), can be obtained. 
  It may be difficult to measure the concentration of 
carbonate 
ion at low concentration, so we tried to calculate the behavior 
of ion concentration, pH and resistivity of product water as a 
function of the feed pH from the cation and anion rejection at 1 
ppm NaCl feed. In this calculation, we calculated under the 
conditions that the feed is 1 ppm NaHCO[.sub]3[/] and NaOH is 
added to control feed pH, cation and anion rejection are 98 
percent and 95 percent respectively. The result is shown in 
Figure 6 [not reproduced] compared with observed values. The 
calculated curve shows good fitting to the observed values. As 
the pH of feed water is increased (i.e., quantity of added NaOH 
is increased), sodium ion concentration of product water is also 
increased. On the other hand, the concentration of total 
inorganic carbon (TIC, due to dissolved carbon dioxide gas, 
bicarbonate ion and carbonate ion) is decreased because the 
rejection of TIC is increased as a result of the dissociation of 
dissolved carbon dioxide becomes larger at alkaline pH. The pH 
of product water is determined by the difference of 
concentration of sodium ion and TIC, and the pH of product water 
becomes approximately 7 when their concentrations become equal. 
And then the resistivity of product water attains to the highest 
value. 
<H5>  RO Membrane for Post-Treatment of Ion Exchange Process </H5>
  Another application of RO membrane in the ultrapure water 
production system is the post-treatment of the ion exchange 
process. The main purpose of the RO is reduction of organic 
substances eluting from the ion exchange process, especially 
from the cartridge polisher, which is set in the final stage of 
the primary pure water system or in the subsystem. Therefore, 
high TOC rejection and special cleanliness without contamination 
by self-elution are required for the RO membrane modules. 
  We have developed the RO membrane module designated 
``SU-700P'', which is assembled with the best suited crosslinked 
fully-aromatic polyamide composite membrane and designed in view 
of the total clean system including the proper choice of 
materials and effective module structure with an internal flow 
path to eliminate stagnant space. Figure 7 [not reproduced] 
shows the start-up characteristics of TOC using SU-700P. In view 
of electrolytes and organic substances, low contamination by the 
module is shown by quickly reaching the value of ultrapure water 
(feed water) in which the level of resistivity is more than 18.1 
M_O_-cm and the TOC concentration is 10-20 ppb. In the process 
using SU-700P as the post-treatment of ion exchange processes, 
an induction period to attain an original TOC level of feed 
water can be shortened to less than several hours, and the TOC 
level finally reached can be 8-10 ppb lower than the original 
TOC level of feed water concentration (10-20 ppb). 
  In the typical ultrapure water production system, organic 
substances are eluted from ion exchange resins after 
regeneration of them. These impurities are electrolytes and 
nonelectrolytes. The former can be removed by a cartridge 
polisher, but the latter cannot be removed by a cartridge 
polisher or UF membranes. Only RO membranes can remove these 
nonelectrolytes. 
  In this point, the RO module for post-treatment of the ion 
exchange process is able to act as a buffer and controls the 
concentration of TOC when organic substances elute from ion 
exchange resins. 
<H5>  Conclusion </H5>
  1. For the second membrane in the two stage RO process, we

<H5>  Summary </H5>
  Three different methane fermentation processes were 
evaluated 
using the soybean processing waste water. These processes are as 
follows: Process A: Acidification and Methane reactors, Process 
B: Acidification and Methane reactors followed Membrane, Process 
C: Acidification reactor, Membrane and Methane reactor. Three 
performance data were compared from the points of gas production 
under identical organic loading and operating conditions. 
  Process C is excellent and recommendable when a waste water 
enriched organic SS is treated, because a membrane application 
between Acidification and Methane reactors allows a clear 
two-phase separation in substrate degradation. 
<H5>  Introduction </H5>
  Methane fermentation process is considered one of the major 
biological waste water treatment processes characterizing energy 
recovery from substrates contained in a waste water. From a 
kinetic viewpoint, methane fermentation is described as three 
steps involving 1) hydrolysis of complex organic material, 2) 
acid production, 3) conversion of acetate or hydrogen to 
methane. The overall anaerobic conversion of organic matters to 
the end products: CH[.sub]4[/], CO[.sub]2[/] and 
NH[.sub]3[/], proceeds simultaneously within a reactor. 
Otherwise, according to reactor operating conditions, methane 
fermentation is classified under acidogenic phase and 
methanogenic phase. While a major drawback in methane 
fermentation was long hydraulic retention time (HRT), lots of 
work for upgrade of methane fermentation efficiency have been 
carried out. 
  Such efforts are attempted to improve methane fermentation 
efficiency, for example, 1) two-phase fermentation process in 
which acidogenic and methanogenic phases can operate under 
optimal conditions,[.sup]1[/] 2) accumulation of high 
microbial concentration in a reactor using microbial 
carrier,[.sup]2[/] 3) UASB rector contributed by microbial 
pellet and granule formation,[.sup]3[/] and 4) membrane 
introduced reactor.[.sup]4[/] 
  A membrane reactor of aerobic waste water treatment plant 
has 
widely been utilized in water reclamation systems. On the other 
hand, application of membrane to methane fermentation process is 
on a starting step. A great advantage of membrane application in 
methane fermentation process might upgrade efficiency due to 
methanogen accumulation. However, few studies have been reported 
regarding where a membrane should be introduced in a two-phase 
methane fermentation process. Further, few reports on 
quantitative analysis of improved performance between a 
conventional two-phase fermentation process and a membrane 
combined two-phase fermentation process. 
  This study demonstrates a two-phase methane fermentation 
combined with a membrane separation unit for furthermore 
improvement of efficiency in gas production and treated water 
qualities. The purpose was to obtain comparison performances in 
terms of three different methane fermentation processes. These 
processes are as follows: Process A: Acidification and Methane 
reactors, Process B: Acidification and Methane reactors followed 
Membrane, Process C: Acidification reactor, Membrane and Methane 
reactor. 
  Since a membrane was introduced between two reactors, it was 
of great interest whether perfect two-phase separation occurred 
in the process. A series of continuous field test was carried 
out in a soybean processing factory employing pilot scale plant 
consisting of fixed bed reactors. 
<H5>  Experimental </H5>
  Apparatus 
  A flow sheet of pilot plant and the specification of main 
apparatus are shown in Figure 1 [not reproduced] and Table 1 
respectively. The reactor is divided into two chambers, 
acidification and methane reactors. Both reactors equip 
microbial carriers made of polyvinylidene chloride nonwoven 
fabrics. Circulation pumps provide up-flow in each reactor. Gas 
produced from each reactor passes through desulfurization tower. 
A membrane used is of an external pressure capillary type whose 
molecular weight cut off approximates 15,000. Five modules of 
ultra filtration (UF) membrane ensured a constant effluent water 
quality with merry-go-round usage.

  Procedures 
  Table 2 shows typical characteristics of waste water 
discharged from soybean processing factory. A specific feature 
of waste water lies in 60 percent protein content of total 
organic matters and relatively high VSS concentration stemmed 
from fine soybean particles. The temperature of waste water was 
controlled at about 30 Celsius.

  The pH was adjusted to 6.0 in acidification reactor and 7.5 
in methane reactor. The HRT ranged 3.3-3.5 hour in acidification 
reactor and 6.7-7.0 hour in methane reactor. 
  Figure 2 [not reproduced] gives a block diagram of three 
different processes used in this study. The continuous run for 
Process A was initially conducted for approximately six months. 
In the second step, Process B continued for approximately 100 
days. In the final step, a membrane was replaced between 
Acidification and Methane reactors. The continuous run for 
Process C proceeded for approximately six months. Thus, a series 
of continuous run for three processes employed the identical 
experimental conditions. 
  Analysis and Measurement 
  Flow rates of water and gas, temperatures, pHs, ORPs and 
methane content were continuously recorded. The water quality 
analysis, in terms of TOC, BOD, COD, SS, VFA and ammonia, was 
executed routinely. An automatic TOC measurement monitored 
hourly variation of raw and treated waters. 
<H5>  Results and Discussion </H5>
  Performance of Process A 
  The continuous run for Process A was carried out to compare 
performances of two membrane introduced processes with a 
conventional two-phase process. Performance data from organic 
loading of approximately 3 kg COD/m[.sup]3[/]/day was chosen 
for the comparison. Average data are summarized in Table 3.

Methane conversion expresses on a COD basis, namely oxygen consumption (kg) required for produced methane combustion divided by raw waste water COD (kg). 



  Process A showed a higher gas production and methane content 
in Methane reactor than those in Acidification reactor. One 
m[.sup]3[/] of waste water produces 308 Nl of methane. In 
treated water, SS and COD concentrations were relatively high 
and acetic acid (HAc) of 38 mg/l was still residual. The COD 
removal percentage (51.8 percent) that should theoretically be 
greater than the methane conversion resulted in the opposite 
phenomenon. This might be attributed by high SS concentration 
discharge in the treated water due to slough off of attached SS 
(microbes and soybean particles) on carriers during the period. 
Because acclimation run (COD loading 3.0 kg/m[.sup]3[/]/day) 
prior to this test provided a good material balance showing up 
COD removal 67.8 percent, methane conversion 54.9 percent and SS 
concentrations in raw water and treated water, 608 mg/l and 238 
mg/l respectively, all the data in Process A except SS and COD 
might be considered possible to employ for process performance 
comparison. 
  Performance of Process B 
  The purpose of Process B was to obtain a clarified water and 
an enhanced biogas production due to recovery of methanogen with 
membrane. Average data for Process B are also demonstrated in 
Table 3. The resultant COD loading was 3.25 
kg/m[.sup]3[/]/day. COD removal (77.7 percent) was 
appreciably improved by decreasing free SS in the treated water. 
In terms of soluble organic acids, higher acetic acid (HAc) and 
propionic acid (HPr) concentrations were found residual in the 
treated water. Pertaining to gas production, methane conversion 
(68.9 percent) showed, on the contrary of the expectation, a 
little lower value than that from Process A. 
  Since the membrane separated perfectly solid and liquid, the 
decrease in methane conversion seemed to be derived from an 
accumulation of soybean suspended solids in Methane reactor. The 
scanning electron microscopic (SEM) observation proved the 
presence of mixture, microbes and soybean SS. Accumulation of SS 
in Methane reactor might cause simultaneous reaction of 
solubilization, acidification and methane production, the 
simultaneous reaction led deterioration of methanogenic 
activity. The two-phase separation was found difficult when a 
membrane introduced in the final step. 
  Performance of Process C 
  A membrane was replaced between acidification and methane 
reactors in Process C. The purpose of this process was to 
enclose soybean particles in the acidification reactor and to 
promote solubilization of particles therein. Accordingly, the 
methane reactor received a permeate contained organic acids. 
Average data for Process C from Table 3 shows the resultant COD 
loading 3.0 kg/m[.sup]3[/]/day. Process C revealed a 
remarkable improvement in terms of COD removal (92.4 percent) 
and methane conversion (83.4 percent). 
  Some 100 mg/l of COD, 26 mg/l of HAc and 16 mg/l of HPr in 
the treated water gave the lowest concentrations among three 
processes. Further, 4 mg/l of SS was a low value, which could 
explain a firm attachment of methanogen on nonwoven fabrics 
carriers. Unlike the performance of Process A and B, 
Acidification reactor provided an increasing gas production. 
Methane production from Acidification reactor occupied 53 
percent of the total value. Hence, Acidification reactor 
introduced membrane system permitted symbiosis of acid forming 
and methane forming bacteria. Since, the membrane permeate was 
free of SS, an ideal methane fermentation seemed to take place 
in the second reactor. A SEM observation disclosed a lot of 
methanothrix-like bacteria attached on carriers. 
<H5>  Conclusions </H5>
  Introduction of a membrane in different locations caused a 
great difference in performance. Process B showed a clear 
blockage of SS in the treated water. However, there was no 
remarkable improvement in terms of gas production and soluble 
organic matters in the treated water. Process C gave noteworthy 
improvement results compared with Process A. Concerning 
two-phase separation, Process B did not attain it and inversely 
enhanced a heterogeneous microbial formation in Methane reactor. 
Process C, despite a membrane application between Acidification 
and Methane reactors, performed no obvious two-phase separation 
either. However, it allowed a clear two-phase separation in 
substrate degradation process. Conclusively, among three 
processes, Process C is excellent and recommendable when a waste 
water enriched organic SS is treated.

<H5>  1. Introduction </H5>
  Lakes, swamps and suburban rivers of cities have been 
growingly polluted recently in accordance with various kinds of 
waste water drainage. From the viewpoint of resources both for 
domestic and industrial waters, much call has been made on the 
advanced water treatment technique in addition with the 
conventional one. In this advanced water treatment, more 
adsorption operation is employed by granular and powdered 
activated carbon for the purpose of removal of organic 
substances, color, odor, etc. 
  We already succeeded in a promising result from two 
experiments at Kashiwai Water-works of Chiba Prefecture and 
Murano of Osaka Prefecture using a pitch-based activated carbon 
fiber (ACF). This paper deals with the further development that 
the pitch-based ACF has been reformed and the development of 
higher performance ACF ventured on. 
<H5>  2. Reforming ACF </H5>
  Necessity has been confirmed by experiments for 
commercialization so far conducted on the conventional 
pitch-based ACF to improve the removal performance of dissolved 
organic substances and Tri-Holomethane Formation Potential 
compounds. Thus, improvement of the above-mentioned removal 
performance was experimented by enlarging micropore size based 
on this ACF. 
  2-1 Micropore Distribution of Reformed Carbon Fiber 
  The reformed carbon fiber used at this experiment is one 
reactivated after the conventional pitch-based ACF was applied 
with a special treatment. The microporous distribution was 
measured by the low-temperature nitrogen adsorption method. An 
example of the results is shown on Table 1 and Figure 1. 
&lt;graphic&gt; &lt;/graphic&gt; 

&lt;graphic&gt; 
&lt;capt&gt; Figure 1. Pore Distribution&lt;/graphic&gt; 

  It is known from these data that, while keeping micropore, 
mesopore has increased on selective basis. Especially, in the 
reformed carbon fiber of C-Series, it is seen that pore nearly 
19 Angstroms is exceedingly growing. 
  According with this phenomenon, the adsorption performance 
on 
high-molecular substance is expected to be growing. 
  2-2 Surface Observation by Scanning-Type Electron 
Microscope 
  Electron microscopic photos taken at pre- and post-reforming 
are shown in Figure 2 [not reproduced] and Figure 3 [not 
reproduced], respectively. Compared with a very smooth surface 
before reforming, mesopore is observed to have occurred after 
reforming. However, its generation was not much and no change 
was made on the radius of fiber, so it is regarded that there is 
no problem for the utilization of water treatment. 
  2-3 Adsorption Test by Model Materials 
  The adsorption performance was confirmed using such model 
materials as Vitamin B[.sub]12[/], DBS (Dodecyl Benzene 
Sulfonic Acid Natrium), PTS (Pala-Toluene Sulfonic Acid 
Natrium), BS (Benzene Sulfonic Acid Natrium). Figure 4 [not 
reproduced] shows the result of adsorption performance of 
large-molecular Vitamin B[.sub]12[/]. Improved adsorption 
performance was confirmed compared with conventional ACF (A-10: 
1000 m[.sup]2[/]/g). Especially, it shows a performance 
surpassing granular activated carbon in the most-advanced, 
reformed sample (E-1). 
  DBS, PTS and BS are different in the alkyl group combined to 
the benzene ring, and the order of adsorption performance to 
respective activated carbon was so much varied that it was 
impossible to explain merely by mesopore like Vitamin 
B[.sub]12[/]. 
  However, the adsorption performance of the reformed carbon 
fiber was equal or more for each of materials. In other words, 
it is known that the adsorption performance will never be 
degraded by reforming and that of larger molecular material has 
been improved. The remarkable improvement of reformed carbon 
fiber in its adsorption performance has been confirmed also with 
TOC and TOXP. 
<H5>  3. Water Treatment Test by Reformed Carbon </H5>
  A model test of water treatment was conducted using reformed 
carbon fiber. Industrial water was filtered by Watman paper and 
the adsorption treatment effect was confirmed by amount of 
Tri-Halomethane [as published] Formation Potential after 
adsorption and dissolved organic substance. The typical 
condition of water flow is shown on Table 2 and the removal 
effect on Table 3.

<H5>  4. Conclusion </H5>
  The following conclusion was derived as a result of the 
execution of advanced water treatment test using reformed 
activated carbon fiber. 
  (1) Required activation degree of reformed carbon fiber 
  The activation nearly equal to that of reformed carbon fiber 
shown on Table 1 is required in order to attain the target level 
of removal, THM Potential &gt;  80 percent and TOC &gt;  50 
percent, 
and, it is judged that advanced treatment performance, either 
equal to or more than granular activated carbon will be 
attained, if reformed carbon fiber around this level is used. 
  (2) Water flow condition 
  Subject to the activation degree of reformed carbon fiber, 
the condition will be required somewhere around: SV = 8 
Hr[.sup]-1[/], water flow ratio = 50 m[.sup]3[/]/ACF-kg. 
  (3) Regeneration 
  Regeneration by alkali is possible with any of reformed 
carbons fiber, same as raw material carbon fiber.

  [Text] Most nuclear power-related databases are still not 
open to the general public. There are a few nuclear power 
information network systems that can be readily accessed using 
personal computers and modems, but the majority of these systems 
are closed and can only be accessed and used by power companies, 
research institutes and other pertinent organizations. And there 
is a lot of data on nuclear power that has yet to be converted 
to an electronic format, i.e. databases that have been 
maintained as-is in hardcopy form, and others which have gone 
electronic, but which are simply accumulations of individual 
personal records. 
  The future conversion of stores of valuable data to 
electronic formats will make it easier to utilize this 
information, and current efforts such as the ``Data Freeway'' 
project being sponsored by the Science and Technology Agency 
(STA) are attempting to stimulate the mutual utilization of this 
information by various research organs. The storage and use of 
data via various forms of multi-media such as CD-ROMs will 
likely become more popular in future as well. We can therefore 
look forward to the day when these advances will make nuclear 
power-related information available to the general public, 
thereby promoting a better understanding of this valuable source 
of energy. 
  We apologize in advance for the fact that time and space 
limitations have prevented us from introducing herein more than 
just a portion of the database systems currently in existence in 
Japan.

<H5>  1. Current State of Database Maintenance at JAERI </H5>
  JAERI stores the results of its research in various 
databases. A report of a study carried out in March 1989 
revealed that JAERI maintained roughly 80 such databases. The 
information contained in these databases ranges from that on 
basic research fields to safety research and large-scale 
projects on nuclear fusion. 
  However, most of these databases are used to store 
memorandums on in-house research, to collect data required to 
advance in-house research efforts and/or to serve as records of 
operational activities. Very few of these databases were created 
with the purpose in mind of allowing outsiders to access and use 
the results of JAERI's research. 
  This situation has created discontent among those outside 
JAERI who find it difficult to use the results of JAERI 
research, and this in turn raised the specter of declining 
evaluations of JAERI as a research institute. Therefore, in 
1988, JAERI set up a working group inside its Computing Center, 
and for the next two years this group studied the current state 
of database maintenance at JAERI, database requirements both 
inside and outside of JAERI, and those databases that should be 
upgraded to make them accessible to outside researchers as well 
as the system for accomplishing this. 
  This working group established conditions on which JAERI 
could base decisions for upgrading its databases. These 
conditions are: 
  (1) data available only to JAERI (Originality); 
  (2) data clearly collated via the research capabilities of 
JAERI, and which are of benefit to all researchers 
(Universality); 
  (3) data that JAERI, as an independent research organ, 
should 
make available to outside users (Neutrality). 
  It was also determined that database selection should stress 
the degree of need as well as JAERI's development capacity. The 
working group concluded that it would be impossible for JAERI to 
undertake all the work involved in upgrading its databases on 
its own, and recommended that a full-time organization be 
established for this purpose. 
  Based on these findings, JAERI has continued to strive to 
upgrade its databases, but personnel and budget restrictions 
have made it impossible to keep work moving ahead on schedule. 
However, certain databases with high priorities have already 
been upgraded and are being accessed and used by outside 
researchers. JAERI is also putting together a system that will 
enable its Information Systems Center to maintain and manage 
databases and computer codes capable of being utilized by 
outside parties. 
  I would like to introduce here a number of JAERI databases 
that currently offer good possibilities for outside use. These 
include databases on nuclear fusion experiments (Originality); 
databases containing nuclear data and atomic molecule data 
(Universality); and a PA database, food irradiation database and 
an emergency technical advisory support system database 
(Neutrality). I will not discuss JPDR dismantling data or 
comprehensive data on materials, since these topics are dealt 
with in a separate article. 
<H5>  2. Nuclear Fusion Experiment Databases </H5>
<H5>  2.1 Overview </H5>
  At present, the goals of nuclear fusion experiments include 
using experimental data to clarify the transport phenomenon 
inside plasma; discovering methods for generating higher 
performance plasma; and designing a nuclear fusion reactor based 
on this knowhow. JAERI has constructed the following three types 
of databases to help it achieve these goals. 
<H5>  2.2 Contents of Databases </H5>
<H5>  (1) Experiment Databases </H5>
<H5>  * JT-60 Experiment Database </H5>
  This database contains information related to experiments 
conducted using the JT-60 critical plasma testing device, and is 
actually comprised of four individual databases: 
  [1] a measurements database; 
  [2] a system database (data related to plasma control); 
  [3] a neutral particle heat database; 
  [4] a high frequency heat database. 
  A single shot experiment generates 10MB of data, and the 
JT-60 experiment database comprises data accumulated from 
experiments totaling roughly 20,000 shots. 
<H5>  * JFT-2M Experiment Database </H5>
  This database is used to store experiment data derived from 
JAERI's medium-size high-performance JFT-2M Tokamak development 
testing device. The contents of this database are similar to 
those of the JT-60 database. Each single shot experiment 
generates about 50KB of data, and the JFT-2M experiment database 
holds roughly 50,000 shots worth of experimental data. 
<H5>  (2) Refined Experiment Databases </H5>
  These databases refine the above described experiment 
databases to meet utilization objectives. 
<H5>  * DARTS </H5>
  This system comprises retrieval databases (up to 6KB per 
shot) and tools for retrieving data from the huge JT-60 
database. A retrieval database is a database that extracts data 
characteristic of experiment shots from an experiment database. 
<H5>  * H Mode Database </H5>
  High efficiency containment modes (H modes) are occurring 
experimentally as containment modes during Tokamak plasma 
heating. This database edits data related to H mode experiments 
taken from the JFT-2M experiment database. 
<H5>  (3) JT-60 Experiment Analysis Databases </H5>
  JAERI developed the ADAM database to handle large-scale 
simulations of experimental data. This database comprises [1] a 
magnetofluid equilibrium database, [2] a Tokamak transport 
analysis code input database, and [3] a Tokamak transport 
analysis code output database. 
<H5>  2.3 Retrieval and Utilization Methods </H5>
  Basically, the above databases are configured into tree 
structures consisting of huge lists of shot numbers. Users can 
obtain desired data simply by inputting the shot number and ID 
name. The database management system (DBMS) was developed 
entirely in-house. 
  Of the above described databases, portions of the data 
contained in DARTS has been released and can be accessed via a 
magnetic nuclear fusion database at the University of Texas in 
the United States. Also, portions of the JFT-2M H mode database 
have been registered and are open to the public via the 
Supercomputer Center at the Livermore National Research 
Institute in the United States, where databases on H modes in 
the world's six Tokamak devices are stored. None of the other 
databases have been made available for public use yet. However, 
JAERI has taken the occasion of joint Japan-U.S. research on 
nuclear fusion to begin studying ways to open these other 
databases to the public as well. 
<H5>  3. Nuclear Data </H5>
<H5>  3.1 Overview </H5>
  As used here, nuclear data refers primarily to various data 
related to reactions between neutrons and atomic nuclei required 
for atomic reactor computations, i.e. nuclear reaction cross 
sections and angular distributions, etc. It also includes 
reaction data on charged particles and photons, as well as 
nuclear structure and karyolysis data. 
  This data was obtained via experiments, and there tend to be 
discrepancies and errors between the experimental values. There 
are also certain nuclear species and energy domains for which 
there are no experimental values. This data, therefore, is not 
suitable for reactor computations as-is. To make it suitable, it 
is necessary to study the experimental values in detail and 
select the correct ones, and where there are no experimental 
values, to make good use of nuclear reaction theory and systems 
to assign unique recommendation values that cover the entire 
energy domain for all required physical quantities. This work is 
known as evaluating nuclear data, and nuclear data that has been 
evaluated in this way is referred to as evaluated nuclear data. 
And when this evaluated nuclear data is compiled into a 
fixed-format database, it is referred to as an evaluated nuclear 
data library. An evaluated nuclear data library is the ultimate 
goal for nuclear data. Users then process this nuclear data to 
meet their own objectives, and utilize it in the form of group 
constants. 
  The evaluation of nuclear data has to start with the 
retrieval of huge amounts of experimental data. For this reason, 
international cooperation is vital. Therefore, a network of four 
neutron nuclear data centers was established in the 1960's. 
These four centers are located in four different regions of the 
world, and individual international centers were set up to take 
responsibility for the operation of these respective neutron 
nuclear data centers (the international center for Japan is 
called the NEA Databank). This system enables experimental data 
and bibliographic databases generated in the respective areas of 
responsibility (AORs) to be shared via the network, and serviced 
within the respective AORs. 
  In Japan, JAERIs Nuclear Data Center, with the cooperation 
of 
the SIGMA Committee, was developed into the Japanese Evaluated 
Nuclear Data Library (JENDL). 
<H5>  3.2 Contents </H5>
  Nuclear data is the most widely utilized data of all the 
data 
stored in JAERI's databases. Let's discuss the principal kinds 
of data currently being managed by the Nuclear Data Center. 
<H5>  * NESTOR 2 </H5>
  This is an experimental value database, and was constructed 
by converting data obtained from the NEA Databank into an 
original JAERI database. This database currently holds 
approximately 2.5 million data elements. 
<H5>  * JENDL </H5>
  This is Japan's standard evaluated nuclear data library, and 
is an encyclopedia of the results of Japan's nuclear data 
activities. The latest version of this library, JENDL-3, 
contains data on 324 nuclear species, and approximately 980,000 
data records. 
  And in addition to these general files, JENDL is also in the 
process of becoming the repository for special purpose files 
containing evaluated data on dosimetry, gas generation, 
activation, (a,n) reactions, nuclear fusion neutron engineering, 
actinides, photonuclear reactions, kerma (phonetic) and high 
energy. 
<H5>  * JNDC FP Karyolysis Data Library </H5>
  This is a data library for FP karyolysis heat computations, 
and is another major achievement of the SIGMA Committee. The 
latest version of this data library contains data on 1,227 
nuclear species, and roughly 9,500 records. 
<H5>  * ENSDF </H5>
  This is an evaluated nuclear structure/karyolysis data 
library, and under the auspices of the IAEA, JAERI received 
international cooperation in evaluating the data contained 
herein by mass number. Evaluation allotment in Japan worked out 
to A = 188-127, and as a database, the ENSDF data library 
contains approximately 880,000 records covering all mass numbers. 
<H5>  3.3 Retrieval and Utilization Methods </H5>
  There is no need for a complicated DBMS since nuclear data 
is 
generally used by nuclear species and by reaction. 
  Data stored in JENDL et al. as evaluated data is saved to a 
data retrieval system where users can call this information up 
to their display screens by specifying in an interactive mode 
the nuclear species name and reaction name. They can also view 
numerical data in this way. Users are capable, therefore, of 
using all the evaluated data stored at the Nuclear Data Center. 
  Beginning with JENDL, all the nuclear data maintained by the 
Nuclear Data Center is available to the public. Those wishing to 
utilize this data need only fill out a specified application 
form and submit it to the Nuclear Data Center in order to access 
its databases. 
<H5>  4. Atomic Molecule Data </H5>
<H5>  4.1 Overview </H5>
  The atomic molecule data maintained at JAERI's Nuclear Data 
Center is related to nuclear fusion plasma. More specifically, 
this data consists of: 
  1) collision process data such as ionization cross sections 
and charge transfer cross sections of ions and atomic molecules 
in plasma, 
  2) data on the interaction of particles in the plasma with 
the first wall and the diverter, 
  3) ion spectral data for identifying impurities in plasma. 
  There is no network for bibliographic or experimental data 
for atomic molecule data like the four international centers 
established for nuclear data, which means that researchers must 
search for experimental data on their own. However, a system has 
been put together recently under the auspices of the IAEA for 
international cooperation in evaluating atomic molecule data. 
This system is called the ALADDIN network system, and Japan is 
contributing data to this system. 
<H5>  4.2 Contents </H5>
  The following databases are currently being managed by the 
Nuclear Data Center. 
<H5>  * Bibliographic Data </H5>
  JAERI, in cooperation with IAEA and ORNL, has been storing 
bibliographic data since 1987. 
<H5>  * AMSTOR </H5>
  This is an atomic molecule experiment database that stores 
roughly 80,000 records. 
<H5>  * JEAMDL </H5>
  This is an evaluated atomic molecule data library. In 
response to increasing requirements for this information, this 
database has been expanded to include JEAMDL-1, -2 and -3. JAERI 
is currently in the process of constructing JEAMDL-4 using data 
requested from ITER and FER. 
  Roughly 180,000 data elements are stored in JEAMDL-3 
consisting of evaluated data on approximately 300 types of 
collision processes involving H, H2, He, Li and ion impurities, 
plus Ti-Cu, Kr and Mo ion spectral data and elementary process 
data on particle recycling. 
<H5>  4.3 Retrieval and Utilization Methods </H5>
  The DBMS for atomic molecule data is a very simple system 
similar to the one for nuclear data. Persons wishing to utilize 
atomic molecule databases can do so simply by applying to the 
Nuclear Data Center. 
<H5>  5. STA's Nuclear Power PA Database </H5>
<H5>  5.1 Overview </H5>
  The importance of nuclear power is beyond doubt, and for 
that 
reason people must possess an accurate understanding of it. This 
makes the communication of accurate information on nuclear power 
imperative. However, nuclear power-related information is 
diverse, to the extent that even the experts are incapable of 
knowing all there is to know. This leads to instances where 
misleading and/or contradictory information gets circulated, 
raising the fear that people will become suspicious and 
distrustful of nuclear power. 
  In order to rectify this situation, the Science and 
Technology Agency (STA) commissioned JAERI to develop a nuclear 
power PA database containing accurate information on nuclear 
power and related issues that can be retrieved via 
telecommunications lines. Since this database is to serve as a 
kind of electronic encyclopedia on nuclear power, and as such, 
will contain various and diverse information, to ensure 
accuracy, JAERI is coordinating the documents and other 
materials and editing the contents of the database in 
cooperation with the National Institute of Radiological Sciences 
(NIRS), the Power Reactor and Nuclear Fuel Development 
Corporation (PNC), the Japan Atomic Industrial Forum Inc. 
(JAIF), the Japan Nuclear Power Culture Promotion Foundation and 
the Nuclear Power Safety Research Association. 
  For the time being, JAERI feels that users of this database 
will be more or less limited to government officials, PA 
instructors/lecturers, educators and others closely involved in 
nuclear power PA. 
  Development of this database got underway in 1989, and the 
first stage of construction is scheduled to be completed this 
year. 
<H5>  5.2 Contents </H5>
  This database is configured in a tree structure that 
cascades 
down from general to intermediate to specific items and finally 
to the various details concerning these items. The detailed data 
comprise titles, summaries, keywords, texts, diagrams, and 
reference materials. 
  General items of information consist of the following 16 
items: 1) energy, 2) electric power, 3) national policies and 
plans concerning nuclear power, 4) nuclear power generation 
technology and its current status, 5) nuclear fuel cycle 
technology and its current status, 6) nuclear reactor 
obsolescence devices, 7) nuclear power safety regulations, 8) 
operation management data, 9) nuclear power safety research, 10) 
new uses for nuclear power, 11) radiation, 12) international 
cooperation, 13) public opinion, 14) overseas trends, 15) Q&amp;A 
and 16) supplementary data. In editing this data, JAERI is 
taking care to contribute to users' decisions by making the 
bibliographic data readable and easy-to-understand (complete 
with diagrams), avoiding a PA style and stating facts. Overall, 
approximately 1,500 titles are being input into this database, 
along with roughly 2,400 diagrams and about 300 reference works. 
<H5>  5.3 Retrieval and Utilization Methods </H5>
  The three main methods of retrieval capable with this 
database are: 
  1) vertical retrieval whereby you retrieve displayed menus 
sequentially beginning with general items, 
  2) word retrieval whereby retrieval is accomplished by 
inputting the appropriate words, 
  3) retrieval via the serial numbers (structural numbers) for 
each title. 
  Retrieval is achieved using a personal computer or dedicated 
word processor, communications software and ordinary telephone 
lines. Retrieved data is either saved to a floppy disk or 
printed out using a printer. Diagrams incorporated into the data 
can be obtained via a facsimile machine. 
  Since this database is currently being operated on a trial 
basis, usage is limited to individuals registered with JAERI. 
But JAERI is in the process of hooking its mainframe computer up 
to a domestic packet-switched network, and plans to make the 
database public by April, 1994. 
<H5>  6. Emergency Technical Advisory Support System: COSTA </H5>
<H5>  6.1 Overview </H5>
  In the unlikely event an accident should occur at a nuclear 
power plant, and it should impact or threaten to impact on the 
surrounding community, an emergency technical advisory 
organization (hereafter referred to as the advisory team), 
established by the Nuclear Safety Commission and comprised of 
nuclear power specialists will be called in to give a broad 
range of advice on everything from problems inside the plant to 
environmental impact evaluations and safeguard activities. In 
support of these advisory activities, JAERI was commissioned by 
the STA to develop a computer-based emergency technical support 
system called COSTA. JAERI's Emergency Systems Laboratory 
commenced work on COSTA in 1985. 
  Of the data required by the advisory team, COSTA is used 
primarily to rapidly access the following information concerning 
the inside of nuclear power plants: 
  a) edited graphs and tables showing accident-related data 
transmitted from the plant (pressure in primary systems and the 
operability of safety equipment, etc.), 
  b) the soundness of the pressure vessel, storage vessel and 
fuel cladding that serves as the FP containment barrier, time 
until each of these elements loses its soundness, and estimated 
time of FP discharge into the environment, the volume of that 
discharge and its effect, 
  c) samples of analyses of plant behavior during simulated 
accidents, 
  d) data on equipment specifications for the pertinent plant, 
  e) accident malfunction data generated in the past at the 
pertinent plant and/or accident malfunction data similar to that 
of the accident in question, 
  f) exposure dosage predictions for areas surrounding the 
site 
based on simple computer models, 
  g) data related to those operations carried out in support 
of 
the emergency advisory team. 
  There is also another system already in operation called the 
SPEEDI Network System that predicts environmental radiation 
impact in times of emergency. JAERI plans to integrate these two 
systems in future to create an Emergency Technical Advisory 
Bureau (ETAB) support system. 
<H5>  6.2 Contents of System </H5>
  In order to achieve the above described functions, the COSTA 
system configuration consists of basic databases and information 
processing programs. 
  There are three kinds of basic databases in the COSTA 
system. 
These are: 
  a) a nuclear power generation database (a database on the 
nuclear power plant itself complete with schematic diagrams), 
  b) an accident history database (a database containing 
information on past accidents and malfunctions) 
  c) a support database (a database containing information on 
accident analyses and experimental data). Image data related to 
databases a) and b) are stored in an electronic filing system. 
  The information processing programs are used to carry out 
comprehensive analyses of data stored in the databases and 
accident information communicated from the plant at the time of 
the accident. These programs comprise three types: 
  a) a database information retrieval and display program, 
  b) a program for determining the soundness of the FP barrier 
and for predicting FP discharge, 
  c) a consultation system. 
  The consultation system incorporates a database of the 
emergency procedures followed by the emergency technical 
advisory team during an emergency situation and is designed to 
increase the efficiency of the advisory team's actions. 
<H5>  6.3 Utilization Methods </H5>
  Due to the very nature of this system, it is designed to be 
used only by experts in emergency situations. However, since 
there is no way of predicting when an emergency will occur, the 
hardware and software are continuously maintained so that the 
system can be used at any time.

  [Text] The news media have been running more stories on the 
subject of nuclear power in recent years, but it seems that 
large numbers of people have yet to sense the importance of this 
information. In order to get even a little more nuclear 
power-related information (data) out to larger numbers of 
people, the Atomic Power Technology Agency, at the behest of the 
Ministry of International Trade and Industry (MITI) in September 
1990 commenced operation of the Atomic Power Information Service 
Network (nicknamed Atom Net) to provide information to people 
via personal computer-based communications systems. During the 
roughly three years since that time, an average of 40 users have 
accessed this system daily, significantly exceeding our 
pre-operation user estimates. 
  In the hopes of getting even more people to use ``Atom Net'' 
services, I would like to take this opportunity to explain how 
to use this service and to give an overview of the kinds of data 
stored in the system. 
<H5>  1. How To Use Atom Net </H5>
  Anybody with a personal computer (or dedicated word 
processor) equipped with communications software and a modem can 
utilize Atom Net services. The communication software parameters 
are the same as those for ordinary PC communications packages. 
The line settings are as follows: 
  Baud rates: 1200/2400 bps 
  Kanji code: Shift JIS Kanji 
  No. of data bits: 8 bits 
  No. of stop bits: 1 bit 
  Parity: None 
  Flow control: Xon/Xoff 
  Communication protocol: No protocol (However, XMODEM is used 
for graphics.) 
  To access the system, specify auto-dial on your 
communications software and dial Atom Net's modem number 
(03-5470-5511). Once you have connected with the system, the 
user ID input screen will be displayed. I have given the Tokyo 
modem number here, but people in outlying regions wishing to use 
Atom Net services may dial whichever of the 140 access points 
nationwide is closest to their locations. Access point modem 
numbers are listed in the Atom Net ``User's Guide,'' or can be 
obtained by calling the ``Atomic Power Telephone Question Box'' 
discussed below. 
  Atom Net information provision services are available 
24-hours-a-day, which means you can avail yourself of these 
services whenever you like. 
  When the user ID input screen appears, you will be prompted 
to ``Please enter 000.'' At this point, enter ``000'' and press 
RETURN. This will display the prompt ``Please enter return 
key,'' at which time you should press RETURN once again to 
display the MAIN MENU. This makes it possible for anyone to use 
Atom Net services without having to worry about user IDs or 
registered passwords. And the service is free (you will still be 
required to pay the telephone charges incurred during use, 
however). 

<FIG ID=JPRS-JST-019L-06A>      Figure 1. User ID Input Screen </FIG>


  For those people with questions concerning the contents of 
the Atom Net database system, you can call the Atomic Power 
Technology Agency's ``Atomic Power Telephone Question Box'' at 
Tel: 0120-119433 and get answers to all your questions and 
inquiries. 
  The data available via Atom Net consists of bibliographic 
data as well as graphics such as graphs and the like, the latter 
of which can be utilized provided your communications software 
is equipped with XMODEM protocol capabilities and you have the 
graphics software ``Hanako,'' or any software capable of reading 
``Hanako Ver 1.0'' data. 
<H5>  2. Atom Net Special Features </H5>
  We were afraid that if we made the nuclear power information 
stored in Atom Net available in text form alone, it would just 
be like other databases and would not hold any particular appeal 
for users. We therefore decided to equip Atom Net with some 
special features. 
  The first of these features is the fact that it provides 
both 
textual and image data, the latter consisting of graphs and 
drawings. There is a lot of nuclear power-related information 
that is difficult to grasp by reading textual data alone, much 
of which is easier to understand if it is accompanied by visual 
data such as graphs and drawings. Based on this fact, we 
constructed the Atom Net so that users with graphics software 
can call up image data whenever they need it. 
  The second special feature built into Atom Net is its ``News 
Flash'' capabilities concerning trouble that occurs at nuclear 
power plants. Whenever trouble breaks out at a nuclear power 
plant, the press release put together by MITI is input into the 
system as soon as MITI releases that news to the media, and can 
be accessed that same day. Therefore, Atom Net trouble reports 
are available at the same time as, and in some cases, sooner 
than they reach the newsstands. 
<H5>  3. Contents </H5>
  The data contained in Atom Net is compiled under seven main 
menus, for a total of 960 data elements (as of the last day of 
June, 1993). When Atom Net first commenced operation, it started 
out with just 237 data elements, but today, after being in 
operation for three years, that figure has quadrupled. 
  In general, data is maintained and updated every Friday 
afternoon, but announcements of trouble reports from nuclear 
power plants are input the day they are published.

<H5>  Conclusions </H5>
  Because Atom Net is a specialized database comprised of 
difficult information, prior to opening the system to the public 
there was some concern over just how many people would be 
interested in using such a database. However, since commencing 
operations, there have been days when Atom Net has been accessed 
by over 300 users, and it is not unusual to see the really 
dedicated users accessing the system in the middle of the night. 
The large numbers of people using Atom Net are indicative of the 
degree of interest in energy-related issues on the part of 
ordinary citizens, and the ongoing boom in personal computer 
usage. 
  We will strive to update and provide increasingly more 
complete data, and to make it even easier to use Atom Net in 
future.

<H5>  1. Introduction </H5>
  The NUCLEN Nuclear Power Information Database (NUCLEN File) 
was constructed and its services are provided by the Japan 
Information Center of Science and Technology (JICST). JICST, at 
the behest of the national government, developed this database 
for the purpose of promoting an understanding of nuclear power 
and its usage by making available to as broad a segment of the 
populace as possible information on nuclear power-related 
policies, technologies and educational programs. 
  Services are provided in the online mode using the JOIS 
information retrieval system, which JICST developed on its own. 
In addition to NUCLEN, the following database services are also 
provided via JOIS: JICST Science and Technology Bibliographic 
File (JICST File), a broad-based collection of scientific and 
technological data in bibliographic form obtained from science 
magazines, conference proceedings and reports generated around 
the world; JMEDICINE, a Japanese medical bibliographic file 
comprised of medical-related documents; and the medical 
bibliographic file MEDLINE. 
  The NUCLEN File was constructed around a core of nuclear 
power-related data extracted from the JICST File, to which was 
added government and public relations data. The NUCLEN File is 
an accumulation of data dating back to 1981, and as of June, 
1993, contained roughly 300,000 data elements. This file is 
updated once every six months. The principal fields covered and 
number of data elements for each field are shown in Table 1.

  Because of the previously stated goals behind the 
construction of the NUCLEN File, services are provided free of 
charge, and for users who wish to obtain hard copies of data 
they accessed via this system, a free copy service is also 
offered. And a gratuitous translation service is also offered 
for foreign-language documents accessed via NUCLEN. 
<H5>  2. Accessing the NUCLEN File </H5>
  The NUCLEN File can be accessed online using a personal 
computer equipped with a modem connected to a telephone line. 
Table 2 lists 10 JICST branch offices that serve as access 
points for NUCLEN, plus the system can also be accessed from 
anywhere nationwide via the DDX and INS-P systems. Three baud 
rates -- 300, 1200 and 2400 bps -- can be used to access NUCLEN 
via JICST and INS-P access points, and two baud rates -- 300 and 
1200 bps --are used to access it via the DDX system. The method 
for accessing NUCLEN differs depending on whether you use 
commercial off-the-shelf communications software or the 
dedicated retrieval software provided free of charge by JICST.

<H5>  (1) Accessing the System Using Commercial Communications </H5>
Software 
  1. Dial the number to the access point. 
  2. Check to make sure the modem data lamp is ON, then press 
RETURN. 
  3. The message ``JICST NETWORK PLEASE ENTER 
(JOIS,STN,JOISF):'' will be displayed. Enter ``JOIS'' and press 
RETURN. 
  4. The message ``CONNECTED.. ENTER TERMINAL ID'' will then 
be 
displayed, at which time you simply press RETURN. 
  5. The message ``JICST ON-LINE SERVICE'' is then displayed. 
Input ``&yen;JOIS 000-5454, (your name),'' and press RETURN. 
  6. The message ``Password please U:$$$$$$$$'' will be 
displayed, at which point you input ``NUCLEN,'' and press RETURN. 
  7. Then the message ``S: Commence dialog U:'' will be 
displayed, and access is complete. After the ``U:'' input 
``&yen;FILE 610'' to commence retrieval. 
<H5>  (2) Accessing the System Using JICST Dedicated Retrieval </H5>
Software 
  The NUCLEN dedicated retrieval software is menu driven, and 
selecting ``G. Library Guide'' from the menu screen will bring 
up the retrieval screen. (It will take a little time for the 
menu screen to change to the retrieval screen since auto log in 
and auto dial operations must be carried out first.) 
  And those who do not own personal computers can come in to 
any JICST branch office or cooperating agency and make free use 
of the dedicated software-equipped personal computers installed 
in those locations. Table 2 provides a list of addresses and 
telephone/modem numbers of JICST's branch offices nationwide. 
<H5>  3. Example of NUCLEN File Retrieval Operation </H5>
  Figure 1 provides an example of a retrieval operation in 
which a Japanese-language NUCLEN file was retrieved on the 
subject of ``Nuclear Power Generation Safety.'' 

<FIG ID=JPRS-JST-019L-012A>      Figure 1. Sample Retrieval Operation </FIG>


<H5>  4. Methods of retrieving NUCLEN Files </H5>
  Retrieval items are divided into primary and secondary 
retrieval items, and the methods for retrieving these differ. 
The number of data elements are displayed in the retrieval 
response together with the SSno. (retrieval step number). 
<H5>  (1) Primary Retrieval Items </H5>
  Primary retrieval items consist of (1) all keywords, (2) 
category codes, (3) authors' names and (4) document titles. Each 
item has its own retrieval code, to which colons (:) are 
attached in order to retrieve them. 
<H5>  [1] All Keywords </H5>
  Words contained in titles, abstracts, control words and etc. 
are compiled into what is called ``All Keywords.'' The retrieval 
code for all keywords is AL, but this code can be omitted. 
  Sample input: U:Nuclear power generation 
  When retrieving data on an item-by-item basis, then the all 
keyword code needn't be used. Use the individual retrieval codes 
for those items instead. 
  The retrieval code for Japanese-language titles, as well as 
those which have been translated into Japanese from foreign 
languages is TI. 
  Sample input: U:TI:Radiation 
  The retrieval code for abstracts that summarize the contents 
of a document in 150-300 words is AB. 
  Sample input: U:AB:Computers 
  Control words, which make use of thesaurus terms to manifest 
the contents of documents, are used to minimize retrieval gaps. 
The retrieval code for control words is KW. 
  Sample input: U:KW:Radium isotope 
  Free term refer to important words that express the contents 
of documents, but which are not contained in the thesaurus. 
NUCLENSUB is provided as the free term for documents other than 
those extracted form JICST files. The retrieval code for free 
term is FT. 
  Sample input: U:FT:NUCLENSUB 
<H5>  [2] Category Codes </H5>
  Category codes are used when you want to make an 
all-inclusive retrieval of general concepts or when you can not 
obtain satisfactory retrieval results using all keyword 
retrieval operations. The principal category codes are provided 
in Table 1. The retrieval code is CC. 
  Sample input: U:CC:NB03060 Z 
<H5>  [3] Authors' Names </H5>
  When retrieving Japanese-language documents by authors' 
names, input these names in katakana last name first. 
  When retrieving foreign-language documents in this way, 
input 
the author's last name first, followed by his first initial. 
  The retrieval code for authors' names is AU. 
  Sample input: A:AU:OKANO SHINJI 
<H5>  [4] Document Titles </H5>
  Document titles are written in English (the titles of 
Japanese-language documents are written in roman letters) and 
are retrieved by inputting the individual titles. 
  Sample input: U:JT:ENERUGI 
  To increase the efficiency of retrieving primary retrieval 
items, you can make use of forward agreement retrieval, logic 
operations and proximity operations. 
  You can use forward agreement retrieval operations when you 
want to retrieve other types of information related to your 
retrieval word, such as ``inspections'' or ``protection'' in 
relation to the retrieval word ``radiation.'' Simply input 
``&amp;'' 
after the retrieval word. 
  Sample input: U:Radiation &amp; 
  Since there is always a lot more information available than 
you are able to find using a single retrieval word, ordinarily 
you retrieve information using two or more retrieval words. This 
is called a logical multiply or AND operation, and uses the word 
``AND'' or an asterisk mark (*) to connect the retrieval word 
and SSNo. (retrieval step number). 
  And when your retrieval word has a number of synonyms, you 
use a logical add or OR operation. The OR operation uses the 
word ``OR'' or a plus sign (+) to connect the retrieval word to 
the SSNo. 
  Sample input: U:Nuclear reactor*non-destructive 
examination 
  When you wish to carry out more precise retrieval operations 
than are possible using logical multiply (AND) operations, then 
you can specify the proximity relationship of retrieval words 
using a proximity operation. With a proximity operation, you 
input so that the proximity operator links the retrieval words 
together. There are four (4) kinds of proximity operators, [W], 
[N], [S] and [F]. 
  The [W] retrieves information in the order that the 
retrieval 
words in front and back of it are input. 
  The [N] proximity operator retrieves information associated 
with the retrieval words in front and back of it, but does so in 
no particular order. 
  The [S] retrieves information that contains the input 
retrieval words in the same paragraph. For this purpose, titles 
are considered one paragraph. 
  The [F] proximity operator retrieves titles, abstracts, 
keywords (control words) and other such items that contain the 
specified retrieval words (in which the retrieval words exist 
together). 
  The proximity operators [W] and [N] cannot be input in 
Japanese (kana). 
  An example of a proximity operation input would be 
``U:JT:ENERUGI[W]KEIZAI'' 
<H5>  (2) Secondary Retrieval Items </H5>
  When you want to focus the results of your primary retrieval 
efforts further by language, publication dates and such, then 
you conduct secondary retrieval operations. You always conduct 
primary retrieval operations before carrying out secondary 
retrieval operations. In secondary retrieval operations, you 
input the retrieval code followed by an equal sign (=). 
<H5>  [1] Language Information is Written In </H5>

  [Text] Various types of software play extremely important 
roles in supporting the research and development of nuclear 
power. More than 30 years have passed since we started 
developing nuclear power, and software has supported the smooth 
progress that has been made in nuclear power development work. 
Advances made in computer technology in recent years have been 
accompanied by demands for more complex, higher-level nuclear 
power-related software, as well as higher quality information on 
a much more timely basis. 
  This trend has been accompanied by remarkable advances in 
computer networking, which is creating an advanced information 
society, which in turn has further accelerated the growth of 
computer networks to the point where now all sorts of 
information can be obtained online. 
  We here at the Nuclear Data Center have been working since 
our establishment to develop software and disseminate 
information related to nuclear power, and have contributed 
toward the development of the nuclear power industry here in 
Japan by collecting and disseminating nuclear codes in our role 
as the point of contact (POC) for Japan's Nuclear Code Center. 
And in keeping pace with the above-described advances, we have 
constructed a nuclear code information database, linked it up to 
the Fujitsu Enhanced Information and Communication Service 
(FENICS) network provided by Fujitsu Corporation and are 
providing Nuclear Code Information Services (NUCIS) online via 
personal computer-based telecommunications. This article is 
designed to introduce you to NUCIS, explain its special 
characteristics and tell you how to retrieve information from it. 
<H5>  1. Overview of NUCIS Database </H5>
  As stated above, NUCIS was constructed to provide online the 
latest nuclear code information to researchers and engineers 
involved in nuclear research and development. The special 
features of this system are: 
  (1) NUCIS contains roughly 1,500 items of nuclear code 
information covering all nuclear power fields. These nuclear 
codes are classified into a total of 24 categories, including 
cross section information processing using nuclear code 
functions (A), and energy spectral calculations (B). A total of 
1,500 nuclear code abstracts that belong to these various 
categories are registered in NUCIS. Table 1 gives the number of 
codes registered in NUCIS by category. 
  (2) NUCIS acquires and registers nuclear code information 
developed and made public by countries the world over, and which 
is stored and managed by the Nuclear Energy Agency of the 
Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development 
(OECD/NEA). This information is periodically furnished to the 
Japan Nuclear Code Center, where it is used to update NUCIS data. 
  (3) NUCIS online services are provided via the FENICS 
network, which has access points located in 110 cities 
nationwide. This makes access to the NUCIS database inexpensive 
since communication charges can be kept low. 
  (4) NUCIS is equipped with detailed retrieval functions 
which 
enable retrieval by category, code and code ID. Specific 
examples of retrieval operations are provided in the following 
section. 
  (5) The database stores 18 code items, to include 
descriptions of code functions, methods of solution, special 
features and material available. The 18 code items stored in 
NUCIS are listed in Table 2. By referring to these code items -- 
the types of computers and operating systems designed to run the 
code information, the functions possessed by the codes, the 
methods of solution, authors' names and special features of the 
codes -- users can determine whether the codes they retrieve 
will meet their requirements. 
  (6) The system has also been equipped with an electronic 
mail 
function that links NUCIS users together with the Code Center, 
making it possible for the Center to field various requests from 
users.

<H5>  2. Retrieval System </H5>
  The NUCIS retrieval system was designed with user 
requirements in mind, i.e. what form user requirements for 
nuclear code information would take. That is, it was felt that 
user requirements for nuclear code information would take one of 
the following three forms: 
  (1) Users would already know the specific code or abstract 
number for that code, and would want to know the special 
features of that code, its methods of solution, programming 
language(s), author's name, etc. 
  (2) The user would not know the code, and would want to find 
out if there is a code for the field he would like to do 
calculations in, for example, structural analysis, 
transportation calculations, combustion computations, etc. 
  (3) The user would want to know which code is most 
applicable 
to the problem he is working on. 
  Figure 1 expresses these various requirements in flowchart 
form. When a user tries to obtain information related to nuclear 
codes, he more than likely already has an objective in mind. For 
instance, he wants to carry out calculations regarding the 
transport of nuclear fuel, or he wants to do structural analysis 
work. Then, if he already knows the specific code that will 
enable him to achieve his objective, he can retrieve information 
from NUCIS by inputting that code directly. 

<FIG ID=JPRS-JST-019L-16A>      Figure 1. NUCIS Utilization Flowchart </FIG>


  Figure 2 provides an example of a retrieval operation where 
the user input the code ``SAFE-3D'' to obtain structural 
analysis data. By inputting the input command (e) shown in 
Figure 2, the user specified 

<FIG ID=JPRS-JST-019L-16B>      FORMULA </FIG>


  [Text]The numeral ``1'' following the code specifies the 
output level. Inputting ``1'' specifies the output of code items 
1-4, ``2'' specifies the output of code items 1-4, 10 and 15-18, 
and ``3'' specifies the output of all code items. 

<FIG ID=JPRS-JST-019L-16C>      Figure 2. Example of Code Retrieval Operation </FIG>


  [Text]If the user doesn't know the specific code he needs, 
he can 
specify the category that applies to the work he wants to do, 
for instance Category ``I'' for structural analysis. Specifying 
``I'' will display a list of codes belonging to that category, 
together with a Kwick Index. 
  Figure 3 (showing a brief explanation of code functions) is 
an example of a retrieval operation in which the user specified 
Category ``I'' (indicated in the figure by (e)). The terms ``I, 
NESC'' are shown in Figure 3. ``I'' is the code for Category I, 
and ``NESC'' stands for the codes made public by the National 
Energy Software Center (NESC) of America's Argonne (phonetic) 
National Laboratories (ANL). In this same manner, the user can 
specify a total of four centers that make nuclear code 
information available to the public. These are the Nuclear 
Energy Agency (NEA) affiliated with OECD headquartered in 
France, NESC, ORNL's Radiation Shielding Information Center 
(RSIC) in the United States and the International Atomic Energy 
Agency (IAEA) of Austria.

  A brief explanation of Category I codes has been output in 
Figure 3. For example, to the right of code ``SAFE-3D'' you can 
read the explanation ``Stress analysis of 3-dimensional 
composite structure by finite element method.'' After reading 
these explanations, the user selects that code which best meets 
his requirements, then goes back to step (1) outlined above, 
inputs the code and retrieves more detailed information. 
  If the user doesn't know the specific code or category, he 
can do a keyword search. To accomplish this, the user must 
characterize or specify the problem he wishes to solve using a 
number of keywords. With NUCIS, it is possible to string these 
keywords together with AND/OR operators to enable sum of sets 
and common class searches, and thus more detailed retrieval 
operations. 
  Figure 4 provides an example of a keyword retrieval 
operation 
which produced the code for a ``three-dimensional structural 
analysis using a finite element method.'' 



<FIG ID=JPRS-JST-019L-18A>      Figure 4. Example of Keyword Retrieval Operation </FIG>


  [Text] As shown in Figure 4, input command (e) specifies 
``stress 
analysis'' (but ``stress 
&lt;graphic&gt; &lt;/graphic&gt; 

  [Text]'' signifies a forward agreement search--the same 
holds 
true for the other keywords). Next, input command (ro) specifies 
``finite element method'' and (ha) specifies ``three 
dimensional,'' thereby completing a common class search. The 
results of this keyword search produce two data elements. (ni) 
is the command that outputs these data elements, with the output 
level being specified by the terms ``OUT1-OUT3.'' OUT1-OUT3 
correspond to the output level numerals 1-3 described earlier. 
That is, OUT 1 is the lowest level output command, and outputs 
only stored code items 1-4 shown in Table 2. Figure 4 specifies 
that lowest level of output. As indicated in Figure 4, this 
keyword search retrieved the two codes SAFE-3D and NIKE-3D, plus 
the functions, solution methods and other information related to 
these codes. By reading this information, the user can learn 
what functions, solution methods, etc. each of these codes 
possesses. And to learn whether or not this code information is 
registered with the Code Center, the user must have the system 
output item 18, ``Status in Japan'' as well. As explained in the 
beginning of this article, the Nuclear Data Center is the POC 
for Japan's Nuclear Code Center, and as such, users wishing to 
obtain information and/or documents pertaining to the codes they 
retrieve must contact us here at NDC. 
<H5>  Conclusions </H5>
  Four years have passed since NDC first started providing 
NUCIS services online. As of July 1993, these services were 
being provided to a total of 75 organizational users. 
  In line with progress in nuclear power research and 
development, increasingly higher level demands are being placed 
on nuclear power-related software. The human and 
financial-resources required to develop that software are 
therefore growing larger with each passing year. 
  For some time now, the development of nuclear-power-related 
software has been based on the premise of international 
cooperation. By each country sharing the software that it 
develops and uses with all other countries, the international 
community has endeavored to reduce the human and financial 
resources expended on the development of similar software 
programs. In order to do this, however, it is imperative that 
all nuclear power-capable countries provide and have access to 
information on nuclear power-related software developed by 
counterpart countries. 
  The NUCIS database was constructed with this in mind, and we 
at NPDC will undertake to improve our management and updating of 
this database, the promotion of its utilization and the 
retrieval system used to access it to even better meet users' 
needs in future. 
  For inquiries concerning application forms for utilizing 
NUCIS, please contact Fujitsu's F.I.P. Database Business 
Department at Tel: 03-3433-2251 or Fax: 03-3436-5254, and direct 
any inquiries you might have about the contents of this database 
to the Development Operations Department, NDC at Tel:

<H5>  1. Introduction </H5>
  Advanced technology has played a central role in bringing 
about the dramatic technological innovations witnessed in recent 
years. Technologies introduced into Japan from the United States 
and Europe clearly played a major role in Japan's economic 
development following World War II. Japan could never have 
attained its current level of prosperity without that 
technology. However, we are now being pressed to come up with 
ways of dealing with new issues such as technology-based 
frictions between the United States and Japan, and problems 
related to labor shortages, an aging society and environmental 
protection on a global scale. And to overcome these problems, it 
is vital that we not simply rely on the full mobilization of 
existing advanced technologies, but rather make technological 
breakthroughs, cultivate these new technologies and put them to 
the widest possible use. 
  In this vein, the database constructed under the auspices of 
the Social Applications of Nuclear Technology Accumulation 
(SANTA) project, called the SANTA database, provides technology 
information services aimed at transferring nuclear technology to 
the private sector. This database was put together and is 
maintained by the Japan Atomic Energy Research Institute 
(JAERI), and contains advanced technological information on that 
portion of the results of JAERI's overall nuclear research and 
development efforts considered most likely to benefit society as 
a whole, and particularly, that information on those advanced 
nuclear technologies that could be utilized or applied in 
non-nuclear power industrial fields. 
  Up until now, considerable technology developed by JAERI has 
been transferred to private firms operating in nuclear-related 
fields, but with the exception of radiation and RI technologies, 
very little of JAERI's advanced nuclear technologies have been 
put to use in non-nuclear power fields. But nuclear technologies 
comprise comprehensive science and technology systems that stand 
at the pinnacle of all science and technology fields, from the 
basic fields of physics and chemistry to electrical engineering, 
mechanical engineering and so on. And since nuclear technology 
is the systematic accumulation of many years of scientific and 
technological research, it can be put to use in a variety of 
different fields, and has value as a kind of quasi-public 
property that could not possibly be maintained by any individual 
private firm. 
  Based on this kind of thinking, JAERI felt compelled to 
promote the use by the private sector of technologies that it 
has produced, and as one means of achieving this, constructed 
the SANTA database and is using this database to make its 
technology information widely available online. JAERI 
commissioned the Nuclear Data Center (NDC) to develop the SANTA 
database, construction of which was completed at the end of 
fiscal year 1992. JAERI began providing SANTA database services 
in April 1993 as one of the menu selections available with 
G-Search, an integrated database service offered via Fujitsu's 
nationwide network FENICS. In addition to the SANTA database, 
G-Search also offers newspaper/news article information, and has 
been providing Nuclear Code Information Service (NUCIS) database 
services for some time now. At the behest of JAERI, the SANTA 
database is currently being operated and managed by NDC, but 
inquiries concerning the technology information contained 
therein and/or requests for detailed documents and other 
materials related to that database should be directed to JAERI's 
Planning Office. 
<H5>  2. Database Contents </H5>
  Before explaining the contents of the SANTA database, I 
would 
like to discuss JAERI's ``Technology Catalog'' and the sources 
of the information contained in the SANTA database. The 
``Technology Catalog'' was produced prior to the development and 
operation of the SANTA database, for use as both a PR 
publication designed to transfer advanced nuclear technology 
held by JAERI to the private sector and as a medium for 
introducing the various technologies available. This catalog is 
put together in an easy-to-understand fashion, and makes use of 
one A4 size page, complete with color graphics, for each and 
every technology introduced therein. Each such page contains the 
name of the technology, an approximately 400-word descriptive 
outline of the kind of technology it is and the special 
characteristics it possesses, plus anywhere from 2 to 5 
photographs, graphs and/or drawings that visually portray that 
technology (Figure 1 shows one of the pages that comprise the 
``Technology Catalog.''), and is compiled with other similarly 
configured pages to produce this technology-information catalog. 

<FIG ID=JPRS-JST-019L-21A>      Figure 1. A Sample Page from the ``Technology </FIG>


   JAERI first began gathering together the data for producing 
this catalog in November 1990. JAERI made its Planning Office 
the secretariat for the data collection effort, and this office 
solicited pertinent technological data from research institutes 
and then sorted and arranged the data it received. Naturally, 
the technology data collected in this way was not limited to 
just that information that would be incorporated into the 
catalog, but rather included numerous other bibliographic data 
as well. This additional information comprised rather detailed 
data elements that supplemented and explained the contents of 
the catalog, as well as codes selected from among a list of 
classification codes that had previously been assigned to the 
various technology application fields to make it easier to 
retrieve related data. The SANTA database was constructed by 
arranging data elements comprised of the data gathered from 
various research institutes for incorporation into JAERI's 
original ``Technology Catalog,'' the rather detailed 
supplementary data and the retrieval codes. In the future, JAERI 
plans to solicit registered data twice a year -- once every six 
months -- and use this newly solicited data to keep the SANTA 
database updated. 
  In addition to the titles, technology explanations and 
related graphics (drawings, graphs and photograph) titles and 
explanatory descriptions (photographs, drawings and other image 
data per se are not incorporated into the database) taken from 
the ``Technology Catalog'' discussed above, the data elements 
contained in the SANTA database consist of explanatory remarks 
that provide all-inclusive detailed explanations of the 
technologies, names of principal materials and devices, software 
titles, free terms, the existence of domestic patents and/or 
patent application numbers, the existence of foreign patents, 
the names of companies, universities and other related parties 
and their classifications for that technology developed jointly, 
plus the names and codes of JAERI divisions/departments/offices 
in charge of developing JAERI technologies, the names of the 
individuals in charge of that development, the year/month 
development was completed, and retrieval-facilitating codes 
specifying the technological fields, and old and new 
applications for the technologies. 
  As technology codes, the SANTA database uses International 
Patent Classification (IPC) codes, which are internationally 
unified classification codes for patent materials. As 
application codes, the database makes use of Koiki Patent 
Classification (KPC) codes (``Koiki'' is Japanese for ``wide 
area'' or ``broad range''). These KPC codes focus on 
high-interest themes, and are used to supplement the IPC codes. 
And as codes for specifying new application fields, topical 
technology themes coded into fixed keyword formats are used to 
specify new technology fields that are difficult to retrieve 
using patent classifications, such as optical IC's, 
microcomputers, etc. KPC and fixed keyword codes are both being 
used as retrieval words in the Patent Online Information System 
(PATOLIS) provided by the Japan Patent Information Organization 
(JAPIO). 
  In addition to the above items, the SANTA database also 
contains codes for services that JAERI can provide in order to 
transfer those technologies to the private sector, database 
management information known as ID numbers, and the date the 
data was registered and/or revised. 
  The principal technology fields covered by the SANTA 
database 
include nuclear fusion, radiation measurements/control, 
operation and management of accelerators and nuclear reactors, 
nuclear reactor fuel and materials, radiation applications, 
nuclear reactor safety and environmental safety. These 
technologies can be put to use in a diverse number of fields 
such as pharmaceuticals, chemicals/foodstuffs, aircraft/railway 
car/automobile parts, chemical plants/electronic 
equipment/vacuum equipment and environmental fields such as 
water processing and emissions control. The database currently 
contains roughly 50 data elements on technologies such as 
silicon carbide-based ultra heat resistant ceramic fibers, 
biodegradable polymers and high resolution quadrupole mass 
spectrometer. 
  The silicon carbide-based ultra heat resistant ceramic fiber 
discussed in Figure 1 above as a sample page of the Technology 
Catalog is a material with heat resistant and high strength 
functions produced as a result of research on radiation uses. 
The Research Development Corporation of Japan (JRDC) is 
continuing to test this technology and has plans for 
commercializing it in the near future. The next challenge for 
this technology will be to use the new fiber to develop a 
composite material of ceramic and a heat resistant alloy with 
enhanced heat resistant properties. If this can be achieved, 
then possible applications of this type of ultra heat resistant 
material are numerous, in everything from space planes and 
Japan's own space shuttle (HOPE) to nuclear fusion reactors, gas 
turbines for use in thermal power plants and jet engines. And 
once processing technologies are improved, this new material 
might also be applied to the construction of automobile engines, 
enabling the realization of ultra low fuel consumption 
automobiles, and thus contributing tremendously to protecting 
the global environment. 
<H5>  3. Retrieval Operations </H5>
  Retrieval operations for the SANTA database are menu driven, 
which means the user specified the type of data he wants to 
retrieve by selecting the appropriate retrieval item(s) from 
among a list of such items that is displayed on the menu screen 
and then selecting the output function to output the results of 
that retrieval operation. Two retrieval methods are available, 
one that uses free term searches and another that employs 
classification code searches. Free term searches enable the user 
to input words of his choosing to search through articles and 
indices contained in the database to retrieve data from six 
locations providing him with technology summaries, descriptions 
of Technology Catalog entries, graphics titles, principal 
devices names, principal material names and other keywords. 
Classification code searches are targeted at data elements 
stored as classification codes in database records, and require 
the user to input known codes and symbols to extract codes 
incorporating the matching data he is seeking and enable him to 
retrieve seven types of data including information on the 
existence of domestic (Japan) patents and technology codes, etc. 
  Classification code searches require that the user know the 
classification codes beforehand. These classification codes 
include retrieval system menu-driven codes for carrying out 
searches to determine the existence or non-existence of domestic 
patents, to search related categories and to search for data on 
service provision methods. And for users who are not familiar 
with the contents of codes used to search for JAERI 
organizational codes and technology field codes there is a code 
reference function included on the HELP menu. 
  The following is a typical example of a SANTA database free 
term retrieval operation that uses words taken from articles 
contained in the Technology Catalog to search out information on 
ceramic fibers. 
<H5>  (1) Retrieval System Inputs (Figure 2) </H5>
  [1] Input menu item 2, ``Search for keyword under `catalog 
entry descriptions''' from the search item and process selection 
screen. 
  [2] First, input the search word ``ceramics'' in full-size 
katakana in accordance with instructions given following the 
star symbol on the menu. 
  [3] Inputting ``ceramics'' will initiate the search, and the 
number 8 will be displayed at the bottom of the screen, 
indicating that there are a total of eight data elements related 
to ceramics contained in the database. 

<FIG ID=JPRS-JST-019L-22A>      Figure 2. Retrieval System Input Example </FIG>


<H5>  (2) Attaching Conditions to Searches (Figure 3) </H5>
  [1] Input 1 for ``Attach further conditions and search 
(AND).'' 
  [2] Input 2 once again for ``Search for keyword under 
`catalog entry descriptions'.'' 
  [3] When you input the search word ``fiber'' in kanji 
characters, the retrieval system searches for records related to 
both ``ceramics'' and ``fiber,'' and displays a ``1'' at the 
bottom of the screen, indicating that one data element was found. 

<FIG ID=JPRS-JST-019L-23A>      Figure 3. Retrieval System Input With Conditions </FIG>


<H5>   (3) Outputting the Full Text of the Technical Information </H5>
(Figure 4) 
  [1] The above operations have made it possible to retrieve 
technical information related to ``ceramics'' and ``fiber,'' and 
now it is time to output that information in full-text format. 
Using the same menu screen that was used to attach conditions, 
input ``P'' for ``Output search results.'' 
  [2] A menu will be displayed asking you whether you want to 
``Display title only'' or ``Display full text.'' At this time, 
input 2 for ``Display full text.'' 
  [3] The next menu screen will ask you to specify the level 
of 
the output. At this point, simply hit RETURN, and the full text 
of the record retrieved via the above operations will be output 
and displayed on the screen. 

<FIG ID=JPRS-JST-019L-24A>      Figure 4. Specifying Full Text Output </FIG>


<H5>  (4) Outputting Titles </H5>
  When you wish to output just the titles of the data you 
initially retrieved or of the data you retrieved after attaching 
conditions to your search operation, after inputting ``P'' for 
``Output search results,'' input 1 for ``Display titles only.'' 
Next, specify the desired output level. If you wish to output 
all the titles contained in the data you have retrieved, simply 
hit RETURN. This will display all the titles. 
<H5>  (5) Ending Retrieval Processing </H5>
  Pressing RETURN will return you to the output format 
selection menu screen. Next, input ``OFF'' to end database 
operations. This will return you to the previous screen, at 
which time you can continue to input ``E'' until you return to 
the G-Search top menu, or you can input ``T'' to return directly 
to the top menu. 
<H5>  (6) Using the HELP Function </H5>
  The HELP function comprises seven menu screens. Four of 
these 
menu screens function to display lists of codes which serve as 
references for the codes used in classification code retrieval 
operations, such as technology field classification codes. Other 
HELP functions include those for menu-driven retrieval methods, 
a function for explaining output methods, a function for 
displaying the process involved in retrieval operations and a 
function for deleting temporarily maintained search result data. 
All these functions can be used as required. 
  At present, SANTA database services do not include selective 
data provision services (SDI) nor services for distributing data 
via means other than online. However, for the time being, all 
costs related to utilizing SANTA database services are being 
born by JAERI. This means that users can avail themselves of 
SANTA database services, i.e. access and retrieve data, 
absolutely free of charge (but this does not include the charges 
for membership in the G-Search system). JAERI hopes that this 
will help promote the transfer of nuclear technology to the 
private sector by encouraging users to take advantage of SANTA 
database services. 
<H5>  4. Conclusions </H5>
  SANTA database online information provision services have 
really just gotten underway. Briefly put, the special 
characteristics of this database are the fact that it was 
clearly designed to provide technological information services 
aimed at transferring to the private sector JAERI-maintained 
advanced technology produced as the result of nuclear 
power-related research and development, and that it does so via 
simple, easy-to-use, small-scale retrieval operations that 
display full text data in Japanese, and all this free of charge 
to the user. 
  Two technical tasks remain for the SANTA database. These 
are: 
  1) equipping the database with the capabilities of storing 
and providing online image data such as photographs and graphs 
designed to make the technological information being provided 
easier to visualize and understand, and; 
  2) enabling the SANTA database to link up with an 
as-yet-unfinished JAERI patent information database in order to 
better explain the contents of foreign and domestic patents 
covering the technologies registered in the SANTA database. 
  However, even more important than tackling these tasks is 
the 
need to raise the recognition level of the SANTA database and 
get more users, both private individuals and corporate 
representatives, to utilize its services more often. And to 
accomplish this, it is vital to make the data contained in this 
database as complete as possible. That is, JAERI must promote 
its research and development efforts with renewed vigor so that 
more numerous technological data can be registered in the SANTA 
database, thereby making it a more complete database in terms of 
both quality and quantity. 
  The point of contact for inquiries related to G-Search is 
Fujitsu F.I.P. (Tel: 03-3433-2251), and for inquiries concerning 
the contents and/or utilization procedures for the SANTA 
database is the section in charge of promoting nuclear power 
technology applications, Planning Office, JAERI (Tel: 
03-3592-2102).

<F P=106> [Article by Kazuo Nakame, Tadayoshi Takeuchi, et al.] </F>
  [Text] The Nuclear Information Database/Communication 
System (NICS) is an online network system for nuclear power 
generation information operated by the Nuclear Information 
Center (NIC) of the Central Research Institute of the Electric 
Power Industry (CRIEPI). 
  NICS first commenced operation in 1984, and thereafter had 
both the types and volume of information it handled steadily 
increased and its functions expanded to keep pace. However, 
operability problems and the need to equip the system with the 
latest technologies resulted in its complete reconstruction, and 
NICS finally commenced full-scale operation in April of this 
year. In addition to making full use of artificial intelligence 
(AI) technology, the revised NICS features an integrated 
database and unified operations. 
<H5>  1. System Configuration </H5>
<H5>  1.1 Hardware Configuration </H5>
  Figure 1 shows NICS' hardware configuration. A mainframe 
computer here at the Center serves as the host computer, and can 
be accessed online via telecommunications lines from terminals 
installed at nuclear power plants and the main offices of 
Japanese power companies. 

<FIG ID=JPRS-JST-019L-25A>      Figure 1. NICS' Hardware Configuration </FIG>


  This host computer system is jointly utilized by users 
outside the Center, but the system's magnetic disk storage 
equipment, for reasons of security as well as maintenance and 
management, are dedicated devices. 
  In addition to electronic workstations (EWS), NICS terminal 
devices include printers for printing out textual data and 
facsimile machines for reproducing graphs and other image data. 
The telecommunications lines linking these terminal devices to 
the host computer comprise ordinary 2400 bps telephone lines as 
well as 9600 bps Integrated Services Digital Network (ISDN) 
lines (packet-switched telecommunications lines making up net 64 
of the Nippon Telegraph and Telephone Corporation's (NTT) 
Information Network System (INS)). As of July 1993, there were a 
total of 26 NICS terminal devices installed at nuclear power 
plants and the main offices of all electric power companies in 
Japan. 
<H5>  1.2 Database Configuration and Information Retrieval Systems </H5>
  Figure 2 shows the configuration of the NICS database. As 
seen in the figure, the NICS database is comprised of 
information retrieval systems and an analysis/evaluation system. 
These retrieval systems extract information from the database 
using terms and keywords designed for that purpose. Generally 
speaking, the information retrieved via these systems is 
unprocessed data stored in the database in the same format that 
it was input. The analysis/evaluation system makes use of 
operation/equipment/malfunction data to search for processed 
data such as equipment/parts malfunction ratios, etc. In this 
article, we will discuss the two new NICS database retrieval 
systems put into operation in April 1993, G-NICS and ANIKA. 

<FIG ID=JPRS-JST-019L-25B>      Figure 2. NICS Database Configuration </FIG>


  Figure 3 shows the contents of the NICS database targeted by 
these retrieval systems. The NICS database integrates eight 
kinds of databases containing information on such things as 
malfunctions at nuclear power plants inside and outside of 
Japan. The following are brief summaries of these various types 
of databases. 

<FIG ID=JPRS-JST-019L-25C>      Figure 3. Contents of NICS Database </FIG>


  Domestic Information: Four of the databases 
contained in the integrated NICS database contain domestic 
nuclear power-related information such as malfunction and other 
such trouble information reported by the government, domestic 
nuclear power facilities information and press releases put out 
by the various electric power companies. 
  Overseas Information: The four remaining databases 
integrated into the NICS database contain original language 
reports and summarized flash reports, plus translated versions 
of information from the Institute of Nuclear Power Operations 
(INPO). 
  The Center has a well-established system for collecting 
domestic information. Each of the power companies send 
information on malfunctions or other trouble, plus operational 
and maintenance data to the Center on a regular basis, as well 
as each time an incident of some sort occurs. When it comes to 
overseas information, the Center gathers that data from the INPO 
information network system via international telecommunications 
lines. And since the Center is also a member of the World 
Association of Nuclear Operators (WANO), it collects information 
from that organization as well. 
  Data input into the NICS integrated database is generally 
done by hand, but English-language files received from INPO are 
directly registered in the database via data collection 
terminals. 
<H5>  1.3 Information Advanced Application Functions (G-NICS) </H5>
  The G-NICS retrieval system uses ordinary retrieval methods 
to extract data via ``='', ``AND'' and ``OR'' operations. 
G-NICS' special characteristics are its ability, based on the 
integrated nature of the database, to unify screen operations 
and to make cross-section use of the various databases contained 
therein, and the fact that it possesses advanced diagram and 
table preparation functions. The mouse is the primary means of 
carrying out G-NICS retrieval operations, with keyboard input 
being held to the absolute minimum. And to relieve the burden on 
the host computer, G-NICS employs distributed processing 
functions that divide up some of the processing workload among 
terminals. 
<H5>  (1) Retrieval Functions </H5>
  G-NICS is capable of carrying out both ``keyword searches'' 
to retrieve data using keywords, and ``global searches'' to 
retrieve desired character strings from descriptive texts. And 
it is also equipped with a ``cross-section search'' function 
that makes it possible to search for information in more than 
one database at a time. For example, the cross-section search 
function can be used to retrieve the translated version of an 
overseas file from one database and the original data on which 
that translated version was based from another database via the 
same retrieval operation. Figure 4 provides examples of a 
keyword search formula and data output.

<H5>  (2) Original Data Output Functions </H5>
  Retrieved information is displayed on the terminal screen as 
well as output to terminal printers and facsimile machines. This 
information can be output in either full text format or in the 
form of selected items only. 
<H5>  (3) Classified Total Function </H5>
  G-NICS can use keywords to prepare classified total tables 
based on vital data such as domestic malfunction/trouble reports 
and translated versions of information received from overseas. 
Then, based on this classified total table, this retrieval 
system can prepare graphs and/or look at the original 
information contained in the table. 
<H5>  (4) Predefined Document Function </H5>
  G-NICS uses previously calculated classified totals to 
compile documents on domestic malfunction/trouble information, 
and can display these as-is on the terminal screens, display the 
information in graph form or output it to a printer for print 
out. 
<H5>  1.4 New Technology Application Retrieval Functions (ANIKA) </H5>
  The ANIKA retrieval system makes full use of AI technology 
to 
simplify retrieval operations so that users can input 
instructions in natural language. The user simply uses the 
keyboard to input his inquiries in everyday conversational-type 
phrases, and ANIKA decodes these phrases, automatically prepares 
the required search formulas and extracts the desired data from 
the database. Therefore, the ANIKA retrieval system puts AI 
technology to work primarily in preparing the intended search 
formulas based on analyses of the structure and semantics of the 
conversational phrases input by users. This means that anyone 
with a little knowledge of nuclear terminology can readily use 
ANIKA to retrieve data from the NICS integrated database. And to 
give the ANIKA retrieval system a ``personality'' to fit the 
image of an outstanding information management librarian, the 
developers of ANIKA gave considerable thought to the 
psychological aspects of human-database interaction and equipped 
the system with very ``soft'' and ``friendly'' greeting and 
response statements designed to impart a sense of ``charm'' to 
the otherwise dry, dull task of database retrieval. 
  ANIKA is equipped with search and original data output 
functions, and is targeted at four of the eight NICS databases 
discussed earlier, to include those containing domestic 
malfunction/trouble information and translated versions of 
overseas information. And ANIKA can both display retrieved data 
on terminal screens as well as output it to facsimile machines. 
Figure 5 provides an example of an ANIKA retrieval operation. 

<FIG ID=JPRS-JST-019L-27A>      Figure 5. Example of ANIKA Retrieval Operation </FIG>


  Right now, the NICS database system is using G-NICS as its 
primary retrieval system, with ANIKA playing a supporting role, 
so to speak. However, as ANIKA's sentence structure analysis 
capabilities improve and its vocabulary increases, it is 
expected to become even easier to use in future. 
<H5>  2. Assignment of Keywords </H5>
  The types of NICS data most often used by the electric power 
companies are domestic malfunction/trouble information and 
translated versions of overseas information. When it comes to 
translating information received from abroad, the Center screens 
all those English-language files received from INPO and has full 
translations done of those files deemed important. 
  The Center has also formed a review committee that discusses 
this information, and, based on those discussions, assigns 
keywords to dozens of data elements. Assigning keywords to 
information like this greatly increases the value added of the 
original data, and, in addition to enhancing retrieval accuracy, 
also enables the system to carry out various types of classified 
total operations. 
  As for that information that is not assigned keywords by the 
review committee, the system either assigns to the various data 
keywords identifiable with each particular data element's 
attributes, or automatically extracts and transcribes keywords 
from descriptive items contained in the original information. 
<H5>  3. State of Operation/Utilization </H5>
  The Center was founded as an information center for the 
electric power business, and therefore access to the NICS 
database is limited to electric power companies only. 
  The hours of operation for the NICS database are from 8:00 
AM 
to 12:00 midnight on weekdays, and from 10:00 AM to 6:00 PM on 
weekends. Operation is normally only halted on holidays, and the 
one day each month set aside for database registration. However, 
the NICS system is equipped with emergency start-up capabilities 
to deal with emergencies that occur on down days, and an 
emergency contact system is in place. 
  As for the recent state of utilization, G-NICS is being used 
by all terminals combined an average of 130 or so times per 
month, while ANIKA is being utilized to retrieve NICS data 
between 20-60 times a month. 
<H5>  Conclusions </H5>
  Twenty some years have already passed since the first 
nuclear 
power plant commenced commercial operations here in Japan, and 
the volume and types of information related to the operation, 
troubles and maintenance of these plants has grown to enormous 
proportions. It is extremely important that we put this 
experiential data to effective use now and in the future to help 
ensure safe, reliable operation of nuclear power plants and the 
conduct of regular inspections with an eye toward economizing. 
  NICS has been supporting the operation of Japan's nuclear 
power plants by accumulating data and using computers to make 
high-level use of that data for almost 10 years now, and we 
believe that our efforts have contributed in some small way to 
preventing the reoccurrence of accidents and troubles of a 
similar nature. 
  Everyday we strive to extract nuclear power generation data 
more rapidly and accurately, and to incorporate the latest 
technological advances into NICS, and if this article has 
managed to communicate even a fraction of that effort to the 
reader, then we will be very pleased. 
  In closing, we would like to take this opportunity to thank 
Mr. N. Konishi (presently with the Japan Nuclear Fuel Co.) and 
Mr. K. Sato (presently with the TechnoService Co.) for their 
guidance in the development of these retrieval systems.

  [Text] The construction of a materials database is 
essential in order to efficiently develop and select nuclear 
materials for use under irradiation and in environments ranging 
from high temperatures to extremely cold temperatures, as well 
as in a variety of corrosive environments. 
  Therefore, based on the results of one of the Science and 
Technology Agency's projects aimed at researching basic nuclear 
materials, construction commenced in fiscal 1990 on a 
distributed materials database called the ``Data Freeway'' that 
would be capable of being mutually utilized by all participating 
research organs. Basic nuclear materials research is being 
carried out by large numbers of research organs, each 
specializing in a particular branch or field of this research. 
For this reason, the Data Freeway will serve as a network system 
interconnecting various databases constructed by individual 
research organs and enabling all participating nuclear materials 
research organs to make mutual use of these databases taking the 
proprietary rights and timeliness of results and advanced 
specialization into consideration. The development of the Data 
Freeway system is the joint responsibility of the National 
Research Institute for Metals (NRIM), the Japan Atomic Energy 
Research Institute (JAERI) and the Power Reactor and Nuclear 
Fuel Development Corporation (PNC), who are striving to 
construct the fundamental portions of this system by fiscal 
1994.[.sup]1-3)[/] Once completed, this system should 
efficiently promote nuclear materials selection and materials 
development. 
<H5>  1. Current State of the Data Freeway </H5>
<H5>  1.1 System Configuration </H5>
  In order to achieve maximum system performance, and to 
ensure 
smooth operability and sufficient compatibility, NRIM, JAERI and 
PNC all opted for the same hardware and software. The hardware 
used by each of the research organs consists of Unix-based 
electronic workstations (EWS), two gigabytes or more of storage 
capacity, hard disks, and communications control equipment. And 
the various research organs are interconnected with one another 
via a network comprised of Nippon Telegraph and Telephone (NTT) 
Corporations 9,600 bps DDX-P and/or net 64 public telephone 
lines. They are using the TCP/IP communications protocol. 
  Software being used includes a relational database 
management 
system (RDBMS) called ORACLE, programs for processing images and 
displaying image data and programs for processing diagram 
preparation operations, and the programming languages C and 
Fortran, which can support science and technology calculation 
libraries (ASL). In addition to networks and databases, the Data 
Freeway system is also steadily being outfitted with 
data-manipulating scientific environments. 
  The Data Freeway network links together the research organs 
shown in Figure 1. By the end of fiscal 1993, users should be 
able to access the data they require from NRIM, JAERI, PNC, the 
National Research Lab of Metrology (NRLM), the Ship Research 
Institute (SRI) and the Japan Information Center of Science and 
Technology (JICST) without consciously being aware of where 
(which of these organizations) the data is actually coming from. 

<FIG ID=JPRS-JST-019L-29A>      Figure 1. Data Freeway Network </FIG>


<H5>  1.2 System Functions </H5>
  Figure 2 provides an overview of the functions being built 
into the Data Freeway system. The system features functions for 
retrieving data from the database, applications software for 
processing data, electronic mail/bulletin boards and even a 
function that explains in summary form how the system works. To 
access these various functions, all the user has to do is click 
a button. The operation screens feature pull-down menus operated 
by clicking the button on an electronic mouse input device; 
keyboard input is held to the absolute minimum. This makes the 
Data Freeway system so easy to operate that even a novice can 
use it with no problems. 

<FIG ID=JPRS-JST-019L-29B>      Figure 2. System Overview </FIG>


<H5>  1.3 Database Overview </H5>
  The Data Freeway database has been developed so that the 
data 
structure can rationally describe the irradiation, high 
temperature and environmental parameters peculiar to nuclear 
materials, beginning with the manufacturing process, chemical 
composition, basic materials and mechanical properties for Fe-Ni 
alloy or ceramic materials. As shown in Figure 3, the database 
possesses a three-tiered structure, comprising six table 
categories, including raw materials, specimen processing, test 
conditions and test results, roughly 60 types of data tables, 
including raw material data, manufacturing methods, testing 
devices and test atmosphere, and approximately 800 data 
elements, included among which are the name of the raw materials 
manufacturers, irradiation dose, corrosion volume and impact 
values. 

<FIG ID=JPRS-JST-019L-30A>      Figure 3. Database Structure </FIG>


  The smallest unit or element in the basic data set is a 
single specimen. That is, data is stored in the database so that 
a user can search backward from the results of testing a single 
specimen to find out about raw materials, manufacturing methods 
and test methods. Therefore, when abnormalities turn up in 
retrieved data, the user can check the chemical composition of 
the raw materials, the manufacturing history and test methods, 
etc. that produced the abnormal test results, determine the 
cause(s) of the abnormality and then decide whether or not to 
use the data. The Data Freeway database is also capable of 
handling structural photographs in the form of image data. 
<H5>  1.4 Data Retrieval </H5>
  Data retrieval is carried out in accordance with the 
operational flow indicated in Figure 2 above. The user makes use 
of a multi-window display to pull down menus from the various 
windows and select the functions he wants to use, then 
implements these functions with the simple click of a button on 
the mouse. 
  The mechanism used to retrieve required data from the 
databases maintained by NRIM, JAERI and PNC is described below. 
First, a sub-window is displayed outlining the data elements 
necessary to retrieve data on materials by speciality field, and 
the user selects from this sub-window the field he requires. 
Next, the Data Freeway system automatically checks to determine 
which of the three research organs maintains data related to the 
specified field, and connects the network up with that 
organizations database system. To perform this check, the Data 
Freeway system queries its data table address management file 
which specifies the address of that data. The system must 
therefore add to its address management tables for each 
participating research organ the names of tables containing data 
newly added to those respective organs' databases. And when the 
system doesn't connect up to the organ maintaining the specified 
data, it displays a message to that effect. 
  The following method is employed to retrieve data using the 
data retrieval operation screen. Ordinarily, a structured query 
language (SQL) has to be used to retrieve data stored in a 
relational database. However, novices can not use an SQL without 
prior knowledge of the database system. This is because SQL 
retrieval operations require the user to specify the particular 
database tables and data elements in which the desired data is 
stored, and to execute instructions that describe one-by-one the 
search conditions. And to do this, the user has to be familiar 
with the names of the tables and data elements that comprise the 
database, as well as with the descriptive syntax used to define 
search conditions. The developers of the Data Freeway system 
therefore put together an operation screen capable of 
automatically executing SQL. They also added a function to the 
system that would enable the user to change the units of 
retrieved data to data units of his liking. 
  Figure 4 (not reproduced) shows the retrieval screen and 
search results display screen displayed with a data retrieval 
operation carried out using this operation screen. These screens 
are examples of a retrieval operation that sought the results 
(presence or absence of rupture, test load, time to rupture, 
reduction in area, etc.) of creep tests conducted at 
temperatures in excess of 1,000ÎC on materials containing 
the character string ``Inco'' in their name. The search results 
display screen is equipped with functions for maintaining those 
results in a file for processing and print out. 
  As explained above, the Data Freeway system makes it easy 
for 
users to retrieve and analyze information they need. And the 
operation screen, operation instructions screen, etc. are in 
both Japanese and English to enable foreigners to use the system 
as well. 
<H5>  1.5 Data Contents </H5>
  Table 1 shows the types and amounts of data currently stored 
in the Data Freeway system. The system presently contains a 
total of 6,600 data sets, the combined total of information in 
NRIM, JAERI and PNC databases. The contents of the Data Freeway 
relational database system are scheduled to be expanded to 
include data on numerous new types of materials such as 
ceramic-metal compounds, slope function materials and functional 
structure materials.[.sup]3)[/]

<H5>  2. Examples of Results of Inter-organizational Cooperation </H5>
  NRIM, JAERI and PNC are pushing ahead with the development 
of 
the Data Freeway system for their mutual utilization. As a means 
of reviewing methods of mutual utilization, the developers took 
up as a sample problem helium embrittlement in type 316 steel. 
Type 316 steel is used in the fuel cladding pipes of high-speed 
breeder reactors and in the blanket structural material of 
nuclear fusion reactors, but since the helium generated as a 
result of neutron irradiation is closely linked with void 
swelling and embrittlement in type 316 steel, users must 
determine its material degradation behavior. NRIM, JAERI and PNC 
therefore brought together their respective data on the high 
temperature tensile and creep characteristics of type 316 steel 
to see what advantages could be gained by this type of 
inter-organizational cooperation.[.sup]1)[/] 
<H5>  2.1 Data Integration </H5>
  Figure 5 provides an example of the data brought together by 
NRIM, JAERI and PNC, showing the total elongation data at 
various temperatures held by each organization on irradiated 
type 316 steel, and the results of integrating that data. The 
data held by NRIM shows the total elongation of type 316 steel 
hypothetically for use as blanket structural material for a 
fusion reactor following experiments in which it was irradiated 
with helium ions at relatively high temperatures. JAERI's data 
shows the results of similar tests at a wide range of 
temperatures. And PNC's data focuses primarily on the total 
elongation of type 316 steel at temperatures ranging between 
700-800K in line with its targeting of high-speed breeder 
reactors. Integrating all three organizations' data produced the 
graph labeled ``Irradiated Material'' in the bottom right corner 
of Figure 5. 

<FIG ID=JPRS-JST-019L-31A>      Figure 5. Broad Range of Material Characteristics Revealed </FIG>

  By integrating their respective data in this way, the three 
Data Freeway developers were able to determine the elongation 
temperature dependency of type 316 steel across a broad range of 
temperatures extending from room temperature to 1,000K. And they 
also learned that whereas the lowest value indicated for 
elongation temperature dependency in non-irradiated materials 
was around 700K, that for irradiated material exhibited an 
unvaried decline in proportion to increases in test 
temperatures. Therefore, integration of the respective research 
organizations' data made it possible to grasp a broad range of 
material characteristics. 
<H5>  2.2 Using Analysis Tools </H5>
  The Data Freeway system offers a variety of applications 
programs to enable more useful analysis of data retrieved from 
the databases that make up this system. And the developers are 
outfitting the system so that users can execute these 
applications programs at the click of a mouse button. For 
example, the system makes available programs for preparing 
diagrams, processing images, estimating the volume of helium 
generated during neutron irradiation and the induced 
radioactivity in various types of reactors. These tools are used 
to complement and grasp the overall image of the data 
retrieved.[.sup]1-3)[/] 
<H5>  3. Future Plans </H5>
<H5>  3.1 Facilitation of Data Input </H5>
  In constructing databases, using the minimum amount of labor 
to store data of the highest reliability is always a problem. 
JAERI has therefore taken the lead in promoting the development 
of a data input support system. The design concept calls for an 
input support system that will make it possible to input the 
data contained in the reports of material test results prepared 
by researchers at the same time they are writing them. That is, 
the data input support system will create a corresponding 
relationship between data to be stored and the data elements in 
the database, and then guide data input in line with data entry 
procedures. This will require the construction of common 
databases that contain synonyms, units and material standards. 
In line with this, the Data Freeway developers are planning to 
promote data collection for common databases. 
<H5>  3.2 Network Expansion </H5>
  The Data Freeway system uses a telecommunication network to 
make possible the automatic retrieval of required data from 
among that data stored in participating research organizations' 
databases. Participating research organs will naturally strive 
to increase the amounts of data contained in their respective 
databases and to perfect the tools used to analyze this data. 
However, it will also be essential to expand the network 
interconnecting participating research organs and to increase 
the number of organizations participating in the system. 
<H5>  4. Conclusions </H5>
  In order to expand the Data Freeway system and enhance the 
databases available therein, the operators of this system will 
have to ensure data reliability, maintain an abundance of data, 
expand utilization and deal adequately with users' needs. The 
development of the Data Freeway system should be promoted 
bearing these points constantly in mind. We are looking forward 
to the further enhancement and growth of the Data Freeway in 
line with its scheduled expansion in fiscal 1993 to include 
NRLM, SRI and JICST. And once the development of the Data 
Freeway is complete, we can also expect to see the ripple effect 
expand the areas of expertise covered therein beyond the realm 
of nuclear materials alone to include other energy fields, 
outerspace development, and the manufacturing and information 
industries. We intend to continue to promote the development of 
the Data Freeway in future to make it a widely used common asset 
capable of contributing to the efforts of researchers in fields 
other than nuclear energy as well.

<F P=106> [Article by Tetsuro Kon and Takashi Shimada] </F>
  [Text] Thirty odd years have passed since Japan first 
commenced developing its nuclear power capabilities, and the 
Japan Power Demonstration Reactor (JPDR) operated by the Japan 
Atomic Energy Research Institute (JAERI) is already in the 
process of being decommissioned, and the PWR steam generators on 
commercial reactors are coming up for replacement. 
  A wide variety of information must be collected and analyzed 
and a broad range of expertise is required when working up 
decommissioning plans and undertaking decommissioning projects. 
For this reason, there has been a need to establish a 
decommissioning database system that gathers together, analyzes 
and systematically sorts decommissioning-related information 
obtained from domestic and overseas open-source documents, 
international cooperative efforts and overseas studies. 
  In response to this need, the Research Association for 
Nuclear Facilities Decommissioning (RANDEC), in addition to 
having been commissioned by the Science and Technology Agency 
(STA) to construct a personal computer-based ``General-purpose 
Obsolescence Information Database System,'' is also developing a 
personal computer-based ``Materials Management Database System 
for the Decommissioning of the Nuclear-powered Vessel `Mutsu','' 
for JAERI, and a ``Nuclear Fuel Facilities Dismantling Database 
System'' for the Power Reactor and Nuclear Fuel Development 
Corporation (PNC). RANDEC is also pushing forward with the 
development of its own ``Multimedia Database System (RAIDA)'' 
that will be capable of being applied to numerous other fields 
as well. 
  This article is designed to provide an overview of the 
``General-purpose Obsolescence Information Database System'' 
that RANDEC is developing at the behest of STA, as well as 
RANDEC's own ``RAIDA System'' currently under development. 
<H5>  1. General-purpose Obsolescence Information Database System </H5>
  As shown in Figure 1, the General-purpose Obsolescence 
Information Database System is actually comprised of three 
sub-databases: a bibliographic information database, a general 
information database and a technical information database. 

<FIG ID=JPRS-JST-019L-32A>      Figure 1. Configuration of the General-purpose </FIG>


<H5>  1.1 Special Characteristics of Each Database </H5>
<H5>  (1) Bibliographic Information Database </H5>
  Comprehensive science and technology-related databases are 
already being operated by INIS, JICST and others, but these 
users have to retrieve needed information from voluminous data 
registered in mainframe computers, and these retrieval 
operations require a good deal of experience and knowhow. 
  To provide users with an attractive option, one capable of 
being much more user friendly, this bibliographic database has 
been equipped with the following special features: 
  [1] It stores bibliographic data dealing exclusively with 
the 
field of nuclear facilities obsolescence; 
  [2] It contains a broad range of information, including 
information presented verbally at meetings of scientific 
societies, associations, etc. and made public at international 
conferences; 
  [3] It makes use of a list of codes that classify obsolete 
equipment as to technology field, facilities, theme and target 
country to make it possible to draw associations between the 
bibliographic data collected in the database and to more rapidly 
retrieve that data. 
  The major classifications used to define obsolete equipment 
technology fields are general decommissioning technology, 
systems engineering, decontamination, dismantlement, remote 
operations, reutilization, measures to deal with dismantled 
waste, safety management and inventory evaluation. A specific 
example of these classifications, to include a few intermediate 
classifications, is provided in Table 1.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 


<H5>  (2) General Information Database </H5>
  The General Information Database is designed primarily for 
use in planning and PA, and classifies and sorts information 
collected from various documents and materials into [1] 
government policies/regulations, [2] organizations, [3] 
projects, [4] international conferences, [5] research reactors, 
[6] commercial reactors, [7] nuclear fuel cycles, [8] waste, [9] 
patents and [10] others. This database stores both textual and 
image data. 
<H5>  (3) Technical Information Database </H5>
  The Technical Information Database is made up of a 
``Qualitative Technical Information Database'' and a 
``Quantitative Technical Information Database.'' 
<H5>  [1] Qualitative Technical Information Database </H5>
  The Qualitative Technical Information Database is designed 
to 
enable the collection of general technical information related 
to obsolete equipment. Data stored in this database consists of 
qualitatively sorted technical information related to obsolete 
equipment (systems engineering, decontamination, dismantlement, 
remote operation, reutilization, dismantled waste measures, 
safety management and inventory evaluation data), and provides 
users with summaries, special features, performance, scope and 
achievement data related to obsolescence technologies. 
<H5>  [2] Quantitative Technical Information Database </H5>
  The Quantitative Technical Information Database is designed 
to sort and store quantitative information required for 
evaluating appropriate technologies for application to obsolete 
equipment, and can be used as a dismantlement systems 
engineering database. This database provides users with 
quantitative information on dismantling time schedules, numbers 
of workers and processes, radiation dosage, generated waste 
volume and costs. 
<H5>  1.2 Database Size </H5>
  At present, there are roughly 10,000 data elements of 
bibliographic information related to obsolete equipment stored 
in the Atomic Energy Database operated by the International 
Atomic Energy Association (IAEA), another roughly 12,000 such 
data elements available via the INIS database and an additional 
2,000 such data elements stored in the Japan Information Center 
for Science and Technology (JICST) database. The General-purpose 
Obsolescence Information Database System is expected to contain 
roughly 20,000 bibliographic data elements, comprising the most 
useful information from existing databases plus similar such 
information expected to be generated in future, as well as 
approximately 3,000 general information data elements and about 
1,000 technical information data elements. 
<H5>  1.3 System Configuration </H5>
  After conducting comprehensive evaluations of database size, 
ease of system development, ease of maintenance and operation, 
information provision methods (online services, etc.) and 
development costs, it was decided that this database system 
would be built around a personal computer. 
  Each of the databases comprising this system feature roughly 
the same overall system configurations and functions, and share 
the same classification codes. And database operations have been 
simplified thanks to interactive input systems that employ 
pull-down menus. Figure 2 shows the overall system configuration 
for the Bibliographic Information Database, and Figure 3 shows 
its functional configuration. 

<FIG ID=JPRS-JST-019L-34A>      Figure 2. Overall Configuration of the Bibliographic </FIG>


<FIG ID=JPRS-JST-019L-34B>      Figure 3. Functional Configuration of the Bibliographic </FIG>



  Arago dBXL, an off-the-shelf database software was selected 
as the software for the General-purpose Obsolescence Information 
Database System, and application programs are being prepared. 
Arago dBXL is compatible with dBASE IV, possesses image 
data-handling functions and it has a compiled run module that is 
license free. It also features multi-system support functions, 
which enable it to run on PC-98, IBM, J3100 and FMR personal 
computers. 
  Figure 4 shows the system's principal retrieval functions 
and 
the retrieval flow. When conducting item search operations, the 
user can focus his search by specifying multiple items, such as 
the above-described classification items (specifying the 
classification code from pop-up menus using a mouse) and data 
numbers, titles (character search) and authors (character 
search) as search conditions. Free term searches are also 
possible.

obtained from the Qualitative Technical Information Database.

<H5>  1.4 Management System </H5>
  This database system is not that large, and its users will 
most likely be limited to parties directly involved in 
decommissioning operations. Studies are therefore currently 
aimed at initially providing data in the form of photomagnetic 
(magneto-optical (MO)) disks or floppy disks. 
<H5>  1.5 Development Schedule </H5>
  Development of the Bibliographic Information Database got 
under way in fiscal 1990, followed by work on the General 
Information Database and Qualitative Technical Information 
Database, all of which are still under development. Detailed 
design work on the Quantitative Technical Information Database 
is about to commence. These various database systems will be 
made available to the public one at a time in the future. 
<H5>  2. RAIDA System Development </H5>
  At the office, bibliographic data and black-and-white image 
data are managed using electronic file servers. But since color 
image data, such as photographs, albums, videotapes and the 
color drawings and diagrams attached to reports of research 
results cannot currently be handled by these file servers, 
personal computer-based data management systems are coming into 
demand. 
  At RANDEC, therefore, as part of our work aimed at 
developing 
a ``Dismantlement Material Control System,'' which is a 
constituent part of dismantlement systems engineering, we are in 
the process of developing the RANDEC Image Database (RAIDA) 
system, which will feature a library function for rapid 
retrieval of these types of color image data, and a presentation 
function for storing images, including video images, complete 
with narrations. 
<H5>  2.1 Past Problems and Solutions to Constructing Image </H5>
Databases 
  The personal computers and applications software used in 
conventional databases have been limited to processing textual 
information, and this has created numerous problems in 
constructing image databases. These problems are outlined in 
Table 4. However, the recent appearance of multimedia personal 
computers and related software has dispelled these problems and 
made it possible to easily and inexpensively construct database 
systems capable of handling both still and moving images, 
complete with narrations.

<H5>  2.2 System Overview </H5>
  The RAIDA system comprises two systems: RAIDA-98, which 
utilizes an NEC PC-98 PC equipped with a full-color board, video 
board and voice board (made by Knobbs (phonetic)), and 
RAIDA-MAC, which makes use of an Apple high-speed desktop Quadra 
equipped with a video board. 
  Table 5 shows the main functions, principal configuration 
equipment, database software and special features of the two 
component systems of the RAIDA system. Figure 5 provides a 
configuration diagram of the RAIDA-MAC system.

<FIG ID=JPRS-JST-019L-39B>      Figure 5. Block Diagram of Entire RAIDA-MAC System </FIG>


  These systems take data in directly from the video cameras 
and video tape recorders, create moving picture data (RAIDA-MAC) 
or still picture data (RAIDA-98), and register this data in 
their respective databases. Users can use the database retrieval 
functions to have the data they want to see displayed rapidly on 
the PC monitor screen. With moving picture data, the narration 
starts automatically as soon as the video/movie is displayed on 
the screen. 
  The narration-supported image displayed on the CRT can be 
simultaneously displayed on large-sized home TV sets with either 
system, a capability that makes for convincing presentations 
that have a strong impact on the viewer. 
  Ordinary video libraries take time to search out and display 
the desired video presentation, and from the standpoint of 
costs, cannot be updated all that frequently. However, with the 
RAIDA system, not only can desired data be retrieved quickly, 
but replacing old information with the latest image data can be 
carried out easily, inexpensively, and therefore frequently. And 
when moving picture data is created, new video titles can be 
made in-house without ordering them from outside parties. 
<H5>  2.3 Uses </H5>
  Since the RAIDA system is a multimedia database that fuses 
together moving picture and voice data, it is capable of 
presentations that overflow with realism. 
  For example, this system can display the atmosphere of work 
sites inside access-restricted cells, thereby allowing people 
normally denied access to that site to get a real feel for the 
atmosphere of that site. And parts replacement operations that 
are difficult to understand from verbal or textual explanations 
alone can be quickly understood and carried out without a hitch 
by referring to full-color image data retrieved from this system 
and displayed on the CRT screen. 
  Some other specific areas where the RAIDA system is expected 
to find application are: 
  [1] For presentations of the results of research and 
development work and records of construction projects; 
  [2] For PA presentations; 
  [3] For training manuals for plant operations and 
maintenance 
(collections of moving picture data focusing on those aspects 
requiring specific knowhow); 
  [4] For safety manuals; and 
  [5] For government orientation presentations (related to 
approvals and licenses). 
<H5>  2.4 Future Tasks </H5>
  RANDEC will strive to enhance the operability of the 
RAIDA-98 
system in future, and enable it to handle Arago-Windows database 
software. As for the RAIDA-MAC system, however, there is not 
that much development work left to do since the off-the-shelf 
software capable of running on this system is already so 
complete that RANDEC can enhance system functions simply by 
selecting the appropriate software from among the numerous 
packages available. When it comes to displaying moving pictures 
on a big screen, as it stands now, these systems require the 
addition of dynamic image compression/extension boards that 
display more than 30 frames per second in order to produce a 
smooth moving picture display. RANDEC is looking forward to the 
commercialization of an inexpensive compression/extension board. 
  In future, we can expect to see the integration of these 
RAIDA systems with materials and worker management database 
systems for structures slated for dismantling. 
<H5>  Conclusions </H5>
  RANDEC would like to complete development and testing of the 
General-purpose Obsolescence Information Database System, open 
it to the public and commence formal operations as soon as 
possible. And in future, in addition to collecting new data and 
perfecting the data registered in this system even further, it 
hopes to expand its functions to include full-color data 
capabilities, and will strive to fine tune its database 
management system and integrate it with other, related databases. 
  The RAIDA systems are the latest in multimedia database 
systems, and feature technologies that can be put to use in a 
wide range of applications in addition to the field of nuclear 
power PA. RANDEC would like to further develop these systems in 
future by equipping them with new multimedia technologies and 
expanding their functions.

<F P=106> [Article by Omar Berbiche: "Political Asylum in Germany: </F>
11,000 Applications From Algerian Citizens"--first two 
paragraphs are EL WATAN introduction] 
  [Text] "Germany's position concerning the situation in 
Algeria remains unchanged: our country supports neither the 
fundamentalists nor the terrorists." 
  This was the reaction of a German official (who wishes to 
remain anonymous) to the inspection of the weapons loaded on 
board the Algerian ship El Djorf, a case whose ramifications are 
said to reach all the way to Germany. 
  According to the communique issued by security departments, 
FIS [Islamic Salvation Front] leaders residing in Germany, in 
particular Djamel Lounici who was named by the above-mentioned 
sailor, are implicated in this arms deal. For the German 
official, the existence of "the German connection" mentioned in 
the Algerian press is a rumor without foundation. He sees it as 
another manifestation of the will to damage Algerian-German 
relations, which has become the special goal of some Algerian 
newspapers. 
  The accusation is too serious to be ignored, our source 
estimated. The German side already asked Algerian authorities to 
provide details of the case, we learned from reliable sources, 
to enable it to identify Germany's responsibilities and, if the 
accusations are founded, to decide on the measures to be taken 
under the law. "Let the Algerian Government give us names, with 
evidence showing that Algerian citizens residing in Germany are 
closely or remotely involved in gun running, and we shall make 
it our own business," they said. 
  For this German official, it is clear that "my country will 
tolerate no criminal act on its soil." The federal government's 
position, he said, is clear: "no support for international 
terrorism, no matter what its color is." 
  The same official estimates that, although his country's 
position with respect to the events that trouble Algeria may 
seem paradoxical, the explanation is quite simple: Algerian 
official circles resent the German judiciary's refusal to 
extradite Rabah Kebir. 
  This, he said, was a decision of the German judiciary, which 
is sovereign, and it has nothing to do with the government's 
position on fundamentalism which, he indicated, is totally 
unambiguous. 
  The file submitted by the Algerian judiciary to the German 
judiciary, he explained, did not contain any evidence warranting 
Kebir's extradition. Even if such evidence existed, it is said, 
Kebir could never be extradited to Algeria, but to another 
country of his choice, because German law does not allow the 
extradition of an individual sentenced to death in his own 
country. 
  "I can understand that this position is not always as well 
understood in Algeria as would be desirable, that it may have 
serious political consequences, but there is nothing we can do 
about it; that is the price we pay for the independence of our 
judiciary," he observed. For him, the latest decision 
prohibiting Rabah Kebir from engaging in political activities 
while on German soil reflects the government's concern to see 
Algeria return to peace and stability. Kebir's application for 
political asylum is still under consideration. 
<H5>  Eleven Thousand Applications From Algerian Citizens </H5>
  Processing the file may take months, even years, we were 
told. Kebir's is not an isolated case: last year, the German 
departments in charge of asylum applications received some 
11,000 applications from Algerian citizens claiming to be FIS 
members and persecuted in Algeria. Nearly 10,000 applications 
were processed last year, and only about 50 were approved, we 
were told by a reliable source. In most cases, we were told, the 
rejected applications come from individuals viewed as economic 
refugees rather than individuals persecuted for their political 
opinions. The applications are studied one by one. But it so 
happens that most applicants who are denied asylum do not leave 
German soil and simply vanish into the crowd where, as illegal 
aliens, they evade any government control. Many of them soon 
find a trick to legalize their situation: they marry, or they 
provide a medical file. 
  Sometimes warm, sometimes troubled, relations between 
Algeria 
and Germany never managed to achieve the measure of stability 
that both sides want but that events prevent. Nevertheless, we 
were told, the federal government clearly supports Algeria's 
efforts, as it just repeated at the opening of negotiations with 
the IMF "to find an acceptable solution to the crisis."

<F P=106> [Article by Sofiane Bensalem: "One of Kasdi Merbah's </F>
Assassins, Toufik Hattab, Was Killed Yesterday in 
Benzerga"--first paragraph is EL WATAN introduction] 
  [Text] One of the leaders of the terrorist group operating 
in the Ain-Taya/Bordj-El-Bahri area, Toufik Hattab, was killed 
yesterday on a road near Benzerga, we learned from reliable 
sources. He was one of the assassins of Kasdi Merbah, president 
of the MAJD [Algerian Movement for Justice and Development], and 
Mustapha Abada, the former ENTV director. 
  Around 1500, a national police patrol was driving past a 
spot 
were peddlers are in the habit of setting up their stalls. 
  Suddenly, the police vehicles were sprayed with bullets. A 
group of 20 armed men, with Toufik Hattab at their head, had 
been hiding among the peddlers, waiting for the patrol. The 
counterattack was fierce. 
  Three policemen were killed on the spot. Several citizens 
were seriously wounded. During the chase that started after the 
encounter, Toufik Hattab was killed. His accomplices fled in 
stolen cars. A submachine gun was recovered. According to our 
sources, the weapon belonged to a policeman murdered in March 
1992 at Beni-Amrane. 
  Toufik Hattab, 31, was one of the closest associates of 
Abdelkader Hattab, also known as Mouloud, 46, a terrorist leader 
operating in the Boumerdes area. 
  On several occasions, the Algiers Special Court issued a 
warrant for his arrest. Toufik trained in guerrilla warfare in 
Afghanistan for three years. Early in October 1993, after the 
preliminary investigation, the security departments discovered 
that the Hattab group (there are three of them belonging to the 
same family) was behind the murder of Kasdi Merbah, former prime 
minister and MAJD president, on 21 August 1993. 
  Thirty-six persons were arrested. Mazaei Tayeb, technician; 
Aissa Rachid, imam; and Boukersi Djamel, unemployed; were 
questioned and brought before the court. They were charged with 
supporting the Hattab group's activities. 
  The other three members of this hard core are Berriah Lyes, 
Tarzout Said, also known as Tolier, and Aissani Ahmed Abdelkader 
(nicknamed Youcef). Assuredly, the elimination of this dangerous 
leader is a serious blow to the local terrorist network.

<F P=106> [Article by Rachid Drif: "GIA (Armed Islamic Group), The </F>
First Circle"] 
  [Text] The name Si-Ahmed Mourad, alias 
"Djaafer El Afghani," appears for the first time in the airport 
case indictment. But he was not convicted in absentia, nor was 
he on the list of 57 accused alongside Hocine Abderrahim. 
  On 26 August 1992, at 0900, two men in a red Renault 4 left 
Bouzareah heading for Houari Boumediene airport. They had just 
been to the domicile of Fenouh Karim, who gave them a sack 
containing a voluminous package. At the wheels of the vehicle 
was one Boulesbaa Youcef, a veteran of Mustapha Bouyali's MIA 
[Armed Islamic Movement] sought by police in the mid-1980's and 
later amnestied along with Chebouti, Meliani, the Baa brothers, 
Hattab, Moghni. 
  Accompanying Boulesbaa was a certain Djaafar el Afghani, 
whose mission was to deposit the sack provided by Fenouh in the 
airport concourse. A very powerful bomb that was to detonate at 
1100. Boulesbaa's job was to telephone airport officials and 
warn them to have the waiting area evacuated. 
  At the trial of the Abderrahim group, the 
indictment--prepared from the interrogations conducted by police 
and intelligence services, the depositions having been turned 
over to the magistrate handling the case--contained two 
different versions of the facts. 
  First, the confessions of Said Soussene and Meliani 
Mansouri, 
arrested before the 26 August attack; second, those of the group 
subsequently arrested. 
  The indictment also includes, besides the interrogation 
reports, two essential documents: a synthesis that includes the 
organization table of the MIA and names the principal leaders of 
the terrorist cells; and a concluding section that relates the 
facts, identifies who was responsible for which crimes in the 
airport affair, and describes the composition of the armed 
groups of Chebouti's Islamic movement. 
  In the synthesis, it is noted that in addition to the MIA, 
four large groups were active in the Algiers area: the crisis 
unit responsible for "continuing the political activities of the 
Islamic front," headed by Redjam, Cherrati, and Said; the "ala 
al ahd bakoune" (faithful to the oath) movement of Selmane 
Abassi; and finally two very dangerous groups specializing in 
asassination of prominent personalities and agents of the 
security forces: one headed by Allal Mohamed, alias "Leveilley", 
the other led by Djaafar el Afghani. 
  The first document identifies the man who placed the bomb as 
being Zouaoui Djaafar, alias "El-Afghani," who attended one of 
the first preparatory meetings for the 26 August attack at the 
home of Boulesbaa in El-Mohammadia, near El-Harrach. Besides 
Boulesbaa, there were the two Hocine brothers, Abderrahim and 
Ahmed. However, Zouaoui was not among those indicted, nor was he 
called as a witness before the special court, nor did his name 
appear in the list of accomplices in hiding. To this day, his 
name does not even appear on the list of 22,000 activists being 
sought by the security forces.... 
  The second document, the conclusion of the indictment 
supported by a reconstruction of the facts, identifies this same 
Djaafar el Afghani who planted the explosive device at Dar 
El-Beida as being Si-Ahmed Mourad, a friend of airport ground 
mechanic Mechrouk Mohamed, who advised the Abderrahim group. 
  Mechrouk was not prosecuted either, and doubtless has fled. 
Hocine Abderrahim has used confusion engendered by the 
indictment to sow seeds of doubt. The judge made efforts 
throughout the trial to establish the identity of Zouaoui 
Djaafar "el Afghan" and his relationship to members of the group. 
  Abderrahim, who knew that Si-Ahmed alias Zouaoui and Djaafar 
El Afghani had not been properly identified--the pseudonym 
Zouaoui confused the trail--went so far as to bluff the judge by 
asserting that Djaafar El Afghani was an imaginary personage 
whom he had invented while being tortured. 
  Soussene Said, arrested on 18 August, about a week before 
the 
attack, testified he had met Si-Ahmed Zikioui Brahim, an 
important member of the Leveilley group, at the latter's home in 
Baraki. Soussene admitted to his companions that he was the 
instigator of the bomb attacks against ENTV and the police 
security office for the wilaya of Algiers. It was at that 
meeting that Si-Ahmed proposed planting a bomb in the control 
tower of Boumediene International Airport. 
<H5>  Armed Islamic Group </H5>
  Al Jamaa al islamia al moussalaha, GIA [Armed Islamic 
Group], 
born after the uprising of June 1991, was the creation of 
Mansouri Meliani, a former Bouyali henchman sentenced to death 
by the state security court, then amnestied by the regime under 
pressure from Islamists and the FIS [Islamic Salvation Front]. 
  Meliani was born in December 1944 in Khemis El Khechna--he 
would have been 50 this year--into a modest family of the 
region. He lived--before the era of the first MIA--in a small 
dwelling in the Bougara development at Sidi-Moussa. On being 
released, he made contact with FIS militants and officials. In 
early 1991, he was given lodgings by Zermane Omar at Amroussa, 
in Mitidja. Omar, a construction materials merchant, is a 
habitual criminal well-known to the police. He was part of Allal 
Mohamed's very first group and prepared hide-outs in the region 
for them. It was he who built Allal's main hide-out at Harraza 
on land purchased by the latter from proceeds of several 
hold-ups committed in metropolitan Algiers. Meliani, who had no 
resources, received gifts from Islamists in Algiers: Islamic 
Front militants gave him lots of money, as did Nahnah. Salah 
Assad offered him land at Soumaa. 
  After the June disturbances, Meliani decided to create his 
own armed group, modeled on the MIA of the 1980s. He called it 
the GIA, and its governing body was a select Majlis Echoura 
[advisory council] with himself as emir. The council consisted 
of six persons: Kaouane Hacene, the "chaabi" singer; Bourahli 
Saadane, Meliani's brother-in-law; Nacer El Eulmi, brother of 
the founder of the SIT [Islamic Labor Syndicate]; Lahrani Sid 
Ahmed, a notorious terrorist with close ties to Allal; the imam 
of Ouled Yaiche; and a certain Abderrahmane of Benzerga. 
  The group mounted several operations, including the 
"admiralty" attack, but was rapidly dismantled after Meliani was 
arrested in July 1992 in El-Achour, Bouyali's old fiefdom. The 
same month Zermane was arrested, along with El Hani, a funds 
collector and agent of Allal, and Hamadache, mufti of the 
Mitidja group. They gave away the entire composition of the 
band, while Meliani played straight with the authorities and 
reconstructed his network of contacts for investigators. 
  When Allal was killed in September of the same year, the 
security services quickly deduced that Layada Abdelhaq would 
become leader of the band's survivors. In six months, 29 very 
dangerous members of the network were arrested or killed. Layada 
was "coordinating" several very different cells, but above all 
he was quite close to Allal. After several months of total 
silence, communiques were published in the newspaper EL HAYAT in 
which Layada, writing under the pseudonym of Abou Adlane, 
claimed to be leading several armed groups that henceforth would 
form the GIA. In June 1993 he was arrested in Morocco and 
extradited to Algiers in greatest secrecy. Actually, 
investigators wanted to exploit to the maximum the information 
he provided before publicly announcing his arrival in Algiers. 
<H5>  Third Generation </H5>
  The Armed Islamic Group pursued a sanguinary strategy in 
1993. After bomb attacks, murders of security officers, and 
attacks on patrols and barracks, even civilians were targeted, 
especially after the marches against violence and terrorism. 
Intellectuals and journalists were targeted. Si Mourad, alias 
Djaafar El Afghani, once again figured in police reports, and 
information about him was collected when lesser terrorists were 
nabbed. 
  Initial conclusions of investigators: He is a very important 
figure, and cross-checking indicates he instigated the failed 
attack on Khaled Nezzar. His name keeps popping up in connection 
with headline-news events such as the attack on Boughzoul 
barracks; it is linked with a subject named Hammana, arrested 
and later released in 1992, and with Sayah Attia, 38, the son of 
a harki [Algerian who served with French forces during the war 
for liberation] and a cold-blooded killer in his own right; and 
with Tamesguida, where 12 Croats were slaughtered in cold blood. 
A new element appears in the modus operandi: GIA terrorists have 
begun killing with knives: They slit their victims' throats, 
decapitate them, and mutilate the bodies.... 
  Soon, there were other new targets: foreigners. Si Ahmed 
masterminded the abduction of three French consular agents, then 
had aid cooperators and residents of various nationalities 
"executed." Industrialists and small merchants were victimized 
with increasing frequency, and there was little the security 
services could do about it. 
  With the passing of Meliani and Layada from the scene, GIA's 
leadership has passed to a third "generation." Djaafar 
El-Afghani's group specializes in kidnapping-murders--as for 
instance in the case of Cheikh Bouslimani, who was found buried 
with his throat slit, next to an officer who had been kidnapped 
and decapitated. And there have been dozens more civilians. On 
Saturday, the hard core of the GIA was brought down--certainly, 
too, what the specialists call the "first circle": leaders of 
cells, very active members. What remains, according to this 
theory of the counterterrorism struggle, are the second and 
third circles: the thugs and killers, as well as the support 
groups that shelter the terrorists, provide information, and 
collect funds before being promoted and starting a new cell. 
  Djaafar's progress is a case in point. At age 28--he was 
born 
in January 1964--he was a small-time operative of the MIA. 
Eighteen months later, this young musician born in Kouba and 
raised in Tablat had become the leader of one of Algiers's most 
murderous gangs.

  [Text] Notwithstanding Anwar Haddam's indignation, whether 
feigned or real, at the death of Djaafar El-Afghani, divergences 
between the GIA [Armed Islamic Group] and FIS [Islamic Salvation 
Front] remain undiminished. 
  Armed Islamic Movement [MIA], Armed Islamic Group. The death 
on Saturday of Sid Ahmed Mourad (alias Djaafar El-Afghani, alias 
Seif Allah), in a spectacular operation mounted by government 
security forces has revived enmities between the two militant 
Islamist organizations. It also poses once again the problem of 
the congeries of armed Islamist groups and their relations with 
each other and the FIS. Given the paucity of information 
available on the subject, it is extremely difficult to 
characterize these relations. Thus far the only light shed on 
the murky subject of the armed Islamist groups was furnished by 
the trial of those responsible for the terrorist attack on 
Algiers airport; everything else is conjecture. It was through 
the trial, for example, that we learned that [armed] groups had 
already formed and were prepared to go into action long before 
the interruption of the January 1992 legislative elections. 
  The attacks on the border station at Guemmar in November 
1991, and against Blida in spring 1990, are proof of that. 
  One of the groups ready for armed action was Tekfir Oua 
El-Hidjra ("Redemption and Exile" [i.e., declare infidel and 
withdraw]), led at the time by Ahmed Bouamra ("Ahmed the 
Pakistani") and Nourredine Seddiki. Composed mainly of 
"Afghans," the group had declared the Islamist parties "impious" 
on grounds that voting was against the Shari'ah [Islamic law]. 
  The group was rapidly dismantled by security forces after 
Seddiki's death in April 1992. Bouamra has vanished into thin 
air, and people have quit talking about him. The second group 
was led by Allel Mohamed, alias Moh Leveilley, a young 
Hussein-Dey merchant and cabaret habitue who joined the FIS when 
it was riding high. He formed his group during the FIS 
insurrection of June 1991, joining forces with Ben Mekhebi Fethi 
(alias Abou Doujana), Nourredine Bouferra, Ben Tebbiche, and 
Abdelhak Layada, his successor. 
  The third group ready for armed action was led by Mansouri 
Meliani, who was tried for the airport attack, sentenced to 
death, and executed last August. 
  By his own admission to the Special Court of Algiers, he had 
established his "Djamaat Islamiya Moussalaha" (Armed Islamic 
Groups) about the same time as Moh Leveilley. The decision was 
taken, he explained, when security forces tried to restore the 
motto "By the people and for the people" to the facades of the 
APCs [People's Communal Assemblies] in place of the Islamist 
motto the FIS had substituted. The restoration, it will be 
recalled, resulted in some nasty confrontations between security 
forces and Islamist militants. 
  Meliani said it was these confrontations that had prompted 
him to action, not the arrest of the FIS directorate, whom he 
accuses of "compromising with the regime." 
  Meliani then made contact with Sid Ahmed Lahrani, imam of El 
Feth de Bab El-Oued mosque, who was killed in March 1993 at 
El-Biar; Abdel Nasser Leulmi, a teacher at the CEM [College of 
Intermediate Studies] of Bordj El-Bahri, killed in September 
1992; Si Ahmed Mourad (Djaafar El-Afghani); a certain Abdelhalim 
of Benzerga; and the imam Cheikh Nacer from Ouled Yaich. Meliani 
explained that in order to avoid the mistakes committed by 
Mustapha Bouyali, precursor of the armed struggle, he opted to 
recruit his people first and weapons later. He organized his 
movement by naming three coordinators: Lahrani (Center), 
Si-Ahmed Mourad (East), and Leulmi (West). The group won 
notoriety in February 1992 with the attack on the naval repair 
station near the Admiralty in Algiers, an attack that left seven 
soldiers, a policeman, and two attackers dead. 
  The groups headed by Bouamra, Allel, and Meliani are unique 
in that in addition to being independent of each other they have 
also managed to avoid being controlled by the FIS. 
  That was not the case with the Armed Islamic Movement (MIA) 
led by Chebouti, or the Haraket addawla al islamiya (HDI) led by 
Said Mekhloufi, who were close to the Islamist party. When the 
leaders of that movement--notably Mohamed Said and Abdelrezak 
Redjam--escaped the clutches of the law and opted for armed 
struggle, they realized they count not count on Said Mekhloufi 
or Omar Eulmi (founder of the SIT [Islamic Labor Syndicate] and 
brother of Abdel Nasser, who was killed in April 1993) to unify 
all the groups. So they picked Abdelkader Chebouti, whose past 
actions had made him rather a legend in his own time. Chebouti 
let himself be convinced. Mekhloufi and the Eulmi brothers did 
not oppose him. Hocine Abderrahim, principal instigator of the 
airport attack, later sentenced to death and executed, and 
Bennouis and Guitli, two long-time Bouyali confederates who 
later joined the FIS, also supported the decision. But Meliani 
and Allel balked. 
  An initial effort at unification was made in April 1992, at 
a 
meeting held in Zbarbar. The meeting was hosted by a group 
active in the Bouira region headed by a certain Hocine 
Moutadjer. In addition to the latter, the meeting was attended 
by Chebouti, Meliani, Mekhloufi, Omar Eulmi, Abderrahim, 
Abdelkader Bennouis, and Guitli; Allel Mohamed did not attend. 
The meeting created a formal structure for the armed movement: 
Chebouti was made national emir, Meliani national coordinator, 
Mekhloufi director of military affairs, Eulmi the mufti, and 
Moutadjer and a certain "Bouratili" treasurers. Guitli and 
Bennouis were put in charge of the political and information 
commission, and Abderrahim was made coordinator of the Algiers 
region, with Said Soussene (later sentenced to death and 
executed) and Djamel Ressaf (now a fugitive, recently expelled 
from France) as his deputies; Kamr Eddine Kherbane (now a member 
of the FIS executive body in exile) was chosen in absentia to 
handle external affairs. But two days after the meeting, Mehani 
went back on his promises and withdrew (as he put it) his 
allegiance to Chebouti. 
  On the ground, in terms of operations, Allel's group has 
been 
responsible for the most bloodshed. He was assisted by Soussene, 
who participated in an ambush in which five policemen were 
killed in July 1992 at Boudouaou. His arrest led to the 
dismantling of Allel's group, 10 of whom were killed at their 
hide-out in Baba Hassen in August 1992. Before that operation, 
the security forces had struck another spectacular blow on 27 
July 1992 with the arrest of Mansouri Meliani. These two events 
shifted the balance of power, and Chebouti was once again in the 
strongest position. Moreover, he had just received word of fresh 
support from Ali Benhadj, who said in a "fetwa" smuggled out of 
prison that if he were released he would place himself at 
Chebouti's orders. The meeting at Tamezguida on 31 August 1992 
was supposed to consecrate his ascendancy. Allel Mohamed, 
weakened by the loss of 10 members of his group, agreed to come 
to Tamezguida accompanied by two of his deputies, Abdelhak 
Layada (now in prison) and Nourredine Bouferra. But the meeting 
was aborted due to a security sweep of the area that resulted in 
the death of Allel and his deputy Bouferra. The meeting could 
not be held, and Layada took Allel's place. The apprehension of 
the latter, who was suspected of giving certain names to the 
authorities--notably Si-Ahmed Lakraoui and Yekhlef Cherrati 
(arrested at his El-Harrach hide-out in February 1993)--opened 
the way for Djaafar El-Afghani, who apparently inherited all the 
survivors from El-Hidjra Oua El-Tekfir (whose philosophy he also 
appropriated), the Allel group, and the Meliani group, which had 
picked him, as noted previously, to be eastern coordinator of 
the Djamaate Islamiya Moussalaha. The preeminent role of Djaafar 
El-Afghani was also confirmed by Layada himself in an interview 
with the daily EL MOUDJAHID last October, during the hearing 
before the magistrate of the Special Court of Algiers. Layada 
also said in the interview that he had headed a group of 600 men 
in various locations around the country. 
  The relations between Layada and the FIS are rather 
tumultuous--especially with the children of Abassi Madani and 
with Rabah Kebir, whom Layada accuses of having diverted 
millions of dollars he claims were earmarked for the armed 
groups. His "mufti," Omar Leulmi, in a cassette circulated 
clandestinely, rejected all the pretensions of exiled FIS 
leaders to speak for Islamists, going so far as to threaten them 
with death. 
  The death of Omar Leulmi, followed several weeks later by 
Layada's arrest, seems not to have altered relations between the 
latter's successor and the FIS. Proof came with the 
assassination of former prime minister Kasdi Merbah, an act for 
which GIA claimed responsibility while the FIS blamed it on the 
security forces. It was thanks to this assassination that the 
GIA came to dominate the political and media scene. 
Subsequently, the GIA was to claim the 24 October 1993 abduction 
of three French consular agents and the assassination of Mohamed 
Bouslimani, who apparently had refused to issue a "fetwa" 
endorsing the murders committed by the organization. The deadly 
attacks against foreigners that have taken 21 lives since 1 
December are attributed to GIA, which had presented one of the 
three French consular agents an ultimatum giving foreigners a 
month to leave Algeria on pain of death. The ultimatum indicated 
that there would be no more "warnings or abductions" and that it 
would be "more violent than in Egypt." 
  The deadline was scrupulously observed, and two days after 
its expiry a Spaniard was slain on the road between Khemis 
Miliana and Berrouaghia. The most recent victim of this series 
of killings that has taken 21 lives is Joaquim Grau, 
assassinated in his bookstore on Rue Didouche Mourad on 22 
February. 
  Before the deadline expired, two French surveyors, three 
Latin American technicians, and two Soviet training officers had 
been assassinated at Sidi Bel-Abbes, Tiaret, and Laghouat, 
respectively. The murder of the two French surveyors was 
officially attributed to a group called "Unified Companies of 
the Jihad" headed by a former "Afghan," Kada Benchiha, 
apparently affiliated with the GIA. A different group that seems 
to be wreaking havoc in the Titteri and Ouarsenis regions is 
headed by another "Afghan," Sayeh Attia, famous as the author of 
the murder of 12 Croats last December as well as the ambush that 
cost the life of the wali of Tissemsilt and his companion. Since 
Si Ahmed Mourad, Kada Benchiha, and Sayeh Attia all three saw 
action in Afghanistan, it is quite likely they are all members 
of the same organization. There is also a striking similarity in 
their methods of execution: slitting their victims' throats and 
atrociously mutilating the bodies. Politically, GIA has 
distinguished itself by its mistrust of all Islamist leaders who 
want a dialogue with the authorities, threatening them with "the 
worst of deaths" and affirming, in two successive communiques, 
that "the mujahidin are in command." When Anwar Haddam and Rabah 
Kebir for the first time condemned assassinations of 
intellectuals, the GIA replied by warning its supporters against 
"djamaate who have been seduced by media celebrity and the lure 
of power" and "forgotten the oath of unity in the ranks of the 
mujahidin." Rejecting contacts between the regime and the FIS as 
"maneuvers designed to stop the jihad," the GIA communique 
accused Said Mekhloufi of being an undercover agent of Algerian 
security and claimed his goal was to foment an implosion in the 
ranks of the mujahidin. The GIA claims to have thwarted the plot 
and executed 70 infiltrators. It promises the same fate to their 
"chief," Said Mekhloufi. The FIS has reciprocated the accusation 
of working with the security services. "GIA does not belong to 
the FIS. I find that this movement has sometimes claimed credit 
for curious things, such as the murder of Kasdi Merbah, which 
everyone knows was the work of the regime," says Kamr Eddine 
Kherbane, who as noted above is a member of the FIS executive 
body overseas, and was given responsibility for the movement's 
"external affairs" at the April 1992 meeting in Zbarbar. 
  In an interview last December with the French weekly NOUVEL 
OBSERVATEUR, Kherbane, a former air force officer who served as 
chief of security for the FIS, announced the birth of the 
Islamic Army of Salvation (AIS), which he considers "the only 
armed branch of the FIS." According to Kherbane, the AIS now 
includes Chebouti's MIA and Said Mekhloufi's HDI. 
  In a situation in which responsibility for attacks is seldom 
claimed, it is difficult to establish how much of the activity 
is this organization's doing. But observers agree in saying it 
is strongest in the mountains of Bouzegza, Zbarbar, and the 
Jijelian region. 
  However that may be, the frictions between AIS and GIA are 
so 
acute that analysts concluded--overhastily and ineptly--that the 
death of Djaafar El-Afghani resulted from an informer's tip 
triggered by these divergences. 
  This sparked a quite virulent reaction from Anwar Haddam, 
who 
several weeks ago called for an end to the terrorist attacks. 
According to Mr. Haddam, the death of Djaafar El-Afghani--whom 
he described as the "mujahid commander"--was an "assassination" 
that imperils dialogue between the regime and the FIS. "Dialogue 
would be pointless if the regime perseveres in the liquidation 
of innocents," he says in a communique reported by AFP. 
  Haddam's statement may only reflect panic at the prospect of 
possible GIA reprisals to avenge its leaders. But whatever it 
represents, it has done nothing to attenuate dissensions between 
the GIA and the FIS. And there is no doubt that if the latter 
agreed publicly to give evidence against Djaafar El-Afghani's 
organization, its power to do ill would diminish, since it would 
then be constrained to act openly. Unless Haddam's reaction was 
just the prelude to a rapprochement meant to strengthen his hand 
in talks with the regime. Although there is no basis as yet for 
predicting what position the dissolved Islamist movement will 
take toward the GIA, it is safe to say it is not going to break 
with Chebouti's organization. If negotiations between the regime 
and the FIS continue, the fate of Chebouti and his confederates 
will have to be discussed. Thus the head of the MIA, already the 
recipient of Chadli Bendjedid's favor, would have an excellent 
chance of escaping further criminal prosecution. But here we 
cross the line into political fiction.

<F P=106> [Article signed K.D.: "Port of Algiers: Unbearably </F>
Congested"--first paragraph is EL WATAN introduction] 
  [Text] The authorities heard the alarm signal set off some 
time ago, concerning the congestion of the Algiers quays. The 
prime minister, accompanied by the transport minister, made a 
point of inspecting the port of Algiers in person, during a 
surprise visit yesterday. 
  During his tour, Mr. Redha Malek was informed by EPAL 
[Algiers port authority] officials of the degree of completion 
of the container terminal construction project, of the port 
development strategy and, of course, of the considerable delays 
in unloading and delivering goods. 
  At present, 140,000 tons of goods are stored on the quays 
and 
in the hangars, waiting for their owners to come and get them. 
This excessive use of storage areas, therefore, considerably 
hampers the port traffic, even though all maritime activities 
are directly affected by the recession. 
  For instance, 30,000 tons of lumber and iron, most of which 
were imported by Metalsider, Cosider and Enab, are awaiting 
delivery. 
  In addition, 3,800 containers containing household 
appliances, agricultural, chemical, and food products, and 
vehicles are awaiting an improbable delivery. 
  This situation is due to the dilapidated state of the 
handling and processing facilities. The port of Algiers has 
about 80 cranes, much more than half of which are broken down. 
  Forklifts are not doing any better; most of them do not 
work. 
The congestion at the port is also due to the small depth of 
casting off stations. 
  Since the port has not been dredged for many years, the 
average water depth has decreased from 11 to 6 meters. 
High-draft ships must sometimes wait until a dock of suitable 
size becomes free. 
  Actually, ship traffic decreased by 4.63 percent in 1993. 
During that year, 473 ships docked at Algiers, compared with 496 
the year before. 
  Paradoxically, the EPAL is doing better, financially, under 
these crisis conditions. 
  Its net results showed a 19.1-percent increase. 
  But this performance is the result of increases in port 
tariffs. In other words, the port authority still must solve a 
major problem: that of congestion. The government is expected to 
take measures to do just that.

<F P=106> [Article by Sofiane Bensalem: "Schools and Public Buildings: </F>
Upsurge in Sabotage"--first two paragraphs are EL WATAN 
introduction] 
  [Text] The first half of the month of Ramadan was 
particularly bloody. At a time when Algerians aspired to "return 
to a state of calm" in a period of devotion favorable to 
meditation and solidarity, terrorism showed its claws. With rare 
ferocity. 
  We even had the impression that the armed groups, cornered 
and losing ground among the population, threw all their forces 
into the battle this month. 
  Result: an unbelievable increase in attacks and 
assassinations, especially in the Algiers area, and therefore an 
ever longer victims list, in spite of the vigilance and fighting 
spirit of the police, who remain mobilized to prevent the worst 
from happening. 
  Therefore, there were deaths, many deaths during these first 
two weeks of Ramadan, but also many acts of economic and 
cultural sabotage. In fact, simultaneously with the 
assassinations that they commit with a violence and an atrocity 
that are beyond all understanding, the fundamentalists were out 
to destroy public enterprises and schools by setting them on 
fire. 
  The security departments indicated that, during the last 48 
hours only, several companies and schools were destroyed by 
terrorists. In the Blida area, four schools, the seat of an APC 
[People's Communal Assembly], and that of a state-owned 
asphalting company were set on fire. 
  In the Tipaza governorate, the rolling enclosure of a 
state-owned company, a school, and a telephone distributing 
frame were also destroyed through arson. At Relizane and 
throughout Algeria, we can see the same devastation, the 
"scorched earth" which, by force of circumstances, has become 
the terrorists' macabre signature. From another source, we 
learned that about 20 schools were destroyed since the beginning 
of the year, while 100 or so teachers were killed by terrorists, 
often under particularly atrocious conditions. 
  The toll is already heavy. Citizens no longer know where to 
turn, as they are subjected daily to a veritable terror 
psychosis. What can they do in such an atmosphere? This question 
is on everyone's mind as we face a very dangerous upsurge in 
fundamentalist activism, which obviously intends to gain ground 
in order to prevent democratic society from expressing itself. 
  It is through fear and systematic destruction that the 
fundamentalists challenge the new government. That is also the 
proof that their arguments do not carry much weight compared 
with the social and economic realities of Algeria, which 
essentially rejects criminals.

<F P=106> [Commentary by Cherif Ouazani: "Disturbing Political </F>
Vacuum"; first paragraph is EL WATAN introduction] 
  [Text] The absence of the parties from the national 
conference was abundantly commented on by observers, but their 
absence from everyday life in the real world goes unnoticed. Is 
the unending need to obtain authorization from the governorate 
for any meeting the reason why the political class is shrinking 
to nothing more than the parties' administrative staffs? 
  The regime is granting itself a grace period that everyone 
is 
refusing to give it, and the government is remaining quiet while 
Algerian society is being shaken by a deafening silence. Does 
that sound bite, addressed by Youcef Khatib to the leadership of 
the FLN [National Liberation Front] with the assertion that it 
is afraid of the terrorists, apply to the entire political 
class? We do not wish to make that class out to be more 
diabolical than it is, but the question is unavoidable when one 
notes the disappearance of all party activity at the 
rank-and-file level--in those parties that even have a rank and 
file. Party offices in the country's interior remain hopelessly 
closed, and in the eyes of the citizens, the only political 
debate is the bloody confrontation between the security forces 
and armed groups. Some parties use the argument that it is 
difficult to obtain authorization from the governorate and are 
calling for an end to the state of emergency, thus minimizing 
the seriousness of the security situation, while paradoxically 
deploring the absence of the state. The state, besieged on all 
sides, makes a pretense of being present through its police 
forces, its DEC [expansion not given] agents who do what they 
can with what they are given when they do not get shot like 
rabbits, and officials who do not lose sight of the fact that 
they are first and foremost servants of that state. 
  But the state is also a very quiet government in the face of 
the almost exclusive presence in the field of terrorists who 
exchange civilities with speculators who have never lost their 
money or their sense of direction. The armed groups have not 
granted the new government a grace period, but it seems to be 
taking one anyway. 
  Zeroual has not yet met with his former colleagues for a 
Council of Ministers meeting, and government activity is 
shrinking steadily away. 
  The president of the state (certainly an incorrect 
translation of chief of state, but we are still the only 
republic where "chief of state" is not the same as "president of 
the republic") reportedly arrives at his office early to work on 
the dossiers, but it cannot be said that those dossiers are 
completely unfamiliar to him, so why does he give the impression 
of being mute in response to the new upsurge of feelings of 
insecurity among Algerians? 
  Is it because he is completely absorbed in reorganizing the 
office of the president's staff? Or is it the problem of 
providing this government with a base of popular support? If so, 
this is the time to reoccupy the terrain that seems to have been 
abandoned by the political parties as well and reconquer areas 
that have been left for too long in the hands of populism and 
demagoguery. 
  Because except for the dissolved FIS [Islamic Salvation 
Front], which still holds those citadels through certain mosques 
that have evaded control by the "nidhara," and the FFS 
[Socialist Forces Front], which maintains a quite active 
internal political life by regularly sponsoring debates between 
its Executive Committee and its rank and file, the rest of the 
political class is active more through press communiques or 
interviews than through political activity in the field. 
  The strength of the FLN, for example, lies less in its 
mobilization capability than in the means at its disposal for 
paralyzing important sectors of the economy with the aid of men 
who have survived in the major decisionmaking centers despite 
the earthquakes of the past. 
  The Islamists in HAMAS [National Society for Guidance and 
Reform] and al-Nahdah are continuing to fish for members among 
the FIS rank and file even though they, too, are not active in 
the field. 
  The fact that Nahnah and Djaballah agree today in calling 
for 
a shortening of the transitional period, something on which they 
reached agreement during the successive phases of dialogue, is 
more a matter of strategy than of tactics--in other words, they 
will always agree even though they follow different paths (and 
voices). 
  The RCD [Rally for Culture and Democracy], traumatized by 
the 
assassination of its national secretary, Rachid Tighziri, has 
sunk into painful silence. 
  Added to its bereavement are the intrigues surrounding the 
claims to represent culture and identity that have the MCB 
[Berber Cultural Movement] as their focus. 
  That has the disadvantage of unnecessarily stirring up a 
rank 
and file whose understanding of the political nuances between 
two groups claiming the same acronym is diminishing steadily. 
  Ettahaddi [offshoot of the Socialist Vanguard Party] is 
still 
the first to express its stand on current events, but it appears 
that the fierce attacks on that party's members by the armed 
groups have caused it to return to near-underground status, thus 
preventing it from engaging in open political activity. 
  As for the other parties, their credibility with the 
media--because it cannot decently be said that they have 
credibility with the public--is in proportion to the charisma of 
their individual leaders. 
  Meanwhile, the citizen, faced with the government's silence 
and the absence of the parties, will have to contend with 
speculators using the only weapon at his disposal: refusal to 
buy. As for his willingness to mobilize against terrorism, that 
is a subject for a separate debate.

<F P=106> [Article by Foued Allani: "Social Development: Marked </F>
Retreat of Poverty"--first paragraph is LA PRESSE DE TUNISIE 
introduction] 
  [Text] 

  -  In 1990, 6.7 percent of Tunisians were considered poor, 
compared with 33 percent in 1967. 
  -  From 1987 to 1991, total State assistance amounted to 
12,140,000 dinars[D], i.e., 18 percent of the gross domestic 
product. 
  -  101,000 families were covered by the National Program 
of Aid to Needy Families [PNAFN], receiving on the average D250 
per year per family in 1992, i.e., 178 percent more than in 1987. 
  Poverty has "retreated markedly in Tunisia." This is what 
Mr. 
Abdellatif Ben Kilani, director at the Ministry of Social 
Affairs, stated at the national seminar on food and nutrition 
policy planning recently organized in Tunis by the Ministry of 
Agriculture, with the collaboration of the Ministry of Health 
and the FAO [UN Food and Agriculture Organization]. 
  Presenting a study on the present status and the future of 
the National Program of Aid to Needy Families (PNAFN), Mr. Ben 
Kilani indicated that, based on the threshold calculated by the 
National Statistics Institute (INS), "the underprivileged 
percentage dropped from 33 percent in 1967 to 22.2 percent in 
1975, from 12.9 percent in 1980 to 7.7 percent in 1985, and to 
6.7 percent in 1990, representing 82,000 families at present, or 
about 544,000 individuals." 
  The official commented on the phenomenon, ascribing it to 
the 
country's economic growth as well as to "a genuine political 
will to fight poverty, which resulted in many programs" being 
implemented. 
  The officials classified these programs according to their 
goals: prevention, integration, or assistance. 
  For instance, "some programs specifically geared to the poor 
provide direct aid or subsidies and support the creation of 
income sources. Others, universal in scope, play a decisive part 
in fighting poverty, either by preserving the purchasing power 
or by improving living conditions. Others, finally, aim rather 
to prevent poverty," the official explained. 
  As a result, during the Seventh Plan (1987-1991), State 
expenditures in this respect totaled 18 percent of the GDP, or 
D12,140,000. This is a very high figure, the official noted. 
  Yet, he pointed out, "the State's efforts to eradicate 
poverty go beyond mere operational programs and also take the 
form of legislative measures." 
  Among these, Mr. Ben Kilani mentioned "tax exemptions 
granted 
to lowest income categories and specific benefits with respect 
to credit, which result in a considerable loss of revenues for 
the State." 
  The official also mentioned "policies with an obvious social 
dimension, such as education, vocational training, or family 
planning, which have an immediate or deferred impact on the 
disadvantaged." 
  Direct efforts to assist needy families through regular or 
occasional aid are easier to quantify. 
  As an example of occasional aid for the year 1992, the 
official quoted the following figures: 

  -  D3.606 million were distributed to 40,000 needy families 
on the occasion of religious holidays; 
  -  D15.5 million were distributed at the beginning of the school 
year, on behalf of 305,000 students from needy families. 
  This, of course, was in addition to aid in kind, such as 
meals provided by the IFTAR [expansion not given]. 
  As for regular aid, it includes essentially food provided to 
poor young students in the most disadvantaged areas. This is 
subsidized in part by the World Food Program [WFP], with the 
State paying for the rest. 
  Thus, the official mentioned that 1,350 school cafeterias 
currently provide meals for 223,480 primary school students, 
i.e.,16.3 percent of all primary school students. 
  As far as cash is concerned, regular aid is mostly provided 
by the PNAFN. It is intended for "families that are totally 
destitute and without resources, large families with limited 
resources, and the old or handicapped with no one to support 
them." 
  In his speech, Mr. Ben Kilani analyzed the PNAFN components, 
adding a few recommendations on how to improve its services. The 
program, he indicated, covered 101,000 families in 1992. Each 
family received on the average D250, i.e., a 178-percent 
increase compared with 1987. 
  [Box, p 3] 
<H5>  A Profile of the Disadvantaged </H5>
  What are actually the characteristics of Tunisian 
disadvantaged populations? 
  Referring to the 1990 INS survey, Mr. Abdellatif Ben Kilani, 
director at the Ministry of Social Affairs, made the following 
observations: 

  -  "The disadvantaged represent a very variable percentage of 
the population, depending on the social class and job category 
of the household head: 19 percent among the unemployed active 
population, and 2 percent among craftsmen and independent 
workers. Actually, in addition to these two categories, poverty 
affects nonfarm workers (249,000), farm workers (98,000), 
retired and other nonactive individuals (51,000), and farmers 
(32,000)." 
  -  "Since the last decade, poverty has assumed new 
forms; in fact, it has become more urban than rural (67 percent 
currently compared with 33 percent during the first two 
decades)." 
  -  "It affects not only those who cannot work, but also 
women and workers in the informal sector." 
  -  "The poverty rate 
exceeds 10 percent in the west while remaining below 5 percent 
in coastal areas."

<F P=106> [Article by Foued Allani: "Aid to Needy Families: A Program </F>
Deserving Support"] 
  [Text] Covering 101,000 families since 1992, the National 
Program of Aid to Needy Families (PNAFN) has distributed an 
average of 250 dinars[D] per family per year, i.e., 178 percent 
more than in 1987. 
  Created in 1986, the PNAFN was designed to help needy 
families living below the poverty level and whose purchasing 
power may deteriorate now that staple product prices are being 
adjusted. 
  This program "is part of the auxiliary measures provided 
under the economic recovery plan in order to alleviate the 
social impact of the Structural Adjustment Program (SAP) on poor 
populations, living below the poverty level." 
  Thus, in 1986 and 1992, the PNAFN spent as much as D93.834 
millions, and projected 1993 expenditures alone amounted to 
D26.26 millions. 
  According to a Ministry of Social Affairs survey of 61,000 
heads of households covered by this program, the recipients are 
as follows: 

  -  57 percent are women; 
  -  52 percent are over 60; 
  -  17.5 
percent are handicapped; 
  -  3 percent are covered by Social 
Security; 
  -  18 percent had a paying job at the time of the survey 
(15.2 percent on construction sites, 4.5 percent in agriculture, 
and 1 percent in services). 
  That last figure, according to the speaker, reflected one of 
the inadequacies of the programs, which suffers from some 
problems in targeting recipients. 
  Therefore, since 10 May 1993, the ministry has undertaken an 
exhaustive survey of the 101,000 families covered by the program 
and of another 59,000 families eligible for aid, in order to 
update and overhaul the program and set up local, regional, and 
central files on poverty. 
  Since that program alone is not adequate to ensure the 
social 
advancement of needy families, the Ministry of Social Affairs 
believes that it must be supported by additional efforts. For 
his part, Mr. Abdellatif Ben Kilani, director at the Ministry of 
Social Affairs, made the following suggestions: 

  -  "To make all participants aware of the social dimension of 
any development efforts, and to improve the identification 
capacity of social advancement projects." 
  -  "To finance social 
advancement programs essentially through solidarity (private 
efforts, especially foundations and non-governmental 
organizations)." 
  -  "To associate nongovernment organizations to 
the application and management of social advancement projects." 
  -  "To adopt a consensual approach as to which indicators are to 
be used by the various participants."

<F P=106> [Article signed S.A.M.: "Bizerte Development; Agriculture: </F>
Deficits and Records"--first two paragraphs are LA PRESSE DE 
TUNISIE introduction] 
  [Text] Since early last fall, all weather data pointed to a 
difficult year for agriculture, so much so that waiting for rain 
became the major concern of all Tunisians. Even children were 
talking about it, asking questions, and welcoming the first 
drops of the showers that belatedly restored the hopes of many 
people. 
  Today, right at mid-season, now that the die is cast and the 
major crop campaign is well under way, how are things, 
especially in the Bizerte area, one of the country's granaries? 
Based on current data, was there enough rain, shall we have a 
good grain harvest and enough fodder? 
<H5>  Rain Deficit </H5>
  According to agriculture experts, the rainfall recorded in 
the Bizerte area from the beginning of the season until the end 
of last January reached the 244.4-mm mark; this represents a 
36.6-percent deficit of 167.6 mm, because 418.45 mm of rain fell 
over the area during the season 1992-93. 
  On the other hand, the number of rainy days decreased rather 
appreciably: 39 days compared with an average of 62 days for the 
period in question. 
  In addition, on 21-23 January, the Bizerte area was far more 
affected than the rest of the country by violent winds exceeding 
95 km per hour, an unusual rise in the maximum temperature 
(estimated at 5.3 degrees), and an estimated 98.4-percent 
increase of the water evaporation rate. 
<H5>  Input and Seed: A Small But Real Gap </H5>
  The chemical fertilizer needs of the Bizerte area are 
estimated at 220,000 quintals of Ammonitre [ammonium nitrate 
fertilizer on plaster], 111,000 quintals of 45-percent 
phosphate, and 75,000 quintals of DAP [diammonium phosphate]. 
  However, until 31 January, the quantities available were 
much 
below the above requirements, amounting to only 110,000 quintals 
of Ammonitre, 63,000 quintals of phosphate, and 59,000 quintals 
of DAP for the area--not including, of course, the stocks of the 
Tunisian Chemical Fertilizer Company, estimated at 9,200 
quintals of Ammonitre and phosphate. 
  As for the quantities of high-grade seed offered by 
distribution centers, as of 31 January 1994 they amounted to 
18,947 quintals, whereas the program prepared by the general 
directorate of vegetable production mentioned a total of 26,000 
quintals; the realization rate, therefore, is 72.9 percent. 
  Note in addition that 17,521 quintals of choice seed had 
been 
distributed by 25 January 1994. 
  All these data (bad weather and irregular supplies of 
agricultural input and choice seed) slightly affected the 
season's good progress for major crops, truck crops, and tree 
growers, eventually leaving unaffected only the potato 
crop--which actually benefitted from the balmy weather of 
December and January--and the bulk of truck crops. 
<H5>  Major Crops: Wait and Hope </H5>
  During the 1993-94 season, an estimated 156,000 hectares 
[ha] 
were cultivated, compared with a projected 185,000 ha, hence an 
overall 84.6-percent realization rate. 
  A little over one-half of this area (i.e., 88,265 ha) was 
devoted to grain (soft and hard wheat, barley, and triticale), 
i.e., 1,195 ha less than during the previous season; this, 
experts agree, is insignificant compared to the effect of late 
and inadequate rainfall. 
  Concerning fodder, we can also say that the deficit is very 
small because about 48,500 ha in the area were planted in fodder 
crops this year (compared with projections of 55,500 ha and last 
season's figure of 50,470 ha), and since the State was able to 
make up for it by guaranteeing adequate barley and bran supplies 
to livestock breeders. 
  On the other hand, legumes and industrial crops seem to have 
been most severely affected and set back by the inadequate 
rainfall: only 17,235 ha could be planted with legumes (compared 
with 29,890 ha in 1992-93), and 476 ha with industrial crops 
(compared with 2,705 ha last year). 
  Similarly, tree growing programs were also affected by the 
weather, resulting in a relatively late start of the season; as 
of 31 January 1994, 120 ha had been planted in the area's common 
tree varieties (almond, apple, pear, plum, peach, pomegranate, 
and olive trees), whereas the 1993-94 program provided for 700 
ha being planted with fruit trees. 
<H5>  Potatoes: Record Results </H5>
  The potato crop, for its part, largely exceeded all previous 
averages, with 1,020 ha planted in late season, and early 
potatoes. 
  This appreciable increase is due mostly to the latter 
variety, which takes up 420 ha this year, compared with a 
previous average of 280 ha. This is because of the higher 
temperatures that prevailed last December and January and 
because of profitable sales of main season's potatoes and the 
arrival of fall potatoes on the market. 
  As far as the former variety is concerned, we should note 
that the acreage under cultivation amounts to 600 ha. Projected 
production amounts to 8,100 tons, or 15 tons per hectare with 
irrigation and 8 tons without; 85 percent of the crop was 
harvested and harvesting operations still go on. 
  For the other early greenhouse vegetables, programs continue 
at a steady rate and 15.5 ha were already planted with peppers, 
tomatoes, strawberries, and cucumbers. 
  We should also note that 2,800 ha were planted with various 
vegetables (including 690 ha just for artichokes) despite the 
relative lack of rainfall. 
  However, agricultural departments estimate that this leaves 
a 
deficit of 32 percent for garlic, 46 percent for broad beans, 
and 33 percent for green onions. 
  This being said, if all these figures seem somewhat 
pessimistic, we should still not jump to conclusions; just 
consider the considerable rainfall of the first two weeks of 
February and the rain that cannot fail to fall over the area and 
over the country (we fervently wish it will) next March, which 
will be worth its weight in gold for all agricultural varieties. 
  At this stage in the season, the only possible conclusion is 
that, although it may not break records, the year will not be as 
bad as we might be inclined to believe. Isn't greenery already 
covering our land?

<F P=106> [Unattributed article: "Meeting of the Bizerte Governorage </F>
Regional Council: Solutions to Several Social Problems"] 
  [Text] The Bizerte governorate regional council held its 
first meeting of 1994 last Saturday; the meeting was chaired by 
Mr. Mohamed Soudani, governor of Bizerte, and attended by the 
general secretary of the RCD [Democratic Constitutional Rally] 
coordination committee, and delegates and officials from 
regional technical and administrative departments. 
  At the meeting, the council amended the 1993 budget. The 
council also reviewed the progress of various 1993 economic and 
social programs and current year's programs, to which an 
estimated budget of 100.9 million dinars[D] was allocated 
(compared with D172 million in 1992 and 1993). 
  The council also declared itself pleased with the major 
initiatives taken on a regional and national scale in order to 
boost the spirit of solidarity during Ramadan, which resulted in 
D170,000 worth of aid for the underprivileged (this amount will 
be distributed to 6,863 needy families). Add to this the 
effective support offered by the seven solidarity restaurants 
opened in Bizerte, Menzel Bourguiba, Zarzouna, and Tinja to help 
820 disadvantaged individuals. 
  The governorate has also received a large quantity of 
clothing, for distribution to these 820 citizens. 
  Similarly, the governor informed the council that a solution 
had been found to several other social problems, like those 
involving workers at the Ichkeul quarries, closed because of 
damage to the environment, or the dockers of the Bizerte 
commercial harbor. 
  On the other hand, the council took note with pleasure of 
the 
17-percent drop in additional job applications, which totaled 
3,394 in 1993 compared with 3,983 the year before; this was due 
to a decrease in the number of school dropouts and an increase 
in the number of young people applying for training in the 
area's various vocational schools. 
  Apart from that, a study of the economy disclosed that 
planned 1994 regional investments amounted to D100.9 million, of 
which 60 percent will be allocated to productive sectors such as 
agriculture, fisheries, and the industry, 28 percent to basic 
community facilities, and 6.4 percent to cleaning up and 
pollution control. 
  Speaking of the tourism sector, the governor stated that 
construction of at least two hotels will start in 1994, the 
owners having completed all required procedures, whereas, two 
other tourism developers are about to complete their 
applications.

  [Text] The question posed in Yemen today is no longer: Has 
the unity experiment reached an impasse that will force a return 
to partition and separation or the use of federalism? Those who 
know the secrets of the behind-the-scenes activities are very 
afraid of a civil war like Somalia's, in which sultans will 
intervene in party conflicts and tribal disputes. The Socialists 
accuse President 'Ali 'Abdallah Salih of concocting this 
scenario with outside parties, aimed at escalating the situation 
and pushing the southerners into separatism. This could only end 
with military intervention in defense of Yemen's unity and 
stability. How was this scenario prepared, what are the 
alliances and balances of power, and where will it lead Yemen? 
<H5>  Sanaa Turns to Fundamentalist Movements, Tribes, and Sultans </H5>
to Liquidate the Socialist Party 
  Observers of the Yemeni scene are still trying to learn the 
factual secrets that the leader of the "southern" Socialist 
Party and vice president of the unified state, 'Ali Salim 
al-Bid, brought back from his trip abroad. This trip, which he 
took right after the parliamentary elections, took him to 
several world nations, including the United States. 
  Sources close to 'Ali Salim al-Bid confirm that he learned 
some very serious information from his American meetings with 
American and Western experts in Yemeni affairs. He returned with 
a different view of the future of the unity experiment and the 
dangers that threaten both it and him. This caused him to return 
directly to Aden and begin a period of seclusion, starting on 19 
August. Nothing gives the impression that it will end 
peacefully, with dialogue and conciliation, despite all the 
mediation and optimistic statements that have appeared from time 
to time. For more than two months, events in Yemen have called 
for pessimism, not only with regard to dissolving the unity 
agreement, but also the very serious repercussions that this 
consequence bears. They go beyond a return to partition and 
separation, or even using the option of a federation or 
confederation, to the danger of an outbreak of a bloody and 
destructive civil war, kindled by the flames of partisan 
conflicts, tribal disputes, and foreign interference. This 
causes many observers to express fear that this war could exceed 
Lebanon's and reach the level of Somalia's. 
  Despite indications of optimism that appear from time to 
time 
through statements of mediators, or even through the policy of 
moderation and sincerity that Yemeni President 'Ali 'Abdallah 
Salih has expressed, hinting at his readiness to offer the 
necessary commitments to save unity and avert the sacrifice of 
life and blood, the continual actual events are more of an 
indication for observers of what Yemen can expect. They see a 
very dangerous explosion being prepared that will be far 
different from those honeyed words. Sources close to the 
Socialist Party believe that a true reading of the situation in 
Yemen calls for going beyond the declaration of intentions to 
study the reality of the scheming intentions that are revealed 
by the actions and policies being pursued. They accuse President 
'Ali 'Abdallah Salih, i.e., the government in Sanaa, of 
exaggeration in raising and defending the slogans of unity and 
claiming to ardently adhere to them, while moving secretly in 
the opposite direction. They say that he is working to escalate 
and ignite the flames of dispute. Last week, those who are 
critical of President 'Ali 'Abdallah Salih offered new evidence 
of his secret policy, when they confirmed his responsibility or, 
at least, the government's responsibility under his orders, for 
objecting to the procession of Prime Minister Haydar Abu Bakr 
al- 'Attas along the heights of Sanaa. When he returned to the 
capital to resume dialogue meetings, groups of military police 
acted provocatively toward him, to the extent of pursuing the 
motorcade even down al-Sitin Street inside Sanaa. It was clear 
that the purpose of this action was to escalate the situation 
further, in circumstances that would aggravate matters and 
increase their complexity day after day. This would help to 
increase tension between Sanaa and Aden while, at the same time, 
President 'Ali 'Abdallah Salih's circles stress his eagerness to 
contain all disputes and overcome difficulties. He has also 
approved the 18 points that the Socialist Party put forth as a 
condition of 'Ali Salim al-Bid's return from seclusion. This 
last issue has poured oil on the fire, kindling more disputes 
and emphasizing the continuation of the two sides' mutual 
estrangement and the impossibility of dialogue. Circles close to 
the Socialist Party have asked how President 'Ali 'Abdallah 
Salih can announce his agreement to the conditions, while his 
opposing Haydar Abu Bakr al-'Attas's parade reflects continued 
violation of a basic point in dispute. This point is the 
interference of military police in security affairs, especially 
internal security, in addition to the continued militarization 
of cities and intensified deployment of military forces, 
especially in Sanaa. 
  In this atmosphere, informed circles in Sanaa and Aden 
express fears that the two sides will decide in the end to 
pursue the return to partition and separation, putting an end to 
three and one-half years of the unity experiment, which began on 
22 May 1990. These circles note that each side uses a different 
special and tactical way to arrive at this depressing result, 
considering that the Socialist Party plays an overt game of 
endorsing the return to federalism and local rule, which was 
expounded by Salim Salih Muhammad, member of the Presidential 
Council and assistant secretary general of the Socialist Party. 
On the other hand, the game of the Popular General Congress 
embraces a great deal of noise, suspicions, and questions. These 
circles say that the Socialist Party has discovered that the 
ruling party in Sanaa is playing with a well-thought-out mixed 
deck. Under cover of defending unity and expressing strong 
enthusiasm for it, it is pursuing a tactic aimed ultimately at 
squeezing the southerners and forcing them into separatism. At 
this point, President 'Ali 'Abdallah Salih could find an 
appropriate opportunity to intervene in Aden and occupy it, on 
behalf of saving unity and protecting the country's higher 
interests, security, stability, and civil peace. In the end, 
this would lead to the actual unification of Yemen, but under 
Sanaa's authority. 
<H5>  Intervention Scenario </H5>
  'Ali Salim al-Bid supporters stress that he has obtained 
data 
confirming this scenario. He has learned that a group from the 
pro-Iraqi Ba'th Party and Saddam Husayn supporters inside the 
regime in Sanaa have been pushing in this direction. They have 
prepared the political and military details to achieve this end. 
'Ali Salim al-Bid adds that the Iraqi military experts, who are 
working beside the Republican Guard in Sanaa, are supervising 
preparation of military and security plans in this regard. 
  Socialist Party groups stress their conviction that all 
events in Yemen over several months are contributing to this 
scenario. They say that all acts of escalation that have 
occurred--and will occur--despite repeated invitations to 
dialogue, are aimed at pursuing this plan to the end. They 
enumerate a series of actions that have led to increased 
difficulties and obstacles impeding the unity experiment, and 
that have bogged down any practical implementation of it. They 
include a series of assassinations against leaders and prominent 
figures of the Socialist Party, as well as other acts of 
intimidation and terrorism. 
  The insistence of the Popular General Congress in Sanaa on 
controlling the decision-making sources in the unified 
government and occupying the most important and sensitive posts 
has led to Socialist and southern feelings of having been 
cheated, which have caused them to complain and hint at 
separation. The fact is that there is an official and unofficial 
current in southern circles that says bitterly and angrily that 
the south was the biggest loser in the unification process, 
whose agreements have not been effectively applied. Some people 
in Sanaa say that unification was between the Socialist Party 
and the Congress and, even then, only on the level of the 
northern governorates, whether with regard to the general 
treasury or the division of jobs. The Socialist Party has 
continued to rule the south. Southerners have accused the regime 
in Sanaa of pursuing a policy of annexation and abrogation 
against them, of dealing with the southern and eastern 
governorates as if they were "an annex of Yemen, and as if there 
were a birthright-Yemeni and a derived-Yemeni and citizens of 
lower degrees," quoting Brigadier General Baras, chairman of the 
Preparation Committee for the Hadramawt [meeting]. This 
impression has been emphasized more than once by Salim Salih 
Muhammad, criticizing the mentality that "looks at us as if we 
actually came from outside Yemen." He pointed to the complete 
ban on the Socialist Party in the north, while the Congress has 
set up shop in all the governorates, where Congress members are 
commanders of security, police, and customs, and officials of 
the Ministry of Finance. Salim Salih Muhammad got to the nub of 
the matter when he asked: "How many Socialist Party cadre are 
there in the Office of the Presidency?" Perhaps this feeling of 
being cheated is what has caused 'Ali Salim al-Bid and the 
Socialists to refer more than once to the fact that they made a 
mistake in agreeing to unity. Southerners add to these elements 
an important economic factor. Because of this factor, southern 
Yemen with 3.5 million inhabitants has suffered more than has 
the north from economic problems. In the south, prices have gone 
up more, and the inflation rate has reached 600 percent. At the 
same time, in the north, inflation has been held to 40 percent. 
There has been no distribution of wealth, specifically oil, and 
the government has not kept its pledge to establish a free zone 
in Aden. 
  In addition to the exorbitant rise in prices and, 
consequently, increased popular resentment because of living 
standards, there have been breaches of security and public order 
and increased acts of violence, especially organized 
assassinations, which have shown the Socialists that they are 
the targets. It is worth mentioning that 'Ali Salim al-Bid has 
not concealed the fact that one of the reasons for his return to 
Aden and his seclusion there was his fear of meeting the same 
fate as former North Yemen President Ibrahim al-Hamdi. Al-Hamdi 
was pro-unity and was killed in mysterious circumstances in 
October 1977, on the eve of an intended visit to make to Aden. 
Al-Bid has indicated that al-Hamdi's assassination was "the 
result of treachery. We must get rid of this deception and 
trickery." 
  The Socialist Party's leadership has, more than once, 
accused 
elements connected with Sanaa of being behind the assassinations 
and attempted assassinations, to which more than one party 
official has been exposed. It has said that those who carried 
out these acts enjoy the protection of prominent northern 
officials. The party has made the issue of exposing them and 
conducting investigations a basic condition with regard to 
returning to "normalcy." 
  In the past few days, prominent Socialists have bluntly 
revealed the existence of a plan aimed at assassinating party 
figures and leaders in Sanaa, including Minister of Defense 
Haytham Qasim Tahir, and certain Socialist Party Political 
Office members. They stress that there is no security for the 
lives of southern officials in Sanaa. A few days after the 
discussion of these plans, a senior southern officer was 
kidnapped by unknown persons who led him away from his room in 
one of Sanaa's hotels. He had come there from Aden on a mission. 
Observers believe the case of Lieutenant Colonel Mahmud Mas'ad 
al-Huraysi, a senior Armed Forces officer, is very serious and 
intended to stir up discord among individuals of the Armed 
Forces, which have not only remained un-united, but have also 
recently been conducting military movements. They are making 
continuous preparations to guard against any surprise, and have 
brought back partition--in a way--by placing barrels [at border 
crossings]. The situation is tense along border areas between 
north and south, which have previously seen three wars. 
<H5>  Fundamentalists and Sultans </H5>
  Socialist Party circles accuse the Popular General Congress 
of carrying out a series of assassinations, for the purpose of 
further escalating the crisis in accordance with a prepared 
scenario. They have information that Sanaa, in order to achieve 
its escalation strategy, is relying on other factors and 
elements. The first factor is Islamic extremists. Socialists 
accuse many of them of fomenting security disturbances in Aden 
and carrying out assassination attempts against Socialist 
officials, after having been mobilized against this Marxist 
party and urged to take revenge against its anti-Islam policy. 
The Socialists have--more than once before--stressed that Sanaa 
is giving military and material aid to a number of Yemeni 
Afghans and mujahidin to carry out operations in the south and 
to assassinate southern officials in the north. Undoubtedly the 
Socialist Party, which is afraid of the repercussions from the 
results achieved by the Reform Alliance in the recent 
legislative elections, leading Shaykh 'Abdallah al-Ahmar to the 
chairmanship of the Leadership Council, is even more afraid of a 
fundamentalist intifadah in the south and the growth of 
extremist Islamic movements. 
  The second factor is the split in the south caused by the 
stirring up of so-called family sensitivities, or the return to 
inciting the sultans against the Socialist Party, which has 
nationalized the property of the wealthy and the sultans. At the 
beginning of this year, the arrest of the sultan of Abyan, Tariq 
al-Fadli, on the charge of assassinating 'Ali Salih 'Abbad, a 
member of the Socialist Party's Political Office, stirred up a 
crisis between Sanaa and Aden. In recent weeks, it was noted 
that the sultans have returned to provocative activities and 
intervention in the existing crisis. This clearly began when 
Sultan Ahmad 'Abdallah al-Fadli, the previous sultan of Abyan, 
sent a telegram to both President 'Ali 'Abdallah Salih and 
Shaykh 'Abdallah Bin-Husayn al-Ahmar, in which he accused the 
Socialist Party of working to separate south Yemen, after having 
confirmed the existence of large oil reserves in its territory. 
  Perhaps the greatest danger that looms on the Yemeni horizon 
today is the danger of resumption of tribal conflicts, with some 
tribes bearing arms against others. Yemen lives today with the 
fear of the historic conflict between the Hashid and Bakil 
tribes. According to some, the visit to Aden by Shaykh Sinan 
Abu-Luhum, who led a large delegation seeking to reconcile 
points of view, was interference in an alliance between 'Ali 
Salim al-Bid and the Bakil tribes in the north. These tribes are 
well known for their animosity against the Hashid tribes, to 
which President 'Ali 'Abdallah Salih and Shaykh al-Ahmar belong. 
  Some observers believe that the Socialist Party is not 
unlikely to react against Sanaa at the risk of a bloody war, 
while security in the south is ensured, thanks to the domination 
of the cohesive and ideological southern army, considered 
militarily stronger than the army of the north. 
  In the last few weeks, it was noted that several tribes and 
areas have begun to move into the line of conflict and that the 
dangers of an explosion are increasing. The Hadramawt area, for 
example, has severely criticized the north and has called for 
local rule, broad powers, and the enjoyment of privatization. 
That should be granted to it to make use of the more than 60 
percent of Yemeni oil reserves that lie under its territory. 
Despite the insistence at the Hadramawt meeting on rejecting 
separation, observers think that this initiative is an indicator 
that goes beyond putting pressure on Sanaa to save unity. As for 
the Khawlan tribes that stress they are an indivisible part of 
the Bakil, they have demanded participation in power, 
commensurate with their size. 
<H5>  Civil War </H5>
  At this time, the mobilization campaign continues in the 
south because of indicators that there is a threat of something 
that is far beyond separation. This campaign intensified after 
the assassination attempt in Aden against 'Ali Salim al-Bid's 
sons, Nayif and Yusuf, and the assassination of his sister's 
son. Al-Bid's sister waved her son's blood-splattered clothes in 
his funeral procession, old southern revolutionary anthems were 
played, and the blue and red-starred party flag waved. The 
demonstrators shouted for revenge, calling for the return of 
confrontation lines on the borders and for the bearing of arms 
against the north, instead of continuing to live like beggars in 
the unified Yemen. In fact, there is increasing talk about 
arming the youth and readying armed militias among the citizens. 
  Together with that, media campaigns and the exchange of 
accusations between the two sides continue. There are also 
southerners returning to the north and northerners to the south, 
along with military reinforcements and reports of arms and 
experts arriving by this route or that. Observers expect tension 
to increase during the next few days. They think that the south 
will continue to work to propose a federation or confederation 
as the ideal solution to avoid separation and return to 
partition. However, Socialist Party leaders are convinced that 
Sanaa will persist in a policy of no alternative to unity from 
its own perspective, in order to impose domination over both the 
north and south. These observers expect that, in the next phase, 
the south will experience security disturbances and widespread 
acts of assassination and abduction, accompanied by a 
suffocating economic crisis. The purpose of this is to generate 
a vast outcry for separation, which would be achieved. Then, 
Sanaa would intervene. According to the latest information, 
Sanaa has been arranging strong relations with southern tribes, 
sultans, and fundamentalist movements. It has ended its 
negotiations with the former southern president, Nasir Muhammad, 
to host him in Sanaa, in an attempt to win over the last wave of 
Socialist old-timers. However, Arab and foreign observers and 
mediators, who have tried and are trying to obtain conciliation 
and not allow matters to reach a point of no return, know full 
well the dangers of continued escalation in this direction, 
because that will ultimately lead to Yemen's getting into a 
civil war, whose results and repercussions would be more 
dangerous by far than all the wars that have previously been 
fought by the people of this single country.

<F P=106> [Article by Eric Watkins: "Diminished Quantities of Oil </F>
Discoveries in Yemen"] 
  [Text] Bernard Essotier, president of the Canadian 
Occidental Petroleum Company, remains optimistic vis-a-vis the 
Yemeni oil industry, despite the drop in amounts of new oil 
discoveries in Yemen and the rising cost of continuing 
exploration. 
  Essotier also insists that there are large reserves in 
Yemen, 
but conceded that the area's secrets cannot be known until 
additional information is available. He says: "We are continuing 
to work on an active program of exploration in the concession 
area granted to us, where we can produce some oil. We still 
expect to test small setups. We are working hard and actively to 
complete this, because these wells are close to our existing 
facilities." 
  In view of the fact that the drop in oil prices is 
negatively 
affecting the budget earmarked for exploration, the Canadian 
company is not at present pushing to find large discoveries in 
the remote parts of their concession area, which totals 37,500 
square km [sq km]. Rather, it is concentrating on the smaller 
discoveries, which can be incorporated economically into the 
existing facilities. 
  It is worth mentioning that the oil fields and facilities 
belonging to the Canadian company are located in the al-Masilah 
region in Southern Yemen. 
  These facilities are connected by a 138 km pipeline south to 
the port of al-Shuhayr on the coast of the Gulf of Aden. 
  The Canadian partner announced that, since the start of 
production in September 1993, its concession area has produced 
546 million barrels of oil. Production has reached an average of 
135,000 barrels per day [bpd], i.e., one-third of Yemen's oil 
production. 
  Despite Essotier's doubts that his company's production from 
its producing fields will increase very much in the coming year, 
he expressed optimism regarding increased oil discoveries in his 
company's concession area. He said: "There are still good 
quantities, particularly in the lower strata," referring to the 
fact that solid rock bases are located under the higher 
limestone formations, where oil is usually found. He added: "We 
have one well that produces 8,000 bpd of excellent quality oil 
in a natural smooth, stable flow. This indicates a broad area, 
some of which is connected with others, which encourages us to 
continue our activities." 
  In a related development, the Canadian company is exchanging 
data with other companies that control nearby concession areas, 
especially with the Clyde, Lasmo, and Nimeyer companies, active 
to the north and northeast of the al-Masilah fields. 
  With regard to the Canadian company's discoveries, those 
active in the oil business think that there is a not 
inconsiderable amount of oil there, but they have so far been 
unable to find conclusive evidence. In April 1993, the Total 
Company announced the discovery of a field that could yield 
12,000 bpd, located east of al-Masilah. North of al-Masilah, the 
Clyde Company is currently evaluating results, after the recent 
discovery of a field located close to the Canadian company's 
concession. 
  It is said that Lasmo has so far dug three wells in which 
nothing was found, while the Nimeyer Company has just begun to 
implement its digging program. 
  With the diminishing possibily of finding major quantities 
of 
oil, the oil companyies, in order to assure economic 
feasibility, will be obliged to gradually intensify their 
exploration programs and concentrate their efforts on small 
discoveries close to their present facilities. 
  Nevertheless, workers in the oil business insist that even 
these modest exploration efforts might be economically 
unfeasible, in view of the existing agreements with the Yemeni 
Government, which stipulate participation in production.

  [Text] The general manager of mines and metals for 
Kohkiluyeh va Boyer Ahmad Province said: The very rich mines in 
this province are not being exploited in the desired manner due 
to investment problems. 
  Engineer Mojtaba Shari'ati added: Since the year 1361 [21 
March 1982-20 March 1983] 33 mines have been readied for 
operation in this province, and 25 exploration projects have 
also been carried out. 
  According to him, in the current year mine exploration 
operations in Kohkiluyeh va Boyer Ahmad Province were done 
through the use of satellite photographs and information for the 
first time in the nation's history, with credits of 835 million 
rials. 
  He said that this province's important mines include those 
for silicone, dolomite, copper, phosphate, oxide, decorative and 
facade stone, salt, fire clay, and celestine. 
  The general manager of mines and metals for Kohkiluyeh va 
Boyer Ahmad noted: The assays for the ores in this province's 
mines are generally above standard. 
  He added: The celestine mines in Kohkiluyeh va Boyer Ahmad 
are considered to be among the world's richest, with proven 
capacities of 2 million tons and assayed at 92 percent by 
foreign and domestic experts. 
  Engineer Shari'ati added: The province's phosphate mines, 
with reserves of 400 million tons and assayed at 12 percent, 
have been recognized as being among the nation's best phosphate 
mines. Likewise, the presence of 200 million tons of dolomite 
reserves assayed at 23 percent presents favorable conditions for 
the construction of factories to produce dolomite fire clay. 
  He said: The task of completing the exploration for copper 
mines, along with the accompanying elements such as silver with 
192 "PPM" is being carried out in the province, and with the 
identification of mines for facade and decorative stone with 
high reserves and quality, it is necessary to invest to activate 
these mines. 
  He added: Utilization of the province's bauxite mines, with 
reserves of 10 million tons assayed at 54 percent, could play an 
effective role in creating prosperous economic and social 
conditions in the Province of Kohkiluyeh va Boyer Ahmad. 
  Engineer Shari'ati said the province has significant 
reserves 
of marl and limestone. He said: The mines in Dasht-e Rum of 
Boyer Ahmad, with the capacity to produce 2,000 tons per day, 
can meet the needs of a cement factory for 150 years. 
  He noted the abundance of gypsum mines in the Kohkiluyeh va 
Boyer Ahmad Province. He said the Karik gypsum in Boyer Ahmad, 
with its 100-percent purity, could be used for medicinal and 
export purposes.

  [Text] News Service -- Dr. Delju, executive director of the 
Iran Insurance Company, gave a press conference yesterday, 
Wednesday morning, in which he discussed this organization's 
performance for the year. 
  He discussed the anniversary of last year's passenger 
aircraft disaster. He said: Damages have been paid to the 
survivors of 106 of the 119 people who were killed. The files on 
six of them are being studied and the survivors of the other 
seven disaster victims have not yet come forward. 
  Dr. Delju said: The Iran Insurance Company is prepared to 
pay 
the damages for these seven people if their survivors come 
forward. 
  Concerning the insurance on the air travelers, he said: 
According to the insurance laws, every aircraft passenger has 
$20,000 in insurance coverage, $400 in coverage for accompanying 
goods, and another $400 in coverage for the traveler's personal 
effects. 
  Dr. Delju said: About 40 million rials has been paid to the 
survivors of each of the crash victims. 
  The executive director of the Iran Insurance Company 
discussed the fact that one-third of the personnel of this 
company are people who have sacrificed for the Islamic 
revolution. Mr. Mohammad-Khani, minister of economic affairs and 
finance, has said: The file on the affairs of those who have 
sacrificed who work for the Iran Insurance Company has been 
compiled, and the problems of these dear ones will be addressed. 
  Continuing, he said: The Iran Insurance Company has taken 
steps to implement the policy of expanding and improving its 
service network by increasing the number of its branches and 
representatives throughout the country. 
  He added: The Iran Insurance Company had 74 branch offices 
in 
the year 1369 [21 March 1980-20 March 1981], and this number has 
now been increased to 108 branch offices. In the near future 
five offices will be opened in the cities of Abhar, Nehavand, 
Babolsar, Ramsar, and Bandar-e Torkman. 
  Dr. Delju said: To provide coverage to deprived areas and 
municipalities, the Iran Insurance Company, with the cooperation 
of the postal service of the Islamic Republic of Iran, has 
established 176 representatives in the municipalities, and the 
insurance operations will be conducted through these postal 
offices. He discussed the Iran Insurance Company's operations on 
international markets. He said: The Iran and England Insurance 
Company in London has increased its capital from 10 to 20 
million English pounds, and this in itself has created special 
privileges for this company so that we can be present in the 
international markets with greater capability. 
  He added: For the second time, the Iran Insurance Company 
won 
an international bidding competition in one of the Persian Gulf 
nations, and this in itself illustrates our active involvement 
internationally. In conclusion, Dr. Delju said: In the first 
nine months of the current year [21 March-21 December 1993] the 
Iran Insurance Company increased its damage payments 60 percent 
compared to the same period the previous year.

  [Text] During the year 1371 [21 March 1992-20 March 1993] 
more than 2,043 mines were operating in the country, and this 
figure shows a 6.4-percent growth over the year 1370 [21 March 
1991-20 March 1992]. 
  Hamid Zowqifard, general manager of the Office of Statistics 
and Technical Information in the Ministry of Mines and Metals, 
announced the above in an interview with IRNA. He added: In the 
first six months of the current year [21 March-23 September 
1993] more than 744,921 tons of rock coal was extracted by the 
units under the mantle of this ministry, a 19.2-percent increase 
over the same period in the year 1371 [21 March-23 September 
1992]. 
  Likewise the copper, manganese and chromite extracted in the 
first six months of the year 1372 [21 March-23 September 1993] 
from the nation's mines was 5,198,754 million tons, 26,682 tons, 
and 33,678 tons, respectively, increases of 7.4 percent for 
copper ore, 36 percent for manganese ore, and 100 percent for 
chromite ore from the same period the previous year. 
  According to Zowqifard, in the first six months of the 
current year [21 March-23 September 1993] more than 1,887,427 
tons of steel ingots were produced, representing growth of 25.8 
percent compared to the same period the previous year. 
  The general manager of the Office of Statistics and 
Technical 
Information in the Ministry of Mines and Metals discussed the 
comparative production statistics for the years 1371 [21 March 
1992-20 March 1993] and 1370 [21 March 1991-20 March 1992] in 
the areas of lead and zinc. He said: Last year 1,081,827 tons of 
lead and zinc were produced, an increase of about 37.3 percent 
over the year 1370. 
  Likewise, the production of decorative and facade stone and 
low grade stone [sang-e lasheh] for construction increased 12 
percent and 45.2 percent, respectively, in the year 1371 [21 
March 1992-20 March 1993] compared to the year 1370 [21 March 
1991-20 March 1992]. 
  He announced the willingness of the Office of Statistics and 
Technical Information in the Ministry of Mines and Metals to 
cooperate with the nation's organizations and universities. He 
said: Last year and this year this ministry cooperated with the 
Iran Statistics Center to carry out the 1371 [21 March 1992 -20 
March 1993] Joint Census of Mines. 
  Zowqifard explained that the Office of Statistics and 
Technical Information in the Ministry of Mines and Metals is 
equipped with the most modern computer system. He said: 
Likewise, this ministry's library has been equipped with a 
computer system. 
  In conclusion, he said the spread of the culture of 
statistics in this country is important. He said: It is 
necessary to be aware of the latest statistics and figures in 
order to activate the nation's potential abilities.

<F P=106> [Unatrributed article: "One Maghrebian Out of Five Lives in </F>
Poverty"] 
  [Text] Not everyone has benefited from the food policies 
established in the Maghreb 30 years ago. A sizable minority of 
the population sometimes goes hungry... 
  Nearly one of five Maghrebians is living under the poverty 
line and suffering nutritional deficiencies. This is the 
situation for 20 percent of Algerians, 17 percent of Tunisians, 
and 30 percent of Moroccans, according to figures presented at a 
workshop held recently in Alexandria (Egypt) on food problems in 
the Maghreb region. 
  "We are seeing an increasingly visible movement of the poor 
into urban milieus, a consequence of rural exodus by the most 
impoverished peasants," reported Martine Padilla, economist at 
the Mediterranean Agronomy Institute (IMA), one of the workshop 
leaders. 
  Although significant progress has been registered since the 
1960's, when an estimated two-thirds of all Tunisians were 
living under the poverty line, a sizable minority of these 
countries' inhabitants still suffers from malnutrition. In 
Algeria, "15 percent of the women have a significant deficit in 
protein calories," the economist said. 
  This despite large annual appropriations to support national 
food policies (2.6 percent of GDP in Morocco and Algeria, and 
3.5 percent in Tunisia). 
  The food planning policies pursued over the last 30 years 
have raised the average standard of living: There has been a 
measurable increase in life expectancy, with most nutritional 
needs being met; but this progress has left behind a not 
insignificant minority of the population. Martine Padilla notes 
paradoxically that while "some people are suffering from 
deficiencies, others show signs of dietary excess. Many cases of 
obesity, especially among women, are found in Morocco and 
Tunisia." 
  Countrywide distribution of staple foods (cereals, vegetable 
oils, milk, and sugar in all three countries, plus eggs in 
Tunisia and coffee in Algeria) has also had the perverse effect 
of depressing local agricultural productivity. Augmented 
consumption, fostered by easy access to products, has forced 
governments to allocate more and more foreign exchange for food. 
  Between 1970 and 1992, Algeria's external food dependency 
increased fourfold. Currently, 80 percent of staples consumed 
there are imported. In Tunisia, the imported share is 60 
percent. Only Morocco, a traditional exporter of agricultural 
products, has managed to keep food imports and exports in some 
kind of balance. 
<H5>  End of Subsidies </H5>
  Morocco has kept dependency down to 20 percent, but only by 
curtailing consumption of certain foods (e.g., milk, mutton) 
that are not produced locally in sufficient quantity. 
  Declining export earnings (oil for Algeria and phosphates 
for 
Morocco) exacerbated budgetary imbalances and increased 
indebtedness, leading governments to revise their food security 
policies. Especially after imposition of Structural Adjustment 
Programs by the IMF. Since the inauguration of these programs 
(1985-90), Tunisia and Morocco have initiated a truth in pricing 
policy. 
  This year they must categorically eliminate all subsidies. 
Algeria, now in the midst of a debt renegotiation round, has 
already ended subsidies on all products except bread and 
semolina. 
  The myth of food self-sufficiency has had its hour. Gone are 
the days when whole populations could be inundated with food 
staples made available at prices totally disconnected from the 
market: Interventions today must be selective. 
  "What governments need now is to identify the people who are 
being hit hardest by malnutrition, who present the risk of a 
social explosion," says Martine Padilla. Already Morocco is 
getting aid from an American NGO [nongovernmental organization], 
Catholic Relief Services, which distributes food to the 
neediest, as well as generous alimentary assistance from the 
United States ($15 million this year). In 1991 Algeria 
instituted a "social safety net" policy that affects half of its 
population but remains notoriously ineffective. 
  In fact, it costs as much as countrywide subsidies while 
doing nothing to solve the country's serious budgetary problem. 
For all these reasons, the Algerians would like to modify their 
strategy. 
  There are also purely technical problems. What kind of 
targeting: by product, by geographic zone, by both together--or 
perhaps distribution of "food tickets" giving access to certain 
stores? 
  Aid channeled to society's neediest also poses the question 
of how to mobilize the funds to purchase vast quantities of food 
products on the market, store them, and distribute them at sites 
accessible to a diffuse public, including many inhabitants 
disinclined to accept the stigma of the "poverty" label. 
  Maghrebian rulers must consider all possible solutions to 
the 
dilemma of how to reduce undernourishment in an international 
environment of recession and budgetary restrictions.

<F P=106> [Interview with 'Abbas Zaki, Fatah Central Committee member, </F>
in Amman; date not given: "'Arafat Responsible for Decline of 
PLO"--first paragraph is AL-SHARQ introduction] 
  [Text] Amman (AL-SHARQ special)--A prominent Fatah Central 
Committee member held Chairman Yasir 'Arafat responsible for the 
deterioration of conditions in the PLO. He said that 'Arafat had 
gone out of his way to win the world and Israel's approval and 
had lost his own people. He said that whoever wants to negotiate 
with Rabin must be close to the Palestinian opposition, not 
remote from it. 'Abbas Zaki, who was speaking to AL-SHARQ and is 
also secretary of the intifadah's Supreme Committee, stated that 
all the agreements that 'Arafat had concluded with Israel 
"remain for us a truce for another war." He wagered on the 
resoluteness of the Palestinian people not to submit. "The 
Palestinian leadership," said Zaki, "must again go through the 
Jordanian gate, because any Jordanian-Palestinian agreement will 
protect what remains of the Palestinians and will prevent the 
Zionist urge to expand." Here is the text of the interview. 
  [AL-SHARQ] From your statements we know that you are one of 
the opponents of the Gaza-Jericho First agreement. Opponents 
have expressed their opposition in various ways, such as 
resignation. How have you expressed your opposition? 
  [Zaki] I am against categorizing everyone who loves his 
country and who adheres to his principles and maintains the 
values and heritage of militancy as "opposition," because this 
will mean that terms will collapse. It will mean that those who 
adhere to principles and constants are to be called 
"opposition." The legitimate authority has engaged in 
concession-making and abandonment and is far from consensus 
decisionmaking. The Oslo agreement was a disgraceful agreement 
in the life of the Palestinian people. It was a disaster that 
took place in circumstances difficult for our people. When we 
went to Madrid, our incentive was to stop the cancer of 
settlements and land confiscation from spreading in the 
Palestinian body. Palestinian speech-making was excellent. Dr. 
Haydar 'Abd-al-Shafi outshone Shamir. There was corridor 
diplomacy, and a Palestinian avoidance of the political 
indecency of abdication that took place in the Oslo agreement. 
The latter came by stealth, from behind the backs of the 
leadership, the negotiators, and the people. The agreement 
emerged from this work in the dark. It has prevented our people 
from talking about the resolutions of the legitimate 
international authority and about the political authority for 
the political process. Syria and Jordan are talking about land 
for peace and implementation of 242 and 338. The Palestinians, 
on the other hand, cannot talk about land for peace or demand 
implementation of 242. So negotiation takes place piecemeal 
until one gets 2 percent of Palestinian territory. 
  Surely, no patriot can accept this agreement, despite all 
the 
piping and drumming for it. We see its popularity waning and 
declining. The unfair conditions accompanying the implementation 
of this agreement do not accord with the nature of Palestinian 
heroism, Palestinian rights, or the Palestinian role in the 
liberation struggle. This became clear for example after the 
Davos and Cairo agreements, which accord with the Oslo 
agreement, which does not guarantee an Israeli withdrawal. 
Settlement-building is continuing. We are a tool in the hand of 
the enemy: he has the last word, and any other interpretations 
are pure fiction. What's more, the leadership has sold the 
agreement as being a national authority, etc. Let 'Arafat go; 
let him sign with Peres, not with Rabin, to cancel the national 
authority and the free crossing points and demand a halt to 
settlement. Jericho will remain as many kilometers as they 
approved without any increase. Gaza, too, has been divided into 
squares, and new lands have been added to the settlements in 
Gaza--more than 30 kilometers. Our language now is not against 
or in opposition to the agreement; it is for Palestine. Whoever 
isolates himself from his people and national decisions is in 
opposition--not we. In another way I have expressed my 
conviction that the children, women, old men, and men of the 
Palestinian people are innocent of the deal going on. In harmony 
with our people and the principles of our movement, I will not 
resign. I shall continue to demand that we stay the course to 
ward off the corruption, stop the cycle of decline, and realize 
some of the aspirations we hoped for. 
  [AL-SHARQ] In Davos, Israeli Foreign Minister Peres implied 
that 'Arafat had abandoned the establishment of an independent 
Palestinian state and had decided on a confederation. How true 
is this talk, and what is your opinion? 
  [Zaki] Please don't ask me about the Peres-'Arafat meeting, 
because it did not take place by Palestinian decision. It took 
place without our knowledge; so we will not defend something we 
do not know. 
  [AL-SHARQ] The 10 opposition groups led by the Islamic 
opposition movement, Hamas have arrived among themselves at a 
collective leadership that offers itself as an alternative to 
the present leadership. Do you think the project will succeed? 
What is your position as an opposition figure regarding this 
front? 
  [Zaki] First, people understand things the wrong way around. 
Whoever wants to become leader of this people must fight. He 
must start from the base. If you want to propose yourself as an 
alternative to the leadership, you confirm and elevate your 
leadership on the basis of martyrs' skulls, or great 
achievements, or defeats inflicted on the enemy, so that you 
become uncontested leader. You don't snatch leadership by 
competing with a team that you happen to see in this position. 
My view is that the Palestinian opposition has not been 
successful to date. It is seeking to set up an inverted pyramid. 
We have gotten used to lots of grinding noise from the mill 
without seeing any flour. The opposition forces must insist on 
the need to espouse resolutions from which the Oslo team 
retreated, but without exaggeration and suicidal slogans. We 
have found that committed militant momentum, along with the 
feeling and resources of the people, needs implementation 
without slogans. Anyone who wants to deviate from the national 
course and constant principles has no place with our people. But 
for us to make two fronts in a face-off with each other is a 
real disaster. The opposition realizes that the Americans, the 
Arabs, and weak-spirited Palestinians and ordinary people are 
for the agreement. Confronting the whole world at once yields 
nothing. If only the opposition were working for ultimate issues 
and struggling for Jerusalem! Jerusalem is being wiped off the 
map. In six months there won't be any East Jerusalem. It has an 
area of 72 square [sq] km; Palestinians now own 4 sq km. Now 
there are Israeli projects like al-Tur and Ra's al-'Amud, in 
addition to the razing of 438 houses. The issue is being limited 
to praying in Jerusalem. They are granting us a Jerusalem for 
prayer, not for sovereignty. Thus, if the opposition works for 
Jerusalem, the refugees, security, borders, and the issues 
contested with the enemy, it cannot stand still. I challenge 
Israel to announce its idea of the scope of the final 
settlement; for the solution is open, admitting of all 
possibilities, and needs major forces to make [Israel] yield. 
With this fragmentation we are serving the plot for a final 
settlement with open possibilities. Rabin, too, has not talked 
about the final settlement. The 10 groups must therefore work to 
alleviate our people's sufferings. Their concern must not become 
only the Oslo team. They must talk about Israel. This is the 
direction that we in Fatah have taken. In his recent visit to 
Jordan, Abu al-Lutf [Faruq al-Qaddumi] expressed this when he 
attacked Rabin and said that he does not want peace. This is 
what is needed and wanted: instead of attacking a Palestinian 
leader, we must attack the Israelis. We must get over our 
complexes by being clearly of the PLO or clearly of Fatah or any 
other organization, or we shall begin attacking the fighting men 
who are in confrontation with the enemy. In that case the people 
retreat behind the leaders. The leader is the one who goes in 
front of the ranks. The measuring stick for any revolution is 
the amount of blood it gives and the martyrs it offers. If Fatah 
had not given so many martyrs, people would not have remained 
silent until now and unable to speak about Fatah members as 
having deviated openly. Whoever wants to become an alternative 
needs a large pool of sacrifices, positions, and a role that has 
an audience so that he can overcome all the challenges. I send 
an open invitation for the opposition to return to weaving the 
feelings and emotions of the people into a true front. We 
welcome any Palestinian unity, because the keynote of this 
period is to give concrete embodiment to democracy. We therefore 
consider any unity, whether it looks at us positively or 
negatively, as in the interest of our people. 
  [AL-SHARQ] A number of Palestinian personalities led by 
Haydar 'Abd-al-Shafi have put forward demands for perestroyka in 
the PLO. 'Abd-al-Shafi has expressed disappointment at the 
results of the talks with the leadership. What is your opinion 
about this? 
  [Zaki] The internal situation is tragic. It does not express 
the existence of vision or a point of departure for dealing with 
internal conditions. The delegations that have been formed were 
from the fabric of the Palestinian leadership, but bad 
management and inept performance have made it necessary for it 
to raise its voice loudly. Let there be a fight inside the camp 
of political harmony. But they are at odds administratively. In 
reality, there is no change in method or style or in 
performance. We think that if we study the Palestinian situation 
deeply, we shall reach the conviction that the decline of 
Palestinian institutions must be halted. 
  [AL-SHARQ] What is the flaw at the present time in the 
management of the negotiations and the Palestinian situation? 
  [Zaki] In Oslo, the Executive Committee and the Central 
Committee were kept in the dark for eight months concerning an 
important event to sell Palestine. The Cairo-Davos agreement was 
signed without our knowledge. A meeting was held to tell us that 
the agreement had been signed between Abu-'Ammar and Peres. So 
the negotiating delegation had no value, and Palestinian 
institutions have likewise become worthless. This requires 
serious pondering. 
  [AL-SHARQ] Many resignations of Fatah cadres have been 
submitted in the occupied territories. The Fatah Hawks have 
abandoned arms. What do you think is the reason for these 
resignations? Are they related to the figure of the chairman? 
  [Zaki] There is no doubt that Brother Abu-'Ammar is the head 
of the PLO. There remains no one with him on the Executive 
Committee. Second, he is head of the occupied territory and 
therefore of the struggle now raging, until a compromise 
leadership arrives and there is a different style. He has 
surrounded himself with advisers who have harmed him and 
distanced him from popular feeling. 
  In the occupied territory everyone bears responsibility. 
Israel prefers civil war and will not leave Gaza in two years 
unless it has set up conditions for civil war. Events 
unfortunately are showing that Fatah youth are clashing with 
each other in Nablus with an Israeli officer reconciling them. 
When Fatah becomes an Israeli demand, the leadership responsible 
for the occupied territory must stop and ask itself where it is 
going. Abu-'Ammar bears the major responsibility for the present 
state of affairs--decline and turning to the enemy to protect 
themselves from their own flesh and blood. This is something 
critical. 
  [AL-SHARQ] There are doubts about the role of the 
Palestinian 
police in the autonomous stage in suppressing the opposition and 
therefore that civil war may break out. What is your opinion? 
  [Zaki] I do not think civil war will break out. The 
patriotic 
side will be in the Palestinian police, or will be most 
prominent. Anyone who wagers that the police will be oriented 
toward Israel is wrong. I am confident that civil war will not 
take place with the authority. However, the enemy and the 
decline in Fatah are working for the premise. The role of the 
police is to protect the Palestinian establishment; it is to 
serve the people, not to terrorize and pressure the people. 
  [AL-SHARQ] Some see the Jordanian-Palestinian economic 
agreement as cutting off the way to the establishment of a 
Palestinian state in the future. What do you think of the idea? 
  [Zaki] On the contrary, any Jordanian-Palestinian agreement 
protects what remains of the Palestinians and also prevents the 
Zionist urge to expand. In the past, we were up against Rabin, 
who was able to wipe out a military force here or there. Today, 
however, we are up against Peres, who wipes out entire peoples 
and states by virtue of his economic program. We think there is 
a valuable strategic convergence due to factors of interest, 
necessity, history, and geography. It demands that we be on the 
side of Jordan, not of Israel. This agreement strengthens the 
establishment of a Palestinian state. All this depends on the 
establishment of a monetary authority, also the establishment of 
a Palestinian national authority. 
  [AL-SHARQ] Many politicians have seen some sort of link 
between you and the creation of the Arab Islamic Party (Haqq). 
Are these reports true? 
  [Zaki] First, I am committed to Fatah. I think that Fatah is 
the shortest way to Palestine. Fatah's mission will exist as 
long as the occupation exists. In other words, it is a national 
liberation movement. However, I in Fatah am not against any 
reserve force, though one should bear in mind that I have no 
contacts with the Arab Islamic Party or knowledge of its 
figures. There is no truth to the relationship with it that has 
been attributed to me. Let anyone who wants to form any party 
leave Fatah. We believe in political pluralism. We welcome any 
parties, provided that they are engaged and call for national 
unity. We welcome any flower that blooms--but in the independent 
Palestinian garden! 
  [AL-SHARQ] Chairman 'Arafat recently made a visit to Saudi 
Arabia. What price did he pay to obtain Saudi support? The 
newspapers have informed us that Saudi Arabia is ready to give 
aid. 
  [Zaki] We were unaware that the matter had reached a 
conclusion. We have not been informed of the conditions to which 
he agreed. We have not heard about anything. 
  [AL-SHARQ] If peace treaties between the Arab rulers and 
Israel are reached, do you expect there to be a historic popular 
reconciliation between the Arab peoples and Israel, or just a 
truce? 
  [Zaki] We think there will be a truce for another battle, 
because it is not possible for the usurper and the victim to 
cooperate with each other. The path of making peace and the 
management of the process have not emerged from convictions. The 
strong imposes his conditions on the weak. The Gulf war was a 
defeat for the Arab nation. Now the strong wants the Arabs to 
pay the price of this defeat. So this is all a payment that has 
fallen due. Those at work in this field are not men of peace. 
They are of different sorts; even if they talk about peace, 
inwardly they are something else. The situation is leading to a 
truce, rather than peace. Al-Sadat made peace, but the Egyptian 
people still reject normalization. The people will never be like 
sheep. They will not throw away their land if their leaders 
throw it away. We see broad smiles from the negotiators, and at 
the same time we see murder and street fighting with knives 
every day. They have not been dazzled by the presence of 'Arafat 
and the Palestinian leadership in Washington wearing a gold 
medal with Israel. This is a people that does not stoop and does 
not fear. Its will is strong. God willing, the inevitability of 
victory is near. It is revolution until victory.

<F P=106> [Interview of Palestinian officials, Ilyas Frayj, Muhammad </F>
al-Nazal, Ghassan al-Khatib, Muhammad Ghunaym, Dawud al-Tilhami, 
Dr. 'Awwad M. 'Awwad, Dr. Fathi al-Shaqaqi, Zuhayr al-Rayyis, 
Wahid al-Hamdulillah, and 'Azmi al-Shu'aybi; place and date not 
given; by 'Ali Salih: "Arms Phenomenon in Occupied Territories 
Greatly Blown Out of Proportion"] 
  [Text] Even if the spread of weapons in the occupied 
territories, specifically in Gaza and Jericho, is not as great 
as newspaper reports claim, it has become a phenomenon that 
demands attention, study, and debate, as well as treatment. The 
importance and gravity of the situation lies in the upcoming 
Israeli withdrawal from Gaza and Jericho, and the implementation 
of autonomy in those two areas, with the start of the five-year 
transitional phase, according to the Declaration of Principles 
(the Oslo Accord) signed in the White House garden last 13 
September. Its importance and gravity also lie in the fact that 
some people anticipate that it could--if it continues--lead to a 
civil war along the lines of what happened in Afghanistan or 
Somalia. 
  There may be a good deal of exaggeration in such 
expectations, as many Palestinians say, both supporters and 
opponents of the accord. They attribute it to various causes: 
the nature of the Palestinian people, their level of political 
awareness, and the fact that the Israelis will not be 
withdrawing completely from the occupied territories. Hence the 
spread of this quantity of arms (between 10-15,000 weapons, 
according to one Fatah official), especially in the Gaza Strip. 
The fact that these arms are reaching the hands of citizens, 
wary of the future and afraid of the unknown, creates fear and 
unease among those who hope that this will not lead to a civil 
war, or to armed clashes between factions--or even inside a 
single organization, to settle old scores. They could be used 
for revenge, armed robbery, and theft, which have recently been 
on the rise. And then there is Israel's attempt to exploit the 
situation, stir up trouble, and use their agents to foil the 
autonomy experiment. 
  In order to shed some light on this phenomenon, AL-SHARQ 
AL-AWSAT asked Palestinian officials from six major Palestinian 
factions and parties, plus some independent figures, a number of 
questions about the extent of the spread of arms, the reasons, 
motives, consequences, the sources of the arms, and the role of 
the Palestinian police in containing them. 
  What follows are the replies AL-SHARQ AL-AWSAT received from 
Muhammad Ghunaym (Abu-Mahir), mobilization and organization 
officer and Fatah Central Committee member in Tunis; Hamas's 
Amman representative, Muhammad al-Nazal; Dawud al-Tilhami, 
member of the politburo of the Democratic Front for the 
Liberation of Palestine in Damascus; Ghassan al-Khatib, a senior 
official in the People's Party in Jerusalem; 'Azmi al-Shu'aybi, 
member of the politburo of the Democratic Palestinian Union 
(DPU) in Jerusalem; Dr. Fathi al-Shaqaqi, secretary general of 
the Islamic Jihad Movement in Damascus; Dr. 'Awwad Muhammad 
'Awwad, a doctor by profession and well-known national figure, 
from Tulkarm; Bethlehem Mayor Ilyas Frayj (Independent); Wahid 
al-Hamdulillah, a well-known independent national figure, and a 
member of the Board of Regents of al-Najah University in Nablus; 
and Zuhayr al-Rayyis, a writer, journalist, nationally known 
figure, and prominent personality in the Gaza Strip. 
  [Salih] How widespread are weapons in the occupied 
territories? Is it as great as the newspapers say? 
  [Abu Mahir (Fatah)] There are an estimated 10-15,000 
weapons--and that could rise--mostly in the Gaza Strip. 
  [Al-Nazal (Hamas)] I doubt that there is any great spread of 
arms. It is extremely difficult to obtain arms to fight the 
occupation, and this is a major obstacle. We have reports that 
confirm that the allegations about the abnormal spread of arms 
are untrue. 
  [Al-Khatib (People's Party)] There is a widespread, 
large-scale spread of arms, particularly in the Gaza Strip, and 
in the occupied territories as a whole. It is not only a problem 
of the extent of the spread, but of the lack of any control over 
who is stockpiling these arms. Of course, some political 
organizations obtain arms, but there are also other groups and 
individuals that get them if they can afford them. 
  [Dawud al-Tilhami (DFLP)] Perhaps there is some exaggeration 
about the volume of arms in the occupied territories, especially 
in Gaza. This exaggeration is intended to create a climate of 
fear for the residents of Gaza at a time when the occupation 
forces are preparing to pull out of the cities and camps and 
redeploy in the sites specified in the Cairo accord between 
'Arafat and Peres. 
  [Al-Shu'aybi (DPU)] The spread of arms is relative to how it 
was in the past. What is remarkable is the transformation in 
this phenomenon now, to a virtually public one, especially in 
the Gaza Strip. One cannot speak of this type of phenomenon 
existing in the West Bank. But there is a noticeable increase in 
the buying and selling of arms, and a boldness in carrying them. 
  [Al-Shaqaqi (Islamic Jihad)] The spread of arms is aimed at 
the Gaza Strip and to a lesser extent the city of Nablus in the 
West Bank. This is not new, nor is it on the scale alleged by 
newspaper reports. What is new is the openness with which people 
are bearing arms, especially Fatah members. This comes after the 
Oslo accord, whereby the authorities no longer hold Fatah people 
responsible specifically for bearing arms. Some families 
historically known for owning arms, for trading in them, or 
other purposes, are no longer afraid to display them. Most of 
them are small, light arms; and, by our estimate, do not exceed 
the volume of the arms in the hands of all the factions and 
families, by more than a few hundred weapons. 
  [Dr. 'Awwad (Independent)] There are several reasons why 
arms 
are more widespread in the Gaza Strip than in the West Bank, but 
there are no precise estimates about this. Regarding the spread 
of arms in Gaza in particular, it is now said jokingly that arms 
are sold by the bushel, like fruits and vegetables in Gaza. But 
the truth is that there is a noticeable rise in armament, with 
hundreds of guns like Kalashnikovs, Uzis, and pistols reaching 
Gaza. 
  [Frayj (Independent)] There is no accurate information about 
the volume of arms. Talk on this subject is exaggerated. 
  [Al-Hamdulillah (Independent)] Where there is smoke, there 
is 
fire. Guns have begun to appear openly, especially in the Gaza 
Strip, and much more widely than was normal in the years of 
intifadah. But the reports being circulated are not accurate, 
and do not present a reliable or realistic picture. 
  [Al-Rayyis (Independent)] This phenomenon has become clear 
and well known; it has been acknowledged by Israeli Prime 
Minister Yitzhaq Rabin in official reports. I believe that the 
quantities of arms in people's hands are increasing day by day 
despite the continuous warnings of the danger of this phenomenon 
and the negative effects it might have, especially in Gaza. 
  [Salih] The causes and motives behind the spread of arms--do 
the factions have a hand in this? 
  [Abu Mahir] There are many and varied reasons for this 
phenomenon, which I would summarize as follows: 
  First: the occupation, and its continued presence during the 
transitional period, and our people's belief that there will be 
no withdrawal unless the enemy is forced out, by force of arms. 
Second: the sense of a need for protection from settler attacks 
and their crimes, which now occur under the very noses of the 
occupation soldiers. Third: the attacks of armed gangs on people 
and property, and crimes committed by people claiming to belong 
to Palestinian factions. Fourth: the spread of rumors about 
interfactional fighting once the transitional period begins. 
  [Al-Nazal] We believe that the most important reason for the 
purchase of arms is confrontation with the occupation 
authorities. And I repeat that there is no phenomenon of 
widespread arms. 
  [Al-Khatib] There are a number of reasons for the spread of 
arms. First, their availibility from Israeli sources, through 
the black market, and the underworld (gangs) in Israel. Second, 
citizens' feelings of insecurity and unease. Third, the 
uncertain future. Fourth, the existence of rivalry, at times, 
among political factions. Fifth, Israel's reduction of 
monitoring and punishment of people transporting arms or 
possessing them, especially in Gaza. [Al-Tilhami] Naturally, 
a large number of intifadah fighters had arms, especially in the 
last three years. This was a distinct increase, to confront the 
occupation. In recent months, especially after the Oslo accord, 
there have been more guns in Gaza, both smuggled in from Sinai 
or bought from arms dealing networks in the occupied 
territories. Of course, in light of the mounting chaos in Gaza, 
it was natural for organized Palestinian forces to provide the 
arms necessary for self-defense against occupation attacks, 
settler operations, or occupation agents. We do not rule out 
that the Israelis, using their access to arms-dealing networks, 
might be trying to turn political disputes among the factions 
into armed clashes. This is something we seriously and firmly 
warn against. 
  [Al-Shu'aybi] Historically, the national movement has sought 
to obtain arms to use them in militant operations. They used to 
smuggle the arms in. In recent years, faced with the difficulty 
of smuggling, they have resorted to obtaining arms from Israeli 
dealers in the underworld. They get arms stolen from Israeli 
camps. After the Madrid negotiations and Israel's willingness to 
withdraw from Gaza, the Israeli fist began to get lax in its 
rule and control, and this phenomenon encouraged a large number 
of people to buy arms and start dealing in them. The state of 
intensified polarization among factions after Madrid and Oslo 
aided the wish to strengthen every faction, and very openly, in 
society, to increase the trafficking, and sometimes the 
transport of arms stocks in the West Bank and Gaza directly to 
the market for sale. They took advantage of the high prices that 
resulted from the worsened financial conditions of many social 
factions and faction members, after the PLO cut off their 
financial aid. 
  [Al-Shaqaqi] The enemy is helping Fatah to get weapons for 
its members, since these arms no longer pose a threat to 
[Israel]. Some Fatah elements have begun to traffic in arms. 
There are other fighting factions who want to buy arms, either 
to fight the enemy or for self-defense. This is rather limited, 
because arms are expensive and there is a limited supply. On the 
other hand, some families have begun to fear for the lives of 
their children in the coming phase, about which nothing is 
clear. So they want to protect themselves. Some of these 
families previously owned guns, which they are now bringing out 
to use in familial or organizational problems. 
  [Dr. 'Awwad] I think the main reason for the spread of arms 
is to settle scores, for self-defense, and the political 
struggle within some of the major groups in the PLO. There are 
scores to be settled among families and organizations, in 
addition to fear and the wish for self-defense: fear of a 
security vacuum when the withdrawal begins. These reasons have 
led some persons to leave Gaza for Egypt until things settle 
down. 
  [Frayj] I think it unlikely that the factions have any 
desire 
to see arms spread. 
  [Al-Hamdulillah] We in the occupied territories accuse the 
occupation authorities and their intelligence service of playing 
a secret and dangerous role in the spread of this phenomenon. 
These authorities have recently begun to arm their collaborators 
more openly, and on a wider scale, to defend themselves, instead 
of moving them behind the so-called Green Line [pre-1967 
border]. There is no doubt, however, that the "transfer of 
authority," which has not yet occurred, may be seen as one of 
the major causes for this phenomenon. Add to that the family 
feuds, the assassination of collaborators, and the rivalry over 
power centers. All these have made some people keep guns handy 
for self-defense. Some others, of course, carry guns to combat 
the occupation. In short, the policy of the occupation 
authorities, and the vacuum created after the withdrawal, could 
result, some believe, in an interest in guns stemming from fear 
of the future. I personally do not think that the factions have 
any hand in this. 
  [Al-Rayyis] The diverse factions have their own reasons and 
motives that compel them to stockpile what arms they can gather. 
This is in spite of the constant assurances that there will be 
no fighting among brothers, and that the government will be 
reasonable and logical. But what makes the situation dangerous 
is the spread of arms among ordinary citizens, who imagine that 
these weapons are necessary to safeguard their security and 
safety, and to confront the unknown. 
  [Salih] What are the sources of these arms? 
  [Abu Mahir] Recently, most arms have come from southern 
Lebanon via arms dealers, and through collusion with occupation 
officers. 
  [Al-Nazal] There are numerous sources for obtaining arms. It 
varies from faction to faction. Hamas's principal source of arms 
is the occupation soldiers killed by al-Qassam heroes, who take 
their guns. 
  [Al-Khatib] Israel is encouraging this phenomenon. 
  [Al-Tilhami] As I mentioned previously, most of these arms 
come from arms dealers and even the occupation soldiers, some of 
whom sell arms for material gain. There is a certain quantity of 
arms smuggled in from Sinai. 
  [Al-Shu'aybi] In the Likud era, Israel made it easy for some 
of the groups opposed to PLO factions to obtain small arms, 
specifically in the Gaza Strip. The negotiations encouraged 
Palestinians and Israelis to start trafficking in arms across 
the Egyptian border. 
  [Al-Shaqaqi] We believe that the phenomenon is a limited 
one. 
It is not as newspaper reports portray it. The supply is meager, 
and the high prices are staggering. The cost of a gun, since the 
signing of the Oslo Accord, has not gone down one cent. The 
price of a revolver is the equivalent of $3,000. A Kalashnikov 
is $7,000, and a U.S.-made M-16 is at least $10,000. The sources 
of the guns are as follows: 
  1. The theft of Israeli-owned cars, especially in the 
territories occupied since 1948; most of these cars have guns 
inside. 
  2. Arms smuggling over the Egyptian border. 
  3. Drug dealers who trade drugs to Israeli soldiers in 
exchange for their guns, which are then sold. 
  4. Some bedouin in Beersheba have family connections in Gaza 
and bring arms to their relatives. 
  5. Arms stolen from Israeli army stockpiles or settlements. 
  6. Arms stored since 1967, which are reappearing now. These 
are Egyptian guns whose owners want to sell them and profit from 
high prices before it is too late and they lose their value. 
  [Dr. 'Awwad] There are a number of sources. There are 
Israeli 
arms dealers, well known to the Israeli authorities. There are 
arms stockpiles collected over the long years for use at the 
proper time, which for some has now arrived. And there are arms 
smuggled over the Egyptian border. 
  [Frayj] If the reports are true, the people fueling this 
phenomenon are the enemies of the Palestinian people. 
  [Al-Hamdulillah] In my view, the sources are restricted to 
the following: the remainder of the arms left behind by the Arab 
armies in the 1967 war; guns smuggled over the borders of Egypt, 
Syria, Lebanon, and Jordan; and Israeli sources, including the 
arming of collaborators. 
  [Al-Rayyis] Recently a gun-toting Palestinian youth was 
shown 
on Israeli television answering a reporter's question by saying 
that, since it is now possible to move people and cars in and 
out of Gaza, it isn't difficult to take in a little gun that 
could easily be hidden, from any source, and by any means. It 
may be said that the arms sources are the Israeli intelligence 
services, Israeli soldiers, the bedouin, and smuggling from 
Jordan and the Sinai. 
  [Salih] What might be the outcome of this spread of arms? 
Could it reach the point of civil war, as some reports say? 
  [Abu Mahir] Apart from the motives of those who promote 
guns, 
or facilitate their supply to citizens, these arms are patriotic 
and Palestinian when possessed by our people. They will 
eventually be used against the soldiers of the occupation and 
the settlers. There is no danger of gun ownership leading to a 
civil war, because a gun by itself is not a condition for civil 
war, which has its own causes, terms, and motives. These factors 
and conditions do not exist. There are no ethnic divisions or 
sectarian conflicts among our people. Guns in our people's hands 
frighten the occupation soldiers, settlers, and agents, and give 
citizens self-confidence, especially when security is lacking, 
as is the case before the transfer of power to the Palestinians. 
  [Al-Nazal] I do not believe that combatants bearing arms 
against the occupation will lead to civil war. I believe in the 
good sense and ethics of our people in managing and solving its 
problems. Times past are the best proof of this. The strange 
thing here is that one political movement--in support of the 
Oslo and Cairo accords, that is, 'Arafat's group--is behind the 
allegations about the abnormal spread of arms, and its being 
blown out of proportion in the media. We have not heard anything 
about there being something scary about the spread of arms from 
any opposition faction. In addition, exaggeration is part of the 
campaign 'Arafat's group is waging to get wanted persons to turn 
themselves in, along with their guns, to the occupation 
authorities. 
  [Al-Khatib] It is to be feared that this phenomenon may 
increase the chances that people will resort to arms in any 
political or tribal, or even personal, dispute. There is also 
the danger of the spread of vendettas and vengeance, especially 
given the assassination of those accused of collaborating, 
without any trial or investigation of the charge, in most cases. 
Finally, there is the likelihood that it will be difficult to 
control the situation when the PLO and the Palestinian police go 
into Gaza. I believe that this is Israel's goal in encouraging 
this phenomenon. 
  [Al-Tilhami] We do not rule out that the occupation 
authorities might intend to "Somaliaize" or "Afghanize" the Gaza 
Strip, and create violent anarchy and civil war in order to keep 
Palestinian forces opposed to the Oslo-Cairo accords from 
continuing their resistance to the occupation. It would also 
weaken the uprising against the occupation and give the 
impression that the Palestinian people are unable to handle 
their political relations and disputes in a rational manner. For 
our part, we will foil the Israeli plans and do everything in 
our power to prevent a civil war. We will keep all guns pointed 
at the enemy, and keep political disputes within limits, giving 
the masses a voice in them. 
  [Al-Shu'aybi] The spread of this phenomenon, apart from its 
direct aims, behind which some of the Israeli security services 
may lurk, is an attempt to position its aims and outcomes 
negatively, to hasten the outbreak of internecine fighting, and 
create an unstable social situation, preventing the natural 
transformation of Palestinian society into an independent state, 
and to push the people into accepting any solution, even an 
annexationist one. Particularly as the trial run will be in Gaza 
and can affect the people's position in the West Bank later, and 
in the diaspora too. It would be hard for a civil war to break 
out between factions, because public opinion is against it. But 
it would be possible to cause family conflicts and at times 
internal fighting, within a single faction. 
  [Al-Shaqaqi] The existence of a few hundred guns cannot 
ignite a civil war. If families feel that their children are 
safe, there will be no danger in these families owning guns. But 
we must consider that some of these families have members with 
differing organizational loyalties and affiliations. This is 
especially true with families loyal to the opposition because of 
their members' loyalties. Here the autonomous authority comes 
into play. If it behaves as an oppressive power, as many fear it 
will, then the problems will come to a head--but I rule out 
civil war. There is another point I want to explain, that the 
Israeli army has acted officially so far to spread arms; yes, it 
has eased up a little in some areas. But not to the point of 
being responsible for spreading the phenomenon. If that were the 
case, there would be more guns and they would be cheaper. I am 
afraid that the Isareli army's accusation is the prelude to 
repression of those who are bearing arms against the enemy 
today, and buy them with their food money, or their children's, 
to defend their country and their land. 
  [Dr. 'Awwad] Armed struggles and internal purges within 
major 
organizations have been attributed to this phenomenon. This 
phenomenon will serve to increase the opposition's armed 
operations against settlers and the Israeli army when the 
withdrawal begins. The spread of arms will escalate the armed 
struggle between supporters and opponents of the settlement. 
These confrontations could escalate into a civil war in the 
event the Palestinian authority is unable to create political 
channels for solving disputes by democratic means. 
  [Frayj] It makes no sense whatsoever for Palestinian 
factions 
to ignite a civil war. 
  [Al-Hamdulillah] I would like to say, frankly and with 
certainty, that we do not sense or see any competition or 
rivalry in the occupied territories, or any struggle to obtain 
arms. So I do not agree with those who are afraid that this will 
lead to a civil war. Everyone knows that the enemy is present 
there, and not moving. I do not believe that the Palestinian 
sides will lose their reason or rationality. This does not mean 
that there may not be some undesirable and unacceptable, or even 
dangerous practices and violations. But the occupiers' desire 
for Palestinian infighting and civil war will not be satisfied. 
Our people, suffering under occupation, and following the course 
of events silently, will not forgive those who harm or squander 
their rights. 
  [Al-Rayyis] The spread of arms is pushing events to the edge 
of the abyss, and raises doubts about all the assurances about 
good intentions and the genuine desire for a solution to 
conflicts through dialogue, with higher interests prevailing. 
After that, the discipline we need becomes difficult and will 
require redoubled efforts on the part of everyone who wants to 
avoid collapse and deterioration. 
  [Salih] And the role of the Palestinian police in containing 
this phenomenon when they take over security affairs, after the 
evacuation of the Israeli forces from the occupied territories? 
  [Abu Mahir] Unquestionably, when the Palestinian police take 
up their duties, they will have an important and basic role in 
creating an atmosphere of security and stability among citizens. 
They must also build national unity, provide social justice, and 
establish democracy in society and its institutions, and enforce 
the law among the people. These factors will lead to an 
atmosphere of self-control among citizens, helping them to 
control and regulate arms, preventing infractions, and turning 
the arms phenomenon into a positive factor helping the authority 
to establish security and deter violence when Israel withdraws 
its army and settlers from the occupied areas. 
  [Al-Nazal] We are afraid the 'Arafat group's talk about the 
arms phenomenon is just a prelude to the repression of opponents 
and disarming them to prevent them from fighting the enemy, in 
accordance with the promises they made Israel about ceasing 
military operations. I believe that this is the real motivation 
behind this overblown campaign warning of so-called dangers. 
  [Al-Khatib] When the Palestinian police assume their 
security 
responsibilities, they should take arms away from individuals 
and groups, excepting those who have official tasks assigned 
them by the government or the security service. There must be 
strict controls on the transport and possession of arms. Most 
importantly, a feeling of security must be created for citizens, 
to put an end to any motive for possessing or using arms. 
  [Al-Tilhami] We are afraid, after reading the provisions of 
the Oslo and Cairo accords, that the so-called Palestinian 
police will be entrusted with the mission of repressing the 
intifadah and the people. This is something the occupation 
forces have been unable to do for the more than six years of the 
intifadah. We do not rule out that the promotion of anarchy, 
criminality, theft, and the terrorizing of citizens in Gaza 
might open the way for the Palestinian group that signed the 
Oslo and Cairo accords to be put to the test, controlling the 
intifadah and repressing its people. This is what makes us fear 
the content and provisions of those two accords, to which we are 
totally opposed. They do not ensure withdrawal from the occupied 
territories. So we will work with all opposition patriotic and 
Islamic forces, groups, and persons, including members of Fatah 
and the Palestine People's Party who oppose the Cairo accord, in 
order to reject this mission entrusted to the so-called 
Palestinian police. We reject the transformation of this body 
into an instrument of oppression against the people, to serve a 
plan to repress the intifadah and provide security for the 
occupation, instad of eradicating it. 
  [Al-Shu'aybi] The Palestinian police, in the context of 
public law and order, will limit the consequences of arms 
purchasing, even if they cannot put an end to arms purchasing 
itself. 
  [Dr. 'Awwad] The Palestinian authority will not succeed in 
collecting arms from organizations and the populace, because 
that would lead to a clash that would not be in its interest. 
Plus the fact that disarming the opposition would be seen as 
cooperation and collusion with Israel. That would certainly lead 
to an open confrontation between the authority and opposition 
forces. 
  [Frayj] [He did not respond to this question.] 
  [Al-Hamdulillah] This question would be better put to the 
leadership that concluded the Oslo accord with Israel, and 
subsequently the Cairo accord, on forming the Palestinian police 
and the missions with which the Israelis entrusted them. So 
excuse me for not answering this question. 
  [Al-Rayyis] The ordinary Palestinians look very positively 
upon the Palestinian police and have great hope in it. They have 
confidence that they will represent discipline, the law, and 
human rights, and with the same strength and to the same degree, 
they see them as a force for maintaining public order, and not 
just the system of autonomy.

<F P=106> [Article by C.S.: "Two Frenchmen Assassinated in Algiers </F>
After Protestors Demonstrate Against Islamists"] 
  [Text] Algerian authorities announced on Wednesday, 23 
March, that two Frenchmen, Roger-Michel Drouaier and his son 
Pascal-Valery, were assassinated Tuesday evening in an Algiers 
suburb. Several hours earlier, some tens of thousands of 
persons, a majority of them women, staged a demonstration 
against the Islamists. The demonstrators criticed authorities 
for failure to move more boldly against the Islamist movements 
and reaffirmed their rejection of any "dialogue" with those 
elements. 
  On Tuesday, 22 March, Roger-Michel Drouaier, a partner in a 
private enterprise, and his son Pascal-Valery, 24, were murdered 
"with weapons of cold steel by five terrorists" in their 
Birkhadem home on the southern outskirts of Algiers, the 
security services announced on Wednesday. The double 
assassination brings to 32--including eight Frenchmen--the 
number of foreigners who have fallen victim to terrorists in 
Algeria in the last six months. 
  On the very day of this latest attack, a march against 
Islamist terrorism was held in Algiers at the instigation of 
womens' associations. According to the most reliable estimates, 
20,000-50,000 people participated in the demonstration, although 
public-service national radio put the number of participants at 
150,000. Two party leaders--Said Sadi, secretary general of the 
Rally for Culture and Democracy (RCD), and Hachemi Cherif, 
secretary-general of the Ettahaddi (communist) party--were seen 
marching alongside other organizers of the event. 
  With shouts of, "Too much blood, too many tears, together 
let 
us save Algeria!," "Women deserve respect and reject 
subjugation!", and even "Free and democratic Algeria!", the 
demonstrators started at the Advanced College of Fine Arts 
(whose director was assassinated, along with his son, on 5 
March) and proceeded slowly up the boulevard leading to Addis 
Ababa Square, where the official National Human Rights 
Observation Post (ONDH) is situated. 
  Some groups of demonstrators chanted slogans that were even 
more policy-prescriptive: "No mercy or dialogue with killers!", 
"To negotiate with the Islamic Salvation Front (FIS) is to 
negotiate the army's surrender!" 
  These latter slogans directly echoed the position taken by a 
part of the French-language press that is opposed to any 
dialogue with the Islamist movement and that is sounding the 
alarm, more and more openly, of the possible breakup of the 
Army. However, one of the demonstrators' posters appealed to the 
"state president," General Liamine Zeroual, for "a progressive, 
democratic, open, and tolerant Algeria" and proclaimed the 
rejection of "exile," "submission," and "compromise." Strict 
security precautions were taken to protect the demonstration, 
with several riot squad vans stationed nearby and policemen 
posted on rooftops overlooking the marchers to surveil the crowd 
and vicinity. Similar marches were held the same day in Oran 
(west), Constantine, Annaba (east), Tizi-Ouzou, and Bejaia 
(Kabylia). Although not explicitly endorsing the demonstrations, 
labor leaders with the General Union of Algerian Workers (UGTA) 
and the Union of Public-Sector Entrepreneurs (UNEP) called a 
work stoppage as a gesture of "mourning" and tribute to the 
victims of Islamist terrorism. Activity in most government 
offices, as well as in banks and the transport sector, was 
sharply reduced by the one-day strike. Algiers, for once, looked 
like a dead city. 
  It could be misleading to compare this womens' march with a 
similar event mounted just a year ago by UGTA, which drew 
100,000 participants. The reduced participation in the latest 
demonstration largely reflects the sharp escalation of violence 
over the last six months and the climate of terror that has 
reigned since early February. In a joint editorial entitled: 
"Three Questions to Our Leaders," 13 daily newspapers and 
periodicals have publicly demanded that the head of state answer 
such questions as: "Does `dialogue' apply to the fundamentalists 
or to the productive sectors of society? What is the social 
model our leaders are trying to realize? How far are they 
prepared to go in its pursuit? To the point of bloodbath?" They 
called for an "official response" from President Zeroual. The 
editors also decided to hold a strike next Saturday and Sunday 
to protest a Monday, 21 March, terrorist attack on HEBDO 
LIBERE's headquarters that killed two employees. 
<H5>  Death Toll </H5>
  The 22 March killing of two Frenchmen in the suburbs of 
Algiers has raised the toll of foreigners assassinated in 
Algeria over the last six months to 32, including eight 
Frenchmen. 
  Several incidents in the last few weeks have deepened 
anxiety 
among members of the French community still in the country. For 
example, a French gendarme out of uniform was recently attacked 
in downtown Annaba, miraculously escaping the bullets of his 
assailants. A Frenchwoman residing in Algiers was kidnapped and 
held prisoner for several hours before being released unharmed. 
Finally one of her attackers, who had not recognized her at 
first, introduced herself as "her neighbor" and released the 
Frenchwoman.

  [Excerpt] Security forces have uncovered a factory, owned 
by a citizen, which manufactures weapons and ammunition in the 
town of Salamun, Tima district of the Sawhaj governorate. 
  The factory owner, Zaydan al-Sayyid Mutawalli, who was 
arrested in his town, acknowledged during his questioning that 
extremists make piecemeal purchases of the factory's ammunition, 
machine guns, and handguns and use them to conduct terrorist 
operations against the police and, in other cases, tourist 
steamboats. Security forces arrested five terrorists who 
admitted that they were partners of the three who had been 
arrested on one of the public buses in the city of Asyut while 
traveling from Sawhaj to Cairo to bomb some movie theaters. 
  An official security source said that the five terrorists 
were preparing to travel to the capital and that an amount of 
explosives and documents identifying as bomb sites the cinema 
houses that are showing the movie "The Terrorist" were 
confiscated. 
  The source added that the police are tightening security on 
all movie theaters to prevent their being targetted for any 
attack by terrorists. [passage omitted]

<F P=106> [Article by Mustafa al-Basyuni: "Profiting From Science and </F>
Technology"] 
  [Text] National industry needs more effort and input. It is 
waiting for factories to be modernized and developed and for an 
improvement in the quality of production in order to confront 
foreign competition that has surpassed anything ever imagined. 
  Made in Egypt cannot remain a slogan without work 
to protect it--work in which all efforts and skills join in a 
concern for overall quality levels, technological development, 
and greater linkage between centers of scientific research and 
the various means of production. 
  We must learn from foreign expertise and modern designs. The 
Egyptian work force must be trained in the most modern packing 
and preserving methods that science has developed so that we can 
break into the world's markets and compete at home. 
  We should be interested in good marketing, which has become 
an independent science in most of the world's countries; yet we 
still neglect it, despite the importance of this aspect of 
selling products. 
  There must be skilled and honest oversight to prevent 
adventurers from playing with the reputation of Egyptian 
production. Tariffs should be increased on fully manufactured 
goods that have a counterpart in Egypt. Tax exemptions for 
investors should be bolstered. 
  Engineer Fu'ad Abu-Zaghlah, chairman of the committee on 
energy and industry at the National [Democratic] Party's [NDP] 
general secretariat, spoke first. He said that the trade 
liberalization that most countries of the world have pursued has 
caused a kind of intense competition to improve production 
quality. It has increased the responsibility of private and 
joint-sector factories and of the business sector to take an 
interest in quality levels and reduced costs. This requires that 
management leaders with open minds be chosen who consider all 
ways to implement a system of overall quality. 
  He declared that the coming period will require increased 
interest in technological development and greater linkage 
between scientific research centers and the various means of 
production in order to avoid traditionalism and bring about 
modernization and improved quality in various manufactured goods. 
  Employees in the bodies that oversee industries must be 
chosen from those who possess a good technical and ethical level 
so that we can guarantee that measures are taken to prevent 
illegitimate marketing methods, such as flooding the market or 
using devious means to smuggle goods that do not conform to 
specifications. 
<H5>  Smuggling </H5>
  Abu-al-Sa'ud Sultan, head of the exporters' section, pointed 
out that Egyptian industry needs protection from dumping, the 
smuggling game, and false invoices that are presented to 
customs. Oversight bodies of ability and honesty must be 
established, because total freedom without order and discipline 
and without state supervision gives an opportunity to 
speculators, swindlers, and adventurers at the expense of 
serious investors and producers. 
  He stressed the need to treat Egyptian production as foreign 
production is treated in its country. The Egyptian producer must 
enjoy the same privileges that the foreign producer enjoys. 
There must be concern for industrial oversight and in developing 
its role, so as to maintain the level of the Egyptian product. 
Duties should be increased on fully manufactured goods that have 
a local counterpart, tax exemptions for investors should be 
increased, and the banks should give more low-interest loans for 
infrastructure development. 
  He added that Egyptian factories must be refurbished and 
modernized, with the banks participating by means of 
low-interest loans. The latest methods of modern technology 
should be adopted, and personnel and specialists should be 
trained in these methods. 
<H5>  Two Lines of Protection </H5>
  Engineer Hasan 'Aqil, director of the factories section of 
the National Plastic Company, said that the protection of 
Egyptian industry should proceed along two lines. 
  First, customs should be raised on imported products that 
have a good local counterpart. Opening the door completely will 
tend to injure many manufacturing projects that have begun to 
export their product, thus threatening to halt these projects, 
particularly textiles, plastics, and chemical industries. The 
technological level of local factories is still modest compared 
to world factories, and this will affect the quality and 
competitiveness of the Egyptian product. 
  The second line is to modernize Egyptian factories so as to 
raise quality and lower costs. In this way the Egyptian consumer 
will be given an opportunity to prefer Egyptian products. 
  'Abbudah 'Azzam, a textile factory owner from Shubra 
al-Khaymah, believes that the problem of Egyptian production 
lies in low customs duties on foreign products, high taxes on 
Egyptian factories, and the haphazard judgment of officials. 
These things tend to impede production and hinder its 
development. 
  He stated that the smuggling of foreign products is another 
challenge now facing Egyptian industry. The competition is 
unequal: these countries are known to be countries with enormous 
production, and as the volume of production increases, the cost 
per unit decreases. 
  Also, the governments of these countries subsidize their 
industries so that they can invade foreign markets. These are 
things we must take into account. 
  Hisham Hajjaj, a businessman, said that some Egyptian 
products are superior to imports, but they lack packaging and 
advertising. Egyptian producers should take an interest in these 
aspects to assure international competitiveness. 
  He indicated that Egyptian production now faces many 
difficulties, especially taxes, marketing, and bureaucratic 
obstacles when the time to export comes. 
  Dr. Fawzi Babawi, a member of the NDP's economic committee, 
thinks that Egyptian industry need not fear international 
competition. On the contrary, such competition might help it 
develop itself and prove its quality, provided that the 
competition is honest--meaning that the importation of good 
products of confirmed origin should be allowed, while products 
of unknown origin should not be allowed. 
  He stressed the need to benefit from foreign expertise and 
modern designs. Egyptian personnel must be trained in the most 
modern packing, preserving, and advertising methods that science 
has developed. 
  He indicated that confronting foreign industries must 
concentrate on modernizing factories and supporting investments 
earmarked for that purpose. Part of the participation in 
development should be offered to employees, so that one does not 
rely completely on loans. 
  He pointed to the pharmaceutical industry's success in 
providing 95 percent of Egypt's medicine needs at prices lower 
than similar foreign-produced drugs. 
  Fahmi al-Suwaydi, an exporter, called for establishing 
regular maritime lines with some of the markets that absorb 
Egyptian exports, such as the African and Arab market. Loading 
and freight charges on ships should be reduced, so that more 
Egyptian products will be exported to these countries.

"Problems of Small Industries"] 
  [Text] Despite all the government's efforts to encourage a 
climate of investment and production, many large and small 
factories still complain of bureaucratic routine, complications 
by minor officials, and a shortage of trained skilled workers 
and production requisites and services in industrial cities. 
  When MAYU went to factory owners and managers, they stated 
that these problems were pulling them back and not pushing them 
ahead, hampering production and leading to marketing 
difficulties and increased prices. 
  In 10th of Ramadan City, Mustafa Fahmi, owner of the 
Egypt-Italy Business Machines Factory, said: "We have many 
bureaucratic problems in the administrative system of 10th of 
Ramadan City. For example, the administration asked for 14,000 
pounds as surety for the building, although the license is sound 
and the buildings conform to specifications. This cripples the 
investor at a time when he is paying taxes and insurance 
payments." 
  He added: "We suffer from the lack of a transportation 
network inside and outside the industrial city. This makes it 
very difficult to transport workers and market the product. It 
creates burdens that lead to increased prices." 
  He indicated that the shortage of trained hands forces him 
to 
turn to Italian expertise to hold continuous courses to train 
workers in modern equipment and advanced technology. 
<H5>  Bureaucracy </H5>
  Engineer Majid al-Sa'dani, director of the TCL industrial 
cleanser factory in 10th of Ramadan City, said that the city 
administration treats people in a disturbingly bureaucratic 
manner. It asks factory owners to do things that are 
unreasonable from the point of view of market mechanisms. 
  He added: "I suffer from a shortage of skilled workers, but 
I 
am trying to overcome it by training trade school certificate 
holders for at least two years so that one can rely on them." 
  He indicated that industrial surveillance was hindering 
investment and creating obstacles. For example, it was asking 
for the scientific names of imported raw materials in Arabic, 
when all the raw materials used in industrial cleansers were 
imported and were difficult to write in Arabic. 
  It was demanding an official photograph and fingerprints 
from 
the factory owner and the warehouse manager and a specification 
of the area of the warehouse, even though a license and tax card 
had already been obtained. This had a negative effect on 
investment operations. 
  He said that the company had been forced to turn to freight 
companies to handle the completion of customs procedures because 
of complications by minor officials. 
<H5>  Problems, Production Requisites </H5>
  Sayyid Muharram, chief of accounts at the Modern Textiles 
Manufacturing Company (Montex), said: "We have many problems 
because of high duties on the already expensive imported raw 
materials that constitute more than 90 percent of production 
requisites. This prevents us from competing with the foreign 
product." 
  He said that the shortage of skilled labor was leading to a 
struggle between different factories to attract skilled workers. 
Workers therefore did not settle down, which in turn affected 
production. 
  Sayyid Muharram demanded protection for the Egyptian 
producer 
and consumer and the provision of favorable conditions for the 
Egyptian producer, as takes place overseas. 
  He indicated that the obstacles to domestic production must 
be overcome in order to attract more capital to invest in Egypt 
and participate in solving the unemployment problem. 
<H5>  Housing, Transportation </H5>
  'Umar al-Faruq 'Abd-al-'Aziz, a member of the authorized 
board of directors at the Dana Ready-Made Clothing Factory, 
agreed with this view. He stated that the most important problem 
facing 10th of Ramadan City was the lack of workers residing in 
the city. The factory has 140 workers, only four of whom live in 
the city; the rest live outside the city. The factory pays large 
amounts of money to transport them to and from the factory. This 
is because housing located in the city is expensive. The down 
payment on a medium-sized apartment is 5,000 pounds, while the 
monthly installment is 196 pounds over 20 years. 
  He called for extending the Cairo-Suez railroad line to 10th 
of Ramadan City and suggested that factory owners contribute to 
this to solve the work force problem. 
  He indicated that duties must be lowered on accessories for 
ready-made clothing, as these were requirements needed to enable 
competition with the foreign product. 
  The chemist Mustafa al-Hinnawi, owner of Gold Star Leather 
Company, declared that production in large factories was 
threatened with stoppage because of small factories that were 
proliferating haphazardly in small rooms and were manufacturing 
certain chemicals without conforming to standard specifications. 
Indeed, they were mixing the chemicals with other substances and 
affixing trademarks to them, thereby causing the domestic 
consumer to prefer the local product [original text language; 
writer probably meant "imported product"] to them, thus 
threatening national industry. 
<H5>  Combatting Commercial Fraud </H5>
  Mustafa al-Hinnawi called for deterrent punishments to 
combat 
commercial fraud and imitation. Such firms should be shut down 
and confiscated. Their licenses, if they had any, should be 
rescinded, as is done in European countries. 
  He stressed that importers of production requisites should 
be 
exempted from duties, so that national industry could compete 
with imports. A sales tax should be added to the flat-rate tax, 
to help lower costs. 
  Mahmud Ghunaym, owner of a textiles factory at al-Qanatir 
al-Khayriyah, said that small factories suffered from lack of 
funding and therefore could not carry out replacement and 
modernization operations due to the high cost of loans--24 
percent of the loan's value. Factory owners therefore are 
inhibited from replacing their old equipment with new modern 
equipment that would help increase production, improve quality, 
and lower the price over the long term. 
  Hajj Kamal 'Abd-al-Basit, owner of a factory in 
al-Sharabiyah, asserted that 12 different kinds of taxes are 
levied on textile factories. The product is therefore encumbered 
with burdens that lead to high prices and difficulty in 
marketing at home and abroad. 
  He noted that in the last 10 years thread prices had risen 
250 percent over 1980 prices. In addition, the business sector 
had abandoned the policy of operating private weaving plants at 
its own expense by the method of providing the plants with 
thread and taking delivery of the cloth at a fixed rate--not to 
mention the irregular deliveries of many varieties of high 
quality thread to private factories. All these things affected 
work and the overseas contracts of these factories. 
  'Abd-al-Fattah Salim, owner of a textiles factory in Shubra 
al-Khaymah, said: "The main problem is a shortage of trained 
technical workers. The big factories attract these workers with 
high salaries that we cannot pay." 
  He asked that trade schools train their students in the 
technical principles of textile manufacturing by practical, 
rather than theoretical, training in the factories next to the 
schools. 
  Muhsin 'Abd-al-Jawad, owner of a factory in Shubra 
al-Khaymah, indicated that the high price of production 
requisites, electricity, taxes, and duties had led to high 
prices on products. It was thus impossible to market the 
product, especially in view of the intense competition with 
large factories that can market their product. 
  He urged the state to concern itself with opening outlets to 
market the production of small factories. 
  Fadil Mustafa Abu-Sinnah, director of a tannery, spoke about 
how problems arose from their not being allowed to import goat 
and cattle skins unobtainable in the country. 
  He said that if these varieties were imported, excellently 
made shoes and genuine leather goods would be available at low 
prices. 
  He added: "We are suffering from lack of chemical factories 
that specialize in dyes, even though some engineers specialized 
in this field are working in this industry in overseas 
factories."

<F P=106> [Article by Mustafa al-Basyuni and 'Adil 'Abd-al-Karim: </F>
"Open Importation Greatest Danger"] 
  [Text] Businessmen stated that opening wide the door to 
importation without controls greatly threatens Egyptian industry. 
  They indicated that credits must be given and duties eased 
on 
production requisites. The Egyptian producer must be granted the 
privileges that his foreign counterpart enjoys. 
  They demanded that the Egyptian product be improved and that 
the relative advantage of the human factor be exploited. 
  Dr. Samir Tubar, chairman of the NDP's [National Democratic 
Party] economic committee, indicated that the main directions of 
the economic reform program focus on appealing to market 
mechanisms and interfering with pricing only in fortuitous 
circumstances such as dumping and attempts to harm national 
industry by unfair means. 
<H5>  Competition Desirable </H5>
  He said that the government might intervene to protect 
products in the first years, but it was improper for the state 
to keep interfering, or it would harm the national interest. One 
must therefore work efficiently to produce goods that can 
compete with foreign goods, increase the efficiency of 
industrial establishments, promote training, benefit from the 
area in which Egypt enjoys a relative advantage, improve 
quality, and reduce costs so as to confront foreign products. 
Production units should be refurbished and sound standards 
followed. 
  He indicated that Egypt must compete with foreign 
industries. 
All units must make every effort to develop themselves, because 
a closed-door policy is no longer viable, given the stage of 
economic liberalization in the world as a whole. 
<H5>  Many Burdens </H5>
  On the other hand, 'Abd-al-Ra'uf al-Kabti, president of the 
General Weaving and Knitting Association, thought that opening 
wide the door to importation would have an impact on Egyptian 
products because the unequal competition would be to the 
advantage of the foreign product. 
  The local producer has many burdens to bear, such as high 
taxes, electricity, and high interest rates. Foreign producers, 
on the other hand, are highly subsidized in order to harm 
national industry. 
  'Abd-al-Mun'im al-Ghazzali, vice president of the 
Engineering 
Industries Union, said that opening wide the door to importation 
certainly would have an impact on national industry. It would 
shift the competitive balance in favor of the foreign country 
that heavily subsidizes its industry, at a time when Egyptian 
industry is suffering from many obstacles. 
  One must therefore impose regulations to raise customs 
duties 
on goods that are cheaper than Egyptian products and monitor the 
quality of the foreign product. No product should be allowed in 
until its quality and suitability are fully verified. 
<H5>  Threat </H5>
  Engineer 'Ala Zahran, owner and director of the Tifal-Zahran 
factories, explained how opening the door to importation had 
come to constitute a threat to national industry due to the lack 
of strict surveillance and full tests on various imported goods. 
  The customs duty on such imported products does not exceed 5 
percent. Furthermore, the products are subsidized overseas, 
which influences the price of the local product. 
  He indicated that importing spare parts for large factories 
could be considered another very serious problem, first because 
the price of the parts was very high and then because taxes were 
collected on them even though we import them not for sale, but 
for installation and operation in machinery. 
  Some parts are not available in the market; and if they are, 
the price is exorbitant. Thus we are forced to import them from 
abroad to reduce the price difference as much as possible. 
  Muhammad Abu-Khatwah, the owner and director of tractor and 
agricultural machinery factories, said that opening the door to 
importation certainly was backing national industry into a tight 
corner because of high requisite prices and production costs 
here. 
<H5>  Suggestions </H5>
  He suggested that banks be designated to fund factory owners 
at reasonable interest rates in order to stimulate production. 
  Fahmi 'Abd-al-Maqsud, an exporter, thinks the coming period 
will require lowering the price of electricity and water, 
reducing customs duties on production requisites, and lowering 
taxes on manufacturing companies so that they can reduce the 
prices of their products and thus compete with imported products. 
  Muhammad Fu'ad Ahmad, an importer of food products, believes 
that high raw material prices in the domestic market cause high 
production costs. This always places the prices of Egyptian 
products in an uncompetitive position compared with the prices 
of the corresponding foreign goods imported from abroad. 
  Engineer 'Abd-al-Hamid al-Jamal, owner of a furniture 
factory, thinks that high interest rates and taxes do not favor 
Egyptian production compared with imports. He suggests reducing 
bank interest rates to finance factory purchases of modern tools 
and equipment so that our industry can keep pace with continuous 
development in the world. 
  He declared that his factories had surged ahead in exporting 
furniture parts and office furniture covered with thin layers of 
fire-resistant plastic. 
  Ibrahim Mansi, an importer of food products, thinks it is 
difficult for national industry to compete with foreign 
industry. He suggests lowering the interest rates of banks that 
finance national export industry to 6 percent, instead of 14 and 
16 percent. 
<H5>  Regulations </H5>
  Sami 'Abd-al-Maqsud, secretary of the importers' section of 
the General Federation of Chambers of Commerce, holds that 
opening the door to importation does not mean abandoning 
national industry. Many regulations can be kept, such as 
increased tariffs on certain goods, and committees can be 
established to monitor standards closely and set the price. 
  He indicated that full opening of the doors to importation 
must be accompanied by many measures to develop Egyptian 
industry and ease taxes and customs duties on production 
requisites. 
  Sulayman Muhammad Sulayman, president of the Sadat City 
Investors' Association, said: "I am for opening wide the door to 
importation, provided that local industry is supported and bank 
interest rates for investors are lowered. The investor's time 
should not be wasted in obtaining approvals and resolving 
bureaucratic problems in customs." 
  Muhammad Ghanim, former general secretary of the 
Businessmen's Association and an investor, said: "Opening the 
door wide to importation is something normal, given the period 
of economic liberalization through which Egypt is passing. We 
cannot isolate ourselves from the world. But this trend must be 
accompanied by encouragements for Egyptian industry, because 
Egypt is at the beginning of the road and the industrial 
countries are stages ahead of us. Thus, the obstacles that face 
the Egyptian investor and involve him in administrative mazes 
that prevent him from concentrating on production must be 
resolved. We must give economic thinking greater weight than 
administrative thinking." 
<H5>  Future Benefit </H5>
  Dr. Salah al-Jundi, professor of economics at al-Mansurah 
University, believes that the entry of imported goods into Egypt 
will create competition with domestic production. In the medium 
and long term this will lead to lower prices for the consumer 
and to an attempt to improve quality. Local companies will 
review production costs and profit margins until they arrive at 
attractive prices by which they can compete with imports. 
  Dr. Salah noted the need to increase the quality of Egyptian 
products and raise productivity to achieve competitive 
advantage. This will reduce the effect and danger of 
international variables. 
  He also stressed the need to strengthen the government's 
oversight role, so that liberalization does not turn into 
commercial anarchy that damages many infant industries still in 
the start-up phase. Opening the door to importation must not be 
a way to import products that do not conform to specifications, 
and no monopolies of any kind should appear. 
  Regulations must also be established to prevent dumping, 
subsidization, and falsification of documents. One should lower 
duties on production raw materials and requisites, intermediate 
and capital goods, and production equipment. One should instill 
the slogan Made in Egypt and evoke Egyptians' zeal 
and sense of identity so that they prefer buying the well-made 
Egyptian product and show it partiality, just as happens in all 
countries of the world. This requires that the Egyptian producer 
attain a high level of quality and conform to international 
specifications. 
  He stressed the need to pass a law against monopoly and 
commercial fraud and to combat dumping. Smuggling to evade 
customs duties should be combatted by giving every importer a 
customs number to tighten control on the payment of customs 
duties.

<F P=106> [Article by Fahd al-Tayyash] </F>
  [Text] For many Iraqis, the journey to the unknown starts 
as soon as they leave the Iraqi border points. The most 
important of these border points is that of the Jordanian 
al-Karamah point, previously known as al-Ruwayshad. Those who 
are departing are troubled by personal worries as well as by 
worries related to the nation as they cross this border point. 
Many Iraqis continue to leave by way of this border crossing. It 
is a continuous journey that started with the Iraqi invasion of 
Kuwait, when Iraqis were in search of either a haven or a 
shelter far from the fighting; the journey presently continues 
as Iraqis search for an asylum away from prisons and 
concentration camps. Therefore, the journey in search of 
suffering, hope, and facing the unknown starts at al-Karamah 
with the first step of the 1,000-mile trip. 
  A number of Iraqi networks and groupings have been formed 
outside Iraq, especially in Jordan, during the last few years. 
Each of these networks has certain motives. The motive behind 
one network is to help Iraqis; it was established having 
humanitarian incentives and great urgency that stemmed from 
within the Iraqi community. Another network is underground, 
stalks the Iraqi regime's enemies, and learns about their 
activities. A third network was formed with a goal to exploit 
and financially drain those who opt to leave for the unknown. 
Besides, there are smaller networks that have combined more than 
one of the above mentioned goals. However, this reporting is 
only concerned with the first kind of these networks, which 
overshadows other networks. 
  When I met a number of Iraqis in Jordan, as a first 
reaction, 
most of them were afraid. However, once I became acquainted with 
the leaders of the network, my mission became easier. 
Nevertheless, the most prominent request from those who portray 
fear remains their wish to be incognito with regard to the 
information they furnish. One could imagine the fear that Iraqis 
who live abroad face when one realizes the continuous fear that 
Iraqis live in--that same fear that drives them to leave their 
country. This implies that one's safety and the safety of one's 
folks is placed in jeopardy once one's fate is known. A 
prominent member of this humanitarian network confirmed to us 
that he had met with an Iraqi artist after the latter had 
entered Jordan. Upon asking him about his destination on this 
journey to the unknown, he replied by saying: "Denmark." But, 
why Denmark? Did he know anything about that country? Did he 
know anyone in Denmark? Was there any prospect for him there? 
All his answers were in the negative. However, Denmark was the 
only country that would grant him asylum. This Arab artist 
eventually embarked on his journey to the unknown. 
  An Iraqi journalist who resides in Amman believes that there 
is a campaign to induce Arab brains, especially scientists, and 
foremost Iraqis, to immigrate. This inducement is performed 
through various international bodies, most important of which is 
the International Council of Churches. This Council and other 
bodies support Iraqi immigration to Canada, Australia, Greece, 
and the United States. This journalist confirms that there are 
about 2 million Iraqis abroad. As a result of that, scientific 
institutions have lost a lot of their cadres. He gives as an 
example the case of the College of Agriculture in al-Mawsil 
University, where this journalist met with one of its faculty 
members, who told him that he was one of those who deserted this 
university. This faculty member added that only 18 percent of 
the faculty of the College of Agriculture did not quit. This 
small percentage did not emigrate for reasons that were stronger 
than the attempt to emigrate and leave. Despite the fact that 
the Iraqi regime requests any Iraqi professional to pay a sum 
that varies between 500,000 and 1 million Iraqi dinars [ID] in 
order to be able to leave Iraq, emigration still continues. In 
fact, the number of emigrants is on the rise. At the same time, 
the Iraqi journalist confirms that Iraqi's best artists, 
literary writers, and journalists have also left the country on 
the journey to the unknown. During the last three years, Iraq 
has lost about 400 artists, literary writers, journalists, 
poets, and critics. How much did Iraq spend to prepare these 
cadres? How much time is needed to prepare new cadres? This loss 
impacts the whole Arab Nation, not just Iraq. This loss is 
further magnified if the number of other scientific 
specializations is added to specializations already indicated. 
<3>  Iraqis in Amman 
  Many Iraqis congregate in the al-Husayn Mosque Square in the 
heart of the Jordanian capital, Amman. I was filled with sorrow 
as I reached this square. Many questions came to my mind. All 
the questions were centered around one single issue: why do 
people emigrate? Those Iraqis who gathered in this square seemed 
sad, needy, and poor. In such a situation, grief is mixed with 
poverty, and poverty with dignity. This is because, though there 
is great hunger and great poverty, dignity is precious. 
Injustice and years of suffering and fear have brought about 
this fate to these groups. I saw many of them struggling with 
poverty, yet, maintaining the greatness of Arabs. The Iraqi 
emigrant would roam the avenues of the unknown and not ask for 
favors. He would face need and yet maintain his/her pride. Dr. 
'Adil Ziyadat, professor of journalism at al-Yarmuk University 
in Irbid confirms that the immigrant Iraqi community lives in 
dignity. He adds that this community represents a sane society 
that is free from crime, though the temptation to commit crime 
may be great. 
  A number of small hotels are located around al-Husayn Mosque 
Square. Mr. 'Umar al-Natur, who manages one of the hotels, 
believes there are 40 of them. He also says that Iraqi guests, 
60 percent of whom are men, make up 80 percent of the total 
guests. The average number of rooms in each of these hotels is 
50; these can accommodate between 150-200 persons, as more than 
three persons can share one room. Members of the Iraqi networks 
meet in these hotels, so do members of the one family, who had 
been separated from each other by going on different journeys to 
the unknown. This situation is especially true with regard to 
those who cannot go back to their country, fearing for their 
lives. Moreover, these hotels are used as centers where Iraqis 
receive money transfers and financial aid from friends and 
relatives. Mr. al-Natur confirms that most of these transfers 
originate in the Gulf states. This is because of the existence 
of mixed families, such as Iraqi-Kuwaiti, where members of the 
one family had been divided as a result of the Iraqi invasion of 
Kuwait. Those Iraqi families that travel to Amman to collect 
financial support from relatives and friends in the Gulf 
encounter much hardship. Having to pay an exit tax when leaving 
Iraq is the most important of these hardships. Some of those 
leaving Iraq have indicated that, according to recent Iraqi 
Government regulations, each passenger leaving Iraq has to pay a 
tax equal to 200 American dollars (ID15,000). 
  Besides, Iraqis entering Jordan face regulatory problems 
from 
the Jordanian authorities. As immigrants enter, they are given 
two-week resident visas, the same as is given to other 
nationalities. Subsequently, residents are allowed an extension 
of three months for their residence, and then a last three-month 
extension. At the end of the second three-month extension, 
immigrants are subject to both legal questioning and deportation 
to their country. An Iraqi poet resident in Amman confirms that 
at the Jordanian official level, immigrant Iraqis are given 
permission for residence, as Jordan is a second home for them. 
However, they get equal treatment as other Arab nationals, with 
no consideration for their political status vis-a-vis legal 
questioning. Some Iraqis have actually been deported to Iraq. 
This poet believes that deported Iraqis encounter great 
suffering, as there is no fleeing what they had previously fled; 
they start to face the unknown inside their homeland. This poet 
also thinks that the Iraqi and Jordanian Governments are 
cooperating with regard to sending Iraqis back, especially 
skilled laborers and specialized professionals. An Iraqi 
photographer resident in Amman indicates that in spite of the 
fact that all immigrants are considered non-permanent residents 
when they first enter Jordan, the Jordanian ministry of labor 
does not grant Iraqis work permits, though these are granted to 
other Arab nationals such as Egyptians. 
  Jordanian security forces confirm that the number of Iraqis 
currently resident in Jordan does not exceed 20 thousand 
persons. This figure is lower than previous figures because of 
Iraqi emigration to the European countries and the United 
States. A knowledgeable Iraqi journalist believes that the 20 
thousand figure is wrong and that the right figure would be 70 
thousand. This last figure would include those who have 
permanent residence, as well as those who use Jordan as a 
stepping stone to emigrate to an unknown country. The 70 
thousand figure would also include those who are temporary 
residents, who are waiting either for someone who wants to meet 
or get in touch with them, or for receiving money transfers that 
would help them deal with the hectic circumstances of their 
lives.

<F P=106> [Article by Gai Bekhor: "And on Page 3, the Jewish Devil"; </F>
first paragraph is HA'ARETZ introduction] 
  [Text] The Egyptian Government has apparently been allowing 
the press to publish poisonous criticism of Israel, to provide a 
way to vent the rage that has been mounting up in many circles 
since the slaughter in Hebron. 
  Cartoons depicting the "Jewish Devil," with the slogan of 
revenge, "Haibar, Haibar, Ya Yehudim, the army of Muhammad shall 
return," have been back in the daily papers of Egypt for the 
last few weeks, after being missing for a long time. "Thank God, 
our list is still long," Yitzhak Rabin says proudly in one 
Egyptian cartoon, holding up a list that says: "the Dir Yasin 
massacre, the Sabra and Shatila massacre, the Cave of Makhpela 
massacre." "I cannot get my hands clean, even though I washed 
them both before the massacre and after it," Rabin complains in 
another cartoon in the opposition weekly AL-WAFD, where the 
picture shows his hands dripping with Palestinian blood. And in 
another place, the leader of the Serbs, the murderers of the 
Bosnian Muslims, asks a Jewish figure (according to the 
anti-Semitic stereotype) to come and help him. "But if you do 
come, do not blow up our bank or our stores," he warns, with 
blood dripping from his hands and the hands of the character he 
is talking to. 
  These dozens of cartoons are testimony to the fact that the 
short spring in the attitude of the Egyptian press, especially 
the establishment press, but also the opposition, toward 
Israel--a spring that began with the achievement of the Oslo 
agreement and reached its height with the signing of the Cairo 
agreement a month ago--has come to an abrupt end. If for the six 
months that have passed since the agreement was signed in 
Washington, the cartoons in the Egyptian newspapers concentrated 
on the slaughter of the Muslims in Bosnia and on the internal 
terror in Egypt itself, now the papers are being flooded with 
articles of incitement and protest against Israel, the same kind 
that were published at the height of the intifadah and after the 
war in Lebanon. 
  Some of the newspapers do distinguish between the settlers 
and their politics and the Israeli Government and its indirect 
responsibility for the slaughter in Hebron, but they are few and 
far between. Most of the media blame Israel for the massacre, 
and imply that the government is in partnership with the 
settlers, and sympathizes with them. They make no distinction 
between the murderer from Hebron and the settlers as a whole. 
All the settlers are depicted as murderers of Arabs. 
  "The hands of Israel are filthy with blood, even if she does 
try to deny her responsibility (for the slaughter)," wrote the 
official paper AL-AKHBAR on 27 February. "The crime in Hebron 
reveals clearly the racist tendencies and terrorist character of 
the Jewish settlers, who believe that the blood of Muslims is 
worth nothing. The Israeli army also did its own part to 
maximize the number of deaths. 
  "The massacre is solely the responsibility of the Israeli 
Government," concluded AL-AHRAM of the same day, "and this time 
it is impossible to claim that a crazy man carried out the crime 
on his own accord. There are precedents for this claim, the 
burning of the Al Aksa mosque, and also the murder of the 
Palestinian workers, where the Israeli authorities claimed that 
the murderer was a crazed youth. 
  "The Israeli occupation forces poured oil on the flames the 
day the massacre was carried out, by shelling another mosque in 
occupied Jerusalem with TNT shells" destroying the mosque and a 
building nearby, broadcast the government radio station Savat 
al-Arab. It is true that in a phone call to Mubarak, Rabin 
expressed his sorrow over the ugly incident and the Israeli 
Government's and people's condemnation of the criminal act, but 
expressing sorrow is not enough to bind the wounds to Arab 
feelings." 
  From the way the Egyptian radio station expresses itself, it 
is possible to draw conclusions about the purpose of the 
restraint the Egyptian authorities have shown toward the 
electronic media, and the restraint these media have shown in 
this matter. 
  These anti-Israel expressions stand out all the more because 
so many articles have been appearing since the agreement in 
Washington, even in the leftist newspapers, calling for 
normalization of relations with Israel. This seems to have been 
part of a government-backed information campaign. Now it appears 
that the Egyptian Government is knowingly allowing the wave of 
criticism to sweep over the newspapers in order to give the 
anger and pressure that have been building up since the massacre 
in many circles a way to be vented. The Egyptian Government 
knows that the only person who can turn the anti-Israeli trend 
around is Yasir 'Araf'at, who by renewing negotiations with 
Israel can calm the winds and give renewed legitimacy to 
relations with her. Because of this, he is the most courted man 
in Cairo these days. Last week he met, under government 
auspices, with top people in the regime, the press, and the 
Egyptian intelligencia--those same journalists and intellectuals 
who had attacked him for his support of Saddam Husayn--and 
explained how important the peace negotiations with Israel were, 
in spite of or perhaps because of the massacre in Hebron, and 
his words were headlined in the newspapers of Egypt.

<F P=106> [Article by Dani Rubinstein: "The Masters of the West Bank </F>
and Gaza"] 
  [Text] ] The government is going to have trouble taking any 
kind of action against the extremist minority among the settlers 
in the territories, because the settlers have long since become 
the masters of the West Bank and Gaza. Something that happened 
at the end of last week will serve as testimony: on Friday, a 
delegation of Peace Now activists left for a visit to Hebron. 
Because of the great tension in the city, which was under 
curfew, the trip was carefully planned. Members of the movement 
coordinated the date with the PLO leadership in Hebron, and 
almost all the heads of the Arab community awaited them. 
According to the organizers, they had been given a permit by the 
military authorities. But the visit never took place. An IDF 
(Israel Defense Forces) roadblock stopped the group outside Gush 
Etzion, and the soldiers announced to its members that according 
to the orders they had received they could not let them continue 
on their way. The Peace Now activists had to give up the trip 
and return to Jerusalem. 
  At the very same time, the settlers and their supporters 
continued to pass the IDF roadblocks in the territories as 
usual. Ever since the IDF authorized Baruch Goldstein's funeral 
procession from Jerusalem to Kiryat Arba, you still see the 
settlers roaming about Hebron in their way and receiving guests 
who do not live there. 
  This is a familiar phenomenon. According to the defense 
philosophy that has become established in the territories, not 
only "the Arabs are the enemy," as Major General Sha'ul Mopaz 
said before the commission of inquiry, but also anyone who does 
not like the settlers--"anyone" meaning especially the activists 
of Shalom Ahshav. 
  Why does this happen? Why does the IDF think that visits by 
Israel left to Arabs in the territories are an intentional 
provocation that must be averted, while practically any kind of 
demonstration or other protest activity by the right and the 
settlers is permissible? In contrast to the standing order to 
block the way of Shalom Ahshav activists (this is not the first 
time they have done this), innumerable examples can be brought 
of activities by the right in the territories, which were 
carried out with no problems. Anyone really aware of what goes 
on in the West Bank and Gaza knows that there is just one group 
of Israelis that the Israeli defense network there considers 
even worse than Shalom Ahshav--the press. The left and the media 
are suspected of links with the Arab enemy, and IDF commanders 
do everything possible to keep them away from the West Bank or 
Gaza. 
  This reality was created by the settlers, who over the years 
have become integrated into the defense establishment in the 
territories. Like the soldiers, the settlers, too, carry arms. 
They maintain contacts with the army, get updates, receive and 
give briefings, and come and go freely in most of the defense 
installations in the territories. Many of them spent their army 
service on bases in the territories, and fulfil support and 
security functions along with units of the military government. 
  It would not be a great exaggeration to say that because of 
these circumstances, they have become masters of the field. As 
they view it, the army is in the West Bank and Gaza, first and 
foremost, to serve them. In many ways, the settlers have managed 
to turn the IDF into an apparatus that guards them not only from 
the Arab enemy, but also from anyone suspected of aiding the 
Arabs. At the top of the list, of course, are the left and the 
hostile media. Even the [military] government's civilian 
authority, meant to serve the needs of the Arabs in the 
territories, is forced in many instances to accept the dictates 
of the settlers. 
  Thus it happens that senior and junior officers who do not 
get along with the settlers (that is, do not give in to their 
demands) are denounced in the settlements and on the right as 
leftists and are unable to go on serving in the West Bank and 
Gaza. Maj. Gen. 'Amram Matzne'a, who dared one time to condemn 
the actions of some settlers who made a retaliatory raid on the 
Dehaisha camp and shot at Arab houses, barely managed to hold 
onto his job after the leaders of the settlements demanded his 
dismissal. Who knows, perhaps this episode put Gen. Matzne'a out 
of the running later on for the position of chief of staff. 
  In contrast, no IDF commander's career has ever been harmed 
because of things he said or did against the left in the 
territories, or against the Arabs (unless he exaggerated, the 
way Res. Gen. Yehuda Meir did during the episode where the Arab 
youths arrested at Hav'ara were hit and had their bones broken 
at the beginning of the intifadah). Everyone in the Israeli 
defense establishment learned the main rule very quickly--not to 
tangle with the settlers, or with the political lobby on the 
right that supports them. The labor government, and Meretz, and 
the peace process have not changed this reality at all.

<F P=106> [Article by Nehemiyah Stresler; first paragraph is HA'ARETZ </F>
introduction] 
  [Text] A superficial and superfluous report. 
The members of the IMF mission, who recently published their 
report on the Israeli economy, worship economic theories that 
they want to carry out in every single country, no matter 
whether it is Indonesia, Italy, or Israel. 
  Desmond Lachman has already returned to Washington. He 
presented the 10-page report at the beginning of the week, after 
toiling two days on its formulation. Lachman, a professional 
economist, was this year's head of the four-member mission the 
IMF sends to Israel every year to check out our economic 
situation. The mission spent two weeks in Israel, during which 
they had 35 meetings with top leaders of the Bank of Israel, the 
Ministry of Finance, the Ministry of Industry and Commerce, 
banks, the Histadrut, the Industrialists' Union, and academia. 
The four members of the mission treated every meeting seriously. 
They asked a great many questions, and one of them carefully 
recorded all the answers. The written material grew into a large 
stack, but they were not worried. Lachman knew that just one 
meeting would be really important, the one with Bank of Israel 
president, Professor Ya'akov Frenkel. 
  Up until three years ago, Frenkel served as head of the 
research department, and economic adviser, at the International 
Monetary Fund, a very, very senior position. His name goes 
before him in Washington as a professional, as a gifted 
economist who knows how to combine theory with practical 
knowledge of the international scene. Desmond Lachman tends to 
adulate Frenkel. He does not imagine even for a moment that it 
is possible to disagree or argue with him, and we see the 
results well in the report. If Lachman had not signed the 
report, I would swear that Frenkel had written it himself. 
  Although it is true that Frenkel is the most well-known and 
accepted in Washington of all the Bank of Israel presidents we 
have had up until now, during Mikhael Bruno's time as president, 
too, the IMF mission wrote exactly what Bruno what told them to 
write, because Bruno also has a good professional reputation at 
the IMF. 
  The members of the mission are economists who see the world 
through the lenses of economic figures. What the theory book 
says is sacred to them, and they want to carry the theory out in 
every single country, no matter whether it is Indonesia, or 
Italy, or Israel; the blueprints are the same. They see 
politicians as people to be wary of, and businessmen, they 
categorize as special interest groups. Therefore, the second 
they meet a Bank of Israel president who is also a famous 
professor of economics, they adopt his opinions and 
recommendations without hesitation, and all that remains for 
them to do is put his words on paper. 
  They open the report with a positive and encouraging 
statement about the Israeli economy, which continued to grow 
impressively in 1993, too, along with a drop in unemployment. 
Afterwards, they go on with such superlatives that I almost 
blushed reading them, although I have no part in the great 
success. Next, the mission reports joyfully on the even rosier 
future awaiting us, "due to the acceleration of the peace 
process." Apparently they did not hear the radio or watch TV the 
entire time they were here, and never heard about the slaughter 
in Hebron and its ramifications for the peace process. 
  After these words sweeter than honey, they turn to real 
economics and begin to deal with inflation. Here we have the 
opportunity of reading the president of the Bank of Israel's 
exact position on inflation, how it slows down growth and it is 
worthless to try it as a cure for unemployment. The report also 
points out that it is worthwhile paying special attention to the 
fast growth in the amount of money and credit in the economy, as 
well as the sharp rise in the prices of shares on the market, 
which has brought the public great financial wealth, and that 
these two phenomena constitute a danger of inflation. 
  In these descriptioms, the self-abnegation of the IMF 
economists before Frenkel is so extreme as to be almost 
ridiculous. They speak of the rise in the amount of money in the 
last third of 1993 and the sharp rise in the market then, as 
though the Bank of Israel had no connection to it. Who gave the 
banks the tremendous monetary loans? Who was responsible for the 
growth in the amount of money in the economy, if not the Bank of 
Israel? Who could have stopped the credit the banks were pushing 
on their customers to use in buying shares and trust funds, and 
thus have partially prevented the rise in prices on the market, 
if not the Bank of Israel? But it is not nice to raise such 
impolite questions. Instead, Lachman chose to praise the Bank of 
Israel for raising interest. 
  Right after this, the mission goes on to laud the exchange 
rate policy, which the president of the Bank sees as his own 
personal baby. There is not a word of criticism of the bank's 
excessive control over the rate of exchange. After this, we are 
privileged to read the rest of the Bank of Israel's positions on 
deficit reduction in the State budget, on the dangers that too 
generous wage agreements can pose, on the importance of 
expanding outlays on infrastructure and education and reducing 
taxes, and the whole list of structural reforms that the Bank 
advocates. The mission even takes the trouble to point out that 
there is room to give all the "savings mechanisms" a try, i.e., 
to include the stock market, too, also a well-known position of 
the Bank of Israel. 
  At this point, we may well ask: what do we need all this 
for? 
Why do we need these four scholars to come and write up this 
superficial report that is nothing but a list of slogans? 
Anyway, how can anyone come to any country for two weeks and 
understand what is really happening there? It is true that the 
extent of their understanding of the complicatedness of the 
Israeli economy comes to about zero; but on the other hand, why 
torture four good men like this? After all, they have a good 
place to work, nice paychecks, travel all over the world; so 
what if their report is a joke? The main thing, anyway, is that 
someone has told us how well we are doing.

<F P=106> [Part 3 of 3-part article by 'Uthman Mirghani: "Who Leaked </F>
Details of Itinerary of Al-Turabi's Visit to Canada?"] 
  [Text] Ironically, Canada, where the general secretary of 
Sudan's National Islamic Front (NIF), Dr. Hasan al-Turabi, was 
subjected to attack on 25 May 1992, was not included originally 
in the itinerary of his European and American tour. The tour was 
planned to include Britain and the United States and end at the 
Vatican. The main purpose was to win backing and support for the 
Khartoum government and strengthen al-Turabi's position on the 
international scene. In particular, he wanted to set himself up 
as a mediator between the West and the movements of political 
Islam. 
  Because Canada plays no direct part in Sudan's policies or 
in 
al-Turabi's ambitions and plans, it lies outside the circle of 
interest when the NIF general secretary began his tour; indeed, 
it was added to the tour schedule only during al-Turabi's visit 
to the United States. 
  Perhaps the most interesting irony is that when al-Turabi 
decided to go to Canada from the United States, he encountered 
difficulties in making arrangements. The Canadian consulate 
general in Washington rejected his application for an entry 
visa, whereupon a number of Canadian members of Parliament and 
other parties intervened to pressure the government in Ottawa 
before an entry visa was allowed to be granted to him from the 
consulate in Washington. 
  Canadian Conservative member of Parliament Don Blankarn 
[name 
as transliterated] confirmed to AL-MAJALLAH that he intervened 
to ensure that an entry visa was granted to al-Turabi. He 
indicated that during his visit al-Turabi was going to discuss 
topics of trade and investment in Canada. 
  Blankarn was more explicit when a Canadian journalist 
interviewed him after the attack on al-Turabi. He said that the 
NIF leader and the Sudanese Government wanted to conclude deals 
with Canada in the areas of transportation, banks, 
communications, and pharmaceuticals. However, when al-Turabi 
talked about the goals of his visit to Canada and his Western 
tour, he described them as neither trade, teaching, nor tourism, 
but rather as a mission and a summoning to God--this according 
to a speech carried by the Sudan News Agency, delivered at the 
celebration of his recovery at Green Square in Khartoum on 31 
July 1992. 
  For their part, Canadian Foreign Ministry officials insisted 
later that al-Turabi had come to Canada on a private visit and 
that the Foreign Ministry had arranged a meeting with him as "an 
important personality" in Sudan. AL-MAJALLAH contacted Richard 
Chappell, a Canadian Foreign Ministry official who was one of 
those who met al-Turabi during his visit to Ottawa. (He was 
transferred afterward to another department--West 
Africa--without explanation of whether his transfer was a normal 
procedure or related to the consequences of the attack on 
al-Turabi.) When AL-MAJALLAH asked Chappell about the 
circumstances of al-Turabi's visit, he declined comment, saying 
that "his department would not allow him to talk about the 
subject." He referred us to the department concerned with East 
Africa and Sudan. 
  AL-MAJALLAH then contacted Foreign Ministry spokesman Yves 
Gagnon, who said: "Al-Turabi met with officials in the Ministry 
of Foreign Affairs. We received him as an influential 
personality." 
  Gagnon denied that any trade topics were discussed during 
al-Turabi's meeting with Canadian Foreign Ministry officials. He 
said that they used the opportunity to express anxiety about 
political conditions, the civil war, and human rights violations 
in Sudan. 
<H5>  Charged Atmosphere </H5>
  Besides the problems accompanying the obtaining of a visa, 
al-Turabi's visit to Canada took place in an atmosphere charged 
with tension and anger. As soon as he arrived in Toronto, his 
companions were surprised by a number of Sudanese who received 
them with a noisy hostile demonstration, even though the 
itinerary of the visit had not been "officially announced." The 
demonstration continued in front of the hotel where the NIF 
general secretary stayed. 
  This hostile reception by Sudanese opponents was a 
phenomenon 
that accompanied al-Turabi throughout his European and American 
tour. During his visit to Britain a protest demonstration was 
organized in front of a number of public buildings and 
institutions that he visited to hold meetings or deliver 
lectures. The demonstrators shouted hostile slogans, such as: 
"Al-Turabi, murderer of Khartoum!" Some carried pictures of the 
officers whom the government of Lieutenant-General 'Umar 
al-Bashir executed in 1990 on the charge of organizing an 
attempted coup. Al-Turabi was forced to use the rear door to 
leave after one of his lectures. 
  The events accompanying al-Turabi's lecture before the Royal 
Society of Arts in London on 27 April 1992 typified the charged 
atmosphere of the tour. During the lecture a Sudanese lawyer, 
'Abd-al-Baqi 'Abd-al-Hafiz al-Rih, stood and lifted his robe, 
exposing the artificial leg that had replaced his natural leg 
that was amputated because of the effects of the torture he 
received during his imprisonment in Sudan in 1989. Having retold 
the story of his torture amid cries by some in the audience 
hostile to al-Turabi, al-Rih ended by asking the general 
secretary, "Does this have anything to do with Islam?" 
  The story of lawyer al-Rih became a subject of conversation, 
and the British newspapers wrote about it until it almost 
overwhelmed the visit and the subsequent stages of al-Turabi's 
tour. The British newspaper THE GUARDIAN published a long 
article that began as follows: "The tall man stood in his white 
robe and turban, displaying his wooden leg in the face of the 
speaker at the lectern and asking, `Is this what Islam 
means?--torture and dictatorship?'" 
  The story continued: "'Abd-al-Baqi al-Rih was a lawyer in 
Khartoum until December 1989, when the Sudanese authorities 
arrested him for membership in an opposition party. After 48 
days, during which he was tortured, he lost his leg. 
'Abd-al-Baqi waved his artificial leg in the face of the man who 
is considered the real power behind the Islamic regime in 
Khartoum--Hasan al-Turabi." 
  When al-Turabi went from London to Washington, the story of 
lawyer al-Rih pursued him. Finally, he was forced to say at a 
press conference in the American capital on 13 May 1992 that 
al-Rih's story might not be true and that cancer may have been 
the reason his leg was cut off. He added that al-Rih had been 
detained no more than 40 days!--and suffered from cancer. He 
did, however, go on to say, "If torture was the reason, it was 
wrong according to the teachings of Islam." 
  Al-Turabi's visit to Washington came off no better than his 
visit to London. In addition to the story of lawyer al-Rih that 
pursued him, al-Turabi found himself surrounded by a hostile 
atmosphere. At a demonstration following a lecture by al-Turabi 
at the Institute for Strategic and International Studies on 12 
May, angry demonstrators surrounded him. One of them pulled him 
by his necktie, and two others then joined in, kicking, pushing, 
and cursing. The American police intervened to rescue al-Turabi 
and took him away in one of their cars. 
<H5>  Uproar in Canada </H5>
  In addition to the protest demonstrations that greeted him 
in 
Toronto, al-Turabi faced a flood of criticisms in Canada that 
continued even after the attack on him. Two associations--the 
African-Sudanese Association in Canada and the Sudanese-Canadian 
Friendship Association--issued statements expressing anger and 
displeasure at the visit. Some Canadian deputies raised 
questions in Parliament about the facts and circumstances of the 
visit and the granting of an entry visa to al-Turabi. Liberal 
deputy Jim Peterson demanded to know the reasons that led the 
Canadian Government to receive al-Turabi and allow him to enter 
Canada, given reports by Amnesty International and Africa Watch 
of "arrests, torture, and summary executions in Sudan." 
  Member of Parliament Svend Robinson sent a letter dated 27 
July 1992--after the attack--to Barbara McDougall, the minister 
of state for foreign affairs, expressing concern that al-Turabi 
had been granted an entry visa to Canada "despite his 
reputation." 
  Robinson noted that "a number of reports have hinted that 
officials in the [Canadian] Foreign Ministry may have leaked 
al-Turabi's itinerary in Canada," and he demanded an explanation. 
  Many questions indeed were raised about how the Sudanese had 
known the details of al-Turabi's itinerary in Canada, when it 
had not been announced officially. 
  Although some circles have hinted that the Canadian Foreign 
Ministry, which reluctantly granted al-Turabi an entry visa 
after several members of Parliament intervened, leaked his 
itinerary to Sudanese opponents so that they could greet him 
with protests, well-informed sources have told AL-MAJALLAH that 
the itinerary was leaked by a Sudanese, not by a Canadian. These 
sources said that a Sudanese informed some of his Sudanese 
friends about al-Turabi's scheduled arrival time and details of 
his itinerary. They in turn contacted their colleagues to 
organize the protest demonstration that greeted al-Turabi when 
he arrived in Toronto. 
  Because his itinerary had been leaked, al-Turabi not only 
faced protest demonstrations in Toronto, but was surprised by a 
protest demonstration waiting for him in front of the Foreign 
Ministry building in Ottawa, where he was scheduled to meet with 
officials on 25 May 1992. Al-Turabi was forced to use the rear 
door to enter the Canadian Foreign Ministry building to avoid 
the demonstrators who were waiting for him at the front door. 
Hashim Badr-al-Din, with his wife and two children, were among 
them. 
  The leaking of the itinerary undoubtedly made it easier for 
the Sudanese to organize the protest demonstrations that raised 
the temperature until matters climaxed in the attack at the 
airport. 
  In his account of the incident, Hashim Badr-al-Din said that 
he returned to his home frustrated, like the other Sudanese who 
participated in the demonstration before the Canadian Foreign 
Ministry. They had been unable to express their feelings against 
al-Turabi because he had used the rear door of the building to 
enter and leave. 
  Badr-al-Din indicated that he went that evening--25 May 
1992--to say goodbye to a Sudanese who was on his way back from 
Ottawa to Toronto after having taken part in the protest 
demonstration. 
  While he was at the airport, Badr-al-Din saw al-Turabi rush 
in to catch his plane. Just as circumstances had intervened to 
cause al-Turabi to add Canada to his itinerary belatedly, they 
also played a role in the confrontation between him and 
Badr-al-Din at Ottawa Airport. Had al-Turabi not delayed his 
departure time from six in the evening, as scheduled, to seven, 
he would never have encountered Badr-al-Din. 
<H5>  Security Measures </H5>
  The leaking of news of the visit was not the only 
controversial and unclear matter during al-Turabi's visit to 
Canada: some circles also questioned why no security protection 
was provided for him. From the available information and 
statements it appears that a mix-up occurred and led to lack of 
coordination among the Canadian security agencies concerned, 
thus contributing to the lack of protection for al-Turabi. 
  Canadian newspapers picked up this aspect after the attack 
on 
al-Turabi and pointed to conflict among security agencies. In 
its 27 June 1992 issue, THE CITIZEN published an article 
entitled, "Unsuccessful Security Warning Behind Attack at Ottawa 
Airport." The article stated that Canadian intelligence had sent 
the police a warning of possible danger to al-Turabi because of 
the demonstrations and protests during his visit. However, when 
the NIF general secretary arrived aboard a commercial flight 
from Toronto to Ottawa the morning of 25 May 1992, the 
Gloucester police, who are responsible for the airport, were 
unaware of his presence there. They were not informed about it 
until later, when they learned indirectly from the Ottawa police 
that al-Turabi would leave for Toronto at 1800 that day. 
  THE CITIZEN quoted Celine Boudrail, a spokeswoman for the 
Canadian intelligence service, as saying that the service 
"received information about possible danger to al-Turabi," and 
conveyed this information to the other concerned agencies. 
However, the spokeswoman refused to answer questions about the 
kind of danger, the agencies that conveyed the information 
originally, or those that were informed of it afterward. 
  It seems that the complexities of the federal system were 
behind the mix-up. Inspector Phil Lockett of the Ottawa district 
police informed AL-MAJALLAH that they did not know of 
al-Turabi's arrival in Ottawa and that the information they 
received about it reached them very late. He added: "The mistake 
also stemmed from our not having been informed of the alias 
under which al-Turabi was traveling. When we searched the 
airport records for his real name, we did not find it." 
  Inspector Lockett's words imply that instead of reporting 
the 
warning to the Gloucester police, who are responsible for 
airport security, the intelligence services reported it to the 
Ottawa police. Although the Canadian authorities considered 
al-Turabi's visit "private," they felt uneasy after the events 
that accompanied his visits to Britain and the United States, in 
addition to the protest demonstration in Toronto. They therefore 
tried to provide protection for him at the airport on his 
arrival and during his departure. However, the belated warning 
frustrated any preparations to arrange a security reception for 
al-Turabi when he arrived at Ottawa airport the morning of 25 
May, just as the conflict between agencies frustrated protection 
arrangements during his departure that evening. 
  At the suggestion of the Gloucester police, some police 
officers went to Ottawa Airport after having learned "belatedly" 
that al-Turabi would leave at six that evening from Ottawa to 
Toronto. There they looked for al-Turabi's name and did not find 
it on the passenger lists. Also, they were not informed that 
al-Turabi had changed his flight from 1800 to 1900. They 
therefore waited until 1830. When he did not arrive, the 
security alert was lifted, and the policemen involved left the 
airport. 
  In this regard, Inspector Lockett said that his forces had 
not been informed that the demonstrators had broken into the 
lobby of the hotel where al-Turabi had been staying in Toronto 
before coming to Ottawa. He added in an interview published in 
Canada: "Had we known that problems had occurred in Toronto and 
that the person [al-Turabi] was well known and subject to 
security dangers, we would have taken other measures." 
  Similarly, officials of the Royal Canadian Mounted Police 
(RCMP) said that they had not tried to provide al-Turabi with 
personal protection because he was on a private visit. Thus, the 
procedures that the RCMP follows for official visitors were not 
applied to him. The RCMP did take charge of providing 
round-the-clock protection for al-Turabi during his stay in 
Civic Hospital after the attack. However, the OTTAWA SUN 
newspaper quoted Inspector Jerry Boucher of the RCMP as having 
said later that they would urge al-Turabi to leave Canada as 
soon as he was able. 
  A Canadian member of Parliament, Eugene Belmer, summarized 
the events accompanying al-Turabi's visit by attributing the 
affair to lack of proper coordination among the security 
services.

<F P=106> [Interview with Don Blankarn (name as transliterated), </F>
Canadian member of Parliament; place and date not given: "We 
Were Going To Discuss Investments and Deals in Canada With 
Him"--first two paragraphs are AL-MAJALLAH introduction] 
  [Text] According to his planned itinerary, al-Turabi was 
supposed to meet three Conservative members of Parliament 
[MP]--Don Blankarn [name as transliterated], Allan Redway, and 
Harry Chadwick--at a working luncheon in Toronto at noon on 26 
May 1992. The attack at Ottawa Airport on 25 May 1992 caused the 
meeting to be postponed. 
  AL-MAJALLAH spoke with MP Don Blankarn about the nature of 
this meeting that did not take place and about his intervention 
to ensure that al-Turabi obtained an entry visa for Canada after 
his first application to the Canadian consulate in Washington 
was rejected. 
  [AL-MAJALLAH] Were there arrangements for a meeting between 
you and al-Turabi during his visit to Canada? 
  [Blankarn] Yes, we were supposed to meet with him on 26 May 
1992 (the day following the attack at Ottawa Airport). We had 
prepared for a working luncheon that was supposed to take place 
at the Golf Club in Toronto, but al-Turabi unfortunately was 
attacked in Ottawa. 
  [AL-MAJALLAH] Who arranged for the meeting? 
  [Blankarn] Ziyad Muzaffar (a Canadian of Pakistani origin 
who 
made arrangements for al-Turabi's visit to Canada and was with 
him at Ottawa Airport at the time of the incident) contacted me 
and spoke to me about the subject. I undertook to arrange the 
meeting with the two other MPs. 
  [AL-MAJALLAH] What were you going to discuss at the meeting? 
I mean, were the discussions going to be of a political nature, 
a commercial nature, or both together? 
  [Blankarn] The meeting was to discuss commercial subjects. 
We 
were going to discuss with al-Turabi the question of investing 
certain funds in Canada as well as other commercial deals 
involving exporting and importing certain goods. 
  [AL-MAJALLAH] What is the nature of these investments? 
  [Blankarn] We have a large Islamic community in Canada. We 
were scheduled to discuss with al-Turabi the question of 
establishing an Islamic bank here. Al-Turabi is a man who knows 
a lot in this area. 
  [AL-MAJALLAH] Where exactly was it planned to establish this 
bank? 
  [Blankarn] No exact place had been agreed on, but the idea 
was to establish an Islamic bank in Canada. It was just a 
general idea. Al-Turabi knows a lot in this area. We were 
supposed to discuss the idea with him, in addition to discussing 
the investment of certain funds in Canada. 
  [AL-MAJALLAH] But al-Turabi holds no official position in 
the 
government; nor is he a businessman, to discuss such matters and 
conclude commercial deals in behalf of the Sudanese Government. 
  [Blankarn] But he is the real power behind the government. 
He 
may not occupy an official position, but he represents the real 
power. I helped him obtain an entry visa to Canada. 
  [AL-MAJALLAH] What kind of visa was he given? Is it true 
that 
the Canadian consulate in Canada refused at first to grant him a 
visa? 
  [Blankarn] It was a normal tourist visa. He encountered 
certain difficulties when he applied for it, but I intervened to 
ensure that he got it.

<F P=106> [Interview with Yves Gagnon, Canadian Foreign Ministry </F>
spokesman; place and date not given: "We Did Not Send Al-Turabi 
an Invitation To Visit Our Country"--first paragraph is 
AL-MAJALLAH introduction] 
  [Text] AL-MAJALLAH interviewed Yves Gagnon, a spokesman for 
the Canadian Foreign Ministry, about the circumstances of 
al-Turabi's visit to Canada and what took place during his 
meeting with officials at the Foreign Ministry. He denied that 
Ottawa had sent an official invitation, but refused to talk 
about the passport on which al-Turabi had entered Canada. Here 
is the text of the interview. 
  [AL-MAJALLAH] On what basis did you receive al-Turabi at the 
Foreign Ministry? 
  [Gagnon] Al-Turabi met with officials at the Ministry of 
Foreign Affairs on 25 May 1992. We received him as an 
influential personality. During the meeting, we asked him to 
work to persuade the Sudanese Government to change its policy 
regarding human rights and restoration of freedoms. We feel 
uneasy about the continued violations of human rights in Sudan, 
the continuing war in the south, and the condition of general 
freedoms. 
  [AL-MAJALLAH] Did you send al-Turabi an invitation to visit 
Canada? 
  [Gagnon] The Canadian Government did not send an invitation 
to al-Turabi. He came on a private visit. He has contacts here 
and relations with figures who arranged his visit. He was 
originally on a European and American tour before coming here. 
  [AL-MAJALLAH] Who requested the meeting: the Canadian 
Foreign 
Ministry or al-Turabi? 
  [Gagnon] We asked to meet him when he came here. We thought 
we would take advantage of the opportunity and hear what he had 
to say as an influential personality. 
  [AL-MAJALLAH] What kind of visa was given to al-Turabi? Did 
he arrive in Canada using his real name or under an alias? 
  [Gagnon] Canadian laws on personal freedoms prevent us from 
revealing to a third party any information about al-Turabi's 
passport or the kind of entry visa that was granted to him. 
  [AL-MAJALLAH] Were the discussions at the Foreign Ministry 
meeting limited to political subjects, or did they involve trade 
issues? 
  [Gagnon] The meeting was political. We did not discuss any 
subjects at the meeting having to do with deals, commercial 
matters, or other things.

<F P=106> [Part one of three-part article by 'Uthman Mirghani: "First </F>
Pictures of Al-Turabi in Canadian Hospital After Attack on Him"] 
  [Text] On 3 December last year, the trial of the 
37-year-old Sudanese citizen Hashim Badr-al-Din ended in Canada. 
He was charged with attacking the 62-year-old head of the 
Sudanese National Islamic Front (NIF), Dr. Hasan al-Turabi, who 
in the world's eyes is considered the spiritual guide and 
director of the present government in Khartoum. The verdict by 
the 12-person jury declared the defendant Badr-al-Din innocent 
of the three charges against him (two counts of assault and one 
count of assault causing grave injury). They did so because 
support to uphold the case was lacking due to contradictions and 
discrepancies in the statements of the prosecution witnesses. 
  Instead of lowering the curtain on the case, the verdict has 
raised more debate. The verdict was received in Khartoum with 
further charges that "foreign agencies" had "engineered a plot." 
The Sudanese media attacked the Canadian court's decision as 
biased and unjust. Criticizing the verdict at a press conference 
in Khartoum, Dr. al-Turabi said it was not fair. He noted that 
the attack had targeted him not as an individual, but as "a 
symbol of the Islamic revival." The Popular Arab Islamic 
Conference (a grouping of radical, fundamentalist, leftist, and 
nationalist movements that al-Turabi heads), which was meeting 
in Khartoum when the verdict was announced, issued a statement 
attacking the court's decision. 
  These reactions agreed in explicitly or implicitly charging 
foreign agencies with involvement in a "conspiracy" targeting 
al-Turabi and attempting to liquidate him. Al-Turabi was 
explicit about the matter in his talk to journalists after the 
Popular Arab Islamic Conference meeting. "There is," he said, "a 
complete organization behind the attack"--the one that targeted 
him in Canada. He indicated that "senior European officials" 
were involved, but he refused to identify them. 
  The charges were a restatement of what Sudanese agencies, 
al-Turabi's family, and some Arab fundamentalist movements 
linked to al-Turabi's organization said in the first days after 
the attack about 19 months ago. The Sudanese media talked from 
the beginning about an attempted assassination. Many NIF 
proteges wrote in newspapers about how there were hidden hands 
and foreign parties behind the case. A few days after the 
episode, al-Turabi's family issued a statement signed by Hasan 
al-Turabi's son, Sadiq al-Turabi, accusing foreign agencies of 
standing behind the attack and hinting that the attacker was "a 
tool of other agencies." 
  The statement leveled a number of charges against the 
Canadian authorities. It charged them with having refused to 
provide Dr. al-Turabi with protection during his visit, which 
included Toronto and Ottawa. The police were said to have 
arrived on the scene about 20 minutes after the incident. It 
took about an hour to transport the victims to the 
hospital--from the occurrence of the incident to arrival at the 
hospital. Al-Turabi's family demanded that the Canadian 
authorities issue full information about the incident and its 
circumstances. They warned that failure to maintain "justice and 
fairness in the proceedings of the case would lead to 
complications caused by injustice." 
<H5>  Conspiracy Theory </H5>
  Al-Turabi himself supported the conspiracy theory when about 
two months after the incident he spoke at a press meeting about 
how more than one agency was behind the attack. He indicated 
that two countries were involved, but refused to name them, 
saying that "the time has not yet arrived for that." Others 
linked to Dr. al-Turabi by family or organizational ties joined 
in, though without leveling charges at one particular agency and 
without producing proof and documents to support the conspiracy 
theory. Al-Turabi himself once talked about "a complete 
organization behind the attack." On another occasion he spoke 
about the involvement of "senior European officials," and on a 
third occasion about "the involvement of two countries." 
  On the other hand, the Canadian police indicated that they 
had found no other suspects in the case and pressed charges 
against Hashim Badr-al-Din alone. During the trial sessions, the 
defense attorney indicated that his client, Badr-al-Din, had 
attacked al-Turabi in moments of anger and excitement. If he had 
really wanted to kill al-Turabi, he could have done so while the 
NIF general secretary lay covered on the ground in front of him, 
unconscious after his head had hit the floor following the 
Badr-al-Din's blow that had struck him. 
  The defense attorney also stressed that his client had not 
attempted to flee. Had the episode been planned, he would have 
fled. He had an opportunity to do, as it took some time for the 
police to arrive on the scene. 
  Badr-al-Din himself repeatedly insisted that the attack had 
been an individual act and that his motives had been political. 
He said that he had been at Ottawa Airport by coincidence to say 
goodbye to a friend, when he saw al-Turabi and his followers 
suddenly enter the airport. One should note that al-Turabi 
changed the time of his plane from 1800 to 1900 in the evening, 
a change known to only a few of the NIF general secretary's 
aides and Sudanese embassy officials in Ottawa. 
  Badr-al-Din justified the attack as an expression of "a 
feeling of injustice with regard to what the Sudanese people 
were suffering from NIF rule." He said that he "rejected what is 
being practiced in Sudan today in the name of Islam--things of 
which Islam is innocent." In questioning, at the trial, and in 
his statements to the press, he denied having used karate in 
striking al-Turabi. He said that if he had wanted to use a 
karate technique, he would have used his foot in the attack, as 
most of his strength was concentrated in his foot. 
  Badr-al-Din, who is a religious man and a Sufi, said he had 
been involved previously in heated debate with other members of 
the NIF leadership, with which he says he disagrees strongly. He 
spoke of a confrontation and altercation between himself and 
'Ali 'Uthman Muhammad Taha, al-Turabi's deputy in the NIF 
leadership, in New York before a crowd of people and of 
altercations with other NIF leaders in other countries, all of 
them acrimonious. He said he should have liked to argue with 
al-Turabi, had the opportunity arisen for him in Canada. 
<H5>  Conflicting Statements by Witnesses </H5>
  Argument over motives and circumstances will continue, given 
the sharp disagreement of viewpoint and accounts between the two 
sides and given the contradictions and discrepancies among the 
prosecution witnesses who appeared before the Canadian court 
that heard the case. Perhaps the witnesses' contradictory 
statements played the greatest part in influencing the decision 
of the jury and the court, especially after one of the three 
main witnesses, Muhammad Ibrahim Rashid (a Somali who was one of 
al-Turabi's guards when the attack occurred) changed his account 
several times. In his statements after the incident describing 
the attack to the police, Rashid said that Badr-al-Din had 
attacked him also, just as he had attacked al-Turabi and Ahmad 
'Uthman Makki (one of al-Turabi's close aides who helped arrange 
the trip to the United States and Canada). During the trial, 
Rashid changed his account to say that he had been in the second 
car that accompanied al-Turabi to Ottawa Airport the evening of 
25 May 1992 (the evening of the attack). He did not see the 
attack, because he entered the hall of the airport a few minutes 
after al-Turabi and Ahmad 'Uthman Makki, at which time he saw 
al-Turabi stretched out on the floor, bleeding, while 
Badr-al-Din stood near al-Turabi shouting hostile political 
slogans. 
  Under intense cross-examination by the defense attorney, 
Rashid admitted that he had not seen the attack on al-Turabi and 
that Badr-al-Din had not hit him personally, but had only tried 
to do so. Faced with the defense attorney's insistence, his 
pressure, and his demand for an explanation of the discrepancy 
in Rashid's statements, the witness admitted that his first 
statements had not been correct, and he told the court that 
Ahmad 'Uthman Makki had suggested that he make such statements. 
  It was clear throughout the court sessions that the strategy 
of Badr-al-Din's defense attorney was based on showing 
discrepancies among the statements of the witnesses. He also 
concentrated on uncovering any gaps in the testimony of the main 
prosecution witness, Ahmad 'Uthman Makki. Therefore the most 
heated court sessions were those that witnessed sharp 
confrontations between the defense attorney, Gary Barnes, and 
Makki, who is also considered an NIF leader. He has been 
responsible for NIF publicity and for coordinating NIF 
activities and contacts in the United States. The defense 
attorney demanded clarification of the motives for al-Turabi's 
visit to Canada and whether it had taken place in the name of 
the Sudanese Government or in the name of an international 
Islamic organization. He also insisted on knowing the agency 
that had funded the trip. He rejected witness Makki's assertion 
that "a friend" whose identity he did not reveal had arranged 
the funding. 
  In a rapid-fire exchange of questions and answers, the 
defense attorney asked witness Makki about Dr. al-Turabi's 
position in the current government in Sudan--whether he was the 
real ruler or had influence in the government--and in what 
capacity he had visited Canada. Makki replied that al-Turabi was 
a noted religious figure and that he had visited Canada in that 
capacity and had discussed many general issues. As for the 
extent of his influence on the present Sudanese Government, he 
said it was a matter of debate and individual opinion. 
  However, the defense attorney insisted on obtaining a more 
exact definition of al-Turabi's position. Makki replied that 
al-Turabi presently holds the position of general secretary of 
the Khartoum-based Popular Arab Islamic Conference. Taking up 
the same thread once more, the attorney asked whether this 
organization was part of an international Islamic organization. 
  Attempting to prove his claim that al-Turabi led an 
international organization, the defense attorney went on to ask 
Ahmad 'Uthman Makki about his personal position and current 
source of support, why he divided his residence between Sudan 
and the United States, and about his organizational ties with 
al-Turabi. 
  During the discussion about his residence in the United 
States, Makki was forced to withdraw his previous statements to 
the court that the reason for his presence in Chicago had been 
to obtain a graduate degree from the university there. About his 
source of support, he said he was drawing a salary from the 
Islamic Call Organization. 
  Replying to the defense attorney's questions, Makki 
mentioned 
that he was not working in the present government, nor had he 
worked in previous governments in Sudan. He said his relation 
with al-Turabi was one of friendship, not a party relationship 
between a leader and his follower. He denied being a member of 
the Muslim Brotherhood, saying that he had left the organization 
65 years ago because of disagreements over certain matters. 
<H5>  Member of Parliament </H5>
  When the attorney insisted on knowing whether the witness 
was 
a member of any political organization, Makki said he was 
connected only with a cultural, religious, and social 
organization--the NIF, which he refused to call a political 
party. However, the attorney returned to continue his questions 
on another occasion and asked Makki to inform the court whether 
during the now-ended democratic period he had ever become a 
member of the Sudanese Constituent Assembly (Parliament) 
representing a particular body. Makki answered affirmatively, 
saying that he had won as an NIF candidate. 
  As for his present job and capacity, Makki said he was an 
Islamic missionary in an international Islamic organization 
called "Islamic Call." When the attorney during one session 
asked about the capacity in which he had stayed as a guest of 
the Sudanese charge d'affaires in Canada during his visit with 
al-Turabi to Ottawa, Makki replied that it had not occurred 
because he had a governmental capacity, but only because he had 
been a friend of the charge d'affaires since their student days 
together at Khartoum University. The attorney then questioned 
before the court how Makki could say that he and al-Turabi had 
no official capacity when he had already mentioned that the two 
had informed the Sudanese charge d'affaires of the tenor of 
their conversations with Canadian Government officials before 
heading to Ottawa Airport, where they were attacked. 
  The defense attorney also got into an intense argument with 
Ahmad 'Uthman Makki over his description of the attack at the 
airport. Because Makki's testimony was vital to the progress of 
the case, the attorney tried to cast doubt on it or demolish it 
completely by proving the existence of contradictions or 
discrepancies in it. For example, when Makki mentioned that he 
tried to intervene to protect al-Turabi by throwing himself on 
him while the general secretary was stretched out motionless on 
the floor because of Badr-al-Din's blow that had struck him, the 
attorney intervened to say that the witness's version was 
inexact and that there were witnesses who could appear in court 
to say that the witness had quickly retreated when Badr-al-Din 
struck him and had taken refuge in the area behind the airport 
escalator. Makki rejected the attorney's assertion and said he 
would be surprised if any witnesses said he had hidden behind 
the escalator. 
  The defense attorney also contested Makki's testimony that 
the defendant Badr-al-Din had tried to escape after his attack 
on al-Turabi. Attorney Barnes said that a number of witnesses as 
well as policemen had stated that Badr-al-Din remained in his 
place inside the airport until the police arrived 20 minutes 
later and arrested him. 
<H5>  Al-Turabi, Looni </H5>
  During the questioning in court, the defense attorney 
indicated that al-Turabi had used an alias while in Canada. He 
referred to this name as Looni (Martin Looni, according to some 
sources). The defense attorney asked Makki whether he and 
al-Turabi were traveling under their real names. Makki replied 
that he himself had entered Canada under his real name, but he 
indicated that al-Turabi may have traveled under the name of H. 
'Abdallah. (Al-Turabi's full name is Hasan 'Abdallah al-Turabi). 
When the attorney asked Makki whether he knew a person named 
Looni and whether al-Turabi had used the name on his trip, the 
witness replied in the negative. 
  Regardless of the name that al-Turabi used on his trip, he 
certainly used an alias when he arrived in Ottawa. For this 
reason, airport security officials, who did not know that 
al-Turabi was in the airport on that day, became confused. It 
should be noted that they were trying to wait for him in order 
to provide him protection. 
  The available information indicates that Canadian 
intelligence sent the Ottawa police a warning about possible 
danger to al-Turabi, especially after the protest demonstrations 
that confronted him during his European and American tour and 
after he reached Toronto. But it seems that an error occurred 
because of technicalities in the Canadian system: instead of 
informing the Gloucester police, who have jurisdiction over the 
airport, intelligence directed its information to the Ottawa 
police. 
  An inspector named Phil Lockett from the Gloucester City 
Police, which has jurisdiction over the airport, informed 
AL-MAJALLAH that they learned of al-Turabi's arrival at Ottawa 
Airport only at a later time, the morning of the day he arrived 
to meet officials in the Canadian Foreign Ministry. He indicated 
that the information they received from intelligence came late. 
Lockett added: "The error came about because we were not 
informed of the alias under which al-Turabi was traveling. Thus, 
when we looked for al-Turabi's name in the airport records, we 
did not find it." 
  Similarly, no one informed the airport of the change in the 
scheduled departure of al-Turabi's plane from Ottawa to Toronto 
the evening of 25 May. The security men waited half an hour at 
the airport. When al-Turabi did not arrive, they left the area, 
thinking that he might have changed his schedule. 
  Al-Turabi in fact arrived about 20 minutes later, and the 
confrontation and attack then took place. 
<H5>  Questions About Medical Report </H5>
  Other questions were raised during the trial, particularly 
regarding al-Turabi's state of health immediately after the 
attack. The medical report submitted to the court, as well as 
the testimony of the physician Vasco da Silva, who supervised 
the treatment of al-Turabi, revealed that the NIF general 
secretary suffered a slight concussion to the brain and light 
swelling on the left side of the back of the head. Swelling was 
visible on his upper lip and some blood in his nose when he 
arrived at Civic Hospital in Ottawa the evening of 25 May after 
the attack on him. 
  The report indicated that al-Turabi spent his first night in 
the hospital's intensive care room. He was breathing normally. 
His blood pressure and heartbeat were also normal. Dr. da Silva 
told the Ottawa court that when al-Turabi was brought to the 
hospital, he responded to the verbal instructions he heard, but 
his replies to questions were not clear or logical. 
  Da Silva said that al-Turabi was moved the next day (26 May 
1992) from intensive care to the brain surgery ward. He 
mentioned that he allowed a Sudanese physician to examine 
al-Turabi at the request of the patient's family and that the 
physician advised using certain drugs in the treatment. 
  A deterioration in al-Turabi's health became visible after 
the third day in the hospital. Surveying and mapping operations 
indicated a larger concussion to the brain. Al-Turabi completely 
lost the power to speak and appeared severely fatigued and 
dizzy. He therefore had to be returned to intensive care. 
  According to the physician's report, about a week after his 
admission to the hospital, al-Turabi developed a reaction to one 
of the drugs given him. The defense attorney at the trial 
questioned why Dr. da Silva had allowed another physician from 
outside the hospital (the physician that al-Turabi's family 
summoned) to examine al-Turabi and interfere in his treatment. 
The attorney also raised a number of other questions about 
whether Dr. da Silva knew al-Turabi's medical history. The 
doctor denied any knowledge of it. 
  The subsequent deterioration of al-Turabi's health raised 
questions. There was a discussion of whether the blow he had 
received during the attack had caused the damage or whether his 
head's hitting the floor had caused the concussion. 
  Al-Turabi remained in the Canadian hospital about 25 days. 
Not until 13 June 1992, 19 days after entering the hospital, did 
he regain his ability to talk, according to the medical report 
submitted to the Ottawa court. 
  Indications by the physician that al-Turabi may need long 
subsequent treatment in a specialized European or American 
hospital have raised speculations about the effects of the 
incident on him. 
  [Box, p 22] 
<H5>  The Attack </H5>
  The attack on al-Turabi took place the evening of 25 May 
1992 
at Ottawa Airport. 
  Al-Turabi was trying to catch a plane from Ottawa to 
Toronto. 
With him were NIF leader Ahmad 'Uthman Makki and a Somali 
companion named Muhammad Ibrahim. There was also a Pakistani 
with Canadian citizenship named Ziyad Muzaffar, who helped 
arrange the NIF general secretary's visit to Canada. 
  Hashim Badr-al-Din, according to accounts, was at the 
airport 
saying goodbye to one of the Sudanese who had come from Toronto 
to take part in a protest demonstration against al-Turabi in 
Ottawa. 
  According to statements by Hashim Badr-al-Din and 
eyewitnesses, when Badr-al-Din saw al-Turabi hurry into the 
airport, he ran toward him shouting political slogans in Arabic 
and English: "Murderer, murderer! Terrorist, terrorist!" 
  Ahmad 'Uthman Makki tried to block Badr-al-Din and push him 
away, but the latter slapped Makki hard with his right hand, 
forcing him to retreat. 
  Hashim Badr-al-Din says that he struck al-Turabi a single 
blow on the face. Al-Turabi fell; his head struck the floor, and 
he lost consciousness. 
  The Somali companion, Muhammad Ibrahim, tried to grab Hashim 
Badr-al-Din, but the latter wheeled round and pushed him back; 
so Ibrahim withdrew. Ziyad Muzaffar also tried to approach 
Badr-al-Din, but stopped when the latter turned to confront him. 
  Badr-al-Din remained in his place shouting his political 
slogans. The police arrived on the scene about 20 minutes later. 
An ambulance arrived afterward to take al-Turabi and Makki to 
the hospital. 
  Badr-al-Din revealed in his statements that he was taken to 
the hospital for treatment of his hand, which was bleeding. He 
said that during the scuffle between him and al-Turabi, the 
latter bit him on the hand. 
  Badr-al-Din was taken later to the police station to make a 
statement. He was released two days later to appear in court on 
2 June 1992, at which time he was charged with three counts of 
assault. 
  Because al-Turabi made no statements to the police, the only 
versions of the incident were those by Hashim Badr-al-Din, Ahmad 
'Uthman Makki, Muhammad Ibrahim, and Ziyad Muzaffar, in addition 
to a few Canadian eyewitnesses who had been at the airport. 
  Al-Turabi did not appear in court. The prosecutor said that 
the NIF general secretary had informed the authorities that he 
recalled no details of the attack.

<F P=106> [Article signed N.O.: "The FNS-2626 (National Solidarity </F>
Fund) Program for 1994; 151,000 Recipients, 142 Towns, and 302 
Projects"--first paragraph is LA PRESSE DE TUNISIE introduction] 
  [Text] "The sustained rate at which the first 1993 
installment was completed provided a good argument in favor of 
an ambitious 1994 program," according to Mr. Abdelkrim Azaiez, 
FNS [National Solidarity Fund] president. 
  Thanks to the climate of confidence established in the 
country since the change, and thanks to the sunshine measures 
adopted with respect to the handling of collected funds, the 
programs launched by the FNS (2626) in 1993 were very 
successful. This success marks the emergence of an unprecedented 
spirit of solidarity in Tunisia which, with this unique 
experiment, has found the most efficient way to enable mutual 
aid and solidarity to take root among citizens, and to fight 
poverty wherever it may be. 
  Already, the results achieved are more than satisfactory 
since 27 million dinars[D] were spent in 108 different towns on 
behalf of 141,600 destitute individuals and to start 272 
projects. 
  The projects, launched in the country's disadvantaged, 
remote, and isolated regions aim to improve the living 
conditions of citizens, in particular the underprivileged, to 
promote their integration in their respective environment, and 
to create conditions enabling them to settle down. This is why 
priority is given to infrastructure projects in these still 
underdeveloped regions, to provide them with electricity, 
drinking water, paved and unpaved roads, schools and medical 
clinics, and eventually to create stable jobs, especially in 
farming. 
  In this respect, Mr. Abdelkrim Azaiez, chairman of the FNS 
standing commission indicated yesterday, at a press conference, 
that "the sustained rate at which the first 1993 installment was 
completed provided a good argument in favor of an ambitious 1994 
program." Besides, the restricted ministers council of 17 
February took note with pleasure of the satisfactory completion 
of the FNS 1993 programs and of the new projects adopted for 
1994, to which D35 million were allocated. 
<H5>  All Regions Affected </H5>
  To assess the impact of the projects started in 1993, Mr. 
Abdelkrim Azaiez enumerated the construction of 2,830 housing 
units, 18 primary schools, 29 clinics, and 257 km of roads of 
which 120 km were paved. 
  All of the country's remote, isolated, and poor regions were 
affected by these programs. And the people in these regions, 
which could not be provided with water or electricity under 
ordinary government programs, can now measure the results of 
this beautiful instance of national solidarity initiated by 
President Ben Ali. 
  To ensure that these people remain on location, special 
programs designed to improve their living conditions were 
already launched, and financing of up to D1.6 million was 
provided by the Rural Development Program. 
  The 1994 program promises to be ambitious since it will 
affect 151,000 individuals and 142 towns, and will involve the 
completion of 302 projects. 
  This program was prepared on the basis of objective criteria 
adopted after consultations with regional authorities and visits 
on location by members of the FNS standing commission. 
<H5>  The Northwest and West Central Regions </H5>
  Mr. Abdelkrim Azaiez announced that the second installment 
of 
the programs launched in November 1993 will be completed by next 
May. He added that cost control was an essential consideration 
in completing these projects. There is no secret in that, 
considering that contractors who take on FNS-financed projects 
cut their profit margins to a minimum, that technical studies 
are performed in the regions for free, and that FNS management 
is so flexible that construction companies are reimbursed for 
their expenses without delay. 
  As far as the regional distribution of projects and credits 
is concerned, we can say that the northwest and west central 
regions were those that benefitted most from FNS projects. 
<H5>  Assessment by Academics </H5>
  To fight poverty and the lack of infrastructures, the 
northwest region was granted a budget of D6.7 million in 1993; 
this amount was increased to D9.4 million in 1994. The west 
central region (Kasserine, Kairouan, and Sidi Bouzid) will be 
allocated about D6.2 million in 1994. 
  Mr. Abdelkrim Azaiez indicated that, following the 
completion 
of the first 1993 program instalment, the standing commission 
invited academics and researchers from the Tunis University 
Center for Economic and Social Studies and Research to give 
their opinion on the methods used to establish priorities and 
select towns and projects, and to evaluate the impact of these 
projects on the beneficiaries. On the whole, the evaluation of 
these experts was satisfactory. 
  Mr. Abdelkrim Azaiez concluded by estimating that, in spite 
of the considerable effort made, there is still a long way to 
go, which means that the national solidarity effort must be 
consolidated in order to fight poverty efficiently. 
  Besides, at the restricted ministers council of 17 February, 
the chief of state recommended to develop a plan so that the FNS 
could operate in all the dark areas within the next seven years. 
  Actually, 1,780 dark areas have been identified to date, 
with 
a total population of 1 million; these zones include 18,258 
slums and 79,730 poor families. 
  A 1992 evaluation of the credits required to reach all these 
areas shows that at least D714 million must be found. 
  Today, we have somehow completed the first few steps, which 
are also the most difficult. But now that confidence and 
sunshine methods characterize the allocation of these credits in 
the new Tunisia, the spirit of solidarity will be expected to 
express itself more strongly. Its scope and significance are of 
crucial importance and, with the confidence that now prevails in 
the country, it should find more than one way to thrive.
