Losing Its Patience''] 
  [Text] ``Shoot them in the back or treat them'' was the 
discussion topic when citizens, drug addicts, police, and care 
providers from the Vesterbro section of Copenhagen met yesterday 
to talk about drug problems in their hard-hit part of town. 
  The usual tolerance of the people of Vesterbro toward the 
numerous drug addicts with whom they share their streets, 
alleys, and even their stairways and back yards, is beginning to 
fall apart. As a result, the people are demanding more places of 
asylum for drug addicts, more outreach, more treatment centers, 
and more recreational facilities for the area's children, so 
that they do not turn to drugs. 
  But the people of Vesterbro are also tired of having their 
neighborhood be a magnet for drug addicts from all other parts 
of town. The other sections of Copenhagen and the rest of the 
country must be obligated to make their own effort to stop 
exporting their drug addicts to Vesterbro, many people said. 
  Although snow wrapped the neighborhood in a dense white 
haze, 
many people attended the hearing at the Vesterbro House of 
Culture. 
  Leo Lorke from the police stressed the need for better 
cooperation among the many entities that are working with drug 
addicts. Ole Hansgaard and Niels Christense, representing the 
drug addicts of Vesterbro, called for greater tolerance. ``Even 
though we have a serious problem, we are not second-class 
people,'' they said. 
  Physician Karsten Chr. Hansen called for better treatment 
for 
drug addicts. ``All too often, drug addicts have been singled 
out and given special treatment in a negative sense. If we are 
to make progress, drug addicts must be seen as people like us, 
with individual needs.'' 
  The goal of the hearing was to create a dialog among the 
various sides, which it did. Now their demands are being sent to 
the politicians at Christiansborg [parliament building].

Police To Be Reinforced''] 
  [Text] ``You can take a dart and throw it at a map of the 
country. Wherever it happens to land, you could open a drug 
case.'' 
  Per Kanding, chief of the national police force's mobile 
squad, believes that too little is being done to counter the 
growing drug problem. 
  ``Many small police districts are not doing enough in drug 
cases. They do not have the resources. After all, the drug trade 
is not a crime that is reported and, as a result, drug cases are 
often put on the back burner in favor of crimes that are 
reported,'' Kanding said. 
  He believes there must be a reprioritizing of police 
resources if we are really interested in doing something in this 
area. He is supported in this by Justice Minister Erling Olsen 
(Social Democrat). 
  ``The police will not get more resources, but those we have 
must be used differently. I would like to see the effort against 
organized crime--including drug crimes--be strengthened. 
Consequently, some policemen must accept being shifted to other 
duties.'' He did not wish to reveal what jobs the police would 
no longer do, but he was certain enough police could be 
transferred. 
  Yesterday the United Nations published its annual report for 
1993. It revealed that the global drug trade was becoming more 
extensive and more aggressive. In particular, Denmark must 
protect itself from drugs being brought in by way of the chaotic 
countries of East Europe.

<F P=106> [Article by Lotte Mejlhede and Mikkel Thrane: ``Harsh </F>
Criticism of Drug Plan''] 
  [Text] Disappointment and only a few pats on the 
back. That is what greeted the government's long-awaited drug 
policy review yesterday. 
  There is inadequate financing. The government does not 
seriously come to grips with the stress strategy used by the 
police. Control is not scaled down. There are no new ideas 
here. 
  These harsh words came from treatment providers, drug 
addicts, doctors, and several politicians when the health, 
social affairs, and justice ministers presented the government's 
long-awaited report yesterday. 
  There was especially harsh criticism of the lack of 
financial 
support for the initiatives. 
  Among other things the report says that home communities 
will 
be compelled to finance more county treatment slots ``in such a 
way that it does not lead to additional total public 
expenditure.'' 
  ``That is pure pyrotechnics. A dead addict is the cheapest 
addict for municipalities. Additional treatment will always cost 
more--even if efficiency is increased. If money does not 
accompany the initiatives they cannot amount to anything,'' said 
Peter Ege, a welfare doctor in Copenhagen. 
  The Medical Association is also disappointed: 
  ``The financial support is inadequate. It is necessary to 
spend money to ensure better living conditions for drug addicts. 
The government has repressed the idea that not all drug addicts 
can be made drug-free, with or without methadone,'' said Medical 
Association chairman Torben Pedersen. 
  The government plans to get its ideas funded in the upcoming 
economic talks with the counties and municipalities. But the 
Progress Party and SF [Socialist People's Party] do not believe 
in that solution: 
  ``The state itself should earmark an amount in the 
billion-kroner class to go directly to treatment centers,'' said 
Tom Behnke, drug policy spokesman for the Progress Party. SF 
also thinks the state should lead the way. 
  In addition to financing, the control policy was sharply 
criticized. 
  ``If control efforts are given a lower priority many drug 
addicts will have a more tranquil and stable life while society 
will have less crime and unrest,'' the chairman of the Medical 
Association maintained. 
<H5>  Confrontation With Stress Strategy </H5>
  His attitude was supported by a broad circle of treatment 
providers and judges BERLINGSKE TIDENDE spoke to. 
  ``The police effort should be changed so that they no longer 
focus on individual addicts. This has not produced results,'' 
said Hans Henrik Brydensholt, a judge at Eastern High Court. 
  But he also thinks the report sets the stage for a 
confrontation with the stress strategy later on. 
  ``The report is a big step in the right direction. After 25 
years of emphasizing control, I think the politicians have 
realized that the drug problem must be solved through treatment 
and prevention,'' said Brydensholt. 
  Justice Minister Erling Olsen (Social Democrat) himself 
wants 
to change the effort on the street, but said this can only 
happen gradually--in parallel with stepping up treatment. 
  Conservatives and Liberals expressed moderate support for 
the 
government's report. 
  But the parties think the police effort should be increased 
and that stronger steps should be taken against hashish smoking 
among young people.

<F P=106> [Editorial: ``Defensive Drug Initiative''] </F>
  [Text] The government calls it an action plan. But there 
are more words than action in the proposal for a drug policy 
reorientation that was presented by three ministries yesterday 
as a token of what four government parties can agree on. And it 
is not much. The best that can be said of the plan is that it 
will hardly make the situation worse. The worst: that it will 
not make it much better either. 
  The vague government initiative must be assessed in the 
light 
of a collective realization that the drug policy that has been 
pursued for the past 20 years has failed. It has not limited the 
number of drug abusers; it has not helped the country's 
intravenous drug users, now 10,000 strong; and it has not 
reduced drug-related crimes. On the contrary. 
  That is why responsible doctors and police personnel have 
also contested the entire strategy behind the drug policy. The 
viewpoint is that only through supervised provision of 
drugs--and methadone--can one make life bearable for the 
``incurable'' abusers and at the same time stop the drug-related 
crime wave. It is possible. But having state drug addicts is not 
an option in a humane society. The government also maintains in 
the plan that there can be no question of legalizing drugs, nor 
does it intend to relax police efforts against drug kingpins or 
people at the street level. But aside from appointing a drug 
committee, transferring methadone treatment to the counties, 
providing additional training for treatment personnel, and 
issuing a number of unfinanced statements of intent that call on 
counties and municipalities to expand treatment programs, the 
report is characterized by a modest level of ambition. There 
are no easy solutions to the problem. But that does not prohibit 
people from thinking more offensively than defensively. More 
action, fewer words, please.

<F P=106> [Article by Anders Wiig: ``Two Prisoners Involved in New </F>
Drug Case''] 
  [Text] The narcotics police have arrested two South 
American drug smugglers who are serving long sentences in 
Vridsloselille. 
  The narcotics police have arrested two South American drug 
gangsters who are serving long prison sentences in the state 
prison in Vridsloselille. 
  Yesterday Detective Inspector Anette Vester brought the two 
prisoners before a judge at a closed preliminary examination in 
Copenhagen, after which both men were placed in isolation cells 
while the police investigate new charges against them. 
  They are now charged with involvement in the smuggling and 
attempted smuggling of 500 grams of cocaine into Denmark while 
they were serving their sentences here. 
  The smuggling of 200 grams failed because a courier was 
arrested on 31 January of this year. 
  The two men's position on the new charges is not known. Both 
have previously smuggled large quantities of cocaine into 
Denmark and were sentenced by the Supreme Court. 
  The now 26-year-old Colombian, Norman Caicedo Espinosa, was 
sentenced to six years in prison on 20 October for smuggling in 
1.5 kilograms of drugs concealed in a skateboard. 
  The 46-year-old Bolivian, Bitmarck Figuerca Frey, is serving 
eight years in prison. He smuggled 7.8 kg of cocaine, some in an 
attache case with a false bottom and some taped to his body. 
  The jury did not believe his explanation that he thought it 
was gold. And the public prosecutor also pointed out that a 
quantity of gold corresponding to the cocaine that was found 
would have weighed 150 kg. 
<H5>  Charged in Big Cocaine Case </H5>
  The two were charged in connection with the same group of 
cases in which 13 other foreigners and Danes have been charged 
with the smuggling and attempted smuggling of around 45 kg of 
cocaine. 
  It is Denmark's biggest cocaine case and the alleged 
ringleader, another Colombian, was arrested in January--also 
while serving a sentence in Vridsloselille. 
  Incidentally, there appears to be some confusion or 
uncertainty about Frey's and Espinosa's nationality, with Deputy 
Commissioner Peer Ivar Petersen of the narcotics police 
referring to them as a Spaniard and a Chilean prior to the court 
session.

  [Excerpts] Following a tip, the Copenhagen Vice Squad 
raided a residence in Norrebro. In the apartment police found a 
kilogram of so-called smoke-heroin. [passage omitted] A Kenyan 
married couple with three minor children received a shock when 
people from the Copenhagen Police Vice Squad suddenly were 
standing in their apartment in Stevnesgade in Norrebro Monday 
[28 March] afternoon. In the apartment were found small bags 
containing so-called smoke-heroin (``brown sugar'') which had 
just been readied for street sale. A total of around 700 grams 
were seized. In addition, police found 38,000 kroner and $22,000 
thought to have come from drug trafficking. The heroin has a 
street value of around 150,000 kroner. 
  But the police also searched a 33-year-old Tanzanian who was 
visiting. An additional 300 grams was found by police in the 
heel of his shoe. 
  Heroin is most popular in its smoked form. Social workers 
and 
narcotics police are currently concerned that many of the very 
young have gone over to smoke-heroin in the belief that it is 
not addictive. 
  The couple, aged 39 and 37, appeared yesterday with the 
Tanzanian in court, where all three were charged with drug 
trafficking. [passage omitted]

<F P=106> [Finnish News Service report: ``Five Years for Amphetamines </F>
and Hashish Trafficking in Helsinki''] 
  [Text] The Helsinki District Court on Wednesday [6 April] 
sentenced five men to prison terms with no possibility of parole 
after convicting them of narcotics violations. Three kingpins in 
the organization were also ordered to hand over to the state the 
tens of thousands of markkas in profits they received from drug 
selling. 
  The longest sentence, six and a half years, was given to 
Nils 
Erik Sjoberg. He was convicted on two counts of felony drug 
violations and five misdemeanor drug violations. 
  Sjoberg had received and passed on altogether three 
kilograms 
of hashish and 50 to 100 grams of amphetamines in the period of 
summer 1991 to February 1993. He was arrested at his residence, 
from which was seized a little over two kilograms of 
amphetamines and well over a kilogram of hashish. 
  Of the others convicted, Janne Hautapaakkanen was given a 
prison sentence of four and a half years, and Markko Franken 
three years. Neither will be able to receive parole. 
  In addition to felony drug charges, Hautapaakkanen was also 
convicted on four weapons violation counts. Found on his 
possession was a so-called tear pistol, which can only fire one 
round. The court considered this aggravating, since this type of 
weapon is used only for committing crimes. 
  Franken's sentence came from two felony drug counts and 
several misdemeanor drug counts. 
  In addition, two others received sentences to six and seven 
months of prison without chance of parole.

  [Text] Munich, April 15 (CTK) -- Bavarian Interior Minister 
Gunther Beckstein today described Czech-Bavarian cooperation in 
the drive against organized crime as excellent. 
  ``Policemen in both (bordering) countries are well aware of 
the fact that criminals, not national contradictions, are their 
common enemies. The problems which appear in big politics are 
fortunately not felt in security policy,'' Beckstein said in an 
interview with CTK. 
  He said he considered car smuggling, documents forgery, 
illegal migration and antiques smuggling from the Czech Republic 
the main problems on the common Bavarian-Czech border. 
  ``Antiques smuggling considerably harms the Czech 
Republic,'' 
said Beckstein, adding that Bavaria ``has taken many successful 
steps in this respect. The Czechs did so in the smuggling of 
German cars.'' 
  The Czech-Bavarian border is also the main route for heroin 
smugglers. Last year customs officials seized 520 kilograms on 
the Czech-Bavarian border and 531 kilograms the year before. 
  With regard to illegal immigration, Beckstein said Bavaria 
wanted a readmission agreement between the Czech Republic and 
Germany to be concluded soon. 
  In 1993 Bavarian border guards detained almost 1,700 people 
smuggling refugees, of whom 1,285 were seized on the 
Czech-Bavarian border and the rest on the Bavarian-Austrian 
border.

  [Excerpts] In the biggest Swiss case of money-laundering so 
far, about $150 million were seized at the Swiss Banking Society 
(SBG). Criminal proceedings have been initiated against a 
long-standing deputy director of the biggest Swiss bank in 
Zurich, as the responsible authorities have announced. 
  According to information released by Jacques Antenen, deputy 
investigating judge of Waadt canton, the seizing of $150 million 
at the SBG took place in connection with investigations against 
suspected money-launderers of the Colombian Medellin drug 
cartel. The responsible Zurich district prosecutor's office is 
convinced that the approximately $150 million is dirty money, as 
District Prosecutor Dieter Jann-Corrodi said upon inquiry. ``I 
have not heard of any bigger case anywhere in the world so 
far,'' he said. 
<H5>  Investigations Since June 1993 </H5>
  Since June 1993 the Waadt judiciary has been investigating 
Colombian citizens who belong to a criminal organization located 
in the Colombian town of Barranquilla and are linked with the 
Medellin cartel. They are suspected of having violated the 
regulations concerning money-laundering in the cantons of Waadt, 
Neuenburg, and Geneva. According to Antenen, they invested 
money in, among other things, a restaurant and other real estate 
properties, but that was less than 1 million Swiss francs. 
According to the Waadt investigating judge, investigations are 
being carried out together with the U.S. Drug Enforcement 
Administration and the authorities in Zurich and are also spread 
to the cantons of Neuenburg and Geneva. On 23 February a 
Colombian woman was arrested; she is still in detention pending 
trial. Within the framework of the investigations, the Waadt 
judicial authorities applied to the authorities in Zurich for 
legal aid to seize the more than $150 million at the SBG. 
<H5>  SBG Deputy Director Claims He Knows Nothing </H5>
  In Zurich criminal investigations have been initiated 
against 
the SBG deputy director, who acted as a trustee. The Zurich 
district prosecutor's office accused the deputy director of 
having long known about the dirty origin of the money but not 
having reacted when the penal law on money-laundering came into 
force in August 1990. His temporary arrest was announced on 27 
February. [passage omitted] The deputy director claims not to 
have known anything about the dirty origin of the money, 
District Prosecutor Jann-Corrode said. [passage omitted]

<F P=106> [Ian Rodger report: ``$150m Held in UBS Account by Wife of </F>
Suspected Drug Dealer''] 
  [Text] The pride of leading Swiss bankers in the care they 
take to avoid handling dirty money has been bruised by 
revelations that Union Bank of Switzerland [UBS] has been 
holding $150m (102.7m pounds) in Zurich for an alleged Colombian 
drug dealer for several years. 
  Although it is by far the largest amount of drug money 
uncovered in a Swiss bank, the account is not the first of its 
kind. In 1989 a parliamentary commission accused the public 
prosecutor of laxity in pursuing narcotics investigations, and a 
book with the cheeky title, La Suisse Lave Plus Blac 
(Switzerland Washes Whiter), became a best-seller. 
  But this latest case is a surprise in the light of the 
efforts made by Swiss authorities in the last few years to 
outlaw money-laundering and force banks to stop dealing with 
criminals. 
  The controversy began when Mrs. Sheila Miriam Arana de 
Nasser, who held the account, applied in January for permission 
to buy her house near Geneva. 
  As with every foreigner, Swiss authorities insisted on 
checking her background and bank references. With the help of 
US drug enforcement officials, they identified her as the wife 
of Mr. Julio Nasser David, sought as a leading drug trafficker 
in Colombia. 
  On February 23, Mrs. Arana was arrested by Swiss police and 
the account frozen. On Friday, charges were filed in Miami 
against the couple for smuggling more than 55,000 lbs of cocaine 
and 3 million lbs of marijuana [amounts as published] into the 
U.S. from 1976. Mr. Nasser David is still at large, and the US 
is seeking Mrs. Arana's extradition from Switzerland. 
  The UBS vice-president who opened and handled Mrs. Arana's 
account has been suspended and is being questioned by Zurich 
police. The Swiss Bankers' Association due diligence committee 
has launched an inquiry. 
  The big question among Zurich's banking community is how 
UBS, 
renowned as the most cautious and meticulous of banks, could 
have failed for so long to have spotted trouble in the Arana 
account. According to the authorities, she opened it in 1979 
with a $50m cash deposit. UBS claims it carried out its normal 
identity checks which showed the family had extensive shipping 
and hotel interests in Colombia, so there was no reason to 
suspect anything untoward. 
  ``Not every Colombian is a potential money-launderer,'' says 
Mr. Stephan Haeringer, a UBS director. However UBS admits that 
the account manager must have been very naive. 
  Swiss laws and regulations on money-laundering were 
tightened 
in the late 1980s. Analysts were asking why UBS, which has a 
100-strong internal audit team, did not pay special attention to 
accounts from places such as Colombia and Sicily with known 
links to drug smuggling. 
  Apparently not much effort was required. A Zurich prosecutor 
says that even the children in the Nasser Davids' home town of 
Barranquilla were aware of the alleged drug links. The bank 
says the account has been virtually inactive for many years, so 
there was no reason for suspicion. 
  ``The manager's superiors asked questions and got 
appropriate 
answers,'' UBS said. ``We are now checking to see if we have to 
change our procedures.''

<F P=106> [Interview with Major General of Justice Leonid Ivanovich </F>
Titarov, deputy chief of the investigative unit of the Russian 
Ministry of Internal Affairs Investigative Committee, by Natalya 
Kozlova; place, date not given: ``Billions Without a 
Break-In''--first paragraph is introduction] 
  [Text] The profession of safecracker or expert in blowing 
open safes, which is highly respected in the criminal world, 
seems to have reached the end of the line. I was told this by 
Major General of Justice Leonid Ivanovich Titarov, deputy chief 
of the investigative unit of the Russian Ministry of Internal 
Affairs [MVD] Investigative Committee. 
  Kozlova: So who beat the safecracker? 
  Titarov: Time. It has become unprofitable to rob 
safes nowadays. After all, how much money can you put in a 
safe? Perhaps 5 million, 10 million, or 15 million.... It is 
impossible to fit any more in. At any rate, there are no cases 
pending involving safecrackers. Nor have there been for a long 
time. 
  Kozlova: What cases are Investigative Committee 
investigators looking into at the present time? 
  Titarov: Investigators from two departments are 
working with criminal cases--the departments for top priority 
cases and organized crime and corruption. As a rule, 
investigators from these departments undertake to deal with 
complex and time-consuming cases which are extremely diverse in 
nature. Nowadays these are basically cases involving drug 
trafficking, embezzlement within the country's banking system, 
thefts of nonferrous metals from enterprises and their 
subsequent shipment out of Russia, corruption of officials, 
including militia officials, and counterfeiters. 
  I would subdivide cases according to their importance rather 
than the interest they present. Here is an example. Our 
investigators together with operatives from the Ministry of 
Internal Affairs and the former Ministry of Security (now the 
Federal Counterintelligence Service) have been able to uncover 
an organized and very security-conscious network of synthetic 
drugs traffickers. Some of these drugs are extremely potent. 
We have halted the operation of several laboratories for 
producing these drugs in Moscow, Kazan, Ufa, and Kurgan. We 
have blocked several channels through which narcotics from 
Commonwealth countries have been entering Russia. 
  Criminal proceedings have already been instituted against 
more than 60 accused persons. Between 1990 and 1992 just one 
group of these drug dealers prepared and sold approximately 
1,760 liters of potent narcotics worth more than 3 billion 
rubles [R] in black market prices. This case also witnessed a 
seizure of the dreadful drug trimethylphentanyl in powder 
form--enough to manufacture 288.5 liters of solution suitable 
for injection. Some 40,000 ampules of the imported drug 
buprenorphine were also confiscated. Over 100 kg of plant-based 
narcotics were taken. 
  Large sums of illegally earned money in rubles and foreign 
currency were also confiscated. Several kilograms of gold and 
silver were found. The total weight turned out to be 20 kg. 
There were a number of antiques among these valuable goods. 
  In order to steal big sums these days you do not need to 
blow 
open a safe. All you need is a good banking connection.... 
  In the cases we have been investigating, we have already 
uncovered instances of embezzlement in the banking sphere worth 
more than R70 billion. And attempted embezzlement of R35 
billion. 
  Over 200 banking institutions and 2,000 commercial 
structures 
have had a hand in these shady dealings. Our investigators and 
operatives were able to prevent the misappropriation of another 
R20 billion. More than 50 people have been brought to book. 
They have been stripped of money and valuables worth billions, 
and approximately $3 million have been returned to Russia from 
foreign bank accounts. 
  Kozlova: How many cases have you wound up as a 
result of the recent amnesty? 
  Titarov: I cannot comment on the political part of 
the decree since it has no relevance to our work. But the 
economic part does concern us. We are preparing to wind up 
approximately a dozen criminal cases. 
  The law is the law, and we will implement it, but our 
attitude to it is ambiguous. From the viewpoint of juridical 
technicalities, the economic part of the decree has not been 
thought through at all. A number of provisions simply need to 
be explained. Therefore the General Prosecutor's Office and the 
Ministry of Internal Affairs have approached the State Duma and 
asked it to provide explanations, which will enable us to apply 
the decree. 
  As far as my personal attitude is concerned, I cannot 
understand why people who have embezzled state and public 
property, abused their official positions, misappropriated 
funds, and engaged in fraudulent practices should be covered by 
the amnesty. The amnesty does not apply to people who have 
stolen far smaller sums of money from their fellow citizens. 
Does the former group therefore pose less of a threat to 
society?

<F P=106> [Interview with Security Minister Igor Giorgadze by Davit </F>
Gvelesiani; place and date not given: ``Give Me a Foothold 
and....''--introduction and all questions published in boldface] 
  [Excerpts] Life today is so bad for the republic's 
population that nobody remembers if life has ever been good. 
They ``console themselves'' with the thought that the refugees 
and those people made homeless are in a worse position than 
themselves. A person could overcome the economic difficulties 
if it were not for the pillage and robbery, murders, terrorist 
acts, and so forth. One gets the impression that apparently 
nobody is any longer capable of establishing the peace and order 
that people long for. However, the republic's Security Minister 
Igor Giorgadze does not share this pessimistic view. 
  Gvelesiani: Batono [Georgian polite form of 
address] minister, you were in western Georgia for almost 
one month. What was the purpose of such a long trip? 
  Giorgadze: In accordance with instructions from 
the head of state, I was entrusted with forming a brigade and 
going to western Georgia in order to familiarize myself with 
current processes there and implement effective measures aimed 
at discharging the extremely serious crime situation. 
  From 20 February until 14 March, we were in Poti together 
with the operational brigade, which was carrying out extremely 
complex and labor-intensive work. Accompanying me were special 
units from the Ministry of Security that were conducting 
operations aimed at exposing and seeking reconciliation with 
armed groups. These were not punitive operations. We held 
talks with leaders of armed groups that fought on the side of 
the ex-president and that, until now, have been hiding in the 
forests. It is superfluous to speak about a general 
reconciliation since all those who have been robbing and 
intimidating the peaceful population have committed criminal 
offenses and therefore have to be brought to account before the 
law. The fact that there no longer exists the fear of the 
revival of ``Zviadism'' in its armed form can be viewed as the 
biggest achievement. We can confidently say today that the fear 
of a new civil war in western Georgia has been eliminated. I 
believe this is due to the work of employees of the Ministry of 
Security and others. 
  For 24 days we held talks with three armed groups. It is 
true that we were unable to achieve reconciliation with all of 
the 160 persons united in these groups. However, the talks are 
continuing and they require prudence, patience, and time. 
Certain members of the law enforcement bodies have themselves 
complicated our work; it has turned out that they have been 
demanding fairly large sums for ``reconciliation'' from those 
people who have been coming out of the forests with their 
submachine guns. In addition to weapons that have been 
surrendered voluntarily, we have managed to confiscate a large 
quantity of firearms. We have retrieved stolen trucks and 
equipment. However, this is the material side of the trip, 
which I consider to be less important. The main thing is that 
people have declared their trust in our department, and this has 
the greatest social and political importance. [passage omitted] 
  Gvelesiani: Batono Igor, the violations in the 
banking and credit and financial system, the misappropriation of 
humanitarian aid, and the removal of raw materials of strategic 
importance from the state leads us to believe that a powerful 
mafia is operating in Georgia. 
  Giorgadze: For almost two years now, there has 
been talk about violations in the credit and financial system; 
several commissions have been formed and are working; suspects 
have been arrested but, as can be seen, the major criminals have 
remained free, as not a single serious violation in the banking 
sphere has been cleared up. 
  On instructions from the head of state, our ministry became 
interested in this matter. On the basis of investigative 
materials, we arrested the vice-president of the National Bank. 
Given the reaction that this fact has caused among a number of 
senior officials, it can be supposed that we are dealing with 
serious violations whose successful investigation will expose 
all those who sacrificed the country's interests for their own 
gain. 
  The Ministry of Security has been entrusted with forming an 
independent economic service that will be able to control and 
examine violations in the economic and credit systems. However, 
at the moment, we do not have sufficient funds for this. It is 
certain that existing mafia groups have found support both in 
state bodies of administration and in executive power. 
Therefore, the struggle against them and their exposure will 
take a long time. This is a serious problem and the Ministry of 
Security alone will not be able to cope with it. 
  Gvelesiani: Does the fear exist that Georgia will 
become a transit country for drugs? 
  Giorgadze: Unfortunately, this process is already 
under way and the international narcotics business, which trades 
in illegal arms and narcotic substances, is interested in our 
territory. The point is that, whereas before, the narcotics 
route from Asia to Europe bypassed the USSR, it now runs as 
follows: eastern Asia--Pakistan--Afghanistan--Central 
Asia--Azerbaijan--Georgia. Therefore, Georgia unhesitatingly 
took part in the international conference held in Istanbul on 
the initiative of the Black Sea countries and devoted to the 
problems of the struggle against the narcotics business and 
terrorism. Work in this direction is intensively under way. My 
deputy and a special group are currently in Bucharest, where a 
meeting of special services is continuing at which the latest 
means and methods in the struggle against the drugs mafia are 
being perfected. Incidentally, a sizable amount of drugs has 
already been smuggled via Georgia to Europe. The absence of 
borders and strict customs controls and appropriate legislation 
are complicating our work very much. 
  Gvelesiani: The view is being spread here and 
supported by high-ranking officials in the power structures that 
Georgia is unable to restore order by itself and, therefore, is 
calling on an external force for help. 
  Giorgadze: I do not share such a view. Georgia 
can certainly establish order in its own land. This is borne 
out by the recent intensification of the struggle against the 
criminal world and the subsequent positive results that have 
been achieved. 
  The Ministry of Security just like its predecessor--the 
Intelligence and Information Bureau, was not tasked with acting 
upon information received. One got the impression that we could 
only obtain information while some ``distant uncle'' would 
establish order for us. Now, the situation is different. Those 
special divisions that make up the power structures of the 
Ministry of Security are well trained and well disciplined and 
composed of young men trained to carry out special operations; I 
believe it is possible to train similar groups in the Ministry 
of Internal Affairs as well. In my view, the power structures 
currently existing in the Ministry of Security should also exist 
in the future in Georgian military formations in the form of 
special subunits. The correct selection of professional cadres 
will enable us to form and train such special subunits in all 
the power ministries that will be able to restore order in the 
country in the shortest period of time. We need more than just 
the desire to do this. We need to create the appropriate 
legislation, material and technical base, and means for this. 
Then, we will no longer be reliant on external help but will be 
able to act entirely on our own. [passage omitted]

Nuisance?''] 
  [Text] As reported by the Press Service of Ukraine's State 
Committee for Issues of Protection of Ukraine's State Border, 
the number of attempts to cross our borders illegally is 
increasing. Last month, border guards detained 1,112 
trespassers, among whom citizens of Afghanistan, Turkey (Kurds), 
Vietnam, Syria, and some Balkan countries constituted 78 percent. 
  The authorities confiscated from the border violators, in 
particular, smugglers, 2.5 tonnes of technological mercury, more 
than three tonnes of nonferrous metals, over 30 units of various 
types of weapons, 340.3 kilograms of narcotic raw materials, and 
so on. 
  The State Committee for Borders points out that, with the 
strengthening of border and customs control, the activity of 
those criminal groups that struggle for influence on the 
railroad transport system and that accompany the contraband 
goods by road has intensified.

  [Text] Clive Alphonso Alleyne was helping his friend, now 
deceased, to dry out a recently-arrived shipment in his backyard 
at Godding's Road when the police swooped. 
  The two men were actually spreading the green stuff out to 
dry, when the police interrupted the operations, and both of 
them ran off. 
  But Alleyne, 31, was later apprehended and confessed that he 
had helped lift bags, containing over 100 pounds of marijuana, 
from a car. 
<H5>  Pleaded Guilty </H5>
  Yesterday, with Sergeant John Hinkson prosecuting, in 
District "A" Criminal Court "B", the young vendor pleaded guilty 
and Magistrate Carlisle Greaves ordered him to pay $3,000 in 
three months, or spend 18 months in prison. 
  According to Alleyne, the stuff had "just come into the 
island," and he was helping a friend to sort it out.

  [Excerpt] Former Social Defense Under Secretary Gonzalo 
Torrico, Colonel Enrique Fernandez [former commander of the 
Special Antinarcotics Force, FELCN, in La Paz], and General Luis 
Anez [former FELCN commander] testified today before the 
Constitutional Committee of the Chamber of Deputies. We have a 
report from Amalia Pando on the testimony of Gonzalo Torrico. 
[begin recording] 
  Torrico, in progress: ...as far as I can remember 
about Isaac Chavarria, I did not get any information. I don't 
exactly remember how many prosecutors I had. 
  Pando: Gonzalo Torrico, who headed the struggle 
against drug trafficking during the four years of [former 
President] Jaime Paz Zamora's administration, has showed his 
memory is not as good as that of former dictator Luis Garcia 
Meza. Torrico, who was an ADN [National Democratic Action] 
senator in 1988 when another ADN senator published the 
narcophoto showing Paz Zamora with alleged drug trafficker Isaac 
Chavarria. He said he never told President Paz Zamora or 
Interior Minister Guillermo Capobianco that Isaac Chavarria, who 
was shown in the picture with Paz Zamora, was the most wanted 
drug trafficker in Bolivia at that time. 
  Torrico: Mr. President, I have clearly stated that 
the reception of the drug reports was not an exclusive privilege 
of the Social Defense Under Secretariat or the Interior 
Ministry: The reports went to both organizations. My 
relationship with the president was via the interior minister. 
When I met with the minister we did not talk about specific 
issues, we talked about overall policies. 
  Deputy Juan del Granado: Did you not consider it 
necessary to tell the interior minister about this case in 
particular? Did you ever think of doing that? This is what I 
want to know. 
  Torrico: No, because that kind of relationship did 
not exist. 
  del Granado: Thank you. 
  Pando: Between 1989 and 1991 Chavarria rose in the 
ranking of the most wanted drug traffickers. He first appeared 
on a list of the 28 most wanted traffickers, which was the first 
list Gonzalo Torrico saw. Some months later Chavarria rose to 
ninth place. 
  Unidentified deputy: Then a list of the nine most 
wanted drug traffickers was publicly released. Not only was the 
list released, it is explained how it was established. The 
report says: As a result of thorough intelligence analysis and a 
comparison study of the people suspected by the FELCN, the 
Social Defense Under Secretariat -- which was your organization 
Mr. Torrico -- and the DEA, a list of nine drug traffickers 
considered the national kingpins was compiled. This list shows 
Isaac Chavarria in first place. 
  Pando: In November 1991, the list was reduced to 
just the three most wanted drug traffickers. The deadline for 
repented drug traffickers to surrender had passed and the FELCN 
commander in Santa Cruz said that just three kingpins did not 
take advantage of the repentance law. The most important of the 
three was Isaac Chavarria. Despite all this evidence, Gonzalo 
Torrico never concerned himself with Chavarria's arrest. 
  Torrico: I remember, let me reiterate, I remember 
Chavarria's name just as a remember the name Techo de Paja from 
the reports. But when I saw a list, I had no interest in any 
particular name because that was not my job. I already clearly 
pointed out that there was a specialized organization to do that. 
  Pando: It was also established that in 1990 an 
ex-member of the FELCN, Retamozo, was murdered after formally 
accusing Isaac Chavarria. 
  Unidentified deputy: The prosecutor was the 
official who interrogated Eduardo Adolfo Retamozo Rosas on 26 
September 1990. Retamozo, a former FELCN official, was then 
released, then he was arrested, and then murdered. The case of 
Eduardo Adolfo Retamozo was well known. The interrogation was 
handled by a prosecutor who worked for you, or who was assigned 
to the Social Defense Under Secretariat. Did this prosecutor -- 
who worked for you -- not inform you in detail, at least after 
Retamozo was shot dead, about his testimony. 
  Torrico: Mr. President, prosecutors were not 
obliged to report to me directly or through their coordinators 
of these events. 
  Pando: According to Torrico, he knew Isaac 
Chavarria was a wanted drug trafficker. He did not order his 
arrest because that is the task of the FELCN intelligence. He 
did not warn the president because it was not his duty and 
because the reports from the FELCN with the list of the most 
wanted drug traffickers were also sent to Minister Capobianco. 
Let us recall that, before this committee, Capobianco has 
denied being informed about links between Chavarria and drug 
trafficking. In the last part of his testimony, Torrico 
clarified that he did not work for the DEA or receive money from 
the U.S. Embassy. He also reiterated that no one ever asked him 
to protect Chavarria, neither Jaime Paz Zamora or Guillermo 
Capobianco. [end recording] [passage omitted]

  [Text] La Paz -- The Bolivian Armed Forces commander, 
General Fernando Sanjines Yanez, energetically condemned reports 
on the virtual "submission" of the Bolivian institutional system 
to the DEA and the violation, according to several reports, of 
national sovereignty. 
  Shortly after the end of a ceremony to celebrate the Army 
Engineering Command's 33d anniversary, Gen. Sanjines Yanez 
categorically stated: "It is our duty to see that the Bolivian 
institutions or foreign organizations established in our country 
respect our Constitution and demand that they all, with no 
exceptions, respect the country's physical integrity and 
national sovereignty." 
  Sanjines added: "The Armed Forces will never tolerate the 
violation of our country's integrity or sovereignty; this cannot 
be and less still will the Armed Forces allow it." 
  The Armed Forces' commander made this statement shortly 
after 
the DEA created a big scandal in Bolivia and Costa Rica due to 
its anti-drug operation procedures involving Edgar Fernandez 
Lazcano, right-hand man of alleged drug trafficker Isaac 
Chavarria, aka Oso, who is regarded as the key witness to 
clarify charges that the Movement of the Revolutionary Left has 
"links to drug traffickers." 
  So far, Government Ministry authorities have not come up 
with 
an explanation on the flight or abduction of Fernandez, in which 
the DEA appears directly involved together with Bolivian 
security forces and, particularly, the Special Antinarcotics 
Force [FELCN]. 
  Government Minister German Quiroga and Foreign Minister 
Antonio Aranibar Quiroga both asserted that the DEA did not 
abduct Fernandez, that he "escaped" on his own. Information 
from abroad, especially Costa Rica, however, state the opposite. 
That is, that Fernandez arrived in and left Costa Rica 
accompanied by DEA agents. 
  This complex situation prompted opposition legislators in 
the 
last few hours to summon the government minister to Congress to 
give an official and detailed report on the developments in 
order to definitely determine the DEA's participation in the 
investigations into "narcolinks" that, without much evidence, 
FELCN reported involved top-ranking MIR leaders. 
  In the meantime, several institutions, such as the Armed 
Forces and others, condemned the charges of DEA intervention and 
demanded that President Gonzalo Sanchez de Lozada call for 
"greater respect for Bolivian dignity" in view of "U.S. 
interventionism."

<F P=106> [Interview with unidentified high-ranking Bolivian Army </F>
officer by FIDES NEWS AGENCY, ANF; place and date not given, 
first part is introduction] 
  [Text] Military chiefs of the different forces have 
recommended that the Bolivian Government should "gradually 
eliminate the use of foreign advisers in antinarcotics 
enforcement" and thus "guarantee national security and 
sovereignty." 
  "Experts from other countries -- not necessarily from the 
United States -- may come here. There is no problem as long as 
they abide by national laws and are appropriately authorized. 
But it would be good if they could be gradually eliminated in 
the short term," said a source close to the Military High 
Command. The officer explained, however, that their idea is not 
the institutional position. 
  A high-ranking Army officer close to the Military High 
Command agreed to be interviewed by ANF on condition he was not 
identified because of "specific regulations, disciplinary 
practices, and precepts of the Armed Forces organic law." 
  ANF: Are the Bolivian Armed Forces fully capable 
of controlling the actions of foreign groups like the DEA in 
Bolivia? 
  Officer: The Armed Forces are present all over the 
country but we are unable to fully cover the entire territory. 
Military organizations can temporarily come to Bolivia as long 
as they are under the supervision of the Bolivian Armed Forces. 
  We (the military) are preserving Bolivian national 
sovereignty and security in compliance with our constitutional 
role. It would worry us if elements (foreign military) were 
allowed to move freely (throughout Bolivia). 
  ANF: Are the foreign armed elements operating in 
the country subordinated to the Bolivian Armed Forces? 
  Officer: We want them to abide by national laws, 
we do not want their subordination. 
  ANF: How would you label relations between the 
Armed Forces and the U.S. military mission? 
  Officer: Military relations between U.S. and 
Bolivian forces are absolutely normal. 
  ANF: Why are U.S. military advisers -- rather than 
those from other countries -- always involved in antinarcotics 
enforcement, humanitarian aid, and civic action? 
  Officer: We must get all countries involved in the 
struggle against trafficking and thus get them to do their 
share. The best course of action would be if we used our own 
means and capabilities in a national and decisive action against 
trafficking with foreign technical advice in some cases, and 
with the provision of means we do not have in other cases. 
  ANF: Do you believe national sovereignty is likely 
to be violated by foreign interests? 
  Officer: The presence of U.S. troops in particular 
is no threat to national sovereignty because the Armed Forces 
follow-up on the actions of U.S. personnel that enter the 
country to ensure they behave legally and return to their 
country within the time established by Congress in some cases 
and by the executive branch in others. DEA agents are here on 
rotational assignments. 
  ANF: The arrival of U.S. military personnel has 
increased since last year. Has anything abnormal been detected? 
  Officer: All foreign personnel arriving here do so 
legally based on bilateral and multilateral agreements. They 
cannot just parachute in. Everything is under control, if there 
were anything abnormal, the Armed Forces would detect it and 
report it to a higher level. 
  ANF: When armed foreign personnel arrive under a 
binational agreement, to whom do they report during their stay? 
  Officer: They obey the agreement. They are not 
under the orders of the Armed Forces but we supervise and have 
liaison officers in the areas where they work.

  [Text] The DEA "will have problems" with the Chamber of 
Deputies Constitution Committee if it is established that it 
exceeded it diplomatic duties and its role in the investigations 
into the alleged link between the MIR [Movement of the 
Revolutionary Left] and drug trafficking. 
  This was stated by an MBL [Free Bolivia Movement] deputy and 
member of the Constitution Committee, Juan del Granado, who said 
there are rules between Bolivia and the United States regarding 
the DEA's duties in Bolivia. 
  According to bilateral agreements between the U.S. Embassy 
and the Bolivian Foreign Ministry, DEA agents are banned from 
carrying weapons, participating in antinarcotic operations, and 
arresting and interrogating individuals on Bolivian territory. 
  Investigations into the alleged links of some MIR leaders to 
drug trafficking reveal that some DEA agents exceeded their 
duties by institutionally conducting the investigations and 
influencing the report on FELCN [Special Antinarcotics Force]'s 
conclusions. 
  Del Granado stated that there is strong evidence the DEA was 
directly involved in the subject by carrying out duties and 
roles not mentioned in the bilateral agreements between the two 
countries. 
  He added that an attempt will be made to establish the 
obvious deceitful, abusive, and prepotent behavior of DEA agents 
in our country.

  [Text] Cochabamba -- Vice President Victor Hugo Cardenas 
assured FIDES NEW AGENCY that the struggle against drug 
trafficking will be more aggressive than in past governments; 
therefore, the United States and other international 
organizations must step up their cooperation for alternative 
development. 
  Regretting the fact that the reduction of coca leaf 
plantations did not take place at the pace established in 
bilateral agreements with the United States, which undoubtedly 
prompted some comments on the reduction of international 
cooperation, Cardenas said the reduction process was slow not 
because the new government did not have the will but rather due 
to the electoral process that had its natural impact on state 
activities. 
  He added that the structural changes proposed by the 
government have hindered the fulfillment of those contracts, 
"but the executive branch's determination to fight drug 
trafficking is greater than that of past governments." 
  He said the Bolivian and U.S. Governments must negotiate 
with 
that criteria to establish the goals of the new anti-drug 
cooperation agreements and for alternative development. 
  Regarding U.S. cooperation in these fields, he said that no 
cooperation will be enough to solve the drug trafficking problem 
the country is enduring. 
  Cardenas said it is necessary that instead of reducing 
cooperation in the reduction of coca plantations, the efforts 
for alternative development must be increased. "The people get 
involved in coca production or drug trafficking not out of habit 
but due to the poverty affecting large sectors of the nation." 
  He added that although international cooperation is 
important 
for alternative development, the existence of foreign markets 
for Bolivian products is no less important. 
  He added that if Bolivia finds markets it also will find 
important partners abroad that will make coca production 
unnecessary to sustain a more stable economy. 
  Regarding the controversy surrounding the subject of 
reducing 
coca plantations, which in the opinion of the industry's 
authorities increase in a sustained manner, Cardenas said that 
only those plantations classified as legal by Law No. 1008 
should be maintained, "but that surplus plantations must be 
reduced through agreements between coca growers and the 
government in a voluntary rather than a compulsory manner."

  [Text] La Paz -- Sources linked to the national Defense 
Ministry and the military high command on 14 April announced 
that "a national strategy document" for the defense of national 
"sovereignty and security" will be delivered next week to the 
president of the Republic and captain general of the Armed 
Forces, Gonzalez Sanchez de Lozada, for its "immediate 
implementation" in the attempt to safeguard the Bolivian state's 
physical integrity. 
  The sources explained that for this purpose a meeting of the 
Defense Ministry, the National Security Supreme Council [Consejo 
Supreme de Seguridad Nacional, COSDENA], and the Armed Forces 
command was called during the past few hours. The meeting's 
purpose is to start drafting the document that will be submitted 
to the chief of state. 
  The sources commented: We are going to adopt a definite 
stance -- in our capacity as the government -- regarding reports 
that revealed the "internal and external weakness" shown by the 
country in view of the "interference and imposition" of the 
foreign forces acting in the national territory. 
  They also said: "Our rule will be to propose basic 
guidelines for its defense." 
  This information was disclosed a few hours after former 
President Jaime Paz Zamora accused the United States of 
interfering in domestic affairs through the financial 
cooperation it offers for the fight against drug trafficking. 
  To prove the pressure exerted by the United States in "many 
fields" of cooperation it grants Bolivia, Paz Zamora said: "I 
took our flag and went out to defend national dignity." 
  The proposals the national organizations directly charged 
with security will make will include precise suggestions on 
subjects related to the presence of foreign troops in Bolivia, 
the existence of technical cooperation commissions for the 
struggle against drug trafficking, and the Armed Forces' actions 
to guarantee external and internal security. 
  The sources pointed out that "the president of the Republic, 
Gonzalo Sanchez de Lozada, now has to call COSDENA to assess, as 
a whole, the discoveries disclosed these past weeks as a result 
of the investigations into the government authorities' links to 
drug trafficking." 
  In the meantime, National Defense Ministry sources today 
asserted that the drug trafficking scourge during the past 10 
years has become a "destabilizing factor" for the Bolivian 
state's institutional system. 
  They also pointed out that the illegal business of drug 
trafficking had infiltrated "the state's most sensitive security 
structure" and, consequently, there is a risk -- if this scourge 
is not eradicated -- of "irreversibly enslaving" the Bolivian 
state with consequences that, so far, "have not been truly 
determined." 
  They also said they would make proposals designed to review 
agreements Bolivia has signed with the United States that 
"endorse a constant presence of foreign troops" in the national 
territory because -- they said -- it violates Bolivian 
sovereignty and the country's laws. 
  They pointed out that the national government will have to 
do 
something similar about the "technical cooperation commissions" 
such as the DEA that act "with complete freedom and autonomy" in 
Bolivia. 
  The sources added: "We must establish an explicit difference 
between the functions of the U.S. missions that give 
humanitarian aid to given regions of the country and the U.S. 
logistical support in the war against drug trafficking. Rules 
for this sort of aid must be established."

<F P=106> [Minister of Government German Quiroga interviewed by Carlos </F>
Mesa in the "Up Close" television program in Associated 
Journalists Television, PAT, studios in La Paz -- live] 
  [Excerpts] Mesa: Good evening. Bolivia is 
currently experiencing difficult times. It has to prove the 
strength of its democratic system and show its ability to 
resolve a problem which until very recently no one would have 
suspected would ever happen: unproven charges that a political 
party, and even a former president, maintained close ties with 
drug traffickers and drug trafficking. 
  This has led to other secondary issues: Bolivian ties with 
the United States, our degree of dependency, and our limited 
independence. 
  We will be discussing this and other issues with German 
Quiroga, minister of government of President Sanchez de Lozada's 
administration. Mr. Quiroga is here with us to discuss, as 
already announced, if Bolivia has a strong degree of dependency, 
if Bolivia is as submissive as it seems in its bilateral ties, 
and how are we to combat drug trafficking in Bolivia. 
  Good evening sir, and thank you for accepting our 
invitation. 
  Quiroga: Good evening, and thank you, Carlos. I 
believe it is important to discuss the trafficking issue, which 
is an increasingly growing phenomenon. 
  Trafficking is probably the largest multinational company 
that has ever existed in the history of humanity. Its networks 
have spread worldwide. It has huge fleets of planes and 
sophisticated communications systems. They are excellent and 
powerful financial experts. 
  Unfortunately, because of difficult conditions, Bolivia has 
become the second largest producer of cocaine in the world. 
This has compelled us to think beyond our daily limitations, 
beyond political parties, beyond government administrations that 
change every four years, and even beyond our borders. The 
trafficking issue compels all Bolivians, men and women, to make 
a joint effort to halt this harmful problem. 
  Once we agree on the elemental principle of what trafficking 
consists of and its huge dimension, we have to revise many of 
the issues linked to the antidrug struggle. 
  Mesa: Allow me to ask you an odd question. In 
practice, is Bolivia a truly independent and sovereign country? 
  Quiroga: Yes, absolutely. It is an independent 
and sovereign country, at least in spirit. If we view the issue 
of dependency, it is closely tied to economic problems, to 
resources. From this point of view, Bolivia is a strongly 
interrelated country. Above a true political willingness to 
define specific issues -- specifically referring to resources -- 
there are certain prerequisites which do not allow us to put 
them in practice. Today we live in an incredibly interrelated 
world. As you might recall, there was a serious scandal a 
couple of years ago in the United States because some Japanese 
businessmen bought almost a fourth of Manhattan. One of the 
most prominent buildings in Manhattan, the Rockefeller Center, 
was purchased by the Japanese. Americans took to the streets 
with their placards to stage their characteristic protest 
demonstrations and say what was wrong with the officials who 
allowed the Japanese in. 
  I mention this just to show that all countries are strongly 
interrelated. Bolivia is an independent country because it is 
capable of making its own decisions. 
  Mesa: But you surely agree that we should not 
compare Japanese-U.S. ties with Bolivian-U.S. ties. 
  Quiroga: Definitely. 
  Mesa: President Gonzalo Sanchez de Lozada views 
the situation differently. In his 9 April speech he said 
Bolivia is very dependent, although his words were softened when 
the text of his speech was published. 
  Quiroga: But it is not a permanent dependency, am 
I right? Despite the interrelation I mentioned previously, 
Bolivia is a very independent country because it enjoys the 
absolute freedom to elect its officials and to enforce its own 
rules and regulations. So, in spite of what you have said and 
the great interdependency among countries, Bolivia enjoys an 
acceptable level of sovereignty. 
  Mesa: You have just mentioned a key issue 
regarding dependency. You have just said that we are absolutely 
free to choose our national officials. 
  Let us view the issue in context. It is obvious that the 
U.S. Government -- to which we refer -- does not care who is 
appointed social communications minister, or customs director, 
or director of the regional sports institute. But obviously it 
is interested in who is appointed to the cabinet post that is 
directly involved in fighting drug trafficking. 
  This is the first issue: the difficulty of appointing 
officials directly involved in the fight against drugs. 
  Moreover, there is specific evidence that the U.S. 
ambassador 
has exerted direct pressure on one president, Gonzalo Sanchez de 
Lozada [as heard]. With or without justification, U.S. 
Ambassador Robert Gelbard specifically forced [former President 
Jaime] Paz Zamora to request the resignation of [FELCN, Special 
Antinarcotics Force, chief] Faustino Rico Toro, General Carvajal 
[not further identified], and Interior Minister Guillermo 
Capobianco. 
  Paz Zamora said in an interview that if the U.S. ambassador 
disagreed with the appointment of some officials -- who, we 
could add, were involved in the fight against drugs -- the 
ambassador just had to accept them. 
  Would you say the U.S. Embassy is today completely 
indifferent in this regard, are you saying it accepts and does 
not question these appointments with the minister of government, 
or is it that the minister of government and other government 
officials do not discuss with the ambassador the appointments of 
the FELCN chief or other key police officials involved in the 
antidrug fight? 
  Quiroga: I believe these are completely separate 
issues. The sovereignty issue, the freedom of governments and 
officials to appoint their government team, is based on 
confidence. 
  The fact that Bolivia lost this confidence -- for whatever 
reason -- the process of allowing officials to lead the antidrug 
struggle with the absolute certainty that it was being properly 
handled resulted in different levels of intervention which do 
not exist at this time. 
  Today we are facing a credibility problem in Bolivia. This 
is not just the result of what in the last few days has been 
described as narcopolitics, it is the result of many things 
which have even caused international organizations to lose 
confidence in Bolivian authorities. One thing leads to another, 
it grows and grows until it is up to the United States to decide 
whether the interior minister stays or goes. 
  Under normal conditions, under conditions of mutual 
confidence -- because I am aware that President Clinton is 
absolutely certain Sanchez de Lozada will not permit these kinds 
of defects -- I reassert that we enjoy complete freedom to 
choose our officials. 
  Probably if we make a first mistake, if we nominate an 
official who had ties with drug trafficking, or if we overlook 
some ties with drug trafficking, this confidence will be lost 
and we will return to this vicious circle. But this is not the 
case now. 
  Mesa: You mentioned some incidents that caused 
U.S. Government officials and international organizations to 
mistrust Bolivian officials. Would you say this has just 
changed following Gonzalo Sanchez de Lozada's election? Would 
you say the Americans fully trust him, was this an automatic 
process... 
  Quiroga interrupting: No, not at all. This 
entails a process. The situation did not change abruptly 
overnight. Things do not work like that. This entails a 
process. It is a slow and joint effort, based on honesty, which 
has restored confidence in Bolivia. 
  This lack of confidence probably halted what I choose to 
call 
the nationalization of the drug struggle. Had Bolivia, as a 
nation and under the previous administration, not experienced 
profound faults in its handling of drug trafficking and not been 
associated with drug trafficking, today Bolivia would probably 
be playing a more important role in the drug struggle. Although 
this was not the case in our bilateral ties with the United 
States or in our multilateral ties with international 
organizations, we are reacquiring this confidence. Thanks to 
the work of a team of men and women at the national level, not 
just at the Ministry of Government, we have been able to restore 
this confidence. 
  Mesa: Theoretically speaking, what would happen if 
the government, for any reason, decided to replace the current 
FELCN chief and appoint someone else. Would you say the 
government would appoint this new authority without consulting 
-- without discussing it, if you will -- with the U.S. Embassy? 
  Quiroga: I would consult the FELCN and the 
intelligence organizations and ask them to give me a report on 
the background of the person to be appointed to that post. 
  Mesa: Not the U.S. Embassy? 
  Quiroga: No, not the embassy because there is an 
information system. Perhaps it would be interesting at this 
time to define the FELCN and how it operates... 
  Mesa interrupting: ...yes, allow me to... 
  Quiroga interrupting: ...to explain... 
  Mesa interrupting: ... yes of course... 
  Quiroga interrupting: ...then, yes... 
  Mesa interrupting: Allow me to pose a few more 
introductory questions so that we may later discuss this issue 
which is of course very important. 
  Another important question is whether the Ministry of 
Government, which you head, has any U.S. Embassy officials 
working inside it? 
  Quiroga: No, no. 
  Mesa: Did any U.S. Embassy officials work there in 
the past? 
  Quiroga: I do not know. But there are none at 
this time. 
  Mesa: Are there any policemen, or high-ranking 
personnel in charge of coordinating any tasks with the United 
States -- a liaison officer? Someone like "Our Man in Havana," 
as the novel goes...? 
  Quiroga interrupting: ...Well, there are 
coordinating activities. There are joint undertakings but at 
this time no one can say there is a U.S. Embassy official within 
the structure of the Ministry of Government. Absolutely not. 
  Mesa: You told me you would like people to know 
about the FELCN. First I would like you to explain, how is the 
Ministry of Government organized? What does it do? What does it 
encompass? What are the responsibilities of the ministry under 
you charge? 
  Quiroga: Well, the Ministry of Government is 
divided in two sections: The domestic control system, under the 
police force. This is headed by the Domestic Order and Police 
National Secretariat. The other section is the Social Defense 
Secretariat which deals with coca, cocaine, and drug prevention. 
These are the two main ministry branches from the operational 
viewpoint. 
  Mesa: It is important to explain that the justice 
system is no longer under the jurisdiction of the Ministry of 
Government. This is very important because based on the new 
organization of the justice system, the Ministry of Government 
has ceased to be in charge of the prosecutors office, etc., is 
this true? 
  Quiroga: Yes, that is correct. [passage omitted] 
  Mesa: You have mentioned that many people believe 
the DEA is involved in FELCN operations. What is more, 
Bolivians believe the DEA is really in charge of conducting 
intelligence work and even indirect antidrug operations. Some 
even say the Americans arrested Faustino Rico Toro, but this is 
not the issue in question. 
  The BBC has produced a documentary, which we have already 
aired on PAT and on which journalist Amalia Pando did some 
research. This documentary showed DEA agents kicking down doors 
in Chapare. I believe this is not part of the DEA's work. 
  This is not our invention. It is documented in a film which 
shows the operations were planned in Washington in conjunction 
with the Southern Command, which is based in Panama, and that 
the FELCN chief was merely informed about the operation once it 
was complete. 
  This documentary also shows DEA officials directing 
operations aboard a flight to Santa Ana, giving instructions to 
the pilots, the Red Devils, and carrying guns. 
  This is not just theory. It is documented -- not by 
ill-intentioned Bolivians but by reputed and objective BBC 
journalists who are free of all suspicion. 
  There is evidence that the DEA is not limiting its 
activities 
just to advisory or intelligence work. 
  Quiroga: As I told you a few minutes ago, the DEA 
works in conjunction with two FELCN units, one of them being 
UMOPAR [Mobile Police Unit for Rural Areas]. 
  We are currently implementing a program to gradually 
decrease 
the number of DEA agents in the country. Those who are working 
are personnel contracted by the DEA. They are U.S. police 
agents, contracted by the DEA, who have had military training. 
The number of those advising and training our police personnel 
is gradually decreasing. For example, in 1992 there were 35 
Snow Cap agents. In 1993, there were 21. This administration 
has agreed with the U.S. Embassy that there will be 11 DEA 
agents in Bolivia. 
  Mesa: This means then that there are 11 DEA agents 
in Bolivia. 
  Quiroga: Eleven Snow Cap agents. We are speaking 
about UMOPAR and the DEA, not the entire set up because they 
comprise completely different and independent units. 
  There are 11 U.S. officers who were brought in by the DEA 
and 
who are directly working with Bolivian troops. 
  In 1991, the year the BBC report was aired -- Operation San 
Ramon took place in 1990 -- there were probably about 100 Snow 
Cap agents. This number has decreased. At the time Bolivia did 
not have trained personnel or the means to conduct antidrug 
operations. Let me remind you that at the time we were 
conducting antidrug operations using hired gunmen, highly 
trained killers -- that is what those Colombians were. 
  But this is not the case today. Not because Government 
Minister Quiroga has more leeway to make independent decisions 
than previous government ministers. Not at all. This is 
because of current prevailing conditions in UMOPAR and because 
of its increasing effectiveness. We now have just 11 U.S. 
citizens working closely with our troops. 
  Beyond the fact that we can make more sovereign decisions, 
Bolivian police officers are now in charge of conducting 
antidrug operations. They are the ones who conduct the raids 
and seize.... 
  Mesa, interrupting: How many DEA agents are there 
in Bolivia? 
  Quiroga: Right now there are 33. The number of 
DEA officials vary from 25 to 40 or 45. It depends on the 
season of the year. Sometimes the Bolivian Government requests 
the presence of an expert in a specific field. Sometimes they 
send us one or two. They train people in their field and then 
leave. At no time are there more than 40 or 45 DEA agents in 
the country. 
  Mesa: Is there a specific U.S.-Bolivian agreement 
defining the limitations, prerogatives, and restrictions on DEA 
agents? 
  Quiroga: There is no specific agreement 
establishing these terms. Our ties in this area are mainly based 
on three documents signed by the Bolivian and the U.S. 
Governments. 
  One is a general document -- the Vienna Convention -- which 
defines the prerogatives of representatives of foreign 
countries. [passage omitted]

<F P=106> [Telephone interview with Government Minister German Quiroga </F>
by radio director Father Eduardo Perez Iribarne in La Paz -- 
live] 
  [Excerpts] Perez: Good morning Minister German 
Quiroga. Would you like to clarify whether the telephones [of 
ex-President Jaime Paz Zamora] were tapped or not and about the 
Entel [National Telecommunications Enterprise] telephone bills. 
The entire country is listening. Go ahead. 
  Quiroga: Thank you; good evening Father. What I 
showed on national television last night was a request made by 
the narcotics prosecutor to Entel and Entel's answer on the 
telephone bills. What we have are the Entel bills, both of the 
telephones of [Isaac] Chavarria [drug trafficker] at his 
property in Las Maras, Santa Cruz Department, and his house in 
Irpavi. Therefore, there was no violation of any constitutional 
regulation. We had no access to any kind of conversation and 
this was clarified last night. All we did was to get the Entel 
bills on the calls made, and this was made through a request by 
the prosecutor. All the information including the telephone 
bills will be submitted today to the Controlled Substances Court 
and a legalized copy to the Constitutional and Chamber of 
Deputies Judicial Police Committee, where the investigation is 
being carried out. 
  Perez: I have a cable from the ERBOL [Bolivian 
radio Schools] news agency on your interview by reporter Carlos 
Mesa Guisbert last night on state television. Were the telephone 
calls made only from 1990 to 1991; were there any calls after 
1991 in 1992 or 1993? 
  Quiroga: The telephone calls were from 1989 to 
1993. There are also two telephone bills after the presidential 
term, in September 1993. 
  Perez: In other words, the telephone contacts 
between Isaac Chavarria and ex-President Jaime Paz Zamora were 
before, during, and after his presidential term. 
  Quiroga: What can really be proven through the 
prosecutor's request is that El Picacho's [Paz Zamora's house] 
telephone was called from Chavarria's telephone 10 times from 
1989 to 1993. 
  Perez: You clearly said there was communication 
between the two telephones and obviously due to Article 20 of 
the Constitution it is not possible to know who talked on the 
phones. 
  Quiroga: It cannot be established who talked from 
each end of the telephones. The only thing that can be 
established is that the two telephones were in contact. It also 
can be established through the telephone bills how long the 
calls were because the bills show the time and the amount. But 
it will be impossible to establish who spoke on the phone. 
[passage omitted] 
  Perez: As government minister you are the top 
political authority in the country and must enforce the 
Constitution on behalf of the president. Can you guarantee the 
entire country that in Bolivia no telephones are tapped by 
anyone and under no circumstances? 
  Quiroga: By anyone and under no circumstances from 
the ethical and legal point of view. And also from the technical 
point of view, we cannot do it because we do not have the 
equipment in the ministry to do it. I invite you and the media 
to visit the intelligence services to see that technically we 
cannot do it. But we would not do it either because of legal and 
ethical principles. [passage omitted]

<F P=106> [Editorial: "The Intolerable `Drug Enforcement </F>
Administration'"] 
  [Text] If there is -- as there is in reality -- an 
agreement between our government and the United States 
authorizing the presence and activities in Bolivia of an 
organization whose mission is the struggle against illegal 
drugs, the least that should be demanded from it is legality and 
transparency in its operations. The country has the right to 
know the name of the DEA director, where his office is, who and 
how many his immediate aides are, and, above all, demand that 
his investigative methods abide by the country's current 
juridical order. 
  But nothing like that happens. In the eyes of the Bolivian 
people, the DEA is a mysterious and clandestine organization. 
Not even the chief of its national counterpart -- the FELCN 
[Special Antinarcotics Force] -- gave the name of the individual 
responsible for that organization. It has been learned that the 
DEA uses methods of intimidation and control over telephone 
lines, and through them control over private conversations. It 
has "safe houses" where, according to reiterated denunciations, 
physical and psychological torture are used to get the testimony 
of those under arrest, and that it can arrest any citizen going 
over judicial formalities. 
  We know the DEA has the delicate mission of fighting drug 
trafficking, and because drug trafficking is a clandestine and 
illegal activity, its operations and personnel must be protected 
with some degree of confidentiality. The National Police and the 
FELCN also have that mission but their chiefs show their faces 
because their task is legal, and any action they commit is 
subject to the judgment of the people and the verdict of 
judicial officials. 
  The methods used by the DEA in its operations are very 
different. To start with, as more than one Bolivian jurist said, 
that foreign organization uses methods that, if legal in its 
country, are not in our country. Kidnapping, for example, which 
according to the U.S. Supreme Court is admissible in some cases, 
continues to be prohibited in our legislation and is considered 
a crime even if the excuse is to fight another crime. The same 
situation is valid for the presumption of innocence, which is 
the basic principle sustained in our entire juridical structure 
in contrast to the presumption of guilt used by that 
organization. 
  Another aspect that needs rectification is the one used by 
the DEA that consists of offering all types of rewards -- 
including reduction of sentence or acquittal -- if a witness 
offers testimony or evidence against another. Our juridical 
system rejects this method, and it is against our tradition and 
convictions. If this method is used in more developed countries 
than ours, it is their responsibility but we don't have to 
accept it. 
  What exists in essence is what the president of the Republic 
dramatically stated in his latest public speech, when he said 
our dependency is "terrible." And it is precisely that adjective 
that makes it intolerable because dependency in the broad sense 
exists in any country in the world, including the United States, 
which in some way "depends" commercially on Japan. But we cannot 
continue widening that gap; we should reduce it, and any effort 
in this regard deserves the support of all the people. 
  Therefore, it would be good for a branch like the 
legislative 
to thoroughly investigate the activities of that foreign agency, 
and to put it under strict legality with the possibility of 
annulling the agreement that authorized its presence in the 
country. If political organizations and the media provide full 
support, this will no longer be a utopian situation.

<F P=106> [Editorial: "United States Owes Explanations to Bolivia"] </F>
  [Text] The United States -- its embassy, and through it the 
DEA -- owe Bolivia an explanation for the events related to "the 
narco-accusation" being discussed by the FELCN [Special 
Antinarcotics Force] and Congress, even if this is simply for 
considerations of diplomatic practice or good manners, for lack 
of a more precise and appropriate definition. 
  It is already known with certainty that the DEA has been and 
continues to be a decisive factor in these actions. This much 
is known precisely because of the apologies presented by the 
U.S. Embassy to the Costa Rican Government, and through a DEA 
communique explaining the appearance and later disappearance, in 
Costa Rica, of Bolivian citizen Edgar Fernandez Lazcano. 
Nothing of the kind has occurred in La Paz, until today, 
despite the fact that our country was directly affected by those 
U.S. actions, which have hurt our national dignity. 
  The explanations offered here by the ministers of government 
and social communication regarding the Fernandez case are not 
convincing. We do not understand why our government does 
nothing effective to bring him back to the country, particularly 
as he is considered a key element in the Chamber of Deputies 
Justice Commission hearing, and given the fact that he himself 
has stated his willingness to testify before the commission 
following a previous detention by the FELCN. His extradition 
seems to be impossible due to a lack of charges against him. 
However, it should not be impossible for Bolivian authorities 
to ask the DEA -- which currently holds him detained, or 
protects him, and which is also suspected of helping him get out 
of the country, enter Costa Rica, and later leave it, presumably 
for Miami -- to bring him back to the country. 
  But independent of what the Bolivian Government does or does 
not, it is the U.S. Government which has the obligation, or at 
least the moral duty, to explain its participation in these 
affairs.

  [Text] A secret military document could be the key to new 
disclosures for the prosecutors investigating the corruption 
scheme set up by the numbers game kingpins. 
  The first probe into the numbers game-drug trafficking link 
was conducted in 1982 by the Military Police intelligence 
service itself. The Army and the now-defunct National 
Intelligence Service, SNI, received copies of the report. 
  It was in a meeting held then that the numbers game leaders 
decided to invest in drug trafficking because they considered it 
a promising business. The numbers game kingpins then allied 
themselves with drug trafficker Antonio Jose Nicolao, aka 
Toninho Turco, who started to serve as a liaison between the 
numbers game and the drug trade. 
  General Newton Cerqueira, who was commander of the Military 
Police [PM] at that time, confirmed the report's existence: 
  [Begin recording] PM officers, who at that time helped us 
considerably in that specialized sector, drafted documents and I 
became firmly convinced that there was a close connection 
between the numbers game bankers and the drug trade. [end 
recording] 
  The prosecutors want to compare the information contained in 
that report with both the documents seized from Toninho Turco's 
house during the Mosaic Operation and with the accounting books 
and diskettes seized recently from the numbers game operations 
center. They believe that by comparing all these documents, they 
will be able to prove for the first time the numbers game 
kingpins' involvement in the drug trade in Rio de Janeiro. 
  The prosecutors do not know, however, that that report -- 
which they describe as being highly significant -- has 
disappeared from the PM intelligence service's files.

<F P=106> [Article by Marcia Valeria: "Drug Addiction Begins in </F>
Adolescence"] 
  [Text] A nationwide survey conducted by the Brasmarket 
Institute regarding drug use in Brazil has revealed that 31 
percent of Brazilian drug addicts tried drugs for the first time 
when they were 15 or 16 years old and that 61.4 percent became 
addicted through marijuana. Cocaine ranks second in Brazilian 
preferences at 40.9 percent. The researchers interviewed 800 
individuals in different capitals and claim that these data 
reflect reality in Manaus. 
  The survey also reveals that 58.4 percent of those 
interviewed became acquainted with drugs through friends, and 
61.7 percent deny being dependent or addicted. Of the 800 people 
interviewed, all had tried some kind of drug once in their life, 
29.4 percent of them only for fun. 
  Another finding by the survey is that 94.1 percent of those 
interviewed have drug users in their circle of friends.

<H5>  Psychologist Cites Lack of Affection as Cause </H5>
  Psychologist Wilton Barros de Araujo of the State Institute 
for the Welfare of Minors (IEBEM), who works with "addicted" 
children in Manaus, claims that lack of affection is the main 
factor leading individuals to seek drugs. "Man needs food to 
survive, and affection feeds the spirit. If he does not find it 
in his family, he seeks escape through drugs," the psychologist 
explains. 
  Wilton Araujo says that an expression much used by drug 
addicts -- "ficar noiado" -- characterizes that lack of 
affection. "Ficar noiado" means "everything I want I get." What 
does that mean? When the addict is "noiado," he can, on his 
trips, mistreat the people who did not give him affection or 
imagine that he is being loved, among other things. He flees his 
actual reality and seeks the reality he wants." 
  The psychologist also observes that even the sensation of 
"coming down," which the individual feels when the drug wears 
off, is considered by many to be preferable to the reality of 
the world in which they live. 
  Wilton warns of the lack of competence among people working 
with addicts. He says that the few treatment centers in Amazonas 
and the rest of Brazil today employ people who are poorly paid 
and dissatisfied. "To salvage a drug addict, the institutions 
would have to create an atmosphere that he did not have at home 
and show the individual that the world is not as bad as he 
thinks it is. But with extremely rare exceptions, the treatment 
centers are unable to do that," he comments.

  [Text] The Red Command [CV] is a criminal organization 
created in 1979 at the Candido Mendes Prison on Ilha Grande 
(RJ). At present, it is estimated that nearly 6,500 armed men 
are working directly for the CV, with another 300,000 persons 
linked to the organization indirectly. 
  Their activities range from drug trafficking to holdups of 
banks and armored cars, as well as kidnapping. The money 
collected is used to purchase large volumes of drugs. 
  The CV uses sophisticated weapons, such as 7.65 pistols, 9 
mm 
Beretta, Uzi, and Ingram machine guns, automatic rifles, 
grenades, repeating rifles, special laser sights, special steel 
ammunition, and both antitank and antiaircraft military armament. 
  Yesterday, the Military Police [PM] mounted a genuine war 
operation, with 503 men, in an attempt to dismantle the Red 
Command's first QG [headquarters] in Sao Paulo. The PM located a 
CV observation post at the eastern end of Sao Paulo, and 
detected the beginning of the formation of a network of 
"informers" in the neighborhood. No one from the CV was arrested. 
  The blitz began at 0800, ending at 1600. Also used were 40 
dogs, 22 horses, 50 light and 13 heavy vehicles, one helicopter, 
and all types of weapons. 
  Within the past 20 days, the ROTA (Tobias de Aguiar 
Exhibition Patrols) learned of the CV's presence in Cidade 
Tiradentes. The CV had already purchased three apartments in the 
same building of a housing complex in the upper part of a 
locality known as "Morro Disso," as well as several vehicles and 
weapons. 
  On 24 February, in that building, the ROTA arrested the 
siblings Antonio Julio Ellio, aged 32; Paulo Sergio Ellio, 25; 
Paulo Sergio Ellio, 25; Johnny Marcos Ellio, 23; and Nilva 
Juciara Ellio, 18. Five other persons escaped. Two of them, 
discovered later, were killed in a shootout with the police. 
Three are fugitives. 
  Ten days ago, the PM engaged in further patrolling, this 
time 
by helicopter. The police discovered that, in the upper part of 
the same building, a CV observation post was being operated. 
Since the site is located at the highest point in the district, 
from which the CV's lookouts were observing all movements, the 
PM decided not to invade the premises again. They feared that a 
shootout would endanger the other residents. 
  Yesterday, Colonel Carlos Augusto de Mello, aged 51, 
commander of the CPM (Metropolitan Police Command), remarked: 
"The information confirms the reports and the indications. The 
Red Command is attempting to set up its factions here." 
  According to the colonel, the CV selected Cidade Tiradentes 
because the district, with nearly 500,000 inhabitants, is quite 
similar to the Rio de Janeiro State Lowlands. He observed: "It 
is a district with a low income population and many premises 
suitable for hiding. It is situated far from the city, and has 
virtually only one access road, facilitating its control by the 
CV." 
  Yesterday, the PM divided the district into eight sectors. 
Covering each of them were 30 men from the shock platoon, two 
policewomen, five men, four dogs, two motorcycles, and one ROTA 
car carrying four men. All were armed. Blockades were set up on 
the only two access roads to the district: Santa Terezinha 
Avenue and Inacio Monteiro Street. 
  During the blitz, 1,023 persons were accosted, 610 vehicles 
were searched, one minor was taken into custody for stealing a 
television set, 41 persons were held as suspects, and eight were 
detained for questioning.

<F P=106> [Interview with Mauro Sposito, superintendent of Amazonas </F>
Federal Police, by Ivania Vieira; place and date not given: 
"Brazil and Venezuela Join To Blockade Drug Traffic"; 
introductory paragraph in italics as published] 
  [Text] The Federal Police Superintendency in Amazonas 
is beginning an unprecedented experiment along the Amazon Region 
border. It is the Blockade Project. The idea is to uncover at 
every level the activity of drug traffickers who find the region 
to be a splendid home for their business. The "blockade" is 
subdivided into four subprojects and will utilize a vast 
information network involving the Armed Forces of Brazil and its 
bordering countries, federal agencies, petroleum distributors, 
aircraft monitoring systems, and a regional contingent of 200 
federal police agents. The entire program has one goal: to 
remove Brazil from the list of cocaine transit countries by 
1996. That list, which is drawn up by the United Nations, also 
includes Venezuela, Brazil's partner in the project. According 
to the United Nations, neighboring Peru, Colombia, and Bolivia 
form the team of producers. The Brazilian Government wants to 
beef up the fight in cooperation with those countries and 
increase the barriers to trafficking activities. "From now on, 
it will be very hard for drugs to reach the consuming center," 
says PF/AM [Amazonas Federal Police] Superintendent Mauro 
Sposito. The amount of money to be spent on the operation was 
not revealed. In Sao Gabriel da Cachoeira at the beginning of 
this week, Sposito participated in the Sixth Military Exchange 
Meeting between the Armies of Brazil and Venezuela with only one 
task in mind: to discuss the "blockade's" strategies and explain 
them to the military. In this exclusive interview with A 
CRITICA, Mauro Sposito said he was excited about the future. He 
is convinced that this time the drug traffickers will have to 
find new alternatives for keeping their business going. "For our 
part, we promise to extend the barriers and put those people out 
of business," he announced. 
  Vieira: How is the Federal Police Department going 
to participate in the exchange between the Brazilian and 
Venezuelan Armies? 
  Sposito: The problem of drug trafficking is one of 
the most serious problems in this region. We border on producing 
countries. Brazil and Venezuela are both regarded as transit 
countries, they are faced with the same difficulties, and, 
because of that, we have agreed that exchanging information is 
valuable in order for us to engage in uniform repressive action. 
  Vieira: What activities are under way? 
  Sposito: We discovered that the producing center 
for refined cocaine in Colombia was shipping a small part of its 
production down the Amazon River, whose waters are 
international. The traffickers were crossing Amazonas and even 
using Brazilian ports to export cocaine hidden inside other 
kinds of merchandise (black pepper, wood, cupuacu, and 
pineapple). We closed off the Solimoes River in September 1993. 
Since then, all boats using the river have been inspected. The 
barrier relies on the element of surprise and can be set up 
anywhere on the Solimoes. At the same time, we have been keeping 
track of repression activities in Colombia, and that has enabled 
us to tighten our controls. You see, all the laboratories they 
have discovered up to now -- over the past three years -- have 
been located in the Colombian Amazon Region, an area which, like 
our own, escapes control by the authorities. Large areas with 
few inhabitants and no roads facilitate activities by drug 
traffickers. Since November, radio operations have been 
monitored through the Monitinga and Monifer Project. The first 
of those acronyms stands for Monitoring of Radio Frequency 
Communications in Tabatinga, and the second stands for 
Monitoring of Radio Frequency Communications in Tefe. Although 
new, this project shows that we are on the right track because 
we have an advantage over the drug traffickers. Another project 
that is now in the process of being set up is CAPA (Aircraft 
Fueling and Landing Control). The traffickers use small 
airplanes to carry drugs. We are not in a position to police the 
airspace. So we have started monitoring the flying range of 
those aircraft as they leave Colombia for some consuming center 
and need to refuel. CAPA is being introduced gradually because 
it requires coordination with the Ministry of Aeronautics and 
with petroleum distributors (Petrobras, Shell, and Esso). The 
Brazilian Government will soon be using various means of control 
to neutralize the traffickers' activities. 
  Vieira: What are the results of that range of 
repressive actions? 
  Sposito: The entire operation is causing 
traffickers to seek alternatives for getting their drugs to the 
big consuming centers. In Belem, for example, which is one of 
our main information gathering centers, we arrested "Cerquinho" 
(Daniel Parada). A number of big shots were arrested that year 
because of the work under way. 
  Vieira: Is exchange with Colombia complicated? 
  Sposito: No. The institutions there are serious. 
There may be individuals within the institutions who are not 
doing their jobs, but that is normal in any area of activity. In 
our case, the contact is not personal; it takes place through 
the Federal Police in the two countries. In that connection, 
support by the Colombian PF [Federal Police] has been decisive 
in ensuring the success of operations. 
  Vieira: How is the cocaine market divided up? 
  Sposito: Colombia is the world's largest cocaine 
producer. It is said that 60 percent of its GDP [gross domestic 
product] comes from drug transactions. The United States is the 
biggest consumer, followed by Europe. Consumption in Brazil is 
still in its beginning stages and is concentrated mainly in Sao 
Paulo and Rio de Janeiro. Most of the consumption in Manaus is 
not of cocaine but of coca base, which by the way is a bigger 
poison than the other poison -- it is mixed with sulfuric acid. 
  Vieira: With the traditional corridors blockaded, 
what other routes would the traffickers use? 
  Sposito: They have to get the goods to the 
consuming centers. We have to intercept them. They are currently 
using Venezuela as a camp; they may increase their shipments 
through Colombia's west coast. One thing is certain: the drug 
traffickers will seek other alternatives. I can guarantee you 
that they are very worried. We have even seized goods coming 
from Bolivia because Colombia was unable to send the product 
here. 
  Vieira: What other actions does the PF intend to 
take to neutralize the drug traffickers? 
  Sposito: We are discussing a project to be carried 
out in cooperation with Suframa [Manaus Free Trade Zone 
Superintendency]. To combat the smuggling that has been going on 
in the western Amazon Region, that agency is going to establish 
a number of controls. We are working with it on that. Suframa is 
interested in controlling the entry of goods, while the Federal 
Police are interested in controlling what leaves. We are 
combining our interests. We are providing Suframa with police 
power, and it, in turn, will help us financially with that 
activity. There are only two ways to enter this part of the 
country: by river, meaning the Amazon River, and by land, 
meaning Highway BR-364. We are going to blockade the highway at 
Vilhena in Roraima and Obidos in Para. 
  Vieira: How many men are involved in that project? 
  Sposito: We have mobilized around 60 men. That is 
not enough. To implement the plan in the western Amazon Region, 
I need 200 men combating the drug traffic. Our goal is to 
complete all phases of the project by 1996. 
  Vieira: What is the Blockade Project? 
  Sposito: We have four subdivisions within the 
project. They are the Blockade Project proper, which consists of 
a river police detachment based in Tabatinga and the river 
police detachment based in Manaus; Rescon, or Colombian Report, 
which monitors repressive operations where the problem starts -- 
in Colombia -- so we can decide what actions to take here; CAPA, 
which is in the process of being set up; and the Monifer and 
Monitinga Project. Besides those four components of the main 
Blockade Project, we have an additional project called the 
"closing of the Amazon Region." It will be implemented in 
cooperation with Suframa. This project will affect 12 
localities: Obidos, Vilhena, Ananindeua, Pacaraima, the B/V-8 
boundary mark, Bonfim, Cruzeiro do Sul, Epitaciolandia in 
Brasileia, the Abuna River, Humaita, Manaus, and Tabatinga. 
  Vieira: How do Peru and Bolivia fit into this 
picture? 
  Sposito: Action is integrated. Our intention is 
that the work will have comprehensive effects. Peru is the 
world's biggest producer of coca base. In other words, Peru 
produces coca base and sends it to Colombia, where the product 
is refined and exported to the consuming centers. Peru and 
Colombia are responsible for 80 percent of all the cocaine in 
the world, while Bolivia produces 20 percent. The Blockade 
Project will gradually affect all the countries along the 
border. It will enter Bolivia the moment we close off the Abuna 
and Vilhena. By closing the Abuna, we will shut off access 
through Madeira/Mamore. In that way, we will also put obstacles 
in the way of the traffic moving in the opposite direction, 
which carries the chemicals necessary for refining the cocaine. 
Those chemicals come from abroad, enter Brazilian territory, and 
then arrive in Colombia and Bolivia. 
  Vieira: What is the goal behind this work by the 
Federal Police? 
  Sposito: The United Nations classifies countries 
as producing countries, transit countries, and consuming 
countries. The producing countries are Peru, Colombia, and 
Bolivia. Ecuador is no longer included on that list. Transit 
countries are those which, like Brazil, have structures, road 
networks, river systems, and airports that make it easy for 
traffickers to get around inside the country and alter the goods 
to come up with the final product. We want to free Brazil of the 
stigma of being a "drug transit country." Brazil will be off 
that list by 1996. That is what we are working toward.

<F P=106> [Article by Gleides Pamplona] </F>
  [Text] The residents of the sophisticated Bela Suica 
district of Londrina, in northern Parana, were not surprised by 
the fact that one of their neighbors was a Japanese with his 
hair dyed blonde. But they certainly found it odd that anyone in 
a position to reside in a typical foreign executive's mansion 
should spend his time at home, apparently idle. The household 
employees also were amazed that their employer bathed in a 
swimming pool wearing long pants and a long-sleeved shirt, 
buttoned to the neck. However, what most piqued the employees' 
imagination was one of their employer's hands, the left one, on 
which the little finger was amputated. The mystery began to 
unravel on the afternoon of Monday, 7 March. The blond Japanese, 
named Hitoshi Tanabe, is 32 years old. The money with which he 
was paying the $1,300 to rent the luxurious eight-bedroom house 
is not from any inheritance or lottery prize. In fact, the 
source of Tanabe's funds is the dreaded Japanese Yakuza Mafia, 
of which he is a member. 
  Tanabe's arrest by the Federal Police could prove decisive 
for exposing the Yakuza's intricate operations, and the strategy 
for its activity in Brazil. The "Mafioso" jailed in Brasilia, 
awaiting extradition, has been in the country since at least 
early 1993. The first warning of his presence was provided in 
February, by the Japanese police, after the seizure, in Tokyo, 
of 5.6 kg of cocaine put aboard in Sao Paulo. The trafficker who 
was arrested claimed that the drugs belonged to Tanabe, and that 
he was in Brazil to coordinate the Yakuza's activities in the 
areas of extorting business firms, drug dealing, exploiting the 
labor of "dekasseguis" (descendants of immigrants contracted to 
work in Japan), and the traditional trafficking in women. The 
"Mafioso's" presence in Sao Paulo became public knowledge in 
April, when JORNAL PAULISTA, directed toward the Japanese 
colony, printed a feature article on him. Because of the 
disclosure, Tanabe had to flee to Buenos Aires. He did not 
return until September, when he rented the Londrina mansion, 
residing there with his wife, Kiyomi, and his 11-month old 
daughter, Mary, registered as a Brazilian. However, he was 
constantly visiting Sao Paulo, apparently not fearing exposure. 
He even showed his body completely tattooed (with a brightly 
colored dragon on his back, and a geisha with cherry blossoms on 
his chest) to the prostitute, A.C.R., an 18-year old blonde. 
During October, they spent a night together at an apartment on 
the 16th floor of the luxurious Hotel Eldorado, in downtown Sao 
Paulo. On that day, Tanabe smoked "crack" and spoke very little. 
He left $100 in payment. 
  In Londrina, the Tanabe family's life was more discreet. 
S.A.S., a female employee at the mansion, claims that they 
seldom went out, and received no visitors. However, as the 
police learned, it was from there that Tanabe was directing the 
work of the agencies recruiting "nisei" [descendants of Japanese 
immigrants] interested in employment in Japan. One of the 
contractors of cheap labor was the Okayama Tourist Agency, 
established in Vila Mariana, in the southern zone of the Sao 
Paulo capital. It was acting as a broker to send young people, 
paying their fare and keeping them under control. According to 
the social worker, Reimei Yoshioka, from the Center for 
Information and Assistance to Workers Abroad, there are 
currently about 150,000 Brazilians working in Japan on jobs 
arranged by the Yakuza. An Okayama employee reported that 
another recruitment is due to occur on Monday, 14 March. Among 
the youths already recruited are the brothers, F.H.T., aged 18, 
and G.H.T., 17. According to their stepfather, the agency 
promised F.H.T. a job at the Osaka airport. However, upon his 
arrival there, his passport was seized by the Mafia and he was 
assigned to bridge construction. Since he requested the 
cancellation of the contract, the Yakuza began deducting 1,500 
yen from his salary of 2,000 yen to pay the installments on his 
fare, and for a "penalty." The stepfather claims that G.H.T. is 
working at a golf club near Tokyo. Many of these clubs serve 
only as a front for prostitution, according to the journalist, 
Marcos Lacerda, who has lived in Tokyo for three years. 
  Author of the book "High-Tech Slum," about the Yakuza, 
Lacerda remarked that the Asian Mafia's mainstay is the sex 
industry, with an annual billing of approximately $150 billion. 
The journalist does not even think that Tanabe is the leader of 
any faction. "A Yakuza leader would never be acting foolishly in 
a small city like Londrina," he comments. As for the amputated 
finger, this is the sinister punishment imposed on those who 
flout the organization's rules. Besides investigating the 
activity of the "dekasseguis" companies, through which drugs 
reportedly are being trafficked to Tokyo, the Federal Police are 
also being informed on Tanabe's connection with the construction 
of a sports complex in Londrina. While the investigations are 
under way in Parana and Sao Paulo, Tanabe is attempting to 
convince the Brazilian Government not to extradite him. His 
allegation is that his daughter is Brazilian.

<F P=106> [Article by Rick Catlin: "Customs Support for Coalition </F>
Against Drugs"] 
  [Text] New Customs Task Force Supervisor Mr. Langley Powery 
is in full support of a recent proposal for a Joint Task Force 
(with officers from various agencies) to wage war against drugs 
in the Cayman Islands. 
  "The formation of the Task Force will eliminate overlapping 
of duties and the compiling of equipment and resources," said 
Mr. Powery. 
  At present, he said, numerous agencies (Police, Customs, 
Immigration, etc.) receive information about drugs. Sometimes, 
"we can have two groups working on the same case." With all 
information being channeled to one agency, "this would avoid a 
lot of overlap." 
  Additionally, the JTF will be able to make good use of all 
equipment needed in the war on drugs and coordinate purchases. 
He said his office is currently compiling a list of equipment 
needed. 
  Among the items of equipment he'd like to see the JTF have 
is 
an Ionscan machine. The new device, currently being used at 
selected US and Canadian airports, detects guns, drugs and 
dangerous chemicals in baggage or being carried by passengers. 
  "It may not be viable for customs full time, but (it) would 
be a big help on boats and for the Joint Task Force to make good 
use of along with the dogs," he pointed out. 
  The Customs Task Force, which he took over in December 1993, 
does not have the manpower nor equipment to effectively keep 
drugs out of Cayman when much of the unguarded and unpatrolled 
coast line is used. 
  His department has just 11 people full time to combat the 
importation of drugs. Combined with the 14 from the Police Drugs 
Squad unit, this means just 25 officers are available from Drugs 
Squad and Customs in the fight against drugs. Recently, several 
politicians have said drugs is the Number One crime problem in 
the Cayman Islands. 
  "We really need to double the size of the task force," he 
said. "Many of his officers are putting in long hours every day, 
but have to avoid burnout and keep morale high." 
  He has requested an additional six officers, but he feels 
three staff will be going to man the Marine Unit which will 
patrol the coast line. 
  Mr. Powery is 100 percent behind the formation of the Marine 
Unit/coast guard unit, but cautioned that "one boat is not going 
to be enough." 
  "We have too much coast line plus we have 12 miles out (to 
patrol) from all three islands." 
  He said ideally the coast guard, which likely will be a unit 
of the Joint Task Force, should have at least three boats and 
possibly four. Two should be around 48-foot with radar 
capability while a third boat is needed for "pursuit and 
interception." 
  "We also need a small boat for going into shallow waters," 
he 
pointed out. 
  And how serious is the problem of drugs coming into the 
Cayman Islands? "The number of incidents of drugs (encountered 
by Customs) has doubled in the past five years," he stated. "The 
public are probably not aware of the business of drugs. It's a 
business and island demand is growing." 
  Along with several of his peers, Mr. Powery believes around 
80 percent of drugs in Cayman are coming from Jamaica, Honduras 
and Colombia for shipment to the U.S. However, he disputes that 
Customs only seizes 10 percent of illegal drugs entering Cayman. 
"Along the coast line, we probably only get 10 percent right 
now, because we don't have patrol boats. But at the airport, 
port and depot, we get much more than 10 percent." 
  He noted the Customs Task Force has had good success against 
`mules' heading to the U.S. with drugs brought to Cayman from 
other locations. However, that success does not mean his 
department is getting overconfident. 
  "Each officer is aware of the drugs problem. They are 
dedicated officers, regardless of how much we get or don't get." 
  During 1993, the CTF arrested 22 people and seized 50.32 
kilos of ganja and 54.7 grams of cocaine. Among those arrested 
were 8 Jamaicans, 7 Americans, 4 Caymanians and two from Chile. 
  While the amount of illegal drugs seized declined from 1992, 
the number of people arrested went up. He's hoping the JTF will 
be able to improve considerably on drugs seized and persons 
arrested. 
  Despite the growing problem of drugs, Powery is committed to 
the battle, regardless of his resources or equipment. "This 
(job) is a definite challenge, and I've been working real hard. 
I'm optimistic about the future. Our officers are highly 
motivated and we are working well with drug squads." 
  "I really hope the Joint Task Force concept becomes a 
reality."

  [Excerpt] Less than one week after 850 pounds of ganja was 
found washed up on a Cayman Brac beach, a further 110 pounds of 
the drug was discovered on the beach at Old Man Bay in North 
Side early Wednesday morning (9 February). 
  The initial police report said the ganja appeared to have 
been in the water for some time. Drugs Squad officers were to 
examine the ganja Wednesday and Thursday to determine if the 
drugs were originally destined for Cayman or part of a shipment 
dumped at sea and washed ashore by accident. 
  The 110 pounds of ganja would have a street value of 
slightly 
more than CI$105,000. [passage omitted]

  [Text] Nearly 700 pounds of ganja wrapped in burlap bags 
for distribution was found in the brush at an East End beach 
Friday afternoon at 2 p.m. 
  Police said the actual weight of the drug came to 697.5 
pounds. The ganja was contained in 23 separate bags that were 
marked `Jamaica' on the outside said a police source. 
  The ganja appeared to be professionally packaged and 
intended 
for transhipment to another destination, most likely the U.S., 
he said. 
  Drugs Squad Superintendent Trevor Cutts could not be reached 
for comment on the discovery. In the past, Mr. Cutts has said 
the large amounts of ganja found on Cayman beaches indicate the 
islands are being used to ship drugs from Jamaica and Honduras 
to the U.S. through Miami. 
  Travellers from Grand Cayman are seldom detained and 
searched 
when clearing Customs at Miami International Airport.

  [Text] Colombia is not a corrupt country and its 
presidential candidates do not have links to the mafia, the 
Colombian Government and political circles said when they 
rejected charges in this regard by the U.S. Congress. 
  In general terms we are a clean country and that is why we 
reject such slander, Colombian Ambassador in Washington Gabriel 
Silva said. We will not remain indifferent nor will we allow 
these charges to prosper. Many innocent persons have died and 
we are not going to trample on their memories, he said. 
  The government expressed its concern and disagreement with 
the accusation that the entire country is corrupt and that the 
presidential candidates receive support from the mafia. 
According to the U.S. Congress, this accusation is based on 
confessions by former Medellin Cartel member Gabriel Taboada. 
  The ambassador described those hearings and the statements 
by 
the drug trafficker -- who is a witness for Senator Kerry -- as 
inadmissible. He also lamented that all of this has weakened 
the war on drugs. Ambassador Silva said the accusations by this 
convict are an affront to the families of thousands of brave 
Colombians who have lost their lives in this war on the mafias. 
He said the mere use of Taboada is a clear sign of how 
Congress' watchdog function has been sidetracked, something that 
will affect our capacity to learn about the reality of the war 
on drugs. Apparently the only firsthand information this drug 
trafficker has goes back to the mid-1980's, but he was 
nevertheless allowed to question the integrity of an entire 
country, which is known in the whole world as a leader in the 
struggle against drugs, Ambassador Gabriel Silva said.

<F P=106> [Report from the "Seven O'Clock Newscast"] </F>
  [Text] Reaction from the country's political circles to the 
outrageous hearing held by the U.S. Senate Subcommittee on 
Terrorism, Narcotics, and International Operations were not long 
in coming. Several presidential candidates, who according to 
Gabriel Taboada are in the pay of drug traffickers, had this to 
say today. [begin recording] 
  Andres Pastrana, Conservative Party presidential 
candidate: I am concerned to see that the attempt to 
besmirch Colombia's name continues. When a person makes 
accusations, he should name names. That is what the country 
needs. If he has names, let him say so. It is important that 
the country know if there is drug money in the political 
campaigns. The information must come out. As far as I am 
concerned, I am absolutely certain there is no drug money. I 
have just given my records to the Overseer of the National 
Treasury, to the National Electoral Council, and to the 
Colombian people. People cannot continue making these 
accusations. 
  Antonio Navarro Wolff, presidential candidate for 19 
April Movement Democratic Alliance: I say categorically 
that Antonio Navarro and Jesus Pinacue have not received a penny 
from drug traffickers for their campaign. I am not familiar 
with the rest of Mr. Taboada's statement, and it is hard to 
comment on something with which I am unfamiliar. 
  Enrique Parejo, presidential candidate of the National 
Democratic Alternative: Some of what was said reflects what 
many Colombians have been saying. There is drug money in the 
political campaigns, and there has been in the past. Drug money 
has infiltrated institutions. That is a fact, and I have 
denounced it. [end recording] 
  The government and the Prosecutor General's Office commented 
on the matter. [begin recording] 
  Deputy Prosecutor General Francisco Sintura: 
Senator Kerry, respect Colombian justice and do not get too 
close to rogues. 
  Defense Minister Rafael Pardo: Those remarks 
cannot be taken seriously. They reflect an ill-intended 
distortion to harm a country that has suffered a great deal from 
drug trafficking. It is not justified to give credence to 
someone who has no information and no way to get any and whose 
charges are not serious. [end recording]

caption] 
  [Text] Indignation is growing in our country in the face 
of statements by drug trafficker Gabriel Taboada to a U.S. 
congressional commission meeting summoned by Democratic 
politician John Kerry. Taboada said that every area of 
Colombian life has been infiltrated by drug trafficking. Let us 
hear some reactions: [begin recording] 
  General Hernan Guzman, Army commander, in 
progress: ...our country, and thus, completely loses the 
outlook of his country. Therefore, to think that this has.... 
[pauses] it is inappropriate to give a certain credence to the 
statements of this individual. 
  General Octavio Vargas, National Police director: 
It is unfair to attack the dignity of people who are working 
courageously, honestly, and morally. 
  General Miguel Maza Marquez, presidential 
candidate: It is urgent to clarify this to stop the 
stigmatization of Colombia and avert unpredictable consequences. 
  Unidentified reporter: Is this an affront to the 
country, Mr. President? 
  President Cesar Gaviria: Yes, we have publicly 
stated, and in a very detailed manner, Colombia's position on 
this issue. We have demanded a sensible stand from the U.S. 
Government and the American people toward the efforts that our 
nation has made. 
  Presidential candidate Andres Pastrana, in 
progress: ...and know about money used in political 
campaigns in Colombia, must denounce it. 
  Vice Presidential candidate Humberto de la Calle: 
This is not a narco-democracy; Rodrigo Lara, Luis Carlos Galan, 
Carlos Mauro Hoyos, Guillermo Cano, journalists, and magistrates 
died here. We are fighting drug trafficking here; we must 
reject such claims that are unfair and constitute an insult to 
Colombia. 
  Presidential candidate Enrique Parejo: The 
government must demand from the United States the evidence that 
serves as the basis for the offensive that you talked about, or 
the testimony of Senator Kerry, or the testimony of this drug 
trafficker. 
  Presidential candidate Ernesto Samper: He must 
demonstrate that. I think that one cannot throw accusations 
into the air. There must be proof and certainty. The world must 
understand that we are not the drug traffickers but the main 
victims of trafficking. I was one of them. [end recording]

  [Text] Upon arriving in the United States from London, 
Prosecutor General Gustavo de Greiff said President Cesar 
Gaviria's administration is subservient to the United States. 
De Greiff called several U.S. officials liars and accused 
President Gaviria of unnecessarily criticizing him for his fight 
against drug traffickers. De Greiff said the president wanted 
to calm the U.S. Government's temper by attacking him. The 
prosecutor general said of the Colombian Government: They 
wanted to make themselves seem subservient to the U.S. 
Government by attacking me. 
  As for the accusations that Colombia is a narcodemocracy, de 
Greiff said it is an exaggerated perception and once again 
called Senator Kerry and Assistant Attorney General Harris liars.

  [Text] Before 2 May, the government might again declare a 
state of internal disturbance. Special measures would have to 
be taken to prevent -- for the third time -- the possible mass 
release of terrorists and drug traffickers from the country's 
prisons. 
  In a letter, the attorney general [Carlos Gustavo Arrieta] 
warned the prosecutor general [Gustavo de Greiff] that if the 
legal situation is not defined for narcoterrorists and 
guerrillas, who have been held for 180 days as of 2 May, they 
will have to be released from jail, according to the new law. 
That mass release of suspected criminals has again alarmed the 
government, which does not rule out a declaration of a state of 
internal disturbance to prevent the release of drug traffickers 
and terrorists. [begin recording] 
  Government Minister Fabio Villegas: The government 
would evaluate the situation with the Prosecutor General's 
Office and would jointly make relevant decisions with that 
office. 
  Unidentified reporter: Has the declaration of a 
state of internal disturbance been ruled out? 
  Villegas: We are not ruling it out nor are we 
stating that it is going to be decreed. [end recording] 
  On another topic, the government minister described as 
absurd 
the assertions of confessed drug trafficker Gabriel Taboada in 
Washington and he criticized the position of U.S. Senator John 
Kerry. [begin recording] 
  Villegas: It is absurd and incomprehensible that a 
U.S. senator values the opinion of a criminal, a confessed 
criminal, more than this country's record in the struggle 
against drug trafficking. [end recording] 
  For the government, it is clear the struggle against drug 
trafficking will continue without rest, and not just to please 
someone in particular.

  [Text] The Colombian Government today admitted punishment 
for drug traffickers is very lax and suggested that sentences be 
doubled through changes in the law. The recommendation is not 
designed to make changes to the frequently discussed Procedural 
Code but to the Penal Code. [begin recording] 
  Justice Minister Andres Gonzalez: What is obvious 
is that the sentences need to be significantly harsher, and 
there are several reasons for this. I believe that current 
sentences should be at least doubled. [end recording] 
  Justice Minister Gonzalez said that for the government's 
policy to be successful, stronger sentences for drug traffickers 
must be accompanied by appropriate interpretations of the system 
used to reduce sentences. [begin recording] 
  Gonzalez: I believe there are many loopholes 
certain lawyers use to get sentences reduced. These loopholes 
are not included in the law. [end recording] 
  It is very clear to the government that some of the 
guidelines established in light of the internal unrest and 
former state of siege gave the drug traffickers too many 
advantages, and, in turn, these advantages resulted in absurd 
sentences.

  [Text] Medellin (Colombia), 23 Apr (EFE) -- Captain 
Humberto Coral Caballero, one of the Colombian Armed Forces 
officers who was part of the Search Bloc that killed drug 
trafficker Pablo Escobar in December, was murdered on Friday in 
Medellin, police sources reported today. 
  Coral Caballero was shot by two persons in a vehicle while 
he 
was on leave in La America neighborhood, the same area in 
western Medellin where the Medellin Cartel chief was killed on 2 
December 1993. 
  Escobar was gunned down in one of his hideouts after a 
search 
that lasted over a year and involved more than 1,500 policemen. 
  The murder of Capt. Coral Caballero, who was from 
Barranquilla, is among the first crimes in Medellin involving 
officers following Escobar's death.

  [Text] Medellin, Colombia, 19 Apr (AFP) -- Jorge Eliecer 
Avendano, alias "El Loco," an alleged member of the Medellin 
Cartel, surrendered voluntarily to justice in this northeastern 
Colombian city on Tuesday, it has been officially reported. 
  The alleged criminal is the brother of Jorge Eduardo "Tato" 
Avendano, a lieutenant of the late Pablo Escobar, who after 
escaping with the "capo" and eight other collaborators in July 
1992 from Envigado Prison surrendered to justice two months 
later. 
  According to Fernando Mancilla, Antioquia Department 
regional 
prosecutor, "Loco" Avendano's surrender "was carried out 
normally," and after giving his first deposition to authorities, 
he was confined to the prison of the neighboring locality of 
Itagui, where there are other Escobar henchmen. 
  The judicial official has refrained from commenting on 
whether this surrender means the resumption of cartel members 
surrendering to justice to take advantage of the legislation 
contemplating reduced jail sentences and other benefits for drug 
traffickers who turn themselves in and confess at least one of 
their offenses.

Drug-Trafficking"] 
  [Text] Three Trinidadians held in Carriacou last week 
with a large quantity of foreign exchange were released, 
re-arrested, and then charged with drug trafficking. 
  Shaffic Mohammed, Kishore Basdeo and Kenrick Ruyes were 
denied bail when they appeared before the Sauteurs Magistrate's 
Court in Grenada on Tuesday. 
  The trio had been detained by Carriacou police since 
February 
8, when their pirogue experienced engine troubles and had to be 
towed ashore. 
  Police said they discovered that the men were sailing in an 
unnamed speedboat, carrying unusually large amounts of cash, 
including some U.S.$153,000 and 10,000 British pounds sterling. 
  The men told the police they were on their way to St. Lucia, 
but they were kept in custody pending investigations into the 
origin of the cash. 
  During this time the Grenada police received a call from a 
Tunapuna businessman who claimed that the money on the boat was 
his, and that the correct sum was $164,500. 
  Grenada attorney Kenrick Radix who is representing the trio, 
said that he successfully challenged their detention by filing a 
habeas corpus application on their behalf on February 11. 
  However, the men were not released until February 14. 
  As soon as they were released, he said, they were arrested 
and charged with drug trafficking in Grenada, drug trafficking 
in St. Lucia and drug trafficking in Trinidad, and unlawful 
possession of U.S.$153,000 and 10,000 British pounds, being the 
proceeds of drug trafficking. 
  The cases were adjourned to February 22.

<F P=106> [Report by Lourdes Bonilla and Roberto Reyes at the </F>
Government House in Tegucigalpa--live relay] 
  [Text] [Bonilla] Dr. Jorge Arturo Reina, who is the vice 
president of the Congress and brother of President Carlos 
Roberto Reina, has confirmed the report this station released a 
few minutes ago from the Government House. That report noted 
that within the next few hours the National Security Council 
will discuss the Honduran Armed Forces' plan to break the 
Military Assistance Treaty with the United States -- a treaty 
that dates back to 1954. Reporter Roberto Reyes has more details 
on this. 
  Reyes: Dr. Jorge Arturo Reina specifically noted 
that the legislative and executive branches today intend to 
review the Military Assistance Treaty between the United States 
and Honduras. Here is what he said when asked about this topic: 
[begin recording] 
  Unidentified reporter, in progress: ...on what is 
a review of the Military Assistance Treaty with the United 
States? 
  Reina: No, the meeting we attended did not deal 
with that issue. At this time, we are coming from a meeting the 
president held with the deputies from Francisco Morazan 
Department, but we did not touch on this topic. 
  Reporter: Will there be a National Security 
Council meeting to review this topic? 
  Reina: I think the president has proposed the 
advisability of a National Security Council meeting, but not 
only for that purpose, but also to address the problem of 
violence in an effort to get an overall view of this problem and 
a joint decision from all sectors of society [words indistinct]. 
  Reporter: When will this meeting be held? 
  Reina: I do not know. That will be announced by 
the president. 
  Reporter: Do you agree with the [words indistinct] 
of the Armed Forces about the U.S.-Honduran military agreement? 
  Second unidentified reporter: Will [words 
indistinct] to citizens of the country? 
  Reina: Well, I have seen how the world has 
changed. A few years ago, we proposed the advisability of 
(reviewing) treaties. At that time, that was a taboo subject. 
Now it is prudent for Honduras to review any and all treaties 
to determine whether they are providing benefits and whether 
they are consistent with the nation's sovereignty. 
Nevertheless, I do not think we should portray this as a 
serious problem, because conditions exist for reviewing every 
international relationship, and, if the countries agree, they 
can discuss such topics. 
  Reporter: What about the situation that arose 
today in Congress because of the questioning of the ENEE 
[National Enterprise for Electric Power] manager? What is goal 
of Congress in this? 
  Reina: I think that in all of these cases -- in 
both the invitation Congress extended to the ENEE, as well as to 
Cohdefor [Honduran Corporation for Forest Development] -- there 
is no other goal but to have them explain to the Honduran people 
how difficult it is to resolve the country's extremely serious 
problems. 
  Reporter: Now that you are in government, can you 
guarantee to the Honduran people that you are going to review 
the treaties and do what you always said you would do -- things 
you said you would do even before you were a university leader 
and [words indistinct]? 
  Reina: Well, we continue to maintain the same 
unwavering position. That has never changed. World conditions 
have changed, however. In terms of the U.S. Palmerola base, to 
which I assume you are referring, it has been proposed that it 
be turned into a base for combating drug trafficking instead of 
a military base in the old sense of the word -- the kind of base 
that has traditionally existed in Latin American countries. 
  Reporter: Congress has had a commission discussing 
this. At least Mr. Rafael Pineda Ponce spoke about this in a 
report we aired. 
  Reina: That is correct. We think treaties must be 
reviewed in terms of today's climate and based on the [words 
indistinct] most advisable for Honduras' national interests. In 
this sense, I think that there will be unity among the Honduran 
people and that, in the end, the best thing will be done. 
  Reporter: [words indistinct] the North Americans? 
  Reina: I think that recently the North Americans 
have been maintaining a symbolic troop presence. However, I 
also think there is something more important. The presence of 
U.S. forces during the Cold War had a significance that was very 
different from what it now has that the Cold War no longer 
exists. In addition, the idea that has been proposed to turn 
Palmerola into a base from which to wage a war against 
international drug trafficking, which is a transnational crime, 
completely changes the nature of the symbolic U.S. presence and 
would give Honduras greater control of the installations, which 
would be used precisely to fight drug trafficking. 
  Reporter: But these are foreign troops in the 
country, regardless of their objective. 
  Reina: The presence of a large number would make 
no sense. Any assistance needed to operate equipment and needed 
to train Hondurans to operate equipment would be highly 
beneficial for Honduras and the region. 
  Reporter: In short, would Congress be supporting 
the review of that military treaty with the United States? 
  Reina: Well, the discussion of that topic has not 
been concluded. It has to be discussed more carefully, but you 
can be sure that the executive branch and the Congress are 
defending Honduras' national interests above anything else. 
  Reporter: What is the (position) of the executive 
branch in this case? What has the president told you in this 
regard? 
  Reina: About what? 
  Reporter: About [words indistinct]. 
  Reina: We have not discussed this topic. We have 
only commented on how conditions have changed and on how it is 
now possible to discuss any topic without this being seen as an 
unfriendly act against another country. 
  Reporter: [words indistinct] 
  Reina: He will be the one [words indistinct]. [end 
recording] 
  Reyes: This is what Congress Vice President Jorge 
Arturo Reina has said. He confirmed that the National Security 
Council will be meeting specifically to discuss this topic and 
that the executive and the legislative branches are willing to 
review the issue of U.S. military assistance to Honduras.

  [Text] Although National Congress President Carlos Roberto 
Flores has explained that any action involving the military 
treaty signed with the United States in 1954 concerns the 
president of the Republic, he stated on 19 April that it is 
important for the treaty to be discussed, because it may no 
longer reflect the current situation. 
  Flores revealed that so far he has only received unofficial 
information regarding the intention of General Discua, commander 
in chief of the Armed Forces and head of the Supreme Council of 
the Armed Forces, to seek a rejection of the treaty. 
  Flores said, "The president is the one who has jurisdiction 
and responsibility for negotiating international agreements and 
treaties, and any action in this regard concerns him." 
  Flores explained that the matter is being discussed by the 
executive branch and will not be taken up by the legislative 
branch until the executive reaches a decision and informs 
Congress officially. He also said the correct term in this case 
is to reject [denunciar] the treaty -- an action that includes 
discussing possible disagreements and conveying any criticisms 
to the other nation. 
  Flores added: "The Armed Forces are part of the executive 
branch, and any idea must be discussed with the constitutional 
president and other branches such as the legislative branch." 
Asked whether the treaty is truly obsolete, as argued by Gen. 
Luis Alonso Discua, Flores replied that circumstances that 
prevailed years ago no longer exist. 
  Flores noted: "In the past decade, Central America was 
subject to different pressures, conflicts, and domestic 
problems. Governments outside the realm of de jure states, 
political disputes, and related situations no longer exist at 
this time, because all of the governments have been elected by 
popular vote." 
  He concluded: "The situation has changed radically."

  [Text] Foreign Minister Ernesto Paz Aguilar said yesterday 
that in light of the new global situation it is necessary to 
review the cooperation treaty Honduras and the United States 
signed in 1954 in order to redirect relations between the two 
allies. 
  He said: "We are in the post-Cold War period and priorities 
have changed. For this reason Honduras, through its legitimate 
authorities, must point out to the United States the new areas 
on which we must work." 
  These new areas, he said, are basically the struggle against 
drug trafficking and the control of illegal immigrants -- 
something that can be checked under the circumstances of free 
economies, employment opportunities, and democracies capable of 
guaranteeing the human rights of the Central American people. 
  He noted that, personally speaking, he has always struggled 
to keep Honduras from becoming the backyard of a superpower. 
"We said this in the 1980's, and we say it now in the 1990's," 
he explained. 
  For the first time, he affirmed, the interests of the United 
States and those of Honduras and the rest of Central America 
coincide because there is a new government in the North American 
country and it has a new foreign policy. 
  The minister added that Honduras is now a mature nation 
ready 
to engage in a new relationship with the United States, adding 
that it is also ready to decide whether there is any sense in 
today's world for Palmerola Air Base to remain a platform for 
military operations at the regional level. 
  "On the contrary," he said, "it is necessary to turn 
Palmerola into a regional center for fighting drug trafficking, 
something that would benefit the United States as well as our 
countries." 
  The civilian utilization of the airstrip, which was designed 
for military purposes, cannot be ruled out. Minister Paz 
Aguilar said, "The only thing we would have to do to turn 
Palmerola into an airport in the country's central region is to 
invest in construction of a terminal." 
  The minister said such changes must be based on new 
attitudes. "We have to discuss the problem of immigration, 
because the Honduran people have quotas restricting their entry 
into the United States, and Eastern European citizens are 
finding it easier than the Latin Americans to enter the United 
States." 
  In conclusion, Minister Paz said there is no specific date 
yet for reviewing the treaties because the new phase of 
relations with the United States is just beginning.

<F P=106> [Interview with Honduran Deputy Carlos Sosa Coello, member </F>
of the Congressional Commission on Drug Trafficking, by Raul 
Valladares in Tegucigalpa; from "The Morning Paper" 
newscast--live] 
  [Text] Valladares: Good morning, we are talking 
with Deputy Carlos Sosa Coello, a member of the Congressional 
Commission on Drug Trafficking. What can you tell the Honduran 
people when once again the country is mentioned in international 
news dispatches. This time, a former Colombian drug trafficker 
is saying that drug traffickers are protected in Honduras as 
well as in other countries. He also mentioned Mexico, Brazil, 
and the Dominican Republic. 
  Sosa: [Words indistinct] at some time some drug 
trafficker received some type of protection from some authority 
in Honduras. These types of people frequently appear at the 
[U.S.] Senate subcommittee headed by Senator John Kerry. 
Obviously, the more charges they make, the better it will go 
for them in the future. In 1989, we had a similar experience. 
We investigated the statement by a witness of Senator Kerry's 
subcommittee. He was a former Panamanian consul named Jose 
Blandon. On that occasion, the accusation dealt with the links 
of some Honduran military chiefs with former Panamanian dictator 
Noriega and drug trafficking. The accusation was investigated 
[words indistinct] I was able to testify and confirm to a 
Congressional commission chaired by Carlos Montoya that the trip 
of a Honduran military intelligence chief to Panama, during 
which he had some kind of verbal contact with General Noriega, 
was for the purpose of meeting with some leaders of the 
Farabundo Marti National Liberation Front, who at that time were 
in Panama because they did not have the legal status in their 
country that they now fortunately have. 
  Valladares: Who was accused? 
  Sosa: No [words indistinct] Honduran military 
intelligence, whose participation in these types of dealings was 
not confirmed. Therefore, I do not see why I should mention his 
name. I personally confirmed that the information was false 
because by chance I was the one who established contact with the 
late Guillermo Ungo so that this military intelligence chief 
would meet with him. Therefore, the trip to Panama and the link 
with Noriega had nothing to do with drug trafficking. It was a 
meeting with a Salvadoran guerrilla leader, which is what 
Guillermo Ungo was at that time. The U.S. Senate subcommittee 
and Attorney General's Office have the habit of making deals 
with drug traffickers, who know that the more statements they 
make, the more benefits they will obtain from the Attorney 
General's Office and the subcommittee. I am talking about this 
subcommittee. We experienced this situation with consul 
Blandon, who made these types of accusations. 
  The current accusation will have to be verified. I think 
[words indistinct], will have an opportunity to begin or 
continue investigations. The first thing will be to confirm 
whether [Colombian drug trafficker] Taboada, under his real name 
or alias, legally visited Honduras. Immigration documents will 
have to be checked for this. Contacts will also have to be made 
with the Senate subcommittee. I will consult with some of our 
U.S. friends to see to what extent these accusations involve 
Honduran authorities and at what level. 
  What we now have is the fact that our country was mentioned 
among others, such as Mexico, which in the latest State 
Department report have been recognized by the U.S. Government 
for their great efforts against drug trafficking. Now, in this 
testimony, it said that drug cartels are protected in Mexico. 
There have always been judges, police chiefs, and officials of 
attorney general's offices who at some time have been negligent 
or not done their duty and [words indistinct]. But I think the 
accusation must be investigated [words indistinct] is not the 
policy of the Honduran State, and no state organization protects 
drug cartels. This is an assertion by a witness at a U.S. 
Senate subcommittee. One does not know whether or not they are 
serious. I repeat that in the past we investigated these types 
of statements by witnesses at Senator Kerry's subcommittee, and 
we found them groundless. It was much ado about nothing.

  [Text] 
<H5>  Talk of Plot To Undermine MacMillan </H5>
  Investigation of police corruption is being undertaken in 
the 
face of growing suspicion of links with drug trafficking. 
  Police Commissioner Colonel Trevor MacMillan confirmed 
yesterday that the investigation is to be done by an "internal 
affairs division." 
  He could not confirm, however, reports of a plot to 
undermine 
his administration of the Force through links between renegade 
members of the Force and a leading cocaine dealer in the 
Corporate Area. 
  The recent spate of gangland murders (110 killings in the 
first 62 days of the year) is linked by police sources with the 
plot. 
  The plot is said to involve the cocaine dealer, who has 
powerful overseas connections and is assisted by some 
disgruntled policemen, as well as deportees who are allowed 
immediate membership in the gang as long as they bring their own 
guns. 
  Asked about the plot, Colonel MacMillan said, "I have no 
evidence of it but I would not be surprised because there are 
people in the force who are actively involved in the drug trade. 
We are developing strategies to deal with it but I am not 
prepared to comment further at this time, other than to say I 
have the Minister's total support." 
  MacMillan, determined to break the link between the police 
force and drug traffickers, is striving for hard evidence to 
establish that there is a link. 
<H5>  Fear </H5>
  Citizens are reportedly reluctant to come forward and give 
evidence for fear of reprisal from renegade cops. 
  Colonel MacMillan said yesterday, "recently a doctor brought 
a patient and the patient's mother to give us information about 
where the patient got hooked on cocaine, and police involvement 
with that location. Neither the patient nor mother was prepared 
to give a signed statement, attend an I.D. parade, or go to 
court." 
  He said this is the kind of thing that happens, making it 
difficult for the police to move from intelligence information 
to evidence. "For obvious reasons," he said, "people are 
reluctant to come forward. They fear for their personal safety." 
  In the meantime, those renegade officers are fighting back 
through the cocaine boss, whose men are reportedly behind many 
of the recent murders. Sources tell The Gleaner that 
60 to 70 police officers are involved in an islandwide cocaine 
network providing protection for crack houses, and escort 
services for the transportation of ganja, cocaine and crack. 
  "As a result of stated government policy," said the Police 
Commissioner "an internal affairs division has been set up to 
investigate the corruption of policemen."

  [Text] Torreon, Coahuila, 28 March--Federal Judicial Police 
(PJF) agents in Coahuila arrested two persons from whom they 
confiscated 4,187 kg of cocaine. It was being carried on a 
butane gas tank truck, which was intercepted at Km 54+56 of the 
Saltillo-Concepcion del Oro highway. The announcement was made 
today by that force's commander, Juan Carlos Alvarado. 
  He reported that the tank truck carrying the drugs was of 
the 
Tacsa make, bearing the initials HGS (Horacio Gonzalez Serna). 
  Arrested on the scene of the incident were Raul Juarez Paz, 
aged 37, and Miguel Angel Salazar Ramirez, 25, both natives of 
Uruapan, Michoacan. According to the officer they were left at 
the disposal of the authorities in the Federal Public 
Prosecutor's Office. 
  He noted that the tank truck was detected because it was 
being driven at excessive speed on the aforementioned route, 
prompting the agents to order it stopped, so as to search its 
interior. 
  He remarked that, while this action was being taken, the 
tank 
truck's occupants appeared nervous and, when its load was 
inspected, the drugs were found contained in 2,162 packages, 
distributed in 168 bags. 
  He added that, in their preliminary statements, those 
arrested claimed that the merchandise had been delivered to them 
in the city of Guadalajara, to be transferred to Cadereyta, 
Nuevo Leon. 
  According to the police chief, this cocaine shipment is the 
largest ever seized in Coahuila.

  [Text] The Office of the Attorney General of the Republic 
[PGR] announced as part of this year's priority strategic tasks 
for combating drugs the holding of a meeting of the Joint 
Standing Committee To Revise the Mexican-U.S. Cooperation 
Program for Drug Control. 
  The PGR also revealed that it will hold meetings and sign 
agreements and treaties with Guatemala, Belize, Costa Rica, 
Panama, Nicaragua, El Salvador, Chile, Peru, Germany, France, 
the United Kingdom, Russia, and South Africa pertaining to 
bilateral operations for fighting the drug traffic. 
  According to the institution, special attention is being 
given to cooperation with the Central American nations, since, 
in the Mexican Government's strategy, that region's geopolitical 
situation ranks it as a priority territory. It declared that the 
entry and passage of narcotics and psychotropic substances in 
that area must be prevented. 
  The office gave a reminder that last year Mexico's 
cooperation with Central America was part of our country's 
general plans for international cooperation, and it was guided 
by specific considerations of a geopolitical and strategic 
nature. 
  The PGR noted that Mexico's action for drug control with the 
nations of that region was aimed, in particular, at 
collaborating with the international counternarcotics effort, 
especially that intended to prevent the entry of narcotics or 
their passage to the northern part of the area. 
  To reinforce this action, legal advice has been offered for 
many years to prepare Articles of Agreement that would create 
the Central American Standing Committee for the Eradication of 
Production, Trafficking, Consumption, and Illicit Use of 
Narcotics and Psychotropic Substances. 
  Similarly, since July 1993, the Attorney General's Office 
has 
directed efforts toward intensifying and defining the methods 
for cooperation with the Central American nations, including 
bilateral action in the endeavors with the region as a whole. 
  The agency explained that, following the discoveries made on 
working visits paid to each of the Central American countries 
between July and August 1993, a document was prepared proposing 
Mexico's strategy for legal cooperation and joint drug control 
with Central America. 
  It stressed that, on this basis, interinstitutional 
consultations were held on a national scale, obtaining the 
support of the departments involved in the matter, including the 
Foreign Ministry. 
  As for the bilateral relations with the United States to 
combat drugs, the PGR proposed for this year a reinforcement of 
the negotiations on the extradition treaty. The aim is to leave 
the prohibition on border kidnappings explicitly established, 
and to reinforce this cooperation by placing emphasis on the 
common battle against organized crime and money laundering. It 
is intended to continue holding semiannual technical work 
sessions on the Mutual Legal Assistance Treaty, and to seek new 
means of cooperation to deal with the problems of violence on 
the border. Among other things, it is also planned to study the 
feasibility of obtaining a six-month permit for the Citation 
aircraft to overfly and land during their maintenance trips to 
the United States.

  [Text] Guadalajara, Jalisco, 30 March--Some 20 km southeast 
of Jilotlan de los Dolores, the Mexican Army destroyed a 
marijuana plantation on 10,000 square meters, containing an 
estimated 30,000 plants of the drug nearly ready for harvesting. 
The announcement was made today by Jesus Gutierrez Rebollo, 
commander of the 15th Military Zone. 
  He added that this action brings the number of marijuana 
plantations destroyed to 331, and of poppy crops eliminated to 
151; noting that, all told, they covered an area of 45 hectares. 
  In announcing the drug destruction, he stressed that it was 
being done as part of the permanent campaign against the drug 
traffic, which is in the special phase of "Regional Operation 
I-94," initiated on 10 March. 
  He reported that Mexican Army forces, during their tours 
through the sierra region, detected the plantation 20 km 
southeast of Jilotlan de los Dolores. It was situated on an area 
of 10 hectares, with a density of three plants per square meter, 
reaching a height of 1.9 meters. He indicated that they were 
almost ready for harvesting. 
  Immediately after giving the pertinent notice of the 
discovery to their headquarters, the forces engaged in the tour 
began destroying the marijuana. They uprooted all the plants 
manually, later placing them on the dryers and stacking them in 
other places. The officer noted that, after being soaked with 
diesel oil, the marijuana was ignited.

  [Text] Guadalajara, Jalisco, 30 March--Some 12,493 
psychotropic pills (the largest number in the local jail's 
history) were confiscated by guards at the state crime 
prevention prison. This announcement was made today by its head, 
Maricela Gomez Cobos. 
  According to the information furnished, the inmates Jaime 
Bugarain Barajas, Juan Gallegos Hernandez, Ricardo Gonzalez 
Almaraz, Felipe de Jesus Esparza Lopez, and Oscar Ortiz 
Gonzalez, confined in cell 77 of that jail's third dormitory, 
had concealed a box containing 12,493 pills of the Roche brand, 
each of two milligrams. They were being sold inside the prison 
for between 5,000 and 10,000 new pesos. 
  The drugs were placed at the disposal of the Federal Public 
Prosecutor's Office, and a new trial will be opened against the 
culpable inmates. All of them have been remanded for theft, 
assault, and crimes against health, according to the 
aforementioned prison authority, who described this as the 
largest confiscation in the institution's history.

  [Text] Veracruz, Ver., 3 April--Sinaloa, Chihuahua, and 
Durango States are the ones with the greatest incidence of 
marijuana and poppy growing; hence, "the operations conducted by 
the National Defense Secretariat in its battle against the drug 
traffic are being constantly reinforced." This statement was 
made today by the commander of the 13th Infantry Battalion 
Garrison, General Fernan Perez Casanova. 
  He explained that, for four months, from November to March, 
a 
contingent of 300 members of that battalion, headquartered in 
this port, backed the action to combat marijuana and poppy 
growing. 
  He added that, as a result, 2,073 marijuana plantations, 
covering an area of 2,128 square meters, were destroyed. He also 
reported the destruction of 5,109 poppy plantations covering 
5,446 square meters, and of another 2,907 kg of marijuana, as 
well as the incineration of 30 kg of the same grass already 
packed. 
  Moreover, he cited the incineration of 152.45 kg of 
marijuana 
seed, and 140.61 kg of poppy seed. 
  Perez Casanova remarked that, during these same operations, 
11 persons illegally carrying firearms for the exclusive use of 
the Mexican Army and Air Force were captured. He specified that 
seven long-range and 10 short-range weapons were seized in the 
activities. 
  In conclusion, he commented that, although the incidence of 
marijuana and poppy growing in Veracruz State is low, 
reconnaissance and inspection flights are nevertheless being 
made constantly to establish the sites for destructive 
operations when plantations of these drugs are detected.

  [Excerpts] Ciudad Victoria, Tamaulipas, 16 March--The 
Office of the Attorney General of the Republic [PGR] will 
implement new strategies in the country for the battle against 
the drug traffic. They include an increase in the number of 
highway checkpoints, with state and municipal police forces, as 
well as representatives of the civilian society, participating 
in them. This announcement was made here today by the office's 
head, Diego Valades. 
  The judicial authority visited this state to sign a 
coordination agreement, aimed at optimizing and intensifying the 
battle against the drug trade in Tamaulipas. On this occasion, 
in the presence of Governor Manuel Cavazos Lerma, he confirmed 
the fact that "the civilian society will participate extensively 
in the checkpoints." 
  He explained that this plan was suggested by the Tamaulipas 
governor, who proposed that he permit the cooperation of the 
state and municipal governments, as well as the civilian 
society, in the checkpoint activity, to prevent human rights 
violations. 
  He indicated that the third parties' role would be to ensure 
that the operations are intended to protect collective security, 
and are not an excuse for disturbing individuals or families 
when they are inspected on highways. [passage omitted] 
  He declared: "Mexico is setting an example of tenacity in 
the 
battle against drug trafficking that has earned it recognition 
from other Latin American nations and the United States." He 
added that this country "is an example, internationally, in 
fighting the drug trade, and as a result has achieved a 
reduction in that crime." 
  Valades Rios stressed that, in this state, "There is a great 
dedication to the battle for justice, which is vital for 
eradicating crime, particularly the organized type represented 
by drug dealers." 
  He went on to say that the drug traffic must be fought, and 
that "a better and more efficient systematic link between the 
Federation, states, municipalities, and the population itself is 
required. The effort must be the same on everyone's part, so as 
to achieve justice." [passage omitted] 
  During the next three months, another 500 agents will join 
the National Institute To Combat Drugs [INCD], raising their 
numbers to 1,300. The announcement was made by the agency's 
national commissioner, Raul Campos Rabago. 
  He added that the personnel would be trained specifically in 
fighting drugs, through the Training Institute run by the 
Attorney General's Office itself. 
  He noted: "We have 800 members but, within three months at 
the most, we shall take on at least 500 more to cope with the 
requirements generated by the battle against the drug traffic." 
The Institute has set up six regional offices throughout the 
country, but the target for the first phase is to attain 15, 
which should be operating this very year. 
  To date, the results of the battle against the drug trade 
have proven positive because, thus far this year, slightly over 
160,000 kg of cocaine have been seized: "an amount unprecedented 
in the nation's history." [passage omitted] 
  The official in charge of fighting drugs in the country 
explained that the institute is paying particular heed to states 
regarded as drug producers, such as Oaxaca, Michoacan, Jalisco, 
Sinaloa, Sonora, and Durango, among others. 
  Nevertheless, other states, such as Tamaulipas, which are 
serving as passageways for transporting drugs bound for the 
United States market from South America, have not been 
overlooked either.

  [Text] Veracruz, Ver., 16 March--The representative of the 
State Attorney's Office, Marco Antonio Gonzalez Baez Cardoso, 
announced that 810 kg and 600 grams of cocaine were seized in 
the municipality of Casitas, north of this city, where a 
presumed drug trafficker was captured. 
  He explained that Federal Judicial Police agents under 
orders 
from the force's deputy commissioner, Fernando Asiain Diaz 
Barriga, have spent several months investigating the possible 
drug dealing case. At 1400 today, they arrested Jose Luis Acosta 
Morales, as he was attempting to transport the drug in his 
pickup truck. 
  He noted that the cocaine was contained in 25 burlap bags, 
camouflaged in cardboard boxes labeled "Sandals and Playsuits." 
Acosta Morales was caught while leaving his residence in the 
Veracruz municipality of Casitas. He was attempting to board his 
panel type Dodge vehicle with license plates SA 38347, of 
Puebla, his native state. 
  Gonzalez Baez Cardoso added that the preliminary 
investigation for crimes against health has already been opened, 
and that Acosta Morales, with the drugs and the vehicle, have 
been sent to the state office's facilities located in this city. 
  The police official concluded by indicating that this 
shipment of 810 kg and 600 grams of cocaine had considerable 
market value, because each kg is worth between 30,000 and 40,000 
new pesos. Since these were drugs in a pure state, 6,000 doses 
could have been obtained from each kg.

  [Text] Ciudad Juarez, Chihuahua, 26 March--Drugs worth $4.5 
million were seized by the Federal Judicial Police (PJF) 
detailed to Chihuahua State, during a counternarcotics operation 
in which 1.5 tons of marijuana were intercepted, a warehouse was 
seized, and a presumed drug dealer was remanded for crimes 
against health in all their forms. This announcement was made 
here today by the PJF deputy commissioner, Javier Norona 
Guerrero. 
  He explained that, during the operation, headed by the 
force's commander in the zone, Armando Alarcon, and backed by a 
special group from the Office of the Attorney General of the 
Republic (PGR), 131 packages of the aforementioned drug were 
intercepted moments before they could be shipped to the United 
States. 
  Norona Guerrero added that the investigation conducted by 
the 
PGR personnel ended with the capture of Ramon Moreno Gomez, aged 
27. 
  Seven PJF agents participated in the operation, called 
"Lightning," backed by an agent from the Federal Public 
Prosecutor's Office, successfully intercepting the drugs. 
According to Eduardo Mancera, group chief of that police force, 
this dealt a severe blow to the international drug Mafias. 
  He noted that the PJF agents seized the drugs from a 1978 
Dodge pickup truck without license plates, as it was leaving a 
warehouse located in the Colonia Industrial, at 2379 Montevideo 
Street. The vehicle was confiscated by the PGR, which took it to 
that office's facilities in Ciudad Juarez. 
  He claimed that, if the marijuana had reached the United 
States, it would have supplied 200,000 addicts. 
  The subject under arrest and the drugs were placed at the 
disposal of the authorities.

  [Excerpts] Inasmuch as money laundering involves "billions 
of dollars" worldwide, the National Banking Commission [CNB] has 
sent bankers a guide for preventing this crime. It demands of 
them, among other things, effective policies for learning about 
their clients, identifying parties involved in transfers of 
large sums, exercising strict control over foreign currency 
transactions, and identifying "suspect" operations. 
  It reminded the heads of private banks that these funds are 
being laundered precisely to "conceal criminal or illegal 
activities," such as drug trafficking and tax evasion. 
  It claimed that this laundering is done to hide the real 
origin of the money, so that it may be used freely. Furthermore, 
"it operates as a support service, allowing criminals to enjoy 
the profits from their businesses." [passage omitted] 
  The CNB indicated that, in countries such as Mexico, 
"narcolaundering" may be practiced involuntarily by banks, 
because they offer a large variety of services and instruments, 
such as cashiers' and travelers' checks, and electronic 
transfers. These can be used to conceal funds accrued illegally. 
  In view of this situation, the CNB remarked, multiple 
banking 
institutions need to know how the money laundering systems 
operate, and how they can detect suspicious operations. This is 
necessary both to protect themselves and to continue cooperating 
with the efforts being expended by the pertinent authorities for 
prevention. 
  According to this public agency, the bank personnel can 
cooperate to a great extent with the government's efforts to 
avert this illicit practice. Of course, they will be obliged to 
meet the established reporting requirements "in a timely 
manner," and to adopt the guidelines stipulated in the pertinent 
legislation. 
  The CNB noted that, on the management level, bankers must 
cooperate in controlling and possibly solving the problem. 
Hence, it "suggested" that they devise programs to meet the 
following requirements: 
  To establish an internal monitoring system that will help to 
prevent money laundering. 
  To ensure suitable training for bank personnel. 
  The CNB explained that what is entailed is having a good 
bank 
management that will "maintain suitable levels of discretion" in 
its operations. This includes appropriate identification of 
persons doing business with credit departments, as well as 
demanding "professional, ethical" conduct on the part of bank 
employees and officials. 
  It observed that all this certainly entails strict 
cooperation with the judicial authorities, "within the bounds 
established by the applicable laws." 
  This institution indicated that, in order to become fully 
acquainted with clients, there must be a proper identification 
of depositors and other users of bank services. At the same 
time, measures must be devised for promptly detecting unusual or 
suspicious operations. 
  In fact, financial brokerage institutions will have to spot 
laundering activities and prevent them from being carried out 
through transfers. If they cannot do so for reasons associated 
with computerized systems, the National Banking Commission 
recommends that the following be included in all payment orders: 
a) name, domicile, and number of the person seeking the payment 
order; b) the same information, but on the beneficiary's 
account; c) identification of the first bank that accepts such a 
payment order. 
  Private banking agencies will be required to prepare reports 
on transactions in foreign currency made by, or in the name of 
particular clients, "especially when they involve large sums," 
in the form of individual or combined transactions. 
  The official institution pointed out that, nevertheless, an 
operation involving a large sum in cash does not necessarily 
imply that illicit activities or foreign exchange contraband are 
being committed. The banks must take into account the amount, 
frequency, and nature of the transaction, "as well as the bank's 
previous experience with the persons involved, whether they be 
employees or clients." 
  In this connection, the CNB explained that there are 
activities that could be suspected of laundering motives, such 
as those carried out with "large sums" in cash, "deceptive" 
transactions, the deposit or withdrawal of large amounts of 
funds through electronic transfers; and, of course, teller 
transactions involving considerable sums. 
  The National Banking Commission recommended that financial 
institutions concern themselves with workers employed in banks 
whose life style "is not in keeping with their salary," those 
who "refuse to take vacations," and, of course, those linked 
with sizable shortages of bank funds. 
  The members of credit institutions of any kind should 
reinforce their connections with other banks, paying special 
heed to "significant" changes in the normal pattern of 
transmitting foreign currency among agencies. 
  The CNB stated that, when there are increases in the amounts 
of cash handled, without a commensurate rise in the number of 
operations, the banks will have to be particularly alert. 
  Finally, the National Banking Commission instructed bankers 
to be very watchful of deposits made in the Central Bank "in 
amounts that differ from those maintained in the other banks," 
or deposits made by those employed in other institutions of 
similar size. And they must definitely suspect receipts showing 
increases in the use of bills of small denominations, with no 
indication of a decline in those of large denominations.

  [Text] Monterrey, Nuevo Leon, 20 March--The PGR's [Office 
of the Attorney General of the Republic] local representative, 
Roberto Soltero Acuna, announced today that federal agents 
seized $110,000 from two presumed drug traffickers as they were 
negotiating the sale of 50 kg of cocaine. He reported the arrest 
of Reynaldo Gumaro Garcia and Eliseo Hernandez Guerra in the 
Cola de Caballo tourist area, where both had gone, apparently to 
close a deal. 
  Based on the investigation, Gumario Garcia, who had the 
money 
in his possession, in packets of $5,000 bills, arrived on that 
site in a vehicle with Texas license plates; while his contact, 
Hernandez Guerra, came in a white pickup truck. 
  When the agents noticed their meeting, they started 
questioning the two subjects, who appeared nervous. Therefore, 
they were subjected to a thorough search, resulting in the 
discovery of the money. 
  One of them confessed that, last February, he had brought 
$280,000 into the country, a sum also resulting from drug sales. 
He claimed to have been engaged in carrying money from the 
United States to Mexico, and vice versa, hired by a man known to 
him only as Gerardo Torres. 
  As for Hernandez Guerra, the police chief said that he was 
placed at the disposal of the Federal Public Prosecutor's Office 
to make his statement.

newscast] 
  [Text] The Foreign Ministry is waiting for the U.S. reply 
to the protest note it has sent in connection with the charges 
money is being laundered in Panama. 
  Foreign Minister Jose Raul Mulino has said a protest note 
was 
sent due to the U.S. charges the Panamanian Government has links 
with drug traffickers. He has said although the note was sent 
last week, there has still been no reply, but he excused the 
United States by saying it is possible the letter is being 
studied. 
  [Begin Mulino recording] As I have said many times, I have 
not said no crimes are committed. An economy such as ours, due 
to the openness with which the service and banking sectors are 
handled, could well be used for criminal acts. What I cannot 
accept is to say the authorities are behind this. 
  In the cases where crimes have been detected, we have taken 
action according to the law. If there are other cases about 
which someone knows or if some government has information a 
certain bank might be involved, it is their duty to report this 
at the highest level--like, check this out; this is what is 
happening; correct it. Briefly, this is what the note I have 
sent the United States says. [end recording] 
  Mulino expressed his desire to hold a meeting in Panama, 
which he requested in the note, to speak broadly about the topic 
and at the highest level.

<F P=106> [Report by Jose Otero and Vilma Figueroa] </F>
  [Text] Foreign Minister Jose Raul Mulino has described as 
"unfortunate" U.S. Senator John Kerry's recent statements 
harshly criticizing the Panamanian Government's lack of 
cooperation with the United States in curbing drug trafficking. 
  Kerry, a Democratic senator from the state of Massachusetts 
and chairman of the U.S. Senate's hearings on terrorism, 
narcotics, and international crime, stated last Saturday that 
although "organized" crime prevailed in Panama during the regime 
of former General Manuel Antonio Noriega, "disorganized" crime 
now persists under the Guillermo Endara administration. 
  Mulino, who recently traveled to the Vatican and Russia on 
diplomatic visits, pointed out to Radio KW Continente that he 
believes Kerry's statements are "unfortunate" and that they 
should not be interpreted as originating from the U.S. 
Government. The foreign minister also stressed that the U.S. 
senator's statements "have not been very prudent." 
  Mulino explained: "The entire world is aware of the efforts 
we have made, despite our government's economic and human 
resource limitations, to straighten out what Noriega left us in 
1989 after being deposed by the U.S. invasion." 
  On the other hand, the foreign minister also referred to 
statements by Robert Gelbard, deputy assistant secretary of 
state for inter-American affairs [title as published], who 
acknowledged Panama's efforts against drug trafficking and the 
importance of a high-level meeting between the two nations to 
discuss the issue, as proposed by Panama. 
  Meanwhile, legislator Leo Gonzalez admitted Panama has not 
done enough about the problem of money laundering via 
corporations, and this is where the focus of all U.S. Government 
complaints lies. According to Gonzalez, the struggle against 
drug trafficking has been tremendous, but the government has 
fallen short in combating money laundering, which is the one 
activity that ensures the drug traffickers' survival.

<F P=106> [Report by Victor de la Hoz from the "RPC News" newscast] </F>
  [Text] International media reports coming from Spain have 
linked Panamanian Deputy Foreign Minister Carlos Cordero to 
several ghost companies which are being investigated by the 
Spanish Government as part of the properties owned by the 
wealthy businessman Mariano Rubio. According to this 
information, Cordero has ties with several private firms 
allegedly used to launder money. 
  However, Panamanian Foreign Minister Jose Raul Mulino 
pointed 
out that those reports are all intended to tarnish the 
Panamanian Government's image. Mulino made those statements at 
a posthumous ceremony honoring former Foreign Minister Julio 
Linares. 
  [Begin Mulino recording] I am sure the report is politically 
motivated and is attempting to damage the government's image 
internally. What they are doing with utter irresponsibility, 
however, is harming our country. The Spanish magazine does not 
highlight anything specific on the deputy foreign minister. It 
only mentions his firm superficially. The problem is a 
different one in Spain. [end recording] 
  Foreign Minister Mulino said Deputy Foreign Minister Carlos 
Cordero will clarify this information in due time.

<F P=106> [Interview with General Walter Taboada Milla, head of the </F>
National Counternarcotics Division, by David Montoya; place and 
date not given] 
  [Text]The political violence has more than one link 
with the drug traffic. In this edition, we begin publishing a 
bimonthly supplement on this topic. David Montoya, of the 
Special Report team, was able to interview the chief of the 
DINANDRO [National Counternarcotics Division], General Walter 
Taboada Milla. The National Police's DINANDRO has been operating 
since 1 January 1992, the date of the merger of the two 
divisions of the PIP [Peruvian Investigative Police] and Civil 
Guard that had been responsible for that task. The merger into a 
single division made it possible to reinforce the police work on 
what is known as interdiction. Now, there is more national 
information on the problem, available more rapidly. The 
DINANDRO's mission combines intelligence and interdiction 
activities, and simultaneous coordination with the Armed Forces 
throughout the country. 
  [Montoya] Starting with the topic of the "Vaticano" case, is 
it true that some artists had to be arrested to create a 
smokescreen in the country? Did they really have to be arrested 
based on "orders from above," without evidence? 
  [Taboada] It was called an order from above, referring to 
their superiors in the chain of command. So, there was no agency 
apart from the police that ordered the detention of those 
persons. 
  [Montoya] But there was no apparent evidence for detaining 
them, was there? 
  [Taboada] Then why didn't they complain; why didn't they 
file 
a suit for habeas corpus? We detained them to investigate the 
specific case involving the financial aspect, because there was 
a series of contradictions. (Later, one of those detained sued 
the interior minister.) 
  [Montoya] And in the case of Demetrio Chavez Penaherrera, 
did 
you succeed in proving the drug trafficking charges? 
  [Taboada] Within 12 days, we collected sufficient evidence 
to 
sentence him for a great many years. By his own admission, he 
was a drug trafficker from 1979 until 1991. 
  [Montoya] But "Vaticano" apparently is going to be sentenced 
to life imprisonment for his connection with subversion, rather 
than for drug trafficking. 
  [Taboada] That is a complementary charge. 
  [Montoya] Many people wonder how the Campanilla Army Base 
could have failed to discover "Vaticano's" illicit activities, 
and how he managed to create his empire almost before their 
eyes. What is your opinion of this? 
  [Taboada] We have been totally dedicated to seeking evidence 
against this individual, and we couldn't go any further in two 
weeks. The trial judge has paved the way for continuing the 
investigation and for going as far as necessary. 
  But "Vaticano" didn't start out in Campanilla; he began much 
sooner, selling by the kilo at first. Later, by 1989 in Uchiza, 
he was already owner of the "firm," which he called "Loco 
Limonier." Then he moved to Campanilla. He's a clever man, 
despite the fact that he has only primary schooling. There, with 
the entire population's support and the local authorities' 
approval, he managed to renovate the marginal highway, spending 
$300,000, and even installing electrical utilities. As this drug 
trafficker has mentioned, there were no Army personnel there at 
that time; they arrived later. 
  [Montoya] How much was "Vaticano" moving as regular 
shipments? 
  [Taboada] "Vaticano" claimed that it was more profitable for 
him to lease the landing strip than to engage in collecting and 
shipping drugs. He was leasing his landing strip for $15,000 per 
flight, and it is his claim that there were about 20 to 25 
flights per month. 
  [Montoya] Drug dealing is a financial activity that can 
corrupt people. Have there been any cases of this kind in the 
directorate that you head? 
  [Taboada] As human beings, we sometimes make mistakes, and 
it 
is due to such a mistake that I am there (in the DINANDRO). You 
may recall the case of the son of the drug trafficker, "Mosco 
Loca," who was released. Those responsible were a colonel, a 
commander, and a captain. For that reason, there was a series of 
transfers of officials who had been working together for over 
two years. During my administration no cases have appeared, and 
I have been there for six months. 
  [Montoya] We are witnessing a drop in the price of PBC, and 
there is much talk about the international drug traffic's 
potential opportunity with poppies. How has the DINANDRO been 
monitoring this product, the base for heroin? 
  [Taboada] There has been considerable talk of poppies. A 
television channel showed poppies in the San Martin zone 
bordering Moyobamba and Rodriguez de Mendoza Provinces. We 
reached the site that had been identified as a growing zone and, 
according to the video that we have, it is a poppy variety that 
is useless for extracting gum or latex (components for heroin). 
To give an idea, the capsule, or bud, must be pear-shaped, and 
the one that they showed was small, resembling a peanut with a 
shell, on which incisions could not be made to extract the gum. 
  We have checked other areas, in northern Moyobamba, north of 
Rioja, where the same type exists; and we reached Jaen, with the 
same results. 
  [Montoya] What is the drug traffic's future? 
  [Taboada] We are progressing well. We have been outfitting a 
coordinating office to monitor the components of basic paste. 
The Ministry of Industry, the DINANDRO, the Public Prosecutor's 
Office, and the Sunat [National Tax Administration 
Superintendency] have been integrated into this office. We are 
also connected to terminals that have sufficient range for 
monitoring producers, importers, exporters, warehouses, 
carriers, sellers, and resellers. In other words, the monitoring 
reaches 80 percent and, when this outfitting is completed, we'll 
achieve 100 percent. 
  [Montoya] Is the drug traffic currently a priority for the 
National Police of Peru? 
  [Taboada] In fact, since last year, since September if I'm 
not mistaken, we have begun attaching greater importance to the 
interdiction of the drug traffic. You must have heard through 
the news media that the DINCOTE's [National Counterterrorism 
Directorate] personnel are going to be reduced. What will be 
reinforced is the DINANDRO's activity, in order to achieve 
greater success. 
  [Montoya] Minister Briones has stated that, in 1994, he 
expects the DINANDRO to become an office with success similar to 
that of the DINCOTE. Do you all feel identified with this kind 
of expectation on the part of your superior chiefs? 
  [Taboada] It is not merely an expectation or desire that is 
involved, but also logistical support. They are backing us so as 
to convert us, this year, into the police unit that will accrue 
outstanding success. 
  [Montoya] Does this apply to your personnel's income and 
bonuses, as well? 
  [Taboada] A system is being introduced whereby we give 
bonuses to the personnel, but according to the number of 
seizures, and not daily or monthly. 
<H5>  PBC Prices Falling: Drug Traffic Reorganizing in Peru? </H5>
  In the case of Peru, the price of washed PBC, the principal 
illegal export product, has virtually plummeted during the 
1990's. At first glance, this would appear to affect the 
influence of cash flow from this activity on the Peruvian 
economy. Nevertheless, at the same time, the drop in basic paste 
prices could be one of the leading economic factors in the 
expansion of coca crops on nearly all of the Peruvian jungle 
border. However, it is also an incentive for growing other 
crops, such as poppies, which are still incipient in Peru. 
  One possibility is that a period of reorganizing this 
illegal 
activity is beginning, wherein coca derivatives will continue to 
be the main product, but with an outcome not yet possible to 
predict. It is likely that this downward price trend will 
continue. However, it is also important that an impetus be given 
to the alternative development projects, as a centerpiece of the 
antidrug plans.

<F P=106> [Article by Ria Taitt] </F>
  [Text]Nation Security Minister Russell Huggins has 
estimated the annual value of the illegal drug trade at "well 
over one billion dollars." 
  Huggins was speaking at a news conference in the Parliament 
Committee Room yesterday just prior to yesterday's sitting of 
the Senate. The media conference was called to answer 
journalists' queries arising from the Bill to amend the 
Dangerous Drugs Act. 
  Huggins said the proposed amendments would allow Trinidad 
and 
Tobago to ratify the Vienna Convention. This, he added, would 
give this country greater access to funding for the fight 
against the drug trade from donor countries such as the United 
States, the Netherlands, Germany and France. 
  He said the passage of this legislation signals to the 
international community that "we are serious." 
  Huggins said one of the more important features of the Bill 
was its provisions relating to money-laundering, which, he said, 
could destroy the financial system of a country. 
  "One has to understand dealings in drugs take place in cash. 
So you have a lot of cash to clean. Cash can be cleaned by 
buying a boat from someone for $90,000. You pay in cash and then 
you sell it back for $80,000. You are prepared to take the 
$10,000 loss because you now have $80,000 certified (clean) 
money." 
  He cited the U.S. as an example of a case where there has 
been a proliferation of jewelry stores and "when you go down 
inside them they don't have a piece of jewelry; they are simply 
being used as fronts." 
  He said that in Trinidad and Tobago drug lords had used the 
importation of potatoes as a laundering device. 
  He said laundering could occur in any establishment: "Where 
you had the import of used cars, that is another method of doing 
it. 
  You bring down cars and you pay more for them and sell them 
for less. That is one of the ways in which it is done. Another 
way is to buy up postal orders every month." 
  Huggins said one of the biggest busts in the U.S., "US $6 
billion in cash," had been organised in this way. "A massive 
laundering operation which took four years to bust and with all 
the resources they have. 
  I mention this simply to let you know that you shouldn't 
look for miracles from our people. We are trying to put a unit 
together and are having some hiccups with the Organised Crime 
and Narcotics Unit." 
  But he stressed that there were dedicated people working on 
it, adding that it took time to really bust a drug operation. 
"Time and a lot of ground work. A drug lord does not bring you 
into his trust overnight," he said. 
  "He said between November 1993 and this year, the Trinidad 
and Tobago authorities had participated in the seizure of 200 
kilos of cocaine shipped from Trinidad. The intelligence given 
for its seizure came from here," he said. 
  Stressing that in order to hurt the drug-trafficker one had 
to deal with money-laundering, Huggins pointed to some of the 
shortcomings of the original legislation, which, he said, did 
not go far enough. 
  Before now, he said, it was not an offence for a 
drug-trafficker to launder his own proceeds, though it was an 
offence for someone to help him. 
  Huggins said the proposed legislation, apart from addressing 
this, would also limit the number of places where the 
drug-trafficker could hide his assets because the Bill allowed 
for the recognition and enforcement. 
  The Bill was passed unanimously at 9:45 p.m.

  [Text] A teenager was among three British tourists who 
appeared before an Arima magistrate yesterday charged with 
possession of liquid cocaine for the purpose of trafficking and 
attempting to export the drug. 
  Steven Peterkin, 31, of Sand Rock Road, London; Sharon 
Mitchell, 27, of Batterson, London; and Nathalie Simmons, 18, of 
New Cross, London, were held by members of the Organised Crime 
and Narcotics Unit at Piarco Airport on Friday shortly before 
they boarded BWIA flight for London. 
  According to court prosecutor Sgt Paul Glodon, Peterkin had 
4.35 kilos of the drug in his luggage while Mitchell had 2.3 
kilos and Simmons 150 grammes of cocaine hidden in their luggage. 
  Peterkin pleaded guilty to the charge of attempting to 
export 
the drug while the other two accused pleaded not guilty. 
  Magistrate Trevor Peters, presiding in the Arima First 
Magistrate's Court, denied the three Londoners bail. They will 
re-appear on March 3.

<H5>  Concern Over Secret Societies </H5>
  An article in the latest issue of ZHONGHUA WENZHAI (CHINA 
DIGEST) revealed that the Central Commission on Politics and Law 
paid special attention to the activities of secret societies in 
China and took them as one of the 10 major targets of the 
anticrime action. The Ministry of State Security also took 
organized crime as a highly dangerous phenomenon to be brought 
under strict supervision and control. The ministry has launched 
three major campaigns against secret societies: From Shaoyang in 
the south, to Harbin in the north, and to Lintong in the west. 
The article, entitled "Are There Mafias in China?" revealed that 
hundreds of criminal gangs often fought each other openly in the 
streets of Shaoyang, western Hunan. The 1991 anticrime campaign 
solved 4,041 cases, including 1,096 major ones; eliminated 801 
criminal gangs; and arrested 6,175 gangsters, including 1,299 
backbone members of the gangs in Shaoyang. The crime syndicates 
in Harbin operated as business enterprises, controlling the 
construction market in the city. The article also revealed that 
crime syndicates in China were involved in international 
criminal activities, such as drug trafficking and 
counterfeiting. [Summary] [Beijing ZHONGGUO XINWEN SHE in

  [Summary] On 11 March, the Jinan Railway Transport 
Intermediate Court publicly sentenced 21 members of a 
drug-smuggling ring to death, life imprisonment, or set terms of 
imprisonment. The gang was engaged in the cultivation, 
processing, and trafficking of drugs, and over 110 persons were 
involved in the case. On 6 October 1991, police at the Xuzhou 
railway station arrested Xue Xibin [5641 0823 2430], a factory 
worker in Donghai County, carrying 350 g of opium. This led to 
a two-year investigation by a special task force set up by the 
Jinan Railway Public Security Bureau and the Xuzhou Railway 
Public Security Office. The investigation revealed that since 
May 1990, Xue, his partners Wang Ping [3769 1627] and Liu Sicang 
[0491 1835 0221] (both also from Donghai county), and others had 
been engaged in opium trafficking using the rail system, selling 
a total of 20,075.5 g in Henan and other areas. With the 
approval of the Supreme People's Court, Xue, Wang, and Liu were 
sentenced to death. Two gang members received the death penalty 
with a suspended sentence, while 16 others received either life 
imprisonment or sentences ranging from two to 15 years.

<F P=106> [By Darren Goodsir] </F>
  [Text] Police have seized more high-grade heroin in the 
past three months than the total amount seized in 1993, causing 
wholesale drug prices to climb slightly for the first time in 
six months. 
  The Narcotics Bureau says the local drug market is now 
choked 
with heroin that is about 35 percent pure. Last month alone, 
police confiscated 128 kilograms of the drug. The total amount 
for 1993 was 223 kilograms. 
  The increase was indicative of a continuing flood of heroin 
into the territory and more intensive police operations. Last 
month, police recovered 96 blocks of heroin worth $50 million 
from the seabed near Lamma Island. The 67-kilogram haul was the 
biggest for two years. Despite a month-long nautical 
surveillance operation no arrests have been made. 
  In early March, 33 kilograms of heroin were discovered in a 
hut at Yuen Long. 
  There has also been an increase in the prevalence of the 
drug 
"ice," a synthetic crystalline methamphetamine. 
  So far this year, 22 kilograms of "ice" has been seized, 
more 
than the total taken by police in the past two years. Last 
year, drug-related arrests rose by 44 percent to 9,246. Deaths 
linked to the abuse of narcotics jumped by 34 percent to 92. 
  Narcotics Bureau chief staff officer, Acting Chief 
Superintendent Iain Grant, said the extra drugs seized did not 
give police any reason for complacency. "Obviously, if one 
measures success by seizures and arrests, then we can say both 
figures are up," Mr Grant said. "But the other side is that 
there appear to be more drugs on the streets. There is always 
an element of luck in getting these results but a lot of it 
boils down to good, old-fashioned police work." 
  Mr Grant said police intelligence suggested Hong Kong was no 
longer as popular a transit centre for drug deals but many 
transactions were still locally brokered or financed. He said 
he was particularly pleased with recent police efforts to 
destroy drug-cutting centres where pure heroin is diluted for 
extra profits and ease of consumption by addicts. In 1993, 30 
such facilities were located and shut down. This year seven 
have been identified.

<F P=106> [Title: International Drug Trafficking More Rampant--Sharp </F>
Rise Noted in Foreign Requests for Anti-Drug Cooperation--300 
Such Requests Received Last Year, 50 Percent More Than 1992"] 
  [Text] According to the police, using Hong Kong as a 
connection spot for international drug trafficking has become 
the trend. Compared with 1992, last year saw a lot more requests 
received from foreign law enforcement authorities for assistance 
in investigating international drug trafficking activities. 
  The Drug Investigation Department of the police last year 
received some 330 such requests from foreign law enforcement 
authorities, up 50 percent from the 1992 records. According to 
an official of this department, the continuous increase in such 
requests in recent years is due to the fact that drug 
traffickers are using Hong Kong as a connection spot for their 
activities and as a place for money laundering. Meanwhile, the 
route of drug trafficking has also changed in recent years. 
Because of Hong Kong's effective anti-drug work, there are less 
traffickers using Hong Kong as a transshipment point. Instead, 
most drugs are now going directly from the Golden Triangle to 
their destinations, primarily European and American countries. 
  Currently, Hong Kong has signed bilateral agreements with 11 
countries on cooperation in investigating transnational drug 
trafficking and money laundering. The agreements also cover the 
exchange of suspects arrested in each other's side. Over the 
past four years, Hong Kong has repatriated close to 100 suspects 
to their original countries for trial. 
  The Drug Investigation Department of the police says that 
all 
transnational drug trafficking groups are characterized by a 
strong organizational power, adding that it will beef up 
cooperation with foreign countries in expanding the 
informational network so as to deal blows at international drug 
trafficking.

<F P=106> [Title: "Customs Detain Two Men, One Woman--$1.6 Million </F>
Worth of Drug Seized; Processing Shop Discovered in Suspect's 
Residence"] 
  [Text] Officers of the Customs Narcotics Investigation 
Bureau yesterday checked two men at a parking lot in the 
Causeway Bay area and seized 2.1 kilograms of high-purity No. 4 
heroin in a car. Its current value is estimated at more than 
1.65 million Hong Kong dollars. 
  Based on the tip received, the customs officials at 5 p.m. 
yesterday secretly watched a suspicious car at a public parking 
lot in Huang Shih Pao [4106 1358 1027] on Chi Li Tso Chih [6068 
0448 0146 3112] Street of the Causeway Bay area. Shortly 
afterward, two men came to pick up the car. When they were ready 
to drive away, the customs officers stopped them and began a 
search. As a result, 2.1 kilograms of high-purity No. 4 heroin 
were found in the car. The two men were arrested and taken to 
the Customs Narcotics Investigation Bureau for examination. 
  One of the arrested, 25, is named Chen. He alleged that he 
is 
the owner of a transportation company. The other is named Hsu, 
24, and is a hair stylist according to himself. Last night, 
customs officers escorted the two suspects to their residences, 
on Lai Che Kok Road and on Shan Tung Road, Wang Guo, 
respectively, to conduct further searches. It turned out that 
the residence on Lai Che Kok Road is a drug diluting and 
packaging shop. An additional 0.3 kilograms of heroin was found 
on the spot, where a 26-year-old woman was also arrested. 
According to examination, the three arrested suspects are drug 
trafficking partners, and their case has been put on file for 
prosecution. They will be tried at the Eastern District Court 
this morning.

<F P=106> [Title: "Anti-Drug Police Raid Boatmen Camps--Surrounded by </F>
Dozens of Vietnames Refugees--Police Reinforcements Arrive, 
Seize HK$1.6 Million Worth of Heroin"] 
  [Text] Yesterday evening when members of the Special 
Service Team of the Tuen Mun Police Headquarters went to the 
Wang Hou Shih [2598 0683 4258] refugee camp area to carry out 
its anti-drug mission, they were obstructed and surrounded by 
about 40 Vietnamese men, some wielding self-made weapons. The 
special team members called back to headquarters for support. 
Soon a large number of police arrived and took the situation 
under control. In a unit of Camp No. 33, the police seized eight 
kilograms of a drug, suspected to be No. 4 heroin, with an 
estimated value of 1.6 million Hong Kong dollars. No one was 
arrested. This is the largest amount of drugs the police has 
seized recently in the Vietnamese refugee camps. 
  According to an initial investigation made by the police, 
the 
above location is a drug dilution and distribution center. The 
drug comes from Sham Shui Po District, and is sold mainly to 
addicts among the refugees in the camp area. 
  The police investigation also reveals that the suspects 
belong to an active Vietnamese drug trafficking group in Hong 
Kong. Currently, the police are searching for the suspects based 
on the information provided by the refugees. In the past drug 
traffickers used to conduct small transactions, each with a 
small amount. The recent large dealings might be an indication 
that the number of addicts in the camp area has increased to 
such an extent that small supplies can no longer meet their 
requirements. Accordingly, the traffickers have taken risks to 
carry out large transactions. The police are making in-depth 
investigations to determine if this is the case. 
  The Wang Hou Shih refugee camp area where the drugs were 
seized is an open camp area. All the Vietnamese living there 
have undergone screening before being granted the refugee 
status. They have been assigned to settle there and are free to 
go in and out. Security administration in the area is rather 
lax. The camp leader is responsible for maintaining the area's 
public order. Guards are placed at the gate. 
  The Special Service Team of the Tuen Mun Police Headquarters 
kept a constant watch on the security situation in the Wang Hou 
Shih refugee camp area. Investigations revealed drug trafficking 
activities in the camps. Several searches were conducted in the 
past, but without marked results. 
  About a month ago, the Special Service Team received a tip 
to 
the effect that drug trafficking had escalated in this camp 
area. According to the tip, a considerable amount of drugs were 
stored in this area, and a drug dilution and distribution center 
had been set up there. Upon receipt of this information, Chief 
Inspector Tsai Chia-shih, Inspector Li Wei-chuan, and Captain 
Chang Wen-sheng decided to lead the policemen to investigate the 
case. 
  Recently, the team was prepared to take action and obtained 
a 
search warrant from the court. At 5 p.m. yesterday it began 
making final arrangements for a raid on the camp area. At 7 p.m. 
the team arrived in the area. When Inspector Mai Wei-chuan [name 
as printed] and Captain Chang Wen-sheng led policeman Lo Ssu-min 
and three other policemen and two policewomen to proceed to a 
unit of Camp No. 33, several refugees were playing cards at a 
nearby store. Thinking that the police had come to arrest 
gamblers, they tried to escape. This alerted the Vietnamese man 
who was keeping watch for the drug trafficking group. Suddenly, 
the police were obstructed and surrounded by a group of about 40 
Vietnamese, some of whom threatened with homemade weapons. 
Fearing that the situation would become chaotic, the police 
asked their headquarters for support. Shortly afterward, a large 
number of police arrived. They dispersed the rioting Vietnamese 
and proceeded with the search. They tried to enter a unit, but 
the door was closed. They knocked at the door, but nobody 
answered. After telling the camp's responsible person of their 
mission, the police broke the door with a steel bar. No one was 
inside. The police found some suspicious materials in the 
kitchen and the living room, including some granulars contained 
in a dried milk can and two bags of blocks in a blue plastic 
bucket. It was suspected that the granulars were a dilute form 
of drug and the blocks were high-purity No. 4 heroin. Also found 
were tools for diluting drugs, including blenders and packaging 
tools. 
  Since the TV and kitchen range in the unit were still on, it 
was believed that the drug traffickers had escaped barely before 
the police broke in. Presently, the police are searching for 
suspects. The seized drugs, totaling eight kilograms, are valued 
at about $1.6 million.

  [Text] Akita, April 19 KYODO -- Police said Tuesday [19 
April] they have arrested two Iranians on suspicion of receiving 
opium in parcels mailed from Russia, the first time Russia has 
been implicated as part of an opium drug route into Japan. 
  Police said they seized some 2 kilograms of the drug with a 
street value of about 16 million yen when they arrested Saeid 
Molaei Kineh Varsi, 25, and Karimi Davoud, 26, both living in 
Gunma Prefecture. 
  Police said the two are suspected of conspiring to receive a 
parcel containing heroin sent from Moscow to the Central Post 
Office in Akita in northern Japan last Wednesday. 
  Mail to Akita normally passes through Tokyo and police said 
it was at that point the heroin was discovered during a customs 
investigation.

  [Text] One of the three policemen arrested for alleged 
involvement in drug trafficking is the leader of the network 
here of the 14-K drug syndicate, a Manila police officer said 
yesterday. 
  Senior Inspector Lucio Margallo IV, chief of the Manila 
Police Narcotics Division, said SP04 Bonifacio Sangalang, one of 
the three arrested policemen, is "the biggest distributor of 
drugs in Manila." 
  He said Sangalang's group has connections with the 14-K gang 
of Taiwan and the Yakuza gang based in Japan. 
  Sangalang was arrested Wednesday night in front of his house 
in Taytay, Rizal. Sangalang, who had tried to flee, was 
carrying P1.5 million [Philippine pesos] worth of valuables and 
at least P2 million in cash. 
  Also arrested for their alleged involvement in the drug ring 
were SP01 Victor Garcia and Inspector Guillermo Villacorta. 
  Senior Supt. Hermogenes Ebdane, Manila police chief, said 
the 
three will be charged with conspiracy in the importation of 
prohibited drugs. 
  The police are also preparing administrative charges which 
could lead to the policemen's dismissal from the service. 
  Their arrest came after the police Wednesday launched 
"Operation Japayuki" and confiscated 15 kilos of hashish, worth 
about P6 million. 
  The operation started with the confiscation of the drugs at 
Pier 5 of the South Harbor, Manila where the ship carrying the 
goods, the MV Eastern Polaris, was docked. 
  The drug confiscated by the police was reported to have come 
from Japan. 
  Meanwhile, the police tagged two foreigners--a certain S.P. 
Kam of Taiwan and Itchiro Hanada of Japan--as the foreign 
contact persons of the international drug ring. The two, who 
are said to be in the country, are now the subject of a police 
manhunt. 
  The police said the drug taken from the group was hashish or 
"concentrated sativa." 
  Concentrated sativa, believed to be 10 times stronger than 
marijuana, is made up of resin extracted from the flower 
clusters and top leaves of the hemp plant cannabis sativa.

  [Text] Madhubani, 15 April. The districts of Bihar 
bordering Nepal appear to have become the major hunting ground 
for the Pakistan's Inter-Services Intelligence (ISI), which has 
stepped up its activities in the region in the recent past in a 
bid to create dissension in India. 
  Indications suggest that the ISI which has been running 
armed 
training centres and well-managed bases in Bangladesh and Nepal 
respectively, has infiltrated into these districts and begun its 
exercise to lure target groups as a part of its long-term 
strategy to fan subversive activities in the State. 
  Sources said Nepal, which has about a half a dozen ISI 
bases, 
provides a "free conduit" to the agents to enter the Indian 
territory due to relaxed border regulations. The Himalayan 
territory, the sources said, has of late become the main dumping 
ground of drugs brought from Pakistan by the ISI. The money 
earned through drug trafficking is converted into white money by 
the Pakistani banks operating in Nepal and then transferred to 
the names of charitable institutions or individuals operating in 
the garb of social service. 
  In Madhubani district alone there are certain pockets having 
considerable Muslim population where money flow to an average 
family has witnessed unprecedented rise during the past couple 
of years. Although some of the families have their members 
employed in the Gulf countries, who regularly send money to 
their dependents, there are indications that quite a few were 
being regularly funded from "outside" in the name of religious 
and social organisations. Intelligence reports suggest that 
Disfi, Khajauli and Benipatti were the "most sensitive areas" 
where the activities of certain fundamentalist organisations 
were kept under constant vigil. 
  The Union Home Ministry, has recently alerted the bordering 
district administration to keep watch on certain fundamentalist 
organisations in view of the shift in the activities of the ISI 
and its style of operation. "Although no specific incident of 
any subversive kind has been reported so far, the district 
administration is keeping constant watch on activities of 
certain organisations and individuals. The ISI is very 
professional in its functioning and it lures target groups on 
long-term basis. We cannot take things for granted", Madhubani 
SP [Superintendent of Police] Bhatti said. 
  On its part, the district administration has geared up its 
resources to monitor the situation and prevent activities of any 
such agency ought to create chaos in the district. A team of 
Special Branch officials has been set up by the SP after a 
directive received from the Home Ministry to keep vigil on 
suspects having ISI links. 
  Reports said that the Ahle Hadees, a Muslim organisation 
suspected in the Bombay bomb blasts has been regularly 
organising "classes" after the Ayodhya incident at Disfi. Some 
other fundamentalist organisations have also sent their 
emissaries to this region to find "suitable recruits" for a 
noble cause of avenging onslaught on their religious sentiments. 
Significantly, two accused of the Calcutta bomb-blast case, of 
whom one was arrested while other is still at large, belonged to 
this area. Both of them were hired by men of Dubai-based Dawood 
Ibrahim. 
  Eyebrows have been raised both by the police as well as some 
local residents over opening of an English medium school at 
Piprahi, a remote village under Ladania block of the district 
along the international border, by a Kashmiri youth in 
association with two Japanese women settled at Kathmandu. 
Enquiries revealed that the Japanese women aged 45 years, owned 
a leather garment factory in Kathmandu. The Kashmiri youth 
Abdul Qayum Gilani and another Japanese girl stayed together 
with the women in Kathmandu. It is learnt that the trio owned 
one of the biggest leather factories with highest turnover in 
Nepal. 
  Earlier they had plans to open the school at Murshidabad 
along the Bangladesh border but they changed their mind after 
lot of persuasion by a Muslim youth from the Piprahi village who 
worked in their leather factory. The Dreamland English medium 
school, as it is named has a four-roomed building on a piece of 
three kathas [about one seventh of an acre] of land donated by 
one Bindeshwar Chaudhary of this village. The school was 
inaugurated by the former MLA of this area, Mahendra Narayan Jha 
in the presence of several officers and senior citizens. 
  Abdul Qayum Gilani, however refuted allegations of opening 
the school with any ulterior motive. Piqued over the police 
raid the other day and the previous night, Mr. Gilani said that 
the administration had no right to disturb a bona fide citizen 
of the country like this when he was available for satisfying 
the queries throughout the day. The two Japanese women were 
also present when this correspondent visited the school. 
  Asked why he chose that remote village to run the school, he 
said "since childhood I have been nourishing the wish to serve 
the poor and the weaker section of the society. It was just a 
chance that we selected this site. Moreover, a local Muslim 
youth who happens to be an employee of our factory approached me 
and offered a piece of land for the school." 
  Gilani, who is trying for Japanese citizenship, said that he 
was adopted by the Japanese woman as her son about 12 years ago 
and since then he had been living with her in Kathmandu. The 
young Japanese girl, he said, was his fiancee and they were 
likely to be married very soon.

  [Text] Lagos, 20 Apr (PANA) -- Various types of drugs and 
psychotropic substances, weighing 8,811.4874 kilogrammes and 
with an estimated street value of 1.34 billion Naria (22 Naira; 
one US dollar), were seized from 453 suspects arrested by 
Nigeria's National Drug Law Enforcement Agency (NDLEA) in 1993. 
The NDLEA said in a statement made available in Lagos Wednesday 
[20 April] that the figure did not include the massive haul of a 
special high grade heroin of 248.3 kilogrammes imported from 
Bangkok, Thailand. The drug was seized in December from 
businessman Joe Brown Akubueze, who was jailed 25 years early in 
1994 for the offence. 
  The statement said that the number of arrests in 1993 far 
outstripped the figures from the previous years. It said 
7461.744 kilogrammes of marijuana were seized while the 
quantities for cocaine and heroin accounted were 1308.6697 and 
39.2862 kilogrammes. The statement added that Murtala Muhammed 
International Airport, Lagos, maintained its position as the 
leading point of both seizures and arrests. It said the largest 
drug haul was made in February when 2724.896 kilogrammes were 
[seized], adding that this was followed by another seizure of 
1647.2515 kilogrammes in October.

  [Text] Cape Town -- Two of the Green Party's (GP) 
candidates in the Western Cape have left the party in outrage at 
a manifesto which calls for the legalisation and mass production 
of dagga as a purportedly ecologically sound alternative 
resource. The GP's manifesto--with the words "Freedom of Choice 
printed in an arc over a dagga leaf--also calls for freedom of 
choice for private consumption of alcohol, tobacco, marijuana 
etc." 
  Candidates Ian Williams and Zarin Thomson had no idea these 
were central tenets of Green policy. Mr. Thomson said: "The 
initial constitution which I agreed with when I accepted 
candidature differs significantly from the manifesto upon which 
the Green Party is contesting the election. The new Green Party 
manifesto supports the legalisation of marijuana, and advocates 
narcotic usage. This contrary to my personal philosophy," he 
said. 
  The manifesto suggests the mass cultivation of hemp 
(cannabis 
sativa, popularly called dagga) would be good for the ecology, 
and the economy. It advocates the dagga plant as a 
"self-fertilising cash crop" with uses ranging from producing 
"green (ethanol) fuel" to clothing.

<F P=106> [Jaroslav Spurny article: "Government Rejected Report on </F>
Security Situation"] 
  [Text] Last week, Klaus' cabinet rejected a report on which 
three ministries have been working for six months. According to 
Prime Minister Klaus the report failed to deliver solutions for 
sorting out the problems indicated in the report. The 
government agreed, however, with the main conclusion of the 
report: "There is no threat to the Czech Republic which could 
throw its political stability out of balance or endanger its 
sovereignty in the foreseeable future." 
<H5>  Gangs, Drugs, and Spies </H5>
  Organized crime, "external security risks" (nationalism, 
above all), and illegal migration are the most serious security 
problems today, the report states. Vladimir Suman, chairman of 
the Defense and Security Committee, arrived at the same 
conclusion on his own recently. The 200-page report, however, 
deals with his conclusions on several pages only. 
  Last year, the police department in charge of criminal 
organizations eliminated 15 gangs. Their members committed 
murders, burglaries, extortion, and they forged documents. Some 
of the gangs even cooperated with policemen. When apprehending 
mafia members, police found stolen money in the amount of 
$100,000, 250 kilograms of Semtex, 186 kilograms perunite 
[perunit], submachine guns, pistols, radio transmitters, over 
1,000 counterfeit passports, and 0.6 kilograms of radioactive 
californium. 
  As regards drugs, police arrested over 100 drug traffickers 
and dealers. Heroin, ephedrine, cocaine, and morphine were 
found on them, all in amounts not exceeding one kilogram. 
Police discovered 21 money counterfeiters, and also a gang who 
attempted smuggling arms to Iran and Bosnia. 
  According to the Security Information Service (BIS), no case 
of a planned terrorist action has been recorded on Czech 
territory, if we do not count 44 bomb actions without political 
connotations, which are under investigation by police. The BIS 
is convinced that Russian, Ukrainian, and Polish intelligence 
services have become "significantly active" on our territory. 
Reportedly, they are most interested in our arms exports. Arab 
countries, too, are reportedly very active: Iraq, Iran, Libya, 
Syria, and Palestine. Allegedly, they are mostly concerned with 
the "continuity of economic relations." The rest of the BIS 
report describes the work of counterintelligence. It does so 
very vaguely for secrecy reasons. 
  The Military Intelligence Service (VZS) sees the main danger 
in a nationalist conflict between Russia and Ukraine. The 
military sees the second greatest danger in the developments in 
the former German Democratic Republic. "The totalitarian past 
of the eastern laenders is a fertile soil for extremist and 
racially intolerant individuals within the German population," 
the VZS analysis says. Third, the military intelligence list 
describes the "belt of crisis situations" which "starts in 
Africa, goes through the Middle East, south Europe, Central Asia 
and India, and ends in the Far East." 
<H5>  From Crime to Conviction: Too Long a Time </H5>
  As regards the problems of internal security, all experts 
are 
united over one problem: There is too long a time between when 
a crime is committed and when the perpetrator is convicted and 
sentenced. Only in simpler cases are perpetrators sentenced 
within one year. However, if the convict has committed several 
crimes, or if he has accomplices, then the criminal proceedings 
may take two or three years. 
  Several figures are worth mentioning. Violent crimes 
increased by two thirds in 1993 against the previous year. In 
the Czech Republic, 195 murders and 4,109 muggings were 
committed last year. A total of 20 percent of crimes are 
committed by minors. The highest success rate as regards 
explained crimes is in the district of Rychnov nad Kneznou (68 
percent), and the smallest in Prague (13.5 percent). The higher 
increase in the crime rate was recorded in the Pardubice 
district (40 percent), and the smallest in Most (7 percent 
decline). 
  As regards the Czech Republic's security, the report speaks 
about three priorities: 
  An increased interest of migrants in residing in our country 
is being expected, and therefore it is important to secure the 
border with Slovakia as soon as possible. 
  Organized crime (drugs, [radioactive] waste material) is 
expected to increase. With respect to this development, a new 
amendment to the criminal code is being drafted.

  [Text] Budapest, 21 Apr (MTI) -- Hungarian customs 
officers and border guards found 211 kilograms of heroin, a 
record siezure in Hungary, at Artand on the Romanian border 
yesterday. 
  The truck carrying the drug was driven by a Turkish national 
who lives in The Netherlands. The Border Guards asked customs 
officers to exhaustively examine the truck which was claimed to 
be delivering hazel cream. After an extensive search, the 
authorities found over 211 kilograms of heroin in 207 packs 
hidden in a tank below the trailer. The driver was arrested and 
investigation is under way. 
  According to the National Customs and Excise Office, this 
year customs authorities confiscated 535 kilograms of drugs on 
15 occasions. In the same period last year, they found only 3 
kilograms on five occasions.

  [Text] Szczecin, 19 Apr -- Nearly 100 kg of smuggled 
cocaine with a "market" value of nearly 100 million German marks 
was incinerated on 19 April at a facility of the Pomeranian 
department of the Border Guard in Szczecin. This was reported 
by Major Wlodzimierz Warchol of the Pomeranian department of the 
Border Guard. 
  The drugs were incinerated by order of the Szczecin 
provincial court, in cooperation with pharmaceutical authorities. 
  The cocaine, probably originating from South America, was 
seized by the border guards this April. It had been brought 
into Gdansk aboard a ship which has not yet been identified, and 
was to have been transported to Holland through Germany. 
  The drugs were found in an automobile being used, according 
to investigators, by a 48-year-old Greek, Thomas M., traveling 
on a forged Dutch passport. He is currently being tried by the 
Szczecin provincial court.

    [Editorial Report] The following is a compilation of 
narcotics reports from the Danish press from 23 March through 10 
April. 
  Police seized drugs, precursor chemicals, and two pistols in 
a raid on an amphetamines factory in the Zealand Island city of 
Roskilde on 23 March, following an investigation that began last 
fall. So far, 11 persons have been arrested. "Many of those 
charged have especially close ties to known rocker [motorcycle] 
groups in the Copenhagen area," according to a police official. 
In previous amphetamines factory cases, members of the Hell's 
Angels gang, including a former president, often figured 
prominently. It is generally believed that precursor drugs for 
Danish amphetamines factories are brought in from Germany and 
Poland, where they are easily purchased. (Copenhagen BERLINGSKE 
TIDENDE in Danish 24 Mar 94 p 7) 
  For the first time ever, the Danish Navy has been called on 
for an counternarcotics operation in Danish waters. A 
minesweeper is joining the search for hashish dumped overboard 
by the coastal boat Hela on 3 April as police cutters approached 
to search the vessel off the south coast of the island of Funen. 
The search for Kim Julskov Knudsen, age 41, the supposed 
ringleader and previously convicted drug smuggler, is 
continuing, according to police. The minesweeper Flyvefisken was 
tasked to join Navy divers, who have already hauled up over 
5,000 kg from the bottom of Helnaes Bay. Authorities plan a 
thorough search before reopening the waters to sport diving. 
(Copenhagen BERLINGSKE TIDENDE in Danish 8 Apr 94 p 1) 
  An automobile search following a traffic accident outside 
Roskilde yielded over 1 kg of unusually pure heroin and led to 
the arrest of Dirk Sondergaard, a previously convicted drug 
smuggler and safecracker. He was sentenced in 1987 for acting 
as a courier of heroin from Pakistan and was imprisoned for five 
and a half years. (Copenhagen BERLINGSKE TIDENDE in Danish 8 Apr 
94 p 4) 
  A 29-year-old man from Funen was sentenced in Grasten for 
having smuggled narcotics over the border from Germany. Over 50 
grams of amphetamines and 1,270 LSD capsules were found in his 
residence. (Copenhagen BERLINGSKE TIDENDE SONDAG in Danish 10 
Apr 94 p 2) 
  Illegal drug use among refugees and recent immigrants is 
believed to have greatly increased in recent years. This problem 
was discussed at a Copenhagen meeting of drug treatment 
officials, physicians, and police. While no nationwide 
statistics have been gathered, the chief physician of the 
Copenhagen Health Department stated, "We suspect that the 
problem is growing. We are hearing from more treatment 
institutions that they have an overrepresentation of 
immigrants." He cited language and cultural isolation among this 
population group as a main factor, and urged that this be taken 
into account in organizing prevention and treatment programs.

Hashish"] 
  [Text] Sentence: A dozen persons are awaiting trial in a 
large hashish case involving, among other individuals, the 
chairman of the Association of Criminal Police, KRIM, and a 
county government leader. Also in connection with this case, 
Copenhagen Municipal Court on Wednesday [6 April] sentenced 
Briton Timothy McCarthy to a prison term of six months. He 
admitted to having been involved in the smuggling of at least 
1.5 tons of hashish and to have earned at least 30 million 
kroner. 
  His 46-year-old compatriot was earlier given the same 
sentence for his role in the smuggling incidents. Up to one 
dozen more persons are still awaiting trial. 
  Among those currently jailed in the case is the chairman of 
KRIM, a North Zealand county government leader, and a union 
official. Police think the indicted individuals have altogether 
smuggled in hashish amounting to a street value of 60 million 
kroner. The supposed ringleaders can expect to be called before 
a grand jury in the fall. 
  In addition to the prison sentence, McCarthy's sentence 
contains a permanent ban on entering Denmark after having served 
his prison term and a confiscation of an estate of 400,000 
kroner, 100 kg of hashish, and various articles of 
communications equipment.

<F P=106> [Article by Paivi Repo: "European Comparison: Finland Has </F>
Strictest Drug Policy and Fewest Users"] 
  [Text] "Finland's drug policy is the strictest in Europe, 
although we have the lowest number of drug users," said 
Assistant Professor Osmo Kontula. He has compiled information 
about the drug situation in Finland for a report covering the 
situation in 13 European cities. 
  There are 500-1,000 drug users in Finland who use hard 
drugs. 
The figure is 10 times higher in the other Nordic countries. 
  During the period studied, hundreds of grams of drugs were 
seized in Finland, while, in other parts of Europe, hundreds, 
sometimes even thousands, of kilos were seized. Death by 
poisoning is not caused by heroin, but by medication abuse, and 
of the individuals who are HIV-positive, only 10 percent are 
intravenous drug users. 
  "In a civilized nation, the number of drug users does not 
determine the country's drug policy, but instead it is 
formulated from the perspective of the individual users. We have 
forgotten the users and their problems, and the few existing 
treatment institutions are fighting for their survival," 
emphasized Kontula. 
  Drug users have been watched more intensely in Finland than 
in Sweden, and monitoring has been as extensive as the law 
allows. Drug users have been arrested, and their homes have been 
searched, in a way that Kontula does not feel would have been 
found appropriate in any other Western European country. 
<H5>  Tighter Controls Needed </H5>
  "I would like to encourage the supervisory authorities to 
use 
more common sense than before, and to contemplate which would be 
more appropriate in lessening the negative effects, control or 
treatment. Drug addicts have become the victims of the policy 
chosen, and this has caused major problems for users," explained 
Osmo Kontula. 
  In his view, the monitoring of users could be reduced and it 
could be directed toward cases "where the users themselves may 
experience problems, or where other criminal activities are 
involved." 
  According to Kontula, at the beginning of this decade, 
Finland had three full-time drug enforcement officials for every 
drug user, while there was only a minimal number of treatment 
personnel. "Joining the European Union will increase the need to 
humanize the monitoring process and move the focus from customs 
and police services to the areas of social and health services. 
We moved in an opposite direction from the rest of Europe, when, 
during the last few years, we decided to reduce treatment 
facilities," he added. 
<H5>  Narcotics Do Not Compete With Alcohol </H5>
  The Finn's intoxicant of choice is alcohol. Mixing alcohol 
and medication is a fairly common practice. The abuse of medical 
drugs is four times as common as the use of narcotics. 
  Psychoactive drugs prescribed for medical use are also 
considered narcotic substances. According to Kontula, in the 
rest of Europe, only addictive drugs are considered to be 
narcotics. 
  The drug problem is not very large, as there are still few 
displaced people in Finland. Another obstacle, in Osmo Kontula's 
view, is a feature of the Finnish culture where intoxication is 
a conscious means of establishing contact with other people. 
According to him, because narcotics lead to social isolation, 
they can not compete with alcohol.

  [Text] Athens (DPA) -- According to Greek customs, on 
Friday morning [22 April] a young German couple tried to smuggle 
121 kg of heroin across the Turkish-Greek border. The 
drug-sniffing dogs got extremely nervous when the couple's 
camper approached the customs station. Therefore, the customs 
officials disassembled the vehicle. The two Germans have 
already made a confession. 
  According to what they said, they entered Turkey via Izmir 
at 
the beginning of April to meet a Turk they knew, who had worked 
in Germany for a long time. The drugs were destined for a 
client in London. The couple was in financial difficulties, 
which they wanted to remedy by smuggling drugs.

  [Text] Customs officers at the Kipoi checkpoint in the 
area of Evros [on the Turkish border] early this morning succeed 
in striking the biggest blow in recent years against the 
international heroin cartels. Customs officers discovered 121 
kilos of heroin hidden in a camper. The camper belongs to 
German nationals (Juergen Maert), 31, and his wife (Dona 
Annette), 26, who had left Turkey heading for London. During 
the interrogation, the Germans told the customs officers that 
they knew of the heroin's existence in their camper, and that 
they were going to receive 100,000 German marks upon its 
delivery in London. The drugs and camper were confiscated and 
the two Germans will appear before the Alexandroupolis 
prosecutor within the day.

<F P=106> [Ian Rodger report: "Swiss Clean Up Rules On Dirty Money"] </F>
  [Text] Switzerland's private bankers have long tended to 
have a smug attitude to questions about accepting dirty money. 
  "We have always been extremely careful about who we will 
accept," one Geneva banker said recently. They say that even in 
the bad old days, when the famous anonymous numbered accounts 
were permitted, they always checked their clients' credentials 
thoroughly. 
  These claims ring rather hollow in the light of the latest 
case of dirty money--a $150m (102.7m pounds) account at Union 
Bank of Switzerland [UBS] in Zurich held openly in the name of 
Mrs Sheila Miriam Arana de Nasser, wife and partner of a 
suspected big-league Colombian drug dealer. 
  Swiss bankers now admit lamely that their screening of 
clients was perhaps not quite as rigorous in the 1970s--when 
this particular account was opened--and before as it is today. 
"We were not as sensitive to money laundering then," Mr Stephan 
Haeringer, a UBS director, conceded last week. 
  But bankers were surprised that UBS was the one caught out. 
Switzerland's largest bank is renowned for its careful scrutiny 
of potential customers. In the late 1980s, for example, UBS 
alone among the three large Swiss universal banks managed to 
steer clear of Robert Maxwell, Polly Peck, Olympia &amp; York, 
Omni 
and other big corporate groups that subsequently collapsed. It 
was also the first Swiss bank to refer the deposits of foreign 
politicians to the executive board. 
  The problem, Swiss bankers say, is one of Altlasten, a 
German 
word describing old deposits of toxic waste. All the 
well-established banks have accounts like that of Mrs Arana that 
were opened years before screening was tightened. And like 
concentrations of toxic waste, these accounts can explode at any 
time without warning. 
  The Swiss Federal Banking Commission's 1992 guidelines to 
bankers provide no fewer than 30 pointers to help them detect 
whether or not money is being laundered. But all of them have 
to do with transactions--withdrawals, purchase of drafts, 
transfers or excessive cash movements. 
  If, as in the Arana case, the account lies virtually dormant 
for several years, it is more difficult for the bank's internal 
auditors to detect a problem. 
  The commission acknowledged the difficulty, saying that "it 
is not the banks' responsibility to investigate systematically 
all customer transactions for a possible connection to criminal 
activities". 
  That said, UBS's local competitors still have trouble 
understanding this case. They say that now banks have put 
customer accounts on computer files, it is not difficult to 
isolate all the Altlasten from, say, Colombia or Sicily for a 
special audit. Also, bankers say they now scan the newspapers 
for scandals and criminal activities out of fear that some of 
those involved are among their clients. 
  But the prevailing view among Swiss bankers remains rather 
fatalistic--that a banking centre like Switzerland which 
specialises in attracting investment funds from rich individuals 
will inevitably also attract criminals. 
  "They have to place their money somewhere and they prefer to 
do it in the biggest and most efficient financial centres," a 
Swiss Bankers' Association spokesman stressed. 
  The Swiss doubt that they need further legislation to combat 
criminal money. In the past four years they have put in place 
what they believe is one of the best prevention and prosecution 
systems in the world. 
  Money laundering has become a criminal offence, which allows 
the Swiss police to co-operate fully with their foreign 
counterparts. 
  Bankers are obliged to know the real owners of all their 
accounts and are forbidden from accepting criminal money. 
Acceptance of such money through negligence is also punishable. 
  Later this year two additional legal reforms will complete 
the package, one permitting bankers to denounce suspected 
criminal clients to the police and the other making membership 
in a criminal organisation a criminal offence. This will enable 
the Swiss authorities to co-operate with Italy in Mafia 
investigations. 
  The one consolation arising from the latest case is that it 
showed that the Swiss, who often turned a blind eye to financial 
crime in the past, are now willing to move quickly when 
suspicions are raised. 
  Once the facts were known, the authorities froze the bank 
account and arrested Mrs Arana at her home near Geneva. 
  The Banking Commission and the Bankers' Association have 
already launched investigations of UBS's conduct, and the bank 
has suspended a vice-president responsible for the account. 
  The Swiss, at least, believe that the message to both banks 
and money launderers is clear.

  [Text] Tskhinvali, 21 Apr -- Russian troops deployed at the 
Russian-Georgian border, stepped up controls at the Roki tunnel 
near Buron village. Representatives of narcotics businesses, 
who used to smuggle vast amounts of narcotics, opposed this 
step. Making the controls tougher also caused discontent among 
the Ossetian separatists. 
  An IBERIA correspondent was told at the headquarters of the 
Georgian peacekeeping troops deployed in Tskhinvali that the 
Ossetian population of Tskhinvali had held a rally where they 
demanded that the Russian border troops be moved from the 
northern border of the so-called South Ossetia because the 
presence of the troops there means demarcating the state border 
between Russia and Georgia.

  [Text] In accordance with the decree signed by Georgian 
leader Eduard Shevardnadze on Friday, a national bureau to fight 
drug addiction and drug business has been created in Georgia. 
The bureau has been created on the basis of the department in 
charge for fighting drug addiction within Georgia's Interior 
Ministry in order to strengthen the fight against drug addiction 
and the drug business. 
  A section in charge for supervision over the cases on 
illegal 
circulation of narcotics and psychotropic substances is being 
created in the republic's prosecutor's office "to observe 
legislation with respect to fighting drugs." 
  The republic's customs department has been commissioned to 
create services to prevent transit of drugs through the border. 
  The decree stresses that the difficult social-economic 
situation in Georgia, aggravation of the criminal situation, 
weakening of border control have facilitated the spread of drug 
addiction in Georgia. Spreading of drug addiction among young 
people arouses special concern. In addition, the drug mafia is 
showing an interest in Georgia as a country which is convenient 
for drug transit. 
  Vice Premier Irakly Menagarishvili, chairman of the 
governmental commission on drug fighting declared at a 
conference on Friday in Tbilisi that there are about 100,000 
drug addicts in Georgia now, more than 200,000 have died as a 
result of their addiction. He said that these are predominantly 
young people aged 16-20.

<F P=106> [Interview with Rita Aliukoniene, prosecutor of the Military </F>
Organizations Supervision Department, by Justas Laucius; place 
and date not given: "Customs Are Shrouded With 
Legends"--questions published in boldface] 
  [Excerpts] [passage omitted] [Laucius] From where does 
contraband come to Lithuania? 
  [Aliukoniene] Most goods are smuggled from Russia, 
Kaliningrad Oblast, Azerbaijan, Georgia, and other former USSR 
republics. People are bringing poppies and other narcotic 
substances to our country. Such contraband usually arrives by 
rail, because it is easier to hide poppies there. Post-Soviet 
southern states also import arms, ammunition, and explosives. 
  [Laucius] What contraband is brought into Lithuania? 
  [Aliukoniene] In 1993, the Prosecutor General's Office 
instituted eight criminal proceedings for drug trafficking. One 
of the largest such cases is that of two Russian citizens, 
incidentally, students, who tried to bring in 3.6 kilograms of 
hashish hidden in the staff compartment on the 
"Moscow-Kaliningrad" train. A criminal action was brought 
against one Lithuanian citizen who tried to smuggle 15,200 
packages of cigarettes worth 27,500 litai through the customs 
house in Lazdijai. The largest contraband in 1993 was 4 tonnes 
of quicksilver illegally brought from Belarus. Its value at 
prices of that time was estimated at almost 4.5 million rubles. 
  However, a large number of goods are smuggled through border 
crossing points, which are practically uncontrolled, rather than 
customs houses. Knowing that Lithuania has 15 customs houses 
and 75 border crossings, one can only imagine the scope of 
contraband.... 
  [Laucius] Is contraband usually brought in by Lithuanians or 
by foreigners? 
  [Aliukoniene] It is mostly imported by 
foreigners--inhabitants of Kaliningrad Oblast and southern 
regions. Many problems arise due to this, because by applying 
administrative punishments to foreigners, we do not have a legal 
mechanism regulating the retrieval of money in cases when 
foreigners do not have it.... 
  Customs officers in Lazdijai are the most busy ones--the 
road 
to Europe runs through there. Last year, however, the largest 
amount of goods was confiscated in the Vilnius customs 
house--worth as much as 4,548,970 litai. [passage omitted] 
  [Laucius] Could you mention any cases where the largest 
amount of contraband was detained? 
  [Aliukoniene] The Customs Department has instituted 13 
criminal actions for arms contraband as early as this year. In 
the beginning of this year, an aircraft fully packed with arms 
and ammunition, shipped from Buenos Aires, landed at the airport 
in Karmelava. The prosecutor's office of the Kaunas region is 
conducting a preliminary investigation into this case. 
  Inspection on a transit train at the Kena railway post in 
the 
Vilnius region discovered a large number of gas pistols and 
ammunition hidden in the restaurant car, which someone tried to 
deliver to Moscow. 
  Transit shipments cause great concern because they do not 
require customs duties. The so-called "fake transit" is 
extremely widespread, when according to the documents goods seem 
to travel to another state, while actually they remain in 
Lithuania, and customs officials only mark in the documents that 
the load was exported. Certainly, such services are well 
rewarded.... [passage omitted]

<F P=106> [Eva Bach-Koenig report on UN drug conference which took </F>
place in Vienna "this week;" statements of participants in 
English with superimposed German translation] 
  [Text] [Bach-Koenig] Fifty percent of all crimes are 
drug-related. At a conference in Vienna, representatives from 
53 countries discussed new strategies in the fight against drugs 
this week. Whereas some countries consider the legalization of 
drugs the only solution, the South Asian countries are adopting 
increasingly tough measures. Japan again executed a drug 
smuggler after three years. In Taiwan and Singapore, more drug 
dealers were executed this year than in the whole of last year. 
In China, a total of 1,400 executions took place last year. In 
Singapore, the possession of 15 grams of heroin is forbidden on 
penalty of death. Portugal is an example of a more liberal 
policy. As Father (Feydor Pinto) stated at the UN drug 
conference, Portugal practically does not punish drug consumers. 
Their rehabilitation should be facilitated in this way. In 
Austria, there are also considerations concerning the 
legalization of so-called soft drugs, including cannabis 
products like hashish. However, this soft attitude is the 
reason for the adoption of tighter laws by Asian politicians, 
the president of the International Drug Control Council, (Hamid 
Godze), claims. 
  Godze: Legalization only makes matters worse. I 
do not believe that there is any bad intention behind the 
legalization of drugs. It is only a sign of frustration. 
Legalization is certainly not the right path toward a solution 
of the problem. In fact, we are facing numerous setbacks in the 
fight against the abuse of drugs, but we also achieve successes. 
We must not give up hope. 
  Bach-Koenig: However, the tough position does not 
seem to be particularly successful either. As the Iranian 
representative (Golam Hosseyn Sadegigarache) pointed out, the 
antidrug campaign has developed into an outright war. The drug 
smugglers are being fought by the military in Iran. For this 
reason, the drug smugglers possess ultra-modern military 
equipment. 
  Russia and Ukraine do not believe that they are in a 
position 
to get the smuggling of drugs from Iran, Afghanistan, and the 
Golden Triangle in Southeast Asia under control. Russia 
estimates the turnover of the drug dealers in its country at 
approximately $150 million. The Russian representative stated, 
referring to the worldwide sale of drugs: 
  Unidentified Russian representative: This is a 
lot. Not millions and not hundreds of millions, but billions of 
dollars are involved in drug trafficking, in illegal deals. 
This is probably the largest or second-largest turnover 
worldwide. The profit of the dealers is enormous. This makes 
them so powerful. Thus, the countries must closely cooperate in 
the fight against drug-related crime. Drugs are no national 
problem. Every piece of money earned by the drug dealers, no 
matter how small it is, makes somebody suffer somewhere. 
  Bach-Koenig: The drug dealers are estimated to 
turn over $100 billion worldwide every year. With a new 
computer network, the 53 member states of the council want to 
control the international trade -- not only the illegal one -- 
more efficiently. Like other countries, Austria has been urged 
to join the UN convention on curbing the legal trade. This 
convention also contains the ban of 10 legal substances which 
are used to produce drugs, including the chemical acetone, which 
is used for the production of cocaine. In Austria, Switzerland, 
Belgium, the Netherlands, and Ireland, some of these substances 
are used on a large-scale basis by the pharmaceutical industry.

  [Text] Vienna, 20 Apr (EFE) -- A high-ranking Bolivian 
government official stated that Bolivia needs at least $25 
million per year to be able to implement a sustainable 
development program, "which is the only way to defeat drug 
trafficking and extreme poverty." 
  This week Mario Soliz Valenzuela, national social defense 
secretary of the Bolivian Government Ministry, said: "As the 
world community knows, the Bolivian Government does not have 
those resources; this is why we appeal to the international 
community for cooperation if there is a true desire to do 
something concrete." 
  He added: "The Bolivian Government alone cannot wage, under 
such unfair circumstances" a war "against foreign drug 
traffickers, their technology to produce and export, their 
safety measures, and their flow of money and power, which is 
what makes international cooperation a must." 
  In his address to the 37th session of the UN Commission on 
Narcotic Drugs, headquartered in Vienna, that will end on 22 
April, Soliz said the drug problem will still be "long and 
bloody." 
  Bolivia is the world's second-largest producer of coca 
leaves, after Peru, and the second-largest cocaine exporter, 
after Colombia. 
  Soliz called upon "friendly governments, international 
organizations, and financial enterprises such as the World Bank 
and the IDB [Inter-American Development Bank] to help the 
Bolivian Government use its potential to eradicate surplus coca 
plantations by 1997." 
  The Bolivian Government plans to open a land register for 
the 
Chapare region, which will help obtain foreign financial aid "to 
start alternative development programs in the coca production 
region and, for the first time, give peasants there access to a 
market economy, free of any suspicion." 
  The mere possibility of obtaining a legal deed as a result 
of 
the census "increases the property value nine-fold with the 
advantage of being able to obtain direct financial aid," 
asserted the Bolivian Government representative. 
  Soliz added: "Many things are changing in Bolivia lately, 
such as the broader approach to the longstanding problems we 
have endured." 
  One of the goals established by President Gonzalo Sanchez de 
Lozada's government is to give priority treatment to the problem 
of illegal drug trafficking and consumption, "which we combat in 
a resolute, frank, and decided manner." 
  Currently, the fight against drug trafficking in Bolivia is 
centered on alternative development and police and legal 
interdiction of drug organizations, as well as prevention, 
stated Soliz. 
  The UN International Drug Control Board, in its 1993 report 
disclosed in February, urges Bolivia to modify its law regarding 
consumption of coca tea and the chewing of coca leaves "unless 
it believes that the reasons for including this product on the 
list of the 1961 Convention are no longer valid," and, if so, it 
would have to propose that it be eliminated from the list. 
  In this regard, Soliz said that in Bolivia the Law of 
Special 
Regulations on Coca and Controlled Substances, Law No. 1008, 
"allows the legal use of this product, such as in the coca tea 
industry, the chewing of coca leaves, and its use for rituals, 
and establishes that Yungas is the traditional coca production 
zone," where the replacement of coca plantations must be 
"voluntary and compensated, and bans coca plantations throughout 
the rest of the country." 
  Soliz explained that Bolivia has reached an agreement with 
the United States to eradicate 5,000 of the 8,000 hectares of 
coca planted per year in exchange for financial aid for the 
Bolivian balance of payments. 
  Soliz admitted, however, that although a plan for an 
alternative development has been implemented, "it still has not 
reached a degree that will allow a reduction of the production 
of coca and cocaine that reaches the consumer countries." 
  Therefore, if productive activities that might absorb labor 
and generate political and social stability are not promoted, 
"one cannot dream of a voluntary reduction of surplus coca 
plantations," that is, those prohibited by Law No. 1008. 
  Substitution "must entail products that will have a foreign 
market; if not, alternative development is unfeasible," asserted 
the Bolivia social defense secretary.

  [Text] The 37th session of the Commission for Narcotic 
Substances, the leading UN body for control over narcotics, is 
under way in the Austrian capital, attended by a Belarusian 
delegation. The delegation's report provided an analysis of the 
situation in the field of drug abuse in Belarus and measures 
taken in this sphere at the national level. Concrete facts were 
cited illustrating attempts by the international drug Mafia to 
use Belarus for the transit of drugs from the East to the West 
as an alternative to the traditional Balkan path. This path is 
currently much more difficult to use in light of the fighting in 
that region. Belarusian representative Mikalay Syerada 
positively assessed the fruitful cooperation of the Republic of 
Belarus with the UN bodies and voiced hope that Belarusian 
efforts will receive adequate support from the United Nations.

<H5>  Finland </H5>
  Finnish radio reports that the Central Criminal Police have 
uncovered a Finnish branch of an international drugs gang. The 
police have thus far confiscated "over half a kilo" of heroin. 
The police uncovered the gang in cooperation with the U.S. Drug 
Enforcement Administration and U.S. Customs. It is suspected 
that the operation has been going on for at least a year, and

  [Text] Sao Paulo, 22 Apr (EFE) -- Andean countries 
receiving trade benefits from the EU as compensation for their 
fight against the drug trade today proposed that the European 
Commission [EC] extend similar benefits to Venezuela, which also 
is committed to fighting drugs. 
  The proposal to include Venezuela among those countries 
receiving compensation for their fight on drugs was made by the 
foreign ministers of Bolivia, Colombia, Ecuador, Peru, and 
Venezuela at a meeting they held today with Manuel Marin, a 
Spaniard who serves as EC vice president and commissioner for 
Latin America. 
  In remarks to EFE, Colombian Foreign Minister Noemi Sanin 
said they had asked Marin "that the EU study the possibility of 
extending those benefits to Venezuela, a country that also needs 
trade compensation for allocating its resources to fighting the 
drug trade." 
  Several export products from Colombia, Peru, and Bolivia are 
entitled to tariff reductions in Europe under a special 
paragraph of the Generalized System of Preferences (GSP), a 
mechanism whereby the EU regulates its trade with Latin American 
countries. 
  Marin, who met with the foreign ministers of Andean 
countries 
to listen to their proposals concerning the renewal and 
expansion of the GSP, will convey these proposals to the other 
EC members. 
  The GSP expires late this year and the EU must decide 
whether 
to renew the foreign trade mechanism as is, amend it, or expand 
it. 
  The Andean countries, Sanin said, expressed their interest 
in 
having the GSP renewed and expanded and that the trade benefits 
the EU is granting countries involved in drug enforcement 
efforts be extended to Venezuela. 
  The meeting between Marin and the Andean foreign ministers 
was held simultaneously with the fourth meeting of Rio Group and 
EU ministers that began today at the Latin American Parliament 
building in the Brazilian city of Sao Paulo. 
  Marin is scheduled to meet on 23 April with the foreign 
ministers of Mercosur [Common Market of the South] member 
countries (which consists of Argentina, Brazil, Paraguay, and 
Uruguay) to hear their proposals regarding the GSP. 
  Attending the ministerial meeting are all the foreign 
ministers of the Rio Group members countries: Argentina, 
Bolivia, Brazil, Colombia, Chile, Ecuador, Mexico, Paraguay, 
Peru, Uruguay, and Venezuela. Also attending the meeting as 
observers are the ministers of Trinidad and Tobago and 
Guatemala, representing the Caribbean and Central America, 
respectively. 
  The EU is represented by the foreign ministers of Spain and 
Portugal; Greek Alternate Foreign Affairs Minister Theodoros 
Pangalos; and deputy ministers and vice ministers from the other 
EU member countries (Germany, Belgium, Denmark, France, the 
Netherlands, Ireland, Italy, Luxembourg, and the United Kingdom). 
  Since the signing of the Rome Declaration (1990) -- which 
institutionalized talks between the EU and the Rio Group, the 
main Latin American forum for concerted political and economic 
action and for promoting integration -- the two sides have held 
three meetings: the first in Luxembourg (April 1991), the second 
in Santiago, Chile (May 1992), and the third in Copenhagen 
(April 1993).

  [Text] Sao Paulo, 22 Apr -- The foreign ministers and 
delegates from the Rio Group and the EU today condemned in a 
joint declaration any attempt to disrupt democracy in Latin 
America. 
  The representatives of the 12 EU countries and the 13 
representatives of the Rio Group, the main Latin American forum 
for concerted action, promised to contribute to the 
strengthening of democracy through the subordination of all 
sectors to legally constituted civilian authorities. 
  The so-called "Sao Paulo Declaration," which is eight pages 
long, establishes the bases for future dialogue in the political 
and economic fields. 
  The European bloc wanted the document to mention the 
subordination of the armed forces to civilian power. This 
proposal, however, was softened at the recommendation of the 
Latin Americans, who preferred not to mention the military at a 
moment when threats to the institutional order were felt in some 
countries. 
  The document condemns xenophobia, racism, terrorism, and the 
illegal production, trafficking, and consumption of drugs, as 
well as money laundering. 
  The delegates agreed to concentrate their "efforts in 
combating the wave of racism and xenophobia against, for 
example, immigrant workers and their families through, among 
other measures, the application of strict laws and the 
implementation of intense education campaigns." 
  As for drug enforcement, the participants agreed to apply 
global solutions to the drug problem, prevent the misuse of 
chemical precursors used in drug manufacturing, and promote 
alternative income sources for the benefit of the affected 
peasants. 
  The ministers and delegates from the two blocs repudiated 
"without reservations and labelled as an unjustifiable crime all 
kinds of terrorist actions wherever they are committed by anyone 
and for any reason, because they endanger and eliminate human 
lives, offend the dignity of the human being, and attack 
democracy and the state of law." 
  They thus agreed to reinforce cooperation and coordinate 
practical measures to combat terrorism. 
  The declaration pointed out the EU's and the Rio Group's 
interest in eradicating poverty, defending the environment, and 
rejecting "arbitrary unilateral actions" in international trade 
and noncompliance with the GATT principles. 
  The document states that mutual cooperation must be aimed at 
the eradication of poverty and the protection of the 
less-favored classes. It must efficiently promote democracy and 
cooperation in the fields of economy, trade, industry, science, 
and technology. 
  The chiefs of European and Latin American diplomacy stated 
that the "right to development is part of basic human rights, 
the human being is the central subject of development, and the 
lack of development cannot be used as an excuse to justify 
disrespect for internationally acknowledged human rights." 
  They also recognized the importance of the Ibero-American 
Conference, whose fourth summit of chiefs of state and 
government will take place on 14 and 15 June in Cartagena de 
Indias, Colombia. 
  They also promised intensifying dialogue within the UN 
framework for the purpose of reforming its charter and to 
improve the organization's work methods. 
  The two blocs made an appeal to countries to renew their 
commitment to the nonproliferation of weapons of mass 
destruction, they suggested signing a multilateral treaty to 
totally prohibit nuclear tests, and they mentioned the progress 
in the consolidation of the system of a total prohibition of 
nuclear weapons in Latin America.

<F P=106> [Article by Maryann Burrows: "U.S. To Cut Back $500,000 in </F>
Drug War Funds"] 
  [Text] The International Narcotic Matters [INM] grant that 
supported many drug programmes in the Bahamas will be cut by 
half a million dollars this year, Deputy Prime Minister Orville 
Turnquest announced at a joint Bahamas/United States drug 
interdiction meeting today. 
  And while it has been indicated that Operation-BAT and the 
Aerostat would not be affected, it will take great ingenuity to 
ensure that the loss of $500,000 does not significantly impair 
the effectiveness of the Bahamas/U.S. cooperative efforts, Mr. 
Turnquest said. 
  "It will be most unfortunate that the successes which we 
have 
achieved today over the last seven years, should be reversed in 
any way by a reduction of this kind in our financial resources. 
  We state on other occasions the Bahamas is unable to 
increase its resources which are allocated to drug control 
activities. A budgetary allotment into this area is now 15 per 
cent of our total national budget," he said. 
  Mr. John Ford, U.S. Charge d'Affaires to the Bahamas said 
that the cut in the INM budget for Nassau is also regretted. But 
U.S. officials are commitment to OPBAT in terms of money, 
resources and personnel. 
  Mr. Ford said that the corporation between the Bahamas and 
the United States, continues to shine as an example for other 
bilateral and multi-lateral efforts. 
  Mr. Orville Turnquest said that the Bahamas joint task force 
exercise has become a singularly successful and unique 
continuing enterprise against the scourge of drug trafficking. 
  He said he was delighted that the results to date seem to 
indicate that while "we may not yet have won the war," the 
battle has been continuing. 
  Mr. Turnquest said good news stem from the statistics 
indicating the successful results of the joint enterprise 
between the Bahamas and the United States. 
  "The amount of cocaine seized in Bahamian waters during the 
first three quarters of 1993, has returned downwards to 1980 
level. We are told that a mere 520 pounds of cocaine or 240 
kilos, were seized in Bahamian territory in the first three 
quarters of 1993," said Mr. Turnquest. 
  "Of those totals the largest seizure in Bahamian territory 
for 1993, was an air drop retrieved by OPBAT in July. This, I 
believe, is proof of the success of this cooperative effort 
between our two countries. 
  OPBAT was also successful in seizing 2,546 pounds of cocaine 
in international waters. This reflects in my mind the reduction 
in the trend of drug trafficking activities in 1992, when the 
bulk of cocaine seizures occurred in Bahamian waters."

  [Text] Ningbo, March 23 (XINHUA) -- People living in 
Ningbo, in east China's Zhejiang Province, now enjoy more green 
space and breathe cleaner air than before. 
  Over the past couple of years, the port city has been 
building itself into a "garden port." 
  The area where three rivers which run through the city 
converge has been transformed into a greenland densely covered 
with trees, bushes and grass, from the scene of ruin and 
desolation it presented only seven years ago. 
  While the focus of the greening project was on the river 
banks, trees have also been planted along more than 240 roads. 
Small greenery has also been added at more than 40 street 
corners. 
  There were only five little parks in 1978. Now the city has 
17 parks, including a zoo.

  [Text] Lhasa, March 24 (XINHUA) -- The Tibet Autonomous 
Region has devoted great efforts to protecting the wildlife in 
recent years. 
  To protect wild animals in Tibet, known as "the roof of the 
world," the regional government set up the Tibet Regional 
Association for Wildlife Protection in 1991 and issued "Tibet 
Autonomous Region's Regulations for Implementation of `The 
Wildlife Protection Law of the People's Republic of China'" in 
1992. 
  An official of the association said that Tibet is one of the 
regions rich in wildlife resources. There are more than 5,700 
plant species, 2,300 species of insects, 64 kinds of fish, 488 
kinds of birds and 142 species of mammals native to the region. 
  Tibet is also the habitat for 125 kinds of rare wild animals 
on the state's list for protection. 
  In recent years, Tibet has set up 13 nature reserves for 
protecting 10,000 wild yaks, more than 50,000 wild donkeys, 
about 50,000 Tibetan antelopes, 650 golden monkeys, 1,500 
black-necked cranes and 3,000 takins, a type of wild cow found 
in Tibet. 
  Liu Wulin, deputy general secretary of the Tibet Regional 
Association for Wildlife Protection, says the effort shows that 
most Tibetans realize the importance of protecting wildlife. 
  He said that with the joint efforts of the government and 
the 
people, the total rare animal resources have increased by 30 
percent.

  [Text] Yichang, March 28 (XINHUA) -- Since February this 
year, China has started work to harness a dangerous rock 
formation within the Three Gorges area on the middle reaches of 
the Chang Jiang River where a huge water-control project is to 
be built. 
  Containment measures are being pursued with the aim of 
ensuring safe navigation through the Three Gorges area and 
protecting the projected reservoir. 
  The rockface, nicknamed the "Huangla Stone" with a total 
volume of 40 million cu m, is located at the juncture of the 
Xiling and Xixia gorges and is only 64 km away from the area 
where the gigantic water control dam is to be built. 
  According to experts, the rocky outcrop is the most 
dangerous 
spot in the Three Gorges, with increasingly frequent slippage 
and poor stability in the main body of the rock heightening 
concerns over the past few years. Extended rains or a jarring 
earthquake in the region would be likely to cause the Huangla 
Stone to fall into the Chang Jiang River, triggering waves as 
high as 20-80 m to surge along the river. 
  Moreover, if the rock happens to break loose, it will not 
only destroy the Badong County seat and nearby villages and 
farmland, but also block the entire navigable route of the 
Yangtze, bringing navigation of ships in the area to a 
standstill. In addition, several million tons of silt may 
follow the landslide into the Yangtze, further worsening water 
pollution in the river, said the experts. 
  The State Council, China's central government, has attached 
great attention to the harnessing of the dangerous rock. Before 
the official launching of containment work, experts from nine 
national organizations were recruited to carry out research on 
the feasibility of harnessing the rock. 
  According to Qu Xingyuan, chief of the headquarters in 
charge 
of Huangla Stone harnessing, they have adopted the method of 
building drainage projects on the surface of the ground and 
below the ground, in a bid to improve and enhance the stability 
of the rock. 
  In nearby areas where landslides are most likely to occur, 
facilities with the functions of holding water back from the 
surfaces and draining water from inside have also been built to 
forestall landslides. 
  So far, more than 500 workers have taken on the harnessing 
work, digging out 5,500 cu m of earth and building 2,300 m of 
drainage canals. The first-phase harnessing work is expected to 
be completed in May.

  [Text] Beijing, March 25 (XINHUA) -- China's "Agenda 21," 
a white paper on population, environment and development in the 
21st century, was approved by the State Council today. 
  The agenda was discussed and adopted at the 16th Executive 
Meeting of the State Council presided over by Premier Li Peng. 
  China is the first country to have worked out and adopted 
its 
own "Agenda 21," proposed by the United Nations at the Rio de 
Janeiro summit meeting in June 1992. 
  At the summit, Premier Li Peng promised to carry out the UN 
agenda and other documents adopted at the meeting. 
  China initiated and sponsored the ministerial meeting on 
environment and development for developing countries in June 
1991. 
  The "Agenda 21" was worked out by 52 departments under the 
State Council, including the State Planning Commission and the 
State Science and Technology Commission. 
  The "Agenda" expounds China's strategy, policy and measures 
to secure harmonious and sustainable development out of the 
milieu of the economy, resources, environment, population, 
education and other social factors. 
  The "Agenda" will also be an important directory document 
for 
China in making its mid- and long-term economic and social 
development plans. It will form an important part of the goals 
and content of the Ninth Five-Year (1995-2000) and the 2010 
plans. 
  The "Agenda" made clear the position and actual action of 
the 
Chinese Government in implementing the UN Agenda 21. 
  Today's meeting of the State Council also adopted an outline 
program of state industrial policies for the 1990's.

<F P=106> [By Chris Yeung in Beijing] </F>
  [Text] A new political row has blown up between China and 
Hong Kong -- this time over plans to dump sewage in Zhuhai 
waters. China said the government had acted irresponsibly and 
had misled the public over the $12 billion sewage treatment 
project. It said the project should not have been given the 
go-ahead without consultation with the Sino-British Joint 
Liaison Group (JLG). 
  A Hong Kong and Macao Affairs Office official said, if it 
went ahead, the urgent task of solving the territory's worsening 
water pollution would run into trouble. "We have already 
demanded the issue be discussed at the coming JLG full meeting," 
he said. 
  "The British side said they can go ahead with phase one of 
the project that will be completed before 1997 and will only 
discuss with us the second phase that straddles 1997." 
  "But does that make sense? The project cannot be cut in two. 
It should be considered as a whole." 
  "We are not trying to block the project. We do want 
immediately to do something to stop further pollution of the 
waters in Victoria Harbour. The worsening pollution has not 
only caused red tide in Hong Kong but also poisoned aquatic 
products in the Pearl River Delta region," he said. "Government 
officials were misleading the public when they said we had no 
dissenting views on the project," the official said. Rather, he 
said, the Chinese were surprised by the decision of the 
government to launch the project with the recent award of a 
contract involving hundreds of millions of dollars. 
  The government said yesterday that China had not been 
formally consulted on the project because a preliminary survey 
was being carried out with the help of mainland authorities to 
see whether the project was technically feasible and 
environmentally acceptable. "We are not yet in a position to 
apply to the Chinese side for construction of the second phase 
of the project," said Principal Assistant Secretary for 
Environment Chang King-yiu. 
  If the government could confirm that there were good grounds 
to go ahead with phase two of the project, it would officially 
apply to the Chinese side to conduct a joint environmental 
impact study. Under the strategic sewage disposal scheme, the 
government expected the facility to extend beyond the southern 
side of Hong Kong waters. "The final alignment has yet to be 
decided," she said. 
  According to the mainland official, the project envisaged a 
huge marine underwater pipeline with a total length of dozens of 
kilometres to be built linking Stonecutters Island with 
Tangangdao in Zhuhai. At least several hundreds of tonnes of 
sewage would be discharged into the waters off the Tangangdao. 
"Some people in Hong Kong have already criticised that as an 
unethical project. Discharging the sewage water in your 
neighbours' place is simply unreasonable," he said. According 
to international law, a government wanting to build a pipeline 
in another country's waters has to seek that country's consent. 
  The official said the Hong Kong and Macao Affairs Office has 
organised a team of researchers to examine the issue including 
the hydrology of the Pearl River Delta. Some basic studies on 
the treatment of sewage in the territory have already been 
completed, he said. The official claimed that the Chinese 
Government proposed in August last year the issue of conducting 
a detailed feasibility study on the sewage project and the 
corresponding assessment on its environmental impact be put on 
the agenda of the JLG. He said the British side agreed to do so 
only early this month, but soon granted contracts for the 
project.

  [Text] Niigata, March 22 KYODO -- A Russian-registered 
oceanographic survey ship left here Tuesday [22 March] on a 
mission to monitor the effects on the Sea of Japan of 
radioactive waste dumping by a vessel of the Russian Pacific 
Fleet last year, Japanese Government officials said. 
  The dispatch of the 4,162-ton Okean by Japan, Russia and 
South Korea was called for by a conference of scientists held in 
the Russian far east city of Vladivostok last month. 
  The Okean carries nine Japanese Government officials and 27 
scientists from South Korea, Russia and the Vienna-based 
International Atomic Energy Agency. 
  The voyage is the first joint research effort by the three 
countries to study whether the sea is contaminated by 
radioactivity. 
  Seawater and seabed sediment samples will be collected by 
the 
Okean at seven points and measured for radioactivity, the 
officials said. 
  The Russian Navy on October 16 and 17 last year dumped 900 
tons of liquid nuclear waste in the Sea of Japan. A planned 
second dumping was canceled following protests from Japan and 
South Korea.

  [Text] Tokyo, March 22 KYODO -- China's Forestry Minister 
Xu Youfang will visit Japan in May for talks on Japan's request 
for the loan of a pair of ibis for breeding, Prime Minister 
Morihiro Hosokawa told reporters during his return flight from 
China to Tokyo. 
  Hosokawa made the request for the birds to Chinese Premier 
Li 
Peng on Sunday [20 March]. 
  Hosokawa told Li there is only one pair of ibis left in 
Japan 
and they are too old for artificial breeding, Japanese officials 
said. 
  He asked China to lend Japan a pair for breeding as there 
are 
some 40 captive ibis in China that have either artificially or 
naturally produced offspring, they said. 
  Hosokawa said State Planning Commission head Chen Jinhua 
told 
him on Monday morning in Beijing that China will dispatch the 
forestry minister, who is also in charge of environmental 
issues, to Japan in May for talks with his Japanese counterparts. 
  Chen expressed China's readiness to help on the ibis 
breeding 
issue as a way of promoting China-Japan friendship and 
environmental cooperation, Hosokawa said.

  [Text] The United Nations Framework Convention on Climate 
Change (UNFCCC), designed to prevent the greenhouse effect which 
causes global warming, formally went into effect yesterday. 
  Since virtually all types of industrial and other commercial 
fuel give off carbon gases, South Korean stands to be hit hard 
by the convention, especially with the massive number of cars 
and conventional heating systems. 
  The convention, which currently has 51 signatory countries, 
is aimed at curbing the emission of carbon dioxide and other 
greenhouse gases on a gradual basis throughout the world. 
  South Korea became a signatory to the convention last 
December as the 46th country to do so and the convention, should 
it be in the near future be regarded as an advanced country, 
could pose as a serious problem. 
  According to officials of the Foreign Ministry's Science 
Environment Section, the main cause of global warming has been 
identified as carbon dioxide and the convention reflects 
advanced countries' eagerness to halt further change in the 
climate, especially in terms of temperature. 
  However, there has already been sharp criticism from 
developing countries on pressure for them to join up since they 
believe that most of the greenhouse effects have been caused by 
advanced countries themselves. 
  "Although it is difficult to determine who is actually 
responsible for the changes in climate resulting from pollution, 
chances are that they began long before industrialization 
actually began to take place in countries which are currently 
classified as developing, including Korea," one official noted. 
  Developing countries realize that the emission of carbon 
dioxide and other greenhouse gases is inevitable in the process 
of further industrialization and they have been demanding 
differential treatment. 
  For Korea, however, the problem is not so simple. It is 
scheduled to apply for admission to the OECD (Organization for 
Economic Cooperation and development) in 1996 and it would have 
to express greater willingness to conform to the standards in 
advanced countries. 
  Statistically, the per capita emission of carbon dioxide was 
measured at about 1.6 tons in 1990, considerably less than the 
2.4 tons in Japan and 5.8 tons in the United States. 
  Since the convention stipulates that countries in group one, 
in which Korea is not yet included, must reduce the level of 
emission to that in 1990 by the year 2000, which would be an 
enormous task for the government and industry. 
  The non-law-binding convention seeks to establish the basic 
guidelines for the reduction of greenhouse gases and deal with 
problems relating to the provision of financial and 
technological assistance to developing countries. 
  Advanced signatory countries are obliged to obtain an exact 
estimate of the existing emission volume of the pertinent gases 
and report it to the convention's negotiating committee along 
with specific timetable for their reduction. 
  Developing countries, on the other hand, have a period of 
three years to do the same although they have been insisting 
that their timetable would depend on the extent of financial and 
technological assistance from advanced countries.

  [Text] Seoul, March 24 (YONHAP) -- South Korea will uphold 
the amendment to the global agreement on protecting the ozone 
layer this June pushing up the date banning all use of 
chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs), the Foreign Ministry said Thursday. 
  The Copenhagen Amendment to the Montreal Protocol, signed by 
20 countries, goes into effect June 14 and South Korea will 
submit to the amendment soon afterwards, the ministry said. 
  The revised version sets down an earlier date to eliminate 
all use of chemicals destructive to the ozone layer such as CFCs 
and halon. 
  These chemicals are used as coolants in refrigerators and 
air 
conditioners. CFC use will be banned as of Jan. 1, 1996, while 
use of halon was to cease Jan. 1 this year. 
  South Korea, however, belongs to the developing nation 
category and is exempt from these deadlines. The Copenhagen 
Amendment excludes a ban date for developing countries and 
members are to decide next year on another set of guidelines.

  [Text] Tokyo, March 25 (YONHAP) -- South Korean President 
Kim Yong-sam proposed Thursday [24 March] that his country, 
Japan and China work together to control environmental pollution 
and promote joint study of oriental medicine and other projects. 
  Kim made the proposal during a breakfast meeting at the 
guest 
house with Korean correspondents stationed here. 
  Declaring that Korea, Japan and China are the three most 
important nations in Asia, Kim said they must undertake joint 
study of their common culture based on Chinese characters. 
  As China is rapidly undergoing industrialization, Kim said 
the Yangtse River, which runs into the West Sea, is becoming 
more polluted and the three countries must tackle the problem 
immediately. The Chinese Government has already agreed to his 
proposal at the working level, Kim said.

  [Text] PRIVATE companies seeking to participate in Laotian 
hydroelectricity projects may be rejected if they do not provide 
adequate planning for environmental conservation, Laotian PM's 
Office Minister Phao Bounnaphon said in Vientiane. 
  With 10 new hydroelectric dam projects planned, which aim to 
produce about 1,300 MW of electricity at a cost of billions of 
dollars, the issue of preserving the environment and avoiding 
the mistakes of the past is becoming more important to Laos, he 
said. 
  Feasibility studies for most of the projects have been 
completed. Most of their output will be sold to Vietnam and 
Thailand. The investment cost per unit of hydroelectric power 
is lower than that of plants using other types of fuel. 
  Mr Phao said Laos will be a significant energy source in 
Southeast Asia because it has enormous mineral deposits and 
potential for hydroelectric power. Laos aims to protect its 
forests, so only private firms that want to protect and revive 
the environment will be welcome. 
  Vatthana Pathoumvan, manager of the Electricite Du Laos 
(EDL) 
hydroelectric station at Nam Ngum, said feasibility studies will 
be completed next year, so no details are yet available. 
  However, he said, construction depends on the demand for 
electricity in neighbouring countries, especially Thailand. Of 
the 220 MW of hydroelectric power generated by Laos, 70 percent 
is sold to Thailand. 
  Apart from the Sedone I and II projects in Pakse province, 
which are being undertaken by Korean firms, Thai MDX Co is 
undertaking feasibility studies of the Nam Ngum II and III 
projects. 
  The executive manager of EDL, Ungreun Pakan, said the 
Laotian 
Government is concerned about environmental problems because it 
had trouble during the first stage of Nam Ngum I. 
  However, Laos is lucky that it has low population growth, so 
the government has no problems moving people to make way for 
construction of power plants, he claimed.

  [Text] Papua New Guinea's [PNG] Minister for Forest Tim 
Neville says foreign logging companies smuggled about $120 
million worth of tropical timber out of the country during 1992. 
He made the claim at a seminar in Lae for visiting Queensland 
businessmen, while outlining his plans to ban tropical log 
exports from PNG by the year 2000. Sean Dorney reports that Mr. 
Neville said these plans will include paying up to about $6 
million a year for monitoring of exports. 
  [Begin recording] Dorney: The forest minister 
said Papua New Guinea was about to engage the Swedish 
surveillance company, SGS, to monitor all PNG's log exports. 
Mr. Neville said SGS did similar work in 27 other countries and 
the cost would be more than covered by the revenue that he said 
was being currently stolen by unscrupulous foreign logging 
companies. He said the officials figured the log exports in 
1992 accounted for only about two-thirds of what his department 
estimated was felled and shipped away. 
  Neville: So in 1992 alone, we lost in the order 
of about 700,000 cubic meters of timber, which if we work that 
out on current log exports price, they are averaging 170 kina 
[PNG currency] per cubic meter. 
  Dorney: That amounted to about US $120 million.

<F P=106> [By Hao Hsue-ching and Y. C. Tsai] </F>
  [Text] Geneva, March 21 (CNA) -- The Convention on 
International Trade in Endangered Species (CITES) will decide 
whether to call for trade sanctions against Taiwan on March 25, 
CITES Standing Committee Chairman Murray Hosking said Monday [21 
March]. 
  Hosking pointed out that the committee, which opened its 
meeting in Geneva Monday, will discuss on Tuesday the alleged 
trade in rhino horn and tiger bone in Taiwan, Mainland China, 
Hong Kong, South Korea, and Yemen. 
  Hosking pledged that the committee would take into account 
Taiwan's progress in wildlife protection before making a final 
decision on trade sanctions. 
  Taiwan police reportedly visited 519 herbal medicine stores 
out of 8,000 on the island March 15-17 and found seven selling 
rhino horn powder and 27 selling tiger bone. 
  The findings run counter to allegations by Britain's 
Environmental Investigation Agency (EIA), which claimed that 
rhino horn powder and tiger bone are still available at more 
than half of all Chinese medicine shops in Taiwan. 
  Meanwhile, during a meeting of non-government organizations 
(NGO) following the CITES Standing Committee meeting on Monday, 
EIA aired a 20-minute videotape which said more than 90 percent 
of the rhinoceros killed in South Africa were for the Taiwan 
market. 
  The Earth Island Institute (EII) and the World Wildlife Fund 
also said Taiwan, Mainland China, Hong Kong, South Korea, and 
Yemen conduct trade in illegal wildlife products. 
  Li San-wei, deputy director of the Forestry Department under 
Taiwan's Council of Agriculture and leader of the Taiwan 
delegation to the NGO meeting, noted that he was unable to rebut 
EIA's accusation as he spoke before the videotape was shown. 
  "How could they verify their claims," Li asked. 
  Another delegation member, Chairman Ted Ting of the 
Beautiful 
Taiwan Foundation, worried that the shocking videotape would 
increase the chances that Taiwan will be slapped with CITES 
sanctions. 
  Moreover, Ting noted, any CITES decision will strongly 
influence the United States, which will make a similar decision 
next month. 
  In order to avoid an economic boycott, Taiwan will ask 
delegates from other countries to help defend its wildlife 
conservation efforts at the CITES Standing Committee's Tuesday 
meeting, Li said. 
  As a non-CITES member, Taiwan could only attend the 
EIA-sponsored NGO meeting.

  [Text] Taipei, March 23 (CNA) -- The Republic of China 
[ROC] will never accept the Convention on International Trade in 
Endangered Species (CITES) decision to refer to Taiwan as 
"Taiwan, China," Foreign Affairs Minister Chien Fu said 
Wednesday [23 March]. 
  Chien was responding to reports from Geneva saying that the 
CITES Standing Committee has yielded to Beijing's pressure and 
decided to refer to Taiwan as "Taiwan, China" in its report on 
wildlife conservation on the island. 
  "Such a decision is ridiculous," Chien said, stressing that 
Taiwan is a separate political entity and has never been ruled 
by Chinese communist authorities. 
  Chien said Beijing's intention to downgrade the ROC in the 
international arena by suggesting the use of such a designation 
in the CITES report would only worsen relations across the 
Taiwan Strait and would not alter the fact that Taiwan is a 
separate political entity. 
  Beijing has consistently claimed sovereignty over Taiwan and 
sought to limit Taiwan's movements on the world stage. 
  The Council of Agriculture (COA), which is in charge of 
wildlife conservation affairs, said it will protest the CITES 
decision. 
  "If CITES does not use our formal national title in its 
report, we hope it can at least refer to us as Chinese Taipei," 
COA Vice Chairman Lin [words indistinct] said.

  [Text] Geneva, March 22 (CNA) -- The chairman of the 
Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species (CITES) 
Standing Committee said Tuesday [22 March] that Taiwan has made 
substantial progress toward wildlife conservation but must 
continue crackdowns on trade in rhino horn and tiger parts. 
  Chairman Murray Hosking, speaking during a meeting of the 
CITES Standing Committee, noted that officials in Taiwan are 
taking wildlife conservation very seriously as evidenced by 
amendments to the Wildlife Conservation Law which significantly 
increase fines and penalties for violators and establishment of 
a wildlife protection unit. 
  He added that CITES was satisfied with the amendments to the 
law, but reserved final comment until an English-language 
translation of the bill is given to the CITES Secretariat. 
  Hosking also said CITES was satisfied that Taiwan is working 
to consolidate government stockpiles of endangered species 
products and has established a database for the registration, 
marking and sizing of confiscated stocks of rhino horn or tiger 
parts.

<F P=106> [By Chang Jer-shong and Y. C. Tsai] </F>
  [Text] Johannesburg, March 22 (CNA) -- South African 
police on Tuesday [22 March] rapped Britain's Environmental 
Investigation Agency (EIA) for falsely accusing a Taiwan 
diplomat of involvement in rhino horn trade. 
  Pieter Lategan, chief of the Endangered Species Protection 
Unit (ESPU) under the South African Police Administration, said 
the Republic of China [ROC] Embassy and the Republic of China's 
National Police Administration have worked closely with the ESPU 
on wildlife protection. 
  None of the embassy officials or vehicles were ever involved 
in rhino horn smuggling, Lategan said. 
  Moreover, he noted, no one from the ESPU has ever been 
interviewed by the EIA. 
  The South African official said he has phoned the EIA to 
express his strong dissatisfaction at the accusations. In 
addition, he has sent a letter to the London-based conservation 
group requesting a detailed explanation of the accusations. 
  During a meeting of nongovernment organizations (NGO) 
following the Standing Committee meeting of the Convention on 
International Trade in Endangered Species (CITES) in Geneva 
Monday, the EIA aired a 20-minute videotape, in which a South 
African policeman charged Taiwan envoys with smuggling rhino 
horns. 
  A statement issued by Taiwan's Ministry of Foreign Affairs 
Tuesday said the man accused of rhino horn smuggling was not a 
diplomat but an Overseas Chinese who once worked as a member of 
the Control Yuan, Taiwan's highest watchdog body. 
  The man, Yen Nuo, was [word indistinct] in South Africa in 
February 1986 for illegally trading in rhino horns, but was 
found not guilty as Yen had a license to sell rhino horns issued 
by the South African Government. 
  Meanwhile, a report from Geneva said the CITES Standing 
Committee has decided to ignore the EIA's accusations.

<F P=106> [By Sofia Wu] </F>
  [Text] Taipei, March 25 (CNA) -- Premier Lien Chan Friday 
[25 March] expressed regret over a preliminary decision by a 
United Nations wildlife conservation organization suggesting its 
members adopt stricter measures against Taiwan for failing to 
eliminate illegal trade in endangered species. 
  Commenting on reports from Geneva saying the UN's Convention 
on International Trade in Endangered Species (CITES) has accused 
Taiwan of failing to crack down on illicit wildlife trade in an 
expedient manner, Lien said the allegation was unfair. 
  "Taiwan has not fallen behind world wildlife conservation 
standards," Lien said. "We hope major world wildlife 
conservation organizations can recognize our efforts in this 
regard." 
  The CITES Secretariat Thursday unveiled a package of 14 
suggestions on how to eliminate rhino horn and tiger bone trade 
in Taiwan, Hong Kong, South Korea, Mainland China and Vietnam. 
  The package generally gave positive, lenient assessments of 
wildlife conservation efforts in Hong Kong, South Korea, 
Mainland China and Vietnam, but took a harsher attitude toward 
Taiwan. 
  It said Taiwan has so far failed to update its conservation 
law, complete consolidation of rhino horn and tiger bone 
stockpiles and totally eliminate rhino horn trade. It thus 
recommended that "all CITES parties implement stricter domestic 
measures against Taiwan, including prohibition of trade in 
wildlife species." 
  The CITES Standing Committee, which is meeting in Geneva, 
will continue to discuss the package Friday afternoon and will 
decide whether to formally recommend trade sanctions on Taiwan 
over conservation issues. 
  Local trade officials said if CITES does call on its members 
to ban wildlife trade with Taiwan, the impact would be minimal. 
  Taiwan's wildlife product trade totals about US $20 million 
annually, according to statistics compiled by the Board of 
Foreign Trade. 
  However, the board pointed out that if the United States 
decides to impose trade sanctions on Taiwan in line with the 
CITES recommendation, the effect would be much greater. 
  The U.S., Taiwan's largest export outlet, could first ban 
wildlife product trade with Taiwan and if Taiwan fails to 
improve crackdowns on illicit wildlife trade within six months, 
the U.S. then could ban imports of other Taiwan products, the 
board said. 
  Meanwhile, Chairman Sun Ming-hsien of the Council of 
Agriculture said Taiwan has made enormous efforts in wildlife 
conservation in recent years. "We'll step up publicity to help 
the world understand our progress in this regard," Sun noted.

  [Text] The United States should separate trade matters from 
issues of human rights, labour rights and the environment, 
according to Deputy Prime Minister Suphachai Panitchaphak. 
  These issues should be left to the international 
organisations that are already dealing with them, Mr Suphachai 
said. 
  Dr Suphachai was speaking at the 21st meeting of the U.S. 
Information Service's annual economic seminar entitled 
"Regionalisation of Thai-U.S. Economic Relations". 
  He told Business Post that it is possible to look at trade 
issues on their own merits by decoupling them from side issues. 
  "Trade should be treated on its own merits, linked with real 
macroeconomic issues, and side issues that are now coupled with 
trade such as human rights, workers' rights and the environment 
should be left to international organisations that are already 
dealing with them," he said. 
  He said a country that is trying to achieve greater economic 
development will try its best to improve standards of human 
rights and labour relations. 
  "Through trade development expansion we can facilitate the 
process of paying adequate attention to human rights 
development," he said. 
  If some of the major side issues are put in the forefront, 
such as the U.S. linking of the Generalized System of 
Preferences with labour rights, it may not bring results in the 
end, he said. 
  The GSP was conceived to help developing countries' exports 
by granting concession terms, and is not supposed to be linked 
with anything, he said. 
  He said he understood the good intentions of the U.S. 
administration which has a sense of humanity and is justifiably 
concerned with rights. 
  But he questioned whether its policy is the most effective 
way of conditioning the whole world to move in that direction. 
  Dr Suphachai said the more we want to promote trade and 
economic relations throughout the world the more we must work 
toward depoliticising trade issues. 
  This will benefit not only the private sector but also the 
newly emerging countries, as at least world economic growth will 
be more predictable than in the past, he said. 
  Dr Sean Randolph, the managing director of RSR Pacific 
Group, 
a consulting firm specialising in business development in Asia, 
Latin America and the Pacific, presented a report on a U.S. 
perspective on the Asia Pacific economy. 
  Dr Randolph, the former international director-general of 
the 
Pacific Basin Economic Council, said after the seminar that the 
U.S. may not be able to take full advantage of the tremendous 
growth potential of Asia if the U.S. does not extend 
Most-Favoured-Nation trading status to China. 
  The extension of MFN will help China get equal treatment 
from 
the U.S. with other members of the General Agreement on Tariffs 
and Trade, he said. 
  U.S. President Bill Clinton must certify to Congress by June 
3 that China is making "significant overall progress" on human 
rights before deciding to extend MFN to China for a further year. 
  Dr Randolph said the US business community strongly supports 
the extension of MFN to China. 
  The American Chamber of Commerce in Beijing estimates that 
167,000 American high-technology jobs are linked to exports to 
China. 
  U.S. law should be changed to completely decouple the issues 
of trade and human rights, Dr Randolph said. 
  "I personally share the U.S. business community's view that 
engagement with the Chinese and expansion of the market economy 
is a more effective means of improving human rights than the 
laying down of political markers," he said. 
  He addressed the issue of the U.S. Trade Representative's 
recent suspension for six months of its formal workers' rights 
review in order to give the Indonesian government time to 
implement adopted labor regulations and to take future measures 
in the labour field. 
  He said the US business community wants the U.S. Government 
to continue granting GSP to Indonesia unconditionally. 
  Asia is becoming an interesting region for the U.S. because 
of its rapid growth in terms of real trade and investment. 
Asia's share of global commerce has doubled from 7.5 percent to 
14 percent over the past decade. 
  The economic growth of countries in the region, excluding 
the 
U.S. and Japan, is expected to be 5.9 percent this year 
according to the Pacific Economic Cooperation Council. 
  Asia is important to U.S. business for many reasons, 
including the massive demand for infrastructure, electricity 
generation, telecommunications and aircraft, particularly in 
China. 
  Retailing has great potential because consumer spending in 
Asia is expected to grow three times faster than Europe or the 
U.S. 
  The potential for investment in China, which has now become 
the world's fourth "growth pole" after Europe, North America and 
Japan, is great. 
  The capitalisation growth of regional stock exchanges, 
excluding Japan and China, is expected to be US $3.3 trillion by 
2000, up 433 percent on today's level. 
  However, Dr Randolph pointed out that Asia faces difficult 
issues including political crisis, the policies of the big 
economies like the U.S. or Japan the mismanagement of the 
nuclear issue in Korea, and the possible suspension of MFN 
status to China.

<F P=106> [Staff report: "Bulgaria, Turkey To Mutually Inform Each </F>
Other About Nuclear Accidents"] 
  [Text] An agreement on exchanging operational information 
regarding nuclear installations is to be signed between Bulgaria 
and Turkey. The negotiations related to the agreement have been 
completed. The draft agreement was approved by the Council of 
Ministers in 1991. It will positively affect bilateral 
relations with Turkey and will serve as the basis of cooperating 
in utilizing nuclear energy, the experts of the Committee on 
Peaceful Use of Nuclear Energy think. 
  The Ministry of Foreign Affairs, the Environment Ministry, 
the National Electricity Company, and the Kozloduy Nuclear Power 
Plant have already conveyed their recommendations and have 
approved the agreement. It will be identical to the agreement 
with Greece, which has been signed and ratified. 
  The agreement does not relate to admissible concentrations 
of 
radioactive substances according to the national norms. Once a 
year the sides will exchange information about radioactive 
particles which have found their way into the environment. 
There will be a one-time exchange of information regarding the 
nuclear installations. However, the validity of this 
information will be confirmed every January.

<F P=106> [Interview with Erzsebet Schmuck, cochairman of the Green </F>
Alternative Party, by Daniel Bodnar; place and date not given: 
"The Concept of the Green Alternative: Natural Harmony"] 
  [Text] The Green Alternative Party [ZA] was established on 
Environmental Protection Day on 5 June 1993. The creation of 
this party was justified by the fact that the Hungarian Green 
Party kept drifting to the right and, therefore, the 
environmental and nature protection movements in Hungary 
distanced themselves from this party. The fact that the 
Federation of European Green Parties accepted the ZA among its 
members represents an appreciation for the party's activity so 
far. We interviewed Erzsebet Schmuck, cochairman of the ZA. 
  Bodnar: What is the goal of your party? 
  Schmuck: Our main goal is to send an adequate 
number of deputies into Parliament and, later, also to the 
self-government bodies. It is extremely important to create a 
so-called green control at all legislative levels. 
Unfortunately, the cause of environmental protection has been 
forced into the background as against various interests in the 
past four years, in spite of the fact that, earlier, the current 
parliamentary parties promised something else. It is perhaps 
sufficient to mention the fact that a new and modern 
environmental protection law has not been submitted to 
Parliament to this very day; the obsolete law legislated in 1976 
is still valid in Hungary. 
  Bodnar: Would you give some details about your 
program? 
  Schmuck: We have a comprehensive and complex 
program, one that does not only aim at solving environmental 
problems in the narrow sense of the word, but it also covers all 
areas of economic and social life. For example, the fact that 
we are also dealing with social issues is automatically 
connected with the fact that the roots of environmental problems 
are to be found in the economy itself and in the people's 
lifestyle and customs. Our party is striving to discover and 
treat the causes, rather than carry out symptomatic treatment. 
The basic principle of our program is to recreate a harmony 
between man and nature. The present and future key issue is how 
we can coordinate the economic and ecological interests. An 
increasing number of people and politicians find this need, 
because the exploitation of natural resources is so widespread 
today that is could actually become a factor hindering economic 
development. The serious recession all over the world and the 
serious economic problems today can also be traced to this 
circle of problems. 
  Bodnar: Many people regard your ideas as a 
utopia.... 
  Schmuck: People should read our program published 
in the Election Bulletin. Many people called us up recently and 
told us that the public indeed formed the opinion about the ZA 
that we were following a utopia but, after reading our program, 
they support us because, in their opinion, our ideas are 
realistic and offer a solution that would make survival 
possible, namely to slowly find the way out of the crisis, to 
build an environment-friendly economy and society. We think 
that the seriousness of this problem will force everyone to move 
in this direction. I am convinced that our program is realistic 
and even viable. 
  Bodnar: How do you explain the fact that, 
contrary to Western Europe, the greens failed to make themselves 
properly known in Hungary? 
  Schmuck: This is not quite true, because a lot of 
deputies got into Parliament via the Danube-movement. It is a 
fact, however, that, since the change in the regime, the various 
environmental protection movements have not been able to 
strengthen to the extent desired by this serious problem. This 
is also connected to the fact that, contrary to the promises, 
the civil organizations did not get the support and 
infrastructural background needed for their operation. No 
matter how many volunteers there are in the environmental 
protection movements, they still need minimal conditions 
necessary for their activity, and they lack these conditions. 
For example, only a few Hungarian environmental protection 
movements have an office to work from. This is a serious 
problem. 
  Bodnar: Which parliamentary party is close to you? 
  Schmuck: Our relations with the parliamentary 
parties is proportional with their treatment of the 
environmental issues. The ZA is a party free of ideology. We 
have values close to the left, the liberals, and the 
conservatives. At the same time, there are trends in all these 
three directions that we reject. We are moving in a fourth 
axis, and we do not belong to any main stream. 
  Bodnar: What election results do you count on? 
  Schmuck: I would like to mention the fact that 
most non-parliamentary parties have very little chance of 
reaching the 5-percent threshold because they lack financial 
resources. However, we will definitely be able to come up with 
a national list. I would also like to mention the fact that 
Karoly Javor, a parliamentary deputy of the Hungarian Democratic 
Forum [MDF], will run in the elections as an independent 
representing the ZA. We know that our chances are minimal, but 
we hope we will obtain more than 1 percent of the votes. Our 
making it into parliament depends on the extent to which the 
citizens vote for a so-called green future.

<F P=106> [Article by Eduardo Calvo Sans: "The Enemy Is Argentina"; </F>
first paragraph is LA PRENSA introduction] 
  [Excerpts] While all sorts of hazardous materials circulate 
throughout the world, here in Argentina we still do not know 
what to do with our own wastes or how to control them. 
  Argentina is supposedly safe from hazardous wastes coming 
from other countries. In principle, a controversial law (24.051) 
bans this, though some environmentalists say that its later 
enacting regulation (Decree 831/93) leaves open a window through 
which some wastes could be introduced, disguised as industrial 
components. 
  It is a fact that throughout the world such materials are 
"roaming around" in search of storage sites. It is the duty of 
the authorities to keep their eyes open and their pockets shut. 
[passage omitted] 
  For Argentina, the enemy is within. 
  Generators of hazardous wastes and unscrupulous waste 
disposal contractors cannot be controlled. The unevenness of 
legislation throughout Argentina, the inadequacy of the 
organizations that are supposed to conduct controls, and the 
lack of industrial facilities to process these materials place 
the population at serious risk. 
  Tragic isolated events may suddenly make the problem 
obvious. 
The widespread feeling among specialists is that Argentina is 
living on a time bomb, and there are no legal or political 
mechanisms to dismantle this bomb.

<F P=106> [Article by Eduardo Calvo Sans: "Prioritizing Environmental </F>
Legislation"] 
  [Text] With the elections for convention delegates 
approaching, there is speculation in the environmental community 
about how the issue of the environment will be dealt with in the 
new Constitution. At least for now, apart from official 
statements, this concern is not getting any answers from 
politicians. 
  The law requiring a partial reform of the National 
Constitution (24.309), resulting from the Menem-Alfonsin accord, 
leaves the issue open, but no agreements have been reached about 
addressing it. 
  Given the present paralysis on the hazardous wastes law 
because of the refusal by some provinces to adhere to a 
standardized legal system covering the entire nation, nobody in 
the political arena dares think that the "federal plan" may be 
incompatible with this new situation. The statement has been 
heard that "it is politically unworkable to demand that the 
provinces turn over control of the environment to the national 
government." 
  In recent statements, criminal law expert Miguel Angel 
Aguilera has emphasized the need to "prioritize the 
environmental system by granting it adequate protection in our 
Constitution" and by criminalizing actions detrimental to the 
environment. He described environmental crimes as "white collar" 
crimes. 
  The legal specialist said that "with the exception of some 
types of water pollution (which is, par excellence, the old 
environmental crime), in general Latin American criminal codes 
lack provisions designed to protect the environment." 
  Earlier Aguilera had said that "Argentine society, acting 
through its institutions and nonprofit foundations or 
organizations, has expressed its concern." He then urged members 
of Congress to respond to this concern by enacting legislation. 
  As the constitutional reform approaches, Aguilera cited the 
examples of Panama and Spain. Their constitutions speak of the 
"state's fundamental duty to ensure that the population lives in 
a healthy environment free of pollutants, where the air, water, 
and foods fulfill the requirements for the adequate pursuit of 
human life." 
  Aguilera's statements reflect a "principle-based" concern 
that is common in the environmental community. But some analysts 
want our new Constitution to contain more than just a formal 
statement. 
  Although later laws will actually enact regulations and 
implement the principles defined in the Constitution, the new 
"Magna Carta" should be explicit in one aspect: it should not 
contain any elements that might become obstacles to 
environmental protection. 
  As an example: the rigid federalism of our present 
Constitution has become an insurmountable obstacle, blocking 
adequate legislation on the management of "hazardous wastes," 
something which is absolutely essential from this time forward.

<F P=106> [Commentary by announcer Carlos Mesa] </F>
  [Text] The brief visit [by U.S. Vice President Al Gore] -- 
like all visits by U.S. personalities, who never have enough 
time for a small country like ours, or even for countries like 
Argentina and Brazil, for which there are but a couple of hours 
in the middle of a huge show -- has left us some lessons. 
  The U.S. Vice President -- in this regard we agree with some 
of the viewpoints that were raised by the press today -- 
probably gave us two messages. On the one hand, the U.S. 
position on the antinarcotics fight has not budged an inch. 
There have been neither essential nor substantive changes 
between the Bush and Clinton administrations. 
  The U.S. ambassador soon realized that the coca leaf garland 
[given to Gore upon getting off the plane] was a hot issue, and 
asked the vice president to get rid of it. Gore wore it for 
barely a few seconds. This clearly shows the U.S. position. 
Drug trafficking, coca, and production remain vital and 
essential and, unfortunately, decisive factors in bilateral 
relations. 
  Yet a second, positive message, in which we may find the 
most 
important point of this visit, is that sustainable development, 
the environment, and the preservation of ecological balance in a 
region that is so important as the Amazonas, is of the utmost 
importance for the United States, and especially for the U.S. 
vice president. 
  In Santa Cruz, Gore ratified his support for the 
construction 
of a gas pipeline to Sao Paulo, Brazil, for conveying clean 
energy for that very important Latin American city. He also 
supported a set of projects that could become an option. 
  I do not know whether the development of ecology, or rather 
I 
should say the preservation of the environment, will become as 
important as the coca issue. I don't believe so. Yet it is a 
point on the agenda that can produce some changes, or give a 
different touch to this dreadful and conditioned relation that 
coca has produced between Bolivia and the United States.

<F P=106> [Article by Francisca Stella Fraga from Sao Paulo] </F>
  [Text] As of June 1992, when the UN Conference on 
Environment and Development -- Rio '92 -- approved Agenda 21 
that establishes that the rich countries must supply new 
resources in favorable conditions to developing countries so 
they can protect the environment, the Brazilian Government's 
strategy for negotiating external financing in this sector 
became based on that principle. Meanwhile, organizations such as 
the World Bank continue to insist on traditional financing 
criteria for releasing resources for environmental projects. 
  This criteria has been one of the most serious obstacles to 
implementing projects that follow the Rio '92 objectives to open 
the way for sustainable development, according to Pedro Mota 
Coelho, chief of Itamaraty's Environment Division. The demand 
that Brazil put up matching funds for the financing of 
environmental projects that is systematically imposed by the 
World Bank is an evident example that the bank is using 
traditional credit mechanisms. According to Mota Coelho, the 
demand goes against the guidelines contained in Agenda 21, 
especially in the cases in which the World Bank acts as an 
intermediary in obtaining resources from the rich countries, 
such as the case of resources for the Ozone Fund, which was 
created to finance projects for preventing the destruction of 
the earth's ozone layer. 
  "The release of resources must have a better flow," Mota 
Coelho said. "It is clear that we must do our lessons at home, 
and that is what we are doing." 
  And it is this effort that is being incorporated into the 
task of a group being coordinated by the Planning Secretariat of 
the presidency, in other words, Seplan [Secretariat of Planning 
and Coordination of the Presidency of the Republic] -- which 
involves the Environment, Finance, and Foreign Ministries, among 
others -- was created in order to specifically simplify the 
forms and mechanisms for the reception of external resources. 
"At this stage, even the reception of donations is very 
difficult," Mota Coelho said. 
<H5>  Denmark </H5>
  This is why Environment Minister Rubens Ricupero frequently 
has repeated during financing negotiations that Brazil is not 
Denmark. If it was, then its institutions would function 
magnificently and the public organizations involved in the 
environmental field would be perfectly structured to comply with 
their functions. But even if this was true, financing would not 
be necessary either. Among its numerous shortcomings, Brazil 
needs resources in order to improve its organizations. 
<H5>  Guideline Changes </H5>
  Environment Ministry executive secretary Sergio Silva do 
Amaral stressed that Brazil's environmental sector has had 
considerable changes in guidelines during the past few years and 
this has caused a major lack of stability. The Ibama [Brazilian 
Institute for the Environment and Renewable Natural Resources], 
which was created in 1989, has had nine presidents in a 
four-year period; and the Environment Secretariat and the 
Environment Ministry also have changed chiefs fives times since 
1992. In addition, Ibama does not have the resources to handle 
complex international negotiations. Four hundred technicians 
were trained recently to handle this, he stated. 
  Amaral also stated that the federal government's budget 
restrictions do not help in releasing matching funds for 
financing. This even affected the National Environment Program, 
the PNMA, which was instituted precisely in order to improve the 
public administration's efficiency in the environmental field. 
The PNMA is now 36 months old but has only received regular 
budgetary resources for the past 17 months. According to the 
PNMA, the government is restructuring in order to improve its 
evaluation of the specific situation of each project in order to 
prevent this from continuing. 
<H5>  Simplifying Problems </H5>
  According to Amaral, another effort that has been made is 
that of seeking an understanding with the government's economic 
sector in order to simplify the procedures for the release of 
external resources. He states that there has been progress 
regarding the mechanisms of the National Environment Fund 
(FNMA), which is financed by the Inter-American Development Bank 
(IDB). The economic sector's green light for the use of 
resources was so delayed that at times it passed from one fiscal 
year to the next year and this demanded new agreements, within 
an infinite process of bureaucratic actions, for the use of the 
resources. 
  Amaral now says it is possible to use the balance from one 
fiscal year to the next year without signing new agreements. 
  He also stresses that the World Bank itself is contributing 
to the delay in approving projects. It has the habit of 
delaying in order to evaluate and name consultants. In 
addition, the projects are revised very frequently. This why 
the Brazilian Government has suggested that the World Bank also 
should adopt more rapid measures where it is concerned. 
  The external resources the Brazilian Government has 
negotiated for the environmental field are divided into four 
areas: 
  Amazon Pilot Project. To be financed by the seven richest 
nations in the World -- the Group of 7 -- for the preservation 
of Brazil's tropical forests. The initial provision made in 
1990, when the project was approved by the member countries in 
Houston, amounted to $1.6 billion. During the 1991 Geneva 
meeting it was agreed that the first part of the resources -- 
$250 million -- would be released and 12 projects were approved. 
Of the 12 projects, seven are very well advanced in their 
drafting. But the resources have not been released yet. 
  Projects for biodiversity preservation that are to be 
financed with a fund of $18 million from the resources of the 
Global Environment Facility [title published in English] (GEF), 
which was created in 1991 and is supported by the World Bank, in 
addition to the $18 million Brazil will have to put up in 
matching funds. The GEF also has promised to release $30 
million for other environmental projects and the Brazilian 
Government promised $12 million in matching funds. 
  The restructuring of Brazilian organizations involved in the 
environmental sector. The PNMA has contracted financing of $117 
million with the World Bank in order to strengthen the country's 
environmental institutions and organizations, to implement 
projects to protect natural resources, and to support projects 
for the decentralization of environmental activities. 
  The FNMA was created with capital of $22 million from the 
IDB 
and $8 million in government matching funds for the financing of 
low-cost projects -- up to $200,000 -- for the preservation of 
environmental areas, research, biodiversity, and activities 
pertaining to environmental preservation. This is a 
little-known program that can be used by municipalities and 
nongovernmental organizations. Some of the funds already are 
being used.

<F P=106> [Article from the "Environment and Development" column by </F>
Lilia Duery A.] 
  [Text] Simple, comprehensive, integrating, realistic, and 
feasible are some of the words that describe the Basic 
Environment Law (No. 19300). This law that took 14 months to be 
approved by Congress was implemented on 9 March after its 
publication in the official gazette. 
  In the opinion of the law's authors, the instruments that 
outline the future of Chile's environmental actions are inspired 
in an integrating approach capable of granting, without going 
into details, key and generic guidelines for all national 
environmental problems. In other words, the easiest path was 
chosen, taking into account that with rules at hand it is easier 
to solve problems and progressively tackle each of the 
situations the country must face in this field. This will be 
done through the respective regulations that will be implemented 
over time. 
  The basic law is divided into 94 articles in addition to 
three transitory articles. It consists, basically, of a series 
of definitions and principles regarding its importance, in 
administration and institutional instruments that will allow its 
implementation, and in a system to define responsibility for 
damaging the environment. 
  This new law includes (discarding the idea of codifying in a 
single text the various important regulations in force regarding 
the environment in Chile) two main instruments that will make 
its implementation feasible. National Environment Commission 
(Conama) executive secretary Rafael Asenjo referred to these 
instruments. 
<H5>  Key Instruments </H5>
  The main instrument is the System for the Assessment of the 
Impact on the Environment [Sistema de Evaluacion de Impacto 
Ambiental -- SEIA] that, according to Asenjo, in addition to its 
preventive nature regarding Chilean production activities, deals 
with the international competition demanded in sustainable 
development. It includes procedures for the establishment of 
standards for emissions, quality, and environmental terms, 
giving the productive sector (either public or private) full 
autonomy to choose its own technology to attain these goals. 
  It also includes prevention or decontamination plans, 
whatever is needed, that can resort to market instruments such 
as a "permit for negotiable emissions." Here again the law 
grants business people the freedom to reach agreements among 
themselves for the fulfillment of environment quality standards 
for a specific area. Rafael Asenjo said: "Once rules for the 
use of this mechanism have been defined, we believe it will 
greatly contribute to a progressive, gradual, and sustained 
reduction of pollution levels." 
  This chapter also includes plans for the handling of natural 
resources, the improvement of the National Wild Areas System 
protected by the state, and the citizenry's participation, 
especially regarding their right to be kept informed on 
environment-related studies. 
<H5>  New Public Service </H5>
  The second instrument of the law is of an institutional 
nature. In fact, Conama ceases to be an advisory commission to 
become a public service, with legal status and its own 
patrimony. Its main role will be to integrate and coordinate 
the environmental activities of all sectors of the public 
administration that have any say in the matter. The executive 
council formed by 10 ministers and the Conama executive director 
also is created. 
  This organization, in turn, will operate in a d|?ntralized 
manner throug?espective regional environment commissions 
(Coremas) and will act as a horizontal structure at the 
government level that will be supervised by the president of the 
Republic through the ministry secretary general of the 
presidency, a privileged interlocutor between the government and 
the community. Moreover, Conama will be in charge of revising 
and periodically (every five years) updating the regulations 
issued regarding various subjects. In this case, surveillance 
will be absolutely by sectors, except in the case of complaints, 
in which case this service is in charge of making sure the law 
is respected. In this regard, it should be pointed out that 
people may approach the city halls authorized to hear the 
complaint and channel it to the respective Corema or the main 
office if necessary, under threat of a court ruling if it fails 
to do so. 
<H5>  Regional Model </H5>
  In one way or another, this law contains and expresses the 
principles "whoever contaminates pays" (in other words, whoever 
contaminates must include in his costs what it will cost to 
decontaminate), as well as the "gradualism" and "realism" 
principles. 
  Rafael Asenjo said: "This is the result of having explicitly 
tackled the subject from an integrative and comprehensive 
viewpoint for the first time in Chilean law." Therefore, he 
added, when we start to apply the law "we will take a necessary 
quantitative step forward in our country's environmental 
activities." 
  In this sense Asenjo believes there is a more optimistic 
future for Chile, noting that the laws dictated during the past 
years by the Latin American countries have not followed this 
model. He commented that despite the huge economic and human 
resources they have earmarked, their environmental problems have 
not been reduced. "We believe the reason for this failure in the 
region has been the attempt to solve everything at once with the 
same law and having created a fully sectorial institutional 
scheme that has lead nowhere and caused the various ministries 
to compete with each other," Asenjo commented. 
  Specific regulations are necessary now to start applying the 
environment law.

  [Text] The recent discovery of 14 furnaces for making 
charcoal in the Pongo Natural Forest, in Azuayo de Giron Canton, 
alerted the public to a method of destroying natural forests 
that is all the more reprehensible because it is unnecessary. 
However, it has proven impossible to curb. 
  Cuenca--Pongo is an expanse of over 300 hectares of woods 
consisting of large-sized native species that, according to 
British biologists, must have taken at least 600 years to grow. 
During the past three years, 50 hectares of this virgin 
vegetation have been converted into firewood or charcoal. 
  The destruction of part of the forest was confirmed by the 
undersecretary of agriculture in the South, Carlos Moscoso. On 
two visits to the site, access to which is difficult because it 
lies amid dense vegetation, he discovered 14 furnaces and eight 
persons working on the processing of charcoal. 
  When the Ecuadoran Institute of Forests, Natural Areas, and 
Wildlife (INEFAN) was alerted, four men were given a fine of two 
minimum wages each. It was also decided to seize the motorized 
saw and the material already processed. 
  Nevertheless, the INEFAN, which is the only judge for this 
type of administrative process, cannot auction the items that 
are seized, because it lacks the means for removing them from 
the site. 
  The landowner, fined three minimum wages on a previous 
occasion for felling trees without a permit, has not yet been 
penalized in this case. 
<H5>  "Now They Realize" </H5>
  Carlos Moscoso claims that action has been taken, in 
cooperation with the INEFAN, to make confiscations at the market 
and during the clandestine transport of plant materials. 
  He also notes that identification cards will be given to 
interested private individuals, giving them the authority to act 
as forest wardens. 
  A visit to the charcoal and firewood market, now moved from 
the famous Otorongo to the most secluded part of Arenal, the 
city's principal market, proves the contrary. A vendor makes the 
rather explicit statement: "Yes, they bother us once in awhile, 
but lately they have realized that people have to make a living 
from something." 
  Most of the charcoal comes from the coast, and this 
informant 
confirms the statement made by the MAG [Ministry of Agriculture 
and Livestock] and the INEFAN to the same effect. However, the 
INEFAN director, Pablo Vintimilla, wonders: "Now, where will the 
coast's charcoal come from?" Statistics prepared by the 
institute in December also indicate that much of the firewood 
sold at Arenal comes "from the hills": in other words, from 
natural forests. Considering the fact that felling trees for 
lumber makes use of a minimum amount of the material, the INEFAN 
tolerates the processing of charcoal from cultivated timber and 
from material originating in the routine chopping of woods. This 
is more than sufficient for making charcoal that, apparently, 
continues to be consumed. The INEFAN's legal adviser, Franklin 
Bucheli, places great hope in the expedient that the institute 
has for collecting taxes on lumber and for controlling 
transportation permits. 
  He trusts more in educating people than in coercion, but 
admits that, in the meantime, something should be devised by the 
experts and other technicians for controlling this situation. He 
says that it seems manageable, compared with the problem caused 
by the felling of woods for the powerful lumber industry.

  [Text] According to Fernando Gonzalez, the 
undersecretary of fisheries, the productive sectors, especially 
those of the banana and fishing industries, should cooperate to 
repair the damage to the environment and the pollution of the 
Gulf of Guayaquil. 
  Guayaquil Staff--Fernando Gonzalez, undersecretary of 
fisheries, emphasized that the productive sectors devoted to 
banana growing and catching marine resources are responsible for 
polluting the Gulf of Guayaquil and damaging the country's 
ecosystem. 
  The fisheries undersecretary remarked: "We have been 
irresponsible in using these resources," and called upon those 
involved in these activities to participate intensively in 
ecosystem rehabilitation programs. 
  He added that Taura syndrome, a disease that seriously harms 
shrimp production, and the pollution of the gulf are due largely 
to the use of chemical products. 
  The shrimp fishermen have held banana producers responsible 
for Taura syndrome and for the pollution of the Gulf of 
Guayaquil, owing to the indiscriminate, excessive use of 
pesticides in the battle against the black sigatoka fungus. 
  In Fernando Gonzalez's opinion, all this has created a 
conflict that should be resolved immediately, through the use of 
suitable methods and consensus. 
  When the national government learned that two major sectors 
of the Ecuadoran economy were at stake, it ordered the ministers 
of agriculture and industries to work jointly to reconcile these 
industries. The aim is to prevent either of them from being 
harmed, and also from damaging the ecosystem. 
  Gonzalez noted that the National Banana Program has devised 
regulations for the use of pesticides, adopting proposals from 
the National Chamber of Aquaculture to avoid damage to the 
ecosystem. 
  Fernando Gonzalez indicated that the problem is global. The 
estuaries associated with the Guayas Basin have been used by 
many industries for a long time, and this has caused congestion 
in the ecosystem. 
  Since August 1992, the National Institute of Fisheries has 
been monitoring (investigating) the Gulf of Guayaquil and Guayas 
Basin, by establishing 12 stations around various shrimp 
production companies. He said that, within the next few days, 
the institute will submit the reports received on the 
investigations. 
  Undersecretary Gonzalez also cited the series of 
prohibitions 
and bans issued in the insular Galapagos Province. 
  He noted that President Sixto Duran Ballen had sent a 
commission comprised of the national defense, agriculture, and 
tourism ministers, to determine the real problems besetting one 
of that province's leading economic activities, namely, fishing. 
  He gave a reminder that there have been prohibitions in 
Galapagos that have not adhered to legal specifications called 
for in the Ecuadoran juridical system, nor to technical 
specifications with which they should have been prepared. 
  The prohibitions were issued because it seemed fitting to 
certain authorities or parties concerned, but without any 
technical criterion, much less a scientific criterion. 
  He added that the Ministerial Commission will determine the 
means for resolving this situation, making it possible to 
prevent the depredation of marine resources. 
  Gonzalez commented: "In principle, any resource is 
susceptible to exploitation so long as it is done with a view 
toward sustained use. However, continental business firms must 
be prevented from going to Galapagos and hurting the interests 
of the Galapagos nonindustrial fleet, consisting of small 
insular fishermen." 
  "The continental companies went to the archipelago, 
plundered 
the crawfish and sea cucumber, and were replaced later by 
others." 
  He added: "To avoid this series of violations against the 
marine resources, it is planned to create a Sub-Directorate of 
Fisheries, with jurisdiction in Galapagos. The 56 forest wardens 
on the islands will be given the responsibility for being 
converted into 56 fishing inspectors."

  [Text] There are approximately 133,000 hectares of 
shrimp nets in the country. It would hardly be possible for 
150,000 hectares of mangrove swamps to be devastated, leaving 
only 40,000 in Ancon de Sardinas: National Chamber of 
Aquaculture. 
  Guayaquil Staff: The National Chamber of Aquaculture has 
expressed concern and constant support for the creation of a 
system for surveillance and monitoring of the mangrove swamps 
and the ecosystem. This also entails a revision of the penalties 
in effect under the present regulations. 
  The institution's executive director, Harold Muller, gave 
explanatory reports on the statistics for mangrove swamp 
depredation ascribed to shrimp production. 
  According to statistical data from the Remote Sensor 
Integrated Surveys Center (Clirsen), the distribution of 
mangrove swamps in Esmeraldas covers 32,032 hectares. 
  The Coastal Resources Management Program (PMRC), in its 
series of management plans for the special management zones 
(ZEM) of Atacames-Sua-Muisne, indicates that, between 1969 and 
1987, the reduction in the mangrove swamp area surface totaled 
approximately 1,000 hectares. 
  This decline compounds that caused by shrimp nets, removal 
of 
mangrove piles, and charcoal production, which amounts to 1.2 
million pounds per year in the Muisne area alone. 
  Muller proved with documentary evidence that the mangrove 
swamp reserve is nearly intact. He declared that there is an 
error in the claim that 150,000 hectares of mangroves out of a 
total of 300,000 have been felled. 
  There has also been a claim that, in 1986, the Esmeraldas 
mangrove swamp was declared a protective forest and that, 
despite this, over 150,000 hectares have been felled since that 
date, leaving at present only 40,000 in the Ancon de Sardinas 
estuary. 
  Muller gave a reminder that the shrimp industry in the 
country as a whole occupies approximately 133,000 hectares. He 
added that 150,000 could hardly be devastated, leaving only 
40,000 hectares on the Ancon de Sardinas estuary: something that 
is not true. 
  He stressed that it was at the sector's initiative that the 
national government was requested to cease granting new 
concessions for the construction of shrimp ponds, and noted that 
these authorizations have been suspended. 
  On several occasions that institution has asked the 
government to exercise strict control over the indiscriminate 
felling of mangroves on the national territory, so as to prevent 
unscrupulous persons from continuing their deforestation work. 
This is especially necessary since the sector has been fully 
aware that the mangrove swamp constitutes a fundamental element 
in the ecosystem, primarily in the development of shrimp itself. 
  "Therefore, we are the first to take precautions and oversee 
the good condition of our resources." 
  Although the shrimp sector, and particularly the National 
Chamber of Aquaculture, have been the first to report, and to 
give constant cooperation to the authorities, it is regrettable 
that our laws do not call for example-setting penalties. 
  Because of this situation, the efforts expended by 
shrimpers, 
fishery authorities, and the navy are being constantly thwarted 
by the land traffickers. 
  Minimal, and even ridiculous penalties are imposed on those 
engaged in the repugnant task of destroying mangrove swamps. 
  The Aquaculture Chamber is also concerned about proposing a 
revision of the penalties in effect in the regulations. 
  Muller emphasized that the shrimp industry accounts for over 
31 percent of private exports and, more than an environmental 
impact, is having a significant economic and social effect. It 
generates foreign exchange in an amount equivalent to $525 
million. 
  Moreover, it employs over 200,000 full-time workers 
directly, 
and over 90,000 persons indirectly. This means that 7.2 percent 
of the country's economically active population makes its living 
largely from the shrimp industry. 
  During recent times especially, many private and state 
organizations have come out in defense of the Ecuadoran mangrove 
swamp. 
  The shrimp sector, in particular, is accused of being the 
main cause of the deterioration of vast riparian areas of the 
Ecuadoran coast.

  [Excerpt] Leaders of the Employees and Workers Union of the 
National Directorate for Civilian Aviation (SEODINAC) have 
expressed concern because no attention has yet been given to 
several reports of irregularities submitted to the 
Administrative Council of the DINAC [National Directorate for 
Civilian Aviation]. 
  The union said: "We are facing a worrisome situation over 
the 
entry of 104 kg of radioactive material under the UN Development 
Program through the Silvio Pettirossi International Airport." 
  The union added that the situation is worse because the 
highly dangerous cargo left the airport jurisdiction under a 
regulation called "cargo to be regularized" which can be 
considered legalized smuggling. 
  The union commented that approximately 18 months ago two 
small cans of radioactive material were found at the airport. 
The case was made public but nobody knew anything about how 
they appeared. 
  The union stated: "Documents now in our possession open the 
way to a thorough investigation that could expose a new face in 
the trafficking of prohibited merchandise through our airport." 
  The union believes several people are responsible for the 
entry of nuclear material into the country: One is Col. Ramon 
Dardo Guerra, head of the DINAC: Another is Col. Americo Osorio, 
airport director, who authorized the delivery without even the 
payment of the airport duties, and Victor Arevalo as the 
professional who mediated in this shipment. The air cargo ramp 
chief is also believed to be involved. [passage omitted]

  [Text] The dumping and trading of hazardous chemical waste 
have become a major environmental concern globally. The issue 
was raised at a recent international environment conference in 
Geneva. At the meeting, the leader of the Bangladeshi 
delegation and State Minister for Environment Gayeshwar Roy said 
the dumping of toxic and hazardous waste must stop, as much as a 
halt should be called to end the export of such commodities by 
the West to the Third World. The Bangladeshi delegation chief 
said definite international restrictions must be applied to the 
movement of chemical waste. 
  The large and massive industrial complexes of the West 
generate most of the hazardous waste globally and a good part of 
it is dumped in the Third World, either through arrangements or 
surreptitiously in the high seas surrounding the developing 
countries. Once, some Third World countries agreed to take the 
chemical waste of the West in return for financial assistance. 
There were reasons for that. Environment awareness was poor in 
those days and most developing countries were cash-strapped and 
looked for an avenue for resources wherever they could be 
obtained. But now, with the increasing public awareness of the 
environment and of the need to protect one's ecology, Third 
World governments are not willing to allow their backyards to be 
used as dumping grounds for the waste of the industrial 
countries. Even allurements offered through aid are not enough 
to change their stands on accepting anybody's waste. 
  So a different strategy is being used by some Western 
chemical complexes in disposing of their hazardous waste by 
taking those by the shipload and throwing them in the sea near 
the coast of the Third World countries, because these nations do 
not have the means to police their coasts adequately against 
such threats. Bangladesh has been a victim of such illegal 
dumping by these waste-carrying ships. The Bangladeshi Navy and 
the Coast Guard have detected such waste dumping and have taken 
punitive and legal action against the unlawful acts. 
  Another way of transferring waste to the Third World is by 
exporting chemical fertilizers mixed with hazardous waste. 
These products are made in the industrial countries and sold to 
the developing countries. Such illegal trade have been detected 
in many Third World countries, including Bangladesh. Very 
recently, a consignment of imported fertilizer in Bangladesh was 
found to contain chemical waste. After contamination was 
discovered, the government immediately swung into action and 
took legal measures against the exporting American company and 
its local agent. 
  Bangladesh has asked the international community to draw out 
definite measures in the face of trading of such hazardous 
waste. A constant vigil should be kept on the movement of such 
chemical waste throughout the world. There should be an 
international authority entrusted with this responsibility. 
  More dangerous is the revelation that nuclear waste are 
being 
dumped in oceans by countries which possess nuclear facilities. 
This dumping is contaminating the oceans and is endangering the 
environment. The radioactive poisoning is spreading around the 
world. There should be an international regime to protect the 
oceans -- the common heritage of mankind -- from nuclear 
pollution. Perhaps the Geneva international environment 
conference will pave the way for establishing such a regime. 
Bangladesh will always support any move that is aimed at 
safeguarding the planet that belongs to all nations.

<F P=106> [Vlad Ignatov report under the "Ecology" rubric: "Russia </F>
Produces 10 Percent of World Pollutants"] 
  [Text] The work of an All-Russia Conference of the Russian 
Federation Ministry of Environmental Protection and Natural 
Resources with the participation of deputy heads of 
administrations of federation components and heads of 
territorial nature protection bodies is winding up today at 
Parliament Center. For two days, some 400 participants have 
been taking stock of the work done in 1993 and discussing their 
goals for the current year. 
  The Ministry of Environmental Protection and Natural 
Resources faces a great deal of work. According to its head, 
Viktor Danilov-Danilyan, in many respects -- the discharge into 
the atmosphere of ozone-destroying substances and sulfur 
dioxide, the generation of radioactive waste -- Russia, on whose 
territory live only 2.5 percent of the earth's population, 
accounts today for a tenth of the world's amount of pollutants. 
  It was pointed out at the conference that the uncertainty of 
the nature watchdogs' status sometimes led to confrontations 
with representatives of the other agencies in resolving 
ecological issues. This problem has been partially eliminated 
by the Russian Federation Government decree "On Specially 
Authorized State Organs in the Area of Environmental 
Protection." Currently a new decree is in the works whose draft 
gives Ministry of Environmental Protection and Natural Resources 
staffers broader rights, up to the use of punitive sanctions. 
There is still no unanimity, however, on the role of 
territorial nature protection structures. According to a 
departmental poll conducted by the Ministry of Environmental 
Protection and Natural Resources, nearly 30 percent of 
territorial nature protection bodies see their functions in 
being only coordinators, 24 percent see themselves as 
coordinators and inspectors, while the majority -- 47 percent -- 
are prepared to become the only special nature-protection 
management bodies.

<F P=106> [Article by Aleksey Yablokov, chairman of the Russian </F>
Federation Security Council's Interdepartmental Commission on 
Ecological Safety: "Aleksey Yablokov: `Each Person Must Decide 
How To Save Himself and His Children'"] 
  [Text] According to the findings of the World Health 
Organization (WHO), the state of the environment accounts for an 
average of 30 percent of the health of each human being. 
Obviously, the percentage should be lower in ecologically sound 
regions and much higher in zones of ecological problems and 
crises (and at least 15 percent of Russia's territory falls into 
these categories). It is also obvious that someone must take 
responsibility for health impairments beyond the citizen's 
control. 
  Finally, it is also obvious that the protracted absence of 
state concern for this connection between the state of public 
health and the state of the environment has led to one of the 
most substantial threats to national security because the 
average lifespan--one of the general statistical indicators of 
national health--has been plunging disastrously since 1986. 
  When we say that the state must defend the rights and 
freedoms of the individual and that individual rights are above 
all other rights and freedoms, we are also referring to the now 
constitutionally secured right to compensation for health 
impairments resulting from the deterioration of environmental 
quality. 
  At the beginning of 1992, just after the Russian Federation 
laws "On Sanitary-Epidemiological Welfare" and "On Environmental 
Protection" were passed, it became obvious that the exercise of 
the right of citizens, declared in these laws, to compensation 
for health impairments caused by environmental factors would 
require additional legal and analytical work. We need standards 
and rules stipulating the actions that victims can take to 
protect themselves from the unfair judicial actions of polluting 
enterprises. What these victims need even more, however, is 
reliable proof that a specific impairment is caused directly by 
the pollution of the environment from a specific source. Without 
this information, they cannot expect a court to hear the case 
and rule in favor of the injured party. As a result of the 
intense work of a team of specialists, mainly connected with 
Gossanepidnadzor [State Committee for Sanitary-Epidemiological 
Oversight] and begun in spring 1992 under the auspices of the 
Russian Presidential Council on Ecological Policy, a set of 
standards and rules was drafted. The draft has already been 
"under discussion" in the Ministry of Justice and Ministry of 
Economics for more than a year, and the end of this process is 
not in sight. I can appreciate the difficulties this kind of 
deliberation entails: This document would grant citizens rights 
comparable to the right to protect personal inviolability and 
the right to own property. 
  In view of these difficulties, a decision was made to enlist 
the aid of epidemiologists in the codification of the effects of 
specific environmental pollutants on various health 
indicators--in a format suitable for a judicial hearing. 
  It was not possible to achieve all of these goals: The 
information that is being published today sometimes sounds more 
like a scientific treatise than the anticipated set of 
guidelines, but even the results to date are important enough to 
publish. The effects of other ecological factors of human origin 
on human health--chemicals, as well as noise, radiation, and 
others--will also be analyzed in the future. We hope that this 
research will eventually be recognized as the official set of 
standards and guidelines. 
  Armed with an awareness of the general state of affairs 
and the effects of pollution on his own health and the health of 
his children and grandchildren, each individual will choose his 
own method of avoiding this potential danger--by leaving the 
zone affected by the pollutant or be uniting with other affected 
citizens and forcing the polluter (through various channels, 
including judicial proceedings) to stop the pollution. 
  Therefore, the report that is being published today was 
written, on the one hand, for the public--to inform each citizen 
and offer more effective protection of the right of each citizen 
to a healthy environment--and, on the other, for the 
administrators and owners of sources (irrespective of forms of 
ownership) of dangerous chemical pollution, so that they will 
stop the hazardous emissions and dumping without waiting for 
legal judgments against them. 
  We wish to thank the newspaper and its special 
"Prescription" 
supplement for this publication--it is addressed to literally 
each person in Russia. 
  An applied science conference will be held soon on "Problems 
of Public Rehabilitation in Zones of Ecological Damage." The 
conference will be held by an association of trade unions in 
regions with unhealthy ecological conditions and by the 
International Fund for Socioecological Aid. Through the efforts 
of these organizations, the participants in the conference 
should receive our report in the form of a brochure to be used 
as a guide for action. These may just be the first tentative 
steps, but they are signs of progress....

Security Council on Ecological Safety: "Each Person Must Decide 
How To Save Himself and His Children"] 
  [Text] Around 28.2 million tonnes of pollutants from 18,000 
stationary sources and another 22 million tonnes from mobile 
sources were discharged into the air of Russian cities and 
smaller communities in 1992. This is equivalent to 300 kilograms 
of pollutants for each inhabitant of Russia during the year. The 
leaders in industrial discharges of solid substances are 
Magnitogorsk, Nizhniy Tagil, and Chelyabinsk, as well as the 
cities of Asbest, Troitsk, and Suvorov; the highest levels of 
sulfur dioxide emissions have been recorded in Norilsk, 
Monchegorsk, Nikel, Orsk, and Omsk; the highest levels of 
nitrogen dioxide emissions are in Moscow, St. Petersburg, 
Surgut, Asbest, and Omsk; the highest levels of carbon monoxide 
emissions are in Novokuznetsk, Magnitogorsk, Lipetsk, 
Cherepovets, and Nizhniy Tagil. Vehicle emissions are at the 
highest levels in Moscow, St. Petersburg, Krasnodar, Omsk, Ufa, 
Volgograd, Nizhniy Novgorod, Samara, and Voronezh. Calculation 
methods based on the relationship between the total amount of 
substance discharged and its allowable concentration are used in 
the hygienic assessment of discharges of toxic substances into 
the air. This coefficient, which is known as the "relative risk 
coefficient," served as the basis for the categorization of 
substances in order of risk and the cities where these 
substances are present in the atmosphere. 
  The main substances recorded were benzpyrene, sulfur 
dioxide, 
and nitrogen oxides, which are connected with the substantial 
emissions of power engineering facilities, and lead. 
  It must be borne in mind that official emission statistics 
do 
not reflect the whole spectrum of pollutants because some 
enterprises do not submit this information in the necessary 
detail. Furthermore, many enterprises discharging substances 
containing toxic metals that are dangerous to human health are 
not included in these indicators. 
  Official air pollution statistics also do not include 
emissions of toxic metals resulting from the consumption of 
solid and liquid fuel (coal and fuel oil). Calculations based on 
information about the elements of fuel indicate that the 
volatile microelements contained in coal--arsenic, mercury, 
bromine, and antimony--enter the atmosphere along with thousands 
of tonnes of vanadium, manganese, fluorine, and zinc compounds. 
The estimated 80 million tonnes of fuel oil used each year in 
power engineering pollute the air with thousands of tonnes of 
vanadium, nickel, boron, and bromine and dozens of tonnes of 
many other elements. Motor transport is a major source of lead 
particles in the air of virtually all Russian cities (except 
Moscow). These emissions can amount to 2,000 tonnes a year. An 
assessment of the relative danger of discharged metals indicates 
that lead is the main hazard--furthermore, it is the most 
pervasive element--followed by compounds of vanadium, nickel, 
manganese, and fluorine. 
  The relative danger of pollutants in the air of different 
cities was judged by six types of substances (solids, sulfur 
dioxide, nitrogen dioxide, carbon monoxide, hydrocarbons, and 
volatile organic compounds) listed in official reports. 
  The leaders in terms of the relative danger of emissions per 
unit of municipal area are Norilsk, Nikel, Novotroitsk, Angarsk, 
Monchegorsk, Novokuybyshevsk, Magnitogorsk, Cherepovets, Orsk, 
Yuzhno-Sakhalinsk, Novokuznetsk, Nizhniy Tagil, Zima, 
Zapolyarnyy, Sterlitamak, Lipetsk, and Salavat (Table 1).

  Many cities where the air is polluted by substantial 
quantities of organic and inorganic substances--small and 
medium-sized metallurgical cities in the Urals and the chemical 
production areas in Stavropol Kray and in Kirov and other 
oblasts--are not on the list. 
  A detailed description of the composition of emissions, with 
a view to the makeup of organic substances and the presence of 
metals, could change the ranking of cities considerably. The 
problem of dioxins entering the air and the environment also 
requires immediate action. Existing estimates and evaluations of 
technological processes suggest that the existence of dioxin 
could present problems in around 20 cities in Russia. 
  The large quantities of substances entering the air of 
cities 
are resulting in higher concentrations of pollutants in the air. 
According to the 1992 state report on the environment of the 
Russian Federation, levels of air pollution exceeding 10 times 
the maximum allowable concentration (MAC) were recorded in many 
of Russia's cities and industrial centers. The most highly 
polluted cities with metallurgical industry include Lipetsk, 
Magnitogorsk, Kamensk-Uralskiy, Krasnoyarsk, Nizhniy Tagil, 
Novokuznetsk, Cherepovets, and Bratsk; the most highly polluted 
cities with chemical industry include Berezniki, Omsk, Perm, 
Tolyatti, Usolye-Sibirskoye, and many others. The combined 
findings of air pollution studies by Roskomgidromet [Russian 
Hydrometeorology Committee] indicate the presence of a variety 
of pollutants in the air of many cities (Table 2). 


Cities with the Highest Concentrations of a Group of Specific Pollutants 

City                                  Substances and maximum concentrations 

Perm                                  ammonia (74), hydrogen chloride (12), 
                                      ethylbenzene (59), toluene (64), 
                                      benzene (13), xylene (26), styrene 
                                      (58), sulfuric acid (22) 

Omsk                                  ammonia (30), xylene (4-6), ammonia

                                      (17), xylene (3) 

Dzerzhinsk                            hydrogen chloride (20), ethylbenzene 
                                      (30) 

Tolyatti                              ammonia (30), toluene (14), benzene 
                                      (9), styrene (20), xylene (3) 

Kemerovo                              ammonia (27), formaldehyde (11) 

Nizhniy Tagil                         phenol (5) 

Lipetsk                               formaldehyde (10), ammonia (10) 

Volzhskiy                             hydrogen sulfide (47), formaldehyde (2) 



  The group of identified substances in the air depends 
largely 
on the analytical capabilities of local laboratories, and this 
is the reason for the high number of identified ingredients in 
Perm, for example, with its well-equipped laboratory. The 
results of air quality surveys at Roskomgidromet stations that 
are published in almanacs provide no opportunities for assessing 
the spatial features of pollutant distribution. Air pollution 
levels near enterprises are much higher, however, than the city 
averages. In the air near the Permneftorgsintez enterprise in 
Perm, for example, the concentration of phenol can be as high as 
22 times the MAC, the concentration of sulfur dioxide is 3.8 
times the MAC, and the concentration of nitrogen dioxide is 6.6 
times the MAC. The concentrations of formaldehyde, acetaldehyde, 
acrylaldehyde, acetone, ethanol, and butanol in the air of 
residential neighborhoods near the Khimvolokno and Azot 
enterprises in Kemerovo are 250 times the MAC. 
  Higher concentrations of pollutants in the air are carried 
for long distances encompassing sizable developed territories. 
In Berezniki, for example, a city surrounded by potassium 
production units, the concentration of many pollutants exceeds 
the maximum allowable concentration even at a distance of 5 
kilometers from the plant. 
  An analysis of some of the results of air pollution surveys 
conducted by the public health service, scientific research 
institutes, and departmental laboratories revealed even more 
problems with air quality than those listed in the reports of 
Roskomgidromet. 
<H5>  Pediatrics and Air Pollution </H5>
  The level (or quality) of public health depends on many 
biological, socioeconomic, medical-organizational, and 
ecological factors. An analysis of just one health 
indicator--the number of children with chronic illnesses in 
clinic records--throughout the Russian Federation reveals that 
the number doubled between 1980 and 1990 and reached around 6.5 
million in 1990. Therefore, one out of every five children had 
one chronic illness. Of the 16 recorded types of illnesses, 
there was a higher rate of chronic pharyngitis, nasopharyngitis, 
and sinusitis (2.3 times the earlier figure), iron deficiency 
anemia (1.5 times), and bronchial asthma (1.3 times). The 
ecological component plays a significant role in the etiology of 
all of these illnesses. It is possible that if there were 
separate medical statistics for the urban population of large 
industrial cities, the rise in the rate of illness would be even 
more perceptible there. 
  Studies of the health of schoolchildren, conducted according 
to a single set of methods over many years (1960-1990), 
indicated that the number of virtually healthy children in the 
first grade decreased over the 30 years from 60.8 percent to 
45.4 percent, and the number in the eighth grade decreased from 
59.8 to 47.9 percent. The rate of chronic illness in these age 
groups rose from 39.2 to 54.6 percent (first grade) and from 
40.2 to 52.1 percent for the eighth-graders. 
  The most severe effects of environmental pollution take the 
form of the higher rate of infant mortality and the increased 
frequency of birth defects. 
  Many studies of the effects of environmental pollution on 
the 
state of public health record a significant rise in various 
indicators of illness among children, primarily respiratory 
disorders. 
  Half of the adult patients have suffered from bronchial 
asthma since childhood. In recent years this disease has grown 
indisputably "younger." Cases of bronchial asthma in children in 
the first months of life are no longer extremely rare. In some 
cities the number of people with bronchial asthma is five or six 
times as high as it was. In Moscow, for example, the rate of 
bronchial asthma among children was seven times higher in 1981 
than in 1949 (6.9 cases for each 1,000 children). In St. 
Petersburg the number of children suffering from bronchial 
asthma increased from 2.9 per 1,000 in 1982 to 3.7 per 1,000 in 
1987. The number suffering from asthmatic bronchitis also rose: 
from 6 to 7.7 per 1,000 (T. Pogorelova and I. Malysheva, 1986). 
The rising rate of bronchopulmonary disorders is connected 
largely with air pollution in the cities. The rate of upper 
respiratory disease in children in the zone affected by chemical 
production units in Samara is twice as high as the average. The 
rate in neighborhoods near petrochemical production units and 
petroleum refineries is 2.5 times as high; the rate near the 
metallurgical combine is 4 or 5 times as high, and so forth. In 
a city with metallurgical industry the rate of otorhinological 
disease is 3-5 times the average near the combine, 2-3 times the 
average at a distance of 1.5 kilometers from the combine, and 
1.5 times the average at a distance of 6 kilometers. 
<H5>  Moscow Statistics Illustrating Spatial Features of </H5>
Distribution of Bronchial Asthma Among Children 
  The highest levels of air pollution are in the center, 
northwest, and northeast of the city. The rate of bronchial 
asthma in children within the territory of 110 pediatric clinics 
here is three or more times as high as indicators in "clean" 
districts of the city. All exceptions were closely correlated 
with the spatial locations of major highways and industrial 
enterprises. The loci of this illness are concentrated in homes 
situated near the zoo, the race track, the perfume factory, and 
other plants and major highways. 
  ...A direct relationship between bronchopulmonary disease in 
children and the level of air pollution has also been discovered 
in several other parts of the country. The very fact that twice 
as many children in the Russian Federation died of bronchial 
asthma in 1990 as in 1980 is indicative. 
  The results of clinical epidemiological studies of the role 
of air pollution in the onset of pulmonary disease in children 
in one of the most highly polluted Russian cities--Nizhniy 
Tagil--are indicative. 
  Starting in the 1970s, more and more children in Nizhniy 
Tagil began complaining of hoarseness and breathing difficulties 
that did not fit the usual clinical definition of pneumonia or 
typical bronchial asthma. The same child could suffer from 
bronchial obstructions several times a year. This coincided with 
the start-up of the bank of coke ovens in December 1986 without 
the necessary dust and air filters. It was then that the rate of 
tracheobronchitis rose and asthmatic attacks in children became 
more common. The number of children hospitalized with bronchial 
asthma in the city also rose. 
  The effects of air pollution are experienced by the 
residents 
of industrial cities and of small communities located near 
industrial enterprises, gas and oil fields, and toxic waste 
disposal sites. There is so little information about the state 
of public health in these communities, and the findings of 
existing studies can only be viewed as preliminary results. 
  The village of Cherkasskiy near Ufa has a population of 
2,300. The village is surrounded on three sides by oil 
refineries, a synthetic alcohol plant, and the "Khimprom" 
enterprise. Concentrations of phenol in the air are 1.9-4.2 
times the MAC, the level of hydrocarbons is 2.7 times the MAC, 
and the hydrogen sulfide level is 1.5 times the MAC. Drinking 
water does not meet standard requirements in terms of 
organoleptic or chemical indicators. The children there are more 
likely than those in the control group to suffer from disorders 
of the respiratory organs, the central nervous system, the skin, 
and the urinary organs. The rate of these illnesses is also 
higher among adults, as well as the rate of cardiovascular and 
otorhinolaryngological disease (materials of the Ufa Scientific 
Research Institute of Human Ecology and Occupational Medicine). 
  The pollution of the air with emissions of specific 
pollutants has had severe effects in several cases: Specific 
symptoms and complex syndromes. The most disturbing and most 
vivid examples are the effects of the operations of plants 
producing protein-vitamin concentrates and other enterprises of 
the microbiological industry.... 
  The rate of bronchial asthma rose dramatically in Angarsk 
after the start of operations at the protein-vitamin concentrate 
plant in 1979. The number of cases of chronic upper respiratory 
disease in children increased 7.3-fold and there was an 
eightfold increase in the number of cases of chronic bronchitis. 
The mass poisoning of the population occurred in 1988. 
  People living near plants producing antibiotics in Saransk 
have complained of frequent pains in their joints and skin 
rashes. The growth of antibiotic production has been accompanied 
by coughing, sneezing, and allergic rhinitis. Special studies 
attest to the specific allergization of the organism to 
penicillin (52 percent of the respondents), the candida antigen 
(54.5 percent), or both antigens (29 percent). 
  ...In the "aluminum" cities, just as in some other large 
industrial centers, dental pathology is accompanied by changes 
in the whole motor-reflex apparatus in children. 
  A special in-depth study of the children in Shelekhov, which 
is the site of an aluminum plant, revealed that the frequency of 
skeletal dysplasia was three times the average, corroborating 
the data on the osteotropic properties of fluoric compounds. 
<H5>  Physical Development of Children </H5>
  A variety of functional and morphological defects in 
children 
exposed to the effects of air pollution arises virtually at the 
time of birth. This is connected with the effects of air 
pollution on the mother during pregnancy and prior to conception. 
  In Moscow the average weight of the newborns of mothers 
living in the zone affected by emissions from the Motor Vehicle 
Plant imeni Likhachev is 400 grams (or 10 percent) below the 
average weight in the southwestern subway region. 
  Cities and villages of the copper ore mining and enriching 
combines in the Urals have a higher number of children with 
extreme anthropometric characteristics. These cities are marked 
by lower indicators of body length at birth and less balanced 
anthropometric indicators. 
  Children weigh less on the average in Novotroitsk near the 
Orsk-Khalilov metallurgical combine and in Orenburg (materials 
of the School of Hygiene of the Orenburg Medical Institute). 
  A comparative analysis of the growth standards of physical 
development in infants and toddlers (the first three years of 
life) for oblast centers--Ufa, Yekaterinburg, Nizhniy Novgorod, 
and Samara--revealed that the worst indicators were in Ufa: 
clear signs of increasing asthenia (narrow chest and minimal 
weight combined with minimal growth). The physical development 
of children in different regions of Ufa revealed verifiable 
disparities depending on the intensity of the influence of 
anthropogenic factors (materials of the Bashkir Medical 
Institute). 
  Lower anthropometric indicators were also found in children 
of pre-school age in the zone affected by emissions of boron 
production units in Dalnegorsk, ferroalloy production units and 
enterprises producing building materials (keramzit gravel and 
asphalt) in Moscow, copper smelting and aluminum plants, and 
many other production units. 
  In one of the most highly polluted neighborhoods in Moscow 
(Kalininskiy Rayon), there were 5 percent fewer children between 
the ages of 3 and 7 with balanced (or proportional) physical 
development and almost twice as many children who were 
underweight or overweight. 
  These deviations from anthropometric standards are 
indicators 
of the state of pediatric health at the time of the study and 
indicators of possible subsequent changes. Children with maximum 
deviations from average anthropometric characteristics are known 
to suffer more frequently from pathological changes than 
children who deviate little from the norm. An analysis of the 
development of children in the "copper" cities of the Urals 
indicates retarded physical and neuropsychological development 
(these children are older when they take their first steps) and 
delays in primary dentition. These children are also older than 
the average when they begin speaking. Therefore, changes in the 
normal physical development of children, particularly in 
combination with an unhealthy lifestyle (hypodynamia, inadequate 
physical training, and so forth), can lead to deviations in the 
state of their health later as well. As a rule, however, it is 
rarely possible to define the main external factor or only 
external factor destroying the nervous system in children. 
Special studies have established the influence of small doses of 
lead, mercury, and organic phosphates (pesticides), a shortage 
of iodine, and possibly of goitrogenic substances affecting the 
neuropsychological development of children. 
  Paradoxically, the development of the system most vulnerable 
to ecopathogenic influences in children, namely the brain, and 
deviations in the neuropsychological development of children in 
the zones of ecological stress have not attracted enough 
attention from pediatricians, psychoneurologists, hygienists, 
and ecologists. 
<H5>  Health of the Adult Population and Air Pollution </H5>
  It is difficult to assess the state of health of the adult 
population in cities with higher levels of environmental 
pollution. This is due to the lack of official statistical 
reports and to the procedural difficulties of keeping records of 
this kind, which require consideration for the role of 
occupational factors, bad habits, and the lifestyle in general. 
There are some studies that offer convincing evidence of the 
negative role of air pollution. 
  The rate of chronic respiratory and pulmonary disease 
(pneumonia, bronchitis, laryngitis, and pharyngitis) and otitis 
in adults between the ages of 15 and 60 in Vladimir was 2.8 
times as high in the zone affected by emissions from the 
chemical plant as in the control group. 
  A detailed study of the effects of air pollution on public 
health was conducted in Novokuznetsk. 
  The non-specific pulmonary disorders of workers of the 
metallurgical combine were studied to assess the effects of air 
pollution on the health of the adult population. In accordance 
with hygienic air quality surveys in the developed part of the 
city, workers were divided into one group living in the zone of 
maximum air pollution, a second group living in regions with 
average pollution, and a third in the zone of minimal pollution. 
  The engineering and technical personnel and employees of the 
combine with no contact with occupational hazards of a chemical 
nature were used as the control group. This method revealed some 
tendencies in the combined effects of chemical pollutants on the 
health of workers in production and non-production areas. 
  Perceptible differences were discovered in an analysis of 
the 
general rate of illness among workers living in the zone of 
maximum air pollution and workers in the zone of minimal 
pollution. 
  Unfavorable ecological conditions lead to the development of 
occupational pathology. The Novokuznetsk aluminum plant workers 
living near the plant, for example, were twice as likely to 
suffer from occupational fluorosis. It developed much more 
quickly in this group, and cases of toxic hepatosis and specific 
changes in dental enamel were more common, reflecting the 
influence of fluorides at work and at home. 
  A study of the effects of air pollution on the frequency of 
requests for emergency medical treatment for cardiovascular and 
pulmonary disease revealed a direct connection. The number of 
requests for emergency treatment for cardiovascular disorders 
was 2.4 times as high as in the zone with a relatively low level 
of air pollution (materials of the Comprehensive Hygiene and 
Occupational Disease Institute of the Siberian Department of the 
Russian Academy of Medical Sciences in Novokuznetsk). 
  Similar patterns were observed in other large industrial 
centers in East Siberia--Bratsk and Angarsk. 
  Indicators of requests for medical assistance by adults with 
no relationship to occupational hazards were much more numerous 
in Bratsk than in other cities in Irkutsk Oblast--Selenginsk and 
Baykalsk. The population of Bratsk is more likely to suffer from 
disorders of the nervous system, sensory organs, and 
cardiovascular system (1.2-1.9 times as likely). Besides this, 
the inhabitants of Bratsk are more likely to seek treatment for 
immunologic disorders and diseases (N. Matorova et al, 1990). 
  A verifiable connection was established in Angarsk between 
the levels of short-term air pollution in the city and the daily 
patient rate--and in some years, the daily death rate. Chemical 
air pollution was responsible for 6-21 percent of the 
fluctuations in the daily patient rate (for different categories 
of illnesses) and 2.7-19.4 percent of fluctuations in the daily 
death rate (Ya. Leshchenko et al, 1993). 
<H5>  Public Health and Food Pollution </H5>
  Food can be the source and agent of many chemicals posing a 
potential threat to human health. 
  The results of surveys conducted from 1988 to 1991/92 
indicate that from 0.8 to 3.8 percent of the analyzed samples of 
food products exceeded public health limits for lead, from 1.1 
to 1.7 samples exceeded the cadmium limits, and from 0.4 to 4.7 
percent exceeded mercury limits (V. Tutelyan et al, 1993). 
  High levels of environmental pollution by metals in the 
environs of metallurgical production units can cause the 
considerable accumulation of toxic metals in vegetables, fruit, 
and berries. The content of heavy metals--lead, cadmium, 
chromium, and nickel--is extremely high in vegetables and 
berries grown between the cities of Revda and Pervouralsk in 
direct proximity to [passage omitted in source] 
  In Russia as a whole, there were signs of nitrate pollution 
in from 9.8 to 7.7 percent of all analyzed samples of food 
products. 
  Levels of food pollution began to decline in 1990. The 
degree 
of produce pollution by pesticides also decreased (from 3.2-3.5 
percent in 1988/89 to 1.7-2 percent in 1991/92), but pesticide 
levels are still quite high in some parts of Russia. In 
Krasnodar Kray, for example, pesticide use is two or three times 
the national average. 
  Studies of the state of public health in different parts of 
Krasnodar Kray indicate that high pesticide levels in 
communities in grain and rice farming regions are accompanied by 
higher rates of otorhinolaryngological disease, bronchial 
asthma, tuberculosis of the respiratory system, severe 
respiratory infections, and retarded physical development in 
children. Changes in the state of health are less pronounced in 
the adult population, but the rate of treatment for arterial 
hypertension and disorders of the digestive organs is three 
times as high. 
  The health of children is much worse in regions with high 
pesticide levels in Rostov Oblast. 
<H5>  Reproductive Health </H5>
  The reproductive health of the population is one of the most 
accurate indicators of public health and an indicator of local 
ecological conditions. 
  Environmental pollution causes disturbances of endocrine 
functions and the immune, hemopoietic, and other systems in 
pregnant women and infants. 
  The rate of severe pregnancy complications is constantly 
rising in Russia. The rate of pregnancy-related toxemia rose by 
41 percent between 1981 and 1989, representing 7.7 cases per 100 
births. Furthermore, cases of severe forms of toxemia--eclampsia 
and preeclampsia--increased 4.8-fold. Pregnant women were 2.6 
times as likely to suffer from anemia, twice as likely to suffer 
from kidney disorders, and 21.9 percent more likely to suffer 
from cardiovascular disease (N. Vaganov, 1991). 
  Although the rate of prenatal problems has risen everywhere, 
the rise is more pronounced in large industrial centers, where 
many women are employed in jobs with hazardous working 
conditions. 
  In Ufa the rate of toxemia in pregnant women rose from 8.9 
to 
20.1 per 100 births in the last 21 years. This is almost three 
times as high as the republic average. The reason is the 
employment of many of the women at enterprises of the 
petrochemical complex (Bashkir Medical Institute, 1992). 
  It is extremely difficult to gage the effects of 
environmental pollution in these cities on the state of 
reproductive functions. An analysis of the health indicators of 
pregnant women not employed in hazardous jobs but living in 
highly unsatisfactory ecological conditions confirms the 
presence of significant disparities. 
  Women in the metallurgical cities of the 
Urals--Kamensk-Uralsk, Kirovograd, and the Novokuznetsk 
neighborhoods near the aluminum plant--were more likely than the 
women in the control group to suffer miscarriages, spontaneous 
abortions, premature births, and other pathological disorders. 
  A similar situation was recorded in Krasnokamsk in Perm 
Oblast, the site of a pulp combine. 
  In Baykalsk and Bratsk, other cities with pulp and paper 
industry, and in Shelekhov, a city with aluminum production 
units, disorders of reproductive functions were much more severe 
than in a "cleaner" city in East Siberia. 
<H5>  Infant Mortality </H5>
  The rate of infant mortality is an important indicator of 
the 
quality of public health and social welfare. 
  It is extremely difficult to judge the effects of 
environmental pollution in cities on the rate of infant 
mortality. Studies in this field are extremely few in number. 
  Indicators of the early neonatal death of infants (death in 
the first week of life) over nine years in seven cities and 
seven rural rayons inhabited by around 2 million people were 
studied in Chelyabinsk Oblast (Chelyabinsk-40). The rate of 
infant mortality turned out to be most closely related to the 
level of nitrogen dioxide emissions (correlative coefficient of 
r=0.76) and hydrocarbons (r=0.79). These factors have an impact 
of around 60 percent on the rate of infant mortality. The same 
study, incidentally, did not establish a connection between 
radiation levels and birth defects and early neonatal mortality. 
  A comparative analysis of infant mortality rates in the 
urban 
and rural populations is of some interest in revealing the role 
of the ecological factor. 
  The rate was higher in urban locations in 14 oblasts. They 
included such industrially developed territories as Moscow, 
Kursk, Lipetsk, Rostov, Orenburg, and Novosibirsk oblasts and 
the Republic of Bashkiria. 
<H5>  Effects of Environmental Pollution on Rate of Malignant </H5>
Tumors in Russia 
  The rise in the rate of malignant neoplasms in Russia is 
staying ahead of general population growth and the growth of the 
population over the age of 60. 
  The number of new cases of oncological disease among 
citydwellers increased 1.7-fold in the last 20 years. The number 
of people first diagnosed with malignant growths in Russia rose 
by 23 percent between 1980 and 1991 and reached 394,300, 
corresponding to an average of 1,080 new patients a day. The 
number of patients who died during this period rose by 30 
percent and amounted to 290,500 in 1991 (an average of 796 
deaths a day). Death from malignant neoplasms has reduced the 
average lifespan of the male population of Russia by 2.8 years 
and the female lifespan by 2.2 years. The amount of hypothetical 
unproduced national income resulting from this is 4.1 billion 
rubles (in 1990 prices). The number of new cases of disease is 
expected to rise to 480,000 by the year 2000, or one new case 
each 66 seconds, and the number of deaths is expected to rise to 
346,000 (or 940 a day). Around 18 of every 100 babies born in 
Russia in 1991 could suffer from malignant neoplasms, and the 
average lifespan of patients in some age groups could be as low 
as one-seventeenth of the general lifespan of these age groups 
(Ye. Aksel et al, 1993). The number of people categorized as 
completely disabled by malignant neoplasms exceeded 72,000 in 
1990 in Russia, or 20.2 percent of the total number. 
<H5>  Conclusion </H5>
  The adverse effects of environmental pollution on public 
health in Russia are a genuine threat to national security and 
can affect each of us. According to current estimates, around 20 
percent of the total rate of illness is connected with the 
irritating effects of environmental pollution; in some areas the 
figure can be much higher. Regrettably, conclusive studies 
providing quantitative assessments of the contribution of 
environmental pollution to the development of various diseases 
are extremely few in number. The definite deterioration of 
public health indicators in recent years has been connected with 
environmental pollution and with socioeconomic difficulties. 
  A more complete understanding of the role of environmental 
pollution in changes in the state of public health could result 
from the improvement of several types of activity on the 
federal, regional, and local levels. They include the following: 
  --more detailed reports of the discharges and emissions of 
all potential polluters, with lists of the substances entering 
the atmosphere and surface and ground water, and detailed 
reports of the substances in solid waste disposal sites; 
  --improvements in the pollution monitoring system for more 
complete records of the whole range of pollutants in a specific 
territory and for information about the spatial distribution of 
pollutants; 
  --the widespread use of modern remote methods of emission 
control--such as the laser and sonar systems--for constant and 
current data on pollutants; 
  --a better system of regional and federal public health 
statistics with more detailed breakdowns (by ages and 
territories); 
  --the collection of statistical data for small territories 
that might be subject to the effects of various types of 
pollutants; 
  --analytical epidemiological studies to determine risk and 
dose indicators for specific pollutants and their combinations; 
  --the compilation and implementation of national programs to 
minimize the effects of all substances known to be highly toxic 
(benzpyrene, PAC's, PCB's, radon, beryllium, cadmium, lead, and 
other toxic metals).

  [Text] Today, the administration of Maritime Kray released 
a statement in which it said that dismantling and scrapping of 
atomic submarines is to be halted at the Zvezda yard at the 
settlement of Bolshoy Kamen. Discharge of liquid radioactive 
waste stored aboard the tanker DMT-5 into the Sea of Japan is 
also planned. The tanker is now in a dangerous condition. The 
radioactive waste poses a real threat to Vladivostok and a 
number of areas of Maritime Kray. That was a report from 
POSTFACTUM agency.

<F P=106> [Report by Marat Zubko: "Russia Will Sink Reactors in Kara </F>
Sea"] 
  [Text] Helsinki -- The Norwegian ecological organization 
"Bellona" has found out the details of the forthcoming removal 
from combat service of 150 nuclear submarines in the Northern 
Fleet. 
  "Bellona" members Nils Bemer and Tomas Nilsen [both names as 
transliterated] have gained access to Northern Fleet documents 
which state that in accordance with the START II treaty within 
the next few years Russia must destroy 150 nuclear submarines 
with 278 reactors on board. 
  The authors of the report assert that so far only two 
submarines have been dismantled in the Northern Fleet but that 
nuclear fuel has been removed from the reactors of 34 ships. 
The main part of the submarines will be dismantled in 
Severodvinsk: There they will extract 206 reactors and 45,000 
used fuel elements from the submarines' bellies. 
  The Norwegians claim that new dry docks and storage 
facilities for radioactive waste, and moorings for the 
submarines which have been written off are to be constructed on 
the Kola peninsula. 
  The construction should have begun already but so far the 
majority of establishments are at the planning stage, the report 
says. 
  Of course, some of the fuel elements, the "Bellona" experts 
estimate, could be sent to the "Mayak" storage facility in 
Siberia. But what is to be done with the other fuel elements, 
the reactors themselves, and their reactor rooms? In this 
connection Bemer and Nilsen have the following to say: 
  "Of the documents we have read and the talks we have had 
with 
knowledgeable people it has become clear to us that the Russian 
authorities have two possible courses of action. The first is 
to return to the practice of submerging radioactive waste, 
including reactors, in the Kara Sea, which Russian renounced a 
few years ago. The second is to construct a major new storage 
facility somewhere in the Northwest of Russia." 
  "However," the report's authors continue, "it is known that 
the storage facilities existing on the Kola peninsula are 
already full and there is no money to construct new ones. So we 
believe that the most feasible option is connected with burying 
the waste at sea. Perhaps that is why Russia is not signing the 
London convention which bans the discharge of waste into the 
seas and oceans...."

<F P=106> [Article by SELSKAYA ZHIZN scientific observer Leonid </F>
Kruglov: "Departed From Life; Alarming Ecological Situation in 
Russia Demands Urgent Action"] 
  [Excerpt] [Passage omitted] National environmental 
reports only became public here at the end of the eighties. 
They contain specific information on the current state of our 
environment. They cite data on the amount of harmful substances 
discharged into the atmosphere, the pollution of soil and 
drinking water sources, and the radiation situation. The 
compilation of these reports is painstaking work performed every 
year by environmental experts and specialists. 
  The Russian Federation Ministry of the Environment and 
Natural Resources recently published the latest State Report for 
1992. In the preface to it, Minister V.I. Danilov-Danilyan 
acknowledges that the state of the environment in Russia as a 
whole is unsatisfactory: The atmosphere, water, and soil are 
still being heavily polluted with gaseous, liquid, and solid 
waste from industry and consumers alike. Moreover, as one 
should expect, the general slump in output has not led to a 
similar reduction in pollution, as enterprises in crisis have 
begun to cut environmental protection costs. Thus the economic 
situation in the country is aggravating the environmental 
situation. 
  The facts cited in this document are not for those of a 
nervous disposition. The volume of polluting substances 
discharged into the atmosphere from stationary sources in Russia 
alone amounts to 28.2 million tonnes. Highly toxic cyanides, 
arsenic, fluorides, and heavy metal oxides are spewed from these 
"volcanoes." Their emissions exceed the maximum permissible 
concentration in the air basin of 171 cities. In Chita, 
Taganrog, Lipetsk, Bratsk, and Ulyanovsk -- in fact, a total of 
44 industrial centers in Russia -- the atmospheric pollution 
index has reached a level dangerous to the health of millions of 
people. 
  With one-quarter of the world's fresh water resources 
concentrated in Lake Baykal, we are contriving to pollute these 
crystal-clear waters with toxins from outmoded pulp and paper 
combines. The fabled lake's own mechanism of biological 
self-purification is on the brink of collapse. What then can 
one say about ordinary reservoirs? In 1992, 39 percent of all 
untreated sewage flowing into Russia's rivers was discharged 
into the Volga basin alone. 
  Due to economic difficulties, the use of pesticides in 
agriculture fell from 150,000 tonnes in the eighties to 100,000 
tonnes in 1992. But supporters of the green movement have no 
cause to celebrate. Russia uses tens, if not hundreds of 
different types of toxic chemicals banned in the countries where 
they are produced, but with a market here because of their low 
price. They are extremely toxic. Moreover, these toxins have 
the ability to accumulate in the soil for long periods of time. 
Analysis shows that soil in Moscow Oblast and Irkutsk Oblast 
still contains DDT, banned many years ago. 
  We will not try to explain what all these "curies" and other 
units for measuring radiation levels mean. For the majority of 
people, these scientific terms mean nothing, but their lives are 
no easier for all that. As of January 1993, the territory 
polluted with radioactive nuclides from Chernobyl -- cesium-137 
averaging one to five "curies" per square kilometer -- includes 
16 oblasts and Mordovia. A total of 21,861,000 people currently 
live there, mainly villagers. By law, they are all due state 
benefits and compensation. But who will guarantee that even 
these few "curies" will not affect the health of future 
generations? Once again, it seems, we are going to rely on the 
Russian "maybe." Wait and see. But will we live to see? 
  Analysis of the information in the State Report allows us to 
draw the uncomfortable conclusion that all these negative 
ecological factors put together have led to a serious 
deterioration in the environment in the main regions where tens 
of millions of Russians live. Living there is dangerous, and 
turning a blind eye is criminal. 
  No assurances and entreaties that everything will be better 
in the future arouse enthusiasm in anyone anymore. We need a 
long-term, single-minded program of action. From this point of 
view, we would like to assess the constructiveness of the 
Russian Presidential Edict "On the State Strategy of the Russian 
Federation To Protect the Environment and Ensure Steady 
Development," published in February this year. Is there, for 
example, any real foundation to the government directive to 
approve within two months a plan of action to protect the 
environment in 1994-95? 
  The basic principles of the strategy, in the drafting of 
which the Russian Federation Ministry of the Environment and 
Natural Resources and the Russian Federation Security Council 
Interdepartmental Commission for Environmental Safety took part, 
provide for the environmentally sound location and development 
of industrial and agricultural enterprises; sustainable and 
rational use of natural resources; protection of the environment 
in areas of human habitation; the restoration of shattered 
ecosystems; the utilization of waste; and other urgent measures 
conducive to improvement of the environment in Russia. 
  The time given to implement the edict is extremely short. 
There is much to do. Sources of pollution in environmental 
"hotspots" -- areas where it is simply dangerous to live -- 
should be eliminated first and foremost. The state must make 
all the necessary budgetary allocations. There is no 
alternative when the nation's health is at stake. 
  It is up to the state to call those directly responsible for 
environmental damage strictly to account. Anyone who breaks the 
Russian Law on Protection of the Environment must be made to 
pay. With the transition to market relations, sources of 
investment in national environmental safety are broadening 
considerably. The taxpayer is not obliged to pay for someone 
else's economic mistakes. This also applies to the 
agro-industrial complex. 
  Any producer -- however vital his product may be -- must be 
placed in the situation where, because of the risk of being 
ruined, it is to his disadvantage to engage in economic 
operations which pollute rivers, soil, or atmosphere. 
  If the environment suffers, do not expect any return. This 
principle must become mandatory for all. Sometimes, however, 
this return is within arm's reach. Let us take a specific 
example. Any poultry plant, apart from anything else, is a 
major "supplier" of extremely valuable organic fertilizer. With 
mineral fertilizers expensive and in short supply, it is 
perfectly realistic to develop the technology of biothermal 
processing of the droppings, thereby setting up production of 
poudrette, fertility grains. Progressive private farms are 
already successfully selling the surplus of this valuable 
product to farms and kitchen gardens both here and abroad at a 
considerable profit. At present, however, toxic waste from big 
state poultry plants continues to pollute underground springs 
and rivers, for which fines are paid amidst cries of being on 
the brink of closure because of the high price of mixed feed. 
  The economic principle must form the basis of the mechanism 
for the use of natural resources in our country. It is naive to 
assume that the Ministry of the Environment and Natural 
Resources is solely responsible for instilling order in this 
respect. It certainly is not a departmental matter: It is a 
matter of state. 
  The time for debates and discussions on the methods and 
approaches to deciding upon a strategy of national environmental 
salvation is long gone. It is time to act! 
  There is a scientific term: Survival. It concerns all 
living beings, man included. People, like any other creature on 
this planet, need clean air, unpolluted water, and good soil -- 
a source of food. Russia's citizens have a constitutional right 
to a decent environment. This must not be forgotten in the face 
of future generations.

<F P=106> [From the "Vesti" newscast: Video report from Vladivostok </F>
by M. Voznesenskiy and V. Domovidov, identified by caption] 
  [Text] [170848] [Voznesenskiy over video of Kozyrev 
arrival at Vladivostok airport] The Maritime Kray 
Administration had a special stake in the meeting of the heads 
of the Russian and U.S. foreign policy deparments at Vladivostok 
airport. 
  The point is that the situation around the construction of 
installations for reprocessing liquid nuclear waste from our 
nuclear submarines has become deadlocked: On the one hand the 
Japanese are ready to share this problem with us, and provide us 
with both money and equipment. But on one condition only.... 
  [Ye. Nozdratenko, head of Maritime Kray Administration, 
identified by caption] Namely that this installation is built 
in Maritime Kray and that the money goes to the Maritime Kray 
Administration without the involvement of any central organs. 
That is to say that all work is carried out directly, without 
any middlemen, under Japanese supervision. 
  [Voznesenskiy] Well, he who pays the piper calls the tune. 
Maritime Kray Governor Yevgeniy Nozdratenko said that he has 
secured Foreign Minister Andrey Kozyrev's support and that the 
construction of the first such installation, offered by the 
Japanese company Nissho Iwai, at Bolshoy Kamen's "Zvezda" 
nuclear submarine repair plant is an entirely realistic 
proposition. Another installation of this kind is to be built at 
a Pacific Fleet nuclear waste storage facility. [170949]

  [Text] Academic (Sarkisov) of the Russian Academy of 
Agricultural Sciences today revealed a sensational report. It 
so happens that the grain left over since last autumn on many 
millions of hectares of land could damage people's health. As a 
result of an expert examination, it has been proved that corn, 
wheat, millet, and rye which remained in the fields over the 
winter have been polluted by nicotoxins [nikotoksiny] which lead 
to incurable illnesses if they get into the system of a human 
being or animal.

<F P=106> [By BUSINESS-TASS] </F>
  [Text] Moscow March 25 TASS -- The Maritime Administration 
has put into question a possibility to implement the Russian 
summit statements on termination of liquid low-radioactive waste 
dumping in the Pacific Ocean, sources at the Department of 
Information and Public Relations of the Russian Ministry of 
Nuclear Power engineering told BUSINESS-TASS today. 
  Money for the maritime processing of this waste and 
utilization has not been allocated. Russia has a shortage of 
money and some projects, including ecological, are scarcely not 
financed. In early March an official representative of the 
Finance Ministry said the problem will be solved in the near 
future, but there have been no results. 
  The problem of utilization of water from Russian subs' 
nuclear reactors aggravated in mid-October. Some 900 cubic 
meters of liquid waste was dumped and some 700 cubic meters more 
were waiting for their turn. All this provoked a negative 
reaction of the international public, meanwhile the dumping was 
coordinated with the International Atomic Energy Agency and the 
competent Russian ministries. 
  Great Britain and France have the right to similar dumping 
till 2018, and Japan is also dumping its radioactive waste in 
the sea. 
  The problem of Russian radioactive waste utilization can be 
solved only by the construction of special decontaminating 
installations. Russia has not received the promised Western 
assistance, and a special tanker for waste storage offered by 
Japan appeared to be useless.

<F P=106> [Article by Vladimir Yermolin: "Chemical Weapons Must Be </F>
Destroyed. But It Is an Expensive Business"] 
  [Text] The parliamentary hearings in the State Duma 
Thursday [24 March] showed how complex the situation is in 
connection with Russia's international commitments in the sphere 
of the destruction of chemical weapons (CW). Defense Ministry 
spokesman Maj. Gen. Yuriy Tarasevich stressed that the military 
department expects the deputies to provide legislative support 
in such a difficult and expensive business as the destruction of 
chemical weapons. According to the military, the blueprint for 
CW destruction needs to be legislatively formalized. A draft 
blueprint will be presented to the State Duma in mid-April. We 
also need laws on CW destruction and on the social protection of 
the population in areas where these weapons are being destroyed. 
  Funding for all measures connected with preparations for the 
actual recovery of toxic substances and munitions is extremely 
uneven and inadequate. Getting rid of Russian chemical weapons 
will cost two trillion rubles [R] in 1993 prices. Meanwhile, 
some R10.4 billion are supposed to be allocated for this purpose 
in the current year. But we all know full well how funds are 
being allocated this year. The CW disarmament program is no 
exception. 
  There was a note of anxiety in what Maj. Gen. Yuriy 
Tarasevich said. A number of arsenals established back in the 
fifties in Udmurtia and Saratov Oblast are in need of a complete 
overhaul. In existing conditions such an overhaul is a very 
difficult and dangerous business. One would like this to be not 
an exlusively military headache. Let us hope the hearings go 
some way toward this. 
  The military-political aspects of Russia's joining the 
Convention on the Destruction of Chemical Weapons were also 
examined during the hearings. The inevitable question arose: 
Might it not happen that our country will abandon this type of 
weapon, while other countries, including those bordering on 
Russia, will remain "chemically" armed and, moreover, will reach 
a new level as a result of scientific developments? In general 
terms the Foreign Ministry and Defense Ministry spokesmen 
assured those present that in this case there are reliable 
control mechanisms in place and the world community provides 
certain guarantees. But the detailed reply to this question 
obviously had to wait until the hearings resumed behind closed 
doors. 
  We would point out that the Convention on Chemical Weapons 
was signed in Paris in 1993. So far it has been signed by 156 
states. But it has been ratified by only four: Sweden, 
Mauritius, the Seychelles, and Fiji. Whether Russia is to 
become the fifth depends on how convincing the Foreign and 
Defense Ministries' pro-ratification arguments are in the eyes 
of the parliamentarians. All I would say is that, in the event 
of ratification, we will be able to count on financial 
assistance from Western countries and the United States.

  [Text] The Maritime region's administration has no right to 
authorize the dumping of radioactive liquid into the Sea of 
Japan since only Russia's government is entitled to make such a 
decision. This was told to Interfax by Nikolay Shapovalenko, the 
head of the atomic supervision committee's department for 
overseeing radiation safety at defence facilities. 
  The Chairman of the Maritime Region's Committee for Natural 
Resources Evgeniy Stomatyuk announced in Vladivostok on Thursday 
that next week the local administration may adopt a decision on 
the dumping of radioactive waste because the Pacific Fleet's 
TNT-5 and TNT-27 waste storage vessels were in dangerous 
condition. 
  According to Shapovalenko, Russia abstained from signing an 
amendment to the International Convention on Waste Utilization, 
which completely prohibits the dumping of any radioactive waste. 
  "Thereby, Russia reserved the right to decide on radiation 
safety issues in handling waste as it finds fit for its national 
interests," Shaposhnikov said and stressed that "no local leader 
is authorized to allow the dumping of radioactive pollutants." 
  He reported that the government had approved a plan for 
putting a nuclear waste processing plant into operation within 
three months. However, he declined to say when the project would 
start to be implemented since the government had not decided who 
would fund it. 
  His organization believes that the Maritime Region's 
Governor 
Evgeniy Nazdratenko favors a Japanese waste processing facility 
and rejects for some reasons "the actually existing and 
effective blue-prints designed by various organizations in the 
Far East and elsewhere." 
  According to the nuclear supervision committee, the Japanese 
nuclear waste purification technology is far better than the 
Russian project. "If Japan's offer is accepted, an electric 
station will have to be build next to the waste processing 
plant," Shapovalenko said. 
  Meanwhile, as a senior Russian navy officer told Interfax 
the 
situation with the storage of radioactive contaminants in the 
Far East "is appalling and calls for urgent measures." "If the 
local environmental protection agency approves the regional 
administration's decision, theoretically I admit the possibility 
of nuclear waste dumping into the Sea of Japan," he said. 
  In his opinion, the local authorities "simply have to act in 
such a manner since the government fails to allocate any 
resources to solve the problem of storing radioactive 
pollutants."

<F P=106> [ITAR-TASS report: "What the Dumping of Toxic Substance </F>
Threatens?"] 
  [Text] The railcars containing industrial waste from 
France, the Netherlands, and Israel which have been halted for 
almost 50 days in the Orenburg area have "won" worldwide 
notoriety. The international environmental organization 
Greenpeace has drawn attention to the trainload of harmful, 
toxic substances and demanded that France remove the dangerous 
consignment from Russia. 
  What is the nub of the issue here? "The train comprising 16 
cars carrying waste products arrived in Orsk for reprocessing at 
the Yuzhuralnikel combine, but the waste products turned out to 
contain high levels of harmful substances such as cadmium (up to 
15 percent), thallium (2-3 percent), and arsenic. The train was 
sent further into the steppe -- to the Buruktal combine, in 
Svetlinskiy Rayon. We do not have the techniques for detecting 
these toxic substances," Chief State Inspector Viktor Blinov, 
first deputy chairman of Orenburg Oblast's Environment 
Committee, said. 
  It is impossible to send the train back, as we have no 
address, he stressed, explaining: "As soon as the cargo crossed 
the border at St. Petersburg the consignor relinquished all 
responsibility. The customhouse at Astovo station let the train 
in. It clearly should be called to account. And it is strange 
that the certificate of quality for the raw materials was a week 
late in coming, by which time the train was already in Buruktal." 
  Viktor Blinov is worried: With the onset of spring the 
likelihood of the cadmium, thallium, and arsenic "escaping from 
the sacks into the environment" increases. He considers that 
"each sack must be placed in a separate metal container. This 
constitutes a lot of labor-intensive work requiring not just 
caution but also huge amounts of money." 
  Svetlinskiy Rayon administration chief Vasiliy Yeremenko has 
"evicted" the train from his territory. It has been moved in 
the direction of Orsk. The wagons are now halted in a railroad 
siding.

Project for Protecting the Black Sea From Pollution"] 
  [Text] The international program for the protection and 
utilization of Black Sea resources under the aegis of the UN and 
the World Environmental Protection Fund is to finance projects 
aimed at fighting pollution in the Black Sea. The World Bank 
has allocated $320,000 to elaborate an investment plan for 
cleaning the Poti and Batumi shorelines (the construction of new 
water and sewage works and the reconstruction of old ones and 
the liquidation of heaps of toxic waste that constitute a danger 
to the environment). 
  "The water treatment plants in the cities of Poti and Batumi 
are currently not in operation. The regions adjoining these 
towns are claiming the status of ecological disaster zones," 
stated Zurab Nogaideli, chairman of the Commission for the 
Protection of the Environment. According to Nogaideli, a 
minimum of $10-15 million will be needed in order to implement 
the projects aimed at cleaning the Black Sea coastline in the 
regions of Batumi and Poti.

<F P=106> [Article by Danius Lygis, counsellor of the Parliamentary </F>
Environmental Protection Committee: "How and Why the 
Administration of the Environmental Protection Should Be 
Restructured?"] 
  [Text] During the last decade not a single area of activity 
has experienced so many administrative restructurings as the 
protection of nature and then of the environment. There are 
various reasons why no room is being found for environmental 
protection. The main reason, in my opinion, is that 
environmental protection is being constantly confronted to 
economics and that is why it is compelled to "run from behind," 
to control and not to form the policies of the development of 
state economy. 
  Only three years have passed since the reorganization, and 
again there are plans to restructure the system of environmental 
protection. Discussions of the draft law "On the Elimination of 
the Department of Environmental Protection of the Republic of 
Lithuania and On the Founding of the Ministry of the 
Environmental Protection and Natural Resources of the Republic 
of Lithuania" have begun in the Parliament. 
  This restructuring has both supporters and enemies. Some 
complain about haste, others about delay, and a third group is 
proposing new variants of restructuring. To form a more 
objective opinion, we should briefly survey the present 
condition of the management of environmental protection in 
Lithuania. 
  Following the restoration of Lithuania's independence in 
1990, the environmentalists anticipated the dangers of the 
future reforms and proposed a new model of environmental 
protection (although they did not even agree among themselves 
which model of administration they should choose). A Department 
of Environmental Protection was established and it was 
subordinate only to the highest, i.e., law-making power. Yet 
such subordination was effective only up to the first obstacle. 
For instance, any attempt to correct the activity of the 
Department of Environmental Protection or to abolish 
disagreements between it and other departments or local 
administrations leads to a blind alley -- to put this into 
effect, a parliamentary decision is necessary. But the 
Parliament already has plenty of work, and a lot of time goes by 
until such an organizational question is put on the Parliament's 
agenda, except in the case of ecological problems or conflicts 
on the national level that would make the Parliament react and 
take decisions without delay. If the Department of Environmental 
Protection would be part of the Government structure, a 
governmental or the Prime Minister's decision would be enough to 
take care of many conflicts. But the Parliament reserves the 
right to control the activity of any minister and to express 
lack of confidence in any minister. 
  The Department of Environmental Protection is not 
functionally connected with the Parliament and only formally 
reports to it once a year. The department exists next to the 
Government and the Parliament. Because of such gaps that were 
left in the model of administration, the institution becomes 
unmanageable, begins to live for itself, and the department 
loses the direct practical links. In the governmental sessions, 
the department's leaders are limited to a mere deliberative 
vote. Therefore it happens that the governmental structures 
ignore the department's directives. In such cases, it is again 
necessary to turn to the Parliament... 
  The essential shortcoming of this administrative model is 
that it does not allow for a simultaneous solution of economic 
and ecological problems, as it would be appropriate, but 
separates them artificially. In fact, the Department of 
Environmental Protection is limited to only a formal 
participation when the Government prepares the strategic 
programs of the reconstruction of economy, energetics, 
transport, agriculture, and others. The department creates its 
own programs for the protection of the environment separately 
from the Government. They are not being coordinated, and the 
result is an ineffective use of energy and a waste of funds. 
  Of course, the transformation of the department into a 
ministry will not do anything good if the Government itself will 
not slowly renounce economic functions and will not strive to 
integrate management by issuing new ministry regulations. There 
will be little change, if the internal structure of the future 
ministry will be formed by disregarding the principle of the 
delimitation of functions, responsibility and accountability. 
  During the discussions on the territorial administrative 
reform, which took place in the Parliament at the beginning of 
this year, the Prime Minister surveyed the future of the state 
management and remarked that the Government is ready to pass the 
economic functions to the local administrations. If this is 
really the case, then the issue of property and other economic 
questions would not impede the Government's execution of state 
policy and the adoption of impartial decisions related to the 
protection of the environment and the use of natural resources. 
  It is already clear that it is inexpedient to separate 
control from the other functions of the future ministry. If the 
Ministry of the Protection of the Environment has no right of 
control, then it, in the words of V. Adamkus, is a "toothless 
granny." Should two institutions be created that control the 
same area? Somebody may gain from that, but it will not be 
Lithuania's nature.

<F P=106> [Article by Valentyn Smaga, news editor: "Bureaucratic Feast </F>
During Environmental Famine, or, Melancholy Reflections on the 
Fact That the Ukraine Environment Ministry Should Not Be 
Reshuffled Again"] 
  [Text] Hot facts 
  I confess. In over 20 years of work in the Ukrainian press I 
have often caught myself being prejudiced against some agencies 
and organizations. Except for one, which I have served 
faithfully for a number of years. Not the office itself, of 
course, but its underlying idea, which, unless fully 
implemented, would make life in Ukraine impossible. 
  This organization used to be called the UkSSR State 
Environmental Committee; now its title is the Ministry for the 
Protection of the Environment of Ukraine. But I would like to 
call it the Ministry of Survival, because unfortunately the 
direst forecasts are coming true. On the population growth chart 
of Ukraine, the curves measuring live births and deaths came 
together in 1990 at a very tragic point, at which our nation has 
begun to die out physically. 
  I found that chart in the National Report on the State of 
the 
Environment in Ukraine, which, in accordance to the law, the 
ministry must submit annually to the Supreme Council. I will 
discuss these reports--there have already been two of them, for 
1992 and 1993--below. Now, let us cite the axiom: the 
environmental crisis is global in character and it can be 
resolved only by mankind in its entirety and, on the state 
level, by the authorities at the highest level. In other words, 
our chances for survival depend on the level of authority of the 
country's highest environmental protection entity. 
  What kind of organization was the UkSSR State Environmental 
Committee is painful to recall. Officials in oblast and rayon 
committees, hired for minuscule wages, had one responsibility 
only: to rubber-stamp decisions harmful to the environment 
issued by higher authorities. I have been friends with many of 
them and understand very well how difficult it is to oppose 
bureaucratic demands. One must have tremendous courage to defend 
from a hare-brained project a national landmark, the Khortytsya 
island in Zaporozhye oblast, for example, or to fight the 
Danube-Dniepr canal, or to oppose the construction of the Crimea 
nuclear power station. 
  For articles on this issue, written with the help of my 
trusted assistants from the State Environment Committee, I won a 
number of top awards of the late USSR. Then, the empire began to 
crumble. Before its collapse, the command-administrative system 
of the Union tried making cosmetic changes when it issued the 
resolution "On Fundamental Restructuring of Environmental 
Protection in the Country," which caused a major bout of musical 
chairs to be played at environment protection agencies. The 
Committee was changed into a ministry, but the power over our 
land remained in the hands of monopolies. That was the full 
extent of the achievement. 
  Later, at the time of the so-called perestroyka, on the wave 
of popular outrage over the Chernobyl disaster, a powerful 
environmental protection movement emerged in the country. I was 
one of the founders of the Green World. I left it because 
politics started to grow in influence there. I believe that it 
is a deadly sin to make a career out of a severe national 
ecological disaster, and that the public must concentrate all 
its efforts on creating a powerful state environmental 
protection agency that would be equal to, for example, the 
Prosecutor General. Unfortunately, careers are being made but 
the cause does not advance. 
  Then came the sacred light of independence, and a generally 
progressive law "On the Protection of the Environment" which for 
the first time in our history established a system of ecological 
security for the people. Serious, calm and responsible people 
were placed at the head of the ministry and old painful problems 
began to be addressed. 
  And what now? Nothing. An adequate environmental protection 
system, which barely began to be formed in the country, has been 
dealt a typical, and I fear mortal, blow. And it was done 
cleanly. Based on the presidential decree on government service, 
the ministry is being cut by 30 percent, apparently along 
definite lines. The attestation process is already underway; 
then there will be a reshuffle of agency personnel, wasting 
valuable expertise gained by experienced employees. 
  I agree that many existing ministries can be easily cut back 
by as much as 50 percent. But the Ministry of Survival should 
have its staff tripled, and its authority considerably extended. 
Everyone who attentively follows current processes in Ukraine 
will notice that every stupid action by the authorities is 
extremely rational from the point of view of the private 
interests of its authors. Take just two of Ukraine Cabinet of 
Ministers resolutions, No. 18, dated 13 January 1992, and No. 
373, dated 7 July 1992. They effectively destroyed the 
painstakingly built system of fines for polluting the 
environment. It turns out, then, that a powerful environmental 
ministry with real economic power and influence is not needed? 
It is a rhetorical question. The answer is obvious. For a good 
10 years, I have been repeating in the press that a state 
environmental protection agency can only be effective if its 
independence from executive power is fully guaranteed. As that 
of the parliament, the prosecutor and the press is in all 
civilized states. This is one of the main conditions for the 
survival of the people and, hence, the country. 
  Perhaps we should not frighten the readers with the 
comprehensive picture of the destruction of nature contained in 
the National Report on the State of the Environment in Ukraine 
for the last two years, which the Environment Ministry sent to 
the country's parliament. Our chamber of representatives, having 
suspended the moratorium on the construction of nuclear power 
stations, has, in my opinion, clearly demonstrated its true 
attitude on this major problem in the life of the people. 
  The report is a major effort by a large group of 
specialists. 
Last year's document is distinguished by greater depth and a 
broader conception compared to the one drafted in 1992. It not 
only presents data on the condition of the ground, the water and 
the air and on the impact of pollution, including radioactive 
pollution, on the health of the population, but also proposes a 
program for what in my opinion is the most important issue: 
environmental protection reform in Ukraine. 
  This reform will be comprised of three stages. The first 
will 
consist, primarily, of establishing an effective environmental 
protection system of ecological security and of drafting a 
number of legislative acts to ensure it. The second stage will 
be to develop and implement comprehensive programs to solve 
priority problems to balance the level of environmental 
pollution with nature's ability to regenerate itself. Finally, 
the third stage will be to build a system of managing 
environmental resources and regulating the technological impact 
on them at a level where the resolution of such problems would 
become the foundation for steady development of society. 
  We have conquered nature. Now, thank God, we have realized 
that we have been stupidly fighting our own mother and will 
survive only if we make peace with her and subjugate the life of 
society to this peace. 
  Perhaps we should not recount journalistically this enormous 
analytical work. But the final chapter of the National Report 
for 1993 contains the following recommendation for this year: 
"Due to the uncertainty of changes taking place in the Ukrainian 
economy, it is important to ensure qualitative and quantitative 
changes to improve the environmental situation in Ukraine." 
  This is how we live. The environment is hostage to the 
economy. The latter, in turn, is fully dependent on politics. 
But will the future Ukrainian parliament be willing to heed the 
dire warnings contained in the National Report? Meanwhile, the 
bureaucratic feast during the environmental famine which is 
taking place today is certain to curb the fighting spirit of the 
Environment Ministry further. This is why I do not hide the aim 
of my article: supporters of environmental protection must make 
themselves heard and to try to stop cuts which so resemble a 
slaughter.

<F P=106> [From the "Business News Weekly" feature No 12, 14-20 Mar 94] </F>
  [Text] On April 1, 1994 the Cabinet's resolution becomes 
effective, which was approved on February 22 and specifies 
procedures for bringing to Ukraine or transferring across its 
territory wastes and secondary raw materials, as well as sets a 
list of materials banned from importation into Ukraine as 
hazardous or toxic. 
  The resolution also defines procedures for license issuance 
to transfer such materials across Ukraine's territory. 
  The resolution specifies that both bringing to Ukraine and 
transit of such materials without permits from the Ministry for 
natural environment protection are forbidden. 
  Commenting on the resolution at Ukrinform's request 
Ukraine's 
Minister for natural environment protection Yuriy Kostenko noted 
that the document was an element of a comprehensive package of 
documents, which the Ministry and other relevant departments 
were drafting in order to adjust Ukraine's legislation to 
accepted international norms and standards. 
  The List of groups of substances and materials, which belong 
to the category of hazardous wastes and are banned from 
importation into Ukraine, was drafted based on lists, which are 
contained in the documents of the Basel Convention of 1989 "On 
Control over Transborder Transfer of Hazardous Wastes and Their 
Disposal". 
  On March 21 through 25 Geneva is supposed to host a meeting 
of the parties to the Basel Convention to discuss, in 
particular, the Convention's ratification procedural issues and 
their accedence to it. The Ukrainian Ministry's delegation is 
also to attend the meeting. 
  Yevgeniy Motorin, chief of the Ministry's ecological safety 
agency, singled out the following major legal safeguards, which 
the resolution contains: 
  -- the amount of wastes should correspond to the designated 
enterprise's reprocessing capacity; 
  -- the contract should specify that in case of importation 
of 
substandard raw materials and wastes to be reprocessed in 
Ukraine, the importer is bound to take them out of Ukraine at 
his expense; 
  -- the custom-house is responsible for exercising due 
control 
over transborder carriage of wastes, in accordance with the 
active legislation. 
  Besides, the Law of Ukraine of February 25, 1994 complements 
the Criminal Code of Ukraine with an article, which specifies 
that importation of banned materials into Ukraine is actionable 
and entails punishment up to three years of imprisonment. 
Importation into or transit across Ukraine's territory of 
wastes and secondary raw materials without due permits entails 
fines in amounts of 150 minimal wages. 
  As Ye. Motorin thinks, the state's support for environmental 
safety is inadequate. There are only three garbage incineration 
facilities in Ukraine. 
  The state budget provides for 1.638 trillion karbovanets 
allocated for natural environment protection. Factual 
allocation, though, is barely enough to support the Ministry for 
natural environment protection alone.

<F P=106> [Report by Fayina Zlotnyk: "We Will Get $6 Million More"] </F>
  [Text] The Ukrainian Environmental Protection Ministry 
press center reported that Yuriy Kostenko, minister for 
protection of Ukrainian environment, returned from an official 
trip to the Netherlands and the United States. 
  During his stay in the Netherlands, a memorandum was signed 
on ecologic cooperation between the Ukrainian Ministry of 
Environmental Protection, and the Ministry of Construction, 
Territorial Planning and Environment, the Ministry of 
Transportation, Public Works and Water Management, and the 
Ministry of Agriculture, Fishing and Nature of the Netherlands. 
  This memorandum provides for cooperation in the sphere of 
ecologic management and the protection of air, water, and 
wildlife. It was agreed that a working cooperation program for 
1994-95 will be approved in early April. 
  In the United States, where Yuriy Kostenko was invited to 
visit the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, he met with 
officials from this agency, the World Bank, the Agency for 
International Development, the Department of Energy, and the 
U.S. Congress. 
  The U.S. officials displayed a deep interest in cooperation 
between Ukraine and the United States in the sphere of ecology, 
and examined a package of proposals about urgent environmental 
protection measures, such as the creation of modern laboratories 
monitoring radiation levels and water quality, recycling of 
toxic waste, launching educational television programs, and 
finally establishing an informational and educational center. 
The American side is planning to allocate $6 million to 
implement the above projects. This will be an addition to the 
$500,000 that the World Bank granted the Environmental Ministry 
last year to carry out a project called "Preservation of 
Biological Diversity of Carpathians." The American colleagues 
are ready to continue to share with us their experience and 
technologies, and want to train our specialists and provide 
financial assistance.

  [Text] Only "as much Community as necessary." 
  Environmental protection in the European Community has 
long meant a search for the smallest common denominator. The 
Maastricht Treaty has introduced a change of course: the 
individual countries are no longer tied to minimum 
standards. 
  European environmental policy has always been an enigmatic 
discipline. Usually only lawyers, administrative specialists and 
confirmed Eurocrats could find their way in the confusion of 
guidelines, regulations, deadlines and exceptions. Nearly 
always, however, the simple rubric "Environmental policy [based] 
on the smallest common denominator" went to the heart of the 
matter. 
  The Maastricht Treaty rewrote this formula. In future 
decisions the vote of the majority will count, unanimity among 
member countries is no longer necessary. Second, the treaty 
strengthens the jurisdiction of the European Parliament. For 
example, in the future a new guideline on waste policy will no 
longer merely have to be noted by the EP but will require the 
approval of the Parliament. 
  This can easily lead to confusion as the discussion on the 
long-planned guideline on packaging and packaging waste shows. 
In December of last year the Council of Ministers on the 
Environment reached an agreement on collection and disposal 
quotas which are lower than the German quotas taken from the 
packaging regulations. "First rate stupidity," Heinrich von 
Lersner, President of the Federal Office of the Environment in 
Berlin, says angrily whenever the subject comes up. Should the 
collection-happy Germans just throw away more trash again? No, 
since a compromise reached shortly before Christmas provides 
that the--relatively low--EU quotas may be exceeded throughout 
at the national level. 
  This does not yet, however, bring the matter of the EU 
packaging guidelines to a close. "It is certainly possible," Dr. 
Jan C. Bongaerts, Director of the Institute for European 
Environmental Policy in Bonn, suggests, "that the European 
Parliament will not agree to this compromise." The consequence: 
the negotiations would have to begin again from scratch. 
  Is Brussels more progressive than Bonn? Or are the Germans 
more environmentally conscientious than the rest of the EU? 
There have always been discussions about these questions. Gudrun 
Lammers, EU representative from the environmental group 
Greenpeace, laments a "clear democracy deficit" in the 
environmental policy from Brussels. "Naturally, much remained 
behind German standards," agrees the SPD [Social Democratic 
Party of Germany] Europe delegate Klaus Haensch. His colleague 
Dagmar Roth-Behrendt suggests on the contrary that "70% 
solutions are still better than if several countries were to do 
nothing at all." 
  Dagmar Roth-Behrendt chips away at the image of the Germans 
who all too gladly see themselves as the paragons of 
environmental protection. "Instead, the European Union 
accelerated German legislation on environmental protection," she 
made clear at an SPD function last week in Berlin. Even more: 
Germany, too, has already had to suffer defeats before the 
European Court; for example, for the tardy implementation of the 
guidelines on environmental compatibility testing as well as on 
drinking and ground water protection. 
  Brussels environmental policy may possibly become more 
effective from the change in the trend. However, SPD Bundestag, 
or Federal Parliament, member Liesel Hartenstein notices in 
Brussels a "clear tendency toward a weakening of environmental 
standards." As one piece of evidence she mentions the drinking 
water guidelines, which would again make higher nitrate values 
permissible in Germany in the future. Also, the herbicide 
atrazine, which is forbidden here, could theoretically once 
again be available on the market in Germany. Additionally, Great 
Britain wants to make the mixed dumping of household trash and 
industrial waste possible with a guideline on waste dumping. And 
France is petitioning before the European Court against the 
prohibition currently in force in Germany banning 
pentachlorophenol (PCP), an active ingredient in wood 
preservatives. 
  No one can say whether European environmental policy will 
become more lucid. In any case, in the future the European Union 
will in many cases only provide the outline [of a policy] which 
the member countries will then fill in. In this way the 
individual countries will be permitted greater flexibility. 
There is already a great deal of concern from the Germans that 
the rubric "as much Community as necessary, as much independence 
as possible" is more likely to cement distortions in competition 
in the EU than to tear them down. 
  This discussion can be best followed at the current time 
from 
the planned guideline for the Integrated Avoidance and Reduction 
of Environmental Pollution (IPC). The guideline establishes 
standards for the approval of industrial facilities. [By 
following the standards], it shall thus be determined which 
environmental option is best at any given time in an individual 
case. This [approach] provides flexibility in two respects: 
since the totality of the environmental effects of a facility 
are taken into account, a disproportionately low level of air 
pollution, for example, can balance out higher levels of toxins 
in waste water or large amounts of waste materials. 
  In addition, the preexisting level of pollution in a region 
is taken into consideration. In the case of lower initial 
pollution with maintenance of specified emission limits, there 
may in individual cases be a deviation downward from the state 
of the art [in pollution control policy]. 
  The environmental policy makers in Bonn have difficulty with 
this new thinking. "There are no standards for comparison and no 
standard values for various environmental mediums," objects Kurt 
Schaefer, Director of the Emission Protection section in the 
Federal Ministry of the Environment. Bonn, therefore, has 
absolutely no intention of approving the IPC guidelines as they 
are currently formulated. 
  Another reason for German opposition lies in the planned 
change in the practice of granting approvals. The guideline will 
in general streamline the approval procedure for [industrial] 
facilities; in the so-called spoke system, a single authority 
shall have overall control of granting the authorization. That 
means that individual approval [processes] conforming to various 
laws would be combined together. 
  That would be a fundamental departure from the German 
practice of granting authorizations. Until now several 
specialized authorities would decide on an approval--this basic 
tenet would be invalidated by the IPC guideline. And thinking 
does not yet extend this far into European dimensions. As 
Schaefer says: "The integrated concept is not compatible with 
the German system and is therefore difficult to implement."

  [Text] In the past, progress in environmental protection 
was achieved overwhelmingly by applying technological measures 
downstream, as in the case of filter, washing, and sorption 
systems for dedusting and exhaust gas cleaning, clarification 
methods for treating effluent, and biological, chemical, and 
thermal plants for treating waste. Successful though the use of 
these downstream treatment methods may be, the future of 
environmental engineering lies in preventive measures that avoid 
the occurrence of pollution from the outset. The new 
"Production-Integrated Environment Protection" funding program 
will support the development of industrial production methods 
that contribute to the avoidance of pollution at source, to the 
cyclic economy, and to resource conservation. 
  The development and introduction of new production processes 
entails considerable expense and risk because radical changes in 
the production process are required without detriment to the 
quality of the end product. This is why industry is slow to 
adopt preventive technologies. Remedial measures still account 
for about 80 percent of environmental protection investment. 
However, it must be borne in mind that those who avoid 
environmental pollution today by adopting integrated environment 
protection technology, conserve resources by closing circuits, 
and recycle products that have outlived their usefulness will 
save on the expense of pollution disposal tomorrow. A whole 
series of pioneering solutions already available shows that 
ecological issues can be fully reconciled with economic 
considerations. 
  Firms in the new federal laender have special opportunities 
for converting industrial production methods to take account of 
the environment, as the technologies of the future should be 
installed there from the outset to replace obsolete technologies 
and defunct markets. The process of building up new production 
capacities should take account of the principles of 
production-integrated environment protection for economic and 
ecological reasons, as this is where the decisive market 
advantages will lie in the long term. 
  The "Production-Integrated Environment Protection" funding 
program is primarily directed at processes and products 
involving low-degradability or nondegradable substances or 
blends of substances. It seeks an integrated approach taking in 
the whole production process from raw material extraction to the 
treatment of unavoidable residues: 
  -- Environment- and resource-conserving extraction of raw 
materials from the biosphere; 
  -- Environment-friendly, low-waste and emission production 
processes achieved by replacing polluting raw and process 
materials, modifying the process technology, and closing the 
entire process circuit; 
  -- Maximum recycling of production residues and reuse in 
other production processes (networking of production processes); 
  -- Environment-compatible product design making for 
environment-friendly use, maintenance, and recycling or 
reprocessing, and 
  -- Return to the biosphere of residues that cannot be 
recycled in an environment-compatible form achievable by 
pretreatment. 
  Production process conversion will be backed up by 
ecobalances and product line analyses. The systematic closing 
of material circuits is expected to bring economic advantages as 
well. Product-integrated environment protection thus means the 
conservation of both economic and ecological resources. 
  An annual appropriation of about 25 million German marks 
will 
be available for the implementation of the 
"Production-Integrated Environment Protection" funding program 
during the initial phase. A substantial increase in funding for 
this increasingly important area of environment protection 
research is expected in subsequent years.

<H5>  Numerous products emit ozone killer </H5>
  International agreements to eliminate the production and use 
of ozone-depleting materials suggest that the CFC problem is as 
good as solved. That appearance is deceiving. Neither recycling 
nor destruction is regulated for the approximately 2.1 million 
metric tons of CFCs and halons now in use throughout the world. 
The first disposal plant will start operation in Germany this 
summer. 
  The Federal Republic of Germany will have completed its 
retirement of CFCs as the first nation in the world during 1994. 
"CFCs should be retired on a Europe-wide basis by 1997." 
"Countries that signed the Montreal Protocol want to advance the 
timetable for this retirement." 
  This and similar pronouncements provide the impression that 
the international efforts to find a common solution to the CFC 
problem are bearing fruit. Chlorofluorocarbons and halons 
threaten the stratospheric ozone layer. The danger they pose 
appears to have been eliminated by the Montreal Protocol of 1987 
and the more stringent retirement scenarios and step-by-step 
plans enacted in subsequent years. 
  "This impression is wrong," contradicts Vivian Sheridan. She 
is the environmental spokesperson of the American chemical 
company DuPont. This company was formerly the world's largest 
producer of CFCs. Upon close inspection, the Montreal Protocol 
merely regulates the production volume of new CFCs in the 
signatory countries. On the other hand, it permits the import, 
export, and even after 1995, the use of recycled CFCs. 
Developing countries may manufacture CFCs "for their own use." 
Finally, the production and sale of new product is possible to 
the end of the year. 
  On the other hand, the Montreal Protocol does not regulate 
the whereabouts of the quantities already produced, stored, and 
in use. These quantities are considerable. Throughout the world, 
UN estimates point to about 2 million metric tons of fully 
halogenated CFCs and 115,000 metric tons of halons that are in 
use and on the market. For Germany, the UN cites 80,000 metric 
tons of CFCs used as propellant in rigid expanded polyurethanes, 
25,000 metric tons as refrigerant in cooling and refrigerating 
plants, and 9,000 tons of halons in fire extinguishing systems. 
In addition, some few 100 metric tons more are used in Germany 
annually as solvents. 
  Additional CFCs are released from these sources into the 
environment. Some of them are legal. Solvents enter the 
atmosphere within a few months of their application. The same 
applies to spray cans--where CFCs, for example, are still 
permitted in medical sprays. The insulating gases from 
insulating foams diffuse partially over the course of years into 
the environment. In recycling refrigerators, almost every second 
unit is disassembled manually at this time. Thomas Engmann is 
the manager of Electrorecycling at the disposal company of 
Rethmann, Selm. In his estimation, "About 30% of the CFCs 
enter 
the atmosphere uncontrolled." Substantial CFC sources are also 
German landfills. According to a study by the Technical 
University of Hamburg-Harburg, 200 metric tons of CFCs escape 
annually from spray cans, plastics and refrigerators in 
landfills. Up to 40,000 metric tons of the gases are still 
stored in West German dumps, according to estimates. 
  In practice, the retreat of CFCs is in no way as orderly or 
at the speed proclaimed by political pronouncements. "CFCs are 
the hazardous waste that can be disposed of most easily," 
explains Dr. Holger Brackemann from the Federal Office of the 
Environment in Berlin. In other words, opening a valve in an 
unobserved moment is enough to "dispose of" the materials. This 
illegal path is taken often, particularly for fire extinguishers 
and extinguishing systems, suspects Brackemann. According to the 
CFC Halon Ban, all fire extinguishers and extinguishing systems 
filled with halon were to have been taken out of operation by 31 
December 1993 and the material disposed by way of the 
Associations. Of the 6000 metric tons still estimated in 
existing systems in 1992, "only considerably less than 1000 
metric tons have been recovered" by today according to 
Brackemann. 
<H5>  The temperatures in a conventional trash incineration plant </H5>
are sufficient to crack the CFC propellant R 11. This was shown 
by experiments in the Tamara test plant of the Nuclear Research 
Center at Karlsruhe. 
  If you need CFCs, you can still get them. "The market for 
secondary product is large and unmanageable," assesses Dr. Peter 
Schubert. He is a CFC expert for DuPont. In his opinion, a 
considerable quantity of the ozone killer is still stored by 
vendors. The conversion of equipment to alternatives is 
proceeding at a slow pace. "For example, most users of cooling 
units or air conditioners choose to use recycled CFCs rather 
than convert to alternatives," says Schubert. The development of 
environmentally compatible alternatives and the manufacture of 
these products, costing millions, have not yet become profitable 
for the chemical industry. The demand is moderate. 
  Correspondingly hesitant is the retreat of old CFCs. 
Schubert 
estimates that, at this time, around 100 metric tons of 
refrigerant are purified on site and then refilled annually. An 
additional 300 metric tons are processed into secondary product. 
About 700 metric tons arrived at Hoechst AG in Frankfurt for 
processing in the last year. 
  Product that is too dirty for redistillation had to be 
stored 
until now because destruction capacity was not available. 
Probably starting this summer, Germany will have its first 
disposal system available. "The approval has just arrived," says 
the system developer Dr. Siegismut Hug. Three cracking reactors- 
-originally constructed for purifying exhaust gas from CFC 
production at Hoechst--are to eliminate 9000 metric tons of CFCs 
annually when completed. 
  In this process, the molecules are split in a graphite 
reactor at 2200 C to 2500 C in a hydrogen/oxygen 
flame. The reaction products--essentially hydrochloric acid, 
hydrofluoric acid, and carbon dioxide--can be separated from one 
another in a second step and reused as chemical raw material. 
"Our system will then be available to all Europe," says Hug. 
American and Japanese companies have shown interest in obtaining 
a license, according to Hug. 
  Besides this, several other methods are undergoing 
experimentation. Engineers at Maschinen- und Apparatebau Grimma 
tested plasma cracking a few years ago. Concentric Machines (CM) 
in Treutlingen has developed the Chemical Reverser that obtains 
reusable cracking products from CFCs and halons. The American 
company Process Technologies of Boise Idaho splits the molecules 
at less than 50 C using UV radiation. A method of the Tokyo 
Electric Power and KRI International Inc. of Kyoto is based on 
the same principle. A mixture of 80% CFCs and 20% 
oxygen is 
exposed to a mercury-vapor lamp. UV radiation cracks the CFCs 
into chlorine gas which is filtered out of the process flow by 
way of a membrane. 
  The Industrial Research Institute of Kanagawa Prefecture is 
rolling out particularly big guns. CFCs, fuel gas, and air are 
mixed and made to explode in a steel pipe 1 meter in length and 
35 mm in diameter. During this process, temperatures of almost 
3000 C are created. Such temperatures, in addition to 
strong pressure waves, split up to 99.99% of the 
molecules. 
  Regarding the possibilities for destroying CFCs and halons, 
the experts of a working group in the UN Environmental Program 
(UNEP), the "Technical Advisory Committee (TAC) on the 
destruction technologies for ozone-depleting substances," have 
been racking their brains since 1991. TAC has investigated 
several dozen possible methods and come to this conclusion. "The 
only methods available now are based on thermal oxidation." The 
American Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) had a similar 
summary. "Incineration is at this time the only large-scale 
usable technology for destroying CFCs." 
  Even conventional incineration plants are suitable for CFC 
destruction. Tests at the "Tamara" incineration plant of the 
Nuclear Research Center at Karlsruhe (KfK) show that the 
propellant R-11 from insulating foams is cracked. However, the 
CFC proportion at the input must always remain limited to a few 
per cent of the trash because aggressive hydrochloric and 
hydrofluoric acids are created during incineration. 
  The development of disposal methods got a late start. The 
experts agree on this. "In addition," says Brackemann, "More 
commitment on the part of the chemical industry would have been 
desirable." One thing is clear. Until adequate disposal 
capacities are available worldwide, most of the existing CFCs 
have, either intentionally or not, literally disappeared into 
thin air. The DuPont expert Schubert can see a positive side to 
this despite the problems. "Then, we can use the methods to 
dispose of the CFC alternatives."

  [Text][Text above title]Bacteria Convert 
Heavy Metal With Special Enzyme. 
  [Text below title]For Seep Waters and the Electrotechnical 
Industry -- by Joerg Brandes. 
  Many microorganisms feed off substances which are 
poisonous to humans. Scientists from the Society for 
Biotechnical Research (GBF) in Braunschweig have discovered that 
bacteria can be used to clean up water contaminated with 
mercury. 
  Mercury gets into the environment from burning trash, 
industrial waste waters and the sewage system, but also from 
volcanic eruptions. Since heavy metals are not biologically 
degradable, they can gradually build up in the food chain and 
become, finally, a danger to humans and animals. Today there a 
variety of technological processes available for "fishing out" 
poisonous heavy metals out of waste water. New in the selection 
are biological processes in which the heavy metal is taken up by 
the organisms into their biomass. 
  In looking for possible microbes the GBF scientists in 
Braunschweig soon struck it lucky. They correctly assumed that 
mercury-resistant microorganisms would have to be found near 
sources where a lot of the heavy metal accumulated. Among these, 
for instance, would be waste waters from the electrotechnical 
industry or from seed protectant or fungicide plants. 
  Basically, however, mercury is as harmful to bacteria as it 
is to other living organisms. Microbes which take up very much 
of it must therefore at least be able to transform it into a 
biologically "tolerable" form. With the help of a special 
enzyme, mercury reductase, the bacteria convert the mercury into 
a metallic form which is much less toxic. More than twenty 
naturally occurring bacterial strains have since become known 
which possess this enzyme. 
  Tests are carried out in so-called fixed-bed reactors in 
which microorganisms are colonized on a medium. The contaminated 
water is passed over the [bacteria] and loses the greater part 
of its toxic cargo in the process. The filtered-out metallic 
mercury is precipitated out in the form of small pellets in the 
reactor. After completion of the process the bacteria are 
removed and the remaining heavy metal is distilled off. The 
medium can then be reused. 
  Since the enzymatic transformation of the heavy metal occurs 
in a very directed way and is practically non-reversible, it is 
particularly well suited to the treatment of waste waters with a 
mercury concentration of less than 5 mg per liter. Prof. 
Wolf-Dieter Deckwer, head of bioengineering at GBF, considers 
seep water from trash dumps, for example, to be suitable, as 
well as seed treatment operations where mercury compounds are 
heavily used. 
  To widen their scope of application, microbiologists are 
giving their bacteria a little boost genetically. They have 
succeeded in joining in one strain of Pseudomonas putida two 
characteristics which do not occur together in nature: the 
microbes can split particularly toxic organic mercury compounds 
as well as convert the resultant--and still toxic--cations of 
the element.

<F P=106> [Article by Birgitt Riese: "Electronic Scrap Travels </F>
Many Routes To Disassembly"; Subhead: "Waste Managers Have 
Market Divvied Up"] 
  [Text] Duesseldorf, 25 February 1994 -- Recycling of 
electric and electronic scrap material is off and running. 
Numerous firms have discovered for themselves the lucrative 
waste disposal market -- even absent an electronic-scrap 
ordinance. The loops, however, are far from closed for all 
materials. 
  On 1 January 1994, the "ordinance on the avoidance, 
reduction 
and recycling of waste materials from used electric and 
electronic equipment" was supposed to take effect. The result 
has been zilch since the federal environmental ministry and 
industry associations were unable to reach agreement, 
particularly on the issue of financing. 
  According to estimates by BC Berlin Consult GmbH, a 1.8 
million ton amount of electronic scrap per year is expected 
beginning with 1994, and as of 1998 it will even reach 2.4 
million tons. According to the Central Association of Electrical 
Engineering and Electrical Industry [ZVEI] in Frankfurt, capital 
goods account for 40 percent of that and consumer goods for 60 
percent of it. Major home appliances constitute 62 percent, 
entertainment electronics, 28 percent and small appliances, 
eight percent. 
  Even without an ordinance, industry, business and waste 
managers have started to chip away at this mountain of used 
equipment. Hence, cross-branch cooperation is of major 
importance. Schleswag Recycling GmbH in Rendsburg, for instance, 
has combined with other firms into an umbrella organization, 
Inter Elektro Recycling GmbH [IER]. IER intends to develop a 
network of intake centers and recycling facilities that will 
blanket the FRG. The recycling will be done in various firms. 
So-called S-facilities will disassemble the equipment and remove 
harmful materials. "T facilities" will carry out the dismantling 
and separation of materials, while "MR facilities" will recover 
metals. Schleswag's first recycling plant based on this model is 
already in operation in Brunsbuettel. In the words of Schleswag 
spokesman Stefan Gliwitzki: "The plant recycles everything from 
electric razors to computers with a recycling rate of 95 percent 
and is processing 25,000 t annually." That represents nearly 
half of the electronic scrap occurring in Schleswig-Holstein. 
  Even major corporations see a market in the recycling of 
electronic scrap. In mid-January, Telekom, Alcatel SEL, Preussag 
and Siemens jointly established the Electrorecycling-Anlagen 
GmbH, headquartered in Goslar. In early 1995, however, only 
telecommunications scrap materials will be recycled in the 
recycling plant that will enter into operation in Goslar. Since 
1992 a major experiment has been underway already in a pilot 
facility in Goslar. One of its special successes is that the 
recycling of the plastics portion constitutes a rather small 
problem since acrylonitrile-butadiene-styrene [ABS] is 
prescribed as the plastic for Telekom's telephones. "We 
therefore have to deal with only a single plastic," emphasizes 
Georg Froehlich, head of process engineering at Preussag 
subsidiary Noell in Goslar. 
  In the new laender, a subsidiary of RWE waste management, R 
+ 
T Umwelt GmbH, Leipzig, is engaged in this activity. Three 
disassembly facilities have already been set up. A processing 
plant is planned for late 1994. According to R + T data, the 
disassembly facility in Doeberitz, Brandenburg, annually 
recycles 2,000 t of scrap material with an average recycling 
rate of 75 percent. 
  Even the competition in Westphalian Selm is not sleeping. On 
10 March, Rethmann Kreislaufwirtschaft GmbH &amp; Co. Kg will 
open 
up an electrical parts disposal center. Then more than 100,000 
refrigerators, 150,000 TVs, 200,000 cathode ray tubes and nearly 
150,000 t of other electrical and electronic equipment are 
supposed to be processed there annually. 
  Dieter Tartler from Erlangen university dampens 
expectations: 
"So far there is only a small amount of actual recycling of 
electronic scrap." In fact, in only the rarest of instances is 
disassembled material reincorporated into the manufacture of 
electric and electronic equipment. 
  Only the loop for metals is mostly closed: most of them end 
up being smelted. Cycling of glasses is considerably more 
difficult since very different kinds of glasses are included. 
Stefan Maier, head of the recycling sector at Stuttgart's 
Zueblin AG emphasizes: "It is only possible to reuse glasses for 
the manufacture of display screens if the equipment was 
separated by manufacturer when it was collected." Zueblin 
environmental engineering together with Nokia Display Technics 
has developed a method for processing cathode ray tubes. In that 
process, according to Maier, only one percent of the cumulative 
amount needs to be disposed of as special waste material any 
longer. The tubes are crushed, the glass is scrubbed and the 
remaining amount of solids is pressed into a filter cake. At 
present, the glass that is removed mostly ends up in the 
construction or ceramics industry or in he production of 
radioactive waste shields. 
  Even the plastics portion complicates recycling because of 
their diversity. Floor coverings and transportation palettes are 
now resulting from the polymers. Where this approach to 
recycling cannot be used, for example, in the case of plastic 
casings that contain fire retardants, experts consider chemical 
recycling the best solution. In this process the plastic is 
dissolved into its chemical building blocks. 
  Printed circuit boards, constituting a blend of many 
materials, are even more of a problem. In Luebben, Brandenburg, 
BC Berlin Consult is operating an experimental plant based on 
the Pyrocom process, a combination of thermolysis and 
incineration. As BC spokeswoman Kerstin Gustmann puts it 
briefly: "In addition to oil, metals, minerals and solid 
residues, a gas is recovered as a result and is used for heating 
the reactor." 
  Printed circuit boards, above all, are also worrisome for 
recycling expert Tartler. He tosses out for consideration: "No 
one can say precisely what materials are contained therein." 
Erlangen university's research project "recovery of materials 
from blends of multiple materials," should cast some light in 
the darkness. The people in Erlangen are betting on a process 
that combines chemical extraction for separation of metals with 
a leaching out of the plastics. 
  Lots of people want to profit from the recycling of electric 
and electronic scrap material. In Frankfurt, 21 firms have 
combined in the Federal Organization for Electric and Electronic 
Recycling Companies [BEVU] to establish uniform recycling 
standards. In Engen, members of the Federal Association for 
Electronic and Electric Scrap Material Recycling [BEEV] are 
pursuing a similar aim. In order to avoid unnecessary 
competition, both groups are planning to combine under a single 
umbrella organization. "Then the number of waste managers active 
in the market will be discernible," says Rainer Koesling of 
Reichart Metals in Pulheim. 
  Germany is still taking on a trailblazer role in the 
recycling of electronic scrap, although there are also initial 
hints of an EC-wide regulation. According to a report from the 
federal environmental ministry, a "priority-waste-stream working 
group" convened for the first time in January and is supposed to 
draw up recommendations for an EC guideline by mid-1995.

<F P=106> [Article by Dieter Mueller: "Cautious Change of </F>
Course on Recycling of Plastic Waste Materials"; Subhead: "BASF 
Bets on Raw-Material Recycling of Packaging Polymers"] 
  [Text]Ludwigshafen, 25 February 1994 -- Stricter 
anti-pollution regulations in the future may make the 
incineration of plastic waste as expensive as raw-material 
recycling. In this context, the Ludwigshafen BASF AG plans to 
expand its new pilot plant for the raw-material processing of 
used plastic packaging materials into a large-scale complex by 
1997 at the latest. 
  A change of course is in the offing at BASF for the 
incineration of plastic waste. Dr. Albert Hauss, head of the 
plastics and environmental department explained recently, for 
example, at the inauguration of a new technological processing 
facility in Ludwigshafen: "Aside from the fact that society 
views incineration as 'annihilation of matter' and therefore 
disapproves of it, that form of disposal, even in terms of cost 
now, no longer has any supporting argument." 
  The basis for this assessment is a cost accounting in the 
context of the seventeenth ordinance of the federal 
anti-pollution law for waste incinerators. In Hauss' words, its 
strict requirements in emission limiting values by now "call for 
a tripling of capital commitment" for plant investments compared 
with plants for raw-material recycling. On his estimate, 
incineration of plastic waste costs DM1200 per ton, including 
additional costs, sorting and transportation, plus the disposal 
of the inert residue. "In net terms, therefore, the burning of 
the packagings remaining in a ton of waste residue is just about 
as costly as raw-material recycling through separate sorting and 
recycling." 
  Recycling burdens, therefore, are no longer an obstacle to a 
cautious change of attitude toward the production of plastic 
that is already, in fact, beginning to emerge. Hauss mentioned 
the inauguration of a pilot plant for raw-material, that is, 
petrochemical, recycling of waste plastic packaging at the 
Ludwigshafen location. In that process, plastics (polymers) are 
again reconverted into their source products (monomers) in such 
a way that part of them can then again be incorporated in the 
fresh production of plastics or other petrochemical processes. 
By 1997 at the latest, BASF plans to expand the pilot plant into 
a large-scale recycling facility with an annual capacity of 
300,000 t. Hourly throughput at that time is likely to be nearly 
40 t, meaning that even the appropriate general conditions, 
logistics, for instance, will have to be in place. 
  It was also evident in Ludwigshafen that the undertaking now 
not only postulates the trio of material, raw material and 
thermal recycling, but also steadily supports and strategically 
tackles it. It is in these terms, therefore, that the operation 
of the new 600 m[.sup]2[/] large technological processing 
facility has to be viewed. On the basis of specific pilot 
projects, the material processing of old plastics is supposed to 
be analyzed at it. 
  In the words of degreed engineer Volker Hammes, the head of 
the new technological facility, one of the principal tasks of 
the technological facility will consist of "providing the 
cleanest possible, pure or at least free of foreign substances 
and extrudable bulk material." Furthermore, the plant, that has 
a maximum capacity of 500 kg/h, is supposed to be used to search 
for new areas of application for "old plastics from a defined 
source." 
  Although it is only in the offing, the introduction of the 
new technological facility did make it plain that BASF intends 
to safeguard and expand its applied technological know-how in 
the field of plastics recycling with this investment totaling 
nearly DM3 million (excluding physical plant). Ultimately, the 
goal is recycled materials having a defined and guaranteed 
properties profile for which a "certificate of quality" can be 
issued to the processors. In the future that will be important 
in terms of producer liability and should not be underestimated. 
BASF's recycling expert anticipates that, using materials 
recycling methods, in the future approximately 15-20 percent of 
the total amount of old plastic "can be converted into 
worthwhile new applications from an economical and ecological 
point of view."

"Positive Signal for Raw-Material Recycling"; Subheads: 
"Packaging Ordinance Amendment Should Continue To Expedite Waste 
Recycling"; "Planned Extension of Quota-Based Goals Allows Time 
for Creation of Industrial-Scale Recycling Capacity"] 
  [Text]Duesseldorf, 18 February 1994 -- Federal 
environmental minister Prof. Klaus Toepfer intends to use a 
revised packaging ordinance to continue development of Germany's 
entry into recycling. In this context, at the Euroforum 
conference "The Dual System Facing Its Demise?!," recently in 
Duesseldorf, Dr. Thomas Rummler explained that the federal 
government wished to incorporate the experiences of the past two 
years into the ordinance's amendment. For, although in the view 
of the deputy department head in the Federal Environmental 
Ministry [BMU], there had been some problems in the initial 
phase, the present results demonstrated that something "had 
gotten off the ground" both in the avoidance and in the 
recycling of packaging. 
  Marion Caspers-Merk, however, complains about the proposed 
bill for a new packaging ordinance: "What federal environmental 
minister Toepfer has proposed no longer has anything to do with 
ecological recycling." In the view of the deputy 
environmental-policy spokesperson for the German Socialist 
Party's [SPD] parliamentary group, the central thrust of the 
proposed changes is "to extend the deadlines, lower recycling 
quotas and allow access to the furnace in recycling." Therefore, 
it is not ecological necessity but economic wishfulness that is 
uppermost. The medium-sized business sector came to the 
conclusion from the disastrous development of Germany's Dual 
System [DSD] of fashioning an ecologically and economically 
optimized counter-bill. But instead of allowing the market even 
into the waste management sector and promoting the ordinance, 
the DSD continued to be defended. 
  According to deputy ministerial head Thomas Rummler, the 
planned amendment to the new packaging ordinance will allow new 
chemical (raw material) recycling processes to be used for 
plastic packaging. The industry wants to have an annual 
recycling capacity of 190,000 t by 1995. Therefore the creation 
of investment security for raw-material recycling processes lies 
at the core of the respective bill. 
  According to Rummler this should be achieved with the 
unambiguous conceptual definition. It was made clear that the 
raw-material recycling law could be realized not only using 
conventional recycling processes but also modern chemical 
recycling processes. The BMU representative opined: "This 
conceptual clarification will supply the indispensable 
investment security for firms that want to use the material 
properties of used plastics, for instance, in the process of 
hydrogenation or the production of steel." 
  Petra Rob's judgment of Bonn's change of plans was: "We 
welcome the fact that the amending of the packaging ordinance 
redefines and unambiguously defines important concepts." Since, 
according to the spokesperson for the DSD GmbH, Bonn, 
raw-material recycling of plastic packaging, for example, 
through hydrogenation or pyrolysis would be explicitly 
recognized, industry would be given an important signal "to make 
the necessary billions in investments in modern recycling plants 
and technologies." 
  The amendment bill also provides for packaging consisting of 
paper/pulp/cardboard, plastic or composite materials, a 
reduction of the recycling quotas as well as a deferral of the 
deadlines by which the quotas have to be met. As a result, the 
currently targeted recycling quota of 60 percent (64 percent up 
until now) for such retrievable packaging materials will have to 
be realized only by 1 January 1998 (up until now, 1 July 1995). 
  According to Rummler this is needed to allow for the 
development of appropriate recycling capacities. Slight 
deviations in the quotas, nonetheless, have not led to any 
substantial changes. As Rummler states: "The pressure on the 
private sector to build large facilities for raw-material 
recycling is in no way diminished." This is highlighted not 
least by the fact that, in the case of plastics, half the 
recycling quota has to be ensured using material processes. But 
the amendment also makes it clear that effectively included 
amounts of packaging exceeding the required materials quotas 
could be recycled either in the form of matter or energy. 
However, this would require furnaces having at least a 75 
percent efficiency factor.

<F P=106> [Article by Almut Jandel: "When Experts Fertilize the Soil, </F>
the Drinking Water Remains Pure"] 
  [Text] 
<H5>  For the Fourth Time, the VDI Regional Association of </H5>
Osnabruck Organizes the Technical Conference "Environmentally 
Friendly Agriculture" 
<H5>  Ground-water protection requires new thinking in agriculture </H5>
  Obtaining drinking water in rural areas is impaired to a 
considerable degree by agriculture. Can pesticide and fertilizer 
consulting, a water tax, or ecological cultivation methods 
provide lasting protection for ground water? This question was 
examined by the Regional Association of Osnabruck. 
  The requirements of healthy conditions for life include 
clean 
air, unpolluted soil and pure water. In most regions, however, 
the environment has been disturbed by the far-reaching actions 
of mankind. A matter of concern for the working group on process 
technology of the VDI Regional Association of Osnabruck is to 
discuss environmental problems in their own region and to list 
solution approaches. The conference series of "Environmentally 
Friendly Agriculture" was initiated from these considerations. 
The VDI Regional Association, with the Center for the 
Environment and Technology, and the Osnabruck City Department of 
Works organized this series for the fourth time. The topic of 
protecting the ground water was the central theme of the last 
conference. 
  Obtaining water in rural areas, e.g., even in the area of 
Osnabruck, is impaired to a great degree by agriculture. To 
increase yield, large quantities of nitrate and pesticides are 
applied to the fields. After a time delay, some of these 
materials appear in the ground water and must be removed by the 
water treatment plants at great expense to be able to supply 
drinking water with the prescribed quality. 
  What can be done to reduce the introduction of nitrates and 
pesticides into the ground water? Horst Wieligmann, from the 
Osnabruck City Department of Works, presented an initiative. The 
Osnabruck City Department of Works has now purchased fields, 
stopped the intensive agriculture there and leased the land with 
a great amount of support for ecological cultivation. 
"Unfortunately, the market situation for grain, fruit and 
vegetables cultivated ecologically is so poor that no farmer can 
be advised to do this," complains Horst Wieligmann about the 
current situation. Ecological agriculture makes do without 
pesticides. However, the harvest is poorer than in conventional 
agriculture, and soil cultivation must be more intensive and 
incurs greater expense. For the use of fertilizer, balance 
sheets are drawn up. In these sheets, the quantity of fertilizer 
used, e.g., liquid manure, is correlated with the consumption of 
the individual types of grain or plants. 
  "On a biofarm, nitrogen is always scarce and costs the 
farmer 
5 to 10 Deutsche marks per kg," calculates the farmer Dipl.-Ing. 
agr. Rudolf Joost-Meyer zu Bakum. He was of the opinion that a 
reduction of nitrate could be achieved in conventional 
agriculture if, first, the use of fertilizer was optimized and, 
second, mineral nitrogen would become more expensive by 300 to 
700%. "Use of nitrogen must be controlled on a market 
economy 
basis." Important prerequisites for converting conventional 
farms are motivation of the farm management, capital for 
additional technology, market desire, and comprehensive 
specialized advice. 
  In Baden-Wurttemberg, a regulation applying uniformly over 
the entire Land was enacted for the utilization of agricultural 
fields to protect the ground water. In this way, a legal 
instrument was created that made it possible to enact 
regulations based on scientific knowledge as minimum 
requirements for agriculture and to facilitate the conversion 
without incurring financial penalties and by means of intensive 
consultation. Problems that occur can be solved in research 
projects, model tests and pilot projects. A series of 
requirements and bans is contained in the regulation. For 
example, these include a plowing ban for permanent meadowland, 
restrictions on fertilization and irrigation, and even the 
restriction of soil cultivation. Only pesticides specified in a 
positive list may be used. 
<H5>  Conversion of cultivation methods without financial penalties </H5>
  Jochen Mund is the construction director in Ministry for the 
Environment of Baden-Wurttemberg. He placed special emphasis on 
the fact that converting the cultivation methods must occur 
without economic disadvantages. The regulation ensures a 
financial compensation of 310.00 Deutsche marks per hectare or a 
lump sum. The water intake fee (0.10 Deutsche 
marks/m[.sup]3[/]), that the Land demands of the water-supply 
and distribution system, is used for the compensation payments. 
  Mund says that initial experience with the regulation shows 
that reducing nitrogen fertilization alone is not sufficient. 
Additional measures, e.g., reduced soil cultivation, sodding, no 
fallow land, restrictions in problem areas and culture, are 
required. Reactions in the ground water, even with this, are not 
to be expected in the short term. The interplay of many measures 
and the elimination of many traditional methods will, in the 
opinion of Jochen Mund, help the regulation achieve the 
necessary success. "If experts fertilize the corn, the drinking 
water will remain pure." His motto clearly shows that a great 
need of optimization exists. Sufficient consultation, controlled 
tests, optimization of the cultivation method and soil tests 
before fertilizer is used can lead to a minimization of the 
nitrate pollution in the ground water over the long term. 
  In the area of Osnabruck, a cooperative project between 
agriculture and the water-supply and distribution system, 
supported by the Land of Lower Saxony, was started in 1991. The 
goal of this project was to make provisions for ground water 
protection by advising farmers. This project is being run by the 
Weser-Ems Chamber of Agriculture and it is being supported 
financially by the Osnabruck City Department of Works. Ulrich 
Wordemann is the agricultural director for the Weser-Ems Chamber 
of Agriculture. He presented the project. As the starting point, 
utilization and cultivation conditions were determined on a 
voluntary basis to make possible optimization of fertilizer use. 
At the same time, demonstration fields with fertilization 
appropriate for the need were cultivated so as to show the 
results of this cultivation to the farmers. Until now, only a 
few farmers who are regularly keeping field impact card files 
are participating in this project. These card files are 
evaluated on a scale greater than a single farm to be able to 
follow the nutrient cycle. The quick determination of the 
ammonia concentration in liquid manure that shows the farmer how 
much fertilizer he has applied has proven to be an important 
instrument in this project. The object of all these measures is 
to make the farmer an expert who views ground water protection 
as a matter of concern to him personally.

<H5>  Numerous products emit ozone killer </H5>
  International agreements to eliminate the production and use 
of ozone-depleting materials suggest that the CFC problem is as 
good as solved. That appearance is deceiving. Neither recycling 
nor destruction is regulated for the approximately 2.1 million 
metric tons of CFCs and halons now in use throughout the world. 
The first disposal plant will start operation in Germany this 
summer. 
  The Federal Republic of Germany will have completed its 
retirement of CFCs as the first nation in the world during 1994. 
"CFCs should be retired on a Europe-wide basis by 1997." 
"Countries that signed the Montreal Protocol want to advance the 
timetable for this retirement." 
  This and similar pronouncements provide the impression that 
the international efforts to find a common solution to the CFC 
problem are bearing fruit. Chlorofluorocarbons and halons 
threaten the stratospheric ozone layer. The danger they pose 
appears to have been eliminated by the Montreal Protocol of 1987 
and the more stringent retirement scenarios and step-by-step 
plans enacted in subsequent years. 
  "This impression is wrong," contradicts Vivian Sheridan. She 
is the environmental spokesperson of the American chemical 
company DuPont. This company was formerly the world's largest 
producer of CFCs. Upon close inspection, the Montreal Protocol 
merely regulates the production volume of new CFCs in the 
signatory countries. On the other hand, it permits the import, 
export, and even after 1995, the use of recycled CFCs. 
Developing countries may manufacture CFCs "for their own use." 
Finally, the production and sale of new product is possible to 
the end of the year. 
  On the other hand, the Montreal Protocol does not regulate 
the whereabouts of the quantities already produced, stored, and 
in use. These quantities are considerable. Throughout the world, 
UN estimates point to about 2 million metric tons of fully 
halogenated CFCs and 115,000 metric tons of halons that are in 
use and on the market. For Germany, the UN cites 80,000 metric 
tons of CFCs used as propellant in rigid expanded polyurethanes, 
25,000 metric tons as refrigerant in cooling and refrigerating 
plants, and 9,000 tons of halons in fire extinguishing systems. 
In addition, some few 100 metric tons more are used in Germany 
annually as solvents. 
  Additional CFCs are released from these sources into the 
environment. Some of them are legal. Solvents enter the 
atmosphere within a few months of their application. The same 
applies to spray cans--where CFCs, for example, are still 
permitted in medical sprays. The insulating gases from 
insulating foams diffuse partially over the course of years into 
the environment. In recycling refrigerators, almost every second 
unit is disassembled manually at this time. Thomas Engmann is 
the manager of Electrorecycling at the disposal company of 
Rethmann, Selm. In his estimation, "About 30% of the CFCs 
enter 
the atmosphere uncontrolled." Substantial CFC sources are also 
German landfills. According to a study by the Technical 
University of Hamburg-Harburg, 200 metric tons of CFCs escape 
annually from spray cans, plastics and refrigerators in 
landfills. Up to 40,000 metric tons of the gases are still 
stored in West German dumps, according to estimates. 
  In practice, the retreat of CFCs is in no way as orderly or 
at the speed proclaimed by political pronouncements. "CFCs are 
the hazardous waste that can be disposed of most easily," 
explains Dr. Holger Brackemann from the Federal Office of the 
Environment in Berlin. In other words, opening a valve in an 
unobserved moment is enough to "dispose of" the materials. This 
illegal path is taken often, particularly for fire extinguishers 
and extinguishing systems, suspects Brackemann. According to the 
CFC Halon Ban, all fire extinguishers and extinguishing systems 
filled with halon were to have been taken out of operation by 31 
December 1993 and the material disposed by way of the 
Associations. Of the 6000 metric tons still estimated in 
existing systems in 1992, "only considerably less than 1000 
metric tons have been recovered" by today according to 
Brackemann. 
<H5>  The temperatures in a conventional trash incineration plant </H5>
are sufficient to crack the CFC propellant R 11. This was shown 
by experiments in the Tamara test plant of the Nuclear Research 
Center at Karlsruhe. 
  If you need CFCs, you can still get them. "The market for 
secondary product is large and unmanageable," assesses Dr. Peter 
Schubert. He is a CFC expert for DuPont. In his opinion, a 
considerable quantity of the ozone killer is still stored by 
vendors. The conversion of equipment to alternatives is 
proceeding at a slow pace. "For example, most users of cooling 
units or air conditioners choose to use recycled CFCs rather 
than convert to alternatives," says Schubert. The development of 
environmentally compatible alternatives and the manufacture of 
these products, costing millions, have not yet become profitable 
for the chemical industry. The demand is moderate. 
  Correspondingly hesitant is the retreat of old CFCs. 
Schubert 
estimates that, at this time, around 100 metric tons of 
refrigerant are purified on site and then refilled annually. An 
additional 300 metric tons are processed into secondary product. 
About 700 metric tons arrived at Hoechst AG in Frankfurt for 
processing in the last year. 
  Product that is too dirty for redistillation had to be 
stored 
until now because destruction capacity was not available. 
Probably starting this summer, Germany will have its first 
disposal system available. "The approval has just arrived," says 
the system developer Dr. Siegismut Hug. Three cracking reactors- 
-originally constructed for purifying exhaust gas from CFC 
production at Hoechst--are to eliminate 9000 metric tons of CFCs 
annually when completed. 
  In this process, the molecules are split in a graphite 
reactor at 2200 C to 2500 C in a hydrogen/oxygen 
flame. The reaction products--essentially hydrochloric acid, 
hydrofluoric acid, and carbon dioxide--can be separated from one 
another in a second step and reused as chemical raw material. 
"Our system will then be available to all Europe," says Hug. 
American and Japanese companies have shown interest in obtaining 
a license, according to Hug. 
  Besides this, several other methods are undergoing 
experimentation. Engineers at Maschinen- und Apparatebau Grimma 
tested plasma cracking a few years ago. Concentric Machines (CM) 
in Treutlingen has developed the Chemical Reverser that obtains 
reusable cracking products from CFCs and halons. The American 
company Process Technologies of Boise Idaho splits the molecules 
at less than 50 C using UV radiation. A method of the Tokyo 
Electric Power and KRI International Inc. of Kyoto is based on 
the same principle. A mixture of 80% CFCs and 20% 
oxygen is 
exposed to a mercury-vapor lamp. UV radiation cracks the CFCs 
into chlorine gas which is filtered out of the process flow by 
way of a membrane. 
  The Industrial Research Institute of Kanagawa Prefecture is 
rolling out particularly big guns. CFCs, fuel gas, and air are 
mixed and made to explode in a steel pipe 1 meter in length and 
35 mm in diameter. During this process, temperatures of almost 
3000 C are created. Such temperatures, in addition to 
strong pressure waves, split up to 99.99% of the 
molecules. 
  Regarding the possibilities for destroying CFCs and halons, 
the experts of a working group in the UN Environmental Program 
(UNEP), the "Technical Advisory Committee (TAC) on the 
destruction technologies for ozone-depleting substances," have 
been racking their brains since 1991. TAC has investigated 
several dozen possible methods and come to this conclusion. "The 
only methods available now are based on thermal oxidation." The 
American Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) had a similar 
summary. "Incineration is at this time the only large-scale 
usable technology for destroying CFCs." 
  Even conventional incineration plants are suitable for CFC 
destruction. Tests at the "Tamara" incineration plant of the 
Nuclear Research Center at Karlsruhe (KfK) show that the 
propellant R-11 from insulating foams is cracked. However, the 
CFC proportion at the input must always remain limited to a few 
per cent of the trash because aggressive hydrochloric and 
hydrofluoric acids are created during incineration. 
  The development of disposal methods got a late start. The 
experts agree on this. "In addition," says Brackemann, "More 
commitment on the part of the chemical industry would have been 
desirable." One thing is clear. Until adequate disposal 
capacities are available worldwide, most of the existing CFCs 
have, either intentionally or not, literally disappeared into 
thin air. The DuPont expert Schubert can see a positive side to 
this despite the problems. "Then, we can use the methods to 
dispose of the CFC alternatives."

  [Text] The environmental scandal surrounding the storage 
of [former] German Democratic Republic-produced toxic pesticide 
waste in northern Albania is evidently greater than previously 
assumed. Environmental protection organizations yesterday warned 
that entire regions could become contaminated, severely 
threatening thousands of people. Greenpeace spoke of 
pesticide-poisoned "chemical lakes." 
  The Federal Environment Ministry also conceded yesterday 
that 
the drums were "improperly" stored. According to Environment 
Minister Toepfer (CDU [Christian Democratic Union]) there is a 
total of 4,000 tons of pesticides in Albania, some of it highly 
toxic, that had been delivered by the World Bank, the European 
Union, and Germany. One liter of this substance is enough to 
contaminate two million liters of drinking water. 
  The toxic waste also includes 217 tons of GDR pesticides, 
which according to the Environment Ministry in Bonn were 
exported by Lower Saxony playing card firm Schmidt-Cretan in 
1991 and 1992. 
  Greenpeace claims that at the time the cargo, totaling 790 
tons, was declared as "humanitarian aid" to agriculture. The 
environmental protection group tracked the toxic pesticides down 
two years ago in wagons of the eastern German railways. 
Government agencies in Bonn had known about the drums for years 
but so far failed to do anything. 
  According to Toepfer (CDU), the German authorities had so 
far 
looked in vain for a World Bank and EU [European Union] disposal 
program. Toepfer now announced Germany would go for it alone. 
The possibility of "bringing them back" was currently being 
examined. He had already sent a team of experts from the 
Technical Support Service to Albania at the end of December. 
  Toepfer is considering bringing the drums back to Germany by 
ship. He is afraid Albania is not an isolated case. Hungary 
and the Ukraine are also affected. 
  Meanwhile, Greenpeace yesterday began making the pesticide 
containers safe. About 20 drums were packed and taken to the 
Yugoslav border by truck. It describes the situation in some 
places in northern Albania as catastrophic. "Drums are leaking, 
a chemical cocktail is seeping into the ground, gasses are 
escaping," Greenpeace says. People were complaining of burning 
eyes and breathing difficulties. Drinking water wells were 
threatened.

<F P=106> [Article by Frank Elsner: "How Much Ecological Recovery Can </F>
There Be in Wismut? -- Environment Experts Say GDR Uranium 
Mining's Legacy of Contamination Will Cost Much More Than 15 
Billion German Marks"] 
  [Text] In the GDR it was a country within a state with its 
own police and jurisdiction, closely watched by the Soviet 
secret service: the mining area of the "Soviet-German Wismut 
Corporation." Over a period of 40 years the USSR [Union of 
Soviet Socialist Republics] took some 220,000 tons of uranium -- 
the raw material for its military and civilian nuclear programs 
-- from the ore deposits of southern Saxony and Thuringia. Its 
legacy is Germany's biggest ecological disaster. Environment 
experts fear that decontaminating it properly will cost far more 
than the 13 to 15 billion Deutsche marks [DM] officially 
estimated. 
  Those who gained from the wasteful exploitation of nature 
and 
human beings will not pay the price of it. Bonn inherited the 
GDR's half of Wismut anyway, and in May 1991 the USSR handed its 
half over as well--and with it all responsibility for more than 
3,000 radioactive waste heaps, 300 shafts and mines and a large 
number of sludge lagoons containing uranium and radioactive 
decay products. 
  The bomb must be defused by the successor company Wismut 
GmbH. The resources--about DM700 to 800 million a year--will be 
provided by its sole shareholder, the Federal Ministry of Trade 
and Industry. Chief executive, Manfred Bergmann, estimates that 
the ecological repair work will take 10 to 15 years. Then it 
will be possible to "build kindergartens again" on the 
contaminated areas. Trade and Industry Minister Rexrodt 
explains that the "Wismut project" meets "international 
standards." 
  Environment experts think otherwise. Munich radiation 
biologist Edmund Lengfelder says that the GDR's lax radiological 
protection rules have been perpetuated in the Reunification 
Treaty for what was once the world's third largest uranium 
mining area, in particular. According to Gerhard Schmidt of the 
Darmstadt-based Ecological Institute, the lack of statutory 
rehabilitation targets such as are standard in the USA is 
painfully obvious. "Wismut has no measuring stick for its work." 
  Whether Wismut has the technology to keep the environmental 
hazards permanently under control is also a matter of 
controversy. Lengfelder disputes in particular that the 
radioactive sludge lagoons are securely sealed -- a great hazard 
for the groundwater. "Perfect reclamation" could easily breach 
the DM100 billion cost limit, the radiation biologist believes: 
"Bonn must know what quality it wants. It is a political 
matter." 
  Worse than that: After thoroughly plundering the uranium 
stocks, in 1962 Wismut gave all the worthless mining areas back 
to the respective local authorities. These are now getting not 
a penny from the pot in Bonn.

<F P=106> [Article by Jonathan Margolis: "Polluting Cars Escape in </F>
Cloud of Confusion"] 
  [Text] With evidence growing that motor exhaust fumes are 
behind Britain's asthma epidemic, it has emerged that not a 
single car, bus or lorry owner has been prosecuted for having a 
dirty exhaust since it became an offence eight years ago. 
  Under the Construction and Use Regulations a polluting car 
owner can be fined up to &pound;1,000 and the owner of a bus or 
lorry up to &pound;2,500. 
  Yet only one car driver is believed to have been stopped by 
police for suspected pollution -- an Edinburgh man questioned 
last year because of his black exhaust. He was charged, however, 
only with having bald tyres and no insurance. 
  Although most people breathing in exhaust fumes feel that 
polluters must be breaking the law, there is widespread 
ignorance among experts about even the existence of legislation. 
  An Environment Department press spokeswoman emphatically 
denied that it is possible to be fined for polluting. Even 
Friends of the Earth believes drivers of the fume-belching cars 
are untouchable. 
  Mr Doug Parr, the environment group's atmosphere and 
transport campaigner, said he was "pretty sure" a polluting 
motorist could not be prosecuted. 
  The recession has led to an estimated one in 10 drivers 
skimping on car servicing, with buses increasingly spewing black 
smoke. The link with asthma was highlighted in last week's BBC1 
Panorama programme and a report from the 
Parliamentary Office of Science and Technology. 
  Panorama said that the number of pre-school 
children with asthma had risen tenfold in 30 years, and that the 
Government was considering banning cars not fitted with a 
catalytic converter during smog alerts such as the climatic 
inversion over London in December 1991, when hospitals were 
swamped by children suffering from asthma. 
  A prime reason for lack of prosecution of polluting drivers 
is bureaucratic gridlock between interested government 
departments. Only the police and the Vehicle Inspectorate can 
stop and check polluting cars. Police traffic patrols do not 
carry testing equipment, however, and the inspectorate has a 
policy of not prosecuting. 
  Local authorities, led by Westminster City Council, are 
lobbying for powers to stop and fine polluting motorists. 
  Sporadic roadside emission checks on buses, coaches and 
lorries -- but not cars -- by the inspectorate have led to 
around 600 lorry operators a year being warned and 500 bus 
companies. Owners are given 10 days to adjust their engines. 
  Vehicle emission checks introduced to the MoT test in 1991 
are not working, say some experts. A British chemist, Prof Don 
Stedman, of Denver University, Colorado, who has studied road 
pollution in Britain, says drivers with dirty exhausts have 
learned how to cheat on the test. 
  Prof Stedman has tested exhausts in 12 countries and says 
British cities are worse than congested places such as Seoul and 
Hong Kong. 
  "We know from testing 100,000 cars in London, Leicester and 
Edinburgh that half of the pollution comes from eight per cent 
of cars." 
  He believes one badly adjusted petrol car can emit 40 times 
as many pollutants as one clean engine. 
  Prof Stedman says only fines can persuade polluters to 
adjust 
their engines. In Los Angeles, a taxi firm with 75 polluting 
cabs was fined $250,000 last April. Many other U.S. cities now 
prosecute for polluting.

<F P=106> [By Paul Ejime] </F>
  [Text] Lagos, 22 Mar (PANA) -- The eighth Lake Chad Basin 
Commission summit, opening Tuesday [22 March] in the Nigerian 
capital, would, in principle, have concentrated on the worrying 
shrinkage of water on what used to be the Lake Chad surface 
area. The reduced water surface, mineral resources, and 
environmental concerns are issues which affect all the 
organisation's four-member states -- Cameroon, Chad, Niger and 
Nigeria. 
  It is likely, however, that these pressing problems might be 
overshadowed by the current border dispute involving Nigeria and 
Cameroon over the ownership of the 1000 square kilometre Bakassi 
Peninsula. The summit in Abuja, will take place against the 
background of intense diplomatic. [sentence as received] 
  Diplomatic sources in the federal capital and Lagos said 
that 
apart from the commission's agenda, the summit could be a 
prelude to the elusive summit between Abacha and Biya over 
oil-rich Bakassi in the Gulf of Guinea. According to the summit 
programme released by the Presidency in Abuja, Nigerian head of 
state, Gen. Sani Abacha was to receive Cameroonian President 
Paul Biya at the airport and later host the delegates, including 
those from Chad and Niger Republic to a state dinner. 
  Cameroon has said the bilateral summit was subject to the 
withdrawal of Nigerian troops from the disputed territory, while 
Nigeria insists that it would not pull out its soldiers. 
  Egypt, the current chairman of the Organisation of African 
Unity (OAU) had been previously mentioned as another possible 
venue for the summit. But according to political analysts, the 
venue of the eighth summit of the Lake Chad Basin Commission was 
agreed at the last summit in Abuja in 1993. 
  The commission was set up in 1964 as a forum for mutual 
exploration of the mineral resources in the Lake Chad region. 
It also serves as a platform for the resolution of border 
disputes among member states. One of such disputes involved 
Nigeria and Chad in 1983, which led to the establishment of a 
joint patrol team by both countries as an "interim measure for 
eventual proper demarcation of the common borders." The issue 
was eventually resolved at the 36th ministerial session of the 
commission in Maroua, Camaeroon in 1989. 
  But of late, the lake region has come under what 
environmentalists called "indiscrimate human activities, 
especially the construction of dams," which threatens the area 
with "extinction." The lake water is shrinking, and so are the 
mineral resources. 
  An environmentalist, Enoch Okpara, told a recent seminar in 
Lagos that "serious ecological deterioration has taken place and 
this has affected the flora and fauna of the lake region. The 
fish harvest and hence the nutritional health of the people of 
the countries who share the waters of the Chad (lake) are 
adversely affected," he said. In a paper titled "Environment 
Watch: How Do Nigerians Know," Okpara said the problem had 
accentuated migration with "unpleasant consequences on existing 
inadequate infrastructure in various urban centres acting as 
destinations for such migrants." 
  Quoting a recent environmental survey, he said that Nigeria 
alone "lost about 351,000 square km of its mass land to 
desertification, advancing southwards at an estimated rate of at 
least 0.6 km per annum." On the global level, Okpara said that 
the United Nations International Fund for Agricultural 
Development (IFAD), has warned that the world might "lose all 
its productive land mass if the current annual loss of 27 
million hectares of its productive land to desertification" 
remained unchecked. 
  The UN body estimates that some 900 million people are 
afflicted by desertification worldwide, adding that the enormity 
of the problem required urgent international and local remedial 
measures.

  [Text] A joint security force that would safeguard life 
and property within the Lake Chad Basin area is to be set up 
soon. The force is to have political and logistics support from 
member nations of the commission. This is contained in a 
communique issued at the end of the eighth summit of the Lake 
Chad Basin Commission this morning in the Nigerian capital, 
Abuja. The establishment of the joint security force was agreed 
upon by the summit because of its belief that programs on the 
master plan of the commission can only be achieved in a secure 
environment. 
  The commission therefore decided on a rotational leadership 
for the joint security force with defined mode of human and 
material contribution by member states. The headquarters of the 
force will be at Bagakawa, in Borno State of Nigeria. 
  The summit also adopted a master plan designed to halt 
ecological degradation of the lake and its basin. The Nigerian 
head of state, General Sani Abacha, described steps taken by the 
commission in this respect as a significant milestone in the 
search for a lasting solution to a major environmental crisis. 
He said the master plan contained viable and sustainable 
strategies for the management and development of the natural 
resources of the Lake Chad Basin. Gen. Abacha also explained 
that the water resources of the lake had reduced from 25,000 
square km in the 1960's to 20,000 square km at present. 
  The summit admitted the Central African Republic as the 
fifth 
member of the commission. The inclusion of that country was in 
respect of its strategic location as the source of major rivers 
which are flowing to the Lake Chad. 
  The next summit of the commission is to be held in Chad next 
year.

  [Text] Abuja, 24 March (PANA) -- The Central African 
Republic, which attended the just-concluded eighth summit of the 
Lake Chad Basin Commission, in the Nigerian capital, Abuja, has 
been admitted as the fifth member of the commission. 
  A communique at the end of the two-day summit on Thursday 
[24 
March], said the country's admission was based on its "strategic 
location as the source of major rivers which flows into Lake 
Chad." The statement also said that the summit, attended by Gen. 
Sani Abacha (Nigeria), Presidents Idriss Deby of Chad and 
Mahamane Ousmane of Niger, as well as Cameroonian Minister of 
State Frederick Kodock, agreed to set up a joint security force 
to "safeguard life and property" in the lake region. The force, 
to be based in Bagakawa, northern Nigeria, is to have "political 
and logistic support from member nations of the commission." 
  The communique said the need for the force became imperative 
because of the realisation that the objectives of the 
commission's programmes and master-plan "can only be achieved in 
a secured environment." "The commission therefore, decided to 
have rotational leadership for the joint security force with 
defined mode of human and material contributions of 
member-states," it added. 
  The master-plan adopted by the summit would seek to 
"successfully stop all forms of ecological degradations of the 
lake and its basin." 
  Launching a campaign to save the Lake Chad in Abuja on 
Wednesday as part of the eighth summit, Abacha said that the 
master-plan contained "viable and sustainable strategies for the 
management and development of the natural resources of the 
lake." He disclosed that the lake's water had "reduced from 
25,000 square kilometres in the 60's to a meagre area of 20,000 
kilometres at present." 
  The next summit comes up next year in Chad, headquarters of 
the commission, set up in 1964 for mutual exploration of the 
lake's natural resources and to ensure collective security in 
the region.

  [Text] The head of state, Mahamane Ousmane, has just 
returned to Niamey from Abuja, where he took part in the eighth 
summit of the Lake Chad Basin Commission. He was welcomed upon 
arrival by Prime Minister Mahamadou Issoufou. The head of state 
said it was a historic summit, first because it focused on 
essential points including environmental issues, and then 
adopted a master plan on the development and management of the 
ecological issues of the Lake Chad Basin area. The master plan 
includes 36 projects, financed with a total of $85 million, that 
is, 51 billion CFA francs. 
  Within the framework of these 36 projects, the head of state 
said that Niger is concerned with 25 projects. The master plan 
was adopted by the member countries and guidelines were given to 
the Executive Secretariat for implementation. This was one of 
the important decisions taken at the Abuja summit.

  [Excerpts] President Ange Felix Patasse returned to Bangui 
this afternoon at 1425 aboard a special aircraft provided by the 
Federal Republic of Nigeria, after an 18-hour visit to Abuja, 
where he attended the eighth summit of the Lake Chad Basin 
Commission [LCBC]. In the VIP lounge of the Bangui-Npoko 
International Airport, President Patasse announced that the 
Central African Republic [CAR] had joined the LCBC. He stated 
this during an interview with Adrien Ngueya: 
  [Begin recording] Ngueya: Mr. President, you left 
Bangui yesterday and are back today. What was the CAR's 
interest in being at the LCBC summit? 
  Patasse: Before answering your question I would 
first of all like to discharge a duty, that of thanking the 
entire population of the CAR, and informing them that I have 
returned very comforted. This is because Africa has woken up. I 
would also like to thank Gen. Sani Abacha, leader of the Federal 
Republic of Nigeria, and the entire Nigerian people for the 
reception accorded me yesterday and this morning. [passage 
omitted] 
  As you know, the CAR is the main water source for the Lake 
Chad. As I speak, Lake Chad is in danger. From an initial area 
of 25,000 square kilometers, Lake Chad now covers only 1.5 
square kilometers. Despite all that has been done, the 
encroachment of the desert and the sahel continues. The only 
thing we can do now is to try to save Lake Chad. Fortunately 
the heads of state of the LCBC member countries understand that 
they cannot find solutions to Lake Chad's problems without the 
CAR. 
  In 1964 the countries bordering Lake Chad decided to create 
the LCBC. At that time there was plenty of water, and in our 
capacity as the then minister of rural development in this 
country, we called for the adhesion of the CAR to the LCBC. Our 
appeal was not heeded, and at that time we threatened to divert 
the waters of the Laou and the Louam to the south, but wisdom 
prevailed and today we have now become a member of the LCBC, not 
to ask for anything, but as a member who has something to offer. 
That is why the Abuja summit constitutes a decisive step on the 
way to true regional integration. The four member countries -- 
Nigeria, Niger, Chad, Cameroon -- (?border on) Chad Lake, but 
the CAR possesses the headwaters, which puts us in a privileged 
situation. That is why the heads of state asked for my 
presence, to know whether the CAR would like to be part and 
parcel of this commission. There will be some readjustments to 
make, because desertification is continuing, and it is not in 
our interest to let it encroach upon our respective countries. 
On this occasion we once again demonstrated our sense of 
solidarity [words indistinct]. All the member countries 
realized the looming danger, and we also stated that, since the 
CAR is the backbone of the Lake Chad basin and that of the Congo 
River, we will have a decisive role to play. That is why the 
heads of state are counting on the CAR, so that we can fully 
contribute to the achievement of this regional integration. We, 
therefore, hoisted the CAR flag among those of the LCBC member 
countries, and for us, within the framework of changes wanted by 
the CAR people, this membership in the LCBC is additional proof 
that we have recorded a victory. That is in a few words what I 
can tell you. I came back very (?satisfied). I spoke on behalf 
of the people of the CAR with pride and conviction that our 
country has a decisive role to play. The ideals of Boganda 
[deceased prominent political figure] and of the entire 
population of the CAR -- who struggled for regional integration 
-- are being proved correct each day. These are the ideals we 
have adopted. 
  That is why we want a dynamic and concrete diplomacy, and 
why 
we have to use our knowledge and experience, so that Central 
Africa, and in short Africa, can say that at last Africans have 
understood the situation and are now pooling their resources for 
the welfare of the entire African people. I thank you. [end 
recording] 
  Outside this summit, President Patasse and Chadian Head of 
State Idriss Deby held discussions this morning before leaving 
Abuja. Our colleague, Koudeyere Nokonk, who was present in 
Abuja, interviewed President Deby. 
  [Begin recording] Nokonk: Mr. President, the 
deliberations of the summit were suspended yesterday to wait for 
the CAR leader. Can you explain the reasons for that decision? 
  Deby: First of all I would like to air my views, 
that is, Chad's views, on the membership of the CAR in the LCBC. 
Chad is very happy about the CAR's new membership in the 
commission. It is a great event which contributes to the 
consolidation of the LCBC. In fact, we suspended the 
deliberations after the first plenary session at the level of 
the heads of state to wait for the arrival of my brother, 
President Patasse. This is because we know that the CAR's 
contribution to making decisions concerning the entire subregion 
is essential. There was also a need for the CAR to participate 
in decisions which had to be taken immediately after it joined 
the LCBC. Furthermore, Patasse was willing and fully ready to 
contribute, and that is why we deemed it useful to wait for him. 
  The arrival of President Patasse -- who actively took part 
in 
very (?significant) deliberations yesterday evening, and in the 
decisions that you heard about and which continue (?to be 
commented) on -- was a major event in all that can affect the 
commission's future. I am happy about that, and I think that we 
have (?strong) support within the LCBC, not only concerning the 
CAR's membership, but also thanks to the new dimension that we 
gave to the LCBC. [end recording]

  [Text] Beijing, March 22 (XINHUA) -- China's water shortage 
has worsened as a result of booming economic and social 
development and pollution, Chinese Minister of Water Resources 
Niu Maosheng said here today. 
  Speaking at a rally today marking the Second Annual World 
Day 
for Water, the minister said that China's per capita share of 
water reserves has been decreasing. 
  In China it amounts to 2,400 cubic meters per head, only 
about one fourth of the world's average and ranking 88th in the 
world, said the minister. 
  He attributed the booming economic and social development, 
population growth and pollution to the decrease. 
  According to the minister, China took the lead in the world 
by mapping out "China's Agenda 21," a national strategy for 
sustainable social and economic development, which gives 
priority to protection and efficient use of water. 
  The strategy was drafted in response to the call made by the 
United Nations Environment and Development Conference held in 
Brazil, which stressed protection of natural resources and 
sustainable development. 
  China has been investing heavily, and will continue to do 
so, 
in water conservancy projects, he added. 
  Work on preparatory projects for the huge Three Gorges Water 
Conservancy Dam on the Chang Jiang River is in full swing. The 
scheme will create the world's most powerful hydro-electric 
plant and a huge reservoir. 
  Work on other large water conservancy projects, such as 
Xiaolangdi and Wanjiazhai, which it is estimated will cost 
billions of U.S. dollars, has begun or is soon to start. 
  Another costly diversion project has been listed on the 
agenda of the Chinese Government. It is designed to divert 
water from the Chang Jiang River northward to Beijing, Tianjin, 
Hebei Province and Henan Province, which are suffering from 
water shortages. 
  Romulo Garcia, acting resident representative of the United 
Nations Development Program (UNDP) in Beijing, said that in 
recent years UNDP had been involved in a number of initiatives 
to assist the government in its water related programs. 
  The programs include the northern China water management 
project, the rural water supply and sanitation in poor and 
remote areas project, and the assessment of China's water sector 
in Guizhou Province and master plan for the development of water 
resources in northern Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region. 
  The United Nations General Assembly resolved last year to 
have March 22 observed every year as the world day for water. 
  The United Nations estimates that 1.2 billion people still 
do 
not have access to safe water, he said. 
  Niu Maosheng added that over 50 countries or regions have a 
shortage of water, and water shortage has become a universal 
problem for cities all over the world.

<F P=106> [XINHUA "Feature": "Guangzhou in Green Deficit"] </F>
  [Text] Guangzhou, March 22 (XINHUA) -- Guangzhou, one of 
the Chinese cities with the most dynamic economy, is now in a 
green deficit. 
  While roads are getting wider and skyscrapers are rising 
higher, trees and lawns are becoming rare in this capital of 
south Guangdong Province. 
  Even kapok, the city flower that once bloomed into a 
beautiful vision of red all over Guangzhou, is taking a good 
search to find. 
  Sources from the city bureau of parks and woods said the 
number of kapoks totals a mere 1,200 in the old town. Most of 
them are in streets and lanes too out-of-the-way to be seen by 
visitors. 
  The expansion of Dongfeng Road is regarded as one of the 
biggest and most successful projects in urban construction. It 
now runs from the east to the west end of the city and makes 
traffic much smoother. 
  However, walking, cycling or driving right under the 
scorching summer sun seems to be as irritating as sitting in the 
bygone traffic jams, and makes citizens long for the cool shadow 
of the trees that had lined the road for more than 25 years. 
  The sources said that more than one-third of the trees in 
the 
old town have disappeared in road expansion works in the past 
few years. 
  Experts from the bureau complained that the government and 
city planners seem to regard trees and lawns as mere decorative 
touches that can be easily obliterated whenever they come into 
conflict with construction. 
  For nearly ten years, the city's annual spending on the 
green 
cause has stagnated between two to three million yuan, which 
falls far short of a reasonable necessity, the experts claimed. 
  Considering that many Chinese cities are facing the same 
problem, the experts urged that China's city planners and 
officials should learn more from their foreign counterparts, and 
give more space to green land in the concrete jungle. 
  The experts estimate that Guangzhou will need to invest over 
500 million yuan before it can provide each citizen with five 
square meters of green land, as it plans. 
  Understanding that the city government alone can hardly 
supply all of the money, the experts called for all sectors of 
society to take actions before the green deficit becomes a green 
crisis.

  [Text] Shijiazhuang, March 23 (XINHUA) -- Baiyangdian, the 
biggest inland lake in north China, will shine brighter as the 
local government has stepped up its effort to protect the `Pearl 
of North China' from pollution. 
  Oxygen-consuming waste water discharged into the lake has 
dropped by some 40 percent in the past year, according to 
environmental protection officials from Baoding city, a dozen km 
from the lake in Hebei Province. 
  A working group set up in 1992 and headed by the mayor of 
the 
city is now responsible for controlling the flow of pollutants 
into the lake. 
  A sewage treatment plant that can use coal dust from a 
thermal power plant to recycle 50,000 tons of waste water 
discharged by a paper mill has recently been put into operation 
by the lakeside. The five-million-yuan plant is a model project 
supervised by the State Environmental Protection Agency. 
  Another two waste water treatment plants financed by the 
central and local governments and through a Finnish Government 
loan are now under construction. Each will be able to treat 
80,000 tons of waste water a day. 
  In 1992, a paper mill and a chemical plant were closed down 
by the city government to reduce waste discharges into the lake. 
  Since 1990, factories in the area have had to pass 
environmental assessments by the government before being allowed 
to discharge waste into the lake. So far 45 factories have been 
licensed, according to the officials.

  [Text] Guangzhou, 22 Mar (ZHONGGUO TONGXUN SHE)--A number 
of water conservation specialists of Guangdong Province 
yesterday (21 March) warned against a water resources crisis in 
Guangdong. 
  The specialists gave the warning at a meeting here on the 
eve 
of the ``World Water Day.'' 
  At the meeting, the specialists sounded the alarm with a 
series of figures. The average volume of water resources of 
Guangdong Province is about 186 billion cubic meters, ranking 
fifth in China, and the per capita volume is about 2,800 cubic 
meters, ranking tenth in China, 20 percent higher than the 
average for the whole country, but less than the world's average 
by one-third. The specialists pointed out that these water 
resources cannot be fully utilized because of extremely uneven 
distribution in terms of time and place. Each year, 80 percent 
of the water flows into the sea as floods, while the volume of 
water is very small in dry seasons. Zhanjiang is one of the 
five dry areas in China. Water pollution has intensified the 
contradiction between supply and demand of water resources. The 
water shortage will spread from coastal and economically 
developed areas to other areas except the ``Xi Jiang corridor.'' 
At present, the economic development of coastal areas such as 
Shanwei, Shenzhen, Zhanjiang, Honghai Bay, Daya Bay, 
Shangxiachuan Island, Hailing Island, Donghai Island, and Haian, 
have been seriously impeded by the shortage of water resources. 
  In view of the increasingly serious crisis of water 
resources, the specialists urged the whole society to strengthen 
the sense of water, and to change the practice of using water at 
will and of using water free of charge. They called for unified 
planning for water resources, rational development and 
exploitation of water resources, saving water, and using market 
mechanisms to protect water resources.

<F P=106> [Article by Hans Dieter Sauer: ``Opportunities for Export of </F>
Environmental Technology to China''] 
  [Text] [First paragraph editor's summary] VDI-N, 
Dusesseldorf, 18 Feb 94--In China all signs point to growth. 
Even now, in the early phases of the economic boom, great 
ecological dangers are looming on the horizon. An opportunity 
for the environmental technology industry: only ecologically 
sound businesses will save from China from an eco-disaster. 
  China's economy is heading for record heights: it led the 
world last year with a growth rate of 13 percent. But the period 
of frantic economic growth is coming at the expense of the 
environment. In the report ``Environmental Strategy for Asia,'' 
the World Bank is now sounding the alarm. It emphasizes that in 
China the destruction of natural resources has already reached a 
level which endangers further economic development. China expert 
Vaclav Smil of the University of Manitoba in Canada also paints 
a dark picture: ``There is no doubt that in spite of advances in 
certain areas the condition of the environment in China will be 
more alarming in the year 2000 than it was in 1990.'' 
  Chinese scientists are also aware of how serious the 
situation is. In the proposal of the environmental report for 
1992 the director of the Chinese environmental agency NEPA 
(National Environmental Protection Agency), Qu Geping, lamented: 
``Environmental protection in China cannot keep pace with the 
reshaping of our economy from a planned economy to a market 
economy.'' There it is considered a success if air and water 
pollution rise more slowly than economic growth. The emission of 
sulfur dioxide rose by ``only'' 3.9 percent to 16.85 million 
tons, dust yield rose by 7.9 percent to 14.14 million tons, and 
sewage increased by 9 percent to 36.65 billion cubic meters. 
  Four-fifths of the air pollution is to be blamed on coal as 
an energy source: 1.1 billion tons are burned annually, 
accounting for 75 percent of Chinese energy use. Two-thirds of 
the coal used is burned in industry or for home heating without 
further treatment; flue gas treatment is virtually unknown. 
According to official reports the permissible average value of 
300 micrograms of particles per cubic meter of air is being 
exceeded in 50 of 55 cities investigated. By comparison, in 
Germany the maximum average annual value is 150 micrograms per 
cubic meter. 
  As a result of the economic boom, environmental stresses 
have 
also begun to have an effect at ground level. Since the 
legalization of private business thousands and thousands of 
small businesses have arisen in the villages, and while they 
work with high economic efficiency--at the moment they are 
producing 30 percent of the gross national product--because of 
their primitive technical equipment they emit waste gases and 
sewage unfiltered into the environment. Oskar Weggel of the 
Institute for Asian Studies in Hamburg gives a vivid 
description: ``Innumerable mini-factory chimneys pour coal dust 
into the atmosphere, and industrial sewage flows from a 
labyrinth of waste pipes into the country's streams and rivers.'' 
  It is not that there are no laws in China against 
environmental pollution. Environmental protection is even 
anchored in the constitution. But officials on the provincial 
and district level have something else on their minds besides 
maintaining environmental standards. Last year the central 
government was forced to send teams of inspectors through the 
provinces to ``raise consciousness about obeying the law.'' A 
summary of the results of the investigation stated: ``Many local 
politicians are sacrificing the environment in order to make 
economic profits.'' 
  But the wretched state of the environment should not be 
blamed solely on the rampant uncontrolled growth of the private 
sector; the inherited burdens of a planned economy have just as 
harmful an effect. According to a NEPA list, approximately 3,000 
businesses, most of them still the property of the state, 
account for 60 percent of industrial environmental pollution. 
Many of these companies have been so mismanaged that there is no 
money available for environmental investment. 
  The leading environmental problem in China is water 
pollution. It is true that initial progress was made in the 
treatment of industrial wastes in 1992; for instance, arsenic 
and cyanide contamination dropped by about 23 percent. But the 
treatment of communal sewage is in a very bad state; drains 
exist only in the large cities. Of the 13.3 billion cubic meters 
of sewage gathered there annually, only 10 percent is 
superficially cleaned. In Shanghai, a city of 13 million 
inhabitants, only 4 percent of about 2 billion cubic meters of 
sewage is cleaned; the rest goes into the Huangpu River 
untreated. Since the groundwater is also frequently contaminated 
in many places, often 50 million people have only polluted water 
to drink. 
  ``Chinese water services are vitally endangered,'' is the 
evaluation of the authors of the report ``Environmental 
Protection in the People's Republic of China,'' which was 
recently presented at the first German-Chinese environmental 
symposium in Bergheim, near Cologne. For the report the Research 
Institutes for Water and Waste Management in Aachen and Erfstadt 
(FiW) and the Institute for Community Water Management of the 
RWTH in Aachen evaluated numerous Chinese sources. 
  Water pollution is even slowing down further economic 
development, regionally speaking. Reiner Fonteyn, chief 
executive of the FiW, explains this point with an example from 
Shanxi province. There a coal factory cannot be expanded because 
the cooling water from the river is already too polluted. 
Economic pressure has now forced the construction of a 
purification plant for the city of Yangquan, which lies 
upstream. ``China has no other choice than to invest massively 
in environmental protection,'' according to Fonteyn, whose 
institute has now signed cooperative agreements with several 
Chinese research institutes about the planning of purification 
plants. 
  In theory, this opens up absolutely unlimited sales 
possibilities for German manufacturers of ecotechnology. But 
access to the Chinese market is anything but easy. In North 
Rhine-Westphalia, companies from the ecotechnology 
sector--supported by the Land government--have formed the 
association ``Pro Asia e. V.'' to make entry into the market 
easier through exchange of information and experience. 
  The region around the Rhine and the Ruhr is taking on the 
role of an outrider in German-Chinese cooperation: it supports 
partnerships with three Chinese provinces. As soon as February 
the governer of Sichuan province will visit, accompanies by 
economic experts, and in March a joint delegation from the 
environmental and economic ministries in Duesseldorf will travel 
to Jiangsu. 
  But good relations do not necessarily turn into business 
deals. Financing is always a significant hurdle in project 
negotiations. The Japanese are emerging as powerful rivals, 
facilitating the financing of investments with favorable credit 
rates, according to Pro Asia's chairman, Dieter Wunderlich. 
  Still, German industry is not pursuing a forlorn hope. 
According to statistics from the Federal Agency for Foreign 
Trade Information (BfAI) in Cologne, German export of 
ecotechnology to China has increased in the last few years and 
reached a value of DM392 million in 1992. Half of this amount 
consisted of high-tech products from the metrological, 
regulating and control technologies. 
  By the year 2000 the Chinese government hopes to have 
invested a total of 200 billion yuan, approximately DM40 
billion, in environmental protection. But in the opinion of 
experts that will only suffice to eliminate the worst damage. 
China's environmental crisis cannot be overcome by environmental 
repair alone. As early as 1989 the Institute for Ecological 
Research of the Chinese Academy of Sciences issued this warning: 
it is not an increase in the gross national product but planning 
for the future that must be the highest political goal. So far 
this admonition has fallen on deaf ears: between 1989 and 1993 
economic growth increased from 4 percent to 13 percent.

  [Text] Chemical wastes that have been parked in limbo for 
the past five months in Jiangsu Province have all been sent 
back, the Shanghai-based Wenhui Daily reported on Sunday. 
  The chemical wastes, imported under the guise of 
``industrial-use fuel,'' were believed to be harmful to the 
environment. 
  While the wastes remained at the Shangyuanmen berth in 
Jiangsu's capital, Nanjing, vigilant environmental monitoring 
ensured that the water in that stretch of the Yangtze River and 
the nearby Shangyuanmen Water Plant were not contaminated by the 
chemicals, the newspaper reported. 
  The ``fuel'' was sold to the Shanghai Huafu Industrial and 
Commercial Company for $27 per ton through a contract with a 
South Korean company signed last August. 
  According to the contract, 200,000 tons industrial fuel were 
to be imported between 1993 and 1995. 
  The first batch of ``fuel'' arrived at the Nanjing port last 
September. But inspections showed that most of the 1,288-ton 
shipment was harmful chemical wastes. 
  Customs officials at Nanjing Port sealed up the cargo 
immediately and asked the importers to return the wastes. After 
half a year's negotiation, the South Korean company eventually 
agreed to take back the wastes. 
  But that was not the end of the story. 
  According to Saturday's China Environment News, a 
representative from the company in South Korea declared that 
they had sufficient evidence to show that it was their Chinese 
counterpart who asked to buy chemical wastes from South Korea. 
The Chinese side, however, said that it was the Korean company 
who violated the contract. 
  A spokesman from the National Environmental Protection 
Agency 
(NEPA) reiterated that the event was a typical trans-national 
waste-dumping incident. 
  He said that NEPA has taken actions against companies that 
profit by importing and processing harmful waste from other 
countries. 
  In March 1991, NEPA and the General Administration of 
Customs 
prohibited the import of industrial wastes harmful to the 
environment. The regulations have been enforced in many parts of 
the country and have played a big role in preserving the 
environment. 
  As one example, Southeast China's Fujian Province has 
several 
times rejected attempts to import overseas rubbish into the 
province.

<F P=106> [Article by Zhu Baoxia: ``State Plans Massive Assault on </F>
Pollution''] 
  [Text] The government plans to develop eight major 
environmental projects in the next three years in a bid to 
control industrial pollution by the turn of the century. 
  The schemes will be supported by international financial 
organizations including the World Bank, the Asian Development 
Bank and Global Environmental Facilities (GEF). 
  Up to $1.2 billion is needed to launch the projects which 
will treat water and air pollution and dispose of solid waste, 
said an official from the Foreign Economic Cooperation Office of 
the National Environmental Protection Agency (NEPA). 
  The prevention of acid rain and studies on the environment 
are also high on the list of the planned projects. 
  NEPA is due to get grants of $200 million to $300 million 
from GEF to control greenhouse gases and to protect 
bio-diversity. 
  The agency is now selecting suitable projects around the 
country. Its reports will be sent to the international 
organizations for further evaluation. 
  NEPA officials hope the eight projects will solve 
environmental problems which damage people's health, like 
pollution in Lake Dianchi in Yunnan Province and Lake Chaohu in 
Anhui Province. 
  They also hope the projects will check the spread of acid 
rain in the south of the country. 
  In recent years, China has worked more and more with 
international organizations on the environment. 
  By the end of last year, NEPA had set up 21 Sino-foreign 
environmental protection projects. 
  The World Bank and the Asian Development Bank had loaned the 
agency $1.14 billion by 1993 and together with the GEF, they had 
granted China $65.61 million for environmental protection and 
research. 
  The funding helped environmental protections schemes in 
Shanghai and Liaoning Province, research in Hangzhou Bay and 
studies on urban infrastructure throughout China. 
  It also helped to promote local environmental protection 
work 
and improve NEPA's administrative capacity, said Xie Zhenhua, 
the agency's director. 
  Cooperation between China and the international agencies has 
enabled the country to obtain advanced environmental protection 
facilities and improved its environmental information network.

  [Text] Shenyang, April 7 (XINHUA) -- The sky is clearer and 
the air cleaner in Shenyang, this once pollution-ridden capital 
of northeast China's Liaoning Province, according to the city's 
environmental agency. 
  Shenyang is one of the most important heavy industrial 
centers in China. The city's gross national product grew at an 
average annual rate of 15.6 percent to reach 37.45 billion yuan 
in 1993, an increase of 26 billion yuan over the 1986 figure. 
  The results of monitoring by the environmental agency show 
that annual mean value of the total suspended particles per 
cubic meter of air in 1993 was 0.434 mg, 0.87 mg less than in 
1986, the amount of monthly dust fall per square kilometer in 
the year was 29.81 tons, 11.2 tons less than eight years ago and 
the annual value of the content of sulphur dioxide per standard 
square meter in the air was 0.122 mg, 0.037 mg less than eight 
years ago. 
  The city used more than 10 million tons of coal last year, 
accounting for 70 percent of the total amount of energy consumed. 
  The city has been working hard to eliminate pollution 
sources, especially soot and dust emitted by factories and 
family stoves. Restaurants in urban areas of the city are 
required to use clean fuels. More than 3,000 old-fashioned 
boilers have been replaced by modern central heating facilities. 
  Any enterprise whose discharge of wastes and dust exceeds 
the 
state set standards would be warned or fined. 
  The city authorities have also encouraged a tree planting 
campaign as part of the efforts to improve the environmental 
quality.

  [Text] Beijing, April 6, (XINHUA) -- China will take 
tougher action against conduct severely violating the laws and 
regulations on environmental protection and will mete out stern 
punishment to those involved in violations that result in grave 
consequences. 
  This was outlined by senior officials from the National 
People's Congress (NPC) and the State Council here today. 
  Speaking at a conference of the NPC's Environment and 
Resources Protection Committee, NPC Vice-President Wang Bingqian 
said that new pollution sources have joined old ones to compound 
the country's deteriorating environment, due to local 
environment protection violations in the process of launching 
new construction projects. 
  He said rampant poaching, killing, selling and buying of 
endangered and rare animals which are under national protection 
are still going on in some places, adding that small and poorly 
equipped cement plants, paper mills, petrochemical works and 
smelting furnaces, though strictly forbidden by law, have staged 
a comeback in parts of China. 
  Such cases of violating environment protection laws must not 
be ducked but rather be resolutely and promptly dealt with, the 
official noted. 
  Song Jian, state councillor and director of the State 
Council 
Environment Protection Committee, said that China's environment 
protection laws need to be modified to include criminal 
penalties. Violators should be punished as severely as smugglers 
and drug traffickers. He added that detention and sentences 
must be meted out to those who deserve them. 
  According to a summary report delivered to the meeting by 
Xie 
Zhenhua, director of the State Environment Protection Bureau, 
illegal poaching, killing, smuggling, selling and buying of 
protected wild animals have survived repeated government sweeps, 
and hotels and restaurants in some areas are still making a 
fortune out of dishes based on rare animals. 
  The report pointed out that some places have introduced from 
abroad projects that fall short of Chinese environment 
protection requirements, while other places have even imported 
from outside China harmful waste. 
  Xie said that technologically poor equipment and a lack of 
counter-pollution measures in many rural enterprises account for 
severe environmental pollution and ecological disturbance in a 
wide range of areas. 
  He said that one of the major problems most complained of by 
urban residents is the pollution caused by waste water, waste 
gas, rubbish and noise, which, along with the boom in the 
service industry, have emerged as a hard nut to crack. 
  Some localities have eagerly launched high energy-consuming 
and pollution-prone projects at the cost of environment 
deterioration to pursue short-term economic benefits, the 
official said. 
  According to the Chinese official, the air quality in only a 
few of the country's 500 major cities has reached the state-set 
first-grade standard. He said that South China has been plagued 
by the pollution of acid rain, adding that economic losses from 
acid rain can add up to more than 14 billion yuan in Guangdong 
and Sichuan Provinces. 
  Official sources said that relevant departments with the NPC 
and State Council this year will organize ten environment 
inspection teams, which will travel to Hebei, Jilin, Zhejiang, 
Fujian, Henan, Hunan, Sichuan and Guizhou Provinces and Inner 
Mongolia and Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Regions to handle cases 
of environment violations.

  [Text] Harbin, April 3 (XINHUA) -- Wild Siberian tigers, 
which were thought to be on the verge of extinction until 
recently, are being sighted more and more frequently nowadays in 
northeast China, due to expanding local forest coverage and 
meticulous human protective measures. 
  Miao Liping, a worker with the Dongfanghong Forestry Bureau 
in Heilongjiang Province, and other passengers on a bus saw a 
female Siberian tiger and three cubs drinking from a spring near 
the Qiyuan Forest Farm not so long ago. The cubs were each 
about one m long and 50 cm tall. They were so leisurely as if 
they knew that they were specially protected by the government 
and people. 
  There have also been reports that the endangered animals 
were 
recently seen in the Xiao Hinggan Mountains, Wanda Mountains and 
Laoye Ridge, also in Heilongjiang Province. 
  The tiger used to be regarded as the ``king'' of the animal 
world in China but human beings proved to be more powerful. As 
human activities expanded, the number of tigers was reduced 
drastically until the government and people in the country 
urgently adopted measures to protect the tiger and other 
endangered animals in the past decades so as to maintain 
ecological balance. 
  The Siberian tiger has also been listed as the most 
endangered of ten species of wild animals by the World Wildlife 
Fund International. It is the largest among all the ten species 
of tigers in the world. 
  A group of wildlife experts from the northeast China 
Forestry 
University confirmed that the number of wild Siberian tigers in 
China has increased to nearly 100 from the 1990 figure of 30. 
The experts have been keeping tract of the animal since 1980. 
  There are now less than 300 wild Siberian tigers in the 
whole 
world, exclusively in northeast China and Siberia. More are 
being bred in captivity. 
  According to experts, a Siberian tiger usually needs an area 
of a dozen sq km of forest to survive. It lives alone and is 
particular about selecting a spouse. An estrous female Siberian 
tiger has often to wander a vast distance before finding a male 
tiger. If the two tigers do not get along with each other, the 
female tiger has to look for another male tiger. Very often, 
before the female tiger finds a spouse, her estrum has passed. 
The difficulty for the animal to mate limits its number in the 
wild. 
  China has listed the tiger as a first-class protected animal 
since the early 1950s. Hunting of the tiger and trading in 
products made from tigers have been banned. In 1989 Zhang 
Guojun and two other farmers were sentenced to six years in 
prison for killing a Siberian tiger. In January this year 50 kg 
of tiger bones confiscated from smugglers and destined for use 
in traditional Chinese medicinal recipes were burned. 
  The country has also set up several nature forest reserves 
with a total acreage of 100,000 ha. The oldest one was 
established in Heilongjiang in 1958. 
In 1986 the China Administrative Office in Charge of Endangered, 
Rare and Precious Animals and the Heilongjiang Provincial 
Government invested over 10 million yuan (about 1.2 million U.S. 
dollars) to establish a breeding center in a mountainous forest 
at Hengdaohezi in Hailin County, Heilongjiang, to raise Siberian 
tigers in captivity. The annual expenses for feed, equipment 
and medical treatment in the center surpasses three million 
yuan. The initial population of five male and 15 female 
Siberian tigers at the center were collected from zoos in 
Beijing, Shanghai, Chengdu and Guangzhou. 
  Tigers at the center are fed at 3:30 p.m. in the spring, 
fall 
and winter, and at 4:00 p.m. in summer. A total of three head 
of cattle are slaughtered to feed them daily. In addition, 
nutritional materials such as milk, eggs, liver, mutton, pork 
bones, racoon meat, yeast, multivitamins and dog meat are added 
to their food. 
  However, feeding is withheld on Sunday to increase their 
ability to endure the torments of hunger, as in the wild. On 
Fridays they are fed live food, mainly chickens and rabbits, to 
maintain their preying ability. ``This is to pave the way for 
their return to the wild,'' said Liu Xinchen, director of the 
center. 
  It has been reported that the estrus, mating and whelping 
phases of the Siberian tiger are strongly seasonal. However, 
Director Liu said, this seasonal behavior can be changed by 
using scientific management and nutrients. The tigers can be in 
estrus, mate, be pregnant and whelp in every season, with the 
peak birth rate occuring from June to August. The gestation 
periods of 12 pregnancies at the center so far has been 107 to 
108 days. 
  Scientists at the center also noted that when a male tiger 
was permitted to mate with five females at will, it mated 333 
times over 35 days, resulting in three whelpings. By adopting a 
managed mating method or separating the male and female tigers 
for 12 hours after each mating, however, all five females 
whelped, although merely 51 matings were allowed in 24 days. 
Moreover, eight cubs were produced from the natural method and 
14 from the managed method. 
  The tiger in captivity also selects its spouse carefully, 
Director Liu stressed. The technicians have to transfer a male 
tiger to the neighboring shed of a female tiger to let them get 
familiar with each other first. Even so, many of the 
neighboring tigers fail to mate. 
  A male tiger called ``Beijing Prince,'' which was 
transferred 
from the Beijing Zoo to the center in 1986, refused to mate 
female tiger no. 001 in 1987. Later, it was introduced to 
female tiger no. 014. Since then, ``Beijing Prince'' has never 
shown any interest in any other female tiger. 
  After seven years of effort, the center has succeeded in 
increasing its initial tiger population to 73. During this 
period 67 cubs in 28 litters have been born, and 58 have 
survived. Female tiger no. 010 has given birth to 25 cubs in 
seven litters, with the largest litter size being five. The 
tiger has been honored as a ``Heroic Mother.'' Both the litter 
size and the survival rate are records and the center is now the 
largest of its kind in the world. 
  Director Liu revealed that the center has mapped out a 
program to send the tigers raised in captivity back to the wild. 
It is expected to return some of them to nature by the year 
2003.

  [Excerpts] Jakarta, KOMPAS -- After conducting 
investigations from October 1993 to February this year, an 
environment protection group, Wahana Lingkungan Hidup Indonesia 
[Indonesian Environment Vehicle or Walhi], managed to identify 
10 local companies which imported dangerous and toxic plastic 
waste. Walhi urged the government to take action against these 
companies by pressuring them to return the toxic waste to the 
country of origin, and if necessary, take legal action against 
them. 
  Walhi's program director Muhammad Sifaudin Zulkarnaen 
disclosed the findings to reporters at his office in Jakarta on 
17 March. Zulkarnaen was accompanied at the news conference by 
Walhi's information manager, Lili Hasannudin. 
  The 10 companies are based in Jakarta and have imported at 
least 68 containers of plastic waste through Tanjung Priuk Port 
since 25 November 1992. In Ministerial Decree No. 349 dated 21 
November 1992, the trade minister banned the import of 
industrial waste or plastic waste into the country effective 25 
November 1992. [passage omitted]

  Zulkarnaen said his group's investigation results are 
dependable. Walhi based its investigations on authentic shipping 
documents, which had been used to import the waste into the 
country. The documents revealed the identity of the importing 
companies as well as the number of containers they ordered. The 
containers were then checked and those found to have dangerous 
and toxic waste had the owner' name put in the list. Walhi also 
contacted each company to check the accuracy of its 
investigations. [passage omitted]

  [Text] Tokyo, April 1 KYODO -- Japan will host a working 
group meeting on the environment in the multilateral track of 
the Middle East peace process on Wednesday and Thursday [6-7 
April] in The Hague, the Netherlands, the Foreign Ministry said 
Friday. 
  The meeting's co-sponsors, the United States and Russia, 
have 
sent invitations to the meeting to more than 40 countries or 
organizations including the parties directly concerned in the 
negotiations, Arab nations and European countries, the ministry 
said. 
  Participants will discuss management and public awareness of 
the environment, sewage and solid waste disposal, emergency 
preparedness and prevention of marine pollution, and 
desertification control, to promote environmental conservation 
in the middle east, it said. 
  Toshinori Shigeie, deputy director general of the Foreign 
Ministry's Middle Eastern and African Affairs Bureau, and 
officials from ministry and other relevant ministries will 
attend, it said. [as received] 
  The working group on environment is one of the five working 
groups under the Middle East multilateral peace process which 
started in 1992 in Moscow. 
  The other four working groups are on economic development, 
arms control and regional security, water resources and refugees.

  [Text] Tokyo, April 7 KYODO -- Prime Minister Morihiro 
Hosokawa said Thursday [7 April] Japan will allocate $11 million 
to Kazakhstan to help dismantle its nuclear weapons, Foreign 
Ministry officials said. 
  Hosokawa made the announcement in a meeting with Kazakhstan 
President Nursultan Nazarbayev, who arrived in Japan on 
Wednesday for a four-day visit. 
  The amount is part of a total of $100 million Japan pledged 
last year to help four former Soviet republics -- Russia, 
Ukraine, Belarus and Kazakhstan -- dismantle their nuclear 
weapons. 
  The officials said detailed use of the $11 million will be 
decided in discussions between the two sides at a committee on 
cooperation for the destruction of nuclear weapons. 
  Hosokawa praised Kazakhstan's efforts to denuclearize, 
democratize and shift toward a market-oriented economy, they 
said. 
  Kazakhstan joined the Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty (NPT) 
as a nonnuclear weapon state last November. 
  Nazarbayev, 53, asked for Japanese cooperation in helping 
his 
country tackle environmental pollution at the Semipalatinsk 
nuclear testing site and in the Aral Sea, the officials said. 
  Specifically, he requested cooperation in providing medical 
equipment for hospitals treating people exposed to radioactivity 
near Semipalatinsk. 
  Hosokawa said Japan will seriously consider cooperation with 
the hospitals, which the ministry officials said is expected to 
be covered by the $11 million. 
  An estimated 233 million tons of radioactive substances are 
believed to be left in Kazakhstan. 
  As for environmental problems in the Aral Sea, Hosokawa said 
the problem should be solved internationally but added Japan 
would study what it can do, the officials said. 
  Also during the 30-minute meeting, followed by an hourlong 
dinner, Nazarbayev, 53, said he supports Japan's bid to become a 
permanent member of the UN Security Council. 
  A joint statement signed by the two leaders prior to the 
meeting said Kazakhstan ``expressed the hope'' that Japan would 
become a permanent member of the Security Council and ``fulfill 
its relevant responsibilities.'' 
  Hosokawa told Nazarbayev Japan intends to fulfill its 
responsibilities within its capabilities, the officials said. 
  On the international front, the Kazakhstan president 
proposed 
holding a conference covering the whole of Asia to build trust. 
  Hosokawa agreed on the importance of creating trust in Asia 
but expressed reluctance to set up a forum covering the whole 
region such as the conference on Security and Cooperation in 
Europe (CSCE). 
  Nazarbayev asked Japan to offer its manufacturing technology 
to Central Asia and suggested setting up a committee between 
Japan and Kazakhstan to study such a possibility. 
  Hosokawa suggested the two sides utilize the existing 
bilateral economic committee. 
  Nazarbayev also offered a list of 1,394 Japanese prisoners 
of 
war detained in Siberia who died in Kazakhstan, the officials 
said. 
  On Friday, Nazarbayev is to meet Emperor Akihito and Empress 
Michiko and give a press conference later in the day.

  [Text] Tokyo, April 7 KYODO -- A government panel Thursday 
[7 April] began formulating industrial guidelines for 
environmental protection, panel officials said. 
  An organ of the Industrial Structure Council, an advisory 
body to the international trade and industry minister, held its 
first meeting to prepare a set of industrial rules for 
protecting the earth's environment in such areas as industrial 
wastes and chemical pollutants such as carbon dioxide emissions. 
  A report to be announced in early June will address the 
importance of sector-by-sector responsibility by Japanese 
businesses for the disposal of harmful chemicals and byproducts 
throughout all stages of business activities from materials 
purchases to manufacturing, distribution and the end-use of 
products, ministry officials said. 
  The report will also call for businesses to establish 
technologies to enable secondary use of both industrial and 
household waste. 
  The panel will hold three more meetings before releasing the 
report entitled, ``An Industrial Vision of the Environment,'' on 
8 June.

  [Text] Tokyo, April 7 KYODO -- Japan will continue to dump 
industrial waste in the ocean despite revision of an 
international treaty which in principle will ban such activities 
from 1996, Environment Agency sources said Thursday [7 April]. 
  The volume of Japan's industrial waste dumped at sea 
accounts 
for two-thirds of the world's total. 
  The government reviewed its dumping in light of the revision 
in the convention on the prevention of marine pollution by 
dumping of wastes and other matters. Even so, it decided to 
endorse dumping of about 80 percent of industrial waste 
currently dumped at sea, the sources said. 
  The material includes construction waste, sewage sludge and 
fluid from the manufacture of clear distilled liquor, they said. 
  The government judged that most industrial wastes dumped in 
the ocean corresponds to materials still permitted by the 
revision, the sources said. 
  The convention was revised at a signatory nations' meeting 
in 
November. Exceptions to the ban include materials such as 
dredged waste, sewage sludge, uncontaminated inert geological 
materials and uncontaminated organic materials of natural origin. 
  The revision leaves each country to judge what will 
correspond to the exceptions. 
  Currently, Japan annually dumps about 4.4 million tons of 
industrial waste, including 2.8 million tons of sludge and 1.3 
tons of waste fluid, they said. 
  The government decided to ban dumping of waste fluid from 
photo processing and some sludge from sewage and construction, 
but the volume of the industrial wastes to be reduced will be 
not more than 900,000 tons, or 20 percent of current volume, 
they said. 
  The sources said the decision is a provisional measure 
because the convention may ban all industrial waste dumping 
without exception after 1996.

  [Text] Tokyo, April 5 KYODO -- Japan renewed calls on 
Russia on Tuesday [5 April] to totally ban dumping of 
radioactive wastes in the Sea of Japan and work out as early as 
possible a plan to construct emergency storage and small-scale 
processing facilities. 
  Commenting on reports that Russia may resume the dumping in 
the Sea of Japan next month, Foreign Ministry spokesman Terusuke 
Terada said Japan ``strongly hopes'' that Russia will totally 
ban the ocean dumping by establishing the facilities for 
low-level liquid radioactive wastes. 
  Japan has repeatedly told Russia it is ready to help set up 
such facilities by using funds allocated to a bilateral 
committee for cooperation on the destruction of nuclear weapons 
in Russia, Terada said. 
  ``In order for us to carry out this project, it is a 
prerequisite that the Russian Government actually decides on a 
construction plan for emergency storage and small-scale 
processing facilities,'' Terada told reporters. 
  ``We understand as a matter of fact that while we're engaged 
in dialogue to materialize this project, there will not be any 
ocean dumping by the Russian side,'' he said. 
  Last October, Russia dumped 800 tons of liquid radioactive 
waste in the Sea of Japan. It suspended its planned second 
dumping following protests from Japan and South Korea. 
  Russia's Pacific Fleet indicated it may resume dumping 
nuclear waste in the Sea of Japan in May because its tanker 
TNT-5, loaded with about 500 tons of radioactive waste, is 
decaying and the risk of leakage of the waste is increasing.

  [Text] Tokyo, April 8 KYODO -- The Environment Agency 
endorsed a local government assessment Friday [8 April] that a 
planned reclamation project near a tideland internationally 
recognized as an important waterfowl habitat will have little 
effect on the birds. 
  The agency put its seal of approval on Fukuoka city's 
assessment concerning the construction of an artificial island 
in Hakata Bay, off the Wajiro tideland, clearing the way for the 
controversial project. 
  The agency nevertheless submitted a statement to the 
Transport Ministry, making a strong call for the preservation of 
waterfowl habitat conditions throughout the entire bay, on 
Japan's southwestern island of Kyushu. 
  The agency's approval paved the way for the ministry's 
permission for the 460 billion yen project, which is expected 
later Friday. 
  The ministry plans to call on Fukuoka to prepare for 
registration of the tideland with the Ramsar Convention to 
preserve waterfowl and other wildlife. 
  The project, to create a research and housing complex on a 
400-hectare tract of reclaimed land, is expected to start at the 
end of June. 
  The Wajiro tideland is known as a wintering site for many 
water birds, some of them endangered species. 
  The project has drawn opposition from environmentalists at 
home and abroad. 
  Besides the preservation of living conditions for waterfowl, 
the agency also called for keeping the water clean in Hakata Bay 
and for long-term surveillance of the regional environment for a 
review of the assessment after five years. 
  Environment Agency Director General Wakako Hironaka said her 
agency will seek Fukuoka's efforts to acquire the cooperation of 
local communities to register the entire Hakata Bay with the 
Ramsar Convention. 
  The Wajiro tideland preserves much more nature than the 
Yatsu 
tideland in Chiba Prefecture, which is already registered with 
the convention, she said. 
  ``I believe the environmental protection in the region can 
be 
compatible with the (reclamation) project but I would like to 
ask for reconsideration if it greatly affects the ecosystem.''

  [Text] Vientiane -- Laotian officials have expressed 
concern about the feasibility of the proposed Khon Phapheng 
Resort mega project at Li Phi falls in the southern province of 
Champassak. 
  Thai developers plan to invest in the Bt [baht] 12 billion 
tourism development, which would comprise an international 
airport, a 10-megawatt hydropower station, 100,000-hectares of 
eucalyptus plantations, two 18-hole golf courses, a 1,200-room 
hotel, 1,000 resort units and a casino. 
  An official in Vientiane who asked not to be named said the 
area is plagued with Schistosomiasis disease, better known as 
blood fluke. 
  ``We are suspicious of how the project is going to bring in 
tourists as Schistosomiasis is widespread, unless the project 
has a plan to eliminate the disease first,'' said the officer. 
  ``We are concerned that the project might fail, after having 
already irreversibly destroyed nature in Laos,'' he said. 
  Chanthaviphon Inthavon. deputy director of the National 
Office for Nature Conservation and Watershed Management in 
Vientiane, said he was worried about the proposal to transform 
100,000 hectare of dry deciduous forest into eucalyptus 
plantations. 
  ``It is too ambitious,'' he said. 
  Chanthaviphon said the nature conservation committee had 
suggested the area planted to eucalyptus should be scaled down. 
  ``We recommended that only a limited area, not full scale 
development, for the plantations project should be approved as a 
study whether it will really work,'' he said. 
  Dr. Tysons Robert, a fish biologist of Mahidon University 
and 
one of the few scientists studying the Lower Mekong Basin, said 
the project's impact on fish and riverine ecology is among major 
environmental concerns. 
  Robert said the location of Li Phi falls is unique in the 
whole Mekong system, with rapids extending over 3-5 kilometres. 
  ``It is the only place where the main channel of the Mekong 
has such a big waterfall, separating the lower river from the 
upper river. So it provides a lot of habitats in a long place 
and fish are different,'' said Robert. 
  ``Waterfalls or rapids are healthy places for fish. It's 
good for food, with a lot of oxygen. Many fish prefer to live 
in places with fast flowing water and a rocky habitat. There 
are more fish than other places.'' 
  Robert said the proposed golf course would probably be kept 
green through the use of chemical fertilizers and pesticides, as 
well as water from the mainstream Mekong. All of this could 
affect the fish ecology in the area. 
  ``Water draining from the golf course, which has a lot of 
strange chemicals in it, could have a very bad effect on fish,'' 
noted Robert. 
  Another Laotian official told THE NATION that the small 
hydro-power station will be located at the edge of Khon Phapheng 
fall and will use a ``floating generation system''. 
  The Khon Phapheng resort is planned to be the first 
development project on the mainstream of the Lower Mekong Basin.

  [Text] Kuala Lumpur, March 30 (OANA-BERNAMA) -- The export 
of hazardous waste from the Organisation for Economic 
Cooperation and Development (OECD) countries to non-OECD 
countries has been banned with immediate effect. 
  The decision was reached during the second meeting of 
parties 
to the Basel convention on control of transboundary movement of 
hazardous wastes and disposal concluded in Geneva four days ago, 
after five days of intensive debate. 
  A Foreign Ministry statement said here Tuesday that the 
meeting also decided that the export of hazardous waste from 
OECD countries, destined for recovery or recycling in non-OECD 
countries, should also cease on 31 December 1997, at the latest. 
  The consensus was reached after long and difficult 
negotiations between the Group of 77, a grouping of developing 
nations and China, and leading opponent OECD countries led by 
Australia, Canada, Japan and the United States, it added. 
  Science, Technology and Environment Minister Law Hieng Ding, 
who led the Malaysian delegation to the meeting, and his Danish 
counterpart played a key role in steering the political 
direction and decision in arriving at the landmark agreement, it 
said. 
  In his address at the meeting, Law labelled the export of 
hazardous waste to developing countries as environmental crime, 
the statement said. 
  He called on the OECD countries to uphold environmental 
justice and assist devaloping countries in environmental 
capacity building, it said. 
  Law also informed the meeting about the illegal dumping of 
toxic tanker sludge in Malaysian waters and the attempt to seek 
exclusion of control under the Basel Convention. 
  He said stern enforcement action would continue to be taken 
against any ship or tankers engaging in such activities in 
accordance with Malaysia's interpretation of the convention. 
  Law warned that such ships would be detained and auctioned 
under Malaysian laws.

  [Text] Wellington, March 29 (AFP) -- New Zealand and 
Britain are to each pay 12 million NZ dollars (6.8 million U.S. 
dollars) in compensation to the cenral Pacific republic of 
Nauru, Foreign Minister Don McKinnon said Tuesday. 
  The payment, to be made to Australia, was the two countries' 
contribution towards settlement of an International Court of 
Justice (ICJ) case brought by Nauru. 
  Australian Prime Minister Paul Keating last year announced 
Canberra would pay 107 million Australian dollars (75 million 
U.S.) to Nauru to assist in rehabilitation of the island, 
severely strip mined for its phosphate under colonial rule. 
  Australia, New Zealand and Britain shared rule of Nauru from 
1914 to 1968 and, under the quasi-government British Phosphate 
Commission (BPC), took the phosphate at very low prices, while 
paying nothing to repair the land. 
  After Keating made the sudden offer as Nauru prepared to 
take 
Australia to the ICJ. [sentence as received] 
  ``Australia had sought appropriate contributions from New 
Zealand and the United Kingdom and the level of contribution has 
now been agreed,'' McKinnon said. 
  He said Britain had already paid Australia and Wellington 
would do so shortly. 
  Nauru has not ruled out the possibility of taking separate 
action against London and Wellington, but if Tuesday's 
contribution is all the two countries now have to pay they will 
have done much better in the deal than Canberra did. 
  Given that the BPC was controlled by a representative each 
from the three powers, and its resources were shared, Australia 
could have asked for as much as 36 million dollars from both 
London and Wellington. 
  Nauru, a former German colony, was extensively mined by the 
BPC, in contravention of the League of Nations, and later United 
Nations, mandate. 
  BPC's operations were a state secret and details never 
revealed at the time. 
  It was both the buyer and seller of phosphate, rigging the 
price to subsidize farmers and publishing two sets of books -- 
one for the League and another secret set showing the real 
picture. 
  In preliminary pleadings to the ICJ in 1990 Australia 
objected to the court dealing with the case on the grounds of 
lack of jurisdiction, bad faith on Nauru's part, and failure to 
join New Zealand and Britain as parties. 
  Australia argued a full and final settlement was reached at 
the time of independence in 1968. 
  Although the colonial powers were committed to 
rehabilitation 
in law, nothing was done and 21 square kilometre (8.4 square 
mile) Nauru is largely a wasteland, its 9,600 people living on a 
narrow coastal strip.

  [Text] President Ramos took a direct hand in his 
administration's waste management program yesterday and created 
a top-level committee composed of six Cabinet secretaries to 
ensure the protection of the environment and the proper disposal 
of waste materials. 
  At the same time, the Chief Executive disclosed that the 
country received a total of $32.71 million worth of assistance 
from the European Community (EC) for 1994. The money will be 
used on projects that will protect the environment and preserve 
the country's natural resources. 
  The president's move was contained in Memorandum Circular 
(MC) No. 88 which reconstituted the Presidential Task Force on 
Waste Management to ensure effective implementation of its 
various programs and projects. 
  The new memorandum amended MC 39-A issued by then, President 
Corazon C. Aquino on 19 January 1988 which designated the 
Presidential Management Staff as the task force coordinator. 
  Under MC 88, President Ramos designated Environment and 
Natural Resources Secretary Angel Alcala as chairman, with 
Public Works and Highways Secretary Gregorio Vigilar, Health 
Secretary Juan Flavier, Economic Planning Secretary Cielito 
Habito, Trade Secretary Rizalino Navarro and Interior and Local 
Government Secretary Rafael Alunan III as members. 
  The reconstituted task force, the president said, will have 
the following modified functions and responsibilities: 
  -- Ensure the implementation of the Integrated National 
Solid 
Waste Management Systems Framework as approved for adoption 
during the Cabinet meeting on 19 October 1993; 
  -- Ensure the continuous coordination and compliance by 
concerned agencies on the matter as well as on the various 
policies and presidential directives issued on waste management; 
  -- Formulate and recommend to the president all policies 
pertinent to the framework plan; 
  -- Serve as policy and management board for the Project 
Management Office on Solid Waste Management created under 
Administrative Order No. 90; 
  -- Source the financial and technical requirements of the 
plan from appropriate entities; 
  -- Create the necessary Technical Working Groups/Committees 
to assist the task force in the plan's implementation; 
  -- Submit quarterly reports to the president; and 
  -- Perform other functions as maybe directed by the 
president. 
  President Ramos tasked the DENR [Department of Environment 
and Natural Resources] to provide technical and administrative 
support to the task force. 
  In a report to the president, National Economic and 
Development Authority (NEDA) Director General Cielito Habito 
said the EC assistance will go to the preservation of natural 
parks, integrated protected areas and industrial pollution 
abatement. 
  Aside from boosting the government's environmental 
protection 
program, the EC assistance for 1994 will enhance institutional 
linkages, investment promotion, agrarian reform implementation 
and coconut processing, Habito reported. 
  The Chief Executive was also informed that a high-level 
business conference is expected to be held in Europe in 
September or October this year. 
  ``This will explore possible business opportunities between 
the Philippines and EC countries. Hopefully, the conference 
will bear fruitful results in upgrading Philippine-EC trade 
relations,'' Habito said. 
  The EC infused a total of $75.37 million in the country last 
year which mostly financed rural development projects in Western 
Samar, Catanduanes, Aurora, Guimaras, Biliran, Bantayan, the 
Camotes and Pitogo. 
  The private sector also received grant financing for a 
packaging center and assistance to the computer software 
industry, which reflected greater private sector access to 
official development assistance,`` Habito said. 
  Habito also informed the president that the EC has expressed 
interest in initiating regular high level consultations to 
review pipeline projects as well as its ongoing projects. 
  The first consultation might be held this May, he said.

  [Text] Taipei, March 29 (CNA) -- Taiwan will send 
representatives to a United Nations-sponsored meeting on illicit 
trade and consumption of endangered animals schduled to be held 
in Beijing in May, a government official said Tuesday [29 March]. 
  ``We'll only attend the non-government organization (NGO) 
sessions of the UN's Convention on International Trade in 
Endangered Species (CITES),'' said Huang Ying-jay, a department 
chief at the Council of Agriculture (COA). 
  The NGO sessions are open to non-CITES members. Taiwan is 
not a member of the UN wildlife conservation organization. 
  The 16-18 May CITES meeting will focus on how to eliminate 
the use of bear bile in Chinese medicines, Huang said. Several 
bear species native to Asia face the threat of extinction. 
  ``We'll detail our conservation programs for indigenous 
Taiwan bears and other endangered wild animals at the NGO 
sessions,'' Huang explained. He added that Taiwan will not send 
representatives to a CITES meeting on illicit flora trade 
scheduled for 16-19 May in Mexico. 
  Taiwan for the first time attended the NGO essions held in 
Geneva earlier this month in connection with a CITES Standing 
Committee meeting. It also managed to escape immediate CITES 
trade sanctions for its alleged failure to stamp out tiger bone 
and rhino horn trade. 
  The UN organization agreed to give Taiwan more time to 
improve its wildlife conservation measures, and will decide 
whether to impose trade sanctions on Taiwan in November, when 
all CITES members will meet. 
  The United States has agreed to follow the CITES decision 
and 
wait for some time before deciding whether to retaliate against 
Taiwan in accordance with the [word indistinct] legislation 
meant to protect wildlife. 
  The U.S. has also asked Taiwan to send reports on its 
conservation programs for some Asian indigenous animals, 
including black bears and orangutans, before 25 April, the 
sources said.

  [Text] Taipei, March 30 (CNA) -- A senior Taiwan official 
Wednesday [30 March] urged the United States to make careful 
assessment before deciding whether to sanction Taiwan over 
wildlife conservation issues. 
  ``We hope the U.S. Government and private conservation 
organizations can acknowledge the progress we have made in 
wildlife conservation in recent years,'' said Vice Chairman Lin 
Shiang-nung of the Council of Agriculture (COA). 
  The Clinton administration is scheduled to decide in April 
whether to impose trade sanctions on Taiwan in accordance with 
the U.S. legislation meant to protect wildlife, known as the 
Pelly Amendments. 
  Some local media quoted COA sources as reporting Tuesday 
that 
the U.S. Government has agreed to follow a recent decision by a 
United Nations wildlife conservation organization to give Taiwan 
more time to improve its conservation measures before taking any 
punitive measures against Taiwan for its failure to stamp out 
its alleged tiger bone and rhino horn trade. 
  Lin, however, denied the reports, saying the council has not 
received any information about a final U.S. decision. ``I know 
nothing about whether the U.S. will follow the CITES [Convention 
on International Trade in Endangered Species] decision,'' he 
noted. 
  Nevertheless, Lin said he earnestly hopes America can take 
note of Taiwan's conservation efforts and technically assist 
Taiwan to eliminate illicit wildlife product trade. 
  ``We'll continue to crack down on illicit rhino horn and 
tiger bone trade and hope to cooperate with the U.S. in wildlife 
conservation,'' he added. 
  The UN's Convention on International Trade in Endangered 
Species (CITES) recently agreed to postpone a decision on 
whether to sanction Taiwan until November.

<F P=106> [By Bill Wang] </F>
  [Text] Washington, March 30 (CNA) -- The ROC [Republic of 
China] Government has reaffirmed its commitment to eradicating 
the trade in endangered species. The ROC representative's 
office in Washington said Wednesday [30 March] that the ROC 
Government shares the U.S. Government's commitment to 
eradicating the illegal wildlife trade, but believes dialogue 
and cooperation, rather than sanctions, are the best means of 
achieving progress toward this goal. 
  The office issued the statement in response to a news 
release 
sent out by Senator Jim Jeffords (R-VT.) in which the senator 
said that 25 senators and 13 representatives have joined him in 
forwarding a letter to President Bill Clinton asking him to 
consider taking limited trade sanctions against Taiwan and 
Mainland China for their continued illegal trade in rhino horn 
and tiger parts. 
  The office pointed out that the ROC Executive Yuan recently 
approved amendments to the Wildlife Conservation Law that would 
make trade in endangered species a crime punishable by prison 
terms up to five years and/or fines up to U.S. $60,000. 
  In addition, it added, prison terms for repeat offenders 
would be lengthened to as much as seven years, and the maximum 
fine would increase to approximately U.S. $100,000 under the 
amendments expected to be passed by the Legislative Yuan soon. 
  It said that the government has also been conducting 
island-wide crackdowns in Taiwan, involving undercover 
investigations on establishments selling traditional medicine. 
  It said that the efforts of the ROC Government were 
acknowledged at the meeting last week of the Standing Committee 
of the United Nations Convention on International Trade in 
Endangered Species (CITES). During the meeting, CITES decided 
that Taiwan should be given more time to implement wildlife 
conservation measures and postpone any decisions on sanctions to 
November. 
  Senator Jeffords also introduced legislation in the Senate 
calling for the setup of a fund to support conservation programs 
of nations whose activities affect rhino and tiger populations 
as well as automatic sanctions against nations violating 
endangered species laws.

<F P=106> [By Debbie Kuo] </F>
  [Text] Taipei April 1 (CNA) -- Premier Lien Chan Friday [1 
April] called United States threats to impose trade sanctions 
against Taiwan for failing to protect endangered species 
``unfair'' and ``regretful.'' 
  U.S. President Bill Clinton has yet to make a final decision 
on the sanctions, which are mandated under the Pelly amendment 
to the Fishermen's Protective Act of 1967. Any sanctions would 
go into effect 30 days after approval. 
  The ROC [Republic of China] Foreign Ministry confirmed that 
the U.S. National Security Council had forwarded to President 
Clinton a recommendation to sanction only Taiwan under the Pelly 
amendment. 
  Lien said it is unfair that the U.S. is seeking to 
selectively impose the sanctions, targeting only Taiwan and not 
Mainland China or South Korea. 
  The premier said the U.S. Government did not take into 
account wildlife conservation efforts made by Taiwan's 
government and people. 
  The U.S. has paid no attention to Taiwan's quick and 
effective reactions to comments and accusations from world 
conservation organizations, Lien said. 
  Lien added that Taiwan has done much more than many other 
governments and international groups in protecting endangered 
species. 
  Moreover, the government is currently expanding crackdowns 
on 
illegal trade in rhino horn, tiger parts and other endangered 
animals and species in addition to enacting a revised wildlife 
protection law and promoting Taiwan's efforts in the world 
community, Lien said. 
  He called for the people in Taiwan to correct their 
misguided 
ideas about the effects some endangered species have in curing 
diseases. ``Don't sacrifice the country's image for medical 
cures or gourmet food,'' Lien said. 
  Meanwhile, Sun Ming-hsien, chairman of the Council of 
Agriculture, said the U.S. is targeting Taiwan alone for trade 
sanctions despite a decision by the Convention on International 
Trade in Endangered Species (CITES) last week to postpone any 
decision on sanctions against Taiwan, Mainland China and South 
Korea until November. 
  He called U.S. threats against Taiwan a ``violation of 
international justice.'' 
  Sun said Taiwan will continuously and undauntedly 
communicate 
with the U.S., telling the Americans that Taiwan has done much 
more than Mainland China and South Korea in wildlife protection 
and conservation. 
  Sun (?said] that he has not ruled out resignation to take 
responsibility for the U.S. sanctions, (?if) approved.

  [Text] Prime Minister Chuan Likphai is in favour of setting 
up nuclear power plants, saying the growing demand for 
electricity will inevitably force Thailand to adopt the nuclear 
option. 
  ``Nuclear power is a sensitive issue and something very new 
for our country. People may not understand and accept it but we 
should not overlook it,'' he said. 
  Chuan presided over a seminar entitled ``Nuclear Power 
Plants,'' held at Parliament yesterday. He said nuclear power 
could not be rejected since it is a vital new resource for 
generating electricity. 
  He said nuclear power had been used elsewhere for more than 
20 years due to increasing demand for power worldwide. 
  Chuan said that 20 years ago, Thailand consumed only 1,000 
megawatts of electricity. This year, demand has risen to 9,800 
megawatts. 
  ``And in 15-20 years, demand will be 30,000 megawatts,'' he 
said. 
  At present, Thailand has to import electricity from Laos and 
natural gas from Malaysia, Vietnam and Burma. 
  Although there were many other fossil fuels for electricity 
generation, the world was concerned about their environmental 
impact. He quoted the greenhouse effect, and acid rain as 
examples of problems caused by the burning of fossil fuels. 
  ``The government is interested in nuclear power as one of a 
number of options for the future,'' he said. 
  He said he had instructed the Sciences Technology and 
Environment Ministry to amend the laws concerning nuclear power 
plants and to formulate an organizational structure to supervise 
the new industry. 
  ``Everything must comply with international standards. We 
want to be sure people will be safe and that it will not affect 
the environment,'' he said. 
  He stressed that public sentiment over the issue was the 
most 
important factor. 
  ``The government will study the positive and negative 
aspects 
of nuclear power plants. And we will pay prime attention to the 
public's feelings,'' he said. 
  The chairman of the House committee on energy, At-ong 
Chumsai 
na Ayutthaya, recently insisted on the need to build nuclear 
power plants and criticized an opposing conclusion reached by 
the House environment committee. 
  ``We have to select the best and safest system. Don't take 
bad examples which rely on one-sided information,'' he said. 
  A Phalang Tham (Bangkok) MP, At-ong said before deciding 
whether or not to build nuclear power plants, it is necessary to 
study the size of the country's remaining energy reserves. 
  ``We have to accept that the energy demand is rising. The 
consumption of electricity increases by 1,000 megawatts yearly.'' 
  ``We are not talking about a change which will happen today 
or tomorrow but we are focusing on the situation in 50 years, 
when other energy sources have already gone,'' he said.

  [Text] Seventeen percent of primary students in Ron Phibun 
district, Nakhon Si Thammarat province, suffer a form of skin 
cancer as a result of ingesting arsenic toxins in the local 
water, a Nakhon Si Thammarat provincial official said yesterday. 
  Eighty percent of all residents in Ron Phibun district and 
some residents in nearby districts have arsenic toxins in their 
bodies. 
  The official said local water supplies are polluted by 
arsenic in run-off from ancient tin mines. 
  Consumption of arsenic toxins results in an illness the 
villagers call Khai Dam, or black fever, and induces a kind of 
skin cancer which shows as black spots. A survey of 718 primary 
students showed 125 of them, or 17.4 percent, have black spots 
on their skin, according to the official. 
  The official said authorities on Tuesday had agreed to 
arrange new water sources for the villagers. 
  It was also planned to dig new water wells in Ron Phibun 
district and to educate villagers about black fever disease. 
  Dr. Chanphen Chupraphawan, from the Thai Public Health 
Research Institute, said providing clean, unpolluted water would 
be an effective way to prevent the spread of black fever. 
  Chanphen said within the next four years, teenagers in Ron 
Phibun will have an 80 percent risk of getting black fever, 
which could lead to cancer of the lung, kidney and liver.

  [Text] Thai Embassy officials in Washington expect the 
United States to link its decision to extend tax concessions to 
Thailand to environmental protection issues when the Generalized 
System of Preferences (GSP) agreement is reviewed in September. 
  A report from the embassy's commercial counsellor indicates 
that environmental issues are among general social issues likely 
to be considered in the review of the GSP for Thailand. 
  Addressing environmental issues through trade restrictions, 
however, has been opposed by some conservation groups such as 
Friends of the Earth, Greenpeace and the National Wildlife 
Foundation [as published], which argue that it was difficult to 
apply such pressure on trade. 
  The United States, the report noted is also likely to grant 
concessions to an additional 40 developing countries, especially 
from Africa. 
  Washington will further consider lowering the GSP's per 
capita income ceiling condition for some countries, as it feels 
the current set level is too high. 
  Meanwhile, the report said, U.S. importers have lobbied for 
higher levels of imported goods under the GSP programme, 
especially for the three most active sectors -- textiles, 
footwear and leather products. 
  But local producers of these products are strongly opposed 
to 
any increase, fearing an influx of cheap imports will hurt U.S. 
industries. 
  Washington has reduced import tariffs affecting U.S. $19.5 
trillion worth of goods under the GSP programme, cutting U.S. 
$500 million from the normal level. 
  Meanwhile, the European Union (EU) recently informed the 
Thai 
Commerce Ministry that it will announce new conditions for Union 
GSP privileges by 15 June. 
  The EU is considering new tax concessions for its GSP 
programme that will take into account the level of economic 
development of exporting countries as well as the level of per 
capita income. 
  The Foreign Trade Department expects the EU might cut the 
volume of Thai exports in some categories under its GSP 
programme. 
  Last year, Thai exporters took full advantage of the GSP 
programme in many sectors, including textiles and apparel, yarn 
and processed pineapple. 
  The European Union's new conditions for its GSP programme 
are 
expected to be introduced next year.

<F P=106> [Article by Katri Himma: ``Vietnam Is Conserving Its </F>
Forests; New Village Model May Reduce Slash and Burn of Mountain 
Forests''] 
  [Text] Hanoi -- Vietnam is rapidly opening its doors to a 
market economy. But unlike Thailand and Indonesia, Vietnam does 
not want that country's exceptionally fragile natural 
environment to pay the price for it. 
  They want tight supervision of the rapidly dwindling 
forests. 
Logging permits are restricted and scientists have recently 
found promising new ways of halting the rapid advance of erosion. 
  The size of Norway, mountainous Vietnam is losing over 
160,000 hectares a year of virgin forest. 
  While the forests are being threatened more and more with 
commercial logging, forest use by ordinary people is a basic 
problem, according to Vo Quyn, professor of forestry at Hanoi 
University. 
  Eighty percent of Vietnam's 70 million inhabitants still 
live 
in rural areas. Arable fields are in short supply. As the 
population grows, the slash-and-burn agriculture employed 
especially by the ethnic minorities that live in the mountain 
regions is becoming a problem. 
  Whereas after farming it for a few years, a cleared and 
burned field used to be left for at least 10 years to revert to 
forestland, now new farmers come to clear the land again within 
as little as 3-5 years because there is no other unoccupied land. 
  When forestland does not have time enough to properly 
reforest itself, erosion sets in. According to Prof. Quyn, 13 
million of Vietnam's total of 32 million hectares are already 
devastated because of erosion. 
<H5>  Pond in Center of Ecological Village </H5>
  Vo Quyn, who heads the Faculty of Natural Resources and 
Environmental Affairs at the University of Hanoi, is Vietnam's 
ecology veteran. After the Vietnam War, the country's forests 
were caught up in an ecological catastrophe. Seventy million 
liters of environmental toxins had been scattered over the land. 
  In the 1970's Prof. Vo Quyn set out in earnest to look for a 
village model that would get the aborigines, who were used to 
moving on [after exhausting a piece of land], to remain in their 
areas and work the forests and fields of the mountainous areas 
in an enduring manner. 
  After years of experiments and errors, Vo found the ideal 
village model. Fruit trees are planted near the house and 
fast-growing trees from which people get their firewood on the 
upper slopes. 
  Villagers can cultivate their own crops, tea, rice, and 
vegetables, between the forest stands. In the center of the 
village is the heart of the idea, a pond that produces water for 
both people and plants and guarantees fish for the villagers' 
tables. 
  ``The only way to get people to protect the environment they 
live in is to make it useful to them. People need food and 
money,'' Vo said. 
  Vo's model is now being applied in many provinces. Nearly as 
much new forest is being planted in these areas as is being 
logged. 
  In January the Vietnam National Assembly passed the 
country's 
first package of environmental laws. It contains strict rules 
according to which business firms are obligated to assess the 
impact of their operations on the environment and their use of 
natural resources. Prof. Vo, who participated in the drafting of 
these laws, is particularly pleased. 
  ``Now we have a foundation on which to base ourselves. While 
the new laws are not yet very detailed, they afford government 
officials the possibility of monitoring the use of natural 
resources better than they could before.'' 
  The laws are also of help in connection with Vietnam's 
latest 
environmental problem, the dumping of waste. At the start of the 
year, a Vietnamese food company asked customs officials for 
permission to import ``a 61-container lot of miscellaneous 
assorted plastic products'' into the country. 
  However, the shipment vanished and after only a few weeks 
the 
cargo was found in a suburban development near Ho Chi Minh: 
1,114 tons of dirty, used plastic bags. They had planned to burn 
the plastic waste or bury it. The officials, however, ordered 
the shipment to be sent back to its country of origin -- Germany.

<F P=106> [``Pool'' item] </F>
  [Text] Belgrade, April 6 (TANJUG) -- Foreign Minister of 
the Republic of Serb Krajina (RSK) Slobodan Jarcevic said on 
Wednesday in a letter to UN Secretary-General Butrus 
Butrus-Ghali that Croatia was depositing nuclear and toxic waste 
in western Slavonia, close to the border with the RSK. 
  The radioactive and toxic waste is being dumped on two 
locations on Mt. Papuk, Jarcevic specified. 
  Croatia drove out all Serbs from western Slavonia in 1991 in 
its war of secession from the former Yugoslav Federation. 
  Jarcevic said he wrote a letter last month to UN expert 
William Fenrick informing him about the hazard the dumps posed 
to the environment. The copy of the letter was sent to the 
office of the UN secretary-general. 
  In the letter addressed to Butrus-Ghali on Wednesday, whose 
copy was sent to TANJUG, Jarcevic expresses regret and 
puzzlement at not receiving a reply from the UN 
secretary-general, ``all the more so as the dumps pose danger 
not only to the people of the RSK but to UN troops deployed near 
the danger zone too.'' 
  The RSK was formed in 1991 in predominantly Serb-populated 
areas in Croatia in response to Croatia's violent secession from 
the former Yugoslav Federation and attempts to downgrade the 
Serbs to a national minority. 
  The RSK was placed under UN protection in March 1992 and 
14,000 UN peacekeepers are currently stationed there. 
  In his letter to the secretary-general, Jarcevic enclosed 
the 
topographical map of the two locations and roads leading to 
them, and insisted that the UN civilian police investigate the 
matter and report the findings to the Security Council.

<F P=106> [Interview with Sandor Papp, deputy chairman of Parliament's </F>
Environmental Protection Committee, by Janos K. Braz; place and 
date not given: ``Sandor Papp Views the State of Our 
Environmental Protection''] 
  [Text] 
  Braz: Hungary is the waste pipe in the Carpathian 
basin: Pollution and oil spills from the rivers of neighboring 
countries are flowing into Hungary, while the wind is carrying 
in acid rain. We asked Sandor Papp, deputy chairman of 
Parliament's Environmental Protection Committee, to comment on 
the consequences of all this on the state of Hungary's 
environment. 
  Papp: From the state's viewpoint, the most 
important issue is that more than 90 percent of surface waters 
and rivers flow into Hungary from neighboring countries. 
Therefore, we can also say that we are exposed to pollution 
originating from neighboring countries. This draws attention to 
a very important fact -- that the Carpathian basin is 
ecologically a uniform region. Therefore, we can only protect 
the environment if we develop adequate relations with 
neighboring countries to prevent damages. 
  Braz: What are these relations like at the moment? 
Are they insufficient, sufficient, or do they need improvement? 
  Papp: These relations cannot be described in one 
word. For example, our relations with Austria are good. We 
have certain problems with Slovakia, Ukraine, and Romania. For 
example, oil spills often flow into the Koros River from 
Romania, and we cannot pinpoint the origin of these spills. 
Another frequent case is when Hungarian experts try, and fail, 
to contact Romanian experts and, in such cases, irrespective of 
the size of the pollution, the issue automatically turns into a 
political issue because it is impossible to treat the subject 
differently. 
  Braz: How does the environmental state of 
individual countries affect Hungary's current economic and 
market restructuring? How does the appearance of foreign 
capital affect environmental protection? 
  Papp: An environmental debt and damage has 
accumulated in Hungary in the past two or three decades, and the 
size of this debt is approximately equivalent to Hungary's 
foreign debt -- namely $20-22 billion. This amount derives from 
the following calculation: Economic activity causes an 
environmental burden equivalent to 4-6 percent of the gross 
national product [GNP] annually, and we use 1 percent of the GNP 
for cleaning up the damage. It is obvious that one cannot 
eliminate this environmental damage overnight, even with the 
best law. We need a proper environmental law, but this is not a 
sufficient condition for mending our environment. This issue 
obviously affects the flow of foreign capital. However, foreign 
investors are primarily disturbed by the uncertain, unregulated, 
and unpredictable economic situation rather than by the 
well-defined tasks and environmental protection regulations. We 
know that the auditing of environmental tasks is also carried 
out in the process of privatization. Thus, it is possible to 
deduct the sums allocated to the elimination of environmental 
damages from the purchasing prices. One of the most negative 
examples is the Lehel Refrigeration company of Jaszbereny where 
the new owners discovered environmental damages on the premises 
after the purchase, and the elimination of these damages would 
have cost the equivalent of the factory's entire purchasing 
price. I would like to stress that foreign enterprises are most 
worried about the unregulated and unforeseeable economic 
situation rather than about the state of the environment.

    [Editorial Report] The following is a compilation of 
reports on environmental issues monitored through 31 March. 
  BOLIVIA 
  The Caballero Province Environmental Association, Acecab, is 
planning to plant 25,000 native trees to stop erosion in the 
Comarapa Valley. Acecab President Bendicto Vargas said the 35 
hectares of the Upper Comarapa River must be quickly reforested 
in the face of the excessive soil loss as a result of 
indiscriminate logging and natural erosion. (Santa Cruz EL MUNDO 
in Spanish 2 Mar 94 p 14) 
  BRAZIL 
  The Foreign Ministry will submit a request to the U.S. 
Government for a 30-day extension on the deadline established 
for Brazil to adopt an official position on the inclusion of 
mogno -- a Brazilian tree -- in Annex 2 of the Convention on the 
International Commerce of Endangered Wildlife and Flora Species. 
  A decision on mogno is on the agenda of the next meeting of 
the international tropical lumber organization council, of which 
Brazil is a member. (Brasilia Voz do Brasil in Portuguese 2200 
GMT 11 Mar 94) 
  Brazilian Institute for the Environment and Renewable 
Natural 
Resources, Ibama, workers found 30,000 cubic meters -- 15,000 
trees cut down illegally -- floating on the Purus River. The 
Ibama officials discovered that most of the trees had been taken 
from the Aripuana Indian reserve. A fine of 250 million real 
cruzeiros was imposed on the timber entrepreneurs, whose 
tugboats will be confiscated. Charges will be pressed against 
them with penalties as long as eight years in prison. (Rio de 
Janeiro REDE GLOBO Television in Portuguese 2300 GMT 21 Mar 94) 
  Ibama declared the Novo Destino rubber tree forest in 
Canutama County, Amazonas State, a private natural wealth 
reservation. The forest covers 104,000 hectares and is 20 times 
larger than the Caraguata forest reserve in Antonio Carlos 
County, Santa Catarina State. (Brasilia Voz do Brasil Network in 
Portuguese 2200 GMT 25 Mar 94) 
  PARAGUAY 
  Engineer Edgar Benitez and chemist Adelida Maldonado, two 
Agriculture and Livestock Ministry officials, carried out a 
surprise tour of the Chaco region, including Paratodo, Lolita, 
Loma Plata, and Filadelfia. In Loma Plata and Filadelfia, the 
officials seized 35 boxes of ``Guayaki,'' a poison against ants, 
worth 1.5 million guaranies. ``Guayaki'' contains 5 percent 
aldrin, a highly poisonous agrochemical. (Asuncion ABC COLOR in 
Spanish 28 Mar 94 p 36) 
  URUGUAY 
  According to a survey by the Economic Commission for Latin 
America, temperature increases in South America in December, 
January, and February might range from 2 degrees centigrade in 
the Amazon to 8 degrees centigrade in the Southern Cone. A 
4-degree increase might affect most regions with a high 
agricultural production rate, including Argentina, Brazil, 
Chile, Uruguay, and Paraguay. (Montevideo EL PAIS in Spanish 21 
Mar 94 p 10)

  [Text] DIPOS [expansion unknown] trustee Benjamin Garcia 
Posse has signed an agreement with the National Commission for 
Atomic Energy (CNEA) for the construction of a Sewage Waste 
Irradiation Plant (PIBA) [Planta de Irradiacion de Barros 
Cloacales]. The project will seek to solve the city's waste 
recycling problem, guaranteeing its rational, safe, economic, 
and harmless return to the environment. 
  CNEA will provide the funds, engineering, direction, 
construction, and installation for the plants, as well as the 
radioactive material (Cobalt 60) and the training of the 
personnel who will operate the plant. The plant's construction 
will be made to coincide with the construction of the Sewage 
Disposal Plant in San Felipe. 
  The contract was signed by Roberto Oscar Marques, CNEA 
radioisotopes and radiation area manager, on behalf of the 
atomic agency. Engineer Jorge Guillermo Graino also attended. 
During the ceremony at DIPOS, CNEA experts and officials 
exchanged ideas on the project. 
  The contract establishes that CNEA will intervene and 
supervise the installation's security as well as any operation 
involving the movement of radioactive materials inside and 
outside of the plant. 
  Operation periods will not exceed 10 years. In the 11th year 
the ownership of PIBA will be transferred to DIPOS. 
  The treatment consists of forcing the ``sludge'' around a 
cobalt-60 radioactive source carrier installed in an irradiator, 
which is a bunker built eight meters underground with concrete 
walls 1.4 meters thick acting as armor against radiation. 
  Once the sludge is pasteurized it will go into a tank for 
bacteriological and radiation control. Here routine controls 
will check whether the sludge is harmless.

  [Text] The European Economic Community (EEC) and the 
British Government will support the Ministry of the Environment 
and Natural Resources (MARENA) in a series of major projects to 
control and take pressure off the advancing agricultural 
frontier in our country. 
  Through CADESCA, the Central American Program for the 
Stabilization of the Agricultural Frontier, the EEC will support 
the ministry by promoting a development project that will ease 
the pressure on the agricultural frontier in the Bosawas area. 
  To this end, MARENA officials submitted a proposal for the 
Bosawas region in which they identified the areas to be 
monitored. They are the basin of the Bocay River, including 
mestizo communities, the development area in what used to be 
Resistencia de Ayapal, and the Sumo communities in this 
800-square kilometer zone. 
  The project will help support the communities in awarding 
land titles. 
  The British Government will be supporting MARENA by using 
satellite photography to determine the advance of the 
agricultural frontier. 
  Although an agreement has not yet been signed with the 
British Government, the head of MARENA, Dr. Jaime Incer, 
indicated that Nicaragua may have access to the service this 
year. 
  The issue arose during a visit by the British ambassador, 
who 
was impressed by the amount of information handled by MARENA's 
forest inventory center, Incer said. 
  The project will furnish regular satellite photographs of 
Nicaragua, showing where forests have been burned, where trees 
are being planted, etc.

  [Text] If the Primorye territorial administration decides 
to dump radioactive wastes into the Pacific, it will grossly 
violate the law on nature conservation, head of the State Atomic 
Inspection Committee's department for the radioactive security 
of defense facilities, Nikolay Shapovalenko, told Interfax. 
  A representative of the Primorye administration announced 
last Thursday that liquid radioactive waste might be dumped into 
the sea, given the critical condition of the TNT-5 and TNT-27 
storage ships. 
  To quote Shapovalenko, a mobile rectification system with a 
handling capacity of 0.5 cubic meters per hour is to be built in 
the Far East. 
  After such a system is put into operation, a stationary 
facility with a handling capacity of 2.5 cubic meters per hour 
will be built. Besides that, an enterprise manufacturing 
sorbents is to be built in the Far East. 
  Shapovalenko also said that 114 billion rubles will have to 
be spent on solving the problem of liquid radioactive wastes in 
the Primorye Territory. However, the government has not 
allocated anything to it so far. 
  The know-how which has been proposed by Japan and which the 
local administration would like to have consumes almost 100 
times more energy and will require an investment of about $50 
million, said Shapovalenko. 
  The Maritime Territory is experiencing a dire shortage of 
energy. Meanwhile, if the Japanese project is accepted, a 
thermal electric power plant costing nearly as much as the 
entire rectification facility, will have to be built. 
  Moreover, Russia will be entirely dependent on the Japanese 
suppliers. 
  According to the State Atomic Inspection Committee, the 
condition of the TNT-5 ship, built back in 1960, is particularly 
serious. This tanker was to be written off in 1992, but to this 
day it stores 400 cubic meters of low-level liquid radioactive 
wastes. ``It may sink any moment right at the moorage,'' said 
Shapovalov.

  [Text] Some of Moscow's industrial enterprises dealing with 
radioactive materials do not pass all of the radioactive waste 
to the Radon processing amalgamation. As a result, there are 
about 70 places contaminated with radioactive substances on the 
premises of Moscow's enterprises and even in the vicinity of 
apartment blocks, the Moscow Environmental Protection Committee 
told Interfax. Almost all of them have been eliminated by now, 
except 18 storages of low-radioactive waste in Krylatskoye, 
Lyublino, Strogino and some other districts. 
  The Moscow Environmental Protection Committee believes that 
as such these sites pose no threat to the population. But 
before building housing on them decontamination measures must be 
taken. The decontamination of one of such site, 26 kilometers 
from Moscow, is being completed. 
  The same source reports that there are more than 1,500 
enterprises and organizations in Moscow which use nuclear 
reactors, radioactive materials and products. 
  The worst danger is coming from 769 enterprises which create 
radioactive waste. In 1993, radiation control inspectors 
revealed 288 instances of violation of safety rules. 
  The Moscow Environmental Protection Committee announced that 
on the whole, Moscow's radiation level is light and measures 7 
to 14 microroentgen per hour.

<F P=106> [Article by Aleksandr Vasilyev under the heading </F>
``Aspects'': ``An Invisible Chernobyl -- Created by Nature 
Itself''] 
  [Text] Everyone is arguing about ``radiation.'' But the 
manmade danger is just one part of the problem. People talk and 
write much less frequently, more quietly and less clearly about 
the other part -- the fact that natural sources of ionizing 
radiation account for approximately 70 percent of the total 
radiation to which people are exposed. 
  That comparisons between Chernobyl and the radioactive 
effects of natural radiation sources are not exaggerated is 
demonstrated by the fact that the collective radiation to which 
Russia's population is exposed from natural sources is 300 times 
greater than radiation exposure resulting from the Chernobyl 
accident. The greatest ``contribution'' is made by radon and 
products of its decay found in the air inside buildings. 
According to a preliminary estimate, approximately 1.5 million 
Russians are exposed to 0.6-1.2 rems per year. That means that 
the bulk of expected medical effects from radiation among the 
public does in fact stem from natural sources. The annual death 
rate from this factor may be as high as 25,000. 
  There is no way that this issue can be viewed either as 
unexpected or as a recent discovery. In 1970, almost a quarter 
of a century ago, a major series of studies was completed on the 
presence of naturally-occurring radionuclides in building 
materials, resulting in the establishment of appropriate 
construction standards. True, studies of the radiation level at 
non-uranium mines and in miners' settlements were conducted 
irregularly and unsystematically. It was during this period that 
Kazakhstan discovered a unique miners' settlement -- a ``radon 
city'' -- where 90 percent of the housing showed dangerous 
levels of radon. Out of a total of 150 non-uranium mines, more 
than 100 had dangerous radon levels, and radiation exposure at 
those enterprises sometimes exceeded levels permissible for 
uranium mines. It was also discovered that employees of 
enterprises that refine minerals are also exposed to radiation 
from natural sources. The radiation level in oil- and 
gas-producing areas was also far above normal. For example, in 
Stavropol Kray a study of a drilling pipe warehouse indicated a 
radiation level there of up to 200 microroentgens per hour. The 
culprit was accumulation of radium salts inside the pipe. 
  In short, experts have long understood the significance of 
this problem. Particularly since they had before them examples 
of successful solutions to the problem in the West, where jobs 
of this nature have been performed in compliance with national 
and governmental programs since the mid-1970's. For example, in 
1984 the United States allocated $13 million from the federal 
budget and $600 million from state budgets for research in this 
area. 
  Our program, which has been repeatedly discussed at every 
level since 1987, both by the government and by parliament, was 
clearly born under an unlucky star. Nothing seemed to help, 
neither the five government directives signed by vice-prime 
ministers nor support from the Supreme Ecological Council. But 
the height of misfortune came with the two attempts to bring the 
program up for discussion, first in the USSR Supreme Soviet and 
then in the Russian Federation Supreme Soviet. The first attempt 
was made in late August 1991, the second in October 1993. One 
would have to believe that the Radon Program is truly jinxed. 
  It was only recently that a session of the government's 
commission on the environment and natural resource use approved 
the program, which will soon be submitted to the government for 
confirmation. Bearing the past in mind, one should not jump to 
any conclusions and predict a rosy future for the program. But 
neither should it be said that it would be all that difficult to 
implement. In any event, its cost -- R4.0 billion [rubles] in 
1992 prices -- is two orders of magnitude lower than the error 
made in calculating the Russian State Budget. 
  The first part of the Radon Program envisions selective 
radon 
safety studies of radiation levels in various regions of Russia 
and identification of high-risk groups. The problem is that 
radon levels in buildings are not constant. Therefore long-term 
measurements must be taken in each building. It would take 
thousands of years to study all the housing in Russia. Detailed 
and comprehensive studies are planned only for regions where 
radon presents a threat. According to preliminary estimates, 40 
percent of populated areas could have dangerously high radon 
levels. 
  A radiation-based, geological and chemical classification of 
Russia's territory by degree of potential hazard from 
naturally-occurring radionuclides will make it possible to 
identify areas with varying degrees of hazard and choose 
priority areas for accelerated environmental radiation studies. 
The program's designers envision that by 1995 Russia will have a 
map showing regions of increased radon hazard and will have 
developed the formulas and technologies for the manufacture and 
use of insulating building materials as well as a system of 
radiation monitoring for use during construction, will have 
taken steps to reduce radionuclide emissions by coal-burning 
heat-and-electric-power stations and reduce irradiation of mine 
workers, and will have obtained data on lung cancer rates among 
the populations of areas with increased radon hazard levels 
(according to UN data approximately 20 percent of all lung 
cancer is caused by the effects of radon and products of its 
decay). 
  This is precisely what places like Vyborg, Krasnokamensk and 
Pyatigorsk need to end this quiet, invisible but equally 
terrible natural Chernobyl.

<F P=106> [Article by Fedor Orlov: ``Leading the Whole Planet -- Tens </F>
of Thousands of Pesticides: Lots, Even for a Big Country''] 
  [Text] God willing, soon there will be yet another program 
to alleviate the effects of our ill-conceived efforts to wrest 
from nature more than it can or will give. In this case the time 
factor is particularly important, because at issue are 
pesticides, for which the season of massive use is fast 
approaching. When using the word ``massive'' one should not only 
bear in mind the tonnage involved but also the array of this 
type of agricultural chemical that exists -- the list of 
permitted pesticides contains over 500 names, but in reality, 
counting all the possible combinations, the number is in the 
tens of thousands. This wide choice, like its legalized status, 
definitely does not please either ecologists or farmers. 
Evidence of this were the heated discussions that occurred at 
two board meetings of the Ministry of Environmental Protection 
and Natural Resources, even though the professionals gathered 
there are usually pretty much unfazed by (as the ``green'' press 
likes to phrase it) the latest evidence of ecocide. 
  One thing remains quite clear: a negative situation with 
regard to this super-toxin can be found in a majority of 
Russia's regions. However, it is difficult to say anything 
specific about each oblast -- of the 206 functioning analysis 
offices only 24 are capable of monitoring pesticides in the 
soil, and only 30 can monitor pesticides in water. 
  A Russian State Committee for Hydrometeorology soil study 
done in 17 krays and oblasts found that soils were most polluted 
in forests (37-52 percent of area) and in cropland used to grow 
vegetables (18 percent) and grains (11 percent). The most 
pesticides are applied in Krasnodar and Stavropol krays and in 
Voronezh, Kursk, Ryazan, Moscow and Nizhegorod oblasts. In terms 
of environmental effects the situation is worst in the Northern 
Caucasus, Rostov Oblast, the upper and middle Volga regions, 
Maritime Kray, the area around Moscow and Chelyabinsk and Kurgan 
oblasts. 
  It is not only soils that are polluted: according to data 
from regional environmental protection agencies, in 1992 alone 
there were 994 cases in which bodies of water were poisoned. As 
a result, the Russian Federation Committee on Fishing recorded 
massive fish kills in the watersheds of the Volga River and the 
Sea of Azov. Pesticide runoff from adjacent fields into the 
Mechetka River (Rostov Oblast) killed as many as two million 
pike, carp, knottyhead and perch. A total of 84,000 fish died in 
the Anna River, which flows into Cheboksary Reservoir, as a 
result of hops cultivation along the river's banks. 
  Insects are of course harmed by pesticides, but not just the 
harmful ones. For example, in Bryansk and Ryazan oblasts there 
have been instances of large number of bees being killed, 
resulting in a sharp drop in the yield of crops pollinated by 
them. 
  The reason for the deadly effects of agricultural chemicals 
is not only their excessive use, but also a lack of modern 
equipment and insufficient knowledge about equipment servicing 
and chemical storage. According to available statistics, 52 
percent of storage facilities do not meet environmental 
protection requirements. In a majority of cases that 
classification means that chemicals are stored virtually out in 
the open. 
  As for equipment service, as a rule little time is wasted on 
that --equipment is sent directly out to the fields, loaded 
there and washed out there without ever being properly 
decontaminated. 
  In addition to all this, the Ministry of Agriculture finds 
itself the owner of 100,000 tonnes of unusable pesticides. No 
one knows how to destroy them safely, and the problem is a heavy 
burden on the Waste Program. 
  The whole grim list of Russia's pesticide users should 
immediately suggest some obvious conclusions: firstly, creation 
of an adequate map of pesticide usage distribution, particularly 
since the most likely sites can already be predicted. Secondly, 
establishment of an effective system for monitoring the storage 
and efficient use of pesticides. Thirdly, provision of an 
effective legislative foundation that will require violators to 
take responsibility for eliminating damages caused by them, if 
only by paying for recovery efforts. And, finally, a fundamental 
answer to the question of why we need such a vast array of 
pesticides, a number out of proportion even to the rich palette 
of our immense country's natural conditions. But accomplishing 
all this will be a truly monumental task.

<F P=106> [Article by Andrey Illarionov: ``The Sturgeon Were the First </F>
To Die''] 
  [Text] Can an ``environmentally uneducated'' individual 
foresee something that science cannot or will not predict? 
  I recall how alarmed natives of the Volga region became when 
construction began on the huge Volga hydroelectric power 
stations. And even though one heated conversation about it was 
enough for one to wind up with the other convicts building the 
``great Stalinist construction projects,'' the prophets would 
not be quiet. 
  ``How will we live without the floodplain? It feeds us,'' 
said one. 
  ``How will the Astrakhan herring reach their spawning 
grounds 
through a dam?'' asked another in despair. 
  ``Ah, the fish will go around the dams on fish ladders,'' I 
recall my father retorting, mimicking a lecturer from the State 
Committee for Hydraulic Projects. 
  These fighters for truth, willing to be crucified for the 
Volga, were not just fed by the great river. As native-born 
Volgans they could not imagine life without it. And the way they 
lived their lives included a certain degree of spontaneous 
environmental consciousness. 
  Their worst fears have been confirmed. The changes began 
with 
the most valuable fish species of all: the sterlet and the 
sturgeon for which that stretch of the river was famed did not 
like the stagnant water of the Volga ``seas.'' Also gone were 
the lampreys, which we were sure were the finest delicacy in the 
world. Then the less-finicky bream, pike perch and catfish 
became rarities. Then, like visions from a nightmare, tiny 
bullheads with misshapen heads and half a body began to appear. 
  But even worse than those visions was the kilometers-long 
strip of rotting, stinking fish that lined the riverbank. Yet 
that was not the end of the grim effects of the Volga's version 
of natural dialectics. V. Osipov, director of Khvalynsk Forestry 
Kolkhoz and a person very familiar with the area, has often 
shown me places where the pines are turning a sickly yellow and 
the aspens lose their leaves in the middle of the summer, where 
oaks in their prime are drying up. And there has been no 
significant honey harvest from the linden trees for a decade now. 
  This damage is not limited to the Saratov Reservoir and its 
surrounding area. The greater portion of the Volga region is 
suffering. A fellow villager of mine, now deputy chief of the 
rayon administration, asks: ``Who is going to pay for these 
damages? Who will save the Volga, and how?'' To find an answer 
to those questions I took a trip to the city of Tolyatti, where 
I visited the Russian Academy of Sciences Institute of Volga 
Watershed Ecology. 
  The institute has been in existence for 10 years, and it has 
research vessels that ply the expanses of the Volga ``seas,'' 
stations on picturesque shores and laboratories in Tolyatti and 
several other cities. In recent years it has published several 
very useful monographs on the logic of development of human 
works -- the reservoirs -- and a portion of the great river's 
natural environment. And, remarkably in these times, against a 
backdrop of general impoverishment in the sciences the institute 
is holding a steadier course than some more famous academic 
institutions. 
  What did I hear there? Regarding the death of fish in the 
Volga I got a complete answer: this is due to the reckless 
pollution of the river, a slowdown in the reservoirs' 
self-cleansing capacity and a deadly ``bloom'' of blue-green 
algae. Our discussion of problems in the Khvalynsk Forest was 
limited to broad conjectures, as those I spoke with, the 
institute's directors, did not indicate any familiarity with the 
forest or any particular interest in its fate. Yet the Khvalynsk 
upland forest is an ecologists' treasure -- a surviving island 
of ancient forest that spread hundreds of kilometers south of 
the usual forest boundary 500 years ago or more. It comes to the 
Volga's environmental crisis with a tremendous amount of 
survival ``experience.'' The presence there of pines that have 
miraculously survived from the Cretaceous Period -- the 
ancestors of today's pines -- should alone be enough to excite 
keen scientific interest. But it has not... 
  Of course, the institute, which is modest in size and fairly 
limited in its scientific scope, is not yet capable of 
monitoring and providing ongoing assessment of environmental 
changes in a region with an area of 1.3 million square 
kilometers. But I believe the institute's problem is that as a 
scientific institution it has been too slow in undertaking the 
expected large-scale research. ``It is cause for bitter regret 
that in all these years the institute,'' self-critically 
acknowledged Gennadiy Rozenberg, its director and a doctor of 
biological sciences, ``has not acquired an ichthyological 
environmental laboratory, without which we are unable to study 
all the problems of Volga fish or develop all possible measures 
to help them survive.'' 
  Almost half of the Volga watershed is covered with forest, 
and everyone knows that the Volga and its tributaries flow out 
of forests. And if the forests retreat, the Volga will also 
retreat, and desert will replace it. That means the institution 
should have a forest ecology laboratory. But right now that does 
not seem to be the accepted wisdom. 
  So how can the Volga be saved? If by some miracle the 
100,000 
sources of toxic discharges into it were shut off, even that 
would not save the great river. The underlying problem -- the 
gigantic dams -- would still be there, and the livelihood of the 
Volga's people has long since become closely linked to them. 
  ``If only we could regulate the Volga's flow so that it 
would 
facilitate self-cleansing and protect the fishing industry's 
interests,'' was one fine idea put forward by the institute's 
director. And even though river flow is dictated by the very 
pressing need to generate as much electric power as possible, 
why is the institute not attempting to model the process, or at 
least its most general parameters? Just to know what the first 
step toward saving the river will cost. 
  As for the individual but on the whole equally important 
issues pertaining to the survival of nature on land in the Volga 
watershed, they depend to a greater extent on local efforts. 
And, thank God, there are people of action among those who live 
along the Volga. V. Osipov, who holds the title ``distinguished 
forester of Russia,'' has been planting Siberian larch in the 
Khvalynsk Forest for many years. There, far from its home, it is 
adapting splendidly, growing quickly and avoiding the diseases 
that are typical of it in Siberia. Thus it has been possible to 
compensate in part for the loss of other valuable species unable 
to stand the environmental strain. 
  A positive environmental initiative, is it not? However, at 
the institute in Tolyatti a laboratory head offhandedly and 
decisively expressed his opposition to the idea, asking how the 
larch-produced bactericides, fungicides and protozoacides might 
affect their environment. I dared object to that scientist that 
since for two decades now the plantings have produced only 
positive results, it might be possible to visit the area, study 
it carefully and then support and recommend expansion of the 
experiment... But this local scientist was not interested in the 
larch growing nearby on the banks of the Volga. So I turned to 
academician Aleksandr Isayev, director of the International 
Forest Institute in Moscow. He termed the Khvalynsk Forestry 
Kolkhoz's experiment not only interesting, but very promising. 
That is because the larch, which is very resistant to chemical 
pollution, also tolerates other trees, shrubs and grasses in its 
vicinity... 
  I am not debating a specific point -- this is a matter of 
attitude. The institute condemns the ``excessive enthusiasm of 
some neophytes to improve the state of the environment though 
they lack professionalism...'' End of discussion. In this 
connection academician Vlail Kaznachayev recently said to me: 
people out in the field, with their great wealth of experience 
when it comes to the survival of the environment, seldom win 
arguments with scientists... 
  At the institute attempts to establish regional programs to 
save the Volga are sarcastically termed ``the landslide 
process.'' That assessment probably does contain an element of 
truth, but the whole problem is that while scientists are making 
fun of efforts to save the Volga and developing a theory -- 
discovering the mechanism by which ecological laws operate -- 
the degradation process is gathering speed and becoming, to use 
a currently fashionable word, irreversible. 
  Should it come as any surprise that the local Green movement 
is very suspicious of the aforementioned institute? And there 
are a great many environmentally unschooled people along the 
Volga who have no idea that the Institute for Volga Watershed 
Ecology even exists... Oh, if only all these as yet isolated 
forces could come together! If science and folk wisdom could 
join hands... Wishes are not enough to bring about such an 
environmental alliance of the Volga people's efforts -- what is 
needed is massive, systematic coordination of research and 
practical efforts by academic and ministerial institutes, 
environmental monitoring and protection agencies, enterprises in 
industry, agriculture and forestry and public movements. 
  Who can coordinate efforts to save the Volga? The Institute 
for Volga Watershed Ecology, or perhaps some other governmental 
institution? It is easier to ask than it is to answer... The 
responsibility is just too great.

<F P=106> [Unattributed article: ``Billions for Ecology''] </F>
  [Text] Russia has developed a program called 
``Conversion-Ecology.'' The urgent need for such a program stems 
from the worsening environmental situation coupled with the 
virtual absence of an independent sector in this country 
oriented toward the development and manufacture of environmental 
products, as well as the fact that the task is truly complex. 
Using the intellectual and scientific-technical potential and 
production capacity of the defense complex to solve 
environmental safety problems by providing comprehensive 
environmental monitoring, creating new environmentally safe 
technologies and improving means of processing industrial and 
household wastes will help make that task manageable. 
  The program envisions involvement by more than 90 research 
and planning organizations under the Russian Federation 
Committee on the Defense Industry. 
  According to 1993, estimates, the cost of the program will 
be 
R54.28 billion [rubles]. 
  Funding will come from the republic budget, investment and 
conversion credits, capital investment, foreign investment, 
customers' own funds and other off-budget allocations. 
  Implementation of the program is expected to take three 
years. 
  The program will include the development and production of 
new technologies and means of cleaning up exhaust gases and 
waste water and of processing, neutralizing and reusing solid 
waste; measurement and information systems for background 
monitoring of the state of the environment, and systems to 
monitor pollution sources; and environmentally safe and 
resource- and energy-conserving technologies and types of 
production. 
  The ``Conversion-Ecology'' program will be coordinated by 
the 
Russian Federation Ministry of Environmental Protection and 
Natural Resources.

  [Text] Petropavlovsk-Kamchatskiy -- The Maritime Kray 
interdepartmental commission to monitor the observance of 
radiation safety norms has deemed it expedient to dump liquid 
radioactive waste from the TNT-5 tanker in designated areas in 
the Sea of Japan in May. The commission checked the condition 
of the two tankers where liquid radioactive waste from the 
Pacific Fleet is stored and established a worsening in the 
radiological situation at the place of their anchorage in the 
Bolshoy Kamen Bay. The commission is especially concerned by 
the TNT-5 tanker, which is in critical condition after a repeat 
winter storage of liquid radioactive waste aboard it. The 
integrity of the tanker's drainage, pipe, and valve systems has 
been disrupted.

<F P=106> [Review by Dmitriy Frolov of the book by Viktor </F>
Danilov-Danilyan, Viktor Gorshkov, Yuriy Arskiy, and Kim Losev, 
``The Environment Between the Past and Future: The World and 
Russia'': ``Complexes Helped No One. The Ecological Situation in 
Russia: Another Perspective''] 
  [Text] On Tuesday, 15 March, at the Russian-American press 
center there was a presentation of the book by Viktor 
Danilov-Danilyan, Viktor Gorshkov, Yuriy Arskiy, and Kim Losev, 
``The Environment Between the Past and Future: The World and 
Russia.'' In the words of the chief of the press service of the 
Ministry of Environmental Protection and Natural Resources, 
Aleksandr Shuvalov, the book marks a kind of stage in the 
understanding of ecological problems. One must assume that such 
a strong expression was used by no means because the current 
leader of the Ministry of Environmental Protection and Natural 
Resources was among the authors--a fact that is important in and 
of itself,. since it means that we have before us more than 
simply the opinion of a group of researchers. The book really 
does make a great impression, and this is certainly not achieved 
because it contains another round of apocalyptic predictions. 
Rather, on the contrary, attention is drawn to the absence of 
alarmism and, which is always curious, an attempt to reinterpret 
the current stereotypical ideas. 
  The most persistent of them is the certainty that 
ecologically Russia is almost the worst place in the world. Upon 
checking, it turns out that this is not altogether true and in 
the majority of cases not even true at all. 
  For example, indicators of degradation of the land in 
Russia, 
which has 8 percent of the land in the world, are close to 
average. The same thing can be said about degradation of 
forestry systems. And Russia has almost 45 percent of the 
nontropical forests and 27 percent of the world's supply of wood. 
  The total discharges of atmospheric pollutants amount to 
6-12 
percent of the average world level. Our contribution to the 
production of chlorofluorocarbons which destroy the ozone layer 
was about 10 percent. In the meantime, the United States, 
Western Europe, and Japan together produce 73 percent of them. 
Moreover, Russia has preserved the largest area of land 
undisturbed by economic activity--scientists think that it could 
play approximately the same role as the entire Brazilian part of 
the Amazon region in stabilizing the environment. 
  Paradoxical as it may sound now, all the credit for the fact 
that we have managed to preserve Russian nature to one degree or 
another belongs to the centralized controlled economy, which is 
usually reproached for chronic neglect of the environment. There 
is no contradiction here in the strict sense of the word, since 
nobody has yet managed to abolish that notorious unity and 
struggle of opposites. Economic ineffectiveness and the 
sluggishness of the centralized system plus the difficulty of 
access and the harsh climate of the expanses of the northern 
part of Siberia and the Far East have forced us to concentrate 
our attention on already assimilated territories and make 
significant capital investments in so-called national regions. 
As a result, the ecosystems of the latter have been practically 
completely deformed. As for the industrial revolution on the 
``old land,'' the fact that 70 percent of the gross national 
product belongs to the defense complex is not the only result of 
this. In terms of the indicator of expenditure of resources and 
the quantity of pollutants per unit of gross national product, 
Russia has outstripped all developed countries. According to 
various estimates, losses because of damage to the environment 
in the former Union amounted to from 15 to 20 percent of the GNP 
annually. To this one should add the ``deferred'' damage, which 
has been caused, is being caused, and will be caused by wastes, 
mainly radioactive ones, that have been discharged in mass 
quantities into the environment because of the use of 
technologies that are imperfect but cheap and therefore 
attractive for the moment. 
  Researchers single out three stages in the offensive against 
the environment: virgin land, the age of the Ministry of Water 
Management, which caused the Aral crisis, and large-scale 
activity for prospecting and extracting oil and gas in the 
northern part of Western Siberia. The first and last dealt a 
blow to Russia itself, and, while the consequences of plowing 
over the virgin land are known, one can only guess at the damage 
to the ecosystems of the North. 
  In the meantime, the authors warn that a market economy, 
being a more effective mechanism than a centralized one, in 
principle is capable of causing more harm to the environment as 
well. Even now, both private and investment capital are being 
used for further development of resources and assimilation of 
new territories, whether it be in the petroleum and gas fields 
of the Barents Sea, on the Sakhalin Shelf, in Khanti-Mansia and 
Yamalia, or the felling of forests from Europe to the Far East. 
  Of course, in such cases one comes to expect formulas, and 
the authors try to satisfy this expectation. This might be a 
purely subjective impression, but, unfortunately, the 
satisfaction is not forthcoming. The declaration of the need to 
take others' mistakes into account (they have in mind the 
syndrome of plundering nature, which practically all developed 
countries have experienced in the past) and the appeal to the 
country's leaders to invest capital in science-intensive energy- 
and resource-saving technologies--all these are nothing more 
than good wishes. And references to the scenario for the 
development of Japan and Germany in recent years and even the 
``small dragons'' of Southeast Asia are not very convincing. 
Perhaps the social pessimism that has become a complex is to 
blame for this. 
  It seems that the authors of the book invested their 
emotions 
(to the degree to which they can exist at all in a scientific 
study) in destroying this complex. In terms of impact on the 
environment, we descendants of a centrally controlled system are 
in no way worse (but not better, either) than societies 
developing according to the market scenario. Now, while cleaning 
up their local territories, they are ``consuming'' or prepared 
to ``consume'' the environment of the countries where it still 
remains. In essence this is a policy of ``sweeping the dirt 
under the rug.'' The mechanism for competition was not conceived 
by man but was used by the biota and served as a stabilizing 
factor for it. From all appearances, the biota has mechanisms 
adequate to crowd out species that threaten its existence. 
Mankind has a chance to test this--the life span of a species 
averages 10 million years, but Homo sapiens, having prepared 
everything for its own destruction, has existed for only several 
tens of thousands of years. 
  As for Russians, they can only think globally and act 
locally, and even now try both to acquire capitalism and to 
protect the environment. Minister of the Environment Viktor 
Danilov-Danilyan will share his opinion on how to do this in 
practice in one of the next issues of SEGODNYA.

<F P=106> [Article by journalist Natalya Ostrovskaya: ``Temptation by </F>
the Dollar: Why the Administration of Maritime Kray Is Turning 
Its Back on an Effective Domestic Project for Purification of 
Radioactive Waste''] 
  [Text] The scientific-research vessel Okean of the 
Far Eastern Institute of Hydrometeorology has left Vladivostok 
for Niigata (Japan) and subsequently the South Korean port of 
Tomhe. 
  IZVESTIYA reported on this joint Russian-Japanese-South 
Korean expedition to study radioactive contamination of certain 
regions in the Sea of Japan as long as two months ago. However, 
the date of putting out to sea was repeatedly postponed. 
Finally, everything was decided and coordinated. Most 
importantly, there is money, $540,000 from Japan, which is 
alarmed over its ecological security. 
  Chemical specialists of the Pacific Fleet and scientists 
from 
the institutes of the Academy of Sciences in Vladivostok shrug 
their shoulders in bewilderment when it comes to this official 
alarm. The total radioactivity of last year's dumping of liquid 
radioactive waste (ZhRO) in the so-called region No. 9 of the 
Sea of Japan, which has gained scandalous notoriety throughout 
the world, was 0.37 curies--that is all! This is insignificantly 
little even according to relevant international norms. 
  Meanwhile, the actual, visible, and palpable problem abides 
in Vladivostok's backyard, in the city of Bolshoy Kamen, rather 
than on the free expanse of the sea. For half a year the 
Maritime area has had a delayed-radioactive action mine there, 
at the Zvezda defense plant, through the efforts of the Russian 
and Japanese Governments. These are two old special tankers of 
the navy, the TNT-5 and the TNT-27 with 2,000 cubic meters of 
``liquid radiation'' on board. One of them has been 
decommissioned and moored for two years now. The second, moving 
with assistance from a tugboat, quietly transported liquid 
radioactive waste to the ill-fated region No. 9 before the ban. 
  As quite competent sources inform us, the decommissioned 
TNT-5 lost air-tightness as long as a year ago because of its 
rundown and unfit condition. However, this is not at all to say 
that radioactive wash from its tanks leaks right into the bay. 
Everything is exactly the other way around: According to the 
laws of physics, outside water seeps into the tanks of the ship. 
What is the danger of this? The spontaneous sinking of the old 
tub. 
  It is hard to say how many Japanese companies and 
corporations proposing their own projects for solving the 
problem of liquid radioactive waste have visited Vladivostok in 
recent months. They are undertaking to erect a complex for waste 
processing in Bolshoy Kamen with money from the Government of 
Japan. As the saying goes, with God's help, and the sooner the 
better, before the TNT-5 sinks to the bottom. However, what will 
the common Maritime area taxpayer say about this once he learns 
what the yearly operation of such a shore complex would cost? 
  According to calculations by scientists of the Far Eastern 
Division of the RAN [Russian Academy of Sciences], this will be 
quite an impressive sum. The complex is extremely 
energy-intensive; therefore, billions of rubles a year will be 
spent to pay for electricity alone. In addition, hundreds of 
thousands of dollars will be spent to purchase imported 
consumable materials which are not produced in our country. 
  Characteristically, this project, major in every respect, 
was 
discussed by the Maritime Kray Administration. At that time, a 
detailed memorandum signed by Doctor of Chemical Sciences 
Valentin Sergiyenko, deputy chairman of the RAN Far Eastern 
Division, was addressed to Governor Yevgeniy Nazdratenko. An 
alternative variant for solving this problem, which is without 
parallel in world practice, was proposed in the memorandum. 
  In this variant, the waste would be purified by using the 
so-called composite sorbent. It would be manufactured from of 
local, Maritime Kray raw material--zeolite from Chuguyevskiy. 
Only a few scientists are aware of the secrets of sorbent 
``nitty-gritty''; they have kept this secret for a while since 
they do not have the funds to acquire a foreign patent which 
guarantees the protection of inventors' rights. 
  By all signs, the time has come. The scientists approached 
the technical administration of the fleet and received the 
famous liquid radioactive waste for laboratory testing; it is 
turbid dirty water which is rich not only in radiation but also 
in fuel oil and paraffin. Directing this water through the 
sorbent, they purified it to such a degree that the content of 
radioactive cesium, strontium, magnesium, and cobalt in it ended 
up several orders of magnitude below the maximum permissible 
concentration. In other words, the sorbent soaked up all the 
radiation; therefore, the processed water could be dumped right 
into the sea without any fear of an international scandal. 
  The scientists who were inspired by the initial results 
started to make calculations. It turned out that the total 
annual outlay associated with such technology for processing 
7,000 cubic meters of liquid radioactive waste a year (the fleet 
just does not generate more than that), the operation of the 
installation, and so on would comes, tentatively, to 350-400 
million rubles [R]. This is much cheaper than the Japanese 
project. 
  This information was brought to the attention of the 
governor. However, no response to this appeal followed. In 
January, Sergiyenko wrote to the head of the kray administration 
for a second time, with the same result. Nonetheless, Yevgeniy 
Nazdratenko held a conference with the agenda ``On the Selection 
of an Optimal (!) Variant for the Storage and Processing of 
Low-Activity Liquid Radioactive Waste in 1994 and for the Period 
Until 1996.'' 
  Judging by the minutes of this event, the kray officials in 
attendance, as well as the representatives of the Pacific Fleet 
Command, consider the construction of on-shore tanks for 
draining liquid radioactive waste, including that from the 
aforementioned tankers, to be the optimal variant. 
  Everything would appear to be clear; their services were not 
needed there. However, the obstinate Sergiyenko--was it a matter 
of principle?--wrote to the governor for the third time. He 
insisted that all projects be accepted on an equal footing and 
considered on a competitive basis. 
  Incidentally, Sergiyenko knows the Zvezda Plant well and has 
a clear notion of where and how an installation with the miracle 
sorbents can be placed there. 
  I was shown the text of a telephone message which was 
received in Vladivostok from high Moscow spheres. In response to 
a request of the Japanese to be given an opportunity to see the 
TNT-5 and the TNT-27 firsthand, the message stated that this was 
only permissible if the tankers were brought out beyond the 
confines of the ``classified'' bay. Apparently, the fact that 
the tankers cannot be moved was left out of the picture. 
  It would be naive to think that the funds promised by the 
Government of Japan can be spent on something new, something 
that has not been tested in the worldwide practice of nuclear 
waste disposal. As Valeriy Danilyan, chief of the chemical 
service of the Pacific Fleet, remarked reasonably, ``the 
Japanese will only give money for something they are in a 
position to control.'' However, could this be precisely the case 
in which we should try to do without the now very customary 
``humanitarian aid'' and solve our problems ourselves, all the 
more so if this independent path is economically advantageous?

  [Text] Viktor Ivanovich Danilov-Danilyan, Russian minister 
of protection of the environment and natural resources, held 
talks with Japanese Ambassador to Russia Koji Watanabe on 4 
April. In the talks, the minister stated that a decision on 
dumping of liquid radioactive wastes into the sea should be made 
only by the Russian Government, and that the Maritime Kray 
administration has no authority to independently decide on the 
issue. Minister Danilov-Danilyan made the remarks in response 
to Ambassador Watanabe's concern over Japanese media reports 
that the Maritime Kray administration seems to be preparing to 
authorize additional dumping of liquid radioactive wastes into 
the Sea of Japan. 
  In proposing that Japan provide financial and technological 
assistance to Russia at an opportune time, Minister 
Danilov-Danilyan stated that it would be possible for Russia to 
completely prevent the dumping of liquid radioactive wastes into 
the sea if it can construct temporary tanks for storing the 
radioactive wastes in the maritime region with Japanese 
cooperation. In the meeting with Ambassador Watanabe on 4 
April, Minister Danilov-Danilyan highly appraised Japan's 
cooperative position in the field of dealing with nuclear 
wastes. Moreover, the minister assured that Russia would 
conduct a thorough environmental survey at storage tanks for 
liquid radioactive wastes as well as facilities for solidifying 
these wastes.

<F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS string correspondent Aleksandr Shuvalov] </F>
  [Text] Moscow April 6 TASS -- The Russian Ministry of 
Environmental Protection and Natural resources declared against 
signing the Russo-hungarian protocol ``on burying glazed 
radioactive waste products on the territory of the Russian 
Federation,'' the Ministry's press centre said on Wednesday. 
  The protocol supplements a Hungaro-Soviet agreement signed 
in 
1966. 
  The protocol contradicts Russia's ``law on environmental 
protection,'' a relevant presidential decree and the ensuing 
order of receiving radioactive waste'' passed by the Russian 
Ministry of Nuclear Power Industry. 
  The Ministry of Environmental Protection has expressed 
bewilderment in respect of a governmental instruction, which 
mentioned that it had supported the protocol. 
  According to the Russian legislation, the reprocessed waste 
products should be returned to the exporting country, the 
ecologists had warned. But their opinion was not taken into 
account by the authors of the protocol. 
  The planned burial of 66 tonnes of radioactive waste 
products 
from the ``Paksh'' Hungarian nuclear power plant will aggravate 
the hard situation in such burial places in Russia. 
  The move infringes upon Article 50 of the ``Law on 
Environmental Protection," which prohibits ``imports of 
radioactive waste products or materials from abroad with a view 
to storing or burying.''

<F P=106> [Dmitriy Alekhin report in the ``Waste'' column: ``Will the </F>
TNT-5's Radioactive Cargo Get Into the Sea of Japan?''] 
  [Text] The sensitive issues of radiation security are 
fairly effective in helping politicians build their image. 
Naturally, when local authorities decide to rid their residents 
of an enhanced radiation danger source, the latter react to this 
as manifestation of special care being shown to them. There is 
nothing bad about this, yet it is not always that the best 
possible methods are found to resolve such problems. 
  As RIA Novosti reported, the radiation aboard the TNT-5 
tanker, filled with radioactive waste from Pacific Fleet nuclear 
submarines, has deteriorated. The vessel, moored at the Zvezda 
plant in Bolshoy Kamen Bay, has developed a leak in its 
drainage, pipe, and valve system, as a result of which the 
radiation level in the aft engine room since the previous check 
(on 28 December 1993) has doubled, reaching 1,400 
microroentgen/hr. 
  This conclusion, according to the news agency, was made 
yesterday by a team of specialists created on orders of the 
Maritime Kray administration. Experts believe that in April-May 
the situation could aggravate rapidly; in the end this could 
lead in particular to the shutdown of the Zvezda plant, which is 
engaged in dismantling nuclear submarines under the START II 
Treaty. RIA Novosti also reported, citing Yevgeniy Stomastyuk, 
chairman of the Maritime Kray Environmental Protection 
Committee, that in order to avoid a major ecological catastrophe 
the commission deems it expedient to dump the liquid nuclear 
waste aboard the TNT-5 tanker into the Sea of Japan this May. 
  SEGODNYA's correspondent managed to obtain a comment from 
employees at the State Committee for the Supervision of Nuclear 
and Radiation Safety [Gosatomnadzor], an organization in charge 
of radiation safety on a Russia-wide scale. Gosatomnadzor 
representatives believe that because matters of ecological and 
radiation security come under the jurisdiction of federal 
authorities, such a decision by a local commission can be only 
of a recommendatory character. SEGODNYA's correspondent also 
learned that Gosatomnadzor has decided not to allow the dumping 
of radiative substances into the sea but to pump the liquid 
waste from the tanker to other vessels which are in good 
condition; the TNT-5 itself, after corresponding treatment, will 
be towed to a safe place.

  [Excerpt] The Russian-Hungarian treaty on burying processed 
nuclear fuel on the territory of our country is quite 
advantageous for Russia, Viktor Mikhaylov, minister of nuclear 
power engineering, told INTERFAX. Let me remind you that during 
his visit to Hungary Prime Minister Viktor Chernomyrdin signed 
an agreement under which processed nuclear fuel from Hungarian 
nuclear power stations is to be brought to Russia, for which our 
country is to be paid $40 million. Here is a report from our 
correspondent. 
  Correspondent Yevgeniya Novikova: Russia is still 
receiving radioactive waste from foreign nuclear power stations 
under international agreements once concluded by the Soviet 
Union. This concerns only those stations that were built by the 
Soviet Union on its neighbors' territory, and with which 
appropriate agreements were concluded. According to Greenpeace, 
processed nuclear fuel is currently stored on the territory of 
combines in Chelyabinsk and Krasnoyarsk, where the ecological 
situation has already caused a high incidence of radiation 
sickness and oncological diseases among the population. [passage

<F P=106> [By Oleg Padenko; from the ``Pacific Ocean'' program] </F>
  [Text] Vladivostok today has other problems. After our 
bothersome winter, the city needs cleaning and piles of rubbish 
removed before they become the cause of dreadful epidemics. 
This work has already begun and, as a matter of fact, quite 
intensively; however, the Sanepidstantsiya [Sanitation and 
Epidemiology Station] has not ceased to sound the alarm. 
  The problem of environmental pollution does not only concern 
the Vladivostok authorities. The Governments of Russia, South 
Korea, and Japan are quite concerned with the level of pollution 
in the Sea of Japan. The Russian scientific research vessel 
Okean, in the Japanese port of Niigata this week took aboard 
Korean and Japanese scientists, as well as an International 
Atomic Energy Agency [IAEA] expert, and sailed for the first 
radioactive waste dump site. Journalist Oleg Padenko will now 
give you a more detailed report. 
  [Begin recording] Padenko: This 
expedition was approved by the governments of the three 
countries whose shores are washed by the Sea of Japan. It is 
also being financed by these three countries and that is why it 
is equipped with modern equipment that will be taken aboard the 
scientific ship Okean in the Japanese port of Niigata, and where 
the Russian scientists will be joined by researchers from Japan 
and South Korea. Besides them, representatives of the Pacific 
Fleet -- the culprits of the piece -- as well as an observer 
from the IAEA will also take part in the research voyage. The 
reason for the expedition is known: the dumping of low 
radioactivity liquid wastes into the Sea of Japan by the Pacific 
Fleet in October last year, although our maritime neighbors have 
also solved such problems near their shores in the same way. 
  As was clarified later, our Navy dumped the polluted water 
legally, that is, with the permission of the Russian Ecology 
Ministry and in compliance with IAEA requirements. The 
radioactive waste dumping operation was observed by the 
environmental organization's vessel, Greenpeace. However, as 
they say, every cloud has a silver lining, since it served to 
make everyone once more raise the quite urgent and 
more-than-just-topical issue of environmental protection. And 
here, it is important to unite the efforts of all the sides 
concerned. The first step has been taken. To work out 
recommendations, the joint expedition aboard the Okean will 
collect samples of the sea bottom, take water samples at various 
depths, and carry out a quick analysis using a full range of 
tests to detect pollution in the sea. Well, what do the 
scientists expect from this joint work? Yuriy Nikolayevich 
Volkov, expedition leader and director of the Far East 
Hydrometeorological Institute, explains. 
  Volkov: I am hoping for positive results from this 
expedition. That is, that the radioactivity level will be no 
higher than normal background levels; however, the experiment 
will give us the final proof. 
  Padenko: It is apparent that you have already 
mixed somewhat with your foreign colleagues, namely the South 
Korean and Japanese specialists; tell us what do they have to 
say on this matter? What is their opinion about this voyage and 
the problem in general? 
  Volkov: They recognize that the problem is an 
important one and that this expedition must basically reassure 
the public that the sea is ecologically clean so that ordinary 
folk, who watched television and saw the dumping of the liquid 
radioactive waste, would not be afraid to buy fish -- because it 
is on household tables daily. Nevertheless, knowing how the 
dumping was done and what level of radioactivity there was, I 
and, of course, the other scientists also think that there are 
no consequences. 
  Padenko: Nevertheless, the expedition is still 
going? 
  Volkov: Of course, all this is being done at the 
highest level and in compliance with international standards, so 
that all the people understand that generally there is no danger 
to people's health. Although, I reiterate that it is better not 
to dump in the first place, so that we will not have to 
investigate later. [end recording]

<F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS correspondent Vladimir Solntsev] </F>
  [Excerpts] Moscow, 4 Apr--A decision on the dumping of 
radioactive waste into the sea can only be made by the Russian 
Government, and the Maritime Kray administration has no 
authority to decide this question independently. Viktor 
Danilov-Danilyan, Russian minister for the protection of the 
environment and natural resources, said this during the course 
of a meeting today with Japanese Ambassador to Moscow Koji 
Watanabe. The minister gave this explanation in reply to the 
ambassador's expressed concern over Japanese press reports that 
the Maritime Kray authorities were allegedly planning to 
sanction the further release of radioactive waste into the Sea 
of Japan. 
  Danilov-Danilyan made the supposition that a decision on the 
dumping ``may easily be avoided, especially if Japan provides 
financial and technical assistance at the right time, and we are 
able to set up temporary coastal capacity to store the waste.'' 
[passage omitted] 
  During the course of today's meeting, Danilov-Danilyan 
highly 
appraised Japan's desire for cooperation in this sphere. He 
also gave an assurance that his ministry would carry out a 
thorough ecological study, both of temporary capacities for 
storing liquid radioactive waste and of capacities for turning 
it into solid waste.

  [Text] Moscow April 8 TASS -- The agreement to bury nuclear 
waste on the territory of Russia, signed by Premier Chernomyrdin 
in Hungary, is in line with the commitments which Russia, as the 
Soviet Union's successor, has to fulfill. Vyacheslav Kostikov, 
presidential press secretary, told a Kremlin briefing today at 
the request of the Russian president and prime minister. 
  He said that the agreement, signed in Hungary, envisaged the 
processing and utilisation of nuclear wastes from atomic power 
plants built to Soviet blueprints in the Hungarian Republic. 
``Russia will avoid concluding such agreements as soon as the 
terms of the existing international contracts expire,'' Kostikov 
noted.

<F P=106> [Ilya Bulavinov report: ``Security Council Opposes Prime </F>
Minister's Decision. Viktor Chernomyrdin Cherishes Radioactive 
Memories of the USSR''] 
  [Text] Yesterday, the Security Council's Interdepartmental 
Commission on the Environment presented a memo to the council's 
secretary, Oleg Lobov, on the need to revise agreements 
reaffirmed during Viktor Chernomyrdin during his recent visit to 
Hungary. The issue is the possibility of burying radioactive 
wastes of the Hungarian ``Paks'' nuclear power station in 
Russia. KOMMERSANT-DAILY has learned that the prime minister 
discussed the impending scandal with Boris Yeltsin, too, during 
their meeting in Zavidovo on the evening of 6 April. 
  On 30 March, Viktor Chernomyrdin issued a directive tasking 
the Atomic Energy Ministry, upon agreement with the Foreign 
Ministry and the State Nuclear Supervision Committee, with 
signing a document with the Hungarians whereby Russia would 
``accept for reprocessing spent nuclear fuel of the `Paks' 
nuclear electric power station, with vitrified (that is, 
encapsulated in glass cubes) radioactive wastes of the 
reprocessing to be buried on Russian territory.'' It has turned 
out, however, that this is only the tip of an iceberg detected 
by environmentalists. In fact, the agreement to accept 
Hungarian radioactive wastes has been prompted not only by the 
desire to earn money. 
  Under the prime minister's directive, the Atomic Energy 
Ministry was to sign a protocol as part of a bilateral treaty 
between the Soviet Union and Hungary, which was concluded back 
in 1966. At the time, when building nuclear power stations 
abroad, Moscow usually undertook to reprocess and to store 
radioactive wastes on its territory. Having declared itself the 
legal successor to the USSR, Russia has effectively taken over 
the obligation. 
  The problem is that on 21 April 1993 Boris Yeltsin signed an 
edict obliging the government to make provisions for the return 
of nuclear wastes reprocessed (vitrified) by Russia to their 
respective owners when negotiating intergovernment agreements on 
the construction and operation of nuclear power stations abroad. 
Moreover, the Law on the Protection of the Environment prohibits 
``radioactive wastes from other states'' from being brought into 
Russia ``for the purposes of storing or burying.'' Under the 
documents, Russia has effectively no objections against the 
reprocessing of the wastes, but it refuses to keep them on its 
territory for further storage. The prime minister could hardly 
be unaware of the documents. During the visit, however, he 
preferred to bear in mind only the old treaty that suits Hungary 
alone. This may cost him plenty. According to KOMMERSANT-DAILY 
information, today the State Duma is also planning to discuss 
the matter of burying Hungarian wastes. 
  The Security Council's Interdepartmental Commission has 
demanded that agreements between Russia and Hungary be brought 
in line with the presidential edict and Russian law. The 
environmentalists' resolve has been boosted by the fact that 
representatives of the Foreign Ministry, the State Nuclear 
Supervision Committee, and the Environmental Protection Ministry 
have voiced disagreement with the draft protocol in response to 
the commission's unofficial requests. They have made no official 
denials, however, that they themselves have been involved in 
drafting the document. Meanwhile, radioactive waste storages in 
Chelyabinsk Oblast at the ``Mayak'' Production Association, 
which vitrifies nuclear wastes, have long been overfilled. The 
regional authorities' official stance on the ``parcel'' from 
Hungary is yet unknown -- they also prefer to keep silent.

  [Text] Moscow, 8 Apr -- ``The committee for conventions on 
chemical and biological weapons under the Russian president 
agreed to the transportation and storage of poisonous substances 
in densely populated areas. That is why its chief Anatoliy 
Kuntsevich was dismissed by presidential decree.'' This was the 
explanation of the wording of Kuntsevich's dismissal ``for a 
single gross violation of duties'' given by the head of state's 
press secretary Vyacheslav Kostikov at a briefing in the Kremlin 
today. 
  Moreover, Vyacheslav Kostikov noted that Anatoliy Kuntsevich 
had spent many years working on the creation of chemical weapons 
and ``it is difficult for a person to part from his child even 
if the child is dangerous.'' For this reason, the president's 
press secretary said, the person dealing with the destruction of 
the chemical arsenal should not be one who was involved in its 
creation.

radioactive contamination and other disasters. This is 7 
percent of the total amount of investments in the federal

  [Text] Oleg Padenko: The fact that yet another 
nuclear submarine is being dismantled at the Zvezda Works was 
immediately known in the Maritime Kray. After all, the question 
immediately arose as to what to do with the water from the 
submarine, polluted with radiation, since the notorious TNT-5 
tanker, like others, is full to overflowing with 
life-threatening waste. This is in the center of the Bolshoy 
Kamen town, quite near to Vladivostok. [video shows port 
facilities, vessels, residential buildings nearby] 
  Nor is there any protection against the impending disaster. 
Local projects to treat the waste are unrealistic and the 
Japanese assistance is hanging in the air. 
  It is precisely for this reason that the interdepartmental 
commission working at the Zvezda Works made a sensational 
decision on the necessity to discharge the liquid radioactive 
waste into the Sea of Japan, as was done before, because nothing 
else can be done. 
  Ahead is the dismantling of a further number of nuclear 
submarines, more than 40.

  [Text] The State Committee on Ecology and Environmental 
Protection and the Academy of Sciences held a joint press 
conference today. Our colleague Menzere Sadiqova reports: 
  [Begin recording] Sadiqova: At the very 
time when the ecological (?balance) has already been gravely 
disrupted, no state can remain indifferent to an attempt by a 
neighboring country to use nuclear power. Therefore, the 
agreement signed between Armenia and Russia on the reopening of 
the Metsamor nuclear power plant has raised serious concerns. 
The reopening of the nuclear plant, which poses a danger not 
only to the Caucasus but also to all Caspian Sea countries and 
which was built to operate for a limited duration, will cause 
radioactive waste to travel through Azerbaijan and then to the 
Caspian Sea via rivers. The reopening of this plant, which was 
planned to withstand a seven-point earthquake on the Richter 
Scale but is located in a seismic region susceptible to 9-point 
earthquakes, might amplify the tectonic processes in the Caspian 
Sea and cause yet another Chernobyl tragedy at the very time 
when the level of the Caspian Sea is rising. 
  Arif Mansurov, chairman of the Azerbaijan State Committee on 
Ecology and Environmental Protection, provided detailed 
information on these issues during the news conference. He 
assessed this decision by Armenia and Russia as a lever for 
political pressure. 
  In his statement, Academician Eldar Balayev, president of 
the 
republic's Academy of Sciences, said that the Metsamor nuclear 
plant generates more than 14,00O waste [measurement not 
specified] each year and added that there are many Armenian 
nuclear experts working in various nuclear centers; the 
reopening of this plant might enable them to gather in Metsamor 
in the future and allow them to make use of atomic power for 
nonpeaceful purposes. 
  The news conference was held in Russian and English because 
foreign reporters were also taking part. 
  We are currently in a state of war with Armenia. Do you 
think that by reopening the nuclear plant they could make use of 
it for military purposes? 
  Mansurov: At present, Armenian politicians are in 
a bind and could resort to anything. They could also make use 
of the waste from the nuclear power plant. [end

<F P=106> [KHABAR-EGRKIS report under the heading: ``From the Stream </F>
of News''] 
  [Text] The Caspian Sea is on the verge of ecological 
crisis. According to Fikret Dzhafarov, chief of the planning 
department for use of natural resources of the Azerbaijan 
Republic State Committee on Ecology, one of the causes of the 
crisis is many years of barbaric use of natural resources. About 
12 billion cubic meters of polluted sewage is dumped into the 
Caspian Sea annually. More than 18,000 square kilometers of 
aquatic area are covered by petroleum film, which is ruinous for 
the flora and fauna of these areas. A sharp, steady rise in the 
Caspian Sea level is also a cause for alarm. Between 1901 and 
1976 it fell steadily. USSR scientists considered this process 
irreversible and launched ``projects of the century'': damming 
the Kara-Bogaz-Gol Bay, rerouting Siberian rivers, etc., which 
cost tens of billions of rubles. However, in 1976 the sea level 
began to rise steadily. Between the 1989 and 1991 it rose 
another 1.8 meters. 
  According to scientists' forecasts, by the year 2000 the 
Caspian Sea level will rise another 2 meters. Major industrial 
and residential complexes and more than 50,000 hectares of 
cultivated agricultural land will end up in the flood zone on 
the territory of Azerbaijan. The changed level will shift by 
many kilometers the borders of territorial waters, which may 
lead to interstate conflicts. The issue of defining the status 
of the water reservoir has been raised in this connection. By 
proposing to assign to the Caspian Sea the status of near-border 
reservoir, specialists of the Azerbaijani State Committee on 
Ecology were working on the basis of its genesis and location, 
which indicate that it is a lake, whose level is not permanent 
and which is subject to strong anthropogenic influences. The 
question was raised for the first time by the Azerbaijani 
delegation at the Tehran meeting, where the proposal for an 
organization of Caspian states was discussed. At the next 
meeting in Astrakhan Russia proposed to impose a 12-mile 
territorial zone, which was not in the interests of Azerbaijan. 
The issue remained unresolved. 
  ``Over 70 years of Soviet power, in violation of all 
ecological norms, Azerbaijan was deprived of enormous reserves 
of oil in its soil, and the only chance the republic has now to 
deal with ecological and economic problems is by developing the 
rich oil deposits in the sea. Today Khazar is without a master; 
the interests of several states have clashed over its waters, 
and some people want to take the Caspian riches without bearing 
the responsibility,'' Fikret Dzhafarov said in conclusion.

<F P=106> [Interview with Minister of Environmental Protection Yuriy </F>
Kostenko by Oleksandra Oksanchuk; place and date not given: 
``Nuclear Lobby Begins `Rebuilding Communism;''' -- first 
paragraph is VECHIRNIY KYYIV introduction] 
  [Text] The edict by the Ukrainian president from 23 
February ``On Urgent Measures To Develop Nuclear Power Industry, 
To Set Up Nuclear Fuel Cycle in Ukraine,'' which VECHIRNIY KYYIV 
has already reported on, generated many responses and questions 
by our readers. How unsafe will the development of nuclear power 
plants be? The Chernobyl tragedy is still our current problem, 
it has not fallen into oblivion. We asked Minister of 
Environmental Protection Yuriy Kostenko to comment on this issue. 
  Kostenko: First, I state that this presidential 
edict was adopted without any cooperation with the ministries 
and departments -- the Ministries of Health and Environmental 
Protection, the State Committee for Problems of Consequences of 
the Chernobyl Catastrophe, and the State Committee for Control 
Over Nuclear Power Industry -- which are responsible for the 
state of the nuclear, radiological, and ecological safety. This 
edict is a vivid example of how the executive power -- our 
president -- violates the Ukrainian legislation and is under the 
nuclear lobby's thumb. The edict itself is absolutely 
inexpedient from both economical and ecological viewpoints. 
  I will begin with the economy. A lot is being written and 
said about the nuclear power industry being much cheaper than 
the electric one. As practice shows, electrical energy produced 
by the U. S. nuclear power plants is 1.5 times more expensive 
than the energy produced by thermal power stations. Why? For 
the first thing, high demands concerning nuclear safety 
considerably increase the costs and main expenses. For the 
second thing, companies which own nuclear power plants 
participate in special funds for establishing nuclear waste 
sites. For the third thing, each nuclear plant should be closed 
down and neutralized after having worked to the end of its 
operating life. To implement these conditions, a special fund 
should be established which will have to include tariffs for 
electric energy costs. Finally, any state which has nuclear 
power plants should establish a national nuclear waste site 
which is an extremely expensive undertaking. In the United 
States, costs for carrying out scientific research for drafting 
criteria for establishing such waste sites stood at over $1.5 
billion, while building costs of the nuclear waste site were 
estimated at more than $6 billion. 
  One more important point. According to the concept of the 
development of the nuclear power industry in Ukraine, we are 
planning to begin using ``KANDU'' nuclear reactors produced in 
Canada. They are safer than Russian ones. In addition, they can 
use the natural uranium and we can stop buying the concentrated 
uranium in Russia. Why should we build imperfect reactors? Is 
this advantageous for someone? 
  Oksanchuk: However, deliveries of Russian nuclear 
fuel to Ukraine is one of the conditions for our disarmament, 
one of the provisions of a tripartite Moscow agreement. 
Currently, only we are keeping to this agreement.... 
  Kostenko: This is the thing. Though, we have 
delivered 120 warheads to Russia, we are still waiting for 
Russian deliveries of the concentrated uranium. When the 
Supreme Soviet discussed disarmament issues, the matter of 
establishing a joint enterprise for dismantling armaments and 
the further use of the concentrated uranium for the nuclear 
power industry was raised. This would have been more 
advantageous for Ukraine than obtaining nuclear fuel from 
Russia. For example, the costs of an enterprise -- which 
``General Electric'' promised to build with us -- to dismantle 
ammunition and transform the highly concentrated uranium to the 
low concentrated variety would have stood at $25-35 billion. 
The United States' financial support for our disarmament could 
have been used for this purpose. Therefore, it would have cost 
nothing for Ukraine to set up such a joint enterprise. If the 
Ukrainian nuclear power industry begins operating ``KANDU'' 
reactors, we will have enough nuclear fuel -- extracted from 
warheads -- for over 150-200 years. Currently, we give back 
everything and receive only partial compensation which will 
cover our demands for only three-five years. 
  In my opinion, no economic crisis can justify the operation 
of the second Chernobyl reactor. God forbid the next accident! 
Otherwise, this portion of the Ukrainian soil will forever 
become a radiological cemetery. 
  In Zaporozhie, where the sixth nuclear reactor will be put 
into operation soon, the nuclear power plant is located close to 
the thermal electric plant. Discharges from the thermal 
electric plant mix with an enormous quantity of steam discharged 
from the nuclear power plant and cause oxide rains. This region 
which is very important in the production of agricultural 
products is experiencing a serious ecological crisis because 
oxide rains devastate everything. It is necessary to estimate 
what is cheaper: operating a nuclear plant or producing high 
quality agricultural products. 
  The Rovno nuclear power plant was probably built on 
karstenite cavities. Expenses to underpin the foundation of 
this nuclear plant have already exceeded the planned expenses of 
this site by 40 percent. 
  The aforementioned presidential edict also includes a clause 
which foresees putting into operation a new block at the South 
Ukrainian nuclear power plant. To put it into operation, a big 
reservoir should be built because the low water in the Yuzhnyy 
Bug River does not allow the effective cooling of the reactor. 
This reservoir will cover large territories. This situation 
has already been discussed twice by sessions of ecological 
experts: The first one was held in the time of the former USSR; 
the second one -- recently, by our ministry. Both inspections 
stated the inexpediency of setting up one more reservoir because 
picturesque landscapes will be covered with water and the 
ecological balance will be disturbed. In general, all this can 
lead to the death of the river. The situation will likely 
resemble that of the Dnieper cascade, where reservoirs turned 
into stinking bogs. 
  Therefore, I state that the implementation of this edict 
will 
have one result: Ukraine will be economically ruined and the 
ecological situation in the Republic will be greatly aggravated; 
if we continue operating our nuclear power plants, the 
consequences can become really unpredictable. 
  Oksanchuk: You opposed and are opposing our 
president. However, I will vote for you and my next question is 
as follows: If my Supreme Council candidate cannot do anything 
now when he is a minister, what will he do in the Supreme 
Council? 
  Kostenko: I am sincere: I owe everything that I 
have done within the ministry only to my deputy status. I have 
always opposed antiecological decisions. (A minister who 
opposes the government is not welcome there.) Do you remember 
the situation when Lanovyy began opposing the president, and was 
immediately dismissed? I used my deputy status to oppose the 
passing of the antiecological law by the government. However, 
there are limits to everything. Currently, it is difficult to 
speak about any results when the state management of the 
environmental protection branch has not undergone any reforms. 
Reforms will be possible when the Supreme Council adopts 
corresponding decisions. Therefore, I am running in the 
elections because the office of the minister does not enable me 
to proceed with ecological reforms. I am pinning my hopes on 
the new Supreme Council which -- if our people make the 
appropriate choice -- will first and foremost think about the 
future strong and independent Ukraine with clean fresh winds and 
water, green forests, and a healthy population.

<F P=106> [Theodor Troev report: ``Water Chiefs Fight a Tidal Wave of </F>
Red Tape''] 
  [Text] Today, there are some 30 European Union [EU] 
directives or decisions concerned with controlling water. Their 
implementation over the past two decades has involved 
substantial sums of money. 
  But key EU officials on one side, and top executives 
representing the industry on the other, often have conflicting 
views on the problems faced by the sector. 
  Recently, some industrialists appealed to companies to do 
all 
they could to ensure that those who make the decisions in Europe 
are fully aware of the cost consequences of new directives and 
take into consideration the consumers' willingness to pay. 
  Tom Garvey, deputy director-general on environment at the 
European Commission, admits that the Commission is ``sometimes 
criticised for making proposals for new legislation without 
giving proper consideration to the financial implications.'' 
  He argues, though, that the cost of providing water to very 
demanding standards has to be set against the advantage of the 
health protection it affords. ``There are two possible points 
of departure for such a debate. Firstly, can we afford to pay 
for the standards which are set? And secondly, can we afford 
not to have such standards?,'' Garvey says. 
  However, water and waste management companies such as 
Britain's Severn Trent draw attention to the huge amount of 
money that Europe would need to spend in order to get anywhere 
near the standards, for example, of the UK or Switzerland. 
``The enormity of the number of directives -- like the issues 
it raises -- renders the whole debate meaningless on a 
Europe-wide basis,'' says Roderick Paul, Severn Trent's chief 
executive. 
  The water industry in England and Wales has needed to spend 
28 billion pounds ($42bn) to improve its services. Severn Trent 
itself has spent more than 2bn pounds over the past four years 
to achieve high standards. Apart from providing water services 
in the UK, the company's waste water services business handles 
domestic, commercial and industrial waste in Belgium. ``When 
one considers EU directives in their broadest sense, I always 
find it strangely perverse that Severn Trent is helping Flanders 
to run its waste water services operation, and that Brussels 
itself has no sewage treatment capability,'' says Paul. 
  Future economic growth is seen by some to be adversely 
affected by the high costs for clean water. ``The alternative 
-- poorly managed polluted water supplies -- may be an even 
worse threat,'' argues Garvey. He urges water sector officials 
in Europe to use the best available scientific knowledge, as in 
this way ``we are more likely to be able to keep the price of 
our water under control in the future.'' 
  However, it may take some time before such a message is 
acted 
upon by all EU members. Valerie Homer, deputy director of the 
Water Companies Association in London, says the UK is the only 
EU country which issues comprehensive annual reports on the 
quality of water. Denmark and Portugal also prepare reports, but 
neither covers the entire country. In 1996, every EU country 
will be obliged for the first time to produce a report on 
compliancy with the water directives. This will be the first 
occasion when it might be possible to draw a clearer picture of 
the situation in Europe. 
  Most water industries have either gone through change or are 
about to be reformed. In countries such as France and the UK 
they have been privatised, but water in most EU states is still 
controlled by municipal authorities. In Spain, public and 
private companies co-exist. Public subsidies towards capital 
development costs are available in some countries and not in 
others. Tariff structures also vary; water is only metered in 
certain countries. 
  Paul believes that the way to meet cost challenges of EU 
regulations is to say that everything must be relative, because 
the basis upon which the regulations are set vary from country 
to country. He says: ``Apart from the EU, the last word lies 
with the industry. We cannot go on expecting the customer to 
pay for whatever the regulator's latest ideas may cost.''

<F P=106> [Article by Martin Boeckh: ``Chemical Industry </F>
Fears Black Market''; Subhead: ``EU Commission Raised 1994 
Import Quotas for CFC's''] 
  [Text]Frankfurt, 11 March 1994 -- It was only recently 
learned that the EU Commission has massively increased the 1994 
import quotas for chlorofluorocarbons[CFC's] and halons. The 
chemical industry in the FRG is now up in arms against this 
decision. It fears that its efforts so far to develop 
substitutes will be frustrated. 
  Back in the seventies, atmospheric scientists warned of a 
thinning out of the ozone layer in the stratosphere as a result 
of CFC's that had proven themselves so overwhelmingly in daily 
use as propellants in sprays, cooling or cleaning agents or as 
foaming agents. The scientists' warning did not go unheeded. 
Industry went all out in the search for new, environmentally 
friendly substances. Manfred Ritz, spokesman for the Chemical 
Industry Association [VDI] in Frankfurt acknowledges the success 
of development activities in the branch: ``By now there is an 
adequate substitute for virtually all applications.'' 
  For instance, ``R134a'' (hydrofluorocarbon [HFC]), a 
chlorine-free fluorocarbon is now available as a substitute for 
cooling systems that will not harm the ozone. Naturally, such a 
substitute is not to be had free of charge. In the words of Dr. 
Rudolf Staab, head of the ``specialty products'' business unit 
at Hoechst AG, Frankfurt: ``Such substances currently cost three 
to four times more than CFC's because of higher raw material 
costs and more expensive production.'' This may also be the 
reason for the present emergence of a ``gray market'' for CFC's 
and halons through the back door, as it were, and yet completely 
legal. In the future they will be allowed to be imported in 
large quantities from non-EU countries. For in the EU's latest 
decision, the import quota for CFC's from third countries into 
the EU was dramatically increased. 
  VCI spokesman Manfred Ritz characterized it as a ``low-blow 
to environmental policy.'' And Dr. Hartmut Vennen, a spokesman 
for Hoechst, remarked that the decision was ``political 
shenanigans at the expense of the environment.'' Still, what 
lurks beneath the patently questionable decision from Brussels? 
  As so often, it is the different political position inside 
and outside the EU that operates at the expense of environmental 
protection. The European signatories to the Montreal Agreement 
at their November 1992 meeting in Copenhagen resolved that 
production and consumption of fully halogenated CFC's in Europe 
in 1994 were not to exceed an amount of 46,000 ``Ozone Depletion 
Potential [ODP] tons.'' Using the descriptor ``ODP'' as a 
clearing-quantity, allowance is made for the different ozone 
depletion potentials of the individual compounds. 
  As of 1 January 1995, production and marketing of CFC's in 
the EU is prohibited, albeit not their use. Only in the FRG will 
it be forbidden to operate new systems with CFC's as of 1995. 
This is because of the 6 May 1991 ``ordinance prohibiting CFC's 
and halons.'' In plain terms, however, that means that in the 
future, old systems in Germany as well as old and new systems in 
other European countries may be unrestrictedly cooled with CFC's. 
  But, if dealing in freshly manufactured CFC's is outlawed, 
where are the CFC's to be gotten from? The alternative here is 
to import ``used goods'' from all corners of the world, for, 
even countries that have signed the Montreal Agreement may go on 
merrily producing them. The People's Republic of China [PRC], 
for example, currently has an annual per capita consumption of 
nearly 0.05 kg. Like all developing countries, however, it is 
allowed to produce 0.3 kg annually per capita. Rudolf Staab's 
prediction is: ``In the future, China all by itself will make up 
for it if the western world backs out of the production of 
CFC's.'' 
  Even worse is the fact that China, India and the CIS 
countries as producers are busily seeking out customers in the 
industrial nations that are now heading towards zero in their 
production of CFC's and want to market their new substitutes. An 
indication that this suspicion is not groundless is the enormous 
amounts of CFC's ordered by EU importers this year in Brussels. 
Dr. Heinrich Kraus, assistant minister in the federal 
environmental ministry and responsible for the safety of 
chemicals and their impact on the environment acknowledges: 
``The amounts requested were so exorbitantly high that some 
applicants did not even get any amount.'' Hence, the EU approved 
``only'' an additional amount of 26,000 t of CFC's, 20,000 t of 
halons and 85,000 t of carbon tetrachlorides, each in ODP units. 
  Naturally, this decision runs counter to neither the 
Montreal 
nor the Copenhagen protocol. The reason is that specific terms 
are linked to the new import licenses. Only used or recycled 
goods may be imported. ``Where are the 26,000 t of recycled 
goods supposed to come from,'' asks Staab. And chemists 
corroborate the suspicion: recycled and new CFC's are chemically 
identical and therefore analytically indistinguishable. For this 
reason Staab's fear is: ``In those third countries there is no 
recycling anywhere, only the labeling.'' 
  In the federal environmental ministry there is a calm 
reaction to this charge: ``The Commission has also recognized 
this handicap and devised a self-declaration form that has been 
forwarded to all potential importers,'' explains assistant 
minister Kraus. On it, each importer is obliged to state 
specifically where the material originates and also guarantee 
that it is recycled or used material. 
  Kraus states: ``If `black market goods' are involved, fines 
of up to DM100,000 are payable.'' To be sure, he does not 
dispute the fact that it will be difficult for an official in 
Brussels to inspect a producer's recycling capacities in China, 
India or beyond the Urals.

  [Excerpts] The destiny of nuclear waste from the Loviisa 
power plant in Russia is dividing Finnish opinion. The 
environmental organization Greenpeace, which visited the area, 
claims that the nuclear waste from Loviisa ends up in nuclear 
bombs. The Radiation Protection Center, which visited the area 
a little later, denies this categorically. Jaana Kanninen 
reports. 
  Kanninen: The representatives of the Radiation 
Protection Center visited the Chelyabinsk nuclear plant in 
February and the representatives of international Greenpeace in 
January. They both had the same aim: to find out what happens 
to the nuclear waste from Loviisa and whether the Mayak 
reprocessing plant is safe. The people from the Radiation 
Protection Center were able to visit the actual closed town that 
consists of Chelyabinsk Number 65 with its 85,000 inhabitants 
and the military and non-miltary part of the Mayak nuclear 
plant. The Finns were not allowed in the military plant. 
Greenpeace, for its part, was not even allowed to visit the 
closed town but had to content itself with information from a 
capital city about 80 kilometers away. In reading the reports 
of those two groups it seems as if they are talking about 
different planets. One of the central claims of Greenpeace is 
that the nuclear waste from Loviisa at least partly ends up as 
material for nuclear bombs. [passage omitted] 
  Nuclear safety manager Jukka Laaksonen from the Radiation 
Protection Center denies this categorically. 
  Laaksonen: ``The nuclear waste from Loviisa is not 
used for military purposes, this is absolutely clear.'' 
  Kanninen: Two military reactors are still 
operating in Mayak and they manufacture mainly tritium, an 
explosive used in nuclear warheads. Laaksonen says, however, 
that nuclear waste has nothing to do with the manufacturing of 
tritium. Ida Siimes of Greenpeace, for her part, thinks that it 
is quite possible that plutonium is also manufatured in Mayak 
and the spent nuclear fuel is suitable for that. The only thing 
the two parties agree on is the health of the local inhabitants. 
  Laaksonen: ``It is clear that the old waste has 
caused an increased risk of cancer and some of the people in the 
area who have cancer have no doubt contracted it because of the 
waste.'' 
  Kanninen: Jukka Laaksonen from the Radiation 
Protection Center says that the incidence of cancer is caused by 
old sins: accidents and emissions, of which there were many in 
the history of Chelyabinsk. According to him, the waste 
reprocessing plant is now well-managed and no emissions into the 
environment take place. Greenpeace disagrees. 
  Siimes: ``The local laboratories in Chelyabinsk 
have measured an increase in the quantity of plutonium isotopes 
outside the closed area, and this is believed to be caused by 
Mayak's emissions into the atmosphere. The amount of plutonium 
has increased even in the 1990s and it is therefore reasonable 
to assume that the plant is still making dangerous emissions 
into the atmosphere.'' [passage omitted]

<F P=106> [Article by Johanna Mannila: ``Carbon Dioxide Committee </F>
Calls for Effective Energy Conservation: Enduring Forest Policy, 
Modernized Autos, More Research, and Restoration of Marshes to 
Natural State, on Wish List"] 
  [Text] Active and enthusiastic energy conservation programs 
will increase in Finland if the Second Carbon Dioxide 
Committee's recommendations are implemented. The committee 
considered ways of decreasing Finland's carbon dioxide emissions 
to conform to the Rio pact. 
  In addition to effective energy conservation and an enduring 
forest policy, the committee wants to modernize autos, increase 
research on energy, and restore drained marshes to their natural 
state. The generation of carbon dioxide emissions will also be 
prevented by cutting down on waste. 
  The committee also proposes an increase in the protection of 
large timber stands and old forests and that trees be allowed to 
grow older than they are at present. Forests serve to absorb 
carbon dioxide, that is, trees bind the carbon dioxide in the 
atmosphere to themselves. 
  In the committee's opinion, making more efficient use of our 
forests would only slightly lessen the role of absorption. The 
committee estimates that the amount of growing timber in areas 
used by the forest industry will increase from 1.8 billion cubic 
meters to about 2.05 billion by the year 2000 if logging 
operations remain at their present level. 
  The amount of carbon contained in the entire timber stand 
would increase from about 600 million tons to about 730 million. 
The average amount of carbon dioxide absorbed during this period 
would be over 40 million tons a year, whereas the figure was 
about 27 million tons in the late 1980's. Absorption problems 
will only arise if logging operations rise to over 70 million 
cubic meters a year. 
<H5>  Rio Agreement Goes Into Effect Next Month </H5>
  According to the agreement on climate concluded in Rio in 
1992, emissions of greenhouse gases must be stabilized by the 
turn of the century and restored to their 1990 level. 
  The agreement is to go into effect in a month since 50 
countries have ratified it. Ratification is pending in Finland, 
but parliament will decide on the matter this spring. 
  The committee submitted its proposal to Environment Minister 
Sirpa Pietikainen (Conservative) on Friday [4 February]. ``It is 
not impossible to achieve this goal, although the target set for 
the industrial nations is a very exacting one. We need long-term 
decisions on energy taxes based on carbon dioxide,'' Pietikainen 
said. According to her, we must advance at the pace of the other 
industrial nations in adopting taxes so that Finland's ability 
to compete will not suffer. 
  According to Pietikainen, just as with investments in 
[cleaning up] the environment made in Estonia and Russia, 
projects involving reforestation in developing countries will 
probably be chalked up to Finland's credit when each country's 
carbon dioxide balance sheet is determined. The countries that 
have ratified the agreement on climate will decide on the matter 
in future follow-up negotiations. Pietikainen estimated that the 
reduction of carbon dioxide in neighboring areas by perhaps 2 
million tons would count in Finland's favor. 
  The committee does not reject the alternative of additional 
nuclear power, even though parliament did decide to rule out 
construction of a fifth nuclear power plant. The chairman of the 
committee, Jorma Routti, stated that there would be a need for 
resorting to the nuclear alternative in Finland in the long run. 
  Carbon dioxide is the most important greenhouse gas; the 
others are CFC compounds, methane, and nitrous oxide. 
  Finland produced 58 millon tons of carbon dioxide emissions 
in 1990. All greenhouse gases totaled about 80 million tons. 
Nearly 30 million tons of carbon dioxide are bound in forests 
every year. 
<H5>  No Simple Solution </H5>
  The increase in concentrations of greenhouse gases in the 
atmosphere may alter the earth's climate and natural 
environment. There are no simple ways of solving the greenhouse 
problem: Simple solutions are not enough. The committee 
summarized its proposal in 17 points: 

  -  Implement a government energy conservation program. 
  -  Adopt taxes on carbon dioxide in such a way that our ability 
to 
compete internationally is not weakened. 
  -  Subsidies for investments that conserve energy. 
  -  Research and development on more efficient production of 
energy. 
  -  Modernize cars, more public transportation. 
  -  Research on community structure. 
  -  More natural gas. 
  -  An increase in the use of bioenergy, that is, wood. 
  -  Maintain a willingness to use more nuclear power if this 
meets 
with public approval. 
  -  Restoration of drained marshes to their natural state. 
  -  Reduce community waste. 
  -  Reduce the need for fertilizers, whereupon nitrous oxide 
emissions will decrease. 
  -  Increase the use of incineration technology and exhaust gas 
conversion devices. 
  -  See to it that forest carbon reserves increase and that the 
carbon stored in forests and marshes is not released into the 
atmosphere. 
  -  Support research on the total amounts of greenhouse gases and 
the amounts absorbed. 
  -  Active cooperation with Estonia and Russia to conserve energy 
and reduce greenhouse gas emissions. 
  -  Promote reforestation, restoration, and energy projects in 
connection with aid for development.

<F P=106> [Editorial: ``Climate Agreement Requires Emission Control''] </F>
  [Text] In accordance with the agreement approved in Rio in 
1992, Finland has to use already long-known ways of reducing its 
carbon dioxide emissions, which are altering the climate. 
Appointed by the Environment Ministry, the Second Carbon Dioxide 
Committee regards energy conservation, reduction in the use of 
fossil fuels, and taking good care of our forests as the most 
important ways of slowing down the greenhouse effect. 
  In the committee's opinion, parliament may very well ratify 
the agreement, which it is at present discussing, which over 50 
countries have already approved, and which is to go into effect 
internationally next month. Parliament must act quickly so that 
Finland does not lag behind in what may be the most extensive 
and most important implementation of the Rio agreement. The 
committee calls for versatile solutions that will be effective 
for a long time so that carbon dioxide emissions can be 
stabilized by the turn of the century and gotten back down to 
the 1990 figures. 
  A more effective technology than before must be developed 
for 
the production and use of energy. We must switch to fuels that 
produce few emissions and gradually to clean alternatives 
despite the fact that nuclear power has been ruled out -- to the 
regret of the committee. We are already on the right track in 
Finland, but development must be accelerated with economic and 
administrative control measures. 
  Used with care, the proposed limits on concentrations and 
taxes on energy will be good alternatives, as long as they do 
not interfere with trade or weaken our ability to compete. One 
would not think that this danger is hard to ward off since the 
other industrial countries will also have to meet the same 
challenges and the climate agreement will have to be observed in 
international trade. 
  The forests offer Finland both leeway and an incentive to 
reduce carbon dioxide emissions and stimulate other countries to 
do the same. Woodlands will increase and bind much more carbon 
than is logged in them. A significant absorption of carbon will 
also be obtained by planting trees on hundreds of thousands of 
hectares of arable land to be taken out of agricultural use, 
whereupon the energy production, industry, and traffic sectors 
will manage to better implement their own reductions. 
  While it is impossible to stop the greenhouse effect, the 
climate must not be allowed to warm up any more than one degree 
in a century so that conifers, which grow for a long time, can 
adapt to the new living conditions. Consequently, a country that 
lives off of the lumber industry has a quite special need for 
effectively enough slowing down the change. 
  From Finland's standpoint, interesting as well is the 
possibility of perhaps counting in its favor reductions in 
greenhouse gases that we would achieve by modernizing outdated 
technology for dealing with an abundance of emissions in 
cooperation with Estonia and Russia or by reforesting 
desertified developing countries. 
  The Rio agreement calls for major changes in the climate 
policies of first the industrial countries and then the 
developing countries as well. The immediate goal for the turn of 
the century is only the first stage, after which the process 
will have to be continued for several more decades.

<F P=106> [Interview with Brice Lalonde, president of the Ecology </F>
Generation party and former environment minister, by Arnaud 
Hubert; date and place not given: ``France Does Not Have 
Nuclear Policy'' -- first paragraph is LE QUOTIDIEN DE PARIS 
introduction] 
  [Text] Brice Lalonde, former environment minister, has just 
returned from a fact-finding visit to Russia and Ukraine and is 
drawing up a report on the nuclear power stations in those 
countries which he will submit to the European and French bodies 
in the coming weeks. The president of Ecology Generation thinks 
that the problems of the French civilian nuclear industry are 
only just beginning, but that the real urgency lies in Eastern 
Europe. 
  Hubert: How do you interpret the Cadarache 
accident? 
  Lalonde: I think we are busy experiencing what 
happened in the United States. Our sites are beginning to age, 
and age badly. This is a problem for which we are not prepared. 
I think that with regard to Rapsodie, the risks were 
underestimated. 
  Hubert: Can or should this accident call into 
question the restarting of the Superphenix? 
  Lalonde: I do not think that the two events should 
be linked. The only common point is that the Cadarache accident 
is due to sodium, which is found in very large quantities in 
Superphenix. But Superphenix is an installation which bears no 
resemblance to the Cadarache installation. Rapsodie was out of 
use and I have the impression that this tank was cleaned in a 
rather slipshod way. Whereas all the fairies are watching over 
Superphenix and protecting it. Superphenix had to be shut down 
less because of a possible danger -- which exists -- than 
because its design was fundamentally a mistake and it became a 
financial drain. It will one day be necessary to admit that 
this story of converting it into an incinerator is a total lie. 
  Hubert: What is therefore now the order of 
priorities in France? 
  Lalonde: The first problem is Phenix, which 
strikes me as more of a weak link than Superphenix. We have 
just had a problem with the first of the line, the 
``grandfather,'' namely Rapsodie, in the dismantling of this 
reactor which no longer serves any purpose and the dangers of 
which were underestimated. We still have the Phenix, the 
``father,'' which ought to be shut down. Superphenix shuts down 
every five minutes because of alarms. The risk would lie in 
switching off the alarms so that they could no longer be heard. 
But if I was in government, I would ask for a report on Phenix. 
  Hubert: Could safety be more effectively 
guaranteed in the French civilian nuclear industry? 
  Lalonde: Of course. At present, we have a risk 
factor of one in 100 per year and per installation of an 
accident producing radioactive emissions. We ought to increase 
that to one in 1,000. Our engineers ought to be asked to improve 
this probability. They can do so, but they are not doing so 
because nobody has asked them to. In this country, there is a 
routine, there are habits, factions which continue their 
business, and politicians who do not know what orders to give. 
In short, there is no nuclear policy. 
  Hubert: You have just returned from a fact-finding 
visit to Eastern Europe. Does what you saw there present a 
nuclear threat to Europe? 
  Lalonde: Yes, there is a real abyss in Ukraine and 
Russia. That is where things will collapse first. The situation 
is deteriorating, especially because of Russian nationalism and 
the prevailing chaos. In Chernobyl, the population was moved. 
Almost 5,000 people were mobilized to clean up, they were 
ordered to do so because of the nature of the Communist regime 
still in place at the time. It would now be absolutely 
impossible to do that. The mechanisms of alternative 
democratic, administrative, and economic authorities have not 
been established. Russian nationalism proclaims that its power 
stations are the best in the world and that the Western 
countries have no role to play in them. Ukraine, for its part, 
depends almost 100 percent on Russians for its engineers and its 
spare parts. Anything which affects safety in Russia and in 
Ukraine comes second to production. 
  Hubert: So there is a risk of a second Chernobyl 
or worse? 
  Lalonde: Yes, and I am not sure that it is just a 
risk, I think it is a certainty, and at any time. Moreover, 
this is a very strange failure by our Western democracies. It 
is rather like Bosnia: We know, we watch, but we do nothing, or 
not much. 
  Hubert: Does nuclear power still represent the 
future in the energy sphere? 
  Lalonde: It is not certain. It is one technology. 
The future rests more with renewable energy sources. The 
nuclear industry presupposes a great deal of virtue. At present 
it is like being on a road on which our engineers responsible 
for nuclear safety are driving while telling us: ``You see, I 
don't have accidents! I'm driving at 110 km per hour and 
controlling my car.'' They forget one thing: There are other 
drivers who drive very badly. 
  Hubert: You are very pessimistic... 
  Lalonde: I am a realist. I realize to what extent 
this world is becoming a little more radioactive every day.

<F P=106> [``er.'' report: ``Toepfer Calls For Import Stop''] </F>
  [Text] Duesseldorf -- In a sharp manner, Environment 
Minister Toepfer has called for an import halt on 
chlorofluorocarbons from third countries to the European Union 
[EU]. The Christian Democratic Union politician called on 
Brussels to no longer grant import permits for the ``ozone 
killers'' as of 1995, even if this is legal. According to 
Toepfer, imports of up to 26,000 tonnes of chlorofluorocarbons 
to the European Uniomn are again permitted this year, but only 
if the material is reprocessed or used. However, with this 
import permit, the European Union is exposing itself to the 
suspicion that ``in practice'' it is not taking its commitment 
to the protection of the ozone layer ``seriously,'' Toepfer 
complained. While Germany will abandon chlorofluorocarbons in 
1994, Brussels is opening ``the door to imports.'' The 
Commission should discontinue the allotment of quotas, as soon 
as the production of chlorofluorocarbons is terminated all over 
the European Union at the end of 1994, he said. Moreover, 
guarantees from industry that all substances used in the 
meantime ``do not endanger the ozone layer'' are necessary. 
Behind the scolding are investigations regarding illegal 
chlorofluorocarbon imports from Eastern Europe to France via 
Germany.

<F P=106> [Article by Peter Schwarz: ``Eco-Audit: If They Are </F>
Unwilling the Market Will Pressure Them''; Subhead: ``Pressure 
on Companies to Certify Their Environmental Management Growing 
as Result of EC Ordinance''] 
  [Text] Duesseldorf, 4 March -- As of April 1995, companies 
will be able to have their environmental management assessed 
voluntarily. That is what the EU Eco-audit ordinance stipulates. 
But it is obvious even now that many firms are being compelled 
to implement the eco-check. Banks, insurers and customers are 
applying pressure. 
  In mid-November, last year, the presidents of the Federal 
Association of German Industry [BDI] and the German Industrial 
and Trade Association [DIHT] addressed a letter to the federal 
environmental minister. In their letter to ``Dear Mr. Toepfer,'' 
Tyll Necker and Hans Peter Stihl condemn the turnabout in 
government environmental policy. According to the three-page 
document, the private sector expects the government to seize the 
opportunity afforded by the eco-audit ordinance to ``refashion 
the relation between self-responsibility and oversight.'' 
  The leaders of Germany's private sector would like the 
federation and the laender to confine themselves to their core 
responsibilities. The eco-commitment at summit sessions should 
henceforth promote environmental protection and no longer new 
laws and regulations. The corporate eco-check that the EC 
ordinance outlines in 21 articles and five appendices was 
vigorously opposed for years by German industry. 
  Since then, private sector groups, gnashing their teeth, 
have 
struck up a friendship with the new instrument of Brussels' 
environmental policy. They have reconciled themselves to the 
ordinance on two grounds. Otherwise than originally stipulated, 
no firm is strictly obliged to take part in the audit. Besides 
that, the text of the ordinance is amply unspecified. It is up 
to the national governments to regulate what, how and by whom 
the detailed audit should be conducted. 
  So that in the future the government will not get involved 
in 
regulating corporate environmental management any more than at 
present, in Germany the BDI and DIHT are pushing for a solution 
``that is private sector-friendly and based on the principle of 
self-administration.'' In their conception, the Accreditation 
Sponsorship Society [TGA], that is entrusted, among other 
things, with the licensing of quality certifiers, should examine 
and oversee the suitability of environmental auditors. Since 
formal appointment of the auditors is a sovereign act, they are 
proposing a joint Chamber of Industry and Commerce center for 
it. Ultimately, according to the associations' plans, the 
central Chamber of Industry and Commerce [IHK] would also be 
responsible for registering the firms participating in the 
eco-audit and reporting to Brussels. 
  Such extensively conjured self-administration goes too far 
for environmental minister Toepfer. He would like for the 
auditors to be appointed by the federal environmental department 
and registration of the examined business sites turned over to 
the laender. 
  What seems to be a petty bureaucratic squabble at first 
glance is in fact of some significance. For the examining and 
monitoring organizations that the ordinance requires will 
ultimately decide how high to set the criteria for the 
eco-audit. Environmental protection groups like BUND [expansion 
not given] suspect that the ordinance will be watered down if 
the private sector implements its proposals. 
  Dr. Adolf von Roepenack who is involved with the EC 
ordinance 
at the BDI, does not share such fears. The requirements for the 
auditors have to be ``pitched very high.'' In fact, the private 
sector would hurt itself if lax examinations led the eco-audit 
``to degenerate into an elegant method for worming out of 
environmental protection,'' as Dr. Gerhard Feldhaus, head of the 
NAGUS [expansion not given] environmental committee at the 
German Industrial Standards [DIN] in Berlin, expresses it. 
Hence, only if the eco-audit is undertaken earnestly will the 
federation and the laender be prepared duly to reduce pollution. 
Anyone participating in the eco-audit could be relieved of the 
reporting obligation for it. Shorter approval times might also 
be conceivable. 
  NAGUS chairman Feldhaus, however, considers bureaucratic 
muscle-flexing justified only once the audit has proven its 
worth in practice for several years. First of all, the 
legislative groundwork for it has to be laid. Experts from the 
environmental ministry and private sector associations are 
currently consulting on the moot issues. 
  But even were a solution to be found in upcoming weeks, no 
one in the federal environmental ministry expects an 
``eco-auditor and site registration bill'' can be passed in this 
legislative session. At most, a cabinet decision may be 
possible. According to the EC ordinance, however, the member 
countries will have to create a feasible certification system at 
the latest by April of next year. 
  The new administration therefore will be under time 
pressure. 
If the Social Democratic Party [SDP] has the say-so in Bonn 
after the election in October, the BDI and DIHT will not be able 
to implement their self-administration model. Social Democratic 
environmental spokesman Michael Mueller gives minister Toepfer 
encouragement on this issue. For this reason too, something 
augurs that the federal environmental department will chime in 
with something important to say on the licensing of auditors. 
  Many corporate consultants are annoyed by the squabble 
between the minister and the industrial lobby that has been 
simmering for months. The consultants scent a big deal. Dr. 
Marlies Sander of Roland Berger &amp; Partner concedes: ``Of 
course 
we have an abiding interest in moving the issue along.'' 
  The Munich consulting firm, one of the majors in the branch, 
with nearly DM300 million in annual turnover, has not yet 
decided if it will have itself accredited as an independent 
eco-auditor or confine itself to the consulting business. At the 
moment, Marlies Sander estimates that Roland Berger is earning 
``in the single-digit millions'' with eco-consulting. In her 
opinion, so far only a few firms in Germany are involved in the 
issue of eco-management. 
  The Brussels eco-audit could now change this. If not from 
conviction, then under the more or less gentle pressure of the 
market, many firms will participate in the examination process. 
By as early as next year experts are projecting several hundred 
firms will. Large companies like Daimler Benz are presently 
checking out the ecological fitness of a number of sites. If 
certification is possible by 1995 they will be the first to have 
their environmental friendliness checked by the EU. 
  But medium-sized outfits too are well advised soon to cast a 
glance at EC ordinance 1836/93. Automobile suppliers, above all, 
will have to expect pressure on them from the manufacturers for 
the eco-check, according to the conclusion of an in-house study 
by Roland Berger. After all, vehicle manufacturers in turn will 
be under pressure. Eco-certificates will be required with 
increasing frequency from abroad in the government's award 
guidelines. 
  Banks and insurance firms too will be taking an interest in 
the eco-risks of their clients. Dr. Hans-Juergen Advena, 
managing director of Cologne's Gerling Consulting can therefore 
well imagine that a successful eco-audit will be taken into 
consideration in setting premiums and awarding loans. In 
Advena's words: ``Ultimately, the confirmed eco-report from a 
neutral auditor facilitates an objective risk impression.'' 
  For this reason too, Gerling Consulting is unwilling to 
exclude the fact that after a successful trial period the 
eco-audit will become obligatory for all businesses. On the 
basis of article 20 of the ordinance, in any case, the entire 
system will be on the test bench by 1998 at the latest. Even Dr. 
Klaus Heuvels of Frankfurt's Metallgesellschaft [MG], who took 
part last year with a lead works in a Brussels pilot audit, 
expects ``effectively, what is an option will become an 
obligation.'' 
  On the basis of his experience at MG subsidiary BSB 
Recycling 
in Braubach the EC concept has ``fully passed the first 
practical test.'' What does the audit contribute to the firm? 
Heuvels mentions four items above all: all essential eco-data 
are documented, weaknesses are identified, employees are 
sensitized to ecological problems. Also, according to the 
eco-jurist, the expert examination can reduce civil and criminal 
legal liability risks. 
  For Volker Brennecke who is preparing the ``eco-management'' 
project at the Association of German Engineers [VDI] in 
Duesseldorf, the eco-audit affords the firm an additional 
opportunity: ``The operational eco-checks should be seized by 
the firms as an opportunity, based on the comprehensive analysis 
of processes and procedures, both to avoid future pollution and 
also to initiate technical and organizational innovations. In 
this context synergistic effects are possible that will pay off 
in business terms.''

<F P=106> [Article by Birgitt Riese: ``How Much Illness Is </F>
Environmentally Induced?''; Subheads: ``Airborne Pollutants 
Blamed for Respiratory Tract Infections and Allergies''; ``No 
Longer Industry But Automobile Traffic Now the Leading Producer 
of Pollution. Scientists at First International Congress for 
Environmental Medicine Came to This Conclusion Last Week in 
Duisberg. Frequently, however, There Are No Methods for 
Identifying Any Specific Substance As Causing Illness. 
Intensified International Cooperation Should Help Resolve Such 
Toxicology Issues.''] 
  [Text] Duesseldorf, 4 March 1994 -- ``A second stage of 
environmental precaution must now follow upon the environmental 
repair phase.'' These are the words that North Rhine-Westphalian 
environmental minister Klaus Matthiesen used to open the First 
International Congress for Environmental Medicine. ``The sky 
over our country is once again definitely cleaner.'' This means 
that since the mid-eighties sulfur dioxide emissions decreased 
by nearly 775,000 tons per year, nitrogen oxide emissions by 
about 361,000 tons per year and the load of dust reduced to 
approximately 10 percent. 
  Such statistics confirm that the load of mass pollutants has 
been considerably lessened. But it creates the misleading 
impression that the environment is now back in shape. Actually, 
however, the amount of pollution being discharged has only 
shifted from industry to automobile traffic. Prof. Ulrich Ranft 
from the Medicinal Institute for Environmental Hygiene in 
Duesseldorf describes the result of a study conducted in Essen 
in 1991: ``Compared with industrial waste gasses, concentrations 
of nitrogen oxides and benzenes from traffic have risen 
considerably.'' 
  Research has also demonstrated that automobile exhaust 
causes 
illness. Residents along heavily traveled roads suffer much more 
from respiratory tract infections and fall victims to allergies 
more often than those living in less polluted areas. German 
researchers are not alone in acknowledging this, as Prof. 
Hans-Werner Schlipkoeter, president of the congress, is aware. 
``In Israel, Japan and the U.S., it has been possible to 
establish a correlation between the increase in automobile 
traffic and the rise in the number of allergy-related 
illnesses.'' 
  Sulfur dioxide, nitrogen oxide and benzene, however, are not 
the only causes for a spate of illnesses. A host of other 
substances like dioxins, heavy metals, solvents and asbestos are 
polluting the environment and are ingested via the food chain or 
the air that is breathed in. Science's goal is to analyze such 
pollutants and devise testing methods to be able possibly to 
verify their impact in provoking illnesses. 
  But researchers are often still groping in the dark. In 
Duisberg, Canice Nolan of the EU Commission tossed out for 
consideration: ``We are still nowhere near concluding the impact 
of a substance from its concentration in the environment, 
although considerable advances were made over the past decade.'' 
Appropriate methods are still missing, above all, for chemicals 
that do damage to genes. That is why in 1988 the EU initiated a 
research program involving biomonitoring, medical oversight of a 
specific group of the population exposed to genetically toxic 
chemicals. Under it, for example, the researchers are looking 
for ``biomarkers,'' that is, physical substances that 
characteristically undergo change both in their numbers and 
their structure when someone comes into contact with a specific 
substance. 
  Different methods lead to different conclusions. That is why 
there is no internationally uniform assessment of the risks from 
cancerous (carcinogenic) substances. Whereas in the U.S. and 
Russia only individual substances are classified as more or less 
carcinogenic, in Germany all substances suspected of being 
cancerous are analyzed and assessed. 
  Besides the difficulty in any event of assigning cancers to 
specific causes, an additional problem confronts German 
researchers: a lack of data. Since they consider it a threat to 
protected data, the laender have still not been able to agree on 
the introduction of a national cancer registry. In 
Schlipkoeter's words: ``The absence of a cancer registry is an 
enormous impediment to research.'' Alternatively, were data 
regarding lifestyles, jobs and previous residences available, it 
would facilitate the correlation of causes and illness. Ulrich 
Halekoh of the Medicinal Institute for Environmental Hygiene in 
Duesseldorf asks the question: ``Lung cancer can result from 
smoking, substances in the workplace and airborne pollution, but 
which factor is the cause?'' Not only that, but researchers are 
still far from being able to assess the combined effect of 
several pollutants. 
  Depending on where they live, are Germans subject in 
different ways to heavy pollution? On the basis of pollution 
involving polychlorinated biphenyls [PCB's], a study by the 
university of Erlangen-Nuremberg concluded that the 
concentration of PCB's in the blood serum did, in fact, increase 
with age but was independent of place of residence. Not all 
pollutants are distributed so evenly. The regional distribution 
for airborne substances varies widely. 
  Numerous environmental physicians are scaling a slippery 
slope. For instance: diesel soot. Up until now, the exhaust soot 
has not been classified as a carcinogen, even though the 
particles do cause lung tumors in rats. Uwe Heinrich of the 
Fraunhofer Institute for Toxicology and Aerosols in Hannover 
provides food for thought: ``There is no escaping the fact that 
diesel soot may contribute to the risk of lung cancer.'' But the 
automobile industry counters this with toxicological studies 
absolving diesel soot of a cancer risk. Up until now, however, 
it has not been possible for scientists to definitively arrive 
at an internationally uniform assessment. 
  Actually, if legal limiting values were adhered to, the risk 
of falling ill from breathing in a substance could be 
significantly reduced. But it cannot be entirely eliminated. In 
that case, to be sure, a substance could no longer occur at all 
in the environment. As Schlipkoeter says: ``Zero risk means zero 
dosage and that means that life could no longer go on as usual.''

``Raw Materials Lurk in Special Waste Materials''; Subhead: 
``Recycling Must Not Be More Costly Than Incineration, So Far 
Only Small Quantities Recycled''] 
  [Text] Duesseldorf, 4 March 1994 -- Recycling is becoming 
worthwhile as incineration costs rise and landfill capacity 
declines. This holds good increasingly even for special kinds of 
waste. New processes are supposed to bring the waste streams 
into production. 
  No one is able to state precisely how much special waste 
material is actually piling up in the FRG. Berlin's federal 
environmental department [UBA] bases itself on projections from 
the federal statistics department from the year 1990 and 
estimates nearly 14.5 million tons per year. For certain, the 
technical guidelines for special waste from the year 1990 saw to 
it that more waste has been estimated as special waste material 
since they distinctly expanded the list of the sorts of waste. 
Additionally, the waste spectrum is undergoing change. For 
example, the accumulation of contaminated soil from the cleanup 
of old dumps is increasing and so is the accumulation of sewage 
sludge from the purification of effluent. 
  About one fifth of such dangerous waste materials in Germany 
is actually slated for incineration. Peter Reher, chairman of 
the committee for waste treatment of the German Industry 
Association [VDI] Society for process engineering and chemical 
engineering [GVC], remarks: ``The capacity of existing 
facilities is totally inadequate. The fact is that seven of the 
16 laender have no incinerator capacity for special kinds of 
waste.'' 
  German waste legislation recognizes 332 kinds of special 
waste materials, but just 11 significant streams constitute 
nearly 40 percent of the sourcing. Topping the list with much 
more than one million tons are industrial sludges and sulfite 
liquors from the paper industry. There are presently no 
alternatives to incineration worth mentioning for either of 
those two sorts. 
  Research activities are underway throughout Europe to reduce 
the amounts of special waste materials in all fields, since it 
is not only in Germany that there is a shortage of incinerator 
and landfill capacity. The Euroenviron working group's report 
``industrial wastes,'' that was recently submitted by the UBA, 
for example, reports on such endeavors. Uppermost is the quest 
for economically practicable processes since lots of possible 
recycling processes founder on the high costs for them. 
  Berzelius Umwelt-Chemie [BUS], Luenen, is operating a 
demonstration facility for the processing of salt slag resulting 
from the recycling of aluminum alloys. In it, the scrap aluminum 
is liquefied under a coating of molten salt. The salt coating 
protects the metallic aluminum from oxidation and absorbs 
pollutants and reaction products that form during the melting 
process. After casting of the liquid aluminum alloy, the molten 
salt solidifies into slag. Each ton of secondary aluminum that 
is produced accounts for 0.7 t of salt slag. According to UBA 
statistics this is approximately 232,000 t per year. Aluminum 
alloy granulate residues, but, above all, the qualitatively 
high-grade coating salt are recovered by dissolving and 
recrystallizing the slag. The waste management contribution for 
the slag is lower than landfill costs in this context. 
  For quite some time industry has also been working on the 
processing of solvents and used oils. Modern combustion engines 
require oils that contain a large number of synthetic additives 
in addition to actual raw petroleum products. This sophisticated 
blend has posed a number of unsolvable problems for traditional 
recycling processes. Dollbergen refinery has now succeeded in 
processing even those kinds of used oils and emulsions without 
the addition of chemicals. ``Multi-effect vacuum distillation'' 
operates on a cascade system at graduated temperatures under a 
slight vacuum. Oils recycled here meet the high requirements, 
for example, of the automobile and steel industry, according to 
the operators. 
  Waste materials expert Herbert Maerz of Stuttgart's 
Baden-Wuerttemberg special waste material disposal [SBW] GmbH, 
views the increasing recycling of solvents and used oils with 
mixed feelings. ``The high thermal value fractions are thereby 
removed from the waste stream.'' It is hardly possible with the 
remaining spectrum of poorly combustible, mostly solid waste 
materials, to maintain a conventional combustion process without 
the addition of oil or gas as backup energy. One alternative is 
the thermo-cycling process developed jointly by SBW and BC 
Berlin Consult for low thermal value special waste materials. It 
is currently undergoing testing. 
  Also among the top contenders in the special waste materials 
statistics are waste lacquers with nearly 193,000 tons per year. 
The Bremen branch of Mercedes-Benz, for example, uses 
hydrogenation of the dried lacquer sludge together with other 
organic residues as an important step in the reduction of that 
source. Besides a liquid phase similar to petroleum, the 
resulting end product is also gaseous hydrocarbons that are 
reused in petroleum refineries. The solid residue from fillers 
and pigments can be disposed of in coking processes. 
  Notwithstanding the high standard for industrial serial 
lacquering, in every lacquering process high percentages of the 
color droplets overshoot the workpiece and are collected as 
overspray in a curtain of water. Depending on the plant's degree 
of automation, in extreme instances, up to 80 percent of the 
lacquer that is used ends up in the resulting sludge. Currently, 
a process by the Duisberg firm Envilack promises to recover the 
raw materials from those amounts with no loss of quality. 
Envilack managing director Peter Brodt describes his experience: 
``The chromophore portions can be very well separated out from 
the dehydrated lacquer coagulates.'' 
  The group from Duisberg uses the force of gravity in its 
process. Generally speaking, inorganic pigments and fillers are 
heavier than binders and solvents and therefore can be separated 
out using disk centrifuges. A second step is membrane filtration 
to separate out the organic pigments. The result is a clear 
honey-yellow lacquer that can be used without reservations for 
the production of new lacquers. The processed pigments are used 
in anti-corrosives. The portion of the cost for the process that 
is borne by the producer of the residue is, according to Brodt, 
DM1,000 per ton less than the cost of incineration. 
  Rippert Anlagentechnik in Clarholz has developed a fresh 
concept for lacquering processes suing water-base lacquers. No 
lacquer sludge accumulates here at all initially. In the spray 
cabin no water trickles down the walls, only the water-base 
lacquer that is to be sprayed. The overspray now directly hits 
the circulating lacquer that is trickling down and is 
immediately reabsorbed by it. The compound is continuously 
checked by appropriate measuring devices. According to data from 
the producer, such a ``lacquer in lacquer'' spray cabin can pay 
for itself in as little as two years with 100 percent usage of 
the lacquer and no need for disposal of sludge. 
  In a report last year the UBA reported: ``Despite recycling 
and efforts at avoidance, the amount of dangerous waste 
materials in the FRG still continues to increase.'' In this 
connection, there is hardly any segment of waste management 
where data and statistics are so uncertain as in special waste 
materials. Reports on the results of the individual laender 
regarding recycling quotas and the decline of up to 30 percent 
of special waste materials are often no more than wishful 
thinking or a question of definition. UBA expert Hans W. Jacobi 
cites one example: ``Special waste materials that are piled up 
in landfills are considered to be disposed of.'' Even Envilack 
managing director Brodt is aware that recycling efforts are only 
in the first stage: ``The amounts that are now being recycled 
are of no consequence.''

Facility for Chemical Recycling of Polyurethane''; Subhead: ``Up 
to 1000 Tons Per Year of Polyurethane Waste Materials from 
Production of Shoe Soles to Undergo Recycling by Being Broken 
Down into Source Materials''] 
  [Text] Pirmasens, 11 March 1994 -- Up until now industry 
has been able at most to process polyurethane [PUR] systems into 
pressed slabs via very unsatisfactory ``particle recycling.'' 
Such is no longer the case. Regra Recycling GmbH in 
Pirmasens-Gersbach recently introduced the first facility 
throughout the FRG for chemical recycling of the production 
waste materials from PUR shoe soles. In the view of Prof. Dr. 
Gunter Bauer of Aalen College, it can rightfully claim to be a 
strictly defined recycling principle. 
  In the words of Heinz Bader, Regra's managing director, the 
nearly DM1.7 million investment in the new PUR recycling system 
should be amortized in fewer than five years. He sees the 
reasons for this in the rising costs for disposal and the 
somewhat more favorable prices for the recycled material 
``Recypol,'' compared to new material. But what makes the system 
quickly profitable is primarily the fact that up to 20 percent 
of the PUR shoe sole output can be reincorporated into the new 
material. Nor do existing facilities have to be overhauled. Only 
a metered product feed system has to be integrated for delivery 
of the recycled material, as Bader explained when introducing 
the PUR recycling system in Pirmasens in the middle of December. 
  The batch-processing facility has a capacity of 1000 tons 
per 
year. Superficially considered, therefore, it would be 
over-sized for processing the approximately 70 t per year that 
result from the chlorofluorocarbon [CFC]-free shoe sole output 
of Regra Kunststofftechnik GmbH. But the company is offering the 
excess capacity to other firms that use similar PUR systems for 
recycling on a paid basis. Additionally, Bader figures that the 
investment risk is limited. The nearly 70 tons of PUR waste 
materials from his own group to be processed, have a materials 
value of nearly DM400,000. As the Regra managing director puts 
it: ``Valuable replacement materials that are too good to 
dispose of, not to mention the high fees for doing so.'' 
  By comparison, the system was built by Kloeckner Ferromatik 
Desma, Achim, to the specifications of the recycling firm and 
costs approximately DM500,000, excluding R&amp;D outlays. Prof. 
Dr. 
Gunter Bauer of Aalen College holds the patent for the process. 
He was entrusted with its development under a Regra research 
commission. The recycling company, however, has secured for 
itself exclusive market licensing. Elastogram GmbH, Lemfoerde, a 
member of the BASF group, contributed applied engineering 
support as a raw materials supplier of PUR systems. Development 
and creation of the system were sponsored by the 
Rhineland-Palatinate environmental and economic ministries. 
Bader applauded the support as nothing to be taken for granted. 
  According to Prof. Bauer, the goal in developing the process 
was not to include any new materials (polyol and isocyanate 
components) in the process. ``That means radically modifying the 
process so that the only materials used for it are those already 
used in the manufacture of shoe soles.'' In this context, polyol 
is combined in a reactor with the waste material and converted 
into a dispersion at a maximum of 200 degrees C, using a 
catalyst. The Aalen professor optimistically explained: ``That 
is why this recycling process can rightfully claim to be a 
strictly defined recycling principle.'' 
  One qualification has to be made, however. The process has 
to 
be respectively adjusted for the specific PUR recipe. Recycling 
experts, therefore, cannot convert one recipe one day and 
another the next day into a singly recycled polyol or even 
deliver blended PUR waste materials to the process. Still, 
managing director Baden is optimistic about finding customers 
for the system and/or recycling orders on a paid basis in the 
shoe sole recycling sector initially because of the similar 
recipes. As Prof. Bauer states: ``Other PUR processors are 
confronting the same problems as we are.'' For example, five 
million tons of PUR systems are used around the world (1991). Up 
to eight percent of that results from product waste materials. 
In this context, advances in PUR recycling technology are making 
a noticeable contribution to the saving of resources. 
  Progress has also been reported in the field of processing 
blended PUR waste materials using glycolysis. Bernard Naber, a 
degreed chemist and recycling expert with BASF Schwarzheide 
GmbH, reported this in the course of Regra's introduction of a 
project of the Development Corporation for the Recycling of 
Plastics [EWvK] in Wiesbaden, in which recycling was tried out 
on 1.6 tons of PUR low-density foamed material from used car 
seats. As concluded by PUR experts, each automobile accounts for 
nearly 10 kg of foamed material of various sorts (block, 
cold-formed, heat-formed foamed material). 
  In the words of Naber, the non-uniform chemical composition 
made it impossible to sort out the waste materials. Still, 
according to the Schwarzheide PUR recycling expert, despite such 
unfavorable preconditions, glycolysis is ``exceptionally well'' 
suited to be a recycling process. The reason is that in the 
quest for new fields of application, it turned out that the PUR 
recycled product can be used especially for the production of 
solid foamed material as well as coating systems. PUR 
specialists reintroduced up to 81 percent of the recycled 
product into the polyol components for a solid foam and up to 90 
percent for a coating system. Naber is convinced: ``The recycled 
products display a properties profile that is comparable to that 
of conventionally manufactured PUR products.'' As early as the 
spring of 1994, therefore, an initial facility operating 
according to such specifications, is supposed to start 
processing the product residue of a large FRG automobile 
supplier.

<F P=106> [Article by Hans Dieter Sauer: ``Recycling Improves PVC's </F>
Image''] 
  [Text] [First paragraph is editor's summary] VDI)N, 
Duesseldorf, 18 Feb 94))Curse or blessing))no artificial 
material is a source of such vehement discussion as polyvinyl 
chloride. The economy has built up a comprehensive 
infrastructure for recycling and is thus removing a portion of 
PVC from critical environmental discussion.PVC is everywhere. It 
is found as window frame, drainpipe, floor covering, cable 
sheathing and automobile part, but also as transparent wrap, 
record, check)cashing card and ring binder. Every year the 
chemical and plastic processing industries put 1.4 million tons 
of new PVC in circulation, and approximately 360,000 tons are 
discarded annually as used products.Producers and processors of 
PVC praise its resistance, durability, and versatile 
applicability. Environmentalists, on the other hand, see it as 
particularly environmentally harmful material: during production 
the carcinogenic gas vinyl chloride is employed, and PVC also 
contains toxic materials as softeners, as well as lead and 
cadmium for UV stabilization. Not least, burning the artifical 
material can create dioxins and fusanes.The great majority of 
old PVC is still deposited as trash or burned. But the material 
is more and more often becoming part of a cycle. Werner 
Preusker, chief executive of the Bonn working group PVC and 
Environemnt (AgPU), a coalition of PVC producers, processors and 
users, private individuals and institutes, emphasizes: ``There 
are functioning recycling possibilities today for the most 
important PVC products.'' For windows, floor coverings, pipes 
and gutters))quantitatively these products make up half of all 
PVC products))the organization of comprehensive collection 
systems is in full swing in Germany or has already been 
completed. The first major plants for reprocessing the used 
material have started up. Six manufacturers of PVC windows have 
joined forces in the ``Window Recycling Initiative'' (FREI), 
which has reached agreement with numerous window and facade 
companies about returning used windows. FREI members in turn 
have committed themselves to using recycled PVC products in the 
production of new window profiles. The windows are taken for 
reprocessing to Dekura GmbH in Rahden, in Westphalia. As a rule 
the recycled material is processed into a profilejnucleus which 
is surrounded by a layer of new material.Reprocessing is done 
basically in three steps. After rough shredding and the sorting 
out of glass splinters, a shredder chops up the frame pieces 
along with fittings and steel frames. Then magnets and 
separators separate iron and non)ferrous metals out of the 
mixture, and a socalled heavy goods selector picks out any 
fragments of glass and metal which remain. The material is then 
ground into small grains, sifted, extruded at 150 degrees 
Celsius and finally granulated in pill size. The plant can 
process 1.5 tons of used windows in an hour. At present it is 
running a single shift))not enough material is being supplied 
for more. Because numerous depositories still accept used 
windows, according to Dekura's chief executive Horst Detering, 
``recycling is having the ground cut away under it.'' Besides 
FREI, the profile producer VEKA in Sendenhorst also takes back 
old PVC windows. In the Thuringian town of Behringen, north of 
Eisenach, VEKA Environmental Technology GmbH has constructed for 
about DM30 million the ``most modern recycling plant in Europe 
for windows, roller blinds, plates and profile remnants made of 
PVC.'' The fully automated plant also uses their different 
physical properties to separate the window components))glass, 
metal, rubber and PVC. According to the oprators, 97.5 percent 
of the material provided can be recovered in reusable quality; 
only 2.5 percent is unusable waste. Production leader Erich 
Schulz emphasizes as a particular advantage that soon it will be 
possible to sort the recycled product into white and colored. 
For this purpose every grain of PVC is subjected to a flash of 
light; if it is a white grain, a puff of air from a jet is 
released by its greater reflectivity and the grain is blown off 
the conveyor belt, while the colored grains are unaffected and 
stay where they are. The plant can also reprocess the wooden 
windows with plastic coating typical of the GDR, socalled 
plasta)windows. Since the wood is untreated, according to Schulz 
it is suitable for the manufacture of chip boards. To ensure 
supplies, VEKA has made agreements with 300 processors of PVC 
frames to supply dismantled windows, roller blinds and profiles 
in Behringen.Floor coverings have been collected since 1990 by 
the working group PVC*Bodenbelag Recycling (AgPR) in selected 
test areas and processed in a plant in Grossefehn in East 
Frisia. However, it took some time to master the technology. 
``We needed to find out that you have to proceed quite 
differently in the reprocessing of used coverings than in the 
reuse of production residue,'' reports Hans)Juergen 
Nettelnbreker of the company Huels AG, which developed the 
procedure for AgPR.The solution they found was socalled cold 
grinding. The soft PVC is hardened by liquid nitrogen so that it 
can be reduced to very fine grains with a diameter of 200 
micrometers. In this way not only is the quality of the grind 
improved but a significantly higher throughput is also achieved. 
The plant's present capacity is 4,000 tons per year)*according 
to Nettelnbreker, more is not available at the moment on the 
used PVC market. The recycled material is reused by the member 
companies of AgPR as an underlay for floor tiles.After being 
dismantled last autumn, the plant is now being rebuilt in ajmore 
favorable location in Troisdorf near Bonn. A plant is being 
planned at the same location for the recycling of PVC roof 
guttering. PVC tubes are collected under the guidance of the 
Artificial Materials Association (KRV) in Bobb. From the dealers 
the material goes to four regional centers, where it is sorted 
and cleaned. The processing is scheduled to begin soon on the 
premises of the Wavin company in Westeregeln near Magdeburg.A 
total of approximately 5 percent of PVC waste is now being 
recycled, in the estimation of Walter Toetsch of the company 
Huel AG. In the case of pipes and windows, because of their long 
life, at present there are only minimal quantities of less than 
one percent. In the case of floor coverings, approximately 20 
percent is reprocessed.Recycling stands or falls with the 
collection system. The purity of the various types and the 
soiling of the material, and thus ultimately also the quality of 
the recycled product, are determined by the method of 
collecting. Since different PVC types are used for different 
products, the basic rule is: window profiles are made into 
window profiles, floor coverings are made into floor coverings, 
and pipes are made into pipes.When collection is carried out by 
professionals, good results are achieved. Experience has proved, 
however, that collection in unsupervised containers yields 
unusable mixtures even when the user is given extensive 
information.In any case, collection is associated with high 
costs. That is why recycled products are usually more expensive 
than raw materials. Toetsch confirms that ``the recycling of 
artificial materials, apart from production wastes, must always 
be subsidized through the product or through a disposal fee.'' 
At Huels AG, PVC was ground nine times to technical school 
standards and re)formed into products without its mechanical 
properties deteriorating. But practical recyclability is limited 
by the structure of the finished products, demands placed on the 
material during use, and the type of collection. In order to 
exploit the potential of nine cycles, more than 90 percent of 
every product generation would have to be recovered and cleanly 
sorted. ``That is unrealistic,'' Toetsch points out. Even 
copper, he said, achieves a recycling quota of only 40 percent, 
which represents 1.7 cycles.Material recycling has its limits 
for PVC too. Depending on the application, a realistic 
proportion of recycled material in new products lies between 20 
and 30 percent. This gives the upper limit for material 
processing, as is stressed by AgPU expert Joachim Eckstein. If 
high reprocessing quotas were demanded, Eckstein calculates that 
there would unavoidably be large surpluses of recycled material. 
In his estimation the EU could accumulate a mountain of 50 
million tons of used plastics over a period of 10 years. He is 
firmly convinced that ``a return quota of 60 percent with 
nothing but material recycling cannot possibly be realized.'' 
The Federal Environmental Agency (UBA) in Berlin has not yet 
taken up anjunambiguous position on PVC recycling. It describes 
its own attitude as ``ambivalent''; it is true that recycling 
reduces wastes, but it does not solve the problems which lie in 
the material PVC itself. The UBA hopes for clarification from a 
research project with the title ``Ecological Comparison of 
Products Which Contain Bromides and Chlorides With Those Which 
Do Not in the Construction Industry.'' The results should be 
available by the end of this year.

``Agreements Do Not Solve Environment Crisis''] 
  [Text] Self-Delusion: People are signing 
environmental agreements as never before. But we are fooling 
ourselves if we think this means action. 
  Last week the European countries agreed on a new sulphur 
pollution protocol. Emissions which come down over Norway in the 
form of acid rain and kill more and more of Norwegian nature, 
shall be reduced further over the next 10 years. The agreement 
will be formally signed in Oslo in June. The great agreement on 
climate from the environment summit in Rio in 1992 will go into 
effect in a couple of weeks. Just before Christmas the 
sister-agreement on biological variety went into effect after 
having been ratified by 30 national assemblies. 
<H5>  Applause and Honor </H5>
  Environment bureaucrats are applauding each other. Never 
before have agreements gone into effect at such a rapid pace. It 
is hardly two years ago that the accords were signed. And new 
protocols and regional agreements concerning various small and 
large environmental problems are being signed all over the world. 
  However, it would be a fatal mistake in judgement to applaud 
too loudly. Certainly, paper formalities resulting from 
environmental efforts are being crowned by victory more often in 
the 1990's than was common before. But it is a long step from 
the signing of the agreement to the matter being acted upon. 
Only a few of the 50 to 60 important environmental agreements in 
the world have strong built-in mechanisms for follow-up and 
control. This year's edition of the ``Green Globe Yearbook'' 
also shows that the follow-up is poor even for those agreements 
that have the best built-in mechanisms for follow-up. 
  The world's environmental agreements can be roughly divided 
into two categories. In one there are the large accords and 
framework agreements. These are most suitable for politicians 
who want to calm an environmentally preoccupied public opinion. 
The great accords on climate and biological variety from Rio are 
good examples of this. Without new supplementary protocols for 
the most part these are without any value for the global 
environment. 
<H5>  Action </H5>
  The other type of agreement are those targeting specific 
actions. Unfortunately, these are a small minority, but all the 
more important. The best known of these is the Montreal protocol 
from 1987 with a later addendum whose goal was to phase out 
emission of gases harmful to the ozone layer. This agreement has 
been clearly spelled out. It stipulates definite deadlines for 
all the 131 participating countries. Still, by the deadline of 
September of last year, only 23 percent of these countries had 
reported on what they were in fact doing and what results they 
had achieved. Because it is assumed that most countries would 
report any action taken on what they had promised to do, the low 
percentage of reporting countries is taken as a sign that many 
are not following up. Because this is an agreement with 
important consequences for industry, the lack of action in 
individual countries will affect their ability to compete. That 
is why the great industrialized countries have taken the 
initiative and proposed introducing strict punishment for the 
shirkers. Having received a warning those countries might be 
excluded from the agreement. This means a loss of both prestige 
and money from the ``ozone fund.'' 
  The new sulphur agreement belongs to this latter group. 
True, 
the text of the agreement offers no opportunity for the imposing 
of sanctions, but because reduced sulphur emissions in the 
future will be very costly the 28 participating countries will 
monitor each other closely. Shirking means advantages for one's 
own industry. The sulphur agreement is also very modern. It is a 
model for future environment agreements in which each country is 
charged with measures according to how great their emissions are 
and to the amount of damage they cause. That means saying 
goodbye to the old-fashioned principle in which all countries 
must reduce their pollution by the same percentage no matter 
what the cost and what effect it has. The new sulphur agreement 
takes as its point of departure the amount of sulpher oxide the 
various countries are contributing and the amount of damage 
caused by these emissions according to simulations by computer 
models. 
  So far our global society has been able to draft a good 
agreement either for very definite objectives, such as, for 
example, how to decrease the emission of gases that break down 
the ozone layer or for controlling problems that are strictly 
geographically limited, for instance acid rain in Europe. 
  However, our answer to the really large and serious problems 
that place the world in the middle of a serious environmental 
crisis, is to come up with loose, totally irrelevant nonbinding 
agreements. To mention just a few; the population explosion, 
poverty, cutting down the rain forest in the south and the 
irreplaceable conifer forest in the north, the loss of several 
hundred plant and animal species every year, the danger of a 
changed climate as a result of global warming .... 
  So far the world has not been mature enough to take the 
environmental crisis completely seriously. The meeting in Rio in 
1992 started a trend. But such trends are without value unless 
they lead to definite action. And to achieve action, obviously 
some sort of voluntary force is needed. So far many of the 
environmental agreements and negotiations around them have been 
a singular form of ritual dance, mostly suited only to sooth a 
worried public opinion. The most pessimistic people say that we 
must wait for a total environmental collapse before the world 
will react. Another alternative is to put some teeth into the 
agreements. To do that we need a vigilant public opinion which 
will not settle for weak agreements with weak follow-up.

<F P=106> [Guest commentary by Prime Minister Gro Harlem Brundtland: </F>
``Growth, Value Increase, and the Challenge of the Environment''] 
  [Text] Growth is still necessary to meet new, 
important social challenges. Growth might even be necessary to 
meet environmental challenges. It is not true that the slower 
the rate of economic growth or the lower the increase in 
consumer demand, the more productive the growth is. It is the 
kind of growth that is important, Prime Minister Gro Harlem 
Brundtland writes. 
  In the last few years there has been a renewed debate on the 
relationship between the pattern of production and consumer 
demand, on the one hand, and the consideration of future 
generations, on the other, and on how we can achieve a fairer 
distribution between rich and poor countries. It is an important 
debate--and it has caught the attention of many. When working 
with the World Commission report, ``Our common future,'' this 
was an important question which has now become a focal point in 
the international debate following, among other things, the Rio 
conference. 
  Growing production and demand is not in itself a measure of 
the increasing wealth of a society. Growth has been necessary to 
develop our welfare society, and growth is still necessary to 
meet new, important social challenges. Growth can even be 
necessary to meet environmental challenges. It is not true that 
the slower the rate of economic growth or the lower the increase 
in consumer demand, the more productive the growth is. It is the 
kind of growth that is important. Much of the economic growth 
during the last decades, as it is measured, is related to an 
increased percentage of people being employed, especially among 
women. An important precondition for this was the expansion of 
public services, not least in the areas of health, education and 
day care. 
  In the government's long term plan the prognosis for the 
Norwegian economy for the next 40 years has been presented. The 
economic growth as outlined in this plan is much lower than what 
we have become used to during most of the time period since 
World War II. However, many people still think it is 
unreasonable that we want to increase our prosperity from the 
already high level of today. In this case it is important to 
realize that one-half to two-thirds of the estimated economic 
growth up through the year 2000 is caused by an increased level 
of knowledge and improved organization in production. With such 
a development, in which there is a considerable increase in the 
level of knowledge and in which we utilize the technological 
capability that is being developed both nationally and 
internationally, it will be increasingly possible to combine an 
increase in the creation of wealth with an improved environment. 
It has been estimated that many of the environmentally harmful 
emissions will decrease in the coming 40-year period, in spite 
of increased growth. 
  Norwegian industrial concerns are now producing more than 
ever before, using less energy and raw materials per produced 
unit, and the production pattern has changed. In a market that 
just 20 to 30 years ago was dominated by industrial output like 
iron, metals, fertilizer, and cellulose that was not highly 
processed, we have today a broader and more modern industry 
that, among other things, is able to build and equip large and 
complicated oil installations in the Norwegian territorial 
section. 
  Just before the war almost 65 percent of labor was spent on 
the production of goods and materials. Today almost 70 percent 
of employees work in the service industry. These changes involve 
a change also in the use of energy, in the use of natural 
resources, and in the stress caused by both production and 
demand on the environment. Growth of services means less stress 
on the environment than does growth in the demand of goods and 
materials. 
  From 1980 to today private demand for services has grown by 
40 percent, while demand for manufactured goods has increased by 
only 7 percent. This shows how the pattern of demand has 
changed. With the kind of policy we have prepared we will see a 
continued shift in consumer demand. There will be more growth in 
the service sector and less in the production of goods. 
Increasingly more people will work in the fields of health and 
welfare; in schools, education, and research; and in cultural 
areas. Even though we, compared to most countries, invest a 
considerable amount of resources in these areas, there is no 
doubt in my mind but that we should increase our efforts even 
more in coming years. 
  Such a development will also be seen in the way we measure 
growth in our economy. Growth by itself is not a goal, but a 
means to meeting important and urgent challenges in the future. 
According to the estimate of the Long Term Plan both private and 
public demand will increase in coming years. Growth of private 
demand will be caused by more people being employed than today, 
by employees being more productive and by retirees having larger 
pensions. We might be able to increase the production of goods 
without a corresponding increase in the number of jobs or in the 
number of working hours. However, to improve the range of 
services offered and to meet the increased need in this area, we 
must plan on an increased need for more labor. An increasing 
number of people will be working in the field of health, with 
the elderly and in education. Some people are still maintaining 
that we should reduce the number of hours worked and lower the 
retirement age. Should we do this, it would result in lower 
economic growth and fewer of the problems we see ahead would be 
solved. 
  It is very important that we engage in becoming involved in 
reducing the disparity between the economic and social 
development in our part of the world and the poverty and the 
need in developing countries. But--it is not the case that 
reduced growth in Norway simply will result in an increased 
capacity to alleviate need and poverty in developing countries. 
On the other hand, it is important that we can turn growth in an 
environmentally sound direction. Indeed, Norway does not have an 
especially high private demand compared to other industrialized 
countries, but we give the most aid per capita to developing 
countries. 
  In dealing with the environment there are limits to how far 
each individual country can go alone without running the risk of 
jobs being eliminated or moved out of the country. Norway is a 
pioneering country when it comes to, among other things, using 
fees and taxes to steer production and demand in a productive 
direction. To make further progress it is first and foremost 
necessary to coordinate this effort with other countries. Making 
it increasingly costly for business to pollute will reduce the 
stress on the environment, while at the same time encourage 
developing better and more environmentally friendly work-sharing 
practices among countries and improve the pattern of production 
within each individual country. However, we must realize that 
the one-sided use of measures in Norway only will not have the 
desired effect, either in the effort to improve the environment 
or in the effort to even out the differences between rich and 
poor countries. Are we to succeed, we will need obligatory 
commitments to working together among the various countries.

  [Text] The contents of a draft report the government plans 
to submit at the UN "International Conference on Population and 
Development" (ICPD), which is to be held this September in 
Cairo, was revealed on 1 March. In the report, the government 
touches on such issues as population trends and reduced birth 
rates. Regarding environmental hazards brought about by 
population growth concentrated in particular regions, the 
government concludes that "A high standard of education has 
enabled the nation to overcome such problems rather quickly." 
However, the government completely fails to touch on 
environmental issues which large cities face, such as huge 
amounts of garbage and air pollution. This stance is expected 
to cause a stir, inasmuch as the main theme of the Cairo 
conference includes "population, development, and environment." 
  The government's draft report consists of 17 pages of text 
divided into four major sections: 
  1) population trends and future outlook; 
  2) current situation regarding government policies related 
to 
population trends; 
  3) international cooperation regarding population issues; 
and 
  4) summary and conclusion. 
  Seven sets of graphical data, such as that showing trends in 
average lifespans, are also included in the draft report. 
  Regarding problems resulting from population movements 
within 
the nation, the government, in the report, refers to the cases 
of Tokyo, Osaka, and Kyoto as examples. It points out that in 
these cities, "the population began growing in the 1960's due to 
the development of heavy chemical industries and the urban 
living environment rapidly deteriorated." It adds that the 
nation "was able to proceed with economic development in harmony 
with environmental preservation, after succeeding in overcoming 
population, developmental, and environmental crises rather 
quickly through public support and government efforts." 
  In the report, the government contends that the nation was 
able to overcome such crises due to "an especially high standard 
of education." It adds that "putting emphasis on education and 
the government's effective use of information play an invaluable 
role in international efforts to help developing countries with 
their population problems." 
  In Tokyo and other major cities, the problem of securing 
garbage disposal sites has become very serious. Nitrogen oxide 
emissions accompanying the sharp increase in automobile traffic 
have led to air pollution. The government fails to take up 
these issues in its draft report. In this regard, an official 
of the Health and Welfare Ministry explained: "It is impossible 
to cover all population-related issues, and there is also a 
limit to the report's length." 
  However, greater interest has been shown in developing 
countries concerning air pollution and garbage issues because 
recently, the environment has been deteriorating in these 
countries due to a rapidly growing population concentrated in 
cities.

  [Text] The government, which will begin providing the 
fourth yen-based loan to China in 1996, has decided to give 
priority to measures for tackling environmental problems, the 
development of inland regions, and projects for upgrading 
infrastructures which could serve the people's livelihood. The 
government will send a fact-finding team composed of 
working-level officials to China on 7 March to survey the 
possibility of implementing the projects by area. Based on the 
results of the survey, Prime Minister Hosokawa will notify the 
Chinese side of Japan's basic plan for the fourth yen-based loan 
when he visits China on 19 March. As for the size of the fourth 
yen-based loan which has become a focal point, the prime 
minister will not present the Chinese side with the size because 
of a delay in China's formal request for the loan. The two 
countries are expected to continue coordination of their views 
on the size for an accord within this year. 
  The fact-finding team, which will leave Japan on 7 March, is 
made up of officials from the Foreign Ministry, the Finance 
Ministry, the Ministry of International Trade and Industry, the 
Economic Planning Agency, and other officials from the Overseas 
Economic Cooperation Fund (OECF). It will examine the 
feasibility of about 70 projects presented unofficially by China 
from the standpoint of providing the fourth yen-based loan to 
China as a "symbolic loan" to finance the projects for 
Japan-China cooperation," (according to Foreign Minister Hata). 
  For the project for tackling environmental problems, a 
centerpiece of the fourth yen-based loan, the government is 
likely to incorporate aid for measures to tackle acid rain that 
would "eventually benefit" Japan. Taking seriously a conspicuous 
delay in China's measures to deal with pollution resulting from 
that country's rapid industrialization, the government plans to 
provide China with Japan's advanced desulfurization facilities 
in the fourth yen-based loan that serve to prevent air and water 
pollution. 
  Japan and China are presently studying the possibility of 
reviewing China's reform and open up policy that places its 
priority on production-related facilities and the development of 
coastal regions and of providing preferentially funds for 
industrial development in inland regions. 
  China has asked for Japan's cooperation for construction of 
a 
Beijing-Shanghai bullet train line and the fact-finding team 
will examine the demand for inter-city traffic. The government 
plans to continue Japan's aid in the fourth yen-based loan for 
priority projects for construction of water supply facilities 
and sewages which were implemented under the first, second, and 
third yen-based loans to China to help it improve people's 
livelihood. 
  The Japanese Government explains that Prime Minister 
Hosokawa 
will present the Chinese side with Japan's basic plan for the 
fourth yen-based loan, but will not present it with the size of 
the loan because China has yet to make a formal request for the 
loan following a delay in its domestic procedures and the 
failure of working-level Japanese and Chinese officials to 
finalize details of the loan. 
  Japan started providing China with 330.9 billion yen in the 
first yen-based loan for 1979-1984 and expanded to 800 billion 
yen in the third yen-based loan for 1990-1995. It has been 
decided that duration of the fourth yen-based loan will be 
shortened to three years out of concern over expansion of 
China's military buildup.

  [Text] Tirana, 22 March (ATA) -- The German Government 
decided to take back four tons of German expired pesticides 
which are in Albania since 1992 and which are presenting a 
threat to the environment. 
  Federal minister of environment and protection of nature, 
Claus Tefer, said at a press release that "as far as I know the 
pesticides have been illegally exported to Albania. There 
derives no obligation to take them back. But we accept that it 
is an inheritance from the unification of the two Germanies. In 
order to avoid grave consequences in the foreign policy, we 
shall make a human gesture by taking the pesticides back." 
  The pesticides have been brought in barrels on a train to 
Albania in March 1992 and have been centred mostly in the border 
railway station of Bajze, near Shkoder. Among the pesticides, 
according to specialists, there is toxaphene whose usage has 
been banned in the European Union countries since 10 years ago. 
"The death train," as the Albanian press refers to it, has come 
to Albania as an humanitarian aid from the "Schmidt Cretan GmbH" 
company of Hanover. As time has passed, the pesticides have 
ruined the barrels and leaked on the ground, thus threatening 
for polluting the Shkoder Lake, which borders Albania and 
Montenegro. 
  The German Government has planned to take the pesticides 
back 
by sea within May.

  [Text] Silistra, March 16 (BTA) -- The tenth session of the 
Mixed Bulgarian Romanian Commission on Environmental Problems in 
the Silistra-Calarasi Region, held in Calarasi, decided to 
propose to the environment ministries of the two countries, to 
introduce Western European standards in environment monitoring 
in Bulgaria and Romania, Dr. Marin Peychev, director of the 
Hygiene and Epidemiology Institute in Silistra, told BTA. 
  In the almost ten-month break in the work of the commission, 
the Romanians managed to replace over 80 percent of the 
purification installations of the metallurgical combined works 
in Calarasi which reduced phenol, hydrogen sulphide and dust 
emissions. The Bulgarian Institute of Hygiene, Medical 
Environment and Nutrition carried out joint research with a 
similar Romanian institute. The Romanian side showed interest 
in environment related diseases incidence. The Bulgarian side 
presented the required information and research methods. The 
measurements taken in January and February in Bulgaria have 
shown lower concentrations of pollutants against the same period 
last year.

  [Text] Ruse, March 16 (BTA) -- The Intergovernmental 
Bulgarian-Romanian Commission on Environmental Protection opened 
its first working session in Ruse (on the Danube) this morning. 
The delegations are led by Bulgaria's Deputy Environment 
Minister Khristo Dalchev and Romania's State Secretary of the 
Ministry of Waters, Forestry and Environmental Protection Ioan 
Jelev [name as received]. Projects on an improvement of the 
technological and technical condition of industrial facilities 
and the integrated system of environment monitoring and control 
in the areas of Silistra and Calarasi, Ruse and Giurgiu, and 
Nikopol and Turnu Magurele were on the agenda. This is the 
first in a series of working meetings on a joint programme of 
environmental protection in the Danube area. 
  The European Commission is ready to assist the 
Bulgarian-Romanian integrated environment programme in the 
shared section of the River Danube, Mr. Dalchev said. 
  He has received a letter from Mr. Alan Mayhew, head of a 
working group with the commission, who welcomes the memorandum 
signed in Giurgiu on December 27, 1993 by the Bulgarian and the 
Romanian environment ministers. Mr. Mayhew was expressly 
informed of the Ruse meeting of the mixed commission and 
believes that it would be useful for the sides to agree on a way 
in which the process of bilateral cooperation would be 
facilitated with the help of the PHARE [Economic and 
Reconstruction Aid for Poland and Hungary] Programme. Mr. 
Mayhew suggests future trilateral meetings between 
representatives of Bulgaria, Romania and the Commission. Mr. 
Dalchev said that he was not only inspired with hope by this 
first EU reaction to the memorandum but was also confident of 
positive results in the future.

<F P=106> [Tanya Tsekova report: "Kozloduy: Problems, Assets"] </F>
  [Text] Sofia, March 4 (BTA) -- Bulgaria's Kozloduy Nuclear 
Power Plant on the Danube has an installed capacity of 3,760 
megawatts (MW). On-line facilities have a capacity of 2,400 MW. 
Two of the N-plant's six reactors are under repair. Radiation 
control is exercised by an automated control system and a 
special unit controlling radiation outside the system. 
According to staff, safety meets world standards while 
generation is much cleaner than at thermal or hydroelectric 
facilities, said a BTA reporter who visited the plant. No 
serious industrial accident occurred in the plant last year. 
  Now the facility generates half of the electricity the 
nation 
needs in winter, with its cost being 0.42 leva/kilowatthour, or 
half the cost of electricity generated by other energy sources. 
Radioactive discharges in the area of the plant are 
substantially lower than the acceptable limits. 
  Construction of the N-plant began in 1968 and the period 
from 
1974 to 1982 saw the successive startups of the first four VVER 
440 reactors. The 1,000 MW Units Five and Six joined the power 
grid in respectively 1987 and 1992. Now Unit One is functioning 
at 96 percent of capacity, Unit Two is undergoing a scheduled 
overhaul and being refueled, Unit Three is functioning at full 
capacity, Unit Four at 55 percent and Unit Six at 95 percent. 
Unit Five is also being overhauled. 
  The N-plant now has a staff of 5,600, with 4,000 operating 
the reactors. A staffing problem does not exist, argues the 
management. Just a couple of years ago the N-plant was 
understaffed and facing training problems. At Unit One and in 
the machine hall, where she was admitted, the BTA reporter met 
and talked with serious, intelligent young people. Engineers 
are being paid between 12,000 and 25,000 leva a month, which 
compares favorably with a minimum monthly wage in this country 
of 1,400 leva. 
  The area around the plant likely to be worse hit by an 
accident includes 43 population centres with a population of 
100,000. Emergency plans outline a 3-kilometre, a 12-kilometre 
and a 30-kilometre zones. According to the local boss of Civil 
Defence, emergency plans are updated on an annual basis and the 
personnel receives training periodically. Population in the 
30-kilometre area surrounding the plant is provided with 
protection equipment for home use. Since 1993 the plant has an 
accident management centre and a new automated radiation control 
system transmitting data to this centre and to the Committee for 
Peaceful Atomic Energy Uses and the Civil Defence Staff in 
Sofia. According to the engineer on duty at the oldest Unit 
One, eight seconds are needed to bring a reaction under control 
in case of accident in the nuclear reactor. This is achieved by 
four automated emergency systems switching on consecutively. A 
reaction can also be brought under control manually by the 
unit's operator on duty. 
  A new programme should be drawn for the overhaul of the 
first 
four units. The upgrading of each would cost between $30 and 
$40 million, according to preliminary estimates. The money 
should be sought abroad, as this year the government has 
budgeted only about 0.5 million leva (now the exchange rate is 
38 leva to the dollar). The budgeted funds would be merely 
enough for current repairs, said manager Kusma Kuzmanov. 
According to him, the oldest Units One and Two were designed to 
last up to the year 2003, according to Soviet standards in the 
1960's, and despite numerous repairs and improvements need 
constant monitoring. Experts have detected metal hull faults, 
which are being studied. If the results of the study, financed 
by EC, are unfavorable, the units will have to be switched off 
in two or three years. 
  Waste storage is the focus of attention by management and 
the 
National Electricity Company (the nation's power utility). 
Until the breakup of the Communist bloc, waste was shipped to 
the former Soviet Union, which also supplied nuclear fuel. Now, 
however, Russia demands heavy charges for waste treatment. 
Ukraine would like to be paid for trans-shipment via its 
territory. The National Electricity Company is looking for 
solutions to the nuclear waste problem. About 400 tons of fuel 
waste are stored at a Kozloduy depot which will have enough 
store room to last through mid-1995. The N-plant management 
hopes to have a radioactive waste treatment plant on line by 
that time, making waste fit for burial. The project has stuck 
at a technology-assessment stage. Half of the technology is 
Bulgarian, half to be provided by Westinghouse. The waste 
treatment plant and storage facility will be located on the 
territory of the N-plant. This decision has triggered protests 
by local environmentalists. They argue it would be dangerous to 
locate a nuclear waste depot in the proximity of the River 
Danube. 
  According to an official of Ecoglasnost, the environmental 
group, the amounts of strontium and cesium found in the soil 
around the plant are negligible. Samples of Danube water 
upstream from Kozloduy often have a higher level of 
radioactivity than samples taken downstream, according to the 
N-plant safety boss. 
  International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) officials have 
visited the N-plant on several occasions and given a positive 
assessment of the plant after the overhauls.

  [Text] Jihlava, South Moravia, March 23 (CTK) -- The Hnuti 
Duha (Rainbow Movement) environmental group has issued an appeal 
against the granting of a construction permit for a temporary 
store of radioactive waste on the grounds of the Dukovany 
nuclear power plant, Martin Sedlacek from Hnuti Duha told CTK. 
  The organization is requesting that the project be postponed 
until its main investor has supplied some missing information, 
Sedlacek added. 
  Hnuti Duha has notified the Czech Economics Ministry that 
the 
containers in which the nuclear waste is to be temporarily 
stored have not been licensed in Germany where they were 
produced. According to the Duha organization, which is one of 
the participants in the process, the exact means of waste 
disposal in the project should be demonstrated now during the 
selection of an investor, rather than after he has been chosen. 
  Hnuti Duha also disagrees with the exclusion of Dukovany 
district representatives in participating in the project's 
selection process. 
  The construction permit was granted by the regional office 
in 
Trebic, south Moravia, on 1 March. Other participants in the 
selection process have until the end of this week to issue their 
own appeals. After a period of administrative negotiation the 
Czech Economics Ministry will rule on the appeals.

  [Text] Spindleruv Mlyn, East Bohemia, March 19 (CTK) -- 
Czech Prime Minister Vaclav Klaus said on Saturday [19 March] 
that the Ministry of the Environment and the work of Environment 
Minister Frantisek Benda were lacking in concept. 
  At a press conference during a meeting of the Executive 
Council of Klaus' Civic Democratic Party (ODS), the prime 
minister said he would therefore begin "fundamental discussions" 
with the Christian Democratic Party (KDS) on solving the 
problems in this area. Benda is a member of the KDS. 
  Following the dismissal of Deputy Environment Minister Petr 
Gandalovic (ODS), the ODS has lost contact with this ministry, 
Klaus said. 
  The Executive Council also appointed a committee to draft a 
bill which would set a final limit on who would be eligible to 
receive compensation for suffering endured during the communist 
period. 
  ODS Chairman and Czech Prime Minister Vaclav Klaus 
emphasized 
that the matter did not mean the end of general restitution of 
property. 
  The committee will be headed by ODS Vice Chairman Jiri 
Vlach. 
  Klaus said the number of cases concerning the redress of the 
most serious grievances had passed its limit. "I fear that by 
drawing things out extensively, we could reach the absurd 
conclusion that every citizen was aggrieved during his life 
under the communist regime," he said.
