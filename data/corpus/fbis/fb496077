    [Editorial Report] The following is a compilation of 
reports on environmental issues monitored through 10 March. 
  BRAZIL 
  At least five areas of the country, totalling more than 
115,000 square kilometers, are experiencing desertification. 
According to Sao Paulo University Professor Jose Bueno Conti, 
the most critical areas are in the northeastern part of the 
country. The largest area, which includes Bahia, Piaui, Ceara, 
Pernambuco, Alagoas, and Sergipe States, is nearly 100,000 
square kilometers, almost two and a half times the area of Rio 
de Janeiro. The desertification also affects the municipality of 
Alegrete, in the southern part of Rio Grande do Sul State, the 
municipality of Paranavai, Parana State, and Roraima State. (Rio 
de Janeiro JORNAL DO BRASIL in Portuguese 13 Feb 94 p 7) 
  Brazil and the African countries are vying for attention in 
the international convention on desertification that will be 
signed in Paris in June. This so-called convention of the poor 
alludes to those conventions on climate changes and biodiversity 
agreed on during the Rio 92 environmental conference. The 
convention on desertification involves international financial 
aid and technological support. (Rio de Janeiro JORNAL DO BRASIL 
in Portuguese 6 Mar 94 p 21)

  [Text] Fortaleza -- Environment Minister Rubens Ricupero 
said on 9 March that the desertification problem in Brazil is 
more serious than the devastation in the Amazon region because 
it affects a larger number of people -- at least 18 million 
residents of northeastern Brazil. Ricupero recommended: 
"People sometimes get more emotional over the forest because it 
is more spectacular. We also want the industrialized nations to 
give the same attention to arid and semi-arid areas." 
  Ricupero participated on 9 March in the opening ceremony of 
the Latin American Seminar on Desertification. The minister 
today will propose to Bo Kjellen, the Desertification Convention 
Negotiations Intergovernmental Committee chairman, to avoid 
implementing an approach "merely based on providing assistance" 
and provide support for the development of the population living 
in the areas affected by this problem. Ricupero noted: "Even 
though we admit that the priority is Africa, the most affected 
continent, we want the donating countries' commitment to Latin 
America to be mandatory." 
  According to Ricupero, overcoming desertification in Latin 
America will require expenditures totaling $2 billion. The 
minister said the outcome of the National Conference on 
Desertification, which ended on 9 March, will manifest to our 
country "a problem of which the people have thus far been 
unaware" and yield contributions for the National 
Antidesertification Program. Ricupero said: "We want to define 
this policy, which does not exist yet in either Brazil or most 
Latin American countries, with the exception of Mexico." 
Delegates from the interested countries have to draw up a 
proposal for Latin America by 11 March.

<F P=106> [Report by Hemi Shalev] </F>
  [Text] There is tension between Israel and the United 
States as a result of the United States' having supported Egypt 
yesterday in its demand that the handling of nuclear waste be 
put on the agenda of the multinational talks on environment 
issues being held in The Hague. 
  As a result of diplomatic contacts between Washington and 
Jerusalem and following a telephone conversation between Foreign 
Minister Shim'on Peres and U.S. Secretary of State Warren 
Christopher, the secretary agreed to modify the Egyptian demand 
and support a multinational discussion of issues relating only 
to regional legislation on handling nuclear waste. 
  Christopher accepted Israel's position that Egypt's charges 
that Israel is mishandling nuclear waste should be broached by 
the two countries on a bilateral level and not at the 
multinational talks. 
  The Egyptian demand is part of the very energetic campaign 
regarding Israel's nuclear ability which Egypt is waging at the 
multinational talks on armament issues as well. Two days ago, 
before The Hague talks started, the Egyptians warned they would 
boycott the talks if their demand to discuss nuclear waste is 
not accepted. They changed their mind only after the United 
States intervened. 
  Last night, Israeli sources expressed concern over the U.S. 
support -- partial though it may be -- for the Egyptian stand. 
  The sources said that ever since the new U.S. Administration 
came into power, there has been a constant threat of conflict 
between it and Israel in view of Washington's determined policy 
on nuclear nonproliferation. Because of the close U.S.-Israeli 
contacts, the issue has not come up yet.

<F P=106> [Matthew Kaminski article: "East Counts Cost of a Dirty </F>
Legacy"] 
  [Text] The Soviet army may be withdrawing from eastern 
Europe but it has left behind an ecological mess. The bill for 
the cleanup operation will be staggering. 
  Estonia, Latvia, and Lithuania are currently sizing up the 
fallout from 50 years of sloppiness at more than 1,000 former 
Soviet military facilities. This legacy of Soviet rule, ranging 
from nuclear waste to water pollution, should keep policy 
planners and eco-businesses busy for years. 
  Soviet pilots, for instance, would regularly dump jet fuel 
on 
the ground to minimise flying hours. At the Tapa military air 
base in Estonia, 16 sq km are polluted by jet fuel, 7 meters 
deep in some places. 
  At most Soviet airfields in the Baltic region -- as in east 
Germany and the Czech Republic -- waste fuel, while not toxic, 
has seeped into the region's shallow natural groundwater 
reserves and raised purification costs. 
  The World Bank has examined the damage at Latvia's Tukums 
air 
force base, and is considering funding cleanup programmes. 
Environment Canada, a government agency, has offered to train 
Latvians in site remediation and assessment. But institutional 
lenders have yet to commit substantial funds to cleanup efforts. 
  Meanwhile Baltec, a private Latvian company, has begun a 
bioremediation project at Tukums. Over five years, it plans to 
pump out the jet fuel, some of which can be salvaged and resold, 
and put bacteria into the soil to break down the remaining fuel. 
  Inspectors previously barred from secret sites are finding 
other and more worrying surprises. Near Zvarde, an eastern 
Latvian town, more than 24,000 hectares of farmland were 
confiscated for air target practice. The land was returned to 
Latvia after independence, leaving a trail of pollution, 
deforestation and unexploded bombs after 30 years of daily 
bombing sorties. 
  Peteris Elfers, a member of parliament, estimates that 
demining might take another 30 years. "It has to be done," he 
says, "but we don't have the technology to do it well." An 
inspection last summer found 364 bombs, mines and rockets after 
examining just the main bombing polygon of 159 hectares -- and 
only cursorily to a depth of 20 cm. 
  Deadly waste understandably raises more eyebrows. In 
Sillamae, a closed military city on Estonia's north-eastern 
coast, a classified chemical combine has left a 20 meter high 
dam that contains, according to Murray Feshbach, an expert on 
the Soviet environment at Georgetown University in the U.S., 4 
million tonnes of uranium ore, 1,200 tonnes of pure uranium, 
1,000 tonnes of radium, 800 tonnes of thorium, plus 2 million 
tonnes of calcium sulphide oil shale ash and some ground 
radioactivity. 
  In a big storm, this could go into the nearby Gulf of 
Finland 
and directly affect the Baltic rim countries. Feshbach says one 
safety measure, so far not carried out, would be to encase the 
dam in cement. 
  Nuclear waste pockets have also been discovered across the 
Baltic hinterlands. Last summer in Lithuania, radioactive 
equipment dumped at a landfill in Zokniai, an airfield near 
Siulinae, produced alarming geiger readings. 
  Paldiski, a big submarine base in Estonia, has two nuclear 
reactors, a depository for liquid waste, another for solid waste 
and underground pipelines for radioactive sewage. In troop 
withdrawal talks, Russia has agreed to give up the base, remove 
the nuclear fuel rods and take care of waste and the necessary 
cleanup. What should be done with the 600 tonnes of liquid 
waste and the two reactors is unclear. 
  Estonia, which has a fiercely nationalistic government, 
worries about the proposed length of a Russian cleanup presence 
until 2000. 
  It may look west for help instead, says Alar Olljum, a 
foreign ministry spokesman. 
  But Feshbach worries more about dimethylhydrazine, also 
called heptyl, a liquid rocket fuel that is supertoxic, 
volatile, carcinogenic and nerve paralysing. Around 270 tonnes 
-- of the estimated 150,000 tonnes in the former Soviet Union 
have been found around Ventspils, a large Latvian port city. 
"There is no known technology to get rid of it," says Feshbach. 
"The cheapest way is to fire it from rockets." 
  However, Harry Whitacker, chief of emergency engineering at 
Environment Canada, hopes heptyl can be turned into ammonia or 
methanol by using ultraviolet light and peroxide in an advanced 
oxidation process; and nitric acid, once pumped to the surface, 
could be converted to fertiliser if mixed with ammonium and [as 
published] hydroxide. 
On the Baltic Sea shore, military harbours have been left in a 
pitiable state. At Liepaja, a top Soviet Baltic Fleet base, the 
harbour floor polluted by heavy metals and crude oil a metre 
deep, needs to be dredged. 
  Just off the coast sit sunken battleship hulls, stripped of 
non-ferrous iron. Nearby are submarines which used batteries 
leaving semi-toxic residue potentially dangerous if built up 
over time. Cleanup would be expensive, but a World Bank 
official says the spectacular site of pilfered Soviet warships 
might be a profitable tourist site. 
  The bank has made the conversion of Liepaja from a military 
into a commercial centre a priority project in the belief that 
the city's large port could be a key trans-shipment point to and 
from the Russian market. The bank has obtained the Latvian 
government's commitment to support a project of water treatment, 
coastal management and tourism. Environment Canada would handle 
the military pollution. 
  Like any economically depressed nation, however, Latvia must 
make hard choices on pollution cleanup. A clear economic 
incentive is needed to secure funding. 
  Symbolic cost estimates have been presented to Russia, the 
inheritor of the Soviet army. Latvia has sent Moscow a $147m 
(99m pounds) bill for land use and anticipated cleanup. 
Realistically, however, the Balts do not expect Russia to pay.

  [Text] Alamaty (Kazakhstan), 1 Apr -- Kazakh President 
Nursultan Nazarbayev granted an interview to MAINICHI SHIMBUN on 
1 April and spoke about his expectations of his upcoming visit 
to Japan, which is scheduled to start on 6 April, as well as 
about his appeals concerning the disasters caused by nuclear 
exposure at the Semipalantinsk nuclear testing center and the 
serious environmental destruction caused by the continued drying 
up of the Aral Sea. 
  According to the president, 527 nuclear tests have been 
conducted at Semipalantinsk since 1949, and there are about half 
a million nuclear exposure victims. Even now, many cases of 
diseases or deaths caused by nuclear exposure are reported 
continuously, and psychological damage such as fear among 
pregnant women has continued. 
  However, the facts about the scale and frequency of nuclear 
tests have been veiled in secrecy. There are many unsolved 
questions, including the future effects of plutonium which has 
been stored in the earth. 
  The president severely criticized nuclear tests in the area 
of Semipalantinsk as "criminal acts committed by the [former] 
Soviet Union." On the other hand, he expressed the hope that 
Japan, which experienced atomic bombings at Hiroshima and 
Nagasaki, will cooperate with his country in the work to aid 
nuclear test victims. 
  The environmental destruction of the Aral Sea began in the 
1960's. Currently, three-quarters of the lake have dried up, 
and many residents have been left in the desert. Moreover, 
because a huge amount of salt has emerged on the surface in this 
area, there is a possibility that this will greatly affect the 
earth as a whole. The president, who has proposed an 
international conference on the Aral Sea issue, called for 
Japan's positive participation. 
  Touching on his idea of creating a Eurasian union, the 
president pointed out: "More than 300 mutual agreements have 
been adopted since the inauguration of the CIS. No practical 
results have been achieved, however." In stating his criticism, 
the president added, "Some CIS members have rejected some of 
these agreements and have interpreted the concepts of agreements 
according to their own interests." He stated that in following 
the good example of the European Union (EU), a new union should 
be formed composed of only those states which are determined to 
abide by all the mutual agreements, while the system of 
admitting quasimembers should be abolished.

  [Text] Vilnius, March 31 -- Polish Minister of 
Environmental Protection, Natural Resources and Forestry 
Stanislaw Zelichowski and General Director of the Department for 
Environmental Protection of Lithuania Evaldas Vebra signed in 
Vilnius on Thursday a plan of cooperation between the two 
ministries for the years 1994-1995. 
  The plan provides for cooperation in environment monitoring, 
environmental protection in border regions as well as control 
and counteracting illegal transborder transport of waste. 
  During his two day official visit, the Polish minister was 
received by Lithuanian Prime Minister Adolfas Slezevicius, held 
talks at the Ministry of Forestry and met with the main 
geologist of the Republic of Lithuania. 
  Asked during a press conference whether the two sides 
discussed the Ignalina nuclear power plant which posed threat to 
natural environment not only in Lithuania, the Polish minister 
said they spoke about possibilities of cooperation in all fields. 
  Zelichowski said Poland had a modern monitoring system which 
would make it possible to detect any danger two hours after a 
break-down in the power plant. 
  Vebra stressed the signed plan of cooperation provides for 
cooperation in radiation monitoring.

<F P=106> [Unattributed article: "Energy: Renewable Sources of </F>
Energy Gaining Ground in EU"; as released by Brussels EUROPE 
ENVIRONMENT in English] 
  [Text] In 1992, the European Union turned out 43.6 million 
tonnes of oil equivalent (toe) of renewable sources of energy, 
according to the EU's Statistical Office. Eurostat's energy 
figures released on March 7, which include, for the first time, 
data on renewable energy -- solar, geothermal, wind, 
hydro-power, and biomass -- show that renewable accounted for 
6.7 percent of total primary energy production in 1992. 
Although still a very small proportion of the overall energy 
balance, this figure is a marked improvement on the less than 5 
percent share that renewable sources held in the mid-1980s. 
<H5>  "Green Energy" </H5>
  Renewable energy consumption accounted for 3.5 percent of 
gross inland energy consumption in 1992, notes Eurostat. 
Households consumed 16.2 million toe of biomass (wood, wood 
waste, municipal solid waste and biogas), particularly wood, 
which represents roughly 7 percent of their final energy 
consumption. Hydro-power (13.8 million toe) made up 8.2 percent 
of total electricity production. France is the biggest producer, 
turning out 5.9 million toe. Denmark was the biggest producer of 
wind energy (78,000 toe). But this was a mere 0.06 percent of 
total EU electricity production. 
  Gross inland consumption by all energy sources followed the 
same trend as in recent years: coal down, oil stable and 
natural gas up. Total consumption for each source was: hard 
coal 15.6 percent, lignite 5.2 percent, oil 43.5 percent and 
natural gas 18.6 percent, thermal energy produced in nuclear 
power stations 13.6 percent and renewable energy 3.5 percent. 
The EU's dependence on energy imports was still 50 percent. 
  A separate set of figures just out from Eurostat shows 
further decline in EU coal industry in 1993. Output of hard 
coal fell even faster between 1992 and 1993 as a result of the 
crisis in the steel industry and particularly low import prices. 
It fell by some 26 million tonnes or 14 percent to 158.6 
million tonnes. This compares with an 8.4 million drop (4.3 
percent) between 1991 and 1992. Demand from both steel and power 
industries fell, perhaps by as much as over 20 million tonnes at 
EU level. This resulted in falls in imports from non-EU 
countries.

<F P=106> [Unattributed article: "Parliament Concerned About </F>
Pesticide Exports to Albania Under PHARE Programme"; as released 
by Brussels Textline database] 
  [Text] The Parliament adopted a resolution of the EPP Group 
amended by the Greens on exports of pesticides by the European 
Union to Albania under the PHARE [Economic Reconstruction Aid 
Program to Poland and Hungary] programme. It invited the 
European Commission and all bodies responsible for the 
implementation of the PHARE programme to intervene immediately 
to withdraw toxic pesticides from the market and asked that a 
study be undertaken making it possible to identify those 
responsible for the destruction of the ecological balance of the 
regions concerned. It is demanding that the Commission prepare 
a report with the detailed description and amount of aid granted 
to date to Albania by the Community in the framework of the 
PHARE programme, particularly with regard to the agricultural 
dimension. It is also asking the Commission to submit 
Commission projects to it on forthcoming aid to be granted. On 
behalf of the Commission, Sir Leon Brittan indicated that the 
stock of pesticides in Albania currently amounted to 3500 
tonnes. Some 500 tonnes, of which 214 tonnes benefiting from 
PHARE programme support, are products of high quality that meet 
Community standards and from the countries of the European 
Union. The rest was not manufactured in the Community or 
supplied with its aid. Albania using little pesticide, only 60 
tonnes could be placed on the market, the remainder reexported 
to the producers or destroyed, which is proving to be difficult 
for part of it, the destruction technology not yet being safe. 
The cost of destruction would amount to almost 2.7 million 
Ecus. The Commission and the Albanian authorities are currently 
studying these two possibilities, said the Commissioner. Mr. 
Graefe zu Baringdorf (German Green) regarded as scandalous that 
the estimated cost of destruction amounted to 2.7 million Ecus 
whereas the aid supplied to the agricultural sector under the 
PHARE programme is only 3 million Ecus.

<F P=106> [Science Correspondent Robin McKie report: "Toxic Cocktail </F>
Poisoning North Sea"] 
  [Text] Efforts to protect the North Sea from devastating 
pollution have failed. A shocking report on the quality of its 
water is to be discussed in Denmark next month by European 
Ministers, but the outline of the report has already been 
accepted. 
  The Quality Status Report, drawn up by scientists from eight 
nations -- Britain, France, Belgium, Germany, the Netherlands, 
Denmark, Norway and Sweden -- says chemicals such as 
hexachlorocyclohexane (HCH), polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) 
and tributyl tin (TBT) have reached alarming levels. Discharges 
of pesticides, oil and poisonous metals -- such as cadmium -- 
have risen unchecked and pose disturbing problems. 
  "More stringent goals and measures are urgently needed," 
says 
the report: only radical action will halt a decline that is 
turning the sea into the waste dump of northern Europe. 
  The measures to be discussed by Ministers will include 
drastically reducing the use of the fertilisers now leaching 
into rivers; halting industrial pollution; and stopping the 
overfishing of cod, haddock, sand eels and sprats. 
  Such moves would, however, also have a dramatic impact on 
farming, fishing and manufacturing throughout the northern 
countries of the European Union. Fertilisers are used to 
sustain high agricultural yields and anti-pollution controls 
would make factories more expensive to run, while fishing often 
provides the only income for many communities around the North 
Sea. 
  Discussion of the report could be protracted. Nevertheless, 
the eight nations are committed to reducing by 1995 emissions 
that are killing the sea. This gives Ministers little time to 
act. 
  The report admits: "It is expected that the goal of a 50 per 
cent reduction in inputs of nitrogen (from fertilisers) to 
potential problem areas will not be realised by 1995." 
Additional measures and better controls are therefore urgent, 
it concludes. 
  Other problems it raises are: 
  -- High concentrations of cadmium now being found in liver 
tissue of fish from the central North Sea; 
  -- discharges of fertilisers producing algal blooms, which 
starve fish of oxygen and are making many beaches and swimming 
areas dangerous; 
  -- uncontrolled emissions of chemicals by the oil industry, 
from leaks and flaring operations; 
  -- and the urgent need to ban tributyl tin (TBT), used in 
anti-fouling paints and known to cause deformities in oysters, 
whelks and other shellfish. 
  The report concludes that, although scientists have 
uncovered 
a depressing list of ailments that are killing the North Sea, 
more research is required to pinpoint other threats.

<F P=106> [EC Document No DOC/IP/94/155: "Importation of Ozone </F>
Depleting Substances into the European Union"] 
  [Text] The recent Commission decision (no. 94/84/EC) 
concerning the quantity and allocation of imports into the 
Community of ozone depleting substances does not increase the 
damage to the ozone layer, nor represent an easing of European 
policy on this matter as has been alleged recently by certain 
European producers of these substances. 
  The Commission wishes to stress that the quantities of 
virgin 
substances for dispersive uses which may be imported into the 
Community remain in strict conformity with Council regulation 
(EEC) no. 549/91 as amended. The other imports allowed under 
the decision are only for either "feedstock" uses, which do not 
damage the ozone layer because they are permanently altered in 
the chemical process, or for used and recycled substances, which 
by providing an alternative to new production of CFC's and other 
controlled substances, have allowed ozone depleting substances 
to be phased-out more rapidly. Both types of imports are 
permitted and encouraged by the Montreal Protocol on ozone 
depleting substances. These imports have been authorized after 
full consultation with the ministries responsible for 
environmental protection of the member states in accordance with 
Council Regulation (EEC) no. 594/91. 
  The Commission takes great care to distinguish between 
imports of used and recycled substances and those of virgin 
substances. All companies wishing to import used and recycled 
substances are vetted by the relevant ministries of the member 
states. Every cargo of controlled substances is only permitted 
into the Community if it is accompanied by a valid import 
licence, and if a company is found to have undertaken illegal 
imports, import licences are withheld and legal action may be 
instigated by the member states. 
  In addition, since the beginning of this year, further 
information specifying the source and destination companies of 
used and recycled substances is required by the Commission 
before an import license is issued. 
  The other imports do not add to the European Union's 
consumption of CFC's, or of any of the ozone depleting 
substances, because neither type of import is treated as 
consumption within the terms of the Montreal Protocol. 
  The provisions under the protocol regarding production for 
"feedstock" uses and for the trade of used and recycled 
substances, also benefit European producers. They are permitted 
to produce unlimited quantities of CFC's and other substances 
provided these are for feedstock use, and they can also play an 
active role in the recycling of used substances. 
  Commissioner Paleokrassas would like to take this 
opportunity 
to stress that the Union has taken a leading position in the 
fight against ozone depleting substances by anticipating the 
dates of phasing out of the ozone depleting substances agreed in 
the Montreal protocol.

  [Excerpt] Bonn -- Environment Minister Klaus Toepfer 
(Christian Democratic Union) has announced an overall solution 
for the approximately 380 tonnes of pesticide toxic waste from 
the former German Democratic Republic [GDR] that has been stored 
in Albania for nearly two years. As he stated at a news 
conference today, he will present a concluding report next week. 
At the Bundestag on Thursday [10 March], he indicated that the 
pesticides transported to Albania are to be returned to Germany 
"in a more or less legal way" and disposed of here. 
  However, the financial aspect of the operation has 
apparently 
not yet been settled. The Finance Ministry has not yet released 
the 1.4 million German marks [DM] needed to handle the toxic 
waste, which is mainly stored in a train of the GDR Railroads. 
The costs for the return and disposal are expected to be much 
higher. A similar operation during which waste from Romania was 
transported back to Germany involved about DM10 million.

<F P=106> [Article signed BN/SV: "Convention on Climate Effective as </F>
of Monday; Fighting the Greenhouse Effect; More Active Measures 
Are Required"; as released by Bern ATSA/SDAA database] 
  [Text] Bern, 17 Mar (ATS) -- The UN framework convention on 
climate change will take effect as of Monday. Its aim is to 
limit the emission into the atmosphere of greenhouse gases. In 
February, Switzerland presented a report explaining the basis of 
its strategy for fighting global warming. Certain governments 
and ecologists are demanding more restrictive measures to limit 
this problem. 
  The convention comes into force 90 days after having been 
ratified by a 50th state and less than two years after it was 
signed at the Rio Summit in June 1992 by more than 150 
governments. It requires developed countries to reduce their 
carbon dioxide (CO2) emission and the emission of other 
greenhouse gases, in particular CFC's 
[Chlorofluorohydrocarbons], to 1990 levels by the year 2000. 
These countries have until 21 September to present their 
official reports explaining how they intend achieving this aim. 
Developing countries have been granted a period of three years. 
<H5>  Support for Developing Countries </H5>
  The other commitments included in the convention concern the 
protection and expansion of forests which absorb CO2 in the 
atmosphere, and financial and technological aid for developing 
countries enabling them to respect the terms of the convention. 
These countries have notably agreed to implement programs 
intended to strengthen scientific and technical research in this 
domain. 
  Where Switzerland is concerned, Philippe Roch, Director of 
the Federal Office of Environment, Forestry and Countryside, in 
February presented the report on global warming. The document 
provides the first complete inventory of greenhouse gas 
emissions in Switzerland. It aims to be an "evolving program" to 
set up strategies of prevention and adaptation to climate change. 
  The document also analyzes the possible effects of such a 
warming and does not rule out the rise in sea level, the 
increase in floods, heat waves and droughts. However, Mr. Roch 
avoided the catastrophic approach, although he stressed that 
regions of Switzerland, especially the mountainous areas, could 
suffer directly from global warming. Adopted by the Federal 
Council in February, the report will serve as a basis for a 
definitive program to be set up in the summer. 
  However, despite the convention coming into force, most 
governments recognize that this will not be enough to achieve 
its global aim. The aim is to stabilize concentrations of 
greenhouse gases in the atmosphere at a level which makes it 
possible to avoid attacks on the climate due to human activity. 
  The World Wildlife Fund (WWF) has asked industrialized 
countries to take additional measures to reduce CO2 emissions by 
a further 25 percent by the year 2005. 
<H5>  Measures Demanded by Greenpeace </H5>
  For its part, Greenpeace wants Switzerland to reduce the 
emission of such gases by a further 20 percent by the year 2005, 
beyond the deadline set by the convention. To achieve such a 
result it is necessary to introduce, as soon as possible, a 
combined CO2 and energy tax, and to regulate the use of vehicles 
and other engine-driven machines. 
  It is also essential that financial incentives be proposed 
in 
favor of low-consumption machines and renewable energy sources. 
Switzerland must finally abandon nuclear energy and stop cutting 
public transport services. 
  To date, the Convention on Climate Change has been signed by 
16 countries and ratified by 55. A number of problems remain 
unresolved, with the distribution of resources being provided 
for by the Global Environment Facility. This fund, created in 
Rio, was boosted on Wednesday by another $2 billion for the 
coming three years. Switzerland should receive some $40 
million. The signatories of the convention will meet again in 
March 1995 in Berlin.

<F P=106> [Article signed SK: "Switzerland To Participate in the </F>
Geneva Conference on Dangerous Waste -- In Favor of a Ban on 
Export of Waste to Third World Countries"; as released by Bern 
ATSA/SDAA database] 
  [Text] Bern, 14 Mar (ATS) -- Switzerland advocates banning 
the export of waste to Third World countries. It will support 
this proposal at the second conference of the signatories to the 
Basel Convention on dangerous waste. Federal Counselor Ruth 
Dreifuss will head the Swiss delegation to this conference which 
is to take place from 21-25 March in Geneva, as decided on 
Monday by the Federal Council. 
  The conference will deal mainly with a proposal from Denmark 
which aims at banning the export of dangerous waste to Third 
World countries, be it for storage or incineration purposes. 
Switzerland considers this a reinforcement of the main 
objective of the Basel conference on the control of 
transnational transport and disposal of dangerous waste. It is 
also ready to join OECD countries which no longer export waste 
to Third World countries, even for recycling purposes. 
  According to the Federal Department of the Interior, 
Switzerland has not allowed the export of waste to developing 
countries since the 1986 regulation on the movement of hazardous 
waste was implemented. It virtually initiated the Basel 
Convention which came into force on 5 May 1992. The objectives 
of this convention proceed along the same lines as the Swiss 
strategy: If possible, all waste must be disposed in the 
country where it is produced.

"Strategy To Make New &amp; Renewable Energy Competitive"] 
  [Text] The Government is to seek to stimulate a commercial 
market in new and renewable energy, with up to 3 billion pounds 
of private sector investment. 
  Energy Minister Tim Eggar [Title as received] today set out 
the Government's strategy to help key technologies such as 
energy from coppice and waste, wind, solar and fuel cells become 
competitive industries. The Non Fossil Fuel Obligation (NFFO) 
will be the prime mechanism in achieving this. A ten year 
Research, Development, Demonstration and Dissemination programme 
will also help the new and renewable energy industry develop and 
become internationally competitive. The programme budget for 
1994/5 is 19.78 million pounds. 
  In a written answer to a Parliamentary Question by Julian 
Brazier MP (Canterbury) Mr Eggar said: "I have today published a 
report outlining the future strategy for new and renewable 
energy in the UK, and placed a copy in the Libraries of both 
Houses. The report, Energy Paper 62, entitled "New and 
Renewable Energy; Future Prospects in the UK" - is in response 
to the findings of the Renewable Energy Advisory Group which 
were published in December 1992. 
  "Government policy is to stimulate the development of new 
and 
renewable energy sources wherever they have prospects of being 
economically attractive and environmentally acceptable in order 
to contribute to: 
  -- diverse, secure and sustainable energy supplies; 
  -- reduction in the emission of pollutants; 
  -- encouragement of internationally competitive industries. 
  "In doing this, it will take account of what influences 
business competitiveness; and it will work towards 1,500 MW 
Declared Net Capacity of new electricity generating capacity 
from renewable sources for the UK by 2000. 
  "Energy Paper 62 sets out a market enablement strategy 
where, 
following assessment and technical development, the promising 
electricity generating technologies are included in an initial 
protected market via the Non-Fossil Fuel Obligation (NFFO) and 
the Scottish Renewables Obligation (SRO), to help them become 
competitive and establish an industry. Those which become 
viable can then compete equitably within the open market for 
electricity supply. That initial market under NFFO arrangements 
is crucial to the development of some of the key technologies, 
and NFFO is becoming the prime mechanism for support of those 
technologies. However, a purpose of NFFO is to stimulate a 
commercial market for renewable technologies, and it is 
anticipated that the resultant investment by industry could rise 
to 3 billion pounds within the time frame being considered. 
  "An outline of the ten year forward Research, Development, 
Demonstration and Dissemination (RDD&amp;D) programme is also 
presented. This work will assess and develop technologies, 
remove inappropriate barriers, ensure the market is fully 
informed and encourage internationally competitive industries to 
develop. 
  "Funding for RDD&amp;D, as provided by Government, industry 
and 
other sources is significant both in its size and in enabling 
technologies to enter the market. Resources will be 
concentrated on key technologies with good prospects of 
commercial application in the coming decades - such as solar, 
energy from coppice and waste, wind and fuel cells. Existing 
work on Passive Solar Design will be completed over the next few 
years and DTI involvement then reduced as the technology matures. 
  "The Government's geothermal R&amp;D and tidal programmes 
will be 
closed when current commitments end. The existing work on wave 
energy will be completed, but no further commitments undertaken, 
as this technology has limited potential to contribute 
commercially to energy supplies in the next few decades. The 
emphasis on technology transfer will be maintained, in line with 
the White Paper on Science, Engineering and Technology. The 
programme will also be closely integrated with complementary 
work supported by the European Community. The programme budget 
for new and renewable energy for FY1994/95 is 19.78 million 
pounds. 
  "Also published today is `An Assessment of Renewable Energy 
for the UK.' This report, (ETSU-R-82), which has been prepared 
by the Energy Technology Support Unit, provides a technical 
basis for the future strategy and summarises information 
gathered by the Government's programme since its inception. 
Copies of this report have also been placed in the libraries of 
both Houses.' 
<H5>  Notes for Editors: </H5>
  1. The Non-Fossil Fuel Obligation creates a premium market 
by 
awarding contracts to competing developers for the supply of 
electricity from renewable sources of energy. 
  2. Mr. Eggar announced details of the third NFFO order on 27 
July 1993 (DTI Press Notice P/93/424). The first two renewable 
orders were made in 1990 and 1991. It is intended to make two 
further orders, one in 1995 and one in 1997.

<F P=106> [Article by Simon Beavis, industrial editor: "Nuclear Waste </F>
Safety Fears"] 
  [Text] The Government is under pressure to widen the scope 
of its promised review of nuclear power after its safety 
advisers warned of serious problems at installations, including 
Sellafield, and said failure to plan for storage of waste could 
expose workers to increased radioactive doses. 
  In a damning report the Health and Safety Commission's 
advisory committee on the safety of nuclear installations 
(ACSNI) said failure to plan a deep depository for waste meant 
there was uncertainty about how to package waste stored at sites 
of the UK Atomic Energy Authority. This could lead to the "risk 
of additional doses to workers dealing with waste at nuclear 
sites." 
  The report also warned that there was a legacy of 
"inadequate 
storage" at Dounreay in northern Scotland and, referring to the 
1957 fire at Windscale, now part of the Sellafield site, said 
"there are still serious problems not cleared up since the 
accident." 
  About 15 tonnes of damaged fuel remains in the core of the 
atomic pile that was hit by the fire and a further five tonnes 
of fuel in aid and water ducts. Great care was still needed to 
avoid the release of materials during work on the site. 
  The committee's chairman, Dr David Harrison, made it clear 
that the problem of waste should be a main question in the 
Government's nuclear review, but he said the Energy Minister in 
communications with the committee had failed to clarify whether 
the problem would be investigated. 
  The review -- which the Government promised would begin in 
1993 -- has been held up partly because the Department of Trade, 
the Treasury and the Department of the Environment have failed 
to agree on its terms of reference. The DTI wants a limited 
study while the rival departments want to study the question of 
nuclear liabilities and waste. 
  The ACSNI report concentrates on six UKAEA sites: Harwell, 
Winfrith, Dounreay, Aldermaston, Springfields and Sellafield. It 
highlights a store at Harwell which fails "to meet modern 
standards" and "unsatisfactory" storage facilities for low level 
waste at Dounreay. 
  Of Sellafield it says: "There is a very long programme of 
work required to get the piles into an adequately safe 
condition. At present they fall far below the `as safe as 
reasonably achievable' criterion." 
  The UKAEA said the report recognised "considerable 
improvements" it had made. Concerns about Dounreay and 
Sellafield had now been resolved.

<F P=106> [Article by Sean Ryan, environment correspondent, additional </F>
reporting: Matthew Loup: "Water Companies Exposed as Worst 
Polluters of Rivers"] 
  [Text] Water companies have become Britain's biggest 
criminal polluters, wrecking wildlife and sport along thousands 
of miles of river with illegal discharges of sewage. A SUNDAY 
TIMES investigation has found they were fined more often than 
any other firms last year, with 39 convictions for pollution 
offences. 
  Government ecologists have warned that contaminated 
waterways 
pose a growing threat to aquatic plants and animals. 
  Yorkshire Water performed worst. Its 12 convictions in 1993 
included two for allowing raw sewage to cascade across a beach 
crowded with holidaymakers near Whitby, for which it was fined 
&pound;75,000. 
  Last year Sir Gordon Jones, the chairman, promised that the 
company would "undertake whatever investment is required by 
legislation in environmental improvements." Last Monday, two 
75-year-old pipes burst at its Bradford sewage works, pouring 
30m gallons of effluent into the river Aire. 
  The second longest criminal record belongs to North West 
Water. Sir Desmond Pitcher, its chairman, said that its 
expertise in tackling environmental problems in the region was 
"evident in the contracts we are winning around the world." 
  The company had seven convictions in 1993, including one for 
allowing a tide of raw sewage more than 1ft deep to flood a 
hotel in Greater Manchester. 
  Severn Trent, with six convictions, and Thames, with five, 
have also climbed into the top four in a league table of 
polluters. They overtook British Coal, ICI and Rechem, the waste 
disposal company. All were prosecuted repeatedly in previous 
years but improved their performance. 
  Water companies, which have almost doubled charges in five 
years and made a combined profit of more than &pound;1.5 billion 
in 
1992-93, admit to operating nearly 200 sewage works illegally. 
They say it will be another three years before the problem -- 
first highlighted by THE SUNDAY TIMES "Water Rats" campaign in 
1989 -- is brought under control. 
  The National Rivers Authority (NRA), which monitors the 
waterways, said it had detected a substantial increase in 
reports of pollution incidents relating to sewage and the water 
industry. The number rose from 4,578 in 1988, the year before 
privatisation, to 6,420 in 1992. 
  Fewer than one incident in every 100 results in a 
prosecution 
by the NRA, according to a study compiled by Friends of the 
Earth. Liana Stupples, the group's water specialist, said 
government promises of a big clean-up of rivers had been broken. 
  "Instead, customers face escalating water bills while some 
of 
our finest rivers are devastated by sub-standard sewage 
treatment," she said. 
  One of the most severely affected rivers is the Roch in 
Greater Manchester, contaminated by Rochdale sewage works, which 
has breached legal limits on pollution six times since last 
summer in spite of a &pound;6m improvement programme. 
  The failures have angered local inhabitants, who remember 
kingfishers swooping on fish that were plentiful in the river 
until pollution drove them away. Last week some said they could 
not bear to eat meals in rooms overlooking the river because of 
the smell. 
  "If a stranger comes to the door in summer, you're 
embarrassed. You see them sniffing and wondering what it is," 
said Michael Greene, 56, a plasterer whose garden backs on to 
the sewage plant. 
  Elsewhere, dozens of smaller rivers have had their wildlife 
tainted by sewage. Among them is the Kennet, one of England's 
most beautiful waterways, where discharges have been blamed for 
encouraging the growth of choking weeks at the expense of 
spectacular species such as water crowfoot. 
  Malborough sewage works, beside the Kennet, is one of 35 
identified by English Nature, the government wildlife agency, as 
needing relatively small improvements totalling &pound;10m to 
protect the rivers of greatest scientific value. Thames Water, 
however, has so far refused to do the work, claiming it would 
make no significant difference. 
  The worsening pollution of some of Britain's most attractive 
waterways has also dismayed leisure groups. Ramblers have 
protested about finding condoms and sanitary towels on the 
banks, wile anglers, fed up with finding rivers choked with 
stinking mats of sewage fungus, are resorting to legal action. 
  Four companies, including Yorkshire, are being sued by the 
Anglers' Co-operative Association, a pressure group, after 
allegedly failing to clear up discharges that left fishing nets 
coated in slime. 
  Rowers have protested, too. On the Aire, Bradford Amateur 
Rowing Club has stopped its tradition of throwing a first-time 
winner into the water on health grounds. 
  Sir Gordon Jones, the Yorkshire Water chairman, played down 
the significance of the pollution. "We're talking about a 
problem, of course, but not a major problem," he said. All but 
12 of the company's 620 sewage works now operated within the 
law, he added. 
  The Water Services Association, which represents the 
privatised companies, said the proportion of its 4,000 sewage 
works failing to comply with legal requirements had fallen 
substantially from 13 percent at privatisation. It was estimated 
at 7 percent by the NRA last June. 
  According to the industry, the huge cost of complying with 
European Community rules on beaches and urban waste means 
improvements to the sewerage system cannot be carried out any 
faster.

<F P=106> [Paul Brown report: "River Transfers May Satisfy Water </F>
Needs"] 
  [Text] Drinking water will be delivered by pipeline and 
river from Wales to London and from Nottinghamshire to Essex 
under a National Rivers Authority (NRA) plan published yesterday. 
  The authority calculates that to move water between river 
systems by pipeline would be cheaper than reservoirs. Thames 
Water has already put it's plan for a new reservoir in south 
Oxfordshire on hold. 
  The NRA stressed yesterday that neither pipelines nor 
reservoirs were yet needed because water conservation would 
create savings to satisfy demand well into the next century. 
However, since schemes like transfers from Wales to London 
would take 2 years to complete consideration should begin now. 
  Reservoirs have been constructed that turned out not to be 
needed, most notably the Kielder in Northumberland. The NRA has 
therefore worked on a cautious approach which suggests that in 
some circumstances no new strategic schemes will be needed. If 
metering were introduced and leakage from old mains cut 
substantially, future demand could be met from existing sources. 
  If demand rises above this level, pipelines are cheaper than 
reservoirs. It would cost 57 million pounds less to build a 
pipeline from the Severn to the Thames than to build a reservoir 
in south Oxfordshire. 
  Anglian, Thames and East Midlands areas may require new 
schemes. The East Midlands shortages are expected to be met by 
tapping-rising groundwater around Birmingham. In East Anglia a 
reservoir could be built or water transferred via pipelines and 
rivers from the Trent south-east to Essex, and in London water 
diverted from the rivers Wye and Severn. 
  Lilli Matson, Council for the Protection of Rural England 
campaigns officer, welcomed the emphasis on saving resources. 
She said control of Ieakage from pipelines would be important. 
Thames loses 23 percent of water through leakage, compared with 
10 percent for some German undertakings.

<F P=106> [Bronwen Maddox article: "Half of Country `Is Damaged by </F>
Acid Rain'"] 
  [Text] Buildings and wildlife in half of the UK are being 
damaged by acid rain, says a government report published 
yesterday. 
  Scientists say the contraction of the coal industry will cut 
the area affected by nearly nine-tenths early next century. 
  The estimates, prepared for the Department of the 
Environment, show that western and northern parts of the UK, 
including much of Wales and Scotland, are particularly affected. 
  Mr. Robert Wilson, chairman of the report's research group, 
said the soils and rocks of these areas contained little 
alkaline material to counteract the acid. 
  Last week in Geneva the UK agreed to the terms of a UN 
protocol to curb the sulphur dioxide emissions which help cause 
acid rain and come largely from coal-burning power stations. 
Under the agreement, likely to be signed later this year, the 
UK must cut emissions to 50 percent of 1980 levels by the year 
2000, and to 30 percent by 2005 and 20 percent by 2010. 
  Ministers have been assured that the power generation 
industry's switch from coal to gas means that the UK can meet 
the new obligations. 
  Environmentalists such as the pressure group Friends of the 
Earth have criticised the UK for refusing to sign an earlier 
sulphur protocol which expired last year. 
  The report employs the "critical loads approach" that the UK 
has urged international conventions to follow. This takes 
account of the environment's sensitivity as well as the extent 
of pollution when assessing the impact of acid rain. 
  The report says that some damage to Scottish heather and to 
salmon and trout stocks in Wales can be attributed directly to 
acid rain. However, it adds: "It is harder to link damage to 
tree health directly to air pollution -- the causes are complex." 
  About 10 percent of pollution recorded by the study was 
found 
to come from other countries. 
  Even if sulphur emissions were curbed sharply some areas, 
such as the southern Pennines, "would never recover from layers 
of deposits since the Industrial Revolution", the report says. 
  Negotiations on a protocol to curb nitrogen oxides, which 
are 
emitted from vehicles and other sources, are expected to take 
several years.

<F P=106> [Article by Paul Brown, environment correspondent: "Plan To </F>
Sink Old N-Subs To Be Ditched"] 
  [Text] Plans to sink redundant nuclear submarines and parts 
of civil reactors at sea are to be abandoned by the Government 
following its decision yesterday to accept the international ban 
on dumping nuclear waste at sea. 
  As a result, all Britain's military and civil nuclear waste 
will be buried on land. Most of it is destined for the proposed 
repository under British Nuclear Fuel's Sellafield complex in 
Cumbria. 
  Planning permission for the preliminary phase of a 
repository, a 700 metre-deep rock laboratory, will be sought 
next month by Nirex, the nuclear industry's waste disposal 
company. 
  This plan involves sinking two shafts and building galleries 
to test whether the geology under Sellafield is suitable for 
construction of full-scale repository. Even on the most 
optimistic forecast, this would not be ready before 2010. 
  The Government's decision to abandon sea dumping, announced 
by Gillian Shephard, the Agriculture and Fisheries Minister, was 
rather reluctant. She said it remained the Government's view was 
that decisions on disposal of waste should be taken on economic 
and scientific grounds and in both areas there were good 
arguments for disposal at sea. 
  However, the Government "recognises that the weight of 
international opinion on the matter means that such dumping is 
not, in any event, a practical proposition." 
  The Ministry of Defence has seven redundant nuclear 
submarines waiting for disposal, three at Devonport and four at 
Rosyth. The original plan was to scrap the uncontaminated parts 
and fill the reactor compartments with concrete ready to sink 
them at sea. 
  Although they are now destined for years of "floating 
storage", the reactors will eventually have to be cut up and 
placed in concrete containers for disposal in the civil 
repository. The same is true of the concrete shields of civil 
reactors. 
  The Nirex rock repository plan is running into opposition 
from some local people in Cumbria and environmental groups. The 
nuclear industry hopes to avoid a public inquiry at this stage 
and hold one in five years, when it has proved that the area is 
right geologically for a full-blown repository. 
  Objectors will demand a public inquiry immediately, because 
they believe the rock laboratory is a pilot project for the full 
repository. 
  The proposed rock laboratory, should it prove suitable, 
would 
be adapted to be part of the repository. 
  Three thousand jobs will be created for eight to 10 years in 
the construction phase, which would be as large a job as the 
Channel tunnel. Only 300 people would be needed to run the 
repository itself, which is expected to take all Britain's 
intermediate and low level waste to the year 2050.

"Grants To Find Replacement For Cadmium Plating"] 
  [Text] Environment Minister Lord Arran today announced a 
grant offer of 390,000 pounds, under the Environmental 
Technology Innovation Scheme [ETIS], to the National Centre of 
Tribology, within AEA Technology, Risley. The project will 
investigate new technologies to replace cadmium plating in 
corrosion protection and in bearing materials. The grant offer 
covers up to 40 percent of the eligible project costs. 
  The Centre will undertake the project along with a 
consortium 
of twenty or more companies which are either current users of 
cadmium surface treatments, or suppliers of potential 
replacement treatment technologies. 
  Announcing the project, Lord Arran said: "I am very pleased 
to announce this latest project which my Department has been 
able to support under the Environmental Technology Innovation 
Scheme [ETIS]. In its own interests, and for the benefit of all 
of us, industry must research ways of making its products more 
environmentally friendly by replacing harmful substances 
wherever possible. This project is a contribution to the drive 
to identify alternatives to cadmium plating. This is an 
important objective and I wish the participants every success." 
<H5>  Notes to Editors </H5>
  ETIS was launched in October 1990 with the aim of helping 
companies to undertake research into new environmental 
technology. It is run jointly by the Departments of Environment 
and Trade and Industry. 
  The period for submission of applications under ETIS has now 
ended. The grant offer announced today is the last which will be 
made under the Scheme. 
  In December 1993, the President of the Board of Trade 
announced a new environmental technology best practice programme 
operated jointly by DTI [Department of Trade and Industry] and 
DOE [Department of Energy]. This programme will build on 
experience of previous environmental technology schemes but with 
emphasis on provision and delivery of information rather than 
grant assistance to firms. The programme, which is due to be 
launched later in 1994, will aim to make good environmental 
technology and techniques more widely known to potential users 
and suppliers. The Departments have allocated 16 million pounds 
to the programme to be spent over five years. The programme will 
operate within a set of priority areas to be selected by the 
Departments in consultation with industry. 
  Cadmium is a toxic metal which may enter the environment 
through many routes as a result of processes including metal 
plating. It can be taken up by humans in several ways, 
including through food. At high levels it can damage kidneys and 
other organs and tissues. A European Directive, 83/513/EEC, lays 
down limit values for the discharge of cadmium from various 
industrial processes and also quality objectives and monitoring 
procedures. The project announced today targets uses of cadmium 
which are currently exempt from the controls of the Directive.

<F P=106> [Paul Brown report: "Sellafield Catastrophe 'Could Be 10 </F>
Times Worse Than Chernobyl'"] 
  [Text] Millions of people would need to be evacuated if 
just one of the high-level nuclear waste storage tanks at 
Sellafield in Cumbria lost its coolant and released 
radioactivity, said a report published yesterday. 
  The report, commissioned by local authorities potentially in 
the path of the radioactive plume, says that the risk of 
catastrophe may be remote but the effects would be huge -- 
potentially at least 10 times more than Chernobyl. 
  Sellafield's 1,400 cubic metres of heat-producing waste is 
kept in 21 tanks by British Nuclear Fuels (BNFL). Both the 
Nuclear Installations Inspectorate, which polices safety at 
Sellafield, and BNFL said yesterday they were confident that a 
series of fail-safe devices would prevent the kind of disaster 
warned of in the report. 
  Its author is Dr. Peter Taylor, a nuclear researcher who has 
served on a government committee on the sea disposal of nuclear 
waste and advised the Department of Environment. The European 
Commission made available to him computer equipment on which an 
accident could be modelled. 
  It showed that a major release from a single tank could 
require evacuation and decontamination of populations out to 
1,000 kilometres (625 miles) from the site, and relocation of 
large numbers of people for periods up to a year. Depending on 
wind direction and whether it was raining (which increases 
contamination), between 2 million and 28 million people faced 
evacuation. 
  Glasgow, Strathclyde, Leeds Bradford, Manchester and 
Liverpool could all be under the plume, depending on the 
prevailing wind. All these cities contributed to the cost of 
the report. Technology exists to make the tanks safer, says the 
report. Its cost would be about equal to the 500 million pound 
profits from the first 10 years of the new Thorp reprocessing 
plant. 
  BNFL said in a statement that the report assumed a series of 
events that was unlikely in the extreme. "It appears to be 
nothing more than scaremongering, in order to get cheap 
headlines." 
  Dr. Sam Harbison, of the nuclear inspectorate, said: "The 
probability of an accident is small, even if the consequences 
are large."

"Government Urged To Cut Benzene Levels"] 
  [Text] Britons are breathing in potentially dangerous 
levels of a carcinogenic chemical, the Government admitted 
yesterday as it published recommendations for limits on benzene 
in air. 
  But a limit that ensured nobody was exposed to hazardous 
amounts could not be achieved overnight, scientific advisers 
said. 
  Yesterday they called for an interim level on benzene 
concentrations in the air of five parts per billion (ppb) 
averaged over the year but urged the Government to plan a limit 
soon of one part per billion. 
  At the moment, somebody breathing London's air is inhaling 
amounts of benzene equivalent to smoking about 15 cigarettes a 
day. 
  Professor Anthony Seaton, chairman of the independent panel 
on air quality standards, which has recommended the limits, said 
they had taken a pragmatic approach because some people might be 
more at risk from benzene than others. "Because of the 
uncertainties and because it is a genotoxic carcinogen, one 
which hits the DNA, it was felt the less benzene in the air the 
better," he said. 
  The decision to act over benzene follows growing public 
alarm 
over car-related air pollution. Studies in animals and humans 
have shown that benzene, 78 percent of which comes from car 
fumes in Britain, accumulates in bone marrow and brain tissue 
and causes leukaemias. In very high doses it is lethal. 
  Robert Atkins, the environment minister, said yesterday that 
daily bulletins on benzene levels would be issued from 12 new 
monitoring stations. 
  Environment Department officials said yesterday they would 
also be publishing a consultation document on how they planned 
to meet the panel's targets. They said meeting the interim, 5 
ppb limit should be possible but admitted that some parts of 
Britain might still exceed the guidelines. 
  Better engine designs, tougher MoT emission tests and the 
phasing in of catalytic converters should achieve reductions in 
benzene levels. 
  However, meeting the tougher level would be harder as the 
number of cars on the roads overwhelmed technological 
improvements. They said a variety of measures would be necessary. 
  Professor Seaton, of the University of Aberdeen's medical 
school, said diesel cars were not the answer. Although they 
produce less benzene, they produce more of a range of pollutants 
also linked with cancer including particulates and 1.3 butadiene. 
  The recommendations on benzene levels are the first of a 
series to be produced by the panel, covering up to 100 air 
pollutants, many of which are linked with car fumes. 
  Figures in the report show that London's air occasionally 
breaks the interim limit and often breaks the stricter one of 1 
ppb. During 1991 and 1992, for example, measurements in 
Knightsbridge showed an average annual concentration of 6 parts 
per billion; in December 1991 concentrations peaked at around 13 
ppb. Rural levels at Harwell, Oxfordshire, fluctuated between 
1.7 and 0.4 ppb. 
  Other research has indicated that benzene levels inside cars 
are higher than outside. Professor Seaton said: "If you are in a 
traffic jam with the heater sucking in the exhaust of the car in 
front, it is quite plausible you can get higher levels of all 
sorts of things."

"23 million pound Construction Research Program Announced"] 
  [Text] The Department of the Environment will put 23 
million pounds into construction innovation and research in 
1994/5, Construction Minister Tony Baldry announced today. 
  Over a hundred separate research projects are to be funded, 
covering areas ranging from low energy building design, and 
constructional use of low grade timber, such as forest 
thinnings, to the integration of virtual reality with standard 
industry software packages. 
<H5>  Announcing the Programme, Mr. Baldry Said: </H5>
  "We have two key priorities for this year. The first is to 
ensure that the research we are carrying out is what the 
industry needs and wants. The best way to do this is through 
collaboration with our industry partners. We will be consulting 
them on whether the work undertaken for us by the Building 
Research Establishment meets requirements; and we will be 
increasing to five million pounds the proportion of research 
expenditure devoted to projects funded jointly with industry. 
  "So that we can extend joint projects even further in 
1995/6, 
we will be improving our guidance for prospective future 
partners on the opportunities for collaborative research. 
  "Our second priority is to ensure that industry makes the 
most of research results. We will be looking very carefully at 
the way the research is taken up and exploited. 
  "On top of our own research programme, we are working with 
the construction industry to develop a research strategy for the 
whole industry that will provide a cohesive programme across all 
areas. Our aim is to maximise the impact that research and 
innovation has on the industry's efficiency and competitiveness." 
<H5>  Notes For Editors </H5>
  The following are examples of work to be funded as part of 
the 1994/95 collaborative research programme: 
  -- a project with the Richard Rogers Partnership which will 
aim to assist the design of advanced low energy buildings across 
Europe through workshops, exhibitions and publication of a 
report aimed at design practitioners; - projects with the 
Centre for Window and Cladding Technology focusing on the use of 
advanced glazing materials; thermally improved frames; fixings 
for natural stone; and the performance of glazing gaskets; 
  -- a LINK initiative involving DOE [Department of Energy] 
and 
the Science and Engineering Research Council [SERC] aimed at 
improving construction quality and productivity through a 
greater integration of design and construction. Academics and 
industry representatives will work together towards the 
application of more innovative design and construction 
technologies including greater use of IT tools. DOE and SERC 
will contribute 2.5 million pounds each towards this initiative 
over a six year period; 
  -- a project with the University of Salford and the Advanced 
Robotic Research Laboratory aimed at producing a low cost tool 
which will integrate virtual reality functionality with standard 
industry software packages to improve the presentation of new 
designs for professionals and clients; 
  -- a project with the Tavistock Institute and contracting 
organisations within the industry to improve the approach to 
procurement, management of materials supply contracts and 
subcontracting in general. The objective is to shift the 
emphasis from securing minimum price on materials and services 
contracts to a partnership approach between the different 
organisations involved in design and construction thus achieving 
better value for money and quality in the final building; 
  -- preparation with the Building Services Research and 
Information Association of a guide for building services 
companies on the opportunities in the Chinese and CIS markets. 
This follows similar studies of market opportunities in Europe 
and the aim is to encourage British companies to exploit these 
two potential markets areas; 
  -- a study with Ceram Building Technology on new approaches 
to masonry cavity walling taking into account the need for 
better levels of thermal insulation to reduce energy consumption 
and thereby CO2 emissions. The study will look particularly at 
the prevention of rain penetration, ensuring that wall 
thicknesses are economic but effective and that improved levels 
of insulation can be achieved in a practical, buildable way; 
  -- the production with the Construction Industry Research 
and 
Information Association of a series of guidance notes which 
outline the key environmental impacts of a number of common 
building and construction elements and systems. The aim is to 
assist designers at the preliminary design stages of a project 
and once a basic solution has been selected, to provide valuable 
information for specifiers and material and product 
manufacturers; 
  -- a three year project with Hooke Forest Construction Ltd 
to 
develop ways of maximising the use in construction of low grade 
timber materials, such as forest thinnings, through new skills, 
technologies, products and markets. The aim would be to reduce 
the UK's dependence on timber imports and provide forest 
conservation; 
  -- a project with Billington Osborne-Moss Engineering Ltd 
(BOMEL) which seeks to benchmark the productivity of the UK 
construction industry. The project will develop a detailed 
methodology for the measurement of productivity and look to 
transfer the productivity levels achieved on successful 
construction sites to others across the country; 
  -- an extension of the Building Research Establishment's 
BREEAM (BRE Environmental Assessment Method) programme to 
schools. BREEAM has been highly successful in alerting 
developers, designers and others to the contribution they can 
make to reducing the environmental impact of their buildings. It 
has so far been based around the assessment of the environmental 
impact of new build offices and the subsequent award of a 
certificate to those reaching the required standard. The 
objective would be to extend coverage of the scheme to existing 
school buildings and to produce an associated educational pack 
for teachers and pupils thereby raising public awareness of 
these issues. Research funded by the DOE will continue to 
support its statutory responsibilities for Building Regulations 
and also help improve the efficiency of the construction 
processes and thereby the quality, performance and reliability 
of buildings.

"Proposals for a New Policy Framework for Control of Hazardous 
Chemicals."] 
  [Text] Environment Minister Robert Atkins today welcomed 
the publication of a discussion document outlining proposals for 
a new framework for the assessment and control of hazardous 
substances. 
  Announcing the publication of the Discussion Paper, Mr. 
Atkins said: 
  "The paper seeks to develop a transparent and coherent 
strategy for identifying and controlling chemicals which are 
particularly dangerous to the environment, especially those 
released from diffuse sources. The proposed strategy is based on 
internationally accepted criteria for assessing the risks to 
human health and the environment and advocates a measured 
approach to the control of these risks. 
  "Our objective is to build upon existing programmes and 
measures, so that we remain consistent in our approach and 
minimise the burdens on the public sector and industry. 
  "The proposed new policy framework is a response to the 
challenges the Government established in the UK Strategy for 
Sustainable Development. It also aims to meet two objectives of 
the Governments deregulation initiative - greater clarity in the 
operation of environmental regulations and the consideration of 
viable alternatives to regulatory action which maintain existing 
environmental standards." 
<H5>  Notes To Editors </H5>
  The Discussion Paper - Reducing Emissions of Hazardous 
Chemicals to the Environment was released today for public 
consultation. Its publication fulfils a commitment made in the 
Sustainable Development Strategy. 
  The paper describes a new policy framework for reducing 
diffuse emissions of hazardous substances to the environment. It 
consists of a discussion paper supported by several annexes. 
  The discussion paper considers components of the proposed 
new 
framework in a stepwise manner beginning with criteria for 
identifying environmentally hazardous chemicals. The proposed 
criteria are intended to be consistent with those used in other 
UK substance based policy initiatives. This is followed by an 
outline of the principles of Risk Assessment; a vital component 
of the proposed strategy designed to inform decisions as to the 
extent of risk posed by a particular chemical and the degree of 
control necessary to manage the risk effectively. The paper then 
discusses a proposed hierarchy of measures to control chemical 
risks. Alternatives to regulatory control are considered 
including voluntary agreements with industry and economic 
instruments. 
  The supporting annexes provide detailed information on 
typical point and diffuse sources of emissions of hazardous 
chemicals and many of the existing control measures including 
international initiatives such as the Montreal Protocol and the 
Oslo and Paris Conventions. Technical guidance on priority 
setting and risk characterisation for hazardous chemicals is 
also provided. 
  The Government is seeking responses to the proposed strategy 
and related issues by the 31st May 1994.

<F P=106> [Speech by David Curry, minister of the environment, at the </F>
South-East Regional Transport Strategy Conference, on 7 March: 
"Transport Policy Must Be Environmentally Sustainable"] 
  [Text] "In our sustainable development strategy we set out 
the approach we are taking to sustainable land use. We are 
seeking to integrate land use planning into an overall strategy 
that contributes to both environmental and economic objectives, 
one that includes both transport and the environment. 
  "To allow us to do this we must have a framework for 
transport decisions that will allow us to meet the environmental 
objectives. The chief measures within that framework are pricing 
to reflect the full costs of travel, and careful land-use 
planning to help us to reduce the need for that travel in the 
first place. 
  "Our planning policies will be taken forward in the new 
Planning Policy Guidance Note 13 : Transport, which we have 
produced with the Department of Transport and the Welsh Office. 
The draft, on which we received over 800 supportive and 
constructive comments, set out clearly how local planning 
authorities can reduce the need for travel in the first place 
and provide people with a choice of means of travel. 
  "We are looking to publish the final version of the guidance 
note very shortly. Without pre-empting what it will say, the 
key issues must be: 
-- maintaining and, where cost effective, improving strategic 
communication within the South-East and between the South-East, 
the rest of the UK and continental Europe; 
  -- reducing and managing the pressures of congestion and its 
impacts on the local urban environment; 
  -- providing for a better relationship between home, 
workplace and other activities to reduce the need to travel; 
  -- encouraging more efficient transport choices and enabling 
people to walk, cycle or catch public transport; and 
  -- improving the environment. 
  "This is not an issue that we in the UK are tackling alone; 
it is one which is being tackled all over Europe. There are no 
ready answers, and there are difficult choices to be made, but 
they are choices which we will make together to produce a 
transport planning policy that meets all the aims of 
sustainability."

"New Guidance on Release of Genetically Modified Plants"] 
  [Text] Reduced information requirements for applications 
for consents to release genetically modified plants were today 
announced by the Department of the Environment. 
  Details are published in a guidance note from the Department 
of Energy [DoE] and the Advisory Committee on Releases to the 
Environment [ACRE]. ACRE advises the Secretary of State on all 
applications to release genetically modified organisms [GMOs]. 
  All such applications have to provide prescribed information 
about the GMO and the potential receiving environment. This 
information is used to assess the risks associated with the 
intended release. However, ACRE's experience of releases of 
genetically modified plants has enabled them to identify the 
information required in the application which is not relevant. 
The guidance note sets out in detail which information is no 
longer required. 
  These reduced requirements come shortly after the 
publication 
of guidance on fast track procedures for releases of low risk 
GMOs. Together they contribute significantly to the Government's 
programme of deregulatory activities in this area, which are 
designed to lighten the burden on applicants without 
compromising safety. 
  This is the third in a series of DOE/ACRE Guidance notes. 
Other technical guidance notes are expected in the next few 
months. 
<H5>  Notes To Editors </H5>
  The guidance notes are published by the DOE on the advice of 
the Advisory Committee on Releases to the Environment (ACRE) and 
in association with the Scottish Office, the Welsh Office, the 
Ministry of Agriculture Fisheries and Food, and the Health and 
Safety Executive. 
  Acre has been appointed as the committee under s124 of the 
Environmental Protection Act 1990 which advises the Secretary of 
State on matters relating to consents and environmental safety. 
The guidance notes relate to Part VI of the Environmental 
Protection Act 1990 and The Genetically Modified Organisms 
(Deliberate Release) Regulations 1992 (SI 1992/3280) which came 
into effect on 1 February 1993. The legislation introduced a 
consent scheme for all GMO releases. DOE/ACRE Guidance Note 2, 
"Fast Track Procedures for Certain GMO Releases" was published 
in January 1994. 
  DOE/ACRE Guidance Note 3 is available by post from the 
Department of the Environment Publication Sales Unit, Block 3, 
Spur 2, Room 1/2, Government Buildings, Lime Grove, Eastcote, 
HA4 8SE (telephone 081 429 5101), price 9.00 pounds (inclusive 
of post and packing). All orders for the guidance should be 
accompanied by a cheque made payable to the Department of the 
Environment.

<F P=106> [Paul Brown and John Vidal report: "Catastrophe Threatens </F>
World's Fisheries as Stocks Fall"] 
  [Text] The world's fishing stocks are being rapidly 
depleted with disastrous repercussions in places as far apart as 
the corridors of power in Brussels, the unemployment queues in 
North America's eastern seaboard and the diets of people in the 
Third World. 
  According to the United Nations Food and Agriculture 
Organisation [FAO], which monitors fish stocks, nine of the 
world's 17 main fishing grounds are suffering potentially 
catastrophic declines in some species. 
  An FAO paper to be published later this month warns of the 
"severe" political and economic consequences of not 
rationalising the industry along "sustainable lines". 
  While rich countries will find previously common fish 
becoming luxury foods, the FAO warns that rising populations, 
migration to coastal cities and sustained high demand in the 
North could be catastrophic for many poor countries. 
  "The most severe impacts would be in East and South Asia 
where fish play a vital role in the diet," says the report. "An 
additional 8.5 million tons of fish a year will be needed by 
2010 just to maintain present consumption levels in this region." 
  The FAO attempts to address the problem of managing the 
free-for- all in the world's oceans at a four-day meeting which 
starts in New York on Monday. But the political problems, as 
seen this week in negotiations over Norway's entry to EU 
[European Union], are intractable. 
  Europe's fishing industry shows the failure to cope with 
competing ecological and political demands. In Hull 30,000 jobs 
have gone in the fishing industry since 1945 and a deep-sea 
trawler fleet of 300 smallish vessels has been replaced by 15 
super ships. 
  In 1976 the herring fishery collapsed completely and fishing 
was banned. It took until the 1980s for stocks to recover but 
quotas are set far below historic catches to prevent another 
population crash. 
  The cod, haddock and plaice fisheries are now going the same 
way even though quotas are in place. Fish are getting smaller 
and fewer and most do not reach sexual maturity before being 
caught. Scientists believe that by 1995 there may be so few cod 
and haddock left that commercial fishing may be uneconomic and 
it may be years before stocks recover sufficiently to sustain 
even a small European fishing industry. 
  Most of the world's 200 million people who directly and 
indirectly depend on fishing for a livelihood live in coastal 
communities in the developing world. Marine fishing is the 
world's most valuable source of protein, providing more than 
beef or pork. Twenty per cent of the world's animal-based 
protein comes from the sea but many developing countries depend 
for more than half of their diet on the sea. 
  The roots of the fishing crisis lie partly in the over- 
exploitation of northern fishing grounds but also in the heavy 
subsidising of fishing fleets. The FAO estimates that annual 
spending on fishing amounts to $124 billion (83 billion pounds) 
to catch $70 billion (47 billion pounds) of fish. 
  European Union and international fleets are increasingly 
moving in on traditional Third World fisheries, says Indrani 
Lutchman, fisheries officer at the World Wide Fund for Nature. 
The FAO estimates that almost 45 per cent of the money earned 
by the fish trade comes from fish caught in developing world 
waters. 
  "Having exhausted many of their own fishing grounds, the 
North is now turning to the South and undermining the 
livelihoods of coastal communities. More than 25 per cent of 
all fish consumed in the EU are caught by EU-registered boats 
fishing in unpoliced Third World waters." 
  Uncontrolled fishing by foreign fleets off Sierra Leone has 
led to a serious decline in the catch of traditional fishermen, 
who supply 75 per cent of their country's consumption of animal 
protein. 
  Developing countries, backed by international loans, have 
invested heavily in fishing to earn foreign exchange via 
exports, says Peter Weber, a researcher with the Worldwatch 
Institute in Washington. Much of their catch is denied local 
consumers and threatens the inshore fisheries. The FAO 
estimates that almost 40 per cent of the fish caught in the 
world are exported, 90 per cent of it to Japan, the United 
States and the EU. 
  New technology, including satellites, is used to locate fish 
and has boosted world catches 6.6 percent a year from 22 million 
tons in 1950 to a record high of 100 million tons in 1989. 
Fishing became a boom industry in the 1980's, increasing a 
third in size and doubling its economic value. 
  In the last three years the world catch has declined to 
about 
97 million tons largely because of declining catches and the 
confusion in former Soviet fleets. Twenty countries, led by 
China, Japan, Peru, Chile; the U.S. and India catch almost 80 
percent of all fish. 
  Not all the over-exploitation of the oceans can be explained 
by overfishing. Coastal waters contain the richest sources of 
food for fish but are also the most polluted and vulnerable to 
development. Almost two thirds of all commercially valuable fish 
spend the first, vulnerable stages of their life in these waters 
where 90 per cent of the world's marine catch is caught. 
  Tourist industry pressures have depleted many wetland, 
mangrove and estuary habitats in the Far East and the 
Mediterranean. Pacific salmon have largely disappeared, says 
the Worldwatch Institute, because the freshwater streams where 
they spawn have been soiled or are blocked by dams. Restoring 
the streams may cost more than $2 billion (1.3 billion pounds) 
in the U.S. alone. 
  The only hope of maintaining stocks at present levels, says 
the FAO, is through better management. This could yield 
approximately 20 million more tons. The second source of 
additional food could come from the 30 million tons of fish 
presently converted into fishmeal for pigs, chicken, shrimp, and 
salmon. Ten million tons could be saved from discarded fish.

<F P=106> [Unattributed article: "G-7: Environment Key to Economic </F>
Recovery, Ministers Say"] 
  [Text] Florence, 13 Mar (ANSA) -- Environment ministers 
from the Group of Seven major industrialised nations wound up a 
meeting here Sunday, agreeing that the environment will play a 
key role in economic recovery. 
  "The novelty in this first meeting of G-7 environment 
ministers," said Italy's representative [Environment Minister] 
Valdo Spini, "is that until now, when the environment was 
mentioned it was only in the context of countries' 
responsibility towards the health of the planet. Now we have 
realised that the environment has a key role in economic 
recovery and in increasing employment in industrialised 
countries." 
  The ministers from Italy, France, Germany, Britain, Japan, 
Canada and the United States focussed their attention on six 
planned themes -- the global environment, employment, trade, 
green accounting, democracy and financial mechanisms -- and 
added a further topic, nuclear safety in eastern Europe, to the 
agenda. Their findings will be discussed by Group of Seven 
heads of state and government when they meet for their annual 
summit in Naples in July. No formal final statement was issued 
after today's meeting. 
  Talking to the press after the meeting wound up, Spini 
recalled a statement issued by the G-7 leaders after their 
summit in Tokyo last year, in which they said "despite economic 
difficulties, environmental issues must be addressed." Now, he 
said, that word "despite" must be replaced by "because of". 
  Amongst topics dealt with by G-7 environment ministers 
during 
their two-day session here was deforestation, with a pledge to 
work towards a convention for rain forests, an issue which had 
to be put aside after major differences of opinion emerged two 
years ago in the world environment conference in Rio de Janeiro. 
Malaysia and India have since softened their stance. 
  The effects on the labour market of greater environmental 
awareness were stressed by the ministers, with Spini recalling a 
report prepared for the European Union which showed that 2.1 
million new jobs could open up in this area between now and the 
year 2000. Cutting taxes on labour and taxing the environment 
would lead to a "double dividend" of more manpower being used 
while saving the environment, the ministers agreed. 
  Eco-taxes did not excite enthusiasm across the board in this 
weekend's meeting, however: the four European members came down 
in favour but Japan hedged and the United States and Canada were 
not at all keen. "On this point," Spini said, "all of the Seven 
agreed on the need to pay the costs of saving the environment 
from within, but each country said it would find its own 
solution." 
  The dangers of carbon dioxide, the gas held responsible for 
the Greenhouse Effect, were admitted by all the ministers, but 
the United States refused to be held to the 2000 deadline for 
bringing emissions back to 1990 accepted by the other six G-7 
members.

<F P=106> [Unattributed article: "Ciampi Opens Meeting of Environment </F>
Ministers"] 
  [Excerpts] Florence, 12 Mar (ANSA) -- The environment 
ministers from the Group of Seven industrialized nations, 
meeting here today and tomorrow for informal talks to prepare 
for the G-7 summit in Naples in July, are now given the 
opportunity to "jointly reflect on the relationships between the 
environment, technological progress and economic development," 
said Premier Carlo Azeglio Ciampi of Italy. 
  Opening the assembly in historic Palazzo Pitti, the 
government leader pointedly asked, "If the developing countries 
were to reach the same rate of consumption as our own in an 
uncontrolled way, how many more planets other than the earth 
would we need?" 
  The Italian [environment] minister, Valdo Spini, reminded 
his 
colleagues that, "One of the G-7 priorities should be that of 
launching a vast program of technological partnership to 
facilitate access to appropriate standards of high technology 
for the protection of the global environment. 
  "More in general, if we do not want developing nations to 
industrialize according to polluting models of the past, we 
cannot preach to them. We must, rather, help them introduce new 
clean technologies," said Spini. 
  Discussing the search for new instruments for financing 
sustainable development, the minister said, "Our economies will 
benefit from a partial shift in the distribution of taxes away 
from economic assets, such as work and capital, and towards the 
so-called environmentally-harmful, such as wastes, emissions and 
non-renewal resources. 
  "Eco-taxes can provide funds for the reduction of the public 
deficit and public-sector spending requirements at a cost lower 
than conventional rates," said the minister. Pursuing the same 
theme, Spini said, "Thanks to the fiscal lever, it will be 
possible to finance indispensable environment protection 
programs which involve job creation. The white paper approved 
by the European Union last December," he continued, "clarifies 
how an ambitious environment policy, as [European Commission 
President] Jacques Delors says, can create hundreds of thousands 
of jobs." 
  Concluding his remarks, the minister noted that the links 
between new jobs and eco-taxes will come up for further 
discussion in Detroit where the G-7 labor ministers begin 
meeting Monday [14 March]. [passage omitted] 
  Later in the day, Ciampi noted, "There are no simple 
solutions for complex problems. What is required is a 
systematic, open and innovative approach, with coordinated 
answers, more valid than the sum of the single answers." 
  In his statement to the ministers, the premier focused on 
the 
problem of financial resources and the aggravation of this 
problem by the present recession. In this connection he cited 
the need for a further search for "original solutions, based not 
so much on greater budget allocations as on the careful 
management of what we have available, on suiting our conduct to 
new development requirements, on a commitment to appropriate 
fiscal and credit incentive instruments, on further recourse to 
measures for energy saving and the development of renewable 
resources." Thus, he added, it will be necessary to "rule 
technological progress and not be ruled by it." 
  According to Ciampi, the "essence of sustainable development 
is, in fact, in a commitment to harmonize solid and lasting 
economic growth through the rational utilization of materials 
and economically-scarce energy resources, along with the need to 
avoid interventions by man which have negative impact on the 
local and global environment." 
  After noting the growing role played by environmental issues 
in the work of the annual G-7 summits, the premier recalled that 
the Rio de Janeiro Earth Conference "highlighted in an 
unequivocal way the unavoidable link between safeguarding the 
environment, productive processes and technologies." This is a 
matter of, on the one hand, "preventing pollution, climatic 
changes, the alteration of great natural spaces and, on the 
other, work for governing and quickly directing complex 
phenomena linked to populations and their habits, such as those 
related to disorderly demographic growth."

<F P=106> [Bronwen Maddox report: "Greenhouse faces stoning"] </F>
  [Text] For the past five years global warming has been high 
on the world's list of environmental worries. Outstripping 
other "green" concerns in the scale of its potential impact and 
in the complexity of its causes, it has offered the 
environmental movement some of its grandest images of apocalypse. 
  Industrialised countries took the threat so seriously that 
they made curbing emissions of carbon dioxide and other gases 
the target of a treaty negotiated at the Rio Earth Summit in 
1992. On Monday, that treaty becomes international law, 
following ratification by more than 50 countries; signatories 
will now have to draw up plans for curbing emissions. This week 
in Geneva, the United Nations has wrestled with proposals for a 
fund to help developing countries cut emissions too. 
  However, this legislative and bureaucratic effort is 
misguided, according to Global Warming: Apocalypse or Hot Air?, 
published this week by the Institute of Economic Affairs. The 
authors, Roger Bate and Julian Morris, are economists at the 
institute, a free-market think-tank. The introduction by 
Wilfred Beckerman, an Oxford economist fond of tilting at 
environmental exaggerations, urges resistance to the "cohorts of 
ecodoomsters who warn us we are living on the edge of the abyss". 
  Bate and Morris acknowledge that the science which underpins 
predictions of global warming is not in dispute. Physicists 
agree that some gases, including carbon dioxide, now referred to 
as "greenhouse gases", can trap heat which is emitted from the 
earth's surface and so prevent it passing into space. 
  The authors take issue, however, with the hypothesis that, 
if 
greenhouse gases build up in the atmosphere, the planet will 
warm up. The four leading models of climate change used 
worldwide suggest that, if carbon dioxide levels double, the 
world will warm up by between 1.9xC and 5.2OC from existing 
levels. 
  Among other criticisms, Bate and Morris say such climate 
models cannot fully explain the warming of about 0.5xC that 
appears to have taken place this century. Instead, warming may 
be occurring because monitoring stations are located near 
cities, which have been getting larger and warmer, they suggest. 
  These complaints are rejected by scientists studying models 
of climate change, such as Bruce Callander, head of the working 
party which weighs up scientific research for the United Nations 
Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change. In his view: "It is 
naive to bring up urbanisation as a problem, because it is 
recognised and has been thoroughly addressed." 
  Callander acknowledges that the models have many 
shortcomings. The behaviour of clouds remains the "single 
biggest uncertainty", he says; modellers are not sure whether 
clouds speed up warming or slow it down. But he adds: "The 
modellers themselves are the models' greatest critics." 
  Scientists admit that the global warming hypothesis is 
unproven, and that they will need years of further data to know 
whether predictions are accurate. The authors exaggerate the 
degree of scientific certainty and do not succeed in 
establishing that the threat of warming should be dismissed. 
  They are on stronger ground in looking at ways in which 
economists have tried to compensate for the imperfect state of 
scientific knowledge in formulating policy. 
  The pamphlet deftly picks holes in the green lobby's 
favourite claim that measures to improve energy efficiency are a 
"no-regrets" policy, providing benefits such as cheaper fuel 
bills as well as curbing emissions. The authors maintain that, 
if savings from investing in energy efficiency outstripped the 
costs, companies and households would have made those changes 
already. 
  They home in, too, on the spurious precision of 
"cost-benefit 
analysis" -- the technique of comparing the costs and benefits 
of a particular policy before deciding whether to proceed. The 
estimates are necessarily tentative, yet are often used as firm 
predictions; the UK government's recent proposals to tax rubbish 
dumping are a case in point. 
  But as in their attack on science, the authors are 
shadow-boxing at targets which are less solid than they claim. 
For instance, the policies which the authors warn would slow 
economic growth have not been implemented. The Rio convention, 
in the watered-down form which finally received international 
consent, tells countries only to draw up plans for curbing 
emissions, not to make cuts. And although the authors rail 
against the European Union's proposals for an energy tax, they 
seem not to have noticed that the proposals are stalled, if not 
dead. 
  In addition, the pamphlet's only recommendation -- dashed 
off 
in two paragraphs -- is that all taxes and subsidies on fossil 
fuels should be removed worldwide. "This is likely both to 
reduce emissions and increase global economic output," Bate and 
Morris state baldly. 
  The shortcomings of their case are unfortunate, because 
scepticism about environmental scaremongering is welcome and all 
too rare. So is the reminder that, in pandering to green 
populism, governments can put in place policies which are 
counter-productive and expensive. 
  The Rio convention will encourage governments to grapple 
with 
the important question of whether any international agreement to 
curb carbon dioxide emissions can be binding. Such treaties are 
almost impossible to police, as the emissions of individual 
countries are hard to monitor. Further, countries may be 
tempted to avoid the inconvenience and cost of the curbs, 
provided they can be satisfied that they will benefit from other 
countries continuing to observe them. 
  The only contribution which could settle the global warming 
debate, however, is more data about climate change. In 
Callander's words, "in 10 years we may say (scientists' 
investigation) has been an interesting exercise which came to 
nothing, or we may say that we were recognising something 
important happening in the atmosphere. At the moment, though, 
(the threat) should be taken seriously."

  [Text] Armscor this week revealed exactly how it is beating 
its swords into ploughshares. 
  At a military research seminar in Braamfontein, Armscor 
senior manager Dr. Andre Buys described how the only country in 
the world to ever dismantle a nuclear weapons capability had 
gone about it. 
  South Africa has 400kg of highly enriched uranium in storage 
15km from Pretoria, supposedly safe against terrorists -- unless 
they have scientists on their side, said Mr. David Albright, 
president of the US-based Institute for Science and 
International Security. 
  South Africa also had a controversial batch of tritium, 
which 
daramatically increases the power of nuclear weapons, imported 
from Israel in exchange for uranium. 
  As part of the scheme, the tritium was sold for use in 
fluorescent signs such as those on cinema exits. 
  South Africa -- the founder member of "the ex-nuclear club" 
-- realized it had to commercialize its technology if it was to 
succeed in dismantling its nuclear weapons capability, said Dr. 
Buys. 
  Scores of Armscor ideas were whittled down to 17 business 
units with processes stemming from the uranium enrichment 
programme. 
  Centrifuges designed to enrich uranium were adapted to 
reduce 
emissions from industrial stacks, to filter air for helicopter 
turbines and to improve ventilation. 
  Staff members at Armscor subsidiaries involved in the 
construction of nuclear devices also came up with 200 commercial 
ideas that were hacked down to six projects. 
  These were: 
  --Explosive cladding. Metals aluminium that cannot be 
welded conventionally are joined by explosives; 
  --Creating rare-earth magnets; 
  --Linking tungsten to copper or silver for use in 
electrical switchgear; 
  --Hot isostatic pressing which allowed components to be 
made from matallic powders; 
  --Pyrotechnic products which include special focused 
explosives to break up big boulders; and, 
  --A medical ventilator. 
  However, Dr. Buys said it was not known if the technology 
conversion would be successful in the long term. 
  "Since no one else has dismantled a nuclear weapons program, 
there is nowhere to look for advice." 
  The 400kg of highly enriched uranium outside Pretoria cannot 
immediately be reconstituted into weapon form. 
  And, with a glut of nuclear material on world markets, it is 
only worth R15-million. 
  But if, as the ANC wishes, it is used to make medical 
isotopes, the value will increase to R500-million. 
  However, Western nations oppose this option because they 
fear 
the "black bomb" -- industry terminology for a black nation with 
nuclear-weapons capability. 
  Mr. Albright said: "America doesn't want highly enriched 
uranium to remain in South Africa." 
  At the ANC's military research group meeting in Johannesburg 
this week, he said the West wanted the possibility of 
bomb-making removed from South African soil. 
  But Mr. Albright said: "The US government won't give up on 
highly enriched uranium. They don't want to hurt South Africa 
economically -- they just don't want it to have this power." 
  One the other side, the ANC was "upset by the lack of trust, 
the idea that it wants to create a black bomb." 
  "If highly enriched uranium wasn't present in South Africa, 
it would take years before it could get a nuclear weapon here," 
said Mr. Albright. 
  "But as it is, the project could be reconstituted in secret 
and it would take only a few months." 
  Mr. Dion Smith of Armscor confirmed that a maximum of 1,000 
South Africans had known about the nuclear military program -- 
so reconstitution in secret was not impossible. 
  The closest South Africa came to using one was in 1987. 
  Test-bomb shafts were dug in the Kalahari desert and later 
closed in the 70's. 
  But they were reopened in 1987, said the ANC's Roger 
Jardine, 
because "the Cubans were overrunning the SADF in Angola." 
  Dr. Buys said: "The shafts were reopened in relation to 
events in Angola. The war was reaching a semi-conventional state 
and it was backed by the Soviet Union." 
  The thinking was that if South Africa detonated a nuclear 
bomb in a shaft, the Americans would pick it up on satellite or 
seismic equipment and would be forced to help -- or risk SA 
using remaining "credible devices." 
  And so the watchers and the watched, former adversaries, 
continue to debate the chronology and detail of what really 
happened, with Armscor asking for a copy of a Soviet report it 
says "cannot exist."

  [Text] Geneva, 24 Mar (XINHUA) -- On the floor of the 
Conference on Disarmament in Geneva today, Hou Zhitong, head of 
the Chinese delegation, reiterated the Chinese Government's 
stand and views on nuclear disarmament, nuclear test ban, and 
other issues. 
  Hou Zhitong pointed out: China has never shirked its 
responsibility for promoting nuclear disarmament. China has 
always stood for the complete prohibition and thorough 
destruction of nuclear weapons. Since the first day when it came 
into possession of nuclear weapons, the Chinese Government has 
solemnly declared to the world its commitment of not being the 
first to use nuclear weapons at any time or under any 
circumstances. It has also undertaken not to use nuclear 
weapons against non-nuclear-weapon states or nuclear-free zones. 
  He said: In order to promote the process of nuclear 
disarmament and realize the goal of preventing nuclear war, the 
Chinese Government has recently taken further initiatives. On 
December 23 last year, the Chinese Government formally proposed 
to the United States, the Russian Federation, and other nuclear 
weapon states that negotiations be started among the five 
nuclear weapon states to conclude a "Treaty on the Non-First-Use 
of Nuclear Weapons." In early March this year, China again 
urged the four other nuclear states to give a positive response 
to China's initiative, and asked them to send delegations for 
talks in Beijing. It is the view of the Chinese Government that 
under the present international situation, the condition is ripe 
for the five nuclear weapon states to negotiate and conclude 
such an international treaty. The Chinese Government believes 
the conclusion of this treaty will significantly reduce the risk 
of nuclear war and provide security to the five nuclear weapon 
states, especially the small and medium-sized ones among them. 
It will also improve mutual trust and contribute to the 
prevention of nuclear proliferation. Such a treaty will also 
play an important role in realizing a comprehensive nuclear test 
ban and promoting nuclear disarmament. 
  Hou Zhitong expressed the hope that countries concerned will 
respond positively to China's initiative and start negotiations 
with a view to concluding a "Treaty on the Non-First-Use of 
Nuclear Weapons" as soon as possible. After that, they should 
go one step further by negotiating and concluding an 
international treaty on not using or threatening to use nuclear 
weapons against non-nuclear weapon states or nuclear-weapon-free 
zones, so as to make a decisive contribution to freeing mankind 
from the threat of nuclear war. 
  On the issue of a nuclear test moratorium, Hou Zhitong said: 
China has always exercised utmost restraint on nuclear testing 
and the number of the nuclear tests it has conducted is 
extremely limited. China has the lowest number of nuclear tests 
among all nuclear powers. China believes that an early 
conclusion of a comprehensive test ban treaty [CTBT] will 
contribute to the realization of the objective of complete 
prohibition and thorough destruction of nuclear weapons. In 
view of the above-mentioned considerations, the Chinese 
Government issued a statement on 5 October last year in support 
of an early conclusion of a CTBT, saying it will join other 
countries in the negotiations in an effort to conclude such a 
treaty no later than 1996. 
  Hou Zhitong pointed out: It is our opinion that an 
appropriate solution of the issue of security guarantees to the 
signatory states ought to be one of the tasks in the CTBT 
negotiation. The treaty should contain provisions for the 
signatory states with nuclear weapons to undertake not to use or 
threaten to use nuclear weapons against signatory states which 
do not possess nuclear weapons. At the same time, it should 
also provide for the signatory states with nuclear weapons to 
undertake not to be the first to use nuclear weapons against 
each other. With all nuclear weapon states undertaking the 
above-mentioned obligations, it will add to the substance of the 
CTBT, further the treaty's universality, and constitute a major 
contribution to international peace and security.

  [Text] Seoul, March 22 (YONHAP) -- The Seoul government 
grabbed "the stick" and considered using it Tuesday as the 
International Atomic Energy Agency [IAEA] sent the North Korean 
nuclear issue back to the United Nations Security Council. 
  The government's North Korea policy was finally pushed into 
a 
hard-line corner by the aggressive and crude remarks made by the 
chief North Korean delegate to an inter-Korean working-level 
contact last Saturday, when he threatened war against the South. 
  Realizing the futility of efforts to persuade Pyongyang to 
accept full IAEA inspections and help resolve the nuclear issue 
through dialogue, officials at Chongwadae [presidential office] 
and national security-related ministries huddled to discuss 
countermeasures against further North Korean provocation. 
  President Kim Yong-sam said Tuesday his government has asked 
the United States to deploy Patriot anti-missile missiles across 
the country as soon as possible. 
  South Korea and the United States have also agreed in 
principle to resume their joint military exercise "Team Spirit" 
this year. President Kim said a final decision on the war games 
will be made after he visits Japan and China. 
  Kim disclosed these plans at a meeting of senior Democratic 
Liberal Party officials including Chairman Kim Chong-pil and 
four party postholders. 
  Almost at the same time, Foreign Minister Han Sung-chu and 
Defense Minister Yi Pyong-tae met with U.S. ambassador to Seoul 
James Laney and the commander of U.S. forces in Korea, Gen. Gary 
Luck, to discuss the deployment of Patriot missiles here and the 
Team Spirit exercise. 
  Senior Presidential Secretary for Foreign and National 
Security Affairs Chong Chong-uk noted, "There has been nearly no 
change in North Korea's attitude since it announced its 
intention to withdraw from the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty 
last March. 
  "North Korea obviously wants to pursue its policy of 
improving relations with the United States while delaying 
inter-Korean dialogue with the eventual aim of eliminating 
Seoul's links with the United States," Chong said. 
  North Korea's use of "such a nuclear card," however, will no 
longer be effective, Chong declared. 
  At the hour-long breakfast meeting with ruling party 
leaders, 
President Kim expressed confidence that the South would repel 
any kind of provocation from North Korea. 
  After recalling all instances in which Pyongyang 
unilaterally 
frustrated Seoul's sincere attempts at dialogue and 
reconciliation, Kim said, "I did not expect the North to bring 
up talk of war last Saturday." 
  The matter was especially appalling because the North Korean 
chief delegate did not speak spontaneously but was reading a 
statement prepared earlier in Pyongyang, Kim said. 
  "Since we do not want the North isolated from the world 
community, we will leave the door open for dialogue," Kim said. 
  "But war should never break out on the Korean peninsula 
again 
under any circumstances. Preventing war is possible only when 
we are strong," Kim said, explaining his reason for ordering the 
deployment of Patriot missiles and considering resumption of 
Team Spirit this year. 
  The main opposition Democratic Party [DP], meanwhile, 
counselled the government Tuesday to refrain from "physical 
sanctions" against North Korea in favor of dialogue. 
  "If the government has determined that there is no immediate 
danger of war, it should be cautious in deciding on the 
deployment of the Patriot missiles and resumption of Team 
Spirit," said the party following a meeting of its policy-making 
Supreme Council. 
  "No one should be allowed to heighten tension on the Korean 
peninsula," the party said in a statement. "Resolution of the 
North Korean nuclear issue has to be made through a package 
deal." 
  The proposed exchange of special envoys between Seoul and 
Pyongyang will also have to be undertaken not as a precondition 
to resolve the issue but at the same time, the party said. 
  The DP then urged North Korea to accept IAEA inspection of 
its nuclear facilities to guarantee transparency of nuclear 
safeguards and apologize for the chief delegate's statement that 
"Seoul will turn into a sea of fire if war breaks out." 
  In addition, the opposition party pointed out that the Seoul 
government should have a consistent North Korea policy. 
  Kim Tae-chung, former chairman of the Democratic Party, said 
he "could not help being aghast at the sea-of-fire statement by 
the North Korean delegate," according to his spokesman, Chong 
Tong-chae. 
  Kim Tae-chung was extremely shocked after reading the 
remark, 
since the North Korean regime has been saying it was for "the 
people of Korea" whenever there was a chance. 
  Kim, however, advised South Korea to avoid being taken in by 
such an irrational provocation, Chong said.

<F P=106> [Article by reporter Kim Chun-pom: "Scenario for the </F>
Five-Stage Punishment for North Korea's Provocation"] 
  [Text] In answering a question at the National Assembly 
National Defense Committee on 23 March, ROK Defense Minister Yi 
Pyong-tae said: "The ROK Government has mapped out a strategic 
concept in which if North Korea perpetrates a provocation in the 
five northwestern islands or specific areas [tukchong chiyok], 
the ROK-U.S. Combined Forces or the ROK Armed Forces alone will 
offer powerful punitive retaliation [kangnyokhan ungjingbobok] 
and link this to an opportunity to wage a war to achieve 
reunification [tongiljonyok suhaengui kihoero yongyesikinda] 
depending on the state of the provocation." 
  Minister Yi made these remarks to stress that the ROK and 
the 
United States are all prepared for any emergency and are 
confident that they can meet any provocation of the North and to 
give a powerful warning to North Korea. 
  This is the first declaration that even though the 
government 
adheres to the principle of peaceful reunification, it has a 
plan not only to defend ourselves but to pursue even 
reunification with armed forces [muryoktongilggaji mirobuchil] 
depending on the state of the provocation. 
  This strategic concept stated by Minister Yi is based on a 
strategy of punitive retaliation contained in the "ROK-U.S. 
Combined Operations Plan (OP 5027). That is, this is a 
five-stage strategic concept in which if North Korea launches a 
preemptive attack, the government will not merely deter the 
enemy but conquer Pyongyang, isolate the North Korean regime, 
and enter into the stage of North-South reunification. 
  North Korea has deployed 8,400 long-range cannon and 2,400 
multi- warheaded missiles within 100 km of the DMZ at present. 
  It reportedly has developed or is developing "Taepodong-1 
and 
-2" missiles, in addition to the Nodong-1 and -2 and the Scud 
ground-to- ground missiles. 
  In particular, it has hidden in underground tunnels aircraft 
for transporting commando units to infiltrate into the rear area 
when it launches a southward invasion and has beefed up the 
antiair batteries in Yongbyon, where there are nuclear reactors, 
from five to 47. 
  In preparation against this, the United States has recently 
deployed five of the latest radar tracking devices and put areas 
north of the DMZ under comprehensive 24-hour surveillance and 
even mapped out a plan to attack those batteries in an emergency. 
  The five-stage ROK-U.S. combined operations plan goes like 
this: In the prewar stage (first stage), if the ROK and the 
United States detect dangerous signs from North Korea, they will 
immediately call in the rapid deterrent forces (FDO). 
  At that time, "Defcon (Defense condition) 3" will be issued, 
and the Armed Forces will assume a combat ready posture [jontu 
chunbi taese]. 
  This is because Seoul is a mere 40 km away from the DMZ and 
we have a mere 24- to 76-hour warning time for a North Korean 
attack. 
  Then, North Korea will bomb frontline units in a 
concentrated 
manner and send commando units to harass the rear of Seoul. As 
a result, major roads will be crowed with refugees, who will 
serve as a decisive obstacle to the ROK-U.S. Combined Forces' 
northward movements. 
  This is a second-stage situation. At that time, North Korea 
will infiltrate ground forces deployed along the DMZ into the 
South and attack Seoul in a concentrated manner by using Scud 
and Nodong-1 and -2 missiles. 
  In response, the ROK-U.S. Combined Forces will attack the 
central area of North Korea, advancing infantry units, and 
fighter planes by using their superior air fire power and 
Mistral, Hawk, and Nike missiles and intercept incoming missiles 
by using Patriot missiles. 
  This means that the defensive strategic concept which had 
been effective up until the mid-seventies and in which the ROK 
would launch a counterattack after abandoning Seoul has been 
replaced by a new concept in which the ROK would "repel North 
Korea north of Seoul." 
  At around this time, the aircraft carrier U.S.S. Carl Vinson 
of the 7th U.S. Fleet will be deployed to the East Sea [Sea of 
Japan] and strike the enemy's rear area in a concentrated manner. 
  At that time, AWACS early-warning planes and antisubmarine 
patrol planes (P-3C) will fly over the skies over the Korean 
peninsula, conduct aerial surveillance not only over North 
Korea, but also over areas of Russia and China, detect 
infiltrating aircraft and submarines in advance, and instruct 
the ground on shooting them down. 
  In the third stage, the armed forces will annihilate the 
major combat forces of North Korea, break through the DMZ, 
conduct large- scale landing operations, and advance northward. 
  At that time, the ROK and the United States will expand the 
frontline toward the Chongchon River, north of Pyongyang. 
  However, in this strategic concept, the ROK and the United 
States left the issue of whether they will advance toward the 
Yalu River at this stage for further deliberations depending on 
the situation. 
  No decision has been made on whether the 400,000 U.S. troops 
which will be reinforced with troops from the U.S. mainland will 
participate in the northward advance. The next stage is one of 
isolation. The forces will completely isolate Pyongyang from 
the rest of North Korea and establish a military rule, which 
includes civilian controls [chumintongjedung kunsatongchirul 
silsihanda]. 
  The final, fifth stage will be a postwar phase. At this 
stage, the ROK will take the initiative to achieve reunification 
on the Korean peninsula.

    [Editorial Report] Local vernacular dailies on 19 March 
carry editorials commenting on how the ROK Government should 
deal with North Korea regarding the nuclear issue in the wake of 
the announcement by the International Atomic Energy Agency that 
its inspection team was unable to satisfactorily inspect the 
North Korean nuclear facilities between 3 and 14 March because 
of North Korea's uncooperative attitude. The editorials note 
the little progress made in the inter-Korean working delegates' 
contact for the exchange of special envoys, and the possible 
cancellation of the third round of U.S.-North Korean high-level 
talks. 
  The moderate TONG-A ILBO carries on page 3 an 800-word 
editorial entitled "The Policy Toward the North Should Be 
Reviewed." The editorial begins, "It is undeniable that there 
have been two positions, dovish and hawkish, over the ways to 
resolve the North Korean nuclear issue. This was the case in 
the ROK as well as in the United States. Both the ROK and the 
U.S. Governments have so far maintained the dovish position 
exploring a solution through dialogue and diplomatic efforts. 
We admit that this dovish line has attained a degree of 
success." The editorial then notes, "However, the doves 
overlooked an important fact. It resulted from their distorted 
view that dealing with the issue in a hawkish manner was like 
not hesitating to wage a war. They should have admitted earlier 
that the hawkish position is aimed at the same objective, 
namely, a peaceful settlement. To preserve peace, we must make 
clear our firm position of resolutely dealing with any threat of 
war. This is all the more so especially when we deal with North 
Korea." The editorial notes, "The ROK even took a negative 
position as to the plan to deploy Patriot missiles in the ROK on 
the grounds that it could hurt the dialogue atmosphere, thus 
suffering an estrangement in ROK-U.S. relations. Now it is time 
to make a change," and concludes, "It seems that we have no more 
carrot to give. It is up to North Korea to make a choice." 
  The moderate HANGUK ILBO carries on page 3 an 800-word 
editorial entitled "It Is Time To Reestablish Policy Toward the 
North." The editorial notes, "The time has reached a point 
where we can no longer tolerate the North Korean attitude of 
breaking promises, its delaying and avoiding tactics. We should 
now reconfirm clear principles and reestablish our position. In 
case North Korea rejects full nuclear inspection and the envoy 
exchange, we should make clear our position as to the 
consideration of resumption of the Team Spirit joint military 
exercise and the deployment of Patriot missiles, and sanctions 
on North Korea. We should also consider the suspension of 
inter-Korean economic cooperation, including the ongoing 
unofficial inter-Korean trade." 
  The left-leaning HANGYORE SINMUN carries on page 3 a 
900-word 
editorial entitled "The Nuclear Inspection of North Korean 
Facilities and the Government's Measures." The editorial says, 
"The government should maintain a firm policy and continue to 
persuade North Korea since the situation is expected to worsen 
if the North Korean nuclear issue is referred to the UN Security 
Council. North Korea, on its part, should now review its 
strategy of negotiation with the United States and South Korea. 
Irrespective of North Korea's basic strategy, the North Korean 
attitude is narrowing the gap for negotiation of the dialogue 
advocates in South Korea and the United States and is 
encouraging the voice of those who oppose dialogue."

  [Text] Tokyo, March 24 KYODO -- Japan still hopes North 
Korea will opt to remove suspicions that the communist country 
is secretly developing nuclear weapons, Chief Cabinet Secretary 
Masayoshi Takemura said Thursday [24 March]. 
  "We will continue to expect North Korea to take desirable 
steps in accordance with international opinion," the top 
government spokesman told a news conference. 
  Takemura also said Japan will keep in close touch with the 
United States and South Korea to exchange views on ways of 
tackling the growing threats arising from North Korea's 
suspected nuclear weapons development program. 
  While acknowledging that Tokyo's diplomatic channels to 
Pyongyang remain closed, Takemura noted that its Foreign 
Ministry is striving to find ways to persuade North Korea 
indirectly to remove the suspicions concerning its nuclear 
development program. 
  Earlier this week, the International Atomic Energy Agency 
adopted a resolution referring the issue of North Korea's 
refusal to accept full inspections to the UN Security Council, 
which may subsequently consider economic sanctions against 
Pyongyang. 
  North Korea slammed Japan on Wednesday for considering 
backing such sanctions, saying, "if seditious forces dare to put 
unreasonable pressure upon us in the form of `sanctions,' we 
would regard it as something equivalent to `a declaration of 
war'." 
  Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa will confer with South 
Korean President Kim Yong-sam, who arrived in Tokyo on Thursday 
for a three-day stay, on possible ways to encourage North Korea 
to allay concerns that it is developing a nuclear weapon 
capability.

  [Text] Niigata, March 22 KYODO -- A Russian-registered 
oceanographic survey ship left here Tuesday [22 March] on a 
mission to monitor the effects on the Sea of Japan of 
radioactive waste dumping by a vessel of the Russian Pacific 
Fleet last year, Japanese Government officials said. 
  The dispatch of the 4,162-ton Okean by Japan, Russia and 
South Korea was called for by a conference of scientists held in 
the Russian far east city of Vladivostok last month. 
  The Okean carries nine Japanese Government officials and 27 
scientists from South Korea, Russia and the Vienna-based 
International Atomic Energy Agency. 
  The voyage is the first joint research effort by the three 
countries to study whether the sea is contaminated by 
radioactivity. 
  Seawater and seabed sediment samples will be collected by 
the 
Okean at seven points and measured for radioactivity, the 
officials said. 
  The Russian Navy on October 16 and 17 last year dumped 900 
tons of liquid nuclear waste in the Sea of Japan. A planned 
second dumping was canceled following protests from Japan and 
South Korea.

<F P=106> ["Statement of DPRK Foreign Ministry Spokesman on U.S. </F>
Perfidy" -- KCNA headline] 
  [Text] Pyongyang, March 21 (KCNA) -- A spokesman for the 
DPRK Foreign Ministry issued a statement today clarifying the 
position of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea toward the 
United States' perfidious act of reversing the agreed 
conclusions reached at the DPRK-U.S. contact in New York. 
  The statement reads: 
  The United States has committed a perfidious act by totally 
reversing the agreed conclusions reached at the DPRK-U.S. 
contact on February 25 in New York. 
  As is known, the DPRK and the United States at the New York 
contact on February 25 agreed upon four immediate steps of 
simultaneous action for a package solution to the nuclear issue 
-- suspension of the Team Spirit 94 joint military maneuvers, 
resumption of the working-level contact for the exchange of 
presidential envoys between the North and South, acceptance of 
an inspection by the International Atomic Energy Agency [IAEA] 
for maintaining the continuity of safeguards holding of the 
third round of the DPRK-USA talks in Geneva on March 21. 
  The agreement on these steps of simultaneous actions marked 
an important occasion in bringing back to its track the 
detracted process of a peaceful solution to the nuclear issue. 
  Out of our sincere desire to achieve a negotiated solution 
to 
the nuclear issue at any cost, we have honestly fulfilled our 
obligations pursuant to the agreed conclusions. 
  We accepted the IAEA inspectors' group at the designated 
date 
and sincerely provided them with all conditions so that they 
could conduct inspection activities of enough scope for 
maintaining the continuity of safeguards at the seven declared 
facilities. 
  Even when the IAEA side rudely requested sampling and 
measurement that go far beyond the agreed scope for the 
continuity of safeguards, we met its demand as much as possible, 
showing our utmost good will. 
  We have held several rounds of working-level contact with 
the 
South side and made every effort possible for an early exchange 
of special envoys between the North and South, proposing 
detailed ways and reasonable measures. The U.S. side, however, 
has fulfilled none of its obligations, making empty talk since 
the publication of the New York agreement of February 25. 
  Although the United States announced suspension of the Team 
Spirit 94 joint military exercises and the date of the opening 
of the third round of DPRK-U.S. talks, it unreasonably made them 
conditional, saying that it would keep that promise only after 
the inspection by the IAEA had been made satisfactorily and the 
special envoys exchanged between the North and South. 
  This was a violation of the New York agreement based on the 
principle of simultaneous action. 
  The United States has gone so far as to break the New York 
agreement on the steps of simultaneous action, alleging that the 
IAEA's inspection of the DPRK's nuclear facilities was not 
satisfactory and the exchange of presidential envoys between the 
North and South has not been realised. 
  The United States threatens that if the DPRK does not allow 
inspection by the IAEA and does not realise the exchange of 
special envoys between the North and South, it will resume the 
Team Spirit joint military exercises in 1994, will not have the 
third round of DPRK-U.S. talks and will transfer the problem of 
the DPRK to the United Nations Security Council. 
  In the meantime, the secretariat of the IAEA is going to 
convene a meeting of the Board of Governors to adopt a 
"resolution" against the DPRK. 
  Thus, the United States has openly reversed the New York 
agreement and totally destroyed the foundation for the third 
round of talks, darkening the prospect of the settlement of the 
nuclear issue, at this crucial moment when its settlement is in 
sight. This is motivated by its consistent hostile policy 
toward the DPRK. 
  It is obvious that the United States set unreasonable 
preconditions which are not specified in the New York agreement 
because they sought from the beginning the political purpose of 
stifling the DPRK, not a solution to the nuclear issue through 
DPRK- U.S. talks. 
  The United States is distorting the fact, claiming that 
their 
unreasonable preconditions were included in the agreement with 
the DPRK. But they had been refuted by the DPRK's reasonable 
argument at the time of the discussion of the New York agreement. 
  Even after the publication of the agreed conclusions, they 
are insisting on the unilateral preconditions rejected by the 
DPRK. This cannot be construed otherwise than a deliberate 
scheme to break the New York agreement and create a phase of 
confrontation. 
  In actuality, the United States is playing first fiddle in 
an 
international campaign for putting pressure on the DPRK, openly 
revealing its intention to stage the team spirit 94 joint 
military maneuvers and let the U.N. Security Council take 
"sanctions" against the DPRK on the pretext of the problems in 
the IAEA's inspection and the exchange of special envoys between 
the North and South. 
  All the facts clearly prove that the United States has 
neither the intention to continue talks nor the will to solve 
the nuclear issue but only schemes to isolate and stifle the 
DPRK with the nuclear issue and the DPRK-U.S. talks as an 
expedient. 
  This perfidious act of the United States is creating a grave 
situation on the Korean peninsula, which may bring the Korean 
nation back to the phase of confrontation and war. 
  Now that the United States has broken the New York agreement 
and brought the DPRK-U.S. talks to a rupture, leading the 
situation to the extreme pitch of strain, we can no longer 
unilaterally fulfil our obligations concerning the steps of 
simultaneous action. 
  Therefore, we have decided not to send our delegation to the 
third round of DPRK-U.S. talks. 
  Since the United States and the IAEA are deliberately 
distorting the results of the recent inspection for the 
continuity of safeguards and using it as a pretext for putting 
pressure on the DPRK, we will no longer deem it our obligation 
to ensure the continuity of safeguards. 
  This measure of ours accords with the principle of the New 
York agreement of February 25, which stipulates that the 
fulfilment of each simultaneous action agreed upon is necessary 
for the implementation of all the agreed conclusions. 
  Unshakable and consistent is our position that we are not 
bound by our promise with the United States once the latter 
breaks its promise with us. 
  The DPRK Government in its statement dated March 12 last 
year 
said that our declared withdrawal from the Nuclear 
Nonproliferation Treaty (NPT) was caused mainly by the U.S. 
nuclear threat to the DPRK, including the Team Spirit joint 
military exercises, and its policy of stifling the DPRK and the 
partiality of the IAEA. 
  In the DPRK-U.S. joint statement of June 11, 1993 in New 
York, we made it clear that we would unilaterally and 
temporarily suspend the effectuation of our withdrawal from the 
NPT, on condition that the DPRK-U.S. talks for a solution to the 
nuclear issue continued. 
  If the United States avoids the DPRK-U.S. talks and 
increases 
nuclear threat to the DPRK, resuming the team spirit joint 
military exercises in 1994, and if the IAEA widens its 
partiality and resorts to strong-arm politics and pressure, 
distorting the results of the recent inspection of the DPRK 
nuclear facilities, we have no alternative but to carry into 
practice the measures declared in the DPRK Government's 
statement of March 12 last year in order to defend the 
sovereignty of the nation and the security of the state. 
  Even if the settlement of the nuclear issue is delayed 
because of the failure of the DPRK-U.S. talks, we are not in a 
hurry at all. 
  The United States must ponder over the prevailing situation, 
looking straight at its seriousness.

  [Text] Tokyo, March 24 (YONHAP) -- North Korea is willing 
to reopen talks with the United States if the latter offers to 
suspend joint military exercises with South Korea and tries to 
solve the nuclear problem through dialogue, a Pyongyang official 
at the United Nations was quoted as saying Wednesday. 
  KYODO news service reported from New York that the North 
Korean official indicated his government would allow additional 
inspections by the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) if 
the United States came to the negotiating table. 
  The official offered neither a confirmation nor a denial 
when 
asked if North Korea and the United States had been in contact 
since the nuclear issue was referred to the UN Security Council. 
  "No comment," he was quoted as saying. 
  Washington canceled its scheduled March 21 high-level talks 
with Pyongyang after the stalinist state refused to allow full 
nuclear inspections by the IAEA. 
  The agency has referred the matter to the Security Council, 
which is preparing a resolution on North Korea for next week. 
Seoul and Washington, meanwhile, are seriously considering 
resumption of their joint military exercises "Team Spirit" this 
year. 
  The North Korean official expressed high hopes on the stance 
of Beijing, which has openly declared its opposition to any 
harsh action against Pyongyang such as sanctions. 
  "We have maintained friendly relations for over 40 years 
since the Korean war," KYODO quoted him as saying. "We will 
continue to strengthen these relations."

  [Text] A news conference was held yesterday [23 March] at 
the DPRK Embassy in Moscow. DPRK Ambassador Son Song-pil 
briefed Russian reporters on the DPRK Foreign Ministry 
spokesman's statement regarding the rupture of DPRK-U.S. talks. 
  Ambassador Son Song-pil pointed out that Pyongyang cannot 
but 
take countermeasures against pressure on resuming Team Spirit, 
an ROK-U.S. joint military exercise. 
  Last March, the DPRK declared its decision to withdraw from 
the Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty [NPT], but temporarily 
suspended its effectuation of such a decision last July so as to 
resume talks with the United States. 
  He pointed out that the DPRK cannot but implement its 
decision to withdraw from the NPT if the U.S. Administration 
breaks up talks with Pyongyang and resumes the Team Spirit 
exercise to step up the nuclear threat against the North. 
  He added: Continuing dialogue is also in the interest of the 
United States. We are not in any hurry as time is on our side.

  [Text] Damascus, 23 Mar (SANA) -- Pak Di-Chun (name as 
received], ambassador of the Democratic People's Republic of 
Korea in Damascus, has said his country has decided not to send 
its delegation to the third round of Korean-U.S. negotiations. 
Nor will it continue to consider itself bound by its 
obligations to the International Atomic Energy Authority [IAEA]. 
  In a statement to a SANA correspondent, the ambassador said 
this follows the distortion by the United States and the IAEA of 
the results of the recent inspection of its nuclear facilities. 
This was used as a pretext to pressure the DPRK. 
  He said his government took this measure based on the 
principles contained in the Korean-U.S. agreement reached in New 
York on 25 February 1994 which stipulate a simultaneous move on 
both sides to secure the full implementation of this agreement. 
  He said it is his government's firm and continuous position 
not to abide by its pledges to the United States as long as the 
latter is breaking its pledges. 
  The Korean ambassador noted that the United States resorted 
to distorting and fabricating the issue dealing with the IAEA's 
inspection. It used it as an excuse to resume joint military 
maneuvers with South Korea and to threaten the use of force to 
exert pressure against the Korean Government. Moreover, it 
reveals a U.S. intention to have the UN Security Council impose 
sanctions on his country. He said the United States should make 
an accurate and responsible assessment of the current situation. 
  The ambassador expressed his deep appreciation of the 
Government of the Syrian Arab Republic for supporting his 
government's just and reasonable stand toward the nuclear issue.

  [Text] Pyongyang, March 23 (KCNA) -- U.S. President Bill 
Clinton reportedly ordered the deployment of Patriot missiles in 
South Korea, saying the missiles would serve the interests of 
the United States and South Korea. 
  This is a provocative step to drive the situation into 
extremes by screwing up the tensions on the Korean peninsula. 
  Out of an intentional scheme to create an atmosphere of 
confrontation against the DPRK, the United States totally 
reversed the agreed conclusions reached between the DPRK and the 
U.S. at the New York contact on February 25 and broke off the 
DPRK-U.S. talks and now has become all the more undisguised in 
its military threats and pressure against the DPRK, saying the 
"Team Spirit" joint military exercises would be resumed. 
  Clinton's order of the deployment of Patriot missiles in 
South Korea is a grave threat to the DPRK, and it clearly shows 
that the United States is pushing the situation of the Korean 
peninsula to the brink of war.

<F P=106> [By reporter Yu Yong-won] </F>
  [Text] To what extent will North Korea's ground-to-ground 
missile be developed? The status quo of North Korea's missile 
development is gaining much interest after foreign news reported 
that North Korea is developing new ground-to-ground missiles 
tentatively named "Taepodong Nos. 1 and 2" with ranges from 
2,000 to 3,500 km. 
  In connection with this, a government intelligence source 
said, "It is true that North Korea is developing new missiles 
with a range of 2,000 to 3,500 km. ROK and U.S. intelligence 
authorities are closely tracking this." With North Korea's 
development of new missiles, the first thing of concern is the 
relationship between the already known Nodong Nos. 1 and 2, and 
Taepodong Nos. 1 and 2. 
  North Korea began developing the Nodong No. 1 in 1989 and 
successfully test-launched it for the first time in May 1993. 
It has a range of 1,000 km which covers Tokyo, Japan but has 
not been deployed to an actual fighting position. The existence 
of the Nodong No. 2 was first known in last year's U.S. Senate 
report, but its specifications have not yet been confirmed. Its 
range is estimated to be 1,500 to 2,000 km and a prototype is 
expected to be introduced next year. 
  The Taepodong Nos. 1 and 2 are the newest missiles 
discovered 
at a missile research center in Sanum-tong, Pyongyang by a U.S. 
spy satellite in February 1994. That was the first time the 
U.S. spy satellite discovered the missiles stacked in the open 
air with improved Scud B missiles and Nodong No. 1's. Judging 
from the size of the propellants, Taepodong No. 1 is estimated 
to have a range of 2,000 km, and Taepodong No. 2 approximately 
3,500 km. 
  Considering that the range of the Taepodong No. 1 is 
estimated to be 2,000 km, ROK and U.S. intelligence officials 
are reportedly closely analyzing the possibility of this being 
the Nodong No. 2. 
  Specialists are focusing their attention to the background 
of 
the fact that North Korea developed various types of new 
missiles in only one year and keeps expanding the ranges of 
missiles. 
  Usually, it takes several years to develop just one type of 
missile and it is also questionable that North Korea keeps 
expanding the ranges, although only 1,000 km would cover the 
Korean peninsula and major regions of Japan. 
  Specialists believe that, as in the case of Nodong Nos. 1 
and 
2, the new missiles are being developed at the order of Middle 
Eastern countries, including Iran, for exports to the region, or 
are aimed to cover major U.S. bases in the Pacific, including 
Guam. 
  Others also point out that these may be false prototypes 
considering that North Korea displayed them in the open air 
knowing that they were under the surveillance of U.S. spy 
satellites. 
  Specialists analyze that even if North Korea develops and 
deploys Taepodong Nos. 1 and 2 in actual fighting, these will be 
of less threat to South Korea than Scud B or improved Scub B's 
because, like Nodong Nos. 1 and 2, Taepodong Nos. 1 and 2 also 
use a Scud B as the main body but reduce the weight of warheads 
to expand the range, and thus their accuracy and destructive 
power are inferior to those of the Scud B. 
  However, ROK and U.S. authorities believe that if North 
Korea's missile development continues with this trend, it may be 
able to develop strategic mid-range ballistic missiles with a 
4,000 to 5,000-km range in the near future and create 
missile-phobia in Northeast Asia. The authorities are seeking 
various countermeasures while closely watching North Korea's 
missile development trend.

  [Text] Yi Chung-kuk, a sergeant of the North Korean Army 
affiliated to the nuclear chemical defense bureau who defected 
on 18 March, said in a news conference on 22 March that North 
Korea is capable of killing all the people in the South with 
just the chemical weapons and bacterial weapons it now possesses. 
  Yi Chung-kuk said that currently North Korea has facilities 
that produce biochemical weapons and storage bases under the 
Ministry of the People's Armed Forces in various places. He 
also exposed that the chemical weapons are the most poisonous in 
the world. 
  He said he heard on several occasions beginning in 1991 from 
high-ranking military cadres and his senior officers that North 
Korea has already completed nuclear weapons development. When 
North Korea was receiving a special [tukpyol] inspection in 
March 1993 from the International Atomic Energy Agency, he said 
he heard from his senior officer that it will be of no use to 
inspect Yongbyon because nuclear weapons are being produced at 
another place.

  [Text] Seoul, March 22 (YONHAP) -- A North Korean Army 
sergeant who defected to the South last week said on Tuesday 
that the People's Army has bio-chemical weapons so toxic that 
they may kill or paralyze the whole 40 million South Korean 
people in the event of war. 
  Sfc. Yi Chung-kuk formerly of a North Korean CBR (Chemical, 
Biological and Radiological Warfare) unit told a press 
conference in Seoul that North Korea mass-produced bio-chemical 
weapons developed by the medical school of Kim Il-song 
University and People's Army Medical College. 
  "I heard laboratories tested newly developed bio-chemical 
weapons on living bodies of political prisoners," Yi said. 
  "It was also said that in an area near Chagang Province 
where 
a chemical plant is located, many nearby people suffered serious 
headache and pregnant women gave birth to deformed babies due to 
the leak of toxic substance in June last year." 
  He said high North Korean military officers used to 
encourage 
soldiers by saying that they had nothing to fear because the 
People's Army possesses nuclear arms. 
  Yi said he learned that North Korean officers trained at 
Soviet military academies cannot be promoted to general since a 
coup attempt by those taught at military academies in the former 
USSR was uncovered in October 1992. 
  About his defection, Yi said he left his home in Pyongyang 
on 
last Nov. 9 and smuggled himself to Yanji in northeastern 
China. He could come to South Korea through a third country with 
the help of ethnic Koreans in Yanji, he said. 
  Yi said that in the People's Army he served as a calculator 
at the "counter-nuclear and atomic analysis center" of nuclear 
and chemical defense bureau of the People's Army General Staff. 
  The duty of the analysis center is to assess a contaminated 
area, wind direction and other data in case CBR weapons are used 
in war and distribute the data obtained to all People's Army 
units, he said.

<F P=106> [Article by reporter Kim Hyon-ik] </F>
  [Text] President Kim Yong-sam on 21 March called an urgent 
meeting of security-related ministers and discussed the crisis 
situation on the Korean peninsula created by the North Korean 
threat of war and its rejection of nuclear inspection, and 
decided an early deployment of Patriot missiles and the 
resumption of the ROK-U.S. joint military exercise. 
  The meeting discussed the analyses of the present situation 
by the Agency for National Security Planning [NSP], the National 
Unification Board [NUB], the Foreign Ministry, and the Ministry 
of National Defense [MND], and discussed measures to cope with 
the situation. The meeting analyzed that there is little 
likelihood of North Korea making actual armed provocation, but 
decided to formulate preparatory measures for all the potential 
developments, including the North Korean armed provocation 
against the South. 
  At the meeting President Kim stressed that the ROK should 
defend peace on the Korean peninsula and that the ROK is capable 
of doing it, and requested the participants in the meeting to 
take all necessary measures to establish the posture to cope 
with any contingency. 
  The meeting assessed that North Korea will keep up even 
steeper tensions on the Korean peninsula in the short run, and 
decided to have an unidentified number of Patriot missiles 
deployed soon and get the Team Spirit joint military exercise 
resumed in April. The meeting also extensively discussed ways 
to build up the ROK-U.S. combined defense capability. 
  Initially the meeting was supposed to decide the timing of 
the resumption of the Team Spirit exercise watching North 
Korea's attitude, but since "even tougher steps," such as the 
withdrawal from the Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty [NPT] and 
replacing fuel rods, can be taken by North Korea, the meeting 
concluded that the Team Spirit exercise has to be conducted in 
April. 
  The meeting concluded that in view of the North Korean 
side's 
attitude of rupturing the envoy exchange on 19 March, the 
inter-Korean dialogue will have to be suspended for the time 
being, and confirmed the principle that the ROK will intensify 
international alliances by such means as participating in 
international sanctions by the IAEA and the UN Security Council. 
  The meeting decided that the ROK will closely cooperate with 
Japan and China to this end and that President Kim will take the 
matter up intensively during his visit to Japan and China. 
  The meeting decided that the ROK will explain to China -- 
which is persistently advocating its principled position that 
the North Korean nuclear issue should be resolved peacefully -- 
that international sanctions are unavoidable for peace and 
security in Northeast Asia. The meeting decided to request 
China to persuade North Korea in this connection. 
  The meeting also agreed that international sanctions will be 
reconsidered if North Korea admits its mistake, completely 
permits the IAEA inspections, thereby ensuring the nuclear 
transparency, and sincerely comes to the inter-Korean dialogue 
for envoy exchange, before the UN Security Council decides 
sanctions. 
  The meeting, however, on the basis of its reflection that 
the 
appeasement policy toward the North brought about the North 
Korean insincerity and misjudgment, decided that the ROK will 
maintain a resolute position. 
  President Kim noted that North Korea intends to take 
advantage of the crisis atmosphere inspired by its raving about 
not hesitating a war despite the extreme economic difficulty it 
is suffering, and instructed the participants in the meeting to 
establish a military posture of countermeasures and to intensify 
public information activity for the people to prevent the people 
from turning restless. 
  Participating in the security-related ministers meeting held 
for the second time at Chongwadae [presidential residence] this 
year were Prime Minister Yi Hoe-chang; Yi Yong-tok, deputy prime 
minister and minister of the NUB; Foreign Minister Han Sung-chu; 
Minister of Home Affairs Choe Hyong-u; Defense Minister Yi 
Pyong-tae; NSP Director Kim Tok; Chon Yong-taek, director of 
contingency plans; Yi Yang-ho, chairman of the Joint Chiefs of 
Staff; Pak Kwan-yong, secretary general of the Presidential 
Secretariat; Chong Chong-uk, senior presidential secretary for 
foreign and national security affairs; and Chu Ton-sik, 
presidential spokesman.

  [Text] Seoul, March 23 (YONHAP) -- Defense Minister Yi 
Pyong-tae said Wednesday that the South Korean and U.S. 
Governments are discussing when to resume the Team Spirit 
military exercise, which will include Patriot missiles. 
  Yi told the National Assembly's National Defense Committee 
that the exercise may begin in late April, mid-May or sometime 
after that. 
  He said, "as North Korea failed to fulfill the two 
preconditions for suspension of Team Spirit, resumption of the 
exercise has become inevitable. The maximum number of U.S. 
Forces possible will take part in the exercise for maximum 
effect." 
  He explained that Team Spirit will include command post 
exercises and such practical maneuvers as river crossings and 
emergency landings. 
  North Korea walked out of the latest inter-Korean 
working-level contact on Saturday, rupturing the dialogue on 
exchanging special envoys, and warned Monday that it would 
withdraw from the Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty (NPT) if Team 
Spirit was resumed this year. 
  In response to threats by Pyongyang, South Korea and the 
United States plan to deploy Patriot missiles near Seoul soon in 
preparation for an emergency. 
  The Patriots are expected to arrive here next month in time 
for Team Spirit. 
  Yi said, "Patriot anti-missile missiles will also be part of 
the exercise. One Patriot battalion can fight 55 incoming 
aircraft simultaneously and has the incidental capability of 
intercepting Scud missiles." 
  The government will decide the date for resumption of Team 
Spirit after considering the effect on farmers and likely 
outcome of the joint exercise. 
  "Once the government officially announces the resumption of 
Team Spirit, it will be difficult to suspend the exercise 
again," he said. 
  He did not rule out the possibility of North Korean 
provocation after the United Nations discusses possible economic 
sanctions. 
  "The government is working out countermeasures of two kinds 
-- one before the U.N. Security Council decides on sanctions 
against North Korea and the other after the decision," he said. 
  Yi said Seoul and Washington will hold consultations after 
the Security Council makes a decision on sanctions. 
  If sanctions are imposed, he said North Korea may try to 
endure the pressure but would eventually be compelled to accede 
to the council's demands. 
  "But if Pyongyang judges the United Nations' deterrent power 
is not enough to defeat it, you cannot rule out that possibility 
and it may choose military provocation," he said.

    [Editorial Report] The following is a compilation of 
articles in Seoul vernacular newspapers published on 23 March 
reacting to the U.S. and ROK decision to deploy Patriots 
missiles to the ROK. 
  The moderate KYONGHYANG SINMUN on page 3 carries a 900-word 
article by Washington-based correspondent Yi Chong-yon entitled: 
"The Background Behind the U.S. Decision To Deploy Patriots." 
The article notes that in the wake of the rupture of 
North-South contacts, the U.S. policy toward North Korea has 
shifted from "diplomatic negotiations" to "exercising pressure" 
and reports "the deployment of Patriots has brought up 
speculation that the United States will impose gradual pressure 
on North Korea by demonstrating its power." The article notes: 
"The deployment of Patriots is apparently aimed at grasping the 
initiative on the nuclear issue, rather than giving up dialogue 
with North Korea." 
  While noting that the United States is assuming a 
two-pronged 
stance toward North Korea -- demonstrating power while taking a 
cautious approach on North Korea -- the article reports the 
diplomatic goal of the United States is "not isolating North 
Korea from the international community, but inducing it to join 
in the international nuclear order." The article notes that the 
United States is not giving up its efforts for dialogue since it 
estimates that a UN resolution will have little effect on North 
Korea and that it is not in the interest of the United States to 
heighten the tension on the Korean peninsula. The article 
predicts "chances are high that the North Korean nuclear issue 
will be back on the negotiating table after a cooling-off 
period." 
  The moderate HANGUK ILBO on page 3 carries a 900-word 
article 
by Washington-based correspondent Yi Sang-sok entitled: "The 
United States is Taking a Cautious Approach on North Korea." 
The article writes: "It is ironic that the U.S. decision on 
the Patriots has a diplomatic meaning rather than a military 
one." Reporting that the Patriots will take more than a month 
to reach the ROK, the article notes "that leaves plenty of time 
for the U.S. Government to try diplomatic persuasion to pry open 
North Korea's nuclear facilities for international inspection. 
This shows that the United States wants to go the extra mile 
with diplomacy before considering military steps on the North." 
  Recalling that the U.S. Government announced its plan on the 
deployment earlier than expected, the article interprets this 
move as "U.S. efforts to maximize its firm stance on the North 
Korean nuclear issue by coordinating the timing with the UN 
Security Council's discussions on the issue." The article 
concludes: "The United States will not give up its efforts to 
peacefully resolve the nuclear issue." 
  The left-leaning HANGYORE SINMUN on page 2 carries a 
700-word 
article by O Tae-kyu from the "Fluoroscope" column. The article 
recalls the past commitments made by high-level ROK Government 
officials that they will not bring in the Patriots and then 
expresses regret that "with the North Korean chief delegate's 
remark on turning Seoul into a fireball, the deployment of 
Patriots has become a resolute issue inside the government." 
The article points out the deployment is "a by-product of a 
shrewd trick of U.S. arms dealers who are making the most of the 
current tense situation." Noting that the issue on deploying the 
Patriots was not included in the North Korean-U.S. agreement 
reached in New York, the article writes: "The U.S. and ROK 
Governments, however, decided to deploy the Patriots missiles as 
soon as the North-South contact ruptured, giving an impression 
that they were hoping for it," and maintains that an "immediate 
decision on the deployment, which was made under the pretext of 
the rupture of North-South contact, is a jump of logic." The 
article urges the government to clearly manifest the background 
behind such a decision to allay the people's suspicion on the 
deployment.

  [Text] Seoul, March 21 (YONHAP) -- "If war breaks out, 
Seoul will turn into a sea of fire!" 
  These vicious words spat out by the chief North Korean 
delegate to the inter-Korean working-level contact last Saturday 
stunned even those South Koreans who have become inured to 
violent language from the North. 
  As the full weight of North Korea's statement and other 
harsh 
remarks sank in, Seoul government officials and politicians 
scurried in search of countermeasures. 
  Both the ruling and opposition parties held official 
meetings 
Monday to condemn North Korea's statement and urge Pyongyang 
once again to continue inter-Korean dialogue. 
  At a meeting of Democratic Liberal Party postholders, almost 
everybody took up the "sea-of-fire" remark and pressed the 
government to map out and pursue a consistent North Korea policy. 
  DLP Chairman Kim Chong-pil said, "The North Korean nuclear 
problem is indeed very serious, but it appeaars many South 
Koreans appear to be little concerned." 
  "There are still people in the South who insist on holding 
behind-the-scenes talks with the North," Kim Chong-pil said. 
"However, we will have to wake up from such illusion and prepare 
to meet the situation quietly but strongly with firm resolution." 
  Rep. Yi Se-ki, chairman of the DLP Policy Committee, noted 
past criticism that the Seoul government has been too optimistic 
about the North Korean nuclear issue and too dependent on the 
United States. 
  "There has also been criticism that the government lacks a 
consistent North Korea policy," Yi said. 
  The ruling party, he added, has been reviewing the 
government 
policy on North Korea and urging President Kim Yong-sam's 
administration to deal squarely with the latest developments. 
  Rep. Yi Han-tong, DLP floor leader at the National Assembly, 
said he plans to confer with the party leadership on a move to 
convene the foreign affairs and national unification committee 
to work out measures on the parliamentary level. 
  Rep. So Su-chong called on the military to take urgent steps 
in order to dispel the anxiety felt by ordinary citizens. 
  DLP Spokesman Ha Sun-pong said in a statement that the 
remark 
about "the sea of fire, which is practically a declaration of 
war, debased the dignity of South Koreans." 
  "We condemn North Korea for making such violent remarks, 
threatening war and inciting riots in South Korea," ha said. 
"The North Korean remarks are anti-Korean people and an 
anti-unification action." 
  Seoul should keep open a dialogue channel with Pyongyang, 
but 
it will have to maintain a firm and resolute position in its 
negotiations with the North, Ha said. 
  The main opposition Democratic Party reacted strongly to the 
North Korean threat, while at the same time urging the Seoul and 
Washington governments to continue serious efforts to engage in 
dialogue. 
  The DP held a supreme council meeting Monday morning and 
decided to demand an emergency meeting of the foreign affairs 
and national unification committee to hear a government report 
on the issue. 
  In a special statement, adopted at Monday's meeting, the 
party declared that "there should be no war under any 
circumstances." It expressed regret over the North Korean threat 
of warfare which, it said, had shocked peace-loving South 
Koreans as well as all other people in the world. 
  "North Korea has to accept IAEA inspections of its nuclear 
facilities," the statement said. 
  "It also is not proper for the United States to make a hasty 
decision on the resumption of the Team Spirit military exercise 
and a possible deployment of Patriot anti-missile missiles," the 
DP statement said. 
  It asserted that the oppostion party opposes any 
confrontation or heightening of tension on the Korean peninsula. 
Instead, South and North Korea and the United States must 
continue to talk in order to break the nuclear impasse. 
  The minor opposition United People's Party said it strongly 
condemns North Korea for rupturing inter-Korean dialogue and 
threatening to turn Seoul into a sea of fire. 
  In a statement read by spokesman Kim Su-il, the party called 
on North Korea to go with the changing current in the world.

    [Editorial Report] The following is a compilation of 
editorials from Seoul vernacular press published on 22 March on 
the rupture of North-South working-level contacts for the 
exchange of special envoys and remarks made by senior North 
Korean delegate at the 19 March contact. 
  The conservative daily CHOSON ILBO publishes on page 3 a 
1,200- word editorial entitled: "How Can They Threaten `War'?" 
Describing the "venomous remarks" made by the North Korean 
delegate during the eighth working-level contact that "Seoul is 
not far from here. If a war breaks out, Seoul will become a sea 
of fire and you cannot survive," as "shuddering," the editorial 
reports his remarks disclosed the "true color" of North Korea. 
The editorial expresses doubts that North Korea can hardly 
become a "dialogue partner" in peacefully resolving the nation's 
problems and that "no nation" in the international community 
"supports" the North Korean position. Stressing that the 
international community cannot have "perseverance" if North 
Korea persists in an "unreasonable policy" regarding North-South 
relations and the nuclear issue, the editorial notes that our 
side is "well aware" of North Korean capabilities and will take 
"resolute countermeasures" when North Korea commits an act of 
"disturbing" the peace of the world. The editorial urges the 
North to ponder "coolly" the consequences of its radical 
hard-line steps and to act with discretion. Otherwise, the 
"collapse" of the Kim Il-song system and "North Korean-style 
socialism" will be "expedited." 
  CHOSON ILBO publishes on page 3 a 1,300-word editorial 
entitled: "We Reprove the Government." Defining the incumbent 
government's policies on diplomacy, security, reunification, and 
North Korea as a "comprehensive failure," the editorial calls on 
the Kim Yong-sam government to keenly realize the current "very 
serious situation," and reports that the North side's 
"intentional mockery and threat" including the "Seoul in a sea 
of fire" remarks made by the North delegate at "official talks" 
are the result of the government's "easy-going" policy on North 
Korea, which has been implemented for the past one year. 
Stressing that the security issue is the greatest national 
issue, which will go into "bankruptcy" even by "one error," the 
paper urges the government to have "a sense of shame" for the 
recent "blow" dealt by North Korea. Describing the current 
events as a "grave situation," the editorial criticizes the Kim 
Yong-sam government's appointment of "gentlemen," who lack the 
sense of reality and "practical experience," to the posts of 
handling the North Korean issues and of dealing with North 
Korea's strategy of "hiding a bayonet behind a smile." 
Assessing the "security-related ministers' conference" as a 
meeting of those who failed in working out proper measures 
against North Korea by using up all "cards," the paper strongly 
urges that the government should present "appropriate measures" 
instead of "prescriptions" made out after the patient has died. 
  The moderate daily HANGUK ILBO publishes on page 3 a 
1,300-word editorial entitled: "Full-Scale Preparations Should 
Be Made for Provocation." Noting that the people are worried 
about North Korea's provocative remarks on war, the editorial 
stresses that high-level officials in charge of diplomatic and 
security affairs should "closely examine" the reason the 
situation has "worsened." Pointing out that the "attitude" of 
the government's diplomatic, unification, and security teams 
toward the North made the people "worry," the editorial 
criticizes "the nation-first policy," "national welfare theory" 
and "incoherent" diplomacy against North Korea, which invariably 
seeks "communization" of the South. The editorial reports that 
"opposition" of deployment of Patriot missiles to U.S. Forces in 
the ROK, which was expressed by the government claiming that 
this would "incite" North Korea, and the policy of separating 
the North Korean nuclear issue from "economic cooperation," were 
the result of the government's "inconsistent" policy. Stressing 
that North Korean military power, sought even amid severe 
economic difficulties, is still "enormous," the paper introduces 
that "three mechanized corps and tanks corps and two artillery 
corps" have been deployed within 80 km from the Military 
Demarcation Line. 
  Noting it is important for the government to further 
strengthen its "security and defense posture" and for the people 
to heighten "vigilance" against North Korea, the paper urges the 
government not to assume a "wavering" attitude toward the North 
so the people will "trust" and "follow" the government. 
  The independent moderate daily MAEIL KYONGJE SINMUN 
publishes 
on page 3 a 1,100-word editorial entitled: "Where is North 
Korea Heading?" Expressing concern with the North Korean side's 
"radical remarks" on "willingness for war" made during the 
working-level contact, the editorial points out that one cannot 
understand such remarks with "common sense" and that the North 
Korean authorities are likely attempting to "gain time" for 
nuclear development. Stressing that "strong countermeasures" are 
the only solution to the problem, the paper calls on the 
government to strengthen diplomatic efforts to maintain an 
"international cooperative system" in the course of dealing with 
the North Korean nuclear issue and to prevent the situation from 
advancing to an "extreme phase." The editorial maintains that a 
"tight defensive system" should be established to cope with the 
"reckless challenge" by North Korea. 
  The pro-government daily SEOUL SINMUN publishes on page 3 a 
2,300-word editorial, under the headline, "We Should Resolutely 
Respond to Threat on `Sea of Fire'." Saying that an "extremely 
serious situation" has developed following the North Korean 
delegate's remarks at the North-South contact, the editorial 
urges a reexamination of our own "internal posture" to cope with 
this situation. Assessing the purpose of North Korea's 
expression of a willingness for war as part of its "negotiation 
strategy" to strengthen its own system of rule, to provoke our 
"sense of anxiety" and create confusion within our society, and 
to "alienate" the ROK, Japan, and the United States in 
"international arena," the paper observes that the North's 
actions might have been prompted by our own "weak points" such 
as the slackening of security since the inauguration of the 
civilian government. Urging the government to reexamine the 
nation's overall security posture, the editorial particularly 
urges leading figures in society to encourage the people to 
"establish" a new outlook on the nation's security. Stressing 
that war can be prevented only by "advance preparations," the 
paper calls for strengthening internal unity to cope against any 
provocation. 
  The moderate KYONGHYANG SINMUN publishes on page 3 a 
1,200-word editorial entitled, "We Are Concerned With the 
Nation's Security." Noting that, regardless of North or South, 
all will be reduced to ashes if a war breaks out on the Korean 
peninsula, the editorial expresses "shock" at the North Korean 
delegate's remarks on Seoul becoming "a sea of fire," and points 
out that North Korea cannot evade the international community's 
"spearhead of attack." The paper, however, asks whether we are 
"willing and capable" of coping with such "unpredictable acts" 
of North Korea and whether we have enough arms to do so. The 
paper criticizes our diplomatic team as "too weak" to dissipate 
the uneasiness of the people, and as being "naive" and lacking 
in clear, firm principles. 
  The left-leaning HANGYORE SINMUN publishes on page 3 a 
1,300-word editorial under the headline, "Catastrophe in 
North-South Dialogue Should Be Avoided." Noting that hasty and 
narrow-minded people are worried about the possibility of war, 
the editorial writes that the South's "acute reaction" to the 
North's "bombshell declaration" on a readiness to answer 
dialogue for dialogue and war with war was responsible for the 
rupture in North-South talks. The paper then points out that 
the nation's "future" was now more likely to being a target of 
"bargaining" between big powers. 
  Opposing an "extreme attitude" against the North Korea as 
ineffective due to the likelihood of North Korea further 
aggravating military tension in order to appease a public 
sentiment that will arise following economic sanctions. The 
paper implores the North and the South to agree to a 
working-level contact over the telephone as soon as possible and 
to resolve this problem through dialogue and discussion, as they 
would a "matrimonial quarrel."

    [Editorial Report] Press articles written last year by 
members of South Korea's military and civilian S&amp;T 
establishments call for a "coordinated program" to develop 
"dual-use" technologies that can be used to manufacture highly 
advanced weapons "if the need arises." Although unequivocal 
evidence that such a policy is being adopted has not been 
observed in Seoul media reporting, articles on several new 
technologies and equipment types that qualify as "dual-use" by 
standard criteria have appeared over the past few months in ROK 
and Japanese publications. Seoul press sources note that any 
efforts by the ROK to acquire advanced weapons components or 
technology would be enhanced by S&amp;T agreements recently 
concluded with Russia, China, and Israel. 
<H5>  Dual-Use Technology for an `Uncertain' Future </H5>
  In the past year, several articles have appeared in the ROK 
press urging the government to support "dual-use" technology as 
a hedge against an uncertain future. For example, the December 
1992 issue of Seoul KUKBANG KWA KISUL argued that changes in the 
world's geopolitical relationships have made it impossible for 
South Korea to defend itself by relying on foreign equipment and 
technology. Not only are traditional suppliers reluctant to 
transfer technology, the defense requirements themselves are 
changing, forcing South Korea to "consider medium and long-term 
plans to secure the military power to deal with countries on the 
periphery through S&amp;T development for national defense and 
qualitatively superior weapons systems." The journal claimed 
that the key to both problems lies in "strengthening the bonds" 
between government and the defense industry, and for South Korea 
to use its own technology to develop "sophisticated independent 
weapons systems." 
  The same journal in its May 1993 issue featured an artic1e 
by 
a nuclear engineer from South Korea's Agency for Defense 
Development (ADD) on the need to apply nuclear technology to 
national defense. The article maintained that the distinction 
between civilian and military use of nuclear technology is not 
clear, and that products with defense applications can be 
"derived" by making improvements in how the ROK uses nuclear 
power. KUKBANG KWA KISUL highlighted the ADD engineer's remark 
that "we must vigorously invest right now in research and 
development of the nuclear power industry, so that we can make 
use of it under new conditions if the situation changes. We 
have to maintain at least a technical capability." 
  Similarly, a senior researcher at the Korea Institute of 
Science and Technology's (KIST's) Policy Management Research 
Institute wrote in the July 1993 issue of KUKBANG KWA KISUL that 
"South Korea needs to establish a new policy that can achieve 
the two national goals of economic development and national 
security." What is needed, according to the KIST researcher, is 
a "coordinated program" to develop "dual-use technology" with 
both civilian and military applications, that will enable South 
Korea to "deal with changes as the need arises." The 4 August 
1993 CHUGAN MAEGYONG made the same basic plea for "dual 
technologies," developed through coordination between the ROK's 
Defense Ministry, the Ministry of Trade, Industry, and Energy 
(MOTIE), and the Ministry of Science and Technology (MOST). In 
the 30 August 1993 MAEIL KYONGJE SINMUN (MKS), the head of the 
Korea Advanced Institute of Science and Technology (KAIST), 
which was directly responsible for two of the dual-use projects 
listed below, wrote that South Korea's present task is to create 
an independent national defense based on high technology 
appropriate to the post-cold war era and developed through 
greater cooperation between the military and industrial sectors. 
<H5>  New Technology, Equipment With Potential Weapons Applications </H5>
  Recent ROK and Japanese media reports describe some 
commercial technologies developed or acquired by South Korean 
companies and government institutes, which conceivably could be 
used to design or manufacture highly advanced weapons. For some 
of these technologies, the potential military applications are 
obvious; others are more generic, with possible uses in a number 
of high-tech weapons programs. All qualify by widely accepted 
criteria as "dual-use" in the sense described above. 
  l. An "electron beam welder" developed jointly by the Korea 
Institute of Machinery and Metals (KIMM) and KoreaIon. The 
device reportedly cost 2OO million won ($25O,OOO) to develop, 
and can be used for precision welding and to join metals of 
different types (23 October 1993 MKS). 
  2. An "ion nitriding electric furnace" and 
"numerical-controlled gas cutting machinery" by the same 
institute (29 December l9?3 CHUGAN MAEGYONG). Of the 18 
dedicated institutes within MOST, KIMM's 1994 S&amp;T budget at 
$7O 
million is the third largest after the Korea Atomic Energy 
Research Institute and the Nuclear Environment Management Center 
(1 January 1994 MKS). According to KIMM's director, the 
Taedok-based institute plans to "greatly increase its testing 
and evaluation functions for advanced machinery and equipment 
and expand related activities" in 1994 (7 January 1994 MKS). 
  3. An "ultra-high precision (nanometer scale) lathe" 
developed by KAIST, also located at Taedok (29 December 1993 
CHUGAN MAEGYONG). 
  4. High-speed "image processing equipment" to observe "how 
molecules of a material undergoing a disintegrating reaction are 
spatially distributed." Developed by a team from KAIST's 
chemical research laboratory, the equipment uses a high-energy 
charge coupled device for "direct observation of the size and 
form of the disintegrating material's distribution in three 
dimensions." Only three institutions in the world reportedly 
have this equipment: Sandia Labs, and two universities in the 
United States and Japan (22 January 1994 MKS). 
  5. Manufacturing technology for instruments able to measure 
high pressure, from an (unidentified) Russian research 
institute. The item is one of several technologies reportedly 
being obtained by ROK firms through R&amp;D contracts with 
Russia, 
according to the 11 September 1993 HANGUK KYONGJE SINMUN (HKS). 
  6. A high-energy capacitor able to withstand severe shock, 
extreme temperatures, and to operate in a vacuum, developed by 
Daewoo (9 June 1993 CHUGAN MAEGYONG). 
  7. Technology for a "solid fuel rocket engine" able to lift 
a 5O-7O kg payload to an altitude of 80-9O km, by the Korea 
Aerospace Research Institute (KARl). Projected performance 
doubles that achieved by South Korea's indigenous KSR-42O's 
rockets launched in 1993, and gives the ROK the ability to 
develop a "rocket booster that meets South Korea's particular 
needs" (29 December 1993 CHUGAN MAEGYONG). 
  8. A "small gas turbine" to be developed by Korea Air for 
commercial use in generating electricity and as a prototype to 
develop related technology "for such things as aircraft engines" 
(5 January 1994 MKS). KIMM's director also stated, without 
mentioning the Korea Air project, that his institute would 
"indigenize" a "small gas turbine engine" (7 January 1994 MKS). 
  9. An "inertial navigation system" (INS) by Korea Air. The 
company plans to acquire aviation electronics technology through 
a buyout of Litton Korea, "a firm which specializes in INS 
equipment" (5 January 1994 MKS). 
  1O. A pilotless helicopter used to spread seeds and 
agricultural 
chemicals, being developed by Daewoo Heavy Industries in 
cooperation with Russian scientists (April 1993 SIN TONGA, 5 
April 1993 CHOSON ILBO). 
  11. A "Cray model C916 supercomputer," reportedly the 
company's most powerful, for KIST's Systems Engineering Research 
Institute. The computer reportedly will be used for "structural 
analysis and fluid mechanics simulations, weather forecasting, 
and researching environmental problems" (3O June 1993 Tokyo 
NIKKEI SANGYO). 
  l2. A "computer software research center" established in 
Moscow by Samsung Electronics. Samsung, a major defense 
contractor, hopes to take advantage of the "large number of 
high-level military software development technicians who were 
trained in the former Soviet Union," and plans to become 
involved in joint projects with Russian Government research 
agencies (29 November 1993 Tokyo NIKKEI SANGYO). 
<H5>  Foreign S&amp;T Agreements Conducive to Weapons Technology </H5>
Transfer 
  South Korean efforts to acquire dual-use technologies 
presumably would be enhanced by S&amp;T agreements recently 
signed 
with three major arms and arms technology exporting countries -- 
Russia, China, and Israel -- a fact duly noted in the ROK press. 
Russia in particular has attracted South Korean media attention 
by its reported offers to barter advanced weapons (24 January 
1994 CHUNGANG ILBO) and "enriched uranium" (25 January 1994 
YONHAP) to repay its ROK debts. Infrastructure is already in 
place for acquiring other types of sophisticated Russian 
technology. In addition to various "S&amp;T cooperative centers" 
and "industrial cooperation information centers" established in 
Russia during the past year, the ROK Government operates at 
least two organizations aimed at recruiting Russian scientists 
and transferring advanced technology, through MOST (l3 October 
1993 HKS) and MOTIE (9 November 1993 MKS). 
  Arrangements to acquire Russian aerospace technology have 
been concluded by South Korea's three largest defense 
contractors, Daewoo Heavy Industries (8 January 1993 MKS), 
Samsung Aerospace (1 August 1993 HKS), and Hyundai -- which 
reportedly sent some 30 PhD's to Russia to study "satellite 
technology' (31 July 1993 HKS), and has a joint venture with the 
aerospace firm Yakolev (5 November 1993 CHUNGANG ILBO). A 24 
December 1992 CHUGAN CHOSON report describes how an unnamed 
South Korean company was able to bribe a Russian technician to 
hand over electronics technology that could not be obtained 
through formal channels; the incident suggests another route 
through which Russian weapons technology could be transferred. 
  On 5 November 1993, YONHAP reported some details of an 
S&amp;T 
agreement signed by China and the ROK on 2O September 1993, 
including joint development of a "multipurpose satellite, 
aircraft design and testing technology, and medical lasers." 
The satellite project was interpreted by YONHAP as "paving the 
way for a Sino-Korean partnership in the defense industry." 
Citing "diplomatic sources," YONHAP also noted that 
"cooperation in nuclear energy may be not only in the reactor 
sector but could possibly develop into closer and wider 
partnership in the field." In addition, the 5 October 1993 
CHOSON ILBO reported an agreement with Israel for scientific 
cooperation on several levels. The paper observed that Israel, 
which is shifting much of its state-funded research from 
military to civilian projects, is entering the agreement partly 
out of "concern about employment for its high-level S&amp;T 
personnel in defense-related industries."

  [Text] No traces of uranium or other radioactive substances 
have been detected in the metal boxes seized at the 
Thai-Cambodian border and suspected to contain uranium. 
  Several metal boxes, each painted "uranium" in English on 
one 
side were seized by police in Aranyaprathet over a month ago. 
  They were later sent to the Office of Atomic Energy for 
Peace 
for examination. 
  In a press statement issued on Friday, the office said it 
carried out radioactive and X-ray fluorescent examinations of 
the boxes and its contents. 
  The findings showed no traces of uranium or other 
radioactive 
substances, the office added. 
  The office said it had twice before examined similar kinds 
of 
metal boxes and the results showed a low emission of 
radioactivity.

  [Text] The government plans to buy a third nuclear reactor 
for research purposes next year. Seven international companies 
are expected to bid for the construction contract of a new Bt4.5 
billion atomic centre in Nakhon Nayok province. 
  Suchat Mongkhonphantha, secretary general of the Office of 
Atomic Energy for Peace (OAEP), claimed yesterday that feedback 
to the proposal from local residents was "positive". 
  The centre, to be built on 316-rai of land in Nakhon Nayok's 
Ongkharak district, will include a five-to-10 megawatt reactor, 
a laboratory for atomic isotope production, a chemical nuclear 
laboratory, a radioactive waste management plant and other 
nuclear facilities for scientific and medical purposes, he said. 
  However, resident groups in the province told THE NATION 
they 
are concerned that the OAEP had not given them full information. 
  They were worried about possible radioactive contamination 
of 
the environment and waterways. They had also not been told 
about safety measures or how to behave in case of an accident. 
  "OAEP public relations officers only informed us how the new 
centre will be useful in terms of scientific and economic 
progress," said a resident of Ongkharak who asked not to be 
named. 
  "But as local residents here, we also need to know about the 
possible negative effects -- whether it will pose a danger to 
our health and the environment. 
  "We need more details about the transportation route of 
radioactive fuel and waste management." 
  Suchat said the OAEP office will also be relocated to the 
new 
site from its 30-year-old office on Bangkok's Wiphawadi Rangsit 
Road, about eight km from Don Muang International Airport. 
  International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) regulations 
require 
nuclear reactors to be at least 14 km away from an airport to 
diminish any danger from an aviation accident. 
  The seven firms expected to bid for the project are: Atomic 
Energy Canada Ltd, the US-based General Atomic, Technical Atom 
from France, Siemens from Germany, Invapp from Argentina, C. Zec 
from China and a Japanese consortium. 
  OAEP and the Bechtell International, a US consultancy 
company, will draft the terms of reference (ToR) for the 
project, Suchat said. Contractors will be invited to discuss 
the ToR before submitting their bids. OAEP expects to select a 
contractor by January next year. 
  Construction will start after preparation of a Safety 
Analysis Report, which will include an environmental impact 
assessment. The Nuclear Facility Regulation Centre, based in 
the OAEP office, and the National Environmental Board will 
examine the report. 
  "We expect construction and establishment of a new nuclear 
reactor and other facilities to be completed in 1998," Suchat 
said. 
  OAEP spends about Bt4 million annually purchasing 
Uranium-235 
from General Atomic for its present two-MW reactor, Suchat said. 
Waste from the plant is treated and stored at the OAEP office on 
Wiphawadi Rangsit. 
  "The solid waste is stored in 200-litre buckets after being 
treated. There are about 200 buckets' of low-level radioactive 
waste being stored here," said an OAEP's waste management 
specialist. 
  "OAEP also encourages hospitals to send their wastes to us 
for treatment. Therefore, our space is almost full. Treatment 
and storage will be moved to the new centre when it is 
completed," she said. 
  Liquid waste from the plant such as 
radioactively-contaminated water is released, after being 
treated, into the waterway in front of the OAEP office building 
before flowing into a canal in Bang Khen area. 
  She said the office monitors the water closely. 
  The new research reactor will be the third in the country. 
The first, a one-MW reactor, was given to Thailand by the 
United States under the Atoms For Peace Programme of President 
Dwight Eisenhower in 1961. The government paid Btl6 million to 
purchase the second, two-MW reactor from General Atomic in 1977. 
  Suchat said the new atomic centre will also give priority to 
staff training in preparation for the future if Thailand decides 
to build a nuclear power plant.

  [Text] The Science and Technology Association has urged the 
government to decide soon whether to build nuclear power plants 
or not, Chairman Phanot Mikasen said yesterday. 
  Phanot, who claimed that the nuclear option was safe, said 
the government should decide soon because nuclear power plants 
take 10 years to complete. 
  "We have to get prepared for so many things," he said, 
citing 
lack of expertise as an example. 
  Compared with fossil fuels, nuclear power is clean. It 
doesn't release carbon dioxide into the atmosphere. Phanot said. 
  Current resources such as lignite and water are becoming 
scarcer and consequently will become more expensive, he said. 
  "Nuclear power is the most suitable energy for Thailand," 
Phanot said. 
  With cooperation from Canadian experts, he said the 
association is studying technology regarding the disposal of 
radioactive waste. 
  The association is also coordinating with the Electricity 
Generating Authority of Thailand to train new people.

<F P=106> [Report by Mirza Sadikovic] </F>
  [Excerpt] There have been new artillery-infantry attacks on 
the defenders' lines on the Grmusko-Srbljanski plateau, Hasin 
Vrh, and the Bihac part of the front. The hundreds of howitzer, 
mortar, and tank shells that have landed on parts of the defense 
lines and the shelling of Cazin, Bihac, and the surrounding 
areas this afternoon mark the 43d day of the Serbian aggressor's 
offensives on the Bihac region. 
  Our defenders are heroically resisting the wolves from Mount 
Ozren who have again arrived on the Bihac front. The fact that 
they used chemical agents in attacks today sufficiently 
illustrates the behavior by Karadzic's terrorists. When they 
failed to break the defenders' resistance, they turned against 
city districts. Substantial material damage was caused in Cazin. 
Some civilians were wounded, but fortunately no one was killed. 
  In addition, the rage by Abdic's paramilitary has continued 
in the border areas of the Cazin municipality. The targets of 
secessionists' attacks are the same ones they have been 
mercilessly destroying and torching since last night. They are 
also killing domestic animals and expelling people. A large 
number of refugees from these areas, especially from Krivaja, 
Liskovac, and (?Trzac), arrived in Cazin today. [passage omitted]

  [Text] Hiroshima, Nagasaki, and Chernobyl enriched the 
world by the knowledge of the appearance of nuclear death. The 
beginning of the nuclear age was announced by an act of war in 
the war that the United States neither began nor provoked. It 
took place at the time when the consequences were not known. 
The Chernobyl accident took place at the time when the 
consequences were known. Nevertheless, our subservient state 
leadership did practically nothing to protect the society 
against the aftermath of this accident. The crime of public 
endangerment, which then took place, has not been punished. 
  A journalist must not swallow any bait, nor can he miss any 
alarming news. The rumors about SS-20 missiles "forgotten" by 
the occupational power [on Czech territory] are among the things 
that simply cannot be missed. That is true despite the fact 
that one must know how to use a flare, or a warhead, and an 
explosion accidentally triggered by a layman is less likely than 
by an incompetent manipulation with a hand grenade. 
  The situation was worse when unverifiable rumors referred to 
a warhead with a chemical warfare agent. It was just the more 
"poignant" as both the Soviets and Czechoslovakia once promised 
that they would not keep such warfare agents. 
  Moreover, the treaties in which the USSR and former 
Czechoslovakia vouch that they will not use bacteriological or 
virological weapons would make a respectable library. It is not 
only that they promised not to use the weapons -- they actually 
promised not to have them. 
  Of course, some disease cultures, bacteria, and viruses are 
stored and cultivated for scientific reasons, even in the 
civilian sector. There are, however, long series of treaties 
and agreements that specify where and how. Under no 
circumstances, however, at a single location or even a single 
country. If they have, for instance, smallpox in Stockholm, 
then they do not have typhoid, which in turn is, let us say, in 
Milan. These treaties and agreements are also binding for the 
Czech Republic. 
  Nevertheless, the cultures, and in a form ready for combat 
use, have been and are here. In our army, completing its 
transformation and under the leadership of a Christian minister, 
who should know something about it? Our top brass, as is well 
known, are founding businesses, consortia, etc. You will find a 
small civilian business under the name of Klinlab also in the 
Central Military Hospital building. Similar cultures were 
brought there from Techonin in eastern Bohemia, where they were 
cultivated for the Warsaw Pact. They are stored in the Central 
Military Hospital contrary to all the aforementioned 
documentation. It is simply a commonplace company, equipped, 
however, at the expense of the Army, i.e. at the expense of the 
ordinary taxpayer. All this with the knowledge of the reformed 
General Nekvasil. Even his economic deputy, Kalousek, knew 
about it, for he approved the purchase of the equipment for the 
Klinlab company, which was certainly not cheap. 
  As we have managed to ascertain, the serum banks stored in 
the Military Hospital building contain gel ready for immediate 
use. Hence, a catastrophe can be set off by trickling out small 
pox, bubonic plague, or psitacosis etc., in the subway for 
instance. 
  An unintentional release could threaten Prague with, at 
least, the fate of Sverdlovsk (it is now called Ekaterinburg 
again), where a bacteriological warfare agent was released into 
the ventilation system of the local "pharmaceuticals factory" 
and, subsequently, mysterious epidemics broke out in the city. 
An unknown epidemic pneumonia was the most common cause of 
death. 
  In the Czech Army, the bacteriological and virological death 
received the mark PTZD [prisne tajne, zvlastni dulezitost] -- 
top secret, privileged information. The Central Military 
Hospital in Prague, in the building of which the Klinlab is 
located, is a military zone, where the police has no business. 
At the same time, it is also accessible to hospital visitors on 
the weekends, and, of course, to outpatients. This means that 
it is generally accessible. The building itself can even be 
accessed underground. 
  The building has been visited occasionally by a certain 
Colonel Zaykov and Mr. Frolov. Colonel Zaykov used to be a KGB 
attache, while Mr. Frolov was an adviser at the Foreign Trade 
Ministry. Currently, they both hold valid cards for foreigners 
with permanent residence here, and engage in business. How 
about selling these cultures to, let us say, Libya. Let us hope 
that the appropriate authorities will deal with this case in all 
seriousness.

<F P=106> ["(lek)"-signed report: "The Military Institute Did Not </F>
Develop Biological Weapons, Says Propper"] 
  [Text] Hradec Kralove -- The former Military Research 
Institute in Techonin in the Orlicke Mountains (now the J.E. 
Purkyne Military Medical Academy Institute of Immunology and 
Microbiology) did not develop in the past --nor is it doing so 
at present -- bacteriological weapons. This statement was made 
yesterday by Petr Propper, the institute's former director. 
"The institute dealt exclusively with defense-related 
research," he said. 
  Propper described as false the claim in CESKY DENIK that 
dangerous strains of bacteria and viruses, in whose development 
the Techonin-based research institute was involved, are stored 
in various locations in the Czech Republic. 
  According to Josef Fusek, the rector of the Military Medical 
Academy in Hradec Kralove, no bacterial or viral strains with 
transmuted immunological properties were ever developed at the 
institute. Fusek also denied that cholera, plague, smallpox, 
meningitis, or psittacosis germs would have been stored in the 
institute's laboratory. According to him, the research 
concerned other infectious diseases, for example, tularaemia. 
  A commission of experts visited the Techonin institute last 
week -- on the order of Defense Minister Antonin Baudys -- where 
they carried out an inspection and destroyed the cultures that 
will no longer be used for current research, said Fusek. 
  According to staff from the Charles University Faculty of 
Medicine Institute of Microbiology, strains of all the existing 
bacteria and viruses -- including cholera, plague, smallpox, and 
other diseases -- are stored in a number of microbiological 
laboratories. The way they store and dispose of them is, of 
course, subject to the regulations of the World Health 
Organization, which rules out any threat to the population. 
  The Defense Ministry will not, according to its Press 
Department, respond to the report in CESKY DENIK.

<F P=106> [Jan Benes and Lubor Kohout report: "The Viral and Bacterial </F>
Strains Stored in the Central Military Hospital Are Destroyed 
Posthaste"] 
  [Text] In the CESKY DENIK on Thursday and Friday [17 and 18 
March], we have reported the existence of still-maintained 
bacterial and viral strains developed for use as biological 
weapons. According to the findings by the CESKY DENIK 
reporters, one of the banks of these strains was concealed in 
the Central Military Hospital in Prague-Stresovice. 
  Yesterday, Czech Defense Minister Antonin Baudys called an 
extraordinary news conference; as he phrased it, "just to calm 
down the public." 
  Antonin Baudys declared that he was first informed about the 
existence of the particularly dangerous viruses and bacteria on 
13 February of this year. Subsequently, he received more 
information from various sources on 17 February. On the basis of 
this information, an interdepartmental commission was formed, in 
which Health Ministry experts were also represented. The 
commission, according to Baudys, investigated and assessed the 
situation, and also decided to liquidate the biological bank 
quickly because it was "no longer useful." The bacterial and 
viral cultures were also destroyed under extraordinary security 
measures between 24 and 25 February with the knowledge and 
instructions of Defense Minister Antonin Baudys and Army Chief 
of Staff Nekvasil. Furthermore, Baudys said that similar 
measures were also taken in the Techonin Military Research 
Institute at the beginning of March. It was precisely in this 
Institute that, according to the CESKY DENIK sources, biological 
weapons for the Warsaw Pact were developed. According to claims 
by the military representatives, however, this bank of 
biological cultures was a commonplace affair, and their 
maintenance did not violate any international treaties. 
  An employee of the Techonin Military Research Institute, 
Ales 
Macela, stated that in the facility where he works, no viral or 
bacterial strains have been cultivated for use in biological 
warfare. Moreover, he claimed that all documentation about the 
research has remained in Techonin. According to him, the 
research was conducted for defense purposes only. According to 
CESKY DENIK sources, however, the documentation was transferred 
to Prague under extraordinary security measures at the beginning 
of March. 
  Deputy Defense Minister Kalousek said that the Klinlab 
company had leased nonresidential premises in the Central 
Military Hospital building. It was precisely in the 
laboratories operated by this company that the bank of viral and 
bacterial cultures that were quickly destroyed on 25 February 
was stored.

<F P=106> [Lubor Kohout commentary: "From Baudys' Realm of Fantasy"] </F>
  [Text] Fairy tales are meant for children; of course, some 
adults like them too. Especially the old, traditional ones. 
The appeal of modern fairy tales is not so strong. Defense 
Minister Antonin Baudys, with the support of his subordinates, 
told us one like this last Friday [18 March]. The minister 
deemed it necessary to respond to the articles published in 
CESKY DENIK. They claimed that strains of bacteria and viruses 
intended for use as the basis for biological weapons are being 
stored (or concealed) in our military facilities. 
  If we summarize the statements made by the ministerial and 
army top brass, this is what we get: Bacteriological and 
virological weapons were never developed in our secret military 
facilities, and not at all for the purposes of the Warsaw Pact. 
The institute in Techonin never took part in such activity; the 
scientists in its laboratories only worked on immunological 
research. According to Ales Macela, the current vice president 
of the Military Medical Academy and a leading research worker at 
the Techonin institute, there were no technical conditions in 
his institute for achieving genetic changes in individual 
strains. The two batches of strains of bacteria and viruses -- 
the one in Techonin and the one that was kept in the building 
leased to the Klinlab (Clinical Laboratories) limited company in 
the Central Military Hospital in Stresovice -- were simply 
harmless batches prepared in case the state was involved in a 
defense emergency. Moreover, 80 percent of them were common 
viruses and a mere 20 percent were exotic viruses. Summa 
summarum: By storing the aforementioned strains, the army in no 
way violated the international convention on prohibiting the 
use, development, and accumulation of biological weapons. The 
interdepartmental commission, whose establishment was initiated 
by Baudys, decided that it was no longer necessary to keep the 
strains and, therefore, the viral banks were destroyed. 
Absolutely nothing happened -- irresponsible journalists from 
CESKY DENIK just want to injure our army. 
  In considering whether it is CESKY DENIK or the gentlemen 
from the Defense Ministry and the army who are telling fairy 
tales, it is enough to recall some of the facts confirmed by 
Minister Baudys himself and Chief of the General Staff Nekvasil: 
On 13 February, in connection with the personnel changes in the 
military health service department, Baudys finds out for the 
first time about the existence of batches of strains. An 
investigation follows, and on 17 February an interdepartmental 
commission is set up on Baudys' initiative. The swift 
destruction of the first batch in Stresovice begins during the 
next seven days. The defense minister personally orders the 
destruction. The chief of the General Staff also gives his 
personal guarantee that the destruction was carried out safely 
and that there was no risk. On 9 March the ministerial and army 
top brass receive the news that there is another batch of 
strains in Techonin in East Bohemia. Another swift destruction 
follows. 
  Other facts, not mentioned by Baudys, speak plainly. The 
whole affair has been investigated since the beginning by 
officers from Military Defense Intelligence (VOZ), who were 
present at the destruction along with the Military Police. VOZ 
is also taking care of the Techonin research documentation; of 
course, on Friday Ales Macela claimed that it is still stored in 
Techonin. The Defense Ministry is handing over part of the case 
to the Security and Information Service. What on earth for? 
After all, only allegedly "common and no longer necessary" 
strains were destroyed! 
  There were several ways Minister Baudys could have acted 
before Friday. One of these was telling the truth. He could 
have said that genetically altered viruses and bacteria 
developed for use as biological weapons had been concealed 
without his knowledge. He could have admitted that they are 
still -- in all probability -- "stored" in other, so far 
unknown, places. He chose another course of action, and thus 
associated himself with the people who had developed and 
concealed these materials. Parliamentary Foreign Affairs 
Committee Chairman Jiri Payne declared yesterday that the whole 
incident has to be thoroughly investigated. It only remains for 
me to add that, if CESKY DENIK has not reported the truth, the 
authors of the articles are, according to the law, criminally 
liable. They could, for example, have committed the crime of 
spreading alarming reports. If the defense minister is familiar 
with the criminal law, then he knows that he is required to 
submit a complaint. He will probably not do so, however, and he 
knows why. The ministerial fairy tales would not be enough to 
obtain a conviction in a law-governed state.

<F P=106> [Jan Benes commentary: "About Deputy Minister Kalousek's </F>
`Expedient Lie'"] 
  [Text] In the course of an extraordinary news conference 
called by the defense minister to calm down the public, Deputy 
Defense Minister Kalousek described the CESKY DENIK information 
about contributing to Klinlab equipment with Army supplies as an 
expedient lie. The deputy minister is apparently well-versed in 
the field so he knew what he was talking about. What he said 
was an expedient untruth. 
  This time around, we will not devote our attention to the 
problem of biological warfare agents (for, at this time, the 
explanation of the difference between an offensive and defensive 
cholera is beyond our ability). 
  We will leave that for some other time, including the 
military laboratories in Olesnice, as well as the equipment for 
the reproduction of viruses, with which the Techonin Research 
Institute was equipped despite the claims made by the Defense 
Ministry officials calming down the public. After all, it was 
from here that the Bulgarian, Romanian, GDR, and Russian experts 
-- who used to work here -- withdrew their research and 
documentation. 
  So, that is one group of expedient untruths. Let us, 
however, devote ourselves to the Klinlab Co., a company that 
operates in the building of the Military Hospital in 
[Prague-]Stresovice. It was precisely in the facility leased to 
Klinlab that the bank of "completely common viruses" was located 
that was destroyed on Defense Minister Baudys' order under 
extraordinary security measures. 
  First, already in 1992, expensive foreign-made equipment was 
bought for the Central Military Health Institution -- a 
laboratory glass washer, for instance, or an automatic analyzer 
-- just to guarantee a good future for the Central Military 
Hospital [UVN]. The purchases were made by the deputy chief of 
the Central Military Health Institution (UVZU), Dr. Moravek. 
The justification was that the UVZU would produce and market 
hygienically pure water for commercial purposes. Shortly 
thereafter, however, a questionnaire was circulated among the 
employees of this institution recruiting "experts" for the 
future private laboratory institute called Klinlab. The 
questionnaire was then used to justify (the people want it) the 
establishment of Klinlab. This company assumed, however, only 
the profit-making or profit promising part of the UVZU. Under 
the auspices of Economics Deputy Minister Kalousek, the company 
was authorized to manage the six-floor facility in the UVN by a 
contract dated 10 September 1993 and signed with the Army for 
Klinlab by no one else but Dr. Moravek, still an officer on 
active duty. He signed as the executive secretary of a company 
that had not yet been founded, much less registered. 
  This violates a good number of laws and regulations -- 
including the defense minister's order No. 9 of 11 February 1993. 
  Only a month after the signing of the lease (which leaves 
the 
owner with the obligations of the owner, including construction 
alterations), on 11 October 1993, the Klinlab company contract 
was signed, and only on 23 October 1993 is Klinlab entered on 
the company register. 
  In a state governed by rule of law, the contract would 
certainly be invalid. In a state governed by rule of law, the 
people signing such contracts would be considered cheats. 
Furthermore, Dr. Moravek and all the other officers from the 
Klinlab Ltd. who signed the contract brazenly violated Law 
143/1992 in its Article 3, Section 4 of the government 
instruction, according to which they are paid their salary with 
a 25 percent bonus provided they do not engage in business but 
only serve in the Army! 
  The Klinlab lease contract (let us assume that the same 
ministerial office is responsible for its organization, which 
refused other privatization projects, including one from Canada) 
rents the relevant part of the UVN for 720,123 korunas annually 
to the, of course, not yet existing legal entity, and the money 
was then lent to them interest-free for a fixed term, i.e., 
until the purchase contract is signed. All that happens on 1 
December 1993. Material and supplies worth dozens of millions is 
passed onto Klinlab without inventory, and when an inventory is 
taken of the furniture and equipment, it is calculated at 
write-off prices. Regarding the laboratory equipment valued at 
approximately 30 million korunas, then, Klinlab chooses what it 
needs and purchases (until the date of the purchase contract it 
will use it free of charge) the equipment at a later date. 
  So, this is the expedient lie about Engineer Kalousek of 
which we are guilty. 
  The military equipment that was profitable for the Army, 
including the equipment purchased for taxpayer's money, will 
pass into private hands. The money-losing equipment will be 
kept by the Army. 
  Of course, some soldiers wanted to object. That was an ill- 
advised idea. After all, the appropriate commission 
investigated it. Even Colonel Krizenecky put his iron in the 
fire, and so did Military Prosecutor Dr. Novak. The same one 
who was investigating but never concluded the investigation of 
the activities of another man of the Kalousek-type at the 
Defense Ministry, the current director of the Nase Vojsko [Our 
Army] publishing house, Jakub Cisar -- of course, that was still 
in the Orbis publishing house. 
  We will reach the stage of socialism in our country, we will 
be successful in defending the peace, and we will thwart the 
iniquitous activities of traitors, and so on along the arduous 
path towards a better tomorrow. The officers will get paid (by 
us, friends) for not engaging in business. They conduct 
business (with our money). Are we to believe that the sale of 
microbes, eventually to be thrown into a synagogue as an 
example, presents a problem for such enterprising entrepreneurs?

<F P=106> [Article by Mario Chimanovitch] </F>
  [Text] The use of nuclear energy is by its nature a 
controversial issue. It becomes still more controversial when 
the discussion is about whether the government or the private 
sector should be in charge of nuclear activities. A document 
drafted by the Strategic Affairs Secretariat (SAE), to which 
this magazine had access, has added fuel to the atomic bonfire. 
SAE Memo No. 109, dated 11 February and signed by SAE head 
Admiral Mario Cesar Flores, favors the privatization of certain 
stages of the nuclear process and opposes the position 
traditionally defended by the Brazilian military of maintaining 
absolute government monopoly over the field. The document, which 
was handed to the SAE under secretary for plans and programs, 
was drafted to guide governmental action in the constitutional 
revision. It states: "There is no reason why private 
concessionaires should not be in charge of mining work, 
concentrates manufacturing, trade, and many other related 
activities. The same applies to electrical energy production." 
  Adm. Flores believes that one of the activities that could 
be 
performed by the private sector is nuclear fuel production. In 
his opinion, the government should only control the most 
sensitive sectors such as uranium enrichment. Private companies 
could, for example, participate in uranium mining or import 
certain components for the final fuel. He points out, however, 
that the National Nuclear Energy Commission [CNEN], i.e. the 
government, must preserve "its regulatory, supervisory, and 
licensing" role. He also suggests that the civilian sector 
should accompany nuclear activities through the establishment -- 
by the national Congress -- of a joint committee. This 
suggestion is in accordance with another bill proposed by Flores 
to reorganize the intelligence service, which also would be 
closely followed by a joint committee established by Congress. 
  Several countries such as the United States and France have 
adopted the policy of partially privatizing nuclear projects. 
Nonetheless, many still criticize Flores' proposal. Professor 
Bernardino Pontes, who acted as surveyor of the 
Vienna-headquartered International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) 
for 12 years, said: "The so-called nuclear fuel cycle must 
remain in Brazilian hands to protect it from international 
oligopolies." Pontes agrees nonetheless that private enterprises 
can be more effective in mining. He insists, however, that they 
should work under CNEN control "because there is a great deal of 
international greed now that Brazil is beginning to stand out in 
the extremely select club of countries that have nuclear 
technology." 
  In the opinion of Everton Carvalho, vice president of the 
Brazilian Nuclear Energy Association (Aben), Flores' proposal 
makes Brazil vulnerable. "The most serious thing is that the end 
of the monopoly would make it easy for foreign groups to 
accurately design a chart of our reserves," he said. It is 
believed that Brazilian uranium reserves total 280,000 metric 
tons. 
  Former CNEN President Rex Nazareth, who is a colonel and an 
engineer, believes the private sector's resources might 
contribute to reducing Brazilian backwardness in the nuclear 
field. 
  Another expert, Brigadier Sergio Xavier Ferolla -- who has 
been director of the Sao Jose dos Campos Aerospace Technical 
Center and is now commander of the Superior War College -- 
believes the government should give up only its monopoly over 
uranium exploitation. He includes the nuclear field among those 
that have "a highly strategic role and should therefore remain 
under government control on behalf of Brazilian sovereignty and 
society's interests." 
  In the eye of the storm, Adm. Flores remains calm and 
asserts 
that most of the controversy results from a "misunderstanding." 
Be as it may, the situation will become hotter this year because 
Brazil's strategic interests in the nuclear field will be 
analyzed by the Superior War College. This makes us forecast a 
new -- and more serious -- confrontation among those who defend 
and those who oppose absolute governmental monopoly over the 
nuclear field.

  [Excerpt] Leaders of the Employees and Workers Union of the 
National Directorate for Civilian Aviation (SEODINAC) have 
expressed concern because no attention has yet been given to 
several reports of irregularities submitted to the 
Administrative Council of the DINAC [National Directorate for 
Civilian Aviation]. 
  The union said: "We are facing a worrisome situation over 
the 
entry of 104 kg of radioactive material under the UN Development 
Program through the Silvio Pettirossi International Airport." 
  The union added that the situation is worse because the 
highly dangerous cargo left the airport jurisdiction under a 
regulation called "cargo to be regularized" which can be 
considered legalized smuggling. 
  The union commented that approximately 18 months ago two 
small cans of radioactive material were found at the airport. 
The case was made public but nobody knew anything about how 
they appeared. 
  The union stated: "Documents now in our possession open the 
way to a thorough investigation that could expose a new face in 
the trafficking of prohibited merchandise through our airport." 
  The union believes several people are responsible for the 
entry of nuclear material into the country: One is Colonel Ramon 
Dardo Guerra, head of the DINAC: Another is Colonel Americo 
Osorio, airport director, who authorized the delivery without 
even the payment of the airport duties, and Victor Arevalo as 
the professional who mediated in this shipment. The air cargo 
ramp chief is also believed to be involved. [passage omitted]

<F P=106> [Editorial: "Prime Minister's Firm Stand"] </F>
  [Text] If U.S. Senator Larry Pressler is quoting Indian 
Prime Minister Narasimha Rao correctly and if the prime minister 
is not refuting his claims, then Rao's assertions on defense 
policy can be described as the most important statement of his 
term -- the most important because the statement is directly 
related to India's nuclear policy. Since the prime minister has 
explained his viewpoint to Pressler and spoken on the 
controversy currently raging in the United States on the 
Pressler Amendment, there can be no other meaning to his alleged 
statement. After assuming the reins of power, the Clinton 
administration has tilted so much toward Pakistan that the 
President -- restless to resume military aid to Pakistan -- 
considers the Pressler Amendment as a thorn in his way. The 
amendment provides that Pakistan will not be eligible to receive 
U.S. military aid unless and until the U.S. President certifies 
that Islamabad is not pursuing its program to manufacture an 
atom bomb. It was on this very ground that the former President 
George Bush had stopped military aid to Pakistan. It will now 
be difficult for Clinton to certify, contrary to his 
predecessor's decision, that Pakistan is not pursuing a nuclear 
bomb program. In the meantime, contrary to the above, many 
facts have come to light that dispel any doubts about Pakistan's 
ability and intention to manufacture a nuclear bomb. Meanwhile, 
the Lockheed company is increasing pressure on President Clinton 
to allow the supply of F-16 aircraft to Pakistan. This proves 
that, after failing in its bid to repeal the Pressler Amendment, 
the Clinton administration has now thought of formulating the 
policy of a one-time waiver of the Pressler Amendment to allow 
the supply of F-16 planes to Pakistan and later making the 
amendment operative again. 
  I is apparent that with the help of this policy, a sheer 
humbuggery, the Clinton administration wants to make Pakistan 
stronger than India by getting rid of the Pressler Amendment, 
which will only result in the revival of the arms race in the 
Indian Subcontinent. The policy also tacitly encourages 
Pakistan to manufacture an atom bomb. India has thus far 
adopted the policy of not making any nuclear weapon. In spite 
of this, India has not yet signed the Nuclear Nonproliferation 
Treaty [NPT] because it thinks NPT is unfair to the nonnuclear 
states. However, if the United States chooses to patronize 
Islamabad's nuclear policy on the pretext of supplying F-16 
aircraft to Pakistan, then India will be forced to review its 
nuclear options, and this is the very meaning of Prime Minister 
Rao's alleged statement. If read in the context of our 
government's disinterestedness in Raphel's planned visit to 
India, the home minister's two warnings to the United States in 
parliament, and the successful role played by the Indian 
delegation at Geneva, one can derive the message that India's 
future attitude toward the U.S. can be firm and admonitory. 
Anything contrary will depend solely on the U.S. behavior.

<F P=106> [Commentary by Defense Analyst Udhay Bhaskar Reddy] </F>
  [Text] The report in the prestigious LOS ANGELES TIMES, 
better known as L.A. TIMES, that Pakistan has managed to build 
six to 12 Hiroshima-type bombs as part of its clandestine 
nuclear weapons program is significant for two reasons. In the 
first instance, it is not the number of bombs that Pakistan has 
stashed away in the basement that is germane. The United States 
was aware as early as in 1987 that Pakistan was embarked upon a 
determined clandestine nuclear weapons program and had accurate 
estimates about how much fissile grade material Islamabad had 
stockpiled. However, Washington preferred to pretend that it 
did not know as part of the Cold War charade. 
  What the L.A. TIMES story does is to draw attention to the 
many promises and pledges broken by Pakistan in its dealings 
with the United States over military aid to its clandestine 
nuclear weapons program. This is the first important inference, 
namely that in the past, whether it was in 1981 or 1985, the 
supply of lethal modern military gadgetry by the United States 
has not deflected Pakistan from its single-minded pursuit of a 
covert nuclear weapons program. That a respected U.S. daily is 
saying this may be reflective of the growing public 
disenchantment within the United States over proliferation 
perplexities. The second significant aspect is the inside the 
L.A. TIMES story provides into the deep divisions within the 
U.S. establishment over the Pressler Amendment and its 
interpretation. As the report points out, many senior-most 
officials in the Clinton Administration appear to be keen to 
condone Pakistan's nuclear quest under ardent advocates of 
waiving the amendment. However, there are more perceptive and 
informed voices, including that of Senator Larry Pressler, who 
are seized with the enormity of this seemingly casual one-time 
waiver. It does appear that the Clinton team is deluding itself 
that a one-time waiver of the Pressler Amendment would induce 
Pakistan to cap its nuclear weapons program and that the 
proliferation problem in the region will then be resolved. 
Nothing could be further from the truth. Whether Pakistan has 
one bomb in the basement or 12, this is a level at which the 
United States hopes it will capped. But, as the North Korean 
and Iraqi examples have shown, clandestine nuclear programs do 
not lend themselves to satisfactory external monitoring, and in 
any case this capping will not assuage India's anxieties over a 
bomb in the neighboring basement where even the elected prime 
minister is not allowed to visit the nuclear facility, let alone 
control it.

  [Text] New Delhi -- India may have little option but to 
turn towards nuclear-based deterrence if United States goes 
ahead with its proposal to supply arms to Pakistan, according to 
defence experts here. 
  India, given its precariously placed economy and an 
indulgent 
"Soviet Union" that has disappeared, is in no position to buy 
frontline fighter planes. maritime patrol aircraft, and 
state-of-the -art electronic warfare systems which Pakistan 
gets, in case the Pressler amendment is waived. 
  With the balance of power already in favour of Pakistan, 
thanks to the cutback on Indian defence spending, a fresh supply 
of 71 F-16s, three harpoon-armed P-3 maritime aircraft, radars 
and electronic warfare systems and main battle tanks will 
completely load the dice against India. 
  Arguing that to merely correct this balance, India would 
have 
to step up its defence spending to 4 per cent of the gross 
domestie product from the existing level of 2.4 per cent within 
a year, Air Commodore Jasjit Singh, director of Institute of 
Defence Studies and Analyses says, "the alternative cheaper 
option may be to move towards defence-based nuclear deterrence''. 
  As it exists now, India cannot conceivably set aside 4 per 
cent of the GDP on defence expenditure, without seriously 
jeopardising its economic reforms. 
  Even under the US arms embargo following Pressler amendment 
in 1990, Pakistan has quadrupled its combat capabilities 
procuring fighters from Australia, China. 
  The contrast between the air forces of India and Pakistan is 
striking. Since eighties when the IAF [Indian Air Force] 
inducted 45-odd Mirage in answer to Pakistan's F-16's, it has 
added on 35 Mig-27's manufactured at the HAL plant in Nasik. 
  Pakistan Air Force since 1990 has inducted 145 combat 
aircraft (50 Mirage and 95 F-7Ps from China). Another 40 F-7P's 
are due to join the force later this year. 
  From Italy, it is due to pick up 100 GRIFO sophisticated 
look-up and look-down radars mounted on the F-7P's. 
  While India drags its feet over the advanced jet trainer, 
PAF 
[Pakistan Air Force) has started to receive K-8 jet trainers and 
light tactical aircraft from China. The nuclear-capable M-11 
ballistic missile supplied by China has been deployed in the 
Pakistan air arm. 
  With the proposed supply ot 71 F-16's including 40-odd ready 
for immediate delivery, the "balance of power substantially 
swings towards Pakistan" a defence expert points out. 
  Prime Minister P. V. Narasimha Rao who has warned that he 
would review the defence policy in case the Pressler amendment 
is waived for Pakistan is understood to have asked the research 
establishment to speed up the light combat aircraft [LCA] 
project. 
  The LCA scheduled to roll out by June 1996, on paper, is the 
country's answer to the F-16. Simultaneously, IAF has been asked 
to look at ways to upgrade the sophisticated Mirage 2000 which 
was finally bought in answer to the first batch of F-16s 
obtained by Pakistan. 
  The French manufacturers of the fighter aircraft are likely 
to be asked to upgrade the avionics. 
  The implications of waiving the Pressler amendment are 
understood to have figured high in the meeting of the Indo-U.S. 
Air Force steering committee that began here on Monday. 
  The American delegation led by Lt. General John S. 
Fairfield, 
Vice Commander U.S. Pacific Air Force called on Air Chief S. K. 
Kaul. 
  "Matters of mutual interest" were discussed, a Defence 
Ministry release said. 
  IAF vice chief P. J. Jaykumar led the Indian side in the 
steering committee deliberations aimed at enhancing 
service-to-service cooperation. The first meeting of the 
committee took place in Hawaii in August 1993 . 
  The security scenario in South-East Asia is expected to be 
discussed at length in the three-day deliberations of the 
steering committee. Officers from training, maintenance, 
intelligence are taking part in the deliberations.

<F P=106> [Report on Iraqi Foreign Minister Muhammad Sa'id </F>
al-Shahhaf's Statement on Iraqi Television on 15 March 1994; 
"al-Shahhaf: Resolution 706 Contains Traps and Snares To Shackle 
Iraq and To Continue Imposing the Blockade; There Is a 
Treacherous Game in Applying the Resolution Aimed at Avoiding 
Fulfillment of Obligations"] 
  [Excerpts] Iraqi Television last night carried an interview 
with Foreign Minister Muhammad Sa'id al-Shahhaf in which he 
reviewed the provisions of the resolutions that were issued the 
UN Security Council, Iraq's positions on them, and the lack od 
any justifications for these resolutions now that Iraq has 
fulfilled its obligations. 
  The Minister remarked that this subject needs to be 
explained 
and clarified in detail in view of the conspiracies and intrigue 
that the enemies of Iraq and Arabdom have woven around it. 
[passage omitted] 
  The minister said: The key point of Resolution (687), to 
which the leader president referred in his speech, is Section 
(C). This section includes Paragraphs (7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, and 
13). Paragraph (14) is an explanation saying if Paragraphs 7-13 
are applied successfully to Iraq, it would be the beginning of 
their application to the entire Middle East to turn it into a 
zone free of weapons of mass destruction. They have not yet 
done anything on this score. 
  The minister said: Regarding Section (C), which includes the 
paragraphs I just mentioned, they said: We know that you Iraqis 
have weapons of mass destruction. These weapons exist in the 
following fields: the nuclear field, the chemical field, the 
biological field, and the delivery systems field; that is 
missiles. They also said: We have Paragraphs 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 
12, and 13 to apply and we will set up a UN Special Commission 
for that. There is also the International Agency for Atomic 
Energy, which specializes in these matters. The Special 
Commission and the agency have been instructed to work out a 
plan with you. You will tell them the weapons and missiles you 
have. Teams from the Special Commission and the agency will 
come to inspect them, and the existing arsenal will be 
destroyed. We will inspect the sites where you manufactured and 
installed the machines and plants which produce these weapons. 
We will remove parts of these machines so that they would no 
longer be able to produce chemical weapons or missiles with a 
range of more than 150 km. 
  The minister added: They wanted us to reveal all that we had 
and to destroy it. They wanted us to destroy the weapons, which 
were banned under the provisions of this resolution, and also 
the machines and factories connected with their production. 
Once these steps were taken, Iraq would have nothing left and 
would be in no position to produce anything. 
  The minister said: They said: But in order to make sure that 
you Iraqis -- and we know you are a clever and dynamic people -- 
will not go back to producing these weapons, we will set up a 
future monitoring system. They mentioned in Section (C) of 
Resolution (687) that the monitoring system would last for one 
year. 
  The minister said: Since they accepted the resolution, one 
would presume that based their acceptance on the principles of 
law, international relations, and the UN Charter, meaning, 
first, that whatever they requested under Section (C) would not 
prejudice Iraq's national sovereignty and independence, its 
ability for development, and its right to self-determination, 
which are basic for any society and country. We presumed that 
our dealing began on the basis of the provisions and principles 
I mentioned. 
  The minister added: We have been following Section (C) since 
the cease-fire in 1991. The leader president said: Tell us 
what you want so we can sit together, discuss it, and destroy 
some machines and plants to make them unserviceable. And in 
order to reassure everyone we will also set up a monitoring 
system. This has been going on since 1991. We did more than we 
promised. For the sake of precision and to prove to our people, 
I will mention some of the documents which we deposited with the 
United Nations and which are now considered documents of the 
Security Council. They asked us to begin with the nuclear field 
first, and we did. They said we want Iraq to announce its 
commitment to the Nonproliferation Treaty, we said: Fine, we 
have the following: six letters which were sent by the foreign 
minister containing Iraq's adherence to the Treaty on the 
Nonproliferation of Nuclear Weapons, 16 messages and statements 
confirming that Iraq does not possess nuclear weapons and that 
it does not produce these weapons or any substance that goes 
into their production, 62 letters containing Iraqi declarations 
on nuclear positions, and 23 nuclear teams. Then they said: 
Tell us about the components of the Iraqi nuclear program. We 
told them what we had: 547 tonnes of natural uranium [yuraniyum 
tabi'i] and 50 kgs of highly enriched fuel. They took them and 
transported them outside Iraq. We said also that we had 1,850 
kgs of a fairly enriched uranium, 6 kgs of plutonium for 
scientific research, and 6 tonnes of uranium waste. That was 
all. 
  They carried out a thorough inspection. Then, they said: We 
want to know the stages of your nuclear program. So, we told 
them that our stages are as follows: Extraction of uranium from 
ore and its transformation into uranium compounds. We have 
electromagnetics, chemicals, and central [word indistinct]. All 
this is for research. We also process fuels. This framework, 
as you can see, is very normal. We have nuclear reactors we 
bought from you. We have an electro-nuclear power project, 
plants to retrieve depleted (wasted) nuclear fuel, and a plant 
for the treatment of radioactive waste. We have scientific 
research efforts that are connected to the program. Our 
position is the same as that of any other nation or state that 
is conducting research. It is all scientific research for use 
in medicine and agriculture, as part of the development 
programs. Finally, we have agricultural and medical 
applications, to which we have already referred. Of course, we 
have a nuclear safety system, nuclear safety measures, and the 
engineering support for them. 
  The minister said: They saw and thoroughly inspected what we 
had. Talks with [UN chief inspector] Ekeus began in July 1993. 
They continued in September, October, and November of that year, 
and in New York, as well. In his capacity as the representative 
of the International Agency for Atomic Energy, he wrote -- we 
have the document because it is a now Security Council document 
-- saying: There are no more secrets in the Iraqi program. Iraq 
has approved Resolution 715 concerning permanent monitoring. We 
believe Iraq has fulfilled all its obligations. 
  The minister said: Regarding the chemical field, we followed 
the same line. We told them what we have. I will mention some 
figures, because we have them in our records and they are also 
documented with the Security Council. 
  The minister continued: Some 12 large chemical inspection 
teams came, under Paragraph 9 of Section C, to see the records, 
visit the sites, and obtain samples. We detailed our stockpile: 
10,780 pieces of missile hardware ['atad sawarikh] for 122-mm 
missiles, 1,776 shells [qanbarah], 12,634 artillery shells, 30 
al-Husayn missile warheads and 2,000 mortar shells. We said you 
can visit the sites where this hardware is produced, and the 
development laboratories, as well. They inspected them. Then 
they asked: Where are the simple materials [al-mawad 
al-basitah]? We told them that the stockpile of active 
materials [al-mawad al-'awamil] is 280 tonnes, and the simple 
materials stockpile is 75 tonnes. They asked to see the 
canisters. We told them here are 45,000 canisters for 122-mm 
missiles and 5,000 shells for 250-mm missiles, and here are the 
24,000 that were destroyed in the bombing. They were all 
destroyed in the bombing. They saw it all, including the scrap 
metal. Then, they began inspecting. Later, they said: We want 
to see the documents. 
  The minister added: We gave them the nuclear documents, 
which totaled more than 60,000 pages. Then they asked for the 
documents on chemical weapons. We told them they were destroyed 
in the bombing. Then they told us: We want you to remember 
everything and write it down on paper. Iraqi experts exerted 
great efforts and wrote down everything in order to eliminate 
any excuse. Ekeus wrote on a piece of paper: I find this to be 
satisfactory, meeting all requirements. Ekeus then heard the 
statements by the official in charge of the Iraqi and Gulf 
Section in the U.S. State Department and by the U.S. National 
Security Council adviser. He became suspicious after hearing 
these statements, although we had a signed document between us 
in which he said that what he saw was satisfactory and met all 
requirements. 
  When he heard those people speaking in this way, he decided 
that he wanted more information and that what we had given him 
was not enough. Some 12 large chemical teams came. They left 
nothing unearthed. They analyzed water and soil. They carried 
out air inspections. They were very provocative, but the Iraqis 
restrained themselves and remained very patient. The behavior 
of the others was really bad and provocative. 
  The minister said: Iraq did not have anything in the 
biological field. Actually, what we had was just scientific 
research. We did not have any secrets. The so-called 
reinforced microbes [mikrubat mujahhadah] were purchased from 
the United States for purely scientific research, not for 
biochemical weapons. Several experts came and saw them. Then 
they said: We want to see the laboratories, even in those in 
Iraqi universities. They also asked if there were any private 
sector laboratories. 
  Regarding the missiles, we told them: This is what we have. 
Here are the al-Husayn missiles. Here are the Scuds we got from 
the Russians. We gave them details. During this period, they 
brought in 21 teams, if not more, consisting of missile 
specialists. 
  The minister said: The United States continued to play the 
same tune, i.e., that Iraq hid some missiles. So, they launched 
a new search campaign. I call it a search campaign, not an 
inspection campaign. They brought in helicopters and gamma ray 
spectrometers to discover what Iraq might have hidden 
underground. They then toured the country. They stayed for 
several weeks. The American lie was exposed. 
  The minister added: Finally, they asked for the records 
about the disposal of missiles. We gave them the records. Then 
they said: We want to see if these documents are original or 
recent. They brought in a team to inspect the documents. Then 
they said: The documents are original, but we will take them to 
Europe for further inspection by more sensitive instruments, 
although we are sure they are original. We will take them to 
inspect them. We patiently said: Take them. Then we said: 
Fine, we have covered all fields under Paragraphs 7, 8, 9, 10, 
11, 12, and 13 of Section C. Nothing has been left uninspected. 
  I will now mention how far they have gone in their behavior. 
They said: We want to go to the southern marshlands, because we 
received information about possible leftover chemical weapons 
that were used there. We said: This is very ridiculous. They 
said: Still, we must go. We took them to the south. They wore 
protective suits against chemical weapons. They were flat on 
the ground while helicopters hovered over their heads. They 
located an object stuck into ground. They walked over 
cautiously, tied a rope round it, fearing it might explode. 
When they pulled it out it turned out to be used mortar shell. 
I still remember how some of them shook their heads shamefully, 
and others said: These people -- meaning the Americans -- are 
making a mockery of us. 
  The minister said: We knew right from the start that it was 
an intentional thing. This was one of hundreds, if not 
thousands, of examples that Iraqis have patiently endured since 
1991. 
  The minister added: You may not have heard some of the 
remarks made about the Ministry of Agriculture, which turned out 
to be theatrical, since they did not find any of the things they 
claimed were inside the Ministry. Actually, there was nothing 
in the Ministry. But since they had nothing to say, they wrote 
in their report: We found in one of the rooms "a scratch" on a 
wall caused by a chair. Apparently, the employee using this 
particular chair placed it against the wall, causing the 
scratch. They said in the report: We saw the chair but its 
back was not as high as the scratch. So, it was not the chair 
that caused scratch. This means the chair that made the scratch 
was replaced. They included that in the report as evidence. 
The report was referred to the UN Security Council. You know 
how tense relations were with the Security Council, which wanted 
any justification in order to deceive the world about the 
aggressive threats being made by peoples' hangmen. 
  The minister said: As you can see, I am only citing examples 
and completely avoiding any personal comment. I dealt with this 
person, Ekeus, right from the start. I recall that during our 
meeting together during his last visit here in February 1994, we 
asked him certain specific questions. I asked him: Why this 
delay? What more is asked of us? We explained what we have. 
You also know what we destroyed. I also gave you figures. 
Then they said they wanted whatever we mentioned in writing. 
They said: Actually, we saw the destroyed ammunition, and the 
picture you presented to us was clear, but please remember 
everything and put it down in writing. They wanted us to sit 
down, remember everything, and commit it to writing. We had to 
think and remember what happened in a certain month or a certain 
year, what empty shell, magazine, or simple weapon was used, and 
for what purpose. 
  The minister said: Iraqi technicians sat down and very 
patiently searched their brains so as to eliminate any excuse. 
They produced a full record for Ekeus. He was astonished by 
the results. He said: What you have written down from memory is 
sufficient and meets the purpose. We recorded it in our joint 
minutes. But the Western henchmen said it was not enough. We 
could not accept their haphazard remarks. We told Ekeus: Sit 
down. You said the record was sufficient and met the purpose. 
Therefore, this change in attitude is politically motivated in 
order to prolong the blockade of Iraq. Some Western henchmen 
say this is not enough. To be honest, most members in the 
Security Council are against the extension of the blockade on 
Iraq, because they have begun to see the irrefutable facts. But 
the Americans are known for influencing and blackmailing others, 
and Ekeus knows that. During the last meeting in February 
regarding the monitoring, Gart [name as transliterated] produced 
a chart and reminded me of Resolution 706, which provides for 
exporting oil worth $1.6 billion. The world knows only that oil 
is to be exported. But it does not know the traps and snares 
inherent in this resolution designed to shackle Iraq. All these 
traps and snares are actually intended to make us approve the 
monitoring system details. 
  The minister said: Fine, you have worked out everything. 
Ekeus said: Well, I cannot say that. I said: Fine, why don't 
you find out? You have the Special Commission and the 
experience. You have used everything, including espionage 
aircraft. And now you say you do not know anything. How can 
that be? He said: We do not have the capability. I said: 
Fine, when the Americans wanted to support Iranian claims that 
Iraq used chemical weapons in the Gulf, you made a big uproar. 
A working team was immediately dispatched to the south. Fine, 
let us talk about monitoring. Iraq and its people have been 
very patient with you since 1991. Yet, you now say that you do 
not have the capability. This is unacceptable. We ask you, in 
fact, it is our right -- or, to be more precise, it is our 
minimum right -- to work out a timetable to apply to what 
remains, if you have something new to be monitored. Practically 
speaking, the monitoring began in December 1993, it is in 
progress, and the inspection cameras have been mounted at 
missile sites and nuclear establishments. The inspection teams 
also continue to operate in the factories. They even marked 
some machines with tape, saying they must not be used. Ekeus 
came to us saying: There are machines in some factories that 
must not be used until the monitoring system has been installed. 
So, he produced some tape and stuck it on the machines, 
although they are ordinary commercial machines that the Iraqi 
could have used for months. Tape was stuck on machines, cameras 
were installed in two places, to inspect missile engines and in 
the nuclear sector. Iraqi laboratories are under inspection and 
all the monitoring measures have been taken, yet Ekeus comes and 
says: But our capabilities are limited. This is an obvious 
lie. Its purpose is to waste time and to continue the blockade 
of the Iraqi people. We told Ekeus in February: This is our 
minimum right. We have been patient with you until now. 
  The minister said: We said let us work out a timetable. He 
evaded the subject. We pressed him. We held three meetings 
that continued for hours. But he prevaricated like a fox in the 
forest, as the leader president said. He said: We must have a 
protocol, or a record, for each factory specifying the type of 
monitoring being conducted in it. We should also set up logs. 
Although this was completely unacceptable, we told him: Let it 
be, although we are not 100-percent convinced that you have the 
capability. We know what your capabilities are. We know what 
the Americans have placed at your disposal. We ask you: How 
many Iraqi engineers and experts do you want? Two hundred? 
Take 200. They will help you accomplish your work quickly, 
according to this timetable. As far as we are concerned, we 
believe monitoring began in December 1993. Ekeus said: If I 
agreed to that, they would say I was cooperating with the 
Iraqis. What a weak excuse! So, he completely avoided 
committing himself to a timetable, which is our minimum right.

  [Text] Israel is holding secret contacts with North Korea 
in a bid to prevent it from supplying Iran with long-range 
missiles. These contacts are being held against the wishes of 
the United States and contrary to Israel's promise to coordinate 
its relations with North Korea with the United States. Our 
political correspondent Udi Segal reports: 
  Several weeks ago, Israeli diplomats met with senior North 
Korean representatives in Beijing in the framework of secret 
contacts between the two countries. The contacts are designed 
to secure an agreement that would prevent North Korea from 
supplying Iran with Nodong missiles. These missiles, which have 
a range of 1,000 km, can carry chemical and nuclear warheads. 
In exchange, Israel is proposing to help raise approximately $1 
billion among American Jewish businessmen for civilian projects 
in North Korea. 
  The contacts between the two countries are mainly 
coordinated 
by the Israeli Embassy in Beijing. The secret talks are being 
held against the wishes of the United States, which is currently 
conducting a campaign against North Korea in view of the 
latter's refusal to sign the Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty. 
  The Israeli-North Korean connection started approximately 
two 
years ago. One of the main mediators is an American Jewish 
businessman whose identity is being kept secret for fear that 
the U.S. authorities will harass him. Following preliminary 
contacts, Eytan Bentzur, deputy director general of the Foreign 
Ministry, left for North Korea among a group of geologists. 
Once there, he held secret meetings with North Korean 
officials. Bentzur prepared a visit by Foreign Minister Shim'on 
Peres to North Korea, but at that point the United States 
intervened. Secretary of State Warren Christopher met with 
Peres in Vienna and protested Israel's contacts with North 
Korea. Peres promised that all future contacts would be 
coordinated with the United States. 
  A senior political source in Jerusalem said the present 
contacts between Israel and North Korea are not necessarily 
being coordinated with the United States. We are dealing here 
with an Israeli security interest, and if we do not take care of 
it, nobody else will do it for us, the source claims.

<F P=106> [Report by Syed Alamdar Raza: "Pakistan's External Security </F>
Environment"] 
  [Text] The meeting of the Defence Coordination of the 
Cabinet (DCC) was held on 10th March which, according to 
newspaper reports, discussed the latest situation obtaining in 
occupied Kashmir, attitude of different countries in respect of 
the Kashmir issue, situation of Siachin and other border needs 
of the Armed Forces specially the matter of the F-16, Pak 
American relations and matters related to the purchase of the 
Armed Forces equipment from different countries, The meeting was 
held in the context of the reports that the Indian defence 
budget had gone up by 20 percent i e from Rs [rupees] 191.8 
billion to Rs 230 billion. The ground situation also has vastly 
changed and India has now a clear 2 to 1 superiority over 
Pakistan. 
  Their state of weaponry is vastly better than that of 
Pakistan because of their huge indigenisation programme 
resulting in ready and easy replacements of the old, used up and 
outdated weaponry and spares, Pakistan's support even in respect 
of the Kashmir issue is not what it should have been i e the two 
resolutions presented before the UN General Assembly and the UN 
Human Rights Commission on human rights violations, had to be 
withdrawn and deferred. Even the purchased and paid for 
military equipment in USA has not been made available with the 
result that military initiatives has passed on to India. The 
relaxation of Sino-Indian relationship has enabled India to 
withdraw two more divisions and concentrate against Pakistan. 
The security environment has, therefore greatly deteriorated. 
  Indian writers are now confident that Pakistan is no longer 
a 
military problem in terms of conventional warfare. Ravi Rikhy in 
his book "The war that never was" has the following remark to 
make, "Trident (name of a defence exercise) called for an attack 
on 8th February 1987 at 0430 hours with Skardu as the first 
objective and Gilgit as the second. The operation was expected 
to last two weeks, within which time the Northern Areas under 
Pakistani occupation since 1947-48 would be recovered. If 
Pakistan chose to keep the conflict limited to Northern Areas, 
this was fine with India. 
  But suppose pakistan wanted to retaliate and escalate say by 
attacking Punjab, then "Brass Tacks" which was originally 
planned as a gigantic strategic deception to focus Pakistan's 
attention on Sindh while we went for Northern Areas, would have 
been converted into an actual operation with the aim of reaching 
Mixpur Khas within three days and Hyderabad City within seven". 
India has been keeping such contingency plans ready ever since 
and is in a position to launch them as and when it suited her. 
Her superiority in numbers and equipment makes it clear that 
she is quite capable of launching such operations. India may 
have wrong notions about our defence capabilities and her claim 
to run over may not be quite as easy as she imagines but what is 
quite clear is that India is now clearly in a position to take 
initiatives as and when she likes and we have only the option to 
react effectively to what India does. This possibility makes us 
highly vulnerable. 
  What has kept India away from launching such adventures is 
the fact that according to her, Pakistan has developed the 
nuclear capacity. Even here India claims 1 to 10 superiority 
over Pakistan but Pakistan's ability to launch nuclear 
retaliation according to India is such that she is capable of 
destroying New Delhi and Tarapur causing immense destruction and 
crippling India to such and extent that she would be effectively 
neutralised for years to come. The fact that Pakistan will also 
be extensively destroyed, is hardly a matter of any satisfaction 
and will hardly provide India any edge over her. What is worse 
from India's point of view is that in this respect Pakistan has 
the initiatives and can launch a nuclear retaliation at her 
will. In fact, it should be a normal expectation that if 
operations like Trident or Brass Tacks were launched and 
Pakistan was squeezed as Indians hoped she would be, she would 
resort to nuclear warfare and being a weaker nation, may be the 
first to use it out of insecurity. 
  This is a very real possibility of which the Indian Magazine 
"India Today" dated 15th February 1994, has referred to. There 
are three aspects of the nuclear problem which are causing great 
worry to India. Firstly, that Pakistan has both, the nuclear 
weapons and the delivery system. How many weapons they have is 
not to important. They may have six or more but they are 
capable of inflicting irreparable damage upon india. Secondly, 
that Pakistan has effectively safeguarded her nuclear arsenal. 
Kahuta which was vulnerable to Indian attack has been vacated. 
  The present nuclear storage facility is located at Chagai in 
Balochistan and is in a ready state for the pilots to take off 
before Indians could attempt to destroy them. Thirdly, Pakistan 
is building another 70 megawatt reactor at a secret location 
along the Indus. 
  According to Indians, by 1992 half of the construction and 
assembly work had been completed. Indian military experts 
believe that the programme when completed could yield bombs that 
would counterbalance India's vastly superior conventional force. 
  The above facts indicate that even if the Indian claims to 
their conventional military superiority are to be believed they 
fear they have been effectively neutralised by the emergences of 
Pakistan's nuclear capability, India has no effective answer to 
this new phenomenon. The fact is that whatever Indians may 
allege, the programme is peaceful but it poses a threat to India 
because they visualise it the same way as their own nuclear 
programme which they claim to be peaceful. 
  The only option open to India is roll back our entire 
programme and they are working towards that end. USA is being 
cultivated and Indians have apparently made some headway. There 
are clear indications that the programme has been frozen and as 
such a very effective weapon in the hands of Pakistan is being 
blunted due to the intervention of our erstwhile friend USA. 
This is being done in addition to a ban being put on the 
release of military weapons even where we had paid for them. 
This is a very unenviable position which makes us highly 
vulnerable and places India in a position to take initiatives 
which Pakistan may have no ability to effectively counter. As 
far as our friend USA is concerned whose policies are now 
weakening our defence capability, we cannot rely on them in 
moments of crisis and war. Our own experience leads us to that. 
  Where do we go from here? This is what DCC is apparently 
meeting to consider. How do we meet this challenge? Our 
approach should be two fold. Firstly we should tell our friends 
that our security has to be ensured. This would be in American 
interest also as we have always been their most allied ally. 
Verbal or even written undertakings as to our security will not 
be enough because they have not helped us in the past. What we 
need is that out defence capability be-built up to a point where 
we are able to defend ourselves effectively against India. 
Secondly, we have to realise that our real assets are those 
people who have helped attain the present nuclear capability. 
They have to be looked after and duly safeguarded. They 
should not be allowed to be neutralised. Their abilities should 
be utilised on research and on further development of nuclear 
potential for peace, So long as these people are there we 
cannot be betrayed even if our political leadership sucumbs to 
pressures, our nuclear experts are quite capable of giving what 
we need during the war and in moments of crisis. So let them 
work on peaceful nuclear projects. There is no reason why we 
should not follow Indian example in this respect who continue to 
claim that their programme is strictly peaceful and as innocent 
and non-violent as Buddha. Let us also continue with our 
peaceful and non-violent nuclear programme. 
  Our electricity requirements alone justify such continuation 
and in fact, further advancement of our nuclear programme. We 
should, however, make one thing clear to the rest of the world i 
e that our nuclear programme is far more peaceful and 
non-violent than the Indian programme.

<F P=106> [Report by ITAR-TASS correspondent Anatoliy Yurkin] </F>
  [Text] Moscow March 24 TASS -- "There are no toxic agents 
or wastes for a genuine chemist -- they are all raw materials," 
this precept by the great Russian chemist Dmitriy Mendeleyev was 
repeated time and again by scientists, who took the floor during 
the Duma hearings on Russia's participation in international 
agreements to scrap chemical weapons. Believing that Russia 
should derive definite benefits from the destruction of combat 
toxic agents, they moved to include in the state budget a 
separate item, envisaging spendings on disarmament and 
conversion programmes. Moreover, the scientists hold, it is 
necessary to launch a broad explanatory campaign and to discuss 
in a professional way all the problems linked with the 
destruction of weapons. 
  ITAR-TASS was told by Major-General Yuriy Tarasevich, 
assistant commander of radiation, chemical and biological 
defence forces of the Russian Federation, who took part in the 
deliberations, that a concept has already been drawn up for 
scrapping combat toxic substances, but this required special 
financing. Shortage of money for the development of special 
technologies, construction of various installations and other 
jobs, envisaged by the complex programme, retards the 
implementation of the already adopted decisions. 
  General Tarasevich believes that this year will be decisive 
for preparations to begin the planned destruction of chemical 
weapons. He denied rumours and publications on the alleged 
"incineration of chemical shells". "All the ammunition is being 
reliably guarded and poses no threat to the environment," 
Tarasevich said. He believes they could remain stored for 
several more years. "It would be wrong to shift the difficult 
job of destroying them to the next generation. There is every 
opportunity to do it now, relying on international agreements," 
Tarasevich noted.

  [Text] [150622] [Deryabin over video of interior of CW 
destruction facility] The Chapayevsk plant for the destruction 
of chemical weapons was built in secret, but when the military's 
plans became known, the oblast's inhabitants together with 
activists of the Green movement, fearing that the plant might 
give rise to emergency situations, prevented it being operated. 
  Representatives from various regions of Russia where 
arsenals 
of chemical weapons are located have just paid a visit here. 
They were acquainted with the fully automated production 
process. Specialists believe that this method of processing 
lethal substances is the best. 
  According to a statement by a Ministry of Defense spokesman, 
the lesson provided by Chapayevsk has been learned. Henceforth 
the construction of all facilities connected with the 
destruction of chemical weapons will take place with the 
participation of the local authorities. 
  It is obvious that this sort of facility is indispensable. 
After all, maintaining numerous storage facilities containing 
toxic substances is not just expensive, it is dangerous.

    [Editorial Report] Moscow Russian Television Network in 
Russian at 2020 GMT on 24 March carried a two-minute video 
report by A. Peslyak in the "Vesti" newscast on Russia's 
destruction of its chemical weapons. 
  Peslyak began by recapping Russia's international commitment 
to destroy its chemical weapons and to discontinue their 
production. Archive footage was shown of the international 
convention on the destruction of chemical weapons. 
  He then reported on the debate on this topic in the State 
Duma on 24 March. Peslyak said that the main problem was 
storage of the weapons until they could be destroyed. The video 
showed the Duma being addressed by Major General Yuriy 
Tarasevich, deputy head of the chemical defense troops of the 
Russian Federation, who said: "You must understand that we 
cannot do anything about the storage areas themselves. 
Therefore we are saying at the present time that the most 
dangerous situation has arisen in these two arsenals we have. 
That's in (Kompapino) and especially in Gornyy, Saratov Oblast." 
  Peslyak said that the Defense Ministry was asking for half a 
billion dollars to finance the destruction of the weapons. The 
video then showed an excerpt of an interview with V. Nikonov, 
deputy chairman of the State Duma Committee on International 
Affairs, identified by caption, who said: 
  "The means of eliminating the chemical weapons has yet to be 
decided upon. The sites where the destruction of the chemical 
weapons is to take place have yet to be chosen. As you can see 
from the hearing, the settling of these matters with local 
authorities and, moreover, with local inhabitants is running 
into considerable difficulties." 
  Peslyak then pointed out that a factory in Chapayevsk 
equipped with ultra-modern technology was standing idle when it 
could be used for destroying chemical weapons. Video showed the 
exterior and interior of a factory, with its machinery wrapped 
in plastic sheeting. No one was taking responsibility for this, 
he said. He also said that it was difficult to know just how 
much toxic material there was to be destroyed saying there could 
be "40,000, 80,000 or 400,000 tonnes." 
  In addition to the factory, the video showed personnel in 
protective clothing working with munitions in the open, and rows 
of charred shells. An assortment of gas masks was also shown.

<F P=106> [Article by Vladimir Yermolin: "Chemical Weapons Must Be </F>
Destroyed. But It Is an Expensive Business"] 
  [Text] The parliamentary hearings in the State Duma 
Thursday [24 March] showed how complex is the situation in 
connection with Russia's international commitments in the sphere 
of the destruction of chemical weapons (CW). Defense Ministry 
spokesman Major General Yuriy Tarasevich stressed that the 
military department expects the deputies to provide legislative 
support in such a difficult and expensive business as the 
destruction of chemical weapons. According to the military, the 
blueprint for CW destruction needs to be legislatively 
formalized. A draft blueprint will be presented to the State 
Duma in mid-April. We also need laws on CW destruction and on 
the social protection of the population in areas where these 
weapons are being destroyed. 
  Funding for all measures connected with preparations for the 
actual recovery of toxic substances and munitions is extremely 
uneven and inadequate. Getting rid of Russian chemical weapons 
will cost two trillion rubles [R] in 1993 prices. Meanwhile, 
some R10.4 billion are supposed to be allocated for this purpose 
in the current year. But we all know full well how funds are 
being allocated this year. The CW disarmament program is no 
exception. 
  There was a note of anxiety in what Maj. Gen. Yuriy 
Tarasevich said. A number of arsenals established back in the 
fifties in Udmurtia and Saratov Oblast are in need of a complete 
overhaul. In existing conditions such an overhaul is a very 
difficult and dangerous business. One would like this to be not 
an exlusively military headache. Let us hope the hearings go 
some way toward this. 
  The military-political aspects of Russia's joining the 
Convention on the Destruction of Chemical Weapons were also 
examined during the hearings. The inevitable question arose: 
Might it not happen that our country will abandon this type of 
weapon, while other countries, including those bordering on 
Russia, will remain "chemically" armed and, moreover, will reach 
a new level as a result of scientific developments? In general 
terms the Foreign Ministry and Defense Ministry spokesmen 
assured those present that in this case there are reliable 
control mechanisms in place and the world community provides 
certain guarantees. But the detailed reply to this question 
obviously had to wait until the hearings resumed behind closed 
doors. 
  We would point out that the Convention on Chemical Weapons 
was signed in Paris in 1993. So far it has been signed by 156 
states. But it has been ratified by only four: Sweden, 
Mauritius, the Seychelles, and Fiji. Whether Russia is to 
become the fifth depends on how convincing the Foreign and 
Defense Ministries' pro-ratification arguments are in the eyes 
of the parliamentarians. All I would say is that, in the event 
of ratification, we will be able to count on financial 
assistance from Western countries and the United States.

<F P=106> [Report by Marat Zubko: "Russia Will Sink Reactors in Kara </F>
Sea"] 
  [Text] Helsinki -- The Norwegian ecological organization 
"Bellona" has found out the details of the forthcoming removal 
from combat service of 150 nuclear submarines in the Northern 
Fleet. 
  "Bellona" members Nils Bemer and Tomas Nilsen [both names as 
transliterated] have gained access to Northern Fleet documents 
which state that in accordance with the START II treaty within 
the next few years Russia must destroy 150 nuclear submarines 
with 278 reactors on board. 
  The authors of the report assert that so far only two 
submarines have been dismantled in the Northern Fleet but that 
nuclear fuel has been removed from the reactors of 34 ships. 
The main part of the submarines will be dismantled in 
Severodvinsk: There they will extract 206 reactors and 45,000 
used fuel elements from the submarines' bellies. 
  The Norwegians claim that new dry docks and storage 
facilities for radioactive waste, and moorings for the 
submarines which have been written off are to be constructed on 
the Kola peninsula. 
  The construction should have begun already but so far the 
majority of establishments are at the planning stage, the report 
says. 
  Of course, some of the fuel elements, the "Bellona" experts 
estimate, could be sent to the "Mayak" storage facility in 
Siberia. But what is to be done with the other fuel elements, 
the reactors themselves, and their reactor rooms? In this 
connection Bemer and Nilsen have the following to say: 
  "Of the documents we have read and the talks we have had 
with 
knowledgeable people it has become clear to us that the Russian 
authorities have two possible courses of action. The first is 
to return to the practice of submerging radioactive waste, 
including reactors, in the Kara Sea, which Russian renounced a 
few years ago. The second is to construct a major new storage 
facility somewhere in the Northwest of Russia. 
  "However," the report's authors continue, "it is known that 
the storage facilities existing on the Kola peninsula are 
already full and there is no money to construct new ones. So we 
believe that the most feasible option is connected with burying 
the waste at sea. Perhaps that is why Russia is not signing the 
London convention which bans the discharge of waste into the 
seas and oceans...."

normal, the press service said on Thursday adding that the subs 
returned to their base themselves. 
  It was earlier reported that the "contact" resulted in 
inconsiderable damages which pose no danger to personnel and

  [Text] [Announcer] No doubt our listeners recall that, 
after the Chernobyl tragedy, there was an outbreak of 
radiation-phobia in the USSR, as it was then. Armenia's nuclear 
power station was shut down. Stations that were virtually ready 
for commissioning were not handed over. Construction of new 
reactors was frozen. Nuclear power stations cannot generate 
electricity unless their fuel is regularly replaced -- but 
shipment of fuel for reprocessing was suspended. However, the 
situation has now begun to change. That is the view of Yevgeniy 
(Dzikun), chief engineer of the nuclear reprocessing plant at 
the town of Chelyabinsk-65. Journalist Yevgeniy Stankevich 
spoke to him. [begin recording] (Dzikun): Signs of 
a revival in our industry are visible, for the moment at least. 
Why do I say so? There is nowhere else for atomic power 
stations to turn to. They are already asking us to accept and 
reprocess this fuel. So we have carried out several shipments 
and removed fuel from atomic stations. We have similar plans for 
the second quarter as well. So we will have some work. 
  Stankevich: Will Ukraine's nuclear warheads be 
handled at your plant? 
  (Dzikun): Since 1986 our plant has had nothing 
whatsoever to do with the production of warheads, although that 
was our job from 1948 onward. In fact the works celebrated its 
45th anniversary in December 1993. We consider that the removal 
and correct use of uranium and plutonium from warheads does 
present problems. We see a possibility of our participation in 
this work. This is within our capability. But if we are to 
play a practical part in the implementation of these plans, a 
certain amount of modernization will have to be done to the 
installations we have here, because the requirements applicable 
to these materials are slightly different from those that 
existed when these warheads were manufactured. These materials 
will now be used for civilian purposes. If this task is to be 
resolved in practical way, financial questions will have to be 
settled first. 
  Stankevich: Bearing in mind that foreign atomic 
stations are paying you to reprocess fuel, would you reprocess 
fuel for our former neighbors and Russian stations for free, or 
will you make them pay something? 
  (Dzikun): Naturally, our prices are 
differentiated. There is one level of prices for the countries 
in the East European bloc, as it used to be. There is another 
level of prices for CIS countries, and a third level of prices 
for atomic stations in Russia. So you cannot say that we are 
making a fortune out of this. A large part of the money we make 
out of this, especially the hard currency, is spent on tackling 
ecological problems in the oblast. The combine receives roughly 
35-40 percent of the seemingly large sums that figure in 
contracts. That is a level that only just covers our own 
overheads. [end recording] 
  Announcer: In addition to what Yevgeniy Dzikun, 
the chief engineer of the nuclear reprocessing plant at the town 
of Chelyabinsk-65, said, let me add that the Armenian nuclear 
power station has been unfrozen. It is very possible that 
Chelyabinsk-65 will reprocess the fuel from Armenia.

  [Text] Moscow March 22 TASS -- Russia's atomic industry 
will be ready to stop the production of weapon-grade plutonium 
by late 1994. A Russo-American agreement to this effect is 
planned to be signed as early as in summer. The arrangement was 
reached during a visit of Russian specialists to the United 
States, Valeriy Bogdan, business manager of the Russian Ministry 
of Atomic Energy, told ITAR-TASS on Tuesday. 
  Three reactors producing weapon-grade plutonium continue to 
operate in Russia (one in Krasnoyarsk-26 and two in Tomsk-7). 
But these are dual-purpose reactors. They supply energy and 
heating not only to Krasnoyarsk-26 and Tomsk-7, but also to 
regional centres. The Ministry of Atomic Energy planes to phase 
out these reactors in 1997-1998. Their service life is almost 
completed. District power plants will be built instead. 
  Storages in Russia are now filled to the limit with 
weapon-grade plutonium and with plutonium released from 
dismantled nuclear weapons. There are large plutonium 
stockpiles in Russia and in the United States and there is no 
sense in continuing to manufacture plutonium. 
  However, Russia is now short of funds, and from the 
economical viewpoint it cannot stop plutonium-producing reactors 
and replace them with district power plants. Valeriy Bogdan 
believes it is necessary to reach agreement with the United 
States so that it help resolve the financial problem. The 
United States has stated the intention of helping to get funds, 
without giving guarantees of money, he said.

<F P=106> [ITAR-TASS report: "Deal With United States Is </F>
Advantageous"] 
  [Text] The "uranium deal" with the United States is 
advantageous to Russia, Nikolay Yegorov, Russian Federation 
deputy minister of atomic energy, believes. It will help 
Russian enterprises to survive. 
  On his return from Washington, where he signed an 
appropriate 
document with the U.S. secretary of commerce, Nikolay Yegorov 
disclosed that over the next two years Russia will now be able 
to supply the United States with up to 3,000 tonnes of uranium 
concentrate and a considerable quantity of enriched uranium 
worth a total of $150 million. Previously there were no 
deliveries in view of the agreement imposed on Russia in 1992 
whereby the export of Russian uranium was authorized only at 
prices that were effectively 1.5 times the world prices, the 
deputy minister emphasized. 
  Now an opportunity is opening up to resume sales on U.S. 
markets, which will help Russian uranium-extracting enterprises 
to improve their position. A special feature of the new 
agreement is the establishment of a procedure for joint sales 
whereby 50 percent of the Russian deal is combined with a 
similar quantity of American sales, and this mixed uranium is 
sold to consumers. 
  "The next two years will be especially difficult for 
Russia," 
Nikolay Yegorov said. "So the extra sources of freely 
convertible currency will come in very handy."

  [Excerpt] [passage omitted] According to government 
instructions, several ministries must ensure preparations for 
the scrapping of the nuclear reactors located at the Russian 
Federation's naval training center for nuclear submarine crews 
at Paldiski [near Tallinn], as reported to ETA [Estonian 
Telegraph Agency] by the government press service. 
  The Environment Ministry must ensure that radiation levels 
are constantly monitored, the Economics Ministry must ensure an 
uninterrupted supply of electricity for the removal of nuclear 
fuel and radioactive materials, the Interior Ministry must, 
according to the government instructions, ensure security on 
site and necessary resources in case of fire and for the 
evacuation of the population in case of a threat of radiation. 
The Social Affairs Ministry will be responsible for medical 
assistance and the Ministry for Roads and Communications for the 
safe and unimpeded rail passage for the containers carrying 
nuclear fuel. The Foreign Ministry must draft a basic agreement 
on the work on scrapping of the nuclear reactors and related 
issues. The Interior Ministry will be coordinating these tasks; 
it must draw up a general plan for the removal of nuclear fuel 
from the nuclear reactors by 28 March. By today [25 March], all 
the above ministries must present their recommendations to the 
Interior Ministry on the expenses budget on the scrapping of the 
nuclear reactors.

<F P=106> [From 22 March RAHVA HAAL, PAEVALEHT, HOMMIKULEHT; "News </F>
Bulletin" No. 55/94] 
  [Text] Tuesday, March 22 -- Yesterday's questions and 
answers session was dominated by the Israeli weapons deal. 
Prime Minister Mart Laar and Commander in Chief Aleksander 
Einseln had to answer questions concerning their compatibility 
to the NATO standards and quality. 
  The Israeli-made small arms do not meet the STANAG 
agreements 
since Israel is not a member of the NATO, General Einseln 
explained. However, since the agreements concern primarily 
ammunition, the weapons can be considered as meeting the STANAG 
requirements, he stressed. Einseln added that the government 
had not approached him before on the NATO standards issue and 
the decision to purchase weapons from Israel had been made 
before he became Commander in Chief. 
  MP Andra Veidemann questioned Mart Laar on the incomplete 
weapons consignments and the premier claimed the drawbacks to be 
insignificant. Laar mentioned some missing cartridge clips and 
bayonets, stressed that this does not prevent the weapons from 
being used, and added that the Israeli company will supply the 
missing parts. Estonian experts will later check on the 
completeness of the consignments before they will be shipped to 
Estonia, Laar assured the parliament. 
  Further questions concerned the presented 23-millimetre 
anti- 
aircraft guns. Laar told the Riigikogu [parliament] that the 
decision had been made after an appeal by GHQ chief of staff 
Colonel Ants Laaneots during his visit to Israel last year. 
Laar claimed that the anti-aircraft guns as well as the machine 
guns had really been a present, outside the consignment which 
had been paid for. The Israeli supplier will help to repair the 
unusable weapons, he added. But the opposition members 
disagreed. Peeter Lorents claimed to have rarely heard "such a 
barefaced lie" as told by Laar and further explained that tests 
had disclosed more serious drawbacks with the weapons. He 
specifically mentioned defective mines and anti-tank ammunition. 
Lorents was seconded by MP Jiri Toomepuu, who claimed to have 
seen the original agreement, according to which the defective 
anti-aircraft guns were a part of the deal. They were supported 
by some other members. Centrist MP Olav Anton commented that 
only the Defence Minister, who has never served in the army, 
could believe such vague explanations. 
  Centrist MP Liina Tdnisson asked about the renting of the 
building in 3 Toompuiestee and Laar explained that the 
government had decided to hold an open auction. But he repeated 
that the government keeps supporting the idea of renting it to 
the company "Koneston", which intends to organise a Russian 
business centre there. 
  Laar rejected the claims that the mari airfield is being 
used 
for transporting stolen cars out of Estonia. The Estonian 
border guard is checking the leaving aircraft, he said. 
  Laar also explained that the government had decided to 
spread 
the funds of the national budget between different banks purely 
in order to cut the risks. He added that a closed contest will 
be held to determine the banks which will handle the funds next 
year. 
  Laar assured the parliament that the investigation of the 
cases when police officers mistreated Defence League members is 
continuing and Interior Minister Heiki Arike has been instructed 
to pursue the matter. But the names of most policemen who 
allegedly beat the volunteers are still unknown, Laar admitted. 
  The "Independents" faction of the Riigikogu elected Jaanus 
Raidal its chairman and Mart Niklus vice-chairman. Other 
members of the six-man faction are Ants Erm, Avo Kiir, Kalju 
Pdldvere and Toivo Uustalu. Raidal announced that the faction 
meeting approved a resolution to support the reinforcement of 
law and order in Estonia.

  [Text] Almaty March 19 TASS -- U.S. Secretary of defence 
William Perry, who is currently in Kazakhstan on a working 
visit, was received in the republican Ministry of Defence on 
Saturday. Mr Perry also attended a session of the joint 
Kazakhstan-American committee on defence industry conversion to 
civilian production. 
  The meetings, and the talks with President Nursultan 
Nazarbayev several hours earlier, resulted in the signing of an 
agreement on the conversion of the Kazakhstan defence industry 
to civilian production. 
  The agreement is actually a supplement to the earlier 
reached 
accord on the dismantling of the SS-18 missile silos and ensures 
an influx of an aggregate of $70 million to the republic for 
defence industry conversion needs. 
  These documents are intended to ensure the dismantling of 
combat nuclear missile systems based in Kazakhstan and convert 
them to suit civilian and peaceful purposes, and additional 
training of the military personnel subject to demobilisation. 
  U.S. businesses are to be invited to help the defence 
industry conversion effort. In particular, a number of American 
companies will be involved in the reconstruction of appropriate 
enterprises for them to change over to the manufacture of 
consumer goods. 
  Mr. Perry and his party are to leave for Baykonur cosmodrome 
on March 20.

<F P=106> [Report by ITAR-TASS correspondent Vladimir Akimov] </F>
  [Text] Almaty, March 20 (TASS) -- On completing the 
official part of his Kazakh visit, U.S. Defence Secretary 
Willian Perry departed for the Baykonur cosmodrome from the 
Kazakh capital. 
  The secretary's visit to the cosmodrome is of a sight-seeing 
nature. However, the aims pursued by this trip are 
self-evident. The U.S. side is interested in studying Baykonur's 
possibilities with a view to U.S. participation in the use of 
its unique potential. 
  In the opinion of several local analysts, Kazakhstan tries 
to 
bring pressure on Russia by organising the U.S. defence 
secretary's visit to Baykonur. Several rounds of the 
Kazakh-Russian talks held in the recent past brought closer the 
positions of the sides. 
  However, they could not agree, for the time being, on the 
period of a lease and the amount of a lease payment. 
  Almaty believes that if the United States displays readiness 
for cooperation with the republic in the use of the cosmodrome, 
it will be possible to cut short the duration of its leasing to 
Russia and, consequently, to start earlier the establishment of 
an international space company or any other form of its 
utilisation on a multilateral basis. 
  Following the visit to Baykonur, Perry and his party will go 
to Kiev.

<F P=106> [Report by ITAR-TASS special correspondent Aleksey Agureyev, </F>
UKRINFORM correspondent Sergey Balykov] 
  [Text] Kiev March 22 TASS -- U.S. Defence Secretary William 
Perry has been the first foreign defence minister to visit a 
strategic missile unit in Pervomaysk, Ukraine, and a classified 
military plant in Dnepropetrovsk. 
  Ukraine ranks the world's third in the number of nuclear 
warheads stationed on its territory. It is preceded only by the 
United States and Russia. Two types of missiles are stationed 
in Pervomaysk, the Nikolayev region. Part of missiles have been 
dismantled. 
  The U.S. Pentagon head visited a dismantled missile silo to 
see a de-activated SS-24 missile. The secretary was told by 
Ukrainian servicemen that warheads have been removed from 30 
SS-24 missiles and eleven SS-19 missiles. All in all, this will 
be done to 46 SS- 24 and 30 SS-19 missiles. 
  Last year Ukrainian specialists took off duty two regiments 
of strategic missiles. One of them to include ten systems was 
withdrawn from Pervomaysk. Nuclear warheads have been 
dismantled and sent to technical storages, missiles have been 
removed from silos, fuel and oxidizer were put into special 
tanks, loaded into freight cars and set to the Yuzhmash plant in 
Dnepropetrovsk. 
  The U.S. defence secretary visited the Yuzhmash plant, which 
earlier produced the world's only high-precision heavy missiles 
capable to deliver up to ten warheads of megaton weight. The 
plant and its design bureau produced four generations of 
intercontinental ballistic missiles and made the first 
artificial earth satellite of the Cosmos series together with 
the rocket booster. 
  Now the plant continues to produce space equipment, 
simultaneously with first Ukrainian trolley-buses and wind 
engines.

  [Text] Before the forthcoming parliamentary elections in 
Ukraine, several important parties there are demanding that, 
despite previous agreements, the country should retain some of 
its nuclear weapons. "The Echo" program correspondent Kjell 
Albin Abrahamson reports from Ukraine. 
  Abrahamson: Today Yeltsin is governing Russia, but 
tomorrow Zhirinovskiy may come to power. Today President 
Clinton is supporting Ukraine, but we know nothing about the 
next U.S. President. This was said by Ukrainian General 
(Oleksandr Rul), who will stand as a candidate of the 
super-nationalist Congress of Ukrainian Nationalists in the 
parliamentary elections. He now sees nationalism and nuclear 
weapons as the best guarantee for an independent and sovereign 
Ukraine. 
  Most political parties here share that view, including the 
Republican Party -- an offshoot of the dissident movement -- and 
the Helsinki Committee for Human Rights, which want Ukraine to 
retain some of its nearly 1,800 nuclear warheads. General (Rul) 
points out: It is us, not you who are in the immediate 
frontline in the event of a Russian attack.

<F P=106> [Wilhelm Theuretsbacher report: "Missile Terrorism With </F>
Chemicals From Salzburg?"] 
  [Text] Dictators in the Third World were highly 
interested. A special propellant is required for firing 
missiles on Europe, which could be purchased in Salzburg -- 
until last week. 
  In a concerted action by the Economics, Finance, and 
Interior 
Ministries, the filing cabinets of a Salzburg firm were opened 
during a search of the office. The subsidiary of a foreign 
company produced special aluminum and magnesium compounds, which 
reached Latin America and the Middle and Far East in a 
roundabout way. 
  The buyers are mainly states that are trying to convert 
obsolete missile systems. The most widespread missiles -- like 
the "Scud" missiles that became know as a result of the Gulf war 
-- are being propelled by liquid fuels and have a range of 600 
km in the original version. Only a few states have systems with 
wider ranges. Numerous countries, including Libya, Syria, and 
Iran, want to increase the range to 2,000 km with the aid of 
solid propellants. Thus, "targets" like Vienna, Paris, or Rome 
are becoming realistic. 
  The basis for the conversion is the metallic powder that was 
offered illegally in Salzburg. The investigating authorities 
have examined dozens of deliveries. Like nearly everything else 
in this case, the exact extent of the damage is a top secret. 
  The Salzburg company has violated the amended foreign trade 
law. The responsible officials are facing 10-year prison terms. 
Moreover, the deliveries also infringed the MTCR Agreement 
[expansion not known], designed to prevent the proliferation of 
missile technology. The suspects deny any criminal intent. The 
fuel components can also be used for civilian purposes -- such 
as fireworks... 
  For the Austrian police, the operation was a first in a new 
criminal sphere, called "proliferation." It refers to the 
illegal procurement of nuclear, chemical, and biological warfare 
agents, including the relevant carrier technology. These 
economic crimes with an intensive intelligence background are 
new ground for the police. The usual methods do not yield the 
desired results in this area. The police needs highly qualified 
experts like physical and chemical engineers and economic 
experts. 
  The counterstrategy is a police reform. As a result of the 
total reform of the antiterrorism task force (EBT), the Interior 
Ministry has scored several international successes in the 
sphere of terrorism, the smuggling of refugees, and nuclear 
crime. This is one of the reasons why EBT leader Josef Dick was 
appointed as provisional head of Group D (criminal police). His 
task is to initiate the overdue reform among the criminal police.

  [Text] The submarine Le Triomphant was secretly launched in 
Cherbourg this weekend. More details now with Herve de Haro 
from Cherbourg: 
  Haro: Le Triomphant is a high-tech marvel. With a 
displacement of 12,640 tons and a length of 138 meters, it is 
much larger than its predecessors. It is faster too and should 
also be extremely quiet, one of the quietest in the world -- it 
could even be called a stealth submarine. Its propeller is 
classified top secret and is careened to protect it from preying 
eyes and to make it even more silent. 
  Le Triomphant is now in its natural element. It will sail in 
a few months time for its first sea trials. The first concern 
of the DCN [Direction of Navy shipbuilding] is to find all the 
noises made by the various equipment on board the submarine. 
All the noises will be recorded and analyzed, and engineers 
will have to reduce them. 
  Le Triomphant must be able to sail undetected even by the 
most sophisticated detection equipment. This is Herve de Haro 
reporting from Cherbourg for France Inter.

  [Text] The Defence Ministry has launched an investigation 
into an aborted attempt by two unidentified armed men to steal 
sophisticated anti-aircraft missiles from a military airbase and 
munitions depot, near Patrai. 
  Taking advantage of a defective ground lighting system which 
had left half the base in darkness, the two men scaled a 
chain-link fence surrounding the Araxos military base around 
4am, entering undetected. After breaking into a munitions 
warehouse, they grabbed a box of what they believed to contain 
anti-aircraft missile shells and made for the camp perimeter. 
  But their escape was foiled by a guard, who shouted for them 
to stop. Opening fire on the guard, the two men raced across 
the compound and escaped over the fence. With army guards still 
in pursuit, they dropped the box in a nearby ditch. It was 
later found to be full of empty 20mm Rheinmetall RH202 shells. 
Military police launched a manhunt in the surrounding area 
while anti-terrorism experts and a forensics team were ordered 
to Araxos to aid in the manhunt. 
  The Defence Ministry has also ordered an internal inquiry 
amid questions about possible security breaches at the base, 
which includes an airfield for fighter craft, a communications 
center and munitions stores. 
  Ministry sources said preliminary evidence suggested the 
botched operation was a sophisticated operation planned by 
professionals. News reports highlighted similarities to a 
December 1989 rocket snatch from a Larissa base by the November 
17 urban guerrilla group but officials did not rule out the 
possibility of a simple arms heist.

  [Text] In view of the results so far achieved on the 
International Atomic Energy Agency's nuclear inspections of 
North Korea's facilities, North Korea is learned to have carried 
out extension work [poganggongsa] on the facilities inside the 
radiochemical laboratory since February, while replacing some 
nuclear fuel rods in the 5-megawatt reactor. Correspondent Cha 
Man-sun reports from Vienna: [begin recording] 
  Correspondent Cha Man-sun: According to a report 
to be submitted to a special Board of Governors' meeting on the 
result of the North's nuclear facilities inspections, it has 
been revealed for the first time that the IAEA conducted a 
non-destructive analysis, involving neutron and gamma 
measurement to grasp the substance and replacement timing of the 
spent fuel rods of the 5-megawatt reactor's spent fuel storage. 
  Regarding this, nuclear experts analyzed that when things 
are 
taken together from the recent inspection results, North Korea 
has replaced some nuclear fuel rods since last February. North 
Korea had maintained that it has not replaced the 5-megawatt 
nuclear reactor's fuel rods. They said the result of the 
analysis of the nuclear fuel rod counter [kyesugi] which watches 
the movement of the spent nuclear fuel will prove this. 
  The report stressed that the continuity of the inspection 
can 
be maintained only when inspections of the 5-megawatt nuclear 
reactor are resumed after six weeks. 
  The report also revealed that an IAEA inspection team was 
restricted from making inspections -- such as extracting samples 
and wastes of nuclear materials, and measuring radioactivity -- 
from the six major facilities -- including a plutonium refinery 
facility inside the radiochemcial laboratory, a nuclear waste 
storage, a reprocessing facility, a radioactivity gas filtering 
device [kicheyogwasisol], thus hinting that North Korea has 
supplemented the indoor facilities of the reprocessing facility 
for the last year. [End recording]

<F P=106> [IAEA "Press Release -- for use of information media -- not </F>
an official record": "IAEA Board of Governors Holds Meeting on 
Inspections in the Democratic People's Republic of Korea (DPRK)"] 
  [Text] The Board of Governors of the International Atomic 
Energy Agency held a meeting on March 21 to consider the 
situation arising from the prevention by the DPRK, during an 
IAEA inspection visit to the DPRK March 1-15, 1994, of 
activities to verify whether nuclear material had been diverted 
since the Agency's last inspection in 1993. 
  Following its discussion, the Board adopted a resolution, 
inter alia expressing its grave concern, finding the DPRK in 
further non-compliance with its Safeguards Agreement; calling 
upon the DPRK immediately to allow the IAEA to complete all 
required inspection activities and to comply fully with its 
Safeguards Agreement; and requesting the Director General to 
transmit the resolution and his report to the Security Council 
and General Assembly of the United Nations. 
  The full text of the Board's resolution, as adopted, is 
attached: 
IMPLEMENTATION OF THE AGREEMENT BETWEEN THE AGENCY AND THE 
DEMOCRATIC PEOPLE'S REPUBLIC OF KOREA FOR THE APPLICATION OF 
SAFEGUARDS IN CONNECTION WITH THE TREATY ON THE 
NON-PROLIFERATION OF NUCLEAR WEAPONS (INFCIRC/403) 
THE BOARD OF GOVERNORS, 
  (a) RECALLING the Board of Governors' resolutions GOV/2636 
of 25 February 1993, GOV/2639 of 19 March 1993, GOV/2692 of 23 
September 1993, the General Conference's resolution GC 
(XXXVII)/RES/624 of 1 October 1993, and in particular, GOV/2645 
of 1 April 1993, which found the Democratic People's Republic of 
Korea (DPRK) to be in non- compliance with its safeguards 
agreement (INFCIRC/403) and referred the matter to the Security 
Council of the United Nations, 
  (b) RECALLING ALSO resolution 825 (1993) adopted by the 
Security Council of the United Nations on 11 May 1993, which, 
INTER ALIA, requested the Director General to report on this 
matter to the Security Council, 
  (c) NOTING the Director General's written and oral reports 
of 21 March 1994 and GOV/2687/ADD.4 in which he stated that the 
Agency inspection team was not allowed to conduct indispensable 
and agreed inspection activities at the DPRK radiochemical 
laboratory, and that the Agency is unable to draw conclusions as 
to whether there has been either diversion of nuclear material 
or reprocessing at the radiochemical laboratory since February 
1993, 
  (d) NOTING FURTHER the Director General's reaffirmation 
that the Secretariat remains available to perform inspection 
activities in the DPRK in accordance with its procedures and 
agreements, and 
  (e) TAKING ACCOUNT of the fact that the DPRK is a party to 
the NPT and is bound by its safeguards commitments; 
  (1) EXPRESSES grave concern that the Democratic People's 
Republic of Korea has failed to implement essential elements of 
resolutions of the Board and the General Conference concerning 
its non- compliance with its safeguards agreement (INFCIRC/403) 
  (2) FINDS that the DPRK is in further non-compliance with 
its safeguards agreement, has aggravated this situation by not 
allowing IAEA inspectors to conduct indispensable inspection 
activities and that the Agency consequently remains unable to 
verify that there has been no diversion of nuclear material 
required to be safeguarded under the terms of the safeguards 
agreement to nuclear weapons or other nuclear explosive devices; 
  (3) STRONGLY ENDORSES and commends the patient and 
impartial efforts of the Director General and the Secretariat to 
implement the safeguards agreement; 
  (4) REGRETS the stalement in the Agency's efforts to 
resolve the DPRK safeguards issue, as requested by the Security 
Council of the United Nations, due to the lack of cooperation of 
the DPRK; 
  (5) CALLS UPON the DPRK immediately to allow the IAEA to 
complete all requested inspection activities and to comply fully 
with its safeguards agreement; 
  (6) REQUESTS the Director General to transmit this 
resolution and his report to all members of the Agency and to 
the Security Council and the General Assembly of the United 
Nations in accordance with Article XII.C. of the Statute; and 
  (7) REMAINS SEIZED of the matter and REQUESTS the Director 
General to report back to the Board any significant developments 
at its next meeting when it will consider, if necessary, further 
measures in accordance with Article XII.C. of the Statute.

  [Text] Vienna, March 21 (YONHAP) -- The International 
Atomic Energy Agency's board of governors overwhelmingly adopted 
a resolution Monday referring the North Korean nuclear dispute 
to the United Nations Security Council. 
  The vote on the resolution, sponsored by 17 board members 
including the United States, Britain, Germany and Russia, was 25 
for, one against and five abstentions. 
  China, whose position on the issue had attracted the most 
interest, abstained along with India, Indonesia, Brazil and 
Lebanon. 
  The only opposing vote was cast by Libya. Cuba and Syria did 
not take part in the voting. 
  The resolution contained wording that said the IAEA will 
notify the UN Security Council of the matter. 
  However, it is believed the resolution is more than an act 
of 
notification as it indirectly urges the Security Council to 
implement countermeasures, observers said. 
  The resolution expresses the most serious concern ever by 
the 
IAEA board of governors over the possibility that North Korea 
has diverted nuclear material for other than stated purposes. 
  It asks IAEA Director-General Hans Blix to report the 
resolution not only to all IAEA members but also the United 
Nations General Assembly and the Security Council. 
  The resolution specifically mentions that the IAEA could not 
prove that North Korea had not used nuclear material for nuclear 
weapons or nuclear explosive devices. The observers deemed it 
significant that the IAEA has used the terms "nuclear weapons" 
and "nuclear explosive devices" for the first time in its 
resolution on the North Korean issue. 
  The resolution, consisting of seven items, expresses regret 
that the IAEA was unable to fulfill the Security Council's 
request to resolve the dispute because of North Korea's 
uncooperative attitude. 
  It recalls that the Security Council instructed Blix last 
May 
to report back to the council on how the issue was progressing, 
thus indirectly requesting that the Security Council eventually 
deliberate countermeasures. 
  At the same time, the resolution urged North Korea once 
again 
to allow unfettered IAEA inspections, implement the nuclear 
safeguards agreement and fulfill its obligations as a signatory 
to the nuclear non-proliferation treaty (NPT). 
  The IAEA said the North Korean problem will remain a major 
pending issue and warned that, if Pyongyang does not fulfill its 
obligations under the nuclear safeguards agreement, it will take 
follow-up steps in accordance with its charter including 
disqualification and suspension of technology cooperation. 
  In his opening report to the board meeting, Blix said 
inspection of the radiochemical laboratory was a must and North 
Korea had already agreed to allow it. 
  Despite its earlier agreement, North Korea refused to let 
IAEA inspectors check the laboratory, making it impossible to 
determine whether the stalinist state had diverted nuclear 
material for non- peaceful purposes since the last inspection in 
February. 
  Blix warned that the IAEA would no longer remain silent on 
the issue. 
  The IAEA is ready to send experts again to check facilities 
they could not inspect last time. In order to do so, North 
Korea must offer the UN watchdog a clear commitment that it 
would allow all inspections. 
  The North Korean representative denounced the resolution, 
charging that the IAEA had reached a hasty and irrational 
conclusion and was putting unjust pressure on Pyongyang.

<F P=106> [Telephone interview with David Kyd, information director of </F>
the International Atomic Energy Agency, by Hans-Joachim Wiese; 
Kyd in Vienna -- live] 
  [Text] [Wiese] Mr. Kyd, the IAEA [International Atomic 
Energy Agency] is responsible for the inspection of the nuclear 
facilities in the DPRK -- actually not only in the DPRK but all 
over the world -- but it is massively prevented from doing its 
duty by Pyongyang. Therefore, the day before yesterday the IAEA 
Governors' Council decided to refer the issue to the UN Security 
Council. What does your Agency expect from that? 
  Kyd: We are indeed the inspection agency, but, of 
course, we cannot force the DPRK to open the facilities in the 
DPRK for our inspections, if the DPRK has problems with that. 
And this is the case. Our director general will go to New York 
today. There will be a UN Security Council meeting, and I could 
imagine that the Security Council will adopt a resolution next 
week. We hope that the DPRK will realize that the matter has to 
be clarified and that this will increase security not only in 
Asia but also in the DPRK itself. 
  Wiese: Inspectors of your organization have 
already gone to the DPRK, and they have been able to visit a few 
nuclear facilities. The problem probably is just one very 
specific facility. Mr. Kyd, what are the specific findings of 
the IAEA regarding the question of whether or not the DPRK has 
the nuclear bomb? 
  Kyd: For a nuclear weapon you need three things: 
First, a carrier system; second, an ignition mechanism -- one 
must be able to master that; and third, fissionable material, 
which is plutonium. It is our job to find out how much plutonium 
the DPRK actually has. The DPRK claims that it has produced just 
a few grams. However, we suspect that there is more than that. 
We do not yet know how much and we were prevented from finding 
out because over the past two weeks, as you have already 
mentioned, we have not been permitted to take samples in one 
facility, in one laboratory, where plutonium has been produced 
in the past, to find out what the level of radioactivity is like 
in this facility. This means that we do not know whether this 
facility is utilized fully or whether, as the North Koreans 
claim, nothing has been produced there recently. 
  Wiese: The IAEA resolution, which I mentioned at 
the beginning, threatens more far-reaching measures, if the DPRK 
continues to be unwilling to cooperate. What is one to 
understand by that? 
  Kyd: We ourselves can take only limited measures 
because the IAEA is actually responsible only for inspections. 
However, in the UN Security Council it is clear that both a 
warning and economic sanctions are conceivable if all members of 
the UN Security Council, including China, agree to them. 
  Wiese: The DPRK, however, is threatening to leave 
the Nonproliferation Treaty if international pressure continues. 
What would such a step mean? 
  Kyd: Of course, it would be very bad, because 161 
countries are participating in this treaty and that it would be 
the first time in 25 years that a country leaves the treaty. It 
would create a precedent and would not to be welcomed. On the 
other hand, the international community also has to consider 
whether, after one year, there is any sense in negotiating with 
a country that is obviously unwilling to fulfill its 
obligations. This is not a good example for other countries in 
the future. One could expect another country to try to get 
concessions by saying: I am neither in the treaty nor outside. 
What do you offer me? 
  We want to prevent that, too. 
  Wiese: Mr. Kyd, next year an international 
conference must decide whether or not the Nonproliferation 
Treaty, which was concluded 25 years ago, as you said, is to be 
extended. The day before yesterday, the following countries did 
not join the vote of the Board of Governors -- either by 
abstaining or by voting against: Libya, Brazil, India, and 
Indonesia. China abstained. All these are potential nuclear 
powers. This is not a good sign for the future of the 
Nonproliferation Treaty. 
  Kyd: I believe that one cannot draw such a 
conclusion from that. It was rather a disagreement about 
whether or not pressure of this kind by the UN Security Council 
is appropriate, whether or not it will be effective. I 
certainly believe that the Nonproliferation Treaty will be 
extended next spring, that is, in one year. Whether for another 
10 years or for another 25 years is not yet clear. However, it 
is a treaty that has been in effect for 25 years already. There 
are only five nuclear powers all over the world and three 
so-called threshold countries -- Israel, Pakistan, and India -- 
which have perhaps already mastered this technology. This is a 
good result. Now we have South Africa in this treaty, and soon 
Brazil and Argentina will join and the republics of the former 
Soviet Union. I think this is certainly positive. 
  Of course, now there is an acute case -- namely the DPRK. On 
the other hand, however, 160 countries have joined the treaty, 
and we believe the current case should not be interpreted too 
dramatically. Of course, for northeast Asia, however, it would 
indeed be a serious case if the DPRK were to leave the treaty. 
Then the situation will become very sensitive there, not only 
for South Korea but also for Japan, and even for China. 
  Wiese: Thank you very much. This was David Kyd, 
information director of the IAEA in Vienna. Good bye, Mr. Kyd.

  [Text] International Atomic Energy Agency [IAEA] Spokesman 
David Kyd disclosed on 23 March that it seems that North Korea 
will complete the construction of its second nuclear reactor 
within this year. Spokesman Kyd said that North Korea is 
building its second nuclear reactor in Yongbyon. The 50 
megawatt nuclear reactor is scheduled for completion by the end 
of this year. 
  He said that North Korea is currently building a third 
nuclear reactor in Taechon, which is even more secluded than 
Yongbyon, and that the 200 megawatt reactor will begin 
operations early in 1996. 
  He pointed out, however, that the practical issue regarding 
North Korea's plan for nuclear development is how North Korea 
dealt with the nuclear fuel it extracted from the small five 
megawatt nuclear reactor which has been in operation since 1987.

  [Text] United Nations, March 24 (YONHAP) -- North Korea 
refused to let the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) 
fully check its seven declared nuclear sites during March 3-14 
inspections, IAEA Director-General Hans Blix told the U.N. 
Security Council on Thursday. 
  In a press conference after his report to the Security 
Council, Blix said that North Korea is capable of producing 
plutonium needed to manufacture atomic bombs and that the 
Stalinist country may have more plutonium than it has admitted. 
  As North Korea refused to allow IAEA experts to examine a 
radiochemical laboratory, one of seven declared nuclear 
facilities, the IAEA cannot verify the laboratory has not 
produced plutonium since February 1993 when it was last 
inspected. 
  To determine whether the laboratory has produced plutonium, 
sampling and gamma-ray tests are necessary, he added. 
  Blix said he does not know whether North Korea has the 
capability to produce nuclear weapons, but the IAEA has 
concluded that Pyongyang diverted plutonium from spent nuclear 
fuel on several occasions as a result of its inspections. This 
means the North Koreans have secured far more plutonium than 
they admitted in the gram unit.

  [Text] North Korea warned that it will take a certain 
practical step if the International Atomic Energy Agency [IAEA] 
does not withdraw its resolution regarding the nuclear 
inspection of North Korea. Today, the North Korean mission to 
Geneva distributed the statement issued by the North Korean 
General Department of Atomic Energy and denounced that the IAEA 
is pursuing a vicious political goal. 
  North Korea said that if the UN Security Council takes steps 
to impose sanctions on North Korea, it will regard these steps 
as a declaration of war and that it will take a practical step 
corresponding to the IAEA Secretariat's unfairness if the IAEA 
does not withdraw its resolution.

  [Text] China has expressed its support of North Korea's 
position on the nuclear issue by asking visiting ROK President 
Kim Yong-sam to suspend the ROK-U.S. Team Spirit joint military 
exercise and the deployment of Patriot missiles to the ROK. 
  (Zhen Guobang), a spokesman for the PRC Foreign Ministry, 
said this to reporters yesterday [28 March] after talks between 
President Kim Yong-sam and PRC President Jiang Zemin. He made 
it clear that China has no intention of pressuring North Korea 
on the nuclear issue, saying that China has made efforts in its 
own way, but the role it can play is restricted and that, since 
North Korea is a sovereign country, no other country is in the 
position of telling or requiring it to do anything.

<F P=106> [Editorial: "China's Role and Responsibility"] </F>
  [Text] The East Asian countries and the rest of the world 
are focusing attention on China's role regarding the North Korea 
nuclear issue following the sudden aggravation of North-South 
relations with the rupture of the North-South working-level 
contact. Having signed a friendly and cooperative agreement, 
China is in a position to greatly influence North Korea. 
  It has been learned that while he was in Beijing, Japanese 
Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa met with Chinese state leaders, 
including PRC President Jiang Zemin and Premier Li Peng, and 
asked them to persuade North Korea to fully accept international 
nuclear inspections. 
  Prior to the Japanese prime minister's Beijing visit, U.S. 
Secretary of State Warren Christopher visited Beijing last week 
and agreed with the Chinese side to jointly cooperate on 
resolving the North Korean nuclear issue. Now, the countries 
concerned have formed an international cooperation system to 
check North Korean nuclear development. 
  As noted by Qiao Zonghuai, PRC Ambassador to the ROK, it is 
the Chinese official position to oppose the international 
community's strong steps against North Korea, including UN 
Security Council sanctions. We would like to stress a point, 
however, that the North Korean nuclear issue will have a serious 
impact not only on the Korean peninsula, but also on all East 
Asian countries, including countries surrounding the Korean 
peninsula. Japan -- which shows the most sensitive reaction to 
the North Korean nuclear issue -- has said on many occasions 
that it cannot but develop nuclear weapons if North Korea's 
nuclear development is not checked. Also, it is showing signs 
of strengthening its military capacity, such as by forming a 
regional security network, to deal with North Korea's 
development of long-range missiles. If the North Korean nuclear 
issue remains a factor of unrest in this area, regional economic 
cooperation -- including Japanese-PRC economic cooperation, 
which is to be announced following Japanese Prime Minister 
Hosokawa's visit in China, and ROK-PRC economic cooperation -- 
will be seriously affected and this will adversely affect 
China's reform and opening policy that it is now actively 
carrying out. 
  We would like to stress the role and responsibility of 
China, 
which is one of the leading countries throughout the world, 
rather than the regional economic cooperation in East Asia, 
including the support for China's openness. As a permanent 
member state of the UN Security Council, which is aimed at 
global peace, China should assume international responsibility 
for the North Korean nuclear issue. If the North Korean nuclear 
issue is referred to the UN Security Council and, as a result, 
the international community imposes sanctions on North Korea, 
China -- which opposes international sanctions against North 
Korea -- will be placed in a difficult situation. Therefore, it 
is better for China to persuade North Korea to meet the demands 
of the international community. This will also meet the demands 
of China for the settlement of the North Korean nuclear issue 
through peaceful methods and dialogue. 
  China will not use "the North Korean nuclear issue card" 
multi-laterally to improve relations with foreign countries, we 
urge it to persuade North Korea to accept nuclear inspections. 
This is because we are concerned that the North Korean nuclear 
issue may cause constant unrest in peace and stability on the 
Korean peninsula, as well as East Asia, including China. To 
avoid such unrest, it is imperative for China to participate in 
the international cooperation system carried out by the ROK, the 
United States, and Japan and to carry out its responsibility and 
role as a great power in the international arena.

  [Text] Seoul, March 19 (YONHAP) -- China will not agree to 
UN sanctions or any other stringent action against North Korea 
despite the current nuclear row, Chinese Ambassador to Seoul 
Zhang Tingyan said Saturday. 
  The envoy's comments come a week before South Korean 
President Kim Yong-sam goes to China, where seeking Beijing's 
support for any decision the international community makes, 
including sanctions, is a top priority. 
  Beijing supports North Korea-U.S. diplomatic normalization 
because it would enhance peace and stability on the Korean 
peninsula, just as China-South Korea relations did, he said. 
  "It's an international rule now to solve all issues through 
dialogue," Zhang said in an exclusive interview with YONHAP News 
Agency. "Why should the North Korean nuclear problem be an 
exception?" 
  Some countries are demanding hard-line action instead of 
dialogue, hurrying to take the matter to the UN Security Council 
and impose sanctions, he said. 
  "The security council, the sanctions or any other stringent 
measures, China cannot agree to," he told YONHAP. 
  "Such measures are not only ineffective, they would only 
complicate matters, aggravate the situation," Zhang said. 
  The International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), the UN 
nuclear 
watchdog, resumed inspections in North Korea early this month 
after a one-year break. But the agency announced this week that 
North Korea denied its inspectors access to critical sites, and 
thus they could not verify whether the stalinist state had 
diverted nuclear material for non-peaceful purposes. 
  Seoul and Washington's reaction was immediate and strong, 
with both saying they are becoming more convinced that dialogue 
may not be the right solution. 
  The 35-member IAEA Board of Governors convenes on March 21, 
and its final verdict on the inspection results will decide 
whether the matter goes to the security council. 
  "But one cannot say that the inspections were useless," the 
Chinese envoy said. "The fact that the IAEA insepctors went to 
North Korea was progress: Inspection itself was progress." 
  He strongly implied that this was the message President 
Jiang 
Zemin will deliver to South Korean President Kim Yong-sam, 
saying, "I don't know what President Jiang will say. But he is 
certain to make Beijing's position sufficiently clear." 
  Zhang emphasized dialogue among the parties directly 
involved, namely South and North Korea and Pyongyang and 
Washington. 
  He went further to state that Beijing wants to see Pyongyang 
and Washington normalize relations. "North Korea-U.S. diplomatic 
normalization will contribute to peace and stability on the 
Korean peninsula. China-South Korea diplomatic normalization 
did," he said. 
  Zhang called President Kim's visit timely because Seoul and 
Beijing are at a juncture where they must discuss elevating 
their relations to a new level. 
  "People-to-people exchanges are important, but the most 
important thing is for heads of state to meet directly. In this 
sense, the summit opens at a most crucial time," he said. 
  He foresaw no chance of Chinese leader Jiang making 
simultaneous visits to Seoul and Pyongyang as was recently 
reported in the press. 
  As to Jiang's South Korean visit, he said the agenda will be 
settled at the summit with President Kim. 
  Beijing is ready to discuss regional and global political 
developments with Seoul and engage in multilateral security 
dialogue within the framework of the Asia-Pacific Economic 
Cooperation (APEC), the envoy said. 
  On bilateral military cooperation, Zhang said such links may 
well begin when Chinese military attaches arrive in Seoul 
sometime in mid-April.

  [Text] Tokyo, March 25 KYODO -- Japan has been discussing 
North Korea's suspected nuclear weapons development program with 
South Korea and the United States to formulate its own policy on 
the issue, Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa said Friday [25 
March]. 
  Chief Cabinet Secretary Masayoshi Takemura told a news 
conference that the premier told cabinet members he had compared 
notes on the nuclear threat from north korea with visiting South 
Korean President Kim Yong-sam. 
  He also said Tokyo has been discussing the issue with 
Washington, the top government spokesman said. 
  But Hosokawa said it will take time before the government 
decides on its own policy to help resolve the North Korea issue. 
  Meanwhile, Takemura welcomed Russia's proposal to hold an 
international conference on Pyongyang's nuclear program, adding 
that Tokyo will seek further information about the proposal from 
Moscow. 
  Russia on Thursday proposed the holding of an international 
parley on the issue, saying it should be attended by Russia, 
China, the U.S., Japan, and North and South Korea, as well as 
representatives of the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) 
and the United Nations secretary general.

<F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS diplomatic correspondent Boris Krivoshey] </F>
  [Text] Moscow, 24 Mar -- The situation surrounding the 
problem of the DPRK's participation in the nuclear 
nonproliferation treaty (NPT) is prompting growing anxiety and 
alarm. Acting on the basis of its firm, consistent adherence to 
the NPT and its determination to prevent a center of tension -- 
especially nuclear -- emerging on its borders, Russia is in 
favor of a comprehensive settlement to the situation, says a 
Russian Foreign Ministry statement, with which Grigoriy Karasin, 
director of the Information and Press Department of the Russian 
Ministry of Foreign Affairs, acquainted journalists at a 
briefing today. 
  Russia is prepared, the document observes, to support the 
resolution now under discussion in the UN Security Council 
appealing to the DPRK to meet its commitments to the IAEA 
[International Atomic Energy Agency] under the NPT. 
  Taking account of the fact that the talks have not been 
crowned with success, we regard as inadequate attempts to tackle 
the problem within a bilateral framework. We propose using a 
multilateral approach, which could be centered on an 
international conference attended by Russia, China, the United 
States, Japan, the DPRK, the ROK, and representatives of the UN 
secretary general and the IAEA director general, the Russian 
Foreign Ministry statement says. 
  We are certain, the Russian foreign policy department 
stresses, that only such an approach will enable us to find 
mutually acceptable, balanced solutions, which will ensure that 
the nuclear nonproliferation regime is strengthened and 
simultaneously prevent the situation from slipping into 
confrontation.

  [Text] Seoul, March 25 (YONHAP) -- South Korea opted to 
deal with the North Korean nuclear issue at the United Nations 
Friday, saying "thanks but no thanks" to a Russian proposal for 
an eight-party conference. 
  "Russia's proposal for an eight-party conference is part of 
the efforts to solve the North Korean nuclear problem through 
dialogue. We note the intentions behind it," a Foreign Ministry 
official said in a commentary. 
  "In solving the North Korean nuclear problem, efforts at the 
U.N. Security Council are important at this moment. The issue 
of an eight-party conference requires careful consideration by 
the United States, Japan and other involved nations," he said. 
  Russia's proposal invites participation by South and North 
Korea, the United States, Japan, China and Russia along with the 
United Nations and the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA). 
  Seoul's reaction apparently reflects its reluctance to place 
Korean issues on the international table, although it seeks 
global coordination on the nuclear dispute. It has also chosen 
to rely on the South Korean-U.S. alliance at the moment instead 
of a multilateral arrangement. 
  Ministry officials said they were notified in advance of 
Moscow's proposal on Thursday afternoon. 
  Meanwhile, the officials welcomed Moscow's commitment to 
support the Security Council resolution on North Korea.

<F P=106> [Report by Cha Man-sun from Vienna] </F>
  [Text] The Russian Government's proposal for an eight-party 
conference to discuss the North Korean nuclear issue has been 
reportedly regarded as a strategy to strengthen its position in 
the international community. It is also possible that North 
Korea will use the proposal for propaganda purposes and to delay 
the settlement of the nuclear issue. 
  A relevant high-level official of the International Atomic 
Energy Agency [IAEA] pointed out that Russia should not overlook 
the fact that the UN Security Council is now discussing the 
North Korean nuclear issue, even though its proposal is an 
attempt to resolve the nuclear issue internationally and 
politically. In addition, he stressed that problems may arise 
in the positions of the UN Security Council and the IAEA, which 
have made efforts for nuclear nonproliferation throughout the 
world.

  [Text] Beijing, March 26 (AFP)--China said Saturday [26 
March] that it will study a Russian proposal for an 
international conference on the nuclear crisis in North Korea. 
  "We have taken note of Russia's proposal, and we will study 
it," a Chinese foreign ministry spokesman said by telephone. 
  Moscow had proposed an international conference Thursday to 
try to find a solution to the nuclear impasse in North Korea. 
Pyongyang rejected a complete inspection of its suspect nuclear 
sites by the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA). 
  The conference would bring together the two Koreas, China, 
Japan, the United States and Russia and delegates from the 
United Nations and the IAEA. The countries concerned reacted 
rather coolly to the proposal on Friday. 
  China, one of the five permanent members of the UN Security 
Council, continues to oppose international sanctions against its 
communist ally, but Western diplomats at the United Nations said 
Friday that Beijing might sign a declaration on North Korea 
which would not include sanctions. 
  South Korean President Kim Young-Sam was expected to arrive 
in China Saturday for a five-day visit during which he will ask 
his hosts to help get North Korea to accept inspections of its 
nuclear installations and to reopen its dialogue with South 
Korea.

<F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS special correspondent Aleksey Agureyev, </F>
UKRINFORM correspondent Aleksey Petrunya] 
  [Text] Kiev March 21 TASS -- Beginning May 30, 1994 Ukraine 
will no longer be a target for American strategic missiles, 
according to the agreements signed by the United States, Russia 
and Britain, ITAR-TASS and UKRINFORM learnt from well informed 
sources. 
  The sources said that this topic was discussed at the 
meeting 
between Ukrainian President Leonid Kravchuk and visiting U.S. 
Secretary of Defence William Perry which was held behind the 
closed doors. The major leitmotif of the talks was the 
implementation of the U.S.-Russian-Ukrainian agreement signed in 
Moscow in January 1994, as well as the agreements reached during 
the recent U.S.- Ukrainian summit meeting in Washington. They 
call for Ukraine's "denucliarisation" and providing it with 
compensations and security guarantees. 
  The second most important issue is cooperation between 
Ukraine and the United States within the programmes of economic 
cooperation and defence conversion. The U.S. will provide 
financial assistance to Ukraine to finance the conversion of its 
defence industry and build housing for the demobilised military. 
  Kravchuk stressed that Ukraine is unswervingly observing its 
obligations under the three-party agreement -- it has sent the 
second train full of nuclear warheads to Russia. 
  Perry stressed that relations between Ukraine and the United 
States are strategically important. He and Ukrainian Defence 
Minister Vitaliy Radetskyy who also attended the talks signed an 
agreement under which Ukraine will be granted 50 million dollars 
in addition to 135 million it is to receive under the Strategic 
Arms Reduction Treaty. The means will be used to finance the 
dismantlement of SS-24 missiles. 
  Radetskyy welcomed the U.S.-Russian-Ukrainian agreement as a 
"historic move and a way-out of the nuclear deadlock." "This 
step and the ratification by Ukraine of the START-1 Treaty and 
the Lisbon Protocol as a nuclear-free state virtually removes 
all juridical and other barriers for Ukraine's joining the 
Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty," he said. 
  At the same time, Radetskyy said that "the fulfillment of 
obligations assumed in nuclear disarmament is a costly process." 
He stressed the importance of U.S. assistance for carrying out 
disarmament and solving social problems facing the military. 
  "We have also reached full understanding on issues 
concerning 
the Partnership for Peace programme. We understand that 
Ukraine's future aims at full accession to European structures," 
Radetskyy said. 
  The sides also discussed cooperation in space exploration. 
The talks were attended by U.S. Ambassador to Ukraine William 
Miller.

relating to supplying Russian cryogenic rocket engines to India. 
According to the new agreement, Russia will deliver to India 
seven flying and two simulator booster units. The agreement on 
this was drawn up taking account of Russian legislation 
pertaining to export of rocket technology. The new document was 
signed in place of the 1991 agreement, which provided for 
supplying to India two booster units, transfer of technology for 
manufacturing them, and training of Indian specialists.

  [Text] Brussels, March 22, RIA -- According to a diplomatic 
source in the Eurocommission, the unexpected opposition of 
France at the bilateral consultations with Russia on the 
delivery of enriched uranium to the European market might block 
the signing of the agreement on Russo-EU partnership and 
cooperation. 
  Previously, the EU delegation demanded that the imports of 
unenriched uranium from Russia should be kept back, which 
hindered the talks. But at the last week's meeting in Paris the 
French delegation stated that the deliveries of Russian 
unenriched uranium were not the problem. Instead, France 
suggested, Russia's quotas for the delivery of enriched uranium 
should be halved. 
  A diplomat working with the Eurocommission said that if 
Russia accepted this proposal, this would create panic among the 
users of Russian uranium in Germany, Britain, Belgium and some 
other EU countries, which opted for priority development of 
nuclear engineering. The protectionist attitude of France put 
in question the signing of a multilateral agreement with the 
European Energy Charter, already signed by Russia, France and 
the EU.

  [Text] Manama, March 20 (AFP) - UN experts charged with 
eliminating President Saddam Husayn's chemical weapons program 
left Bahrain Sunday for a one-week inspection mission to Iraq, 
UN officials here said. 
  A five-member team led by American Gerald Brubaker was to 
take air samples from the former chemical weapons complex at 
al-Muthanna, west of the capital Baghdad, to search for the 
possible presence of chemical agents. 
  Iraq's chemical weapons were assembled at the site and most 
of them have since been destroyed. 
  A UN chemical weapons expert, Cees Wolterbreek of the 
Netherlands, said in December that he was "99 percent" certain 
that Iraq's chemical arsenal had been destroyed except for a few 
weapons and munitions. 
  The head of the UN Special Commission on disarming Iraq, 
Rolf 
Ekeus of Sweden, said on February 1 that he was still not 
completely satisfied with Iraq's answers about its chemical 
program. 
  The chemical team will be the first to visit Iraq since the 
UN Security Council decided Friday to continue sanctions against 
Baghdad which were imposed after the August 1990 invasion of 
Kuwait. 
  For the first time the council members could not agree on an 
assessment of Iraq's compliance with disarmament resolutions 
ending the 1991 Gulf war. 
  Russia, France, China and Brazil asked the council to 
recognize Iraqi "progress" toward disarmament but the United 
States and Britain rejected the request.

<F P=106> [Vaclav Proks report: "Ukrainian Power Plants Need Skoda </F>
Nuclear Engineering Products"] 
  [Text] The representatives of the Skoda Jaderne 
strojirenstvi (Skoda Nuclear Engineering) company recently 
signed a contract to deliver to Ukraine the first major shipment 
worth more than 60 million korunas. The draft contract also 
deals with the security of the payment. The product concerned 
is compact containers for spent fuel pools at the Rivne nuclear 
power plant. According to the company director, Vaclav 
Lobovsky, Ukraine has expressed an interest in purchasing $150 
million worth of nuclear equipment from Skoda Jaderne 
strojirenstvi over the next five to eight years. Cooperation is 
subject to the complex solution to the problem of payments. 
According to Lobovsky, there is the possibility of barter -- 
the trade for Ukrainian electricity or perhaps some other goods. 
  "Ukraine is trying to reduce its undesirable dependence on 
Russian monopoly suppliers, whose products allegedly are not of 
as high quality as ours. Cost advantages are losing 
attractiveness," Lobovsky claims. 
  Ukraine has the largest number of AVER 1000 [Water-Moderated 
Water-Cooled Power Reactor] reactors (10 in operation and four 
under construction). Only nuclear power plants are economically 
capable of producing electric power in Ukraine. Skoda Jaderne 
strojirenstvi introduced itself already in November by 
successfully completing a one-year test run at the Ukrainian 
power plant of its own modernized inching drive [krokovy pohon] 
for the reactor, in which even the Russians expressed interest. 
  Ukraine is now beginning to replace its outdated control and 
security systems. Ukrainian nuclear power plants are therefore 
most interested in Skoda's inching drives including the 
electronics, compact grids [kompaktni mrize], hermetic cable 
bushing, and also maintenance inspections, which Skoda allegedly 
offers at a price 10 times lower than Siemens, for instance. 
Ukraine is also deciding now from whom to purchase spent fuel 
containers. Skoda Jaderne strojirenstvi is not without chances. 
So far, it has been producing them under a German license, but 
as early as September it will introduce its own container 
prototype, which could become, according to Lobovsky, the most 
promising product of Skoda Plzen.

<F P=106> [Report by V. Vasou] </F>
  [Excerpts] The saga of the Nigerian Boeing, stranded at 
Larnaca Airport for six days loaded with 23 tons of arms, has 
ended well. The arms were transferred from the Boeing to a 
British plane yesterday. Both planes then left Larnaca Airport. 
  The Nigerian plane [as published] arrived in Larnaca from 
Amman yesterday at 1600 and the transfer of arms began around an 
hour later. The transfer was carried out by special forklifts 
sent from Israel and by workers of the company representing the 
Nigerian plane in Cyprus. 
  Larnaca Airport Director Andreas Papathomas told I SIMERINI 
that the airport's management made forklifts and carriages 
available to carry 10 big cases of arms. All the cases were 
covered with black nylon. 
  During the transfer, which took three hours, police took 
very 
strict security measures. Civil Aviation Department Director 
Mikhail Irodhotou was at the airport. The Nigerian plane was 
later given permission to depart on three engines for Tel Aviv, 
where it will be repaired. [passage omitted on background 
information] 
  [Just below the report, I SIMERINI publishes a photocopy of 
what is described as a "secret report" listing the cargo of the

  [Text] Disgruntled South African nuclear-and rocket 
scientists are threatening to expose closely guarded secrets 
about the country's arms programme unless they are paid 
R[Rand]4.5-million in retrenchment benefits. 
  A spokesman claiming to represent 16 scientists admitted 
this 
week the threat amounted to blackmail. 
  "We want a settlement but negotiation has failed and we 
don't 
want to have to take this to the industrial court. Our 
disclosures will prove embarrassing for Armscor [Armaments 
Corporation of South Africa], Denel (an off-shoot of Armscor) 
and the Nationalist government," he warned. 
  The group has unreleased details about South Africa's past 
co-operation with Israel on missile technology. Some of this 
challenges claims by President F.W. de Klerk last year that he 
had come clean on the country's nuclear story. 
  The 16 scientists are preparing an appeal to the industrial 
court in which they are demanding two years' salaries and 
benefits from Denel. 
  They were retrenched with two months' notice from Advena, a 
Denel subsidiary, on April 15 last year. They claim they were 
promised another two year's work. 
  The spokesman, who asked not to be named at present, said 
their firsthand information would identify sources of 
specialised equipment for nuclear bombs in the United Kingdom, 
France and Germany. 
  He also claimed Israel supplied rock technology and details 
of a process which transformed a satellite launcher into a 
nuclear ballistic missile. 
  And in a move which could realise the arms industry's 
greatest fear -- nuclear weapons scientists selling secrets to 
rogue nations or terrorists -- the spokesman said the group 
would construct bombs for anyone, if their salaries were 
guaranteed. 
  When Mr. de Klerk announced the destruction of South 
Africa's 
nuclear capability a year ago, he was adamant that no foreign 
help was used in the weapons' programme. But he made no mention 
of missile delivery capability. 
  Now the spokesman for the maverick scientists claims South 
Africa's defunct space programme was originally intended to use 
a clone of the Israeli Jericho II two-stage solid fuel missile 
to deliver nuclear weapons. 
  Two all-terrain mobile launchers were built and tested at 
Armscor's proving group at Advena in 1988 and 1989. They were 
never used. The missile, last codenamed RSA3, was only fired in 
static tests. 
  The spokesman said more than 200 South Africans visited 
Israel covertly and worked on the missile programme between 1989 
and 1992. 
  In a multi-million rand deal, Israel had sold South Africa a 
system of explosives that could stop the missile in mid-flight 
at a predetermined point, allowing it to fall on to a target 
city with an accuracy of less than one kilometre. 
  In October 1989, publicly expressed concerns by U.S. 
officials, including President George Bush, about Israeli and 
South African collaboration on a medium-range nuclear missile 
were denied by both countries. 
  The spokesman said that after the initial 18-kiloton (18,000 
tons of TNT) "dirty" bombs were completed, development of more 
powerful nuclear weapons continued in secret at SADF (South 
African Defense Force] insistence until late 1989 when Mr. de 
Klerk ordered that the programme be stopped. 
  These more powerful nuclear weapons included thermo-nuclear 
hydrogen bombs. 
  "What is the deterrent value of a 20-kiloton bomb when your 
enemy is threatening you with a 100-kiloton bomb?" the scientist 
asked. 
  The spokesman, who identified himself as a supporter of the 
right wing, said: "Some of us and many in the SADF [South 
African Defense Force] strongly believed that a couple of bombs 
should have been held back and kept in white hands." 
  The spokesman said: "I am not ashamed of what we did, but I 
cannot get a job. We are treated like outcasts. We are South 
Africa's nuclear casualties." 
  He had applied for 50 jobs and five of the rest of the group 
were unemployed. 
  The international implications of the scientists' threats 
are 
severe. Revealing suppliers would tarnish South Africa's 
credibility in the secrecy-obsessed international arms market 
and cause controversy in the countries involved. 
  The involvement of South African expertise in outlaw weapons 
programme would raise great international concern and possible 
conflict with the International Atomic Energy Agency, which has 
overseen South Africa's nuclear rehabilitation. 
  A Denel spokesman confirmed yesterday that 16 employees were 
contesting termination of their service. Negotiations had 
failed because of their "unfounded and unreasonable claims and 
expectations". 
  Intimidation through the media left Denel disillussioned at 
the conduct of people "with high technology standing for whom 
Denel has only the highest regard and sympathy," the spokesman 
said.

  [Text] Johannesburg March 27 SAPA -- Any "disgruntled 
nuclear and rocket scientist," who disclosed information about 
South Africa's nuclear weapons program, would be liable to 
charges under legislation preventing the proliferation of 
weapons of mass destruction, Armscor [Armaments Corporation of 
South Africa] said in a statement on Sunday. 
  Armscor was responding to a Sunday newspaper report which 
said nuclear scientists in a salary dispute with Armscor had 
threatened to reveal as yet undisclosed information about South 
Africa's past cooperation with Israel. 
  The report said the 16 scientists charged that they had been 
promised two years' employment with local armament manufacturer 
Denel, but were retrenched with only two months' notice. 
  Reacting to these allegations, Armscor said the 16 former 
employees only had limited know-how of nuclear devices. Armscor 
reaffirmed there was no international cooperation on the 
development and manufacture of South Africa's nuclear devices. 
  The statement said Armscor also endorsed the principles of 
the international non-proliferations bodies on not disclosing 
information which could lead to the proliferation of nuclear 
weapons.

<F P=106> [Report by Stephanie Bothma] </F>
  [Text] Pretoria -- The Transvaal Supreme Court has placed a 
gagging order on former Armscor [Armaments Corporation of South 
Africa] nuclear and rocket scientists, preventing them 
disclosing details about the supply, export, import, manufacture 
or research of any armaments. 
  Armscor brought an urgent application against 16 former 
employees -- who were among 60 people retrenched last February 
when Armscor subsidiary Denel rationalised its Advena division. 
  The arms manufacturer argued in court that publication of 
arms secrets could seriouly damage SA's newly acquired standing 
in the international defence industry. 
  The move followed a report that the scientists had 
threatened 
to disclosed nuclear secrets unless they were paid R4.5m 
[million rands] in compensation by their former employer. The 
scientists admitted that their demands amounted to blackmail. 
  Judge TT Spoelstra prohibited the scientists from disclosing 
information to the media or unauthorised people about the 
obtaining, supplying, marketing, importing, exporting, 
development, manufacture, maintenance or repair of armaments by 
Armscor or its subsidiaries. 
  In an affidavit supporting the application, Armscor guided 
missile systems chief Gideon Smith said all the scientists had 
signed on oath of secrecy. 
  Armscor's mission to secure SA's armament needs as 
effectively and economicallly as possible meant that technology, 
knowledge, material and equipment had to be obtained from 
abroad. All dealings with overseas countries or companies were 
extremely sensitive and secrecy received absolute priority, 
Smith said. 
  Last November SA had entered into an agreement with the U.S. 
on the restriction of missile-related export and import, 
including guarantees that secret information would not be 
disclosed. Adherence to this agreement would result in the U.S. 
recommending SA's admittance as a member of the Missile 
Technology Control Regime [MTCR]. 
  "To be accepted as a member of the MTCR would be beneficial 
to Armscor and SA. Armscor would have access to technology and 
foreign markets currently not available to it. Should sensitive 
information be made available, SA's chances of being admitted 
would be very poor." 
  Smith said that on November 11, four scientists, Christiaan 
du Plooy, Eldrid Fick, Klaus Muller and Jan Frederik Combrink, 
had informed Denel about a potential labour dispute. They had 
demanded re-employment or further compensation, a demand 
rejected by Denel a month later. 
  Since then, nothing had been heard from the scientists until 
last Sunday, when a newspaper article appeared headlined 
"Nuclear Scientists Threaten To Tell All." 
  Smith said the report had sparked immediate inquiries from 
Switzerland and several other countries, which had been upset 
and worried by the media reports. 
  It had been reported that the scientists were prepared to 
accept employment from anyone who could guarantee their 
salaries. If they received employment as a result of the 
publicity, sensitive information could be passed on their new 
employers and Armscor would lose control over such information, 
Smith said. 
  Armscor's attorney said only six of the 16 scientists cited 
in the court action had been aware of the newspaper report, 
while the others had indicated that they were prepared to honour 
their oath of secrecy. 
  The six who had been aware of the report were Du Plooy, 
Combrinck, Ester Maria Swart, Cornelius Appelgryn, Maarten 
Pretorius and Jurie Heydenrich. 
  The scientists had 14 days to oppose the application and 
have 
the order amended or set aside, the judge ordered.

<F P=106> ["hll" report: "SPD Wants to Be 'Protective Power'"] </F>
  [Text] Bonn, 18 March -- In their draft of a government 
program, which was presented on Friday [18 March], the Social 
Democrats present themselves as a "strong protective power" for 
the social interests of families and for those at a material 
disadvantage, in particular in eastern Germany. In addition, 
they announce that they will act against disturbances of 
peaceful coexistence with "determination and consistency." 
  In order to combat organized crime, the Social Democratic 
Party of Germany [SPD] wants to have assets impounded if there 
"is the urgent and justified suspicion that they come from 
serious crime or are to be used for such crimes, unless the 
owner proves the opposite." If all other methods fail, the 
authorities "must have the right to mount microphones in 
apartments and to record conversations," which, however, is to 
be linked with strict preconditions. 
  The SPD also wants to "strengthen the presence of police in 
streets and squares." Combating right-wing extremism as well as 
the integration of foreigners are cited as focal issues. 
  Regarding energy policy, the draft program sticks to the 
goal 
of opting out of nuclear energy, but it does not give a schedule 
for it: "We want to set a course toward opting out of nuclear 
energy by replacing the nuclear law with a further developed law 
on opting out of nuclear energy." Just as the current coalition 
government, the SPD wants to reduce the emission of carbon 
dioxide by one-fourth by the year 2005. German hard coal and 
brown coal are to be used as ongoing energy supplies and the use 
of hard coal is to be financially secured also beyond the year 
2000. 
  As for foreign policy, Germany's co-responsibility for 
worldwide problems is stressed under the keyword "partnership 
for development and peace." The draft notes: "No Bundeswehr 
participation in wars" but only in peacekeeping and humanitarian 
missions. It demands "restrictive European arms export 
controls." Europe must become an "environmental and social 
union." 
  The government program will be finally adopted by the SPD 
congress in Halle on 22 June. The authors of the draft, the 
size of which has doubled compared with earlier versions, are 
convinced that the majority of the party agrees with their 
statements.

  [Text] Beijing, March 29 (YONHAP) -- China expressed 
unprecedentedly deep concern over the situation on the Korean 
peninsula at the summit and foreign ministers' meetings with 
South Korea during President Kim Yong-sam's visit, a highly 
placed source close to the meetings said Tuesday. 
  "Chinese Foreign Minister Qian Qichen told his South Korean 
counterpart Han Sung-chu that if the international community 
applied pressure on North Korea, then North Korea would have no 
choice but to take military action," the source said. 
  Qian was quoted as stressing China's belief that the 
situation should not be allowed to deteriorate and that dialogue 
among the countries concerned must continue. 
  Qian reportedly admitted that China would be put in an 
awkward position if North Korea were slapped with economic 
sanctions through a United Nations Security Council resolution. 
  The official quoted Qian as saying, "China does not want to 
see a UN observation party deployed at the Chinese border with 
North Korea to monitor whether economic sanctions on North Korea 
are being implemented." 
  Qian, adding that such action might trigger an exodus of 
North Koreans into China as well as compel North Korea into 
provoking a war, suggested that China would oppose economic 
sanctions against Pyongyang, the official said. 
  Meanwhile, Chinese President Jiang Zemin stressed at his 
summit with South Korean President Kim Yong-sam the "four-party, 
three-channel" solution -- that is, resolution through three 
channels of talks between South and North Korea, between North 
Korea and the United States, and between North Korea and the 
International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA). 
  Jiang told South Korean journalists that if tension 
continued 
to mount on the Korean peninsula, the first to suffer would be 
the Korean people.

  [Text] Mr. Yi Pok-hon (33, from Sinam 1-tong, Taegu), who 
was arrested on 8 March by the Agency for National Security 
Planning [NSP] on espionage charges and who was transferred to 
the prosecutor's office on 25 March, stated while being 
investigated: "It seems North Korea has succeeded in 
manufacturing nuclear bombs." This draws our attention as there 
is current suspicion regarding North Korea's nuclear weapons 
development. 
  The NSP disclosed this on 26 March when it transferred Mr. 
Yi 
Pok-hon to the prosecutor's office. Since he left the country 
in 1990, Mr. Yi has been engaged in spy activities overseas, in 
regions such as Southeast Asia, the Middle East, Africa, and 
China. Mr. Yi reportedly stated during the NSP investigation: 
When I went to North Korea in March 1993, a Mr. Ho, a senior 
North Korean Workers' Party cadre, asked me directly if it would 
be tactically advantageous to North Korea to announce openly its 
possession of a nuclear bomb or would it be better to keep it 
secret after the withdrawal from the Nuclear Nonproliferation 
Treaty. 
  The NSP also disclosed that Mr. Yi said that Ho had told him 
that North Korea intends to deliver an atomic bomb, whose 
performance had not been tested, to a certain country in the 
Middle East sometime during 1994.

  [Text] On 28 March, Japanese SANKEI SHIMBUN published a 
report from Washington that (Neil Livingston,) an American 
expert in studies of terrorism, warned that there is a 
possibility that North Korea, when it invades the ROK again, 
will wage a harassing operation in the rear area of the ROK with 
chemical weapons which it has already hidden in the ROK. 
  According to SANKEI SHIMBUN, (Livingston) alleged this in an 
article entitled, "The Dangerous Area," contributed to a recent 
issue of the publication "Sea Power," published by the Navy 
League, an organization supported by the U.S. Navy. 
  Stressing that the North Korean leadership which triggered a 
war on the Korean peninsula on 25 June 40 years ago is the Kim 
Il-song system, (Livingston) said that "the ROK is very 
vulnerable to North Korean attack, and therefore, it is very 
clear that Seoul, the fourth largest city in the world 
approximately 60 km away from the Military Demarcation Line 
[MDL], will undergo enormous damages at the initial stage, 
whatever type of war may break out there in the future." 
  He estimated that if the ROK Army fails to check the North 
Korean Army midway, the North Korean fighters will reach Seoul 
within five minutes and tanks will pressure Seoul in its 
outskirts within an hour. 
  In particular, he assumed that North Korea has stored an 
enormous quantity of chemical weapons in the areas near MDL in 
the North Korean side of the Armistice Line, and will likely 
blow off the poison gas to South Korea in an emergency by taking 
advantage of weather conditions, including wind, and that some 
of these chemical weapons might have already been hidden in 
secret places in Seoul or other areas of the ROK. 
  SANKEI SHIMBUN wrote that this suggests the possibility that 
armed spies, who will commit a terrorist act with chemical 
weapons at the directive from Pyongyang, might have already 
infiltrated into Seoul, or the forces that blindly follow North 
Korea might already possess these weapons.

  [Text] Pyongyang, April 5 (KCNA) -- The Kim Yong-sam group 
must ponder over the consequences to be entailed by its 
development of nuclear weapons stepped up behind the facade of a 
nuclear row against the fellow countrymen and remove its heavy 
water reactor and multi-purpose research reactor before it is 
too late, says a MINJU CHOSON analyst today. 
  The news analyst goes on: 
  The puppets' nuclear row is aimed at hurling abuses and 
slanders at the DPRK to create the impression that its reactors 
are being used to develop nuclear weapons. However, it is the 
pressurized heavy water reactor (PHWR) in Wolsong and the 
multi-purpose research reactor in Taedok, South Korea, not the 
graphite moderated reactor in the North, that are actually being 
used to develop nuclear weapons on the Korean peninsula. 
  The South Korean puppets has stockpiled spent nuclear fuel 
containing more than ten tons of plutonium obtained through the 
PHWR and the multi-purpose research reactor they put into 
operation for the purpose of development of nuclear weapons. It 
will increase to twenty-four tons by the year 2000. 
  Referring to the aim sought by the Kim Yong-sam group in 
raising a hue and cry over the fictitious "North's nuclear 
problem," the analyst says: 
  The puppets seek in this to create the impression that the 
North is developing nuclear weapons and thus mislead public 
opinion and find an excuse for keeping the U.S. troops and 
nuclear weapons in South Korea. At the same time, they intend 
to use their nuclear row as a smokescreen for covering up their 
own nuclear arms development, while pretending to have any 
concern for a solution of the nuclear issue. 
  If they are really interested in a solution of the nuclear 
issue, they must stop taking issue with the fellow countrymen in 
a far-fetched manner and demand the withdrawal of U.S. nuclear 
weapons from South Korea. And they must discontinue their 
nuclear row, immediately give up their own nuclear arms 
development and prove this through the elimination of the PHWR 
in Wolsong and the multi-purpose research reactor in Taedok.

<F P=106> [By Kim Cha-su from Tokyo] </F>
  [Text] A controversy has arisen over the deadline for 
further inspections of North Korean nuclear facilities by the 
International Atomic Energy Agency [IAEA]. A report to the UN 
Security Council by IAEA Director General Hans Blix says that 
further inspections of the North Korean nuclear facilities must 
be conducted within six weeks. Therefore, some people say that 
the deadline should be the end of April, and others say it 
should be mid-May. 
  An ROK Foreign Ministry official, who is now visiting Japan, 
said on 3 April that this issue must be clarified because the 
deadline for further inspections would be an important factor 
for the UN Security Council's next step. 
  The Security Council president's statement indirectly 
mentioned the deadline, saying: "The Council invites the 
director general of the IAEA to report further to the Security 
Council on the question of completion of the inspection 
activities agreed between the IAEA and the DPRK on 15 February 
1994, when the director general is scheduled to report on the 
follow-up inspections required to maintain continuity of 
safeguards, as noted in the director general's report to the 
council." 
  However, when presenting a report to the Security Council on 
24 March, Director General Blix said that to ensure the 
continuity of nuclear safeguards, further inspections of not 
only the facilities which were not inspected during the 
inspection period ending 15 February but the facilities which 
were inspected during the same period must be conducted within 
six weeks. 
  The Foreign Ministry official views that "within six weeks" 
must be interpreted to be six weeks from 15 February, when the 
first round of inspections were completed.

  [Text] Seoul, March 30 (YONHAP) -- Vice Foreign Minister 
Hong Sun-yong suggested Tuesday the imposition of phased 
sanctions on North Korea to solve the nuclear problem, starting 
with a cutoff of all aid and even exchanges on peaceful use of 
atomic power. 
  "We have to press North Korea by stages in order to solve 
the 
nuclear problem," Hong told a conference of the ruling camp's 
chapter leaders. 
  "We will continue to show our efforts for a peaceful 
resolution in order to secure Chinese participation, but phased 
sanctions are inevitable after a statement by the UN Security 
Council president," he said. 
  The council initially planned on adopting a resolution 
demanding that Pyongyang allow inspection of its suspected 
facilities, but has backed away to a presidential statement in 
the face of Chinese opposition. 
  The statement is likely to be issued this week or next week. 
  Possible sanctions could start with a halt to technical 
assistance and exchanges on peaceful use of atomic energy, then 
move to a ban on all exchanges of strategic materials, a ban on 
money transfers or trade in raw materials, and finally to a full 
embargo, Hong said. 
  "The North Korean economy would be fatally wounded even if 
just 5 to 10 percent of its crude oil supply or money from 
Chochongnyon in Japan was embargoed," the vice foreign minister 
said. 
  Chochongnyon is an association of pro-North Korea residents 
operating in Japan. 
  North Korean-U.S. diplomatic normalization would take 
considerable time because it requires not only an international 
consensus but an understanding of bilateral issues including 
American POWs, missile export controls and human rights, said 
Hong. 
  On the results of President Kim Yong-sam's visit to China, 
Hong said he was under the impression that Beijing had 
emphasized its commitment to a peaceful solution rather than 
sanctions. 
  "It seems to indicate China is unwilling to provoke North 
Korea," he said.

  [Text] Tokyo, April 7 KYODO -- A senior Foreign Ministry 
official Thursday [7 April] denied suspicion by some countries 
that Japan may arm with nuclear weapons now that it has launched 
the new plutonium-fueled fast breeder reactor "Monju," which 
produces more plutonium than it uses. 
  "Japan has properly accepted (international) nuclear 
inspections," said the official on the condition of anonymity. 
"Nuclear armament will not benefit Japan...I can understand some 
countries think Japan will arm with nuclear weapons if North 
Korea does so." 
  The official said Japan must clear the suspicion on such 
occasions as summit meetings and foreign ministerial meetings 
with every country. 
  Earlier the same day, North Korea accused Japan of promoting 
a plan to become a nuclear power, according to the official 
KOREAN CENTRAL NEWS AGENCY (KCNA). 
  "The commissioning of Monju fully reveals Japan's 
undisguised 
scheme to become a nuclear power by securing a large quantity of 
plutonium for itself and manufacturing nuclear weapons any 
moment," the KCNA said. 
  Monju reached criticality Tuesday morning in Tsuruga, Fukui 
Prefecture, on the Sea of Japan coast. Criticality is the point 
at which the reaction in the reactor's fissionable material is 
sufficient to sustain a chain reaction. 
  Some environmentalists have criticized the operation of 
Monju 
partly because plutonium can be used to produce nuclear weapons.

  [Text] Tokyo, April 2 KYODO -- A long-delayed atomic 
reactor project by a government-financed power development 
company is expected to get under way in northern Japan in May, 
industry sources reported Saturday [2 April]. 
  The sources said the Electric Power Development Co. aims to 
reach agreement with the local fisheries organization on terms 
of the project which has been pending for the past 11 years. 
  The company plans to build an experimental light-water type 
reactor, known as the Advanced Thermal Converter Reactor (ATR), 
to start operations in the year 2003. 
  The reactor can be remodeled to consume plutonium as fuel, 
they said. 
  The sources said the company has to clear a major obstacle 
before the project is launched -- high construction costs 
inflated since the original plan was drawn up. 
  Construction costs, originally estimated at 396 billion yen, 
have inflated 20 to 30 percent in the past 11 years, making it 
inevitable for the company to review a cost sharing agreement 
reached with electric power companies, they said. 
  The company, a joint venture between the government and nine 
major electric power companies, is 66.6 percent owned by the 
government and 33.4 percent by power firms. 
  The original agreement reached between the two parties calls 
for the government and the power companies to shoulder one-third 
of the cost each, with the remainder contributed by the Electric 
Power Development Co. 
  The power companies, which have agreed to purchase 
electricity generated at the plant at 15 yen per kilowatt, said 
they will have to raise utility rates if the production cost 
rises above the agreed level. 
  They argue that the importance of the ATR as a facility to 
supply plutonium for fast breeder reactors has declined due to a 
worldwide glut of natural uranium, the sources said. 
  The Science and Technology Agency and the Power Reactor and 
Nuclear Fuel Development Corp. stressed the role to be played by 
the ATR as a system to consume plutonium. 
  The corporation has been experimenting on the use of 
plutonium with an ATR in Tsuruga, Fukui Prefecture, since 1979.

  [Text] Tsuruga, Fukui Pref., April 5 KYODO -- Japan's new 
plutonium-fueled fast breeder reactor "Monju" reached 
criticality Tuesday morning [5 April] in Tsuruga, Fukui 
Prefecture, on the Sea of Japan coast. 
  Criticality is the point at which the reaction in the 
reactor's fissionable material is sufficient to sustain a chain 
reaction. 
  It was attained at 10:01 A.M. when workers at the 
governmental Power Reactor and Nuclear Fuel Development Corp. 
(Donen) in Monju pulled the last of 19 control rods to a point 
just short of its total removal from the reactor. 
  Gradual removal of the last rod, at the center of the 
reactor, began in four stages from shortly before 9 A.M., 
allowing the reactor to reach criticality with it 70 percent 
removed. 
  The goal was achieved eight years and six months after 
construction of the plant got under way in October 1985 and 
after three postponements. 
  Start-up of the 600 billion yen plant was delayed for a 
third 
time last October because of a technical malfunction in fuel 
production facilities last July. 
  The reactor is fueled by a mixture of plutonium oxide and 
uranium oxide. 
  Japan has made fast breeder reactors, which produce more 
fissionable material than they consume, a cornerstone of its 
nuclear power policy. 
  The power industry intends to have two fully operational 
fast 
breeder reactors built by 2003. 
  The Monju reactor has the capacity to produce 280,000 
kilowatts of electricity. 
  The Monju core contains a total of 1.4 tons of reactor-grade 
plutonium and 4.5 tons of depleted uranium. 
  Monju represents the third stage in the government's plan to 
develop a fast breeder reactor, beginning with an earlier 
experimental reactor "Joyo" which reached criticality in 1977 in 
Oarai, Ibaraki Prefecture. 
  Scientists say Monju-style reactors use fuel 60 times more 
efficiently than conventional uranium reactors. 
  One of the features of Monju is its use of liquid sodium 
coolant which has a high heat conducting capacity. 
  The reactor is scheduled to go on line supplying electricity 
from April 1995 and become a commercially operating supplier by 
December the same year. 
  Several industrialized countries which were developing fast 
breeder reactors have shut down their projects, citing high 
costs and safety factors. 
  Some international critics say that since the Cold War is 
over, Japan should not rely on fast breeder reactors for energy 
self-sufficiency because they produce fuel that can be diverted 
to nuclear weapons. 
  Residents near the reactor are still fighting suits in the 
courts against Donen and the government urging a halt to the 
construction and running of the reactor. 
  But the power industry has welcomed the criticality of Monju 
as a step toward the commercialization of fast breeder reactors. 
  A meeting of the heads of nine of the nation's major power 
suppliers in January outlined plans for producing 6.6 million 
kilowatts of power from fast breeder reactors, the first of 
which would begin construction soon after 2000 in time for 
commercial operation by 2003. 
  A fully operational fast breeder reactor costs an estimated 
400 billion yen, about 1.5 times the cost of a light water 
reactor. 
  At present, some 30 percent of Japan's electricity is 
generated by 42 nuclear reactors throughout the country. 
  Japan by 2010 will be annually using some 50 tons of 
plutonium mixed with uranium for light-water reactors and about 
35 tons more for fast breeder reactors, according to the 
country's energy plan.

  [Text] Tokyo, April 6 KYODO -- The Ministry of 
International Trade and Industry (MITI) said Wednesday [6 April] 
there were 17 reported cases of problems and accidents involving 
Japan's nuclear power plants in fiscal 1993, down three from the 
previous fiscal year. 
  On average, the number of problems and accidents per plant 
in 
operation stood at a low of 0.3 for the year. There were 46 
nuclear power plants in operation in 1993. 
  The ministry's Agency of Natural Resources and Energy is 
required to report all serious incidents under the electricity 
enterprises act. 
  MITI also listed seven instances of less serious problems 
that are by law not required to be reported. 
  Breaking down serious accidents, agency officials said there 
were 10 cases in which reactors were shut down manually and 
seven instances in which damage was found during periodic 
reactor checks. 
  There were no reported automatic shutdowns, in which the 
emergency core cooling system shuts down the reactor, the most 
important safety mechanism to prevent nuclear accidents. 
  The officials also said operating rates for the nation's 
nuclear power plants averaged 75.4 percent in fiscal 1993 ended 
on March 31. 
  It was the 11th straight year the average operating rate 
topped the 70 percent mark.

  [Text] The U.S. imperialists dared [kamhaeng] to conduct a 
series of aerial espionages on the northern half of the 
Republic. According to military sources, an RC-135 strategic 
reconnaissance plane, which flew to the sky above South Korea 
from the U.S. imperialists' overseas base on 28 March, made a 
sortie to the sky above the areas near the Military Demarcation 
Line [MDL] and ran wild in taking aerial photographs and 
electronic reconnaissance on the strategic centers [chollyakchok 
chungsimjidaedul] of the northern half of the Republic while 
making repeated shuttle flights between east and west. The 
strategic reconnaissance plane has conducted aerial espionage 
more than 10 times since the beginning of March. 
  Meanwhile, from around 17:00 [08:00 GMT] to 24:00 [15:00 
GMT] 
on 29 March, a U-2 high-altitude strategic reconnaissance plane 
made night flights in the skies above the areas adjacent to 
Oeyon Island, Yangpyong, and Yangyang and ran amok in aerial 
reconnaissance on the entire area of the northern half of the 
Republic. 
  On 9 and 15 March, three of the high-altitude strategic 
reconnaissance planes made 24-hour alternate flights around the 
sky above the areas near the MDL and were frenzied with aerial 
espionage. 
  Aerial espionage by the U.S. imperialists has been 
intensified concurrently with their full-scale military 
confrontation commotion [chonmyon kunsajok taekyol sodong] 
against us since 21 March, the date on which the third round of 
DPRK-U.S. talks had been scheduled. 
  On 24 March, the U.S. imperialists dared to conduct aerial 
espionage on the northern half of the Republic by deploying five 
RC-12's, four RV-1 Army tactical reconnaissance planes, two U-2 
high-altitude strategic reconnaissance planes, and two EH-60 
electronic-warfare helicopters day and night on the sky above 
South Korea. On 26 March, they also ran amok in aerial 
espionage on our side by flying seven RC-12 Army tactical 
reconnaissance planes on the sky above the areas near the MDL. 
  The frequency of such aerial espionage on the northern half 
of the Republic by the U.S. imperialists during the period from 
21 to 30 March totalled over 90 times. The total frequency in 
March amounted to 234 times, 40 more than that of February. 
  Various facts clearly show how the U.S. imperialist are 
running wild with blood-shot eyes in the preparatory maneuvers 
for a war of aggression against the northern half of the 
Republic.

  [Text] Tokyo, April 8 (YONHAP) -- North Korea is building 
missile launching sites along the Chinese border, the ASAHI 
SHIMBUN reported in a Seoul-datelined story on Friday [8 April]. 
  In an interview with the Japanese newspaper, former North 
Korean Army 1st Lt. Yim Yong-son, who defected to South Korea 
last September, said Pyongyang had selected areas along the 
Chinese border as missile launching sites, judging that an 
attacker would avoid these areas for fear of hitting China by 
accident, the report said. 
  Saying he was quoting fellow soldiers at an Army engineering 
unit engaged in construction of missile bases where he worked 
before defecting to Seoul, Yim said that although North Korea's 
missile launching sites are located along the eastern coastlines 
of North Hamgyong and Kangwon Provinces and Wonsan city, the 
Stalinist North recently started building additional sites along 
the Chinese border. 
  Some 5,000 people are working at such sites at Chunggangjin 
in Chagang Province and the job will be completed next year, the 
Japanese newspaper quoted Yim as saying. 
  "I heard that North Korea, presuming that the United States 
and South Korea would not attack missile sites along the Chinese 
border for fear of hitting China if war broke out, began 
constructing the sites along its Chinese border," he was quoted 
as saying.

Nations, told reporters after the UN Security Council adopted 
the president's statement on North Korea that, since North Korea 
has fulfilled its duties under agreements with the International 
Atomic Energy Agency [IAEA], it will not allow any kind of 
inspection by the IAEA from this point of time [hyon sijomeso

  Ambassador Pak Kil-yon insisted that the adoption of the UN 
Security Council president's statement will not help to resolve 
the nuclear issue and he stressed the need to resume high-level 
talks between North Korea and the United States, saying that 
only North Korean-U.S. negotiations will help in resolving the 
nuclear issue. 
  Meanwhile, a spokesman for the North Korean Ministry of 
Foreign Affairs reacted negatively [pujongjogin panung] to the 
Russian proposal for holding eight-party talks on the North 
Korean nuclear issue, expressing concerns about the possibility 
that it will complicate the issue.

<F P=106> ["DPRK FM Spokesman Urges United States To Cancel Deployment </F>
of Patriot in S. Korea"--KCNA headline] 
  [Text] Pyongyang, March 28 (KCNA) -- If the United States 
finally deploys new-type missiles, turning a deaf ear to our 
just demand for an immediate stop to the deployment of Patriot 
missiles in South Korea, it would entail grave consequences, 
said a spokesman for the Foreign Ministry of the Democratic 
People's Republic of Korea in a statement today, urging the 
United States to ponder over it. 
  The statement says: 
  Forty-eight Patriot missile launching pads and a more than 
800- men missile unit are moving to South Korea from Texas, the 
United States, on order from the U.S. President on March 21, and 
they will reportedly arrive in South Korea toward the end of 
April. This proves that, from the very beginning, the United 
States had no intention to solve the nuclear issue on the Korean 
peninsula through dialogue and negotiations but has used the 
"nuclear problem" as a means of isolating and stifling the DPRK. 
  We sternly denounce the U.S. shipment of Patriot missiles to 
South Korea as a deliberate act to openly break the agreed point 
of the DPRK-USA joint statement on refraining from nuclear 
threat to the other and push the situation on the Korean 
peninsula to the brink of war. 
  The United States is bringing Patriot missiles to South 
Korea, laying the blame for the collapse of the dialogue at the 
door of the DPRK. This is a deliberate, dangerous military 
action to make the military situation of the Korean peninsula 
all the more unstable and, further, cause another war. 
  Though the U.S. authorities are now claiming that the 
Patriot 
is a "defensive weapon," they cannot justify its deployment in 
South Korea with any pretext. 
  From the topographical point of view, the Patriot missile 
can 
be used for the purpose of strike at any place of the Korean 
peninsula, which is not large. It is known to everyone that its 
target can be changed by the kind of the warhead it is tipped 
with. The U.S. shipment of new-type Patriots in South Korea is 
nothing but an open aggressive act to threaten the DPRK 
militarily and make a forestalling strike at it. 
  The United States reveals its intention to keep hold on 
South 
Korea indefinitely as its forward base in the Far East and 
continue to play the role of the MP [military police] in this 
region by deploying the improved missiles. 
  The decision of the United States to deploy the new-type 
Patriot missiles in South Korea is an illegal act of wantonly 
violating the Korean Armistice Agreement and ignoring the 
armistice machine. 
  The armistice agreement clearly stipulates that military 
equipment and combat materiel shall not be introduced into the 
Korean peninsula. 
  In the past days, the United States shipped into South Korea 
nuclear arms and many other kinds of equipment of new types in a 
covert manner, fearful of the armistice agreement. This time, 
however, it openly declared the deployment of the new-type of 
Patriot missiles in South Korea and is forcing it in broad 
daylight. This shows that the U.S. authorities pay no heed to 
the armistice agreement and armistice machine, and they throw 
away any international commitments like a pair of worn-out shoes 
if it is to attain their aim. 
  It must not be overlooked that the South Korean authorities, 
wearing its own nuclear helmet under the U.S. "nuclear 
umbrella," officially asked for the deployment of the Patriot 
missiles, clinging to the coattails of outside forces as ever. 
This clearly shows that the South Korean authorities have 
joined the United States in the nuclear kickup to stifle the 
DPRK and that they are not interested at all in the 
implementation of the "joint declaration on the denuclearisation 
of the Korean peninsula." 
  The behaviour of the South Korean authorities makes it plain 
that they are more zealous in frustrating the DPRK-USA talks 
than in realising the exchange of special envoys. 
  The United States must immediately stop the deployment of 
the 
missiles posing a great threat to peace and security of the 
Korean peninsula and the Far East, and the South Korean 
authorities must discontinue at once their treacherous acts 
harming the fellow countrymen.

<F P=106> ["DPRK FM Spokesman on Russia's Proposal for Multilateral </F>
Negotiations"--KCNA headline] 
  [Text] Pyongyang, April 1 (KCNA) -- A spokesman for the 
Foreign Ministry of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea 
gave the following answer to a question put by KCNA today about 
the recent proposal of Russia for multilateral negotiations for 
a solution to the nuclear problem on the Korean peninsula: 
  The Russian Foreign Ministry in a recent statement proposed 
multilateral negotiations for dealing with the nuclear issue on 
the Korean peninsula. 
  We affirmatively estimate the efforts of Russia to find a 
solution through political negotiations, opposing "sanctions" 
and pressure. But we fear that the Russian proposal for 
multilateral negotiations might complicate the matter. 
  As for the nuclear issue on the Korean peninsula, it is a 
political and military problem which should be settled between 
the DPRK and the United States first of all in view of its cause 
and its nature. 
  The U.S. authorities themselves had already admitted this 
and 
responded to DPRK-U.S. talks. The United States published a 
joint statement with the DPRK, admitted the reasonableness of 
the DPRK's proposal for a package deal and agreed to immediate 
steps of simultaneous action. 
  But the solution of the nuclear issue on the Korean 
peninsula 
is ungergoing twists and turns, without progress yet, because 
the United States, after reaching an agreement at the 
negotiating table with the DPRK, arbitrarily reversed the agreed 
points, setting unreasonable preconditions outside the 
conference room. 
  It wholly depends on the attitude of the United States how 
the nuclear issue on the Korean peninsula would be settled in 
the future. 
  If Russia wants to contribute to the solution of the nuclear 
issue, it would be more suitable to the prevailing situation for 
it to exert its influence on the United States so that the 
latter may honestly implement the points of its agreement with 
the DPRK and observe the principle of impartiality, we think.

  [Text] The Central Committee of the South Korean National 
Democratic Front [SKNDF] on 30 March published a white paper 
revealing that the heavy water reactor in Wolsong and the 
multipurpose research reactor in Taedok are for nuclear 
development. 
  Saying that the Kim Yong-sam clique misled the public 
opinion by insisting that the experimental reactors of North 
Korea are for the development of nuclear weapons, so as to kick 
up anti-North smear campaign, the white paper pointed out that 
this is like an act of a thief turning on the victim with a club. 
  The white paper maintained that the reactors used for the 
development of nuclear weapons on the Korean peninsula are not 
the experimental reactor of North Korea, which has generating 
capacity of 5,000 kilowatts, but the heavy water reactor in 
Wolsong with 678,700 kilowatt and the multipurpose research 
reactor in Taedok with 30,000 kilowatt. 
  Based on accurate materials, the white paper expressed that 
the Wolsong heavy water reactor is a reactor for the development 
of nuclear weapons disguised as one for commercial use. It added 
that it is a plutonium-producing reactor, introduced for the 
development of nuclear weapons and not for commercial use, in 
view of its purpose and structure. The white paper disclosed 
that the Wolsong heavy water reactor disgorges a large amount of 
spent fuel containing high-level plutonium and is used directly 
for the development of nuclear weapons. 
  In addition, the white paper pointed out that the 
multipurpose research reactor complex is a reactor exclusively 
for nuclear arms development under the veil of research. The 
white paper exposed that the multipurpose research reactor is a 
reactor for the development of nuclear weapons set up in the 
eighties as an alternate project as the attempt to introduce it 
for the key role in the nuclear development in the seventies had 
failed. 
  The white paper revealed on the basis of the accurate 
materials that the multipurpose research reactor is not an 
experimental reactor with a peaceful purpose but for military 
use which is used as a diazole in the production of nuclear 
weapons, and said the problem lies on the fact it is closely 
linked with reprocessing facilities. 
  The white paper insists that all these facts prove that the 
Wolsong heavy water reactor and the multipurpose research 
reactor in Taedok are for the military use, and it is South 
Korea, not North Korea, which confronts the denuclearization of 
the Korean peninsula. 
  The white paper said that the South Korean authorities are 
openly claiming the reexamination of the joint declaration on 
the denuclearization of the Korean peninsula and eager to 
develop the nuclear weapons by openly calling for nuclear 
option. If this is not true, the white paper maintains, the 
South Korean authorities must give up the policy of nuclear arms 
development pushed ahead in accordance with the anti-North 
nuclear smear campaign, and declare the removal of the heavy 
water reactor and the multipurpose research reactor which are 
used for the production of nuclear weapons.

<F P=106> [Editorial: "`Team Spirit' &amp; Patriot Missiles"] </F>
  [Text] The joint U.S.-Korea military exercise Team Spirit 
is intended to maintain the defense capability of the Korean and 
American forces here against a possible North Korean attack. 
So, it was naturally expected that the two allies would conduct 
the annual military drill this year too. 
  However, Seoul and Washington canceled it as a concession in 
the nuclear negotiations between Pyongyang and South Korea, the 
United States and the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA). 
  Now that the hardline Stalinist state has failed to carry 
out 
its half of the bargain, this concession might be expected to be 
withdrawn. But Pyongyang is again threatening to pull out of 
the Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty (NPT) if the U.S. and South 
Korea resume the exercise, which Pyongyang calls a rehearsal for 
a nuclear war against the North. 
  China has also come out in support of the North Korean 
position. Although President Kim Yong-sam stated after his 
summit with his Chinese counterpart Jiang Zemin in Beijing that 
the two did not discuss Team Spirit and the deployment of 
Patriot anti-missile batteries in the South, Chinese officials 
made it clear China is as opposed to them as before. 
  A formal Seoul decision on the two matters is expected after 
President Kim's return home, as he promised before his departure 
for Japan and China a week ago. With the two presidents having 
called for a negotiated settlement of the North Korean nuclear 
problem through dialogue among the parties concerned, Kim is 
likely to weigh the further postponement of the military drill 
in expectation of a change in Pyongyang's nuclear stance. 
  It is our view that suspension of the Team Spirit drill 
needs 
to be considered, lest it provide an excuse for the North to 
translate its NPT pullout threat into action, leaving no room 
for a peaceful solution to the issue. Since Seoul and 
Washington have used Team Spirit as a bargaining chip in nuclear 
negotiations in the past, they may well decide to leave it as a 
card up their sleeves for use in the future. 
  On the other hand, Korea and the U.S. need to positively 
consider the deployment of Patriot missiles, as it is designed 
for defense against the North's Scud missiles. It is illogical 
and unreasonable for Pyongyang to voice its opposition to the 
Patriot deployment in the South, while it produces and develops 
offensive missiles. 
  In a nutshell, the suspension of Team Spirit is 
recommendable 
for the present in order to avoid the worst but the Patriot 
missiles are needed as a war deterrent to cope with the erratic 
and unpredictable North. 
  Our side's unlimited concessions at this point could rather 
encourage the defiant North to continue adventurism and 
brinkmanship that are in no one's interests.

  [Text] Seoul, April 4 (YONHAP) -- The Seoul government has 
tentatively decided to suspend the South Korea-U.S. joint 
military exercise Team Spirit until mid-May, the deadline for 
North Korea to allow further inspections by the International 
Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), informed sources said Monday. 
  The United Nations Security Council told North Korea to 
permit IAEA checks by the middle of May in a presidential 
statement issued March 31. 
  The government will hold a meeting of related ministers this 
week, after Foreign Minister Han Sung-chu returns from trips to 
the United States and Japan, to discuss Team Spirit's 
suspension, the sources said. A final decision on suspending the 
war games will be made at a South Korean-U.S. defense 
ministers' meeting. 
  U.S. Defense Secretary William Perry will visit Seoul on 
April 17 to discuss the North Korean problem and meet with his 
South Korean counterpart Yi Pyong-tae. 
  The South Korean Government is considering suspension of 
Team 
Spirit because it wants the North to respond positively to the 
Security Council president's statement. 
  If Pyongyang refuses to allow inspections by mid-May, 
however, Seoul may resume Team Spirit in late May or sometime in 
the second half of this year, the sources said. 
  Seoul also plans to allow deployment of Patriot missiles as 
scheduled since the Patriot is purely a defensive weapon.

<F P=106> [Report by Enrique Vidal] </F>
  [Text] Argentine Ambassador Arturo Osorio has said that 
Argentina will support Peru's bid to export radioisotopes 
produced at the Huarangal nuclear plant. He said this after 
visiting the modern facilities located some 33 km north of Lima. 
In the company of Peruvian Nuclear Energy Institute Director 
Conrado Seminario, Osorio made the following comments: 
  [Begin recording] Osorio: We have visited this 
nuclear plant and can appreciate its optimum level of 
efficiency, the high level of professional training, and their 
excellent skill in handling this delicate nuclear plant, which 
also represents a security issue for the world. It conforms to 
the strictest nuclear safety regulations and it is really 
marvelous. It is a great satisfaction for those of us who have 
worked together to build this nuclear power plant as it will 
enable us to continue our partnership -- from a commercial 
standpoint or through the reciprocal transfer of technology by 
means of this great work, which is perhaps the most important 
nuclear reactor in Latin America. 
  Unidentified reporter: Are you hinting at the 
possibility of entering into partnership to export? 
  Osorio: Yes, there that possibility. 
  Reporter: How could this be turned into something 
concrete, Mr. Ambassador? 
  Osorio: That is a subject for experts to address. 
I believe that once the authorities of both countries discuss 
things at technical level, we will perhaps have -- in the near 
future -- a positive [words indistinct]. [end recording] 
  That was Argentine Ambassador to Lima Arturo Osorio, after 
making a technical inspection of the Huarangal nuclear power 
plant and its 10-megawatt reactor accompanied by Conrado 
Seminario. The building of this plant, which will also produce 
radioisotopes used in medicine and in industry, has been 
possible thanks to the technical cooperation of Argentine 
experts. We should point out that 35 percent of the electrical 
energy consumed in Argentina is produced by nuclear power plants.

  [Text] DIPOS [expansion unknown] trustee Benjamin Garcia 
Posse has signed an agreement with the National Commission for 
Atomic Energy (CNEA) for the construction of a Sewage Waste 
Irradiation Plant (PIBA) [Planta de Irradiacion de Barros 
Cloacales]. The project will seek to solve the city's waste 
recycling problem, guaranteeing its rational, safe, economic, 
and harmless return to the environment. 
  CNEA will provide the funds, engineering, direction, 
construction, and installation for the plants, as well as the 
radioactive material (Cobalt 60) and the training of the 
personnel who will operate the plant. The plant's construction 
will be made to coincide with the construction of the Sewage 
Disposal Plant in San Felipe. 
  The contract was signed by Roberto Oscar Marques, CNEA 
radioisotopes and radiation area manager, on behalf of the 
atomic agency. Engineer Jorge Guillermo Graino also attended. 
During the ceremony at DIPOS, CNEA experts and officials 
exchanged ideas on the project. 
  The contract establishes that CNEA will intervene and 
supervise the installation's security as well as any operation 
involving the movement of radioactive materials inside and 
outside of the plant. 
  Operation periods will not exceed 10 years. In the 11th year 
the ownership of PIBA will be transferred to DIPOS. 
  The treatment consists of forcing the "sludge" around a 
cobalt-60 radioactive source carrier installed in an irradiator, 
which is a bunker built eight meters underground with concrete 
walls 1.4 meters thick acting as armor against radiation. 
  Once the sludge is pasteurized it will go into a tank for 
bacteriological and radiation control. Here routine controls 
will check whether the sludge is harmless.

  [Text] Rio de Janeiro -- Angra-2's construction will be 
resumed in the next 30 days and be financed with the $750 
million loan the Brazilian Government obtained from German 
banks. The decision was made by the Ministries of Finance, 
Planning, and Mines and Energy, which approved the Furnas 
Electric Power Plants, Inc. report on the need to finish the 
construction work. Furnas President Marcelo Siqueira on 24 March 
confirmed the news to this newspaper. 
  The construction cost is calculated at $1.5 billion. The 
Brazilian Electric Power Company, Inc. and Furnas will have to 
contribute the rest of the money. "This resumption is not 
inflationary; we will not receive any money from the Treasury," 
Siqueira said. 
  According to him, Furnas will begin to publish the public 
bid 
documents for completion of Angra-2's construction in the next 
15 days. He said the plant's civil work is practically finished 
and only the equipment still has to be assembled. This equipment 
-- most of it purchased from Germany and some of it manufactured 
in Brazil -- has been stored in warehouses at the Angra nuclear 
complex. 
  Ayrton Caiuby, director of the CNEN [National Nuclear Energy 
Commission], said that in the next few days, CNEN members will 
meet to decide the date when Angra-1 will be put into operation.

<F P=106> [By Marcelo Faga] </F>
  [Text] An auditing study that the National Accounting 
Office (TCU) made of Furnas Electric Power Plants, Inc. has 
detected differences, amounting to billions of dollars, between 
the figures reported by Furnas and the real cost of construction 
of Brazilian nuclear power plants, especially Angra-2. The 
report, which raises objections to the figures released by 
Furnas, remained shelved for months within the TCU. Its 
conclusions could destroy the executive branch's reasons for 
justifying the decision to continue with the construction of the 
plant. 
  The auditing study reveals, for example, that Angra-2 has so 
far cost $5 billion, according to the most reliable 
calculations. This figure is more than three times the amount 
that Furnas has officially declared to have spent since 1977 -- 
$1.7 billion. 
  The TCU report also concluded that the estimates of the 
investment that is necessary for concluding the project are not 
reliable. It is expected that the plant will call for 
investments that are higher than the cost of a hydroelectric 
plant with the same generation capacity of 1,300 megawatts. 
  Based on the results of the auditing study, the Greenpeace 
environmentalist organization will request suspension of 
construction of the plant. "Angra-2 accounts have been revealed 
for the first time," says Greenpeace leader Rui de Goes. He 
remarked that the auditing confirms the theses of 
nongovernmental organizations which are against the nuclear 
program. 
  The TCU document has not only challenged the credibility of 
Furnas, but has also cast doubts over the accounts of the entire 
electric power sector. It says that in the face of the 
estimated cost, "nuclear energy is not competitive in Plan 2015" 
which was prepared by Eletrobras [Brazilian Electric Power 
Company Inc.]. "With the most pessimistic hypothesis, thermal 
power will not be competitive with hydroelectric power until 
2005," the TCU report says, noting that the nuclear option is 
the most expensive thermal power generation alternative. 
  "For FURNAS, building a hydroelectric power plant or a 
nuclear power plant makes no difference, because the Union 
subsidizes the cost of nuclear energy," the TCU report says. 
Based on this report, the $5 billion that has already been 
spent, plus the $2.3 billion that is necessary for completion of 
the project, amounts to $7.3 billion for the total cost of 
Angra-2. 
  The limit for Furnas spending on the construction of Angra-2 
corresponds to the amount that would be spent on a hydroelectric 
power plant of the same size -- of approximately 1,300 
megawatts. This would mean an investment of $1.2 billion for 
Furnas. The Treasury must supply the remaining $6.1 billion, 
which amounts to two minimum salaries for each Brazilian family. 
  These figures, however, could be even larger. The TCU 
auditing did not estimate the financial expenses included in the 
construction of the plant. In the case of Angra, they account 
for 40 percent of the cost. For its part, Eletrobras has other 
estimates of the cost for completion of the project. It 
estimates that $2 billion is necessary for completion of the 
project. 
  The TCU auditing study also has doubts about those 
estimates. 
"Angra-2 cost estimates should be considered cautiously." The 
report recalls the case of Angra-1, "whose cost was estimated at 
$319 million, but which turned out to be several times higher." 
  The conclusions of the TCU concerning Angra-1 accounts are 
equally devastating. The auditors estimated the cost at $3.9 
billion, noting that this figure "affords a new base for 
calculation of the cost-benefit ratio for Angra-1," adding that 
this project "has obviously contradicted the terms of the 
economy-efficacy-efficiency trinomial." Angra-1 has been 
disconnected for one year, after a radioactive leak in the 
cooling system caused by a deficiency in the nuclear fuel rods.

  [Excerpt] Cairo, 27 Mar (MENA)--Syrian Foreign Minister 
Faruq al-Shar' has declared that the Arab League Council adopted 
a resolution calling on the international community to put 
pressure on Israel to sign the Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty 
and place its nuclear weapons under international inspection. 
This, he added, falls within the context of the Arab states' 
demand to free the Middle East of nuclear weapons. 
  In a news conference he held this afternoon at the Arab 
League headquarters, al-Shar' said that the Arab League Council 
had agreed on a unified Arab position when the time comes to 
renew the Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty, so that Israel may 
not be excluded from signing this treaty. He noted that weapons 
of mass destruction are dangerous to pan-Arab security and, 
therefore, it is natural for the Arabs to defend their interests. 
  On the Arab position toward France following its recent 
agreement on military and security cooperation with Israel, 
al-Shar' said: We were surprised by the noticeable consolidation 
of French-Israeli ties recently and following the Israeli 
massacre at the al-Ibrahimi Mosque. It came at a time when we 
are discussing the peace process and despite the fact that 
Israel possesses a large arsenal of all types of weapons and is 
occupying Arab lands, he added. Al-Shar' emphasized that the 
matter had been brought up during the meetings of the Arab 
League Council, which unanimously denounced this step as one 
that does not serve the peace process in the region and harms 
Arab-French ties, which were marked by friendship and balance.

  [Excerpt] Military sources close to Yemeni Defense Minister 
Haytham Qasim have said in Aden that the North Yemenis have 
imported various types of chemical weapons and ammunition from 
East European states through a Jewish arms dealer known for his 
close ties with Zionist circles that are very active in these 
states. 
  Defense Ministry sources in Sanaa categorically denied this. 
They said such claims tarnish the image of Yemen and obstruct 
the implementation of the pledge and accord document signed in 
Amman to achieve Yemeni reconciliation. Defense Ministry 
sources in Sanaa said an officer called Colonel 'Ali al-Hadi, a 
member of the South Yemeni Socialist Party and armament director 
at the Defense Ministry, is currently in an East European state 
to make a deal to purchase long-range missiles against the will 
of the Defense Ministry in Sanaa. [passage omitted]

the capital, Sanaa, of importing various types of 
internationally banned chemical weapons and ammunition from a 
number of East European countries." 
  The statement, a copy of which AL-HAYAH received in Aden 
yesterday, says: "These weapons and ammunition are imported 
through a Jewish dealer who has strong links and ties with the 
Zionist centers of influence formed recently in a number of East 
European states." 
  The statement, which falls within the framework of the 
resumption of media campaigns between the southern forces 
supporting the Yemeni Socialist Party [YSP] and the northern 
forces supporting the General People's Congress, describes "the 
weapons brought to Yemen recently as weapons of mass destruction 
like those which have been and are still being destroyed in Iraq 
and which are banned in other states." 
  The statement says: "The military-economic establishment is 
a close commercial establishment controlled directly by the 
ruling military family in Sanaa. It controls most trade 
activities in the republic without the knowledge of the 
government and the House of Representatives." 
  The YSP, which controls Aden, and the Yemeni Reform Grouping 
[YRG], which is led by Shaykh 'Abdallah Bin-Husayn al-Ahmar, 
speaker of the House of Representatives, traded accusations 
yesterdays. The YRG said that houses belonging to its 
supporters in Aden has been stormed, while security sources in 
the city said that large quantities of weapons had been 
confiscated in hideouts in the city. 
  The sources added that "the security services in Aden have 
over the past two days discovered large quantities of weapons 
which were smuggled in secretly and delivered to terrorist 
elements belonging to the Jihad organization in Yemen." The 
sources said that "interrogations of the suspects accused of 
acquiring the weapons have shown that they belong to a major 
Islamic party in the country" -- a clear reference to the YRG.

  [Text] The supply of F-16 fighter aircraft to Pakistan will 
bring about a qualitative change in the strength of the Pakistan 
Air Force. The Pakistan Air Force presently has 37 F-16's and 
it is said that a similar number of additional F-16's will be 
supplied to Pakistan. Pakistan is demanding 71 such aircraft 
for which it has paid $660 million in advance; it is highly 
possible that the United States will fulfill this demand by 
first supplying 38 F-16's and then another batch of 31 at a 
later stage. 
  This decision by the United States will provide a great 
setback to its nuclear nonproliferation targets. India could 
decide to massively deploy Prithvi and Agni missiles in response 
to the new consignment of F-16's to Pakistan. India only has 
started deploying Prithvi surface-to-surface missiles with a 
range of 250 km and out of respect for international concerns, 
no decision has been made about the deployment of Agni 
surface-to-surface missiles with a range of 2,500 km. The plan 
was to test three types of Agni missile and only a political 
decision regarding their deployment needs to be made after 
successful tests. Now that Pakistan is acquiring F-16's, which 
are capable of carrying nuclear weapons, India will be forced to 
give up its hesitations regarding the deployment of long-range 
missiles. In response, Pakistan too will deploy M-11 missiles 
in much greater number with the help of China. A single step by 
the United States will start an unprecedented arms race in South 
Asia, which it will not be able to stop. In the end, this arms 
race could prove fatal for the United States' own interests. 
  The statements issued recently by various level officials of 
the U.S. Administration's Departments of State and Defense make 
it clear that the United States is prepared to supply F-16's to 
Pakistan. Robin Raphel, U.S. assistant secretary of state for 
South Asia, during her current Indian visit is full of flattery 
while talking about relations with India, but she has not given 
any assurance on retracting the U.S. step of supplying F-16's to 
Pakistan which has adversely affected the Indian security 
environment. Deputy Secretary of State Strobe Talbott's 
comments to the U.S. Senate on 24 March makes it clear that the 
United States wants to give F-16's to Pakistan. Talbott, when 
he visits India on 6 April, will add insult to injury by asking 
India to cap its nuclear program because he is seeking a similar 
assurance from Pakistan. 
  The logic for giving F-16's to Pakistan at this time is that 
the United States will ask Pakistan to accept conditions in 
return for the F-16's. These conditions will lead to a freeze 
of its nuclear program at the present level, or in the American 
terminology, to cap its nuclear program. The capping of 
Pakistan's nuclear program will mean that it can maintain its 
current nuclear capability, but it cannot further enhance it. 
  At the beginning of the last decade the United States gave 
F-16's to Pakistan on the pretext of saving it from Soviet 
attacks from Afghanistan. Following India's protests, the 
United States argued that Pakistan is being supplied such 
conventional arms to make it feel secure and it then refrains 
from making nuclear weapons. It is interesting that Pakistan 
then not only acquired F-16's but continued its nuclear program 
as well. What guarantee is there now that Pakistan will cap its 
nuclear program forever in accordance with the pledge that it 
will make to the United States?

  [Text] New Delhi, Feb. 4--India's missile programme crossed 
yet another milestone with the successful flight test on 
Thursday of the long-range surface-to-air missile, Akash. The 
missile, which has an ability to strike at a 25 km range can 
also engage several targets simultaneously. An indigenously 
produced radar (a phased array radar) on the weapon can track 
several targets together. 
  The Akash test follows successful flight manoeuvres carried 
out late last month of the anti-tank missile, Nag. In the wake 
of the induction of Prithvi surface-to-surface missile (range of 
150 to 250 km) and the likelihood of a third test of the Agni 
IRBM, these successes bring India closer to acquiring its own 
arsenal of sophisticated missiles. 
  The development of the Akash is expected to give India an 
edge especially over Pakistan, which is not in the race for a 
weapon in this category. 
  Significantly, Thursday's test validated the ramjet 
propulsion technology, thus making India the third country which 
has achieved this capability. The ramjet principle utilises 
atmospheric air to obtain enormous energy from a low volume and 
weight. Consequently, this makes the missile lighter and extends 
the range.

  [Text] New Delhi, February 14--The Indian Air Force (IAF) 
is expected to induct Akash, the multi-target surface-to-air, 
missile (SAM), before year end. About 75 Akash missiles are 
expected to be inducted in the initial phase. 
  The Akash is to replace the Russian Pechora SAMs which 
comprise the bulk of the IAF's air defence missile system. The 
IAF has about 35 squadrons of the Pechora or SAM-III squadrons. 
The Pechoras first inducted into IAF in 1974, would be ready for 
a phase out in another ten years. 
  The indigenously developed Akash is meant to replace the 
Pechora missiles. While the Pechora has a kill range of 18 km, 
the Akash has an enhanced range of about 25 km. Apart from other 
aspects of technological superiority, the development of Akash 
saves foreign exchange. 
  The defence research and development organisation (DRDO), 
the 
developing agency, successfully test-fired the Akash on February 
3. Significantly, the Akash is to be integrated with the 
multi-target handling Rajendra phased array radar system which 
will enhance the IAF's air defence capability. 
  The Akash will have a wider attack cone thereby enabling it 
to neutralise more than one aircraft at a time. The concept 
involves exploding the missile's warhead close to the targeted 
aircraft and hitting it with shrapnels which spread in a conical 
form. 
  The Akash and the Rajendra radar combine to provide a 
state-of-the-art air defence system to the IAF. Though the Akash 
has been tested on an earlier occasion, the February 3 test 
marked a breakthrough in the technology of "integrated two-stage 
rocket-ramjet." While a normal rocket has an inbuilt oxygen 
(oxidiser) supply, the ramjet rocket draws air during flight for 
combustion in conjunction with a fuel rich propellant. The 
integrated rocket (booster)-ramjet (sustainer) technology has 
weight and range advantages over conventional missile systems.

  [Text] Bombay, February 4--The next launch of the polar 
satellite launch vehicle (PSLV) is tentatively scheduled for 
September or October, according to Dr S. Srinivasan, programme 
director of the integrated launch vehicle programme of the 
Indian Space Research Organisation (ISRO). 
  Speaking to this paper here today, Dr Srinivasan, an 
aeronautical engineer who has masterminded ISRO's launch vehicle 
programmes, said that the failure of last PSLV launch was due to 
an error in the software. 
  Earlier, speaking at the annual symposium on "Space Research 
in India: Achievements," organised by the Bombay Association of 
Science Education (BASE), Dr Srinivasan said the space age had 
come to stay in India and the objectives of India's space 
programme would go a long way in meeting the needs of society. 
  He said that, in the development of satellite launch 
vehicles, ISRO had gone step by step. "It has to be developed in 
a cost effective manner," he told teachers who had come from 
different parts of Maharashtra. 
  Some of India's top aerospace scientists like Dr George 
Joseph, director, space applications centre, Ahmedabad, and Dr 
Ramachandran, deputy director of ISRO's Satellite Centre, are 
attending the three-day symposium at the Nehru Science Centre. 
  Dr Srinivasan said the development of a launch vehicle 
involved numerous disciplines like aeronautics and mechanical 
engineering. He said there would be one more launch of the 
augmented satellite launch vehicle (ASLV) later this year and 
work had begun on the geo-synchronous satellite launch vehicle 
(GSLV). 
  Emphasising the need of the ASLV programme, he said, it 
enabled space scientists to test various systems. "We need 
cryogenic engines and we will have it," said Dr George Joseph, 
while inaugurating the symposium. 
  Emphasising the importance of self-reliance in the field of 
launch vehicles, he said, the failure of the PSLV would help one 
to improve and correct mistakes. 
  He said that, 30 years ago, when India launched its space 
programme people doubted its wisdom. But, when they watch TV 
programmes they realise its benefits, he said. 
  Dr George Joseph later spoke to the audience about remote 
sensing programmes and its advantages. 
  In his presidential remarks, the director of the Homi Bhabha 
Centre for Science Education, Mr V.G. Kulkarni, said that Indian 
teachers were as good as those in foreign countries. 
  The director of the Nehru Science Centre, Dr R.M. 
Chakraborthy, welcomed the gathering and the secretary of BASE, 
Mr P.K.G. Nair, proposed a vote of thanks.

<F P=106> [Commentary by K.S. Jayraman] </F>
  [Text] The reports that Japan's fast-breeder reactor is 
expected to go critical should be good news to India's nuclear 
scientists. India and Japan appear to be the only two countries 
pursuing the breeder technology in today's world that has become 
hostile to this new source of electric power. The hostility 
stems from two reasons. 
  One is the safety consideration, because of the complex 
technology involved in breeder reactors. It is for this reason 
that France, which pioneered the breeder technology, decided to 
shut down its 1,200-megawatt fast-breeder reactor. 
  To appreciate the second reason, one must know what a 
breeder 
is. The fast-breeder reactor has a core made of plutonium fuel 
surrounded by a blanket of natural uranium. During the chain 
reaction, more plutonium is created in the blanket than what is 
consumed in the core, and hence the name breeder. One simply 
has to remove the blanket, extract the plutonium, and build 
another breeder with it or use the plutonium to build a bomb. 
  It is this possibility of nuclear proliferation that is at 
the heart of the American campaign against plutonium. In the 
United States spent nuclear fuel is not reprocessed to recover 
plutonium, and Washington does not want any other nation to 
produce plutonium, even for power generation, because of its 
fear that it can be diverted for bombs. 
  Interest in fast-breeders declined for yet another reason. 
In the 1970's it was anticipated that a spread of conventional 
reactors would lead to a shortage of uranium and make plutonium 
the fuel of choice. But this did not happen. Japan relies 
almost totally on the outside world for energy. It sees 
fast-breeder technology is a promising route to reduce this 
dependence. Japan's prototype fast- breeder reactor Monju will 
produce 280 megawatts when it begins full operation next year. 
  India's compulsion to go into fast-breeder technology is 
dictated by the fact that while its uranium resources are 
limited, it has large deposits of thorium, which can be turned 
into a nuclear fuel. In order to efficiently make this 
conversion, India has to build fast-breeder reactors with cores 
made of plutonium and blankets out of thorium. India's 
fast-breeder test reactor at Kalpakkam, near Madras, is about 10 
years old, but its power level is nowhere near the designed 40 
megwatt. It has succeeded in convincing Indian scientists that 
the technology is difficult to master but not impossible to 
learn. 
  India no doubt is way behind Japan in harnessing this power 
source, but its consolation is that it is not alone in pursuing 
this technology. Whether India will be able to commit enough 
resources to pursue its goal like Japan is, however, a big 
question mark.

  [Text] Hyderabad, Feb. 12--Nagarjunasagar in Nalgonda 
district has been formally selected for the location of the 
proposed nuclear power plant. 
  Mr S.K. Chatterjee, Managing Director, Nuclear Power 
Corporation of India Limited (NPCIL), who is also the Chairman 
of the site selection committee, said here on Saturday that he 
would recommend to the Department of Atomic Energy (DAE) for 
locating the nuclear plant at Nagarjunasagar. 
  Speaking at a function organised by the Nuclear Fuel Complex 
(NFC) in connection with the production of 1,00,000th [as 
printed] fuel bundle used for pressurised heavy water type 
reactors, he said Nagarjunasagar was the most suitable site in 
the country for the establishment of the multi-crore project to 
be taken up during the Ninth Five-Year Plan. 
  He said that a part of the project cost of Rs2,000 crore 
would have to be shared jointly by Andhra Pradesh Government and 
the NPCIL. Raising of funds for the project was an uphill task 
and all efforts would be made in this regard. The cost per MW 
would be Rs 4 crore for the project, which would have 2 x 500 MW 
stations. The Andhra Pradesh Government gave a positive response 
for establishing the plant in the State, he added. He, however, 
hastened to add that there was still a long process for the 
finalisation of the project, which among other things required 
environmental clearance. The NPCIL was in touch with the Andhra 
Pradesh Government and the State Electricity Board, he said. 
  Stating that the programmes of the NPCIL had slowed down due 
to paucity of funds, he said the NPCI is now concentrating on 
joint ventures with the States. In this regard, the NPCIL would 
have a joint venture with Karnataka for establishing two 
projects at Kaigah and Mysore. 
  Dr R. Chidambaram, Chairman, Atomic Energy Commission (AEC), 
who inaugurated the NFC's productivity week celebrations, lauded 
the organisation's achievements in the nuclear fuel cycle and 
its dominant role in the country's peaceful nuclear programmes. 
  He asked the NFC to make all efforts to bring down the cost 
of production and to adopt innovative methods to help produce 
cost-effective material. "We have to improve the technology. We 
will not be able to get nuclear technology from outside. There 
is no dearth of talent, capability and commitment. But what we 
lack is the speed. We now have to do things faster to keep pace 
with the developed nations." 
  The NFC Chief Executive, Mr K.K. Sinha, who welcomed, said 
the NFC had crossed yet other milestones in its cherished goal 
of excellence by producing the 1,00,000th fuel bundle. 
  Stressing the need for accelerating the production, he said 
there was a general feeling that the output from public sector 
units was not commensurate with the investment on it and the 
fruits were not reaching the people. 
  Dr N. Kondalarao and Mr K. Balaramamoorthy, former chief 
executives of the NFC, said that the organisation grew from 
strength to strength over the years and carved a niche for 
itself in the area of excellence. 
  Dr Ravi Mallu, MP and president of the NFC Employees' 
Association, urged the AEC chairman, Dr R. Chidambaram to 
consider the demands of the employees which included risk 
allowance, insurance coverage and nutritious food to those 
working in the uranium unit and washing allowance to workers. 
  Later Dr R. Chidambaram handed over the 1,00,000th fuel 
bundle to Mr S.K. Chatterjee.

  [Text] Bombay, February 12--A plant for recovery of uranium 
from phosphoric acid is proposed at Alwaye, Kerala, where a 
pilot plant set up by the Bhabha Atomic Research Centre is in 
operation for about three years. 
  The technology used is developed by BARC [Bhabha Atomic 
Research Center], which will be joining hands with a few 
fertiliser companies in putting up the plant. The project report 
is under consideration. 
  The pilot plant is in the campus of FACT (Fertilisers and 
Chemicals Travancore Limited), which is one of the companies 
interested in the new project. SPIC [expansion not given] and 
Paradip Phosphates are said to be the others. The proposed plant 
will be put up adjacent to the factory. 
  India is one of five countries to have the technology for 
extracting uranium from phosphoric acid produced by fertilisers 
companies. The rock phosphates used by the companies contain 
some amount of uranium which has to be recovered to make the 
acid as also the effluents radiation-free. 
  There is also interest abroad in the BARC technology. For 
instance, the chairman of the Syrian Atomic Energy Commission, 
during his visit to the city last month, evinced a keen interest 
in getting the technology. The proposal is being examined. 
  A special reference to the technology was made by Mr A.N. 
Prasad, director of BARC, at the inaugural function yesterday of 
the three-day national symposium on "organic reagents--synthesis 
and use in extractive metallurgy," organised by the Board of 
Research in Nuclear Science (BRNS). 
  While Prof M.M. Sharma, director of the University 
Department 
of Chemical Technology, dealt with the important role played by 
solvent extraction in the field of extraction metallurgy, Mr 
Prasad highlighted applications of solvent extraction techniques 
for nuclear and common metals and materials production and 
processing. 
  Prof Sharma stressed the need to take into account 
techno-economic aspects while developing production processes 
for various organic reagents. 
  Dr C.K. Gupta, director, materials group, BARC, recalled the 
pioneering work by the Uranium &amp; Rare Earth Extraction 
Division 
in the field of solvent extraction and synthesis of organic 
reagents used in the process and said technology for production 
of some organic solvents was ripe for passing on to industry.

  [Text] New Delhi, Feb. 3--India and Canada today discussed 
means of taking forward the disarmament agenda in the framework 
of the United Nations, which essentially rests on the conclusion 
of a Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty (CTBT), cutting off 
production of fissile materials for nuclear weapons and 
explosive devices, and establishing a satisfactory verification 
regime in this context. 
  Canada's Disarmament Envoy, Ms. Peggy Mason, who is slated 
to 
chair the U.N. Secretary General's Expert Group on Verification, 
arrived here via Kathmandu to discuss the leading questions of 
disarmament with India at the official level. 
  She is understood to have sought India's active cooperation 
in the UN Conference on Disarmament. India's initiative in this 
sphere is widely recognised, and dates back to 1982. The Action 
Plan enunciated by the late Rajiv Gandhi in 1988 had also called 
for an international verification regime under U.N. auspices.

<F P=106> [Editorial: "Capping It All"] </F>
  [Text] The new American move to promote nuclear non- 
proliferation in South Asia is yet another illustration of the 
Clinton administration's tendency to come out with glib answers 
to admittedly complicated issues. The proposal aims at getting 
India and Pakistan to agree to cap their nuclear programmes and 
accept international inspection of their nuclear production 
facilities. There is hardly anything new about this approach. It 
had prompted earlier unsuccessful initiatives to bring about 
bilateral or regional accords on nuclear-free zones. The present 
attempt is essentially to present the same idea in a more 
attractive package. New Delhi must be extremely wary of the 
underlying trap. The renewed move is suspect especially because 
it looks like a clumsy stratagem to overcome strong 
Congressional opposition to the administration's frantic bid to 
scuttle the Pressler Amendment and supply F-16 combat aircraft 
to Pakistan. Originally, the administration had sought to oblige 
the Pakistani military establishment in return for the latter's 
agreement to verified capping of that country's nuclear 
programme. Since the proposal made no headway, Washington has 
now come up with the idea of roping in India into this dubious 
exercise. This suggests not so much an eagerness to promote 
nuclear non- proliferation as an overriding need to fulfill 
Pakistan's ambition to get hold of the sophisticated aircraft as 
soon as possible. It is particularly significant that while a 
specific incentive has been offered to Pakistan for accepting 
the capping idea, no sign is yet discernible of a quid pro quo 
to India, too. 
  The more intriguing aspect relates to the facile talk of 
verifiable capping of nuclear installations. It is by now common 
knowledge that the existing mechanism of verifying these has 
proved to be anything but foolproof. The International Atomic 
Energy Agency [IAEA] was totally in the dark about Iraq's 
nuclear programme although it was a signatory to the 
Non-Proliferation Treaty [NPT]. The same fatal deficiency has 
now been indicated in the case of North Korea which, too, has 
formally subscribed to NPT. 
  India has often underscored the vital importance of an 
unquestionably sound verification regime if the objective of 
non- proliferation is to be achieved. But the IAEA has not yet 
devised one. So long as this is the stark reality, New Delhi 
must not allow itself to be cajoled much less coerced into 
accepting any non- proliferation proposal. In fact, credible 
verification of full compliance with nuclear obligations should 
be high on the agenda of the NPT review conference next year. 
The Clinton administration's bid to jump the gun is thus 
entirely misconceived. Most pertinently, India is already a 
co-sponsor with the US of a UN resolution seeking an 
international convention for fissile material cut-off. This is 
all the more reason why the US initiative limited to South Asia 
lacks justification

<F P=106> [First of two-part commentary by M.M. Ghaffari: "PRC-Iran: </F>
Strategic Cooperation in the Future"] 
<H5>  [15 Mar 94 p 4] </H5>
  [Excerpts] Qian Qichen, deputy prime minister of the PRC, 
who is also the foreign minister, made a regional trip and 
visited Bangladesh, Maldives, Sri Lanka, Pakistan, and the 
Islamic Republic of Iran. His trip to Iran was the most 
significant of all and it elicited much attention from political 
circles. Within the context of the PRC foreign minister's visit 
to Iran, we can look at the long-standing relations between the 
two countries and the trend toward broadening political and 
economic relations, as the PRC Government has always had 
friendly relations with Iran, even in the distant past. 
[passage omitted] 
  Even though in recent years, cooperation between the PRC and 
Iran has increased remarkably, it appears that there is greater 
scope for joint economic cooperation. There is evidence of the 
two countries' eagerness to expand these relations and the PRC 
has focused its attention on the Islamic Republic of Iran 
because it is a large and important country in the Persian Gulf, 
southwest Asia and the Middle East, which can play an important 
role in regional developments as a political balance. 
  Reciprocally, as regards its foreign policy calculations, 
Iran considers the PRC a major country that is undergoing the 
greatest economic prosperity of the century and one that enjoys 
immense scope for maneuvering in the political arena of today. 
  The turmoil in the world prior to the Cold War and the 
elimination of tensions generated by the end to the Cold War; 
the U.S. domination in the world by a minority [as published]; 
and the new world order as propounded by the United States are 
the various phenomena that have heightened the sensitivity of 
Iran and the PRC so that the two countries have attained 
unanimity through greater historical understanding and political 
acumen with regard to the political developments in the region. 
[passage omitted] 
  As regards the use of nuclear energy in Iran, the United 
States has fomented tension in the region, implying that the PRC 
has initiated measures to transfer technology to Iran which is 
not for economic advantages but for military and political 
objectives. However, regardless of the tumultuous uproar in the 
world spearheaded by the United States regarding Iran's program 
of peaceful and amicable utilization of nuclear energy , the PRC 
continues its cooperation with Iran. What has been termed 
PRC-Iranian nuclear cooperation has generated much concern on 
the part of the Pentagon. 
  The U.S. apprehension can be viewed in the context of two 
perceptions: first, remarks by Iranian officials have raised 
questions about Iran's commitment to the nuclear 
Non-Proliferation Treaty and second, the Middle East and the 
Persian Gulf are regions in which the use of nuclear weapons 
would be extremely destabilizing. However, the United States, 
with its usual erroneous appraisals in foreign policy and for 
reasons of security and intelligence, is not inclined to 
elaborate on the nuclear issue in relation to Iran, Pakistan, 
DPRK, and India. 
  Perhaps, according to the perceptions of the Pentagon 
echelons, the presence of nuclear weapons in the Middle East can 
be a useful lever and a pretext to exert pressure on these 
countries at sensitive junctures. However, the vigilant nations 
that have thrown off the shackles of colonialism and 
exploitation are well aware that the usurpist Jerusalem regime 
is the sole nuclear power in the Middle East and it even opposes 
inspection by the International Atomic Energy Agency [IAEA]. No 
Western or American government has ever protested against this 
regime. However, the United States audaciously declares that 
Iran's acquisition of nuclear capability may not be imminent but 
the United States has its own assessment upon which it is not 
willing to elaborate. It also has no reason to believe that 
there is no cooperation between Iran and the PRC as regards a 
military-nuclear program. 
  Simultaneously, the U.S. mass media launched a coordinated 
propaganda program with similar reports that Iran is seeking to 
gain a nuclear capability and has the benefit of the PRC's 
cooperation and collaboration! The United States has constantly 
used the lever of pressure on various countries so that it can 
impede their paths of broadening cooperation with Iran. The 
PRC, which wishes to have deep and principled relations with 
Iran and in numerous cases pursues an independent policy on the 
international scene, has constantly been the target of U.S. 
blackmail. The United States has admitted to exerting pressure 
on various countries to prevent their cooperation with Iran in 
the field of nuclear technology and this is only the tip of the 
iceberg. 
<H5>  [16 Mar 94 p 4] </H5>
  After the Islamic Revolution in Iran, the United States 
directed most of its efforts toward destroying relations between 
the Islamic Republic of Iran and other countries and isolating 
Iran in the international arena. This can be considered an 
unchangeable characteristic of U.S. policies. 
  Political circles have described Iran's gaining nuclear 
capability as an extremely destabilizing factor in the Middle 
East, adding that the report of nuclear cooperation between Iran 
and the PRC is being disseminated just when those who 
participated in the Madrid peace conference have been sentenced 
to death! [as published] In the same vein, a U.S. nuclear 
expert stated that Iran and Pakistan have crossed the line 
toward the acquisition of nuclear weapons and Iraq has done a 
lot of research in the nuclear field. Had it not been for the 
Persian Gulf war, Iraq would have succeeded in manufacturing a 
nuclear bomb. 
  U.S. intelligence officials have apparently reached the 
conclusion that Iran is seriously and actively seeking to 
produce nuclear weapons and the PRC is assisting it in this 
regard. In conjunction with this clamor, THE NEW YORK TIMES 
commented under the title of "Hot Oil" saying: Most of the 
leaders of the Islamic Revolution are in favor of gaining access 
to nuclear weapons and a cautious assessment on the part of the 
intelligence sources indicates that Iran's nuclear program is 
currently noncohesive and in its rudimentary stages. The PRC 
has considerable capability in nuclear technology and the 
Beijing authorities have officially admitted to the sale of this 
technology to Iraq, Algeria, and Pakistan. 
  The same newspaper described Beijing-Tehran relations as 
extremely cordial, adding that in the past 10-12 years, the PRC 
has sold large quantities of weapons to Iran. Tokyo and Moscow 
did not wish to lag behind in being affected by this rumor and 
expressed concern over PRC-Iran cooperation in the nuclear 
field! They stated that if the above were true they would be 
forced to take appropriate measures! 
  It is worth mentioning that regarding social and cultural 
relations as well as in its political balances, the PRC keeps 
the necessary considerations in mind. This is borne out by the 
fact that on the controversial issue of exporting nuclear 
technology to Iran, the PRC stressed that in its exports it 
firmly ensures adherence to the principles of the IAEA 
[International Atomic Energy Agency], including the peaceful 
utilization of nuclear technology and non-transfer to a third 
country. 
  From this viewpoint, the PRC and Iran, within the framework 
of mutual relations, have given priority to issues that are far 
removed from the tension, blackmail, and instability in the 
region. When the United States realizes that it is not able to 
mar relations between Iran and the PRC, it will certainly seek 
other chimerical pretexts for creating obstructions and damaging 
relations between the two countries. In order to isolate Iran 
and the PRC on the political and international level, the United 
States accuses them of violation of human rights. The PRC is 
charged with maltreatment of the Muslims in its northern 
province of Sinkiang and of exporting nuclear technology to the 
countries of southwest Asia. 
  Similarly, Iran is declared an opponent of the Middle East 
peace trend and is accused of government-sponsored terrorism and 
similar issues. Despite all this, the PRC and Iran have 
displayed a high degree of restraint and openmindedness in their 
foreign policy, which can be considered a principled course in 
reciprocal relations. 
  The PRC foreign minister attended the 48th UN General 
Assembly session, at which he described the old order as based 
on unequal relations and explained that such an order was 
anachronistic. He added that the world of the future should not 
merely be geared to the interests and privileges of the greater 
powers and international affairs should not be the monopoly of 
the larger and stronger countries. Even though the United 
States and the former Soviet Union had concurred on the 
reduction of nuclear arms, the presence of a vast arsenal of 
non-conventional weapons gives a different message. The policy 
of force still prevails in the world and the greater countries 
still exert economic pressure on all countries, thus seeking to 
increase the chasm between the countries of the north and the 
south. 
  The PRC believes that conditions should be created for the 
development of the Third World countries to establish peace and 
security in the world. Equality among governments in mutual 
relations and non-intervention in their internal affairs is a 
principle which--from the PRC perspective--should be applied to 
all countries without exception. In this regard, the PRC 
believes that a survey of the human rights situation should not 
be permitted to tarnish the sovereignty of countries as human 
rights and basic freedom of human beings should be applied 
equally to all.

<F P=106> [Editorial: "Nuclear Program -- Are Our Hands Tied, or Will </F>
They Being Broken?"] 
  [Text] World-renowned Pakistani scientist Dr. Abdul Qadeer 
Khan says his hands have been tied. If he utters even one word, 
explanations are sought from higher authorities, fearing that 
the word may be misinterpreted and our aid may be stopped. 
Pakistan's nuclear program began as a reaction to India's 
nuclear explosion and to guarantee our security. The world 
knows that our program is solely for peaceful purposes, because 
Pakistan has no aggressive designs. On the other hand, India 
has fought three wars with Pakistan, and by dismembering 
Pakistan in 1971 it proved that it finds Pakistan's existence 
unacceptable. Following the fall of East Pakistan, India is 
looking for the opportunity to grab what remains of Pakistan. 
  India's other neighbors are also tired of this. The Maldives 
and Sri Lanka have already been the victims of its aggression 
and Bhutan has been blockaded economically. Except for Pakistan 
and China, India's neighboring countries are not in a position 
to challenge it. That is why India's nuclear program has a 
direct bearing on Pakistan. India, having been defeated by 
China in 1962, is unable to indulge in confrontation with China. 
That is why it has adopted a reconciliatory path to settle its 
border dispute with China. There has been no change in its 
designs against Pakistan, however. Even now Indian leaders are 
threatening a limited war with Pakistan. 
  There are disputes between Pakistan and India over Kashmir 
and Siachen. India has still not accepted Pakistan's existence 
wholeheartedly. If India were not entangled in its own domestic 
problems, and if it was not afraid of Pakistan's nuclear 
program, it would probably have attacked Pakistan by now. It 
would have been very difficult for Pakistan to face Indian 
aggression with conventional weapons. India has increased its 
defense budget by 20 percent this year. Its Army is four times 
bigger than ours and there is no comparison between India and 
Pakistan in the naval field following the expansion of India's 
Navy. In air defense, too, India's capability is double than 
that of Pakistan, even though we are not weak in this field. 
During his term of office, General Mirza Aslam Beg disclosed 
that Pakistan is capable of fighting a war with India for up to 
32 days. Knowledgeable sources say that this capability has 
decreased rather than increased with the passage of time. 
  The only thing left for Pakistan is the nuclear deterrent, 
which guarantees its security and protection, but the valiant 
United States is dead against it. In addition to Prime Minister 
Benazir Bhutto, former Army Chief Gen. Mirza Aslam Beg admitted 
that Pakistan's nuclear program was capped in 1990, but the 
valiant United States is still not satisfied. Washington 
suspects that Pakistan has made further advances in this field 
despite capping its program; that is why it is insisting on 
inspection of the installations instead of securing assurances 
from the president or the prime minister. Nuclear inspections 
lead to the destruction of nuclear capability, which was shown 
in the case of Iraq. Ms. Davis, the U.S. under secretary of 
state, said this recently while testifying before a House of 
Representatives committee. Talbott, the U.S. deputy secretary 
of state, is coming to Pakistan in the first week of April to 
demand the same thing. 
  The opposition has alleged that the present government has 
knuckled under to U.S. pressure on the nuclear program and that 
after having frozen the program, it will now agree to dismantle 
it. The statement by Kahuta Plant hero Dr. Abdul Qadeer Khan 
hints that his hands have been tied and he is not in a position 
to make any further advances. Nevertheless, a vain feeling 
remains that we can make use of the capability we have acquired 
thus far at any time. It is essential that the government or 
some institution responsible for national security inform the 
nation as to whether or not it is true that the hands of the 
nuclear scientists have only been tied and are not going to be 
broken according to U.S. wishes. This is essential, because if 
we are deprived of this capability India will attack us 
immediately in the absence of any deterrent, and the lollipop 
[preceding word in English] that the United States wants to give 
us will not help in any way. 
  Pakistan learned a lesson from its friendship with the 
United 
States in 1965 and 1971, when Washington imposed restrictions on 
the purchase of spares, rendering our arms and aircraft 
unusable. Even the U.S. demand of a one-time inspection of our 
nuclear installations is unacceptable, because if we accept this 
demand ingenuously we will be subjected to the same treatment 
Iraq received. The inspection will mean nothing short of the 
destruction of our capability. Forgoing our nuclear program for 
the sake of U.S. aid -- given in the form of loans with interest 
at the cost of our honor and security -- will be an utterly 
foolish act. Nations do not exist merely to fill their 
stomachs. Their foremost priority is to walk shoulder to 
shoulder with other nations with honor and dignity. By 
receiving a loan with interest that Washington offers us in the 
name of military and economic aid, we may be able to overcome 
our present difficulties, which are not real but are the 
creation of the major powers and our hostile neighbor. On the 
other hand, it will completely ruin our honor and fame as a 
daring, dynamic, and principled nation which both India and the 
United States fear. We must keep in mind where the secret of 
our strength and honor lies, because if we are deprived of it, 
the F-16's and the World Bank and IMF loans will serve no 
purpose. If we have to accept the hegemony of the Hindus and 
live under their domination, then why did we struggle for the 
establishment of Pakistan? It is the government's 
responsibility to remove all doubts and suspicions that have 
been created by Dr. Abdul Qadeer Khan's statement.

<F P=106> [Editorial: "Pursuing Nuclear Nonproliferation"] </F>
  [Text] The United States has now, reportedly, sought to 
expand the framework of the proposed five-nation conference on 
nuclear non- proliferation in South Asia. The proposal 
envisages India, Pakistan, China, Russia and the United States 
together working out a formula for a nuclear-free South Asia. 
India, however, has been reluctant to participate in any such 
conference on the grounds that it is not prepared to limit 
consideration of nonproliferation strategies aimed only at South 
Asia. It has recently reiterated this position during the 
course of a visit by the US assistant secretary of state for 
South Asia. India's contention is that in the presence of a 
nuclear-armed China it is not possible for it to consider 
capping its nuclear programme. 
  Now the US proposal to expand the framework to include 
Britain, France, Japan and the International Atomic Energy 
Agency (IAEA) could be seen as a way of bringing more pressure 
to bear upon the two sides to work out some kind of an 
acceptable arrangement. The current US emphasis does not appear 
to be on absolute nuclear disarmament. The effort is now 
directed at getting the two sides, at least in the initial 
stage, to freeze their existing arsenals at current levels. The 
objective of a roll-back would be pursued at a later stage. As 
a part of this graduated approach, also, Pakistan has repeatedly 
signalled its willingness to undertake the necessary 
nonproliferation measures in tandem with a similar policy on the 
part of India. The latter has, however, continued to invoke the 
argument of a nuclear China as well as the need to discuss any 
such measures not by reference just to South Asia but in a much 
broader, global, context. In a sense, this proposal by 
including among the participants all the permanent members of 
the Security Council, as well as Japan and the IAEA does meet 
India's demands for a broader context for discussing the issue 
of nonproliferation. But how much help this will be in getting 
India to make any meaningful change in its rigid position on the 
issue remains to be seen. In any such context Pakistan could 
also find itself being subjected to increasing pressure by 
powerful global and regional actors. It is important, 
therefore, for Pakistan's policy-makers to identify its policy 
options carefully in this regard, beyond the understandable 
linkage with India's nuclear programme that it has continued to 
emphasise. There appears to be a heightened US interest in 
Pakistan's nuclear programme as demonstrated by its recent offer 
to allow the sale of 38 F-16s that Pakistan has already paid for 
in exchange for a verifiable capping of its nuclear programme. 
The upcoming visit by the US deputy secretary of state is also 
in the same context. While there appears to be general 
consensus in Pakistan on rejecting this offer it is interesting 
that it has been opposed also by Senator Pressler as well as 
Indian policy-makers, perhaps as a result of the apprehension 
that it will leave Pakistan with the ability to assemble a 
limited number of nuclear devices in short order while 
augmenting the ability of its air force, not least in the 
department of nuclear weapons delivery, in considerable measure. 
In any case Pakistan, while remaining mindful of its own 
security interest and the options available, should welcome the 
proposals to discuss the various aspects of the nonproliferation 
issue in a broader framework. Among other things, it should 
help in subjecting India's case for a voiding any meaningful 
response to Pakistan's various initiatives for a nuclear-free 
South Asia to a thorough review by the international community.

<F P=106> [Editorial: "The U.S. Proposal"] </F>
  [Text] The United States, it appears, has stepped up its 
efforts to get Pakistan to cap its nuclear programme. As an 
incentive it is now willing to allow Pakistan to take delivery 
of the 38 F-16s that Pakistan has already paid for but which it 
cannot have owing to the Pressler Amendment. This is the 
exchange that is apparently proposed in U.S. non-papers to the 
Pakistan government. Thse is no doubt that the acquisition of 
the advanced aircraft will go a long way in redressing the 
military imbalance between India and Pakistan, but the price 
being demanded has to be carefully assessed. Pakistan should not 
in the process of narrowing the gap in conventional weapon 
capability between the two countries end up bartering away 
whatever it has by way of maintaining a nuclear deterrent 
vis-a-vis India. It is significant that while Pakistan is being 
made such an offer nothing similar is being proposed to India in 
order to get it to cap its nuclear programme. 
  A number of things have to be considered here. To put it 
bluntly Pakistan no longer has the room for manoeuvre that it 
enjoyed during the years when US foreign policy placed a high 
premium on getting the Soviets out of Afghanistan. In a world 
that has changed in more ways than one since then we will have 
to proceed carefully in order to meet the requirements of our 
security on the one hand and to avoid getting totally isolated 
on the other. While the Kashmir issue remains unsettled and a 
hostile India increases its defence budget by 20 per cent we 
cannot afford any laxity with regard to our security concerns. 
Equally, however, as the experience of the erstwhile Soviet 
Union falling apart has clearly demonstrated, nuclear capability 
alone is no guarantee of national strength. Pakistan may 
continue to insist on linking whatever steps it takes in the 
direction of nuclear non-proliferation with India's actions in 
this context. At the same time, however, it should also avoid 
the pitfall of getting into a debilitating nuclear arms race 
with India that will impose relatively far greater costs on it. 
To that extent it is for Pakistan to determine first what it 
considers as the necessary minimum in terms of its nuclear 
capability and then examine the US proposals. According to one 
report the US Assistant Secretary of State Robin Raphel, 
currently visiting India, has said that the sale of F-16s to 
Pakistan is linked to a major non- proliferation step on the 
part of Pakistan. Just what kind of a step we can take in this 
direction should be a matter of careful deliberation of all 
aspects relating to our security. What she has said on the 
subject could well be taken to mean that Pakistan's existing 
means of nuclear deterrence would not be affected by the US 
proposal of stopping the production of nuclear material for 
weapons and verification of this step. If so, this could have 
significant implications for the choices Pakistan has. In any 
case the visit of the US Deputy Secretary of State to New Delhi 
and Islamabad early next month as well as that of Pakistan's 
Chief of Army Staff at about the same time to Washington will be 
important in terms of ascertaining the details of the proposal. 
Before making any definite response or counter-proposals the 
government would do well to take the opposition into confidence 
and the latter should refrain from using an issue of such 
crucial significance in terms of our security for the purpose of 
gaining political mileage.

<F P=106> [Article by General Mirza Aslam Beg, former Chief of the </F>
Army Staff: "Nuclear Programme and Political Ramblings"] 
  [Text] Our atomic programme, once again is deeply enmeshed 
in rumours. The political higher-ups are incessantly issuing 
statements which are only accentuating the agony of our people 
and adding to their confusion. Apprehensions are mounting as 
mutual accusations are clouding the reality. Besides pointing 
fingers at each other, the politicians are contributing to the 
image tarnishing of the Army. The severity of blames being 
tossed lead to an inevitable impression as if the decision to 
continue with the atomic programme or to strangulate it rests 
entirely with the Army and that the politicians are utterly 
helpless. The present writer is the perpetual scapegoat, and 
many `wondrous' acts are being dumped into his `accomplishment 
baggage,' of which he is not even aware of. "Strange are the 
doings of beauty" goes an Urdu adage. The singular motive of 
this drive seems to be to extricate the politicians from their 
responsibility, and to insinuate as if the Army was the sole 
arbiter of the decision either to pursue the atomic plan or to 
nail it down. The recent verdict of the out-going caretaker 
Prime Minister, Mr. Moin Qureshi, that the Army has the final 
say in the political dynamics of the country is an explicit 
assertion to this effect. 
  The present climate of stressful uncertainty with respect to 
the nuclear issue is an awful load on the nerves of the nation. 
It seems, therefore, necessary to lift the mask to unravel the 
reality. 
  It must be mentioned here that it was Richard Barlow -- an 
American, placed in Islamabad to monitor Pakistan's nuclear 
programme, who had unequivocally asserted that Pakistan had 
acquired the nuclear capability in 1987, and this very year his 
`report' had come into wide circulation, but the people at the 
helm of affairs in the USA did not pay any heed to it. Far from 
taking notice, a process of enquiry was initiated against him. 
(Reference to Seymore Hersh report entitled "On the Nuclear 
Edge") Why did it so happen? The most vital reason was that at 
that time, the gravest battle against the Soviet Union was being 
waged in Afghanistan, and the US had put all its weight on the 
scale in favour of the Mojahedin. Using Pakistan as a conduit, 
it was lending all support to the Afghan freedom-fighters, and 
it did not deem it expedient at that critical and delicate 
moment that it should risk spoiling relations with Pakistan. 
Oblivious of the restraints of principles, the Bush 
administration, from 1987 to 1989, continued for three years to 
certifying that Pakistan did not possess any nuclear capability. 
[sentence as published] (Refer to Seymore Hersh report: "On the 
Nuclear Edge.") No sooner did the Soviet forces step out of 
Afghanistan in 1989, it suddenly dawned upon the US that 
Pakistan had succeeded in its nuclear capability acquisition, 
and Mr Richard Barlow's report was used as a testimony and 
Pakistan was accused crossing the "Red Light." There was thus no 
respite in the vicious propaganda onslaught against Pakistan, 
and the US pressure kept on accelerating. Its military aid was 
suspended, and the economic aid substantially curtailed. The 
pressure tactic was employed to have Pakistan abandon its 
nuclear mission so as to regress it back to a harmless threshold. 
  Pakistan, to tell the truth, had embarked upon all the 
nuclear steps simultaneously, and these stages are no secret to 
anyone. In all the reference books these are explicitly 
mentioned. For the benefit of the readers, these are spelt out 
as follows: -- The enrichment of the Uranium up to 95 percent 
and above. 
  -- Preparation of the device by integrating all its 
elements. 
  -- The laboratory test of the different elements of the 
device. 
  -- The final test of the integrated system. This can be 
accomplished either by detonation, which is termed `Hot Test' or 
through a `Cold Test,' without it. 
  -- Developing the delivery system -- through special 
aeroplane or missile technology. 
  As stated earlier, Pakistan had developed this capability in 
1987, but the `slings' and "arrows" against it were triggered in 
1990 for the ostensible reason that the Soviet forces had left 
the Afghan soil. The US security scenario had metamorphosed and 
Pakistan was the chosen target for the strangulation of its 
`nuclear' neck. 
  It would be in the fitness of thing to say that the process 
of freezing the first stage of atomic programme had actually 
started in January 1989, i.e. after the decision taken in a 
conference,co- chaired by the then President Mr Ghulam Ishaq 
Khan and the then Prime Minster Mohtarma Benazir Bhutto. It was 
a deliberate and consensus decision, about which the Prime 
Minister Mohtarma Benazir Bhutto was fully aware of her 
allegation that she was kept in the dark about the nuclear 
programme contains no substance. 
  To set the record right,it is appropriate to state the fact 
that in 1988, after Mohtarma Benazir's government had assumed 
power after the elections,a meeting was held in the Presidency 
during January of 1989, to deliberate on the nuclear issue. The 
then President Mr Ghulam Ishaq Khan, Mohtarma Bhutto the Prime 
Minister - the then Chief of the Army Staff (this writer) and 
three other very responsible persons had attended this meeting. 
A detailed discussion took place and all the crucial aspects of 
the issue were evaluated. Taking the overall situational 
imperatives and the national interest into perspective, all the 
members unanimously reached the assessment that Pakistan had 
acquired the requisite nuclear capability, vitally needed for 
its security and that it has significantly added to its 
defensive strength by achieving a "credible deterrence." 
  After recognising this reality, a consensus based decision 
was reached in which there was no overt or covert pressure from 
the Army at all. In view of the global scenario,the regional 
security, and the pressing needs of economic aid, it was decided 
that only in the first phase, i.e., the stage of Uranium 
enrichment, Pakistan should temporarily put a "restraint on its 
efforts" or so to say, a "policy of restraints" was adopted. In 
other words,there was to be only a lull period so far as the 
first stage was concerned. The research activities however, were 
to continue in all the remaining stages so that at the time of 
an emergency, the nation would be able to cope up with the 
situation. This decision was taken after thorough and indepth 
deliberations. As the then Chief of the Army Staff, this writer 
would like to remind that no pressure of any kind was exerted by 
him. Whatever is now being attributed to this scribe has no 
bearing on reality. In the wake of the consensus decision, there 
was `No freeze' and `No capping' whatsoever. 
  As a result of "freezing" of phase 1 of the programme, i.e. 
enrichment only up to 3 per cent, subsequently, phase 2 got 
automatically frozen, because of lack of the "basic material," 
i.e., enriched weapon grade uranium. This process of "freezing" 
continued during the tenure of Mian Nawaz Sharif's prime 
ministership as well. Voices of "freeze" and "roll-back" are 
being heard now, and the political figures have transformed this 
sensitive issue into an `infantile playground,' merely for 
political ends while the nation is gasping into the whirlpool of 
hope and despair with dazed amazement. 
  The situation has now come where the US is intensifying its 
pressure on Pakistan to roll back the programme. It is their 
avowed demand that Pakistan should exterminate the capability 
which it has acquired after years of toil and enormous 
sacrifice. This was not acceptable to Pakistan. After Mohtarma 
Benazir Bhutto's ouster from the government, when Mian Nawaz 
Sharif was saddled into power, he also pursued the same policy, 
despite the magnitude of the mounting pressure from the US. The 
magnitude of the problem and the recalcitrant approach of the US 
can be assessed from the fact that to cripple us militarily and 
economically, the Pressler Amendment was fully imposed upon us. 
The military aid was totally stopped and the economic assistance 
was only negligible. This state of affairs continued till the 
tenure of this writer, which expired in August 1991. Whatever 
has happened since then is outside the scope of his knowledge. 
The irony is that without knowing full facts, the character 
assassination of the writer is being done since long and that 
this is by a deliberate design. To say that the writer was 
instrumental in the nuclear freezing or that it was imposed on 
the government, is totally outside the pale of reality. 
  Based on his conscientiously determined vision, the writer 
still maintains that to give up the nuclear capability would be 
tantamount to committing a national suicide. To acquire this 
capability is totally in congruence with our defence 
requirements. The nation is unnecessarily being subjected to 
doubts and apprehensions, which is not right. Without mincing 
words, the writer would emphatically reassert: The atomic plan 
was not frozen. OnIy the enrichment of uranium was temporaily 
delayed through a well deliberated decision. If any government 
has subsequently "frozen" it, this should be subjected to 
enquiry by the present regime and the nation must be taken into 
confidence. If at all it has really been "frozen" it is in our 
supreme interest that the programme be reactivated from where it 
was broken. 
  Pakistan is presently placed at a difficult choice point. It 
can continue with the animated suspense-neither "yes" nor "no" 
stand-and keep on accusing each other, while the nation remains 
in a stateof perpetual quandary. The other alternative could be 
to concede to the pressure and either "freeze" or "cap" our 
nuclear programme and later on by rolling it back,extract, in 
exchange, all the favours from the US. There is yet a third 
possibility. We learn to live with the style and grace of a 
sovereign nation and make no compromises on vital national 
issues. This indeed is a difficult decision but to circumvent 
it, in the opinion of this writer, is nothing short of high 
treason. 
  This writer once again would like to reiterate his 
submission 
that the issue of "freezing" of the plan be thoroughly 
investigated, mere mudslinging is no solution to the problem. To 
camouflage it in the veil of "Secrecy" is no longer possible. 
The nation is very impatient to know, under what compulsions was 
Pakistan's atomic programme `frozen' and why is the US so 
adamant to inspect our nuclear installations? 
  Notwithstanding the Government and the Opposition's stand on 
this issue, this writer is fully convinced that the people and 
those deeply interested in the security of the country, must in 
unison accept the reality that our defence requirements could 
only be met if we link our nuclear programme with that of India. 
We must unequivocally tell the US that any unilateral or 
partisan approach would not be acceptable to Pakistan.

<F P=106> [Editorial: "F-16's in Lieu of Nuclear Program -- </F>
Unacceptable Deal"] 
  [Text] Lynn Davis, the U.S. under secretary of state, has 
said the United States is ready to supply F-16 aircraft to 
Pakistan on the condition that Islamabad halts its nuclear 
program. The U.S. under secretary of state added that the 
administration will ask Congress to lift the restrictions on 
military aid so it can hand over the F-16 aircraft to Pakistan 
for which payment has already been made, but in return Islamabad 
will have to give assurances that it will not make any further 
advances in its nuclear program. 
  Pakistan has repeatedly assured the international community 
that its nuclear program is solely for peaceful purposes, that 
it does not intend to manufacture a nuclear bomb, and that it 
does not harbor any aggressive designs against any country, even 
though India has already exploded a nuclear device and committed 
two acts of aggression against Pakistan. The United States has 
maintained a policy of overlooking the nuclear programs of 
India, South Africa, and Israel, but its strategy vis-a-vis 
Islamic countries -- especially Pakistan -- has been to prevent 
them from acquiring modern technology at all costs. When the 
former Soviet Union was alive as another superpower, the U.S. 
attitude was somewhat flexible; but with the disintegration of 
the USSR, the United States -- swollen with pride at being the 
sole superpower -- has been continuously pressuring Pakistan. 
This is why it has not only approved discriminatory legislation 
in the form of the Pressler Amendment, but has also refused to 
deliver aircraft for which we have already made payment. 
  If Pakistan were situated in a peaceful region without such 
a 
crafty and cunning neighbor as India, it would not have needed 
to start a nuclear program or spend a large chunk of its 
resources on defense. Pakistan -- which has faced two 
aggressions and lost half of its territory -- cannot afford to 
demonstrate any weakness or enter any deal regarding its nuclear 
program. The only reason India has not attacked Pakistan so 
far, despite its intentions, is the nuclear deterrent. It is 
also a fact that the United States has shown it is not 
Pakistan's trusted friend. After the way it turned away from 
Pakistan after the withdrawal of the Soviet troops and tried to 
improve relations with India, it is impossible for Islamabad to 
accept Washington's offer, abandon its nuclear program, and in 
exchange rely on U.S. weapons or try to live with U.S. promises 
that proved unreliable during the 1965 and 1971 wars. 
  Pakistan has forwarded several proposals to eliminate 
regional tension and declare South Asia a nuclear-free zone. 
These proposals have included a nonaggression treaty and a 
five-nation conference that has been supported by the United 
States. India, however, has never given a positive or favorable 
response to these proposals, thereby proving its aggressive 
designs. The United States has been pressuring Pakistan to sign 
the Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty [NPT]. Pakistan is ready to 
sign the NPT on the condition that India does the same. Even 
this is not in Pakistan's interests, because it does not have 
the strength to face India with conventional weapons. Moreover, 
India is not even ready to sign the NPT. The United States has 
also been pressuring Pakistan to open Kahuta and other nuclear 
research centers for inspection. This is tantamount to 
eliminating Pakistan's nuclear program, because the inspections 
would be the same as those carried out against the Iraqi nuclear 
installations, as a result of which the United States silenced 
Iraq. If Washington thinks that any Pakistani government could 
remain in power after committing such a blunder, it is mistaken. 
The U.S. assistant secretary of state is due to arrive in 
Pakistan in a few days; the Pakistani Government must not 
demonstrate any weakness in this regard. 
  If Washington -- ignoring the ethics of trade -- intends to 
demand a quid pro quo for the delivery of those F-16 aircraft 
that were paid for in cash, it is outrageous. The government 
must stand firm rather than bowing to this blackmail and meet 
the situation by keeping the nation informed. There is no need 
to indulge in confrontation with the United States. In the 
context of its national interests and regional situation, 
however, Washington can be convinced that its discriminatory 
attitude is harming its own interests and its image is being 
tarnished in the eyes of the Islamic world. In this context, 
the government should apprise the opposition of all the details 
and tell the United States that we want friendship, not 
submission.

  [Excerpt] Chakwal -- The federal minister for interior, 
Major General (Betd) Nasirullah Khan Bahur, said the country's 
nuclear programme could not be rolled back which was started by 
our leader late Zulfiqar Ali Bhutto. 
  This, he stated while addressing the oath-taking ceremony of 
the District Ber Association, Chakwal, here Saturday. The 
federal minister re-affirmed that nuclear power plant is a part 
of the country and it would be continued for the peaceful 
purposes and no compromise would be made on this issue. 
  Later, replying to various questions put by the members of 
the bar, the interior minister told that there are certain 
problems for the separation of judiciary and executive because 
there is a law and order problem in the country as more than 
50,000 foreign refugees are present in the country. 
  Bahar said that we had moved an application for the revision 
of Supreme Count verdict to extend some more time for this 
purpose. He was of the view that at present situation this 
process of separation of judiciary and exectutive would harm the 
national interest. However, he confirmed that if Supreme Court 
would not revise Its previous decision, then we would definitely 
obey the direction of the court. 
  Replying to another question he regretted the behaviour of 
opposition on the Kashmir issue. 
  Replying to another question, he praised the role of lawyers 
in the Movement of Restoration of Democracy (MRD). 
  Earlier, in his welcome address, Ch Mehmood Akhter, 
president 
of District bar apprised the minister of the probelms being 
faced by the Distriet Bar. 
  The secretary general of the bar, Mr Amir Bhutti also spoke 
on this occasion. 
  Later, the federal interior minister also addressed an open 
kutchery [court] at District Complex, Civil Rest House. 
  Addressing the kutchery, the federal minister said that

program] 
  [Text] (Yuriy Pikul), general director of the Estonian 
Security Police, accused Russian military unit commanders 
deployed in the territory and senior officers at the Tallinn 
garrison of trading in radioactive materials. He said that at 
least five highly radioactive articles made of metal were sold 
to the West from Estonia. He explained how the command of the 
[place-name indistinct] harbor in Tallinn sold two air-cushion 
vessels for scrap whose engine components emitted 200 roentgens 
per hour of radioactivity. Specialists consider a person's 
unprotected exposure to such a source of radioactivity for three 
hours to be lethal. After the vessels were scrapped, the metal 
was sold to Finland. However, several turbine sections 
containing radioactive cobalt disappeared without a trace. 
  According to the statement made by (Viktor Mikhaylovich 
Krug), assistant to the chief military procurator, the Russian 
Federation military procuracy possesses no facts or material 
concerning the sale by the Northern Group of Forces of 
components or other items containing radioactive isotopes. For 
its part, the Russian Federation military procuracy is prepared 
to begin the immediate investigation of such a situation.

<F P=106> [Unattributed report: "The Jobless Cyclotron"] </F>
  [Text] The Kiev Nuclear Research Institute at the Ukrainian 
Academy of Sciences is experiencing difficult times, as with all 
science. Our country's only cyclotron, which cost us 15 billion 
karbovantsi, has remained idle for six months. There is not 
enough money for the energy and heating that it requires. Just 
as there is no money at the Academy of Sciences, the government 
is also in no hurry to help the scientists. The Institute's 
financing from the budget is only 40 percent.... 
  As a result, there is not enough money to conduct basic 
studies. It is as though they have become unnecessary. 
Specialists, who even now are not so numerous, are looking for 
other jobs. For example, in Russia, where salaries are higher 
and where there are possibilities for advancement. However, 
perhaps, the worst thing about this is that young people are 
leaving the Institute -- commercial structures lure them away. 
In the course of time, Ukraine may find itself without nuclear 
specialists. At the same time, we have 15 nuclear power 
stations, and, by the year 2000, it is envisaged to have at 
least another five units commissioned.

today signed an edict dismissing Anatoliy Kuntsevich from the 
post of chairman of the committee for conventional problems 
relating to chemical and biological weapons under the Russian

found out about this edict, or rather his staff did, through an 
NTV television report. 
  You will recall that Kuntsevich led the committee for 
destroying chemical weapons [CW] and his name was mentioned in 
connection with the Vil Mirzoyanov case. The recently freed 
scientist himself, and his colleague Lev Fedorov -- who had 
revealed departmental secrets of the military-chemical lobby -- 
talk of Kuntsevich as being one of their main opponents.

<F P=106> [Remarks by Lieutenant General of Medical Services Valentin </F>
Ivanovich Yevstigneyev, deputy chief of the Russian Federation 
Defense Ministry Radiation, Chemical, and Biological Protection 
Forces, "at the request of the Russian Defense Ministry 
Information and Press Directorate": "The Military Do Not Deceive 
Their Commander in Chief" -- first two paragraphs are KRASNAYA 
ZVEZDA introduction] 
  [Text] The UK newspaper THE SUNDAY TIMES published an 
article the other day which asserts, citing anonymous 
intelligence sources and the testimony of three "defectors," 
that the Russian Defense Ministry is carrying out work on a 
program for the creation of biological weapons without the 
knowledge of the country's president. 
  At the request of the Russian Defense Ministry Information 
and Press Directorate, Lieutenant General of Medical Services 
Valentin Ivanovich Yevstigneyev, deputy chief of the Russian 
Federation Defense Ministry Radiation, Chemical, and Biological 
Protection Forces, comments on these assertions. 
  Yevstigneyev: First of all I wish to note that 
the continuing campaign in the West to accuse Russia of carrying 
out work on the creation of biological weapons is patently 
intended to divert public attention from their own programs 
which contravene the 1972 Convention on the Prohibition of 
Biological and Toxin Weapons. 
  As is well known, Russia advocates the setting up of a 
large-scale mechanism for verification of compliance with this 
convention. But such a mechanism is evidently not in the 
interests of those who are continuing to improve a scientific, 
technical, and industrial potential which could be used for the 
production of biological weapons. 
  We have observed that peaks in the activeness of this 
campaign coincide, as a rule, with major international talks 
concerning the 1972 Convention. The present press item is no 
exception. It came out on the eve of a session of the 
preparatory committee for a special conference to examine 
possible measures for verification of compliance with the 1972 
Convention, at which the Russian side intends to continue work 
aimed at setting up a mechanism for verification of compliance 
with the said treaty. 
  As for the accusations against the Russian Defense Ministry, 
I wish to remind the author of the SUNDAY TIMES item that in 
accordance with Edict No. 390 of the President of the Russian 
Federation, 11 April 1992, all work contrary to the requirements 
of the 1972 Convention was stopped. Verification of the 
fulfillment of the said edict on Russian territory is carried 
out by the Committee on Convention Problems of Chemical and 
Biological Weapons under the President of the Russian Federation. 
  In 1993 amendments were made to legislation, making 
provision 
for criminal accountability for the development, production, 
acquisition, or storage of biological weapons. 
  Every year our country submits to the United Nations an 
exhaustive report on its biological facilities and activity 
associated with protection against biological weapons. Russia's 
biological facilities, including those belonging to the Defense 
Ministry, have repeatedly been visited by representatives of the 
mass media and the local authorities and by foreign experts. 
  Back in November 1992 an independent commission of leading 
Russian scientists and foreign experts visited the Institute of 
Ultrapure Biological Products, at which the United States and 
Britain suspected that work was being carried out on the 
"superplague" mentioned in the article. The commission found 
the institute's activity to be fully in accordance with the 
requirements of the 1972 Convention. Immediately following the 
completion of the commission's work, the U.S. and British 
representatives also voiced no complaints about the work being 
carried out at the Institute. 
  So any suspicions concerning violations by Russia of the ban 
on the development, production, or storage of biological weapons 
are completely unfounded.

<F P=106> [Vladislav Kozyakov commentary] </F>
  [Text] A spokesman for Russia's Defense Ministry flatly 
refused on Monday [28 March] the reports of Western media on the 
Russian military allegedly going ahead with the development of 
biological weapons. Our observer Vladislav Kozyakov has some 
details on this subject: 
  A spokesman for the information and press department made a 
statement from the Defense Ministry. He told ITAR-TASS that 
Russia is neither developing nor producing biological weapons. 
The statement was causing a sensation but absolutely groundless 
reports were made these days by some Western newspapers. For 
example, the SUNDAY TIMES published by the London-based TIMES 
produced a horrible picture alleging Russia has at its disposal 
some super plague powder which can destroy half a million people 
if 440 (?tonnes) of it were air dropped. What is more, the 
newspaper reported that the West has no antidote for this agent. 
It goes without saying that the report provided no evidence to 
prove this sensation. It couldn't be otherwise, since there is 
no such agent whatsoever. The author of the article, sent from 
Washington, Mr. James Adams, refers to the testimonies which had 
allegedly been made by three Russian defectors. One of them 
gave some information to the CIA, the other two did so to the 
British secret service. The names of these persons remain of 
course unidentified -- as a result nobody can verify whether 
these people really exist. 
  The developments remind one of the practices utilized by 
special services during the Cold War period, when the East and 
the West were competing for who is better at darkening its 
potential enemy. It was just at that time when the fabrications 
were spread all over the world about the AIDS virus having been 
released from the Pentagon laboratories to spread around the 
globe. 
  One can only wonder why even now the mass media is giving 
reports with misleading information capable of sowing distrust 
in international relations, the more so that the current pattern 
of relations between Russia, the United States, and Britain 
allows these countries to resolve their own problems -- 
especially those involved in mass destruction weapons -- 
proceeding from mutual frankness. It was a tripartite 
Russian-American-British agreement to achieve this concluded as 
early as 1992. [sentence as heard] The document of the agreement 
clearly stipulates all the sides concerned can inspect the 
facilities which had been used for the production of biological 
weapons. 
  The main question is: Why did this hoax about Russian 
biological weapons come into being just now? One of the 
possible answers to it can be found in the SUNDAY TIMES itself. 
This is evidence that some people are trying to create 
suspicion among Russian leadership. Could it be for this very 
reason that the conclusion can be drawn some Defense Ministry 
officials could ostensibly be deceiving the president in this 
respect? 
  However, another possibility is also quite plausible. In 
Washington and London there appear again some groups which would 
like to damage the prestige of Russia as a great democratic and 
peace-loving power. At the same time they are eager to put a 
fly into the ointment of the current process when constructive 
partnership among Washington, Moscow, and London is now gaining 
strength.

  [Text] Bryansk -- For many years a strictly guarded 
facility existed in the rayon center of Pochep in Bryansk 
Oblast. Nobody there apart from the oblast party committee 
first secretary knew what was behind the barbed wire. Now the 
shroud of secrecy has been lifted and the residents of Pochep 
have found out that chemical weapons are being stored nearby. 
  But it was another discovery that particularly bothered 
them: 
It is planned to build a facility here to destroy the said 
weapons. 
  Local residents posed the reasonable question: "Surely 
Bryansk Oblast, which was contaminated by radiation from 
Chernobyl, should not also become an area for destroying 
chemical weapons?" Signatures are being collected in opposition 
to the plant's construction.

    [Editorial Report] Paris AL-WATAN AL-'ARABI in Arabic on 1 
April publishes on pages 34-36 an approximately 3,500-word 
report from Moscow by Pavel Davidov on the proliferation of 
weapons of mass destruction in the breakaway republics of the 
former Soviet Union and on sales of these weapons and 
sophisticated technology to Third World and other nations. The 
report cites dangers threatening many nations as a result of the 
Soviet republics' lack of control over their nuclear arsenal. 
It says the Russian intelligence and security agencies are 
incapable of protecting the world from the risks inherent in the 
proliferation of nuclear bombs, radioactive agents, missiles, 
and other weapons of mass destruction. 
  The magazine publishes highlights of a "secret report" 
submitted by the Russian Counterespionage Service to Russian 
President Boris Yeltsin "a few days ago." This classified 
report contains a "clear warning that it is impossible to 
prevent thefts, smuggling, and secret trade, which is on the 
rise in military plants and sensitive laboratories. The report 
also points out that the states that broke away from the Soviet 
Union are also unable to protect the dangerous installations 
they have inherited. These states are selling the installations 
to dealers who come from Iran, Pakistan, Iraq, and other 
nations, or to trade firms that specialize in gunrunning. 
Sometimes, plants are being sold, along with all their 
equipment, weapons, and experts. The report gives evidence that 
900 thefts from military and nuclear plants and 700 thefts of 
secret technology were reported only during the second half of 
1993, including nuclear weapons to Iran and Pakistan." 
  The report says that as a result of the unplanned 
reorganization of security agencies in Russia and the defects in 
the new structure of Russian security, Russian military 
institutions and plants, science institutes, and important 
laboratories have been deprived of the protection of the 
official security agencies. No special security agencies were 
established to protect those installations due to "lack of funds 
and the general deterioration in the country." 
  The report adds that what makes the situation even more 
difficult is that the newly independent republics do not know 
how to handle or get rid of the military and other plants on 
their territory. The leaders of those republics think the best 
way to remove these weapons and plants is by selling them to the 
highest bidder. 
  The report cites examples of the selling of weapons of mass 
destruction to other nations. In November 1993, a ship carrying 
40 families of Russian refugees arrived in the city of Isterkhan 
from Turkmenistan, including six families whose parents had 
worked in a secret workshop of the ammunition depot that belongs 
to the former Soviet war naval fleet. In this workshop, nuclear 
containers for torpedoes and sea mines were tested and most of 
them were sent to the Black Sea fleet. Following the 
disintegration of the Soviet Union, Turkmenistan decided that it 
did not need the containers, so the entire depot was sold within 
a year. The buyers were Iranians and Pakistanis. Also, a 
powder plant was sold in Uzbekistan when this republic saw that 
it no longer needs the plant and could not turn it into civilian 
production. The report adds: "We can give dozens of examples of 
this kind. The weapons of mass destruction spread all over the 
Third World from all the republics of the former Soviet Union 
because of the lack of control and protection exercised in the 
past by the KGB. These weapons can easily fall into the hands 
of irresponsible adventurers." 
  The report gives another example of the disappearance of a 
secret laboratory for scientific research in the area of 
chemical weapons and laser technology in a city in Kyrgyzstan. 
The buyer is unknown. 
  The report goes on to say that none of the republics of the 
former Soviet Union exercises state control over nuclear 
security, except for Russia which has a government committee to 
monitor nuclear activities. Even this committee has limited 
tasks. 
  The report devotes a chapter to the future of scientists, 
specialists in military industries, and nuclear experts. It 
discloses that "more than a third of the scientists and 
specialists in the nuclear field and highly sophisticated 
technology, who total 3,000 people that used to work in the 
Soviet Union, have left the country and now work at major 
scientific institutions in the United States, Japan, Germany, 
France, Britain, and Sweden."

  [Text] [Video shows archive footage of special security 
units training to defend nuclear cites, picketers outside Moscow 
Government house, trade union deputy chairman] 
Correspondent: Experts are already worried about the 
situation on Russian nuclear power stations. For example, it 
has become perfectly clear that the security system for 
strategic sites, which include nuclear power stations, will have 
to be completely rebuilt. Special services employees say that 
since the Ministry of Internal Affairs took over the command of 
the special group Vympel, which specializes in preventing any 
terrorist threat, this subunit has practically ceased to exist 
and there is no one to defend nuclear sites. 
  At the same time there is also many other problems. The 
state owes half a trillion rubles to employees of nuclear 
stations. This has forced them to send picketers to Moscow. 
The leadership of the nuclear industry trade unions says that 
nuclear power stations are experiencing difficulties not only 
with wages: 
  I. Fomichev, deputy chairman of the central committee 
of the nuclear industry trade union, identified by caption: 
"There is enough fuel for about a month." 
  Correspondent: A threat of stoppages by nuclear 
power stations means not only a loss of 12 percent of electric 
energy. For regions like Chukotka this is a question of life 
and death. 
  Only a law prohibiting strikes on strategic sites stops 
employees of nuclear power stations from going on strike. 
However, new demands have come from provinces on the last day 
of authorized pickets of state institutions in Moscow. 
  Fomichev: "Unfortunately, because the government 
continues to ignore our problems, the workforce is beginning to 
put forward political demands. Unfortunately the people we 
voted for, the people whose responsibility is to solve these 
problems, are not doing it."

  [Text] Moscow March 31 TASS -- Russia would like to take 
part in the organisation which will succeed the Coordinating 
Committee on Export Controls (Cocom), which ceases its existence 
as of April first according to a decision taken by Cocom's 
representatives during a meeting held in a suburb of the Hague. 
  Cocom's "death" symbolizes the disappearance of one more 
relic from the "Cold War." Cocom was formed in 1949 by the NATO 
countries with Australia and Japan to establish strict controls 
over the export of strategically important technologies and raw 
materials to the socialist bloc countries. 
  As far as Cocom's "successor" is concerned, it will not be a 
structure similar to its predecessor, but basically a new 
organization which should implement an international programme 
to monitor the movement of arms and dual-use technologies, 
ITAR-TASS learned from reliable sources. 
  The new organization should forestall the purchase of such 
goods for military purposes, but will hopefully not be aimed 
against one state of group of states. 
  Work on an agreement concerning the new organization is due 
to begin in the near future. China, Poland, Hungary, the Czech 
Republic and Slovakia have announced their interest in being 
part of the Cocom-successor organization. So far, a decision 
has been made to found three working groups which will outline 
the main purposes of the future international institution. 
  Consultations on the approaches of various countries to the 
problem of export control will be continued. Russia has already 
taken part in such negotiations and is ready to continue to play 
an active role in them on a partner-like basis. 
  The most important question remains that of working out an 
effective international control mechanism which will replace the 
old principles and help maintain the necessary high level of 
knowledge about the spread of strategic technologies and 
materials.

following the line of nuclear nonproliferation, including on the 
Korean Peninsula. At the same time, the Foreign Ministry 
believes that the sanctions problem is not yet practicable. 
Sanctions are an extreme measure to be used when all the

  According to reports from Seoul, South Korea has placed its 
650,000-strong Armed Forces on a heightened state of alert. All

  [Text] The nuclear warheads of the torpedoes in the 
nuclear-powered submarine Komsomolets that sank exactly five 
years ago in the Norwegian Sea remain intact. Officials in the 
Northern Fleet's press center told Interfax Thursday that 
radiometric and spectrometric sampling of the sea water and 
bottom suggested that there was no plutonium-239 in the spot 
where the submarine had sunk. The cesium-137 content there was 
one ten thousandth of the admissible value for drinking water. 
The gamma radiation at the sea surface ranged from 1.5 to 5 
microRoentgen per hour. 
  The officials also said that the Semyon Dezhnyov research 
ship was taking samples in the area. According to the April 7 
data, the radiation there stayed within background values. 
  The press center head Vladimir Pyzh emphasized that the 
Northern Fleet had never intended to make the state of affairs 
secret and wanted the radiation situation in that area and 
elsewhere where nuclear ships of other countries had sunk to be 
reported impartially. 
  He said that two Soviet and two US submarines had sunk in 
that area. Pyzh added that the Northern Fleet command wanted 
reports and forecasts on what was going on or would happen where 
Komsomolets had sunk to be based on specific tests and accurate 
data.

  [Text] Moscow, April 1 (YONHAP) -- Vice Foreign Minister 
Aleksandr Panov, declaring that Russia's position on the North 
Korean nuclear dispute remains unchanged, has said that North 
Korea must fulfill its obligations as a member of the Nuclear 
Non- Proliferation Treaty. 
  In an interview published in the daily IZVESTIYA Friday, 
Panov said Moscow would support the U.N. Security Council in 
adopting a resolution demanding outside inspection of North 
Korea's nuclear facilities. 
  Commenting on his earlier statement that Russia would have 
to 
intervene automatically to militarily assist North Korea under a 
bilateral treaty if North Korea was attacked, Panov said his 
remark had been distorted by the press. 
  The Russian position on the military assistance treaty 
between the former Soviet Union and North Korea has not changed 
from what it was a year ago, he said. 
  Panov said Russia would decide whether to fulfill its 
obligations under the 1961 treaty with North Korea after 
considering the differences between then and now and analyzing 
the situation on the basis of Russia's national interest, while 
bearing in mind its international obligations including the 
non-proliferation treaty. 
  Panov stressed there is no threat of any unprovoked attack 
on 
North Korea at present, thus hinting that Moscow has no ground 
for providing military support to Pyongyang, the newspaper said. 
  Russia tries to make use of the Korean situation to 
strengthen its position in Asia, the paper said. But Russia 
does not want a conflict with Seoul and Washington over this 
issue, it said, noting that Russia, unlike China, is ready to 
support a UN Security Council resolution on North Korea.

<F P=106> [Report by Washington-based correspondent Chin Chang-uk] </F>
  [Text] A Russian diplomat in Washington said on 30 March 
that if North Korea is found to have a nuclear weapon, the 
Russian Government will not help North Korea militarily even if 
a Western country, such as the United States, were to take 
military action, such as preventive bombing, against North Korea 
regardless of UN agreement. 
  The Russian diplomat, who requested anonymity, said this in 
an interview with CHUNGANG ILBO that day. He made it clear that 
if North Korean development of nuclear weapons is confirmed, 
Russia will not give assistance to North Korea even if North 
Korea is attacked militarily because such an attack on North 
Korea will not fall under the provisions of the military 
alliance treaty signed between North Korea and the former Soviet 
Union in 1961. 
  The Russian diplomat explained that although the military 
alliance treaty the former Soviet Union signed with North Korea 
is still valid with Russia's succession to the Soviet Union, 
Russia is not required to provide military assistance to North 
Korea when North Korea provokes a war ahead of the other side. 
Thus, Russia will regard confirmation that North Korea has 
developed nuclear weapons as provocation by North Korea, he said.

facilities, with camera homing in on "Zvezdochka" plant] The 
information ballyhoo around radioactive waste recycling has not 
bypassed Severodvinsk. This is understandable. Over the past 
30 years more than enough problems have accumulated at 
enterprises of this center of nuclear shipbuilding. While the 
spent nuclear fuel still has its uses -- the fuel rods are sent 
to the Mayak Combine in the southern Urals -- no one is 
interested in the metal, which also absorbs quite a bit of 
radiation. The storage facilities built for this purpose at the 
"Zvezdochka" plant are full to the brim. 
  In cooperation with specialists from the center of nuclear 
shipbuilding, the Arkhangelsk Oblast Committee has drawn up a 
program to ensure nuclear and radiation safety. The oblast 
leaders have suggested that all departments interested in 
solving this problem, which is of crucial importance for the 
population of this entire region and which can no longer be 
shrugged off, get together in Arkhangelsk. [171042] [video

  [Text] The press center of the Russian missile force has 
disclosed that during the recent incident at a strategic 
military unit in Siberia there was no threat to the population 
whatsoever. 
  As has been reported, on 10 March a soldier on duty suddenly 
opened fire and killed his commanding officer and wounded 
several other fellow servicemen. The soldiers guarding the 
military facility refrained from returning fire for fear of 
hitting the fuel tanks of missiles with nuclear warheads. 
  According to the statement from the press center of the 
missile force, the system of the duty roster in such units 
guarantees nuclear security in ordinary as well as in emergency 
situations. Information carried by the daily IZVESTIYA about a 
supposed threat of a nuclear missile conflict is groundless, the 
statement says.

April] approved a law regulating the transit and export of 
strategic goods. 
  "Undoubtedly, this is of no special interest to Estonia - I 
think that during next decades we are not planning to supply us 
with such weapons," Estonia's Environment Minister Andres Tarand 
said on commenting the new law. 
  The law, however, enables Russia or some other foreign 
country sell missiles or other weapons to other countries 
through Estonian ports, Tarand said. 
  The law initiated by Estonian government regulates export 
and 
transit of nuclear, chemical and biological weapons, Tarand said 
while adding he did not approve transit of such environmentally 
hazardous materials. Such activities, however, provided 
international rules are observed might bring Estonia economic 
benefits.

  [Editorial Report] Kiev Ukrayinske Radio First Program 
Network in Ukrainian at 1205 GMT on 31 March carries the 
40-minute live "Independence" program on the issue of atomic 
power plants and nuclear energy in Ukraine. The program is 
moderated by Serhiy Omelchuk and the guest is Mikhaylo Umanets, 
chairman of the State Committee for Nuclear Energy 
(Derzhkomatom). Mikhaylo Umanets speaks Russian throughout the 
program. 
  In his introduction, the moderator states that "an economy 
without power engineering is like a car without an engine." 
Such an opinion, according to him, can be also expressed with 
regard to nuclear power engineering. Having stated that the 
"seemingly most difficult winter" in the history of Ukraine's 
power engineering has just concluded, the moderator asks Umanets 
to make some preliminary conclusions "without going into 
details." 
  Umanets begins with a statement that "one can be satisfied 
with the results" and says: "We have fully met our obligations 
to the state by producing 75 billion kilowatt-hours of energy, 
that is, 3 billion more than in 1992. Energy produced in 
Ukraine constituted 33 percent [of all energy production]. We 
have had 12 incidents at various stations, but, fortunately for 
us, none of them could be rated as an accident on the 
international scale NS [as heard], which is now being used 
throughout the world. I think that our radio listeners already 
know that this system has seven levels. The seventh degree means 
the worst accident, of the Chernobyl type. The first three 
levels are related to minor incidents, while the last four, are 
the nearest to accidents. So, we have not had any accidents. 
Of those events, eleven were rated at the first level, and only 
one -- at the second degree. Thus, at first glance, it may seem 
that we should be satisfied with our results, but, 
unfortunately, it is not the case. I do not know what your 
second question will be -- maybe, I will answer it without being 
asked -- but we are not satisfied with the results, because this 
winter, in principle, we have totally exhausted our reserves to 
accomplish what we have done." 
  Asked to comment on how nonpayments for energy supplies 
affect the nuclear power industry, Umanets states that "we have 
worked for free over these past seven months, or even longer." 
The reasons for this, he explains, are twofold: "First, the 
monetary system is not working, and we have permanent debtors 
who today owe us 1.8 trillion karbovanetses. Second, the 
tariffs for electrical energy are not being updated in proper 
time." By now, Umanets continues, many power units are being 
shut down due to the "spring and summer repair campaign." 
"However," he states, "we have neither spare parts nor fuel to 
make these repairs in due time." According to him, the problems 
of nuclear power engineering could be solved if all the debts 
were settled with a "ruble exchange rate of 1:7," which was 
established by the National Bank according to "calculated 
production costs." "If this is not going to happen," he says, 
"it is not excluded that a number of power units will not be 
ready for winter to keep the energy system going." Further, he 
states: "This morning I saw that the system had a frequency 
rating of 49.35 Hz. The system is close to disintegration." 
  The moderator recalls that the Ukrainian-U.S.-Russian 
trilateral agreement on nuclear disarmament stipulates that 
Ukraine is to obtain nuclear fuel as compensation for its 
nuclear warheads. He asks Umanets whether Russia is fulfilling 
this agreement. Umanets states that the first shipment with 
nuclear warheads has been dispatched to Russia and says: "As of 
today, we have not obtained any fuel. For the time being, I am 
not able to say when we might receive a shipment. An agreement 
on the procedures and terms for fuel deliveries has not been 
signed with the Russian side. The United States has not 
fulfilled its obligations, either; it has not given initial 
[pervyye oborotnyye] means for this process -- the promised $60 
million. During his visit to Ukraine, the U.S. secretary of 
defense promised that the $60 million would be in Russia within 
ten days of his return to the United States. However, time goes 
on, and there is still no money. At my level, I have contacts 
with the Russian Ministry of Nuclear Power Engineering and 
Industry, and I know that they have no means with which to pay 
the factory -- and nowadays the factory will not give its 
nuclear fuel away for free -- they have no means to pay the 
factory to have the fuel shipped here. Therefore, the question 
must still be resolved at very high levels, in any case, at the 
Cabinet of Ministers level." 
  The moderator goes on to ask Umanets to provide some 
information on the personnel situation at nuclear power 
facilities, because "there is a trend of nuclear specialists 
leaving Ukraine to take jobs in the neighboring state." Umanets 
says that "much good has been done during this year" in the 
training of nuclear specialists, in particular, "a full-scale 
training simulator" was established at the Zaporozhskaya Nuclear 
Power Plant, and preparations were made to establish such a 
simulator at the Khmelnitskaya Nuclear Power Plant. 
"Small-scale simulators," he continues, will be established at 
the Yuzhnoukrayinska and Rovenskaya plants with French 
assistance. Ukrainian nuclear specialists, he adds, are being 
trained in Germany. Next, Umanets states: "This year's outflow 
of cadres from nuclear plants was a terrible blow to us. There 
are three reasons for this, and all three of them should be 
named here: First, the attractiveness of the private sector; 
this cannot be ignored -- many talented people go there. 
Second, the disintegration of the Soviet Union -- it is natural 
that under these circumstances everyone is free to choose his or 
her fatherland. However, the most prevailing factor is low 
salaries." Umanets says that his own salary amounts to around 
$40, while his son-in-law, who is working as an engineer at a 
nuclear power plant in Lithuania, earns over $300. He adds: 
"In comparison with Russia, our salaries are six times lower." 
He also points out that Russia provides nuclear specialists 
with housing, while Ukraine has problems doing that. Umanets 
states that "a brain drain has begun" and that "our personnel 
reserves are almost exhausted, because about 2,500 men left us 
in 1993." He says that Ukraine has made a move to train its own 
"national cadres" by opening the faculty of power engineering at 
the Sevastopol Naval Institute in September 1993, where 72 
students have already begun their studies. 
  The moderator proposes to answer some questions from 
listeners, which have been received during the program. The 
first question raises doubt whether it is expedient for Ukraine 
to produce its own nuclear fuel rods, which must currently be 
supplied by Russia. Umanets states that, by using all of 
Ukraine's technical and scientific potential to produce rods, 
"the contribution of nuclear fuel to [energy] production costs 
can be reduced by a factor of two, from 62 percent to about 30 
percent." He also says that all the expenditures to produce 
Ukraine's own nuclear fuel, according to preliminary estimates, 
can be earned back in no more than four years. 
  The second question from a listener concerns the disposal of 
nuclear waste. The moderator adds to this his own questions 
about the ways to secure the technological processes in the 
production of Ukraine's nuclear fuel. Umanets begins by saying 
that "one has to be extremely frank on this issue." He states 
that there is a need to create a system of nuclear waste 
disposal in Ukraine. The most important issue, in his opinion, 
is the disposal of nuclear waste from the Chernobyl disaster; 
namely, "unit no. 4 at the Chernobyl plant and polluted zones 
within a 30-km radius." 
  Answering the moderator's question about "the most probable 
scheme" for storing nuclear waste, Umanets states that "there 
should be intermediate depositories for 50-60 years, as well as 
permanent depositories." Emphasizing that this is his personal 
opinion, Umanets says that intermediate depositories can be 
located in the 30-km radius around Chernobyl which "can still 
play a positive role in Ukraine's national economy, namely in 
dealings with nuclear waste." With regard to permanent 
depositories, Umanets says that this issue should be examined by 
geologists. He adds that he prefers to deal with nuclear waste 
in England, where geologists have found suitable formations for 
storing nuclear waste. 
  Next, the moderator asks Umanets to report on the 
implementation of an international project to build a new 
sarcophagus over unit no. 4 at the Chernobyl plant. Umanets 
states that there is no such international project. In Kiev, he 
explains, an international contest was held, which selected six 
projects; the authors of these projects formed "a consortium" to 
continue work on the "project's economic feasibility." This 
consortium, Umanets adds, to get money from "foreign banks" for 
the implementation of its project, has to win "a tender." 
Umanets did not rule out the possibility that there will be a 
special fund created for the Chernobyl plant. Talks toward this 
end, he adds, are already being conducted "at the presidential 
level." Asked to specify which countries will participate in 
the project, Umanets names France, Germany, and Great Britain. 
He adds that there will be no delay in the building of a new 
sarcophagus if Ukraine gets the money for it. 
  Asked to comment on the possibility of introducing share 
capital in Ukraine's nuclear power engineering system, Umanets 
says that, in his personal opinion, this can be done following 
the creation of a "nuclear fuel cycle" by Ukraine, the 
completion of nuclear units, and arrangements for the disposal 
of nuclear waste. 
  At the end of the program, Umanets states that his committee 
will try to pass through the new parliament a law on 
"privileges" for workers living in the 30-km radius around 
Chernobyl. He also promises that the committee will do 
everything to put the largest possible number of power units in 
operation by next winter.

<F P=106> [IAEA "Press Release -- for use of information media, not an </F>
official record": "The IAEA Reviews the Safety of the Chernobyl 
Nuclear Power Plant" -- received directly via fax from the IAEA 
Public Information Service] 
  [Text] An international expert safety assessment team 
organized by the IAEA has concluded a visit to the Chernobyl 
Nuclear Power Plant to examine the current safety situation. 
This team carried out its mission during the period 7-17 March 
1994. 
  The review team was composed of 8 safety specialists from 
Russia, Spain, Sweden, the United Kingdom, and the United States 
along with 2 safety experts from the IAEA and one from the Group 
of 24 Nuclear Safety Coordination Secretariat in Brussels. The 
review was agreed to by the Ukrainian authorities after the 
Ukraine Government's October 1993 decision to postpone closure 
of the Chernobyl station which had been scheduled for the end of 
1993. Unit 1 which was placed into operation last week after a 
three week maintenance outage is currently operating at 80 
percent of its design power level of 1000 MW and Unit 3 at its 
design level of 1000 MW. 
  The team examined the plant safety design and a number of 
specific operational aspects. The review found numerous safety 
deficiencies in the two units of the plant which remain 
operational. Of particular concern are specific problems in the 
design of the first generation Unit 1, which have not been dealt 
with sufficiently. 
  In addition the experts identified a number of factors which 
together affect overall safe plant operation. Difficult working 
conditions and a serious continuing loss of highly skilled 
personnel are major problems. Limited procurement of up-to-date 
equipment also has a negative effect on safety. 
  A major problem is the technically confirmed accelerated 
deterioration of the shelter enclosing the destroyed unit 4 
reactor which, if it collapses, would have serious consequences. 
These findings were discussed at the end of the review in Kiev 
by the IAEA's Assistant Director General for nuclear safety, M. 
Rosen, with the President of the nuclear power operating 
organization (GCA), M.P. Umanetz. 
  The IAEA Director General, Dr. Hans Blix, has communicated 
on 
21 March to the President of Ukraine the conclusion that 
international levels of safety are not being met at Chernobyl at 
present. Considering the seriousness of the situation he has 
suggested that the Ukraine convene a meeting of interested 
countries parties to consider what actions could be taken to 
alleviate the situation; the IAEA would be ready to assist the 
Ukraine in arranging such a meeting in Vienna if so requested. 
  The President of Ukraine, Mr. Leonid Kravchuk, responded 
favourably to these suggestions in a reply dated 30 March 1994. 
Expressing thanks to the expert group for their work, he 
emphasized that the results of this work were considered by the 
Ukrainian Government to be a significant input to the objective 
evaluation of the safety level of the Chernobyl nuclear plant. 
It is anticipated that a meeting will accordingly be convened 
in Vienna in the second half of April.

<F P=106> [TIDNINGARNAS TELEGRAMBYRA/SVENSKA DAGBLADET report: </F>
"Chernobyl Reactors Highly Dangerous"] 
  [Text] New York/Moscow -- The International Atomic Energy 
Agency, IAEA, views with great concern the risk of a new 
catastrophe at the Chernobyl nuclear power station in Ukraine. 
  "The two reactors still in operation are highly dangerous," 
said IAEA head Hans Blix in an interview with TIDNINGARNAS 
TELEGRAMBYRA. 
  The reactors should really have been shut down by now, but 
last fall Ukraine reversed this decision. The reason given was 
that the country could not afford to do without them. 
  A group of inspectors from the IAEA, a UN agency, visited 
Chernobyl a few weeks ago, and on Thursday [30 March] IAEA 
headquarters issued a statement highly critical of the power 
station. The group found that there was much to be criticized 
at the nuclear power station. 
  "During the inspection several several shortfalls in the 
field of safety were discovered at the two units still in 
operation at the power station," the announcement states. 
  "Trained personnel have left and there is no money for spare 
parts," Blix said. 
  "I have recently informed Ukrainian President Leonid 
Kravchuk 
that the Chernobyl reactors are completely unsatisfactory from 
the safety viewpoint," he added. 
  Hans Blix has also offered to arrange a meeting in Vienna to 
discuss with Ukraine how the safety crisis at Chernobyl can be 
resolved. According to Thursday's statement form the IAEA in 
Vienna President Kravchuk has responded positively to the offer. 
  A 70-page report on the visit to Chernobyl by the group of 
inspectors is being put together, but an IAEA spokesman said 
that it is still to early to be able to say whether the 
inspectors' conclusion will be that Chernobyl should be shut 
down completely. 
  The IAEA's negative criticism of safety at Chernobyl was 
received with mixed feelings in Ukraine, SVENSKA DAGBLADET's 
Moscow correspondent reports. 
  "If there were any real danger we would be ordered to shut 
the installation down. I view this simply as a call that we 
continue to improve our work in the field of safety," said 
Mikhail Umanets, the man chiefly responsible for Ukraine's 
nuclear power industry. 
  But there were other voices which agreed completely with the 
IAEA's criticism. Valentin Kupnyy, who is responsible for the 
safety zone around the installation, said that "the quicker the 
installation is shut down, the better it will be for Ukraine and 
the country's neighbors." 
  Valentin Kupnyy also said that those who today support the 
continued exploitation of Chernobyl are more interested in the 
enormous amounts of money which have already been invested than 
in safety improvements. 
  "The IAEA did nothing more than note the facts and this is 
something we have to accept, whether we like it or not," Kupnyy 
said. 
  There are plans to reopen next year the third reactor, which 
was damaged by fire in 1991. However, the authorities have 
still not reached a decision on a new vault around the fourth 
reactor which caused the 1986 catastrophe. 
  "I have received information that the protective covering 
that exists today has already begun to crack. We are sitting on 
a time bomb and a frightful catastrophe could occur," Yuriy 
Bagrov, the president of the fund to help the victims of 
Chernobyl, told SVENSKA DAGBLADET during a visit to Kiev a 
little over a month ago. 
  It was the economic crisis in Ukraine which prompted the 
authorities -- despite international protests -- to reopen 
Chernobyl. Ukraine had suddenly been forced to pay world market 
prices for gas and oil from Russia -- something for which there 
was not the money. Nuclear power provides 40 percent of 
Ukraine's electricity supplies and in order to reduce dependence 
on Russia Ukraine is intending to bring another three new 
reactors into service over the next 18 months.

<F P=106> [Report signed Dominique Garaud: "Death on Board Nuclear </F>
Submarine `Emeraude'"] 
  [Text] French nuclear-powered attack submarines [SNA's] 
really have been dogged by bad luck. Until now, however, the 
SNA accidents have not had fatal consequences. Yesterday 
morning, at 1045 [0845 GMT], 10 submariners were in the SNA 
Emeraude's turbo alternator compartment. According to Rear 
Admiral Philippe Roy of the Naval Chiefs-of-Staff, the reasons 
are still not clear: "A leak occurred. The immediate reaction 
was the isolation of the cooling circuits. Steam poured into 
the compartment and the 10 seamen were killed by asphyxiation or 
burns." The explosion of one of the two condensers projected 
steam at 250 degrees and 45 bars of pressure, and would have 
resulted in instant death. 
  According to initial data released, the explosion caused no 
damage to the vessel's structure and the disaster was restricted 
to the compartment protected by two airlocks. The Defense 
Ministry stated: "This accident in no way calls into question 
the nuclear safety of the vessel." The 48-megawatt nuclear 
reactor located next to the compartment is itself contained in a 
sealed-off area. When the accident occurred, it shut down 
automatically and was cooled by its own primary circuit. Unlike 
missile-launching submarines [SNLE's], SNA's are equipped with 
only conventional weaponry. 
  According to Rear Admiral Roy, the 10 submariners killed 
"were from all categories of personnel." The victims included 
two officers. While normally the turbo alternator compartment 
is only subject to routine inspection, yesterday the Emeraude's 
crew was carrying out a "section inspection" which is done at 
six-monthly intervals on all naval vessels in the presence of 
the captain or his second-in-command. According to a source 
cited by AFP, the Emeraude's captain was among the victims, 
although no conscripts were killed. 
  The Emeraude has a crew of 66, including eight officers and 
two conscripts. Like all submarines, it has two crews, termed 
"red" and "blue," alternating for periods of six weeks at a 
time. Together with the SNLE's, part of the nuclear deterrent 
force, the mission of the SNA's is to sweep the seas and oceans 
to flush out intruders and, using highly-sophisticated 
equipment, to monitor the activities of other vessels. 
  The incident took place during an exercise with surface 
vessels (Casex, in NATO jargon), 50 nautical miles off Toulon in 
the south of Corsica. Diving when the explosion occurred, the 
Emeraude managed to make it back up to the surface. The bodies 
of the victims were winched off by helicopter to one of the 
accompanying frigates and then flown back in a helicopter to 
Toulon. The Emeraude returned to Toulon yesterday evening at 
low speed (four to five knots, instead of the normal 25 knots), 
propelled by a backup electric engine. 
  A legal inquiry and a Naval Command inquest have been 
opened. 
At the same time, the Navy has decided to inspect the other 
five SNA's currently in service. Three of these are out on 
missions, two in the Mediterranean and one in the Atlantic. 
They have been recalled to Toulon. 
  The Navy is already denying any comparison with the 
accidents 
on the SNA's Rubis in August 1993 and Amethyst last March. In 
both cases, these incidents were collisions that could probably 
be put down to navigational errors and which have already 
resulted in reprimands. In the case of the Emeraude, it will be 
necessary to essentially determine the cause of the problem, 
unprecedented on this type of vessel which has been in service 
with the Navy for six years. 
  Defense Minister Francois Leotard visited Toulon yesterday, 
accompanied by the head of the Naval Chiefs-of-Staff, Alain 
Coaranea. He restated that "there is no nuclear risk." 
Stressing that the French people had to be informed of the 
"responsibilities and the technical causes" of the accident, he 
indicated that the conclusions of the inquiries will be made 
public.

<F P=106> [Olivier Provost report: "Arms Exports: Substantial Drop </F>
Likely in 1994"] 
  [Text] French weapons exports totaled 45 billion French 
francs [Fr] in 1993, a figure close to the 1992 record. This 
year, however, the government fears that such exports may fall 
to Fr30 billion. 
  The official figure for French weapons exports in 1993 has 
not been disclosed yet. Reliable sources estimate it to be 
"approximately Fr45 billion." In 1992, Fr50 billion worth of 
French weapons were sold abroad, the best performance since 
1984. Last year's figure includes the Fr21 billion in revenues 
from the sale of 390 Leclerc tanks (Giat Industries) and 46 tow 
trucks to the United Arab Emirates in February. Another Fr2.8 
billion came from the sale of 17 Cougar helicopters to the 
Netherlands and another 20 to Turkey (Cougars are made by 
Eurocopter, which is owned by Aerospatiale (70 percent) and DASA 
[Deutsche Aerospace] (30 percent]. A number of smaller 
contracts made up the balance. 
<H5>  Due to a Number of Diplomatic Choices... </H5>
  However, the government takes small comfort in this 
relatively satisfactory performance, as it believes the current 
year may turn out to be a very disappointing one. According to 
an expert, the initial hope of seeing French sales reach the 
Fr60-billion mark by year end has now been superseded by a more 
pessimistic forecast: that of a final figure hovering around an 
abysmal Fr30 billion. This is due to a number of diplomatic 
choices, such as the defense agreement entered into with Israel 
in the midst of the international talks on Palestinian occupied 
territories, which is said to have infuriated Arab countries. 
Another such choice is Paris' decision to turn its back to 
Taiwan in the hope of regaining China's favors. 
  To this must be added some rumored commercial blunders on 
the 
part of France, among others the underestimation of competition 
and weak financial arrangements. 
  On 17 November 1993, French Defense Minister Francois 
Leotard 
stated the following in an interview with LA TRIBUNE DESFOSSES: 
"I think we should exceed 1992's figure of Fr50 billion in 1994 
and possibly even in 1995." In early January, Mr. Leotard's 
ministry still saw things in this light. Today, such rather 
overoptimistic hopes have been deflated. In Sweden, the Leclerc 
tank has lost out to Germany's Leopard (Krauss Maffei) in a bid 
for 120 units worth Fr4.3 billion. 
  Matra's Mica missile is in danger of being sidelined by the 
American Amraam missile and British Aerospace's Activ Skyflash 
in the race to provide Stockholm with 500 airborne missile worth 
Fr2.8 billion. In Pakistan, as part of a competition for three 
submarines worth Fr3.5 billion, Sweden's Kockums corporation is 
proving a dangerous competitor for France's shipbuilding 
industry. Abu Dhabi still has not bought the 10 or so Mirage 
2000-5 fighter aircraft Dassault thought it would, and Pakistan 
has bought no additional aircraft either. Saudi Arabia may well 
postpone until 1995 payment of all or part of the Fr9 billion 
relating to the three large maintenance contracts it recently 
entered into with France; and it has not yet decided to purchase 
the three French antiaircraft frigates worth Fr20 billion. 
  Last, Taiwan is now keeping its distance [following the 
rapprochement with the PRC], although the island was expected to 
purchase weapon systems worth Fr10 billion for its six 
French-made frigates, as well as 300 armored vehicles made by 
Renault Vehicules Industriels (Fr1.2 billion), and Fr2.5 
billion's worth of Roland missiles (jointly made by Aerospatiale 
and DASA), not to mention another 60 Mirage aircraft in a more 
distant future.

  [Text] United Nations -- Following is the text of a 
proposed Security Council resolution calling on North Korea to 
permit completion of an inspection by a team from the 
International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) to verify there has 
been no diversion of nuclear materials. 
  IAEA inspectors were in North Korea from March 3 to 14 but 
the agency says they were not allowed to carry out all required 
activities. 
  The resolution, still subject to amendment, is expected to 
be 
voted on some time next week. 
  The Security Council, 
  --Recalling its resolution 825 (1993), and the statement 
made by the President of the Council on 9 April 1993, 
  --Reaffirming the critical importance of International 
Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) safeguards in the implementation of 
the Treaty on the Nonproliferation of Nuclear Weapons (the 
Treaty) and the contribution which progress in nonproliferation 
makes to the maintenance of international peace and security, 
  --Endorsing and commending the efforts of the 
Director-General of the IAEA and the IAEA Secretariat to 
implement the IAEA-Democratic People's Republic of Korea (DPRK) 
safeguards agreement (INFCIRC/403) 
  --Recalling the expressed willingness of the DPRK to seek a 
proper settlement of the nuclear safeguards issue in the DPRK 
within the framework of resolution 825 (1993), 
  --Reaffirming the importance of the Joint Declaration by 
the DPRK and the Republic of Korea (ROK) on the denuclearization 
of the Korean peninsula, and of the parties to that declaration 
addressing the nuclear issue in their continuing dialogue, 
  --Having considered with grave concern the IAEA Board of 
Governors' findings contained in its resolution of 21 March 1994 
that the DPRK is in further non-compliance with its safeguards 
agreement, and has aggravated this situation by not allowing 
IAEA inspectors, as agreed between the IAEA and DPRK on 15 
February 1994, to conduct indispensable inspection activities at 
their seven declared nuclear sites, 
  --Deploring the fact that the IAEA is, therefore, still 
unable to verify that there has been no diversion of nuclear 
material required to be safeguarded under the terms of the 
IAEA-DPRK safeguards agreement to nuclear weapons or other 
nuclear explosive devices, 
  m1. Urges the DPRK to allow the IAEA inspectors to complete 
the inspection activities agreed between the IAEA and the DPRK 
on Feb. 15 1994, as the first step in fulfilling its obligations 
under the IAEA-DPRK safeguards agreement and in honoring its 
nonproliferation obligations under the Treaty; 
  m2. Requests the director-general of the IAEA to report to 
the Security Council within one month of the adoption of the 
present resolution on the implementation of the IAEA-DPRK 
safeguards agreement; 
  m3. Requests the DPRK and ROK to renew discussions whose 
purpose is implementation of the Joint Declaration on the 
denuclearization of the Korean peninsula; 
  m4. Requests further that those member states engaged in 
dialogue with the DPRK to facilitate a solution in accordance 
with resolution 825 (1993) continue that dialogue, after the 
IAEA completes all inspections at their seven declared nuclear 
sites necessary to verify that there has been no diversion of 
nuclear material since earlier inspections; 
  m5. Decides to remain actively seized of the matter and to 
consider further Security Council action if necessary.

  [Text] United Nations, March 25 (YONHAP) -- The U.N. 
Security Council on Friday circulated among its 15 member 
countries a draft resolution asking the International Atomic 
Energy Agency (IAEA) to report back to the council on whether 
North Korea has fulfilled its nuclear safeguards obligations 
within one month of the resolution's adoption. 
  The U.S.-drafted resolution indirectly warns that unless 
North Korea accepts further IAEA inspections within a month of 
its adoption, the Security Council will take additional action. 
  The draft was circulated at a closed-door session held 
Friday 
afternoon local time. 
  In addition, the draft resolution states that the Security 
Council will continue to handle the North Korean nuclear 
question and will, if necessary, consider further action. 
  A source here said that most Security Council members, 
including such permanent members as the United Kingdom, France 
and Russia, support the draft. China and Pakistan are opposed, 
he said. 
  Earlier in the day, China, through individual contacts with 
other member countries, advocated adopting a statement by the 
council president instead of a resolution. 
  At the afternoon session, however, China stressed that the 
manifestation of the council's posture should be affirmative, 
objective and moderate in content, according to British 
Ambassador David Hannay. 
  Chinese Deputy Ambassador Chen Jian left halfway through the 
meeting and told reporters that the nuclear issue is very 
sensitive and should be resolved through continued negotiations 
among the parties involved. 
  Ambassador Hannay said a broad consensus had been reached on 
the draft resolution among council members. He foresaw few 
problems in its passage. 
  Russian Ambassador Yuriy Boronchev expressed support for the 
draft resolution, saying that it contained the minimum necessary 
items. 
  The resolution will likely be put to a vote toward the end 
of 
this month, Ambassador Hannay said. 
  The Security Council will meet behind closed doors again on 
March 28 to continue discussing the draft.

  [Text] United Nations, March 31 (XINHUA) -- The UN Security 
Council issued a presidential statement today, calling on the 
Democratic People's Republic of Korea (DPRK) to cooperate in the 
international inspection of its nuclear sites. 
  The council urged DPRK to allow IAEA (the International 
Atomic Energy Agency) inspectors to complete the inspection 
activities agreed by the two sides last month. 
  IAEA reported to the council earlier this month that because 
of DPRK's objection, it was unable to draw conclusions as to 
whether there has been either diversion of nuclear material or 
reprocessing or other operations. 
  But DPRK argued that the inspections required by IAEA were 
beyond the line agreed upon by the two sides last month. 
  The council also appealed to those member states engaged in 
dialogue with DPRK to continue their dialogue in accordance with 
the agreement. 
  The United States, Britain and France at first insisted on 
using warning languages in either a resolution or a statement 
but met strong opposition from China, which said that anything 
done by the council should be mild and constructive and that any 
pressure against DPRK would be counterproductive. 
  China's position got support from the 10 non-permanent 
member 
countries, which argued that since China was a next-door 
neighbor of DPRK, its observations should be respected. 
  After several days of heated debate, the council at last 
reached consensus on the statement which contained most of 
China's suggestions.

  [Text] After four rounds of official and unofficial 
discussions, the UN Security Council [UNSC] adopted and 
announced today a presidential statement urging North Korea to 
comply with the obligations of the nuclear safeguard accord. 
The following is a report by correspondent Nam Son-hyon from UN 
headquarters. 
  [Begin Nam recording] The UNSC held a plenary meeting on the 
morning of 1 April Korean time and unanimously adopted a 
presidential statement urging North Korea to accept nuclear 
inspections. Saying that the statement was adopted upon 
agreement of all the UNSC member states, Jean-Bernard Merimee, 
president of the UNSC, read the statement in which indirect 
expressions replaced precise wordings of additional measures on 
North Korea and a negotiation deadline. 
  In the presidential statement adopted today, the clause 
regarding additional measures on North Korea was mildly 
expressed by stating that additional evaluation will be made on 
the compliance of the agreement with the International Atomic 
Energy Agency [IAEA] if North Korea refuses nuclear inspections. 
  As to the negotiation deadline, which was one month, no 
specific date was fixed, but the IAEA secretary-general is to 
report the result of negotiations with North Korea to the UNSC 
at the next inspection. The presidential statement comprises 
five articles including that the UNSC will continue to deal with 
the North Korean nuclear issue and urge North-South dialogue. 
  Today's statement was a presidential statement, which is 
milder than a binding resolution, without any strong expression 
including sanctions or measures on North Korea. It is analyzed 
that China had strong influence on the statement and the United 
States, United Kingdom, and France made considerable concessions. 
  However, a high-ranking official of the ROK mission to the 
United Nations, said that the United States explained the draft 
statement to the ROK in advance and evaluated that it is more 
meaningful to adopt a presidential statement with the 
participation of China and have China actively involved in the 
North Korean nuclear issue in the future than to adopt a 
resolution and exclude a few countries from measures on North 
Korea. [end Nam recording]

<F P=106> [Statement by DPRK Foreign Ministry spokesman issued in </F>
Pyongyang on 4 April -- read by announcer] 
  [Text] A spokesman for the DPRK Ministry of Foreign Affairs 
released the following statement regarding the UN Security 
Council's [UNSC] announcement of the president's statement 
making irrational demands [tangchi anun yogudul] on us: 
  On 31 March, the UNSC announced the president's statement 
making irrational demands while urging us to allow additional 
unjust [pudanghan] inspections by the International Atomic 
Energy Agency [IAEA]. 
  The nature of our nuclear issue is not one to be referred to 
the UNSC for discussions. We have already allowed enough 
inspections of our nuclear facilities to guarantee the 
continuity of safeguards, as we agreed with the United States 
and the IAEA. There is no room for any doubt here. 
  Even if there had been some differences in opinion in the 
course of the inspection, that should be settled between the 
agency and the inspected country, the actual parties concerned 
with the inspection. 
  Why on earth, despite these facts, did the UNSC finally 
discuss the referred issue on inspections of us and adopt the 
president's statement? 
  The intrinsic nature of the problem is clear. The United 
States needed the UNSC, a stage for political discussions 
[chongchijok toui madang], and had to make the president's 
statement, a venue for pressure [amnyok konggan] to realize the 
hostile policy to crush [apsal] the DPRK. 
  The UNSC, whose mission is to guarantee peace and security 
of 
the world, discussed our issue based the IAEA Board of 
Governors' unjust and biased conclusion [pudanghago 
pyonggyonjogin kyollon] noting that the scope of the 
noncompliance with the safeguards accord has been broadened 
[tambo hyopchong pulihaengui pomwiga hwaktae toeoddanun]. This 
clearly contracts the purpose and principle of the UN Charter. 
  Today's reality is that the United States and some Western 
forces [ilbu sobang seryoktul], who see our socialist system as 
a thorn in their flesh, can have international organizations at 
their beck and call [che maumdaero chwauji halsu innun], if 
necessary, to plot to harm small countries, such as our country. 
No one can deny this. 
  If the UNSC indeed wants to fulfill its mission, it should 
raise an issue [munjesi] with the United States, which is posing 
grave threats to peace and security on the Korean peninsula with 
an immense number of nuclear weapons while creating obstacles to 
the solution of the nuclear problem, and the South Korean 
authorities, the perpetrator [hasuin] of the United States. 
  What cannot be overlooked, in addition, is that the UNSC has 
unjustly raised an outcry over us, who are conducting peaceful 
nuclear activities [pyonghwajok haek hwaltong], while ignoring 
those countries that are playing the dangerous nuclear game 
[wihoman haek changnanjil] under the U.S. protection. This 
shows that, applying a double standard, the UNSC is being used 
by the United States for realizing its hostile policy to crush 
the DPRK. 
  The UNSC intentionally ignored the nature of our nuclear 
issue and raised an issue regarding the implementation of the 
safeguards accord in the president's statement encouraged by 
[pyongsung] the U.S. hostile policy against the DPRK. 
  The validity of the safeguards accord has virtually been 
suspended since we temporarily suspended the effectuation of the 
withdrawal from the Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty [NPT] for 
the DPRK-U.S. talks. Up to the present, we have allowed 
inspections only to guarantee the continuity of safeguards as a 
self-imposed and well-meant measure [chayulchogin sonuiui 
chochiroso] with the desire to prove the transparency of our 
nuclear activities. These inspections coincide with our special 
Position [uriga chohae innun tuksu chiwie puhaptoenun]. 
  Since the United States and the IAEA could not deny this, 
they agreed to conduct the restricted inspection only to 
guarantee the continuity of safeguards, not regular or irregular 
inspections [chonggi mit pijonggi]. Accordingly, raising an 
issue on the implementation of the safeguards accord and 
additional inspections is senseless to us since we are in an 
authorized special position [kongindoen tuksu chiwi]. 
  We do what we say we are going to do, and do not do what we 
say we are not going to do. We are invariably adhering to a 
firm independent policy and a correct line on external 
relations. We have never changed a position that we once 
declared. 
  The UNSC should first take steps to fix the unjust action by 
the IAEA Secretariat, which has widened the area of unjust 
treatment of us [urie taehan pulgongjongsongui pomwirul 
hwaktaesikigo innun], currying favor with large countries, 
before demanding our additional inspections. 
  The IAEA Secretariat ought to apologize for the fact that it 
has widened the area of unjust treatment, openly joining the 
U.S. anti- Republic maneuver. Far from apologizing, the IAEA 
Secretariat has gradually expanded its unjust treatment of us. 
We will repay [kyesan] this without fail. 
  The United States is more openly stirring up the maneuver of 
international pressure against the Republic [kukchejogin 
pangonghwaguk amnyok sodongul touk nogolhwa hago itta], using 
the IAEA Board of Governors and the UNSC. 
  Furthermore, the United States is carrying into extremes its 
military pressure, saying that it will resume the Team Spirit 
joint military exercise and that it is ready to trigger the 
second Korean war [cheiui choson chonjaengdo pulsahagetta]. 
  All facts clearly prove that the United States has no 
intention to resolve the nuclear issue at all and that its main 
aim is to realize its hostile policy of crushing Korea 
[taechoson choktaesi apsal chongchaek] by deliberately 
aggravating the situation of the Korean peninsula. 
  Complying with this as well, by continuing to introduce 
nuclear weapons and stepping up their nuclear development, the 
South Korean authorities are attempting to persistently stage a 
nuclear war exercise against us in conspiracy with a nuclear 
possession country. This shows that the South Korean authorities 
are, in fact, not interested in the joint declaration of 
denuclearization of the Korean peninsula but are rushing toward 
the criminal road of nullifying it. 
  Under the present situation in which the United States is 
clinging to pressure alone [migugi amyok ilbyondoro naonun hyon 
sanghwangeso] after overturning all promises made to us we have 
no choice but to conduct on a normal basis our peaceful nuclear 
activities [chongsanghwa hajiannulsu opke toeyotta] which we had 
unilaterally frozen for the DPRK-U.S. talks. 
  The United States and the South Korean authorities are 
attempting to escalate their commotion of pressure on us with 
the presidential statement of the UN Security Council as an 
occasion. However, this cannot fool us. 
  The more the United States and its follower forces scheme to 
crush the socialist system of our own style, the firmer the 
singleheartedly united might of our party, the people, and the 
People's Army will be. 
  Responding to force with force and to dialogue with dialogue 
is our firm and invariable will and policy. The U.S. hostile 
policy of crushing Korea will not escape ruin. 
  Our position to resolve the nuclear issue peacefully is 
consistent [sijong ilgwan hada]. 
  [Dated] 4 April 1994, Pyongyang.

  [Text] Beijing, April 3 KYODO -- Chinese Foreign Minister 
Qian Qichen on Saturday [2 April] lauded a mildly worded UN 
Security Council statement on the North Korean nuclear standoff, 
saying it helped to ease tension on the Korean peninsula. 
  "The adoption of a presidential statement focusing on 
dialogue has helped to ease tension and gives the countries and 
organizations concerned some time leeway," Qian told a 
delegation of Japan's Social Democratic Party (SDP). The SDP is 
the largest group in Japan's seven-party coalition. 
  After one week of diplomatic bargaining with China, which 
firmly opposed the adoption of any resolution against its 
longtime ally North Korea, the 15-member Security Council on 
Thursday issued a nonbinding presidential statement urging 
Pyongyang to allow the completion of international inspections 
of its nuclear facilities. 
  The statement did not include a threat of sanctions should 
North Korea continue to refuse the inspections, but said 
"further Security Council consideration will take place if 
necessary in order to achieve full implementation" of nuclear 
safeguards Pyongyang signed with the International Atomic Energy 
Agency (IAEA). 
  Noting that the statement has nonbinding character, Qian 
said, however, he hopes "that it can be avoided that such a 
situation occurs." 
  He suggested that the IAEA explain to Pyongyang why 
inspections carried out over two weeks in March are considered 
inadequate to decide whether Pyongyang has diverted nuclear 
material for weapon purposes. 
  Pyongyang, while maintaining that its nuclear program serves 
strictly civilian purposes, contends it fully complied with the 
IAEA inspection demands. 
  The SDP delegation headed by Issei Inoue arrived on Friday 
for talks with Chinese leaders and representatives of the 
Chinese Communist Party (CCP). 
  In a meeting with Li Shuzheng, head of the International 
Liaison Department of the party's Central Committee, on Friday 
both sides agreed to dispatch another SDP delegation to China in 
mid-May to mark the 10th anniversary of relations between their 
parties, SDP officials said.

  [Text] Seoul, April 4 (YONHAP) -- China plans to send a 
high-level delegation to North Korea for the 82nd birthday of 
President Kim Il-song on April 15 that will urge resolution of 
the nuclear dispute through dialogue, a Seoul government 
official said Sunday. 
  The Chinese delegates will reportedly brief Pyongyang on the 
recent summit between South Korean and Chinese Presidents Kim 
Yong-sam and Jiang Zemin and explain Beijing's position in 
approving a United Nations Security Council statement calling on 
the Stalinist country to meet with the United States and 
International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA). 
  They are to highlight Kim Yong-sam's assurances that South 
Korea has neither the intention nor ability to absorb the North 
and will support Pyongyang vis-a-vis the United States and Japan 
when the nuclear problem is resolved, as well as emphasizing the 
need for inter-Korean dialogue. 
  Beijing promised efforts, albeit limited, to lure Pyongyang 
to the negotiating table during Kim's visit to China last week. 
  The Chinese delegation to Pyongyang is likely to be led by a 
senior official who will congratulate Kim Il-song on his 82nd 
birthday, the Seoul official said. 
  The visiting delegates are expected to advocate peaceful 
resolution of the nuclear problem in meetings with high-level 
North Korean officials, he said. The Chinese will pay a courtesy 
call on President Kim Il-song and explain South Korean President 
Kim's thoughts on North Korea set forth in his summit with 
Jiang, the official said. 
  North Korea and the United States will resume contact in one 
way or another, the official said, probably later in the month 
after Kim's birthday.

  [Text] Beijing, April 5 (AFP)--China denied Tuesday [5 
April] it was sending a high-level delegation to North Korea to 
mark the 82nd birthday of Kim Il-Sung on April 15. 
  "We have never heard something like China sending a 
high-level delegation to North Korea to attend President Kim's 
birthday celebrations," said a foreign ministry spokesman 
contacted by telephone. 
  He was denying a report by South Korea's YONHAP news agency 
which said that members of the delegation would have talks with 
Kim about the nuclear standoff following Pyongyang's refusal to 
allow full International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) inspections 
of its nuclear sites. 
  On Monday North Korea officially rejected an appeal by the 
United Nations Security Council to open its sites to IAEA 
inspectors. 
  China is the North's closest ally and so far has refused to 
put any pressure on Pyongyang over the nuclear affair or to 
support moves to impose international sanctions.

  [Text] Seoul, March 29 (YONHAP) -- Russia would support a 
United Nations Security Council resolution calling on North 
Korea to accept nuclear inspections, while seeking an 
international meeting to discuss the issue attended by South and 
North Korea, the United States, Japan, Russia, China, the United 
Nations and the International Atomic Energy Agency [IAEA], Radio 
Moscow reported Monday. 
  According to NAEWOE PRESS, Seoul's official monitor of 
communist countries' news media, the radio said, "Moscow would 
support a UN Security Council resolution calling for North Korea 
to observe its obligations to the IAEA under the framework of 
the nuclear non- proliferation treaty." 
  Moreover, Russia thinks that neighboring countries' efforts 
to solve the problem are not enough so it will try to hold an 
international meeting of delegates from South and North Korea, 
Japan, Russia, China, the United States, the UN 
secretary-general and the IAEA director-general, the radio said. 
  Radio Moscow, citing the scheduled deployment of Patriot 
missiles in South Korea and Pyongyang's objections to the move, 
said, "the tension on the Korean peninsula is worsening and 
under thses circumstances, Russia's idea on holding an 
international meeting is useful and pressing."

  [Text] Tokyo, March 28 KYODO -- Japan voiced tacit support 
Monday [29 March] for China's proposal for a soft nonbinding 
statement at the U.N. Security Council urging North Korea to 
accept full nuclear inspections. 
  Vice Foreign Minister Kunihiko Saito told a news conference, 
"not a single country believes it's appropriate to take measures 
that could escalate things rapidly to a high stage (of urgency)." 
  Britain, China, France, Russia and the United States last 
week conferred privately over a draft resolution. 
  The U.S. has proposed a resolution urging North Korea to 
agree to follow-up inspections of its nuclear facilities within 
one month. The resolution does not call for sanctions but leaves 
room for "further action if necessary." 
  China, which is eager to keep open the door for dialogue 
with 
North Korea, says it is too early for such a step. 
  China suggested Friday that the Security Council issue a 
nonbinding statement in the name of its president, Jean-Bernard 
Merimee of France, which unlike a resolution could be adopted by 
consensus rather than by vote. 
  Saito said Tokyo expects the 15-member Security Council to 
take measures "most suitable at this point, as many members have 
the same awareness of the problem as we do." 
  Noting that "the aim is to make North Korea change its 
policy 
and not to take punitive action," Saito said Tokyo does not 
"object" to the dialogue approach. 
  As a permanent member China holds the power of veto, which 
it 
is likely to use if the council calls for tougher action such as 
economic sanctions against its longtime ally North Korea. 
  South Korea's Foreign Minister Han Sung-chu said Sunday 
before adopting resolutions China's proposal "may be effective." 
  Concerning direct talks between Japan and North Korea, Saito 
said Tokyo would positively respond if Pyongyang signaled 
interest in such talks, which "it does not seem to have."

<F P=106> [Report by Washington correspondent Chong Chin-sok] </F>
  [Text] ROK Foreign Minister Han Sung-chu said on 1 April, 
Washington time, that the UN Security Council's adoption of the 
president's statement raised the possibility of resolving the 
North Korean nuclear issue through dialogue. Minister Han said 
this at a news conference he gave to ROK correspondents at the 
National Press Club in Washington after holding talks with U.S. 
Secretary of Defense William Perry. He also said: "We attach 
more significance to the measures -- which may be taken by the 
UN Security Council -- than to dialogue." He added: "The 
government has no plan for now to propose a diplomatic 
initiative to Pyongyang." 
  The following are questions posed and the answers: 
  Question: What has happened to the ROK-U.S. 
coordination of views on the Team Spirit exercise? 
  Han Sung-chu: North Korea has not fulfilled its 
agreement with the United States. This has created 
circumstances under which we can cancel our plan to withhold the 
exercise. However, a final decision will be announced after 
consultations between the ROK and the United States which will 
be held when U.S. Secretary of Defense William Perry visits the 
ROK. 
  Question: The signing of the contract to purchase 
Patriot missiles is reportedly imminent. Can you comment? 
  Han: That is absolutely not true. We did not buy 
those Patriot missiles to be deployed in the ROK: The United 
States deploys them because the U.S. Forces in the ROK need them. 
  Question: What do you think of Secretary Perry's 
strong remarks toward North Korea? 
  Han: He said portions of his full remarks were 
reported after being exaggerated. He also said he stressed a 
need to maintain a deterrent or defensive capability depending 
on the future situation. 
  Question: Did President Kim Yong-sam not give you 
the mission of having a resolution passed at the UN Security 
Council? 
  Han: UN Security Council discussions are 
multilateral. Therefore, no country can have its hope fulfilled 
100 percent. Our country had tried to have a resolution passed 
at the UN Security Council. However, one must not overlook the 
fact that the recently- passed statement of the Security Council 
president contains more substantial details. 
  Question: Do you have any hidden card for 
resolving the North Korean nuclear issue? 
  Han: The North Korean nuclear issue is complex and 
has no special remedy. Therefore, I would like to highly assess 
the Security Council president's statement because the statement 
has made it possible to start discussions on the nuclear issue 
again. 
  Question: Is the troop reinforcement, which 
Secretary Perry has referred to, an irrevocable, final decision? 
  Han: I do not think so. 
  Question: How will our diplomacy be carried out 
for a few weeks from now? 
  Han: First of all, I think, China will make 
efforts to make North Korea correctly realize the message 
contained in the president's statement, and the contact between 
the International Atomic Energy Agency [IAEA] and North Korea 
will possibly resume. I believe that if nuclear inspections are 
completed in this course, the possibility of resolving the North 
Korean nuclear issue will arise. 
  Question: When do you think North Korea will 
receive further inspections? 
  Han: We think there is a deadline in actuality 
even though one was not mentioned in the statement. The fact 
that the IAEA believes that inspections must resume in six weeks 
is a good point for consideration.

    [Editorial Report] ROK vernacular newspapers on 29 March 
carry editorials and articles on ROK Foreign Minister Han 
Sung-chu's "hasty" support for the PRC proposal that the UN 
Security Council president issue a statement on the North Korean 
nuclear issue instead of a resolution. 
  The moderate CHOSON ILBO publishes on page 3 an 800-word 
editorial entitled "Diplomatic Authorities Should Watch Their 
Words." While positively recognizing the significance of 
China's new proposal, the editorial says it is "strategically 
and technically" inappropriate for ROK diplomats to say "yes" so 
promptly. 
  The editorial questions if Minister Han had sufficient 
discussion with security-related ministers regarding this issue, 
and even if he had, the editorial says before conveying 
acceptance, the ROK should have persistently asked China what it 
will do when sanctions on North Korea become inevitable even 
after a UN Security Council president's statement. 
  The editorial also mentions the possibility of having China 
accept more of ROK's position on economic cooperation since the 
ROK accepted China's opinion on the nuclear issue. 
  The moderate HANGUK ILBO publishes on page 3 an 800-word 
editorial entitled "Even Though A Cooperation System on the 
North Korean Nuclear Issue Is Established." The editorial 
criticizes that "China is using the North Korean nuclear issue 
to obtain better conditions in its negotiations on human rights 
and most-favored-nation status with the United States, and 
economic cooperation with the ROK." 
  Noting that the United States, United Kingdom, France, and 
Russia have exerted their own efforts to resolve the nuclear 
issue, the editorial defines Minister Han's support without 
consultation with allies as a "hasty" decision. 
  The editorial further stresses that if a statement is to be 
adopted, it should strongly urge North Korea to accept 
additional inspection, resume North-South dialogue, and provide 
a fixed deadline. 
  HANGUK ILBO also publishes on page 5 a 1,000-word article 
dispatched from UN headquarters by correspondent Kim Su-chong. 
The article observes that 15 member states of the UN Security 
Council are inclined to agree to China's proposal and that the 
United States would have no reason to insist on a resolution 
when the ROK supports the new proposal. 
  The article then details the points to which China disagreed 
from the draft resolution and its proposal of "a positive, 
objective, and moderate expression." 
  The article reports that interests will be focused on 
China's 
role after the statement is adopted. Recalling that China said 
it was not in a position to exercise influence on North Korea 
last year, the article analyzes that China has changed its 
attitude by telling the ROK permanent representative to the 
United Nations that "China is exerting its efforts needed in the 
situation."

    [Editorial Report] Seoul vernacular newspapers on 28 March 
carry articles and editorials on China's new proposal for a 
solution to the DPRK nuclear issue. 
  The moderate TONG-A ILBO publishes on page 3 a 1,800-word 
article by correspondent Kim Cha-un from UN Headquarters under 
the headline, "The Significance of the Alternative Plan on the 
`Statement in the Name of the President of the UN Security 
Council.'" 
  Noting that with the "new alternative plan" proposed by 
China 
on 25 March regarding the UN Security Council moves for adoption 
of a resolution on North Korea, discussion of the North Korean 
nuclear issue at the council has entered "a new phase," the 
article predicts that this proposal will bring about "a 
temporary stumbling block" in the West's plan to cope with North 
Korea in the future, and shows doubt as to whether North Korea 
will "obediently follow" the statement of the president of the 
UN Security Council which has no "binding force," unlike the 
resolution. The article also points out a possibility that this 
plan may "spoil" the atmosphere of the international community's 
"hardline measures" against the North Korean nuclear issue by 
giving North Korea time to drag on the issue. In spite of this, 
the article notes the recent Chinese proposal is winning "more 
affirmative reaction" by the West, and illustrates the reason 
for this as follows: First, with this proposal, one can sense 
that China's basic position on the North Korean nuclear issue is 
"changing" and that China agrees with the UN Security Council's 
"interference in and action" for the North Korean nuclear issue. 
Second, the West is hoping that such a change in China's 
attitude will exercise "a decisive influence" on North Korea, 
because China's supoport for a statement by the president of the 
UN Security Council means that China raises the "same voice" 
with the United States and other Western countries "opposing" 
North Korean nuclear development. Third, Western diplomats 
believe that China's "joining" in the efforts of the security 
council for a solution to the North Korean nuclear issue is 
"more important" than anything else. Thus, it is highly likely 
that the West will "accept" the Chinese proposal for adopting 
the statement of the council president during negotiations with 
the Chinese side next week. The article predicts, however, that 
the two sides will have a "tug of war" over the "contents" to be 
included in the statement. 
  The TONG-A ILBO also carries on page 3 a 1,300-word article 
by reporter Kim Cha-su, entitled "The Government's Position on 
the 'Alternative Plan Proposed by China.'" The article notes 
that the government showed an "affirmative reaction" to the 
Chinese proposal for adopting a statement to be issued in the 
name of the UN Security Council president because it believes 
that "winning support from China" is "more important" than 
anything else. The government hopes, the article writes, that 
the "same voice" raised not only by the five permanent committee 
members of the security council, including China, but also the 
10 non-permanent committee members, will work as even "greater 
pressure" on North Korea. 
  The article observes that the purpose of the Chinese side in 
proposing the statement is to give North Korea "room" to accept 
an "additional inspection" and that by doing this, China will be 
able to explain to North Korea that if North Korea does not 
"comply with" the demand of the international community, China 
can "no longer" stand only on the side of North Korea. The 
government, however, maintains that the "contents" of the 
statement proposed by China should not be "remarkably" different 
from "a draft resolution" pushed by the security council's 
permanent members including the United States, and that the 
statement should include a content clarifying that "next-stage 
steps" will be taken according to the North Korean "attitude," 
referring to the remarks of the IAEA director-general that if 
another inspection of North Korean nuclear facilities is not 
conducted within six weeks, safeguards are highly likely to be 
"suspended." The article points out that during the ROK-PRC 
summit in Beijing, the ROK will ask China to support the 
security council's resolution in return for the ROK's acceptance 
of the Chinese proposal. ROK Foreign Minister Han Sung-chu will 
bring the result of his talks with Chinese leaders to the United 
States and based on this, will discuss "measures" henceforth 
with the security council's permanent members, including the 
United States. 
  The TONG-A ILBO also carries on page 3 a 1,300-word 
editorial 
under the headline, "A Pitfall in the Resumption of Dialogue." 
Pointing to "affirmative" moves of the UN Security Council and 
the ROK Government concerning the new Chinese proposal, the 
editorial writes that with emphasis put only on the nuclear 
issue, the issue regarding "tension" between the North and the 
South Korea has been "put aside," and denounces North Korea's 
"persistent refusal" of inter-Korean dialogue and recent remarks 
on "Seoul becoming a sea of fire." The editorial says that there 
is a "high possibility" that North Korea's "antinational, 
menacing act" may be "overlooked" if North Korea expresses 
"readiness" to accept additional inspection, changing its 
attitude. But the editorial urges the North to "apologize" for 
its "abnormal acts" and to basically change its attitude, so 
that it may be recognized as "a dialogue partner." 
  The moderate CHUNGANG ILBO publishes on page 3 a 1,200-word 
editorial under the headline, "How Long Should We Put Up With 
the Statement of the Security Council's President?" The 
editorial notes that with China's proposal for a security 
council president's statement, the North Korean nuclear issue 
will likely return to the "condition of one year ago" because 
the North has not shown any change in its attitude, and 
expresses "doubt" as to whether the ROK Government's support for 
the Chinese proposal is "appropriate." Criticizing the 
government's "excessive appeasement attitude," the editorial 
stresses that the "stick," while not necessarily meaning 
"confrontation," is more effective for bringing North Korea to 
the dialogue table.

    [Editorial Report] The following is a compilation of 
editorials carried by ROK vernacular newspapers on 2 April 
commenting on the UN Security Council's adoption of a 
president's statement on the North Korean nuclear issue. 
  The conservative CHOSON ILBO carries on page 3 an 800-word 
editorial entitled "Aftermath of the President's Statement." 
  The editorial first describes the president's statement as 
the "first stick," because the statement contains the UN 
Security Council's "clear will" to demand that North Korea 
receive nuclear inspections. The editorial adds that North 
Korea must know it will be a "loser" if it thinks it still has 
time to "maneuver." The editorial writes: "If North Korea 
continuously uses its nuclear card, the international community 
will become more and more wary of North Korea. North Korea 
must be trustworthy if it wants economic cooperation with the 
international community. North Korea has given rise to nuclear 
suspicions and, thus, tarnished its image. This is tantamount 
to destroying a basis for economic cooperation." 
  The editorial continues that it is time the government 
sincerely goes through a reexamination, writing: "It must no 
longer be lured by optimistic or romantic approaches." 
  The moderate TONG-A ILBO carries on page 3 an 800-word 
editorial entitled: "Aftermath of the UN Security Council 
President's Statement." 
  The editorial first advises that North Korea "will not 
ignore" the statement on the grounds that the statement is 
nonbinding. The editorial then asks North Korea to "pay 
attention to" the UN Security Council recommendation that 
North-South negotiations be resumed to implement the joint 
denuclearization declaration. 
  Referring to the U.S. media report that it is all right even 
if special envoys are exchanged during or after the DPRK-U.S. 
talks, the editorial writes that "this idea will only satisfy 
North Korea, which pursues a policy of thoroughly excluding 
South Korea from all negotiations." The editorial finally asks 
the ROK Government to "maintain consistency" in dealing with the 
North Korean nuclear issue, instead of running about in 
confusion. 
  The moderate HANGUK ILBO carries on page 3 an 800-word 
editorial entitled: "UN Security Council Statement." 
  The editorial writes that as a result of the adoption of the 
statement, the "ball is again in North Korea's court." It says: 
"It is clear that the UN Security Council will seek the adoption 
of a resolution on sanctions against North Korea if North Korea 
does not receive nuclear inspections. Therefore, time will not 
always be on the North Korean side. Because North Korea's 
efforts to indefinitely resist the pressure has its limits, it 
must know that the sooner it decides to receive nuclear 
inspections and resume North-South dialogue, the more beneficial 
it will be." 
  The pro-government SEOUL SINMUN carries on page 3 an 
800-word 
editorial entitled: "It is Time China Persuades North Korea To 
Receive Nuclear Inspections." 
  The editorial first expresses its discontent over China's 
excessive protection of North Korea regarding the nuclear issue 
and refers to China's responsibility for this issues. It 
writes: "China preferred the adoption of a statement, a moderate 
approach, at the UN Security Council, while insisting on 
dialogue, and our country and the world accepted China's idea. 
Therefore, complying with the spirit of the statement, China 
must persuade North Korea to accept the international 
community's demand before the UN Security Council resumes 
deliberations and adopts a resolution on sanctions." 
  The editorial concludes: "North Korea will not be able to go 
scot-free [musa halsu opta] without ensuring nuclear 
transparency. It would be wise to accept the UN recommendation 
and China's persuasion." 
  The left-leaning HANGYORE SINMUN carries on page 3 an 
800-word editorial entitled: "Government's Chaotic `Solution' to 
the Nuclear Problem." 
  The editorial first describes the chaotic situation 
regarding 
the North Korean nuclear issue due to the ROK Government's 
frequent changes in policies. Referring to U.S. Secretary of 
Defense Perry's remarks that the United States would prevent 
North Korea from developing nuclear weapons even if it requires 
that the United States wages another war on the Korean 
peninsula, the editorial asks who will pay the price for such a 
war. Commenting on the government's position that the statement 
will express the international community's view on the North 
Korean nuclear issue to North Korea, the editorial asks the ROK 
Government to solidify its basic policy on the North Korean 
nuclear issue.

<F P=106> [Interview with IAEA Director General Hans Blix by Gerhard </F>
Bitzan; place and date not given: "North Korea Must allow 
Nuclear Inspections"] 
  [Text] Bitzan: How strong is the nuclear 
threat today after the end of the Cold War? 
  Blix: If I take a look at the international 
media, I actually have the feeling that the spread of nuclear 
weapons is the biggest danger in the world, and that there are 
numerous states in the world that are only waiting to buy or 
build their own nuclear weapons -- without any control. 
However, one must also see the progress: A number of former 
risk states, including Brazil or Argentina, but also South 
Africa, have voluntarily given up their nuclear ambitions. 
There will be nuclear-free zones in Africa and Latin America, 
and even in the Middle East, talks on such a zone are under way. 
  Bitzan: Has the collapse of the Soviet Union not 
made the proliferation of nuclear weapons uncontrollable? 
  Blix: It has certainly increased the danger. 
Ukraine, for example, has not joined the Nuclear 
Nonproliferation Treaty. Then there is also the risk of the 
"leakage" of know-how and of nuclear material from the former 
USSR. Yet so far we have not seen a single case of the illegal 
export of enriched uranium, which is required for atomic bombs. 
As far as plutonium is concerned, the quantities were very, 
very small -- grams or milligrams. 
  An increasing number of developing countries are able to 
develop nuclear weapons if they use all their funds on this 
project. Yet the danger that has often been conjured up -- that 
this could happen overnight -- does not exist at all. 
  Bitzan: Do you believe that Saddam Husayn might 
again build a bomb? 
  Blix: After many years of work, we reassessed 
Iraq's nuclear program. We know how the supply worked, where 
the materials and the know-how came from. We are certain that 
something like that will not happen again as long as the control 
continues. 
  Bitzan: What were the reasons for the differences 
between the IAEA and North Korea? 
  Blix: During inspections and analyses, we 
discovered, as early as in 1992, that more plutonium existed 
than was declared. Only a few additional grams, but also 
kilograms might be involved. We do not know. This is an 
unpleasant development and it strengthens our doubts regarding 
their statements. Our long-term problem is: How much plutonium 
do they possess beyond the quantities already declared, and 
where is it? 
  The current conflict has a different background. Our 
inspections were stopped at the most important site -- in the 
laboratory where used fuel rods are being separated and 
reprocessed. We were not allowed to carry out the required 
tests. 
  North Korea cited the fact that the inspectors demanded more 
than was stipulated in the agreement as one reason for its 
behavior. This is a completely unfounded accusation. At the 
moment there are no positive signs coming from Pyongyang. 
  Bitzan: Will there be any sanctions? 
  Blix: The initiative now lies with the UN 
Security Council. There is the firm wish among the Security 
Council to urge North Korea to allow the inspections. However, 
I do not think that there is currently a tendency toward 
sanctions. Nor do I believe that the United States is 
interested in a military escalation. It is making great efforts 
to explain that the "Patriots" are only of a defensive nature, 
and that they are only the response to the harsh language of the 
North. 
  Bitzan: North Korea has repeatedly threatened to 
leave the Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty. Has this danger now 
increased? 
  Blix: North Korea has threatened to do so, but so 
far it has refrained from taking such a provocative step. 
However, this would not change the reality: The world wants to 
ensure that it cannot produce any nuclear weapons. The pressure 
on Pyongyang would be the same.

  [Excerpts] Vienna, April 5 (AFP) -- North Korea's 
development of a second plutonium production line indicates that 
the Stalinist state is determined to pursue an "active 
programme" of nuclear weapons production, IAEA official David 
Kyd warned Tuesday [5 April]. 
  Kyd said inspectors of the International Atomic Energy 
Agency 
visiting the radio-chemical laboratory at Yongbyon, 90 
kilometres (55 miles) north of Pyongyang, last month had 
observed that a second plutonium separation line was being 
constructed, similar to the first line which was subject to IAEA 
monitoring. 
  The new line meant that the North Korean programme could 
evade effective monitoring, Kyd said. 
  "This is of concern to us," he said. "It means North Korea 
is 
pursuing an active programme, while the United States and the 
IAEA were hoping that it would put its nuclear activities on 
hold." [passage omitted] 
  Kyd said IAEA chief Hans Blix had verbally notified the IAEA 
governors of the discovery at a council meeting on March 21, and 
had also informed the UN Security Council. 
  The Security Council and IAEA officials were hoping a new 
mission could be sent to North Korea at the beginning of May, 
Kyd said. However there were currently no contacts between 
Pyongyang and the IAEA. [passage omitted]

<F P=106> ["YONHAP report from New Delhi"] </F>
  [Text] North Korean Ambassador to India Cha Pong-chu said 
today that North Korea has no intention to accept additional 
inspections even though the UN Security Council is demanding 
additional inspections on North Korea through its presidential 
statement. 
  Ambassador Cha made it clear today that North Korea has no 
intention to accept additional inspections by saying that North 
Korea had already shown everything that needed to be open, and 
that the International Atomic Energy Agency is making an 
unreasonable demand to North Korea even though it has been 
proven through inspections that there were no problems of 
nuclear weapons development. 
  Ambassador Cha also strongly implied the possibility of 
nuclear weapons development by North Korea by saying that it is 
no longer a secret that the ROK and Japan are developing nuclear 
weapons, and that Japan's nuclear armament is particularly a 
serious problem and if North Korea developed nuclear weapons, it 
would be basically to restrain [kyonje] Japan.

Camouflage"] 
  [Text] Vienna -- "On 15 February, North Korea promised in 
writing that we could take samples and do tests in the radio 
chemical laboratory to make sure that no plutonium was taken out 
in the past 12 months. Without this promise, our inspectors 
would not have gone to North Korea in March," David Kyd, 
spokesman of the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), told 
DER STANDARD on Tuesday [5 April]. These samples are absolutely 
necessary since the seal has been broken and the checking 
devices installed by the IAEA have expired. 
  On the issue of using satellite photos, Kyd said that after 
the Gulf war, the IAEA Council of Governors adopted a written 
resolution saying that the IAEA shall be given access to all 
"additional information," which includes satellite photos, 
intelligence reports, and information by nuclear experts. After 
all, the experience with Iraq has shown that the declaration of 
nuclear installations by individual states is not sufficient. 
The Council of Governors' resolution applies to all states that 
have signed an inspection agreement with the IAEA, and this 
includes North Korea. 
  "South Africa did not oppose satellite photos," Kyd said. 
"But North Korea is annoyed because the photos come from the 
United States." 
  On the two mysterious installations in Yongbyon, Kyd said: 
"Satellite photos have shown that these installations were 
suddenly covered with soil and plants so they would be 
camouflaged before our first inspection in 1992. If they really 
are just military installations, then why are they not showing 
them to us?"

  [Text] Russian Ambassador to Seoul Georgiy F. Kunadze has 
warned that the South Korean decision to resume its joint 
military exercise with the United States, Team Spirit, and to 
deploy the Patriot antimissile system might be taken by North 
Korea as "provocative" and therefore, lead it to misjudge the 
South's real intentions. 
  "If they do see these steps as provocative, won't they make 
some final conclusions on the basis of that kind of opinion?" he 
said in an interview with THE KOREA HERALD. 
  The envoy also doubted whether the decision to take the 
steps 
would be effective in ensuring North Korea's full acceptance of 
international nuclear inspections. 
  "From the viewpoint of a citizen of a third country, I would 
say that I wonder about the strategic value and military 
importance of these exercises and these missiles to be 
introduced into South Korea," he said. 
  Kunadze called for more efforts toward a peaceful solution 
of 
the problem, saying that related countries still have time to 
explore additional possibilities to persuade North Korea to be 
"reasonable." 
  He said efforts not to further isolate North Korea are as 
important as strong and decisive actions against it. 
  But he does not agree with the so-called package deal 
between 
North Korea and the United States, which implies a linkage in 
negotiations. 
  "Out of my personal conviction as a diplomat and also a 
student of international relations, I'm not in favor of package 
deals. I'm not in favor of a linkage as a tool of diplomacy." 
  Russia, however, would not oppose a U.N. Security Council 
decision to impose punitive actions against North Korea, he said. 
  He said the council needs a consensus among members in order 
to decide any measures concerning Pyongyang's nuclear program. 
  The Russian government is not going to stand in the way of 
consensus at the council, "whatever this consensus is," the 
ambassador noted. 
  Kunadze came here in January but had been well-known in 
Korea 
before then. He had visited here six times as a senior 
researcher of the Institute of World Economy and International 
Relations (IMEMO) and as a vice foreign minister later. 
  He was one of the Russians who arranged Moscow visits in 
1989 
and 1990 by President Kim Yong-sam, who was then a political 
leader. 
  "My modest part can be described as facilitating the 
meetings 
between Mr. Kim Yong-sam and Soviet leaders," he said about his 
role. 
  Kunadze said the President said he would like to visit 
Moscow 
this year when he met him at Chongwadae in February to present 
his credentials. But he did not reveal when Kim plans to go to 
Moscow. Earlier reports said the visit will occur sometime in 
June. 
  The ambassador hoped that Seoul and Moscow conclude 
negotiations on financial compensation for the land that was 
owned by the Russian Legation from the end of the 19th century 
but now belongs to the Korean government or individuals before 
the President visits Russia. 
  Kunadze reaffirmed that Russia, despite its friendship and 
mutual assistance treaty with North Korea, would not help it if 
the Communist country attempted some kind of attack on another 
nation. 
  But he made it clear that Moscow would not discard the 
treaty, saying, "Russia, being a successor state to the former 
Soviet Union, is not in the position to abrogate any kind of 
international agreements" that it had concluded with others. 
  The treaty signed between the former Soviet Union and North 
Korea in the 1960s provides a security guarantee for North Korea 
in case of unprovoked attacks from the outside. 
  Kunadze claimed that this pact would not encourage North 
Korea to commit itself to any irresponsible behavior. 
  Concerning the issue of North Korean refugees who fled from 
logging camps in Siberia, the ambassador said Moscow has never 
been formally consulted by Seoul on that matter. 
  He said Russia would not object if South Korea decides to 
accept the refugees. 
  He said Moscow does not consider this issue in a political 
context but sees it as a matter related to human rights. He 
said Russian laws do not restrict travel by foreigners with 
valid passports, and therefore the Seoul government is the one 
which should make a decision. 
  The envoy called on South Koreans to study the Russian 
offers 
to repay Seoul's $1.47 billion loans on a purely commercial 
basis. 
  He said in any commercial deal, what counts most are quality 
and price. That apparently includes deals in Russian weaponry 
provided it is competitive in price and good in quality. 
  "I do not think any political strings should be attached to 
the forthcoming deals either on the side of the Russian 
government or on the side of Koreans," he said. 
  He does not see any political obstacles to developing 
relations with Korea in any fields including military technology 
transfer, the envoy added.

<F P=106> [Roundtable "Discussion" program with Nobuo Matsunaga, </F>
government representative and former ambassador to the United 
States; Keio University Professors Masao Okonogi and Tomoyuki 
Kojima; Kan Indoku, chief of the ROK Far East Affairs Institute, 
in Seoul; Larry Nikshu, member of the U.S. Congress Research 
Bureau, in Washington; and William Taylor, deputy chief of the 
U.S. Strategic International Affairs Institute, in Seoul -- all 
identified by caption, moderated by NHK commentator Takashi 
Yamamoto and reporter Sato] 
  [Excerpts] Yamamoto: Mr. Matsunaga, do you 
think the situation involving North Korea has returned to that 
of a year ago when it announced its withdrawal from the Nuclear 
Non-Proliferation Treaty [NPT], or has the situation worsened? 
  Matsunaga: As you know, tension in the world has 
now eased following the end of the Cold War. However, there are 
conflicts and disputes in various regions, and tension is now 
growing in certain places. I have the impression that tension 
on the Korean peninsula is mounting. While North Korea 
retracted its announcement on the withdrawal from the NPT, it 
took coercive actions. For this reason, I think the tension is 
now growing as compared with the situation a year ago. However, 
we should not lose our hope even under such circumstances. 
[passage omitted on remarks by other participants] 
  Yamamoto: Mr. Taylor said that North Korea is 
just engaging in its conventional diplomatic policies as it has 
done before. Mr. Matsunaga, why do you think North Korea 
rejected inspection of its nuclear facilities by the 
International Atomic Energy Agency? 
  Matsunaga: I think the country is trying to 
display its diplomatic power by hinting at the possibility of 
its developing nuclear weapons. We need to consider why North 
Korea is trying to do so. I think its top priority task is to 
secure its existence and development. I believe that, to that 
end, it intends to make utmost use of the suspicion of its 
nuclear development program. The international community 
probably thinks North Korea's nuclear capability itself -- when 
assumed that the nation possesses nuclear arms -- is not 
relatively large. However, even if a nuclear weapon is a 
single-shot one, it will produce an unfathomable impact if it is 
used. For this reason, North Korea's suspected nuclear 
development involves danger. What is most important is that a 
certain misunderstanding or other factors will not serve as an 
impetus to the outbreak of some incidents. To that end, I think 
Japan, South Korea, the United States, China, and Russia need to 
make additional efforts to persuade North Korea to dispel 
suspicion about it. [passage omitted on remarks by other 
participants] 
  Yamamoto: We do not understand well why North 
Korea is trying to develop nuclear arms. What do you think of 
it? 
  Matsunaga: Mr. Okonogi stated earlier that he had 
thought North Korea was playing for time. I still believe it is 
just playing for time in view of its serious economic situation. 
While the political situation in North Korea is not reportedly 
bad, its economic situation is very serious. I have no choice 
but to say North Korea's economic power is rapidly declining in 
the East Asian region. Its greatest concern probably is to 
secure its existence. In that sense, its leaders have a feeling 
of crisis now. They think it will take much time to overcome 
this sense of crisis. Moreover, it is said that change of power 
will take place in North Korea from Kim Il-song to Kim Chong-il. 
In this sense, North Korea is in a transition period. I think 
this is one of the reasons why they feel a growing sense of 
crisis. Then, why do they have to prepare themselves for the 
change while feeling a sense of crisis? Well, Russia, China, 
the ROK, and Japan are North Korea's neighboring countries. Of 
them, Russia and China have nuclear weapons. Japan and the ROK, 
although they do not have nuclear weapons, are under the 
American nuclear umbrella. Therefore, I am of the opinion that 
the North Koreans think that there is great danger that this 
tension will continue to grow and eventually explode somewhere 
unless they do something about it. 
  Yamamoto: What does the international society 
have to do to deal with North Korea if that is the case? 
  Matsunaga: As Mr. Taylor has pointed out, I think 
that primarily, North Korea has to make its existence known to 
the international society and to seek development while 
cooperating with the international society. But, the North 
Korean leaders may be feeling that they do not have a chance to 
do that. I am sure they realize that the nuclear weapons 
development is not beneficial to North Korea at all. However, 
we can explain the current situation only from the viewpoint 
that they feel a sense of crisis. 
  Sato: I think that the ROK, although the United 
States withdrew its nuclear arms from there, feels that it is 
still under the U.S. nuclear umbrella. The DPRK-USSR trade 
accord is actually invalid. It still has a trade agreement with 
China. Do you think North Korea feel unsafe in this situation? 
  Matsunaga: I do not think it does. North Korea 
cannot count on Russia, former Soviet Union. Its reliance on 
Russia is rapidly decreasing. China is the only remaining 
partner. I think, however, the North Korean leaders do not want 
to be placed completely under China's protection. I think they 
want to have a free hand. 
  Yamamoto: Now, I would like to move to the issue 
of how the issue of North Korean nuclear weapons will develop. 
Various negotiations are being held at the UN Security Council. 
Reporter Sato will explain how the things may develop. 
[passage omitted on Sato's explanations and remarks by other 
participants] 
  Yamamoto: Mr. Matsunaga, Japan and the ROK agreed 
at the summit talks that Japan, the ROK, China, and the United 
States have to cooperate to break the current deadlock. What 
role can Japan play in such a situation? 
  Matsunaga: As has been pointed out, I think it is 
correct for Japan, the ROK, and the United States to cooperate 
with each other to find out North Korea's true intentions. 
However, it is true also that China is the biggest influential 
power. This is very important in terms of two viewpoints. 
First, North Korea is in confrontational ties with Japan, the 
ROK, and the United States, although its ties with each of the 
three countries differ slightly. In this sense, Japan, the ROK, 
and the United States are not friendly countries to North Korea. 
However, China is different. It has ties of friendship and 
trust with North Korea. Therefore, China has the strongest 
persuasive power. 
  Second, North Korea is relying 100 percent on China for 
energy, which is indispensable to North Korean economy. In this 
sense, China has a trump card. Therefore, I think it wields 
the strongest persuasive power. As Mr. Okonagi said, China's 
prestige will go up if it uses this trump card to change North 
Korea to act in a reasonable manner. The important thing is 
that we need to support China. I think Japan needs to think 
about cooperating with China. 
  As for the UN response to North Korea's suspected 
development 
of nuclear weapons, I think that discussions at the United 
Nations or the Security Council will have significant effect in 
terms of generating public opinion in the international 
community. Its policies are isolating North Korea in the 
international society. Its Isolation is not beneficial at all to 
the international society as a whole. We need to bring it back 
to the international society. I think China has major 
influential power to do that, too. Therefore, Japan needs to 
assume the stand of supporting China. 
  Yamamoto: You mean that Japan needs to work with 
China, right? 
  Matsunaga: Yes, I mean to work with China. 
  Yamamoto: As we discussed earlier, the UN 
Security Council will gradually introduce necessary measures to 
deal with North Korea. How do you think Japan should respond if 
the Security Council asks it to join in economic sanctions 
against North Korea? 
  Matsunaga: Fundamentally speaking, Japan has to 
support 100 percent and cooperate with the United Nations if it 
decides to impose sanctions against North Korea. However, the 
reality is that we have to go through many steps before that. I 
also think there is a limit to the effect of sanctions. 
Therefore, I am of the opinion that we should not rely on 
sanctions alone. It is important for us to make efficient use 
of peaceful approaches, such as discussions and the persuasive 
power. [passage omitted on remarks by other participants] 
  Yamamoto: Mr. Matsunaga, it seems that Japan will 
be forced to make difficult decisions and be asked, depending on 
the situation in the future, to cooperate with the United 
Nations in military actions. What do you think of this issue? 
  Matsunaga: Japan is a U.S. ally. It made it clear 
that it would fully support and cooperate with the United 
States. But, it has to avoid the possibility of sending wrong 
signals to North Korea. On the other hand, Japan also fully 
supports the ROK's stance. I think we should continue to do 
that. 
  On the other hand, we hope for true peace and stability on 
the Korean peninsula. To realize that, Japan and North Korea 
need to normalize their diplomatic ties first. We started 
negotiations for normalization of diplomatic ties between the 
two countries. But, the North Korean officials walked out of 
the negotiations two years ago. Needless to say, they have to 
take Japan's economic power into consideration. I think it is 
very important for North Korea to decide, on the basis of cool 
judgment, to return to the negotiation table for normalization 
of diplomatic ties. I think China hopes that, too. 
  Yamamoto: The time is up for us. Thank you very 
much for joining in this program.

    [Editorial Report] The following is a compilation of 
editorials carried by ROK vernacular newspapers on 30 March 
commenting on the ROK-China discussion on the North Korean 
nuclear issue. 
  The conservative CHOSON ILBO carries on page 3 an 800-word 
editorial entitled "Does Our Position on the North Korean 
Nuclear Issue Change Again?" 
  The editorial refers to Chinese President Jiang Zemin's 
opposition to the resumption of the Team Spirit exercise and the 
deployment of Patriot missiles during his talks with ROK 
President Kim Yong-sam and writes: "This again shows that China 
consistently supports North Korea's position regarding the 
nuclear issue." The editorial asks the ROK Government to 
elaborate on what Jiang actually told President Kim Yong-sam 
during the talks and how the ROK responded to Jiang's remarks. 
  The editorial describes China's passive attitude toward 
international efforts to ensure North Korea's nuclear 
transparency and writes: "China turns a blind eye to the North 
Korean nuclear issue, which constitutes the most grave challenge 
to a post-cold war world, but intervenes, unfairly, into the 
ROK's defensive Team Spirit exercise and the deployment of 
Patriot missiles. We cannot understand this." The editorial 
writes the ROK's diplomacy has "lost its balance" by blindly 
believing that the resumption of the Team Spirit exercise may 
lead North Korea to withdraw from the Nuclear Nonproliferation 
Treaty or that the adoption of a resolution at the UN Security 
Council may incite North Korea. 
  The moderate TONG-A ILBO carries on page 3 a 800-word 
editorial entitled "Truth and Falsehood of Chinese-Style 
Solutions." 
  Citing the fact that President Kim Yong-sam stressed the 
nuclear issue during his visit to Japan, while stressing 
economic cooperation during his visit to China, the editorial 
writes: "Even though the leaders of Japan and China may have 
felt comfortable because of such an attitude, President Kim 
Yong-sam failed to make the valuable opportunities to meet with 
the leaders of the two countries more valuable." Describing the 
U.S.-DPRK talks, a package deal, and the use of persuasion 
regarding the North Korean nuclear issue as "Chinese-style 
solutions," the editorial writes that China's opposition to some 
points in a statement of the UN Security Council chairman is 
"disappointing" and describes China's opposition to the 
resumption of the Team Spirit exercise and the deployment of 
Patriot missiles during the summit talks as an "almost 
uncourteous act." The editorial concludes: "We are under the 
impression that our government relies on the Chinese-style 
solutions too heavily. It is necessary to examine whether China 
is using the North Korean nuclear issue as its diplomatic card." 
  The moderate CHUNGANG ILBO carries on page 3 an 800-word 
editorial entitled "Why Does the Policy on the North Korean 
Nuclear Issue Change Again?" 
  The editorial first describes the ROK's acceptance of 
China's 
preference for dialogue and its logic that "no one must incite 
North Korea" and writes that this means that the ROK was 
"persuaded" by China, instead of persuading China to accept the 
ROK's view. The editorial writes: "The ROK Government may have 
its own reason to change its nuclear policies. However, we 
cannot but express our worry that the chaos at home and abroad 
caused by this policy change may weaken the ROK's 
trustworthiness and cause a confusion in the security structure." 
  Citing ROK Ambassador to China Hwang Pyong-tae's remarks on 
the ROK's decision to discuss the nuclear issue with China, in 
addition to the United States, and to take joint action, the 
editorial writes this is "shocking" and may cause a "mess" in 
the ROK's diplomatic axis centering on the United States and 
Japan. After writing that all powerful countries in the ROK's 
neighborhood are competing to intervene in Korean peninsula 
affairs, the editorial concludes: "We already learned a century 
ago what invited competition among the powerful countries in our 
neighborhood and what resulted from that competition. Our 
country must not tremble in dealing with such important 
diplomatic issues as the North Korean nuclear issue."

  [Text] Bonn (DPA) -- Bonn has reacted with satisfaction to 
the intention of Brazil and Argentina to have their nuclear 
facilities regularly inspected by the International Atomic 
Energy Agency (IAEA) in Vienna in the future. On Wednesday [30 
March], well-informed circles referred to Germany's immediate 
interest, in view of scientific-technical cooperation with both 
countries in the field of the peaceful use of nuclear energy. 
  Peter Kurt Wuerzbach, disarmament policy spokesman of the 
Christian Democratic Union [CDU]/Christian Social Union [CSU] 
Bundestag Group, talked of a further important step to 
strengthen nuclear nonproliferation. Moreover, according to his 
information, Argentina, which, like Brazil, has not acceded to 
the Nonproliferation Treaty so far, announced that it wants to 
accede to the treaty. 
  Precisely against the background of the topical discussion 
on 
access to the nuclear facilities in North Korea, the CDU/CSU 
Bundestag Group regards this development as significant progress 
and an important contribution to stabilization and 
confidence-building in the region, the politician stressed. 
IAEA spokesman David Kyd had announced in HANNOVERSCHE 
ALLGEMEINE ZEITUNG that the control agreement with Brazil and 
Argentina will come into force in late spring and the first 
inspections can take place in the middle of the year. 
  Above all German-Brazilian cooperation in the nuclear 
sector, 
which was initiated in the seventies, continues to be 
controversial. The Social Democratic Party of Germany [SPD] 
repeatedly called for its abandonment because it feared that 
Brazil might work on the military use of nuclear power. This 
was repeatedly denied by the Federal Government. Originally, 
the German power plant builder Siemens-KWU [Kraftwerksunion] was 
supposed to build eight nuclear plants in the country. So far, 
the first plant "Angra II," whose construction was started as 
early as in 1976, has not yet been completed because of domestic 
policy problems. The enterprise supplied the power plant 
"Atucha" to Argentina.

peace negotiators. 
<H5>  Macao </H5>
  Macao police found a ``factory'' for making pager bombs 
during a raid on two robbers' apartment.

  [Text] The deputy central government representative in 
Mbale, Mr. Henry Rwigyemera, has strongly condemned the 
political thuggery exhibited yesterday by some political 
reactionaries who tried to assassinate the minister of tourism, 
wildlife and antiquity, Mr. James Wapakkabulo, last night, by 
throwing two hand grenades at his vehicles, killing one person 
and injuring 14 others, two of them critically. 
  One grenade was aimed at two vehicles belonging to the 
minister and his supporters and another at a minibus belonging 
to one of the minister's supporters. 
  Talking to a Kampala Radio Uganda Network reporter by 
telephone from Mbale, Mr. Rwigyemera assured the people of Mbale 
and the entire country that government authorities in Mbale have 
zeroed on those reactionaries and security precautions have 
[been] maximally undertaken to ensure that such acts of thuggery 
do not occur again, and that elections are not disrupted at all. 
  He disclosed that they are aware that the target area for 
the 
thugs are Mbale municipality, Bubulo east and west 
constituencies and Manjiya County. He said the cause of these 
is that the reactionaries have realized that they are in for a 
shock on Monday [28 March, contrary to the fallacy that Bugisu 
and eastern Uganda are their power base. He said that the thugs 
have also realized that the people can no longer be manipulated. 
  The central government representative expressed condolence 
to 
the relatives of the young man who was killed in the attack. He 
also expressed sympathy to the relatives of those who were 
injured.

<F P=106> [By Andrew Laxton] </F>
  [Text] Security at Kai Tak is open to abuse by terrorists 
and below standard for one of the world's busiest airports, 
claims a former chairman of Hong Kong's Security Association. 
  This month a man was able to slip through the airport and on 
to an empty Cathay Pacific jet unchallenged. When discovered, 
he was arrested and held by police. But just hours later, after 
being released, he returned to Kai Tak for a repeat performance. 
Airport police have played down the incident, describing it as 
``minor,'' but the chief executive of Hong Kong's biggest 
security company has expressed doubts over security. 
  ``Basic and cost-effective measures like passenger profiling 
and checking that boarding passes belong to the passport holder 
are non-existent,'' said Ted Devereux of Guardforce Ltd. ``This 
man has shown how easy it is to skip security at the airport. 
How easy would it be for a terrorist? I am sure the airport is 
well-equipped to deal with a terrorist attack but I am not 
confident it is good enough to prevent one, and that is what 
counts,'' he said. ``The security monopoly at Kai Tak needs to 
be defranchised. Competition would mean levels of security 
being raised in order to stay in business. With the runup to 
1997, how many people will try to leave Hong Kong illegally? If 
the situation continues, we will never know because security at 
the airport is not made accountable.'' 
  Mr. Devereux said Kai Tak should undertake a similar method 
used at all British airports on the instructions of the 
Department of Transport. They lay down a series of basic 
security steps which apparently work. When checking in, 
passengers are asked if they packed their case and whether they 
have left it unattended. Mr. Devereux said: ``While this is 
going on, your reactions are being watched and because scanning 
machines are not 100 percent reliable, you can often get a 
better idea of what is really inside the suitcase. This is 
called passenger screening and is devised to check whether a 
person is a bona fide traveller.'' During the recent incident 
at Kai Tak, the man was able to walk unchallenged through the 
airport, immigration booths, passenger screening, on to a 
shuttle bus and then an empty plane twice in one day. 
  ``For people to say we do not need to upgrade security is 
ridiculous,'' Mr. Devereux said. He also criticised the amount 
of machinery used at Kai Tak. While it was good equipment, he 
said, it needed regular calibration to keep it in working order. 
``But even this equipment is not 100 percent reliable so a lot 
of the detecting relies heavily on the skills of the operator,'' 
Mr. Devereux said. ``But the airport has a high turnover of 
staff within this area so there is no stability and you are 
constantly retraining people which takes time. Having all that 
expensive equipment down there is all very well and good but it 
did not stop this man getting through.'' 
  He added: ``Kai Tak is open to abuse by terrorists. This man 
has proved it twice in one day. Nobody really knows what is 
going on at the airport and that is why I feel security should 
be made accountable. We are talking about people's lives.'' 
  But a spokesman for the Security Branch said existing 
security arrangements at Kai Tak were satisfactory. ``All our 
passengers go through metal detectors and their hand luggage is 
scanned as well,'' the spokesman said. ``Because of the high 
number of people coming through Kai Tak, we are 100 percent 
satisfied with our system and consider this more effective than 
passenger profiling, which is a lengthy process. All our 
security procedures adhere to Annex 17 of the Chicago Convention 
on Airport Security. As regards to the so-called monopoly at 
the airport, any company can bid for the contract but they must 
match the very stringent standards required.''

  [Excerpts] Tokyo, April 1 KYODO -- [passage omitted] Police 
said the intruders, who have barricaded a corridor leading to 
the reception room, are members of the Taihikai right-wing 
group. Police identified one of the men as Kuniyasu Uchiyama, 
41, the group's deputy chairman. 
  Police said one of the men had fired a shot from a gun but 
no 
one was reported injured. 
  It was the second incident in five months at the 
mass-circulation ASAHI SHIMBUN headquarters involving the 
Taihikai. On 20 October, Shusuke Nomura, 58, the leader of the 
group, entered the building and shot himself dead during a 
meeting with the company's executives in protest over the use of 
a cartoon parodying his group in a weekly magazine affiliated 
with the company. 
  Police were negotiating with the rightists by telephone. 
They said the two Taihikai members later released eight 
hostages, but were still holding an executive in charge of the 
company's public relations department, Kei Aragaki, and the head 
of the secretarial department, Mikinori Yoshida. 
  They said the rightists were using potted plants to 
barricade 
the door to the room. 
  They identified the other rightist as Toshikazu Furusawa, 
29. 
  On 12 November 1991, police arrested Uchiyama after he set 
off a fire bomb in his own car outside the Tokyo residence of 
former Liberal Democratic Party power broker Shin Kanemaru. 
Uchiyama was carrying a sword at the time of the arrest.

  [Excerpts] Tokyo, April 1 KYODO -- Police Friday [1 April] 
arrested two rightists and rescued two people who had been held 
hostage for nearly six hours inside the ASAHI SHIMBUN newspaper 
headquarters in Tokyo. 
  Police identified the rightists as Kuniyasu Uchiyama, 41, 
and 
Toshikazu Furusawa, 29, both from the Taihikai right-wing group. 
  The two were arrested at around 7:10 p.m. [1010 GMT] 
Uchiyama 
was carrying a sword at the time of the arrest and police said 
they recovered four sticks of dynamite. 
  The two men had held Kei Aragaki, 57, an executive in charge 
of the company's public relations department, and Mikinori 
Yoshida, 51, the head of the secretarial department, in an 
executive reception room on the 15th floor, police said. 
  Before breaking into the building, the two rightists, 
carrying a sword, a handgun, and what they said were two sticks 
of dynamite, threatened a security guard with the handgun, 
police said. 
  Pamphlets distributed by the two men described the mass 
media 
as a ``class a war criminal'' and called on the ASAHI SHIMBUN to 
``amend the tone of its news coverage.'' 
  The pamphlets also criticized Prime Minister Morihiro 
Hosokawa for his failure to retract a statement apologizing for 
Japan's wartime activities in Asia which he said were ``a war of 
aggression.'' 
  Police said the rightists entered the building at about 1:30 
p.m., told the security guard the gun they had was not a fake 
and they wanted to meet the company's president. 
  Police said one of the men fired a shot when another 
security 
guard approached but no one was injured. 
  They then rode an elevator to the 15th floor where they used 
desks and potted plants to barricade themselves inside the 
executive reception room with the hostages. 
  Police said the two men arrested Friday told the security 
guard they are ``disciples'' of [Taihikhai leader] Nomura. 
Furusawa was Nomura's secretary and chauffeur. 
  He was present in the same room with Nomura and other ASAHI 
SHIMBUN executives when Nomura shot himself [in October 1993], 
police said.

<F P=106> [By Harald Bruning in Macao] </F>
  [Text] Macao police investigating a bungled armed holdup by 
two Chinese illegal immigrants have discovered what they 
described as a ``beeper bomb factory'' making bombs using 
pagers. It is the first time that police have come across the 
devices by a pager signal, the police spokesman, Major Jose 
Lourenco, said. ``It was not the work of amateurs, but of 
people who have a very precise knowledge of electronics and 
explosive devices,'' Lourenco said. 
  Two men, aged 25 and 27, were arrested by police after a 
raid 
on a flat in Rua do Almirante Costa Cabral at about 7am on 
Saturday [26 March]. They were expected to appear before Macao 
District Court today. A team of officers from the Macao public 
security police discovered 30 detonators, a Chinese-made Makarov 
pistol, 20 rounds of ammunition and an amount of explosives. 
  He said the men were arrested 24 hours after they had tried, 
unsuccessfully, to rob the Chan Hang frozen meat shop on Rua de 
Erva on Friday. The men left behind two pager bombs when they 
fled the shop after the proprietor bit one of them on the hand, 
triggering a gun shot that accidentally hit the other bandit. 
The bombs were defused by police but 15 minutes after they had 
been deactivated, the two pagers reacted to calls from the 
central paging station. 
  Macao police sources said that the pager bombs were 
``extremely worrying for their criminal cunning.'' ``Imagine 
someone putting a pager bomb somewhere in Macao, then after that 
travelling to China or Hong Kong and phoning from there to a 
pager station in Macao in order to trigger the explosion,'' one 
source said. ``You could call it cross-border remote control.'' 
  ``Theoretically, you can put a pager bomb somewhere in 
America, then you leave that continent to make your pager 
station call from Asia or Europe.''

  [Text] Twelve of 15 coaches of a rapid train from Bangkok 
heading for the southernmost district of Sungai Kolok were 
derailed by a bomb explosion early this morning. The incident 
took place in the vicinity of Village No. 2 of Tambon Phichit in 
Na Mom Subdistrict, Songkhla Province. Technicians from the 
State Railway of Thailand together with a number of high-ranking 
police officers and the Songkhla Province governor are now 
inspecting the site. There has been no report on damages or 
injuries. The area, which is in a valley, is relatively 
inaccessible. Many trains have been delayed because of the 
incident.

  [Text] Interior Minister General Chawalit Yongchaiyut has 
said that several bombing incidents as well as the sabotage of a 
train in Songkhla Province today are aimed at toppling the 
government. 
  This afternoon Gen. Chawalit called an urgent meeting of 
officials concerned with security issues. Afterward, he said 
the meeting agreed that more measures are needed to strengthen 
security in areas that could be targets of sabotage, 
particularly the four southern border provinces and Bangkok. 
The meeting also held that the motive behind the bombings is to 
destabilize the government. It did not discard the possibility, 
however, that these events are the work of separatists. 
  [Begin Chawalit recording, in progress] ...the 
situation occurred in areas that are probably target areas for 
harassment by the opposition. These target areas are Bangkok 
and the four southern provinces. Before setting clear measures 
to prevent a reoccurrence of these incidents, everyone at the 
meeting agreed that the main objective of the movement behind 
these events is to create confusion and worry and damage the 
government. [end recording]

<F P=106> [Interview with Khachatphai Burutphat, National Security </F>
Council Deputy Secretary general, by unidentified correspondent; 
place and date not given] 
  [Excerpts] 
  Correspondent: Does the recent spate of bombings 
indicate the country is having a security problem? 
  Khachatphai: [passage omitted] I wish to give the 
assurance that the country enjoys complete security. All the 
officials concerned have worked together closely to find the 
culprits and gather information to prevent the future occurrence 
of these problems. Security at various installations has been 
strengthened to prevent acts of terrorism. [passage omitted] 
  Correspondent: Does this mean that the performance 
of the officials concerned has not been effective? 
  Khachatphai: One must realize that there are 
people who look for opportunities to create trouble. They will 
carry out their work whenever an opportunity arises. Therefore, 
it is difficult to absolutely prevent every problem. 
Intelligence operations and security vigilance have been 
responsible for preventing many incidents. These types of 
operations, however, cannot be publicized. So, people do not 
know about the performance of such operations. Therefore, it is 
unfair to say that officials have been ineffective. 
  Correspondent: What are the causes of the bombings 
perpetrated by local or foreign elements? 
  Khachatphai: There are many causes for the bomb 
attacks carried out by Thais. Among them are personal conflicts 
and deliberate attempts to create a situation. [passage omitted] 
  Correspondent: Do international terrorist groups 
pick Thailand for their operations because they find it easy? 
  Khachatphai: Thai society, like in other liberal 
countries, is open. Tourists can travel where they please. 
Several million foreign tourists visit every year, in addition 
to more than 100,000 illegal arrivals. This is a weak point, 
but it does not mean that international terrorists pick Thailand 
because it is so easy to stage an incident. 
  Correspondent: Compared with Singapore and 
Malaysia whose societies are also open, why do terrorists pick 
on Thailand to carry out their sabotage activities? 
  Khachatphai: There are several factors 
international terrorists consider in choosing a country for 
their sabotage. One factor is their intended target. It is 
probably not true that security in those two countries is so 
good that it is impossible to carry out terrorist activities. 
The elaborate counterterrorist measures in the United States 
and the UK have not been able to completely prevent terrorist 
activities there. 
  Correspondent: In addition to foreign terrorist 
groups, are there local groups which complicate the sabotage 
picture? 
  Khachatphai: Possibly both. That is, there could 
be foreign terrorist groups which have targets in Thailand. 
Meanwhile, there are some local groups which aim to create 
public disorder. So, incidents affecting national peace and 
order could be created by any of these elements. Therefore, 
officials concerned must not relax and must be ready to prevent 
an incident and timely solve it if it happens. 
  Correspondent: What about groups which seek to 
topple the current government? 
  Khachatphai: The results of initial investigations 
have not linked groups seeking a political change to the 
disturbances. Normal incidents of disturbance are probably 
linked to personal disputes or to intimidation with some purpose 
in mind. Officials concerned are trying to verifying the 
causes. [passage omitted]

    [Editorial Report] The following is a compilation of 
reports on regional guerrilla activities monitored through 30 
March. 
  COLOMBIA 
  On 21 March, the 36th Front of the Revolutionary Armed 
Forces 
of Colombia (FARC) attacked government and police facilities in 
Angostura Municipality, Antioquia, killing one policeman and 
injuring two. In the attack, four FARC guerrillas were killed 
and four wounded. The guerrillas destroyed police headquarters, 
the municipal palace, the Agrarian Bank, and some homes. The 
rebels also cut off telephone communications during the attack. 
(Santa Fe de Bogota EL TIEMPO in Spanish 23 March 94 p 8A) 
  GUATEMALA 
  On 22 March, an ORPA (Revolutionary Organization of the 
People in Arms) guerrilla column partially burned La Igualdad 
farm at La Reforma, San Marcos Department, leaving three wounded 
soldiers and approximately 500,000 quetzales in damage. Eight 
rebels overpowered security personnel and demanded diesel to 
burn the owner's house, two coffee mills, and various vehicles. 
Another rebel group detonated a bomb, destroyed 125 quintals of 
coffee, and partially destroyed a coffee dryer. A military 
patrol from El Baluarte farm chased the rebels who had mined the 
road. A Claymore mine exploded, and one officer and two 
soldiers were critically injured. (Guatemala City PRENSA LIBRE 
in Spanish 23 March 94 p 91) 
  An eight-grenade explosive device was defused by the 
National 
Police at a bridge in Zone 12, south of Guatemala City. 
Policemen defused a Claymore mine, a type of mine used by 
Guatemalan rebels, near the same bridge. Morris Eugenio de 
Leon, a spokesman for the Army's Press and Information 
Department (DIDE), warned on Thursday that urban guerrilla group 
activities have again increased in the country. (Mexico City 
NOTIMEX in Spanish 2306 GMT 24 March 94) 
  NICARAGUA 
  Five of the men who killed Javier Barahona, political 
secretary of the Sandinist National Liberation Front in Wiwili, 
were killed on 26 March in El Venado, eight miles northeast of 
Wamblan, during a clash between Army and recontra forces. The 
dead recontras include Jose Davila Reyes, alias ``Omar,'' and 
``El Lobo,'' armed leaders who kidnapped Barahona in La Maranosa 
and later savagely murdered him in Aguas Rojas community. Major 
Juan Alberto Molinares, chief of staff of the IV Zone, reported 
five recontras were killed, six were wounded, and five AK-47 
rifles and backpacks were seized. (Managua BARRICADA in Spanish 
26 March 94 pp 1, 12)

  [Excerpt] The three Chilean and two Peruvian terrorists who 
were members of the Tupac Amaru Revolutionary Movement, and who 
were captured last year by DINCOTE [Counterterrorism 
Directorate], will serve life imprisonment penalties on charges 
of high treason. The decision was confirmed yesterday by the 
Special Military Court of the Peruvian Air Force, which reviewed 
the trial as an appellate court. 
  The penalty will be imposed on Chileans Jaime Francisco

  [Text] Lima, 27 Mar (EFE) -- The Peruvian media reported 
today that the Mexican Government has asked Peru to help their 
anti-terrorist struggle. 
  The Lima daily EXPRESO says that within the next few days 
two 
National Police Counterterrorism Directorate (Dincote) experts 
will travel to the Mexican capital with President Alberto 
Fujimori's authorization. 
  EXPRESO cites high-ranking police sources who state that the 
officers are Colonel Juan Gonzalez Sandoval and Lieutenant 
Colonel Alberto Sarmiento Gutierrez. 
  It adds that Gonzalez and Sarmiento will be in Mexico for at 
least 10 days. 
  Mexican officials want to learn the Peruvian way of facing a 
possible upsurge of the terrorist phenomenon following the 
Chiapas rebellion and the death of presidential candidate Luis 
Donaldo Colosio.

  [Text] Santa Fe de Bogota, 27 Mar (PL) -- Today, Colombian 
newspaper EL TIEMPO amended a report in which it linked the 
Cuban Government as well as a Colombian bishop to an alleged 
guerrilla summit. The newspaper also issued apologies to 
Havana, the prelate, and its readership. [see item PA1803032994 
in 22 March Terrorism Report] 
  After comparing and determining the credibility and 
authenticity of its source that prompted reports on an alleged 
trip to Cuba by Bishop Nel Beltran and a guerrilla summit being 
held on the island, EL TIEMPO decided to retract the report and 
apologize to the bishop and the Cuban Government. 
  The two-page apology published in Section 1 of the newspaper 
says, ``it was the victim of an ill-intentioned machination, the 
intellectual origins and objectives of which have yet to be 
determined.'' 
  The newspaper was referring to evidence alleging that a 
Colombian guerrilla summit took place in Cuba in January and in 
which Beltran participated. Reports on the alleged summit were 
published several days running, beginning on 10 March. 
  With respect to the summit, Prosecutor General Gustavo de 
Greiff also said he possessed ``irrefutable evidence,'' which EL 
TIEMPO itself indicated ``contributed to the disinformation.'' 
  The newspaper acknowledges the falsity of the reports, 
``despite the apparent accuracy of the information handed over 
by the initial source, confirmation by a reliable second source, 
and a state security agency's intelligence report that had been 
disclosed by a high-ranking government official.'' 
  EL TIEMPO also claims it relied on ``an endorsement from the 
Prosecutor General's Office.'' 
  It adds: ``By not contacting Bishop Nel Beltran, regardless 
of how difficult it may have been, Chief Editor Francisco Santos 
authorized the publication of the report without first 
subjecting it to essential screening to determine its accuracy.'' 
  The apology also indicates that ``the aggressiveness in what 
is known in journalistic circles as `fast breaking news' 
prompted this newspaper, its chief editor, and, in particular, 
its Legal Editor Edgar Torres to make erroneous decisions that 
ultimately led to the publication of false reports and 
subsequent recurrent reports on the same issue, which today we 
proceed to rectify.'' 
  The Santa Fe de Bogota paper adds: ``This, however, does not 
excuse the mistake, because by way of professional and sincere 
screening, as well as by meeting with those individuals 
mentioned in the report, we would have unmasked the source and 
avoided publishing misleading reports.'' 
  The Cuban Government, its embassy in Santa Fe de Bogota, and 
some of the highest-ranking Colombian authorities had repeatedly 
denied the disclosures. 
  Nevertheless, in light of certain evidence gathered by the 
Prosecutor General's Office, the Colombian Government decided to 
request an explanation from the Cuban Government. 
  Sources hostile to Cuba tried to take advantage of the 
election campaign in Colombia and even suggested breaking off 
diplomatic relations with Cuba, which were fully restored in 
October. 
  In explaining the incident, EL TIEMPO claims its source was 
a 
person who had been a former guerrilla member, an associate of 
Pablo Escobar (the slain chief of the Medellin drug cartel), and 
had served as an informant for state intelligence services. It 
adds that this source has now admitted he manipulated the 
newspaper, the Prosecutor General's Office, and the Colombian 
Government. 
  EL TIEMPO notes that as a result of the incident, the legal 
editor has presented his letter of resignation and the 
newspaper's Board of Directors is reviewing possible 
disciplinary measures. 
  Meanwhile, the chief editor also presented his resignation, 
and EL TIEMPO says that in due time it will disclose its 
decision on the matter. 
  In summarizing its correction, which it describes as 
significant and unusual, EL TIEMPO points out that ``the big 
question now is who manipulated the former guerrilla, and who is 
the person or persons who masterminded this -- the real 
intellectual mastermind behind this manipulation of 
information?''

<F P=106> [From the ``NTC News'' newscast] </F>
  [Excerpt] [passage omitted] Prosecutor General Gustavo de 
Greiff today clarified his office's position regarding the case 
of the bishop being in Cuba: 
  [Begin recording] Reporter: De Greiff 
said this morning that his office has never been deceived. He 
explained that the Prosecutor General's Office has evidence -- 
evidence that includes testimonies and documents -- which proves 
a church representative was involved in a guerrilla summit in 
Havana, Cuba. 
  De Greiff: Whether I should recant is not an issue 
here. The Prosecutor General's Office cannot base its opinion 
on anything but the evidence it has. As I told you, we have 
such evidence. Nevertheless, the evidence countering this 
evidence is respectable. We will have to compare their evidence 
to ours. As for the case of the bishop, we have decided that 
this not our responsibility. [end recording] 
  De Greiff also said his evidence will have to be compared 
with the evidence of other investigative organizations to 
determine which is genuine. Meanwhile, the Prosecutor General's 
Office said Bishop Nel Beltran is not the person in question, as 
has been claimed from the very beginning. 
  [Begin recording] Reporter: Is it 
necessarily Nel Beltran? 
  De Greiff: Not necessarily. One piece of evidence 
involves a priest. Like I said, this is only one piece of 
evidence. The integrity of this evidence has yet to be 
determined. 
  After comparing all of the evidence, the Prosecutor 
General's 
Office will present documents to the Ecclesiastical Tribunal, 
the organization in charge of investigating church 
representatives. [end recording]

<F P=106> [Report by Jose Gonzalez Batista] </F>
  [Text] Alleged Colombian guerrillas who are guarding poppy 
and coca plantations in the jungle areas along the border 
between Panama and Colombia have threatened the members of the 
National Air Service (SAN) with future attacks on their 
aircraft, according to reports issued yesterday. 
  A police source who declined to be identified has revealed 
the alleged guerrillas informed SAN personnel ``if they continue 
to overfly those areas where they had their narcotics 
plantations, they would execute artillery attacks against their 
aircraft.'' 
  The insurgents threatened to down every helicopter that 
overflew the region and gave a 48-hour deadline to cease those 
incursions. ``The Colombian Army in the area where crops are 
located is warned, and so their lives would be endangered.'' 
  During the past weeks, several SAN airplanes carrying 
filming 
equipment and Panamanian policemen have overflown the 
inhospitable jungle of Darien Province, where they have detected 
coca and poppy plantations extending over an immense number of 
hectares. 
  Once the report about the alleged guerrillas was confirmed, 
Panamanian policemen made a new incursion with the aid of the 
U.S. Army, the result of which is unknown. 
  It seems in the next few hours the air operations will be 
intensified in those regions to reach the sites where the rebel 
groups and drug traffickers are guarding the plantations. 
  Until now and unofficially speaking, it is believed the 
guerrillas belong to the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia 
(FARC), which protects the drug traffickers' million-dollar 
plantations for hefty sums of money. 
  A report indicated that after announcing their intentions 
the 
FARC rebels may stage an attack against Panamanian aircraft, 
because the report stated the rebels are protected with 
sophisticated weapons of war. 
  In February 1993 a contingent of Panamanian policemen, with 
the backing of the U.S. Army and DEA officials, destroyed coca 
and marijuana plantations on 90 hectares located in the remote 
Darien Jungle on the border with Colombia. 
  The operation, called ``Frontera Libre,'' was conducted to 
rescue three U.S. ``New Tribe'' missionaries whom the rebels had 
kidnapped. Several drug traffickers and undocumented aliens were 
arrested during that operation. 
  According to preliminary reports by the Panamanian police, 
the new poppy and coca plantations are scattered in strategic 
jungle areas between Darien and Colombia, making access to them 
difficult. 
  Opium is the plant from which heroine is extracted. It is 
one of the world's deadliest drugs and to date has killed 
thousands of people in the different countries where it is 
consumed.

  [Text] We have a report from our agency, the Fides News 
Agency, on Carmelo Meco Dominguez' testimony that we think our 
listeners should hear. 
  The U.S. Embassy and the DEA tried to involve former 
President Jaime Paz Zamora in drug trafficking in 1990 by 
violently torturing Carmelo Meco Dominguez, seeking to force him 
to incriminate the MIR [Movement of the Revolutionary Left] 
leadership in trafficking activities. 
  This revelation was made public yesterday when MIR Deputy 
Mario Rueda Pena released a tape of a recorded voluntary 
declaration by Meco Dominguez at the La Paz Departmental Command 
of the Special Antinarcotics Force on 1 October 1990. 
  Meco says in his voluntary deposition that a few days before 
1 October he was kidnapped from his home by U.S. agents who 
tortured him violently, seeking to get him to accuse the 
then-President Jaime Paz Zamora and other MIR leaders of 
involvement in drug trafficking. 
  Could this just be a show organized by the DEA with 
information obtained through torture? It is a very serious 
accusation. Legislators should ask Meco Dominguez during his 
testimony at the Chamber of Deputies this afternoon if the 
accusations against Jaime Paz Zamora were obtained through 
torture. The press must report everything. We do not want 
stories here, and least of all stories about gringos who torture 
people. Do you not agree? They can torture in their country if 
they want, but not in ours.

  [Excerpts] Investigative Police Director Nelson Mery has 
stated that the arrest in Osorno of Rosa Ester Vargas [aka 
Negra] -- one of the most wanted terrorists -- has revealed the 
crisis affecting the Mapu-Lautaro Group because she is an 
``operative'' who was acting in a leadership post of this 
terrorist organization. 
  The police said that Lautaro Group leader Guillermo Ossandon 
is ``trapped and alone'' because he has lost most of his leaders 
and contacts. [passage omitted] 
  Nelson Mery asserted that following the arrest of Rosa Ester 
Vargas it can be asserted that, from the organizational 
viewpoint, the Lautaro group is experiencing a crisis. 
  Mery added: ``Proof of this is that Negra Ester has been 
occupying political or leadership posts within the movement 
although she is merely trained to carry out operations.'' 
[passage omitted] 
  Police sources in Santiago disclosed that Lautaro leader 
Guillermo Ossandon (aka Diego Carvajal) has spent these past few 
months in Osorno, ``depressed and shaken after seeing his 
accomplices arrested, one by one.'' 
  It was stated that ``Ossandon is trapped and alone. He has 
experienced critical moments these past few days following the 
arrest of his main aides.'' Ossandon had allegedly withdrawn to 
undergo psychological treatment. 
  Moreover, police spokesman Luis Cariz said there is no proof 
about the rumors within the Lautaro group that Guillermo 
Ossandon wants to become a politician. [passage omitted]

<F P=106> [From the ``NTC News'' newscast] </F>
  [Text] A new guerrilla group has begun to operate in 
Colombia. It calls itself Total Democracy [Democracia Total] or 
Radical Democracy [Democracia Radical]. According to the DAS 
[Administrative Department of Security] Intelligence Department, 
the organization is made up of former members from the M-19 [19 
April Movement] and Faith, Peace, and Freedom [EPL] who are 
dissidents from the peace process. 
  The new organization's military targets are the presidential 
candidates, congress members, bankers, industrialists, and their 
former comrades, whom they accuse of treason. The director of 
the DAS Intelligence Department pointed out that documents found 
during an operation carried out by the DAS anti-kidnapping group 
disclosed that the guerrillas were planning multiple attacks to 
announce their subversive organization. 
  [Begin DAS Intelligence Director Ricardo Villarraga 
Franco recording] They think the subversive struggle should 
be transferred to the cities; that their support in the rural 
areas is not as large as they would like. They want to carry 
out selective attacks, as they themselves say, against the 
bourgeoisie in the country. [end recording] 
  Villarraga Franco insists this new guerrilla organization 
has 
recruited at least 20 percent of the former fighters of the four 
subversive organizations that demobilized. In addition, he said 
they are opposed to the tactics used by the National Guerrilla 
Coordinating Board. 
  The main topic of the most recent Security Council held at 
the Defense Ministry was the appearance of Total Democracy. The 
authorities feel this group cannot be underestimated, because it 
has grown in strength and military capability.

  [Text] Santa Fe de Bogota, 23 Mar (EFE) -- National Police 
Director General Octavio Vargas Silva today said Colombian 
police have uncovered a plot to carry out attacks in Sante Fe de 
Bogota and other cities against the campaign headquarters of 
certain political parties, including the headquarters of Liberal 
Party presidential candidate Ernesto Samper Pizano. 
  Gen. Vargas added that the terrorist plot was uncovered on 
22 
March after police searched a hotel in downtown Santa Fe de 
Bogota. Following a shoot-out, four people, whose names were not 
released, were arrested, while five others escaped. 
  The police director noted that, during the operation, police 
found blueprints of several buildings in which political parties 
are headquartered. The only headquarters specifically mentioned 
by Vargas were those of Ernesto Samper, one of the favorites to 
win the May elections. 
  Vargas underscored that the terrorists, whose names are 
being 
withheld, were arrested thanks to ``intelligence operations.'' 
He added that police are also working to identify the group 
plotting to sabotage the elections. Vargas contended that this 
group could be part of an ``organized crime ring or a subversive 
organization.'' 
  The Colombian National Police director added, ``This is a 
very important case that will require exhaustive analysis.''

<F P=106> [Report by Willy Melgar; from the ``Telepress'' newscast] </F>
  [Text] [Words indistinct] repeated reports on an attack 
perpetrated in the country's interior during the past days, the 
[words indistinct] announcement in Puebla, Mexico on agreements 
reached by the government and the guerrillas within the 
framework of the dialogue started in 1991. 
  Mexican President Carlos Salinas de Gortari and Guatemalan 
President Ramiro de Leon Carpio might attend the signing of the 
human rights agreement reached by the Guatemalan Government and 
the URNG [Guatemalan National Revolutionary Unity], according to 
sources in Mexico's Foreign Relations Secretariat. 
  The parties reached preagreement points in the overall human 
rights accord. Among them are promises to: 
  1. Guarantee and protect the basic rules [preceptos]. 
  2. Fight impunity, and for this purpose, promote the 
necessary modifications of the Penal Code. 
  3. Strengthen democratic institutions. 
  4. Attain immediate international verification. 
  5. Institute voluntary military recruitment. 
  6. Fight against any evidence of illegal corps in the 
country. 
  7. Compensate the victims of human rights violations. 
  It was reported that the URNG invited Monsignor Rodolfo 
Quezada, conciliator for life of the process; Teresa de [word 
indistinct], and other personalities of Guatemalan civilian 
society to attend this ceremony. It was also reported that in 
this round of talks there was consensus on the establishment of 
a timetable for the agreements reached in Mexico on 26 April 
1991. 
  The Mutual Support Group [GAM] today issued a statement on 
the establishment of a Truth Commission in reaction to the news 
of the agreements reached in Puebla, Mexico, during the last 
round of talks between the government and the guerrillas. The 
GAM document states: Guatemalans are experiencing times of hope 
by knowing that the government, Army, and URNG decided to hold 
talks and find political solutions to the internal armed 
conflict that was produced by the profound inequalities that 
exist in the country. It is evident that we have talked about 
two Guatemalans historically: one of Spanish-Indian descent 
[ladina] and the other Indian. We must definitely learn to 
integrate into a single nation with a [word indistinct] sense, 
while respecting diversity, but working in the same direction 
and with the same objective -- to turn Guatemala into a homeland 
for all. 
  The document adds: [Words indistinct] to the extent that we 
seriously correct the mistakes of the past, which we all 
committed by action or omission. (?This is no time) to analyze 
who is to blame for the systematic and repeated problems that 
led to their accumulation. The truth is that there was a wall 
of silence and this nourished all those who had thoughts that 
went against the state of things. What has been established is 
not necessarily the rule to follow; there are options. 
  It further states: History (?zealously) teaches us, who 
remember it, that those who acted with impunity in the years of 
the repression will continue to do so. They (?built) a strong 
structure, which will be difficult to dismantle, and today are 
deciding the fate of the country at all levels through different 
methods but with the same results. 
  Thus, the document adds, it is imperative and indispensable 
to create conditions for the Truth or Investigative Commission. 
This, however, must not be a pantomime to get out of trouble. 
A document specifying that there will finally be a cease-fire 
should be signed. The Truth or Investigative Commission should 
be precisely that: a commission to deal with the truth 
regardless of the influence that a civilian, soldier, or 
insurgent, who killed defenseless and unarmed citizens with 
impunity, might have. We are therefore not referring to those 
from one party or the other who have fallen in the crossfire. 
  It states: We clearly specify that we are talking about the 
Guatemalans who were kidnapped, murdered, or massacred by 
uniformed paramilitary groups while at home or walking on the 
streets.

  [Text] Tegucigalpa, 26 Mar (ACAN-EFE) -- A bomb planted by 
unidentified individuals exploded in the car of Luis Garcia, 
mayor of the northern city of San Pedro Sula, but there were no 
casualties, the Honduran police reported today, 26 March. 
  According to reports, the explosive device was planted in 
the 
car driven by the mayor's son, Alexander Garcia, while it was 
parked outside the ``Casino Sampedrano,'' a nightclub located in 
the city's southeastern area. Garcia was with local politicians 
and businessmen. 
  The police said the bomb exploded at 2255 (0455 GMT), and 
the 
individuals responsible left a note that read: ``So the rich 
can also suffer,'' attributed to the Human Rights Defense 
Committee (Codeh]. 
  Mayor Garcia said ``there was no mishap.'' The blast damaged 
his car, but nobody was injured, although there were children 
nearby washing cars. 
  He said the individuals responsible for the attack are 
trying 
to mislead the police by attributing the explosion to Codeh, 
because it is absurd to think an organization which defends 
human rights is involved in acts of terrorism. 
  Garcia denied the attack had been aimed at him, and he 
expressed regretted that on the threshold of the 21st century 
certain groups believe in social violence. 
  Colonel Jose Martinez, commander of the 105th Infantry 
Brigade stationed in San Pedro Sula, said several individuals 
who may have been involved in the attack were arrested. 
  Garcia governs Honduras' second largest city located 242 km 
north of the country. [sentence as received] He took office 
last January following the Liberal Party's victory in the 
general elections of November 1983.

  [Text] Leon (Mexico), 31 Mar (EFE) -- Authorities reported 
today nine people were injured during a Molotov cocktail attack 
allegedly executed by members of the Leftist Revolutionary 
Movement (MIR) [Movimiento de Izquierda Revolucionaria] in Leon, 
Guanajuato, central Mexico. 
  The attack, which occurred yesterday afternoon, has left 
more 
than 50 people homeless, because it caused a fire that destroyed 
13 houses. 
  Local police reported the reasons for the incident are still 
undetermined, but witnesses say two men called Arturo Andrade 
and Rito Duran, MIR leaders, were the ones who threw the bombs. 
  Area residents have said this is not the first time the 
alleged culprits have attacked the area with explosives. Five 
years ago, the residents say, those people also threw bombs at 
them, because they refused to pay a cooperation quota to their 
organization. 
  The attack was apparently aimed against the house of Maria 
Guadalupe Perez, a former MIR member who decided to leave that 
organization a few months ago. 
  MIR is an ultra-leftist political organization that emerged 
in the past decade and has influence in several states in 
central Mexico. MIR has not openly declared itself an armed 
group.

<F P=106> [Report by Radio ACIR Program Director Guillermo Ochoa; from </F>
the ``Panorama'' Newscast] 
  [Text] A man armed with a .38 caliber gun was arrested 
yesterday during the event to nominate Ernesto Zedillo Ponce de 
Leon as the PRI [Institutional Revolutionary Party] presidential 
candidate. Members of the presidential general staff arrested 
the man just a few steps from the multiple purpose room where 
the appointment was announced. The man's name is Miguel Angel 
Bernal Vargas and he was taken to the Attorney General's Office 
7th Agency located at the Cuahtemoc Station. 
  Bernal Vargas said he is a member of the General Secretariat 
of Safety and Roads, and that his mission was to an act as an 
ear in the event. He was disguised, sorry to say, wearing a 
jacket with many pockets, like the ones used by photographers 
and hunters. These jackets are useful as they can hold films and 
other supplies in all the pockets. That is the way this 
individual was disguised. 
  Inasmuch as persons entering the hall were being searched, 
it 
was discovered this man was carrying a .38 caliber gun in a 
small bag. He was arrested and turned over to the 7th Police 
Station [as heard]. Mr. Lievano Sanchez, PRI secretary of 
information and propaganda, confirmed the arrest of this man, 
who claimed he was acting as an ear. 
  This is a regrettable practice of some government offices 
and 
persons, and even of the Federal Army. They send individuals 
disguised as photographers to certain events so that they can 
prepare a detailed report on not only what was said -- for 
example in a news conference -- but also of the reactions, 
attitudes, and so forth. They prepare very special reports for 
certain persons or certain offices. They simply carry a 
recorder or a photographer's jacket and are sent to these 
events. Sometimes, they carry a recorder and pose as radio 
reporters, other times, they carry a camera and pose as 
photographers. They mingle with the rest of the reporters, and 
then go and present their private reports. 
  Unfortunately, this is a method frequently used by 
government 
offices. In this case, who knows who sent this ear, but he must 
not be very intelligent because the ear was carrying a gun to 
cover an event of this type. This is unbelievable, truly 
unbelievable.

<F P=106> [Report by Francisco Mendoza from Tijuana, Baja California; </F>
from the ``ACIR Radio News'' newscast] 
  [Text] The possibility that more than one person took part 
in the attack against Luis Donaldo Colosio was strongly 
suggested today by Jose Luis Perez Canchola, the Baja California 
human rights attorney general, who was present when Mario Aburto 
Martinez was interrogated for approximately two hours. 
  The local ZETA weekly magazine has reported that the FBI 
believes that Aburto could be part of a left-wing political 
group. The publication added that someone had shouted ``kill 
him!'' just seconds before the first shot rang out. If this is 
true, it confirms Perez Canchola's statements that another 
person was in on the crime and was at the site of the 
assassination. 
  The Attorney General's Office has confirmed that the DEA and 
FBI are helping with the criminal investigation and have started 
to check on several of Aburto's relatives in California. I will 
now play the tape [previous word in English] with Perez 
Canchola's statements. Here it is: 
  [Begin recording] Perez: We were all 
present and heard this man's statements [words indistinct] so 
calmly and with an complete control of his nerves. He spoke 
with a firm voice when he answered [words indistinct]. 
Furthermore, he was extremely adamant in his refusal to answer 
most of the questions that were asked. 
  Because of the gravity of this event, the strong supposition 
has emerged that this was an act organized by more than one 
person. It would have taken a very extraordinary person to 
carry out this action single-handedly. It had to be carried out 
by someone with a great deal of education and training, as he 
himself has stated. 
  It is evident from his statements that he organized the act. 
He bought a weapon with which, over a period of time, he 
conducted target practice in a field -- a field he did not 
identify in his testimony. He specifically told us that his 
intention was to wound candidate Colosio to call the media's 
attention to pacifism and to enable him to talk publicly about 
pacifism. [words indistinct] his statements. He said that 
after being pushed and in the process of [words indistinct]. 
You [reporters] were there and know what happened, right? 
  I must say that while giving general facts and other scant 
details about this action, he answered with a great deal of 
serenity. He was asked about the possibility of being part of a 
group, and he was questioned on his preparations in carrying out 
this action. He refused to reply to any of these questions. 
[words indistinct] but he always refused to reply. He even 
refused to sign the testimony documents. 
  I have to say that I only saw him appear nervous once. I 
noticed this because I saw his eyes widen and look incredulously 
at the person. This was when they informed him that candidate 
Colosio had died. He started to mumble something, but he fell 
silent and immediately resumed his position of refusing to 
answer any question. 
  This is what I perceived about him. He is a young person, 23 
years old, who has the apperance of a worker. He showed a great 
deal of self-confidence during the entire time I was with him. 
To have done what he did, it seems to me that any person would 
show signs of anxiety, but he was extremely calm. I saw him 
walk briskly from one office to another. It appears he prepared 
himself psychologically for some time to do what he did. 
  Unidentified reporter: Why do you think he acted 
like this? Do you think he is aligned with an organization or 
that he acted with a friend or was encouraged by someone else? 
  Perez: I agreed to talk to you only about what I 
saw at the meeting [words indistinct] the rest is speculation. 
I have only dared think... [pauses] the magnitude of this 
criminal act and his conduct have led me to believe that more 
than one person was involved. [end recording]

  [Excerpt] Mexico City, 26 Mar (NOTIMEX) -- Police in Mexico 
today denied reports that the person presented to the media as 
the alleged killer of presidential candidate Luis Donaldo 
Colosio is not the same individual originally arrested. 
  Attorney General Diego Valadez Rios said in a news release 
that the person being held, Mario Aburto Martinez, 23, 
``authorized'' prison officials to shave off his moustache, 
which he was wearing in the first photographs that were released. 
  The attorney general, who is in charge of prosecuting 
federal 
offenses, stressed: ``Let there be no impression that there has 
been any kind of switch or some sort of cover up.'' 
  Privately owned television stations have broadcast footage 
of 
Aburto's arrest. At that time of his arrest, just after he had 
shot Colosio, presidential candidate for the Institutional 
Revolutionary Party (PRI), he was wearing a moustache. 
  On Friday, authorities presented an individual to the media 
they identified as Aburto. The man was behind bullet-proof 
glass at the Almoloya High Security Prison in Juarez, Mexico 
State, close to the Mexican capital. [passage omitted]

  [Text] Mexico City, 28 Mar (DPA) -- The Mexican police have 
arrested and interrogated an alleged collaborator of Mario 
Aburto Martinez, the confessed assassin of Luis Donaldo Colosio, 
who appears in a video film opening the way for Aburto to shoot 
at the presidential candidate at point-blank range, the Mexico 
City press reported today. 
  According to reports coming from Tijuana, where the murder 
took place last Wednesday, this man is Tranquilino Sanchez 
Venegas who was allegedly hired by the ruling Institutional 
Revolutionary Party (PRI) as a member of the candidate's 
security corps. Colosio was murdered last Wednesday at the end 
of an election rally held in Lomas Taurinas, a neighborhood in 
northern Tijuana, on the border. 
  The video, filmed by an amateur and disseminated today by 
Televisa, first shows Sanchez Venegas getting close to the 
candidate and later opening the way for Aburto Martinez. In the 
video, one can see how the assassin raises his arm and puts the 
Taurus .38 caliber just a few centimeters from Colosio's right 
temple, as well as the blast at the moment of the shooting. 
This is the first direct image of the homicide, which even 
registers the exact hour of the shooting, 1912 Mexico City time 
(0112 GMT). [see Selected Video Reports section for 
footage] 
  Quoting sources close to the investigation, the daily 
EXCELSIOR said, however, that Tranquilino Sanchez Venegas denied 
any link to the attack and pointed out that the fact he was 
there next to Aburto Martinez is a mere ``coincidence.'' Two 
other persons arrested on the day of the murder as witnesses, 
Vicente Mayoral and Jose Antonio Sanchez Ortega, were released 
24 hours after the murder. 
  The Attorney General's Office [PGR] denied reports to the 
effect that Sanchez Ortega tested ``positive'' in the so-called 
``paraffin test,'' conducted immediately after the murder to 
determine if he had fired any weapon. 
  The police also arrested several relatives and persons close 
to the confessed killer, including his mother, Maria Luisa 
Martinez, and his sisters Elizabeth and Karina, ages 17 and 9, 
the press said today, adding that their whereabouts are unknown. 
  According to the PGR, there was only one man, Aburto 
Martinez, and only one weapon, the Taurus .38 caliber gun, in 
the attack, but political circles and the local media do not 
rule out a plot. 
  The investigations are now under Special Prosecutor Miguel 
Montes, whose appointment has been challenged by the opposition 
Party of the Democratic Revolution (PRD), who believe that 
Montes' pro-government affiliation does not guarantee the 
impartiality necessary for arriving at the truth.

<F P=106> [Article by Rafael Medina and Roberto Melendez] </F>
  [Text] Tijuana, Baja California, 27 Mar -- Maria del 
Socorro Lopez, Jesus Romero Magana, and Ali Reibel Arista 
Chavez, officials of the Federal Attorney General's Office, have 
been able to determine from the investigation they are 
conducting to determine the motive for the assassination of Luis 
Donaldo Colosio [Institutional Revolutionary Party, PRI, 
presidential candidate] that Mario Aburto Martinez belongs to 
the Cardenist Front for National Reconstruction Party [PFCRN] 
and that he traveled to Chiapas in early January. This is 
according to statements made by the alleged assassin's 
girlfriend, Graciela Gonzalez Diaz, age 16. 
  Meanwhile, in another booth on the third floor of the 
Attorney General's Office [PGR] in this city, another detainee 
had to testify after being fingered as the ``heavy man,'' who 
opened up room in the crowd for Mario Aburto Martinez to fire 
his gun only a few centimeters from Colosio's head. 
  According to our correspondents his name is Tranquilino 
Sanchez Venegas, allegedly hired -- among many others -- by the 
Institutional Revolutionary Party to protect the candidate 
during the rally held at Lomas Taurinas neighborhood. 
  When giving further details to a representative of the 
Federal Attorney General's Office and without being pressured, 
Graciela Gonzalaz Diaz, who was accompanied by her uncle, 
Isidoro Gonzalez Reyes, said that Mario Aburto had proudly told 
her that he belonged to the PRD [Party of the Democratic 
Revolution], that he had been appointed ``eagle knight,'' and 
that he had been given a special mission. However, Martinez, who 
was also her fellow worker, had never revealed the mission to 
her. Likewise, according to the documents drafted in triplicate 
containing the statements made by Graciela Gonzalez Diaz, she 
explained that Mario Aburto was very reserved in the activities 
he carried out within his party and ``to show off'' he mentioned 
to her that he had traveled to Chiapas during the uprising. 
Gonzalez Diaz said: ``He told me he had traveled to Chiapas on 
previous occasions.'' 
  After Sanchez Venegas was fully identified, the authorities 
played a videocassette which clearly shows how he opened up room 
for Mario Aburto Martinez so that he could shoot at the 
politician from Sonora State. Likewise, in photographs of the 
same rally prior to the attack, it can be seen that Sanchez 
Venegas never took his eyes off Mario Aburto, who was only a few 
meters away. 
  Based on photos and the videocassette, federal prosecutors 
asked Aburto Martinez's alleged collaborator about this 
participation, but, rejecting all charges despite the evidence, 
he just kept saying, ``it is all a coincidence.'' 
  The videocassette shows how, after the PRI candidate's 
appearance, Tranquilino Sanchez Venegas draws near and pushes 
General Domiro Roberto Garcia Reyes to one side of Luis Donaldo 
Colosio, enabling Aburto to approach the candidate from the 
right side and shoot him. He is also observed to step back when 
the shot is fired. He then disappears. 
  The agents investigating the case have yet to determine who 
passed himself off as Aburto at Aburto's place of employment on 
the day of the attack. According to Gonzalez Diaz, this person 
drove a late model blue sports car with white license plates 
from the border area of the state. 
  The place where Aburto spent the night prior to the attack 
has not been determined. He did not stay with his mother, Maria 
Luisa Martinez Pinones, at No. 20150 Santa Rosalia Street, Block 
No. 54, Lot 7, Buenos Aires Sur neighborhood; or with his aunt 
at No. 20842 Mexicali Street, also in the Buenos Aires 
neighborhood. 
  Neighbors of Aburto's mother, who refused to give their 
names, told reporters that he only visited his mother on rare 
occasions and that sometimes they ``argued'' loudly about money. 
  Aburto's mother lives with her two daughters, Karina and 
Elizabeth. To earn extra money, they rent a room to two youths 
from Michoacan who were also arrested for questioning, but who 
were later released. 
  Maria Luisa lives in a black two-story cement and brick 
building. A plastic Santa Claus face hangs from one of the 
windows on the second floor. 
  Adrian Carrera, director of the Federal Judicial Police, and 
Juan Alberto Carbajal, director of preliminary investigations, 
arrived in this city last night apparently to broaden their 
investigations. Carbajal returned to Mexico City at 0700 today 
aboard a special PGR flight. 
  Sanchez Venegas' legal situation is unknown, but it seems he 
will not be released until his role in the case is established. 
  Federal agents sent from Mexico City and those stationed 
here 
are looking for the owner of the vehicle described by Gonzalez 
Diaz, who is also ``a key figure'' in solving this case.

  [Excerpts] Mexico City, 29 Mar (EFE) -- Today the Attorney 
General's Office (PRG) accused former policeman Tranquilino 
Sanchez Venegas of complicity in the murder of Luis Donaldo 
Colosio. [passage omitted] 
  The suspicion that he participated is based on an analysis 
of 
the videotape broadcast on television and on graphic material in 
the Police's possession, where it appears that Sanchez Venegas 
opens a path for the murderer through the crowd while watching 
-- without acting to prevent -- as confessed murderer Mario 
Aburto Martinez shoots Colosio in the right temple. 
  Various PRG officials, who asked to remain anonymous, 
indicated that the arrest of the former policeman was made after 
a lady friend of Aburto Martinez declared that on 11 March the 
two individuals met in a Tijuana park. 
  According to official reports, the former policeman was 
employed by the Tijuana PRI for ``crowd control'' at the event 
were Colosio was murdered. [passage omitted] 
  The PRG has indicated that for now no one else has been 
arrested as an accomplice in the murder, although several 
individuals are being investigated.

    [Editorial Report] The following is a compilation of 
reports on insurgent activities in Peru compiled from Peruvian 
media monitored through 31 March. 
  Security forces from the Political-Military Command of the 
Fifth Security Sub-Zone arrested 18 alleged Shining Path 
``terrorists'' in Puno Department. Some of the main leaders 
under arrest are Luis Mamani Alvarez, ``Comrade Cleto;'' 
Leovigildo Efrain Jara Hualla, ``Comrade Carlos;'' Estanislao 
Flabio Mamani Gutierrez, ``Comrade Cesar;'' Serapio Aguilar 
Pari, ``Comrade Raul;'' Juan Pedro Quispe Mamani, ``Comrade 
Jorge;'' and Natividad Quispe Butron. (Lima EL COMERCIO in 
Spanish 19 Mar 94 p A12) 
  One soldier was killed and three civilians seriously wounded 
in a 17 March clash between a military patrol and more than 100 
Shining Path members who attacked the Puente Duran settlement, 
Huanuco Province, which is located 65 km south of Tingo Maria. A 
military spokesman said the subversives tried to take over the 
settlement to get food. (Lima LA REPUBLICA in Spanish 20 Mar 94 
p 19) 
  About 186 peasants who were recruited five months ago by 
Shining Path members and were staying in the ``Sello de Oro'' 
camp decided to surrender to the Army in Santa Rosa, Ayacucho 
Department. They are being held in the Pichari garrison in the 
Apurimac River valley about 220 km northeast of Ayacucho. (Lima

  [Text] The National Counterterrorism Directorate (Dincote) 
budget has been considerably reduced in the last few months. As 
a result, the operational and intelligence services conducted by 
this specialized unit in its fight against the Shining Path and 
the Tupac Amaru Revolutionary Movement (MRTA) have decreased 
considerably. 
  The various sources consulted have asserted that, compared 
with previous years, the budget has been reduced 30 to 40 
percent. 
  It also has been reported that the number of trips to the 
provinces usually taken by Dincote members have been reduced to 
only extremely necessary ones, such as when the presence of 2d 
Counterterrorism Intelligence Division (Divicote-2) personnel 
was requested in Trujillo. This operation ended with the arrest 
of six important MRTA leaders. 
  Aside from this, no trips have been taken to the interior. 
  Until 1993, personnel from different Divicotes and even the 
so-called ``Delta'' Group frequently traveled to the interior. 
Their trips yielded good results and several members of regional 
MRTA directorates, who also belonged to the MRTA national board, 
were arrested. 
  Budget cutbacks also are affecting the serious and patient 
intelligence work (basically pursuits) by Dincote detectives. 
They said: ``Now the chiefs recommend that we do not spend more 
than the indispensable expenses. Nonetheless, if we don't risk 
some expenses, we won't be able to succeed. If we had followed 
orders, we would not have arrested Abimael Guzman and his 
leaders. Sometimes we have to grope in the dark until we are 
able to obtain important information.'' 
  It also has been reported that, so far, almost 30 
high-ranking officials have been appointed to the National 
Intelligence Service (SIN), including those comprising 
Divicote-1 or the Special Intelligence Groups (GEIN) that 
captured Abimael Guzman. 
  They have explained that only now, with the presence of 
these 
specialized detectives, is SIN really conducting intelligence 
work and supplying appropriate information to the operational 
units that conduct the required raids.

  [Text] Lima, 30 Mar (EFE) -- Four people were injured today 
-- two seriously -- in downtown Lima during a bomb attack by the 
Maoist Shining Path gang against an Entelperu [National 
Telecommunications Enterprise of Peru] office that was yet to be 
inaugurated. 
  Sources at the hospital where the victims were treated said 
the bomb injured two peddlers -- one of whom lost an arm -- who 
were sleeping on the street near the targeted office. The other 
two victims were an Entelperu guard and a pedestrian who lost an 
eye. 
  The bomb was in a black bag that had been planted by two 
women. 
  On the night of 28 March, Shining Path members planted 
explosives at four banks, three offices of the Telefonica 
company, and two Entelperu offices -- the latter two companies 
that were recently purchased by the Spanish Telefonica 
Internacional company for $2.002 billion. 
  Shining Path terrorists also attacked a Navy facility and 
knocked down three power pylons in a Lima district causing some 
short, sporadic blackouts in the city.

  [Text] Lima, 29 Mar (EFE) -- Bomb attacks were carried out 
here today against a bank and a Peruvian Telephone Company (CPT) 
office in the wake of an unsuccessful attempt to cause a 
blackout in the Peruvian capital. This new, weak act of 
terrorism caused only damage. 
  The attacks caused heavy damage, which has yet to be 
assessed, to a Credit Bank office in the Victoria district and 
to the CPT office located in the San Luis district. 
  Several blasts, which were initially believed to be bombs, 
were also heard simultaneously in several points of the city. 
These blasts, however, turned out to be dynamite sticks that 
went off in the air. 
  Shortly before the attacks, there was a power hiccup that 
was 
apparently caused by an unsuccessful attempt to sabotage the 
power transmission line that feeds Lima. 
  Terrorist attacks have declined markedly since Shining Path 
leader Abimael Guzman was captured in 1992 and have declined 
further since Guzman admitted his defeat and sought to negotiate 
with the government in September 1993.

    [Editorial Report] The following is a compilation of 
reports on insurgent activities in Peru compiled from Peruvian 
newspapers published through 17 March. 
  On 9 March, Huacho police presented the members of a Shining 
Path support group who were planning to launch bomb attacks 
against an Army unit, police posts in Barranca and Huacho, 
public institutions, and houses of authorities from Barranca, 
Paramonga, Pativilca, and Huacho. (Lima EL COMERCIO in Spanish 
10 Mar 94 p A9) 
  National Counterterrorism Directorate, Dincote, agents 
arrested an alleged Shining Path, SL, ``terrorist'' as he walked 
suspiciously near the PRC Embassy in the San Isidro District. 
They seized a map of the embassy and the diplomatic residence in 
his possession. His arrest led police to find out the SL was 
planning a number of attacks in Lima. (Lima EXPRESO in Spanish 
13 Mar 94 p A18) 
  Cajamarca police presented four SL ``terrorists'' who 
operated in Cajabamba Province. They were arrested during a 
police operation in the past few days. (Lima EL COMERCIO in 
Spanish 13 Mar 94 p A16) 
  On 10 March, Dincote presented 13 members of the new SL 
faction known as the New Network, la Nueva Red, who apparently 
tried to organize a faction similar to People's Aid. The new 
gang is made up of three groups: the militants who belonged to 
People's Aid, a committee of relatives of arrested individuals, 
and a secretariat of workers and neighborhood. They were 
arrested during operations conducted from 24 February to 7 
March. Their main task was to reorganize the ``Committees of 
Struggle'' in Lima's many shantytowns. (Lima EXPRESO in Spanish 
11 Mar 94 p A15) 
  Army forces arrested 18 SL ``terrorists'' during a clash in 
the township of Quisini, Melgar Province, 157 km northwest of 
Puno Department. They were involved in many murders and attacks 
in Lampa, Azangaro, and Melgar Provinces. (Lima EL COMERCIO in 
Spanish 16 Mar 94 p A11) 
  An official communique released by the Puno-based 
political-military command reported that Luis Mamani Alvarez, 
aka Comrade Cleto, was captured along with other 17 subversives 
in an operation conducted near the city of Puno. Mamani is one 
of the main SL leaders who operated in Puno. (Lima EL PERUANO in 
Spanish 17 Mar 94 p a3) bs/

  [Excerpts] According to Joint Command information, between 
June 1992 and February 1994 the Armed Forces and National Police 
[PNP] arrested a total of 7,667 members of the Shining Path [SL] 
and Tupac Amaru Revolutionary Forces [MRTA]. 
  The number of SL and MRTA terrorists arrested between June 
1992 and December 1993 amounts to 6,300, which shows the 
effectiveness of the anti-terrorist strategy implemented by the 
government because in only 18 months the security forces 
arrested more terrorists than during the previous 12 years: 
Between 1980 and 1991 a total of 5,403 terrorists were arrested. 
  So far this year, during January and February, the number of 
arrested SL and MRTA terrorists amounts to 1,367. 
  Moreover, according to statistics from the Special 
Prosecutor 
for Terrorist Crimes, 4,099 terrorists have benefited from the 
repentance law (Decree Law No. 25499), promulgated in May 1992. 
  The new anti-terrorist law, which has been in force for more 
than 18 months, has allowed the trial of 1,104 terrorists, a 
significant number compared to the 1981-1992 period during which 
576 rulings for terrorist crimes were passed down. 
  The military court has sentenced 451 terrorists for treason, 
of which 288 were sentenced to life imprisonment. Civil courts 
sentenced 653 individuals for terrorist actions, 19 of whom were 
sentenced to life imprisonment. 
  The Armed Forces Joint Command disclosed that during the 
past 
14 years 26,000 Peruvians died as a result of terrorist actions. 
Of this total, 2,075 were members of the Armed Forces and PNP. 
  The number of terrorist actions dropped noticeably in 1993. 
Only 1,306 terrorist actions were registered last year while in 
1992 2,049 were registered. 
  According to official reports, the harsh blows struck by the 
security forces against the Shining Path have caused it to 
reduce its activities throughout the country. [passage omitted] 
  The MRTA's situation is similar. Eighty percent of its 
leadership is being held under arrest in high-security prisons 
while 85 percent of the so-called Popular Revolutionary Army has 
been fully dismantled. 
  The MRTA also has serious organization and leadership 
problems as well as logistic and economic difficulties that have 
prompted an incredible number of its members to defect. Many of 
its members have deserted and are now stealing, carrying out 
holdups, or are involved with drug traffickers. [passage omitted]

  [Excerpt] Tarapoto -- It has been reported here that former 
Tupac Amaru Revolutionary Movement (MRTA) militants have made 
known the location of a common grave in Yurimangas that was dug 
by the movement's leaders. 
  The clandestine cemetery is 40 km south of Yurimangas. It is 
believed to contain the remains of MRTA members who died in 
confrontations with the forces of order. 
  It is also understood that the grave contains the victims of 
the MRTA's subversive insanity who, after being captured, were 
murdered without pity and their bodies thrown into the common 
grave. [passage omitted]

  [Excerpt] [Editor's note: see initial incident reporting in

the Afobaka Dam, the Surinamese Army deliberately gave all the 
rebels from the Suriname Liberation Front (SLF) the chance to 
flee. Nobody from the SLF was killed or wounded by the Army, 
said A. Bappa, one of the rebels involved in the occupation of 
the dam and the hostage-taking of 30 employees from the bauxite 
company Suralco. 
  This statement directly contradicts the Army's official 
statement, which said that five rebels were killed while fleeing 
during the recapture mission. [passage omitted]

<F P=106> [Report by Raja' Mansur from Nicosia: ``Tehran Expects </F>
Important Changes in Baghdad Within Months. Iranian Scheme To 
Partition Iraq. The Iranian Intelligence Services Prepare 
Terrorist Cells From the Iraqi Opposition, Distribute Them Among 
European States;'' date not given--all names as transliterated] 
  [Excerpts] Three years after Operation Desert Storm, Iraq's 
future is still ``at a precarious position.'' Some observers 
expect that Saddam Husayn will remain the head of a country that 
is militarily destroyed, politically isolated, and economically 
besieged. Meanwhile, others await the toppling of Saddam through 
a military coup or a popular revolution. 
  A surprising analysis, however, comes from Tehran, where the 
mullahs expect serious changes in the next few months that will 
partition Iraq. Hence, Iran is preparing to gain the ``lion's 
share'' of ``Saddam's heritage.'' Iran has prepared a 
comprehensive scheme to exploit the new situation by adopting, 
supporting, and entrusting opposition Shiite factions with 
military and terrorist missions in and outside Iraq. AL-WATAN 
AL-'ARABI reveals the details of the Iranian scheme designed to 
use Iraq's Shiites in the partition scenario, which includes 
Baghdad, Beirut, and European capitals. [passage omitted] 
  Informed Iranian sources told AL-WATAN AL-'ARABI that the 
higher authorities in Tehran have for a while been acting as if 
Iraq is heading toward partitioning. The sources add that the 
Iranians want to take a lion's share from the changes that may 
occur in Iraq. Toward this end, they are strengthening their 
relations with the Shiite majority, especially after Iran 
managed to move the Shiite religious authority from al-Najaf to 
Qom. [passage omitted] 
  For weeks, there have been disclosures about Iranian 
practices, activities, and intensive contacts with fundamental 
opposition factions, some of which have been briefed on the 
situation. Reports affirm that Iranian Ambassador in Damascus 
Shaykh Ahmad 'Ali Akhtari recently met with Muhammad Baqir 
al-Hakim, head of the Supreme Assembly of Islamic Revolution in 
Iraq, and told him explicitly that important changes will happen 
in Iraq within the next few months. He told him that the 
international changes will eventually arrive in Iraq, which will 
be divided in accordance with a confederation system after 
international troops are sent into it. He also told him that 
many regions in Iraq will become autonomous. 
  Information obtained by AL-WATAN AL-'ARABI from very 
reliable 
sources in Tehran says that officials from the ``Liberation 
Movements Bureau,'' which is headed by Iranian 'Ali A'qal 
Mohammadi, head of the Iraq Affairs Center, began to prepare 
plans for bolstering the position of the Iraqi opposition, 
especially the fundamental opposition, both inside and outside 
Iraq. According to this plan, action cells will set up in Iraq, 
and they will be ready to intervene when the zero hour arrives. 
As for foreign action, Iraqi opposition elements will be 
recruited. They will be linked with the terrorist cells 
affiliated with the Liberation Movements Bureau and foreign 
intelligence. They will work to strike at Iraqi interests, 
embassies, and institutions in a number of European countries. 
They will also carry out assassinations. 
  The plan calls for seeking the help of a large number of 
Iraqi opposition elements residing in Iran, Syria, Lebanon, and 
some Arab countries. They will be urged to travel to Sweden, 
Britain, Denmark, Italy, France, Cyprus, and other countries. 
  Iranian embassies in these countries will get in touch with 
Iraqi opposition groups and terrorist cells and organize their 
activities and plans and establish their objectives. It was 
learned that the Iranian embassies will issue Iraqis with forged 
passports and equipment suited to their operations. These 
embassies will provide information and details about movements 
of Iraqi diplomats and mission staff. 
  It seems the Iranian authorities are anxious not to raise 
suspicion that they are directing these operations. It was 
noticed that their activities and contacts with the 
fundamentalist Iraqi opposition have, for some weeks, focused on 
Lebanon. In fact, the Lebanese security agencies have been 
surprised by the strength of the Iraqi fundamentalist presence 
on Lebanese territory and the increased activity of Iraqi 
fundamentalists. 
  Some reports speak of intensive meetings by Iraqi 
fundamentalists in the central al-Biqa' region chaired by an 
Iraqi called Abu-Haydar. According to information obtained from 
security sources, the al-Biqa' meetings are preparatory. They 
represent one of a series of intensive, secret sessions that 
take place in the Iraqi opposition office in the southern suburb 
of Beirut, chaired by Abu-Maysam, the Da'wah Party 
representative in Lebanon. The reports mention the name of 
another Iraqi called Fakhir, who was charged with providing 
forged Iranian, Kuwaiti, and Bahraini passports for a large 
number of the Iraqi opposition members, some of whom actually 
began travelling to a number of European nations. 
  It was learned that this official holds meetings for Iraqis 
in Bi'r al-'Abd in the southern suburb of Beirut. The 
information indicates that the external Iranian intelligence 
services began cementing their links with elements of the Iraqi 
opposition some time ago. For instance, in the German city of 
Aachen, Iraqi opposition elements have joined hands with Iranian 
intelligence presonnel to launch an Arab language daily under 
the name of AL-JIHAD for distribution among Iraqi, other Arab, 
and Islamic communities in Germany. A version of the paper 
printed in Tehran arrives in Lebanon where it is distributed 
among Muslim and revolutionary extremists. 
  Lebanese security agencies recently noticed that Hizballah 
has been tightening its ties with Iraqi fundamentalists, 
sponsoring their operations. It has been learned that financial 
remittances have been transferred in the past few weeks from 
Iran to a number of Iraqi opposition members stationed in Syria 
and Lebanon to finance their activities and moves. According to 
some reports, the Iraqi Affairs Bureau in Tehran has requested 
additional funds from the Iranian Foreign Ministry's 
intelligence section to meet potentially increasing foreign 
operations. 
  The Iranian project to organize opposition Iraqi factions 
calls for merging the Iraqi organizations and fundamentalist 
parties in an expanded front led by Muhammad Baqir al-Hakim, 
president of the Supreme Assembly of the Islamic Revolution in 
Iraq. The front is supposed to have a secretariat, committees, 
general secretariat, and a central shura council. It was 
learned that the front would incorporate some Iraqi Kurdish 
factions. 
  These are some of the Islamic forces that could join the 
expanded front: 
  1. SAIRI, which is headed by Muhammad Baqir al-Hakim. 
  2. The Iraqi Islamic Movement, represented by Shaykh 'Ali 
'Abd- al-'Aziz. 
  3. The Iraqi Islamic Grouping, represented by Hojjat 
ol-Eslam 
Muhammad Bahr al-'Ulum. 
  4. The Islamic al-Da'wah Party, represented by 'Abd-al-Hamid 
Kashani. 
  5. The Islamic Action Organization, headed by Hojjat 
ol-Eslam 
Muhammad Taqi Mudaressi. Ayatollah Taghi will represent the 
organization. 
  6. The Imam Soldiers Movement led by Sami al-Badri. 
  7. The Islamic Movement in Iraq led by Shaykh Jawad 
al-Khalis. The Islamic Scholars Organization in Iraq, 
represented by Hojjjat ol-Eslam Muhammad Baqir al-Naseri. 
  The following are some of Kurdish organizations that could 
join the expanded front: 
  1. The Kurdistan People's Democratic Party, led by Sami 
'Abd-al- Rahman. 
  2. The Kurdistan Socialist Party, led by Rasul Mamand.

  [Excerpts] The brother leader of the revolution received 
leaders of the Palestinian alliance forces: the Popular Front 
for the Liberation of Palestine, the Democratic Front for the 
Liberation of Palestine, the Islamic Jihad Movement, Fatah 
Movement-Intifadah, the Palestinian Liberation Front, the 
Palestinian Front for the Popular Struggle, the Palestinian 
Communist and Revolutionary Party, the Vanguards of the 
Palestinian Liberation Party, the Popular Front for the 
Liberation of Palestine-General Command, and the Islamic 
Resistance Movement -- Hamas. 
  The Palestinian alliance forces have issued a statement in 
which they stressed that their meeting with the brother leader 
of the revolution falls within an awareness of the historic 
responsibility shouldered by the pan-Arab forces that are 
resisting the plans of submission and Zionist dominion. Within 
this framework, developments on the Arab and international 
arenas were discussed, in particular developments related to 
occupied Palestine in the aftermath of the massacres that are 
being committed by the Zionist enemy against the Palestinian 
people, the latest of which is the sacred Ibrahimi Mosque 
massacre. 
  The statement reiterated the rejection of the Palestinian 
people and its revolutionary and pan-Arab forces of the unjust 
and unfair measures that are imposed against the Great 
Jamahiriyah by the so-called UN Security Council. [passage 
omitted] 
  ``We do not practice terrorism, and we do not target unarmed 
innocents, as they do, but we seek freedom, which is guaranteed 
by all laws and divine codes and confirmed by human rights 
conventions.'' [passage omitted]

  [Text] QUDS PRESS--A senior official of the Palestinian 
organization Hamas, which opposes peace negotiations with 
Israel, has said that Libya has promised the Alliance of 
Palestinian Forces [APF] financial and political aid for the 
liberation of Palestine. 
  Ibrahim Ghawshah, official spokesman for Hamas, the biggest 
faction within the APF, said that a delegation of all the 
leaders from the opposition factions recently returned from an 
official visit to the Libyan capital Tripoli. He added that 
this is the first visit of its kind. 
  In a statement to QUDS PRESS, Ghawshah said that the leaders 
of the alliance visited Libya at the invitation of Libyan 
President Mu'ammar Qadhdhafi. He noted that the delegation 
included George Habash, secretary general of the Popular Front 
for the Liberation of Palestine [PFLP]; Colonel Muhammad Musa, 
alias Abu-Musa, secretary of the central committee of the 
Palestine National Liberation Movement, Fatah-The Uprising; Dr. 
Fathi al-Shaqaqi, leader of the Islamic Jihad Movement; Talal 
Naji, assistant secretary general of the PFLP-General Command; 
'Arabi 'Awwad, secretary general of the Revolutionary Communist 
Party; Nayif Hawatimah, secretary general of the Democratic 
Front for the Liberation of Palestine [DFLP]; 'Isam al-Qadi 
[secretary general of the Popular Liberation War Vanguards 
Organization-Al-Sa'iqah]; Abu-Nidal al-Ashqar [member of the 
Palestine Liberation Front Political Bureau]; Khalid 
'Abd-al-Majid [secretary general of the splinter group 
Palestinian Popular Struggle Front]; in addition to Ghawshah 
himself and Khalid Mash'al from Hamas. 
  The spokesman said that the delegation held a two-hour 
meeting with leader Qadhdhafi in Surt. The delegation demanded 
that Qadhdhafi support the intifadah and the mujahidin and work 
on stopping attempts of normalization with the Zionist enemy, as 
he said he would. The Palestinian official said that last 
Saturday, the delegation met with Colonel Abu-Bakr Yunus, the 
Libyan Chief of Staff and member of the ruling Revolution 
Command Council. 
  Ghawshah described the visit as useful and fruitful. He 
said: It is a gain in itself to exchange views and agree on 
common denominators dealing with Arab and official interests. 
He noted that Libya promised to offer more moral and financial 
support for the liberation of Palestine. He added that he 
expects the APF leadership to visit Iran on a date that has not 
yet been fixed.

  [Text] PLO leader 'Arafat has appointed Mustafa al-Natshah 
as mayor of Hebron effective 4 April. Al-Natshah was voted into 
office as mayor of Hebron in 1983, but was prevented by Israeli 
authorities from carrying out his duties because of allegations 
that he encouraged attacks against settlers. Two years ago, 
al-Natshah served as a negotiator at the Washington peace talks 
with Israel. 
  Hamas [Islamic Resistance Movement] says it opposes the 
appointment, and if al-Natshah accepts, he will be assassinated.

<F P=106> [Interview with Khalid Mush'il by Mahmud Ahmad Khan; date </F>
and place not given--first two paragraphs TAKBEER introduction] 
  [Excerpts] [passage omitted] Dr. Khalid Mush'il, member of 
the Hamas political bureau and one of its central leaders, is 
visiting Pakistan these days. Dr. Khalid Mush'il joined Hamas 
when it was just founded. He became a teacher after finishing 
his education in Kuwait University in 1987. During that time, he 
also started his own business. However, because of his special 
love for Palestine's independence, he spent all his time working 
for it. TAKBEER arranged a meeting with him while he was in 
Karachi. The editor in chief of TAKBEER, Muhammad Salah-al-Din, 
was also present during this meeting. [passage omitted] 
  Khan: Hamas is active in militant actions in 
addition to on the political front. How successful is Hamas on 
this front? 
  Mush'il: Al-Ahmadullah [Thanks to God] it is very 
successful. I can say with full confidence about the intifadah's 
activities and military operations against the Jewish forces 
that 90 percent of these activities are carried out by Hamas 
members. 
  Khan: If a new state is established under the 
leadership of `Arafat, will there not be the danger of Israel 
using it to eradicate Hamas? Considering that Hamas is already 
directly fighting the Jews, what will be your method of 
operation when the new country with full government and weapons 
support from Israel also rises against Hamas? 
  Mush'il: The fact is that the job given `Arafat 
according to the `Arafat-Rabin agreement is to eradicate all the 
opposition parties led by Hamas in Palestine. He will be given 
Israel's police force, weapons, and economic assistance for this 
purpose. He will have to terminate the Palestinian mujahidin who 
are fighting against the Jewish Army controlling this area. 
Thus, `Arafat's main responsibility will be to defend the Jewish 
Army. At the same time, the Palestinians, especially the freedom 
fighters, will be punished for demanding their freedom and 
rights. This way he will be doing his duty to protect the Jews. 
The Palestinians will receive neither protection nor their 
rights. Several of `Arafat's associates have mentioned in their 
statements that they will fight against Hamas with the support 
of Israel and the state police. 
  Despite all this, the declared Hamas policy is that Hamas 
will never raise a weapon against a Palestinian and its fight is 
against the Jewish imperialists who have occupied Palestine 
illegally. Hamas knows its responsibility and invites all 
Palestinians without any exception to join the struggle for 
freedom. Hamas will try its best not to be involved in any civil 
war, which the Jews and `Arafat are aspiring to start. [passage 
omitted] 
  Khan: What kind of administrative structure does 
Hamas have, and how does it function? 
  Mush'il: Hamas operates underground in Palestine. 
Its organization and leaders do not come out; they work 
secretly. There are political and information bureaus of Hamas 
outside of Palestine. It has a central committee, officers in 
various places, and there are Hamas representatives in some Arab 
countries. We have a regular office in Sudan. The leadership in 
Palestine and outside work together and consult with each other. 
The leaders and shuras [councils] in both places make decisions 
jointly. However, these associations are kept totally secret and 
no one knows about the council members. Hamas faces a lot of 
problems in this effort because, if the Jews learn about a 
person having Hamas association, he is sent to jail. Membership 
in Hamas or the Muslim Brotherhood is a crime in Israel's eyes. 
  Khan: Where does Hamas get money for its 
operations? 
  Mush'il: We receive donations from all Muslim 
countries. Whenever possible all Islamic countries give us 
donations. We receive donations from Europe and the United 
States also. People are very helpful; however, our income does 
not meet our needs. 
  Khan Where do you get weapons for military 
activities? 
  Mush'il: The main source is the Israeli soldiers. 
We confiscate their weapons in confrontations with them. The 
second source is the weapons black market. We face a lot of 
problems as some of the weapons traders have connections with 
the Jews and are actually Israeli agents. At times, the Israeli 
Army tries to trap us through these traders. In addition, 
weapons bought this way are very expensive. Weapons are not 
available in Palestine, and a weapon that can be bought for $700 
to $800 in Jordan costs as much as $75,000. [passage omitted] 
  Khan: What is the purpose of your visit to 
Pakistan? 
  Mush'il: The first purpose in visiting Pakistan 
is to inform all segments of Pakistani society, including 
intellectuals, journalists, politicians, and Islamic parties, 
about Hamas and to spread its message among our brothers. We 
want to inform them of the Jewish conspiracies against the 
Muslims, warn them about the future dangers, and exchange ideas 
of mutual interests and relations of Muslims. The second purpose 
is to bring our message to the Pakistani Government and its 
policymakers. [passage omitted]

  [Text] Paris, April 1 (AFP) -- The banned Islamic Salvation 
Front (FIS) has accused Algerian authorities of killing more 
than 200 civilians during anti-terrorist sweeps over the past 
few days, according to a statement received here Friday. 
  The head of the FIS abroad, Rabah Kebir, who normally lives 
in Germany, called on international human rights organisations 
to condemn what he said was a wave of killings. 
  A number of anonymous callers have also phoned AFP in Paris 
over the past few days to denounce what they say have been 
``kidnappings'' and ``killings'' by the army. 
  ``Amongst the many examples of barbarity (...), one notes 
over the past few days the assassination of 82 civilians in 
Blida, south of Algiers, of 120 others between Meftah and Sidi 
Moussa, east of Algiers,'' said the statement dated 31 March. 
  ``Not a day goes by without word of collective killings 
across the country (...) people are taken from their homes and 
then assassinated, slaughtered and their bodies abandoned in the 
streets to create an atmosphere of fear amongst the 
population,'' the statement said. 
  Women are also victims of such ``institutional terrorism,'' 
the statement said, referring to the killing of two women 
wearing the Islamic veil at Boudaouaou, east of Algiers, on 
Tuesday. 
  Anonymous telephone callers said they had witnessed the 
``execution'' of at least 10 people Wednesday at Les Eucalyptus, 
an Islamic fundamentalist stronghold in the southeast suburbs of 
Algiers. 
  The callers said the 10 were killed in reprisal for the 
death 
of 10 soldiers and para-military police caught in an ambush. 
  One caller said he had seen a man deliberately ``run over'' 
by a tank on the main street of Les Eucalyptus. 
  Algerian authorities have blamed the FIS for a wave of 
terrorist attacks in the country since January 1992 when general 
elections the Islamists were poised to win were annulled.

pointed out the body of the Russian national was discovered 
around 1100 hours today inside a Toyota car, which belonged to 
the Russian embassy, parked at a bus station at Saoula. 
  The security services have added that their investigation 
following the discovery of the murder have enabled them to 
eliminate four armed elements and to recover three automatic 
revolvers and a sawn-off shotgun. 
  The initial investigation have established, however, that 
those killed were involved in the murder of the Russian national

Kiffan this morning.

  [Text] Following a series of investigations, the security 
services reveal the identity of a number of the executors of the 
Saoula operation, which targeted a Russian national. 
  Through the investigations opened by the security services 
on 
the assassination of a Russian national yesterday in Saoula, 
south of the capital, it became clear that the Russian national 
used to frequent a spare-parts merchant and an ironmonger in the 
area. 
  The same sources pointed out that the victim had made an 
application to the two merchants to buy certain products 10 days 
earlier and arrived at the specified time in the same car he was 
using to receive the merchandise. This gave his assassins a 
chance to seize him, then assassinate him. 
  The same sources said that the security services, which 
immediately surrounded the place after they were informed of the 
operation, succeeded in killing and identifying four of the six 
armed members. The matter concerns Seddou Said, Chalmouh Ahmed, 
and Boutiche Yazid, who lived in Ouled Fayek and Douira [only 
three names as received]. 
  The two armed persons sought out by the security services 
are 
Kisoume Omar and Zitouni Djamal. 
  The security sources reported that the search is still under 
way for Sayeh Atia, the main executor of the assassination of 
the governor of Tissemsilt and members of the accompanying 
delegation on 11 January last.

  [Excerpt] The Asyut security organs have arrested five 
dangerous terrorists whose job it was to monitor the movements 
of policemen and their houses in obedience to instructions given 
them by fugitive terrorist leaders. The plan was to prepare for 
a number of terrorist operations following the capture of some 
of their leaders and the liquidation of others in armed clashes 
with the police. 
  A responsible security source stated that these terrorists 
were arrested during raids on dens of terrorism in the slum area 
of al-Walidiyah in Asyut city. The raid was staged after a 
terrorist element informed on this group that was shadowing the 
movements of some police officers, watching their houses, and 
reporting this information to those charged with implementing 
the new terrorist plan despite the failure of most of their 
criminal plans. The source added that the security forces are 
continuing their encirclement of al-Walidiyah area, which is 
regarded as a criminal and terrorist den in Asyut. 
  The raids resulted in the arrest of 23 active terrorists, 
including two important terrorists from Abu Tij, and the capture 
of two rifles, one Lee Enfield and a hunting rifle. [passage

  [Excerpt] Cairo, 31 Mar (MENA)--[passage omitted] In an 
interview with today's AL-JUMHURIYAH, Interior Minister Hasan 
al-Alfi noted that public opinion has exposed the terrorists for 
what they really are--outlaws who have nothing to do with 
religion and whose goal is to terrorize the people, spread 
panic, and disrupt stability. [passage omitted] 
  The minister noted that cooperation exists among the Arab 
interior ministers to confront the misleading ideologies as well 
as the groups preaching such ideologies, because most of the 
Arab states have started to realize the gravity of the ideas of 
these gangs, which have become a threat to their regimes. These 
groups use the same slogans, training methods, and even the same 
instructors, he added. Proof of this is that bombs used in 
Tunis, for instance, were made up of the same substances and 
components as those used in Egypt, he added. 
  Al-Alfi expressed his belief that brainwashing of those who 
join these organizations explains why particular individuals 
carry out suicide operations. He noted that these organizations 
receive continuing and considerable financial support. He said 
that $15,000 and 20,000 pounds were seized from one of these 
terrorist groups.

    [Editorial Report] The following is the 31st in a series of 
editorial reports on political Islam in Egypt. These reports 
include summaries of all articles, reports, interviews, 
commentaries, or other items on political Islam that have been 
published in all the issues of Cairo newspapers 'AQIDATI, 
AL-NUR, and AL-USRAH AL-'ARABIYAH since late December 1993 and 
most of the issues of the twice-weekly newspaper AL-SHA'B. 
  SHAYKH 'ABD-AL-KAFI BANNED FROM PREACHING 
  A 150-word front-page report by 'Amir 'Abd-al-Mun'im notes 
that ``the security services have banned Shaykh Dr. 'Umar 
'Abd-al-Kafi from preaching in his Asad Ibn-al-Furat Mosque in 
al-Duqqi and from giving religious lessons. The mosque has been 
placed under the control of the Awqaf Ministry.'' 
  ISLAMIST DETAINEES GO ON HUNGER STRIKE 
  A brief 30-word report on page 1 says that ``the imprisoned 
Islamist detainees have declared a hunger strike in protest 
against ill-treatment, denial of visitation rights, confiscation 
of blankets and clothing, and the torture of some detainees on a 
regular basis in the Abu-Za'bal Prison. The strike began a few 
days ago in the al-'Aqrab, Abu-Za'bal, and Turah prisons.'' 
  RELIGIOUS SCHOLAR WARNS AGAINST CULTURAL INVASION 
  In a 300-word article on page 12, religious scholar Muhammad 
al- Ghazali warns against the West's cultural invasion, which he 
says has created bands of apostates who are destroying the 
religious heritage. He says that these ``apostate bands are 
deliberately mixing freedom of thought and freedom of 
disbelief.'' He concludes: ``We must confront these apostate 
bands with the necessary contempt and hostility, and unveil the 
parties for which they work so that the people can beware of 
them.''

<F P=106> [Report by 'Abd-al-Rahim 'Ali] </F>
  [Text] A dispute has flared up between Asyut Governor Samih 
al-Sa'id and the People's Assembly members; each side is 
accusing the other of supporting terrorism. Escalating disputes 
have led Prime Minister Dr. 'Atif Sidqi to call an emergency 
meeting next week to be attended by members of the Consultative 
Council and municipal councils in the governorate. 
  The governor held an emergency meeting in the governorate 
last week. It was attended by popular leaders. During the 
meeting, the governor criticized some People's Assembly and 
Consultative Council members sharply and accused them of 
assisting terrorists and protecting them instead of doing their 
duty to support the popular resistance of terrorism, at a time 
when the security agencies are doing their utmost to catch 
terrorists and contain their activity. 
  Muhammad 'Abd-al-Muhsin Salih, secretary of the National 
Democratic Party [NDP] in Asyut, expressed his belief that the 
Interior Ministry is engineering a conspiracy to embarrass 
Asyut's popular leaders. Muhammad Ahmad Husayn, Asyut deputy, 
and Jamil Abu-'Aqrab, Abu Tij deputy, blamed the NDP and corrupt 
officials for what is happening, particularly since everybody is 
competing for privileges and to obtain arms licenses for their 
family members. He claims that everybody is ignoring the 
expansion of terrorist activities in their villages and centers 
and in their families. 
  People's Assembly member 'Abd-al-Hafiz Abu-Hashish said that 
the seven terrorists who were killed recently in al-Zawiyah 
al-Hamra' in Cairo were located with the help of information 
provided by popular leaders in Asyut. But the security agencies 
overlooked this fact and gave all the credit to their men, he 
said. 
  When 'Abd-al-Muhsin Salih called for setting up popular 
committees in every village to stand up to terrorists, the 
governor replied angrily that the committee was formed two years 
ago on the orders of former Governor Major General Hasan 
al-Alfi, before he was appointed interior minister. It is known 
that al-Alfi encountered the same problems when he was governor 
of Asyut. President Mubarak intervened at the time to settle 
the dispute between the governor and popular leaders. 
  In another development, the security agencies in Asyut 
declared a maximum state of alert as a precaution against 
possible terrorist suicide operations in retaliation for the 
death of six members in the village of al-Balayzah and two 
others in al-Duwaynah, Abu-Tij, last Sunday, a senior security 
official in Asyut told AL-AHALI. A terrorist group attacked a 
police car on the way to the officers' guest house in Sadafa on 
the same day. 
  AL-AHALI has learned that the terrorists have set up four 
separate groups within the military wing so that the fall of one 
group will not lead the security apparatus to the remaining 
groups. The first group is in charge of attacking civilian 
targets, the second attacks trains and tourist cruises, the 
third banks, and the fourth attacks Coptic targets.

  [Text] Cairo, 28 Mar (MENA)--'Adil 'Abd-al-Baqi, a 
dissident element from the terrorist al-Shawqiyun group, has 
exposed the corrupt thought of the extremist terrorist groups 
that have misled many youths under false claims not consistent 
with the Islamic religion's teachings. 
  'Abd-al-Baqi described these extremist terrorist groups as 
``a band of thieves, criminals, and mercenaries who use religion 
as a cover for their acts and who claim that differences among 
them mainly revolve around the interpretation of the shar'iah.'' 
  In an interview with Egyptian television last night, 
'Abd-al-Baqi, 33, who was born in al-Fayyum, related his bitter 
experience with the various elements of terrorism and extremism 
over 17 years spent moving from one governorate to another 
calling for extremist thought and recruiting many youths. He 
said his relationship with the terrorist groups began in 1977. 
He was exercising in a sports hall inside a mosque in 
al-Fayyum. Shaykh 'Umar 'Abd-al-Rahman was chairman of a 
charitable society affiliated with the mosque. He then became 
acquainted with the members of this society with the aim of 
understanding Islam and studying religious issues. 
  Repentant 'Adil 'Abd-al-Baqi related his relationship with 
Shaykh 'Umar 'Abd-al-Rahman, describing him as a ``dissolute 
preacher and power hungry.'' 'Abd-al-Rahman would answer 
questions without submitting evidence or proof. Most of his 
fatwas were governed by personal whims. He claimed that he was 
infallible and would issue orders without explaining who vested 
this authority in him. 
  'Abd-al-Baqi noted that on joining these groups he was 
affected by several books he read, including one entitled ``The 
Four Terms'' by al-Mawdudi and another entitled ``Rules of 
Propagation,'' which calls for seizing funds by force and by any 
other means. After reading this book, he began carrying out 
armed robberies of jewelry shops, stealing cars, dismantling 
them, and selling them as spare parts. He explained that he 
adopted terrorism after reading a book entitled ``Milestones'' 
by Sayyid Qutb. He said the books calls for changing the regime 
by force. 
  'Abd-al-Baqi said he recruited many youths and inculcated 
them with corrupt ideas. These youths later became leaders of 
terrorist operations. They included Muhammad al-Aswani, Khamis 
Muslim, and Muhammad Sa'd, who carried out assassinations, armed 
robberies of jewelry shops, and attacks on Central Security 
Forces camps. 
  'Abd-al-Baqi explained that it was very easy to recruit 
youths because they were prepared for this and had no legal or 
religious background. It was easy to influence them. 
  He said that mingling with the terrorist groups he noticed 
that marriages within the groups took place haphazardly. These 
marriages were documented solely for security reasons, not 
because this was an important religious duty. He explained that 
some of these groups used to blaspheme [takfir] husbands to 
separate them from their wives who would then be forced to join 
these groups and marry group members. He noted that some wives 
would marry more than once without the knowledge of their first 
husbands who were declared blasphemous. The marriage would 
sometimes take place a few days after the wife got a divorce and 
without waiting for the legal three-month period. 
  Repentant extremist 'Abd-al-Baqi said in his interview with 
Egyptian television that the terrorist groups have nothing to do 
with religion. He described the members of the so-called 
al-Jama'ah al-Islamiyah [Islamic Group] as having no religion or 
morals. He said that members of the al-Shawqiyun Organization 
are a group of thieves and criminals and of the al-Takfir Group 
[Repudiation and Renunciation] are a group of immoral people who 
commit adultery and prostitution under the cover of Islam. 
  'Abd-al-Baqi then discussed the financing of these groups. 
He said it took place through armed robbery. The money netted 
from these robberies was spent on members to meet their housing 
and marriage needs. 
  He also noted that weapons were stolen from village houses 
in 
Lower and Upper Egypt. 
  'Abd-al-Baqi said the purpose of making his confession is to 
expose these groups and show the falsehood of their ideas. He 
added: We found no one to correct our ideas so we stuck to our 
false beliefs.

  [Text] Asyut, Egypt, March 27 (AFP) -- Four gunmen believed 
to be Islamic militants shot dead a suspected police informer on 
Sunday at his shop in the troubled town of Asyut in southern 
Egypt, security officials said. 
  'Abd-al-Hafiz 'Abd-al-Na'im, 35, died on the way to 
hospital. 
  The officials said the outlawed Moslem fundamentalist 
organisation al-Jama'ah al-Islamiyah (Islamic Group) suspected 
'Abd-al-Na'im of informing police about its operations. 
  'Abd-al-Na'im's death raised to 53 the number of civilians 
killed since Islamic militants launched their violent 
anti-government campaign two years ago. The campaign has 
claimed a total of more than 300 lives.

  [Text] Cairo, 27 Mar (MENA)--Interior Minister Hasan 
al-Alfi has decided to divide Asyut Governorate into four zones, 
each of which will be supervised by an officer with the rank of 
major general. 
  The minister also decided to appoint two deputies to the 
director of Asyut security to facilitate the issuance and 
following up of decisions. 
  The decision falls within the context of the security 
strategy pursued by the Interior Ministry in view of the 
geographical terrain and social nature of Asyut Governorate. 
  The interior minister's decision also took care to bolster 
the Asyut security directorate with a group of highly trained 
officers to meet current security needs. 
  Minister al-Alfi met earlier today with the new commands 
that 
have moved to Asyut Governorate and instructed them on security 
operations there. 
  The minister also issued a decision to set up four public 
directorates in the prison authority and to upgrade the latter 
into a department. 
  These directorates have been bolstered by commanding 
officers 
who enjoy a high level of security performance.

  [Text] Cairo, March 25 (AFP) -- An outlawed Islamic 
militant group warned Friday it would avenge the deaths of eight 
of its members who it said were ``liquidated'' by police. 
  The al-Jama'ah al-Islamiyah (Islamic Group) said in a 
statement sent to AFP that the eight were killed after five 
policemen were shot dead last Sunday by al-Jama'ah militants in 
Sedfa, in the troubled southern province of Asyut. 
  The group said two militants were killed by police in 
fields, 
three died in a shootout in Balayza village in Asyut province, 
and three others were arrested at home in the same region then 
shot by police, who dumped their bodies next to the Balayza 
victims, saying all six died in the same gunbattle. 
  The al-Jama'ah said police had adopted a new tactic of 
releasing detained militants and ``liquidating'' them allegedly 
for taking part in attacks. 
  It called on human rights organisations to put pressure on 
the authorities ``to stop such practices.'' 
  Islamic militants have targeted the security forces, 
foreigners and Coptic Christians in their two-year campaign to 
destabilise the country and topple the secular government of 
President Husni Mubarak. 
  More than 300 people have died in the unrest.

  [Text] Zakho, Iraq, March 27, (AFP) -- Two Austrian UN 
guards were wounded, one of them seriously, when gunmen ambushed 
a bus they were travelling in Sunday [27 March] near Irbil in 
Kurdish-controlled northern Iraq, UN sources said. 
  The United Nations was trying to evacuate the wounded 
guards, 
said the officials in Zakho near the Turkish border. 
  The Austrians were in a bus taking 22 UN guards from Irbil 
to 
Baghdad at the end of their tour of duty. The guards are 
employed to protect UN personnel and vehicles. 
  UN organisations have been working in the Kurdish-controlled 
region of northern Iraq since the Kurdish uprising against 
Baghdad which followed the January-February 1991 Gulf war. 
  Since 1992 UN personnel and offices in the region have been 
repeatedly attacked. 
  The Kurdish authorities blamed agents of the Iraqi 
government. 
  Baghdad has warned several times that it will not tolerate 
foreigners carrying out humanitarian work in the north of the 
country. 
  There have been 11 attacks this year, nine against the UN, 
one against a German humanitarian organisation and one against 
Swedish journalists, the UN's Inter-Agency Relief Coordination 
Unit reported. It said six people were injured but none killed.

    [Editorial Report] Jerusalem Qol Yisra'el in English at 
1130 GMT on 29 March reports: ``The Shamgar Committee hearings 
on the Hebron massacre today tried to clarify two outstanding 
questions regarding the morning of the massacre: Why a 
policeman was not at his post at the Cave of the Patriarchs, and 
why three Border Police were late reaching the site? More from 
No'omi Segal:'' 
  ``What emerged in testimonies on the failure of security 
arrangements to work properly on the morning of the massacre was 
a broken chain of command. In contradiction to an earlier 
testimony by head of Central Command Dani Yatom regarding the 
stationing of a policeman at the Cave of Patriarchs, commander 
of the Judaea District Police Moshe Mizrahi testified there was 
no standing order for a police officer to be present at the 
site. An alternative arrangement called for a police van to 
patrol the area, Mizrahi said, but on the morning of the 
massacre the police scheduled to patrol were unaware it was 
their turn.'' 
  ``Eli Moyal, the Border Police duty officer the night before 
the massacre, answered questions on why three Border Police 
failed to reach their posts. I prepared a list of who had to be 
working, Moyal said, but the morning duty officer changed it. 
By the time three other Border Police were awakened, it was too 
late,'' he said. 
  ``Qiryat Arba' resident Eli'ezer Spitzer, who was in the 
jeep 
that gave Barukh Goldstein a lift to the Cave of the Patriarchs, 
also appeared before the commission. Spitzer said he noticed 
nothing unusual about Goldstein's behavior and, in response to 
the judges question, could not recall what kind of weapon 
Goldstein had.'' 
  ``The commission tried to verify contradictions in testimony 
by a Muslim worshiper who was in the Cave of the Patriarchs at 
the time of the massacre, 'Abd-Rabbuh al-Atrash. He told the 
judges he heard two explosions and then firing, not one 
explosion, as he earlier told police.'' 
  ``At this hour, Pinhas Eidelstein, who is the duty 
communications officer in Qiryat Arba', is appearing before the 
commission. Miryam Goldstein called Eidelstein minutes before 
the massacre, urging him to contact her husband. The judges are 
trying to clarify if there was anything in her tone that 
indicated alarm.''

  [Text] Five members of the Kakh organization, settlers from 
the territories who are under administrative detention, have 
asked the prime minister to deport them to south Lebanon, an 
area they consider the birthright of the tribe of Asher, one of 
the 12 biblical tribes of Israel. 
  Our army affairs correspondent Alon Ben-David reports that 
the five men claim that their appeal was neither a media gimmick 
or a joke. They assert that their deportation to south Lebanon 
would satisfy the prime minister's craving to be rid of them and 
also get them out of jail. The five said that in south Lebanon 
they could contribute to the conquest of Eretz Yisra'el and the 
war against terrorism while realizing their Jewish and Zionist 
aspirations.

  [Text] Wahil Nufal, an 18-year-old resident of Dayr Sharaf, 
a village near Nabulus, was fatally shot in the chest this 
afternoon. Villagers told our correspondent Moti Amir that Nufal 
had been shot by settlers firing at stonethrowers near the 
village. The security forces are investigating the 
circumstances of the shooting. 
  Two stonethrowers were shot and wounded by IDF [Israel 
Defense Forces] gunfire in the Nur al-Shams refugee camp. In 
Shuwaykha, a youth was also wounded when IDF soldiers shot at 
stonethrowers.

  [Text] Cairo, March 27 (AFP) -- Egyptian doctors said 
Sunday the victims of the Hebron mosque massacre were hit by 
three types of bullets proving Jewish settler Baruch Goldstein 
had not acted alone. 
  The team of doctors, who visited Hebron shortly after last 
month's massacre, told the Egyptian daily AL-AHRAM ``three types 
of bullets and splinters were extracted'' from the bodies of the 
wounded. 
  ``That proves the massacre was not carried out by one 
person,'' they told the paper. 
  The Israeli army has insisted Goldstein acted alone when he 
opened fire on February 25 in the mosque killing 30 Arab 
worshippers. 
  Israeli ballistics experts have said that all those wounded 
and killed were hit by bullets from a Galil short-barrelled gun. 
  But witnesses at the official inquiry into the massacre have 
testified that they saw another armed settler with Goldstein, 
and that two soldiers also fired at people and not just in the 
air as the army has maintained. 
  One 12-year-old boy told the inquiry that copper splinters 
were taken from his back, lending weight to claims that a 
grenade was used. 
  A separate PLO inquiry recently concluded that at least two 
soldiers had shot at Moslems at prayer in the West Bank mosque. 
  The official Israeli inquiry is still hearing evidence.

<F P=106> [Article by Aviva Shabi and Tzvi Singer: ``The Mentors''] </F>
  [Excerpts] In the meeting of the National Religious Party 
[NRP] Knesset faction, held last week in the shadow of the 
detentions of Kakh and Kahana Hay activists, Hanan Porat spoke 
of the need to establish a spiritual leadership, a sort of 
council of Torah scholars for the Zionist-religious movement. 
[passage omitted] 
  Two of the names mentioned in this context were Rabbi 
Yisra'el Ari'el, of the Temple Institute [makhon hamiqdash] in 
Jerusalem, formerly the rabbi of Yamit; and Rabbi Dov Li'or, the 
Qiryat Arba' rabbi and the head of the high school-yeshiva in 
town. 
  It was no accident that the two, Ari'el and Li'or, led the 
funeral of the murderer-doctor, and even eulogized him. Ari'el 
compared Goldstein to Judas Maccabaeus and Samson, who killed 30 
men with the jawbone of an ass, and called him a martyr. 
  In his eulogy at the Qiryat Arba' yeshiva, addressing 
hundreds including the yeshiva students, Rabbi Li'or described 
the deceased as a man full of love for his fellow men ``who 
could no longer take the humiliation and the disgrace. 
Everything he did was in honor of Israel and for the glory of 
God.'' [passage omitted] 
  Rabbis such as Li'or and Ari'el disturb the NRP heads for 
good reason. First, they make all of the Judaea, Samaria, and 
Gaza rabbis look like extremists. Second, they inspire 
followers such as Goldstein. Those spiritual mentors do not 
openly identify with Kahana's movement, but their world view is 
pretty close. Things they do not explicitly say, often remain 
open for personal interpretations. Things are quite often said 
behind closed doors -- during yeshiva classes on Jewish 
philosophy and ethics -- under the assumption that they will not 
reach the ears of the secular public. When they leak, they cause 
major storms. 
  Four years ago, Rabbi Neriya, head of the Bney 'Aqiva 
yeshivas, was at the center of such storm when a letter he wrote 
was read out in a conference of rabbis in Jerusalem. The 
conference was held to protest the conviction of Rabbi Levinger 
of causing the death of a Hebron shoe trader. Neriya, who won 
an Israel Award for education and is admired by tens of 
thousands, wrote for the occasion about the type of distress in 
which Levinger found himself. He said that ``this is not a time 
to think; it is time to shoot left and right, and do everything 
required to chase away murderers who rise to break your skull, 
stab you through the heart, or break your bones....'' 
  Neriya explained that he was speaking of acts of 
self-defense 
when under a death threat. He did not even think of condemning 
the rabbi who, according to the judges' ruling, shot 
indiscriminately and endangered the lives of innocent people. 
  This argument surprised no one, considering the enormous 
importance of rabbinical decrees for the religious public. Upon 
his detention in 1984, Menahem Livni, head of the Jewish 
underground, wrote about the support of ``Qiryat Arba' rabbis'' 
for ``acts of mass terrorism'' staged to deter the Arab 
population. 
  The names mentioned in that document were Rabbi Li'or, Rabbi 
Waldman, Rabbi Levinger, and Rabbi Yo'ezer Ari'el. Equipped 
with the rabbis' support, the members of the Jewish underground 
went to assassinate Arab mayors. This support, however, did not 
help them when they were arrested. The rabbis were questioned 
by the police, but came out unharmed by the whole affair. 
  Rabbi Li'or is no eccentric, nor does he belong to the 
maniacal fringes; he is the flesh and bone of the 
religious-Zionism. He is a graduate of the Merkaz Harav Yeshiva 
in Jerusalem, and an assiduous follower of late Rabbi Tzvi 
Hakohen Kook. Therefore, any attempt to dismiss him is very 
difficult. Li'or is considered a superb halakic ruler and 
diligent scholar; he was Chief Rabbi Shapira's candidate for the 
post of judge at the Rabbinical High Court in Jerusalem. The 
state attorney ruled out his candidacy due to his racist remarks. 
  His opinions were expressed, among other places, in a letter 
Li'or sent several years ago to a military physician who asked 
for his opinion about practicing giving intravenous injections 
on detained Arab terrorists in the framework of a military 
drill. ``If it is possible to conduct experiments on worthless 
persons, who deserve to die in a country ruled by law, and if 
this is being suggested by a soldier, and if it could be done, 
it should,'' the rabbi wrote in his reply. Another remark 
attributed to Li'or was made in a conference of rabbis: 
``Several Arabs should be sent to heaven for each Jewish 
fatality.'' Several people who attended talks and classes with 
Li'or have claimed that these remarks are among the most 
moderate he has ever made regarding the Arabs. 
  Rabbi Ari'el is also a graduate of Merkaz Harav. He served 
as the Northern Command chaplain; as a paratrooper, he took part 
in the battle for Jerusalem and the taking of the Western Wall 
in the Six-Day War; and headed the high school-yeshiva of Yamit 
with his brother, Rabbi Ya'aqov Ari'el, today the chief rabbi of 
Ramat Gan. Another Ari'el brother is Yo'ezer who teaches in 
Li'or's yeshiva in Qiryat Arba'. The fourth brother, Yig'al, is 
the rabbi of the Golan settlement of Nov. Yig'al Ari'el was one 
of the rabbis who strictly condemned the massacre. 
  Yisra'el is considered the most extreme brother. He is 
remembered from the evacuation of Yamit as the one who called on 
IDF [Israel Defense Forces] soldiers to refuse orders. After 
the evacuation, he used his compensation money to buy a luxury 
apartment in the Jewish Quarter in Jerusalem, and established 
the Temple Institute. In the 1981 elections he was No. 2 on 
Kahana's list of candidates for the Knesset. In 1983 he was 
arrested along with Kakh activist Barukh Marzel during a 
security forces operation to foil an attempt by extremists to 
take over the Temple Mount. Incidentally, Rabbi Li'or is an 
ardent supporter of redeeming the Temple Mount. He even urged 
putting up a fence around the al-Aqsa mosque, preventing alien 
access to it, and setting up a Jewish house of prayer next to it. 
  Another outstanding representative of the extremist craze is 
Rabbi Yitzhaq Ginsburg, the rabbi of the 'Od Yosef Hay Yeshiva. 
He is highly thought of by the settlers who used to be secular. 
He is of American origin, and belongs to Habad. His 
association with Gush Emunim and the Merkaz Harav school of 
thought was made possible through the students of the yeshiva he 
heads. Some say he was adopted by them to provide them with 
ideological legitimacy. His influence on the national religious 
public is insignificant. 
  Ginsburg's Kahanist views were first revealed when he 
defended one of his students who opened fire at Arab workers on 
the Geha road. After five of his students were arrested on 
suspicion of killing an Arab girl in the village of Kifl Harith, 
he declared that ``Jewish blood and Arab blood are not equal.'' 
He remained firm even after a complaint was filed against him 
with the police for racist incitement, and after NRP Secretary 
General Sha'ul Yahalom demanded that he be ousted from his role 
as yeshiva head. 
  In an interview with HA'ARETZ's Ya'ir Sheleg, Ginsburg 
confirmed that he supports some of Kahana's ideas. He clarified 
his stands by saying that ``there is a great difference in the 
punishment becoming a person who hurts a Jew and a person who 
hurts a gentile... the life of a Jew is worth much more than the 
lives of many gentiles.'' [passage omitted] 
  ``At the same time,'' Prof. Ehud Sprinzak of the Hebrew 
University in Jerusalem says, ``if ever a new Jewish underground 
is set up in Israel, the people who found it will first ask 
those three to legitimize their acts.'' Sprinzak specializes in 
studying radical right-wing movements. Among others, he studied 
the Jewish underground. 
  ``There has been no act by the Jewish underground which did 
not have a rabbinical backing,'' Sprinzak said. ``Even the 
plans that were not carried out, such as blowing up the Temple 
Mount mosques, were canceled because the rabbis did not approve 
of them. Hence, there is a chance that the most radical 
elements of Gush Emunim will seek extremist rabbis' support if 
they ever decide to establish a new underground. The three 
rabbis mentioned here are certainly potential addresses should 
matters deteriorate, and I am afraid they will.'' The three 
rabbis, incidentally, refused to be interviewed for this article. 
  After the underground was uncovered in the summer of 1984, 
Rabbi Ari'el set up a small group called Tzfiyya [observation]. 
Rabbi Li'or was also part of this ideological group. According 
to Prof. Sprinzak, ``this was the only group of the entire 
national-religious camp which provided the Jewish underground 
with absolute halakic backing after it was uncovered.'' 
  In a lengthy article Rabbi Ari'el published in the TZFIYYA 
booklet, he determined, among other things, that the commandment 
``you shall not kill'' does not apply to Arabs; according to his 
interpretation, the ban only applies to Jews. Rabbi Ari'el 
found halakic support for his claim that when Jews murder Jews 
they should be tried in courts on earth, but anyone who murders 
an Arab will only be tried in heaven. [passage omitted] 
  The teachings of Rabbi Kahana are, therefore, the obvious 
and 
hidden thread connecting the three rabbis. A thorough 
examination of the stands reveals a surprising similarity 
between their stands and the Hamas [Islamic Resistance Movement] 
concepts on cardinal issues: Both share a vision of a religious 
state between the Jordan River and the Mediterranean Sea; and 
xenophobia which refers to aliens or the secular (``infidels'' 
as the fundamentalist Muslims call it; Hellenizers, as Kahana 
called it); they both demand that all aliens be removed from the 
entire holy land; both perceive the conflict as an East-West 
cultural clash; and they both reject the Western culture, the 
source of all evil that came upon the nation. 
  ``We should know what the reality is,'' Rabbi Li'or wrote. 
``The Torah is very explicit: But if you do not drive out the 
inhabitants of the land from before you, then those of them whom 
you let remain shall be as pricks in your eyes and thorns in 
your sides, and they shall trouble you in the land where you 
dwell.'' He further wrote in favor of the notion of transfer: 
``Removing the Arab residents of Judaea, Samaria, and Gaza is a 
state task.'' [passage omitted] 
  It is no coincidence that Li'or agreed with the definition 
of 
the intifadah as a war: in an interview to IDF Radio he said 
that ``in a state of war the prohibition against hurting 
innocent people does not apply and collective punishment is 
permissible.'' [passage omitted] 
  Prof. Sprinzak emphasizes that Ari'el, who suffered greatly 
as a result of his activity in Yamit and in Kakh, is no longer 
active in the militant groups. He ``came out of the closet'' 
while delivering his obituary to Goldstein. However, one of the 
settlements' rabbis, who asked to remain unnamed, related the 
following story: 
  ``Several years ago -- after one of the mass terror attacks 
-- a student rose up during one of my lessons and said he wanted 
to retaliate. He quoted Rabbi Ari'el as an authority for this 
sort of action. Since I could not dissuade him, I suggested 
that we both call Ari'el and ask for his opinion. Ari'el's 
answer: I do not recommend to do so, but I also cannot say that 
I oppose it.'' [passage omitted]

  [Text] The police detained an Israeli citizen on suspicion 
that he had murdered an Arab truck driver, Riyad Salimi, from 
the village of Idnah in the Hebron area. He fired at him from 
an ambush at the Bet Guvrin junction, critically wounding him. 
The truck driver died at the Ashqelon Barzilay Hospital. Our 
correspondent Aviv Bushinsky reports that immediately after the 
shots the police erected roadblocks and launched searches. 
About 30 minutes after the incident, an unknown person called 
the Qiryat Gat police station and told the police how to capture 
the shooter. Following this person's instructions, the 
policemen detained a 42-year-old Israeli who was found in 
possession of an Uzi submachine gun and nine magazines. From 
his interrogation it was learned that the suspect fired many 
bullets at the truck. Our correspondent adds that it is 
believed he might have wanted to avenge the death of his brother 
who served in the Border Police in the Hebron area. [passage

<F P=106> [By JORDAN TIMES staff reporter P.V. Vivekanand] </F>
  [Excerpts] Amman--Twenty-three people charged with plotting 
and carrying out attacks aimed at destabilising internal 
security will be put on trial in mid-April, official sources 
said Sunday. [passage omitted] 
  At least six of the suspects have confessed to have planted 
the explosive devices that went off at the Rivoli and Salwa 
theatres as well as others which were discovered at a 
supermarket outside Amman and the Zahran cinema, local reports 
said. [passage omitted] 
  The sources said most of them are from lower middle class 
families and some of them would be charged as accessories before 
and after the crime. 
  It was not clear from the reports how many of the suspects 
knew each other. They were all said to have worked separately, 
as small groups, unaware of each other, under the guidance of 
one or more people. 
  According to the reports, one of the suspects, Muhammad 
'Adaribah, told interrogators that he tried and failed to plant 
a bomb at the Rivoli, in downtown Amman, one week before the 
Jan. 26 blast. 
  The device, described as a time-bomb that actually went off 
inside the theatre at midnoon, was planted by another suspect, 
Yasin Zahrah, the reports said. Seven people were injured in 
the blast. 
  The youth who planted the bomb which was discovered and 
defused at Amman's Zahran cinema was identified as Samir Ahmad, 
who told police that he was asked to plant the bomb by Muhammad 
Shihadah, a construction material salesman from the al-Baq'ah 
refugee camp. 
  Mr. Ahmad was reported to have met Mr. Shihadah, described 
as 
an Arab Afghan, in front of the al-Husayni Mosque in downtown 
Amman to inform him that he had planted the bomb inside the 
theatre. 
  Mr. Shihadah, who is also under detention, was also 
implicated in the al-Zarqa' bombing by the man who confessed to 
have planted the device, 'Id Jahalin, a 30-year-old plumber from 
al-Baq'ah. 
  Mr. Jahalin lost his limbs in the explosion when the bomb 
exploded prematurely. His confession from his hospital bed is 
believed to have been the most significant breakthrough in the 
case. 
  The suspects also took interrogators to 'Akrush Supermarket 
in Safut, which straddles the main road between Amman and 
al-Baq'ah camp, and reenacted the planting of the device which 
was discovered and defused there a few days before the Rivoli 
blast. 
  Mr. Zahrah, the man who reportedly confessed to the Rivoli 
explosion, was also identified as the one who planted the bomb 
at the supermarket. 
  Another target of the suspects was the sprawling Housing 
Bank 
complex in the heart of Amman, according to the reports. 
  Some of the suspects showed interrogators how ``they cased 
the joint to determine where to plant the bombs'' but no 
explosives were actually placed in the complex. 
  Apart from Mr. 'Adaribah, Mr. Zahrah, Mr. Ahmad, Mr. 
Shihadah 
and Mr. Jahalin, other suspects identified by name included 
Hasan Hamdan and Sulayman Biyah. 
  All the bombs were said to have used crude technology widely 
employed by the Afghan rebels in their battle against the Red 
Army and Soviet-supported government soldiers in Afghanistan. 
  The bombing case is the second known organised sabotage 
attributed to ``Arab Afghans'' in Jordan. 
  In 1991, members of a group called ``Jaysh Muhammad 
(Muhammad's Army)'' made up mostly of Afghan returnees were 
arrested following a series of attacks and foiled attempts 
against night-clubs, cinemas, liquor shops and security officers 
as well as government buildings and diplomatic missions. 
  Eighteen of them were tried and convicted; eight of them, 
two 
in absentia, were given the death sentence, and others were 
jailed for terms ranging from two years to 15 years. [passage

al-Hashayikah said that these individuals used to pass through 
Jordan and give him the money necessary for carrying out bombing 
operations aimed at eliminating vice. 
  Al-Hashayikah is in detention along with over 20 other 
people 
on charges of carrying out operations to blow up movie theaters 
and some liquor stores. [passage omitted]

    [Editorial Report] Amman AL-BILAD in Arabic on 30 March 
publishes on page 5 an approximately 4,000-word report on the 
suspects charged in connection with a spate of recent explosions 
in Jordan. 
  AL-BILAD, ``an independent political weekly,'' claims to 
have 
accompanied Major Muhannad Hijazi, the public prosecutor of the 
State Security Court, and the defendants to the sites targeted 
for explosions. The defendants were reported to have been in 
good health. They were also reported to have said that they are 
``heroes'' because they carried out these bombings. The 
argument that they advanced is that they were carrying out God's 
injunction against ``debauchery.'' They reportedly planned to 
establish a caliphate, assassinate intelligence and army 
personnel, and kill the Jordanian and Palestinian peace talks 
teams to halt the march of ``capitulation,'' as they put it. 
  The weekly states that 'Abdallah Kamil al-Shuraydah 
al-Hashayikah is the principal defendant in the series of 
bombings that have recently taken place in Jordan. The weekly 
notes that al-Hashayikah, a member of the Muslim Brotherhood, 
Suwaylih Branch, left Amman in 1990 to work as a teacher of 
Arabic in the Philippines, where he also taught at the al-Imam 
al-Shafi'i Foundation. This foundation is supervised by Jamal 
Khalifah, also known as Abi-Bara', a Saudi national and an 
in-law of Usamah Bin-Ladin, a Saudi national of Yemeni origin 
currently living in Khartoum, Sudan. Khalifah, Bin-Ladin's 
right hand-man, is reported to be close to the ruling Saudi 
family. 
  According to the paper, al-Hashayikah discussed with 
Khalifah 
the idea of launching of an organization in Jordan to 
``eradicate forbidden conduct by force'' in order to lay the 
groundwork for establishing a caliphate in Jordan. This idea 
was well received by Jamal Khalifah. The recruits of the 
organization would be Jordanians who received military training 
in Afghanistan during the war with the Soviets. The only thing 
the organization needed was financing. The report states that 
this all happened while the two were in the Philippines. 
Al-Hashayikah returned to Amman early this year to launch his 
organization so that he might receive the promised finances from 
Bin-Ladin, and Jamal Khalifah, ``the mastermind of Bin-Ladin's 
terrorist operations in the Arab world.'' 
  The article continues, noting that the organization 
al-Hashayikah used had already taken its final shape before he 
left for the Philippines. It had a joint command consisting of 
himself, as well as Jihad al-Tanjir, Zakariyah Muhammad Dawud, 
and Isma'il al-'Amayirah. They used mosques and places of 
worship to ``concoct conspiracies.'' The recruits of the 
organization received refresher courses in military training 
during further visits to Afghanistan via Saudi Arabia or Yemen. 
  According to the paper, ``Bin-Ladin's group'' received the 
recruits in Saudi Arabia upon their arrival there, and provided 
them with the necessary visas and air tickets to Pakistan, where 
they then traveled to Afghanistan. Shaykh 'Abd-al-Majid 
al-Zandani, representative of the Yemeni Reform Grouping at the 
Yemeni Presidential Council, is reported to have provided the 
Afghan Arabs stopping over in Yemen en route to Afghanistan with 
the necessary visas and air tickets, as well as ``his constant 
financial support for the organization.'' 
  The weekly also claims that some of the organization members 
remained in Jordan to plan bomb attacks and recruit other 
members. Having faced difficulties in acquiring the necessary 
explosives in Jordan, the organization sent Zakariyah Muhammad 
Dawud Qasim to Yemen, where he was trained in how to manufacture 
sophisticated explosives. He was also trained in detonating 
explosives by remote control. 
  The paper explains that, in order to achieve its objectives, 
the organization believed that it had to kill Arab and Muslim 
leaders who do not apply the Islamic sharia in their countries. 
It also believed that it had to resist the ongoing Middle East 
peace negotiations by all means, including the use of force. 
The organization also planned to blow up movie theaters, 
nightclubs, bars, tourist areas, liquor stores, and public areas 
where the two sexes mingle, such as the Housing Bank Complex. 
The organization also planned to assassinate senior 
intelligence, army, and public security personnel in order to 
pave the way for the creation of a caliphate in Jordan. 
  Noting a plan by the organization to assassinate the 
Jordanian and Palestinian peace talks negotiators, AL-BILAD 
says: ``In addition to carrying out bombings, the organization 
members entertained the idea of drawing up a full-fledged plan 
to liquidate Jordanian and Palestinian peace negotiators, headed 
by Prime Minister Dr. 'Abd-al-Salam al-Majali, former head of 
the Jordanian delegation to the peace talks.'' 
  According to the paper, the group found al-Majali's home 
telephone number, and telephoned him, telling him they were 
journalists working for a local daily. They asked for a date 
for an important press interview with him. Al-Majali agreed to 
grant them an interview. Al-Majali was meant to be assassinated 
during this bogus interview, according to the report, which it 
said was planned with a great deal of cleverness. A date was 
set for the interview and forty-eight hours before the interview 
was scheduled to take place, the organization leadership had 
drawn up a detailed plan to assassinate al-Majali by explosive 
charges and other weapons to be carried by the bogus press team, 
which would have consisted of reporters and cameramen. 
  The paper says it was only divine providence that intervened 
to save al-Majali, who was assigned an official mission outside 
Jordan. This mission required him to travel to Washington ahead 
of the time set for the implementation of the assassination 
plan. Thus, the bogus interview date was postponed to a later 
date. However, this date has never materialized because the 
culprits were apprehended. 
  The weekly paper goes on to say that, having failed in their 
bid to liquidate al-Majali, the organization members attempted 
to assassinate members of the Palestinian delegation to the 
Middle East peace talks, including Faysal al-Husayni and Hanan 
'Ashrawi. However, stringent security precautions and the 
secrecy with which al-Husayni and 'Ashrawi surround their moves 
thwarted the defendants' scheme. Undeterred by their failure, 
the defendants recruited an employee of the Grand Palace Hotel, 
where the Palestinian peace negotiators stayed. The hotel 
employee was asked to plant explosive charges in the peace 
negotiators' rooms. Once again, strict security precautions 
thwarted their scheme. 
  According to the report, the failure of the organization's 
assassination scheme prompted the organization command to 
endorse a plan of explosions in Jordan to convince Jamal 
Khalifah to finance the organization. This resulted in 
explosions at movie theaters in Amman and al-Zarqa'. However, 
attempts to carry out further explosions elsewhere in Jordan 
failed. 
  Muhammad 'Ali Shihadah is reportedly the ``organization's 
mastermind responsible for picking explosion targets.'' 
  The paper's investigations indicated that 'Abdallah Diyyah, 
a 
prominent Suwaylih-based Muslim Brotherhood member, was 
acquainted with the organization's scheme by 'Abdallah 
al-Hashayikah. However, Muslim Brotherhood sources ruled out 
Diyyah's involvement in this scheme. 
  Elaborating further on this issue, the paper says: ``Several 
quarters insinuated that the Muslim Brotherhood could be 
implicated in these explosion incidents, particularly since 
al-Hashayikah was a Brotherhood leader in Suwaylih, not to 
mention the fact that Diyyah was close to the hawkish wing of 
the Muslim Brotherhood. Meanwhile, informed sources ruled out 
this possibility, which has not been confirmed by the 
interrogations conducted with the defendants.'' 
  ``AL-BILAD has learned that 23 persons have been implicated 
in the recent spate of explosions. They will stand trial at the 
State Security Court within the next two weeks. If found 
guilty, they could receive punitive measures, including the 
death sentence. These defendants are the following: 'Abd Salih 
Husayn al-Jahalin, Muhammad 'Ali Husayn Shihadah Abu-'Ayyad, 
Yasin Hasan Muhammad Zahrah, Hasan Hamdan Hasan 'Abd-al-Qadir, 
Muhammad Salih Musa 'Aqil, Sulayman Ahmad 'Abd-al-'Al Bisah, 
Muhammad Ahmad 'Abd-al-Fattah al-'Adharibah, Samir Ahmad 
Muhammad Tilagh, 'Abd-al-Nasir Mahmud Muhammad Yunus, Fa'iq 
Salih Yusuf al-Shawish, 'Umar Jibril Muhammad al-Shawahin, 
'Abdallah Kamil al-Hashayikah, Jihad Ahmad Khalid al-Tanjir, 
Khalil Tawfiq Muhammad 'Alqam, Muhammad Ahmad al-Shaykh 
al-Fahmawi, Salim Musa Yusuf, Zakariyah Muhammad Dawud Qasim, 
Isma'il Sa'id al-'Amayirah, Muhammad Sa'id Muqbil Dar-'Awdah, 
Walid Muhammad 'Ashsha, Muhammad Amin al-Shamasinah, Ra'd 
Khalil, and 'Abd-al-Majid al-'Adharibah.'' 
  AL-BILAD concludes its report by promising to provide its 
readers with further details as they unfold when the State 
Security Court begins to investigate this case.

  [Text] Amman, March 30 (AFP) -- The authorities are holding 
23 Jordanian Islamic militants suspected of trying to kill 
Jordanian and Palestinian leaders involved in peace talks with 
Israel, a legal official said here Wednesday. 
  The 23, all veterans of the Afghanistan war, were believed 
to 
have plotted to kill Jordanian Prime Minister 'Abd-al-Salam 
al-Majali and Palestinian peace negotiators Faysal al-Husayni 
and Hanan 'Ashrawi last year, according to charges being drawn 
up against them. 
  The militants, already detained for more than one month, 
were 
also suspected of involvement in a series of bomb blasts in 
Jordan in January and February. 
  The official said the militants plotted to kill al-Majali 
during an interview, with one of the group posing as a 
journalist. However, the interview was postponed. 
  Al-Majali was leading Jordan's delegation to the bilateral 
peace talks with Israel at the time. The Arab-Israeli talks 
were suspended after the February 25 Hebron massacre. 
  The militants also planned to kill al-Husayni and 'Ashrawi 
when the Palestinian leaders made one of their regular trips to 
Amman, the official said. 
  Bombs were to be planted in their hotel rooms with the 
connivance of a hotel employee, but the plot failed due to the 
secrecy surrounding the Palestinian leaders' movements. 
  The official said the militants were expected to stand trial 
at the end of April. 
  The group's aim was to ``torpedo the peace process and get 
alcoholic drinks, bars and cinemas outlawed,'' the official 
explained. 
  On 6 February the authorities said they had arrested two 
Islamic militants implicated in the bombings of two cinemas in 
Jordan on 26 January and 1 February which injured a total of 
nine people. The two had reportedly fought in Afghanistan. 
  Interior Minister Salamah Hammad said a group of militants 
had been rounded up for planning attacks against the Jordanian 
parliament and leading political figures. 
  Nearly 400 Jordanians and Palestinians have returned to 
Jordan over the past year after undergoing military training 
with the Afghan Mujahedin.

  [Text] Amman--The security forces have detained three 
people for assaulting two Russian nationals. The details of 
this case, as received by AKHIR KHABAR, are: 
  At 1715 on 25 February, a ``special police'' patrol heard 
calls for help from two Russian nationals who were being 
attacked by three people who stabbed them with a penknife. 
  The three people fled when the patrol arrived on the scene, 
but police gave chase and arrested one of them, named Yasir 
'Abd-al-Salam 'Abd-al-Qadir al-Satari, formerly from al-Ramlah 
and currently an al-Husayn Camp resident. 
  The two Russian nationals, Victor Manhalbin and May Rijan 
[name as transliterated], received medical treatment. Rijan 
works for the national wrestling team as a trainer. Yasir 
confessed that he was accompanied by Kayid Muhammad Salamah and 
Rawhi Talal Ahmad, both residents of the al-Husayn Camp. The 
three were delivered to the head of the preventive security 
section to complete their interrogation. He then transferred 
them to the General Intelligence Directorate, where they remain.

  [Excerpt] Cairo, 1 Apr (MENA)--Lebanese Foreign Minister 
Faris Buwayz has stressed that the bombing of the Sayyidat 
al-Najat Church was committed after the al-Ibrahimi Mosque 
massacre to divert international attention away from the 
massacre. 
  In an interview with the newspaper AL-AHRAM published today, 
the Lebanese foreign minister said that a number of people have 
been arrested for the church bombing. These people revealed 
that they had connections to Israeli officers and had obtained 
instructions, funds, and equipment that enabled them to assemble 
the explosive device, Buwayz added. 
  Buwayz maintained that it is not possible to terminate the 
resistance before obtaining assurances that south Lebanon will 
return to Lebanon because the resistance is not the reason for 
the Israeli occupation but a result of it. [passage omitted]

that the bomb that exploded in the Sayyidat al-Najat Church and 
killed 11 people last month was made at the headquarters of the 
banned Lebanese Forces militia in the presence of Fu'ad Malik, 
senior aide to Samir Ja'ja'. 
  In an interview with MBC, Dallul said that he believes that 
the objective behind the explosion was to create sedition in the 
country. He added: 
  [Begin Dallul recording] The measures taken by the 
government were correct. From the security aspect, there was a 
coup attempt in every sense of the word, an attempt that served 
the Israeli enemy. There were attempts to undermine the 
homeland. What happened was very serious and it is up to the

<F P=106> [Randah Taqiyy-al-Din report: ``Al-Hariri: State Not </F>
Applying Double Standards''] 
  [Excerpts] Paris -- [Lebanese] Prime Minister Rafiq 
al-Hariri has reiterated his accusation of Israeli involvement 
in inciting elements from the Lebanese Forces to blow up the 
Sayyidat al-Najah Church. However, he said that the Forces 
cannot be accused as a party until the outcome of the 
investigations is known. The disbandment of the Forces party 
was the result of an ``administrative-political decision.'' He 
stressed that the authorities are not applying double standards 
when dealing with the parties and that the Lebanese resistance 
is to continue. 
  Al-Hariri was speaking to a number of Lebanese journalists 
in 
Paris following his meeting with French Foreign Minister Alain 
Juppe. [passage omitted] 
  Al-Hariri said that ``all the measures we are taking are 
aimed at strengthening the situation. Lebanon is targeted. It 
is no secret.... Lebanon represents a challenge to Israel after 
peace [is achieved], because the stage ahead will witness an 
economic challenge.'' 
  Asked about the Lebanese Forces' responsibility for the 
church blast, he said: ``We are not accusing the Forces, but, 
rather, elements [from them]. As for the party's disbandment, 
it was the result of an administrative-political decision based 
on a number of pieces of information available to the judiciary 
and security services. The issue was raised with the Council of 
Ministers and a decision was taken.'' [passage omitted] 
  Asked whether the decision to disband the Forces is a 
prelude 
to hitting Hizballah, he said: ``Until an agreement is reached 
with Israel on its withdrawal from Lebanon, the resistance issue 
remains a red line which cannot be touched. We, the country, 
and the government have paid heavy prices for the sake of 
safeguarding the Lebanese' right to resist, and we will not stop 
it. This is settled. As for actions outside the resistance, 
they are unacceptable and will not be overlooked. Their 
perpetrators will be judged like anyone else. The resistance is 
limited to a certain area. Any actions outside this area will 
certainly not be overlooked.'' 
  Asked about Christians' fears that the resistance might 
contribute to reinforcing sectarian sentiments, he said: ``If 
Samir Ja'ja' comes and decides to resist Israel and the state 
treats him differently from Hizballah, then the talk (about 
fears) is true.'' He pointed out that he has not made any 
contacts with Ja'ja' since the Lebanese Forces' arrest and the 
party's disbandment. [passage omitted]

  [Text] Watchers of the Syrian scene and arrivals from Syria 
report that Basil, President Hafiz al-Asad's eldest son, met his 
death at the hands of drug gangsters operating in Lebanon. 
  According to some reliable sources, Basil was killed in 
Lebanon, having received threats in connection with the hush 
money he had been receiving from hashish growers and smugglers. 
He had been suspected of planning to swindle the traffickers 
and control the market. 
  The sources indicate that the news of Basil's death, 
officially caused by an auto crash, was broken two days after 
its actual date. Neither was there any picture of the accident 
that could be shown on Syrian television. 
  Observers note that Lebanese factions, the Maronites in 
particular, were keen to send delegations to pay their last 
respects, lest any be suspected of involvement in his 
assassination and then bear the vengeance of Syrian intelligence 
services. 
  The observers are confident that the next few days will bear 
out their assessment. A tradition of the al-Nasiriyah sect 
calls for the deceased's face to be uncovered for a final 
glimpse, which was not observed in the case of Basil al-Asad.

<F P=106> [Igor Andreyev article: ``If Terrorists Capture an AES, </F>
There Will Be No One To Liberate It''] 
  [Text] The collegium of the Federal Counterintelligence 
Service [FCS] (which, we would remind you, was set up last 
December to replace the abolished Ministry of Security) devoted 
its first session specifically to the security of Russia's 
strategic installations. Among other things the problem of 
nuclear electric power stations [AES's] was vociferously 
discussed in some alarm since the FCS thinks that they may fall 
prey to criminal, terrorist encroachments. 
  In the opinion of Colonel Leonid Semenov, a leading FCS 
expert and head of a Strategic Installations Directorate 
section, the first symptoms of trouble with crime at AES's 
appeared in the eighties. As was said at the time, ``offices'' 
received letters from personnel at the Kursk and Novovoronezh 
AES's and some AES's on Ukrainian territory. For all their 
differences, the messages boiled down to one thing: If you 
don't solve my problems (housing, and so on), I will not spare 
myself, I will blow an AES to kingdom come.... Inspection of 
the ``complaints,'' Semenov said, showed that the writers were 
suffering from psychological disorders. 
  The FCS believes that, since the early nineties, the 
socioeconomic preconditions for attacks on AES's have been 
compounded by political ones. According to the latest figures, 
which have not however been confirmed by documentation, 
extremists from the Ararat Valley made threats against the 
Armenian AES, while the most rabid separatists in Chechnya seem 
to have threatened the Balakovo and Kursk AES's. The Lubyanka 
believes that both groups saw the AES's as a potential means of 
putting political pressure on the Union and Russian authorities. 
  In Col. Semenov's view, there is an equal danger from 
arbitrary actions by AES personnel trying to get the government 
to resolve various social problems. Like, for instance, the 
hunger strike and picket of the Kursk AES this March by staffers 
protesting nonpayment of wages since December. In the opinion 
of counterintelligence personnel, extremists may exploit such 
situations, as well as the power generation operatives' just 
discontent, and events may quite possibly end up seriously out 
of control. 
  Although every AES has an FCS subunit working there, whose 
duty is to know everything and promptly gather information about 
likely attacks on AES security, legal norms no longer make 
provision for rigorous scrutiny of job applicants. Surprisingly 
enough, candidates for jobs as nuclear power generation 
personnel do not take a mental fitness test and are not vetted, 
as is the case throughout the civilized world, for reliability 
-- at least in human, civic terms. The once tightly sealed 
30-km zone around AES's has long been open to all comers. Today 
anyone, including criminals, can come and register or even live 
here without a stamp in their passport. There are no legal 
grounds for refusing people work at an AES, nor are there 
grounds for getting rid of extremists working at a power unit's 
control panel. The Law on Atomic Energy, the draft of which, 
according to Leonid Semenov, enshrines ``cadre'' norms, is one 
of those that legislators have failed to adopt since 1987. 
  So, imagine the worst case scenario: The reasonable 
organizers lose control of some quite peaceful demonstrations at 
an AES and determined people, ready for anything, fishing in 
troubled waters, become the masters of the situation. Or some 
outside terrorists take crack AES staff hostage, keep them in 
their sights to get through the guards, and dictate terms to the 
government: Immediate sovereignty for the Verkhnevzdyblenskaya 
[imaginary name, akin to Ruritania] Republic. 
  Earlier, even a couple of months ago, the country had the 
now-notorious ``Vympel'' to cope with that eventuality, whose 
superfighters were used at AES's since 1987. Each of them knew 
all the AES's like their own home and during exercises got 
through the seemingly impenetrable utilities layouts to reach 
the power unit, a feat that amazed even AES specialists. Thanks 
to the exercises, incidentally, the AES guard system was 
perfected; they are guarded by Internal Troops and this system 
has been tightened up year after year. 
  ``Vympel'' no longer exists now -- it has been transferred 
to 
the MVD [Ministry of Internal Affairs] and effectively 
devastated. The FCS is hoping to re-create something similar, 
but these unique skills take years to cultivate and who can say 
that the crack detachment's combat experience and knowledge will 
not be needed today or tomorrow? 
  I got the feeling from my talk with Col. Semenov that the 
problem is not just one of a fighting force, capable of 
combating ``nuclear'' terrorism. For good or ill, no one in the 
past doubted the special services' right (and qualifications) to 
play the prime role in an emergency. That is, the forces 
assembled by various departments in a ``hot spot'' to counter a 
serious danger always had a natural, universally recognized 
hierarchy to guarantee unified command of an operation. No one 
muscled in, everyone knew their place, their rights, and duties. 
Regrettably, last December's action against the terrorists 
spilling dollars over Dagestan showed that there was no sign of 
the former unified command since the presidential edict winding 
up the Russian Ministry of Security erupted precisely 21 
December. 
  My interlocutor in the FCS once again sees the Law on Atomic 
Energy, which has thus far not been adopted, as the solution to 
this power struggle. According to him, this law clearly sets 
out the rights and duties of each of the departments that 
oversees nuclear power generation. There has not yet been a 
tragedy, there is time, but the price of delay may be far more 
terrible than Chernobyl, which, as you know, blew up without any 
malicious intent on the part of those who caused the catastrophe.

  [Text] Moscow March 30 TASS--An explosion which occurred in 
the Osenny Boulevard in the vicinity of a new residence of the 
Russian president ``does not have a political colouring,'' 
ITAR-TASS was told at the Russian president's press service. 
``This is an ordinary crime,'' the press service said, relying 
on a conclusion made by competent interior officials. 
  At 12:30 p.m. Wednesday, an explosive device went off in a 
Zhiguli car parked in the yard of a house located in the Osenny 
Boulevard, 12, block 2. The explosion killed a driver of the 
``Oton'' trade company who lived there, and ``a criminal boss'' 
was injured. The criminal was hospitalized. Two more girls, 
aged 8 and 10, were injured. The explosion was presumably 
targeted at the ``criminal element'' interior officials said. 
  The incident occurred at a distance of one kilometer from a 
new city residence of the Russian president. Neither Boris 
Yeltsin, nor his family are living in the new house yet.

  [Excerpts] Moscow, 23 Mar -- Rescue teams are carrying out 
an on-the-spot investigation of the burnt-out debris of the 
Aerflot Airbus A-310-300 which crashed last night near 
Mezhdurechensk in Kuzbass and measures are being taken to find 
out what caused the airliner, regarded as one of the world's 
safest planes, to crash. [passage omitted] 
  Representatives of the Russian airlines' ground services 
state that no technical malfunction was registered on board the 
airliner prior to its flight. This is the reason why foreign 
news agencies speak of an act of subversion on board the plane. 
Some local residents, who saw and heard a mid-air explosion, 
are also of the same view. [passage omitted]

  [Excerpt] [Announcer Aleksandr Sapozhnikov] [passage 
omitted on details of crash] Several different versions of what 
happened to the plane have already emerged. According to Yuriy 
Korenevskiy, deputy head of the air transport department of 
Russia's Transport Ministry, the plane's abrupt fall and crash 
could only have been caused by instantaneous decompression of 
the interior, caused by an explosion aboard the aircraft or 
collision with another object. However, Korenevskiy said that 
the professionalism and training of the A-310 crew is not in any 
doubt. 
  Yuriy Vorobyev, first deputy minister for emergencies, said 
literally the following: The plane crash in Siberia happened 
suddenly. The crew did not transmit an SOS. So, the 
possibility of an act of terrorism cannot be ruled out.

authorities refuse to come to the negotiating table, if the 
genocide against the Kurdish population continues, we will 
continue the struggle,'' Jamal Qadir, a spokesman for the

conference in Moscow. This was organized under the title 
``Kurds: Fight for Survival'' in conjunction with the 
Association of CIS Kurds. It was attended by Yuriy Nabiyev, 
chairman of the association's Political Council. 
  J. Qadir gave specific examples of genocide against the 
Kurdish nation. Thus two Kurdish villages whose population 
boycotted the 27 March local elections were bombed and totally 
wiped out recently in southeastern Turkey. People were killed 
and wounded. 
  He described as lies and provocation the rumors that the 
NLFK 
is training fighters on Armenian territory and also that it was 
involved in the recent explosion on the Baku subway. [passage

explosion took place in one of the Tbilisi districts. The roof 
of the ``Ibervizia'' independent TV Company, located on the 
Vazha-Shavela Avenue in downtown, was blown down. 
  As the head of the Georgian Home Affairs Ministry 
press-center Valerian Gogolashvili told SNARK, there were no 
victims, and the building of the TV company wasn't damaged. 
Gogolashvili characterized the accident as a terrorist act. 
  Series of terrorist acts in the capital of Georgia continue 
-- there have been 4 of them over the last month. Gogolashvili 
reminded setting on fire of a secondary school, fire in the 
dwelling district Vacke, explosion in the building of Mkhedrioni 
headquarters. 
  As for today's case, it should be noted that the independent 
channel had broadcast an interview with the former Defence 
Minister Georgiy Karkarashvili a few days ago. The latter 
accused the current Security Minister Igor Georgadze of 
spreading rumors claiming on his selling Sukhumi to Abkhazians 
for 72 thousand dollars.

  [Text] Berlin (DPA) -- Udo Steinbach, head of the German 
Orient Institute in Hamburg, has warned that further acts of 
violence may committed by Kurds in Germany. In an interview 
with the Berlin daily B.Z. (Tuesday edition), the expert on 
Turkey said: ``I would not rule out that, if the overall 
situation escalates, we will also have to fear an escalation of 
terrorism in our country, even up to hostage-taking.'' 
  To the extent to which the military situation in 
southeastern 
Turkey becomes more dramatic and the Germans continue to supply 
weapons, one is increasingly facing the Kurds' dissatisfaction, 
the scientist said. This is expressed more and more in militant 
actions. ``Therefore, we must also expect retaliatory attacks 
against German institutions,'' Steinbach said. Actually, 
highway blockades are already a step toward this end.

  [Text] The Greek Cypriot Administration has allowed the 
Kurdish Workers Party [PKK] and Armenian terrorists, who are 
trying to divide and fragment Turkey and who do not hesitate to 
shed the blood of their brethren in order to achieve their 
objectives, to establish a base in the Trodos Mountains in 
Paphos district. 
  It has been ascertained that the PKK terrorists and the 
ASALA 
[Armenian Secret Army for the Liberation of Armenia] militants 
have been training in guerrilla warfare on the Trodos Mountains 
since 1988. The mountains are under Greek Cypriot sovereignty. 
Meanwhile, it has been reported that the PKK--which is trying to 
get support from Greece and the Greek Cypriot administration, 
who are hostile to Turkey--has established financial links with 
the Armenian terrorist organizations. Reliable sources say that 
the PKK has given material aid worth $1.2 million to the 
Armenian terrorist organizations in accordance with PKK leader 
Abdullah Ocalan's instructions. They also say that the PKK gave 
material aid to the Armenian terrorists because they are 
fighting for similar objectives. 
  It has been reported that the PKK and the Armenian terrorist 
organizations--who get the funds they need from drug trafficking 
and arms smuggling and from foreign underground organizations 
that believe they stand to gain from the attempt to fragment 
Turkey--are trying to establish a new base in Paphos district. 
In fact, the foundations of that base have already been laid. 
  Turkey and the TRNC [Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus] 
have been worried by the Greek Cypriot Administration's close 
relations with the PKK and the Armenian terrorist organizations. 
Meanwhile, several circles in Azerbaijan are also concerned. 
They too are worried over the open support Greece and the Greek 
Cypriot Administration have given to the Armenian terrorist 
organizations, which, together with the Armenian bands that have 
occupied Nagorno-Karabakh in Azerbaijan, dream of creating a 
Greater Armenia. 
  The support Greece and the Greek Cypriot Administration have 
given to the PKK and the Armenian terrorist organizations has 
been assessed as a dangerous move that may further worsen the 
problems between the Azerbaijani and Armenian peoples, the Turks 
and Greeks, and the Turkish Cypriots and Greek Cypriots.

  [Text] The French Basque separatist organization, 
Iparretarrak, announced in a communique on Wednesday evening 
that it will continue the ``armed struggle'' for as long as 
``its essential aims have not been achieved.'' 
  Iparretarrak has, however, said that it might be prepared to 
reconsider its activist policy in the case of ``an unconditional 
amnesty of all Basque prisoners and a dialogue.'' 
  Iparretarrak has been blamed by police for setting an 
explosive device against a military truck in Dax on Monday 
evening.

<F P=106> [Paul Silvani report: ``Police Makes Important FLNC Arrests </F>
Near Bonifacio''] 
  [Excerpts] Ajaccio -- Fourteen heavily armed Corsican 
nationalists were arrested in the night of Sunday 27 to Monday 
28 March, when they were preparing to blow up a luxury tourist 
venue near Bonifacio (Southern Corsica). Several members of the 
commando are well-known members of the FLNC [Corsican National 
Liberation Front]-Historic Channel, a source close to the 
investigation in Paris explained. They apparently include a 
journalist from the Marseilles press and a wanted nationalist 
who went underground after being sentenced in absentia for a 
murder committed on Christmas day 1988 in a bar in Ajaccio. 
  Should the operation mounted by the island's gendarmerie and 
police, backed up by the RAID [Research, Assistance, 
Intervention, and Dissuasion Unit of the national police force], 
in the night of Sunday 27 to Monday 28 March in Bonifacio be 
seen as a kind of tit-for-tat response, as is being suggested in 
Corsica by some observers who think that the government has so 
far tried to play for time by handling the nationalists 
carefully? On 16 February, the FLNC-Historic Channel announced 
the end of the truce in assaults which it had observed since 22 
June 1993. [passage omitted] 
  However, the first major operation by the FLNC in Corsica 
failed on Sunday 27 March because of the steps taken by Police 
Chief Jean-Pierre Lacave. Several dozen men were asked to take 
part in a major assault intended to destroy the village of 
Piantarella (26 residential apartments) built in the tourist 
venue of Sperone, which contains the island's only big golf 
course. The operation seems to have been meticulously organized 
and the deployment of these men involved the use of land and sea 
resources. But police headquarters had specific information 
which justified the dispatch of the RAID to Corsica. 
<H5>  Impressive Arsenal </H5>
  In all, 120 police and gendarmes were involved. First, four 
individuals responsible for neutralizing the guards were 
detained, then 10 others who were to plant explosives in the 
development. Shots were exchanged without anybody being injured. 
Some members of the commando group were probably able to flee. 
During the day, two vehicles, one of which had been set on 
fire, and an 11-meter motor boat, also set on fire -- it had 
probably been used to bring some of the commandos to the spot -- 
were discovered in the area. An impressive arsenal was seized: 
60 bottles of butane gas, around 60 kg of explosives (dynamite 
and plastic explosives), six assault rifles, and 10 handguns, 
grenades, and detonators. 
  The success of this operation, the first of its kind since 
Corsica has suffered clandestine nationalist violence, suggests 
that following the lengthy period of dialogue launched by Pierre 
Joxe and continued by [Interior Minister] Charles Pasqua, the 
government is now determined to put an end to erroneous methods 
which do not have the public's approval. The supporters of the 
FLNC, who are found within Cuncolta Naziunalista and its 
satellite organizations, gathered outside the Ajaccio police 
headquarters where the 14 people detained are being held. In 
the night of Monday 28 to Tuesday 29 March, they were dispersed 
by the police, who used tear gas in response to stone-throwing 
and trash can fires. The detained activists will be transferred 
to Paris to appear before the 14th section of the public 
prosecutor's office responsible for terrorist cases.

claiming responsibility for the commando action at Sperone 
(Southern Corsica) during which 14 people were arrested. 
According to the statement there is ``no question of giving up

  As far as the FLNC is concerned the Sperone tourist complex 
is ``one of the symbols of the despoilment of Corsican land by a 
speculators' mafia.''

  [Text] Munich (DPA) -- According to the news magazine 
FOCUS, four RAF [Red Army Faction] members obviously escaped the 
police during the operation in Bad Kleinen. It is said that two 
so far unidentified persons -- a man and a woman -- whom police 
filmed in Bad Kleinen on 24 June, are two suspected terrorists. 
Police meanwhile assume that the couple was involved in the 
assassination of Trust Agency chief Detlef Karsten Rohwedder on 
1 April 1991. The magazine points to an internal paper of the 
Federal Office of Criminal Investigations [BKA], according to 
which the man might be the unknown person who was seen during 
the attack on Rohwedder. 
  A few hours before the operation on 27 June, police filmed 
another couple with a hidden camera in Bad Kleinen. BKA experts 
realized only later that these two people were suspected RAF 
members Daniela Klette and Ernst-Volker Staub.

<F P=106> [``Eu'' report: ``No All-Clear Possible Yet''] </F>
  [Text] Potsdam -- At the moment one cannot yet give the 
all-clear in the field of right-wing extremism. Despite the 
fact that the wave of violence in Brandenburg, which reached its 
climax at the end of 1992, has abated, right-wing extremism 
remains a central challenge to state and society. This was 
stressed by Interior Minister Alwin Ziel (Social Democratic 
Party of Germany) on the occasion of presenting the 1993 
Constitutional Protection Report. The paper provides detailed 
information about the activities and scope of political 
extremism as well as on the role and structure of the 
Constitutional Protection Office in Brandenburg, which is still 
in the process of being established. It is the first report of 
this kind that has been presented so far. Combating right-wing 
extremism will characterize the work of the coming years, 
Wolfgang Pfaff, head of the Brandenburg Office for the 
Protection of the Constitution, said. One needs long-term 
measures, which must also nip the problem in the bud by means of 
an appropriate youth and social policy. With this the impetus 
of the moment could be reduced. Above all the so-called Central 
German Youth Promotion Project (FMJ) continues to be the target 
of all efforts. The number of members is given as 100, with an 
upward trend. The organization openly picks up the usual topics 
of Nazi propaganda, the Constitutional Protection Report says. 
They are committed to Hitler's person and ``work.'' 
Anti-Semitic instigation and the denial of the holocaust are 
evidence of the cynical racism that is cultivated in the FMJ. 
  Constitutional Protection also watches increasingly the 
development of left-wing extremism. Since Berlin is so close, 
it is also encroaching on Brandenburg, which is proved by the 
militant squatters' scene in Potsdam, Pfaff said. Therefore, 
the personnel dealing with leftist violence in his office will 
now be increased, he said. At the moment, there are hardly any 
activities by the Red Army Faction (RAF). The RAF has other 
priorities, but that might change very quickly. 
  Pfaff said that there are about 500 rightist Republikaner in 
Brandenburg. In the past their activities were rather limited 
because of controversies among the leaders. However, there are 
signs that the Republikaner will gain in importance in the 1994 
election year. According to Pfaff, ``in the surroundings'' of 
right-wing extremist organizations there are also members that 
are moving toward the Republikaner. Nevertheless, the 
Republikaner cannot necessarily be considered as a collection 
pond of the rightist scene, because they are taking great care 
not to accept ``real neo-Nazis'' into their ranks.

increased their protective measures for ``Israeli objects'' in 
Bonn. Among other things, the police closed the main 
thoroughfare where the Israeli Embassy is located. In the next 
few days, residents will have to identify themselves if they 
want to get to their houses. Normal traffic is being diverted 
on a large scale. According to the police, the German security 
authorities have been given tip-offs that Israeli ``objects'' 
might become targets of terrorist attacks.

  There is ``very serious evidence'' of possible bomb attacks

<F P=106> [``DPA/sav'' report: ``Mielke, Too, Did Not Know Anything </F>
About the Bomb''; all Syrian names as published] 
  [Text] On Friday [25 March] former Stasi chief Erich Mielke 
was unexpectedly questioned as a witness in the trial concerning 
the bomb attack on the ``Maison de France'' [French cultural 
institute in Berlin] in August 1983. At the land court the 
86-year-old man said that he was not informed about the attack 
beforehand. 
  The witness, who was brought to the court from prison, did 
not want to give any further information about the involvement 
of the Ministry of State Security [MfS]. Ex-Stasi Lieutenant 
Colonel Helmut Voigt, who is accused of aiding and abetting 
murder, had referred to orders which led to the passing on of 
explosives to German Johannes Weinrich, a member of the 
``Carlos'' terrorist group. Weinrich is considered to be the 
triggerman of the attack, in which one man was killed. [see 15 
March Terrorism Report for item on Weinrich plot to assassinate 
former president Reagan] 
<H5>  Stasi Agents Kept Silent </H5>
  So far, the court has hardly made any progress in 
questioning 
the Stasi agents. Before Mielke, Harry Dahl, former head of the 
Antiterrorism Main Department, was questioned. However, he 
suffered from a defective memory. He was able to remember only 
one detail: He did not give Voigt the order. His superior, 
Horst Franz, refused to give evidence. Dahl's deputy, Guenter 
Jaeckel, also claimed that he did not have anything to do with 
the attack. 
  Despite these meager results, the judges can also rely on 
something solid, namely on the MfS documents. They say that in 
May 1983 it was feared that the Carlos group would carry out 
attacks in order to extort the release of terrorists imprisoned 
in France. In the following months, there was talk of planned 
attacks. In June 1983 the ``Maison de France'' is even 
mentioned as a potential target. 
  The reports from Voigt's department prove that the Stasi was 
excellently informed about the group surrounding the 
internationally wanted terrorist Carlos. It knew of previous 
attacks by this group on the Paris-Toulouse train, the 
Paris-Lyon fast train, and the Saudi Embassy in Vienna. It knew 
Syrian liaison men and was informed about their private lives. 
<H5>  Was Syria Involved? </H5>
  On 19 August 1983 the MfS received another important message 
from Hungary, according to which a certain El Sibai [al-Saba'i], 
a ``would-be kamikaze'' of Carlos' group, was on his way to 
Berlin. Six days later, according to the prosecution, El Sibai 
ignited the bomb in the ``Maison de France.'' For Senior Public 
Prosecutor Mehlis it is clear that ``all strings came together'' 
in Voigt's hands. 
  However, the trial does not just raise the question about 
the 
responsibility of the MfS. Syria, too, was involved in the bomb 
attack. Weinrich had not only a Syrian diplomatic passport, 
Damascus also supported the ``Carlos group'' with apartments, 
cars, and weapons. The embassies were ordered to fulfill all 
wishes of the gang. In Berlin terrorist Weinrich was cared for 
by Nabil Sharitah, a member of the Syrian Embassy and a man who 
is a mystery. [see 16 February and 1 March Terrorism Reports 
covering Sharitah's involvement] 
  Even though an arrest warrant was issued for the 43-year-old 
Syrian in Germany, he gave himself up to the authorities during 
the trial. Voluntarily, as the diplomat stressed. However, 
Chritah did not live up to his boast that he would incriminate 
Syria. After a visit by Syrian Embassy members, he cleared 
Damascus: ``Syria had nothing to do with that.''

<F P=106> [Peter Scherer report: ``RAF Split?''] </F>
  [Text] [Editor's note: see similar report in item 
AU2403194894 in previous Terrorism Report] Frankfurt/Main -- 
``Currently profound developments are taking place'' in German 
left-wing extremist terrorism. This is revealed by an analysis 
of the current situation by the Federal Office for the 
Protection of the Constitution [BfV], in which the authority 
points in particular to important changes in the situation 
within the terrorist Red Army Faction (RAF). The RAF is 
entangled so much in quarrels about is direction that there has 
even been a split of the militant extremist organization, the 
BfV report says. Its so far stable structure -- a complex 
construct consisting of the so-called command echelon, the 
``prisoners' collective,'' and about 250 supporters, the ``RAF 
scene'' -- has ``broken apart.'' 
  Links between members of the RAF scene and the also 
left-wing 
extremist Workers Party of Kurdistan (PKK) are known. Thus, the 
authorities noted recently that an activist who belongs to the 
RAF scene participated in a ``leading function'' in a 
PKK-controlled Kurdish solidarity rally in Bonn. At a meeting 
of the Hanns-Seidel Foundation in Budapest, BfV Vice President 
Frisch discussed the ``international ties'' of the RAF scene. 
There he cited the ``participation in demonstrations against 
the PKK ban and the trips of some members of the RAF scene to 
Turkey.'' 
  However, Frisch did not talk about PKK support by the RAF 
command echelon or of a ``massive, in particular logistical 
support,'' the BfV said, correcting corresponding press reports 
yesterday. 
  The RAF has further expanded its contacts and its ties with 
other European terrorist groups. This also applies to its links 
with the banned Turkish extremist organization ``Devrimci Sol'' 
(Revolutionary Left). In the meantime, the ``Dev Sol'' has even 
been integrated in the ``SpinnenNetz'' [CobWeb] mailbox system, 
which was started in 1991 -- an information and leadership 
instrument of the inner RAF scene, which is camouflaged as an 
``information shop'' of the ``antifascist action.''

<F P=106> [Peter Scherer report: ``Kanther: The PKK Will Not Be Left </F>
in Peace''] 
  [Text] Wiesbaden -- Interior Minister Manfred Kanther 
(Christian Democratic Union) has emphatically warned the banned 
extremist Kurdish Workers Party [PKK] against the continuation 
of its violent actions on German soil. In the event of further 
obvious infringements of the law, the state will react ``very 
clearly and in a tough manner because softness is apparently 
considered a weakness on our part,'' Kanther stated in an 
interview with DIE WELT. The appropriate instruments are the 
penal code, the aliens' law, the law relating to associations, 
and particularly ``serious consideration of deportation.'' 
Since it is obvious that numerous PKK supporters do not 
primarily fear the German penal code but are more afraid of 
having to leave the country, deportation must be applied as far 
as possible, Kanther stressed, confirming the government's 
position. 
  At the same time Kanther spoke in favor of examining all the 
Kurdish associations, some of which have recently been founded 
and which should be considered cover organizations for the PKK. 
Since the PKK continues its ``conspiratorial activities'' 
despite its ban in Germany, the minister demanded that the 
authorities should constantly examine PKK activities. The PKK 
should know that it ``will never again be possible for the party 
to carry out their activities unimpeded'' if it continues to 
resort to violence. ``We will continue to disrupt them.'' 
  However, this position toward militant Kurdish extremists 
does not rule out ``establishing closer relations with the 
peaceful Kurdish and Turkish population,'' Kanther stressed. 
Not all Kurds are PKK supporters. Many of them are threatened 
by PKK criminals and are afraid. In this connection, Kanther 
appealed to the overwhelming majority of the law-abiding Kurdish 
population in Germany to ``reject'' the influence of violent PKK 
criminals. The minister regretted that so far they have not 
``distanced themselves sufficiently'' from the PKK. 
  According to Kanther, the burden for internal security 
resulting from extremism among foreigners and general crime 
among foreigners represents a major challenge for the state. 
Serious crimes are often committed by foreigners who stay only 
for a short period in Germany, including particularly asylum 
seekers. 
  Yet internal security continues to be threatened by German 
extremists, too. During the interview, the interior minister 
admitted publicly for the first time that the antiterrorism 
operation of Bad Kleinen has only brought ``little progress 
concerning the knowledge about the terrorist Red Army Faction 
[RAF].'' However, the evaluation of the documents of the 
suspected terrorist Hogefeld has not yet been completed. 
  Irrespective of the numerous ``tensions, splits, and 
cracks'' 
within the RAF groups, one must still proceed from the premise 
that the terrorists continue to be dangerous, Kanther stressed. 
Yet there is no certain reply to the question as to whether the 
RAF is determined to continue carrying out individual terrorist 
operations. There is no doubt that the perpetrators have also 
realized the ``obvious failure of RAF terrorism to change social 
conditions.'' According to Kanther, the reason for the current 
ideological debate within the RAF is the ``emerging realization 
of the complete absurdity of their operations.'' 
  It is difficult to assess whether it is possible for the 
state to promote this process of reflection through certain 
signals, the minister pointed out. However, the state must 
refrain from ``wrong interpretations.'' ``This was the reason I 
insisted that the Bad Kleinen incident should be cleared up 
completely so as to refute the myth that a helpless man had been 
killed by the police.'' 
  Kanther made it totally clear in this respect ``that RAF 
criminals must be treated in the same way as other offenders.'' 
Those who obviously no longer represent a danger to their 
environment after many years in prison, those who repent their 
crimes and pledge not to commit any similar ones in the future 
can be spared punishment and pardoned on the basis of the 
existing law. However, ``if RAF criminals declare their 
continued support of violence and would thus represent a danger 
for their compatriots in freedom, they cannot be released.''

  [Text] According to an ATHENS NEWS AGENCY dispatch, the 
Orthodox Patriarch's quarters at Fanari in Istanbul was attacked 
last night with two Molotov cocktails. According to the 
dispatch, at 2200 [1900 GMT] last night, unidentified people 
threw the two Molotov cocktails from the northern wall into the 
yard between the central building and library. Patriarch 
employees dealt with the fire before it caused any extensive 
damage. The fire department did not need to intervene. Turkish 
police are investigating the case. Similar incidents have 
occurred at least four times in the past couple of months but no 
effective safety measures have been taken at the Patriarch's 
quarters.

  [Excerpts] One person died and another two were slightly 
injured last night in Vitoria when a bomb went off in the city 
center. The blast also caused substantial material damage in 
the area. The civil government has confirmed that the deceased 
is a young man who was carrying the device. Maria Jesus 
Iparaguirre is at the scene: 
  [Iparaguirre] [Passage omitted] The area is still cordonned 
off and the remains of the body, somebody who apparently was 
carrying or handling the device, are still here. According to 
Cesar Milano, the civil governor and the acting governmant 
delegate, the device could have comprised 15 or 20 kilos of 
amonal or amosal and shrapnel. Therefore, the target could have 
been a member of the state security forces. The incident took 
place at around 0520. [passage omitted] About 20 cars and 60 
dwellings have been affected. This is a shopping area and many 
shops have had their windows and interiors completely destroyed.

  [Excerpt] By three votes to one, the First Chamber of the 
Appeal Court has issued the final ruling on the case involving 
Basques. It upheld the extradition of Jesus Maria Lizarralde 
Izaguirre, who was indicted for causing damage and destruction, 
illegal association, and illegally taking hostages. [see 22 
March Terrorism Report for previous reporting on this issue] 
  Uruguayan justice has thus granted three extraditions to its 
Spanish counterpart. 
  The Basques who will be extradited are: Jesus Maria 
Lizarralde -- whose extradition was granted yesterday -- Jesus 
Goitia Unzurrunzaga, and Mike Ibanez Oteiza, all of whom are in 
custody at the Central Police Precinct jail. 
  The extradition requests on Pedro Maria Gomez, Jesus Lariz, 
Juan Jose Urrutia, and Amaia Araqustain, was rejected by a 
hearing court and upheld by the Appeal Court. 
  By three votes to one, the Appeal Court rejected Mirem 
Argutzane Delgado Iriondo's extradition, thus overturning a 
ruling by a hearing court. They were released. 
  The extradition of the three Basques who have been charged 
by 
the Spanish Government with belonging to the ETA [Basque 
Fatherland and Liberty] will not take place right now since they 
-- together with the other five who have been released -- have 
pending lawsuits under way here for the use of false documents.

<F P=106> [``Exclusive'' interview with Hasan Dag, head of the </F>
National Liberation Front of Kurdistan (ERNK) in Athens, by Dina 
Vayena; date not given] 
  [Excerpts] ``Last year's campaign against Turkish tourism 
was only a warning. The true campaign will begin this year and 
will take on the characteristics of war.'' 
  Hasan Dag (``Dag'' means mountain), head of the National 
Liberation Front of Kurdistan (ERNK) office in Athens, speaks 
with the same calm, reserved but determined tone that he adopts 
every time he talks to press representatives. [passage omitted] 
  Our discussion came after the bomb explosion in the yard at 
Aya Sofya a few days ago which injured three foreign tourists 
and for which the PKK [Workers Party of Kurdistan] claimed 
responsibility. We also discussed future developments in the 
Kurdish movement for independence within the political scene 
being formulated in Turkey after the recent communal elections. 
  ``Why Aya Sofya, a major symbol of Orthodoxy?'' I asked him, 
and his expression was not apologetic in the least when he 
turned around and said: ``It is our party's decision to strike 
at tourist targets in Turkey. We will strike one by one at all 
the tourist targets, including Aya Sofya and the area around it 
which is also a tourist target inside the Turkish state. Our 
action had no other sort of meaning.'' 
  There were human victims in earlier PKK operations as well 
as 
in this one. Hasan Dag says that ``the attacks against Turkish 
tourism are part of our war operations and it is natural that 
there are human victims. We regard the whole of Turkey as a war 
zone and for this reason there cannot be tourists in a country 
where war is being waged. There is war going on in Bosnia, 
Nagorno-Karabakh, and South Africa, and there are no tourists in 
these area. So, why should tourists visit Turkey?'' 
  The warning also concerns the Greeks: ``In a belligerent 
area we cannot distinguish the targets. What we are interested 
in is that no tourist exchange enters Turkey. Consequently, the 
Greeks must not visit Turkey. The Greek tourist agencies must 
not organize tours there and the Greek ship owners must not 
organize cruises to the Turkish coasts but rather to the Greek 
islands.'' [passage omitted] 
  The strict order from the Kurdish Democratic Party and the 
outlawed PKK to the Kurdish population was general abstention or 
casting invalid votes in the Turkish communal elections. The 
PKK particularly stressed this order by executing some local 
candidates of big Turkish parties who were of Kurdish origin. 
[passage omitted] 
  -- Were the PKK's execution of Kurdish candidates not cruel 
actions? [Vayena question as published] 
  ``When we boycott the election, those candidates cannot 
fulfill the desires of the Kurdish people. They were traitors. 
They were the men of the Turkish state and mercenaries. Do not 
forget that the Turkish Army has not stopped its attacks against 
our villages even for a single day.'' [passage omitted] 
  Hasan Dag also talks about the reinforcement of the Turkish 
military forces in Kurdistan, whom he estimates to total 400,000 
well-armed men. He also notes the firm tactical armed 
resistance by the Kurdish guerrillas: ``At this time we have 
30,000 men and women fighters and there is provision for more 
than 50,000 by the end of 1994. On the Kurdish mountains we 
maintain 70 military training camps. In the next few months we 
will transfer the war to the big Turkish cities, to Istanbul, 
Ankara, Izmir, and we will be all the more dynamic. We will 
strike fatal blows at the Turkish economy, which is already 
facing a crisis.'' 
  Hasan Dag admits that this is a war with unequal forces both 
in terms of men and weapons. However, as he put it, ``we have a 
different approach. Our strongest weapon is our people's will. 
When we began the armed struggle in 1984 with 300 men in all, 
the Turkish generals boasted that they would annihilate us in 72 
hours.'' 
  ``Today, 10 years later, we continue the war and we have 
gained our people's respect.'' [passage omitted]

<F P=106> [Report by Evren Deger: ``Initiative To Establish a Kurdish </F>
Red Crescent Society'' -- all punctuation as published] 
  [Text] Ankara--The Kurdish Workers Party [PKK] has made an 
initiative to establish a Kurdish Red Crescent Society in 
Greece. It has been ascertained that Hasan Dag, head of ERNK 
[Kurdish People's Liberation Front], which is the PKK's 
political wing, and Retired Admiral Andonios Naksakis, who 
facilitates PKK's activities in Greece, appealed to the 
Governor's Office in Athens to approve the establishment of the 
society. It has been reported that the society will be based in 
building No. 72 on Ipokratis Street in Athens if the appeal is 
approved. 
  Turkish officials have been informed that the Governor's 
Office has not yet responded to the PKK's appeal. However, they 
assessed the initiative as being aimed at ``facilitating 
Greece's financial aid to the PKK by having ERNK recognized by 
the Greek Government.'' Stressing that the approval of the 
appeal for the establishment of that society for humanitarian 
purposes will create an opportunity for Greece to support the 
PKK more easily, the officials said: ``The realization of their 
project will facilitate Greece's contacts with the PKK through 
that society, which will supposedly be a humanitarian 
establishment. Consequently, Greece will find it easier to 
resist international reaction.'' 
  It is common knowledge that Greece has given material aid to 
the PKK and allowed it to establish camps in that country for a 
long time. The file that was submitted to Prime Minister Tansu 
Ciller on the PKK in December 1993 said that Greece paid 30,000 
drachmas monthly to ERNK members. It also said that Greece has 
supplied ``Aris'' antitank missiles to the PKK and deposited 100 
drachmas in the National Bank for each PKK member. The file 
informed Ciller that Greece provided $10,000,000 for the PKK in 
the form of aid in accordance with former Foreign Minister 
Andonios Samaras' instructions. Meanwhile, the PKK received 
another $1,000,000 to undermine tourism in Turkey. 
  The file also informed Ciller as follows: 
  A. The Lavrion refugee camp, which is 70 km southeast of 
Athens, has been given to the PKK. PKK activities in Greece are 
carried out by ERNK and the Kurdistan Committee in Athens. 
  B. An account has been opened in the Kaningos branch of the 
National Bank of Greece for PKK members in the Lavrion camp. 
The account number is 129/62639077. PKK members Samil Asmaad 
and Sinan Aslan are responsible for the affairs of Kurds in 
Greece. 
  C. The radio channel known as ``Phonitou Kourdhistan'' 
[Voice 
of Kurdistan] is operated by the PKK in Greece. 
  D. The Greek Ministry of Foreign Affairs has given 
scholarships to 33 PKK members in Greece.

  [Text] Diyarbakir, Turkey, March 27 (AFP) -- Fourteen 
people were killed and over 20 injured in an explosion in the 
village of Kocagili in south-eastern Turkey, well-informed 
sources in the regional capital of Diyarbakir said on Sunday [27 
March]. 
  According to injured survivors in Diyarbakir hospital, the 
village was attacked on Saturday by fighter planes of the 
Turkish airforce. 
  But authorities in the region denied this version of events, 
saying instead that a minibus had hit a mine near the village. 
  Also in Diyarbakir, a grenade was thrown at a school being 
used as a polling station in Sunday's municipal elections, 
slightly injuring two people. 
  By close of polls at 4:00 PM (1300 GMT), this was the only 
violent incident in the city directly linked to the elections 
despite threats against voters by Kurdish separatists.

  [Text] Istanbul, March 27 (AFP) -- Three tourists were 
injured Sunday when a bomb exploded in the gardens of the Saint 
Sophia mosque [as received], the Anatolia agency said. 
  A German man and a Spanish woman were taken to a hospital, 
the agency said. The third tourist, who is Dutch, was treated 
for light injuries and discharged. 
  Investigators said the device, a fragmentation bomb, 
exploded 
at noon (0900 GMT) in the gardens of the historic mosque and 
museum. 
  It was the second time in four days that tourist attractions 
had been the target of attacks. On Thursday a bomb explosion 
injured four people, including two Romanian women, in the heart 
of the city's historic tourist district. [see previous Terrorism 
Report] 
  Although there was no immediate claim of responsibility for 
either attack, police suspect they were the work of the outlawed 
separatist Kurdistan Workers' Party (PKK). 
  There was no clear indication that the bombing was linked to 
the PKK's earlier threat to disrupt Sunday's municipal elections. 
  The separatist group operates mainly in Turkey's 
southeastern, predominately Kurdish region. But last summer 
they announced that they would begin attacking cities and 
tourist sites in western Turkey. 
  Since that announcement, attacks on tourist sites have been 
rare, but several attacks have been perpetrated, notably in 
Antalya, on the southern Mediterranean coast, and in Istanbul. 
  The Saint Sophia mosque on the western side of Istanbul is a 
sixth century Byzantine church that was transformed into a 
mosque when Constantinople was taken over by the Turks in 1453. 
The site attracts thousands of tourists every month.

<F P=106> [Report by Ismet G. Imset] </F>
  [Excerpts] Diyarbakir--Over 250,000 Turkish troops are set 
to launch a historic military operation against Kurdish rebels 
in southeastern Turkey immediately after the March 27 local 
elections. 
  The operation, dubbed ``operation cleansing'' in 1991, was 
postponed at least three times before Prime Minister Tansu 
Ciller recently approved it. 
  Security forces said the main aim of the attack was to block 
logistical support to the outlawed Kurdistan Workers' Party 
(PKK) and to deliver ``the final blow'' to the organization by 
August, just before the retirement of Chief of Staff Gen. Dogan 
Gures and other senior Turkish senior Turkish force commanders. 
The first stage, or ``ground-breaking level'' of the operation, 
has already been completed over the past year, aiming to curb 
local sympathy and support to the PKK. 
  As part of this major plan, which resembles Turkey's past 
policies of repressing 28 separate Kurdish rebellions, a total 
of 900 villages in this troubled region have already been 
evacuated and burned down. [passage omitted] 
  According to sources close to the Ankara government, the 
proposal for the upcoming operation, which is expected to be 
launched next week, was first made to Mesut Yilmaz, who was 
prime minister of Turkey in 1991. 
  Yilmaz, now the chairman of the main opposition Motherland 
Party (ANAP), stalled his approval with an indirect refusal, 
owing mainly to the risks involved. 
  Sources say the proposal for a ``regional cleansing'' of 
``PKK militants and sympathizers'' was later put to Yilmaz's 
successor Suleyman Demirel at the end of 1991, but although he 
rejected it twice, it was still put underway as a plan. [passage 
omitted] 
  In the coming weeks, Turkey is to concentrate mainly on 
cutting logistic supply routes to the separatists, hitting the 
``mountain units'' and arming local villagers against them. In 
many areas, villagers have been informed that they can either 
accept state-issued weapons to combat the PKK or will be 
regarded and treated as ``members of PKK.'' 
  Sources say the military now has the full backing and 
authority to conduct operations in the region to ``solve'' the 
crisis. Local authorities reportedly regard the situation as a 
``Tansu Ciller-military'' coalition ``open card'' to the Armed 
Forces. [passage omitted]

<F P=106> [By Ian Graham, PRESS ASSOCIATION] </F>
  [Excerpt] The IRA tonight announced a three-day ceasefire 
from Tuesday next week as Prime Minister John Major arrived in 
Northern Ireland for a visit. 
  Speculation had been rife that a ceasefire was imminent and 
that it could be open-ended. In the end, they said they were 
suspending offensive military action for 72-hours from midnight 
Tuesday, 5 April to midnight Friday, 8 April. 
  The IRA said: ``Our statement of March 13 reiterated our 
continued willingness to be positive and flexible in exploring 
the potential for moving the situation forward. As further 
evidence of this, we will unilaterally suspend offensive 
military action for 72 hours from midnight Tuesday, 5 April 
until midnight Friday, 8 April. There are no conditions attached 
to this unilateral initiative, but we hope that the British 
government will accept this further opportunity in the spirit in 
which it is offered and utilise it to the best advantage of the 
British and Irish people.'' 
  The IRA made it clear that what they wanted was 
clarification 
of the Downing Street declaration signed by Mr. Major and Albert 
Reynolds on December 15 and not immediate negotiations. 
  It is understood the thinking behind the statement was that 
the IRA wanted to make what they considered to be a gesture of 
goodwill in an effort to break the current impasse. 
  The Government has repeatedly insisted that there can be no 
talks with Sinn Fein until the declaration was accepted and a 
permanent end to violence called and seen to be in operation. 
  The IRA statement also said: ``Making peace is a difficult 
business for all involved but the difficulties must be overcome. 
That too is the responsibility of all involved, but particularly 
the British Government. We hope that the further opportunity 
here provided is used to that purpose and effect.'' 
  Mr. Major, arriving in Belfast shortly before the IRA's 
announcement tonight, said he thought a ceasefire over the 
Easter period would be cynical. What people wanted was a 
permanent end to violence, not just a brief public relations 
gesture. [passage omitted]
