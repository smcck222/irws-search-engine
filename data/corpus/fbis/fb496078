    Editor's Note: The FBIS Terrorism Desk welcomes 
suscribers' comments and suggestions at (703) 733-5512. 
  Highlights and major incidents in this edition of 
the FBIS Terrorism Report include: 
<H5>  Cambodia/U.S. </H5>
  The Khmer Rouge abducted an American missionary and her 
Cambodian colleagues on 31 March, demanding that the missionary 
group dig wells in their area. Five Cambodians who were released 
reported that they were well treated. 
<H5>  Colombia/U.S. </H5>
  Police believe that the Revolutionary Armed Forces of 
Colombia (FARC) kidnaped U.S. citizen Ramon Rissin, the security

in Arhus, Denmark in December 1993, Danish police report that 
they found addresses and phone numbers of suspects in the World 
Trade Center bombing. 
<H5>  Germany/Algeria/Turkey </H5>
  In two separate reports--one from an Arabic magazine, and 
one from a German paper--Germany is characterized as an overseas

<H5>  FOREIGN MEDIA NOTES: ALGERIA </H5>
  ALGERIAN ABSTRACTS #5: REPORTING ON ARMED ISLAMIC GROUP 
<H5>  Slain GIA Members Identified </H5>
On 28 February EL WATAN reported that ten members of the Armed 
Islamic Group (GIA) including their leader Si Ahmed Mourad, 
known as El-Afghani, (alias "Seif Ellah" [Sayf Allah] according 
to LIBERTE of 1 March) had been shot down by police forces in 
Bouzareah. According to EL WATAN, other GIA members killed were 
Rachid Djabri, Beraf ta Aissa, Daas and Lounici; the other five 
members killed have not yet been identified. However, LIBERTE of 
28 February reported that the death of Aissa was not yet 
confirmed. 
  EL WATAN reported the following biographical information on 
slain GIA members: Si Ahmed Mourad, a 29-year old Afghani 
veteran living in Kouba had been condemned to death in abstentia 
by the Algier's Special court. Mourad is reportedly the author 
of several assassinations and behind numerous horrible crimes 
attributed to the GIA. He was also responsible for the 
kidnapping of the officers from the French Consulate last 
October which resulted in the death of five GIA members and the 
escape of El-Afghani, Beraf ta Aissa, Rachid Djabri and Guezmir 
Mohamed. Mohamed was later killed by police. 
  Berafta Aissa and Rachid Djabri were thirty-five and 
twenty-nine years old respectively, both residents of Algiers. 
An arrest warrant had been issued for his participation in 
committing several murders and various crimes in the region. 
Daas had reportedly been head of the GIA in the Bouzareah 
region. He too was wanted for several murders in the 
neighborhood. 
<H5>  Reaction to Slaying of GIA Members </H5>
  According to EL WATAN of 28 February the slaying of GIA 
members on 27 February in not only "a brilliant success for the 
forces of order but also a severe blow to the organization and 
structure of the terrorist groups." The slaying of El-Afghani 
and his followers, considered "the bloodiest and the most 
radical of the fundamentalist armed groups within the terrorist 
movement" is viewed as a "decisive turning point" in a three 
year struggle against "terrorism." While historically, according 
to EL WATAN, a new leader generally emerges, the loss for this 
group is believed to be so significant that it is "reasonable to 
think that a considerable slakening and a reduction from these 
blows is expected." The article recognizes that a murderous 
reaction on the part of those remaining in the group cannot be 
downplayed. 
  Given El-Afghani's refusal to support any dialogue between 
the Islamic Salvation Front (FIS) and the government, this wing 
of the GIA was considered a "serious barrier to dialogue." Now, 
however, according to EL WATAN, "if the disappearance of 
El-Afghani and his followers does significantly paralyze the 
actions of the group, his dissappearance should logically open 
channels for dialogue." Given the GIA's threats, under the 
leadership of El-Afghani, to kill all Islamists who engaged in 
any kind of negotiations with the Government, EL WATAN asserts 
that his death was probably a priority and a prerequisite for 
any negotiations between the FIS and the government 
  LIBERTE of 28 February interpreted the operation as an 
indication of Algerian President Liamine Zeroual's determination 
to combat violence. "The successful attack demonstrated that the 
authorities not only had the intention of not giving respit to 
the armed groups, but in a pinch had the means to attack 
`terrorism.'" 
  According to LIBERTE, the first consequence of this incident 
for Zeroual is that it will "weigh heavily on government- FIS 
negotiations," given El-Afghani's resistence to dialogue. But, 
on the other hand, LIBERTE predicts that the government will 
clearly enforce its position, pointing out that the government 
can now "flaunt" its steadfastness to eradicate violence and 
perhaps will no longer tolerate dialogue while Algerians engage 
in violence. Finally, according to LIBERTE, the incident could 
mean that the government is simply in the process of "getting 
back on its feet." 
<H5>  New GIA Leadership; Organizational Structure </H5>
  Sayah Attia, according the French language weekly LE FIGARO 
of 9 March, has become the new chief of the GIA, replacing 
Mourad Si Ahmed. According to EL WATAN of 1 March, Attia's 
group is one of three groups operating under the name of Armed 
Islamic Group (GIA) outside of Algiers. Attia is reportedly 
operating in Medea, Ksar El Boukhari and Tissemsilt. He is 
reportedly a "bloodthirsty" individual, with a preference for 
hand-to-hand fighting. Son of an Harki, he has reportedly lead 
a "commando" of armed criminals. The commando is credited with 
having committed more than 200 terrorist acts described as the 
most murderous and savage. He is identified by security 
services as the principal instigator in the assassination of 
twelve Croats last December, killing approximately ten members 
of an official cortege. According to security services he is 
also responsible for an attack on the military barricks in 
Boughezoul in 1993. 
  ALGER REPUBLICAIN of 8 March reported that in 1989 Attia 
returned to Afghanistan through Saudi channels, where he 
remained for three years. He re-entered Algeria clandestinely 
in November 1992. The father of six children, plus a 
fourteen-year-old daughter of his second wife, Attia is 
reportedly responsible for 132 assassinations and 283 acts of 
aggression and vandalism. 
  Khaled Sehili heads the second group, which operates in 
Blida, El-Affroun, Chrea and Boufarik. Sehili is reportedly 
responsible for the slaying of at least 50 police officers and 
nearly 150 acts of sabotage. He is also reportedly responsible 
for an ambush which killed about 12 military personnel last 
September in Chrea. 
  Kada Benchiha heads the third group, which operates in Sidi 
Bel-Abbes. Benchiha is also son of an Harki. Given the 
geographic pecularities of this region, this group is composed 
of about 20 elements who reportedly easily slip through police 
blockades and various police sweeps in the region. Benchiha is 
reportedly responsible for the assassination of two French 
surveyors last September, and for fires wich ravaged ENIE 
[expansion no given] in Sidi Bel-Abbes last August.

<F P=106> [Article by "bba": "FBI Following Up Danish Trail in Bombing </F>
Case"] 
  [Text] Telephone numbers and addresses found on Egyptians 
being held in Denmark connect those jailed with the bombing of 
the World Trade Center (WTC), in which six died, and over 1,000 
persons were injured. 
  The bombing of the New York WTC may have connections to 
Denmark. The Arhus police four months ago arrested three 
Egyptians and charged them with attempted arson and purchasing 
chemicals for fabricating bombs. [see item 94WT0004B in 7 
January Terrorism Report] In searching their residence, the 
police found telephone lists with names and addresses of some of 
those charged with attempted murder in the United States. 
  "Therefore, we asked the FBI for help in clearing up our 
case. FBI colleagues have been in Denmark, and we have developed 
information. We don't know, however, whether those being held in 
this country have any concrete connection with the attempted 
murder case itself," said Arhus Deputy Police Chief Villy 
Sorensen. 
  ARHUS STIFTSTIDENDE yesterday wrote that a fingerprint of 
one 
of those jailed in the Arhus case is on an "object" found in 
connection with the follow-up investigation of the New York 
bombing incident. 
  "I won't comment on this," said Sorensen. He confirmed, 
however, that those being held in Arhus and those charged in the 
U.S. bombing attack are members of the same Islamic 
fundamentalist organization. 
  According to the deputy police chief, there is nothing to 
indicate that the individuals being held in Arhus were in New 
York when the bomb exploded in the WTC basement. 
  Nor have U.S. authorities requested that the jailed 
individuals be handed over for prosecution in the United States. 
  Two of those charged in Arhus -- ages 30 and 36 -- are 
asylum-seekers, while the third, a 41-year-old man, has 
permanent residence in Denmark after having lived here for 10 
years. The two asylum-seekers have told Danish authorities they 
are applying for asylum in Denmark because they are being sought 
in Egypt.

  [Text] According to well-informed sources, who spoke to AL- 
BILAD, the existence of "Jordanian Afghans," cannot be ruled 
out. But there are only a handful of them. They fled 
Afghanistan to Kenya among a group of other Arabs who have 
recently sought refuge in Africa. 
  Led by Ayman al-Zawahiri, an Egyptian medical doctor, this 
group is seeking entry into southern Sudan from Kenya. 
Al-Zawahiri has been to Nairobi a number of times in an effort 
to find a place for Arabs forced to leave Pakistan. Khartoum 
has balked at accepting them. 
  Over the past three months, there has been a mass exodus of 
"Arab Afghans" who have taken Pakistan's threats to expel them 
seriously.

  [Excerpt] Ankara -- Interior Minister Nahit Mentese 
announced that Russia was prepared to help Turkey put an end to 
the terrorist activities of the Kurdistan Workers' Party (PKK). 
  The two-day talks, chaired by Mentese and Russian Interior 
Minister Victor F. Yerin, were concluded on Thursday, the 
Anatolia news agency reported. 
  Turkey and Russia agreed on the measures to be taken against 
terrorism, drug trafficking and organized crime, according to 
Mentese. "Both sides aim at enhancing their present cooperation 
in matters of security, and we decided to hold a joint 
commission meeting as soon as possible," Mentese disclosed. 
  Meanwhile, Yerin announced that Turkey and Russia had agreed 
to struggle against crime in all its forms. 
  In response to a question about the link between the PKK and 
Armenia, Yerin announced that Russia and Armenia had been trying 
to reach an agreement on the issue of anti-terrorism. "Russia 
respects Armenia's sovereignty. 
  Turkey and Armenia have had contacts recently, and, 
furthermore, Turkey was among the countries sending humanitarian 
aid to Armenia. The improvement of relations between Turkey and 
Armenia would not harm Russia's interests. Russia and Armenia 
are currently enjoying friendly relations," Yerin stated. 
  "Moreover, the Kurdish conference in Moscow will not effect 
Russian-Turkish relations," Yerin said in response to another 
question. [passage omitted]

  [Text] PHNOM PENH, April 3 (AFP) -- Khmer Rouge [KR] 
guerrillas abducted an American woman with the Christian relief 
organization Food for the Hungry International (FHI) last week 
and have held her hostage for four days while demanding that the 
aid group digs them wells, the FHI director here said Sunday. 
  Melissa Himes, 25, from California, was abducted with eight 
Cambodian colleagues Thursday in southern Kampot province when 
they went to try to retrieve their truck that had been stolen at 
gunpoint from a work site near the Khmer Rouge zone, FHI country 
director Alan Haslett said. 
  Five Cambodians were let go on Friday with the demand that 
FHI agree to dig wells in their zone, he said. Himes and three 
colleagues remained captive through the weekend, he said. 
  "They have not asked for any money. I think they want wells 
put in specific villages," Haslett said. "They are holding our 
truck as well." 
  The released Cambodians said they had been well-treated but 
that they "had to pay for their dinner" with their captors, he 
said. 
  FHI had sent a message agreeing to discuss ways to meet the 
demand, but had not heard back yet from the Khmer Rouge, Haslett 
said. 
  "We're a Christian organization and we're here to help 
everyone" including people living under Khmer Rouge control, 
Haslett said. "We would like to find ways to help them 
(Cambodians) equally." 
  Himes has lived in Cambodia since January 1993, speaks the 
Khmer language well and has a good relationship with Cambodians 
living in the area, Haslett said. 
  Kampot, bordering the sea 150 kilometers (90 miles) south of 
Phnom Penh, is traversed by a mountain range harboring the Khmer 
Rouge guerrillas at the very end of the organization's supply 
lines. Guerrilla sorties to steal food in government-controlled 
valleys are common, and villagers are sometimes taken hostage in 
exchange for rice or cows. 
  The Khmer Rouge stole a number of UN cars during the United 
Nations peacekeeping operation in Cambodia, which ended in late 
1993, and several UN peacekeepers were held hostage during the 
incidents. All were treated relatively well and later set free 
after negotiations. 
  The Food for the Hungry International (FHI) project in 
Kampot 
focuses on improving rural water supplies and on agricultural 
development. FHI is a Christian organization headquartered in 
Geneva and operates in 16 countries in Asia, Africa and Latin 
America.

  The NADK has nothing to do with this matter and vehemently

  [Text] Tokyo, April 2 KYODO -- Police raided the office of 
a rightist group Saturday [2 April] in connection with the 
arrest of two of its members who held two ASAHI SHIMBUN 
executives hostage at the paper's headquarters in Tokyo the 
previous day. [see previous Terrorism Report] 
  Police searched the office of the "Taihi-kai" in Yokohama, 
Kanagawa Prefecture, after the arrests of its members Kuniyasu 
Uchiyama, 41, and Toshikazu Furusawa, 29. 
  Uchiyama and Furusawa were arrested Friday evening after 
holding Kei Aragaki, 57, an executive in charge of the paper's 
public relations department, and Mikinori Yoshida, 51, the head 
of the secretarial department, for nearly six hours in an 
executive reception room on the 15th floor. 
  The two men were armed with a handgun, a sword and carried 
four sticks of dynamite, police said. 
  The rightists surrendered and released the two hostages 
unharmed after police and the group's chairman, Kazuo Nakadai, 
urged them to abandon their mission, police said. 
  Aragaki told reporters at the headquarters Saturday morning 
that the two men repeatedly demanded during the hostage drama 
that newspapers and television networks report their point of 
view. 
  He said he rejected their demands. 
  As the pair broke into the building, they passed out 
pamphlets describing the country's mass media as a "class A war 
criminal" and called on the ASAHI SHIMBUN to "amend the tone of 
its news coverage." 
  The pamphlets also criticized Prime Minister Morihiro 
Hosokawa for refusing to retract a statement apologizing for 
Japan's wartime activities in Asia which he termed a "war of 
aggression." 
  "(It) was an unusual situation but I did not feel any fear 
because it didn't seem like they would hurt us," Aragaki said. 
  Aragaki said he told the two men as he was being released 
that "(Japan) is a democratic society, so why don't we debate?" 
He said Uchiyama replied, "we were reluctant to act like this 
but it was our choice of life." 
  On October 20 last year, Shusuke Nomura, 58, then leader of 
the group, entered the building and shot himself dead during a 
meeting with the company's executives in protest over the use of 
a cartoon parodying his group in a weekly magazine affiliated 
with the ASAHI SHIMBUN.

  [Text] Fort Capinpin, Tanay, Rizal -- New People's Army 
(NPA) rebel stragglers are intensifying terroristic acts against 
civilians as part of a last ditch propaganda campaign to show a 
still active presence of a rebel movement now in its dying 
throes, military authorities said yesterday. 
  Brig. Gen. Regino Lacson, Army 2d Infantry Division 
commanding general, said that last week alone, small teams of 
communist guerrilla terrorists attacked several groups of 
civilians in mountain barangays [villages] in three provinces. 
  In Barangay Casay, Lupi, Camarines Sur, last 24 March, 
rebels 
fired a grenade from an M-203 launcher at a "pulong-pulong 
[gathering]" of residents who were planning a livelihood project 
in cooperation with the military. A barangay captain, a woman 
and her seven-year-old son were wounded during the attack while 
scores of other residents were injured in the stampede for 
safety. 
  In a resettlement area in Barangay Caldon, Sampaloc, Quezon, 
three suspected NPA rebels sprayed another gathering of 
civilians, wounding a resident identified only as a certain 
"Boy" of the barangay last 20 March. 
  Last 25 March, at Barangay Salipsip, Polilio, Quezon, rebels 
fired on a house during a heavy rainfall. 
  Elements of the 236 PNP [Philippine National Police] Mobile 
Force who had taken cover from the rain in the house fired back 
at the rebels and a firefight that lasted for about 30 minutes 
ensued. 
  Residents said that three dead rebels were carried away by 
their companions when they escaped and policemen recovered from 
the encounter scene one M16 Armalite rifle.

  [Text] The Interior Ministry announced yesterday it would 
impose measures to thwart international terrorists from entering 
and operating in Thailand, including tighter control on the 
movements of some tourists, stricter controls on immigrants as 
well as improvements in intelligence-gathering. 
  Permanent Secretary for Interior Ari Wong-araya said after a 
meeting with the governors of 31 border provinces, Special 
Branch police and the National Security Council at the Interior 
Ministry yesterday that he told the participants to redouble 
their efforts to deter international terrorists from entering 
the country. 
  "The governors of border provinces were briefed on 
international terrorists and ways to prevent them from entering 
and carrying out missions in Thailand," Ari said. 
  He said although the focus of the plan was on international 
terrorists, provincial governors were also told to monitor the 
movements of possible would-be saboteurs in their jurisdiction. 
  Ari said stringent control on the movement of certain 
foreign 
tourists and immigrants was a priority to be carried out by the 
Immigration Division police. He said tighter immigration 
controls would be adopted. 
  He indicated that one of Thailand's neighbouring countries 
had been supporting terrorist activities in Thailand. He did 
not identify the country. 
  Ari said provincial governors had been instructed to closely 
monitor the movement of suspected terrorists in their 
jurisdiction and share the information with other provinces 
through a coordination centre at the Interior Ministry. 
  Provincial governors were also told to draw up their own 
plans to deal with international terrorists based on political 
and social factors unique to their respective areas, Ari said.

  [Excerpts] Police have enough evidence to issue warrants 
for the arrest of two men believed responsible for the 
truck-bomb discovered in Bangkok last month, city police chief 
Chaisit Kanchanakit said yesterday. [see 22 March Terrorism 
Report for incident coverage] 
  Chaisit said police had photographs of the two suspects, but 
he did not identify them as Thais or foreigners. He said 
information gathered by police was the same as that received by 
the National Intelligence Agency. [passage omitted] 
  Chaisit said he could not say whether the bomb had anything 
to do with international politics. 
  "I can say only that police already know who the culprits 
are 
and their intention. The suspects may still be in Bangkok," he 
said. Police would discuss with the Interior Ministry whether 
arrest warrants should be Issued.

  [Text] Terrorist bombings could not destabilize the 
government, police chief Prathin Santipraphop said yesterday, 
while admitting that the government's intelligence gathering 
ability is weak. 
  Pol Gen [Police General] Prathin said police had tightened 
security along southern railroads after the recent bomb which 
derailed a train. Police patrolled around the clock in certain 
areas. 
  Last week, a passenger train that left Hat Yai for the 
southern border town of Sungai Kolok detonated a bomb under the 
tracks, derailing 14 carriages and injuring 10 people. [see 
previous Terrorism Report] [passage omitted] 
  Prathin said the bombing was intended to create a 
disturbance. It was the work of the people with mental problems. 
  Prathin admitted that the country's intelligence service was 
ineffective. He had been told about the matter on several 
occasions, and found that it was true after he was appointed 
police director general. 
  Officers had not seriously performed their duty. They would 
try hard only when there was an incident. However, the 
intelligence had been improved, he said. 
  Prathin said police had done their best to provide security 
for people's lives and property. However, some acts of 
terrorism were impossible to prevent.

  [Excerpt] THE NATION: What will you do now that 
international terrorists have apparently penetrated our borders? 
  Yongchaiyut: The situation is certainly not out of 
hand yet. We have several devices we can employ to help us spy 
on the terrorists, such as an electronic device which can be 
placed on any concrete wall less than one-foot thick. That 
device will enable us to hear the conversations of the people 
behind the wall. However, terrorists could also monitor our 
electronic eavesdropping tools or communications equipment. 
  THE NATION: So, terrorists will know more about 
the movement of police from the department's equipment than the 
police will learn about the criminals. Is that right. 
  Yongchaiyut: That's it.

<F P=106> ["Special report" by Ekkaphum Wittayayut: "Who's behind the </F>
bomb attacks in the Kingdom?"] 
  [Excerpts] [passage omitted] Let's consider the probable 
intentions of the group responsible for the [recent] bombings: 
  A desire for political chaos and to create disruption in the 
country, and to make the government appear to be unfit to carry 
out the task to which it was elected because it is unable to 
maintain stability. 
  To increase pressure on the government at a time when 
parliament is in disarray with an intention of making it look 
incompetent in the eyes of the general public. It is possible 
this could lead to the dissolution of parliament. [passage 
omitted] 
  Political parties have no need to carry out terrorist acts 
to 
pressure the government. Their use of criticism during 
parliamentary sessions is usually adequate. 
  Opposition parties are unlikely candidates for the 
suspicions 
of those investigating the bombings. 
  Dictators who have fallen from the privileged position of 
political power are the most deserving for the focus of 
suspicion as they have the most to gain. 
  With the democracy system now firmly in place they are 
unlikely to be voted back into power by the electorate and their 
only route would seem to be one of violence with an aim of 
creating chaos -- an atmosphere in which they might be able to 
seize power again. 
  It is imperative, however, that the government quickly trace 
those responsible for the attacks if they wish to maintain an 
impression of competence. 
  The right-wing group of Gen Thanom Kittikhachon would be a 
good place to begin investigations although some observers have 
said that these groups are incapable of carrying out the attacks.

  [Text] Santa Fe de Bogota, 4 Apr (NOTIMEX) -- The Colombian 
enterprise ECOPETROL today stopped pumping crude oil through the 
Cano Limon-Covenas pipeline, the country's largest, after a new 
attack by the guerrillas. 
  ECOPETROL sources said the sabotage, which caused a moderate 
fire and spilled an unspecified quantity of crude oil, occurred 
at Km 150 between Arauquita and La Esmeralda, near the border 
with Venezuela. 
  According to the report, members of the National Liberation 
Army detonated three dynamite charges against the pipeline, 
damaging a sizable portion thereof and forcing suspension of the 
pumping, a suspension that will continue until it is repaired in 
a few days. 
  Colombia's oil infrastructure has become one of the Simon 
Bolivar Guerrilla Coordinating Board's main targets. The 
guerrilla organization attempts to thwart the participation of 
multinational enterprises in the export of oil. 
  Authorities of Arauca Department, where the recently 
discovered Cusiana oil fields are located, mounted a strong 
security operation to preclude new attacks.

    [Editorial Report] The following is a compilation of 
reports on Colombian guerrilla activities monitored through 4 
April. 
  Two police officers were killed when a two-kg explosive 
device launched against the home of Fabio Ospina Giraldo, former 
secretary of the Administrative Services of the Valle 
Governorship, exploded in southern Cali. This is the second 
time that police officers assigned to protect Ospina have been 
killed. (Santa Fe de Bogota EL TIEMPO in Spanish 30 March 94 p 
8a) 
  The Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia's (FARC) 12th 
Front burned 27 new vehicles being transported by car carriers 
on the Barrancabermeja-Puerto Araujo highway. Subversive 
checkpoints have appeared throughout the department. Military 
units in armored vehicles initiated an intense sweep operation 
where daily the guerrillas' actions cause significant losses to 
the transportation sector. (Santa Fe de Bogota Inravision 
Television Cadena 1 in Spanish 1800 GMT 31 March 94) 
  Army troops supported by helicopters attempted yesterday to 
encounter two guerrilla commandos that last Friday attacked two 
military patrols in Boyaca and Cesar, leaving eight dead 
soldiers and 11 wounded. Meanwhile, on 26 March ELN (Army of 
National Liberation) rebels dynamited once more the Cano 
Limon-Covenas oil pipeline at the Km 60 marker in Arauquita 
Municipality. As a result pumping was halted although it was 
resumed yesterday. In Bogota, the XIII Brigade uncovered a 
secret factory of guerrilla uniforms. (Santa Fe de Bogota EL 
TIEMPO in Spanish 27 March 94 p 19a) 
  Pedro Jose Chavarria David, alias "Colacho" or "El Mono," 
third man of the dissolved Popular Liberation Army's (EPL) 
dissident movement, was captured together with two other persons 
in a Medellin neighborhood, official sources reported today. 
The sources said that Chavarria is in charge of the finances of 
the EPL's dissident movement, which is comprised of 150 men who 
operate in the Antioquia, Risaralda, and Caldas departments. 
(Madrid EFE in Spanish 1637 GMT 1 April 94) 
  The Colombian Government today blamed FARC for the murder of 
Prospero Merino, councilman and political leader of the 
Caribbean community in Cienaga, Magdalena Department, in an 
attempt to hamper the 29 May presidential elections. Merino was 
shot in a small town outside Cienaga by five men who also killed 
Luis Sanchez accompanying him while two others were wounded. 
(Hamburg DPA in Spanish 1535 GMT 3 April 94) 
  Army sources disclosed an alleged terrorist plan by the 
guerrilla against several government institutions at the Narino 
Department. Authorities confirmed that at the former Public 
Works Ministry's camp were seized 230 kg of dynamite, 1,250 
meters of slow fuse, as well as maps of institutions to be 
allegedly attacked by the Farc's 29th Front. (Santa Fe de 
Bogota Emisoras Caracol Network in Spanish 1200 GMT 4 April 94) 
  On 30 March, guerrillas set 27 new cars and the trailer in 
which they were being transported on the Pan-American Highway 
near Barrancabermeja. In addition, a bus -- which was carrying 
no passengers -- was also destroyed on the road between 
Bucaramanga and Maicao. It was also reported that during the 
past few hours army troops killed seven FARC and ELN guerrillas 
during clashes in Santander and Putumayo. (Santa Fe de Bogota EL 
TIEMPO in Spanish 2 April 94 pp 1A, 8A) 
  Two presumed FARC guerrillas were killed on 1 April during 
clashes in the rural area of Sampues, Sucre Department. The 
Army confiscated a .38-caliber revolver, a .9-mm pistol, 
ammunition, and subversive propaganda. (Santa Fe de Bogota EL 
TIEMPO in Spanish 3 April 94 p 16A)

  [Text] Santa Fe de Bogota, 1 Apr (NOTIMEX) -- U.S. citizen 
Ramon Rissin, the Summer Linguistic Institute's security chief, 
has been kidnapped by guerrillas in Meta Department in southern 
Colombia, military sources confirmed today. The Army's 7th 
Brigade reported that Rissin was relaxing at a resort hacienda 
in Puerto Lleras, some 300 km from Santa Fe de Bogota, when he 
was abducted by six men who identified themselves as 
Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia, FARC, members. 
  With Rissin's abduction, the number of U.S. citizens 
kidnapped by FARC in Meta increases to three. In January, 
guerrillas took missionaries Steve Welch and Timothy Vandyck 
hostage while at a camp near Villavicencio. 
  The Army report says that FARC political propaganda was 
found 
at the site where Rissin was taken captive. The FARC is 
Colombia's largest and oldest rebel organization. "We can 
confirm Rissin's kidnapping, but we do not know the reasons for 
it," a 7th Brigade source said. He added that a special 
operation was mounted in the area to try to find Rissin. 
  On 3 March, National Liberation Army, ELN, guerrillas 
released, safe and sound, U.S. citizen Manning Lowis, who had 
been taken captive in the jungle of Choco Department, on the 
border with Panama, one year earlier. The FARC and ELN are part 
of the Simon Bolivar Coordinating Guerrilla Board, CGSB, which 
two years ago abandoned the peace negotiations with the 
Colombian Government in Tlaxcala, Mexico.

  [Text] [passage omitted] General Luis Bernardo Urbina

this kidnapping and other issues for Radio Caracol. 
  [Begin Urbina recording] He was riding a motorcycle along 
the 
highway between the municipal capital of Puerto LLeras and Loma 
Linda, where the Summer Linguistic Institute operates. During 
the trip he was intercepted by individuals we believe are--or we 
are certain are--members of the 43d Front of the FARC 
[Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia]. They violently took 
him away. We had certain information about where they initially 
took him, but we learned later they had moved. We have been 
unable to recontact them. [end recording] 
  Urbina also said there is no information on the whereabouts 
of the two U.S. missionaries Steve Welch and Timothy Vandyck, 
whom FARC guerrillas also kidnapped in the hamlet of San Jose, 
near Villavicencio, on 16 January.

  [Excerpt] Epaminondas Gonzalez Dubon, president of the 
Constitutionality Court and one of the country's most oustanding 
men in recent times, was killed last night. He was gunned down 
while going to his house on Seventh Ave., No. 750, Zone 2. 
Gonzalez Dubon, 64, was in a 1990 Mitsubishi white sedan with 
the license plate number 259-899 when two unidentified gunmen 
driving by in a red car shot him in the chest. 
  Gonzalez Dubon was rushed the Latinoamericano Hospital. He 
was admitted at approximately 2255, but died at 2310. Today, 
his body was taken to the Mancia Funeral Parlor in downtown 
Guatemala City, where he will be laid out and later buried.

  [Excerpts] Guatemala City, 2 Apr (DPA) -- The slaying of 
Constitutionality Court President Epaminondas Gonzalez Dubon is 
not an isolated incident, much less a common crime, 
personalities we have consulted have told DPA. [passage omitted] 
  Gonzalez Dubon's wife, the main witness to the killing, has 
said she does not believe the motive of the killing was a car 
theft, as certain versions have reported. She added there was 
no attempt to steal the car, and the assailants unloaded their 
weapons on the car, damaging it badly. 
  According to another version, unidentified gunmen were 
following Gonzalez, who tried to take shelter in his home, where 
they reached him. Apparently, police protection at the victim's 
home had been withdrawn due to the recent change of the interior 
minister. [passage omitted on funeral]

  [Excerpts] Mexico City, 3 Apr (DPA) -- The Guatemalan 
National Revolutionary Unity [URNG] today condemned the 
assassination of Epaminondas Gonzalez Dubon, president of the 
Guatemalan Constitutionality Court. The URNG said this 
"abominable incident" undermines the human rights agreement 
signed with the government. 
  According to a URNG communique published in Mexico City, the 
magistrate's assassination "bluntly reveals the opposition that 
exists within government sectors, particularly within the Army, 
to the Global Agreement on Human Rights," which was signed in 
Mexico City on 29 March. [passage omitted 
  The URNG also demanded that the security corps and the 
Guatemalan Army be purged "of the assassins opposed to peace and 
human rights" and deemed that "thorough measures, not just 
publicity and cosmetic measures" are needed. 
  Meanwhile, the guerrillas also called on the United Nations, 
the mediator in the peace talks between the government and the 
URNG, to send a preparatory mission for the verification of 
human rights to Guatemala "without delay" as established in the 
agreements signed in Mexico City.

<F P=106> [Report by Lucia Dubon] </F>
  [Excerpts] A news conference by National Police spokesman 
Fernando Lopez has just concluded in the parking lot of the 2d 
Division Headquarters of the National Police. Some very 
important information was disclosed regarding the status of the 
investigation into the murder of the Constitutionality Court 
President Epaminondas Gonzalez Dubon. Here are some statements 
by National Police spokesman Fernando Lopez: 
  [Begin Lopez recording] [words indistinct] members of the 
domestic and international press in order that you as well as 
the Guatemalan people can get an idea of the condition in which 
Magistrate Epaminondas Gonzalez Dubon's vehicle was found. 
Again, the incident took place at the intersection of Seventh 
Street and Seventh Avenue in Guatemala City's Zone 2. [passage 
omitted] 
  As you may know, we have recovered five .38 caliber bullets. 
This one was taken out of the body of Magistrate Epaminondas 
Gonzalez Dubon. This one is a fragment found inside the 
vehicle. As you can see, when it hit the car it split into 
[words indistinct] and the rest was found in the magistrate's 
body. This one was found in the door of the vehicle, and this 
other bullet was found in the [word indistinct] located in the 
rear. This bullet was found in the trunk, and this one was 
embedded in the vehicle's spare tire. 
  These five bullets correspond to the five shots fired at the 
vehicle. When we combed the area, we discovered a .45 caliber 
bullet that has nothing to do with the bullets that hit the 
magistrate's car. This bullet was found approximately 50 meters 
from the site where the .38 caliber bullets were found. By 
looking at the car, you can see these three impacts [words 
indistinct]. The only bullet to hit the magistrate was this one, 
and, according to reports, it entered the left side of his 
chest, and this was what caused his death. [passage omitted]

  [Text] Tegucigalpa, 5 Apr (ACAN-EFE) -- The Honduran Armed 
Forces thwarted an alleged plan which would reportedly be 
executed by three Nicaraguan citizens to assassinate President 
Carlos Roberto Reina. 
  Army Spokesman Colonel Napoleon Santos announced today 
military intelligence learned about the plan after Nicaraguan 
citizens Luis Enrique Quintero, Santiago Rivas, and Roger 
Arguello entered the country on 7 March. 
  According to the high-ranking military officer, who said 
Enrique Quintero was a member of the intelligence department of 
the Sandinist People's Army (EPS), the three Nicaraguan citizens 
had planned to burn a paint factory and kidnap three businessmen.

"Those responsible for kidnapping IBR [Agrarian Reform 
Institute] technicians will be brought to trial to answer for 
their crime. The government will not hesitate to resort to the 
law," He thus referred to peasant leaders who held a group of 
IBR technicians hostage in the settlement of General Resquin on 
7 April [date as published]. [passage omitted] 
  Asked if the situation will interrupt the negotiations 
currently underway between the government and peasants, Podesta 
said: "The peasant leaders siting at the negotiating table with 
the government cannot be held responsible for what other 
peasants do on their own." 
  Asked about the announcement that peasants will again close 
roads, the minister said: "The police will enforce the law. If 
there is a court order we will use force, without doubt." 
  Returning to the issue of the General Resquin "kidnappers," 
Podesta said: "Those responsible have names and we will press 
charges against them, without doubt." [passage omitted]

  [Excerpt] Lima, 4 Apr (EFE) -- At least 10 convicts were 
wounded, some of them seriously, during a knife fight between 
two factions of the Shining Path at the prison in the city of 
Huancayo, in the Central Andes Region. 
  The bloody fight was the outcome of an "ideological debate" 
between one faction which supports Shining Path leader Abimael 
Guzman, who wants to make peace with the government, and another 
faction which rejects the proposal and insists on continuing the 
"popular war" that it declared against Peruvian democracy in 
1980. 
  An officer of the Huamanccacca Prison of Huancayo reported 
that the confrontation began when the dissident group called Red 
Path [Sendero Rojo], which rejects peace, launched a harsh 
verbal attack against Guzman during a Shining Path meeting in 
which the subversive chief's peace proposal was being discussed. 
  Prison personnel and police had to separate the two 
factions, 
the source reported. [background passage omitted]

  [Text] Lima, 3 Apr (EFE) -- Abimael Guzman, founder and 
leader of the Maoist gang Shining Path ( (SL], has gone on an 
indefinite hunger strike in his cell at the Callao Naval Base in 
Lima. Carlos Gamero Quispe, one of the lawyers who are 
defending Guzman, told the Lima newspaper LA NACION that Guzman 
is striking for medical care. 
  In the statement published by LA NACION on 3 April, Gamero 
said: "My defendant is seriously ill, and the military have 
refused permission for two Red Cross International doctors to 
visit him in prison and treat him for the various diseases he 
has." 
  For 10 years now Abimael Guzman has had psoriasis, a skin 
disease that causes patches of skin to be covered by white 
scales. 
  Guzman's health has been deteriorating lately because of an 
inflammation of the throat that prevents him from swallowing 
prison food, Gamero explained. 
  Carlos Rolando and Delia Carrasco, Abimael Guzman's father 
and mother in law who live in Sweden, hired Gamero. The lawyer 
explained that his defendant has decided to go on an indefinite 
hunger strike to protest the decision by the Supreme Court of 
Military Justice not to allow two International Red Cross 
doctors to visit him in prison. 
  "Guzman's psoriasis has worsened lately because of the 
humidity the pervades the premises of the Callao Naval Base, 
which is located on the La Punta peninsula just off Lima. The 
inflammation of Guzman's throat is also due to this humidity," 
Gamero explained. 
  He added: "He is also suffering from the confinement he has 
to endure. All this has made him lose weight, to the point that 
he now looks like a human scarecrow." 
  The Fifth Criminal Court has ruled against the writ of 
amparo 
or plea of "habeas corpus" that Guzman's lawyer filed, asking 
that Guzman be allowed to receive "private medical care." 
  The lawyer said: "Since the rulings prevent my defendant 
from receiving medical treatment, he has decided to go on an 
indefinite hunger strike to the bitter end, and it is obvious 
that whatever the outcome, the government will be to blame." 
  The lawyer explained that he will go to the Supreme Court to 
appeal the ruling that prevents Guzman from receiving medical 
care "so that the highest court can decide on this matter." 
  The 25th Criminal Court of Lima reported on 29 March that 
Guzman was in good health, and that Red Cross International 
doctors visited him regularly in prison. 
  According to current Peruvian criminal laws, people 
sentenced 
to life for high treason, as in Guzman's case, can be visited by 
their relatives only once a month. 
  Abimael Guzman was arrested on 12 September 1992 in a 
housing 
development in Santiago Surco, a Lima neighborhood. Other key 
SL leaders were also arrested on that occasion. 
  On 7 October 1992 a Naval court judge sentenced Abimael 
Guzman to life imprisonment for high treason, for the deaths of 
over 20,000 people during 10 years of terrorist actions, and for 
destroying state property worth more than $28 billion. 
  The Supreme Court of Military Justice upheld the life 
sentence on 15 October 1992.

  [Text] Cairo, 6 Apr (MENA)--Unidentified men diverted a 
Sudanese airliner coming from Khartoum and forced its captain to 
proceed to the Luxor airport, where the airliner has landed. 
  The Boeing 737 airliner with 93 passengers and six crew 
members on board took off from Khartoum en route for 
al-Danaqilah in south Sudan. The hijacker forced the captain to 
fly to Egypt. Defense Minister Field Marshal Husayn Tantawi 
gave permission to the airliner to land at the Luxor airport. 
The hijacker is a Sudanese national and is asking for political 
asylum in Egypt.

  [Text] Luxor, 6 Apr (MENA)--The hijacked Sudanese airliner 
took off from Luxor Airport at 1600 today bound for Sudan. 
  The airliner was hijacked this morning on a domestic flight 
from Khartoum to al-Danaqilah. The Egyptian authorities and 
Armed Forces supplied the plane with fuel before it took off and 
provided food and medical care to its passengers. 
  The passengers appreciated the good hospitality they 
received 
from the Armed Forces and Egyptian officials and said it was 
nothing unusual from the fraternal and generous Egyptian people. 
  The captain of the Sudanese airliner said he would head 
first 
for al-Danaqilah and then proceed to Khartoum, adding that all 
the passengers are well. 
  A Sudanese official earlier announced that the Sudanese 
airliner left Luxor Airport two hours before it actually took 
off.

<F P=106> [Report by Sana' al-Imam from Damascus] </F>
  [Excerpt] [Passage omitted] The Iranian parliamentary 
delegation led by Hojjat ol-Eslam Hasan Ruhani, Iranian deputy 
Majles speaker, held several meetings in Damascus with the 
pro-Iran Iraqi opposition factions, such as al- Da'wah Party and 
the Supreme Assembly of the Islamic Revolution. Ruhani was 
quoted as saying that those who depend on the United States to 
liberate Iraq will be disappointed because the United States 
wants to control Iraq. 
  Ruhani also held talks with the 10 Palestinian factions that 
oppose the Gaza-Jericho accord. He also held talks in Damascus 
with representatives of the Hizballah and the Islamic resistance 
in Lebanon. Following his meeting with those representatives, 
Ruhani stressed the importance of a united Islamic resistance 
stand, reiterating Iran's readiness to continue to support 
Islamic resistance against Israeli schemes. 
  In a statement to Monte Carlo, Palestinian sources denied 
any 
Iranian financial siege on Hizballah and the Islamic Jihad. 
They stressed that the delay in Iranian financial aid in 
October 1993 was caused by a financial crisis in the Bank of 
Iran. This was communicated to them by the Iranian leadership 
in a written letter. The Palestinian sources said this temporary 
delay completely ended by December 1993.

<F P=106> [Report by Netan'el Semrik] </F>
  [Excerpt] Fatah and Hamas [Islamic Resistance Movement] 
have reached an agreement in Hebron. This is reportedly a 
gentlemen's agreement, without any written documentation to 
attest it. According to the understanding reached, Hamas will 
not act against Fatah or against the potential benefits of the 
peace process. Both sides prefer the wording here to be 
intentionally vague. This is how Husayn al-Shaykh, one of the 
prominent Fatah leaders in the West Bank and an adviser to the 
Palestinian peace delegation, defines the situation: 
  [Begin al-Shaykh recording] There is no war between us and 
Hamas; therefore, no agreement is required. I am sure that 
Hamas knows its limits and our red line very well and that in 
the future, it will share power with us. [end recording] 
  The understandings were reached recently, following a series 
of secret meetings between some seven to 10 people from both 
organizations. The gist of the Hebron agreement is that Hamas 
accepts Fatah as the leader in the political process, even if it 
does not agree with it. It should be emphasized that 
'Izz-al-Din al-Qassam, Hamas' military arm, does not recognize 
and is not bound by these understandings. [passage omitted]

  [Text] Ramallah -- Dr. George Habash, secretary general of 
the Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine [PFLP], 
stressed that the Palestinian national struggle entered a new 
political phase after the signing of the Gaza-Jericho accord. 
The most prominent feature of this phase is the diversion of 
part of the Palestinian bourgeoisie from the national program. 
  In an exclusive interview with AL-QUDS, Dr. Habash added: We 
are preparing ourselves and are working on the basis of a 
program of comprehensive opposition to the Madrid-Oslo program 
and its numerous and Islamic parties without ignoring the 
international link, be they international institutions or 
progressive organizations, parties, and forces supportive of our 
rights and struggle. 
  Dr. Habash affirmed that the future struggle will consist of 
two parts: First, continuing the struggle in all forms and with 
all available means. Second, opposing the accord and its 
implementation on the ground with the aim of foiling it. 
[passage omitted] 
  Dr. Habash emphasized that his opposition to the self-rule 
authority will be based on political, popular, and social 
struggle and all possible democratic forms. 
  On whether Arab states, especially Syria, were exerting 
pressure on the 10 factions, Habash said: The current situation 
of the official Arab system and the state of total collapse that 
it has reached, particularly following the second Gulf war, 
constitutes by itself the greatest pressure on us -- as 
rejectionist forces -- to be incorporated into the U.S. orbit. 
This situation, however, does not preclude the existence of 
Arab regimes that reject or oppose the U.S. concept of peace 
despite their limited role and effect. 
  Habash affirmed: Despite differences in views and positions, 
Syria is not exerting any pressure on us. On the contrary, it 
is showing understanding for these positions, which stem from 
the nature and dangers of this accord. 
  Dr. Habash said: For more than a year now the PLO leadership 
has stopped paying the PFLP its allocations from the Palestine 
National Fund. The cause for this is not the financial crisis. 
It preceded the crisis. By doing so, it is using the same 
weapon which Arab and Western countries are using against it. 
  Dr. Habash added: Nationalist allies in Arab regimes provide 
us with periodic aid, which is very modest and does not meet the 
requirements of the struggle.

  [Text] We have received the following letter from 'Abd-al- 
Rahim Malluh, member of the Political Bureau of the Popular 
Front for the Liberation of Palestine [PFLP], reacting to a news 
report published under the headline "Weapons Seized in Habash's 
Car." The text of the letter follows: 
  Mr. Ra'id Salihah, Editor of AL-BILAD newspaper, 
  Greetings: 
  Issue Number 61, dated 9 March, 1994, of AL-BILAD published 
the following in the center of the front page, under the 
headline "Weapons Seized in Habash's Car:" 
  "The Jordanian version says that during Habash's recent 
visit 
to Jordan, his car was searched and found to contain 
miscellaneous weapons and silencers. Meanwhile, security 
agencies have begun stepping up surveillance at Jordan's border 
points to thwart any gun-smuggling attempts, especially after 
the two movie theater bombings." [see item JN0803210694 in 15 
March Terrorism Report] 
  This report carried by your newspaper is baseless and only 
seeks to discredit comrade Secretary General George Habash. 
  Such rumors are calculated to harm Palestinian-Jordanian 
relations and to resurrect the events of the past [the 
September, 1970 clashes that pitted Palestinian guerrillas 
against the Jordanian military]. [passage omitted] 
  The charge that George Habash sought to smuggle weapons is 
absolutely baseless, and state agencies in Jordan can confirm 
this. 
  Dr. Habash is a sufficiently credible and self-respecting 
person not to abuse the special privileges offered him by the 
state authorities during his visits to compromise the country's 
security and stability. 
  We cannot make sense out of the connection you made between 
the fabricated report and the movie theater bombings and the 
subsequent measures taken by the Jordanian authorities unless 
the aim is to discredit the PFLP, and George Habash in 
particular, and the factions of the Palestinian revolution in 
general. 
  We have consistently come out against any actions designed 
to 
undermine Jordan's security, including the barbaric bombings of 
the movie houses. 
  For the record, on his last visit here on 23 February, 1994, 
Dr. Habash was not subjected to any searches at the border, and 
was treated with all the respect due a national patriot.

  [Excerpt] [passage omitted] A senior Fatah official was 
kidnapped by Hamas [Islamic Resistance Movement] activists in 
Gaza city over the weekend. Hamas claims that the man was 
collaborating with the Israeli authorities. Palestinian sources 
told our correspondent Moti Amir that the real reason behind the 
kidnapping was a dispute over land in Rafah. In the course of 
the kidnapping a violent fight broke out; one Hamas activist was 
killed and 30 were injured. The sources stressed that because 
of the continuing clashes with Hamas, Fatah was making efforts 
to capture influential positions and seize control of land and 
installations before Hamas does. 
  Our army affairs correspondent has learned that two wanted 
Hamas activists turned themselves in to the IDF over the past 
few weeks. IDF commanders in the Gaza Strip are continuing to 
hold contacts and meetings with Hamas members in an effort to 
persuade them to halt terrorist activity. Military sources said 
that the Hamas activists have a great deal of motivation to 
carry out terrorist attacks and they are expected to increase 
their efforts over the next few days.

<F P=106> [Interview of Palestinian officials Ilyas Frayj, Muhammad </F>
al-Nazal, Ghassan al-Khatib, Muhammad Ghunaym, Dawud al-Tilhami, 
Dr. 'Awwad M. 'Awwad, Dr. Fathi al-Shaqaqi, Zuhayr al-Rayyis, 
Wahid al-Hamdulillah, and 'Azmi al-Shu'aybi; place and date not 
given; by 'Ali Salih: "Arms Phenomenon in Occupied Territories 
Greatly Blown Out of Proportion"] 
  [Excerpts] Even if the spread of weapons in the occupied 
territories, specifically in Gaza and Jericho, is not as great 
as newspaper reports claim, it has become a phenomenon that 
demands attention, study, and debate, as well as treatment. 
[passage omitted] 
  In order to shed some light on this phenomenon, AL-SHARQ 
AL-AWSAT asked Palestinian officials from six major Palestinian 
factions and parties, plus some independent figures, a number of 
questions about the extent of the spread of arms, the reasons, 
motives, consequences, the sources of the arms, and the role of 
the Palestinian police in containing them. 
  What follows are the replies AL-SHARQ AL-AWSAT received from 
Muhammad Ghunaym (Abu-Mahir), mobilization and organization 
officer and Fatah Central Committee member in Tunis; Hamas's 
Amman representative, Muhammad al-Nazal; Dawud al-Tilhami, 
member of the politburo of the Democratic Front for the 
Liberation of Palestine in Damascus; Ghassan al-Khatib, a senior 
official in the People's Party in Jerusalem; 'Azmi al-Shu'aybi, 
member of the politburo of the Democratic Palestinian Union 
(DPU) in Jerusalem; Dr. Fathi al-Shaqaqi, secretary general of 
the Islamic Jihad Movement in Damascus; Dr. 'Awwad Muhammad 
'Awwad, a doctor by profession and well-known national figure, 
from Tulkarm; Bethlehem Mayor Ilyas Frayj (Independent); Wahid 
al-Hamdulillah, a well-known independent national figure, and a 
member of the Board of Regents of al-Najah University in Nablus; 
and Zuhayr al-Rayyis, a writer, journalist, nationally known 
figure, and prominent personality in the Gaza Strip. 
  Salih: How widespread are weapons in the occupied 
territories? Is it as great as the newspapers say? 
  Abu Mahir (Fatah): There are an estimated 
10-15,000 weapons--and that could rise--mostly in the Gaza 
Strip. [passage omitted] 
  Al-Khatib (People's Party): There is a widespread, 
large-scale spread of arms, particularly in the Gaza Strip, and 
in the occupied territories as a whole. It is not only a problem 
of the extent of the spread, but of the lack of any control over 
who is stockpiling these arms. Of course, some political 
organizations obtain arms, but there are also other groups and 
individuals that get them if they can afford them. [passage 
omitted] 
  Al-Shu'aybi (DPU): The spread of arms is relative 
to how it was in the past. What is remarkable is the 
transformation in this phenomenon now, to a virtually public 
one, especially in the Gaza Strip. One cannot speak of this type 
of phenomenon existing in the West Bank. But there is a 
noticeable increase in the buying and selling of arms, and a 
boldness in carrying them. 
  Al-Shaqaqi (Islamic Jihad): The spread of arms is 
aimed at the Gaza Strip and to a lesser extent the city of 
Nablus in the West Bank. This is not new, nor is it on the scale 
alleged by newspaper reports. What is new is the openness with 
which people are bearing arms, especially Fatah members. This 
comes after the Oslo accord, whereby the authorities no longer 
hold Fatah people responsible specifically for bearing arms. 
Some families historically known for owning arms, for trading in 
them, or other purposes, are no longer afraid to display them. 
Most of them are small, light arms; and, by our estimate, do not 
exceed the volume of the arms in the hands of all the factions 
and families, by more than a few hundred weapons. 
  Dr. 'Awwad (Independent): There are several 
reasons why arms are more widespread in the Gaza Strip than in 
the West Bank, but there are no precise estimates about this. 
Regarding the spread of arms in Gaza in particular, it is now 
said jokingly that arms are sold by the bushel, like fruits and 
vegetables in Gaza. But the truth is that there is a noticeable 
rise in armament, with hundreds of guns like Kalashnikovs, Uzis, 
and pistols reaching Gaza. [passage omitted] 
  Salih: The causes and motives behind the spread of 
arms--do the factions have a hand in this? 
  Abu Mahir: There are many and varied reasons for 
this phenomenon, which I would summarize as follows: 
  First: the occupation, and its continued presence during the 
transitional period, and our people's belief that there will be 
no withdrawal unless the enemy is forced out, by force of arms. 
Second: the sense of a need for protection from settler attacks 
and their crimes, which now occur under the very noses of the 
occupation soldiers. Third: the attacks of armed gangs on people 
and property, and crimes committed by people claiming to belong 
to Palestinian factions. Fourth: the spread of rumors about 
interfactional fighting once the transitional period begins. 
[passage omitted] 
  Al-Khatib: There are a number of reasons for the 
spread of arms. First, their availibility from Israeli sources, 
through the black market, and the underworld (gangs) in Israel. 
Second, citizens' feelings of insecurity and unease. Third, the 
uncertain future. Fourth, the existence of rivalry, at times, 
among political factions. Fifth, Israel's reduction of 
monitoring and punishment of people transporting arms or 
possessing them, especially in Gaza. Al-Tilhami: 
Naturally, a large number of intifadah fighters had arms, 
especially in the last three years. This was a distinct 
increase, to confront the occupation. In recent months, 
especially after the Oslo accord, there have been more guns in 
Gaza, both smuggled in from Sinai or bought from arms dealing 
networks in the occupied territories. Of course, in light of the 
mounting chaos in Gaza, it was natural for organized Palestinian 
forces to provide the arms necessary for self-defense against 
occupation attacks, settler operations, or occupation agents. We 
do not rule out that the Israelis, using their access to 
arms-dealing networks, might be trying to turn political 
disputes among the factions into armed clashes. This is 
something we seriously and firmly warn against. 
  Al-Shu'aybi: Historically, the national movement 
has sought to obtain arms to use them in militant operations. 
They used to smuggle the arms in. In recent years, faced with 
the difficulty of smuggling, they have resorted to obtaining 
arms from Israeli dealers in the underworld. They get arms 
stolen from Israeli camps. [passage omitted] 
  Al-Hamdulillah: We in the occupied territories 
accuse the occupation authorities and their intelligence service 
of playing a secret and dangerous role in the spread of this 
phenomenon. These authorities have recently begun to arm their 
collaborators more openly, and on a wider scale, to defend 
themselves, instead of moving them behind the so-called Green 
Line [pre-1967 border]. [passage omitted] 
  Al-Rayyis: The diverse factions have their own 
reasons and motives that [passage incomplete] 
  Salih: What are the sources of these arms? 
  Abu Mahir: Recently, most arms have come from 
southern Lebanon via arms dealers, and through collusion with 
occupation officers. 
  Al-Nazal: There are numerous sources for obtaining 
arms. It varies from faction to faction. Hamas's principal 
source of arms is the occupation soldiers killed by al-Qassam 
heroes, who take their guns. 
  Al-Khatib: Israel is encouraging this phenomenon. 
  Al-Tilhami: As I mentioned previously, most of 
these arms come from arms dealers and even the occupation 
soldiers, some of whom sell arms for material gain. There is a 
certain quantity of arms smuggled in from Sinai. [passage omitted 
  Al-Shaqaqi: We believe that the phenomenon is a 
limited one. It is not as newspaper reports portray it. The 
supply is meager, and the high prices are staggering. The cost 
of a gun, since the signing of the Oslo Accord, has not gone 
down one cent. The price of a revolver is the equivalent of 
$3,000. A Kalashnikov is $7,000, and a U.S.-made M-16 is at 
least $10,000. The sources of the guns are as follows: 
  1. The theft of Israeli-owned cars, especially in the 
territories occupied since 1948; most of these cars have guns 
inside. 
  2. Arms smuggling over the Egyptian border. 
  3. Drug dealers who trade drugs to Israeli soldiers in 
exchange for their guns, which are then sold. 
  4. Some bedouin in Beersheba have family connections in Gaza 
and bring arms to their relatives. 
  5. Arms stolen from Israeli army stockpiles or settlements. 
  6. Arms stored since 1967, which are reappearing now. These 
are Egyptian guns whose owners want to sell them and profit from 
high prices before it is too late and they lose their value. 
  Dr. 'Awwad: There are a number of sources. There 
are Israeli arms dealers, well known to the Israeli authorities. 
There are arms stockpiles collected over the long years for use 
at the proper time, which for some has now arrived. And there 
are arms smuggled over the Egyptian border. 
  Frayj: If the reports are true, the people fueling 
this phenomenon are the enemies of the Palestinian people. 
  Al-Hamdulillah: In my view, the sources are 
restricted to the following: the remainder of the arms left 
behind by the Arab armies in the 1967 war; guns smuggled over 
the borders of Egypt, Syria, Lebanon, and Jordan; and Israeli 
sources, including the arming of collaborators. [passage omitted] 
  Abu Mahir: Apart from the motives of those who 
promote guns, or facilitate their supply to citizens, these arms 
are patriotic and Palestinian when possessed by our people. They 
will eventually be used against the soldiers of the occupation 
and the settlers. [passage omitted] 
  Al-Tilhami: We are afraid, after reading the 
provisions of the Oslo and Cairo accords, that the so-called 
Palestinian police will be entrusted with the mission of 
repressing the intifadah and the people. [passage omitted] So we 
will work with all opposition patriotic and Islamic forces, 
groups, and persons, including members of Fatah and the 
Palestine People's Party who oppose the Cairo accord, in order 
to reject this mission entrusted to the so-called Palestinian 
police. We reject the transformation of this body into an 
instrument of oppression against the people, to serve a plan to 
repress the intifadah and provide security for the occupation, 
instad of eradicating it. [passage omitted]

  [Text] The Algerian Islamic Salvation Front [FIS] has its 
rearguard in France. The police have uncovered a rear-guard 
logistics network for the Algerian murderers. On 21 and 22 
March, police arrested two FIS sympathizers in Lille, and 
discovered a large cache of false identity papers and other 
documents. A routine drug search led detectives to this 
important terrorist network. Eric Young has the details: 
  [Young] For the first time, a police investigation appears 
to 
prove the existence of links between FIS sympathizers and the 
drug world. The network first came to light with a routine 
police investigation of a drug trafficking network. Detectives 
from the Lille police force spent several days tracking two 
suspects called Shahib and Ahmed. One is Algerian, the other 
French. On 21 March, they were arrested, and it was only during 
their first search that detectives realized they were dealing 
with something bigger. They found more than 1,000 false 
administrative papers at the home of one of the men, including 
500 blank Algerian identity cards. Enlisting the help of their 
Parisian colleagues, the Lille police then carried out a second 
search, this time in Persan-Beaumont in the Val d'Oise, at the 
home of Ahmed. Their haul was enormous. They found documents 
in Arabic linked to the FIS, perfect imitations of Algerian 
official stamps, several handguns, an assault rifle, and a 
significant amount of ammunition. They also found a list of 
telephone numbers, several of which corresponded to people on 
file for drug trafficking. A third man was thus arrested, a 
certain Hassan. 
  It therefore seems clear that the FIS has set up a network 
of 
dealers in France to finance its movement and its actions. The 
sixth division of the criminal investigation department, 
responsible for the repression of threats to state security and 
of subversive activities, has been given the task of 
investigating the affair, under the direction of Judge 
Jean-Louis Bruguiere. It remains to be seen how important this 
network is and to prove how exactly it is passing on its support 
to the clandestine movement in Algeria.

<F P=106> [Benoit Charpentier report: "France Is Supply Base for </F>
Islamic Salvation Front"] 
  [Text] With caution made obligatory by the Kraouche 
syndrome, police officers are continuing their investigations 
into the branches of the FIS [Islamic Salvation Front] in 
France. Careful to avoid any shows of triumph, they recently 
arrested two suspected sympathizers of the Islamic Salvation 
Front in Lille. 
  At Place Beauvau, as in the 14th Antiterrorist Brigade of 
the 
Paris public prosecutor's office, the affair is considered to be 
"important." Chaib E., an Algerian national, and Ahmed S., a 27 
year-old Frenchman, were imprisoned by Judge Bruguiere for 
"criminal involvement in terrorist action." 
  In the course of a drugs investigation, police officers of 
the Lille regional Crime Squad seized over 1,000 blank Algerian 
administrative documents and a number of weapons. 
  Drugs, the FIS, and false papers -- this increasingly common 
cocktail sheds light on both the way in which the fundamentalist 
movement is set up in France and the way in which drugs have 
become a scourge of the Lille region in such a short period of 
time. Its closeness to Amsterdam is a principal reason. 
<H5>  Heroin and Illegal Immigrants </H5>
  In the opinion of one judge, "the Lille metropolitan region 
is an ideal hub for drugs traffickers." Last December, 
investigators dismantled a major network of heroin dealers, 
implicating 47 people, most of them illegal immigrants. They 
had already been working for several weeks on a new heroin line 
when they were taken in for questioning on 21 and 22 March. 
Chaib and Ahmed were ringleaders of a flourishing network that 
offloaded at least 1 kg of heroin every 10 days and which has 
since led to the questioning of 25 people, most of whom have 
been placed under a committal order. This large- scale 
operation had several surprises in store. 
  During the raid on Chaib's home, Crime Squad officers 
dicovered 500 blank Algerian identity cards and 600 blank 
attestations from the High Commission of Algerian national 
service. On the same day they arrested Ahmed, and in a raid on 
his home in Persan-en-Beaumont in Val-d'Oise [Paris region], 
they found an Israeli-made Galil assault rifle, handguns, 
primers and boxes of cartridges for 9-mm automatic weapons, 
stamps for manufacturing false documents, a batch of Algerian 
adminstrative documents, and documents written in Arabic. The 
latter are now being examined by Judge Bruguiere after having 
been passed on to the 6th Division of the Central Crime Squad by 
the Interior Ministry in Paris. 
  These papers immediately attracted the attention of 
antiterrorist experts in the capital. 
  They allegedly prove that the two traffickers are members of 
the FIS. A senior government official in Paris stated: "The 
FIS does not issue membership cards." 
  Their fingers burnt for reasons that are only too-well 
known, 
the police prefer to ironically talk of suspected sympathizers. 
Chaib and Ahmed are, however, thought to belong to the French 
Algerian Fraternity [FAF], one of the FIS' subgroupings which 
was jointly led by Djaffar El Houari and Moussa Kraouche, who 
was also its spokesman. The Lille region appears to be a happy 
hunting-ground for the Islamic fundemntalists. As a judge 
remarked: "It opens directly onto Belgium and the Netherlands." 
Fundamentalism has developed considerably among the region's 
60,000 Muslims, most of whom live in the Roubaix-Tourcoing zone. 
This area has a number of makeshift places of worship as well 
as eight real mosques, some of which regularly welcome over 
1,000 worshippers. The Koran schools are overflowing, and the 
Chador is increasingly worn by adolescents. 
  Already on several occasions, police officials have swooped 
on this fertile FIS area. Eight people were taken in for 
questioning during the national haul of last November, while on 
1 March, accused of the same "criminal involvement in terrorist 
action," eight more suspects appeared in Lille before an 
Investigation Commission led by Parisian Judge Roger Le Loire. 
All to no avail. 
<H5>  `Afghans' </H5>
  Magistrates and the police now almost dare to hope that, 
with 
the arrest of Chaib and Ahmed, they will finally be able to 
unravel the threads of a web that seems to be getting more and 
more complex as the months go by. 
  The Kraouche affair proved that there is very little 
evidence 
to catch supposed members of the FIS red-handed. A judge who 
knows these cases well said: "We cannot talk of a centralized 
organization. There are almost as many FIS and Armed Islamic 
Group [GIA] cells as there are regions, even if most 
fundamentalists are to be found in the Paris region, Orleans, 
and, now, Lille." Neither the FIS nor the GIA present a united 
front. 
  Leading the way in terrorist action in Algeria, the GIA 
claimed responsibility for the murder of two French surveyors on 
21 September in Sidi Bel Abbes, and the taking hostage of three 
other French citizens. Its most fanatical members -- which 
inlcude the "Afghans," Algerian Islamic fundamentalists who 
fought in Afghanistan -- cannot even be controlled by the 
fundamentalist leaders. These fanatics even planned the 
assassination of Rabah Khebir, the FIS spokesman exiled in 
Germany. 
  Judge Bruguiere's investigation will attempt to find out 
whether Chaib and Ahmed played an active organizational role. 
An analysis of the weapons seized should reveal whether they 
were used in France in hold-ups or to settle scores, or even if 
they have been used in Algeria -- unless, of course, the two 
suspects turn out to be mere pawns. A Parisian official in the 
antiterrorist squad told us: "Many people orbit the FIS, going 
about their own business, drugs or something else, but helping 
the fundamentalists out with gifts or false documents. Unlike 
the Kurdish Workers' Party [PKK], we cannot formally say that 
the FIS is financed by drugs in France, unless it is indirectly." 
<H5>  Algerians Seeking Asylum </H5>
  In 1993, France recorded a rise in the number of asylum 
seekers from Algeria and Egypt, according to the latest figures 
from the Office for the Protection of Refugees and Stateless 
Persons (OFPRA). According to the OFPRA, the rise in the number 
of requests by Algerian nationals (1,098 in 1993, as opposed to 
144 in 1990) "is probably due to the arrival of people fleeing 
local instability and persecution by the FIS." However, "as is 
the case for Egyptian requests (up 249 percent)," the rise in 
requests could also be "linked to the reinstitution" of economic 
emigration channels.

  [Excerpts] Algiers, April 6 (AFP) -- A prominent Algerian 
businessman and opposition party leader, Mehdi Abbas Allalou, 
was badly injured in an attack in an Algiers suburb Wednesday, 
security officials said. 
  Allalou, leader of the small Popular Association for Unity 
and Action (APUA) movement, was rushed to hospital after the 
attack in the southeastern El Harrach district. Officials gave 
no details of the circumstances. [background passage omitted] 
  The businessman, known for his close ties to the Gulf 
countries and Saudi Arabia, took a stance in favour of Kuwait 
when it was invaded by Iraq in 1991.

  [Text] The security forces have announced the killing of 18 
members of armed groups, including two gunmen who might have 
carried out the assassination attempt on the leader of the 
Popular Association for Unity and Action. Over to Hamza Wahib 
for more details: 
  [Wahib] The security forces have announced that, following 
this morning's attempted assassination of Abbas Allalou, the 
leader of the Popular Association for Unity and Action, in El 
Kouthbane district in Mohammedia, they killed two gunmen who 
were driving a car at a place called Gatfi, on the highway east 
of Algiers. This happened at a roadblock erected by the 
security forces immediately after the assassination attempt. 
  The security forces have also stated that they recovered two 
automatic weapons and that an investigation is under way to 
establish whether these weapons were used in the attempted 
assassination of Abbas Allalou. Earlier reports released by the 
security forces said that the assassination attempt was carried 
out by two gunmen. 
  Moreover, the security forces have announced the killing of 
16 members of armed groups and the arrest of 43 other persons in 
the past two days. The same source added that the operations 
took place in Boumerdes, Blida, Tipaza, Jijel, Batna, and 
Algiers provinces. The security forces also announced the 
recovery of several weapons, including five automatic handguns, 
two shotguns, one sawn-off shotgun, one MAT-49 submachine gun, 
and also some Kalashnikov guns [as heard].

<F P=106> [By Jamal Khashuqji from Jeddah; Algerian names as published] </F>
  [Excerpt] The dissolved Algerian group of the Islamic 
Salvation Front [FIS] has asserted that it has not pledged to 
halt violence. 
  In a statement to AL-HAYAH, Rabeh Kebir, chairman of the FIS 
Executive Committee operating abroad, has said, in the first 
press statement since the German authorities ordered him to halt 
his political activities, that FIS leaders have not made any 
commitments to President Lamine Zeroual to halt "armed action." 
He added that FIS leaders have made any decision in this regard 
contingent upon consultations with free FIS leaders. 
  The FIS reaction came less than 24 hours after the Algerian 
Presidential Office announced that Major General Zeroual had 
held personal contacts with the jailed FIS leaders, who asked 
Sheiks Ali Jedi and Abd el Qader Bou Khamkham to work to halt 
acts of violence. 
  In a related development, informed Algerian sources informed 
AL- HAYAH that the Algerian Army continues to "initiate" battles 
with armed group members, and that it is waging "a calculated" 
war against them. The Army's withdrawal from a certain area, 
the sources continued, does not mean that it is incapable of 
confronting these groups. Any military move hinges upon a 
full-blown and calculated plan, the sources maintained. 
  The sources declined to delve into military details. 
Nonetheless, they underscored the Army's cohesion, unity, and 
ability to keep things under control. They noted that the Army 
is currently engaged in large-scale pursuit operations against 
gunmen. [passage omitted]

<F P=106> [Article by A. Hayane: "The Former FIS (Islamic Salvation </F>
Front) 
in Germany: Close to 200 Militants"--first paragraph is EL WATAN 
introduction] 
  [Excerpts] [passage omitted] All Islamist organizations in 
the world have a pied-a-terre in the Federal Republic of 
Germany. In fact, this country has long been a favored meeting 
ground for these organizations, to hold their conventions, 
seminars, and conferences. Due to their very "official" nature, 
these activities are widely tolerated by German authorities. 
[passage omitted] 
  Turkish and Iranian extra-Islamist ties in Germany--which 
remains one of the main destinations of the ayatollahs' agents 
in Europe-- are also very strong within the Turkish community, 
by far the most imposing and one of the oldest in the country; 
numerous and very- well-organized fundamentalist networks were 
created already a long time ago. 
  As a rule, they are the ones who provide financial and 
material support to their Algerian "brothers," members of the 
former FIS [Islamic Salvation Front], who reach Germany through 
France or Italy. 
  Since the state of emergency was declared in Algeria in 
February 1992, close to 9,000 Algerians are said to have applied 
for "political asylum" with German authorities. Some are genuine 
militants of Abassi's party; most of the others are just young 
black-market traffickers or illegal aliens taking advantage of 
the Bonn government's generosity toward militants of the 
Islamist party to try and settle in the country. Many succeed 
with various degrees of luck, with the complicity of some very 
lenient officials. 
  Actually, Germany is said to number now close to 200 
Algerian Islamist fundamentalists who are genuine activists, and 
therefore dangerous. As these militants of the banned FIS settle 
and travel, they seem to favor the area extending from 
Alsace-Lorraine (France) to Belgium and Germany. They settle, 
among other places, in the towns of Neunled, Kaiserlautern, 
Stuttgart, and Mannheim. 
  Rabah Kebir, who was just forbidden by German authorities 
to engage in any subversive political activities or statements 
against Algeria, lives in Soest, near Dortmund. There, he was 
allowed full latitude to engage in subversive activities until 
he was called to order.

<F P=106> [Exclusive interview by Peter Lennon with Leader of Egypt's </F>
Islamic Fundamentalists, Shaykh Muhammad al-Ghazali, date and 
place not given] 
  [Excerpts] [passage omitted] A figure, relatively unknown 
in the West, is now emerging in Egypt in the Islamic challenge 
to President Husni Mubarak. He is 77-year-old Sheykh Muhammad 
al-Ghazali, a former mosque manager and professional Islamic 
proselytiser. Over the years he has worked in Iran, Kuwait and 
Algeria spreading the message of Islam. He received Saudi 
Arabia's FaIsal Prize for Services to Islam in 1989 and a state 
award from Pakistan in 1990. 
  Sheykh al-Ghazali achieved international notoriety last June 
when he appeared for the defence in the case of the two alleged 
assassins of the author Dr Faraj Foudah. Dr Foudah had been 
murdered by Islamic extremists after his work had been branded 
apostate. At the trial, al-Ghazali had declared that it was the 
duty of the government to carry out the death penalty on 
apostates; if it failed to do so, he made plain, he understood 
why others should feel entitled to carry out the sentence. 
  In his first interview with the foreign press in many years, 
al- Ghazali raised the stakes an unhealthy notch by declaring it 
might become his duty to "mobilise the people and overthrow the 
government." [passage omitted] 
  Al-Ghazali was accompanied by two watchful sons who 
monitored 
the translation. He is small of stature, with a rather cross 
expression but very courteous and candid. There is a certain 
heated intensity of manner when defending his faith and 
castigating the corruption of the West. He claimed to have been 
able to muster 300,000 faithful for his last oration. Even a 
third of this figure would be an intimidating congregation to 
make any president think. [passage omitted] 
  He had made it known through my interpreter that he would 
answer any question, so I brought up his public defence of the 
alleged assassins of Dr Foudah. "We find it very hard to 
understand," I said, "how a scholarly and cultivated person 
could be seen to be inciting ignorant people to take the law 
into their own hands." 
  Al-Ghazali denied he had incited anyone to kill. Indeed, he 
had declared in court that "if everyone did that there would be 
chaos." But in decribing what had happened in court he made his 
attitude towards apostates very clear. "I was not in court to 
issue fatwas," he said, "but as a witness. Faraj Foudah had 
denied the Rule of Islam to me personally in open debate at the 
Cairo book fair two years ago. Now a man is free to believe 
that if he wants to; he can go and sit at home and say it. But 
this man went out into the streets and worked against the Rule 
of Islam. This is unacceptable because it strengthens Zionism 
and colonialism and I am against anything that strengthens 
these." [passage omitted] 
  What, I asked, would be his attitude to an Egyptian 
government which failed to carry out its duties towards Islam? 
"If it does not do so it is up to me to mobilise people to 
overthrow the government." 
  Was this an eventuality which he felt might arrive in the 
near future? al-Ghazali laughed and said: "Why overthrow a 
government when you can organise elections and do it through the 
ballot box?" But were there free elections in Egypt? "You 
should be asking that question of the people who rig the ballot 
boxes." 
  Al-Ghazali is technically an employee of the government in 
his role of member of the influential Islamic Research Council. 
[passage omitted] 
  The government would have particular reason to be wary of 
al- 
Ghazali. A few months ago the Algerian government accused him 
of having been instrumental in setting up the resistance 
movement FIS (Islamic Salvation Front) during the years he spent 
in Algeria. al- Ghazali had said that in Egypt the state feared 
the label "Islam" because it was afraid of alienating the West. 
[passage omitted] 
  "I want my religion to be strong, Because I want my nation 
to 
be strong, to be able to defend itself. We are militarily 
defeated, we are a defeated nation and the only way we can 
regain our strength and self-respect is through religion."

  [Text] Cairo, 4 Apr (MENA)-- A security official has stated 
that the three terrorists killed earlier today on al-Ma'abidah 
Island in Asyut were all leading cadres in the military wing of 
the terrorist organization in Asyut. 
  The first terrorist, Sahsuh Muhammad Muhanna, a former 
employee in the Modern Clothing Company in Dayrut and a member 
of the organization's military wing, took part in many acts of 
violence in the past two years. A forged identification card 
bearing the name Karam Maurice was found on him. 
  The second terrorist, Muhammad Nadi 'Abd-al-'Al Darwish, is 
identified as a leading cadre in the military wing of the same 
organization. He is listed as a suspect in the assassination of 
noncommissioned officer Sayyid Qurani Hasan, two conscripts in 
the Dayrut railway station police, and two secret policemen from 
the Dayrut Supply Detectives Department. 
  The third terrorist, Khalid Muhammad Quraysh, is listed as a 
suspect in the assassination of noncommissioned officer Hilal 
Marzuq; Quraysh carried out the assassination personally. He 
took part in many acts of violence in various areas in Asyut. 
  The official noted that the weapons found with the 
terrorists 
included an automatic rifle, a Hulwan pistol bearing a police 
logo, and a 1.5 kg explosive charge of the same type seized from 
terrorist elements arrested on 30 March. 
  The prosecution has been notified to launch an 
investigation.

  [Text] Asyut, Upper Egypt, 4 Apr (MENA)--Three terrorists 
were killed today in a clash with security forces and citizens 
in Asyut. The clash took place on the al-Ma'abidah Island in 
Markaz Manfalut, Asyut Governorate. 
  Several citizens clashed with three people, strangers to the 
island, who had weapons hidden under their clothes. When the 
three noticed that the citizens were in pursuit, they opened 
fire on them. A crowd gathered and chased them, preventing their 
escape. One of the three terrorists was wounded [as received] 
in an exchange of fire with citizens carrying licensed weapons. 
The citizens apprehended the other two terrorists to hand them 
over to the security forces who arrived on the island. When the 
two realized the security forces were approaching, they tried to 
escape, prompting the policemen to shoot them. They died 
instantly. The terrorists were found in possession of an 
automatic rifle and a pistol. The pistol belonged to a 
noncommissioned police officer who was assassinated last year. 
The Manfalut prosecutor started an investigation into the 
incident.

  [Text] Cairo, 3 Apr (MENA)--Ibrahim al-Baradi'i, an AKHBAR 
AL- YAWM correspondent in Qalyub, was killed today after having 
been hit by a stray bullet. A responsible security source said 
that the reporter was sitting with three friends in a cafe in 
Qalyub, 20 km north of Cairo. As the four people left the cafe 
the reporter felt a pain in his neck and was bleeding. He was 
taken to Qalyub General Hospital where he died. A bullet was 
found lodged in his neck. The security source said that the 
victim's three friends affirmed that they did not hear any sound 
of gunfire, so it is likely that the stray bullet was fired from 
a long distance. The security agencies are continuing their 
investigations to determine the details of the incident.

<F P=106> [Interview with Coptic Pope Shanudah by 'Abdallah </F>
al-Sinnawi; place and date not given] 
  [Excerpts] [Al-Sinnawi] What were the motives of the attack 
on the al-Muharraq Monastery? [see 22 March Terrorism Report for 
report of incident] According to your information, was it an 
isolated incident or was it premeditated? 
  Shanudah: I do not know the motives of those 
people; they are in their minds and hearts, and I cannot express 
them. But the incident apparently took place as follows: Some 
monks were seeing off guests to a microbus outside. The 
monastery's door was opened. A terrorist happened to be passing 
by in his car. The door was open, the man had a machine gun in 
his hand, and the chance was there. He fired his bullets and 
killed two monks and some guests. It was merely an opportunity 
that he found too good to miss. 
  Al-Sinnawi: Do you believe that the attack was not 
planned? 
  Shanudah: I believe that it was not planned or 
premeditated. No one knew that the monastery's door would be 
open at that particular time and that some monks would be out 
seeing some guests off. It was merely a chance incident. 
[passage omitted] 
  Al-Sinnawi: When was the last time a monastery was 
attacked? 
  Shanudah: This is the first time in the modern 
age. The whole thing means that the attacker had no feelings of 
love and was far from right. What was the sin of some monks or 
monastery guests? Monks are virtuous, humble worshipers who have 
nothing to do with any disputes or rivalries. Why should they 
be attacked? But do not forget that the al-Muharraq Monastery 
is located in Asyut, which is raging with violence. 
  Al-Sinnawi: Some people say monasteries and 
churches are storing weapons for the decisive time. 
  Shanudah: What is the decisive time? 
  Al-Sinnawi: When the prestige of the state is 
about to fall and the groups of political Islam come close to 
governing. 
  Shanudah: No. The state's prestige cannot be 
lost. Anyway, this is a rumor that has been proved false and 
that we have repeatedly denied. If some people are exaggerating 
things to the point where they say without thinking that the 
monasteries contain weapons arsenals, then my response to them 
is clear: 
  First, our monasteries and churches are open to anyone, 
including non-Christians. Our Muslim brothers frequently visit 
these places for social and national functions. I say it once 
more: You have carte blanche, go see for yourselves whether 
there are weapons. [passage omitted] 
  Al-Sinnawi: After the al-Ibrahimi Mosque 
massacre, the al- Azhar shaykh called for liberating Jerusalem. 
He said that this is the duty of every Muslim. Is there a 
possibility of coordinating stances with the office of al-Azhar 
shaykh on this issue? 
  Shanudah: Yes. We call on him to discuss with us 
the practical stances for liberating Jerusalem and retrieving 
our Islamic and Christian holy shrines. [passage omitted]

<F P=106> [Unattributed article: "Private Sector Weapons Factory in </F>
Sawhaj; Extremists Steadily Obtain the Products To Commit 
Terrorist Operations"] 
  [Excerpt] Security forces have uncovered a factory, owned 
by a citizen, which manufactures weapons and ammunition in the 
town of Salamun, Tima district of the Sawhaj governorate. 
  The factory owner, Zaydan al-Sayyid Mutawalli, who was 
arrested in his town, acknowledged during his questioning that 
extremists make piecemeal purchases of the factory's ammunition, 
machine guns, and handguns and use them to conduct terrorist 
operations against the police and, in other cases, tourist 
steamboats. Security forces arrested five terrorists who 
admitted that they were partners of the three who had been 
arrested on one of the public buses in the city of Asyut while 
traveling from Sawhaj to Cairo to bomb some movie theaters. 
  An official security source said that the five terrorists 
were preparing to travel to the capital and that an amount of 
explosives and documents identifying as bomb sites the cinema 
houses that are showing the movie "The Terrorist" were 
confiscated. 
  The source added that the police are tightening security on 
all movie theaters to prevent their being targetted for any 
attack by terrorists. [passage omitted]

<F P=106> [Excerpt] Vellore, Feb. 6--The Tamil Nadu Congress </F>
Committee(I) president, Mr Vazhapadi K. Ramamurthi, said here 
today that he had 'reliable' information to the effect that the 
LTTE [Liberation Tigers of Tamil Elam] was printing fake Indian 
currency notes within Tamil Nadu and that it had restarted the 
manufacture of weapons within the State. 
  He told reporters that he had already passed on the 
information the Central Intelligence Agencies and to the Prime 
Minister. The LTTE, he said, was no longer interested in the 
creation of a separate homeland but was mainly concerned with 
amassing wealth. It was also helping Pakistan in terrorist 
activities. 
  Mr. Ramamurthi accused the Tamil Nadu Chief Minister, Ms. 
Jayalalitha, of having compromised with the LTTE. "She is not as 
effective now as she was in checking LTTE activities when she 
came to power. Twenty-seven LTTE cadre who had sneaked into 
Tamil Nadu through Tuticorin to sabotage the Republic Day 
celebrations in Madras were now at large. This information too 
had been passed on to the intelligence agencies. The police 
could not do anything to check or stop the LTTE activities." 
  He said the Chief Minister's 'compromise' was a valid ground 
for the Centre invoking Article 356 of the Constitution to 
dismiss her Government. [passage omitted]

  [Text] Nicosia, April 5 (AFP) -- Gunmen shot and seriously 
wounded a Danish UN guard in an ambush Tuesday in 
Kurdish-controlled northern Iraq, security officials in the area 
said. 
  The guard was shot in the chest as he was driving from al- 
Sulaymaniyah to Irbil, and later underwent an operation, said 
the sources contacted by telephone from Cyprus. They did not 
give any information about the assailants. 
  The attack came only two days after an AFP correspondent, 
German-born Lissy Schmidt, and her bodyguard were killed by 
unidentified gunmen in the al-Sulaymaniyah area close to the 
Iranian border. 
  Since the start of the year the UN has reported 13 attacks 
against foreigners in Iraqi Kurdistan, which have left one 
person dead and seven wounded. 
  One of the main Iraqi Kurdish groups, the Patriotic Union of 
Kurdistan (PUK), said earlier in a statement from Damascus that 
Iraqi President Saddam Husayn's regime had "promised a reward of 
10,000 dollars to anyone killing a foreigner in Kurdistan."

went off early this week at the main mosque in Irbil, causing no 
deaths. 
  A spokesman for the Kurdish Administration has blamed the 
regime of tyrant Saddam for this and other bombings that have 
occurred in northern Iraq. The spokesman said that the aim of 
these bombings is to undermine security and stability in 
northern Iraqi. The spokesman added that security organs in the 
area uncovered a number of subversive attempts planned by the 
regime's agents. The detained agents confessed that the 
authorities of the Ba'thist regime forced them to carry out 
these subversive acts and promised to reward them generously.

  [Text] Nicosia, April 3 (AFP) -- Gunmen shot dead an AFP 
correspondent and her bodyguard in an ambush near 
al-Sulaymaniyah in Iraqi Kurdistan on Sunday [3 April], UN aid 
workers said. 
  Lissy Schmidt, a 35-year-old German, was travelling by car 
with her Iraqi Kurdish bodyguard when they were attacked east of 
the city, Steven Allen of UNICEF in the northern Iraqi town of 
Irbil told AFP by telephone. 
  The ambush occurred at 1:00 p.m. (0900 GMT). 
  Schmidt was the only foreign journalist permanently based in 
Iraqi Kurdistan, which has had de facto autonomy since a Kurdish 
uprising against the Baghdad regime following the 
January-February 1991 Gulf war. 
  She worked for AFP and the German media, notably the 
Frankfurter Rundschau and Tagesspiegel newspapers.

  [Excerpt] Nicosia, April 4 (AFP)--An AFP correspondent and 
her bodyguard in Iraqi Kurdistan were killed instantly when one 
or more gunmen fired at their car with automatic weapons at 
short range, UN officials said Monday. 
  Lissy Schmidt, a 35-year-old German, was travelling with her 
Iraqi Kurdish bodyguard on a road linking al-Sulaymaniyah with 
Sayid Sadiq near the Iranian border when they were attacked from 
a passing car Sunday, UN officials in the area told AFP by 
telephone. 
  "It was really (an attack) aimed at her," one UN source 
said. 
"She had no chance." 
  The two bodies were sent to a mortuary at al-Sulaymaniyah 
hospital. Schmidt's body is to be flown back to Germany. 
  UN officials said it was not known who carried out the 
attack. 
  Schmidt had not spoken of any threats on her life in the 
days 
before her death. 
  In Damascus one of the main Iraqi Kurdish groups, the 
Patriotic Union of Kurdistan (PUK), said Iraqi President Saddam 
Husayn's regime had "promised a reward of 10,000 dollars to 
anyone killing a foreigner in Kurdistan." 
  However, the PUK, which runs the de facto autonomous region 
with the Democratic Party of Kurdistan (DPK), did not name the 
killers in its statement. 
  The PUK said Schmidt and the bodyguard, Aziz Qadir, were 
killed instantly by the gunmen at a range of around 300 metres 
(yards). They were near Jakhnakhajian village. [passage omitted]

  [Text] Jerusalem, April 7 (AFP) -- The Islamic Resistance 
Movement HAMAS warned Thursday [7 April] it will soon fire 
rockets at Israeli homes and urged Palestinians to stock up with 
food for war. 
  The threat in a communique distributed in the occupied 
territories came a day after a suicide bomber from the HAMAS 
armed wing 'Izz-al-Din al-Qassam killed seven Israelis and 
wounded 45 at 'Afula. 
  That was just the first of five major attacks to come on 
Israeli targets in revenge for the Hebron mosque massacre of 30 
Moslems by a Jewish settlers on February 25, HAMAS said. 
  "We are calling on settlers to evacuate now so no one will 
be 
able to accuse us of killing civilians," the communique said. 
  "Our al-Qassam units will shell their homes with rockets 
that 
we have received recently. Everyone knows we keep our word." 
  HAMAS called on "shopkeepers and the people to stock up with 
foodstuffs because an atmosphere of war will prevail in the near 
future." 
  The statement also urged PLO chairman Yasir 'Arafat to halt 
negotiations with Israel for one year. 
  "Our units will force Israeli leaders to evacuate their 
soldiers and settlers from Gaza, Jericho and Hebron without any 
conditions as a first step to liberating the whole of the West 
Bank and strip," HAMAS said. 
  "We will guarantee Arafat's position as president if he 
agrees." 
  The communique noted that 'Izz-al-Din al-Qassam waited until 
the traditional Moslem day of mourning 40 days after the Hebron 
slaughter to carry out the bombing in 'Afula, northern Israel.

  [Excerpts] First to 'Afula where a car bomb exploded three 
meters from a bus. Latest reports say five people were killed, 
another 35 at least wounded. The incident occurred near a 
cultural center. Apparently there was a suicide bomber in the 
car. Neil Samba has the story. Neil. 
  [Samba] The explosion occurred at around 1230 near the 
cultural center of 'Afula not far from the town's ... er, in the 
center of the 'Afula, not far from the town's main auditorium. 
Latest reports speak of five dead and 35 injured, but these 
figures are changing and constantly being updated. Reports from 
[words indistinct] say that the injuries range from light to 
serious. Some of the injured were on the bus and others were 
waiting at a nearby bus station. All of the injured are being 
taken to the (?Haemic) hospital. The evacuation continues at 
this hour. We've just heard though that two of those seriously 
injured were taken to Haifa, Haifa's (?Rambam) hospital. 
Northern district police commander Jacob Grenel was the first 
to confirm that it was in fact a car bomb that exploded near an 
Egged bus, but he said it's not clear whether it was a suicide 
bomber or whether the bomb was set off by remote control. 
  The explosion took place three to four meters from a bus 
stop. [passage omitted].

  [Text] According to the latest reports from 'Afula, eight 
people were killed in the car bomb explosion, apparently 
including the terrorist who drove the car. More than 50 people 
were wounded in the explosion. Five people who were gravely 
wounded were transferred to the Rambam Hospital in Haifa, where 
one of them died of her wounds. Another four wounded are 
currently being transferred to the Tel Hashomer Hospital. Eight 
of the wounded were released; 33 people were hospitalized in the 
'Afula Hospital with light to moderate injuries. 
  Police Minister Shahal and Police Commissioner Peled arrived 
at the scene. Minister Shahal said that since the Hebron 
massacre the Police feared Arab terrorist attacks, and several 
attacks were indeed foiled. Commissioner Peled said that it is 
possible that as of tomorrow no vehicles from the territories 
will be allowed entrance into the Green Line, because it is 
inconceivable that Israel would allow inhabitants of the 
territories to enter the Green Line to carry out attacks. The 
issue of the closure will also be reassessed. The commissioner 
added that the timing of the attack -- 40 days after the Hebron 
massacre -- did not surprise the police, which were recently 
reinforced along the Green Line and in Jerusalem. 
  Our correspondent Yo'av Aviv reports that the car used for 
the explosion was stolen from the Tel Aviv area. Migdal Ha'emeq 
[a town near 'Afula] residents have started to congregate en 
masse, and the police are acting to prevent acts of revenge.

  [Text] Hamas [Islamic Resistance Movement] has assumed 
responsibility for the 'Afula attack, claiming that its men 
perpetrated the attack. In a leaflet distributed in Janin, 
Hamas said that the name of the suicide terrorist is Ra'id 
Zakarnah, 19, of Qabatiyah. 
  Our correspondent Moti Amir reports that a short while ago, 
the security forces arrived in Qabatiyah, and took Zakarnah's 
father to the Ha'emeq Hospital to identify the body.

<F P=106> [Commentary by News Research and Commentaries Group] </F>
  [Text] The brave and martyr-seeking attack by a Palestinian 
mujahid at a Zionist bus stop--on the 40th day of the massacre 
of fasting worshipers in the al-Khalil mosque--which resulted in 
the death of eight Zionists and the wounding of more than 50 
others, shows, first and foremost, that the era of the intifadah 
is different from the past. By undertaking responsibility for 
this operation, the Palestinian Islamic Resistance Movement 
Hamas stated that the car explosion at a Zionist bus stop in 
'Afula in the north of occupied Palestine is in answer to the 
massacre of the fasting Palestinian worshipers at the 
al-Ibrahimi shrine and in order to avenge their unjustly shed 
blood. 
  Political observers believe that this attack demonstrates 
the 
strength of the Palestinian Islamic movement in organizing and 
carrying out jihad operations. Yesterday's attack took place on 
the anniversary of the commencement of the intifadah and the 
Zionist forces were on full alert. The place where the 
operation took place was north of occupied Palestine, or, in 
other words, outside the West Bank and Gaza Strip, a place where 
carrying out operations is extremely difficult. The admission 
by the Zionist chief of staff that the Zionist regime's military 
forces will not be able to prevent such operations in the future 
proves this point even further. 
  Since its founding, the Zionist regime has unilaterally 
massacred and rendered homeless the people of Palestine and Arab 
countries that share borders with occupied Palestine. Because 
of the unequal military balance and extensive support by 
international powers for the usurping regime, the reaction by 
the people of Palestine and the world has not been strong enough 
to stop this inhuman process. However, now that the Muslim 
Palestinians have been armed with the spirit of jihad and 
martyrdom, the situation has completely changed. 
  Seven years ago, with the commencement of the intifadah and 
the persistent struggle against the Zionist regime, the 
Palestinians gave up the past beliefs of political leaders of 
Palestine in defending the rights of the Palestinian Muslims 
through international organizations. By relying on the 
Palestinian people and their Islamic belief, they set off on a 
path that has proven to be effective and, God willing, will lead 
to victory in the not very distant future.

<F P=106> [Report by Cairo correspondent Shefi Gabay, Avino'am Bar- </F>
Yosef, Hemi Shalev, Gad Shimron, Yo'av Limor, Amir Gilat, and 
ITIM] 
  [Excerpt] Last night, we (a few Israeli journalists) asked 
PLO leader Yasir 'Arafat: "What is your reaction to the 
murderous attack perpetrated in Israel today?" 'Arafat bowed 
his head for a second. Suddenly he turned his back and walked 
out of the room without saying a word. 
  Senior sources in Jerusalem last night expressed serious 
disappointment with the PLO's feeble reactions to the terrorist 
attack in 'Afula and the fact that 'Arafat has not yet condemned 
it. 
  Arab sources close to Hamas [Islamic Resistance Movement] 
claim that 'Arafat relayed a positive message to Hamas in the 
wake of the attack. According to these sources, in a talk with 
various activists, the PLO leader voiced a certain measure of 
support for the attack but noted that due to the negotiations 
and the political situation, he could not say as much in public. 
The message was relayed to Ibrahim Ghawshah, the Hamas 
spokesman in Jordan, but was leaked in the process. 
  Nabil Sha'th, head of the Palestinian delegation to the 
peace 
talks with Israel, said that the lethal attack in 'Afula proves 
the need to sign the agreement soon. "This is one of the 
reasons we are pushing for the agreement to be signed: to put 
an end to the killings." [passage omitted]

<F P=106> [Report by military correspondent Eytan Rabin] </F>
  [Text] Security sources said yesterday that the 
booby-trapped car that blew up in 'Afula was assembled by 
experts. They believe the terrorist who was killed in the blast 
did not assemble the car bomb but was merely a suicide driver. 
  The sources added that this type of booby-trapped car is 
used 
by Hizballah. Therefore, it may very well be that the gang that 
assembled the bomb used the know-how acquired by the Hamas 
[Islamic Resistance Movement] activists who were deported to 
Lebanon in December 1992 and who returned to the territories a 
few months ago. The sources pointed out that the deportees, who 
spent a year at the Marj al-Zuhur encampment, were trained in 
the preparation of bombs and booby-trapped cars by Hizballah 
experts and Iranian elements.

<F P=106> [Report by Mohammad Beshkar in Beirut] </F>
  [Text] The Islamic Jihad in Palestine has announced its 
responsibility for the operation carried out by one of the 
Palestinian mujahidin this morning in the occupied city of 
Ashdod, north of the Gaza Strip. A Zionist settler was killed 
and four others were wounded in the attack. A statement by the 
movement obtained by our radio says: 'Ali al-'Amawi, an Islamic 
Jihad member from the al-Shati' camp in Gaza, acting alone, 
attacked a group of armed Zionist settlers in Ashdod this 
morning, killing one and seriously wounding four others. The 
mujahid was martyred by Israeli occupation forces' gunfire 
during the attack. 
  In a telephone contact with him a short time ago, Dr. Fathi 
al- Shiqaqi, secretary general of the Islamic Jihad in 
Palestine, stressed the continuation of jihad and military 
operations against the occupation forces and the Zionist 
settlers. He condemned UN Secretary General Butrus Butrus-Ghali 
and the president of the Security Council for rushing to condemn 
the martyrdom-seeking operation in 'Afula, north of occupied 
Palestine, yesterday. He said this proves that the United 
Nations and the Security Council are controlled by the American 
will. Asked about the Islamic Jihad in Palestine's operation 
today, he said: 
  [Begin al-Shiqaqi recording] The operations will continue. 
They reflect our people's protest against and rejection of the 
alleged and [word indistinct] peace agreement between the PLO 
and the Israelis. They stress that our people's option is to 
continue jihad and fight despite all attempts by the United 
States, the Zionist enemy, and the official Palestinian side to 
implement the Oslo agreement, which, again, I stress, makes 
peace for no one but gives another reason for war. [end

    [Editorial Report] Jerusalem Qol Yisra'el in Hebrew on 3 
April carries several reports by legal affairs correspondent 
Mira Amsalem on the testimonies heard today by the Shamgar 
commission of inquiry into the Hebron massacre. 
  At 0700 GMT, Amsalem reports on the testimony of Tzvi 
Katzover, head of the Qiryat Arba' Council. Katzover warned 
that more acts of despair by individuals should be expected if 
the IDF [Israel Defense Forces] continues to desert the 
settlers, leaving them to fend for themselves. He denounced 
Goldstein's deed, saying that most residents of Qiryat Arba' 
disapprove of it, even if they understand the reasons that drove 
Goldstein to it. 
  "Commission member Moshe Levi, a former chief of staff, 
asked 
Katzover whether the Qiryat Arba' Council had taken any action 
to get rid of people whom he suspects might carry out acts of 
despair. Katzover explained that the council had no authority to 
expel people, but that he had approached the commander of the 
Central Command and given him names of dangerous people." 
  At 1100 GMT, the radio reports that "sewage truck driver Eli 
Ganon denied allegations that he had entered the Cave of the 
Patriarchs carrying an M-16 rifle and had thus confused 
witnesses trying to identify the weapon used by Barukh 
Goldstein." 
  Ganon told the Shamgar commission that "he was not carrying 
a 
rifle on the morning of the massacre, but was only armed with a 
pistol. He added that he normally kept an Uzi submachine gun at 
home," and noted that "he did not see Goldstein on the morning 
of the massacre." 
  At 1400 GMT, Amsalem reports on the testimony of Brigadier 
General David Agmon, the chief of staff's adviser on intifadah 
affairs. His testimony centered on the question of how Barukh 
Goldstein entered the Cave of the Patriarchs and whether it was 
reasonable to assume that he had an accomplice. Agmon stated 
that in his first debriefing to the chief of staff he had noted 
that Goldstein walked into the cave through the main entrance, 
and not through a side door. In Agmon's opinion, Goldstein 
operated alone and was armed with a Glilon rifle which was found 
in the hall after the massacre. Nevertheless, Agmon said he had 
heard from soldiers that they were used to seeing Goldstein with 
an M-16 rifle. He rejected the theory raised by Justice 
al-Zu'bi that Goldstein's accomplice was carrying an M-16 rifle 
and a bag to collect spent bullets. Justice Shamgar also 
remarked that such a possibility did not appear reasonable to 
him. 
  Earlier, the commission heard the testimony of four of the 
10- man group of worshipers Goldstein used to pray with. They 
confirmed that only shots, not explosions, were heard in the 
cave at the time of the massacre. A discrepancy was found 
between the testimony of one of the worshipers, Yosef Nagar, and 
his deposition to the police over the question of the place 
through which Goldstein had entered the Muslim's prayer hall. 
  "Goldstein's widow, Miryam, failed to appear before the 
commission."

    [Editorial Report] Jerusalem Qol Yisra'el in English at 
1030 GMT on 4 April reports that "in this morning's session, the 
commission heard Police Inspector Leon Nadivi's ballistics 
report on the bullets fired during the massacre. He said he 
checked 115 cartridges collected in the area of the Cave of the 
Patriarchs, where the massacre took place -- 89 had been fired 
from the Glilon rifle belonging to Barukh Goldstein; 5 had come 
from soldiers' weapons; and one was fired by an unidentified 
gun. Nadivi said also that he found no indication of grenade 
explosions. Several Arab witnesses who were in the cave at the 
time testified they heard explosions of the type associated with 
a grenade." 
  Jerusalem Qol Yisra'el in English at 1500 GMT on 4 April 
reports that "in today's proceedings police ballistics experts 
said one of the bullets found on the scene did not belong to the 
gun of Barukh Goldstein but remains unidentified."

<F P=106> [Report by Dalya Shehori] </F>
  [Excerpts] Mystery surrounds the presence of a second 
person who entered the Cave of the Patriarchs after Barukh 
Goldstein and who, according to testimonies by soldiers who 
guarded the eastern gate, was carrying a Galil rifle. When 
Major Dov Stelman, the cave commander, arrived at the cave and 
ordered all those present to remain on the premises, this person 
had already left and was not questioned by the police. Colonel 
Yo'av Galant, who testified before the Shamgar Commission on 31 
March behind closed doors, said "some degree of cooperation may 
be involved here." 
  Col. Galant believes Goldstein's operation was planned. 
Galant outlined the conclusions and recommendations he drafted 
in a report he prepared at the request of Major General Sha'ul 
Mufaz, commander of the IDF [Israel Defense Forces] troops in 
the West Bank. The report recommends that the prevailing status 
quo at the cave be changed and that a full "territorial" 
division be made between Jews and Muslims by banning the Jews 
from praying at Isaac Hall; that new security arrangements be 
prepared and that the cave be reopened to the public only after 
they are completed, "even if it takes a very long time;" and 
that the security arrangements include stationing a significant 
police force, an antiterror team, and a permanent and 
well-trained military unit. The report also recommends that, 
after all of the steps are taken, worshipers not be allowed to 
enter the cave armed. [passage omitted] 
  Answering a question by Commission Chairman Shamgar, Col. 
Galant confirmed that "the other person was only seen coming in; 
no one saw him leave." Shamgar speculated, therefore, that the 
man could have left the cave along with the Arabs who were 
fleeing after the shooting, and Galant agreed. [passage omitted] 
  Galant further said that it is assumed that Goldstein 
entered 
Isaac Hall from Abraham Hall and that the Jewish worshipers 
there did not know what his purpose was -- that is, they were 
not certain he was about to commit an act of violence. Perhaps 
they thought that "in the framework of the constant provocations 
that take place in the cave, they would let him in to tease the 
Arabs a little; after all, it was Purim. No big deal. Then 
Goldstein went in, and they closed the doors behind him." 
Galant stressed, however, that he had no evidence to support 
this assumption and that he only brought it up to illustrate the 
dilemmas he encountered while preparing his report, but he 
formed no opinion on this issue. [passage omitted] 
  Col. Galant believes "Goldstein's act was premeditated." 
This assumption is based on the fact that he was carrying a 
large number of magazines and that he left notes indicating that 
he feared he might not return from his operation. "He went 
there to shoot; otherwise, it is hard to explain why he took 
earplugs with him. I believe everything he did was perfectly 
timed to the moment the Muslims kneel to pray to attain the 
maximum effect during his attack," he noted. 
  Galant added that Goldstein was killed by blows to the head 
from heavy objects and did not shoot himself, as was initially 
believed. [passage omitted]

  [Text] The three terrorists killed in Hebron approximately 
10 days ago were involved in the murders of several Israelis in 
the territories. An IDF [Israel Defense Forces] spokesman 
reported that ballistic examinations of their weapons prove that 
the three men participated in the murders of Efrayim Ayubi, 
Shalom and Mordekhay Lapid, Me'ir Mendelovich, and Eliyahu 
Levin. They also participated in other terrorist attacks in 
which three Israeli citizens and six soldiers were wounded. 
  An Arab youth was captured this afternoon at the entrance to 
the Cave of the Patriarchs in possession of a knife, a 
switchblade knife, and a leaflet calling for revenge against the 
Jews. Our correspondent Aviv Bushinsky reports that the youth 
confessed he had planned to stab Jews. 
  Last night, the security forces discovered an arms cache 
containing a Kalashnikov rifle, a handgun, and a large quantity 
of ammunition, in Gaza city, near the home of a local resident, 
who is a Hamas [Islamic Resistance Movement] activist. Our 
correspondent Moti Amir reports that the man was detained for 
questioning.

  [Excerpts] A Fatah member from Khan Yunus was killed this 
evening as he was assembling a bomb in the Khan Yunus refugee 
camp. The victim is Khalid Halabi, who spent eight years in an 
Israeli prison because of his Fatah membership. His body was 
snatched away from the hospital. 
  Our correspondent Shlomi Eldar adds that shots were fired 
this evening at an IDF [Israel Defense Forces] lookout position 
in al-Shaykh Radwan. Nobody was hurt. The Fatah Hawks claimed 
responsibility for this attempted terrorist attack. 
  [Jerusalem Qol Yisra'el in Hebrew at 1900 GMT on 2 April 
adds: [passage omitted] "A firebomb was thrown this evening at 
an Israeli car in the 'Aqabat Jabr refugee camp on the outskirts 
of Jericho. Nobody was hurt and no damage was caused. The 
driver reported the incident and drove away. An IDF unit 
arrived on the scene and found the firebomb's remnants as well 
as empty cartridges. Shortly afterward, an Arab suffering 
serious wounds arrived in a hospital in the area. The security 
forces are checking whether the man was the one who threw the 
firebomb and was wounded by shots fired by passengers aboard the 
Israeli car."]

  [Text] In the context of the security measures that the 
Internal Security Forces and Army units are using to reassure 
the citizens, maintain stability, and punish those who disregard 
the lives of the citizens, Ba'labakk's Gendarmerie Company, 
operating under the command of Colonel Hasan Hallaq, the 
al-Biqa' area commander; and company commander Staff Col. 
Ghassan Subh, has carried out raids with the assistance of the 
Syrian Arab forces deployed in the area. The company arrested 
four individuals of the Shakar family in the township of al-Nabi 
Shit. They are Zakariya Muhammad Shakar, 'Ali Wahbah Shakar, 
Haytham Wahbah Shakar, and Muhammad 'Ali Shakar. They were 
detained in connection with the accidental fatal shooting of the 
policeman Husayn 'Ali Shakar. 
  In Tripoli a military engineer defused a small explosive 
device which had been placed in a yellow Renault 12 in the 
city's Abu-Samrah district. The device had been set to detonate 
when the accelerator was depressed. A security source said it 
is likely that the car owner was the intended victim because of 
a personal dispute. 
  In a related development, a noise bomb exploded under the 
car 
of Ahmad Tawfiq al-Barqawi al-Halabi in Tripoli's al-Mullah 
area. The incident occurred while the car owner was driving it, 
but there was only minor damage to the car.

<F P=106> [Interview with Col. Khalifah Haftar, commander of the </F>
National Libyan Army, and Burayk Suwaysi, official spokesman for 
the Libyan Movement for Change and Reform, by Mufid 
'Abd-al-Rahim "Somewhere in the United States"; date not given] 
  [Excerpts] [passage omitted] 'Abd-al-Rahim: If 
your differences with the Libyan opposition factions are not 
substantive, why create this new organization? 
  Haftar: We will be distinguishable from others by 
our program of action. We do have differences with certain 
factions. We would not have quit the NFSL if there had not been 
differences between us. We do not want to be mere public 
relations people trumpeting non- existent successes without 
taking concrete action against the regime. Based on our 
understanding of how this regime handles Libyan forces inside 
and outside the country, we feel that the way to deal with this 
regime is through military operations and violence. 
  'Abd-al-Rahim: Are you an armed organization out 
to topple the Libyan regime by force? I am asking this question 
because the new organization is headed by a military man. 
  Suwaysi: Let me first put the record straight. 
Colonel Khalifah was not appointed chief of the new 
organization. He remains the commander of the National Libyan 
Army, virtually all of which has switched sides and joined our 
new organization. Colonel Khalifah is also a member of the 
constituent assembly of the new organization, which plans to 
choose its leadership by a democratic vote that will be held 
during a general congress in four to five months. Media reports 
to the contrary are not true. 
  It is not true that we are a military organization only. We 
will use all means, including military, to advance our 
objectives. We will use violence as a means to an end, and only 
as a last resort. We would very much like not to have to resort 
to violence, which will, naturally, result in bloodshed, and 
that we certainly do not want. 
  If the regime fulfills the people's demands peacefully, then 
so be it. Otherwise, we will have no other alternative but to 
resort to violence against it. [passage omitted] 
  'Abd-al-Rahim: Have you contacted Arab 
governments, specifically neighboring countries, given that they 
are more important to you as a Libyan opposition movement. Have 
you opened any official bureaus in any Arab or foreign country? 
  Suwaysi: We have not contacted these countries, as 
yet. If this takes place, it will be in a very limited manner, 
for example like the contacts that should have already been held 
with the Egyptian brothers. Of course, we intend to contact all 
the Arab countries soon. We have not opened official bureaus 
either because we are still a new movement, no more than 40 days 
old. 
  'Abd-al-Rahim: How do you view your movement's 
relationship with the United States, which is without any doubt 
an important country to you because part of your armed elements 
and members of your movement are in the United States? 
  Suwaysi: Our relationship with the United States 
will be as with any other country, based on Libya's national 
interests. We will develop this relationship to serve the 
Libyan cause without harming the Libyan people's interests. We 
hope that the United States will understand the Libyan people's 
cause and their legitimate demands for freedom, democracy, and 
human rights. [passage omitted] 
  Haftar: The National Libyan Army, groups of which 
are in the United States and Europe, is also comprised of 
nationalist elements within the Libyan Armed Forces who have 
patriotic feelings. They can carry out military operations 
against the forces supporting the regime in parallel with the 
operations we will carry out abroad. [passage omitted] 
  We believe it [the United States] will adopt a neutral stand 
on the establishment of our movement until we contact it 
officially to explain our new approach to the situation, an 
approach that is different from that of the NFSL. [passage 
omitted] 
  Suwaysi: [passage omitted] A military strike on 
Libya sounds like the easiest option open to the Clinton 
administration. We are certain that al-Qadhdhafi would like 
nothing better than for the United States to launch an air 
attack on Libya to recoup some popular support for his regime. 
Such an attack would be a disaster, since it would once again 
cast al- Qadhdhafi in the role of a hero and victim. 
  'Abd-al-Rahim: Are you saying that you and the 
Clinton administration do not see eye to eye on how to exploit 
the Lockerbie affair to topple the al-Qadhdhafi regime? 
  Suwaysi: No. We have said publicly that the 
removal of al- Qadhdhafi is a matter for the Libyan people. We 
are not asking the United States to dislodge al-Qadhdhafi for 
us; all we want from the United States is to understand and 
support the Libyan people's goals. 
  Given that the United States has not been able to muster the 
required UN Security Council vote to impose a moratorium on 
Libyan oil exports, it may be tempted by its "cowboy" mentality 
to deliver a strike against Libya. Such a course of action, in 
our opinion, will hardly eliminate al-Qadhdhafi; it may even 
make him stronger for having been the target of an external 
attack. [passage omitted] 
  'Abd-al-Rahim: Are you aware of any further plans 
to harm Libyan opposition figures after the disappearance of 
[former Libyan Foreign Minister] Mansur al-Kikhya? 
  Haftar: No. It must be pointed out, however, 
that a decision to hit Libyan opposition figures is determined 
by whether the resources and opportunity are available. If 
these are available, al-Qadhdhafi will not be deterred by any 
scruples. To our knowledge, al-Qadhdhafi now lacks the ability 
to target Libyan opposition figures.

  [Text] London -- A flier distributed by an underground 
opposition organization within the Sudanese Police force calling 
itself "The Homeland's Vanguards," reveals interesting details 
about the group that carried out the attack on the mosque of the 
Partisans of al-Sunnah in Umm Durman on 4 February, 1994. The 
leaflet indicates that the prime suspect in the case, Muhammad 
'Abd-al- Rahman al-Khulayfi, confessed to the Sudanese police 
that his organization is composed of 18 persons who come from 
Somalia, Algeria, and Egypt. The group planned to assassinate 
al-Sadiq al- Mahdi, former Sudanese prime minister, and 
Communist Party Leader Muhammad Ibrahim Naqd. The plan did not 
include Dr. Hasan al-Turabi or businessman Usamah Bin-Ladin as 
Khartoum contended. 
  Sudanese opposition sources, speaking to AL-HAYAH yesterday, 
said the Sudanese authorities had pensioned off 15 police 
officers after charging them with distributing the flier and 
making public part of the interrogation with the first suspect 
in the case. Among the suspects are Brigadier General al-Khayr 
Madani and Lieutenant Colonel Bura'i Wahbah. 
  The leaflet quotes al-Khulayfi as telling interrogators he 
was of Libyan citizenship and received military training at the 
al-Biqa' valley in Lebanon at the hands of the Iranian 
Revolutionary Guards in 1987 and 1988. From there he proceeded 
to Peshawar in Pakistan to join the Afghan mujahidin. According 
to the leaflet, al-Khulayfi disclosed that he met in Lebanon 
with Yasir Muhammad and 'Abd-al- Baqi Nur, both of whom were 
killed in a clash with Sudanese police following the attack on 
the mosque. They were also said to have set up a Sudanese 
organization under the name "al-Jihad Organization." Yasir 
Muhammad's group was said to be composed of 18 members who came 
from Somalia, Algeria, and Egypt. 
  Al-Khulayfi traced his acquaintance with Bin-Ladin back to 
Peshawar. The two were introduced by the Syrian martyr 
"Bassam." While in Khartoum, al-Khulayfi pointed out, he was 
staying with a group of Libyans, with whom he fell out and then 
left to live in a room at Bin-Ladin's residence in the al-Riyad 
neighborhood in Khartoum. 
  Al-Khulayfi is quoted as saying that his group was asked to 
prepare a plan to kill al-Mahdi and Naqd. The implementation 
was set for last 'Id al-Adha but was aborted by the tight 
security around al-Mahdi. He indicated that "a Sudanese ordered 
that we carry out the mosque operation, and told me that two of 
the Muslim Sudanese mujahidin will shortly arrive to share the 
house with me and implement this jihad duty." 
  In the course of the interrogation, al-Khulayfi assailed 
Sudan's Interior Minister Brig. Gen. 'Abd-al-Rahim Muhammad 
Husayn, and said: "This man, who is ignorant in matters of 
religion, denied he knew me, although he used to see me at 
Shaykh Hasan al-Turabi's home. Every time the debate in 
religious matters became heated, he lowered his head." 
Al-Khulayfi regarded what he did to be a punishment, indicating 
that the following day members of his group went to al-Riyad 
neighborhood not to flee as had been said but to inform 
al-Turabi and Bin-Ladin. When we got to Bin-Ladin's residence, 
he berated us because we had not sought his permission. But we 
told him that war between infidels and Muslims is an ongoing 
affair. Bin-Ladin then left me and went into his home and asked 
his guards to arrest us, but we opened fire on them. They were 
three, two Iranians and an Egyptian. His companion Yasir, he 
went on, was killed in the clash, and 'Abd-al-Baqi died in the 
ambulance. 
  Bin-Ladin, the leaflet goes on, has charge of the Arab 
mujahidin in Sudan and al-Turabi the Islamic jihad in Egypt, 
Tunisia, Algeria, and Mauritania. Al-Khulayfi was quoted as 
saying: "Why should I attack al-Turabi as some news media 
reported, when he is the leader of the world Islamic movement?" 
He stressed that he had no regrets over what he had done.

  [Text] Sanaa, 3 Apr (INA)--Yemeni gunmen today kidnapped 
two members of a Chinese team that is working on the 
Jihanah-Ma'rib road project, 49 km northeast of the Yemeni 
capital, Sanaa. 
  To free the two Chinese experts, the kidnappers are 
demanding 
that work on the road, which extends over 76 km along the Saudi- 
Yemeni border, be stopped. The project was started in 1991. 
  On 12 February, Yemeni gunmen kidnapped three Chinese 
experts 
working on the same project. The experts were released on 21 
February. 
  Informed Yemeni sources have indicated that the Saudi regime 
is behind the kidnapping, and that this regime seeks to obstruct 
the project, which, once completed, would allow the Yemeni 
authorities to control smuggling, curb acts of economic 
sabotage, and check the Saudi regime's ambition to expand into 
Yemeni territory.

<F P=106> [Unattributed report: "Saved From Disaster"] </F>
  [Text] During the civil war in Tajikistan, Russian troops 
prevented an explosion at the Nurek Hydroelectric Power Station 
in the mountains which could have led to catastrophic flooding 
of many Central Asian areas. The investigation into last year's 
events is still going on, since some saboteurs among the armed 
Tajik opposition gunmen have managed to take refuge on Afghan 
territory. 
  It has been learned from informed sources in Dushanbe that 
the extremists planned to drive three "Zil" trucks loaded with 
explosives into the hydroelectric facility's operational tunnels 
and detonate them. In the opinion of military experts, a 
serious danger of flooding was averted: The unique mountain 
station's dam is 350 meters high. The reservoir's total 
capacity is 10.4 billion cubic meters. The wave after the 
explosion could have been 86 meters high. The initial width and 
length of flooding could have been 53 km and 1,385 km 
respectively. Over 2,000 villages and seven cities in 
Tajikistan, Uzbekistan, and Turkmenia could have been flooded. 
  The blowing up of the dam was prevented by soldiers of the 
201st Russian Motorized Rifle Division's Kulyab Regiment, two of 
whom died in a shootout with Tajik opposition gunmen. 
  Colonel General Eduard Vorobyev, who headed the 
antiterrorist 
operation and is now first deputy commander in chief of Russian 
Ground Forces, informed an ITAR-TASS correspondent that the 
extremists had also planned a sabotage operation to destroy the 
nitrogen mineral fertilizer plant in the city of Yavan. Its 
consequences could have led to the mass poisoning and death of 
people.

<F P=106> [Jochen Kummer report: "`Struggle for Freedom' of Kurds in </F>
Germany -- With Heroin and Blackmail"] 
  [Excerpts] Last week, scenes from Kurdish terrorism on 
German soil dominated television screens and front pages. The 
prohibited terrorist Workers Party of Kurdistan [PKK] turned 
Germany into a theater-of-war: It controlled nationwide highway 
blockades and attacked policemen, it laid fires, and had fanatic 
compatriots set themselves on fire. [passage omitted] 
  As the Duesseldorf Higher Regional Court realized, since 
1984 
Germany has been the European focus of the PKK, which has its 
headquarters in Cologne. About 500,000 Kurds have meanwhile 
settled in Europe -- 400,000 of them in Germany. About 40,000 
Kurds in Germany are classified as PKK sympathizers and about 
400 as members. They entered the country legally as respectable 
workers with Turkish citizenship, they came as asylum-seekers, 
or they were illegally taken to Germany. [passage omitted] 
  The commander and secretary general of the Marxist-Leninist 
"cadre party," PKK, is Abdullah Ocalan. According to findings 
of the German intelligence services, he is lodging, together 
with his wirepullers, in Damascus in Syria. 
  "The orders for attacks and demonstrations come from 
abroad," 
Ernst Uhrlau, president of the Hamburg Office for the Protection 
of the Constitution, says. A "Central Committee" of the PKK in 
Europe coordinates the activities; the so-called area committees 
are subordinate to it. 
  By Ocalan's order, the PKK organized six large-scale waves 
of 
attack in Western Europe and Germany in 1992 and 1993. About 
600 perpetrators participated in about 50 attacks in 
European-wide violent actions on 24 June 1993. On 4 November, 
about 60 violent attacks of Kurds on Turkish institutions and 
private houses were ascertained all over the FRG. 
  As a result, the PKK was banned in Germany. The 35 Kurdish 
groups that were prohibited at the same time as the PKK have 
disguised themselves with harmless names, but, according to 
findings of Germany security authorities, they are in reality 
arms of the PKK octopus that are registered as 
"suborganizations" in the local registers of associations, such 
as: "Kurdistan Art and Cultural Center in Nuremberg and 
surroundings -- registered association," "Kurdish Women's Center 
in Leverkusen -- registered association," "International 
Friendship in Munich -- registered association," "Center of 
Media Culture in Hagen -- registered association," "Mesopotamian 
Cultural Association in Bremen -- registered association," 
"Kurdish Cultural Center in Hamburg and surroundings -- 
registered association," etcetera. 
  A Kurd called Kani Yilomaz, who acts on the direction of 
Ocalan, acts as the spokesman of the PKK leadership in Europe. 
It was he who propagated the PKK's preparedness to discontinue 
its violent actions in Germany this week. 
  Apparently, the Kurds' drug deals in Germany yield enormous 
profits for the war against Turkey. [passage omitted] 
  The second special field of the Kurds is the extortion of 
protection money. With this method, they cash donations for 
their political struggle. 
  In Berlin, where 50,000 Kurds live, Kurds and Turks are so 
active in this field that the police established a special 
investigation group in March 1993. Hans-Ulrich Voss, managing 
director of the Berlin Criminal Investigation Department, 
described how the collection of donations works: "First" PKK 
representative approach businessmen "very politely" and ask for 
"donations" for the struggle for liberation. DM200 are 
requested from owners of kebab stalls, while owners of travel 
agencies and insurance agencies have to pay up to DM20,000 -- 
these amounts are often requested every month. 
  Turkish private persons are visited at home late at night. 
Their donations are calculated according to the size of the 
Turkish family's car. Hesitant victims are brought to heel by 
referring to one's knowledge of the children's route to school. 
  The shop windows of those Turks who still refuse to pay are 
broken or incendiary devices are thrown into the shops. With 
such attacks, the Kurds achieve a welcome additional effect: 
According to initial appearances, German right-wing extremists 
are initially blamed for such attacks. 
  However, the Berlin special investigation group discovered: 
"Collectors of donations" from Turkey, not -- as originally 
assumed -- xenophobic Germans, are responsible for many 
destroyed shop windows and arson attacks in Berlin-Kreuzberg. 
  According to Berlin experiences, only about 10 percent of 
the 
victims admit that they have been blackmailed; 10 percent claim 
that they pay "voluntary donations." The rest, 80 percent, are 
silent. 
  In Frankfurt on Main, the Municipal Office granted licenses 
for 2,500 "public houses and restaurants" -- 40 percent of which 
were to foreigners. Frankfurt senior detective officer Roland 
Ullmann estimates that "there is hardly anybody who does not 
pay."

  [Excerpts] The World's Most Bloody Terror 
Organizations Met in the Greek Cypriot Sector and Adopted 
Decisions. ASALA [Armenian Secret Army for the Liberation of 
Armenia] Scourge Is Reviving Dirty Conspiracies in Southern 
Cyprus. The Revival of ASALA Was Endorsed in a Meeting Held in 
Nicosia With the Participation of the World's Most Bloody Terror 
Organizations Under the Chairmanship of Iran and Libya. 
<H5>  There Will Be an Explosion in Terrorism Around the World </H5>
  The Iranian Revolutionary Guards, the Armenian Secret Army 
ASALA, the German and Japanese Red Armies, Red Brigades, Islamic 
Jihad, and Abu-Nidal's groups took part in the secret meeting 
held recently. Plans were made at the meeting, chaired by the 
heads of the Iranian and Libyan intelligence organizations, for 
operations that would soak the world in blood within a short 
period. The organizations were assigned duties for armed and 
bomb attacks. 
<H5>  The Bloody ASALA Is Again on the Scene </H5>
  The wife of ASALA terrorist Agopyan, who was murdered in 
Athens in 1988, also took part in the meeting as the leader of 
that organization. Agopyan's wife, who met with the prominent 
intelligence officer in Tehran 'Ali Falahian recently, obtained 
great support also from the other bloody terror organizations 
during the meeting in Nicosia. The meeting, during which Tehran 
exerted enormous pressure to revive ASALA, promised to provide 
every assistance to this bloody organization to organize itself 
in many European countries. [passage omitted] 
<H5>  Their First Act Took Place in Corsica </H5>
  The decisions adopted in Nicosia made themselves felt. The 
shootings and bombings last night following the detention of 14 
members of the "Corsica National Liberation Front," which 
struggles for the liberation of the island, while preparing to

  [Text] It is being claimed that Cypriot Theofilos 
Yeoryiadhis, who was a friend of the Kurds, was murdered by the 
Public Security Unit (KGB) [Kamu Guvenligi Birimi], which is 
attached to the Presidency of the General Staff. [see 28 March 
Terrorism Report] 
  A high-ranking officer serving in north Cyprus claimed that 
the assassination of Yeoryiadhis, the head of the Committee for 
Solidarity With Kurdistan and of the Greek Cypriot information 
department, was planned by the Public Security Unit (KGB) 
attached to the Presidency of the General Staff. 
  Claiming that the General Staff has formed a new team in 
north Cyprus from officers who received antiterrorism and 
psychological warfare training in the United States and Israel, 
the officer asserted that the assassination of Yeoryiadhis in 
south Cyprus marked the implementation of a strategy developed 
over the past two years. [passage omitted] 
<H5>  KGB Was Established in January </H5>
  The Public Security Unit (KGB), which was established last 
January, is working under the National Security Council on 
issues relating to "the PKK and major social developments." The 
KGB, which is composed of seven people, is also tasked to ensure 
coordination between MIT, the General Directorate of Security, 
and the Foreign Ministry.

<F P=106> [Christian Sturm report: "Beard and Bald Head"] </F>
  [Text] The pictures are slightly blurred. The hand that 
guided the video camera must have shaken, probably from 
excitement. Through the lens the official of the Federal Office 
of Criminal Investigations [BKA] sees RAF [Red Army Faction] 
member Birgit Hogefeld. Beside her walks Klaus Steimetz, 
liaison man of the Office for the Protection of the Constitution. 
  The film was made on 24 June 1993 at Bad Kleinen railroad 
station -- three days before the shoot-out during which RAF 
member Wolfgang Grams and GSG-9 man Michael Newrzella were 
killed. 
  The video tape also shows another couple, who were clearly 
on 
good terms with Hogefeld and Steinmetz. 
  Only after the failed antiterror operation did the BKA start 
a nationwide search for the unknown couple -- exactly at 1850 
hours [1650 GMT]. Too late, the two had long disappeared. 
  Today it is clear that the BKA investigators let two people 
slip through their fingers, who are linked with the 
assassination of Trust Agency chief Detlef Karsten Rohwedder on 
1 April 1991. 
  An internal BKA paper notes soberly: When evaluating the 
video tape, the experts discovered that the man might be the 
unknown person seen during the attack on Rohwedder. 
  Some days before the attack a suspect -- 190 cm tall, 
bearded, and bald -- was observed spying on Rohwedder's villa in 
Duesseldorf from nearby gardens. According to the BKA, this is 
the man filmed in Bad Kleinen chatting with Hogefeld and 
Steinmetz. 
  A so-called covert search is currently underway all over the 
country -- so far without the involvement of the media. At the 
beginning of March the BKA sent photos of the unknown couple to 
all police stations, with a warning in bold print: Pay 
particular attention to your own safety [Eigensicherung 
besonders beachten]! 
  According to information obtained by FOCUS, another 
suspicious couple got in front of the BKA observation group's 
hidden camera on 27 June 1993, five hours before the shoot-out 
at Bad Kleinen railroad station. 
  Only later did it become clear who wanted to meet with 
Hogefeld and Grams there: RAF member Daniela Klette and 
Ernst-Volker Staub, both wanted on an arrest warrant since 1991 
for suspected participation in the attacks on Trust Agency chief 
Rohwedder and State Secretary Hans Neusel. 
  What is embarrassing is that the RAF couple noticed the 
officials and, as the BKA report says, "took photos of them in 
return."

<F P=106> [Report by Diethart Goos: "Four RAF Members Escaped Police"] </F>
  [Excerpts] Schwerin -- During the police operation of Bad 
Kleinen in June 1993 against leading Red Army Faction [RAF] 
members Wolfgang Grams and Birgit Hogefeld, the security 
authorities obviously uncovered another four suspected 
terrorists. However, they were not arrested for "tactical" 
reasons in connection with the investigations. This was 
confirmed yesterday by Herbert Helmrich, justice minister of 
Mecklenburg Western Pomerania, in an interview with DIE WELT. 
[see item AU0104091894 in previous Terrorism Report] [passage 
omitted] 
  Justice Minister Helmrich told DIE WELT that an observation 
group of the Wiesbaden-based Federal Office of Criminal 
Investigations [BKA] was in Bad Kleinen in early June, about 2 
weeks before the police operation. The BKA had information 
according to which several top terrorists of the RAF's command 
level were planning to vacation in Mecklenburg. With 
remote-controlled cameras -- one was installed in a trash can, 
another one in a Volkswagen van -- a suspicious couple was 
filmed. The cameras provided surprisingly clear pictures. The 
suspected terrorists were not rounded up because the BKA wanted 
to get more information. 
  On 27 June 1993, some 90 minutes before the shoot-out at the 
station, apart from Grams and Hogefeld, another couple was being 
observed as behaving conspicuously. According to information 
from Schwerin, this couple has been identified. They were not 
rounded up either for tactical reasons. The two young people 
managed to disappear. [passage omitted]

  [Excerpt] Wiesbaden (DPA) -- The Federal Office of 
Criminal Investigation (BKA) has rejected information in the new 
magazine FOCUS that four members of the Red Army Faction (RAF) 
might have escaped during the antiterrorist action of Bad 
Kleinen. These assumptions are wrong and do not correspond to 
the facts, BKA spokesman Hans-Georg Fuchs said in Wiesbaden on 
Thursday. However, the BKA does not wish to initiate any legal 
steps against FOCUS, it was stated. 
  It is true that on 24 June 1993, that is, three days before 
the action, the police filmed two persons who have so far not 
been identified and who were also at the expected meeting point 
of presumed RAF members Birgit Hogefeld and Wolfgang Grams. 
However, the investigators do not have any evidence that the 
man and the woman whom they filmed are terrorists, the BKA 
reported. 
  At the same time, the BKA rejected information from FOCUS 
that authorities are meanwhile proceeding on the assumption that 
the couple filmed might have participated in the murder of Trust 
Agency chief Detlef Karsten Rohwedder on 1 April 1991. A 
relevant "internal BKA paper" to which the magazine refers in 
its report is not known in the BKA, it was stated. 
  According to Fuchs, the magazine's assertion that the BKA 
investigators had filmed another couple who were only later 
recognized as presumed RAF members Daniela Klette and 
Ernst-Volker Staub at the Bad Kleinen station five hours before 
the antiterrorist action is equally wrong. The BKA does not 
have such a video recording, Fuchs said. [passage omitted]

<F P=106> [DDP report: "FOCUS Insists: Slip-Ups Occurred in Bad </F>
Kleinen"] 
  [Excerpt] Munich -- Despite official denials, slip-ups 
are believed to have occurred during the antiterrorism operation 
in Bad Kleinen, which led to the escape of four members of the 
Red Army Faction [RAF]. This was confirmed yesterday by the 
news magazine FOCUS. The magazine quotes notes and reports by 
analysts of the Federal Office of Criminal Investigation [BKA]. 
  In December 1993, the BKA prepared a leaflet showing a man 
and a woman. Moreover, the magazine quotes the following note: 
"During a later evaluation of the videotapes of the operation 
in Bad Kleinen, a specialist of BKA section 21, which is 
responsible for terrorism, discovered that the man might be one 
and the same as the man who is believed to have been involved in 
the attack on former Trust Agency head Rohwedder." An analyst 
stated that he is "100 percent sure" that the unknown man 
participated in the attack, the magazine reports. [passage

  [Excerpt] [Passage omitted] Good morning. The main police 
headquarters reports that part of the Basque Fatherland and 
Liberty's [ETA] infrastructure in Navarre has been dismantled. 
After investigations carried out by police belonging to the 
Pamplona headquarters, an apartment which was suspected of being 
ETA's operational base in Navarre was entered and searched. The 
police seized three kilos of explosives of the ammonal type, 
various devices, detonators made by ETA, car licence plates, as 
well as files belonging to the terrorist gang. 
  According to this information the ETA members might be from 
the Txomin Iturbe commando group. The apartment is located at 
60, Mayor Street, in the town of Burlada, close to Pamplona.

  [Text] Montevideo, 1 Apr (EFE) -- During a news 
conference, Uruguayan Interior Minister Raul Iturria stated 
today that the Uruguayan intelligence services have not 
discovered any indications of terrorist activities in the 
country linked to the Basque organization ETA [Basque Fatherland 
and Liberty]. 
  The minister indicated that he had only called the news 
conference because of repeated media requests due to information 
published in Madrid newspapers regarding those possible links. 
  He made it clear that in any case it was not a question of a 
new investigation, that it is a question of an investigation 
that was carried out due to the arrest of an alleged group of 
Spanish ETA activists in May 1992, and that the current 
investigation has come up with the same results. 
  The minister added that he understood the Spanish 
authorities' concern regarding the delay in handing over the 
three alleged terrorists. Uruguayan courts now have granted the 
Spaniards' extradition because in a country with a strict 
separation of the branches of government, such as in Uruguay, 
that is an affair that pertains to the judicial branch and the 
executive branch cannot interfere. 
  "No one wants this type of situation, but they must be 
handled in a very balanced way if they crop up," Iturria said, 
and he added: "Terrorism is a serious evil, as we Uruguayans 
know, and we suffered a 12-year institutional rupture due its 
activities." 
  Uruguayan intelligence services director Saul Claveria 
indicated in a separate conversation that his investigation 
regarding the charges of links between the ETA and the legal 
Uruguayan Tupamaros Party has come up with nothing that 
Uruguayan courts can term a crime. 
  Claveria also indicated that the presence of alleged ETA 
members in Uruguay cannot be presupposed to be a reactivation of 
the terrorism this country suffered in past decades, "because 
the Uruguayan people and government are against subversion: We 
Uruguayans have suffered to much because of terrorism and we do 
not want a repeat."

  [Text] Ankara -- The governor of the eastern province of 
Agri said on Thursday that Iran was cooperating with Turkey 
against separatist terrorists and delivering them "dead or 
alive" to Turkish officials after military operations. 
  Agri governor Dogan Hatipoglu told the semiofficial Anatolia 
news agency that militants of the outlawed Kurdistan Workers 
Party (PKK) were infiltrating into Turkey over the Iranian 
border but that lately modern physical barriers put up on the 
border and better security measures had reduced this traffic. 
Noting that they had a dialogue with Iran on security issues, 
Hatipoglu said "we have seen this dialogue work out. Iran was 
previously claiming that the PKK did not exist in its territory 
but changed this view after talks and seeing documentation. Now 
they are also struggling against the PKK with their own forces. 
  They have returned some terrorists either dead of alive." 
[paragraphing as published] [see item TA2003164694 in 22 March 
Terrorism Report] Hatipoglu said Turkey was extremely pleased 
over Iran's attitude and called on other neighboring countries 
to take a similar approach as well. 
  Meanwhile, officials in Sirnak province said on Thursday 
that 
the number of people killed when a passenger minibus hit a mine 
on a bridge in southeast Turkey on Wednesday had reached 
fifteen. [see previous Terrorism Report] 
  The officials said the vehicle was on a country road bridge 
near the town of Idil, in Sirnak province, when it hit the mine. 
They said the mine was planted by PKK militants and one person 
was wounded.

<F P=106> ["Own information" report: "In Combative Mood. Kurds Will </F>
Not Guarantee Safety of Pipeline Construction Workers"] 
  [Excerpts] Dzhamal Kadyr [name as transliterated], the 
Kurdistan National Liberation Front's [ERNK] representative in 
the CIS, has issued a statement to the Kurdistan Committee in 
connection with the plans to build a new oil pipeline from Baku 
to a Turkish port. [passage omitted] 
  The Workers Party of Kurdistan (PKK) has repeatedly stated 
that it will not allow any pipeline to cross the territory of 
Kurdistan without the consent of its people. Nor can the PKK 
guarantee the safety of persons employed in building the 
pipeline. These people will be arrested by the guerrillas of 
the Kurdistan Peoples' Liberation Army, D. Kadyr stated. 
  The committee recalled that during the last month alone 
Kurdistan Peoples' Liberation Army guerrillas have on seven 
occasions blown up the oil pipeline that crosses the territory 
of Kurdistan from Kirkuk in Iraq to the Turkish port of 
Iskenderun. 
  "We will not allow pipelines to be laid across our territory 
without our being asked and without the Kurds being taken into 
account at all," D. Kadyr later stated at a Moscow news 
conference. "And we do not want our natural resources to be 
exported from Kurdistan without the consent of the Kurds."

  [Text] It has been discovered that relations between the 
Kurdish Workers Party [PKK] and Athens have been strained by 
reports that the PKK has taken armed action against several 
targets in Greece and south Cyprus. Reports that Theofilos 
Yeoryiadhis, a PKK agent in south Cyprus who was recently 
murdered [see 28 March Terrorism Report], was shot and killed by 
PKK militants and not by the Turkish Intelligence Organization 
have prompted Greek officials to change the direction of their 
investigation. 
  It is believed that Yeoryiadhis, who described himself as an 
enemy of the Turks and has acted as the PKK contact in south 
Cyprus since 1979, split from that organization two months ago. 
He was killed by PKK militants, who secretly arrived in south 
Cyprus, for failing to heed the PKK's threats. 
  Meanwhile, the PKK reportedly sabotaged the tourist ship 
Athina- Palace in the Port of Piraievs last week. The ship was 
destroyed by fire. The cause of the incident has not yet been 
established. The ship was scheduled to leave Greece for Izmir 
and Kusadasi after calling at several Greek islands in the 
Aegean Sea the day after it was destroyed by fire. It has been 
claimed that the PKK decided to prevent Greek passenger ships 
from visiting Turkey and placed an incendiary bomb in the 
Athina-Palace. The explosive was to detonate when the ship 
entered the Port of Izmir. However, it detonated prematurely 
and the ship was destroyed by fire in Greece.

<F P=106> [Article by Chieh Ming (2212 2494): "Beijing's </F>
`Extraordinary 9 March Political Case'"] 
  [Text] On the night of 7 March, the Ministry of Public 
Security received a report: Four incendiary devices had been 
found in a large basket of apples at Beijing's Fengtai Sports 
Center; at the same time, two smoking incendiary bombs were 
found at a work site near the Military Museum of the Chinese 
People's Revolution. The Beijing Municipal Government duty 
office also received an anonymous telephone call, saying that an 
explosive package had been found under a bridge on Nansanhuan 
Road and that it would explode soon. When public security 
personnel and People's Armed Police arrived at the scene, they 
found nothing. The calls were hoaxes. That evening, the Beijing 
Municipal Public Security Bureau and the Beijing Municipal 
Government received 12 telephone calls and dispatched over 80 
people on various occasions to no avail. Later that night, two 
People's Armed Police on duty at the International Conference 
Center were wounded by a sniper. 
  In the early morning of 9 March, with the help of a police 
dog, the 2d detachment of the Beijing People's Armed Police 
found a time bomb made with 30 kg of TNT in a ditch beside the 
highway to the airport. The bomb was set to explode at 0500. 
In the meantime, public security personnel also found a time 
bomb in a wooden box on a slope near the Beijing-Guangzhou 
railway in Fengtai, and the ignition time was also set at 0500. 
  According to the Ministry of Public Security, the two cases 
on the night of 7 March and in the early morning of 9 March were 
carried out by the same underground organization. Anonymous 
telephone calls on the night of 7 March were also made by them. 
The incendiary bombs were home-made and the advanced way the 
chemicals were made up showed that they were made by persons 
with specialist knowledge in this field. The time bombs were 
smuggled into the country from outside the borders. It can be 
basically ascertained that this was a case connected with or 
controlled by a hostile organization overseas. The time bombs 
probably came from Japan or Taiwan. This is the most serious 
case of violent destruction found in recent years and has been 
called the "extraordinary 9 March political case." Public 
Security Minister Tao Siju has personally taken charge as the 
leader of the special group responsible for examining the case. 
  In another development in early March, a time bomb was also 
found near Putian City's Dongzhen reservoir in Fujian Province. 
Affected by dampness, the bomb did not explode at the 
prescribed time. According to the Fujian Provincial Public 
Security Department, if the bomb had exploded, the political 
effects would have been greater than the explosion itself. 
  On the early morning of 8 March, a time bomb was found in a 
soapbox at an artillery base near Changsha, Hunan Province. The 
bomb was later detonated by servicemen stationed there. 
  According to a relevant source, the aforesaid time bomb 
incidents are similar in terms of timing and the type of bomb. 
Therefore, the possibility that they were carried out by a 
hostile organization with branches in many parts of the country 
cannot be ruled out.

  [Text] Tokyo, April 17 KYODO -- Japan Red Army members 
living in Pyongyang since their 1970 hijacking of a Japan 
Airlines (JAL) airliner have slammed Tokyo's policies toward 
North Korea's suspected nuclear arms development program. 
  In a letter obtained Saturday [16 April] by KYODO NEWS 
SERVICE, the Red Army members remarked, "As a neighboring 
nation, Japan should not be conspiring with the United States 
but making efforts for dialogue and peace (with North Korea)." 
  The letter indicated that a declaration with the same 
content 
was sent to an influential member of the government's ruling 
coalition. 
  The U.S., along with Seoul and Tokyo, has been urging 
Pyongyang to comply with international nuclear safeguards 
accords and permit inspections of its nuclear facilities 
suspected of being part of an arms development program. 
  The U.S. has lobbied for a U.N. resolution calling for North 
Korea's compliance with the inspections, but at China's urging 
last month, the U.N. Security Council adopted a nonbinding 
presidential statement asking Pyongyang to be more open with its 
program. 
  With discussion about possibly imposing economic sanctions 
on 
North Korea under way in the United Nations, Japanese national 
security authorities suggested the letter was part of a 
propaganda campaign against Japan in connection with last 
Friday's 82nd birthday of North Korean leader Kim Il-song. 
  In 1970, nine Japan Red Army members commandeered a JAL 
Boeing 727, known as "Yodo," to Pyongyang. One of the hijackers 
has since died in North Korea and another was arrested in 1988 
while trying to return to Japan.

  [Text] Mexican attorney Jose Enrique Gonzalez Ruiz and 
U.S. attorneys Peter Erlinder and Leonard Weinglass have been 
hired by the Shining Path [SL] International Emergency Committee 
(CIE) for the Defense of Abimael Guzman's Life, which has 
appeared before the Inter-American Human Rights Committee (CIDH) 
to condemn the Peruvian Government for the way it is treating 
the Maoist leader. 
  Colombian attorney Juan Jose Landinez, who travelled to Lima 
to support the SL efforts to get a group of legislators to visit 
Guzman Reinoso to check his health conditions, has joined the 
group of attorneys. 
  A large group of SL members believes Guzman has either died 
or is in a regrettable psychological state because they do not 
believe he is the author of the letter addressed to President 
Alberto Fujimori, and less still the person who appears on the 
videos asking his supporters to uphold the peace accord. 
  According to the latest "emergency bulletin" issued by the 
CIE, headquartered in London, so far five delegations of jurists 
and activists have arrived in Lima to ask the government and the 
Supreme Court of Military Justice to authorize a visit to Guzman. 
  However, despite the government's opposition, the SL abroad 
continues its efforts: "Other attorneys are ready to travel to 
Lima to continue working until an authorization to visit Guzman 
is granted (and) donations specifically for this juridical 
project are welcome. The (Peruvian) Government will not be left 
in peace on the subject," according to CIE members headed by 
Abimael Guzman's in- laws. 
  Moreover, a "Letter of Protest" that will be sent to 
President Fujimori has been circulated within U.S. intellectual 
and artistic circles. The letterhead reads: "I support the 
world demand that you end the abuse and isolation to which the 
president of the Peruvian Communist Party, Abimael Guzman, is 
subject." 
  As if this were not enough, the CIE has sent a delegation to 
the Philippines and Japan headed by Yuri Kochiyama and Carolyn 
Hadfield. 
  The SL is particularly interested in this visit to Japan 
because in view of the fact that "Fujimori is of Japanese 
descent, the campaigns of slander and lies against Guzman and 
the peoples' war have been very spiteful in the Japanese media. 
Chauvinistically (sic), Fujimori has been adopted as a Japanese 
hero." 
  But they also are concerned over the fact that "since 
Fujimori assumed the presidency, financial ties between Japan 
and Peru have increased. During their visit to Japan, the CIE 
representatives will disclose Japan's true role in Peru." 
  The CIE, in its exhaustive effort, has got the Pakistani 
Human Rights Organization and the Kerala Communist Party of 
India [as published] to also start campaigns in Guzman's favor 
and to send letters of support to the CIDH. 
  As part of the campaign, the SL international branch also is 
distributing a video in English entitled "You Must Tell the 
World," describing the war unleashed against Guzman and his 
supporters. 
  The video includes clips of Guzman's address to the Dincote 
[National Counterterrorism Directorate], actions perpetrated by 
terrorists who infiltrated the Raucana settlement, and 
interviews with attorneys Luis Arce Borja; Guzman's lawyer, 
Alfredo Crespo Baygrac; and the leader of the International 
Revolutionary Movement, MRI, Heriberto Ocasio, who was in Lima 
praising Guzman and his outrageous actions. 
  The only obstacles the SL has found abroad was the Belgian 
Government's decision not to allow Adolfo Olaechea Cahuas to 
enter the country. Olaechea was supposed to attend an event on 
Peru in Brussels organized by the Belgian Anti-Imperialist 
League. 
  Olaechea ended up sending a video recording of his address 
to 
the event in which, for a change, he asserts that the people's 
war will win despite everything. 
  Is that all the Foreign Ministry was able to do? Is it aware 
of the Shining Path propaganda agents' presence in Japan?

  [Text] Lima, 18 Apr (EFE) -- The peace proposal made by 
the Shining Path [SL] on 16 April over a Lima television channel 
has created some confusion and lead to some speculation 
regarding President Alberto Fujimori's relationship with the SL 
leadership, which may end in amnesty for all terrorists. 
  The proposal made by one of the hooded terrorists who 
appears 
on the video sent to several television channels points out the 
need for a peace agreement, under the condition that the 
terrorists suspend their attacks and the government its 
antiterrorist struggle. 
  During the political program "En Directo" 
[Straightforwardly], broadcast on 17 April in the evening, 
journalist Fernando Rospigliosi disclosed that President 
Fujimori on 15 April visited the Yanamayo prison where several 
terrorists, among them Osman Morote, who is the second or third 
highest SL leader, are held under arrest. 
  According to Rospigliosi, Morote, with a smile on his face, 
delivered a gift to the president, but as he could not get it 
through the bars the cell door was opened and Fujimori entered 
it, where he exchanged brief comments with Morote. 
  This year Fujimori also shook hands with SL leader Edmundo 
Cox in the prison where he is being held, and it is said that 
Fujimori sent [Abimael] Guzman a letter on his birthday in 
December, although that information was denied at the time. 
  According to Rospigliosi, these facts "are worrisome" and 
may 
end up with Fujimori, if he runs for reelection in 1995 and 
wins, pardoning the terrorists. 
  However, recently Fujimori asserted that no sentence against 
terrorists, whether they belong to the SL or the Tupac Amaru 
Revolutionary Movement (MRTA), will be reviewed. 
  The fact is that the SL leaders under arrest, since Abimael 
Guzman sent his first two letters to Fujimori in September and 
October 1993 proposing peace, smile and treat the chief of state 
respectfully. 
  There are also versions stating that the terrorists' 
attitude 
is merely a SL maneuver because in truth they continue their 
attacks, headed by Oscar Ramirez (aka Feliciano) and a group of 
women that have not paid heed to Guzman's order to halt acts of 
violence. 
  In the opinion of terrorism expert Carlos Chipoco, the SL 
wants peace because "it is very weak and virtually defeated from 
the military viewpoint." 
  According to the monthly PERU-PAZ, since Guzman was arrested 
on 12 September 1992, the SL "has been incapable of recovering 
its guerrilla action power" it had before the leader was 
arrested. 
  The latest data reveals that during the first quarter of 
1994, 111 people died as a result of political violence compared 
to 573 for the same period in 1993.

  [Text] Subversive activities in Huaraz Province, Ancash 
Department, are about 80 percent under control. Therefore, the 
population that lived in uncertainty and panic for many years

Path is returning to tranquility and security. 
  Commander Jorge Fernandez, chief of the Mechanized Infantry 
Battalion, told EXPRESO that the pacification process in this 
part of the country is in progress through the fulfillment of 
all the plans established by the government to dismantle the 
small Shining Path groups that still are operating in different 
parts of the nation. He added that the Armed Forces -- National 
Police and Army -- were successful in dismantling the different 
Shining Path groups that were operating in the area because of 
the participation of the population that, far from feeling fear, 
reported the subversives and gave information that led to their 
capture. 
  Fernandez added that another factor that led to finding out 
the whereabouts of top Shining Path military leaders was the 
delicate intelligence operation carried out for a long time with 
the participation of highly qualified and trained personnel to 
face any situation. 
  During the last two years, the Army has dealt hard blows to 
subversion. According to statistics, the Army broke up 53 
military and logistical commands operating in different areas, 
mainly in Chiquian and Callejon de los Conchucos, areas that 
were under Shining Path control for many years. 
  Fernandez said: "The cooperation of the population and the 
peasant defense patrols was a key element in breaking up the 
important military commands that were operating in the different 
settlements of Huaraz. And now we are seeing the results." 
  He said that in contrast with other departments in the 
country, in Huaraz only a small group of subversives -- seven 
all together -- decided to abide by the Repentance Law because 
they realized that their so-called "armed struggle" failed after 
the capture of their highest leader, Abimael Guzman Reinoso. 
  He added that the Army is protecting them and is fulfilling 
the orders given by the president through the Repentance Law. 
Many of those who repented have given valuable information that 
contributed to the capture of the main subversive leaders. 
  Regarding the possibility that Shining Path leader Julio 
Cesar Mezzich may be operating in Huaraz, Fernandez said there 
are many reports about his presence in the area but they have 
not been confirmed yet. 
  He did not discard, however, the possibility that Mezzich 
may 
be hiding in the high area of Huaraz under another name, and 
that this is why patrol operations are carried out in all the 
peasant settlements.

    [Editorial Report] The following is a compilation of 
reports on insurgent activities in Peru compiled from Peruvian 
media monitored through 11 April. 
  Alleged members of the Shining Path, SL, maoist group last 
night bombed some high tension pylons. The city of Juliaca, on 
the border with Bolivia, was left in the dark. A Latino Bank 
branch was also bombed causing serious material damage. (Madrid 
EFE in Spanish 1815 GMT 2 Apr 94) 
  A group of 183 Ashaninkas indigenous people who had been 
members of the SL for the past four years, hacked the seven SL 
leaders to death with machetes when they saw a peasant defense 
patrol coming to free them. The incident took place at dawn on 
27 March in Shequireni, on the River Tambo bank, 80 km south of 
Satipo. The terrorists were sleeping when the peasant defense 
patrol surrounded the camp to free the Ashaninkas. (Lima EL 
COMERCIO in Spanish 29 Mar 94 p A11) 
  Two members of the Tupac Amaru Revolutionary Movement 
(MRTA), 
identified as Jorge Enrique Santiago and Juan Lazaro Garcia 
Carranza, were arrested by the police in the Progreso shantytown 
in Chimbote. They were carrying submachine MGP 22480 which 
belonged to a policemen they murdered two years ago. In another 
operation, Monterrey police station personnel arrested Glicerio 
Pedro Ciriaco Pajuelo, 42, who was inciting Tahuantisuyo 
peasants to lynch Agriculture Ministry workers. (Lima EXPRESO in 
Spanish 27 Mar 94) 
  SL members, armed with AKM guns and pistols, are believed to 
have gunned down, on 26 March at point blank range, Mayor 
Gregorio Lecca Franco, 54, of Huaylillas District, La Libertad 
Department, as he was on his way home. (Lima EXPRESO in Spanish 
27 Mar 94 p A24) 
  Colonel Adolfo Unda Rojas, chief of the Political-Military 
Command of the Apurimac Southeastern Security subzone presented 
to the media three new repentant terrorists: Comrades Roberto, 
Luis, Javicho were arrested in Amizo town, South of Apurimac on 
the border with Ayacucho. Their arrest led to the confiscation 
of literature, ammunition, fuses, and explosives in Amizo. (Lima 
EL COMERCIO in Spanish 26 Mar 94 P A11) 
  The Peruvian National Police, PNP, have completely 
dismantled 
the SL Northern Regional Committee, CRN-SL, with the arrest in 
Chiclayo of two of its most important leaders within the 
framework of the Remate-1 operation. The first to be arrested 
was Jose Flavio Gonzalez Perez, aka Pavel, 36, whom the police 
believes heads the Great Unit No. 2 of the CRN-SL. Pavel's 
brother Segundo Salvador Gonzalez Perez, aka Eduardo, 46, was 
also arrested. He leads the Lambayeque Zone Committee and 
CRN-SL Peoples' Aid Committee. Within the same operation the 
police also arrested Nolbel Torres Sanchez, 26, and Salatiel 
Davila Anambal, aka Jose, 41, who are members of the logistic 
support group for the Lambayeque Zone Committee; Luis Antonio 
Guerrero Mestanza, aka Juan, 28, a member of the so-called 
Peoples' Guerrilla Army of the Lambayeque Zone Committee; while 
Karl Lenin Gonzales Rodriguez, aka Antonio, 19, surrendered. 
The six are at the Picsi Jail. Their arrest caused the failure 
of the so-called Second National Congress which the SL was 
preparing in Chiclayo. Colone Marco Miyashiro, head of the PNP 
Counterterrorism Division, said the CRN-SL has reorganized 
itself into the Great Unit No. 1 formed by the La Libertad, 
Cajamarca, and Chimbote zone committees and Great Unit No. 2 
formed by Lambayeque, Piura, Tumbes, and Amazonas zone 
committees. (Lima LA REPUBLICA in Spanish 26 Mar 94) 
  General David Jaime Sobrevilla, head of the 
Political-Military Command of National Security Zone No. 7, 
today disclosed that in less than a year some 2,000 Ashaninkas 
indigenous people from Satipo Province have been rescued from 
the hands of terrorists and have returned to their villages to 
work. (Lima EL COMERCIO in Spanish 30 Mar 94 p A14)

  [Excerpt] Lima, 12 Apr (EFE) [date as received] -- The 
Peruvian press reported on 13 April that the arrest of "Red 
Path" terrorist group leader Oscar Ramirez Durand, alias 
"Comrade Feliciano," is imminent. 
  According to the newspaper EXPRESO, National 
Counterterrorism 
Directorate (Dincote) agents on 11 April found a trail leading 
to "Feliciano" when they raided a house in Lima's Callao Port 
where Red Path leaders held meetings. 
  Five people were arrested in the raid and in addition 
Dincote 
agents seized guns and propaganda implicating the so-called Red 
Path "Central Committee" and the "Lima Metropolitan Committee" 
headed by Ramirez Durand. 
  EXPRESO reported that according to a Dincote spokesperson, 
it 
is known that Feliciano is in Lima with some of his main 
lieutenants and that Dincote is following his footsteps. 
  In the last two weeks, Dincote has arrested in Lima more 
than 
20 Red Path terrorists, some of whom, it seems, have supplied 
information that will lead to the arrest of their main leaders.

relay] 
  [Text] Disip [Directorate of Intelligence and Prevention 
Services] members arrived at San Martin Avenue at 0910 [1310 
GMT] this Tuesday to defuse an alleged explosive found near a 
Banco Latino automatic teller machine. Well-protected members 
of the Disip Explosive Division are proceeding to defuse the 
pipe bomb. An official is signaling that the situation is under 
control. 
  As you can see, people were ordered out of the building to 
avoid any possible mishap. 
  Disip officials picked up a polyethylene bag -- apparently 
containing an explosive device -- and put it inside this truck 
to transport it to a location where it can be detonated. 
Members of the Special Action Brigade of the Judicial Technical 
Police [PTJ] and officials of the Disip Explosive Division 
arrived at the location to take pictures of the pipe bomb before 
it was detonated. 
  As you can see, all security measures are being taken to 
carry out this operation. Additionally, vehicle traffic in the 
area was stopped to prevent injury to people near the explosion 
site. We expect the detonation of the pipe bomb found at Banco 
Latino any minute. [loud explosion heard in background] 
  Vehicle traffic was finally resumed, and Disip officials 
departed the area. The Disip and PTJ will investigate this 
situation to determine who planted this explosive at Banco 
Latino in San Martin.

  [Text] Caracas, 12 Apr (DPA) -- Several Banco Latino 
branches in Caracas were the targets of low-intensity explosions 
this morning which resulted in property damage only. Banco 
Latino was taken over by the Venezuelan state in mid-January for 
a lack of liquidity, thus giving rise to the worst financial 
crisis in the country's history. The bank reopened its doors 
last week. 
  A homemade explosive device exploded at the Banco Latino 
branch in Quinta Crespo (southwestern part of the Venezuelan 
capital) at 0520, causing only slight property damage. Police 
found and defused another device placed inside a gasoline 
container at another nearby Banco Latino branch. Banco Latino's 
main office has received several phone calls throughout the day 
warning of possible explosions. 
  Banco Latino press department spokesmen reported about an 
attack on one of the bank's branches in Altamira (eastern 
Caracas), the windows of which were all shattered. 
  So far only one person has been arrested. Interior Minister 
Ramon Escovar Salom said he will wait to see the police reports 
before issuing his position

  [Excerpts] The Popular Front for the Liberation of 
Palestine-General Command [PFLP-GC] has escorted to their final 
resting place the martyrs of the heroic al-'Ayshiyah battle, 
which the front's fedayeen carried out against the Zionist enemy 
forces and their agents in southern Lebanon. These heroic 
martyrs fell after they killed more than 15 of the 
American-Zionist enemy troops and their agents in a direct 
battle that came in response to the Ibrahimi Mosque massacre. 
Having carried out their combat mission, our heroes were 
targeted by enemy artillery and air raids while they were 
returning to their bases. Other members of the group managed to 
return safely to base. 
  Heroic martyr Khalid Muhmmad Hilal, also known as Abu-Sakhr; 
heroic martyr Muhammad Mahmud al-Nu'aymi, also known as 
Abu-Iskandar 'Umar; and heroic martyr Ahmad Nasr Ibrahim, also 
known as Abu-Iskandar Ahmad, were laid to rest at the Martyrs 
Cemetery at the al-Yarmuk Camp [near Damascus] this afternoon. 
The funeral procession was led by Ahmad Jibril, PFLP-GC 
secretary general; Talal Naji, PFLP-GC assistant secretary 
general; Fadl Shururu, secretary of the PFLP-GC Political 
Bureau; and 'Umar al-Shihabi, member of the PFLP-GC Political 
Bureau. Also leading the funeral were a number of 
representatives of the Alliance of Palestinian Forces, the 
martyrs' relatives, a number of the PFLP-GC Central Committee 
members, and a large crowd of the masses of our Palestinian and 
Syrian Arab people. [passage omitted] 
  Meanwhile, in a funeral unprecedented since 1982, the body 
of 
the heroic martyr `Awni Muhammad Manna', also known as 
Abu-Nasir, the commander of the heroic al-'Ayshiyah operation, 
was laid to rest at the 'Ayn al-Hulwah camp following the noon 
prayers yesterday, Monday. [passage omitted] 
  Our correspondent in southern Lebanon reports that in an 
attempt to disrupt the funeral, members of the 'Arafat clique 
assassinated a member of their own clique. However, this did 
not prevent the masses of our people from continuing 
participation in the funeral of heroic martyr Abu-Nasir.

<F P=106> [Muhammad Bishkar dispatch from Beirut] </F>
  [Text] Hamas [Islamic Resistance Movement], which has 
claimed responsibility for the attack on a Zionist bus in the 
Hadera area north of Tel Aviv today in which six Zionists were 
killed and 30 others were injured, has announced that this is 
the second in a series of operations it has decided to carry out 
against the Zionists in response to the massacre at the 
al-Ibrahimi Mosque. 
  Muhammad Nazzal, Hamas official in Amman, told us in a 
telephone conversation a short while ago that Hamas has decided 
to carry out five military operations against the occupation 
troops and Zionist settlers in response to the Hebron massacre. 
The Hadera operation today is the second in this series and 
comes one week after the suicide operation in 'Afula in northern 
Palestine, where eight Zionists were killed and 52 others were 
wounded. Nazzal stressed that the operations against the 
Zionist settlers are legitimate because they shoot Palestinians 
for no reason. 
  [Begin Nazzal recording] These settlers were, still are, and 
will remain a dagger in the Palestinian territory and they must 
be evacuated from this land, to which they have come from all 
over the world. We believe that these settlers do what they are 
doing in collusion with the Israeli Army and with the protection 
of the Israeli authorities. [end recording]

  [Text] Prime Minister Yitzhaq Rabin demands that Jordan 
put an end to the activities of the Hamas [Islamic Resistance 
Movement] office in Amman. Speaking to reporters on 
Independence Day, Rabin said that the Amman office is closely 
linked with the terrorist acts of Hamas in Israel, and that 
Israel holds the Jordanian Government responsible for anything 
that happens on Jordanian soil: 
  [Begin Rabin recording] Whoever watched closely the reaction 
and the action of the Hamas after carrying two murderous attacks 
in 'Afula and Hadera on peaceful Israeli people, could not but 
realize that all the spokesmanship, all the statements to the 
whole world came from the office of Hamas in Amman, headed by 
Muhammad Nazzal, that almost every day appears on television and 
other means of the media. We are fully aware that today the 
Hamas focal center of assistance to the Palestinians, to the 
Hamas, among the Palestinians in the territories, expresses 
every statement about murderous activities, threatens how many 
more, everything is done from the office of the Hamas in Amman. 
[sentence as heard] 
  Without elaborating we believe there are other lines of 
communication and assistance between this center of Hamas in 
Amman and the activities of Hamas in the territories and attacks 
on targets in Israel. We have good relations in practical terms 
with Jordan along the border. We are interested in the 
continuation of the peace negotiations with Jordan, but Israel 
cannot tolerate the continuation of Amman being a paradise for 
the activities of the Hamas from Amman. Therefore we would like 
to make it clear to the Government of Jordan, that we see this 
government responsible to whatever happens on its sovereign 
soil, and we would like to make it clear that this situation 
cannot continue. It's the responsibility of the Government of 
Jordan on one hand to continue the peace negotiations that we 
are interested in, and at the same time to prevent that the 
Hamas will have freedom of activities in Amman, in speaking, 
expressing the Hamas policies, issuing all the statements, and 
threatens what will happen in the future. [end recording] 
  [Jerusalem Qol Yisra'el in Hebrew at 0405 GMT on 15 April, 
reporting on Rabin's and Foreign Minister Peres' news conference 
on Hamas activity from Jordan, carries a passage in which Peres 
is recorded as saying: "I have never encountered a case in which 
a country purportedly striving toward peace allows a 
representative of a murderous organization to publicly assume 
responsibility for two murderous attacks and announce its 
intention to carry out three more such attacks. He said this 
openly on television without any reaction, as though it is a 
natural thing. We know that Jordan is exerting efforts to guard 
the border, but there is another border which must be seen to: 
the border of murder and terrorism. We regard this message with 
all possible seriousness and firmness -- it takes precedence 
over everything else. I, like the prime minister, hope that 
Jordan implements all the necessary measures as soon as 
possible."] 
  Our diplomatic reporter Jack Katzenell points out that 
Israel 
has issued similar warnings to Jordan several times in recent 
years following cross-border raids by terrorists, usually 
Islamic fundamentalists. It's always been Israel's position 
that Jordan is responsible for anything that happens on or from 
its soil. However, Israel has never taken military action 
against Jordan in the wake of these warnings. When the Likud 
government was in power such action was demanded repeatedly by 
one of the most prominent figures in Prime Minister Shamir's 
party, Ari'el Sharon, but Shamir pointedly ignored Sharon's 
demands.

<F P=106> [Report by JORDAN TIMES staff reporter Nirmin Murad] </F>
  [Text] Amman -- Jordanian authorities have withdrawn the 
passports of Hamas representative in Jordan Muhammad Nazzal and 
Hamas spokesman Ibrahim Ghawshah, pending their decision on 
whether to comply with Jordanian regulations. 
  Official sources said the two men were summoned by the 
authorities and asked to "decide whether they are Palestinian -- 
in which case they would be given a temporary two-year passport 
given to residents of the occupied territories, or they are 
Jordanian citizens who comply with Jordanian laws." 
  The sources said the two were also asked to refrain from 
making any statements claiming responsibility for attacks in the 
occupied territories. 
  A senior Jordanian official told the Jordan Times that the 
government had intended to curb the activities of Hamas in 
Jordan without much publicity but was pressured to publicise 
these measures after Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhaq Rabin issued 
a warning to Jordan charging that it was helping Hamas. 
  "We had already instructed the minister of interior to deal 
with the issue before Rabin had his press conference," the 
senior official said. 
  Hamas representatives were not available for comment Monday, 
but the movement issued a statement charging that Mr. Rabin was 
"creating fictitious conflicts to cover up for his political 
failure." 
  "The prime minister of the enemy Yitzhaq Rabin has issued a 
warning to Jordanin which he claimed that there is a leadership 
for Hamas on its territory and demanding that the Jordanian 
government take action against its activities," the statement 
responded. 
  "It is a failed attempt to use the confirmation by the Hamas 
representatives in Amman of 'Izz-al-Din al-Qassam's Brigades' 
claim of responsibility for the heroic acts in 'Afula and 
Hadera," the statement said. 
  "Rabin and his government know very well that the 
al-Qassam's 
Brigades conduct, plan and execute their activities from the 
occupied territories," the statement said, adding that "his 
failure to put an end to these attacks, and the revealing of his 
deception in the settlement process has caused him to use these 
attacks to issue a warning to Jordan." 
  Hamas said that Mr. Rabin needed to warn Jordan to achieve 
the following objectives: 
  -- Direct attention away from the failure of his security 
measures and his oppressive measures in putting an end to the 
heroic attacks by the al-Qassam Brigades. 
  -- Use the "American sword" to pressure Jordan towards 
signing a unilateral agreement with his government similar to 
the one signed in Oslo, and this warning falls in line with the 
policy of the U.S. administration which uses the naval blockade 
on al-'Aqabah as a way to pressure Jordan for the same purpose. 
  Despite the strong language against Israel and Mr. Rabin's 
government, the Hamas statement appeared to set a precedent in 
opening the door for bargaining with Israel. 
  Stressing that the attacks against Israeli civilians were in 
retaliation against the Hebron massacre of Palestinian 
worshippers, Hamas said that this was not a policy but the 
"exception." 
  "Hamas is ready to reconsider this exception on the 
condition 
that the enemy's prime minister, his government and his army 
halt completely all killings of unarmed civilians from our 
people," the statement said. 
  "We are not against peace," the statement added," but the 
peace offered by the government of the enemy is not peace but a 
consolidation of occupation and the injustice falling on our 
people." 
  "While we in Hamas know well that the Oslo agreement is 
nothing but humiliating surrender from the PLO... we think that 
the right beginning would be on the following foundations," the 
statement added. 
  Hamas demanded the "full Israeli withdrawal from our 
Palestinian land and dismantling and removal of all settlements, 
the holding of full and free elections in the West Bank and Gaza 
to select the representatives of our people and their 
leadership." 
  "The chosen leadership will be the one that represents the 
aspirations and hopes of our people and will decide on the 
ensuing steps," the statement concluded in what most analysts 
termed as an indication that Hamas was proposing itself as an 
alternative leadership to the Palestine Liberation Organisation, 
through the results of the elections and by deduction the side 
to conduct negotiations with Israel.

<F P=106> [Report by Tzvi Bar'el] </F>
  [Text] The Hamas [Islamic Resistance Movement] office in 
Jordan continues functioning regularly, despite reports and 
announcements that it had been closed. Office workers come to 
work, answer phones, and operate the office as before. In a 
telephone conversation with the Hamas office, Muhammad Nazzal, 
head of the movement, said that the office exists and is 
operational, "but unfortunately, I cannot make comments to your 
newspaper because it is our policy not to speak with Israeli 
elements." 
  Jordanian sources in Amman have reported that the king's 
decision regarding Hamas has remained unchanged but, as far as 
they know, no practical steps to restrict the movement's 
activity have been taken so far. According to them, the heads 
of the movement were summoned for a discussion with the heads of 
the Jordanian intelligence who asked that Hamas media activity 
be reduced.

<F P=106> [Telephone Interview with Dr. Musa Abu-Marzuq, head of the </F>
Political Bureau of Hamas, the Islamic Resistance Movement, "who 
is residing in Damascus," by Samaih al-Ma'ayitah] 
  [Text] Al-Ma'ayitah: What has prompted the 
Zionist leadership to launch these threats against Jordan and 
Hamas? 
  Abu-Marzuq: It is the Movement's basic and strong 
presence among the Palestinian people. The Movement's cadres 
and organizations are in the occupied territories. The presence 
outside these territories is natural, be it in the form of 
supporters, spokesmen, or official spokesmen in the Movement's 
name. It has political and information presence in most states 
of the region. However, as a result of his failure to suppress 
or confront the Movement or stop its armed operations, Rabin 
tried to hold external sides responsible for these actions so 
that the Israelis would not have great room for criticizing his 
policies and exposing his shortcomings and his inability to 
provide peace and security for them. 
  This is not the first time that Rabin has shifted the 
responsibility for his policies on to outside parties. When the 
soldier Toledano was kidnapped, Israel accused the United States 
of sponsoring Hamas leaders and accused Syria of sponsoring the 
Movement. Now it is directing these false accusations against 
Jordan. I must express my astonishment because the U.S. 
Administration supports these allegations and accusations while 
knowing that they are incorrect. The United States responded to 
Israeli's accusations in early 1993 denying the presence of any 
Hamas leaders on its territory and proved that the Movement's 
military operations are planned and executed inside Palestine. 
Here we must emphasize the following: 
  1. The Hamas Movement has confined its battle in Palestine 
as an occupied territory and we have the right to resist with 
all means available to us. The Movement has been committed to 
this. 
  2. Rabin's accusations reveal the enemy's inability to 
confront Hamas and its attempt to instigate our brothers against 
it. 
  3. The 'Izz-al-Din al-Qassam battalions have always 
announced their responsibility for their operations inside 
Palestine by various means, such as leaving a leaflet at the 
site of the battle, announcing the operation by graffiti or 
through a loudspeaker, contacting news agencies, or distributing 
leaflets bearing the signature of the battalions. As for 
statements by its representatives abroad, they are merely 
comments and affirmations of the Movement's methods. This also 
happened after the recent operation. 
  Al-Ma'ayitah: What is happening demonstrates the 
state of confusion in the Zionist enemy leadership. They cannot 
find a place or a Hamas group to retaliate against as they do in 
Lebanon against the Lebanese and Palestinian resistance. It is 
also a continuation of the series of pressures against Jordan to 
compel it to sign a separate peace agreement. 
  Abu-Marzuq: Israel does not know where to strike 
at Hamas within its policy of deterrence. The Hamas Movement 
and military apparatus are in Palestine. They directed several 
blows at it in 1989, in late 1990, and in 1993 and were unable 
to limit the Movement's military activities. This created a 
crisis in the Zionist entity and this prompted it to choose 
Jordan as a means to shift responsibility to it. It is worth 
noticing that for the first time, Rabin and his Foreign 
Minister, Peres, appeared at press conference at the same time. 
Rabin's words were very strong in his capacity as minister of 
defense and interior, something which only made his failure 
worse. Peres' expressions were calmer because he knows that 
these threats are part of the political game. 
  Al-Ma'ayitah: There are attempts to raise 
Jordanian fears concerning the seriousness of Hamas activity in 
the Jordanian arena. Some people try to substantiate these 
fears by citing the history of Jordan's relationship with PLO 
factions. Are these fears likely to materialize with regard to 
the Hamas Movement? 
  Abu-Marzuq: We believe that the security and 
stability of any Arab country, particularly Jordan, plays a role 
in supporting Palestinian rights. On the other hand, 
destabilizing any Arab country will have a negative effect on 
the Palestinian cause. We have seen this repeatedly and the 
result was that Arab weakness has adversely affected the 
Palestine question. 
  We are aware that Jordan is facing difficult circumstances 
and many pressures which we understand. We also assert that 
Jordan's position on the reckless Zionist threats was 
distinguished and deserves thanking. 
  We, from a position of responsibility, will not give our 
enemy an excuse to fish in troubled water and will adopt 
appropriate measures and steps in this connection to safeguard 
Jordan's security and stability. 
  We do not carry out military action from outside. As for the 
statements that talk about the five revenge operations, they 
were contained in statements issued by the ['Izz-al-Din] 
al-Qassam Battalions in Palestine. Other statements only 
reiterated this. 
  We think that there are no grounds whatsoever for these 
fears 
because we are concerned about Jordanian cohesion and the 
security and stability of this country. 
  Al-Ma'ayitah: Do you feel that Jordan understands 
this position? 
  Abu-Marzuq: The Jordanian Government is certain 
that the credibility of the Hamas movement is high and it has 
never felt anything that contravenes this policy. It knows for 
sure that the official spokesman or the Movement's 
representative in Jordan have no connection with any action 
inside Palestine. They know, and everybody else knows, that the 
Movement and its military presence as a whole are inside 
Palestine. Therefore, Jordan is in a strong position to reject 
these threats because it stems from its sincere stand and actual 
practice. Therefore, I think that the Jordanian Government 
understands the Movement's position. 
  Al-Ma'ayitah: Is the Movement going to adopt any 
measures in light of the Zionists' threats Zionists to Jordan? 
  Abu-Marzuq: Basically, we will not allow any 
justifications for the enemy to fish in troubled water. This is 
in addition to some measures that have to do with the Movement 
itself, which we are going to take into consideration in the 
future, God willing, so as not to embarrass Jordan in these 
difficult circumstances. 
  Al-Ma'ayitah: How do you view Jordan's position 
on the recent threats? 
  Abu-Marzuq: I think that Jordan's reply to 
Israeli threats was strong and characterized by frankness and 
objectivity. The Movement had no official offices to begin 
with. The government officially deals with the PLO. Jordan has 
not dealt with us as representatives of the Palestinian people, 
and we have not claimed to be so. We represent part of the 
Palestinian people, but we do not recognize PLO representation 
of all the Palestinian people. Jordan's position was open and 
objective and it reflects actual reality. 
  Al-Ma'ayitah: Given the international, Arab, and 
Palestinian situation, it seems that Hamas is approaching a 
fierce war with the Zionist enemy and its allies, particularly 
in the PLO leadership. It stands alone in confronting the 
Zionist enemy militarily at a time when the rest of the 10 
factions opposing the current settlement process are 
unjustifiably absent. The question is how will Hamas confront 
this fierce war? 
  Abu-Marzuq: We realize that since the first 
setback [the 1948 Arab-Israeli war], the Palestinian people have 
been facing successive plots and making large sacrifices. The 
Hamas Movement is part of these people and derives its strength 
-- after depending on Almighty God -- from the people's resolve 
to continue their jihad until they attain their hopes and 
aspirations and regain their land. We are aware of the 
seriousness of the next stage and it is the same seriousness the 
Palestinian people faced at various historical stages in 
Palestine and elsewhere. 
  What is new in this regard is that part of the Palestinian 
people chose another path for reasons with which we differ. 
These differences, however, will not affect the Palestinian 
people's resistance of occupation. I believe that the current 
attempts to resolve the conflict will not be successful because 
they neither deal with the crux of the issue nor remove the 
causes of the conflict. This means the conflict will continue. 
We will not transfer the conflict to the Palestinian arena and 
will continue to deal with this conflict as sons of the 
Palestinian people regardless of differences in opinion. We 
hope they will deal with the Palestinian arena in the same way. 
The Movement will continue its jihad. We, like them, are 
suffering from oppression and imprisonment and we will continue 
to make sacrifices and pay the price of freedom. 
  Al-Ma'ayitah: Following the implementation of the 
full or partial autonomy, two facts will emerge: Resistance of 
occupation, which will be pursued by Hamas, and the autonomy 
institutions and the Palestinian people's living aspects. How 
will Hamas coexist with these institutions and the living and 
servicing aspects? 
  Abu-Marzuq: We are part of the Palestinian people 
and cannot ignore their interests and causes, which we will 
continue to defend. We will also continue to be an active 
element in all areas of life, including education, economy, and 
services, whether inside or outside the framework of autonomy. 
  As for the political issue, that is, the administrative 
autonomy and normalization, we will certainly not deal with them 
positively. We will not participate in building the institutions 
that do not serve the Palestinian people unless these 
institutions go beyond the designated framework and begin to 
express the Palestinian people's ambitions. The Movement can 
then live up to the stage and serve the Palestinian people 
through the same framework. We will then not create many 
difficulties for those administrations and will be careful to 
direct our efforts toward fighting the enemy. 
  Al-Ma'ayitah: Even if the autonomy institutions 
dealt with Hamas as an illegal and outlawed organization? 
  Abu-Marzuq: I think it is difficult for the 
autonomy institutions to do so. We are part of the Palestinian 
people, not a simple part which can be chased. Consequently, it 
will be difficult for them to take such a step and I do not 
think they will make such a reckless decision. 
  Al-Ma'ayitah: The Political Bureau of Hamas issued 
a political statement in which a paragraph reads: "Any peace in 
the region must be based on Israeli withdrawal from the occupied 
territories and holding free elections in the West Bank and Gaza 
Strip to elect representatives of the Palestinian people who 
will decide the next steps and the future of the [Palestine] 
question." Does this mean that developing the present formula of 
the settlement will win the approval of the Hamas Movement? 
  Abu-Marzuq: As a resistance movement, we think 
that if the enemy government wants to end the ordeal it is 
experiencing, then this cannot take place by imposing surrender 
on the Palestinian people. What we are saying is that there 
could be a peace treaty or a truce in order to rescue the region 
from its complex situation and end this crisis. 
  The resolutions of international legitimacy have considered 
the West Bank, the Gaza Strip, and Jerusalem occupied 
territories owned by the Palestinian people who live on these 
territories. If they want the resistance to stop this very 
minute, then what is required: 
  1. The withdrawal of the Zionist forces from the West Bank, 
the Gaza Strip, and Jerusalem. 
  2. The dismantling of the settlements. 
  3. Compensation for the losses and victims as a result of 
the 
occupation. 
  4. Holding free elections so that the Palestinian people 
will 
elect a leadership that will express the aspirations of the 
Palestinian people and the future of the conflict. If the 
Movement gets elected, then it has its own clear stand toward 
the conflict. However, if it wins a minority of votes, then it 
will express its views freely and we will respect the opinion of 
the elected majority. 
  What we are offering is a way out of the current 
predicament. 
The PLO is negotiating with the Zionist enemy on foundations 
which we do not think are correct. The party that has a right 
to present views regarding the future of the conflict must be an 
elected leadership that represents the Palestinian people. 
  We do not mind seeing the West Bank, Gaza Strip, and 
Jerusalem under the supervision of international troops, 
Palestinian police, or the Arab administrations which had 
previous control over these territories or of which these 
territories were a part before the 1967 aggression. 
  Al-Ma'ayitah: Is this a political initiative? 
  Abu-Marzuq: You can call it this way if you like. 
You can also say this is the Movement's vision to end the 
predicament, if you like. 
  Al-Ma'ayitah: "The killing of civilians" is 
rejected internationally. Why did Hamas do this in the 'Afula 
and Hadera operations? 
  Abu-Marzuq: Over the past years, the al-Qassam 
Battalions have been committed to their right to resisting the 
occupation troops and the settler militias, and they have never 
violated this rule. However, the occupation troops have been 
killing our children, women, and old men. Also, the occupation 
troops do not stop the inhuman practices of the settlers, whose 
peak was the killing of dozens of people at the Ibrahimi Mosque. 
This crime was not enough for them. A series of other crimes 
followed in the same city, and curfew was imposed on the victim. 
The occupation troops also let the criminal wolves free in the 
land and gave them a free hand to kill the sons of our people, 
to the extent that they did not spare a woman in her third month 
of pregnancy and the baby which she was trying to protect. This 
is in addition to shooting schoolchildren in Bethlehem, injuring 
nine of them. 
  All of this has prompted the Battalions to treat the enemy 
the same way, and this is approved by international law and 
divine law until the troops and settlers stop killing the 
unarmed sons of our people. Then, the Battalions will go back 
to their policy of resisting the occupation.

  [Text] The security forces this morning arrested about 50 
Hamas [Islamic Resistance Movement] and Islamic Jihad activists 
from Gaza city, Rafah, and the Jabalyah refugee camp. The 
arrests follow an earlier sweep over the weekend, when more than 
50 Hamas activists were also arrested. 
  [A report by military correspondent Yariv Ben-Yehuda on Tel 
Aviv IDF Radio in Hebrew at 1000 GMT on 19 April adds: "It 
appears that 10 of those arrested are former deportees who 
returned to the Gaza Strip from southern Lebanon a few months 
ago. Tension in the Strip is high since the arrests were 
carried out. Arab sources warned today that retaliatory terror 
attacks by Hamas are to be expected in the wake of the arrests 
which, according to them, seriously harmed the organization."] 
  Dr. Mahmud al-Zahhar, one of the Hamas deportees who 
returned 
from south Lebanon and acts as a spokesman for Hamas in the 
Strip, denied the people arrested were senior activists. 
Speaking to reporter Mark Weiss, al-Zahhar also puts the number 
of those arrested at up to 200: [begin recording] 
  Al-Zahhar: The number, up to last night, ranged 
from 150 up to 200, and the people who were arrested are not 
activists. They were previously under detention or sentences. 
I think there is no reason for any arrest for any of them 
because they are well known as Islamic people. They have no 
participation in the process carried on in the area. 
  Weiss: Do you think this is an Israeli crackdown 
following the 'Afula and Hadera bombings? 
  Al-Zahhar: Do you think the people who were 
arrested in the Gaza Strip are involved in what happened in 
'Afula and Hadera? 
  Weiss: An interview was published in Jordan this 
morning from Musa Abu-Marzuq, the head of the Hamas politburo, 
and he said that Hamas may be willing to make peace with Israel 
if Israel pulls out of the occupied territories and dismantles 
the settlements. Do you see this as a change in Hamas policy? 
  Al-Zahhar: I actually until now did not read the 
statements thoroughly, and after its discussion, I think after 
that I will be ready to give my personal idea. 
  Weiss: Would you support peace with Israel if 
they withdrew from the territories and pulled out of the 
settlements? 
  Al-Zahhar: This actually should be thoroughly 
studied, because about what we are going to negotiate? What 
will be the relation of the occupied territories, and what will 
be the contradiction between this implementation of policy with 
the Cairo and Oslo agreements? So, what type of peace Israel 
are going to give? If they are ready to give a genuine peace, a 
permanent peace, a justice peace, I think nobody will refuse.

<F P=106> [Interview with Moussa Kraouche, spokesman of the Algerian </F>
Fraternity in France, by Ivan Rioufol; place and date not given: 
"Low Profile for Islamists in France" -- first paragraph is LE 
FIGARO introduction] 
  [Text] Moussa Kraouche, 34 years old, is the spokesman for 
the Algerian Fraternity in France (FAF), an association which 
has close ties with the Islamic Salvation Front (FIS). He 
denies that his organization is involved in any way, either 
directly or indirectly, with the secret terrorist network 
attributed to the FIS, which was recently broken up in Lille. 
Moussa Kraouche had been called in for questioning and detained 
during the round-up of Islamists last November. The police 
maintained that, in his home, they had found documents 
originating, in particular, from the Armed Islamic Group (GIA). 
However, as a result of the dubious origin of one of these 
documents, it was impossible to establish any links between the 
FAF and the GIA . 
  Rioufol: Do you know the two suspected FIS 
sympathizers who were arrested in Lille? 
  Kraouche: No. However, it is too early to say 
whether or not they are members of the FIS. I cannot help 
noticing that, depending on what suits the media, either all 
Algerians belong to the FIS or the FIS is portrayed as a 
minority group. There is no evidence to support the allegation 
that these two persons are even FIS sympathizers. If ever that 
proved to be the case, then they would have to answer to the 
legal authorities for their acts. 
  Rioufol: The FIS is accused of running secret 
terrorist networks in France... 
  Kraouche: I officially refute such a claim, which 
was merely made to frighten public opinion! We condemn any 
illegal action undertaken on French soil or elsewhere. The line 
followed by the Algerian Fraternity in France is one that is 
governed by legality. 
  Rioufol: That may be, but the Algerian Fraternity 
in France has very close links with the FIS... 
  Kraouche: Admittedly, we do sympathize with the 
aims of the FIS, which is an organization that is not officially 
recognized in France. 
  Rioufol: But the FIS has been directly implicated 
in terrorist attacks committed in Algeria. 
  Kraouche: You cannot describe them as terrorist 
actions! Terrorism merely exists when perpetrated against a 
legitimate state. In Algeria, it is popular resistance which is 
mounting against an illegitimate, illegal military dictatorship. 
No terrorist actions are being committed in Algeria. 
  Rioufol: How can you say that? Only recently, 
two young girls were killed because they were not wearing the 
Muslim veil. 
  Kraouche: Two veiled young girls were also 
killed. In any event, these acts have nothing to do with the 
Islamists. People are not killed for not wearing a veil. 
Furthermore, the Koran preaches: "No religious constraint." We 
are against the murder of innocent people or foreigners in 
Algeria. Not everything can be blamed on the FIS! It is 
provocation! 
  Rioufol: Are you trying to tell us that these 
acts are provocations perpetrated by the present government? 
  Kraouche: Most certainly! The military security 
forces play a very important role there. They have released 
10,000 prisoners convicted under common law so that they can 
incarcerate Islamists. The people they released are individuals 
who are prepared to commit criminal acts. The violence in 
Algeria is not the work of Islamists, but of the junta and those 
who support it, like Said Sadi. That is a very serious matter. 
  Rioufol: Do you support what is currently 
happening in Algeria? 
  Kraouche: Not everything, no. I support the 
legal struggle by the Algerian people to regain their dignity 
and victory, which was snatched away from them during the last 
general election. 
  Rioufol: Do you have links with the Armed Islamic 
Group? 
  Kraouche: We have no links with the GIA, nor with 
any other armed group. In France we are a legal association 
with the specific mission to inform people about what is going 
on. Our objective is to disclose the repression under which the 
Algerian people is suffering. 
  Rioufol: If the FIS comes to power in Algeria, do 
you think there is reason to fear a clash within the Muslim 
community living in France? 
  Kraouche: The Muslim community in France wants 
there to be a rapid solution that could stop the bloodshed. If 
the FIS comes to power tomorrow, then we can assure you that 
everything will proceed peacefully. There is no cause for 
concern. It is the differences existing within Algerian society 
that lend it its richness. 
  Rioufol: Soothing words, but at the moment a very 
large number of Algerian intellectuals are leaving their 
homeland where they are being physically threatened... 
  Kraouche: It is not soothing. In Algeria the 
military junta has constantly repressed the people.

  [Text] A statement by the security services today said that 
on the basis of information, a terrorist network involved in an 
attempt to sabotage El Hadjar [steel] complex has been 
disbanded. The information led to the siege of a bakery in 
Guemar, the province of El Oued, the killing of four terrorists, 
the arrest of another six, and the seizure of a quantity of arms. 
  Investigations led to the arrest of 29 people in (Oued Souf) 
and 14 in Annaba, and the killing of 14 terrorists in a hideout 
in (Oued El Annab) and two terrorists in (Djebel Gamgam) in the 
province of Tebessa, where five gendarmes were killed in an 
exchange of fire. This terrorist network was composed of people 
from Guemar and Oued Souf. Some of them were lying in wait at 
El Hadjar complex and had started to execute a plan to 
assassinate members of the security and sabotagie El Hadjar 
complex. This group was active under the leadership of the 
so-called (Basi Taher) who is a baker in the Guemar municipality.

<F P=106> [Report by 'Abd-al-Rahim 'Ali] </F>
  [Text] Forty-five armed units from Tanta, al-Mansurah, and 
Alexandria and 16 armored vehicles have arrived in Asyut and six 
vehicles have arrived in al-Minya to strengthen the security 
measures against the escalation of the Islamic groups' 
activities in the two governorates. 
  In the first armed confrontation between the people and 
terrorism, the inhabitants of Manfalut exchanged fire with three 
terrorists who were on their way to hiding on al-Ma'abidah 
Island. The three terrorists -- Khalid Quraysh, Muhammad 
'Abd-al-'Al, and Sahsah al-Manfaluti -- were killed. 
  In the ongoing struggle between the governor, the security 
organ, and the popular leaderships in the governorate, the 
latter are saying that the security organ has set up vigilante 
[al-matarid] groups and armed them with modern weapons to chase 
and kill the terrorists. They added that the Manfalut operation 
was the first one carried out by these groups. 
  The Islamic Group in al-Minya last Sunday distributed its 
first statement in four years. Masked youngsters carrying 
swords and axes distributed the statement which declared an end 
to the truce agreed on by the Islamic Group and the security 
forces. AL-AHALI had published on 26 December 1993 the 
agreement between the Islamic Group and the security organ in 
al-Minya and Suhaj. Sunday's statement warned that the Islamic 
Group will resume the struggle.

<F P=106> [Interview with Major General Samih al-Sa'id, Asyut </F>
Governor, by Sami Fahmi in Asyut; date not given] 
  [Excerpts] [Passage omitted] 
  Fahmi: What is the reason for the rising wave of 
terrorism in Asyut? 
  Al-Sa'id: The tightening security fist in Asyut 
and the tightening noose around the terrorists have led the 
latter to resort to desperate terrorist operations. What is 
happening in Asyut is similar to swatting a "wasp's nest," when 
the wasps get irritated they will try anything. Everyone should 
know that Asyut is now different than it used to be. The 
Islamic groups do not hold activities in al-Rahmah Mosque, not 
even weekly seminars. Extremist activities have been brought 
under control. There are no longer marches like the ones that 
were staged during the Night of Revelation or during the nights 
that mark the first day of each Hegira month. 
  Fahmi: Does this mean that the security forces 
start "the action?" 
  Al-Sa'id: The security organ is in control of the 
situation. I do not know what you mean by the word "action." 
  Fahmi: I mean the security organ takes the 
initiative by raiding the extremists and the terrorist moves are 
merely a "reaction." 
  Al-Sa'id: What the terrorists are now doing is the 
result of their bankruptcy. 
  Fahmi: How do you explain the calm in the 
governorates neighboring Asyut (al-Minya, Suhaj) and the 
inflamed situation in Asyut? 
  Al-Sa'id: There are historic factors to consider. 
We cannot ignore the fact that the Islamic groups were first 
formed in Asyut University in the late 1970's and this helped 
them spread. There are also differences between the Islamic 
groups. Some of the terrorist elements that are carrying out 
terrorist acts in Asyut come from Suhaj, al-Wadi al-Jadid, and 
al-Minya. 
  Fahmi: What helped the Islamic groups spread in 
the 1970's, as you mentioned? Was there official support? 
  Al-Sa'id: I cannot answer because I was abroad at 
the time. 
  Fahmi: Are the security organs, with their present 
resources and power, capable of dealing with terrorism? 
  Al-Sa'id: The security forces are in control of 
the situation all over the governorate. The security fist is 
not concentrating on one area at the expense of another. 
Security measures are being tightened everywhere. The security 
organs are capable of handling this, but the support of the 
people is necessary. The government is meeting the Interior 
Ministry's demands within the limits of available resources. 
[passage omitted] 
  Fahmi: Does the situation in Asyut require the 
armed forces' help to safeguard the vital installations? 
  Al-Sa'id: The vital installations are secured 
according to specific guidelines. There is the popular defense, 
which plays a role in defending the installations. The military 
counselor in the governorate leads the popular defense 
operations in accordance with established plans and targets. 
  Fahmi: Some people are saying that armed forces' 
intervention might be necessary to control the explosive 
situation. 
  Al-Sa'id: It is my personal view that we will not 
reach this point. I have great hopes for the popular action 
that is confronting terrorism and the support being given to the 
security forces in Asyut so that the situation will be decided 
in favor of society's security and stability. [passage omitted]

<F P=106> [Interview with Muslim Brotherhood Spokesman Ma'mun </F>
al-Hudaybi by Sana' al-Sa'id; place, date not given] 
  [Excerpts]][Al-Sa'id] Why has the Muslim Brotherhood washed 
its hands, crawled into its shell, and turned into a spectator 
in the game of terror and extremism? 
  Al-Hudaybi: We have not turned into spectators. 
We work within our potential. Ours is a constant effort to 
spread the true faith and the correct ideas, which involves 
eradicating any mistaken ideas and unfounded opinions. 
  Al-Sa'id: But the tide of terror remains high and 
has not been turned back. 
  Al-Hudaybi: Terror exists and no one can deny it. 
But I cannot destroy it with my current resources. The 
government does not legally recognize my group. All my 
activities are unlawful and my people are prone to arrest. Can 
I call a public meeting? No, it is forbidden. 
  Al-Sa'id: If you sincerely want to contain 
extremism and terror you will succeed. 
  Al-Hudaybi: No, not so. They [the government] 
want us to attack them [the terrorists] without spreading the 
true word [of Islam]. 
  Al-Sa'id: Don't you have a good cause for 
disclaiming their [the extremists'] wrong views? Or are you 
afraid of them? 
  Al-Hudaybi: To act, the state should give us 
leeway. Besides, how can I reach these people [the extremists] 
when they work underground. I do not know them. It is not easy 
for me to get to know them. 
  Al-Sa'id: Rumor has it that you have lines of 
communication with them, isn't that so? 
  Al-Hudaybi: There are no lines of communication or 
links between us and them. And the stage is not set for me to 
confront them. I cannot change things through preaching when I 
am a wanted man and my group is unrecognized. The first thing 
we should have to confront terror is a climate of freedom in 
which our rights and those of others would be respected and 
everyone would be free to express their opinions peacefully and 
without the use of force or threat of using it. 
  Al-Sa'id: Some people claim there is an unholy 
alliance between you and the terrorist groups? 
  Al-Hudaybi: We have nothing to do with them. We 
continue to denounce terror. We oppose violence because it 
disrupts our march, hampers Islamic propagation at home and 
abroad, and tarnishes our image. The government is required to 
uphold the Constitution and respect the law. It should promote 
justice, fairness, and freedom of opinion. The government 
should play by the rules of democracy. It should build true 
democracy, not a bogus one in which elections are rigged and 
parties are banned unless they have the personal approval of the 
head of state.[passage omitted] 
  Al-Sa'id: If [Islam is a creed and code of ethics 
and conduct, as you say], you might as well apply Islam's 
criteria on terrorists, who ruin society by killing, stealing, 
and usurping in the name of religion. 
  Al-Hudaybi: We have no power over them; we have no 
authority to apply to them. How can we do that? 
  Al-Sa'id: By propagating Islam and cleansing 
terrorists of their faults and wrong concepts. 
  Al-Hudaybi: I am promoting the call, making 
efforts, and speaking. I have no militia to fight people with 
arms. I am no agent for the authority. I propagate my creed 
and authentic Islam. 
  Al-Sa'id: Nobody asked you to be an agent of the 
authority and nobody prevented you from propagating authentic 
Islam. 
  Al-Hudaybi: My call is to distinguish the 
authentic from the false. Recruiting me to attack people as if 
I were a tool in the government's hand is rejected. 
  That is why I say that official jurisprudence produces no 
results, because it does not enjoy all its freedom. It is being 
asked to support the authorities. Hence, it loses its 
credibility instantly.[passage omitted] 
  Al-Sa'id: The relationship between you and the 
terrorists is one of specialization but you pretend to have 
nothing to do with them. While you pretend to disapprove of the 
terrorist operations of the extremist groups, you give 
justifications and defend them. 
  Al-Hudaybi: Anyone who wants to discuss things 
that have no foundation can do so. We have nothing to do with 
these people. 
  Al-Sa'id: It is being said that the hardline wing 
represents your first line of defense and that the Muslim 
Brotherhood is hiding behind it until the time is ripe to seize 
power. 
  Al-Hudaybi: We cannot argue with those people who 
make false accusations, because they do not understand our 
conscience or mentality. But they do oppose reality. The 
investigations into the cases of violence, the old case of the 
war college, the killing of al-Sadat, and current events, 
confirm that the Muslim Brotherhood had nothing to do with such 
actions. Had anything been proven against us, it would have 
appeared immediately, because the government does us no favors. 
  Al-Sa'id: You have reportedly had contacts with 
the outside world, including the United States and Iran. Also, 
your contacts with the Zionist movement are not ruled out. 
  Al-Hudaybi: We have no connection with any of 
those. We have no relations with Iran, except when we are 
invited to attend a conference there. We have no relations with 
the United States, because nobody would accept having relations 
with the United States. In what way could we benefit from this 
relationship? It is a major disaster. 
  Al-Sa'id: What about the Zionist movement? 
  Al-Hudaybi: You should not say anything that is 
untrue. 
  Al-Sa'id: You have an international organization 
with charters in Switzerland and Munich. You also have 
resources that enabled you to coordinate the efforts of the 
political Islamic movement in the Arab and Islamic worlds. 
  Al-Hudaybi: We have no organizations abroad. Do 
you call the attending of an international conference that is 
attended by people from elsewhere an organization, as if we were 
using this conference to stage a coup against the world? 
  Al-Sa'id: What exactly do you want? Do you want 
an Islamic approach or a religious state? 
  Al-Hudaybi: First, let's be specific and take, for 
example, the Islamic approach. If we say we want a government 
that abides by Islam, they will then say that this government is 
a religious one and that the Islamic approach is the basis. I 
do not care who applies this. The application of this approach 
is what counts. We are ready to be the servants of the 
government if it applies it. 
  Al-Sa'id: What issues do you propose as essential 
in the national dialogue? Do you believe the issue of a 
religious party should be considered? 
  Al-Hudaybi: Parties are civilian. Each party must 
have its line of thought. Is it prohibited for Muslims to set 
up parties that adopt their Islamic creed and thought? 
  Al-Sa'id: The Constitution makes no provision for 
religious parties. 
  Al-Hudaybi: But it did not ban them. I am a man 
of law and I challenge this. 
  Al-Sa'id: But this will open the door wide to 
religious parties and the Copts will demand equal treatment. 
  Al-Hudaybi: What will happen if they set up a 
religious party? The Copts are no idiots. Let them set up a 
party. Whoever forms a political party seeks to rule to apply 
his principles and dogma. If the Copts in Egypt represent no 
more than 7 percent, they can never contemplate ruling the 
country. But if they want a party, it will be to defend their 
interests and rights and we welcome this. 
  Al-Sa'id: A conflict will ensue. 
  Al-Hudaybi: Nothing of the sort will happen. Is 
the application of Islamic principles a novelty? Islam has been 
applied for centuries. Why the fear then? 
  Al-Sa'id: If the arena is opened to religious 
parties, extremist Islamic currents will demand parties of their 
own. 
  Al-Hudaybi: What do we fear? On the contrary, 
when freedoms are guaranteed only the good will survive. Even 
devious trends will expose themselves in such a climate. 
  Al-Sa'id: But can the state withstand being a 
field for experiments? 
  Al-Hudaybi: All states have parties. There is no 
fear of parties. 
  Al-Sa'id: Do you want parties made up of murderers? 
  Al-Hudaybi: If there is freedom a murderer cannot 
murder. If he kills, the whole world will rise against him, 
detest him, and cast him out. In every state there are parties. 
Algeria had 50 parties. Now there are three. Yemeni parties 
have fallen to three. Issues are always settled; elections 
provide the supportive power of the entire people. 
  Al-Sa'id: Do you see a need to set up a national 
front? 
  Al-Hudaybi: No. All it will do is applaud. 
  Al-Sa'id: So what is the remedy for terror? 
  Al-Hudaybi: Freedom. The government restricts 
freedoms and we call upon it to give freedom to the people and 
abandon the use of force. We call on it to hold free elections 
and call off the emergency laws that have been in force since 
1981. Even the legally recognized parties feel restricted by 
these laws. The government should be truthful, just, and fair 
to gain the people's confidence. There is also a need for 
economic, social, intellectual, and cultural reforms.[passage 
omitted] 
  Al-Sa'id: Why have you not used your influence to 
contain terror? 
  Al-Hudaybi: What can we do? Is it not enough that 
we protect all the professional associations of which we gain 
control from any terrorist influence and prevent any terrorist 
ideas from infiltrating them? We are not a government that can 
eradicate terror. I can destroy them if I have freedom. Some 
90 percent of the causes of deviation and violence would 
disappear if the people were given the freedom to express their 
opinions safely and without threat of violence. Violence breeds 
violence.

<F P=106> ["Calmly" column by Chief Editor Ibrahim Nafi'] </F>
  [Excerpts] The television interview with 'Adil 
'Abd-al-Baqi, one of the former leaders of the al-Shawqiyun 
Group, has provided a good example of the ideology and methods 
used by the terrorist organizations. These organizations are 
raising the banners of religion falsely to achieve their true 
goals, which are the domination and control of the people's 
destinies to seize power by force. 
  The corruption exercised by these groups through Islamic 
legal rulings on murder, plunder, and seizure of unbelievers' 
property to finance their operations [istihlal] represents the 
height of offense against religion, country, law, and public 
order unpracticed by any gangster group in our country before. 
[passage omitted] 
  Frankly and objectively, I say that the terrorist elements 
of 
these new generations are a bad product of the gap between the 
Egyptian media (press and audio-visual) and these youths, their 
aspirations, hopes, and real problems. Most of our media 
concentrates on what is happening in greater Cairo and 
Alexandria and the problems that exist there, without giving 
much attention to the big vacuum in which the new generations 
live and to the need to create bridges of confidence and 
dialogue between these generations and our scholars, thinkers, 
intellectuals, media men, and even politicians and political 
parties whose role has been limited to political contests in the 
press. Not much effort has been made to fill the dreadful 
ideological vacuum that exists among these generations. This 
vacuum is also the result of the defect in the educational 
system. This system requires real revision because it is 
molding unopen minds that do not debate or discuss ideas or 
positions in a rational and critical manner that respects the 
opinion of others. 
  Behind this dreadful ideological vacuum in which Muslim 
legal 
rulings on murder, terrorism, and the seizure of unbelievers' 
property flourish stands the absence of rational, tolerant, 
religious thinking, which has been represented for many decades 
by the al-Azhar and its scholars. [passage omitted] 
  We are facing an illness that requires the efforts of all of 
our scholars and researchers to diagnose the causes of these 
dangerous manifestations. [passage omitted] 
  I think that placing the responsibility for dealing with 
terrorist activity on the shoulders of the security services 
alone is extremely unfair to them, because everyone is called 
upon to do their part in this confrontation. A media role is 
urgently needed to confront the extremist terrorist ideology and 
its sources, which deviate from the principles of religion and 
the consensus of jurisprudence. There is an important and 
required role for the cultural services in this confrontation. 
[passage omitted] 
  According to all indications, there is a need for 
integration 
between the policies of education, culture, and information to 
make it easier for the police forces to carry out their duty 
with competence and efficiency. [passage omitted]

  [Excerpts] Cairo, April 10 (AFP) -- An outlawed 
fundamentalist group said Sunday it had killed a police general, 
who had been at the forefront of the battle against Islamic 
militants, in revenge for human rights abuses in Egyptian 
prisons. 
  Security forces launched a manhunt on Sunday after General 
Ra'uf Khayrat was killed by assailants who hurled a bomb at his 
car in the Egyptian capital. 
  Three people in a car and two on a motorbike raked General 
Khayrat's car with automatic gunfire late Saturday and then 
lobbed the bomb before escaping, witnesses said. 
  The al-Jama'ah al-Islamiyah [Islamic Group] said in a 
statement to AFP it had carried out the attack "to avenge the 
most atrocious violations of human rights which Islamic 
prisoners are subjected to in Egyptian prisons." 
  Khayrat was the number two in the state security services, 
which have been accused by human rights groups of torturing 
suspected militants. 
  His charred body was found in the burnt-out car after the 
attack in the suburb of al-Jizah on Pyramids Avenue, which 
happened as the general was leaving home at the wheel of his 
car, the witnesses said. 
  The al-Jama'ah al-Islamiyah warned on March 27 that it would 
avenge what it called the "serious violations of human rights in 
Egyptian prisons," where the state security services interrogate 
thousands of suspects. 
  It said it had tracked the general down even though he had 
changed address several times, and used three different cars in 
a bid to outwit possible assailants. [passage omitted] 
  Khayrat was one of the leading officials in charge of the 
fight against militants who launched a terror campaign against 
the government in the spring of 1992. 
  It was the first killing of a police general in Cairo, 
though 
four other police generals have been killed in southern Egypt, a 
hotbed of Muslim fundamentalism. 
  Police launched a massive manhunt in al-Jizah, with officers 
out on patrol and soldiers armed with automatic weapons posted 
on all the main roads and bridges of the capital. 
  The motorbike and car used in the attack were found near the 
general's home. 
  It was the worst attack in Cairo since a failed November 25 
assassination bid against Prime Minister 'Atif Sidqi. The 
authorities had since kept Islamic violence mostly confined to 
the south of the country. 
  The Egyptian Human Rights Organisation has accused Khayrat's 
services of systematically torturing suspects in Islamic 
militant attacks. 
  More than 360 people have been killed, including 132 
policemen, since the militants declared war on the secular 
government of President Husni Mubarak in March 1992.

  [Text] Cairo, 13 Apr (MENA) -- Interior Minister Hasan 
al-Alfi has announced that the security agencies recently 
frustrated an extensive terrorist scheme involving 30 criminals 
led by two dangerous leaders. One of the leaders, 'Adil 'Awad 
Siyam, was killed and his brother-in-law, Muhammad 'Abd-al-'Alim 
Khalifah, was arrested. 
  During an international press conference today, al-Alfi 
disclosed the schemes of that organization, which sought to 
terrorize the safe citizens and destabilize the country with the 
ultimate goal of striking at economic development in Egypt. 
  The minister said that the security agencies seized an 
enormous amount of explosives, weapons, and ammunition in the 
hideout of these terrorists. Al-Alfi noted that nine hideouts 
of the terrorist group, which represents the military wing of 
the al-Jihad Organization, were stormed in several governorates 
at the same time and a large quantity of weapons and explosives 
were found. The operations were carried out in the presence of 
representatives from the Higher State Security Prosecution 
Office, experts from the criminal laboratory, and explosive 
experts. The three defendants, whose hiding places were 
stormed, were found in possession of 17,000 dollars, 3,000 
pounds sterling, and 9,000 Egyptian pounds, he added. A number 
of firearms were also seized, including two automatic rifles, an 
Israeli-made Uzi submachine gun, six pistols, 17 magazines of 
automatic weapons, various types of pistols, 582 9-mm bullets, 
three RPG projectiles, three silencers, and a large quantity of 
firing pins, he added. 
  The interior minister added that searches conducted in the 
nine dens led to the seizure of 335 bombs of various types, 
explosives, quantities off sulphuric and nitric acids, ammonium 
nitrate, mercury, chlorine, and ammonium chloride. 
Approximately 150 kg of gelignite powder and another 150 kg of 
(?nitrate) powder, a highly explosive material, also were found 
in the terrorists' hideouts, in addition to a tricycle used as a 
trap, three wireless devices, a cordless telephone, and magnets 
used to attach explosives under vehicles. 
  The interior minister said that the security services seized 
organizational papers and documents containing information about 
the security of the installations and people and the method of 
producing explosives and preparing deceptive traps. The 
security services also seized a list of names of targeted 
figures, various organizational plans, the code used by the 
organization, and receipts for the transfer of foreign currency 
from abroad. 
  The interior minister explained that the security forces 
discovered in the possession of the captured terrorists a 
quantity of forged official papers, including military 
conscription cards, birth certificates, marriage certificates, 
passports, and identity cards as well as a large quantity of 
police and military uniforms and officers' ranks. 
  The interior minister noted that the security services also 
seized various types of vehicles belonging to the organization, 
including vehicles used in operations that members of the 
organization have admitted they carried out. 
  The interior minister said that the security services found 
a 
Yemeni passport belonging to the first accused, 'Adil 'Awad 
Siyam, commander of the organization's military wing, who was 
killed in the al-Munib area in al-Jizah in the past few days. 
  During the international news conference, which was attended 
by more than 100 correspondents from Egyptian and Arab 
newspapers and Arab and foreign news agencies, the interior 
minister noted that because of the detective work carried out by 
various security services following the assassination of Sayyid 
Ahmad Abu-Yahya, the first witness in the case of Prime Minister 
Dr. 'Atif Sidqi, and the wounding of his friends who were with 
him during the attack the State Security Investigations 
Department was able to uncover an extremely dangerous terrorist 
group commanded by 'Adil 'Awad Ahmad Mahmud Siyam, commander of 
the military wing of the al-Jihad Organization in Egypt, who is 
considered one of the most dangerous terrorists to be found in 
recent years. 
  The interior minister said that members of the State 
Security 
Investigations Department also monitored the movements of the 
second terrorist commander, Muhammad 'Abd-al-'Alim Muhammad 
Khalifah, brother-in-law of terrorist 'Adil. 
  The interior minister added that the organization was made 
up 
of a large number of terrorists who were given sophisticated 
training, with the knowledge of the two mentioned commanders, in 
the arts of combat, marksmanship, and the manufacture of various 
types of explosives. He noted that the investigation confirmed 
that terrorist 'Adil 'Awad Siyam assumed responsibility for this 
terrorist organization after his return to the country at the 
instructions of the central command of the terrorist al-Jihad 
organization abroad and after receiving advanced military 
training on the use of all types of weapons and the preparation, 
manufacture, and use of bombs and explosives. 
  The interior minister added: In light of the investigations 
made by the State Security Investigations Department and after 
taking all legal measures, the movements of the organization 
were monitored on tape and by sound and accurate observations 
were intensified until the aforementioned terrorist was 
confirmed to be the link between the terrorist organization's 
elements in the country and its leaders abroad. 
  He added that the investigations also confirmed that 
terrorist leader 'Adil 'Awad Siyam was in control and had such 
great influence on his group that he was convinced of the need 
to commit suicide when arrested to maintain the secrecy of the 
organization and its membership. 
  He said that the investigations confirmed that this 
organization's members were experienced in criminal acts, 
high-risk operations, and vehicle theft and were using aliases 
and a secret code in their contacts and movements. He added 
that these terrorists used the slums and remote areas as centers 
for their activities, depots for their weapons and ammunitions, 
and lairs for hiding. Investigations also showed that the 
organization included a large number of cadres that were well 
prepared and that 30 of these terrorist organization's cadres 
were monitored. 
  The interior minister then said: After asking for permission 
from the Higher State Prosecution Office and taking the 
necessary legal measures, antiterrorist units that are highly 
trained to combat terrorism and to undertake this type of 
confrontation were prepared and sent on time to arrest the 
organization's members and raid its lairs, which had been 
accurately monitored beforehand. 
  He added that security action resulted in the death of the 
dangerous terrorist 'Adil 'Awad Siyam immediately after he 
opened fire on the forces that chased him. He was in a Fiat 128 
car with false license plates. The security forces opened fire 
and killed him. 
  Another leading terrorist who was with him, Muhammad 
'Abd-al- 
'Alim Khalifah, was arrested. A quantity of uniforms similar to 
those used by the Armed Forces and the police were found in the 
car together with a pair of field glasses, a forged identity 
card, and 4,260 pounds. 
  The interior minister said that the State Security 
Investigations Department arrested 30 members of the terrorist 
organization. He added that their names have not been made 
public because the investigation and their confessions indicate 
that other members are being chased and arrested. 
  He said that the names of the other members of the terrorist 
organization will be announced in a detailed statement that the 
ministry will issue after the operations are completed. 
  He added that the defendants gave detailed confessions on 
the 
terrorist operations they had carried out in the past, the most 
important of which was the assassination of citizen Ahmad 
Abu-Yahya on 4 February 1994, who was the primary witness in the 
failed attempt to assassinate Prime Minister Dr. 'Atif Sidqi. 
He said that the weapons used in that incident have been seized 
and noted that the results of the criminal laboratory's 
examinations confirmed the defendants' confessions. The 
vehicles used in that incident also were seized. He said that 
this organization also carried out the attempt to assassinate 
Interior Minister Hasan al-Alfi on 18 August 1993, which 
resulted in the death of terrorists Nazih Nushi Rashid and 
Diya'-al-Din Dawud. The defendants also confessed that they 
detonated the explosive device in the Shabab al-Jazirah Club on 
13 July 1993, which targeted some of the state security officers 
who were at the club for physical training. 
  Minister Musa noted that the defendants made detailed 
confessions on the assassination of 'Adil Anwar al-Sayyid, a 
dissident organization member, in front of his home in the Saray 
al- Qubbah area [in Cairo] on 3 July last year. In their 
confessions, the defendants stated that they had monitored and 
reconnoitered a number of public, political, executive, media, 
judicial, and military figures intending to assassinate them and 
thus create a media uproar meant to tarnish Egypt's reputation 
in the foreign media and shake the people's sense of security 
and stability. 
  The interior minister added that for that purpose the 
organization members took all the necessary steps to blow up 
booby-trapped cars by remote control to cause the maximum degree 
of demolition during the execution of these operations. All 
defendants have been referred to the Higher State Security 
Prosecutor's Office to proceed with the investigations, he added. 
  The minister described the uncovering of this major 
terrorist 
organization as one of the most successful security operations 
conducted by security men in their confrontation with the 
cowardly acts of terrorism carried out by a band of hired hands 
who seek to disrupt security and stability; harm innocent people 
such as the elderly, women, and children; and undermine the 
successful economic reforms. 
  The interior minister stressed that the security men have 
the 
initiative in their confrontation with the forces of evil and 
darkness. He added that these forces have deviated from their 
religion and have pursued ways offensive to the noble Islamic 
religion either to gain false leadership or to earn a few 
dollars by the implementation of a tightly planned scheme that 
primarily seeks to harm Islam and the Muslims. 
  He noted that the security agencies bear the brunt of 
confronting this malicious campaign launched by the modern day 
khawarij [members of a dissident Islamic sect that appeared in 
the 7th century]. He noted that the security strategy depends 
on broadening the circle of confrontation with all terrorist 
elements to frustrate their schemes, uproot them, and eliminate 
all the forces that stand behind them. 
  Reviewing the recent security measures, the interior 
minister 
noted that since the beginning of the year 20 major terrorist 
operations have been aborted. These operations include a series 
of planned explosions and assassinations of public figures that 
would have harmed innocent people, he added. During the same 
period, he added, 43 terrorists were arrested and a number of 
others were killed during exchanges of fire with security men; 
this was out of a total number of 52 terrorists wanted in 
connection with these cases. 
  He emphasized that the security agencies are capable of 
achieving the security and stability we all wish for, adding 
that the security forces are the shield of the people that 
safeguards the country with courage and boldness. He praised 
the close cooperation among the security agencies, the media, 
and the honest and courageous citizens who have supplied the 
security agencies with information out of their sense of 
loyalty. Thanks to this information, he added, this deviant 
band and their hideouts have been attacked. 
  Responding to a question on whether the security services 
have obtained new information on the assassination of Major 
General Ra'uf Khayrat last Saturday night and whether those 
services have been penetrated, the interior minister said that 
the incident is still under investigation and action is being 
taken to identify the culprits. He stressed that when an 
incident takes place it does not mean that the security services 
have been penetrated but, on the contrary, it is the security 
services that have penetrated these fugitive terrorist groups 
and this has helped abort dozens of attempts. 
  Replying to another question about the campaign and whether 
there is coordination between all the services in confronting 
terrorism, Hasan al-Alfi stressed that there is full 
coordination between all the services, especially between the 
security services and the media. 
  Regarding the sources of these weapons and how the 
terrorists 
are getting them, the interior minister said that many of these 
weapons are surplus from former wars and others are being 
brought in across the borders. He stressed that there are 
strict measures to control the borders. 
  In reply to a question on the success achieved by the 
state's 
security services and whether a period of calm is expected, the 
interior minister said that all things are possible. He noted 
that the confrontation of every terrorist group with this 
ferocity and vast financial resources and the security forces' 
vigilance and readiness to make sacrifices for the sake of 
Egypt's security and stability are bound to achieve positive 
results. 
  On whether there is a link between the terrorist al-Jihad 
organization and the terrorist Vanguards of Conquest 
organization or whether the al-Jihad has more than one group, 
the interior minister stressed that the Vanguards of Conquest is 
one of al-Jihad's military groups. He noted that the Vanguards 
of Conquest is a branch of the terrorist al-Jihad organization. 
  Regarding the leaders who have fled abroad, the interior 
minister stressed that there are intensive efforts and constant 
contacts at all levels to apprehend these leaders. But he 
refused to divulge the names of these countries or persons 
because progress has been made in this matter. He said: It is 
in the public interest not to mention any details about them 
until the time is right. 
  In reply to the correspondents' questions, he explained that 
the terrorists began as a small group and then split into other 
groups. He noted that they have a single objective and took 
Islam as a cover, but that they are not Muslims. 
  Responding to a question on whether there is a link between 
the Muslim Brotherhood and these extremist terrorist groups, the 
interior minister stressed that the Muslim Brotherhood is a 
propagator of religion only but that the terrorist groups are 
advocates of violence and assassinations. 
  In response to a question on the possibility of a dialogue 
with these terrorist groups, the interior minister categorically 
denied that there is [words indistinct] and stressed that there 
is no dialogue with these terrorist groups. He asked: Dialogue 
with whom? A dialogue with killers and butchers? Does a state 
conduct a dialogue with killers and criminals? There is not a 
single country in the world that conducts a dialogue with 
killers and criminals who order the killing of innocent people 
with firearms and explosives. 
  On another question about reports that the extremist groups 
are digging a tunnel under Salim Salih Street to be used for 
explosives to ambush and assassinate important figures, the 
interior minister said these reports are "irresponsible." He 
said that the Public Prosecution Office is investigating these 
reports and that everything will be announced when the 
investigation is completed. 
  On the security services' success in eliminating 82 percent 
of the terrorists and whether the rest have a major role in 
terrorist operations, Minister al-Alfi stressed that the 
remaining minority is behind these terrorist actions and the 
sabotage.

  [Text] It has been learned that members of the al-Jihad 
Organization's military wing have constructed secret underground 
tunnels in al-Sharqiyah Governorate in which they built a number 
of cells. 
  According to information, the organization planned to kidnap 
some figures and lock them up in these cells as hostages to put 
pressure on officials to meet their criminal demands. 
AL-JUMHURIYAH has learned that the tunnels were discovered 
during a search for terrorists. Security men found a big water 
tank. When they removed it, they were surprised to find an

  [Text] Guwahati, February 17 -- There seems to be a 
resurgence of militancy in Assam after a respite of nearly two 
years. 
  The killing of a top tea company manager by the United 
Liberation Front of Asom (ULFA) activists in Upper Assam 
yesterday, evoked memories of the days when this underground 
insurgent outfit held the industry to ransom by killing or 
kidnapping senior tea executives. 
  The top brass of the tea industry attended Mr. Rameshwar 
Singh's cremation yesterday afternoon. The fact that the chief 
minister, Mr. Hiteswar Saikia, rushed to Tinsukia from New 
Delhi, speaks of the seriousness of the matter. 
  The last three months have witnessed a dramatic return of 
the 
ULFA and to some extent the Boro Security Force to the 
centrestage. In the second week of December last year, 15 ULFA 
activists attacked a police station in Nagaon and killed four 
policemen in their sleep. A few days later, they killed a 
district Congress chief. In the second week of January, the Boro 
Security Force ambushed a police truck and gunned down eight 
policemen. 
  Early this month, ULFA activists shot dead a Congress leader 
and his bodyguard in Nalbari. Shortly afterwards, the officer 
in-charge of the Gohpur police station in Tezpur was killed in a 
bomb explosion in the police station. The bomb was planted under 
his bed by a trusted constable. 
  Senior police officers say that the militants are trying to 
demoralise the police force, which had achieved major successes 
against them last year. They describe the latest spate of 
killings as "acts of desperation," as the police had kept up the 
pressure on the insurgents. 
  However, the police are alarmed at the new pattern that has 
emerged in the recent killings -- the infiltration into the 
police force by supporters of the insurgents. Two bodyguards of 
the Darrang district deputy commissioner were arrested under 
TADA [expansion not given] and dismissed from service early this 
month after they lost their stenguns, allegedly to the ULFA. 
  "The objective of the militants is to break the force from 
within by brainwashing vulnerable policemen to kill their 
colleagues," said a top police officer. But, he added, the 
militants have not made a significant dent into the force. 
  Perhaps the only thing which goes against ULFA is its latest 
directive to leading Assamese businessmen of Nalbari district to 
cough up hefty sums. While some of them paid clandestinely, most 
defied the directive. "This has not earned the ULFA much 
sympathy, says Mr. Biren Dutta, a deputy commissioner. 
  Meanwhile the Punjab chief minister, Mr. Beant Singh, has 
cleared the despatch of two Punjab police commando battalions to 
Assam to combat ULFA insurgency. 
  Mr. Beant Singh said this today while inaugurating a two-day 
all India seminar on police commandos here. 
  Mr. Beant Singh said that the Assam chief minister had 
requested the Punjab government for police commandos and the 
move had been cleared by the home ministry. The commando 
battalions are likely to reach Assam and start assisting in 
anti-insurgency operations by mid-March. 
  The Punjab police chief, Mr. K.P.S. Gill, said that the 
Assam 
police has only two companies of commandos which are inadequate 
to meet the ULFA challenge. He said the Punjab police commando 
battalions had played a crucial role in crushing militancy in 
the state. 
  Mr. Gill said that more than 10,000 police personnel have 
been trained as commandos, including 5,521 from the district 
police.

  [Text] The explosion of a bomb in the vicinity of Tehran's 
Sa'di Avenue caused some damage today. According to the Central 
News Unit, the bomb was apparently planted inside a car that was 
parked under Sa'di Bridge. As a result of the explosion, one 
vehicle was destroyed, a number of passing vehicles suffered 
some damage, and the windows of several shops were broken. 
  Fortunately, the incident did not cause any deaths. 
According to witnesses, a number of passers by were injured in 
the incident. 
  Reliable security sources have announced: The Iraqi regime 
has recently sent four persons to Iran plant bombs for the 
purpose of sabotage, and today's explosion was caused by these 
same saboteurs.

  [Text] An official spokesman has stated the following: 
  The Iraqi intelligence services have acquired documented and 
serious information regarding the incident of the explosion at 
the World Trade Center in New York. 
  This information raises many suspicions about the parties 
that took part in or were behind the incident. 
  The competent Iraqi authorities are willing to cooperate 
with 
the United States to learn the facts as they exist. We hope 
that the U.S. side that handles this will be impartial. It is 
preferable that this should be done with the knowledge of the 
U.S. Congress or under its supervision.

<F P=106> [Peter Grolig report: "Northern Iraq: `Blood Money' for UN </F>
Policemen?"] 
  [Excerpt] A rumor is circulating among the UN policemen 
employed in northern Iraq: The Iraqi intelligence service is 
said to have offered "blood money." Reportedly, it pays about 
$10,000 for the death of a member of the United Nations Guards 
Contingent (UNGCI). 
  "The servant of the base was the first who reported on it," 
an inspector, who had recently returned home, told KURIER. 
"From that time onward, we heard again and again that our death 
would bring the murderer much money." 
  First Lieutenant Gerald Hesztera from the Interior Ministry 
in Vienna, who is responsible for the 50 Austrian policemen 
participating in UN missions all over the world, qualifies this: 
"There is no proof of that." 
  "You feel that you have been hit, you feel the pain... you 
hear the shots and you wait and see whether you are hit once 
again." Ferry Elsholz, 32, policeman from Vienna, had a close 
shave during the mission in northern Iraq. A projectile ripped 
his thigh open and penetrated the bone. The same bullet hit the 
neck of WEGA [expansion unknown] man Heinz Morgenbesser, 28, and 
got stuck under his right ear. 
  "I thought that this is the end," Morgenbesser remembered 
when KURIER was permitted to visit him in the AKH hospital in 
Vienna. 
  Elsholz and Morgenbesser had been taken there after the 
attack on Palm Sunday. As reported, part of the UN contingent 
had set off for home via Mosul and Baghdad when the assassins 
opened fire with a bazooka and kalashnikovs about half an hour 
after the departure of the UN vehicle. [passage omitted]

  [Text] The 'Izz-al-Din al-Qassam Battalions, the military 
wing of the Islamic Resistance Movement, Hamas, has claimed 
responsibility for the suicide operation carried out by a 
Palestinian youth in Hadera, north of Tel Aviv, in which five 
Israelis were killed and approximately 30 others were wounded. 
  A short while ago, we received a statement from the 
Organization of the Hizaballah Mujahidin-the Occupied Territory 
[munazzamat mujahidi hizballah, al-aradi al-muhtallah] claiming 
responsibility for this operation. The statement says: The 
Hizballah mujahidin were able this morning to explode a bus 
north of Tel Aviv killing and wounding many Israelis.

  [Excerpt] Here is a report just in: There was an 
explosion on a bus in the Hadera central bus station. Our 
correspondent Yo'av Aviv is on the line with more details: 
  The explosion occurred in the back part of the bus, near the 
rear exit door. We know that there were fatalities -- apparently 
one or two people were killed in the blast. I must stress that 
this is an initial report, and the details may not be final. 
There are wounded too, and they are being evacuated by 
ambulances to the Hilel Yafe Hospital in Hadera. 
  Police have cordoned off the area and have already collected 
eye witnesses' testimonies about Arabs they had seen on that 
bus. Those who placed the explosive charge may have gotten off 
earlier. Searches are in progress. 
  To repeat, an explosive charge went off aboard bus No. 820 
from 'Afula to Tel Aviv. The charge went off when the bus got 
to Hadera. [passage omitted]

  [Excerpts] Six were killed and about 25 wounded, mostly 
lightly, in an explosion inside a bus during a boarding interval 
in the Hadera central bus station. The No. 820 bus was on its 
way from 'Afula to Tel Aviv. 
  It is believed that Arabs, who boarded the bus at one of the 
stops, left the bomb on the bus. Another theory says the 
perpetrator was a suicide terrorist. [passage omitted] 
  Our correspondent Yo'av Aviv adds that there has been a 
second explosion on the bus, this time apparently a planned 
blast activated by bomb disposal experts, who found another 
bomb. The Hadera central bus station has been closed off, and 
local inhabitants are staging a demonstration nearby, calling 
out anti-Arab slogans. [passage omitted]

Among the six killed was apparently the terrorist himself. 
Hamas [Islamic Resistance Movement] has claimed responsibility 
and says more attacks can be expected. Most of those hurt 
sustained light injuries, and most of those have already been 
released from hospital. In Hadera demonstrators protested 
against the violence and government policy. [passage omitted]

said that this was yet another attack by fanatics trying to 
sabotage the peace process. We, however, will stay the course 
and continue implementing the peace process, thus foiling their

  Rabin spoke about the announcement by Hamas [Islamic

again today Hamas announced it will carry out five harsh 
retaliatory attacks inside Israel's territory to revenge the 
massacre. According to Hamas, it has carried out two of those 
attacks: the grave attack last week in 'Afula and today's 
serious attack in Hadera. Prime Minister Rabin said Hamas and 
the Islamic Jihad decided to focus on their activity inside the 
Green Line boundaries with a political aim of diverting Israeli 
public opinion against the peace process. [passage omitted]

  [Excerpt] Strasbourg, April 13 (AFP) -- PLO Chairman Yasir 
'Arafat Wednesday [13 April] condemned attacks against "innocent 
Israelis" in a speech to the European Parliament here, after six 
people were killed in a bomb attack. 
  He was talking after learning that a bomb had exploded on a 
bus at station north of Tel Aviv, killing six Israelis and 
injuring 21 others. 
  Arafat said: "These attacks are just targeting innocent 
people on both sides, Israelis and Palestinians, and do nothing 
but strike at the heart of the peace process." 
  "All extremist forces on both sides, Israeli and 
Palestinian, 
have thrown themselves into a kind of escalation which cannot be 
halted." [passage omitted]

<F P=106> [Interview with Lieutenant General Ehud Baraq, chief of </F>
staff, by army affairs correspondent Karmela Menashe; place and 
date not given -- recorded] 
  [Excerpt] 
  Menashe: Chief of Staff Ehud Baraq, you have just 
returned from a tour of Judaea and Samaria, of Qalqilyah. Is 
the closure being enforced? 
  Baraq: As far as possible. I met with reserve 
soldiers from a very fine northern Infantry brigade, and I saw 
that they were very well briefed on the need to conduct tighter 
checks of both documents and the license plates on Israeli 
vehicles leaving the territories. In addition, they are properly 
inspecting the trunks of the vehicles and checking under the 
seats. Secondary roads are being cut off, and patrols are 
deploying between the roads and inside the terrain itself. All 
these actions hinder the infiltration of people and warfare 
means into Israel, but we must admit with all honesty that they 
do not eliminate the danger entirely. 
  Menashe: Has the IDF [Israel Defense Forces] 
begun implementing the order from the prime minister and defense 
minister to move troops from the territories to the 
Israel-territories divide, the Green Line? 
  Baraq: Yes. Immediately after receiving this 
order over 24 hours ago, we started to considerably increase our 
deployment along the divide at the expense of our presence both 
in Judaea and Samaria and in Israel. This is part of some 
recent changes resulting from new emphases in response to the 
changing situation. We are no less responsible for the security 
of Israelis in Judaea and Samaria today than we were yesterday, 
but the recent events -- most notably the events in Hadera and 
'Afula -- revealed that the emphasis of the other side's 
operational activity has shifted to the divide; therefore, it is 
vital that we shift our own activity to that place. [passage

The rockets were found and detonated at the site by UN soldiers

  Our correspondent Yo'av Aviv reports that several katyusha 
rockets were fired on the security zone at midday. They fell 
inside the south Lebanese security zone, near the Israeli 
border. Qiryat Shemona and confrontation line residents were 
ordered into shelters. 
  Major General Yitzhaq Mordekhay, the Northern Command 
commander, said the IDF [Israel Defense Forces] will not permit 
Hizballah to bring about an escalation in the situation in south 
Lebanon.

  [Excerpts] Joint Lebanese and Syrian Army units raided 
Hizballah arms caches in the Ba'labakk area two days ago and 
confiscated weapons, equipment, and drugs. Israeli security 
sources believe that such activity, if it continues, could have 
political significance. [passage omitted] 
  The joint raid was directed against arms caches in a 
Hizballah stronghold in the Ba'labakk area. Large amounts of 
weapons, explosives, and drugs were seized. Over the past few 
weeks, the Lebanese Army raided Christian strongholds several 
times and detained several persons. Israeli sources believe 
that the Lebanese Army is trying to demonstrate its control in 
Lebanon and show it is also operating in the northern part of 
the country. [passage omitted]

<F P=106> [Report by political correspondent Aluf Ben] </F>
  [Excerpts] Israel will demand that the understandings 
achieved with Syria in July 1993 as a result of Operation 
Accountability be expanded in a bid to curb Hizballah activity 
in the security zone and minimize friction between Hizballah and 
other terrorist organizations on one hand and the IDF [Israel 
Defense Forces] and the SLA [South Lebanese Army] on the other. 
Prime Minister Yitzhaq Rabin will ask Secretary of State Warren 
Christopher, who will visit Israel next week, to relay this 
message to Syrian President Hafiz al-Asad. 
  Among other things, Israel will demand that the ban on 
Hizballah katyusha and mortar attacks be expanded to include the 
security zone as well. The Operation Accountability 
understandings refer only to Israeli territory. 
  In contacts with U.S. officials over the past few days, 
senior Israeli officials made it clear that as a result of the 
war of attrition with Hizballah, the SLA is under a strain so 
great that it is in danger of disintegrating -- a thing which 
Israel cannot tolerate. [passage omitted] 
  Reacting to Israeli warnings, senior Lebanese and Syrian 
officials told the U.S. ambassadors in both countries' capitals 
that Hizballah is maintaining the Operation Accountability 
understandings by limiting its attacks to IDF and SLA military 
targets, while Israel and the SLA are breaching the 
understandings by attacking civilians. 
  Israel briefed the United States in detail about last 
weekend's events in south Lebanon. [passage omitted]

<F P=106> [Telephone interview with Uri Lubrani, coordinator of </F>
government activities in Lebanon, by Hayim Zissowitz -- live] 
  [Excerpt] 
  Zissowitz: Mr. Lubrani, in his speech in the 
Knesset yesterday, the prime minister said Syria is still not 
evincing enough openness and flexibility to permit a 
breakthrough in the talks on the substance of peace. This also 
relates to Hizballah activity, which Syria is allowing to 
continue. What is Syria's policy in Lebanon? 
  Lubrani: Syria undoubtedly regards Hizballah 
activity in Lebanon as leverage for gaining advantages on its 
track. 
  Zissowitz: A report in HA'ARETZ this morning 
speaks about a joint Syrian-Lebanese military operation against 
Hizballah arms caches in Ba'labakk. 
  Lubrani: I can only say that from what we know, 
this operation can be considered mere cosmetics. They are 
trying to prove that they are doing something, but I know 
nothing about such a thing in practice. 
  Zissowitz: Are there any signs that Syria is 
trying to curb Hizballah attacks against Israel? 
  Lubrani: Occasionally, as a result of American 
pressure and in order to appease the United States, Syria 
attempts to curb Hizballah, even if only for appearances sake. 
There have been two such cases. During the last elections, 
there was a period of one month without any serious Hizballah 
attacks. Recently, in anticipation of the al-Asad-Clinton 
summit, complete calm was restored. Syria can stop Hizballah 
attacks if it wants to. 
  Zissowitz: What about the SLA's [South Lebanese 
Army] operations? This organization suffered many casualties in 
battles against Hizballah last weekend. Civilians were also 
killed. Is the SLA's morale flagging? 
  Lubrani: The SLA is undoubtedly facing a process 
of attrition. Both Hizballah and the rejectionist organizations 
are trying to undermine the SLA and the security zone. The SLA 
is having a hard time dealing with this situation, but it is 
continuing to function and is manning its posts. The SLA is our 
spearhead in maintaining calm along our northern border. 
  Zissowitz: Is there any truth to the reports that 
the SLA is bitter over the fact that the IDF [Israel Defense 
Forces] is limiting its ability to react to the terrorists' 
provocations? 
  Lubrani: There is some truth to these reports. It 
is only natural, however, that they would prefer to react much 
more firmly to attacks on them. On the other hand, they know 
that our actions are aimed at trying to preserve the 
understandings we reached with the Syrians via the Americans. 
Most of the time, they refrain from reacting, even when they 
are provoked to retaliate. Sometimes such outbursts do occur, 
such as the attack on Sidon last Friday. 
  Zissowitz: There were reports of a massacre 
perpetrated by the SLA in the village of 'Aramta. 
  Lubrani: There was no such massacre. It was 
invented by Lebanese and Syrian information circles, who turned 
Hizballah attacks in 'Aramta -- which hit the civilian 
population primarily -- into an SLA attack against the 
population of this village. This is an outright lie. 
  Zissowitz: Are you completely satisfied with 
continuing the cooperation and coordination between the IDF and 
SLA? 
  Lubrani: I have no doubt that the coordination 
and cooperation will continue. There are easy periods and more 
difficult periods. We have already been through such periods. 
We must realize, however, that we are in the midst of a war of 
attrition aimed not only at the SLA but at the IDF as well. The 
SLA is bearing a very heavy load, and we must realize this fact 
and deal with it accordingly. [passage omitted]

  [Text] Amman -- AL-RA'Y -- Competent security authorities 
have managed to apprehend 10 persons on charges of setting up an 
"Islamic" organization in order to carry out terrorist acts 
inside the Kingdom. 
  Security sources explained that the group, led by a 38-year 
person, met in an Amman neighborhood. It had prepared a phased 
plan to execute its operations. 
  Under the first phase of its plan, the sources indicated, 
the 
group would do anything to collect money. Therefore, it carried 
out armed robberies against a number of shops and taxi drivers 
in the capital. 
  The sources added that the second phase was aimed at 
carrying 
out robberies against some commercial banks in Amman. The group 
kept a special record of banks against which armed robberies had 
been planned. 
  The sources explained that during the third phase they would 
use the stolen money to purchase weapons. The sources explained 
that the robberies were still in their initial stages, during 
which light weapons were used and tear gas was used against taxi 
drivers. 
  The sources said the first phase of the operation was 
successful. Members of the group managed to attack some taxi 
drives and to burglarize some shops. However, having monitored 
their movements, the security authorities arrested the thieves 
and uncovered other members of the organization and their 
objectives. 
  The sources stressed that members of the armed group have 
been placed under intensive interrogation. They will be 
referred to specialized courts. Public trials will be held to 
acquaint the public with the robberies that had been carried out.

  [Text] Beirut, April 13 (AFP) -- A Muslim fundamentalist 
who said he had orders "to kill any Frenchman" was sentenced to 
a life term of hard labor Wednesday for the 1986 murder of a 
French diplomat, the state-run news agency NNA [NATIONAL NEWS 
AGENCY] said. 
  The defendant, Hasan Muhammad Tulays, a corporal in the 
Lebanese army and member of Islamic Resistance, a paramilitary 
wing of the pro-Iranian group Hizballah, had confessed to the 
killing. 
  He testified that at the time of the shooting of Christian 
Gouttiere [name as received], the military attache at the French 
embassy, he had "received an order to kill any French person". 
  The military court that sentenced Tulays rejected his 
lawyer's appeal for amnesty, saying that to do so could damage 
relations between France and Lebanon. 
  Under a law passed in 1991, the death penalty in Lebanon was 
replaced by a sentence of life at hard labor. 
  An alleged accomplice of Tulays, Munzir Rammal, tried in 
absentia, got the same sentence. 
  Tulays was 26 at the time of the shooting. 
  Gouttiere, 54, was shot in the head three times in a 
Christian suburb of Beirut, near the French embassy.

  [Text] Islamabad, April 3: The Federal Government was 
looking out for around 200 Arab nationals whose visas were 
cancelled in January. These Arab nationals were working with 
NGO's [non- governmental organizations] involved in the welfare 
and rehabilitation of the displaced Afghans. 
  Most of these people, stationed in Peshawar and engaged in 
relief and rehabilitation activities were asked by the 
government to leave the country by January 31. However, even 
after the expiry of January 31 deadline the government knows 
nothing about their whereabouts. 
  Out of these 200 around 150 are Egyptian nationals, 40 
Tunisians and 8 from Algeria, says a report prepared by the 
Federal Government. 
  The Egyptian authorities are convinced that the 
assassination 
attempt on President Hosni Mubarak was sponsored by the Egyptian 
dissidents residing in Pakistan. President Mubarak had 
personally conveyed this concern to former Prime Minister, 
Muhammad Nawaz Sharif. The then Pakistani PM had explained that 
his country had nothing to do with the terrorists and would 
extradite the Arab nationals from its soil. 
  "It is presumed that these people had left the country, says 
a high level government official in Islamabad. But to which 
country they have gone the government is not sure. 
  The Government of Pakistan, the officials said, was very 
clear on the subject. Since the Afghan Jehad has ended all the 
foreign nationals involved in the activity must leave the 
country, the official said. 
  "There will be no visa extension for them and those granted 
extensions should consider them void," said the officials. The 
government he said was determined to clear itself of the 
allegations that Pakistan was sponsoring terrorist activities. 
The Pakistani soil would not be allowed for any activities 
against any other state against any other state, he said. 
  Following the cancellation of visas of these Arab nationals, 
several reminders were sent to the NWFP government asking for 
report on the implementation of the federal government's 
directive for the extradition of the Arab nationals. The 
provincial government, however, had so far failed to reply to 
any of these directives. 
  The officials were of the view that the government of 
Pakistan had no desire to keep such people in the country as 
they could be dangerous for the country's security too." 
  However, the Government of Pakistan cannot hand over the 
culprits to the Governments of Algeria, Egypt and Tunisia. 
Pakistan is making efforts to hammer out extradition treaties 
with at least three of the Arab countries including Saudi 
Arabia, United Arab Emirates and Egypt. The signing of the 
treaties will facilitate exchange of criminals. 
  Officials, however, could not confirm that Pakistan, during 
1993, had extradited 3,000 Arab nationals as stated by Federal 
Minister for Law and Parliamentary Affairs, Syed Iqbal Haider.

<F P=106> [Report by Anosh Ahamath] </F>
  [Text] COLOMBO, April 9 (AFP) -- Security was tightened in 
the Sri Lankan capital Saturday after suspected Tamil guerillas 
carried out a bombing campaign aimed at disrupting Sri Lanka's 
booming tourism industry, officials said. 
  Two people died and three were wounded in overnight 
explosions near the Mount Lavinia beach resort, at the deluxe 
Colombo Marriott, Taj Samudra and the three-star Sapphire Hotel, 
officials said. 
  Another bomb went off Saturday morning at the Zoological 
Gardens. Despite the large number of visitors, there were no 
casualties because the blast occurred in an isolated marshy area. 
  No foreigners were wounded in the blasts, police said. 
  K. H. J. Wijayadasa, secretary to President Dingiri Banda 
Wijetunga, said the government believed the attacks were carried 
out by the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam (LTTE), which is 
fighting for a separate state in the northeast. 
  "From first indications, from the pattern of explosions, it 
looks as if it is a LTTE job," Wijayadasa told reporters shortly 
after inspecting a badly damaged toilet at the Marriott. 
  The bombs went off simultaneously at Marriott, Taj, 
frequented by western tourists, and the Sapphire, which is 
"usually patronised" by minority Tamils from the LTTE stronghold 
of northern Jaffna. 
  Wijayadasa said that two suspected LTTE rebels died when a 
bomb they were carrying exploded prematurely. Another accomplice 
was seriously wounded in the blast, he said. A Tamil couple, 
guests at Sapphire, were also injured. 
  Wijayadasa said that Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe 
presided over a high-level security meeting at which it was 
decided to tighten security at all hotels in and around Colombo. 
  He said the explosions were aimed at driving out tourists 
from the Indian Ocean island nation. 
  "Obviously, this is aimed at disrupting tourism and causing 
a 
certain element of panic. But I think we have escaped fairly 
unscathed," Wijayadasa said. 
  Francis Keenan, the resident general manager of Marriott, 
which is part of the American Marriott chain, said that there 
had been no panic because the blast occurred inside a toilet 
outside the dining hall. 
  "The guests hardly knew what had happened. They have taken 
it 
in the correct spirit," said Keenan. 
  State Minister for Tourism Gamini Lokuge said he hoped the 
tourism industry would not be affected as a result of the latest 
blasts but said that the authorities have taken "very tight 
security measures" to prevent any harm to foreigners. 
  "I don't think the industry will be affected. To my 
knowledge 
no guest has decided to leave," Lokuge said. 
  Lokuge said the industry anticipated a record 450,000 
tourists to visit the island this year. About 120,000 tourists 
have already arrived in the first three months of the year, he 
said. 
  However, nervous hoteliers and travel agents said they were 
adopting a wait-and-see attitude for the moment. 
  "This is the kind of thing that frightens most tourists. 
They 
are all sensitive to such incidents, especially the Japanese," a 
senior travel agent official said. 
  Sri Lanka's tourism industry took a heavy battering between 
1983 and 1989, when Tamil guerrilla bomb attacks and a separate 
anti- government campaign by extremist Sinhalese forced tourists 
to keep away from the island. 
  But the trade began recovering fast after the military 
crushed the Sinhalese insurgency in 1989.

Interior Minister Viktor Yerin in Istanbul; date of interview 
not given; published under the "This Colorful World. TRUD 
Correspondents Report" rubric: "Together Against Terrorism"] 
  [Text] Istanbul -- Russian Interior Minister Viktor 
Yerin's visit to Turkey was mainly devoted to joint actions in 
the fight against national and international terrorism. 
  In an interview with your correspondent Yerin stated that 
the 
visit had been successful because it had been possible to 
discuss all pressing problems of concern to both the Russian and 
the Turkish side. They are primarily drug smuggling, the 
illegal trade in firearms, and the fight against terrorism. 
Special attention was devoted to the last question because a 
bilateral agreement on it between Russia and Turkey is being 
prepared. 
  During the talks, the minister recounted, the Turkish side 
raised the question of "Russia's moral support for the actions 
of the Workers' Party of Kurdistan, which is banned in Turkey." 
A conference of Kurds which took place a month ago in Moscow 
was cited as an example. However, it was explained to the 
Turkish side that the conference was of a purely scientific 
nature and that, most importantly, the aforementioned party had 
nothing to do with it. 
  Back in 1992, during the Turkish interior minister's visit 
to 
Moscow, Russia and Turkey signed an agreement envisaging the 
possibility of an exchange of specific operational information 
about people justifiably suspected of committing crimes. During 
the preparations for the current visit to Turkey, Yerin said, a 
list of Russians who might commit crimes on Turkish territory 
was compiled and handed over to the Turkish side.

  [Text] The currently reorganized special force Vympel will 
combat nuclear terrorism, Commander of the Russian Interior 
Troops, Colonel General Anatoliy Kulikov announced on Tuesday. 
  He said that Vympel would be directly controlled by the 
interior minister. 
  He also pointed out that the tactics of the interior troops 
guarding nuclear power plants and nuclear defense facilities 
have become outdated in as they were mostly oriented against 
individual terrorists, not organized criminals. The interior 
troops also lack armored equipment and special security devices, 
said Kulikov. There are plans to equip servicemen with gas 
weapons, he stated. 
  He also complained that the interior troops were 49 percent 
understaffed.

<F P=106> [Besik Urigashvili report: "Bombers' Games in Tbilisi"] </F>
  [Text] Tbilisi -- The terrorists continued their bloody 
games 9 April when all Georgia was honoring the memory of the 
people who died on that day five years ago when Soviet troops 
broke up a peaceful rally. 
  Early in the morning three people died at Sadakhlo Station 
on 
the Armenian border when a bomb planted under a Tbilisi-Yerevan 
passenger train exploded, and a few hours later an explosion 
rang out at the SVOBODNAYA GRUZIYA editorial building, which 
also houses the IZVESTIYA office. This time fortunately there 
were no casualties, but I would like to go into this in a bit 
more detail. 
  Toward around 1300 hours, when a procession of excited 
supporters of ex-president Zviad Gamsakhurdia was moving down 
Rustaveli Boulevard, Besik Tskhoroguzli, a colleague of mine 
from SVOBODNAYA GRUZIYA, and I decided to watch the 
demonstration from his office balcony, which directly overlooked 
the boulevard. 
  About 10-15 minutes later when the crowd of demonstrators 
had 
almost passed our observation post we heard the creak of a door 
opening and almost immediately a sound like the crack of a 
starting pistol. We immediately dashed into the room but at 
that moment we were deafened by a powerful explosion. We were 
thrown back onto the balcony by the force of the blast and 
covered with fragments of glass. When we came to our senses 
some time later and went into the room thick smoke was pouring 
from a sofa by the entrance to the balcony and plaster was 
falling from the ceiling. 
  Police and security personnel appeared on the scene in a 
matter of minutes. The surprise came later. On arrival the 
officers feverishly inspected the room but, instead of taking 
any action to seal off the exits from the building, began 
hysterically cross-examining us while we were still in a state 
of shock from the explosion. And each of them, moreover, 
confidently came up with his own version of events without 
taking any notice of our testimony. It was only at the end a 
few hours later, when Georgiy Shalutashvili, an investigator 
from the security service's investigation department, who 
listened to us fairly attentively, took over the case, that he 
said. "You were lucky, had the grenade not landed on the sofa 
you would have been done for."

<F P=106> [Report by Wolfgang Purtscheller, Thomas Vasek: </F>
"Desperately Seeking Dr. Vanda"] 
  [Excerpts] At the end of March the usually very restrained 
director general of public security talked with surprising 
frankness about a specific lead. He hopes that the German 
authorities will soon find the suspected wire puller of the 
letter bomb attacks before Christmas, Michael Sika told DIE 
PRESSE. 
  The name that Sika mentioned in this connection, was one 
that 
has been known for a long time in Austria: Ekkehard Weil, who 
was sentenced to six years in prison in 1981 after a series of 
bomb attacks on nine Jewish institutions and personalities. 
According to Sika, there has been no trace of Weil since 6 
December 1993, that is, since the beginning of the series of 
bombs. 
  This is purposeful disinformation. Because the "German 
lead," of which the Interior Ministry has been talking for quite 
some time, has never led to Ekkehard Weil. He was just 
considered as a witness, who it was hoped would provide the 
investigators of the "Letter Bombs Special Commission" with more 
detailed information about the German connection of Peter Binder 
and his comrades. 
  As if to prove that the lead to Weil cannot be so hot, the 
neo- Nazi appeared in public last week. He had to answer to the 
Eighth Criminal Division of the Bochum Land Court for 
"instigating people," "fanning racial hatred," "insulting and 
slandering the memory of the deceased." On Monday and 
Wednesday, at 0900 in the morning each day, Ekkehard Wiel 
appeared in court room 147. 
  Months ago the right-wing extremist had found refuge in the 
Ruhr area under the cover name "Karl Schubert." Most recently 
he found refuge with a Mrs. M. at Castropper Hellweg in Bochum. 
  So far, the trace leading to the Berlin Nazi rocker and 
Weil's friend Arnulf Priem has also proved to be unsuccessful so 
far; at the beginning of the bomb series Priem had been seen by 
three different witnesses in Vienna's subway. However, Priem 
brought regulars from his favorite restaurants to the Berlin 
police to back up his alibi. 
  The traces to Priem and Weil led to the surroundings of the 
infamous "occupied house" in Weitlingstrasse 122, where the two 
had free access for years. In Berlin's brown [fascist] scene 
the mystery of the "German trace" has become a bit clearer. The 
FRG authorities and the EBT (Antiterrorism Task Force) of the 
Austrian Interior Ministry have not been pursuing Weil since 
December but another one of the people living at 
Weitlingstrasse: Bendix Wendt, 27, neo-Nazi and weapons fanatic 
with experience in using explosives. This man, who has been in 
prison several times and who has been a close friend of Priem's 
for some years, who has the say in the Berlin scene, was 
responsible for, among other things, the acquisition of military 
equipment from old GDR stocks. 
  Not quite two days after the arrest of suspected letter bomb 
attacker Peter Binder, a certain "Dr. Vanda" from Berlin called 
the arrested man's wife. Why has Peter not yet arrived, the 
caller asked with an agitated voice. Binder's wife told him 
what had happened: Her husband had just been caught at the 
Czech border. Vanda gets nervous, he must now disappear, he 
says, and puts down the receiver. The telephone had been bugged 
by the State Police. 
  Years ago, in a written statement to the police, Berlin 
ex-Nazi Ingo Hasselbach revealed the various cover names of his 
former comrades: Dr. Vanda, derived from Priem's troop "The 
Vandals," is the pseudonym used by Bendix Wendt. 
  Under his correct name Wendt had talked to Binder's wife 
even 
before Binder was arrested, to tell her that his apartment had 
been searched and that he has to flee. "Why the search?" 
Brigitte Binder asks. Wendt: "Why do you think?" Cryptically, 
although the meaning is quite obvious, the two continue their 
dialogue. Everything indicates that subsequently Wendt became 
more cautious because of potential telephone bugging and, 
therefore, used his cover name for his next call. 
  According to what he said, Binder was on his way to Berlin 
when he was caught. He had met Bendix Wendt there during one of 
his previous trips. 
  The role of "Dr. Vanda" in the attacks in Austria is one of 
the last missing pieces in the letter bomb puzzle, which the 
State Policy has been trying to piece together in close 
cooperation with the judiciary for some months. The 
investigations of the EBT have now been concluded: Probably 
this week the so-called "full complaint" against three Austrian 
right-wing extremists, who are suspects in connection with the 
letter bombs, will be passed on to public prosecutor Sepp-Dieter 
Fasching: Peter Binder, 26 is suspected of having been 
essentially involved in the letter bomb attacks and of having 
violated the Weapons Law and the law banning neo-Nazi activities 
(about 40 evidential facts). The case against Franz Radl 
junior, 26, is based on his being an accomplice to the deed and 
violating the law banning neo-Nazi activities (about 20 
evidential facts). The suspicion against Gerhard Endres, 32, 
refers to engaging in neo-Nazi activities and accumulating means 
of combat. [passage omitted] 
  Radl also had very close contacts with a Carinthian neo-Nazi 
group, which publishes the illegal Nazi pamphlet KAERNTNER 
BEOBACHTER [CARINTHIAN OBSERVER]. Two of Radl's closest 
fellow-fighters, Andreas T. and Helmut Adolf S., turned up last 
year at the traditional Ulrichsberg meeting of the right-wing 
extremist scene in the company of a German Nazi terrorist and 
explosives expert: chemist Peter N., 41. 
  Now, in addition to "Dr. Vanda," this man is becoming the 
focus of interest for German and Austrian investigators. He is 
thought to have the expert knowledge in chemistry that the 
Austrians probably lacked. According to German sources, Wendt 
and N. were in contact with each other -- and with the Austrian 
comrades via Binder and the Carinthian Radl group. 
  "Given the fact that he started out at zero, the result is 
remarkable," a top official of State Policy summarized the 
results shortly before these results of the investigations are 
passed on the public prosecutor. As a result, the Austrian 
State Police is closing the file on the letter bombs for the 
time being. Now it is Interpol's task to complete the 
increasingly complete letter bomb puzzle: Because the Austrians 
are convinced that German neo-Nazis were involved. The search 
for Bendix Wendt (aka Dr.Vanda) is in full swing.

<F P=106> [Report by Katy Turner] </F>
  [Text] Slain chairman of the Cyprus Kurdistan Solidarity 
Committee, Theofilos Yeoryiadhis, was not behind bomb attacks in 
Turkey as reports suggest, outraged colleagues said yesterday. 
  According to a release by the Ankara-based International 
Affairs Agency (IAA) Yeoryiadhis was behind bomb attacks in 
tourist areas in Turkey last year and also the attempted murder 
of Turkish general Dorgan Gures in 1992. 
  Yeoryiadhis was shot and killed outside his home last month 
by a passing motorcyclist, believed to be a Turkish agent. No 
arrests have been made. 
  Fellow member of the Kurdistan Solidarity Committee, Lakis 
Pingouras yesterday denied Theofilos' involvement with the 
alleged crimes. "Our committee offers political support to the 
national movement of the Kurds, nothing more and nothing less," 
he said. 
  The committee, which promotes the Kurdish issue to European 
bodies, is similar to bodies in other countries which count MP's 
among their members. "We offer nothing other than political 
support," he said. 
  Pingouras said the IAA follows the local press and brands 
anybody concerned with the Cyprus or Kurdish problem a terrorist. 
  A branch of the IAA has recently been set up in occupied 
Nicosia. According to their latest report Yeoryiadhis was a 
self-confessed agent of the island's Greek intelligence services. 
  The report said the plot to kill General Gures two years 
ago, 
by putting poison in his coffee, was hatched in the free areas. 
Yeoryiadhis, the agency reported, had admitted on a TV chat show 
he was involved in the plan. 
  It also alleged that bombs against tourist targets in Turkey 
were designed by the Solidarity Committee.

<F P=106> [Article by Lars Villemoes: "Shots in Lyngby"] </F>
  [Text] The police believe that the motive for the attempted 
murder of a Kurd should be sought in his activity as leader of 
the Kurdistan Committee, the group that acts as spokesman for 
the Kurdish Workers Party (PKK), a Kurdish terrorist 
organization. 
  Terrorism came to the suburbs and drew an ugly trail of 
blood 
through the Danish routine when 30-year-old Imdat Yilmaz, a 
politically active Turkish-speaking Kurd, was gunned down 
outside the front door of his home in a housing complex at 21 
Lundtoftegardsvej in Lyngby on 7 February. On his way home from 
the bakery at 0815 hours with some bread for breakfast, Yilmaz 
was hit twice in the stomach as well as in the chest and upper 
left arm by four shots fired from a 7.65mm pistol by a 
perpetrator waiting at the entrance. 
  The victim, who came close to losing his life in the 
attempted murder, has said in a few statements to the police 
that he could not recognize the would-be assassin. A neighbor 
who walked out of the building's elevator happened to be present 
when two of the shots at Yilmaz were fired and called the 
police. The witness could provide only a sketchy description of 
a dark-skinned man, 30 to 40 years old, 180-185 cm tall and 
armed with a pistol, who at the time of the shooting was dressed 
in a black jogging suit with the hood tied. 
  On orders from the leader of the investigation, Detective 
Inspector Gerhard Rohwer of the Lyngby Police, policemen from 
the Copenhagen Police Force's special unit, armed with 
submachine guns, moved out and arrested 20 Turkish Kurds who had 
gathered for a news conference about the attempted murder at the 
Kurdistan Committee premises in the Vesterbro district of 
Copenhagen. The police responded to a tip that the assault could 
be connected with an internal power struggle in the milieu, but 
apparently nothing incriminating was found during the search of 
the conference room and the arrested Kurds were released from 
custody in Valby the same evening after they had been identified. 
<H5>  Motives </H5>
  According to the police, the motive for the attempted murder 
of the currently unemployed Yilmaz should be sought in his 
activity as leader of the Kurdistan Committee, the group in 
Denmark that speaks for the terrorist Kurdish separatist 
organization, PKK. 
  Yilmaz has continually written letters to the newspapers 
(the 
most recent one appeared in WEEKENDAVISEN on 7 January) and made 
political statements defending both the PKK's war in Turkey and 
militant Kurdish activism aimed at Turkish interests in other 
countries. When two asylum-seeking Turks of Kurdish descent 
participated in an internationally coordinated PKK action 
involving attempted arson at Turkish Airlines and two Turkish 
national offices for tourism and trade in Copenhagen on 4 
November last year, Yilmaz told JYLLANDS-POSTEN: "I am convinced 
that there will be more attacks." 
  Immediately after the police searched the premises in 
Vesterbro, Yilmaz's political comrades in arms aimed their fire 
at the Turkish Embassy, which was accused of being behind the 
murder attempt. Spokesman Ali Celik stated that "the Turkish 
Embassy is behind this. They have the power for it and they 
carried it out." 
  Kemal Koc also made a statement to DR-TV [Danish 
Television]. 
He has previously been affiliated with the urban guerilla group 
Dev Sol [expansion unknown], which specialized in the execution 
of policemen in Turkey. The 36-year-old Norrebro storekeeper is 
now one of the Kurdistan Committee's leading figures. He stated 
as a fact that "over 30 members of the Turkish intelligence 
service work at the Turkish Embassy under diplomatic immunity." 
Faruk Logoglu, Turkey's ambassador, responded by condemning 
criminal behavior and urging the Kurdistan Committee to go to 
the police with any evidence it has of the embassy's involvement. 
  So far no evidence has been forthcoming and there is a 
similar lack of evidence on the international level that the 
PKK's adversaries in Turkey resort to liquidations outside the 
borders of their country. Right-wing extremist Alpaslan Turkes' 
terrorist organization, the Gray Wolves, has members in Germany 
and has the fanaticism to carry out assassinations. But the 
organization does not have a foothold in Denmark, where the 
majority of Turkish immigrants are of Kurdish descent. Another 
of the PKK's mortal enemies, the fundamentalist 
Hizbollah-contra, carries out liquidations in Turkey, but is not 
known to be active outside the country. 
  On the other hand there are numerous examples showing that 
the PKK executes its dissidents and deserters both inside and 
outside Turkey. A rank-and-file dissident, Mustafa Tanguner, was 
liquidated by the PKK in Brondby in November 1985 and one of the 
PKK's powerful defectors, lawyer and European affairs spokesman 
Huseyin Yildirim, survived the PKK's attempt to liquidate him in 
the Netherlands in 1989 by the skin of his teeth. PKK chief 
Abdullah Ocalan's wife, Kesire, escaped her death sentence by 
going into underground exile in Sweden. 
  After numerous examples of internationally coordinated 
assassination attempts and acts of violence, the PKK and scores 
of its subsidiary organizations were banned as terrorist groups 
in France and Germany in November 1993. Both countries have 
furnished the PKK with idealistic cannon fodder for years in the 
form of young second-generation immigrants who worked in Kurdish 
cultural societies, for example, and were then recruited to the 
organization's army, the ARGK [People's Liberation Army of 
Kurdistan]. 
  The two countries' decision to ban the PKK was also based on 
evidence of the organization's extensive involvement in the 
smuggling and sale of drugs and the PKK's systematic extortion 
of money from business people and wage-earning Turkish 
immigrants in Europe. On 30 January of this year, for instance, 
four men with ties to the PKK were arrested in Marseilles and 
charged with extorting money from other immigrants. The chief of 
the criminal police in Bayern said a week ago that many Kurds 
are still being beaten or threatened with death if they do not 
pay up. 
  After the attack on Yilmaz, Kurdistan Committee spokesman 
Zeynel Cevik told DR-TV that the committee's support of the PKK 
"does not include financial support." But in an interview with 
WEEKENDAVISEN on 9 November 1992 another committee spokesman, 
Ali Celik, made no secret of the fact that the PKK receives 
billions of kroner annually from Kurds in Europe. Presented with 
statements from Kurds living in Denmark who said they did not 
feel safe unless they paid up, he replied: "The tax people don't 
like it if you don't pay your taxes." 
  The latest information WEEKENDAVISEN has gathered from 
sources in the Turkish immigrant community continues to give the 
impression that the donations are not entirely voluntary. On the 
contrary, the PKK is said to have stepped up its demands for 
money from Turkish Kurds in Denmark recently. 
  The motive for the attempt on the life of the Kurdistan 
Committee's leader, Imdat Yilmaz, may lie in one or more of the 
above-mentioned circumstances. 
<H5>  Smoke Screen </H5>
  The PKK milieu, which opposes the country's lawful 
authorities, is organized in a number of associations under 
names that include words like "Kurdish," "workers," "culture" 
and "society." And immediately after the assassination attempt, 
Kurdistan Committee spokesmen reacted against the police 
statement that Yilmaz is chairman of the committee. An attempt 
was made to tone down his political position with assertions 
that he merely has ties to one of the Kurdish community's 
cultural societies. But these statements do not tally with the 
fact that the telephone number at the Kurdistan Committee's new 
address at 1 Dannebrogsgade in the Vesterbro district in 
Copenhagen is listed with the Copenhagen Telephone Company 
(KTAS) in Yilmaz's name. 
  Nor do they tally with the fact that Yilmaz publicly turned 
up to meet the PKK-friendly Kurdish members of the Turkish 
parliament, Leya Zana and Ali Yigit, when they visited the 
Danish Folketing on 14 January. Yilmaz's prominent position is 
further underlined by the fact that he has served as editor of 
the Kurdistan Committee's propaganda paper, KURDISTAN RAPPORT. 
The paper was originally called NYT FRA KURDISTAN and was the 
official organ of the PKK front organization ERNK (Eniya 
Rizgaria Netewa Kurdistan [National Liberation Front of 
Kurdistan]). 
  Yilmaz comes from the village of Bulduk and thus, like other 
leading PKK stalwarts in Denmark, from the area around 
Cihanbeyli in Konya Province in central Anatolia. The 
authorities in Konya have never issued Imdat Yilmaz a passport. 
But he has a high status in Kurdish circles in Denmark, as could 
be seen in an internal election held in Copenhagen between 20 
and 22 November 1992 when he was the official candidate for a 
seat in Kurdistan Ulusal Meclisi (KUM), Kurdistan's so-called 
National Assembly -- an illegal "parliament" that is the PKK's 
attempt to give its terrorist activities a legalistic gloss 
outside the area of southeastern Anatolia that they want to 
secede from Turkey. 
  The PKK's branches in Europe have openly expressed 
solidarity 
with Northern Ireland's IRA, among others, and have been in 
contact in London with the drug-financed Peruvian guerilla army, 
the Shining Path. And in Denmark too they cooperate with 
pro-terrorist figures on the extreme left. Among other things, 
Yilmaz has been in close contact with Austrian Alfred Lang's 
sect of Autonome Revolutionaire, whose now closed store at 12 
Blagardsgade in Norrebro was used for PKK propaganda meetings. 
  As editor of KURDISTAN RAPPORT Yilmaz also worked with 
people 
linked to the militant "anti-imperialist" group, the Red 
Brigade, which applauds armed struggle and bank robberies, and 
in solidarity with the PKK committed acts of vandalism that 
caused over 300,000 kroner worth of damage to two Turkish 
national offices in Copenhagen on 2 April 1992. 
  The PKK can mobilize many hundreds of sympathizers for 
demonstrations in Copenhagen. But out of approximately 18,000 
Turks of Kurdish descent in Denmark only 2,155 voted in what the 
Kurdistan Committee regarded as the successful candidate 
selection for the "Kurdistan National Assembly" in November 
1992, in which Kemal Koc was victorious. Thus despite claims to 
be identical with the "Kurds in Denmark" -- as the PKK wrote in 
a flyer following an act of vandalism against Turkish Airlines 
on 22 August 1992 -- the PKK's Danish front organization is far 
from being able to count on the support of all Denmark Turkish 
Kurds.

    [Editorial Report] During the week from 9 to 15 April, the 
German media carried several reports on right-wing extremist 
activities in Germany. 
  On 11 April Munich ARD Television Network in German at 1730 
GMT, in its "Report" series, carries an 8-minute report by 
Stefan Rocker and Oliver Merz about the current boom of those 
who deny that Jews were killed in Auschwitz after the Federal 
Court of Justice ruling that denying the existence of the 
Holocaust is not a punishable act in itself. 
  The report begins with clips of various events, among which 
is one organized by the National Democratic Party (NPD), where 
the Holocaust is denied. 
  As an example of brochures denying the Holocaust, the report 
cites a "pseudoscientific" report by Germar Rudolf, who was 
formerly employed by the renowned Max-Planck Institute in 
Stuttgart and who now uses the name of the Max-Planck Institute 
to try to give his report -- called "Blaubuch" (The Blue Book) 
after the infamous Auschwitz gas Cyclone-B -- some scientific 
plausibility. Rudolf also pretends to have received scientific 
support by the well-known chemical company Degussa and the 
Fresenius Institute. The reporter says that there is "a new 
method used by right-wing extremists to abuse names." Rudolf 
was fired by the Max-Planck Institute when they found out that 
he had abused their name, and now the Public Prosecutor's Office 
is investigating him for incitement. 
  In Tuebingen, the (Grabert) Publishing Company is located, 
which prints right-wing extremist material. A few months ago 
"Lectures on Contemporary History" by Ernst Gauss was published, 
which is basically the Rudolf report with a few changes -- Gauss 
is Germar Rudolf's pseudonym. The author claims that the 
infamous selections in Auschwitz did not lead to the gas 
chambers but were only intended to "get better medical treatment 
for sick Jews." 
  The reporter notes that revisionism is not just advocated by 
a few fascist sectarians but that it is becoming dangerous 
because of "the growing circle of bourgeois sympathizers." 
  At a recent meeting of the Thomas-Dehler Foundation in 
Nuremberg, which is affiliated to the Free Democratic Party of 
Germany, the chairman invited a Swiss who denied the existence 
of the Holocaust at a seminar on revisionism. He was 
accompanied by half a dozen right-wing extremists, including 
Germar Rudolf. The Swiss speaker was sentenced for incitement 
three weeks ago. Georg Batz, the chairman of the Thomas-Dehler 
Foundation, says that he had invited him only to give a neutral 
overview of revisionist theses -- a "naive" plan, as the 
reporter notes. 
  Since then right-wing extremists have been disseminating the 
20-page lecture by the Swiss under the name of the Thomas-Dehler 
Foundation. 
  JUNGE FREIHEIT (YOUNG FREEDOM), a weekly, is becoming 
increasingly popular and is "a skillful attempt to forge a link 
between right-wing extremists and conservatives." The report 
gives a few quotes from this weekly, showing that it spreads 
right-wing extremist ideas. 
  The report concludes with clips on Internet, "the world's 
largest computer network with millions of business, scientific, 
and private users," where right-wing extremists are now 
spreading their ideas. For some weeks the complete writings of 
those who deny the existence of the Holocaust have been 
available on computer. 
  This report is followed by a six-minute report by Thomas 
Leif 
on the so-called "Komm Mit" (Come With Me) calendar, which has 
been distributed by Catholic priests to their altar boys as a 
present for almost 40 years. Now it has been discovered that 
this calendar is full of fascist ideas (for instance, it 
publishes all the verses of the Germany Song with "Deutschland 
Ueber Alles", shows a map of Greater Germany with the areas lost 
in World War II, and "agitates" against German collective guilt 
for Nazism, etc.). The Catholic Church denies any 
responsibility for this calendar. The bishops of Mainz and 
Trier have distanced themselves from the publishing company that 
distributes it. 
  On the same day the weekly FOCUS in German reports that Uwe 
Goller, land chairman and leading candidate of the North Rhine- 
Westphalian Republikaner for the European elections, has 
obviously covered up that party colleagues of his were involved 
in an attack on an asylum-seekers' hostel in Bergheim near 
Cologne on 7 October 1993. (filed as au1304091594) 
  On 12 April Bonn DIE WELT in German reports that the first 
Hamburg Protection of the Constitution report classifies the 
right-wing extremist Republikaner as right-wing extremists and 
thus hostile to the constitution. "For us the Republikaner are 
a part of right-wing extremism," Ernst Uhrlau, head of the 
Hamburg Office for the Protection of the Constitution said on 11 
April. Hamburg will continue to watch the party using 
intelligence service techniques. Hamburg was the first land that 
began to watch the Republikaner, in January 1990. 
  On 12 April Hamburg DPA in German reports at 1541 GMT that 
the Baden-Wuerttemberg Administrative Court in Mannheim has 
confirmed the ban of the right-wing extremist "German 
Association Loyal to the Homeland" (Heimattreue Vereinigung 
Deutschlands), which was issued by Baden-Wuerttemberg last 
summer, because the group had acted "militantly and 
aggressively" against the constitutional order. The court 
substantiated its ruling, which was published on 12 April by 
noting that the association had been rightly banned because "in 
its program and its ideas it shows features that are related to 
Nazism." 
  On the same day at 1859 GMT DPA reports that Ignatz Bubis, 
chairman of the Central Council of Jews in Germany, again said 
that he does not want to sue Republikaner Chairman Schoenhuber. 
He justified this decision by saying that "someone like Mr. 
Schoenhuber cannot insult me." Bubis also said that the Central 
Council of Jews in Germany will not act against Schoenhuber 
because of his claim that Bubis is one of the "worst inciters of 
people in Germany." 
  During a lecture in Koblenz on 12 April in the evening, 
Bubis 
said that, in his view, about 15 percent of the people in 
Germany are anti-Semitic and another 15 percent are "latently 
anti-Semitic." The chairman of the Central Council of Jews 
advocated the view that "hostility toward Jews has not increased 
over the past years but now it is shown more openly." 
On 13 April DPA reports at 1406 GMT that the Christian 
Democratic Union, Social Democratic Party of Germany, Greens, 
and Free Democratic Party of Germany in the Baden-Wuerttemberg 
Landtag expressly came out against a ban on the right-wing 
extremist Republikaner. At the same time, speakers from these 
four groups accused the Republikaner of being "intellectual 
arsonists" for hatred against foreigners, arson attacks, and 
anti-Semitism. The politicians also agreed that Constitutional 
Protection is right in watching the party. The Republikaner, 
who are represented in the Baden-Wuerttemberg Landtag with 15 
deputies, said that a campaign of stigmatization against their 
party is under way. 
  Minister President Erwin Teufel demanded that "democrats 
must 
struggle against the extremists with political means." The 
reason for the debate was the statement by Republikaner chairman 
Franz Schoenhuber, accusing Jewish leader Ignatz Bubis of being 
"one of the worst instigators of people in Germany." Teufel 
commented: "Victims are turned into perpetrators. There is 
nothing more perverse and impudent." 
  Republikaner Landtag group chairman Rolf Schlierer refused 
to 
distance himself from Schoenhuber's words. He claimed that the 
accusation against Bubis is justified, since Bubis was the one 
to start the matter when he claimed that the Republikaner were 
involved in arson attacks. Schlierer demanded that Bubis 
retract his accusations. 
  On 13 April DPA reports at 1628 GMT that the Republikaner in 
Saxony will be watched by the Land Office for the Protection of 
the Constitution through intelligence service methods from now 
on. Leading members of the Republikaner in Saxony are already 
closely cooperating with neo-Nazis, Interior Minister Heinz 
Eggert said in Dresden. (filed as au1304185494) 
  On 14 April DIE WELT reports that neo-Nazis and right-wing 
extremists have offered the Republikaner "sensible action 
alliances" and "active election support" for the Bundestag 
elections. (filed as au1404150094) 
  On the same day DPA reports at 1118 GMT that the 1993 report 
by the Federal Office for the Protection of the Constitution 
says that in 1993 right-wing extremist and left-wing extremist 
crimes increased further. (filed as au1404134294) 
  At 1402 GMT on 14 April DPA reports that right-wing 
extremists have terrorized foreigners and Jews in Nuremberg with 
forged "notices of deportation." According to information 
released by the police on 14 April, at least 11 people have 
received forged notices, which threaten them with deportation, 
carried out, if necessary, by police or military. Bavarian 
Interior Minister Guenther Beckstein spoke of "most evil 
instigation of people" and announced that the police will carry 
out a thorough investigation. 
  According to DPA, which obtained one of the forged notices, 
the notices use the letterhead of the Federal Office for the 
Recognition of Foreign Refugees and the heraldic eagle and read 
as follows: "In view of the precarious financial situation of 
our nation we cannot and do not want to afford your 
cost-intensive presence any longer." The letter adds that anyone 
who "cannot prove their Aryan origins" in line with "Article 41, 
Section 4 ARG (Foreigners' Returnee Law)," must leave the FRG 
immediately or will be "deported by force." "Appropriate means 
of transportation are ready" at the Nuremberg cargo railroad 
station. 
  Arno Hamburger, chairman of the Jewish Community in 
Nuremberg, was shocked by the forged notices. "This is 
particularly bad if someone who was deported from a cargo 
railroad station in the past gets such a notice." He has never 
heard of comparable action "in this massive, impudent, criminal 
form." In particular the conclusion of the letter has caused 
shock and outrage, which threatens anyone "who does not listen 
to reason" with a "solution" for which this person "then has to 
blame himself," police say. Addressees of the letters, which 
were all posted in Nuremberg and also use the term "deportation 
law," were members of the Jewish community, Yugoslavs, Turks, 
Syrians, Libyans, and Vietnamese. Some of them have filed a 
complaint against unknown perpetrators. 
  A police spokesman said that the letters come from the 
right-wing extremist scene but investigations have not yet had 
any result. 
  At 1442 GMT on 14 April DPA reports that all parties in the 
Bundestag have condemned the arson attack on the synagogue in 
Luebeck. (filed as au1404154794). 
  On 14 April at 1703 GMT DPA reports that a 25-year-old man 
from the Frankfurt/Main area, who had been arrested at the 
beginning of February as a co-author of the neo-Nazi brochure 
DER EINBLICK, has been released again. This is because the 
current state of investigations does not permit urgent suspicion 
that the man was involved in the founding of a criminal 
association, which presupposes the association of at least three 
persons. Even though the chief prosecutor general had applied 
for maintaining the arrest warrant, the investigating judge of 
the Federal Court of Justice canceled the warrant. 
  On 15 April at 1039 GMT, DPA carries a report similar to the 
above, noting that investigators are increasingly helpless 
regarding the suspected authors of DER EINBLICK. According to 
Constitutional Protection, the 25-year-old man who was released 
reportedly was a member of the right-wing extremist "Taunus 
Front," which was founded in Hofheim in 1985. Police now hope 
that investigations of at least another four suspects from 
Hesse, Rhineland-Palatinate, and Bavaria will be more successful. 
  On the same day Munich SUEDDEUTSCHE ZEITUNG reports that 
Interior Minister Kanther has announced that the Federal Office 
for the Protection of the Constitution will observe the 
Republikaner more closely. Indications that the Republikaner 
are to be rated as right-wing extremist are getting stronger. 
  At 1431 GMT on 15 April DPA reports that Hamburg journalist 
Joachim Siegerist, managing chairman of "The German 
Conservatives" association, was sentenced to 18 months in prison 
for statements made against Sinti and Romanyi gypsies. The 
court found the 47-year-old journalist guilty of instigating 
people, incitement of xenophobia, and insult. 
  In 1992 Siegerist had written two letters with racist 
contents on behalf of his association and sent it to many 
people. The 48-year-old manager of the association was a 
co-defendant in the trial; the court sentenced him to a 
suspended sentence of eight months and a fine of 25,000 marks. 
In pamphlet which had a print-run of 18,000 copies, the 
defendant had slandered Romanyi and Sinti gypsies as, among 
other things, an "evil, criminal pack." 
  At 1532 GMT on 15 April DPA reports that Glenn Goertz, 
federal manager of the right-wing extremist Liberal German 
Workers Party (FAP), and seven other right-wing extremists were 
arrested in Hamburg in the afternoon. In their cars police 
discovered striking tools, signal ammunition, and neo-Nazi 
propaganda material. At the same time, about 1,000 people 
demonstrated against a "National Info Telephone," which is 
operated by the FAP. In the vicinity of the demonstration 
another 20 to 25 right-wing extremists were detained. On 25 
March the Hamburg public prosecutor's office had impounded the 
"National Info Telephone," but the FAP established a new one. 
  Among the eight arrested right-wing extremists is also 
Hamburg FAP chairman Andre Goertz, the brother of the FAP 
federal manager. Glenn Goertz was reportedly disguised when he 
was arrested.

  [Excerpt] Karlsruhe (DPA) -- According to information 
released by the chief federal prosecutor's office, two vehicles, 
possibly used by the Red Army Faction (RAF) in attacks, have 
been found. A Karlsruhe Office press release on Thursday [14 
April] says that the vehicles, found on 2 February and 14 March, 
are registered to Klaus Steinmetz, liaison man of the Federal 
Office for the Protection of the Constitution, whose information 
led to the bloody antiterrorist operation in Bad Kleinen. 
  Already, on 24 March, the chief federal prosecutor initiated 
investigations of unknown perpetrators on suspicion of RAF 
membership and causing a bomb explosion. A passenger car and a 
motorcycle were discovered. The chief federal prosecutor's 
office did not reveal where the vehicles were found. Both 
vehicles have reportedly been used "by a great number of 
persons" in the past. Technical analysis of the passenger car 
turned up evidence that might indicate its use for terrorist 
crimes.

  [Excerpt] Berlin (DPA) -- According to an intelligence 
service note, the Mykonos attack in Berlin was allegedly planned 
in the Iranian Embassy in Bonn. On Thursday [14 April] during 
the trial at the Berlin Court concerning the attack [on the 
Mykonos restaurant in Berlin on 17 September 1992, which killed 
four Iranian opposition members] Joint Plaintiff Axel Jeschke 
quoted from an intelligence service document: "Several clues 
from a particularly reliable source lead one to conclude that 
the Mykonos attack was prepared in the Embassy under the code 
term Bozorg Alavi." Bernd Schmidbauer (Christian Democratic 
Union), coordinator for intelligence services in the 
chancellor's office, stated as a witness, when asked by Jeschke, 
that he could not recall such a paper. 
  On the fringe of the trial, Jeschke told journalists that 
the 
court files are not complete. "Not all documents have been put 
on the table." In contrast, Schmidbauer insisted that, as far 
as he knows, all relevant papers and information provided by the 
intelligence services have been made available to the court.

<F P=106> [Unattributed report: "New RAF Suspicion"] </F>
  [Text] Klaus Steinmetz, the spy for the Federal Office for 
the Protection of the Constitution [BfV], who brought the 
security authorities to the trace of suspected terrorists Birgit 
Hogefeld and Wolfgang Grams and thus caused the police operation 
in Bad Kleinen, is suspected of having perhaps been involved in 
crimes committed by the Red Army Faction (RAF) after all. In 
February and March two vehicles were discovered, which were 
registered to Steinmetz in the past: a Honda Civic passenger 
car and a Suzuki 750 motorcycle. According to the chief federal 
prosecutor's office, both vehicles might have been used by the 
RAF for attacks. 
  According to findings by the Hesse police, the motorcycle 
might have been used for escape in six bank robberies. In the 
car investigators found traces of the explosive element 
nitropenta, among others on gloves that had been left in the 
car. Such traces were also found by investigators after the 
blowing up of the new prison in Weiterstadt near Darmstadt in 
March 1993, for which the RAF claimed responsibility. 
  At first, Steinmetz told the BfV that he had known about the 
attack on the prison. Later on, however, he denied this self- 
incrimination and presented an alibi. Since the authorities do 
not know which of his versions is correct, there are 
comprehensive checks being conducted at the moment. Thus, it 
was noticed that traces of saliva on cigarette butts which were 
found in Steinmetz' car are identical to traces on butts which 
were found in connection with the Weiterstadt case. Whether the 
butt really came from the liaison man is now supposed to be 
clarified by producing a so-called genetic fingerprint. The 
blood sample necessary for that is available: Some time ago, 
Steinmetz voluntarily agreed to have a blood sample taken, 
because he believed that as a witness he need not fear anything. 
  Since the car and the motorcycle were used by many members 
of 
the autonomous scene before and after the operation in Bad 
Kleinen, a new investigation by the chief prosecutor's office is 
aimed against unknown persons at the moment. Ex-liaison man 
Steinmetz lives in an unknown place with a new identity.

<F P=106> [Unattributed report: "Mysterious Death in Libya"] </F>
  [Text] Being guessed at in the Federal Office for the 
Protection of the Constitution [BfV]: How did a high-ranking 
BfV official and his wife die in Libya? Silvian Becker, section 
head of BfV Department six (international terrorism), died in a 
military hospital in Tripoli the week before last. At the time 
of going to press, details of the circumstances, also regarding 
his wife's death, were still unknown to German officials; the 
bodies had not yet been released by Libya. 
  Becker had told the BfV in Cologne that he was going to 
Egypt 
for a vacation. A passenger car, which had obviously been used 
by the couple, was found undamaged in Tripoli. There is a basic 
ban on travel to Libya for all BfV employees. The BfV is 
wondering whether the tourists were kidnapped or enticed away 
from Egypt. Relatives claim that the Beckers went to Libya via 
Tunisia. The official was highly valued as an expert on the 
Middle East and northern Africa. His colleagues describe him as 
a "prudent man, and not an adventurous type." A double agent? 
"Very unlikely if you knew him," it is said in Cologne.

<F P=106> [Unattributed article: "A Web With Many Spiders"] </F>
  [Text] The color photograph, 15 centimeters by 18 
centimeters, only shows the scorched fragment of a green 
synthetic resin board. It looks like nothing at all, the 
fragment is no larger than a fingernail. Only an enlargement 
reveals the soldering typical of a circuit board. 
  The photograph of plastic casing consisting of two parts 
also 
does not reveal much at first sight. The upper and lower parts 
are connected by a cable. Two dials, which have been affixed to 
the piece of plastic, are not visible on the outside. 
  Electronics experts immediately know what this means. The 
synthetic material is bottom plate [Platine] and the two dials 
allow for programming of a timer. This kind of timer is 
essential for the precise detonation of a bomb. 
  Men who display Victorian discretion have been presenting 
the photographs during secret investigations in Berlin for 
months. Scouts from secret services all over the world have been 
flocking together: It is almost like the coldest days of the 
Cold War when Berlin was the spy capital. 
  It is a home game for German investigators. Officials from 
the Cologne-based Federal Office for the Protection of the 
Constitution, colleagues from the State Protection Office, 
investigators from the Wiesbaden Federal Office of Criminal 
Investigations Office (BKA), and prosecutors from Frankfurt and 
Berlin are trying to solve the most mysterious crime story of 
recent years: the story of the timer. 
  The timer, which is not even worth 400 German marks [DM], is 
what the Americans term a "smoking gun" -- an irrefutable piece 
of evidence. The only question is: In whose hands was it? The 
timer was used by terrorists to detonate the bomb that ripped to 
pieces the Pan Am jumbo jet "Maid of the Seas" over the Scottish 
village of Lockerbie on 21 December 1988. All 259 passengers, 
primarily U.S. citizens, died; 11 inhabitants of Lockerbie were 
killed by falling wreckage. There were 270 victims altogether. 
  Lockerbie -- the placename has become a synonym for lunatic 
international terrorism. For many, the case was considered 
officially solved, at least until now. 
  In 1991, American and British investigative authorities 
revealed that Libyan secret service agents Amin Chalifa Fuheima, 
who was 35 at the time, and Abd-el-Bassit Ali el-Mikrahi, who 
was 39, were behind the Boeing 747 crash. The sinister villain 
of the international community, the self-proclaimed protector of 
Arab terrorists, Libya's head of state Mu'ammar Qadhdhafi, was 
once again exposed as a murderer. 
  The U.S. Justice Ministry demanded in vain that both 
suspects 
be extradited. The United Nations then imposed an embargo, which 
was intensified in November of last year, against Libya. 
  Now, new facts have shaken the carefully formulated 
construction of the investigators, the indictments that are 
ready in Washington and Edinburgh. Secret service men and 
investigators are talking about a hot "German lead." 
  German Lockerbie prosecutor Volker Rath says: "It threatens 
to jeopardize the charges leveled by the Americans and the 
Scots." The Frankfurter investigator says: "Everyone who is 
familiar with the matter can put one and one together." 
  Rath is even more direct in internal reports prepared for 
his 
top boss, Hesse Justice Minister Christine Hohmann-Dennhardt. 
In short: No German judge would be able to issue an arrest 
warrant for the suspects on the basis of the evidence that has 
been collected to date. 
  Rath, 40, is one of a handful of Lockerbie experts who has 
been working on the case internationally. The Meckenheim BKA, 
which cooperates closely with the American FBI and Scotland 
Yard, has an office in which 450 files are piled high. All of 
them bear a Frankfurt Prosecution Service code number: 50 Js 
42.401/88. 
  Lockerbie was, as Scotland Yard boasts, the "most demanding 
piece of detective work in criminal history." Statements have 
been collected from 15,000 witnesses, 20,000 names have been 
checked, 35,000 photographs assessed, and 180,000 items of 
evidence examined. 
  A German lead in the west came up early on: It is highly 
probable that the deadly cargo came from Frankfurt. According 
to the investigators reconstruction, the suitcase containing the 
bomb -- it was unaccompanied luggage transported by Air Malta 
from that Mediterranean island -- found its way into the German 
air traffic network on the morning of 21 December 1988. 
  At 1307 hours [local time], a computer issued the code 
number 
B 8849 for the bronze colored Samsonite suitcase. The suitcase 
containing the bomb was then checked onto flight PA 103, 
Frankfurt- London -- where it was to land before the 
trans-Atlantic crossing - between 1512 and 1650 hours. The lead 
that has now electrified everyone did not appear at this point. 
It is completely new and leads to the former Ministry of State 
Security (MfS). 
  Former MfS employees are being questioned. Over the past few 
days, prominent names have appeared on the list of witnesses who 
still have to be questioned. 
  Thus, the prosecution service not only wants to question 
former Politburo members, but also Honecker successor Egon 
Krenz. The point at issue is: Who handed over the timer to 
whom and for what purpose? 
  It is true that no one has expressed the bold suspicion that 
the horrific Lockerbie bloodbath was the work of the Stasi, 
which wanted to perform a service for allied Arab organizations, 
but there already is talk of possible complicity in the murder 
of several hundred people. 
  One thing is certain: Detonation devices of the Lockerbie 
type were found in the possession of the state security 
department -- that is very compelling evidence. The results of 
the investigation to date must be reappraised. 
  From the very beginning, the key to the Lockerbie mystery 
was 
that piece of bottom plate that investigators found on 13 
January 1989 after a laborious search of the wreckage of the 
aircraft, which had been ripped apart. It turned up in the 
wrecked suitcase of terror victim Karen Noonan, having burned a 
hole in the collar of a shirt and embedded itself in it. 
  Technicians removed the fragment with tweezers. After weeks 
of detailed work, Scottish specialist Thomas Hayes identified 
the piece of plastic with production code number PT 30 as part 
of a detonator. 
While those leveling the charges place him firmly on the 
Libyan side, he was secretly involved in procurement for the GDR 
above all: He was a Stasi Unofficial Agent (IM) codenamed 
"Rubin" and procured highly sensitive goods over decades. At 
the MfS, he was registered under filename 2550/70 and there are 
six thick files chronicling his successes. 
  The papers on this gem among embargo busters, who procure 
forbidden goods worldwide and use cunning means to have those 
goods smuggled to recipient countries, were -- what a surprise 
-- destroyed during the confusion of the 1989 and 1990 
changeover. Bollier was to have begun the new era without being 
incriminated in any way. 
  The Swiss businessman has been behaving as if he knew 
nothing 
at all. He claims that he first learned from SPIEGEL "that I 
had been assigned a codename. All the business I conducted was 
concluded under my official name or official company names." 
  He had sworn dedication to the Libyans, but was not 
selective 
in seeking other employers if they had the money to throw 
around. Bollier, the servant of many masters, was not committed 
to any country or political conviction, but only to himself: 
Business with the east promised piles of loot, especially at 
the high point of the Cold War. 
  It is in keeping with Bollier's character that he did not 
have to be recruited like a common spy, but offered his services 
to the Stasi. At that time, at the end of the 1960's, there was 
great demand for electronic equipment on the part of the GDR. 
In Erich Mielke's Ministry of State Security, a special unit -- 
Department III -- had just been created to listen in on western 
German telephone communications. 
  Bollier had dinner at the "Stadt Berlin" Interhotel with 
department chief Horst Maennchen. The two, each of whom was a 
specialist in his own field, soon agreed on business. 
  The Swiss supplied special aerials, coders, police 
communications systems, and computer terminals. Maennchen's 
department took everything. More and more employees had to be 
supplied with technology, and in the end, the Stasi employed 
over 3,000 people in the interception of telephone 
communications. 
  IM Rubin travelled to the GDR almost every month. To report 
his arrival, Bollier just had to dial the East Berlin telephone 
number 5 59 49 48: This special line that had been set up for 
him ended on the desk of his officer in the "Foreign Operatives" 
department. 
  There were no passport or customs controls for Bollier. 
During conversations at a Stasi villa in the Berlin embassy 
quarter of Pankow, order lists were checked off and new orders 
placed. The MfS paid cash, Western marks. A former Stasis 
officer says that "Bollier earned over 1 million marks from us." 
He would also come up with equipment, the procurement of which 
almost seemed impossible. When the KGB was pressurizing the 
fraternal East German secret service to acquire encrypting 
machines produced by the Swiss Crypto AG company, IM Rubin 
promptly carried out the job for a fee of DM120,000. 
  The Swiss firm also had excellent contacts with western 
services: Bollier was able to obtain highly secret equipment 
using various complex ways and means. Thus, he supplied the 
Main Intelligence Administration, Stasi General Markus Wolf's 
team of spies, with a well-guarded American secret: the "Mark" 
voice analysis machine. 
  The appliance is similar to a lie detector and registers the 
slightest changes in a voice. Wolf wanted to use it to test his 
agents' honesty. 
  GDR secret service officers became suspicious that the Swiss 
only needed weeks to acquire such sought after espionage 
equipment from the United States. Thus, Wolf's spies were to 
find out for whom Bollier really worked. 
  The attempt failed. Bollier travelled constantly and could 
not be shadowed well enough. A former Stasi officer told German 
investigators that "it was not possible to obtain tangible 
results in view of the enormous amount of travel that Bollier 
conducted." 
  The MfS was not sure: Bollier might also be working for a 
western secret service, "probably the CIA," is what an internal 
report stated. After they had had dinner together, the 
assessment of IM Rubin arrived at by Colonel Gerhard Hoeferer, 
Maennchen's deputy, was: "He is a double agent." 
The Lockerbie bomb corresponded almost exactly to the infernal 
device that a group of militant Palestinians had build two 
months previously in the Rhineland town of Neus. In both cases, 
the explosive was Semtex H, which had been affixed inside a 
Toshiba radio recorder with fiendish cunning. 
  The difference between the two devices was: The Palestinian 
group in Neus had used a barometric detonator which would have 
resulted in an explosion if there had been a change in air 
pressure, if, for example, an aircraft reached a certain height. 
For a long time, the North Rhine-Westphalian terrorist group, 
which came under the Syrian protective umbrella, was considered 
the main suspect. 
  However, when it became clear beyond any doubt that the 
explosive on flight PA 103 was detonated by a simple timer, the 
investigations proceeded in a different direction. 
  Analyses conducted by the CIA led investigators to the 
actual manufacturer: the Zurich-based Mebo AG company. It 
trades in electronic appliances of all kinds. The timer was one 
of the company's own production lines, type MST-13, which was 
developed for the Libyans for use in desert warfare in 1985 and 
was resistant to dust and water. 
  According to what the CIA has established, a mechanism of 
this kind was used in the attack on the American Embassy in Togo 
in 1986. Two Libyans were arrested in connection with that in 
Senegal in February 1988: They had about 10 kilograms of 
plastic explosives and two MST-13 timers in their possession. 
The name of the manufacturing company had been removed, but 
using a special process, it was possible to make the name on the 
parts visible again: Mebo. 
  Almost 2 dozen units of this kind were produced, supposedly 
for Qadhdhafi's assistants. The fact that Mebo does substantial 
business with the Libyans was considered a very significant 
piece of evidence by the accusing parties. Mebo managers told 
the CIA as well as American and British Lockerbie investigators 
that the timers were sold solely to Tripoli and the Libyan 
People's Bureau in East Berlin. The charges against the two 
suspects depend very heavily on this statement. 
  However, the Mebo version turned out to be a smokescreen, 
perhaps even a false trail that had been deliberately laid. 
Edwin Bollier, 56, one of Mebo's two executive directors, 
apparently remembered just 6 months ago that he had had two 
other customers, from "the Institute for Technical Research or 
something similar in East Berlin," confided Bollier to 
investigators. 
  People of Bollier's kind might well have been familiar with 
the GDR's Institute of Technical Research: It was a security 
service workshop for the production of all kinds of items of 
equipment used by agents: listening and detection devices. 
  The investigators then believed that the Bollier had allowed 
himself to be bought by the Libyans -- anything is possible in 
the Orient -- and had made the statement to exonerate state 
terrorist Qadhdhafi. The Arabs had generously reimbursed his 
expenses. 
  The investigators also took careful note of the fact that in 
January, during the Geneva meeting between U.S. President 
Clinton and the Syrian head of state Hafiz el-Assad at the 
"President" Hotel, a colorful group turned up for a meeting: 
the four-man international Libyan defense team, including 
London lawyer Stephen M. Mitchell and American attorney Frank 
Rubino. 
  The spokesman for the group was the Libyan lawyer Ibrahim 
Legwell. Bollier also logically made his way to Geneva and 
revealed further details about the sale of Mebo timers to East 
Berlin. Mitchell said: "He always has something new to say." 
  The statements made by the Swiss electronics dealer, 
although 
they might continually vary, are essentially correct. 
  It has been clearly established that the Stasi acquired 
timers of the MST-13 type in 1985. The prosecution service 
assumes that Bollier had supplied the GDR with as many as seven 
units. At any rate, that is the quantity that appears in a Mebo 
bill that Bollier says that he suddenly found and has handed 
over to investigators as evidence. 
  In the meantime, former Stasi procurement employees are 
revealing that they had acquired "projector control devices of 
the MST-13 type." The following is an extract from the 
questioning of a former state security officer in Meckenheim: 
  Question: Did you buy the timer? 
  Answer: Yes, I did buy the timer; it was part of 
a package that also included two or three timers with digital 
displays and casings as well as about 10 units without casings. 
In addition, there was also an Italian reddish-brown attache 
case with a built-it transmitter that allowed two frequencies to 
be used for the detonation of explosives, using two receivers 
that were also supplied. We paid between DM30,000 and DM40,000." 
  Other Stasi employees have lent more credence to the German 
lead. On Thursday [14 April] of last week, a former MfS colonel 
who was being questioned by the BKA in Munich discussed the 
question. He ruled out direct and deliberate participation by 
his ministry in the Lockerbie bombing, but the witness went on 
to say that "that would by no means apply to passing on such a 
timer." 
  It has ultimately been proven that the MfS was involved in 
other murders. The latest example was provided last week: 
Stasi anti-terrorism expert Helmut Voigt was sentenced to four 
years imprisonment for participation in the 1983 bombing of the 
Berlin Maison de France (one dead, 22 injured) by virtue of 
having passed on explosives used in the attack. 
  The current theory of sole Libyan involvement, although it 
might fit in very well with the Americans jumbled scheme of 
world politics, has been shattered. It is just as if the 
indictment had been written in invisible ink and the letters 
have now just suddenly disappeared. 
  Lockerbie and the German lead lead directly to the bizarre 
world of secret services, for which deception and subterfuge are 
the elixir of life. The Zurich Mebo boss Edwin Bollier, a 
sinister figure possessed of many talents, fits precisely into 
this picture. He has been playing a game on at least two sides. 
Should a smart multiple agent, who, grotesquely enough, was 
also on the CIA payroll, be finally responsible for the cruel 
death of the mainly American Pan Am passengers? As a 
precaution, the Frankfurt state prosecutor investigated 
"relevant connections" at the Federal Intelligence Service [BND] 
in March -- the answer is still pending. A Stasi defector, 
which the BND released to the Lockerbie investigators, affirmed 
to the BKA officers: "A man like Bollier had hidden protectors 
in the West." Asked aobut CIA contacts, Bollier told DER 
SPIEGEL: "No comment." 
  In the bizarre artificial world of agents and misinformers, 
such entanglements are part of the risks that every principal 
incurs. Nobody trusts anybody, everybody spies on everybody 
else, and traitors buy traitors who give away traitors. 
  So it may happen quite easily that a major affair goes wrong 
and that those who should actually have been protected are 
damaged. 
  Should Bollier have reported to other -- maybe even western 
-- masters about his dealings with the bad guy number one, Al- 
Qadhdhafi? Or should he have assisted the Stasi in what was its 
declared policy at the time, namely to protect the GDR against 
international terrorist attacks -- through cooperation with 
internationally acting terrorist groups? 
  A former Stasi man, who in 1983 became IM Rubin's 
controller, 
might be able to provide information on Bollier's dealings with 
Mielke's men. To the Swiss informer, he introduced himself as 
Joachim Wenzel. 
  A brilliant technician, radio mechanic, and an information 
technology engineer by profession, he was entrusted with unusual 
tasks by the MfS at an early stage: Wenzel built the electronic 
timing device for a bomb, which was to be placed underneath a 
car of a Hamburg refugee smuggler. 
  The former officer has meanwhile been interrogated half a 
dozen times by the BKA. The question and answer game has almost 
become a ritual. Here is the excerpt from one interrogation on 
the timer in the Lockerbie bomb: 
  BKA: Mr. Wenzel, I am showing you here a gray 
plastic case consisting of two pieces, what can you tell us 
about it? 
  Wenzel: This case is of exactly the same design 
as those used by Mr. Bollier for the clocks he sold us. 
  BKA: BKA: When was this version with the control 
wheels provided by Bollier? 
  Wenzel: I am pretty sure that this control clock 
is the last of a series of versions and was presented to us by 
him between March and June 1985. 
  BKA: BKA: Has Bollier made any comment toward you 
in connection with the attack against Pan Am flight 103 over 
Lockerbie? 
  Wenzel: No, not once. 
In a statement dictated to the investigators, Wenzel said 
that, at the MfS, the higher ranks were greatly worried at the 
time that Bollier might have "sold" the timers to "other groups, 
too." The Stasi man: "I was mainly thinking of terrorist 
circles such as the ETA [Basque Fatherland and Liberty], the IRA 
[Irish Republican Army], the RAF [Red Army Faction], and maybe 
even the Libyans." What is certain is that in 1987, Wenzel 
took the timers, which Bollier had provided, along with him to 
his new department on Ferdinand-Schultze street. There, he 
worked in the Main Department XXII: It was responsible for 
anti-terrorist activities and had closest contacts with militant 
Arab groups, but also the West German RAF. 
  The timers have disappeared since then. It is unclear 
whether they were destroyed in the chaos before and after 1989, 
when the Stasi destroyed technological equipment from bugging 
devices to shredders, or whether, still under the responsibility 
of Mielke and Erich Honecker, the timers found their fateful 
destination in the world of international terrorism. 
  There was no shortage of potential buyers. Explosive 
solidarity presents were regarded by Stasi as helpful for 
initiating good relations with all kinds of Arabic terrorist 
groups. A network with many spiders. 
  The Stasi, for example, provided ship loads of lethal 
material to the security department of the PLO, 5,000 hand 
grenades, explosives, 1,000 detonators, and bridging timers 
[Brueckenzuender] in 1980 alone. 
  Yet, even the many splinter groups of the Palestinian 
movement, who plagued the world with murderous terrorist attacks 
for 20 years, found a new base in the GDR. 
  Leading representatives of international gangs frequently 
came to East Berlin. The internationally wanted terrorist 
Carlos, who, according to recent intelligence reports continues 
to live in Damascus under Syrian protection, used to stay in the 
fine Palace Hotel Unter den Linden. The fighters of infamous 
Abu Nidal underwent a three-month training course at the MfS in 
1985, including the launching of missiles and shells. Only a 
few months after the training, the group slaughtered 16 people 
at Rome airport and four at Vienna airport. 
  Abu Dawud, who is believed to be one of the men responsible 
for the massacre at the 1972 Olympic Games in Munich, was also 
attracted by East Berlin. In the 80's, the former terrorist 
resided in the very center of Berlin, at 178 Prenzlauer Allee. 
  The East German intelligence service got more and more 
deeply 
involved in its insidious cooperation with the Arab guerrillas 
-- after all, they were fighting the same enemy. 
  Over whom did the Stasi hold out protective hands, who is 
behind Lockerbie? Was it the Iranians, after all, who wanted to 
take revenge for the unintentional downing of an Airbus by the 
American destroyer "Vincennes" in 1988 above the Strait of 
Hormuz? And were they assisted by the Syrians, who are 
meanwhile high in the favor of the Americans after they stood up 
against Iraq's Saddam Husayn in the Gulf War? 
  The intelligence experts now must go through a new mass of 
theories of conspiracy. The Russian intelligence service, for 
example, is by no means convinced about the American 
investigations according to which Libya alone was responsible. 
  The CIA's most important source was "tapped rumblings of the 
Arabs," as one Russian intelligence service officer said. The 
Americans did not even use the "confidential communications 
channel," which was set up in 1990, to ask Moscow for 
information. 
  And such information would be abundant in a place where the 
archivists of international intelligence service connections on 
Stasi and Arabs, on terrorists and agents, have accumulated 
unique information. Leonid Shebarshin, former head of the 
Soviet foreign intelligence service, was surprised at 
Washington's silence: "They have not asked a single question."

  [Text] The British aircraft carrier (Arc Royal), which was 
anchored in Piraievs last weekend, was to be the third target of 
the 17 November terrorist organziation, which claimed 
responsibility for the attacks against the offices of two 
insurance companies on Kifissia Avenue last night. 
  In a telephone call to a private radio station, 17 November 
stated that it was also going to strike at the aircraft carrier. 
At 1230 today, a passerby accidentally found two 2.30-inch 
rockets in a metal pipe and a firing mechanism on a building 
site along the Miaoulis coast in Piraievs. The rockets were 
defused by explosives experts.

<F P=106> [Report by Charles Miller, Defence Correspondent, PA News] </F>
  [Text] An abortive attempt by Greek terrorists to hit the 
carrier Ark Royal with anti-tank rockets could be linked to 
Britain's support for strikes against the Bosnian Serbs, it was 
disclosed today. 
  It is believed the ultranationalist November 17 guerilla 
group attempted to hit the 20,000-ton carrier with two 88 mm 
rockets as it was docked in the port of Piraeus near Athens. 
  Home-made rocket launchers with rockets and automatic timers 
were found in a field 200 yards from where the ship was docked, 
police said. 
  The search was launched after the guerilla group called a 
radio station to say it had tried to attack the ship, which left 
Piraeus early today after a week's maintenance. 
  Police said they thought the rockets aimed at the Ark Royal 
were set to go off last week but rain had fouled the timers, 
thwarting the attack. 
  The guerrillas also claimed responsibility for a rocket 
attack on a US insurance company and a time-bomb attack on a 
Dutch insurance company today. The blasts caused damage but no 
injuries. 
  Ark Royal and its sister ship Invincible have been 
alternating on six-month tours of duty since January last year 
in the Adriatic as part of Nato's operations to enforce the 
no-fly zone over Bosnia. 
  The operation has been directed primarily at Bosnian Serb 
and 
Serb aircraft and there has been concern in Greece about the 
Nato mission because of deep historical and religious links with 
the Serbs. 
  Ark Royal set sail from Piraeus completely unaware of the 
potentially disastrous failed attack, said Royal Navy officials. 
  A Whitehall source said: "This group of terrorists is 
ultranationalist and, as such, support the Serbs. The 
connection is not too difficult to make."

  [Text] Athens, April 11, IRNA -- Two western insurance 
companies were targets of bomb attacks in the Greek capital 
during the early hours of Monday. The Greek urban guerrilla 
group `17 November' claimed credit for the attacks against the 
U.S. firm 'Aleco' and the Dutch 'National Nederlande' both 
situated on the busy Kifissias Avenue in the suburb of Maroussi. 
  The group used a rocket to hit the building housing `Aleco' 
and placed a time-bomb in the other nearby building in which 
National Nederlande was to move in. The explosions caused 
material damages but nobody was hurt. 
  An anonymous caller told the Greek private radio station 
`Sky' that `17 November' was taking responsibility for the 
attacks. He also claimed that the group had placed a bazooka on 
a British aircraft carrier ten days ago. The carrier `Ark 
Royal' docked in the port of Piraeus since 28 March is to leave 
the harbour Monday. The caller did not give any further 
information and the Greek police have denied any knowledge of 
the incident. 
  It was the fifteenth rocket attack by `17 November'. The 3.5 
inch rockets had been stolen by the group from military depots 
in the past.

  [Text] Several dozen kilos of explosives were found just 
over two hours ago on the outskirts of Rome. It is likely that 
the explosives were to be used in an attack on one of the most 
famous Mafia supergrasses -- Salvatore Totuccio Contorno. The 
supergrass lives in a secret hiding place, which is probably not 
too far from where the explosives were found. Francesco Vitale 
reports from the scene. 
  [Begin Vitale recording] The Mafia has used 70 kilos of 
explosives to relaunch its offensive against the state and Mafia 
supergrasses. 
  This evening fear returned to Rome, three kilometers down 
the 
Via Formellese, at the junction with the Cassia-Bis road. Five 
boxes containing explosives linked up to a car battery were 
placed in a gutter. It was a huge amount of explosives and 
could have caused a massacre. Carabinieri bomb disposal experts 
detonated the explosive device and what you are looking at is 
the crater made by the explosion. 
  Why did the Mafia plant this bomb? The road where the bomb 
was found is one that supergrass Totuccio Contorno uses every 
day. He lives just a few kilometers away. 
  The investigators remain cautious, but it is likely that the 
famous Mafia supergrass was the killers' target. Contorno has 
not collaborated with investigators for some time, but he is 
obviously still the Sicilian Mafia's number one enemy. 
  It is still not known how the bomb was found. It was 
probably reported to the Carabinieri, perhaps by a passer-by. 
Following jailed Mafia boss of bosses Toto Riina's invectives 
against supergrasses, the latest was yesterday afternoon, Cosa 
Nostra has turned from words to deeds. 
  Totuccio Contorno is the supergrass who has paid the highest 
price in terms of human life. The Mafia has killed nearly all 
his relatives, including his cousins three and four times 
removed. Luckily the bomb attack was thwarted, but once again 
Cosa Nostra has shown it can strike undisturbed just as easily 
in Rome as Palermo. [end recording]

<F P=106> [Article by JCH/RHR: "Two Bomb Attacks Against Banks in </F>
Luxembourg"] 
  [Text] Luxembourg, 12 Apr (BELGA) -- During the night from 
Monday to Tuesday, two banks in the Grand-Duchy of Luxembourg 
were damaged by explosions, the legal authorities revealed 
Tuesday. Nobody was injured. 
  At approximately 0040 GMT on Tuesday morning, an explosive 
charge went off in front of the entrance to the Caisse Rurale in 
Bous, which is situated approximately 12 km from the capital, 
near the German-Luxembourg border. One hour later, at 
approximately 0200 GMT, a second explosive charge went off 
outside the entrance to a branch of the Caisse d'Epargne de 
l'Etat in Bridel, in the center of the country, about 10 km away 
from Luxembourg. 
  The door and a few windows were blown to pieces. Nobody was 
injured. No witnesses noticed whether there had been one or 
more terrorists at the site of the explosions. The explosives 
used were stolen from a quarry one week ago. 
  Nobody has claimed responsibility for the attacks. The 
special branch of the gendarmerie and the crime squad are 
conducting an inquiry.

<F P=106> [Article by Sinan Yilmaz: "PKK Lies in Ambush"] </F>
  [Text] Among all the commotion over the local elections, 
the coalition and the stability package, the problem of Turkey's 
Kurds and the Kurdistan Workers' Party (PKK) has been forgotten. 
Certain Army and government officials, declaring that the PKK 
has been rendered ineffective, have hinted a certain victory 
this summer. 
  Despite repetitive attacks by security forces, the PKK 
survived last winter with losses in personnel but little loss of 
support and new recruits. 
  Reports from sources close to the PKK are that once more the 
organization is preparing for a series of spring attacks. 
Observers had mistakenly expected, on the basis of PKK 
statements, that the local elections and Newroz would be 
eventful. Instead, the PKK has not done what it threatened to 
do. Sources close to the organization argue that the reason for 
this partly lies behind PKK leader Abdullah Ocalan's call for a 
cease-fire to the Kurdish Conference held in Brussels last 
month. This, however, is not the whole aspect of the case. The 
main reason for PKK's silence is the unexpected deployment of 
new troops and security forces in the troubled region. 
Approximately, 400,000 soldiers, police officers, special 
teams, intelligence units and village guards are on duty in the 
area. 
  The PKK currently is trying to avoid drawing any attention 
to 
itself and in the process is avoiding organized attacks. It is 
aware that the smallest attack would face a large military 
operation. The organization, not wanting to suffer any further 
losses, chooses to stay inactive or, rather, to lie in wait for 
the time being. 
  The second reason behind this passive mood is that there has 
been an international diplomatic reaction to the issue of 
Turkey's "solution" for the Kurdish problem. Especially the 
lifting of the immunity of pro-Kurdish Democracy Party (DEP) 
deputies, followed by their arrest, has caused concern in 
Western Europe and the United States. It should not be ignored 
that PKK attacks at such a time would not have done the 
organization any good. 
  The fact that the DEP deputies who were expelled from the 
political arena tried to solve the problem through political 
means with contacts with Europe and the United States was also 
effective. 
  When DEP members caused attention to focus on Ocalan's 
proposal for a political solution and the arrest of their 
deputies, the Western world placed more emphasis on their 
demands that a political solution be found to the problem. The 
view of the Western world that Kurds seeking legal solutions 
faced oppression strengthened. 
  Prime Minister Tansu Ciller, who claims that she influenced 
the West in its banning of the PKK, missed one aspect of the 
issue: The Western countries, while stating the reason for the 
banning of the organization, recommended that a political 
solution be found as soon as possible. Recent developments 
imply the time given to Turkey for this is expiring. 
  The lack of violent attacks by the PKK in southeastern 
Turkey 
also implies that the legal and illegal Kurdish movements want 
to boost their "diplomatic drive." The PKK is waiting in 
ambush, ever ready to return to violence. But while waiting, it 
is also planning new tactical policies. 
  Although the PKK claimed that the election results were as 
they had expected them to be, this organization's call for a 
boycott of the March 27 elections was not as successful as it 
predicted. But it has to be admitted that the participation in 
the elections was not as high as the state had thought it would 
be. 
  The PKK is now trying to establish a dialogue with the newly 
elected mayors. According to reports coming from the region, 
the PKK is relaying its demands to the newly elected mayors and 
telling those who refuse to meet these to leave the region. 
Sources claimed this week that Diyarbakir's newly elected 
Welfare Party Mayor Ahmet Bilgin actually wanted to withdraw his 
candidacy before the elections but was prevented from doing so 
under pressure from Regional Governor Unal Erkan. 
  In conclusion, it can be said that despite the blows it has 
received, the PKK has managed this year as well to survive the 
winter. 
  The organization is now laying in ambush, trying to avoid 
the 
blows delivered by Turkish forces. But the Kurdish problem is 
still there, needing more than ever to be solved.

  [Text] During the most recent National Security Council 
[NSC] meeting, which was to be devoted to the economic package, 
the latest political and military developments in Greece, South 
Cyprus, Bosnia, and Macedonia were also discussed. It was 
reported that the Balkan developments were discussed in 
connection with the internal problems of Turkey. In particular, 
it was concluded that Greece "is intensifying its policy of 
exploiting the Kurdish problem to weaken Turkey." [passage 
omitted] 
<H5>  PKK Promised Government in Exile </H5>
  In addition to the international developments, the NSC 
meeting also discussed Greece's support for the PKK. It 
reportedly examined allegations that the PKK's anti-tourism 
bombings in Turkey are being planned in south Cyprus. A report 
submitted to the NSC states that the PKK has been promised it 
can open official missions in Athens and south Nicosia, and that 
they will open soon. The report adds that the Greek government 
has promised the PKK it can establish "a government in exile" 
in Athens or Nicosia. 
  Reportedly Turkey will be making preparations to counter 
these developments in the coming days. 
  The NSC feels that intervention in Greece would not elicit a 
strong reaction from the West. 
  An NSC expert pointed out that a crisis with Greece would 
promote national reconciliation inside Turkey.

  [Excerpts] Alpaslan Pehlivanli, Motherland Party [ANAP] 
Central Decision-Making and Executive Council member and former 
Ankara deputy, has been killed in an armed attack near 
Kirikkale's Keskin District. According to information obtained 
by a Turkish Radio and Television correspondent from Kirikkale 
Governor Sahabettin Harput, three shots were fired from the 
passing car at Pehlivanli who was driving from Keskin to 
Kirikkale. Pehlivanli was seriously injured in the head and he 
died on the way to the hospital. Three other persons who were 
in the car with him did not sustain any injuries in the attack. 
It is reported that the car from which the shots were fired had 
a fake license plate and that there were four persons in it. 
Operations are continuing to capture the assailants. [passage 
omitted on Pehlivanli's curriculum vitae] 
  ANAP leader Mesut Yilmaz went to Kirikkale following the 
incident. He went to the hospital where Pehlivanli was taken 
and was briefed on the incident by Harput and other officials. 
In a statement at the hospital, Yilmaz said that there is a 
high possibility that it is a political murder and that the 
authorities concerned are continuing the investigation. Yilmaz 
said: The incident is very distressing for us. We are 
heartbroken. I extend my condolences to the people of Kirikkale 
and ANAP circles.

  [Text] Ankara, April 14 (A.A.) -- Interior Minister Nahit 
Mentese on Thursday said that Syrian President Hafiz al-Asad 
assured him that if necessary PKK [Workers Party of Kurdistan] 
terrorists near the border would be arrested. 
  He was speaking to reporters in the plane on his way back 
from Syria where he met with al-Asad to discuss security issues. 
  Mentese said that he has also asked for the return of the 
chief of the PKK terrorist organization, Abdullah Ocalan. 
  During the three-hour meeting, al-Asad brought up the 
subject 
of water, to which Mentese said that there was no need to worry 
on this issue. 
  He said that he has stressed time and time again that the 
terrorist chief is organizing ethnic groups in Turkey by 
ordering them either from Syria or Lebanon, but al-Asad neither 
confirmed nor rejected this. 
  `At the leaders' level, Turkey has asked for the return of 
the PKK terrorist chief and the members of the terrorist 
organization,' he said. 
  Mentese said Greece is among those backing the PKK and it 
was 
determined that that country is making efforts to hinder Turkish 
tourism and this is an inhuman behavior. 
  `It does not fit friendly or neighborly relations,' he 
added.

  [Excerpt] Turkish ground and air force units and Kurdish 
peshmergas affiliated with Democratic Party of Kurdistan leader 
Mas'ud Barzani have launched a major operation against the 
Kurdish Workers Party [PKK] militants in northern Iraq. Some 
40,000 troops and 3,000 commandos affiliated with the commando 
brigade on Hakkari Mountain have penetrated 5 km into northern 
Iraq. The joint cross-border operation, which was launched by 
the Turkish military forces on Turkey's border and the peshmerga 
units in northern Iraq, is supported by several Turkish military 
aircraft and Cobra and Sikorsky helicopters. 
  Several military aircraft, which took off from the 2d 
Tactical Air Base in Diyarbakir and the Erhac Air Base in 
Malatya, have bombed the Besta Valley and the heights of the 
Cudi, Gabbar, Herekol, Namaz, and Kupeli Mountains. Several 
Super Cobra helicopters joined the operation at about noon 
yesterday. 
  Elsewhere, a private vehicle was destroyed by a PKK mine 
near 
Emekciler village in Siirt at about 1600 yesterday. The 
vehicle's driver and four village guards, who were his 
passengers, were killed in the incident. 
  Three soldiers were martyred and three others were wounded 
in 
a clash between the security forces and a group of terrorists 
near the Tur farming settlement near the village of Islam in 
Diyarbakir's Kulp district yesterday. A terrorist was also 
killed in the clash. 
  The security forces killed four PKK terrorists in the rural 
areas of Igdir's Halfeli village, two terrorists in the forest 
areas of Kars' Sarikamis district, and one terrorist in the 
rural areas of Hakkari's Yuksekova district. 
  A group of terrorists attacked the Garzan-Besiri oil 
pipeline 
at about 2200 the night before last. The pipeline is operated 
by the Turkish Petroleum Corporation's regional directorate in 
Batman. No one was killed in the incident. [passage omitted]

  [Text] Ankara, April 15 (AA) -- A report prepared by a 
parliamentary commission in charge of detecting the existing 
problems and formulating measures on the southeast said that 
after the terrorism of the PKK [Workers Party of Kurdistan] is 
stopped, declaring a general amnesty is a must, to accomplish 
domestic peace. 
  The report also called for the restriction of the practice 
of 
regional governorates and the village guard systems. 
  The commission's chairman, Omur Lutfu Coskun, of the 
coalition member True Path Party (DYP), told a press conference 
today that, to prevent terror in the southeast, sensitivity is 
necessary so as not to regard all the region's people as 
potential criminals. 
  `The region should not be a place of exile for civil 
servants 
and the administrators should be loving and understanding in 
their relations with the region's people,' Coskun said. 
  Coskun cited other measures foreseen by their report as the 
formulation of urgent and lasting solutions to the problems of 
the region by local administrations, continuation of investments 
planned beforehand, encouragement of agriculture and animal 
breeding, opening new jobs. 
  The report stressed that practices based on using force 
would 
not facilitate the resolving of the problem and the tolerant 
attitude of the state would facilitate a solution sooner.

  [Text] Prosecutor Jose Nemtala on 29 March confirmed the 
arrest of Victor Poma, alleged member of the Tupac Katari 
Guerrilla Army, EGKT, who is charged with having been involved 
in terrorist attacks and attempts against the state's security. 
  Nemtala said that Poma was arrested following relentless 
investigation by the state's intelligence services. He declined 
to provide further details or the place where Poma is being held. 
  The EGKT began its terrorist activities in July 1991, with 
the "bombing" of two high tension pylons in the Alto Lima zone 
of the city of El Alto. Poma reportedly participated in this 
attack, which claimed the life of an EGKT member. The 
organization then perpetrated a number of attacks leading to the 
arrest of top leaders: the brothers Raul and Alvaro Garcia, who 
are jailed in the Chonchocoro prison, and Felipe Quispe, aka "El 
Mallku," among others. The state's intelligence services are 
searching for Carlos Lara, who is considered to be a member of 
the EGTK "general staff."

<F P=106> [Report by Marie Sena Ruiz] </F>
  [Excerpt] The threat of all rebel groups has weakened and 
the peace process being pushed by government is assured. This 
was the assessment made by the National Security Council [NSC] 
on the current economic and political situations in the country. 
  Briefing palace [presidential office] newsmen after the 
meeting in Malacanang, national security adviser Jose Almonte 
said all rebel groups, including leftist, rightist, and Muslim 
rebels, no longer pose a threat to national security. Almonte 
reported an overall improved peace and order situation and said 
government is completely in control of problems that debilitate 
the economy. 
  The NSC also adopted a resolution endorsing to Congress the 
amnesty proclamation announced by President Ramos. The 
resolution urged Congress to ratify the proclamation. 
  Also during the said National Security Council meeting, 
Executive Secretary Teofisto Guingona said, the country's now 
poised for economic takeoff as economic and political reforms 
have been put in place. Guingona said the major economic 
reforms were designed to level the playing field to promote 
global competitiveness and make opportunities available to 
everyone. 
  On the economic front, acting Trade Secretary Ernesto 
Ordonez 
assessed the impact of the oil price increase and its subsequent 
rollback. The secretary said that the oil price increase hardly 
affected the prices of basic commodities because of measures 
adopted by government. 
  For his part, Finance Secretary Roberto De Ocampo 
underscored 
the importance of tax measures/alternatives to the oil levy, 
particularly the (?cost) and tariff program, (?special) 
progress, and completion of major projects of the government. 
  The fourth National Security Council meeting under the Ramos 
Administration was convened to address vital internal and 
external security concerns. 
  Meanwhile, President Ramos today ordered the Presidential 
Anti- Crime Commission [PACC] headed by Vice President Joseph 
Estrada to exert all efforts to stop the new kidnap gangs behind 
the latest kidnapping cases in Metro Manila and other parts of 
the country. 
  The chief executive also ordered the Armed Forces of the 
Philippines and the Philippine National Police to support the 
PACC in tracking down the kidnappers who are believed to be 
former members of the dismantled Red Scorpion Group. The 
president issued the order after receiving reports that several 
new kidnapping cases were reported in Metro Manila and Benguet 
province. [passage omitted]

  [Text] Trang Governor David Wichaidit has discussed the 
spread of terrorism in his province and Phatthalung Province. 
He said the government's intelligence is more broad and 
detailed than the media's. For this reason, Trang Province has 
stepped up precautions and measures to deal with the possibility 
of terrorism. 
  Regarding a report that the prime minister's home might be 
the target of a bomb attack, Trang provincial officials will try 
to ensure security in all areas, although there is not enough 
manpower to cover every area around the clock. The province can 
only increase precautionary measures in likely target areas. 
The people can be confident that the province is doing its best 
to maintain security through constant coordination with the 
Fourth Army Region. 
  Asked if he reported this information to the prime minister, 
the Trang governor said the prime minister did not pay attention 
only to Trang Province, but to the entire country. The prime 
minister did not ask anything specific. The province did not 
make any specific report to the prime minister because it 
regards this as taking normal security precautions. Asked if 
the situation might worsen, the Trang governor said he could not 
comment on other provinces, but he is confident that his 
province will not be affected much by the reported possibility 
of terrorist activities. This is because his province has had 
relevant intelligence reports for some time and has been 
constantly vigilant. He said no special police unit has been 
sent to protect the prime minister's residence because such a 
measure could frighten passers by. He also does not believe 
such a measure would be the correct security method. He gave 
assurances, however, that there are both secret and overt 
security plans as well as ad hoc security center in his province 
that he would rather not reveal to the public. 
  Meanwhile, Police Colonel Phitsanu Bunyarat, deputy 
commander 
of the Railway Police, noted the security measures for trains 
operating on southern routes. He said the police department has 
made plans with the units concerned -- the military; the border 
patrol police; and the governors of Songkhla, Pattani, Yala, and 
Narathiwat -- to prevent train sabotage. More railway policemen 
have been assigned to trains, particularly the Bangkok-Sungai 
Kolok train and the Sungei Kolok-Bangkok train, while they 
travel along the dangerous section between Hat Yai and Sungei 
Kolok. Four policemen have been added to these trains in 
addition to the previous four. They will be equipped with 
modern arms and communications equipment. This should be 
sufficient to protect passengers. Capable policemen have been 
chosen especially for this purpose. 
  Phitsanu said several units have been assigned 
responsibility 
for overseeing the safety of sections of railroad track. There 
is a problem with inefficient intelligence collection, however, 
caused by religious and language issues. Officials do not have 
enough experience with these issues.

<F P=106> ["p. re." report: "`We Accomplished the Massacre'"] </F>
  [Text] Tirana -- Those responsible for the serious 
terrorist attack last Sunday morning [10 Apr] in the village of 
Peshkepi near the Albanian-Greek border have now become known. 
An ultranationalist Greek group, the self-styled "MAVI" 
(Northern Epirus Liberation Front), has claimed responsibility 
for the victims -- two dead and three wounded -- at the Albanian 
military barracks. The motives behind the massacre are explained 
in a communique sent last Sunday evening by the previously 
entirely unknown MAVI to the Athens newspaper ELEFTEROTHYPIA, 
well-known as the leading mouthpiece of Greek nationalist 
circles. 
  The link between the slogans shouted by the members of the 
terrorist group and the motives behind this serious incident has 
also become entirely clear. According to the ultranationalist 
group, the attack was a response to "the criminal indifference 
of the Greek state," which, according to them, "has failed to 
act properly to prevent the expulsion of Greeks from Albanian 
territory, thus helping Tirana in its ultimate objective of 
eliminating the Greek element from Albania. Our action was 
intended to change the disastrous attitude of the Greek 
Government toward Vorioepiros [Northern Epirus]," the communique 
concludes. 
  The news of the serious border incident prompted a wave of 
protest from the Albanian authorities and political forces. In 
a statement addressed to the international community, an 
Albanian Foreign Ministry spokesman held the Greek Government 
responsible for the attack: "It is beyond all doubt that the 
attack was prepared by special Greek forces." President Berisha 
and Prime Minister Meksi also responded with indignation. 
Meanwhile, the Albanian ambassador in Athens was urgently 
recalled to Tirana on Monday for consultations. Kastriot Robo, 
first secretary of the Albanian Embassy, confirmed this news, 
calling the incident "very serious and unprecedented." 
  For their part, the Greek authorities have disclaimed all 
responsibility for Sunday's attack. Athens spokesman Evangelos 
Venizelos called the charges in the Albanian Foreign Ministry's 
protest note groundless. "Greece will not accept any 
provocation or charge without documentary evidence. Greece is 
against any kind of act of violence." Just a week earlier, the 
Greek Government had addressed a warning to Tirana, reminding 
the Albanian capital of the "inviolable nature" of the rights of 
the Greek minority, who are "indissolubly" tied to Greece. 
  The Greek press has to some extent left Sunday's news in the 
shade. Some newspapers, such as the progovernment Athens daily 
TA NEA, have even put forward a theory that this was an action 
by "the Albanian mafia." Only LAIKO VRIMA, the newspaper of the 
Greek minority in Albania, has come out against the attack. A 
letter sent urgently by its editorial board to President Sali 
Berisha expresses sorrow over the victims of the tragedy. 
  Greek nationalism and the problem of Northern Epirus have in 
the past led to a deterioration in relations between the two 
countries, but the incident last Sunday was the most serious 
since the fighting on the border in August 1949. Greek 
nationalist groups have for a long time been agitating for the 
union of "Vorioepiros" with Greece. Greek political figures, 
including former ministers such as Sotiris Kouvelas, have called 
this area "unliberated territory." Sebastianos, the Orthodox 
bishop of Konitsa, has had a radio station with five repeaters 
installed at the border; these send nationalist messages to the 
Greek minority in Albania. All this activity has not led to the 
slightest response from the Greek authorities, which are on the 
contrary always ready to make a fuss about the "irredentist 
propaganda" of neighboring countries such as Macedonia [The 
Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia -- FYROM], Turkey, and 
Albania.

  [Text] Two more people have been arrested in the last few 
hours in relation to the case involving the Zarate Willka 
terrorist group. But one of them, photographer David Garcia, 
already has been released for lack of evidence. [begin 
recording] 
  Unidentified reporter: These men belong to the 
Zarate Willka Armed Liberation Front terrorist group. The group 
members became known a few years ago when they murdered two 
Mormons, two Americans, in La Paz. These images from our files 
remind us that these men were sentenced, in some cases, to 20 
years in prison. In the last few hours police arrested Judith 
Munoz and David Garcia for their alleged involvement in this 
case. It has been reported, however, that David Garcia did not 
have any participation in the murder of the two Mormons. 
Therefore, Judith Munoz will be formally accused of belonging to 
the terrorist group. 
  Minister of Government German Quiroga: We found a 
close link between that woman and the Mormons' murder. 
Therefore, police are carrying out an investigation in that 
direction. 
  Reporter: Reliable Bolivian police sources 
indicated that a clearly identified jeep was used when the 
Mormons were murdered. The finding of the jeep at her house lead 
to Judith Munoz' arrest. [end recording]

  [Text] Osorno -- Investigative Police have put under the 
jurisdiction of a court four members of a Movement of the 
Revolutionary Left (MIR) faction called the National Liberation 
Army who are reportedly responsible for, among other crimes, the 
murder of retired General Renato Varela Correa. 
  The police report indicates that one year ago the arrested 
people created a criminal terrorist group based on the 
military-political concepts sustained by the old MIR. They are 
currently in the formative stage, seeking resources for their 
infrastructure and recruiting militants, mainly in area 
universities. 
  The arrested, who have been identified as university 
students, are Pedro Enrique Rozas Aravena, 29, alias "Comandante 
Puren or Sebastian" who is in charge of the group's political 
leadership in the southern zone; Marcelo Alejandro Gaete 
Mancilla, 22; Eric Ulises Maichin Naipan, 27; and Agustin 
Ricardo Pena Aguilera, 28. Subversive literature and hand 
weapons were found in their possession. 
  The crimes committed by the group include: On 30 July 1993, 
the group held up the Inglesa foundry plant in Santiago's Maipu 
districts, stealing 8 million pesos and shooting the security 
manager, retired General Renato Varela, who was director of the 
Famae [Army Ordnance] and minister vice president of Corfo 
[Production Development Corporation], and who died on 7 August. 
The group also held up the Condell finance company in Osorno and 
set a bomb in the Christian Democratic Party's headquarters in 
Osorno. 
  The arrested were put under the jurisdiction of the First 
Criminal Court of Osorno.

  [Excerpt] Guatemala City, 8 Mar [date as received] 
(ACAN-EFE) -- Guatemalan President Ramiro de Leon Carpio 
announced today that he will act with a "firm hand" against the 
terrorists, whom he labelled "Neanderthals" who started a wave 
of political violence in the country. He also dismissed the 
possibility of decreeing a state of emergency. 
  "Unfortunately, there are people in Guatemala who think like 
Neanderthals, and for many years they have fought ideas with 
bullets, not with words," he said. Upon reiterating his 
condemnation of the murder of Constitutional Court President 
Epaminondas Gonzalez on 1 April and the attack against Deputy 
Obdulio Chinchilla on Wednesday, De Leon emphasized that he is 
"worried" about the recent violence. 
  "The government rejects any kind of violence and will act 
strongly to counter it," the president told reporters. He added 
that security forces have been given precise instructions to get 
to the bottom of their investigations and find the people 
responsible for Gonzalez' murder and the attack against 
Chinchilla. 
  De Leon pointed out that Guatemala must enter without 
further 
delay a phase of reconciliation to stop the violence and the 
civil war that began in 1960 so it can achieve welfare and 
social development. The president asked the groups causing the 
violence to reconsider and reflect on the "serious damage" they 
are doing the country through their actions. "It is not 
violence but dialogue that will solve our problems," the 
president emphasized. [passage omitted]

<F P=106> [Statement by Honduran police spokesman Major Cesar Augusto </F>
Somoza on the kidnapping of Deputy Adolfo Alvarado in Olancho 
Department; place and date not given -- live or recorded] 
  [Text] According to our reports, Alfonso Alvarado was 
kidnapped in San Esteban at 0800 today by three people who 
reportedly wanted to do business with him. His butler, who was 
with Alvarado, left them alone so they could talk. After 20 
minutes, the butler discovered Alvarado had been kidnapped. The 
kidnappers left a note, which Alvarado's relatives took to 
Olancho Regional Commander Lt. Col. Medrano. In the note, 
members of an armed group known as Los Cinchoneros informed Mrs. 
Alvarado that they were foreigners and were demanding a 1.5 
million lempiras ransom, otherwise her husband would be 
executed. The kidnappers drove a red Hilux pickup. The note 
also said that the ransom money should be dropped at a lumber 
mill near San Pedro Sula at 1630 local on Saturday, and that Mr. 
Alvarado would be released at Aguacaliente at 1600 on Sunday. 
The note stipulated that neither the police, the Army, nor 
another country should be told about the kidnapping and that 
counterfeit or marked money should not be delivered. The note 
was signed by a rural commando that fights on behalf of 
exploited people. 
  [Panama City ACAN in Spanish at 0016 GMT on 16 April 
transmits a 30-word Tegucigalpa datelined report that says: 
"Deputy Adolfo Alvarado Lara, who was kidnapped on Thursday, 
was released today, Friday, 15 April, and is now at the military 
garrison in Trujillo, a Caribbean region in Honduras, the 
politician's wife, Lidia de Alvarado, has announced."]

Radio Campesina, both headquartered in Phoenix, Arizona, 
indicates that the front was established recently and that it 
opposes the president of Mexico, his cabinet, and the PRI 
[Institutional Revolutionary Party]. 
  The document states: "The front was created autonomously 
through the initiative of members of the government of the 
Mexican Republic, members of the Mexican Army, and 7,000 Mexican 
`illegal alliens' [indocumentados] now residing in the United 
States." 
  Members of Chicano communities in Arizona, California, and 
New Mexico who were questioned about this said they knew nothing 
about this new organization. PRENSA HISPANA is a small weekly 
distributed among the Mexican-American community and Radio 
Campesina belongs to the Peasants Union established by Cesar 
Chavez. 
  The document says Mario Aburto Martinez, who is currently 
being held in Almolova in connection with the Colosio slaying, 
is a member of this front and was the person who opened fire on 
the presidential candidate. 
  The document says: "The FMCCG (along with its member Aburto 
Martinez), weary and desperate because of the alarming economic 
situation facing the Mexican people for the past 24 years, is 
adopting measures against the government and claims 
responsibility for the assassination of Luis Donaldo Colosio." 
  The group claims to have deployed death squads throughout 
the 
country and vows to attack its targets should its demands not be 
met. 
  The document points out: "Over the past six years, we have 
prepared ourselves to realize, fight, and die for our ideals by 
punishing those politicians who are in power and are using this 
power to their advantage to abuse, steal, and commit 
injustices." Although the document says members of the group are 
willing to die for their cause, it adds, "of course, they will 
die before we do." 
  The five-page document addressed to the Mexican people says 
Colosio was the first of several targets, and it adds that the 
attack on the politician marked the start of a fight to the 
death against the "corrupt traitors of the Mexican Government." 
  The group warns that there will be no peace in the country 
until its demands are met and until the members of the 
government change their positions. 
  The document adds: "All demands must be met or the loss of 
thousands of Mexican lives will be inevitable. The only person 
responsible for this will be you, Carlos Salinas de Gortari." 
  Among the front's main demands is the establishment of an 
OAS 
commission to oversee respect for the human rights of prisoners. 
Other demands include the addition to the Constitution of an 
article attributing responsibility to and punishing members of 
several Mexican governments for crimes of embezzlement and 
mismanagement of public funds. 
  The front wants capital punishment established for "traitors 
of the homeland," and it calls for the confiscation of personal 
fortunes estimated at $1 billion amassed by former Presidents 
Luis Echeverria Alvarez, Jose Lopez Portillo, and Miguel de la 
Madrid, as well as by President Carlos Salinas de Gortari and 
Fidel Velasquez, leader of the CTM [Confederation of Mexican 
Workers]. The group also levels charges against former Jalisco 
Governor Guillermo Cosio Vidaurri, other former state leaders, 
and federal senators and deputies.

  [Text] According to Interior Vice Minister Ruben Villalba 
Cataldi, two Arabs presumably entered our country with the 
intention of carrying out illegal actions, but one of them has 
apparently already left the country. 
  Moreover, the National Police limited themselves to 
reporting 
that they are checking out the information that has been 
provided by the Israeli Secret Service, through the Israeli 
Embassy, indicating that Arabs had reportedly entered the 
country with the objective of carrying out attacks against 
Israelis. 
  Despite the fact that the police did not provide many 
details, Villalba Cataldi stated that there is information that 
two Arabs entered the country with that purpose in mind. One of 
them has apparently already left the country, while the other is 
being sought by the police, according to the vice minister. 
  Commissioner Enrique Martinetti, chief of the Intelligence 
Department, stated that an investigation has already begun in 
cooperation with the Migrations Department, Interpol, and 
authorities of the 4th Police Zone based in Ciudad del Este, as 
it is believed that the Arabs entered the country through that 
city. 
  The Israeli Embassy has not been observed to have taken any 
special measures for the security of its diplomats and officials.

  [Excerpt] The Shi'ite terrorist that came to our country 
not only intended to attack Israeli diplomatic headquarters in 
our country but to poison Israelis in the Middle East as well. 
In order to do so, he was to have gained access to large 
shipments of beef to be exported to Israel in order to poison 
them with a powerful toxic substance. 
  This warning was sounded by the Israeli intelligence service 
soon after it informed the Paraguayan National Police that Ahmed 
Al Mekdav, a fundamentalist Shi'ite, had arrived in our country 
a month ago. 
  Police Superintendent Enrique De Jesus Martinetti, the 
director of the National Police Intelligence Department, 
confirmed this and pointed out that the information was provided 
by the Israeli secret service. 
  The terrorist had to locate meat-packing plants that export 
meat to Israel, find a way to get access to the product to be 
exported to Israel, and then poison it with a deadly toxic 
substance. 
  The consequences would have been devastating. The objective 
was to kill hundreds of Israelis in important cities in their 
country. 
  The name of the meat-packing plants are: "Frigobeef," 
located in Capitan Lombardo very close to Artigas, and "San 
Antonio" in the city of the same name. 
  Intelligence Department personnel went to those meat-packing 
plants and warned their managers to take the necessary 
precautions by not allowing strangers on their premises so as to 
thwart any sabotage attempts. 
  Martinetti noted that the meat was imported by a private, 
and 
not government-owned, Israeli meat-packing plant. 
  He said: "We were alerted by the Israelis and now are 
conducting an inquiry. We have been informed that this Shi'ite, 
Imadal Mekdav [name as published], intended to poison a large 
shipment of beef that was going to be exported to Israel. We 
have seemingly aborted this attempt with the help of the 
Israelis. Mekdav has been spotted already in Lebanon." [passage

<F P=106> [DESCO Special Report No 34: "Political Violence in Peru </F>
Today," issued by Peru's Center for Development Studies and 
Promotion (DESCO)] 
  [Text] January 1994's statistics on political violence were 
similar to those of November 1993. There were 34 incidents and 
40 killings, more or less the same level as the early years of 
the subversive war. 
  Lima was again in first place in number of incidents: 11 
acts 
of political violence took place in the capital, 32 percent of 
the total. All of the actions sought to maintain the operational 
presence of the Shining Path [SL] guerrillas who remain free. 
The incidents were of little importance. 
  The capital and forest regions occupied second place, with 
eight victims (23.5 percent) each. The most important subversive 
incidents took place in the province of El Dorado, where Shining 
Path carried out incursions in at least four villages, and in 
the area of Saposa, where it took part in two clashes with 
security forces. 
  The regional committee of the north took third place in 
number of incidents with three (9 percent). Two of these actions 
took place in provinces of the department of Ancash, and the 
third at the locality of Chiclayo. 
  There was a tie for fourth and last place between the 
principal committee (Ayacucho) and the southern region with two 
incidents (6 percent) each. Two incursions took place in the 
south, in Orurillo district, and there was a targeted killing 
and a guerrilla incursion in the principal region. 
  With regard to the number of victims, first place was the 
regional forest committee with 20 victims, 50 percent of the 
total for the month. These were all guerrilla losses in at least 
two clashes in the Saposa area. 
  The principal regional committee took second place with 
eight 
victims (20 percent). They were all civilians, including seven 
peasants, three of whom died in an incursion in Huamanguilla 
district, and the other four because they discovered and handled 
a bomb in a locality near Huamanga. An official of the Ministry 
of Transport and Telecommunications was also murdered. 
  The regional committee of the south placed third with four 
dead (10 percent). These were all peasants murdered in a Shining 
Path incursion in Orurillo district. 
  There was a tie for fourth place between the regional 
committees of the center and of the north, with three victims 
(7.5 percent) in each. Two targeted killings took place in the 
central region, in Huancayo and Tarma, and a guerrilla was 
killed in a prison in Huancayo in a fight between two Shining 
Path factions. In the northern region, the three incidents were 
targeted killings. The most important was the murder of the 
president of the Peasant, Urban and Peaceful Night Patrols, 
Gilberto Diaz Vasquez. A lawyer and a school principal were also 
murdered in the department of Ancash. 
  Finally, last place in number of victims was occupied by the 
capital, with two dead (5 percent). One of the victims was a 
villager from El Pino mountain, and the other was a university 
student who was tortured in a police station and who was 
identified as a subversive.

<H5>  Political violence statistics - February 1994 </H5>
  February 1994 registered levels of political violence 
similar 
to those of the previous month, to those of November 1993, and 
to the first year of the guerrilla war. 
  This confirms a trend, at least with regard to incidents of 
political violence. There is an important decrease in the number 
of victims. There were 32 subversive incidents that caused the 
deaths of 19 persons throughout the country. 
  As is already known, Lima continues to take first place in 
number of incidents; there were 20 incidents (63 percent) of 
political violence in the capital. 
  Shining Path has tried to reestablish its presence, but it 
is 
becoming increasingly clear that it will not be able to attain 
1992's levels of terror. The most spectacular incident was the 
detonation of a car bomb at one of the main buildings of the 
Peruvian Air Force, despite the fact that the surrounding 
streets are closed to traffic. 
  The regional committee of the center was in second place 
with 
six incidents (19 percent). One of these was carried out by what 
remains of the MRTA [Tupac Amaru Revolutionary Movement] in 
Chanchamayo. Shining Path also had two confrontations with 
security forces in the same province. 
  The regional committee of the north had the third highest 
number of incidents with four actions (13 percent). These all 
took place in provinces in Ancash department. 
  There was a tie for fourth and last place between the 
regional committees of mid north and mid south, with one 
incident (3 percent) each. In Pisco, an attempt was made to 
ambush two magistrates, and in Barranca, the offices of the 
Municipal Water Service were burned down. 
  With regard to victims, the regional committee of the center 
had the highest number, with nine dead (47 percent), five of 
whom were subversives. Four Shining Path members died in two 
clashes with security forces in Chanchamayo and the other in an 
attack on a community of Ashaninkas in Satipo, where two members 
of the community also died. 
  Another civilian died accidentally during an action carried 
out by the MRTA while capturing the hydroelectric plant at 
Pichanaki. After the capture, the guerrillas mined the 
approaches, and a civilian died when he stepped on one of the 
mines. 
  This was one of the MRTA's most important actions since the 
capture of its kidnapping team in Lima. 
  Finally, a noncommissioned officer of the Dincote 
[Counterterrorism Directorate] was murdered by a Shining Path 
group in Huancayo. 
  Lima had the second highest number of victims with seven (37 
percent), five of whom were policemen and two civilians. But 
only four of the civilians were killed by guerrillas. The fifth 
was killed by the Army near a military factory. 
  The regional committee of the north accounted for the third 
highest number of victims, with two deaths (11 percent), which 
were losses by the guerrillas in an assault on the locality of 
Huari. 
  Last place in number of victims with one killed (5 percent), 
was the forest region, where the president of the night patrols 
committee of Las Palmas, in the province of Leoncio Prado, 
killed a Shining Path member who had availed himself of the law 
of repentance, and who was working as a member of the patrols.

<F P=106> [Unattributed article: "Why Weaken DINCOTE?"] </F>
  [Text] On 3 February, the National Police Headquarters 
ordered the transfer of 200 policemen from the National 
Counterterrorism Directorate (DINCOTE) to other police units. 
According to a statement made by the PNP's [Peruvian National 
Police] general director, Victor Alva Plasencia, this measure is 
being applied in a general context of police reorganization, and 
is not limited to the DINCOTE. 
  Nevertheless, there are indications that the changes in the 
DINCOTE are attributable to a higher political realm, in which 
not even President Alberto Fujimori himself holds all the 
decision-making power. 
  According to unofficial information, the DINCOTE has five 
police units called Deltas, each of which has approximately 35 
members and is under orders from a commander. Their task is to 
support the intelligence work and the operations planned on the 
directorate levels. 
  Concurrently, there is the Special Intelligence Group 
(GEIN), 
engaged in intelligence work per se, and constructing and 
refining its own data base in order to track the leading 
suspects. On a certain occasion, the GEIN was divided into one 
group devoted to SL [Shining Path] and another devoted to the 
MRTA [Tupac Amaru Revolutionary Movement]. 
  There are also the BREDET, initials designating the brigades 
that follow up reports frequently provided by the public on 
suspected houses or persons. 
  The work of a DINCOTE member is quite arduous. Officers and 
some of the subordinate personnel often work for consecutive 
periods lasting 12 or 16 hours a day. Moreover, on many 
occasions their stint lasts 24 hours, because of the proximity 
of an operation. 
  Despite the intense work and the constant danger to which 
each member of the operative groups is exposed, he is not 
compensated monetarily. 
  For example, a captain's pay is from 400 to 450 soles 
($215), 
not counting the amount deducted. A junior officer, on the other 
hand, earns approximately 300 soles ($140). 
  A DINCOTE operative member, among those stationed for hours 
to spy on a suspect, receives 5 soles of per diem for his entire 
long work assignment. 
  Recently, the DINCOTE personnel had a pay cut. At the end of 
January, their annual bonus for hazardous work was reduced. 
According to one official, this occurred despite the fact that 
the budget allocated to the DINCOTE for 1993 had included this 
extra income. 
  Two days before they were to receive the bonus, the agents 
were informed of a 70 percent reduction in the incentive bonus. 
Hence, if an officer was supposed to receive 225 soles, he was 
given only 65 new soles; whereas a junior officer, who would 
have received 160 more than his salary, earned only 40 soles. 
  According to members of this institution, until General 
Ketin 
Vidal's administration, "the DINCOTE was far more compact, and 
the entire group's motivation was sustained. There were no 
objections when it was necessary to engage in any operation." 
Furthermore, the operative members had a certain amount of 
autonomy for carrying out their missions, without lapsing into a 
mechanical job. Now, the situation in the DINCOTE reportedly has 
deteriorated in all these respects. There are fewer resources 
for operations, and there is more inflexibility in the 
instructions. 
  The National Intelligence Service's [SIN] excessive 
interference in the management of operations and personnel has 
become another debatable feature of the present-day DINCOTE. 
  Two copies of every case file or record prepared in the 
DINCOTE must be submitted to the SIN, without any reciprocity 
implied. Some officers criticize what they claim to be the 
unwillingness shown by the chiefs, including their present 
general director, to defend their own decision-making power, 
unlike what was typical of them until December 1992. 
  Some of the SIN's intervention in the DINCOTE is backed by 
legal regulations stipulating that the SIN shall receive the 
support of qualified forces so long as it lacks the necessary 
personnel. 
  However, that support to the SIN is now becoming a virtual 
decapitation of the DINCOTE. Recently, the "Sunday Review" news 
program on television Channel 4 announced the transfer of 14 
DINCOTE officers, including lieutenants, captains, majors, and 
colonels, to the SIN. Nevertheless, the number of officers 
transferred is said to be even higher. 
  Among those transferred to the SIN is a colonel who, 
according to very well-informed sources, was the real director 
of the investigations making it possible to capture Abimael 
Guzman and scores of other Shining Path leaders. Another 
colonel, the principal expert in the investigations of the MRTA, 
was transferred to a province in late 1993. 
  Moreover, nearly 90 percent of the total personnel 
transferred to the SIN were members of the Delta and Special 
Intelligence (GEIN) groups. The other 10 percent are assimilated 
or administrative personnel. 
  The objective no longer seems to be merely to obtain 
support, 
but rather to expropriate intelligence from the DINCOTE, so as 
to put its best investigators under the direct control of 
military intelligence. The particular goal would be to put them 
under the command of Vladimiro Montesinos, President Fujimori's 
principal adviser on the subject of subversion, and one of the 
SIN's preeminent spokesmen. 
  Now then, the following question is fitting: Why reinforce 
military intelligence so much, at the cost of debilitating the 
DINCOTE, which has been the state's real mainstay for repressing 
subversion? Furthermore, why do so in a situation wherein 
subversion is plummeting? 
  The most plausible, and perhaps also the most suspicious 
response is that such personnel will be assigned to other 
investigations dissociated from the countersubversive types. 
With the SL decline, other adversaries are taking priority: 
others to be located, checked, and neutralized. 
  The drug traffic? If that were the target aimed at, the 
DINANDRO [National Police Counternarcotics Directorate] should 
have been the unit reinforced with ex-DINCOTE personnel. Or, in 
any event, the SIN would have requested DINANDRO rather than 
DINCOTE officers to reinforce it in this mission. 
  The military and civilian opposition? Therein lies the 
explanation. There is no doubt that the La Cantuta case, the 
leaks to the press of classified information provided by the 
Comaca or Leon Dormido groups, and the charges by certain 
officials of generals' being implicated in the drug traffic are 
becoming the main factor in the erosion of the current military 
commanders and of the government itself. 
  Hence, one of the adversaries, possibly the principal one, 
that should be targeted, is the military opposition. The other 
is the civilian opposition which, as the electoral period 
approaches, will be as dangerous as the dissidents in uniform, 
or more so. 
  The problem is that three processes detrimental to the 
country's democratic order are implicit in all this: the 
subordination of the armed institutions to the government's 
particular political interest; the military control of the major 
police units; and the weakening of the DINCOTE when the Shining 
Path terrorist adventure has not yet been totally stifled. 
  On the other hand, what the country's general interest 
requires is the same as what befits forces of order with a 
democratic inclination and professional excellence: submission 
to the law, clear demarcation of military and police 
jurisdictions, and genuine recognition for the merit of the 
police units performing their duty.

  [Excerpt] La Paz, 30 Mar (LOS TIEMPOS) -- Sources linked to 
intelligence offices in the Government Ministry and the Special 
Antinarcotics Force (FELCN) reported today that a reactivation 
of the subversive Tupac Katari Guerrilla Army [EGTK) 
organization has been detected in the last few days in three 
departments. 
  The sources told LOS TIEMPOS in La Paz that the subversive 
group that was broken up in 1991 resumed its terrorist 
activities in La Paz, Cochabamba, and Sucre by calling for armed 
insurrection in various rural districts. 
  They said this subversive organization "plans to act with 
greater force" in La Paz and Cochabamba Departments, and that 
the signs of subversive activity "are the writing on walls seen 
by state intelligence in the two departments' rural districts." 
  They indicated that the EGTK, in contrast to other guerrilla 
organizations with similar characteristics such as the Nestor 
Paz Zamora Command (CNPZ) or the Zarate Willka Armed Liberation 
Forces (FAL-ZW), "still have ideological leaders because not all 
of them were arrested by the intelligence organizations." The 
sources added: "An example is the recent capture of Victor Poma 
after three years. He was accused of terrorist activities and 
actions against state security." [passage omitted]

<F P=106> [Report by Angel Paez] </F>
  [Text] The Shining Path [SL] cells in Europe have also 
become divided over Abimael Guzman Reinoso's decision to reach a 
peace agreement with the government. One group, headed by Luis 
Arce Borja and Adolfo Olaechea Cahuas, is against a dialogue 
with the government, while the other, headed by a close relative 
of Guzman, is in favor of laying down arms. 
  The Sol Committee in Paris, in a bulletin which it started 
publishing recently, confirms its obedience to the self-styled 
"President Gonzalo" with the argument that "the great masters of 
the proletariat (also) carried out negotiations and signed peace 
agreements," and accused a "small black group" of questioning 
the SL leader's decisions. 
  According to the publication -- which unlike EL DIARIO 
INTERNACIONAL, whose editor is Luis Arce Borja, does not 
indicate the name of its editor -- this opposition group is 
"made up of a handful of opportunists who have banded together 
in a crazy and heated attempt to divide and create confusion in 
lashing out against the peace agreement proposed by our 
leadership." 
  Apparently Luis Arce Borja, who lives in Brussels, and 
Adolfo 
Olaechea Cahuas, who heads another "Sol Peru Committee" in 
London, form the "small black group." 
  Arce and Olaechea have both stated through their 
publications 
that the peace agreement being negotiated between Abimael Guzman 
Reinoso and President Alberto Fujimori is a great hoax, as they 
maintain that the letters were not written by the SL leader, nor 
is it he who appears in the videos, but rather an actor who 
looks very much like him. 
  But the basis for Arce and Olaechea's argument is that there 
isn't a single note from Guzman explaining the grounds for the 
proposal for a dialogue with the enemy. Arce even created an 
"interview" with Guzman, fabricated from old interviews and 
documents, in which he is made to say that an agreement with the 
regime is unfeasible. 
  In this regard the Sol Peru Committee in Paris states that 
those who maintain "with great insolence that President 
Gonzalo's letters and his proposal for a peace agreement are 
false and an invention have no arguments left in view of the 
overwhelming truth, (because) they will have to argue against 
2,500 prisoners of war from throughout the country who have 
declared through a communique that `they will not take a single 
step without President Gonzalo's guidance,' also repudiating the 
provocation and black campaign against the proposed peace 
agreement." 
  The Sol Peru Committee in Paris refers to the documents 
issued last December by SL members held under arrest in Miguel 
Castro Castro prison in Canto Grande, which endorse Guzman's 
letters to President Alberto Fujimori and uphold "the new 
decision and definition to strive for a peace agreement, 
(because) the people need it." 
  The document drafted by the SL members in France -- which 
clearly refers to the groups abroad that have sided with Oscar 
Ramirez Durand, "Comrade Feliciano," who is against the peace 
agreement and acknowledges Guzman's leadership only until the 
second SL Congress, which is when "Feliciano" will allegedly 
take the reins of the organization -- asserts that "the 
opportunists and alleged `upholders' of the peoples' war who 
have settled in Europe will not be able to shout (...) that 
2,500 prisoners of war of the Communist Party of Peru are 
"crazy," "stoned," or have been declared under "psychological 
pressure," and less still that they `have sided with Fujimori's 
government.'" 
  The document goes on to state: "They will have to bite their 
dirty tongues and swallow the disgusting things they have said," 
"(because) one (cannot) label fellow comrades with renowned 
devotion as people who have `surrendered' or as `repentants,' 
which is how the black campaign against the peace agreement 
intends to describe them: Maria Pantoja, Martha Huatay, and 
Angelica Salas Osman Morote, who met with President Gonzalo, and 
(Comrade) Miriam (Elena Iparraguirre Revoredo) have passed on 
President Gonzalo's instructions." 
  The bulletin is more precise: "(The members of the `small 
black group') will not be able to direct their disgusting 
charges against clean militants such as Edmundo Cox, Sybila 
Arredondo, (Victor) Zavala Catano, Maritza Garrido Lecca, etc., 
with the purpose of creating division in the work of the 
Communist Party of Peru abroad." 
Cox Beuzeville ia the author of a letter to Colonel Gabino 
Cajahuanca, director of the Castro Castro prison, in which he 
explains his efforts to convince his comrades to struggle for 
the peace agreement. He writes: "My commitment is full, total, 
unconditional, public, decided, and definite, to achieve what 
everybody needs: the peace agreement." 
  The bulletin of the Sol Peru Committee in Paris published 
the 
letter from Cox Beuzeville and the prisoners of Canto Grande 
advocating obedience to the new guidelines of Guzman Reinoso. 
The letter says: "We strongly and unavoidably adhere to our 
leader, to our dear and respected President Gonzalo, with 
firmness and determination for the new great decision: the 
struggle for the peace agreement!" 
  In these terms the SL cells in Paris show their total 
disagreement with the position taken by Olaechea Cahuas and Arce 
Borja, known for their SL propaganda, who are at large and under 
process of extradition. 
  The two, through DIARIO INTERNACIONAL, contend that 
"agreeing 
with Fujimori's `letters' means disregarding the general 
political guideline of the revolution established by Abimael 
Guzman, and denying the validity of the party's program, the 
strategic objective of which is the seizure of power throughout 
the entire country and the creation of the Popular Republic of 
Peru." 
  The two leaders also said that "the people's war cannot be 
negotiated, and there cannot be any dialogue with this 
reactionary and criminal government. The decision made by the 
revolutionaries is to destroy the old state and finish off the 
Armed Forces and the police" and "these objectives cannot be 
achieved with deals or `peace talks.' The class struggle cannot 
be auctioned off." 
  This position is the same as that held by those who publish 
EL DIARIO in Lima. Last January EL DIARIO published a 
communique from the "Committee of Relatives of Political 
Prisoners, War Prisoners, and Those Missing of Peru" attacking 
the SL leaders who are in favor of the peace agreement. The 
communique says: "We raise our voices and belligerent souls to 
denounce, condemn, and reject with the deep hate of the classes 
the sinister actions of that handful of known and proven 
capitulators, informers, and cowards who would not sacrifice 
their lives, the execrable revisionist bitches (...) who have 
been mobilized through different prisons of the country to 
spread the so-called peace agreement, openly crying out for 
capitulation, reporting everyone, and taking refuge in the 
repentance law." 
  This is the combat line of Oscar Ramirez Durand, Comrade 
Feliciano, which consists in asserting that the entire campaign 
for the peace agreement is a plot to destroy the Communist Party 
of Peru-Shining Path, PCP-SL, to put an end to the "people's 
war" and mainly kill Guzman. "(This sector) persists alone in 
the counterrevolutionary hoax within the premeditated, 
treacherous, and furious plan to murder President Gonzalo, thus 
uselessly attempting to spread capitulation among our heroic 
people, liquidate the party, and destroy the people's war." 
  And in the recent issue of EL DIARIO, February-March, 
justifying the attack against the Metro commercial center and 
the fire at the Callao Naval Base, among other actions, the 
subversives say that the attacks "show in fact that the people's 
war continues unavoidably." 
  But the Shining Path leaders of the Sol Peru Committee in 
Paris say that the sabotage is an action of the PCP-SL with the 
objective of demonstrating its capacity for negotiation, carried 
out based on "the new great decision and definition" which is 
the struggle for the peace agreement. 
  "What would be the purpose of a `peace agreement' in Peru?" 
asks Arce Borja in an article in EL DIARIO INTERNACIONAL. He 
answers: "The only ones who will benefit from a `peace 
agreement' are exclusively the enemies of the Peruvian people, 
mainly the imperialist forces." 
  According to the Sol Peru Committee in Paris, Arce Borja and 
Olaechea Cahuas would be the "opportunists and sellouts who are 
carrying out a dirty campaign with the so-called pretext of 
supporting the people's war and attacking our leadership. They 
are reactionary dark leaders whom the people will know how to 
punish." 
  LA REPUBLICA was able to contact by telephone a spokesman 
for 
the Shining Path cells in France, who only confirmed the 
authenticity of the bulletin. 
  LA REPUBLICA also talked with Adolfo Olaechea Cahuas, SL 
chief in England and head of another Sol Peru Committee in 
London, who acknowledged as real the French bulletin and 
identified its writers. Maximiliano Duran Araujo, brother-in-law 
of Osman Morote Barrionuevo and brother of Teresa [Juana Teresa 
Durand Araujo de Morote, aka Comrade Doris], is an SL leader on 
the Central Committee who has been living in France for years, 
and is currently in hiding. 
  We asked Olaechea if he was the one. 
  He said: No, it is someone else. A relative of Guzman.

<F P=106> [Article by Angel Paez of the Research Unit] </F>
  [Text] In publications signed by the Sol Peru Committee in 
Paris, Esparza Marquez or "Comrade Enrique" issues a merciless 
attack on the Shining Path [SL] cells headed by Adolfo Olaechea 
Cahuas and Luis Arce Borja which, from abroad, refuse to accept 
the negotiations between SL leader Abimael Guzman and the 
government. 
  In his book, "SL: The World's Most Lethal Subversive 
Movement," British reporter Simon Strong interviews "Comrade 
Enrique" several times. He says: "Guzman believes he is the 
most reliable militant in Europe." It was he who in 1986 
received Guzman's order to organize cells in 26 European cities. 
  Adolfo Olaechea, chief of the Sol Peru Committee in London, 
who is in direct contact with LA REPUBLICA, said: "Esparza 
Marquez has been against the people's war since 1980, he even 
asked for pardon from the party and President Gonzalo for his 
opposition to the war." 
  Olaechea's comments contrasts with what Simon Strong saw and 
verified. 
  Strong says in his book that "Comrade Enrique" belongs "to 
the cream (of the SL community in Stockholm, Sweden). He 
belongs to the family of Augusta de la Torre whose best brain is 
`Enrique.' He is a soft spoken handsome man who receives the 
respect a mature school director should get." 
  Strong states that Esparza Marquez (who only identifies 
himself as "Enrique" for security reasons) arrived in Sweden in 
November 1982 "after an apparent rupture with Abimael Guzman." 
After "writing a repentance letter" to his sister in-law's 
husband, he received instructions to start SL cells in Europe. 
  Later "Comrade Enrique" obtained Guzman's attention and was 
appointed PCP-SL [Peruvian Communist Party - SL] representative 
to the managing committee of the International Revolutionary 
Movement, MRI, which groups Maoists communists worldwide. 
  Adolfo Olaechea maintains that Esparza Marquez is more like 
the leader of a movement that negotiates with representatives of 
the Alberto Fujimori administration in exchange for personal 
benefits. 
  Olaechea notes: "Opportunistic individuals infiltrated in 
the 
Peruvian revolutionary support movement (...), and seek 
arrangements with Fujimori against the interests of the Peruvian 
people in exchange for personal favors, (this) does not weaken 
but rather strengthens the revollution (...)." He adds: "The 
fact that Mr. Esparza and an insignifcant group have become 
Fujimori's mouthpiece abroad and publish a bulletin entitled 
`SOL PERU', can only cause temporary confusion." 
  But the most serious accusation by Adolfo Olaechea Cahuas, 
who in 1991 organized the Sol Peru Committee in London precisely 
at Comrade Enrique's request, is that Esparza Marquez phones 
Abimael Guzman Reinoso with the approval of the Alberto Fujimori 
adminsitration to expedite the negotiations. 
  According to Olaechea this has been admitted by Esparza 
Marquez himself: "By his own admission, Mr. Esparza has been in 
direct telephone contact for several months with `President 
Gonzalo' with the approval, support, and facilities provided by 
courtesy of Mr. Fujimori and his advisor (Vladimiro) Montesinos 
(Torres)." 
  In his contact with "LA REPUBLICA", Olaechea adds that "Mr. 
Esparza is obviously illegally representing Dr. Guzman. He is 
negotiating but he is also disregarding and overlooking the PCP 
central committee." 
  In a "Sol Peru Committee" bulletin issued in Paris, Esparza 
refers to Luis Arce Borja and Adolfo Olaechia Cahuas. He states 
that those who oppose the Peace Agreement are "opportunists and 
alleged `supporters' of the people's war that is entrenched in 
Europe." 
  According to "Comrade Enrique" and his followers, the 
letters 
issued by Guzman and the Canto Grande inmates are proof enough 
of the PCP-SL's willingness to achieve a Peace Agreement: "They 
are now unable to shout out that 2,500 PCP war criminals are 
`crazy,' `drugged,' that they have made statements `under 
pressure,' or less still that they have `joined the Fujimori 
administration.' They will have to bite their dirty tongues and 
swallow the filthy abominations they have said." 
  Esparza Marquez is undoubtedly referring to the cells led by 
Olaechia and Arce, the director of THE INTERNATIONAL NEWSPAPER 
that is published in Brussels. 
  But Olaechea -- who notes that he and Arce Borja think alike 
-- says: "It does not matter if certain individuals, including 
certain prisoners described by the regime as `SL members,' have 
signed letters supporting the negotiations. This has little 
relevance because the war continues to be conducted by the PCP 
central committee." 
  Olaechea says: "Under the leadership of the PCP central 
committee" not "of President Gonzalo," thus implying that he is 
questioning Guzman's "leadership." 
  Olaechea states: "It is wrong to allege that Olaechea and 
Arce Borja say that `the dialogue does not exist.'" He adds: 
"What is not possible to witness is a sterile dialogue with the 
turncoat dictatorship that is oppressing and massacring the 
people." 
  The London Sol Peru Committee leader said: "It is necessary 
to unmask the false negotiations between the regime and the gang 
of traitors [felipillos] headed by Esparza" which will fail 
"despite the ?illions of lies they tell President Gonzalo in an 
endless litany." 
Luis Arce Borja and Adolfo Olaechea -- the spokesmen in Europe 
of the SL sector that does not believe in dialogue with the 
government and even less in a Peace Agreement -- have stated 
that "the victory of the people's war is irreversible," and that 
no "plot" or "fabrications" will weaken it. 
  Olaechea does not believe his differences of opinion with 
Esparza Marquez -- who controls cells in Sweden, France, Spain, 
the United States, the Netherlands, Denmark, and other countries 
-- constitute a division of the PCP-SL abroad. 
  Olaechea Cahuas believes the SL "is developing the Sixth 
Great Military Plan which seeks to prepare for a strategic 
offensive that will culminate in the seizing of power 
nationwide." He asserts: "Javier Esparza's adventures; the 
letters of this prisoner and the others who either cannot or 
simply will not continue to fight, and the speculations about 
Fujimori's farce, are of little importance and their only 
objective is to confuse and deceive the credulous." 
  Incredibly, Olaechea minimizes the obvious and overwhelming 
differences between the two groups. 
  Olaechea states: "Fujimori's fabrication died a natural 
death 
a long time ago." He adds: "His efforts to revive it by trying 
to agitate the destitute, with Esparza's complicity, is 
temporary. This will be demonstrated shortly." 
  Javier Esparza Marquez, "Comrade Enrique", is married to 
Abimael Guzman's late wife's sister. He is persistently 
described as the Peruvian Government's puppet to divide SL. 
  Esparza Marquez lives in Sweden. He is one of "the 
ambassadors of terror" who faces extradition along with his 
wife, Gisella La Torre Carrasco and her brothers, Boris and 
Carlos -- Abimael Guzman's brothers in law. 
  Olaechea states: "Fujimori and his adviser Montesinos are 
involved in trafficking in lies and bribing the submissive in an 
effort to divide Peruvian revolutionaries." He adds: "He thus 
resorted to Javier Esparza Marquez, the husband of Doctor 
Guzman's late wife's sister." 
  In his communique, Olaechea explains that the Sol Peru 
Committee in Paris is not led by Maximiliano Duran Araujo, 
brother of the outlawed Teresa, the Central Committee leader and 
wife of Osman Morote Barrionuevo. 
  Duran Araujo has been living in Paris for the last decade. 
He was constantly attacked by "the international press" for 
"trafficking with the people's war and usurping the name of the 
party." 
  A nuclear energy expert, Duran Araujo spreads SL propaganda, 
but in his own style. Olaechea said: "In spite of other 
disagreements, it must be stated that Maximiliano Duran is not 
part of this fabrication." 
  In a sort of show of force, Esparza Marquez includes in the 
Sol Peru Committee bulletin statements by other Maoist 
organizations in favor of the Peace Agreement, including that of 
the political bureau of Mexico's Revolutionary Communist Union, 
UCR. 
  Esparza Marquez charges Olaechea, Arce, and their followers 
with disavowing Abimael Guzman as the "PCP chief" (please note 
that they refer to the "Central Committee directorate" which is 
currently commanded by Oscar Ramirez Durand), and with 
distributing false party documents. He makes the following 
threat: 
  "They are spreading despicable concoctions, which have 
unveiled their atrocious ambitions as counterrevolutionary 
gangs, and have devised plans to destroy the PCP's work abroad." 
"Comrade Enrique" states in his publication: "By imitating 
perverse assassins, they are making accusations. The blood 
debts caused by these despicable actions will never be 
forgotten. No matter where they may try to hide, the party's 
iron hand will fall on them." 
  Blood is not precisely a game among Shining Path members. 
  Those who are against the Peace Agreement have showered 
threats on their comrades who support an understanding with the 
regime: They have promised to reduce them "to a few black ashes."

  [Text] Nakhon Si Thammarat -- A powerful bomb went off at 
busy Nakhon Si Thammarat Railway Station around noon yesterday, 
killing three people and injuring 27 others in an apparent 
terrorist attack. No one has claimed responsibility for the 
incident. Police said the explosion came from a cluster of 
baggage in the crowded waiting area near a food stall on the 
platform where the Nakhon Si Thammarat- Bangkok express train 
stood around 12.30 pm. 
  Sutchai Butngam, 40, who kept the food stall, was killed 
instantly, while Rochem Butem, a young man, and a 17-year-old 
woman, Amnuai Raksarat, who suffered serious injuries died later 
at hospital. Eight of those injured were in critical condition 
last night and some may not survive, according to Maharat 
Hospital officials. Most of the casualties were passengers or 
relatives seeing off family members. 
  Provincial Governor Suchan Phongnua expressed outrage at the 
attack but did not lay blame. "The explosion was an act of 
terrorism. It intended to kill people -- poor people, women and 
children," he told reporters at the scene of the blast covered 
with pools of blood, broken tables and chairs, smashed utensils 
and scattered food. 
  Suchan quoted eyewitnesses as saying they saw a young man in 
his mid-20's placing a paper box amid the baggage and casually 
walking away a few minutes before the explosion. The governor 
said police bomb experts had yet to identify the explosive 
device, although an initial report suggested that it was an 
improvised bomb set off manually by a battery-powered detonator 
attached to a time-delay circuit. 
  Security was tightened at the airport, bus terminals, 
wharves, railway stations and government offices throughout the 
province, he said. Terrorist attacks like yesterday's incident 
are impossible to prevent, he said, because the perpetrators did 
not use a time bomb, which can be detected before it goes off. 
  Police Director General Prathin Santipraphop, who arrived 
here from Bangkok to personally direct the investigation into 
the case, said he believed the bomb attack was not linked to the 
separatist movement because the type of bomb used was different. 
Asked whether the attack was aimed at discrediting the 
government, Prathin said police investigators would need some 
time to find out. The national police chief said initial 
findings suggested that there were at least three people 
involved in planting the bomb at the railway station. Prathin 
said yesterday's attack was unpreventable, but acknowledged that 
police will have to improve their intelligence gathering. 
  Deputy Prime Minister Banyat Banthatthan said he was told by 
police that the bomb was designed to create the impression that 
the government is unable to keep peace and order. But he said 
it was premature to link it to "disempowered element". 
  Deputy Foreign Minister Surin Phitsuwan, also Democrat MP 
representing Nakhon Si Thammarat, said he was told by an 
eyewitness that a man apparently lit a fuse to set off the bomb. 
He said the eyewitness saw smoke rising from the paper box just 
before the explosion. Surin, who was in Nakhon Si Thammarat 
yesterday, said it was too early to say whether the blast was in 
any way linked to the separatist movement in Muslim-dominated 
provinces. 
  Police and army bomb experts equipped with metal detectors 
searched the railway station and the train for other bombs but 
found none. 
  The Nakhon Si Thammarat-Bangkok train eventually departed on 
schedule at 1:40 pm, but most of the would-be passengers 
cancelled the journey, fearing for their safety, and had their 
tickets refunded.

  [Text] Cordoba, 19 Apr (NA) -- A low-intensity explosive 
device exploded at the home of an Army official who, according 
to what neighbors reported, had been commissioned to Artillery 
Group No. 161 in Zapala, Neuquen Province. 
  Even though the reports that First Lieutenant Daniel Vega, a 
physician, had been commissioned to that garrison were not 
officially confirmed, they were not denied by military 
authorities either. 
  According to what was made public by Cordoba Province 
Police, 
the explosive device went off at around 0200 local time and 
caused only minor damage and no injuries. 
  The explosion only caused some damage to the door of the 
house located at 112 Jacinto Rios Street in the General Paz

  [Text] Guatemala City, 20 Apr (NOTIMEX) -- Guatemala's 
National Police reported today that the explosion of two bombs, 
one in the capital and the other in the northern department of 
Quiche, disrupted electricity services. 
  According to the police, one of the bombs exploded Tuesday 
evening in a generator of the National Institute of 
Electrification in Quiche. Apparently, this bomb was placed by 
alleged members of the Guatemalan guerrilla forces operating in 
that region. A military patrol force has been sent to the area 
to search for them, but so far no one has been arrested, the 
source said. 
  The source reported that the other bomb exploded at a 
utility 
pole in the capital's southern Zone 13, briefly interrupting 
electricity services. The explosion destroyed the windows of a 
nearby residence. 
  Some residents of Pamplona, a Zone 13 neighborhood, reported 
that a few minutes before the explosion, a group of unidentified 
people were seen in a car near the area acting suspiciously. 
The police report they have initiated investigations to find 
the people responsible for the two attacks. 
  Last February, the guerrillas claimed responsiblity for the 
destruction of six utility poles in Quiche Department and two 
more in the Guatemalan capital.

  [Text] Lima, 21 Apr (EFE) -- According to opposition 
legislator Roger Caceres [National Front of Workers and 
Peasants, FNTC, secretary general], at least 60 people have been 
killed in the offensive launched at the beginning of April by 
the Peruvian Army against Shining Path [SL] terrorists in the 
Huanuco Department jungle area. 
  Refusing to specify whether the dead were SL members or 
civilians, Caceres said he had recently visited the region, and 
charged that military forces are "harming the civilian 
population" with helicopter attacks. 
  Caceres said he had toured several areas in Huanuco's 
Leoncio 
Prado Province, where security forces are conducting the 
military operations. 
  The legislator, who is a member of the Democratic 
Constituent 
Congress (CCD) Human Rights Committee, said he has asked the CCD 
to summon Defense Minister Victor Malca and Interior Minister 
Juan Briones to explain the situation in the region. 
  Caceres has also asked the CCD to summon Attorney General 
Blanca Nelida Colan. 
  In a communique issued 20 April the Defense Ministry denies 
that civilians are either being bombarded or attacked, and 
reports that the antiterrorist military operations were launched 
on 5 April. 
  Moreover, a communique issued by the National Coordinating 
Board of Human Rights reports "massive crimes against a 
defenseless civilian population" in districts on the left bank 
of the Huallaga River. 
  Citing settlers who have fled the region, the Coordinating 
Board reports that "armored helicopters are firing upon the 
civilian population, while military columns on land are 
torturing survivors, raping women, and burning down the 
peasants' huts." 
  Peruvian media reports state that bombardments have been 
carried out during the 15 days the operation has lasted. 
  The Lima newspaper "ONDA" reports that the Army "has 
launched 
an attack by air and by land" and that it is estimated that SL 
forces in the area total 500 men. 
  According to newspaper "ONDA," 70 SL members were killed, 
but 
the killing of civilians has been ruled out. 
  The Defense Ministry communique states that from 5 to 18 
April, 14 terrorists were killed and 12 others arrested in 
clashes between military patrols and SL columns. The communique 
adds that three soldiers were injured. 
  It also states that the military operations "are being 
conducted without affecting local settlers." 
  President Alberto Fujimori has "categorically" denied any 
helicopter bombings. 
  Moreover, Coordinating Board Executive Secretary Rosa Mujica 
insists that civilians have been killed, and has requested that 
the Red Cross be allowed to visit the area.

  [Text] Special Prosecutor for Terrorist Crimes Daniel 
Espichan Tumay today categorically rejected any interference 
from foreign organizations in judging Peruvian laws for fighting 
against terrorism. And in reference to the comments made by 
President Alberto Fujimori, he said the demands of Amnesty 
International will not be met. [begin recording] 
  Espichan: Why do we have to accept orders from 
foreigners, from people who are not aware of our problems or of 
what we have to do? I believe that here in Peru we have very 
intelligent people, well educated people, who know the problem 
of terrorism. We therefore don't have to accept any indications 
from anyone. We are handling the situation ourselves, and are 
winning this war. I therefore believe that the instructions 
given by the president are correct. 
  Unidentified reporter: Does the fact that they 
were not allowed to meet with some officials mean abroad that 
something was being hidden? 
  Espichan: No, because the International Red 
Cross, which is a very important world organization, is 
authorized by law to visit the inmates held on charges of 
terrorism in Peru, and they can give the necessary information 
to any international organization that wants to verify the 
situation of the terrorists. [end recording]

<F P=106> [Report by the "Domestic Affairs Editor"] </F>
  [Excerpts] 'Adil 'Awad Siyam Shulah, notorious terrorist 
and one of the top leaders of the domestic branch of the 
al-Jihad group, lay dead in a pool of blood following a brief 
shootout on al-Bahr al-A'zam Street in al-Jizah on the night of 
4 April. [passage omitted] 
  The slain terrorist was the deputy of Ayman al-Zawahiri, the 
fugitive al-Jihad commander who lives abroad, and the group's 
top man in charge of organization inside Egypt. As described by 
a senior official in the security organs, he was the most senior 
member inside the country and was worth a thousand ordinary 
members. 
  It was Shulah who planned the attempted assassination of 
Interior Minister Hasan al-Alfi. He used to follow him daily 
from his house to his Interior Ministry office so as to prepare 
the plan well. It was Shulah who prepared the members who took 
part in the ambush and the one who convinced one of those 
involved in the crime to undertake the suicidal explosion, 
blowing himself to pieces. 'Adil Siyam's control of his aides 
was so awesome that he imprisoned Diya'-al-Din Dawud Mahmud 
Hafiz, who later carried out the suicidal attack on the interior 
minister, in a locked room for 30 consecutive hours to mentally 
prepare him for the crime, only letting him out to perpetrate 
the crime. It was Shulah who planned to attack Prime Minister 
Dr. 'Atif Sidqi, assassinate Information Minister Safwat 
al-Sharif, and UN Secretary General Dr. Butrus-Ghali during his 
visit to Egypt. His last crime was to plan the assassination of 
the primary witness in Dr. 'Atif Sidqi's case. The witness was 
killed when extremists shot him in the car showroom he owned in 
Shibin al- Qanatir. 
  Notorious terrorist 'Adil lived in the al-Basatin quarter 
but 
moved between dozens of dens in al-Munib, the outskirts of al- 
Qalyubiyah, al-Khankah, Shibin al-Qanatir, and the Bilbays 
desert. He only held an intermediate trade certificate but 
dressed elegantly and wore "RayBan" sunglasses and an elegant 
leather jacket. He spent money freely and drove around in seven 
different cars, all of them stolen. 
  In his various dens security men seized enough explosives to 
blow up an entire city. In two apartments in al-Munib, they 
seized police, officers, and garbage collectors' uniforms, which 
he intended for his group members use when committing terrorist 
crimes. Terrorist 'Adil Siyam's boldness even reached the extent 
of preparing a number of his followers, dressed in municipal 
workers' uniforms, to dig 12 metres across Salah Salim Street at 
a specific spot, which was carefully chosen site for detonating 
explosives in a major operation he was planning. The terrorists 
wearing the municipal workers uniforms did in fact dig up the 
street, lay down electricity cables, and connect them to a 
secret hideout under the street which was to be the center for 
detonating a explosive device to destroy any target that might 
be using that road. Regrettably, no one noticed that those 
digging up the road were terrorists and not municipal workers or 
electricians. 
  The security men also seized an underground factory for 
making explosives in the Bilbays desert. A long tunnel led to a 
spacious hall, where the security men found a number of barrels 
containing acid and chemicals that are used to make explosive 
devices. They also seized 500 grenades that were ready for use. 
  The notorious terrorist was under the security men's close 
observation for a long time. But they preferred to let him stay 
free so as to capture all the members of the organization and 
expose their plans and dens. The security organs did in fact 
arrest 32 persons, including seven hardened criminals who were 
being prepared to carry out suicidal operations similar to the 
attempt to assassinate Interior Minister Hasan al-Alfi. The 
security organs also discovered the means and ways by which 
these groups were financed from abroad. Most of the remittances 
that 'Adil Siyam received came from Palermo, capital of the 
Italian island of Sicily, to an Egyptian bank. The security 
organs monitored their account numbers and balances. The 
remittances that this terrorist received from Palermo alone in 
the last five weeks totalled $14,000, 4,000 pounds Sterling, and 
a few thousand Egyptian pounds, all of which was seized in his 
dens. [passage omitted]

  [Text] A one month-long cease-fire agreement between the 
Fatah Hawks and 'Izz-al-Din al-Qassam, Hamas' [Islamic 
Resistance Movement] military arm, has been reached in the Gaza 
Strip. Our correspondent Nisim Qeynan reports that a leaflet to 
this effect was disseminated in the Gaza Strip today. It states 
that the two sides will halt acts of revenge against 
collaborators in order to enable them to dissociate themselves 
from their support of Israel. The two groups will also put an 
end to mutual acts of hostility and what they term unnecessary 
strikes. It was also decided to set up a committee to 
adjudicate conflicts between the sides during this cease-fire 
period. 
  Our correspondent notes that Fatah leaders in the Strip have 
not reacted to the agreement, but a Palestinian source says it 
was reached with the knowledge of senior leaders in both 
organizations.

<F P=106> [Report by Lamia Lahoud] </F>
  [Text] An agreement between Hamas [Islamic Resistance 
Movement] and Fatah, similar to the one reached in Gaza 
recently, is being negotiated for the rest of the territories, 
Hamas leader Shaykh Bassam Jarrar, of Ramallah, said earlier 
this week. 
  Jarrar, one of the 405 Hamas deportees who returned several 
months ago from south Lebanon, was arrested again on Monday. 
Before his arrest, he told THE JERUSALEM POST that Hamas would 
carry out attacks against Israelis in areas not under 
Palestinian control. According to Fatah sources, Jarrar has 
considerable support among the more radical young elements in 
Hamas. 
  Fatah leader Marwan Barghuthi confirmed Jarrar's statement. 
But he insisted Fatah's aim in making the agreement is to 
persuade the fundamentalist group to cooperate with the 
Palestinian authority and stop its opposition to the autonomy 
accord. 
  Israel has warned the PLO that an agreement to turn a blind 
eye to Hamas attacks against Israelis outside the autonomous 
areas will annul the Israel-PLO agreement. Fatah leaders in the 
territories angrily retort that an agreement with Hamas is an 
inter-Palestinian affair designed to keep Hamas quiet and does 
not concern Israel. 
  "In areas under our control we can ask Hamas to stop attacks 
against Israelis in order not to destroy the autonomy accord. 
Outside our areas, we have no control," said Barghuthi. 
  Barghuthi, a member of the Fatah Revolutionary Command, is 
one of the deportees who returned two weeks ago. He said he had 
been involved in negotiations with Hamas in Jordan while working 
for the PLO office in Amman. 
  He argues that it is against Fatah's interest to let Hamas 
continue attacks against Israel while Fatah talks peace. These 
attacks, he said, increase popular support for Hamas. 
  Shaykh Jamil Hamami of eastern Jerusalem, who declines to be 
called a Hamas member following the wave of arrests of Hamas 
activists in recent days, refers to himself as a member of the 
Islamic movement. Hamami said autonomy will be implemented 
despite Hamas's efforts to sabotage the agreement, and he is 
certain Hamas will try to reach an agreement with the 
Palestinian authority to avoid internecine bloodshed. It will 
be difficult, he admitted, because the PLO will be bound by an 
agreement to ensure calm and cooperate with Israel on security 
measures, but "both Hamas and Fatah will find ways to avoid 
confrontation." 
  Hinting that Hamas may temporarily use political means 
rather 
than violence, Hamami nevertheless insisted that Hamas will 
continue to attack Israelis. "No one can forbid us to attack 
the occupation force. We will strike at the Zionist pirates 
wherever we find them," he said, adding that for Hamas, Haifa 
and Yafo are occupied Palestinian lands too. 
  Nor would the Hamas denounce attacks against Israelis to 
gain 
a release of its prisoners, Hamami insisted. The PLO has asked 
Israel to release Hamas prisoners if the movement denounces 
violence against Israeli civilians. But he said the release of 
prisoners is not a gift from the PLO or Israel, but a 
Palestinian right. 
  "They are negotiating a prisoner release while Israel is 
arresting hundreds of Hamas people. This should be an 
indication to the PLO that Israel is not serious about peace, 
and 'Arafat should stop the negotiations," he said. 
  "These statements could mean that Hamas is changing its 
policy and will recognize a peace treaty with Israel, or they 
could be a trial balloon to see what Hamas could gain from it," 
said Riyad al- Maliki, spokesman for PFLP [Popular Front for the 
Liberation of Palestine]. 
  Hamas leaders themselves still don't seem to know what to 
do. 
"We will wait and see, and adapt our methods to the new 
circumstances," admitted Hamami.

  [Text] In the Gaza Strip, an agreement has been reached 
between Fatah Hawks cells and the cells of 'Izz-al-Din 
al-Qassam, the military wing of the Hamas movement. The 
agreement has been blessed by the leaders of the two movements. 
On this agreement and its repercussions, Sa'id Mu'addi spoke 
with Rashid Abu-Shibak, a Fatah leader in the Gaza Strip. [begin 
recording] 
  Mu'addi: Mr. Rashid Abu-Shibak, a leader of 
Fatah in the Gaza Strip, what does the Hamas-Fatah agreement 
stipulate? 
  Abu-Shibak: The agreement is between the Fatah 
Hawks and the 'Izzl-al-Din al-Qassam Battalions. It has six 
major points. The first talks about an immediate halt to 
defamation campaigns between the two factions, while ensuring 
everybody's right to free expression, as well as holding further 
brotherly dialogue between the two factions in the interests of 
the Palestinian masses. The second point speaks about 
renouncing differences and bloody conflicts and steering clear 
of the use of violence as a means to resolve differences. This 
point also emphasizes constructive dialogue between the sons of 
our people. The third point is that as of the date of this 
agreement, the pursued and armed men on both sides shall be 
forbidden to interfere and resolve organizational and family 
problems. This task will be assumed by national and Islamic 
reconciliation committees. The fourth point states that in view 
of the deteriorating economic conditions, it has been decided 
that a strike in the event of the martyrdom of any citizen shall 
last only one day in his vicinity. The rest of the areas will 
declare mourning but will not be on strike. Fifth, male and 
female students are asked to attend classes on strike days, 
because we do not want our students to miss classes. Finally, 
Fatah and Hamas have decided to stop the killing of agents as of 
the date of this agreement for one month and to declare this 
one-month period as a repentance period. These are the points 
of the agreement. 
  Mu'addi: Mr. Abu-Shibak, how did the idea of 
holding dialogue and reaching such an agreement crystallize 
between the two movements? 
  Abu-Shibak: First of all, the idea of holding 
dialogue has always been one of our traditions in Fatah and also 
on the part of Hamas. Our dialogue with Hamas has never stopped 
for one minute. However, praise be to God, our dialogue has this 
time been crowned by an agreement that will contribute to 
stopping the suffering of our people as much as possible. 
  Mu'addi: Mr. Abu-Shibak, Israeli quarters have 
voiced concern over such agreements and Prime Minister Yitzhaq 
Rabin has said such agreement could affect the 
Israeli-Palestinian agreement. 
  Abu-Shibak: I do not think the topic addressed by 
Rabin has anything to do with the agreement we are talking 
about. Our agreement with Hamas addresses daily problems and 
concerns that face Palestinian citizens in the Gaza Strip. It 
has nothing to do with a specific political agreement. 
  Mu'addi: Can we take the agreement between the 
Fatah Hawks and the 'Izz-al-Din al-Qassam cells to be a 
forerunner of possibly another agreement between the leaders of 
the two movements, Fatah and Hamas, during the self-rule period? 
  Abu-Shibak: We hope this will be the case. We 
will seek a broader and more inclusive agreement between Fatah 
and Hamas. There is a good chance for such an agreement, 
particularly since we, along with the brothers in the Hamas 
movement, very much want everybody to take part in the 
forthcoming self-rule authority, since this will be for the good 
of all the Palestinian masses in the future. 
  Mu'addi: Was the agreement blessed by the leaders 
of Fatah and Hamas in the Gaza Strip? 
  Abu-Shibak: Yes, completely. We stress this 
agreement and consider it an important and positive step toward 
improving our relationship with the brothers in Hamas. 
  Mu'addi: Mr. Rashid Abu-Shibak, thank you very 
much. 
  Abu-Shibak: You are welcome. [end recording]

  [Text] The heads of most terror organizations in the Gaza 
Strip have met in Gaza over the last two days. The meetings 
included Hamas [Islamic Resistance Movement], Islamic Jihad, and 
rejectionist organizations members. The meetings were held to 
prepare for the autonomy period. Our correspondent Nisim Qeynan 
reports the meetings were initiated by PLO officials in the Gaza 
Strip. The participants discussed cooperation possibilities 
between the various organizations, with the view of establishing 
a civilian and security cooperation apparatus after the IDF 
[Israel Defense Forces] withdraws from the area. The meetings 
were held against the background of an agreement reached 
yesterday between 'Izz-al-Din al-Qassam, Hamas' military arm, 
and the Fatah Hawks on putting an end to acts of revenge against 
collaborators and stopping the strikes.

<F P=106> [Report by 'Amira Hess and Yosi Torpstein] </F>
  [Excerpt] The Fatah Hawks and Hamas' [Islamic Resistance 
Movement] 'Izz-al-Din al-Qassam group have announced their joint 
decision to stop killing collaborators for a period of one 
month, "on condition that during that period all efforts will be 
directed toward dealing with this phenomenon." They also urge 
the collaborators to "cut off their relations with the enemy's 
Shin Bet apparatus." The two groups also forbid all their armed 
and wanted men to intervene in conflicts between families and 
organizations, rather to let special reconciliation committees 
-- or when necessary, the political level -- deal with such 
conflicts. 
  In a jointly signed leaflet disseminated in Gaza two days 
ago 
it is stated that the representatives of both sides have held a 
"historic session" and reached an agreement "aimed at 
strengthening national unity." The leaflet reiterates that this 
is necessary in order to foil Israeli attempts to polarize the 
Palestinian nation. The leaflet details six decisions regarding 
relations between the two groups and their violent treatment of 
various problems and social phenomena: To immediately stop 
mutual recriminations campaigns between Fatah and Hamas, while 
respecting all parties' freedom of expression; to stop all 
bloody feuds (which have recently proliferated between members 
of both organizations); "armed and wanted men from both sides 
are banned from intervening in conflicts between families and 
organizations." 
  The leaflet urges to minimize the number of strikes, limit 
their scope (for example, to the neighborhood of a victim only), 
and in emergencies to jointly declare a strike; school children 
are urged not to take advantage of strike days, but rather to 
stick to their studies and oppose those who force them to 
strike; the two groups undertake to stop killing collaborators 
for a period of one month, during which period they will discuss 
this phenomenon and give the collaborators an opportunity to 
mend their way. 
  These decisions clearly reflect the growing criticism and 
dissatisfaction in the Gaza Strip concerning the behavior of the 
two groups and the terror they strike in people due to their 
trigger-happy mentality. Declaring a strike as a form of 
mourning has become a power demonstration method vis-a-vis other 
organizations, but this disrupts economic life -- which is 
difficult enough as it is. Despite the explicit instruction to 
continue studies on strike days, many students take advantage of 
this situation to skip school, and there are many complaints 
about the deteriorating level of studies. 
  The intervention of armed fugitives from both organizations 
in various conflicts has already threatened to develop into 
bloody conflicts between the two organizations. In the Gaza 
Strip there is a phenomenon of "piratical confiscation" of 
vacant lots for enlarging houses or building stalls. In Rafah, 
for example, Fatah Hawks more than one month ago demolished a 
building built by Hamas for public ends (a medical center and 
kindergarten). When Hamas people tried to rebuild it, Fatah 
Hawks opened fire, killed one person and wounded approximately 
25. 
  Regarding collaborators, people in Gaza tend to believe that 
people who are murdered by 'Izz-al-Din al-Qassam are indeed 
proven collaborators, and that they are not assassinated rashly. 
At the same time, despite the fact that everybody hates the 
collaborators, people are concerned about the ramifications of 
the almost daily killings, about possible "mistakes" and about 
the danger of vendettas. From various comments made by Fatah 
and Hamas people alike, it is clear that they too are concerned 
about the liberty taken by armed fugitives in these issues, 
mainly Fatah Hawks members. [passage omitted]

  [Text] Tunis, 23 Apr (MENA) -- A prominent Palestinian 
source from Fatah, the biggest faction within the PLO, has 
stated that the agreement announced yesterday between Fatah and 
Hamas [Islamic Resistance Movement] is a "political agreement" 
that seeks to work out a specific formula for Hamas to 
participate in institutions of the future Palestinian national 
authority. The source described it as "more than just an 
agreement on cease-fire and bilateral differences." 
  The source, who took part in the recent round of 
negotiations 
with Hamas leaders in Gaza, added that Hamas had submitted 
proposals for participation in the Palestinian national 
institutions, including the Palestinian police. He pointed out 
that Palestinian president Yasir 'Arafat welcomed Hamas' offer 
and willingness to join the national authority, despite its 
earlier opposition to the Palestinian-Israeli Declaration of 
Principles. He noted that 'Arafat had accepted in principle the 
proposals made by Hamas in Gaza. The proposals were also 
approved by Musa Abu-Marzuq, head of the movement's [not further 
specified] political bureau. 
  The source stressed that 'Arafat will soon meet Hamas 
leaders 
in an Arab capital, probably Amman, to work out a final 
agreement on Hamas' participation in the Palestinian national 
authority. 'Arafat, the source added, is convinced that Hamas' 
new position represents a practical stand on the 
Palestinian-Israeli Declaration of Principles. It shows Hamas' 
desire not to be isolated from the future Palestinian national 
authority's institutions, particularly since other Palestinian 
factions, such as the George Habash-led Palestinian Front for 
the Liberation of Palestine, have expressed a desire to join 
them. 
  The same source said that during its meeting in Tunis under 
'Arafat yesterday, Fatah's Central Committee endorsed the 
agreement with Hamas.

<F P=106> [Article by JORDAN TIMES Staff Reporters P.V. Vivekanand in </F>
Amman and Wafa' 'Amr in Jerusalem] 
  [Text] The Islamic Resistance Movement, Hamas, on Friday 
denied that it was signalling a shift in its fundamental 
approach to the Arab-Israeli conflict by offering to recognise 
Israel in its 1967 borders and negotiate a peace agreement with 
the Jewish state. 
  The group, in a statement issued by its Damascus-based 
political office, sought to reestablish that its objective was 
the creation of an Islamic state "from the (Mediterranean) Sea 
to the (Jordan) River," and that recent comments made by one of 
its senior leaders were misinterpreted by the media to imply 
that it was willing to abandon its call for the elimination of 
the state of Israel. 
  It appeared that the "clarification" owed its origins to 
differences from within the group's ranks in the occupied West 
Bank and Gaza Strip. 
  Islamist activists and political analysts in the occupied 
territories said Hamas' leaders, fearing political exclusion at 
a time when the Palestine Liberation Organisation (PLO) are 
moving towards Palestinian self-rule in parts of the occupied 
lands, had rushed into making conciliatory statements in a bid 
to ensure their survival. 
  As such, Friday's statement was interpreted as a move to 
reassure those in the occupied territories who in principle 
reject any recognition of Israel, whether 1948 or 1967, by 
reaffirminig that there was no shift at all in the group's 
standing. 
  Several Hamas leaders said although the conciliatory stand 
was aimed at preempting isolation, it was also meant to show the 
Palestinian people that Hamas was capable of achieving better 
negotiating terms and a peace accord more responsive to the 
Palestinians' aspirations that the Israel-PLO autonomy agreement. 
  At the same time, the group's leaders have to take into 
consideration the opposition such a stand sparked among the 
young generation of Palestinians. 
  "Hamas' grassroots, like all the young Palestinian 
generation, are desperate for independence," a leading Hamas 
figure told the JORDAN TIMES in occupied Jerusalem. "Therefore 
any peace proposal suggested by Hamas' high echelon will have to 
take this into consideration." 
  Fatah leaders who have maintained a secret dialogue with 
Hamas affirmed that they were aware of a "change" in the 
Islamist group's stand and welcmed it because it gave an added 
momentum to demands for an independent Palestinian state in the 
territories Israel seized in the 1967 war. 
  Shaykh Ahmad Bahar, an Islamic leader in Gaza, said the 
group 
was "willing to negotiate with Israel to achieve Israeli 
withdrawal from the Palestinian lands it occupied in 1967 on the 
basis of U.N. resolutions. But this does not mean that Hamas 
has departed from its strategic goal of liberating all of 
Palestine." 
  Friday's statement, a copy of which was made available to 
the 
JORDAN TIMES, echoed the same sentiment. It said Hamas was 
committed to "escalating popular resistance and continuing holy 
war as long as the Zionist occupation forces remain in our 
blessed Palestinian land and until the liberation of all the 
occupied land from the sea to the river." 
  It said comments made by Musa Abu-Marzuq, head of the 
group's 
politcal bureau, that a peace treaty was possible with Israel if 
it withdrew from the West Bank, the Gaza Strip and Jerusalem did 
not imply any "concession to or acceptance of the Zionist enemy." 
  Explaining that the statement was issued to clarify the 
group's stand "in view of the popular and official reactions" to 
Mr. Abu- Marzuq's comments, "Which were not seen in their full 
context or misinterpreted," the group said its "political 
programme" called for: 
  -- Total and complete unconditional Israeli withdrawal from 
the West Bank, the Gaza Strip and Jerusalem; 
  -- The elimination of all settlements and removal of 
settlers 
from these areas; (The statement did not refer to Mr. 
Abu-Marzuq's call for Israeli compensation for the losses 
Palestinians suffered as a result of occupation. 
  -- Fair, full and free elections among the Palestinian 
people 
living inside and outside the occupied territories to elect a 
leadership which will be the sole authority to speak and take 
decisions on behalf of the Palestinian people and represent 
their goals and aspirations. 
  Here was the key departure of the group from what Mr. 
Abu-Marzuq had said. 
  The statement said: "If Hamas manages to win the confidence 
of the Palestinians, it will express and reflect the will of our 
people and mobilize popular forces to achieve the full 
liberation of our land." 
  (Mr. Abu-Marzuq had referred to the possibility of a "peace 
treaty" although he did not say between whom). 
  According to Hamas leaders in the occupied territories, the 
strategy as outlined in Friday's statement helps Hamas secure a 
role in the present political process. Without such a strategy, 
they said, Hamas would be left alone unable to influence the 
course of political developments. 
  Shaykh Bahar said the political leadership of the group 
outside the occupied territories has also taken a decision to 
participate in elections to the self-rule institutions envisaged 
under the Israel- PLO accord, but no decision has been taken on 
how Hamas should tackle the PLO's domination of the autonomy 
arrangements. 
  Shaykh Jamil Hamami, another Islamic leader in the occupied 
territories, said the decision was not acceptable since 
"participation in elections will give legitimacy to the 
self-rule authority." 
  The immediate objective of the group, he reaffirmed, is to 
"foil the self-rule deal itself." 
  Palestinian peace negotiator Frayh Abu-Middayn said Hamas 
had 
demonstrated political flexibility and pragmatism following the 
expulsion of more than 300 of its members in December 1992. 
  He said Hamas' peace overtures were a message directed at 
the 
PLO and not at Israel. 
  "They are telling the PLO we will not sit at the negotiating 
table with Israel. But we will have a share in the cake by 
being accepted as partners by the PLO," Mr. Abu-Middayn said. 
  Political analyst Mahdi 'Abd-al-Hadi argued that reasons 
behind Hamas' new stance were: 
  --If Hamas continued resisting Israeli occupation through 
rejectionist stances, it will be labelled the number one enemy 
to Israel and the U.S., and thus will have to pay a price it 
could not afford. 
  -- If it drew closer to the PLO's political position and 
participated in self-rule institutions, it would facilitate 
implementation of the PLO-Israel accord but without granting it 
legitimacy, and it would isolate the opposition inside the PLO 
against participation in the Palestinian authority.

<F P=106> [Interview with Sufyan Abu-Zayidah, a prominent Fatah </F>
official in the Gaza Strip, by Amnon Levi -- live] 
  [Text] 
  Levi: Fatah and Hamas [Islamic Resistance 
Movement] have signed a cooperation agreement and disseminated 
it this weekend in a joint leaflet, which deals with 
collaborators, strikes, and demonstrations. It fails, however, 
to even mention the peace agreement or Israel. Sufyan 
Abu-Zayidah, what is this agreement all about? 
  Abu-Zayidah: First, this is an internal agreement 
in the Gaza Strip. It is not related to the peace process, but 
rather to the internal relations between the Palestinian people 
in the Gaza Strip. 
  Levi: It broaches issues which relate to your 
daily affairs, such as the issue of collaborators, does it not? 
  Abu-Zayidah: Precisely. The leaflet first of all 
calls for a propaganda lull between the two organizations, and 
this is a natural thing. It also calls for halting the 
assassination of people suspected of collaboration -- and this 
is the important thing. I have always struggled against Hamas 
and the rejectionist front organizations -- and within our 
organization as well -- with a view to stop the assassination of 
people suspected of... 
  Levi interrupting: How many suspects are being 
assassinated monthly, in your estimation? 
  Abu-Zayidah: In the Gaza Strip at least 10-15 
people are killed every month. 
  Levi: You just find a corpse lying around 
somewhere in the morning? 
  Abu-Zayidah: We find somebody who has been killed 
because he was suspected of being a collaborator. People are 
very concerned about this. 
  Levi: What about other issues, such as 
distribution of land? 
  Abu-Zayidah: Yes, this issue directly relates to 
Israeli rule. When the Israelis announced their intention to 
withdraw soon, people started worrying about what will happen to 
state-owned land. In the past people who took over state-owned 
land were fined. Now people have practically stormed these lots. 
  Levi: Is this leaflet part of Fatah's efforts to 
assume authority in the Gaza Strip in anticipation of the 
withdrawal? 
  Abu-Zayidah: We do not regard Fatah as being in 
authority, but rather the entire Palestinian people. 
  Levi: This is a nice slogan, but Fatah will be in 
control. 
  Abu-Zayidah: We want the entire Palestinian 
people to rule, not Fatah. 
  Levi: I read in the newspaper that the 
Palestinians believe this agreement is historic. Why is it so 
important? 
  Abu-Zayidah: It is important because we are in the 
midst of a critical period of transition. The entire world, 
including the Israelis, believe that once the IDF [Israel 
Defense Forces] pulls out there will be a massacre in the Gaza 
Strip and armed militia, Lebanese style, will roam the streets. 
Via this leaflet, as well as in meetings held over the last 
three days, we are trying to prove that this will not happen. 
The Palestinian nation is mature and will abide by the peace 
agreement. It will manage to sustain all the internal contrasts. 
  Levi: Are you aware of the fact that Israelis are 
concerned about a Fatah-Hamas agreement, because we regard Hamas 
as a murderous terror organization? 
  Abu-Zayidah: I am aware of this. You have a 
problem in this respect, because you think that every Hamas 
member wants to chase you with a knife. The truth is that Hamas 
represents 30 percent of the Palestinian people. It is in the 
interest of Fatah, the PLO, and the peace process, that Hamas be 
included rather than excluded from the Palestinian regime. 
  Levi: How is it, then, that you did not include 
even one clause of support in the peace process, if not in 
Israel itself? 
  Abu-Zayidah: We are constantly exerting great 
efforts to keep Hamas close to us. We have not succeeded in 
terms of what you call stopping the armed struggle, because at 
the present time they do not ask us before they carry out 
attacks. 
  Levi: This weekend the agreement may be signed, 
and in two or three weeks Gaza could be in your hands. Aside 
from the great joy, are you also afraid? 
  Abu-Zayidah: I am not afraid, but I hope we will 
succeed.

<F P=106> [Interview with Muhammad Nazzal, official spokesman for the </F>
Islamic Resistance Movement, Hamas, by unidentified reporter in 
Amman; date not given] 
  [Text] 
  AL-WATAN AL-'ARABI: Was the 'Afula bombing a 
reprisal for the Ibrahimi Mosque massacre or does it fall within 
the framework of a strategy? Or is it a novel mode of militancy 
against the Israeli occupation? 
  [Nazzal: The 'Afula operation executed by the 
al-Qassam Battalions -- Hamas' military wing -- was the first 
reprisal for the Hebron massacre. Four more, just as forceful 
and impressive, are yet to come. 
  AL-WATAN AL-'ARABI: Some Palestinians have spoken 
out against an operation that targeted civilians and cast the 
conflict in racial terms, pitting Arab against Israeli, when in 
actual fact it is one of liberation, and so armed struggle in 
all its forms must be directed at only the occupation military. 
How do you react? 
  [Nazzal: In the 40-day interval between the Hebron 
massacre and the 'Afula bombing, the Palestinian people realized 
the international community is not about to take revenge for 
them or compensate them in any way. A statement of condemnation 
was all that the UN Security Council did, which made no 
difference. Therefore, all segments of the Palestinian people 
rejoiced at the operation and saw in it something of a morale 
booster. The Palestinians who came out against it are a 
scattered minority whom the operation put on the spot and pulled 
the rug from under them. 
  AL-WATAN AL-'ARABI: Can you state with certainty 
that the next operations will be modelled on the 'Afula 
operation? 
  [Nazzal: All I can say is that they will be 
forceful enough to match the enormity and odiousness of the 
Hebron massacre. 
  AL-WATAN AL-'ARABI: You have a significant 
political presence in Jordan and Syria, both of which are 
involved in the peace process. It appears the 'Afula operation 
has had the consequence of pushing Washington to move against 
you in the two countries. Have you come under any official 
pressure? 
  [Nazzal: As I have said, the operation was greeted 
with universal jubilation in Arab and Muslim circles, because it 
was in response to the crime and to avenge the martyrs. Sadly, 
however, the PLO was the only Arab quarter to deplore this 
heroic action. 
  AL-WATAN AL-'ARABI: But you haven't come under any 
official pressure? 
  [Nazzal: None of the Arab states has criticized us 
or applied any pressure on account of the 'Afula operation. 
  AL-WATAN AL-'ARABI: Information suggests the PLO 
has complained to Jordan because of your national political role 
in the Jordanian arena. Have you been informed of this 
complaint? 
  [Nazzal: We learned about this complaint through 
unofficial sources, but no one has contacted us in this 
connection. If anything, this shows the PLO leadership is 
facing a serious predicament, to the extent that it is lodging 
complaints with the U.S. Administration to pressure Jordan. I 
think Jordan understands the position of the Hamas movement on 
the political settlement and pursuing the resistance against the 
occupation. 
  AL-WATAN AL-'ARABI: After the 'Afula operation, 
Israel has once again reiterated that your movement receives 
financial support from Iran and that those who planned and 
carried out the operation had received training by Hizballah 
when they were in Marj al-Zuhur in southern Lebanon. How true 
is this? 
  [Nazzal: I do not believe the Hamas movement is 
incapable of developing its security and military capabilities. 
The movement has a highly qualified military agency which is 
gaining more experience day after day. Therefore, talking about 
Iranian or foreign financing is not true. 
  AL-WATAN AL-'ARABI: Then where does your financing 
come from? 
  [Nazzal: I can stress that Hamas finances itself 
by itself and from popular quarters. So far we have not 
received a penny from any government. 
  AL-WATAN AL-'ARABI: Some reports say Hamas is 
involved in schemes to finish off Yasir 'Arafat in order to 
abort the peace process. How true is this? 
  [Nazzal: Hamas does not believe in political 
assassination. It thinks its efforts should be geared toward 
facing the occupation and its tools. What is being said about a 
plan to assassinate 'Arafat or other Palestinian personalities 
is unfounded. 
  AL-WATAN AL-'ARABI: But how are you going to deal 
with the fact that 'Arafat and the Palestinian leadership will 
soon be in Gaza and Jericho, and then the rest of the West Bank? 
  [Nazzal: It is Hamas policy not to clash with 
Palestinian authority and its tools. This, however, does not at 
all mean that the resistance will stop. Therefore, Hamas will 
pursue its approach to resist the occupation until the objective 
of removing the occupation is achieved. 
  AL-WATAN AL-'ARABI: Do you have any information to 
prove that 'Arafat has agreed with the Israelis to get rid of 
Hamas? 
  [Nazzal: We have information about intelligence 
meetings between Palestinian and Israeli security agencies for 
coordination against Hamas and to exchange information on Hamas 
leaders, cadres, and activities. 
  AL-WATAN AL-'ARABI: To what extent are you afraid 
of such meetings, especially during the next phase, when 'Arafat 
returns home and controls matters in the West Bank and Gaza? 
  [Nazzal: Undoubtedly, we view with extreme caution 
the cooperation between the Palestinian and the occupation 
authorities, as this cooperation will be aimed against any 
Palestinian opposition. But we believe the Palestinian masses 
will bend toward those who express their hopes and aspirations. 
They will eject whoever cooperates with the occupation. We 
reflect the Palestinian masses' determination to continue 
resistance to the occupation. 
  AL-WATAN AL-'ARABI: Some reports mention the 
movement of some Fatah Hawks to Hamas because the Tunis 
leadership has stopped sending them money, thus restraining 
their military movement against Israel. How true is that? 
  [Nazzal: Definitely, there is large-scale 
opposition within the Fatah ranks against the political 
settlement. This opposition is expanding to encompass large 
sectors. Hamas has relations and contacts with honorable and 
sincere Fatah personnel, some of whom have been absorbed within 
Hamas, especially military personnel. Hopefully, this will 
enrich Hamas' experience, especially after it has been joined by 
some experienced Fatah cadres. 
  AL-WATAN AL-'ARABI: It seems the experience of the 
Fatah personnel who have joined you has appeared in the 'Afula 
operation? 
  [Nazzal: When any experienced personnel joins 
Hamas, this will be a qualitative addition to Hamas' experience. 
We believe any cooperation between Hamas and Fatah military 
personnel will be a real threat to the occupation and its tools. 
  AL-WATAN AL-'ARABI: You have maintained channels 
to Fatah inside in the occupied territories. Do you have 
channels to the Fatah command abroad? Have such channels helped 
establish coordination between the two movements? 
  [Nazzal: Official contacts with the Fatah command 
abroad have been frozen since the Oslo agreement. We maintain 
individual contacts with Fatah oppositionists. But they are 
personal contacts. 
  AL-WATAN AL-'ARABI: Are you planning to develop 
your contacts with the opposition to abort the peace process? 
  [Nazzal: We welcome any contacts and coordination 
with Fatah's oppositionists if that helps the resistance to 
occupation. 
  AL-WATAN AL-'ARABI: But are they equally willing 
to do that? 
  [Nazzal: Already some Fatah activists are 
coordinating with Hamas. 
  AL-WATAN AL-'ARABI: And on the top leadership 
level? 
  [Nazzal: No coordination there. 
  AL-WATAN AL-'ARABI: You came out against the 
reinstatement of Mustafa al-Natshah as Hebron mayor and demanded 
municipal elections. How is it that you support municipal 
elections that the occupation does not mind, and, at the same 
time, you do not want to contest elections for a Palestinian 
authority that the occupation also has no objection to? 
  [Nazzal: We are for municipal elections that are 
not tied to any political agenda in particular. This is because 
municipal elections are the only means available to provide 
services to the Palestinian population, as well as to alleviate 
the hardships under which they are living, and enhance their 
health and social services. We want municipal elections to be 
held in all the Palestinian cities. Elections were held in 1976 
without them being tied to any political agenda, at a time when 
all Palestinian forces, then adopting the same posture as that 
of Hamas now, refused to extend recognition to the Zionist 
enemy. Thus we see nothing wrong in holding elections, but they 
must be unconnected to any political agenda. 
  AL-WATAN AL-'ARABI: Uri Sagi, head of Israeli 
intelligence, said in press statements that Hamas will field 
candidates in the elections for the Palestinian authority under 
a banner that does not bear the name of Hamas. He explains that 
the Hamas pragmatists in the occupied territories will press for 
participation. What do you think? 
  [Nazzal: Hamas' position is not to take part in 
the self-rule elections -- a decision consistent with our 
opposition to the Gaza- Jericho agreement and its spin-offs. 
Any word about Hamas contesting these elections is speculative 
and not based on hard facts. 
  AL-WATAN AL-'ARABI: Is that your last word on the 
issue? 
  [Nazzal: Our position holds for the time being. 
I don't know about the future. Everything is subject to a 
review. 
  AL-WATAN AL-'ARABI: I take it then that your 
participation in the elections is not ruled out? 
  Nazzal: We are open to all options.

  [Text] Gaza City, Occupied Gaza Strip, April 21 (AFP) -- 
The Islamic Resistance Movement HAMAS claimed responsibility 
Thursday for ambushing two Jewish settlers who were wounded on 
the Gaza Strip. 
  HAMAS announced in a statement that Wednesday's shooting was 
the "first, swift response against continued Israeli arrests of 
its members." 
  Israel has arrested nearly 500 Islamic fundamentalist 
suspects, according to Palestinian sources, in a bid to break up 
the HAMAS network. About 240 were detained on the Gaza Strip 
alone this week. 
  Meanwhile, clashes continued on the strip. Soldiers shot and 
wounded three Palestinians in Gaza City and two more in nearby 
Jabaliya refugee camp, Palestinian sources said. 
  Military officials said two settlers driving a car near the 
Gush Katif settlement were shot by Palestinian gunmen on 
Wednesday evening. 
  "Two of our fighters ambushed a car carrying two settlers 
... 
the bullets of 'Izz-al-Din al-Qassam were awaiting them and our 
fighters opened fire on them using M-16 guns." 'Izz-al-Din 
al-Qassam is the HAMAS military wing. 
  The typed message warned that the operation, carried out by 
the "clandestine unit number 7," will be followed by others 
"with the dawn of every day, until the end of all occupation of 
our land." 
  HAMAS carried out two bus bombings this month killing 12 
Israelis in retaliation for the Hebron massacre of 30 Moslem 
worshippers by a Jewish settler.

<F P=106> [Report by Pinhas 'Inbari] </F>
  [Text] The 'Izz-al-Din al-Qassam squads yesterday 
clarified for the first time that they will stop fighting Israel 
when it withdraws from the Gaza Strip and the West Bank. This 
is the first time an 'Izz-al-Din al-Qassam leaflet has featured 
such a statement. 
  The belligerent leaflet announces that Hamas [Islamic 
Resistance Movement] is not intimidated by arrests. On the 
contrary, the recent spate of arrests will inspire it to 
escalate its struggle. The leaflet warns Shin Bet officers that 
their fate will be similar to that of No'am Kohen and Hayim 
Nahmani. 
  The leaflet goes on to point out, however, that the movement 
will pursue its war on "terrorists Rabin and Baraq" as long as 
even a single Israeli soldier remains in the West Bank and Gaza. 
Until now, the leaflets of the military branch of Hamas have 
always referred to an all-out war, and not to a war until the 
end of occupation.

  [Text] Sanaa, 22 Apr (INA) -- The Political Bureau of the 
Islamic Resistance Movement, Hamas, has stressed the continued 
escalation of military operations against the Zionist occupation 
forces as long as occupation exists on Palestinian territory. 
  In a statement published in Sanaa yesterday, Hamas urged the 
unconditional withdrawal of the Zionist forces from the West 
Bank, Gaza Strip, and Jerusalem as well as the removal of the 
settlements, the evacuation of the settlers from the West Bank, 
Gaza Strip, and Jerusalem and the holding of free legislative 
elections for the Palestinian people inside and outside the 
occupied territories.

    [Editorial Report] Cairo ROSE AL-YUSUF in Arabic on 18 
April publishes on pages 18-20 a 3,000-word article by columnist 
'Abd-al- Sattar al-Tawilah responding to the statement issued by 
the Islamic Research Council, headed by al-Azhar's grand imam, 
which denounces secularist writers for casting doubts on 
al-Azhar's authority regarding Islamic affairs. 
  Al-Tawilah, who says he learned of the statement with "both 
astonishment and shock," argues that it "explicitly announces 
support for extremism and the extremists." He says al-Azhar, by 
this statement, "has changed its negative stance to one 
positively favoring the enemies of the nation." Explaining 
this, the writer notes that the al-Azhar statement, in its 
attack against secular intellectuals, says that they fight 
extremism with even more misleading and harmful extremism. 
This, he says, gives the terrorists an excuse to fight this 
more misleading and harmful extremism. 
  Elaborating on this, al-Tawilah states: "All supporters of 
extremism and terrorism justify terrorist criminal acts by 
saying that this or that writer said something against religion, 
hurting the sensitive feelings of those extremist boys and 
angering those who harbor them in the dark. So they decided to 
demolish banks, kill scores of men, women, and children, and 
harm thousands of families." He adds: "The al-Azhar council is 
using the same justification, giving the terrorists the green 
light for further terrorism." 
  Al-Tawilah maintains that Egyptian intellectuals from both 
the left and right have always respected al-Azhar and 
highlighted its role in defending Islam and preserving the 
Islamic heritage. He gives examples of many Egyptian leftist 
writers and thinkers who highlighted the good image of Islam and 
served religion in their literature. The problem, he says, is 
that the intellectuals reject the right of religious authorities 
to decide what can be published and what cannot. "The 
difference lies in the fact that we do not want al-Azhar or 
other religious institutions to impose an executive control over 
our intellectual activity and mental interpretations," he says. 
He adds: "That is, we object to al-Azhar making decisions, but 
accept its making recommendations, giving opinions, and writing 
reports." 
  Concluding, al-Tawilah says: "The attempt to provoke a 
battle between al-Azhar and the Egyptian intellectuals serves 
only the enemies of Islam, foremost of whom are the extremist 
terrorists." 
  In an 1,800-word article on pages 20-21 of the 18 April 
issue 
of Cairo ROSE AL-YUSUF, writer Ibrahim 'Isa also accuses 
al-Azhar of supporting terrorism with its statement. The writer 
begins: "What did al-Azhar leave to the extremists? Once you 
differ with the extremists and oppose them you immediately, in a 
blink of an eye, become hostile to Islam, an apostate, an 
atheist, an infidel, or a rebel against religion; and this is 
true if you are against anything that leads, for example, to the 
shedding of your blood, and to them killing you physically and 
morally!" The writer wonders: "If al- Azhar's 11 April 
statement was not terrorism, what then is terrorism?" 
  The writer says that it was the people, not God, that 
established al-Azhar and legislated the laws that gave it its 
important role. Al-Azhar, therefore, is not above criticism. 
"There are no religious institutions in Islam and there is 
nothing like a `grand imam.' We, the people, invented the title 
and put it in our civil law. And we can remove it whenever we 
want; it is not inspired or imposed by God." 
  'Isa then challenges al-Azhar to issue a statement 
explaining 
what it has done to fight extremism, which has continued to grow 
over the past 25 years. He notes that al-Azhar has never 
mentioned extremist material such as 'Umar 'Abd-al-Rahman's 
books or the audio cassettes containing destructive religious 
ideas and preaching. Insinuating that al-Azhar has suspicious 
links with Saudi Arabia and its religious establishment, the 
writer also wants al-Azhar to issue a statement "explaining in 
detail its position on the Wahhabi thought" [a fundamentalist 
sect dominant in Saudi Arabia] and another "on the Arab oil 
projects that have been established in al- Azhar over the past 
few years, though I hope sincerely that such projects do not

  [Text] Cairo, April 23 (AFP) -- Three people were injured 
Saturday when a bomb exploded in an empty house in northern 
Cairo believed to be used as an arms store by Islamic militants, 
security officials said. 
  The blast, in the densely-populated al-Matariyah district, 
injured three passers-by. 
  Police were questioning an Islamic militant in connection 
with the incident. 
  Two Islamic militants were injured Thursday when five 
explosive devices they were planning to use in attacks 
accidentally blew up in a shop in the 'Ayn Shams district of 
Cairo. 
  The blast badly damaged the front of the shop, which was 
owned by one of the injured, a chemist. His cousin was also 
hurt. 
  The outlawed Islamic group al-Jama'ah al-Islamiyah has been 
waging a violent two-year campaign to topple Egypt's secular 
government in which more than 360 people have died.

  [Text] Cairo, April 25 (AFP) -- Police on Monday shot dead 
an Islamic militant leader and nine other fundamentalists during 
raids in Cairo and southern Egypt, an interior ministry 
spokesman said. 
  Tal'at Yasin Hammam, the head of the al-Jama'ah 
al-Islamiyah's armed wing, and five other militants were killed 
in a dawn clash with police at Hammam's apartment in northeast 
Cairo, the spokesman told AFP. 
  A military court in December 1992 sentenced Hammam, who has 
been wanted since 1989, and six others to death in their absence 
for belonging to a terrorist group bent on overthrowing Egypt's 
secular government. 
  All seven were reported to be veterans of the war in 
Afghanistan. 
  The raid came two weeks after the police chief heading the 
battle against the militants, General Ra'uf Khayrat, was 
murdered in Cairo. Al-Jama'ah al-Islamiyah said it carried out 
the attack. 
  In Asyut police killed four militants suspected of 
involvement in last Wednesday's killing of the head of security 
forces in the southern city, which is a militant stronghold. 
They were all students at Asyut University.

<F P=106> [Report by Jamal 'Abd-al-Rahim] </F>
  [Excerpt] The interrogation of members of the al-Jihad 
Organization's military wing has disclosed that they recently 
returned to Egypt from abroad, where they received training in 
all types of weapons, the preparation and manufacture of bombs 
and explosives, and how to use them to carry out terrorist 
operations against important public figures and senior security 
officials. 
  The investigations also revealed that 'Adil 'Awad Siyam, the 
terrorist who was killed in a fight with policemen on al-Bahr 
al- A'zam street in al-Munib on 4 April, had been assigned by 
fugitive terrorist Dr. Ayman al-Zawahiri, leader of the al-Jihad 
Organization, to lead the organization's military wing and to 
act as coordinator between the terrorist leaders abroad and in 
Egypt. Dr. al-Zawahiri supplied him with the money to buy 
weapons and ammunition in order to carry out terrorist 
operations. Organization members were to have assassinated UN 
Secretary General Dr. Butrus-Ghali during his visit to Egypt, 
but failed due to a change in his route. They had also planned 
to assassinate Information Minister Safwat al-Sharif. 
  The interrogation of al-Jihad's military wing members also 
indicated that terrorist Siyam had planned the aborted attempt 
on the life of Interior Minister Hasan al-Alfi. For that 
operation, he rented a house for terrorists Diya'-al-Din Mahmud 
Hafiz, Nazih Subhi Rashid, Ahmad Faruq, and Muhammad Rashad 
'Abd-al-Hamid in the Kafr al-Manfa area in al-Haram. He then 
persuaded terrorist Diya'-al-Din Hafiz to carry out the suicide 
mission, while he personally watched the interior minister's 
motorcade. 
  Members of the organization, including terrorist Muhammad 
'Abd- al-'Alim Khalifah, brother-in-law of terrorist 'Adil 
'Awad, admitted to killing witness Sayyid Ahmad Abu-Yahya and 
three others at his car showroom in Shibin al-Qanatir on 4 
February. He was murdered for reporting to the police on their 
terrorist colleague Sayyid Salah. Salah was sentenced to death 
in connection with the assassination attempt of Prime Minister 
Dr.'Atif Sidqi. They also admitted to placing an explosive 
device at al-Jazirah Youth Center in 1993 so it would detonate 
during a training course of State Security Intelligence 
officers, and to killing their dissident colleague 'Adil Anwar 
in Saray al-Qubbah area. 
  The investigations revealed that terrorist Siyam had been 
using seven stolen cars to move around in and to pass 
instructions to organization members. A report by the criminal 
laboratory identified the weapons found in possession of the 
terrorists as those used in the Shibin al-Qanatir terrorist 
operation, in which Sayyid Abu-Yahya and three others were 
killed and a police officer, who chanced to be in the showroom, 
was injured. The investigations showed that terrorist 'Adil 
Siyam had received funds from abroad, for a receipt from a 
foreign currency transfer in Italy was found. The organization 
members used to disguise themselves in police, armed forces, and 
municipality workers' uniforms to place the explosive devices in 
strategic areas. The investigations revealed that terrorist 
'Adil Siyam and his brother-in-law Muhammad Khalifah had trained 
the terrorists how to prepare explosives. The organization 
members led prosecutors to nine dens in al-Basatin, al- Munib, 
al-Qalubiyah, where weapons and ammunition had been stored, as 
well as an underground tunnel which led to Bilbays [in al- 
Sharqiyah Governorate]. [passage omitted]

<F P=106> [Report by Ahmad Musa] </F>
  [Text] A senior security source at the Interior Minister 
has disclosed stunning details about terrorist plans to attack 
public figures and former and current security officials with 
the use of modern techniques obtained from abroad. 
  According to the source, 'Adil Siyam, slain leader of the 
al-Jihad terrorist group, personally supervised the initiation 
of the group's new members. The latter, the source revealed, 
underwent a 30-day period of brainwashing, during which each new 
member was locked in a room and could not leave it until the 
initiation process was over. The initiation was geared toward 
bolstering the members' ability to sustain psychological and 
physical pressure. 
  Muhammad 'Abd-al-'Alim, an accomplice of the slain 
terrorist, 
told investigators that Siyam's death is a terrible blow to the 
group. Siyam was the group's mastermind and the man who held 
all the strings. The group's members obeyed his orders blindly. 
One of Siyam's instructions was that members should commit 
suicide rather than be captured by the police, 'Abd-al-'Alim 
said. 
  According to the same source, police success in cracking the 
terrorist ring came after prolonged monitoring of foreign cash 
transfers received by local terrorist leaders. The State 
Security Intelligence Service has been keeping tabs on checks 
involving considerable dollar and sterling payments to the 
terrorists. 
  A vicious plot against Egypt is being hatched abroad, the 
source said. He added that certain countries are responsible 
for the terrorist operations taking place here. We have 
conclusive evidence about this foreign involvement through the 
confessions of the defendants and the documents seized by the 
security organs. 
  Confessions by members of al-Jihad groups shed light on 
terrorist plans. The terrorists prepared cells in the Bilbays 
area in which they planned to hold any individuals they may 
abduct in order to force the government to release imprisoned 
terrorist leaders. Police have inspected the location of these 
cells in Bilbays' farmland. 
  The terrorists also confessed that they planned to rob 
[al-satw 'ala] a number of key installations, disguised in 
police uniforms that were found in their possession. 
Investigation into the case is continuing under the supervision 
of Public Attorneys Raja' al-'Arabi and 'Abd-al-Sami' 
Sharaf-al-Din.

<F P=106> [Report by Najwa 'Abd-al-'Aziz] </F>
  [Text] Security authorities and some diplomatic quarters 
are conducting extensive investigations into how the names, 
posts, and movements of some foreign diplomats were leaked to 
the extremist al- Jihad Organization members who were recently 
arrested. Interpol is also participating in these 
investigations. 
  The security authorities seized a list of the diplomats 
targeted for assassination along with the members of the 
extremist group, which was led by 'Adil 'Awad, who was killed in 
the al-Munib battle on 14 April. 
  The extremists confessed to receiving instructions from 
their 
leadership abroad to assassinate the foreign diplomats, 
especially Americans and Israelis. 
  The security authorities also discovered the underground 
"cells," which the organization's members had prepared in 
al-Qattamiyah and Bilbays to kidnap the diplomats and detain 
them there. 
  An investigation is underway on how the detainees identified 
the persons mentioned in the assassination list, which was 
seized in one of the organization's hideouts. The investigation 
authorities held face-to-face confrontations with the eight 
defendants.

  [Text] Asyut, April 20 (AFP) -- Islamic militants on 
Wednesday shot dead a police general and his bodyguard in the 
fundamentalist hotbed of Asyut, police said. 
  Three militants gunned down General Shirin 'Ali Fahmi and 
his 
police bodyguard in a hail of automatic weapons fire which also 
wounded the general's driver. 
  The dying bodyguard managed to fire back and wound one of 
the 
militants, while the other two fled. The shooting occurred as 
Fahmi was leaving his home. 
  The general's wife witnessed the shooting from a balcony, 
tearing off window shutters and throwing them in a vain attempt 
to drive off the killers. 
  Security officials said the wounded gunman, Hasan Khalifah 
'Uthman, was a key member of the outlawed fundamentalist 
organization al-Jama'ah al-Islamiyah (Islamic Group) in the 
region, a hotbed of Islamic militancy. 
  'Uthman, who was hospitalised, was wanted for a series of 
attacks, the most recent being the killing of a policeman in the 
Asyut region last week. 
  In a statement sent to AFP in Cairo, al-Jama'ah claimed 
responsibility for the latest killing and warned that "the 
liquidation of leading officials in the (interior) ministry is a 
cornerstone of our armed campaign." 
  The aim is to make the authorities "respect the rights of 
Muslims" and end their abuse of human rights in Egyptian 
prisons, the group said. 
  Fahmi, appointed police chief in Asyut for one year last 
August, was the second police general murdered this month. On 
April 9, the general leading the battle against Islamic 
militants, Ra'uf Khayrat, was shot dead in Cairo. 
  More than 130 policemen have been killed since Islamic

  [Text] A decision has been made to provide every repentant 
terrorist with a job. In fact, 25 repentant terrorists have 
been given jobs in Asyut, after it became evident that they were 
qualified and had university or high school diplomas that they 
had earned years ago. 
  Dr. Yusuf Wali, secretary general of the National Democratic 
Party, made this statement. He also added that the party 
leaders in Asyut and Asyut Governor Samih Sa'id have been 
instructed to provide jobs immediately for repentant terrorists 
in the governorates.

  [Text] Asyut, 19 Apr (MENA) -- A terrorist was killed in an 
exchange of gunfire with police forces at the Manfalut bus 
station in Asyut, Upper Egypt, this afternoon. The terrorist, 
Mukhtar Husayn Kamil, is accused of killing Police Sergeant 
Hilal 'Ali Ibrahim. The security agencies earlier learned from 
the terrorist's companions, who had recently surrendered and 
repented, that Kamil frequented the Manfalut bus station. When 
the terrorist felt that the police force were tightening the 
noose around him, he fired at the policemen. The police advised 
him to stop firing but he continued to fire indiscriminantly. 
The policemen were forced to return the fire, killing him 
instantly. He had in his possession a pistol stolen from a 
policeman. He hailed from al-Qusiyah and used Manfalut as a 
base for his terrorist acts. He hid in Manfalut after 
assassinating Hilal 'Ali Ibrahim last year. The Manfalut 
Prosecution Office has been notified to begin investigations 
under the supervision of Counsellor Muhammad Mursi Muhammad 
'Ali, public attorney in the prosecution office of north Asyut.

<F P=106> [Report by Sawsan al-Jayyar, Ibrahim Khalil, 'Abdallah </F>
Kamal, Karim Subhi, and Khalid Dawud] 
  [Excerpts] [Passage omitted] The State Security has dealt a 
strong blow to the terrorists' plans for 1994. Behind the 
success was a major general who learned those plans and tactics 
by heart and knew how to deal with those who tried to implement 
them. As a punishment for his competence, he was assassinated 
five days after the killing of 'Adil 'Awad. 
  Only a few people knew that Major General Ra'uf Khayrat was 
the unknown man behind many of the State Security strikes. 
[passage omitted] 
  The biggest beneficiary [from Khayrat's killing] are the 
Muslim Brotherhood members, who described the assassination as 
the most holy operation since the assassination of President 
al-Sadat. We will not be surprised by this if we know that 
Major General Khayrat was among the keenest watchers of the 
Muslim Brotherhood activities. He considered the group, lying 
dormant until the right moment comes, to be responsible for much 
of what is happening in Egypt. Khayrat, a former aid of Major 
General Fu'ad 'Allam, is of the latter's school, which does not 
distinguish between a moderate extremist and a non-moderate 
extremist. He believed the Muslim Brotherhood is still very 
active, with its secret branches and its members ready for the 
moment when weapons can be brought out, especially since the 
organization has open channels to the outside world. 
  That only a few people knew this fact explains why the 
Muslim 
Brotherhood members were happy at the murder of Ra'uf Khayrat, 
who never took his eyes off them. 
  A few days after the incident, the extremist Islamic Group 
began talking once again about mediation, but this time with the 
support of the Muslim Brotherhood, and under a program that 
included several points: 
  -- Granting the Muslim Brotherhood and the extremist groups 
the right to go public. 
  -- Stopping military trials and arranging retrials of cases 
in which death sentences were passed. 
  -- Releasing all detainees. 
  -- Revoking the order to arrest 'Umar 'Abd-al-Rahman. 
  -- Stopping security pursuits against Islamic Group members. 
  This time, the mediation proposal was carried by lawyer 
Muntasir al-Zayyat, and it is said that Mukhtar Nuh, his Muslim 
Brotherhood "counterpart" lawyer, will join him, along with 
'Isam al-'Aryan, Fahmi Huwaydi, and leftist lawyer Nabil 
al-Hilali. 
  But lawyer Muntasir al-Zayyat denied any knowledge of this. 
He said: "Any media coverage of the mediation will spoil it. 
There should be no talk about any efforts until results are 
attained." He explained his proposals at the lawyers congress 
as a "personal view of how to get out of the dark tunnel." In 
return, the interior minister, at his press conference, denied 
any secret contacts and said: "We will not negotiate with 
killers and criminals." 
  When a source from the extremist groups was told that a 
desire for mediation reflects weakness, the source replied: 
"Even if this is true, we must realize that this is only a 
phase, after which the brothers will continue their activity. 
If the request for mediation is understood as a truce, then so 
be it." 
  So, it is indeed an attempt to reach a truce, and it is also 
an attempt to recoup from the blow to the major plan worked out 
by 'Adil 'Awad's organization, especially since the killing of 
Ra'uf Khayrat failed to cause the needed confusion.

  [Text] Tehran, April 24, (IRNA) -- National security 
director general at the Information Ministry, Musavi-Nejad said 
in an interview here today that the terrorist who shot and 
wounded the Mashhad Friday prayer leader had links with the 
"Munafiqeen (Hypcrites) Khalq Outfit" (MKO). 
  He identified the attacker as Ali Houri nick-named "Popi" 
from the Haft Tappeh region of Khuzestan in southwest Iran. 
  Houri after his failed assassination bid against 
Hojatoleslam 
Mohammad Abaei-Khorasani just after the latter had finished his 
Friday prayer sermons, tried to shoot himself to escape the fury 
of the worshippers. 
  Musavi-Nejad said the attacker who underwent surgery at Imam 
Redha (AS) hospital had shot himself with the idea of committing 
suicide. 
  Hoj. Abaei-Khorasani who was struck by two bullets on the 
back of his shoulder, is recovering at Qaem hospital where he 
was operated upon after the attack. A third bullet fired by the 
attacker missed the prayer leader and injured a theology student. 
  The Information Ministry official asked to comment on the 
motives of the attack, said the MKO because of its nature will 
not abandon its terrorism. Moreover, he said, it has reached a 
deadlock in Iraq. 
  Musavi-Nejad recalled that at the outbreak of the Iraqi war 
(1980-88), the MKO shouted slogans against Saddam Husayn but 
soon, however, it became attached to Saddam Husayn. 
  He said that during the past two years the MKO had conducted 
blasts along the Iran-Iraq border in the name of the masses. He 
said the MKO selected young persons in the country with promises 
and encouraged them to carry out terrorist operations. 
  Musavi said those that cooperate with MKO will be considered 
as being against the security of the country and will be 
prosecuted. 
  Regarding the reason why the MKO is looking for people 
inside 
the country for terrorist operations he said there were many 
reasons. 
  "One of those reasons is, the MKO wants to propagate that it 
has cells inside the country, whereas it is not so. The second 
reason is, the people deceived by the MKO are without previous 
records and if they did anything the MKO can deny their 
terrorist acts," he said. 
  The third reason is that the group has been under pressure 
since its flight from the country and considers this a way for 
its presence. 
  The fourth reason, added Musavi-Nejad, such people are 
considered to be forces at no cost, and the MKO without 
incurring any expenditure exploits them. 
  He said the grouplet is not even willing to pay for the 
costs 
of exit from Iran of its people and they steal the jewelery of 
their mothers or borrow from friends to go abroad. 
  These measures of the MKO, he said, are exactly the 
expectation of Iraq which has always planned subversive 
operations in the Islamic Republic. 
  About the writer of the past regime, Saeedi Sirjani, and his 
fate, the Information Ministry official said, Sirjani was 
arrested along with an accomplice named Mohammad Sadeq Saeed, 
with the nickname Niaz Kermani, for involvement in a drug ring 
and for acts against public decency, and both of them have 
confessed of their acts. 
  The two principel accused persons, he said, have been 
interrogated by the ministers of information for cooperation 
with Savak and for involvement in it. 
  He said both Saeedi and Niaz Kermani had connections with 
Savak, the Shah's notorious secret service, after the triumph of 
the Islamic revolution 
  Musavi-Nejae said the two have already confessed to such 
charges as drug trafficking, making and possessing alcoholic 
beverages, sodomy, conncections with a group of savak-related 
army officers that were involved with the Nowzheh State coup, 
and receipt of [word indistinct] amount of foreign exchanges 
from anti- revolutionary elements in the United States and 
Europe. 
  He said investigations are under way in that connection.

  [Text] Security forces are carrying out an intensive 
investigation following the discovery near Jerusalem of the body 
of a soldier. He was identified as Shahar Simani, age 20, of 
Ashqelon. The funeral will take place in Ashqelon this 
afternoon. Details from Tzvi Pantanowitz. 
  [Begin recording] Shahar Simani's body was found in a wadi 
near the Arab village of Bayt Hanina, on the northern edges of 
Jerusalem. He had been stabbed several times in the back. A 
local resident found the body and summoned the police around 2 
o'clock yesterday afternoon. Police and its special criminal 
investigation unit have been working around the clock to try to 
establish what happened. They say that the soldier was killed 
some 20 hours before the body was found and that he obviously 
struggled fiercely with his captors before he was murdered. 
  The alarm was given by Simani's girlfriend, a resident of 
Moshav Massu'ot Yitzhaq near Ashqelon, yesterday morning. She 
said that Simani had telephoned at about 8 PM on Wednesday to 
say he was on his way to her from Beersheba after leaving his 
base in the south, where he was training to be an officer. It 
is thought that he took a bus to the Qastina junction from where 
he may have hitchhiked to Massu'ot Yitzhaq, about 10 km away. 
  Security authorities think he was picked up by hostile 
elements. They are puzzled by the fact that the body was dumped 
so far away and are considering the possibility he was kidnapped 
in a car with Israeli license plates. Security forces have 
noted also that although his personal weapon disappeared, his 
identity tag and Army identity card were not taken -- moves 
common to the actions of Hamas [Islamic Resistance Movement]. 
In addition, no terror group has so far claimed responsibility. 
The authorities are seeking witnesses who may have seen Simani 
getting into a car on Wednesday night. 
  Prime Minister Rabin last night said that the soldier had 
been murdered by the enemies of peace, who were continuing to 
strike at Israelis in an attempt to strengthen those in Israel 
who were deluding themselves that halting the peace talks would 
stop the killing. Continued rule over another people would only 
increase terror, Rabin said. With all the pain involved, Israel 
would continue to fight extremist terrorism and to negotiate for 
peace. 
  After his murder, Shahar Simani, who was completing an 
officer's course, was promoted posthumously to the rank of 
second lieutenant. [end recording]

<F P=106> [Report by Nasir Shararah] </F>
  [Excerpt] According to well-informed political sources, 
Samir Ja'ja' [commander of the defunct Lebanese Forces] will be 
served with an arrest warrant within two weeks. 
  Legally an arrest warrant is no proof of guilt. But in this 
particular case such a warrant will indicate that the judiciary 
is virtually convinced of Ja'ja''s involvement in the bombing of 
Sayyidat al-Najat Church. 
  The fact that no warrant has been served on Ja'Ja' yet, the 
sources say, does not mean that his name did not come up during 
the investigations or that there are no grounds for indicting 
him. 
  The reason that no such warrant has been issued, the sources 
add, is because of the technical and security peculiarities of 
the case, as well as certain political and psychological 
considerations. 
  While mere suspicion would normally suffice for serving 
arrest warrants, both the judiciary and the Lebanese state are 
hesitant to issue such a warrant in this case without backing it 
with conclusive evidence, according to the same sources.

<F P=106> [Statement issued by Appeal Attorney General Judge Munif </F>
'Uwaydat on 20 April -- read by announcer] 
  [Text] Appeal Attorney General Judge Munif 'Uwaydat went to 
the Defense Ministry this afternoon where the investigating 
judge, Joseph Furayhah, is investigating the crime of the 
blowing up of the Sayyidat al-Najat Church in Zuq Mikha'il. 
After studying the file, it became evident that the 
investigation into the church bombing has solved the following 
crimes: 
  1. The crime of the assassination of Engineer Dany Sham'un 
[leader of the National Liberals Party] and his family in B'abda 
on 21 October 1990. 
  2. The crime of blowing up the car of Minister Elie Hubayqah 
and the killing of his companion in al-Ashrafiyah in 1991. 
  3. The crime of the assassination of Dr. Ilyas al-Zayik in 
al-Ashrafiyah in 1989. 
  This is in addition to other crimes, which, together with 
the 
church bombing, remain under investigation. 
  The case of the assassination of Dany Sham'un and his family 
was immediately referred to the judicial investigator, Judge 
Munir Hunayn, together with the Appeal Prosecution Office's 
charge of attacks on the state's internal security, which 
resulted in the death of Engineer Sham'un, his wife, and two 
children. Orders for the arrest of the following were issued: 
  Hanna al-'Atiq, Robert Abu-Sa'b, Kamil Karam, Milhim Haddad, 
Marun Ghanim, Tony Musa, Walid Ja'ja', Rafiq Sa'adah, Fadi Sa'b, 
Simon Khiryati, Khalil Wakim, and Ilya Irz, who have been 
referred by Judge Furayhah. All of them belong to the Lebanese 
Forces' intelligence service. 
  The judge also ruled that orders for the arrest in absentia 
of those who were proven to be involved by the investigation 
carried out by Judge Furayhah be issued. They are: Ghassan 
Tuma, Tony 'Ubayd, 'Atif al-Habr, Jean Shahin, Jean Samiyah, 
Farid Sa'adah, Elie 'Awwad alias Juliano, Tony Sim'an, Naja 
al-Qaddum, George al- Fighali, Ilya 'Aqiqi, and Francis 'Aqiqi. 
All of the above belong to the Lebanese Forces' intelligence 
service. 
  Judge 'Uwaydat also issued charges against anyone shown by 
the investigations to be an active player, instigator, or 
participant in these crimes. He also asked that arrest warrants 
be issued for each one of the above wanted by the investigation 
as well as written subpoenas.

  [Text] Beirut, 23 Apr (MENA) -- Lebanese judicial sources 
today stated that during the preliminary interrogation 
yesterday, Iraqi diplomat Deputy Consul 'Ali Sultan Darwish and 
chief of embassy guards Hadi Hasan confessed fully to the 
assassination of Iraqi opposition member Talib Suhayl al-Tamimi 
in his home in Beirut. 
  The sources said that during the 12-hour interrogation 
yesterday, Hadi Hasan gave a full confession on how the crime 
was planned in coordination with Muhammad Faris Kadhim, chief of 
intelligence at the Iraqi embassy, and defendants Khalid Khalaf, 
'Ali Sultan Darwish, and George Tarjian. 
  According to Hasan, Kadhim had asked him to assassinate 
al-Tamimi at the orders of the Iraqi intelligence in Baghdad, 
after furnishing him with the crime weapon. 
  The sources note that defendant 'Ali Sultan Darwish 
confessed 
to planning and preparing to carry out the crime with his 
colleagues and to hiding weapons, particularly the murder weapon. 
  Darwish said that the Iraqi intelligence in Baghdad had 
issued orders to assassinate al-Tamimi at once as an opponent of 
Saddam Husayn's regime. He confessed to committing the crime 
with his colleagues. 
  The investigating judge has ordered the extension of the 
defendants' remand in solitary confinement, and prevented 
visitors. The number of persons implicated in the case has thus 
risen to five, including three diplomats.

<F P=106> ["By a JORDAN TIMES staff reporter with agency dispatches"] </F>
  [Text] Amman -- Three Iraq diplomats have returned home 
from Beirut after Lebanon broke diplomatic links with their 
country over an assassination of an Iraqi dissident in the 
Lebanese capital. 
  The three, including Charge d'Affaires 'Awad Fakhri, flew to 
Amman aboard a royal Jordanian (RJ) flight Thursday morning. 
Two of their colleagues were arrested by Lebanese police as 
they got out of their diplomatic-plate cars at Beirut airport to 
board the flight. 
  The arrest of the two raised to four the number of Iraqi 
diplomats held in Beirut over the April 12 killing of Shaykh 
Talib 'Ali al-Suhayl, who was reported to have been a key figure 
in a foiled plot against Iraqi President Saddam Husayn last year. 
  Mr. Fakhri had demanded that the Lebanese government, which 
broke diplomatic ties with Iraq after Baghdad refused to lift 
the diplomatic immunity for the two attaches, Muhammad Kazim and 
Khalid Khalaf release the two diplomats. He also refused to 
hand over another attache, 'Ali Darwish, and guard Hadi Hassan, 
the suspected assassin, who were held up in the Iraqi embassy in 
Beirut since the day of assassination. 
  A Lebanese-Armenian employee of the embassy, George 
Teredjian, who allegedly drove the assassination team to 
al-Suhayl's apartment in Beirut, has also been detained and 
charged with complicity. 
  It was not immediately clear how the embassy stand-off 
ended, 
given the tough statements that Mr. Fakhri had been issuing 
demanding the release of Mr. Kazim and Mr. Khalaf. 
  But analysts speculated that the Iraqis realised that they 
could be in for a long siege by Lebanese police or be exposed to 
a possible storming of the embassy after Friday, the date set by 
the Beirut government for them to leave the country and thus the 
effective end to diplomatic immunity for the building. 
  They also noted that the Lebanese government had instructed 
its lone diplomat in Baghdad, Sa'd Zakhya, to leave Iraq 
immediately after the arrest of the two Iraqi diplomats in 
Beirut. 
  Mr. Zakhya left Baghdad in the early hours of April 13, 
shortly after the Beirut arrests, and flew out of Amman for the 
Lebanese capital on April 14. 
  Mr. Darwish and Mr. Hassan were arrested as they arrived at 
Beirut airport to board the flight to Amman on Thursday along 
with Charge d'Affaires Fakhri and two other diplomats, whose 
names were not immediately available. But one of them was 
believed to be the Beirut correspondent of the Iraqi News Agency 
(INA). 
  Mr. Fakhri and the other two were allowed to board the 
flight. The Associated Press reported that they were carrying 15 
pieces of baggage weighing 350 kilogrammes, including boxes of 
files and electronic appliances. 
  Journalists covering their arrival at Amman airport reported 
tight Iraqi security that prevented from talking to any of the 
three, who were met by the Iraqi ambassador in Jordan, Nuri al- 
Wayyis al-Tikriti and other Iraqi diplomats. 
  A small scuffle broke out as some Iraqi security men sought 
to seize television films of the arrival of the diplomats from 
Lebanon, news agencies reported. The row was settled with 
intervention by Jordanian security forces, who upheld the right 
of the media to cover the event, the reports said. 
  The three who arrived from Beirut were directly driven from 
Amman airport on the 1,000-kilometre trip to Baghdad, the 
Associated Press quoted Iraqi embassy spokesman 'Adil Ibrahim as 
saying. 
  There was no immediate report from Baghdad of the diplomats' 
arrival there. 
  The Iraqi government has denied Lebanese Prosecutor General 
Munir 'Uwaydat that its intelligence apparatus had ordered the 
killing of al-Suhayl, who held Jordanian and Saudi passports and 
was a known opponent of the Ba'thist regime in Baghdad. 
  According to reports in the Lebanese press quoting 
"confessions" by the two attaches arrested immediately after the 
killing, the order for the assassination had come from Baghdad 
over the telex. The operation was allegedly masterminded by Mr. 
Darwish. 
  Charge d'Affaires Fakhri was called in by prosecutors to 
hear 
the confession of the two, the reports said. 
  An Iraqi Foreign Minister spokesman has accused Lebanon of 
violating the 1961 international convention and regulates 
diplomatic immunity. 
  "It has detained diplomats who possess diplomatic 
immunity... 
charging them with baseless accusation," the spokesman said in a 
statement issued on Wednesday.

  [Text] Beirut, 23 Apr (MENA)-- Investigations by Lebanese 
judicial and security authorities with 16 members of the 
Abu-Nidal- led Fatah Movement--the Revolutionary Council [FRC] 
arrested a few days ago have revealed that eight of them were 
involved in the assassination a few months ago of Jordanian 
diplomat Na'ib al- Ma'aytah. The number of persons arrested in 
connection with the crime has thus risen to 11, after charges 
were pressed against three others. 
  The Lebanese Army troops on Thursday stormed one of the 
Abu-Nidal group's barracks in al-Rawdah, Western al-Biqa', and 
seized a large amount of weapons, ammunition, vehicles, and 
missiles estimated at 25 truck loads. The army arrested 16 FRC 
members.

  [Excerpt] Lahore, April 22 -- At least 35 Namazis 
including five children, were injured when two grenades exploded 
in the hall of a double storey mosque in Jiya Musa, one km from 
Shahdara here on Friday. 
  Eye-witnesses told The Muslim that the Namazis were offering 
dua [prayers] after performing Asr prayers at 5:20 pm in Jamia 
Masjid Mohammadia when two hand grenades exploded in the mosque 
hall. According to eye-witnesses three youths, who were riding a

different doors and disappeared.

were given medical treatment. Seven of the injured were 
discharged after necessary medical aid while the remaining were 
still in the hospital. Their condition was stated to be out of

about Sudan's violation of human rights and support for 
terrorism. The president made this denial yesterday in an

command of the people's armed forces. During the interview Lt. 
Gen. al-Bashir also talked about political, economic and social 
developments in Sudan, as well as Russian-Sudanese relations.

minister of state at the Foreign Ministry, Archbishop Gabriel 
Rodge, during which he explained that his participation in 
government is for the sake of the country's unity and 
advancement. He said that there is no religious problem in 
Sudan as portrayed by the Western mass media. He explained that

southern problem. He said that Sudan enjoys a normal life in 
which peaceful coexistence prevails. Regarding conditions in 
the south of the country, the minister of state at the Foreign

  [Text] Hamburg (DPA) -- Lebanese terrorist Ali 'Abbas 
Hamadi, who was deported from Germany last year, is reportedly 
back in the FRG. This was learned from security circles on 
Thursday morning [21 April]. According to information that has 
not been officially confirmed he plans to free his brother 
Muhamad Ali Hamadi, who is serving a life term in the Hesse 
prison of Schwalmstadt for hijacking a plane and killing a U.S. 
soldier. The Federal Office of Criminal Investigations in 
Wiesbaden has not been able to confirm these reports so far. 
  It was also said that this information comes from French 
intelligence service circles. 'Abbas Hamadi is reportedly 
planning an operation to force his brother's release. 
Allegedly, he is in the area of Saarbruecken at the moment. 
  'Abbas Hamadi, who was sentenced to 13 years in prison in 
1988 for taking hostages and illegal possession of explosives, 
was released from prison last year after having served about 
half of his sentence and was deported from Germany.

<F P=106> [Joerg Bischof article: "Like a Fish in Water"] </F>
  [Text] In mid-February this year it happened again: Five 
noncommissioned officer cadets died and 26 soldiers of the 
Turkish Army were injured, some of them seriously, when a bomb 
exploded at the railroad station of the Istanbul suburb of 
Tuzla. It was hidden in a trash can and the timer was set for 
0910 local time . This was precisely that time when every 
Saturday hundreds of soldiers wait on the platform to go away 
for the weekend. 
  The left-wing extremist "Partya Karkeren Kurdistan" [Workers 
Party of Kurdistan] (PKK) claimed responsibility for the attack, 
which tore off the arms and legs of many victims. And it did 
not shy away from having its KURD-A information service, which 
operates from Germany, announce to Turkish newspapers and news 
magazines by telefax that a "revenge team" of the PKK's military 
arm will carry out further attacks on Turkish towns and vacation 
resorts on the Turkish Adriatic. This showed the security 
authorities that the PKK organization is still intact, even 
though it has meanwhile been banned in Germany, too. 
  In Turkey the PKK has been on the list of banned extremist 
organizations for years. On 26 November last year, after a 
difficult decisionmaking process, FRG Interior Minister Manfred 
Kanther came round to formally classifying the PKK in Germany as 
a terrorist group and banning it and 35 cover organizations, 
including Kurdish "cultural and friendship association," a PKK 
publishing company, and the KURD-A press agency, which is still 
active despite the ban. The security authorities expect the 
other cover organizations, at best, to scale down their public 
activities. Underground, however, the PKK will probably continue 
to be active. Its assets had probably already been removed when 
the police enforced the ban in a raid on 26 November. 
<H5>  Hardly to Be Determined </H5>
  The decision was probably not easy for Kanther, because the 
PKK organization in Germany can hardly be determined exactly by 
security authorities. Even though last year several acts of 
violence against Turkish consulates, banks, and airlines in 
Mainz, Darmstadt, Hanover, and Munich, which were planned to the 
minute, showed that the PKK, which was founded in 1978 and is 
controlled by General Secretary Abdullah Ocalan from Syria, is 
able to "mobilize" its estimated 5,000 activists in Germany 
practically any time. It showed that most recently on 4 
November 1993 with a well planned series of attacks, which 
affected not only Germany but also other countries in Europe. 
Nevertheless, the security authorities have so far been 
restrained regarding countermeasures, because the PKK is 
swimming "like a fish in the water," as Mao Zedong's famous 
saying goes, of the total of 15 Kurdish liberation movements and 
skillfully exploits for its own purposes the sympathetic 
feelings of the German people for Kurdistan's freedom struggle. 
  When Kanther finally used the club of an official ban 
against 
the PKK, it was probably not so much for reasons of security 
policy as foreign policy. For years Ankara had been urging the 
government in Bonn to dry up the PKK's field of action in 
Germany and to officially stress the difference between the 
terrorist organization and the legal liberation movements in 
Kurdistan. It was Foreign Minister Klaus Kinkel, who was the 
essential influence in the cabinet. He primarily wants to 
cultivate good relations with Ankara, because Turkey plays an 
important role for Bonn, as Germany's traditional friend, as a 
"bridge" to the Turkish peoples in the south of the former 
Soviet Union, and as the only Islamic power in NATO. 
<H5>  For Socialism </H5>
  German security authorities classify the PKK as a 
Marxist-Leninist organization, which uses its military arm, the 
"People's Liberation Army of Kurdistan" (ARGK), formerly 
"Liberation Unit of Kurdistan" (HRK), to bring about a socialist 
Kurdistan and thus the separation from Turkey, Syria, Iran, and 
Iraq. Other, moderate Kurdish groups, which mainly come from 
the Kurdish areas of Iran and Iraq, on the other hand, content 
themselves with the demand for more autonomy of their 
compatriots within these states. In Germany the PKK operated 
several subgroups until it was banned, e.g. the propaganda 
organization "National Liberation Front of Kurdistan" (ERNK) or 
the cultural organization "Association of Patriotic Artists of 
Kurdistan" (HUNERKOM), which can hardly be distinguished from 
the moderate Kurdish "cultural associations." 
  Constitutional Protection classifies it as the "for years 
most active and most militant association" among the 15 leftist 
Kurdish groups in Germany. In particular it pursues a tough 
struggle, also on German soil, against its rivals from the 
moderate wing of the Kurdish freedom movement, such as 
"Devrimici Isci." In 1990 police found the corpse of former PKK 
member Abdulla Hosgoren in a plastic bag. He had been executed 
as a "traitor" six years before because he reportedly worked for 
"Devrimici Isci" and prevented revenge murders. Previously, PKK 
General Secretary Abdullah Ocalan had made it known via the 
"Kurdistan Report" how the PKK deals with defectors: "We will 
put them on the operating table and save what can be saved; 
those who do not survive this procedure will be left to 
liquidation." 
  The PKK is extremely skillful with its strategy. Protest 
actions intended to draw the German people's attention to the 
Kurdish problem, have generally been peaceful. Women and 
children were used. In contrast, the terrorist organization has 
not shied away from open violence when it acted against Turkish 
authorities and institutions in Germany. 
<H5>  Strong Influx </H5>
  One of the reasons for the ban was the strong influx of 
followers the PKK had experienced in Germany over the past 
years. Up to 25,000 Kurds participated in an "International 
Kurdistan Festival" of the PKK cultural organization in Bochum 
in 1992. A little later, 12,000 persons marched "against 
treason" in Frankfurt/Main. When, at the end of 1992, it 
advertised elections for a "Kurdish National Parliament in 
Europe" the PKK was warned because of activities that are 
impermissible under the Aliens' Law. Increasingly frequently 
cases have come to light in which PKK activists extorted money 
for the liberation struggle from Kurds in Germany.

  [Text] Athens (DPA) -- During the night [22 April] a bomb 
attack was carried out on the branch office of the German Miele 
AG in Halandri, a suburb of Athens. The Greek police say that 
no one was injured. According to investigations so far, a bomb, 
which had been put under a company van, was detonated by remote 
control. When the car, which was parked on the company 
premises, exploded, the factory building of the German company 
was damaged. So far, none of the underground organizations has 
claimed responsibility for the attack. Material damage is 
considerable, it was said. 
  At the beginning of the week various terrorist underground 
movements had carried out attacks on three French and one 
Swedish diplomat in the Greek capital.

  [Text) Unidentified persons stole 7,000 detonators from 
the 28th Ammunition Warehouse, which is on Kos island. 
According to a statement issued by the Army General Staff 
[YES], the warehouse guard noticed last Thursday night that the 
door had been forced open. Following investigations it was 
established that 7,000 detonators were missing. The chief of 
YES instructed the ASDEN [Higher Military Command for the 
Interior and Islands] commander to visit the island. An 
extensive search is already in progress. 
  [Paris AFP in English at 1142 GMT on 24 April carries a 
related Athens-datelined report that adds that "investigators 
have not ruled out the possibility of a `terrorist' link, police 
said." 
  The AFP report continues: "Defense Mnister Yerasimos 
Arsenis, 
confirming local police reports of the theft Frriday night, said 
Sunday authorities were examining all hypotheses. 
  "Up to now he believed the thieves were `people who use 
dynamite for fishing,' or who wanted the detonators to make 
firecrackers for use during the Greek Orthodox Easter 
celebrations on May 1. 
  "However Greek police said they had not ruled out the 
possibility the detonators may have been stolen by people 
`planning a terrorist attack,' but added that this theory was 
`not favoured for the moment.'"]

<F P=106> ["Exclusive interview" with "three muffled members" of the </F>
Basque Fatherland and Liberty -- ETA -- by Walter Tauber and 
Pedro Barbadillo; place and date not given: "The Famous Bomb"] 
  [Text] DIE WOCHE: With "Operation Man-Eater," 
the attempt on Franco's Prime Minister Carrero Blanco's life, 
the Basque Fatherland and Liberty [ETA] made the headlines of 
the world press in 1973. How does the ETA leadership assess 
this action today? 
  ETA: Carrero Blanco guaranteed the continuation 
of the Franco regime. By our action, those who supported a 
shift toward democracy gained the upper hand. It may sound 
strange, but thanks to this action there is today this 
pseudodemocracy in Spain. Felipe Gonzalez should be aware that 
he is able to be minister president today also for this reason. 
  DIE WOCHE: Spain changed from a fascist 
dictatorship to a democracy. Do you still think that armed 
struggle is the right way to achieve your objectives? 
  ETA: The Spanish state is oppressing our people: 
This is the core of the conflict. The Franco dictatorship was 
not our only problem, but also the successors appointed by him. 
This is not often discussed and it may sound strange to you, 
but today's monarchy, this alleged "Spanish democracy," was 
established by Franco. We have today the same reasons to 
continue our struggle as we did 20 years ago. 
  DIE WOCHE: Within ETA there have always been 
supporters of an end to the violence, for example "Txomin," one 
of the participants in the "Operation Man-Eater." He later held 
negotiations with the government. 
  ETA: ETA made the attempt on Carrero's life, just 
like the recent one against Joseba Goikoetxea, chief of the 
special units of the Basque police, who had militant Basques 
tortured and killed. We also ignited the famous bomb in the 
supermarket "Hipercor" in Barcelona. We want to say by this 
that the organization ETA assumes responsibility for all 
attacks. It is a government game to attribute our actions to 
individual members, in order to oppress us. Negotiations on the 
armed struggle are not possible, the struggle is political and 
the solution also has to be political. We want independence, we 
have a right to it. Spain and France have to recognize these 
rights. The end of the armed struggle would be a consequence, 
not a precondition. 
  DIE WOCHE: Why did the talks with the Madrid 
government, for example in Algeria in 1988, fail again and again? 
  ETA: The reason is clear -- the government is not 
willing to come to an agreement. There is a significant 
example: About two years ago, the former press spokesman of the 
Interior Ministry published a book in which he clearly says that 
the Spanish Government did not want to negotiate with us. He 
claims quite brazenly that the government "almost succeeded in 
leading the organization up the garden path." Without any 
shyness, he states that the government did not plan to adhere to 
the agreements made with us by its representatives. 
  DIE WOCHE: What would ETA's conditions for 
negotiations with the government be today? 
  ETA: We have repeated until we're blue in the face 
that the first condition is seriousness. The second is the will 
to settle the conflict. The third is the guarantee that 
negotiations can lead to something. We only demand the 
following: the will. The will to take up the political 
conflict and to create conditions to solve it. 
  DIE WOCHE: Are there today any contacts or talks? 
  ETA: No, this is clear: No, there are no 
negotiations. The Spanish Government said itself that there are 
no contacts, that it has no intention of establishing such 
contacts, and that it cut short all ways to them. But the 
government also knows that there is no way out -- it has to 
negotiate some time. 
  DIE WOCHE: The assassination of Carrero was 
selectively aimed against a certain representative of the 
regime. For some years, ETA has perpetrated particularly bloody 
attacks to which civilians who are not involved fall victim, and 
that also cause increasing horror in the Basque region. What is 
the reason for this change? 
  ETA: Without bragging, we can claim that our 
struggle has been and still is absolutely selective. If it is 
not the most selective one in the world, it is one of the most 
selective struggles. In what war were so many high-ranking 
officers killed as in this one? Last year, in June alone, five 
lieutenant colonels of the General Staff were assassinated. Our 
struggle has been and still is selective against those who 
oppress our people. And we will continue to take action against 
them until the situation changes. 
  We certainly know that there were also many civilian victims 
in the past few years. We made mistakes because we did not want 
these victims. We reflected deeply on these mistakes. We have 
to ensure that there are no civilian victims because our targets 
are only those who oppress our people. 
  DIE WOCHE: What would the social order for which 
you are striving be like today, after the breakdown of the 
Soviet bloc? 
  ETA: We want a new society. But we know -- this 
is obvious -- that all models have failed so far. Thus, a new 
model has to be found. However, we are not offering a finished 
version; we want the people to participate in the development. 
This participation of the people must be the basis of the new 
model. In the struggle against oppression, we are seeking the 
road to a society without oppressors and oppressed. 
DIE WOCHE: "Argala" belonged to the commando unit 
that carried out the "Operation Man-Eater." He was killed by 
the rightist Spanish-Basque Batallion (BVE). Other leaders of 
the Basque underground fell victim to the "Antiterrorist 
Liberation Group" (GAL). Who is behind these assassins? 
  ETA: GAL and BVE were founded by the Spanish state 
-- founded, supported, and paid. But it is not the Spanish 
state alone that bears the responsibility, France is also 
involved. The GAL attacks came to an end when France started to 
deport Basques and hand them over to Spain. The whole thing was 
a joint strategy of the two states. 
  DIE WOCHE: Until recently, the possibility that 
peace might be achieved in Palestine or Northern Ireland seemed 
to be mere utopia. In view of such processes, should ETA not 
reconsider the purpose of its struggle? 
  ETA: Palestine and Northern Ireland are of great 
interest to us. However, we have to watch cautiously what is 
going on. If the starting conditions are not quite clear, such 
a development will not progress. The question of whether we can 
achieve self-determination without weapons is answered by 
reality: The Basque people said "no" to NATO in a ballot, but 
the Spanish state did not take this decision into account. The 
Basque people rejected the Spanish constitution in a referendum 
and this was not respected either.

1,976 terrorists were captured. Of these 865 terrorists were 
caught in the state of emergency region. Mentese added that 88 
terrorists surrendered to the security forces in the same period. 
  In a statement he issued today, the interior minister 
reported that a group of militants -- comprised of approximately 
4,500 persons -- was neutralized as a result of intelligence 
work and weakening within the organization. Mentese declared 
that as a result of coordinated operations conducted by the 
Turkish Armed Forces and the security forces, the terrorist 
organization sustained significant loss of logistic support and 
militants. In northern Iraq, Mentese reported, 79 terrorists 
were killed and two were captured. 
  Pointing out that nothing can be achieved through terrorism, 
Mentese reiterated his call on the youth, who are deceived by 
the PKK, to surrender as soon as possible and benefit from the 
repentance law.

  [Excerpts] Ankara, MILLIYET -- It has been reported that 
the fundamentalist illegal organization called the Islamic Great 
Eastern Raiders-Front [Islami Buyuk Dogu Akincilar-Cephesi] 
[IGER-F] was responsible for staging demonstrations in several 
big cities, especially in Ankara and Istanbul, and stoning the 
U.S. Embassy, as well as the TRT, the UN, and the True Path 
Party headquarters. An investigation has been launched with 
regard to the demonstrations. 
  Ankara Security Directorate officials stated that for the 
past month the IGER-F has been waiting for a suitable 
opportunity to promote itself and win sympathizers in all parts 
of the country. The organization decided to stage actions 
throughout the country following reports of attacks against 
Gorazde in Bosnia-Herzegovina. [passage omitted] 
<H5>  What Is IGER-F? </H5>
  The aim of this illegal organization is cited as "changing 
the existing constitutional order through the use of force, and 
replacing it with a federal state under the name of United 
Islamic State, which will incorporate all Middle Eastern 
countries." The organization, which emerged in 1990, acts under 
the slogan of armed struggle for a fundamentalist order and 
undertakes bombings and armed attacks to achieve this goal. The 
leader of the organization is Izzet Erdis, who is otherwise 
known as Salih Mirzabeyoglu. 
<H5>  Demiral's Confirmation </H5>
  Nusret Demiral, chief prosecutor of the Ankara State 
Security 
Court, has confirmed that the incidents of two days ago were 
directed by the illegal pro-fundamentalist IGER-F organization. 
Demiral said: "Our work concerning the organization is 
continuing. Our videos also clearly show that the persons who 
guided the demonstrators are militants of this organization. 
The investigation about them is being conducted in accordance 
with the first and seventh articles of the anti-terror law."

  [Text] Diyarbakir/Ankara -- Turkish commandos, supported by 
warplanes and military helicopters, have expanded their 
operation in Kurdish-controlled northern Iraq and will remain in 
the region for a major part of the summer, official sources said 
on Monday. They said approximately 5,000 troops had already 
entered Iraq where at least 60 Kurdish separatists have been 
killed over the past six days. Witnesses in Sirnak said 
hundreds of paramilitary village guards were aiding the troops 
amid an intense buildup of soldiers and land vehicles on the 
Turkish side of the border. Military officials said the 
cross-border operation targeted camps of the outlawed Kurdistan 
Workers' Party (PKK) and concentrated on the Sivi and Haftanin 
regions in northern Iraq, immediately opposite the Turkish towns 
of Cukurca and Uludere respectively. 
  The crackdown started last week with a massive land and air 
operation launched on the Gabar mountains and the Mezi border 
region which the PKK has been using as a main base. Officials 
said on Sunday that an important rebel depot was discovered on 
the Gabar mountains and troops had seized nine mortars, seven 
antiaircraft guns, three rocket launchers, 61 assault rifles, 70 
antipersonnel mines, 98 grenades and approximately 170,000 
rounds of ammunition. Over the past weeks, Turkey seized some 
400 tons of foodstuff also stockpiled by the PKK. 
  Sources in Diyarbakir said, meanwhile, that a majority of 
Kurdish civilians in the Gabar region had evacuated their homes 
and crossed the border into northern Iraq. There were 
unconfirmed claims on Monday that prior to the Turkish 
crackdown, PKK forces in Gabar had also moved out. 
  Reports coming from the clash zone on Monday said that while 
land and air operations continued in Shive and Haftanin, air 
force jets and helicopter gunships had attacked PKK hideouts in 
the mountainous region of Derkar and in Kanimasi. 
  Officials said the operation within Iraq would continue 
until 
operations in southeastern Turkey came to an end. One source, 
who asked not to be identified, pointed out that the logistic 
support lines of the PKK were being cut and the presence of 
Turkish forces in the border area, some five kilometers into 
Iraq, prevented militants from entering Turkey or escaping to 
the Kurdish-controlled area. 
  Turkey recently deployed around 100,000 fresh troops to the 
Southeast and has a total of approximately 400,000 security 
personnel including soldiers, policemen, intelligence officers 
and village guards to fight the separatists there. 
  Sources in Diyarbakir said on Monday that new military 
trucks 
were arriving in the region every day with weaponry being 
deployed to the flat areas around the Iraqi border, close to the 
southeastern province of Sirnak. 
  Meanwhile, a newspaper has said that all military forces in 
Sirnak were attached to a division under the command of Gen. 
Orhan Gencler. Sabah newspaper said on Monday that the number 
of brigades in the region had been increased to four, including 
one armored brigade. 
  Terrorism experts in the capital, Ankara, believe Turkey's 
armed campaign in the Southeast will gain momentum until August 
in the form of a pre-emptive strike against the rebels before 
they launch their own "summer offensive." 
  Turkish Chief of Staff Gen. Dogan Gures promised earlier 
that 
the PKK would be crushed by this summer at the latest and Prime 
Minister Tansu Ciller has said that Turkey has no alternative 
but to break the backbone of terrorism. 
  At least 11,000 people, including hundreds of Kurdish 
civilians, have died in the 10-year-old conflict during which 
human rights violations have escalated on both sides.

  [Text] Ankara, April 20 (TANJUG) -- The bomb which on 
Tuesday blew up the car of the first secretary of the embassy of 
the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia in Turkey outside his 
residence in the Turkish capital was planted by an Islamic 
terrorist organization called the Great Eastern Islamic 
Conquering Front (IBDA), the paper MEJDAN wrote on Wednesday. 
  It quoted Ankara's deputy security chief as saying that the 
organization had claimed responsibility for the assault in 
letters to several media houses and that the group had so far 
been unknown for similar activities. 
  After the incident, the Turkish police stepped up security 
measures around the Yugoslav Embassy. 
  Reacting to the attack, Charge d'affaires of the Yugoslav 
Embassy in Ankara Bojan Bugarcic lodged a protest note to the 
Turkish Foreign Ministry. 
  Bugarcic on Tuesday told TANJUG that the Yugoslav Embassy 
had 
repeatedly informed the Turkish authorities that security 
measures around the embassy were not sufficient and pointed out 
that it was the duty of the Turkish Government, as the host, to 
provide full protection of all diplomatic and consular offices. 
  The Yugoslav Government on Tuesday lodged u strong protest 
note to Turkey over the terrorist attack and pointed out that 
the perpetrators of the criminal act had been encouraged by the 
continuing and organized anti-Yugoslav and anti-Serbian campaign 
of the Turkish media and unacceptible statements by Turkish 
officials aimed against the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia and 
the Serbian people. 
  In the protest note, which the Yugoslav Foreign Ministry 
handed to the charge d'affaires of the Turkish Embassy in 
Belgrade, the Turkish Government is asked to discover and punish 
the perpetrators of the terrorist act, pay compensation for the 
damage to property, take all necessary steps for full protection 
of the Yugoslav diplomatic and consular offices and guarantee 
the safety of their personnel and the members of their families 
in Turkey, in keeping with the provisions of the Vienna 
convention on diplomatic relations and other international 
documents.

    [Editorial Report] Ankara Show Television in Turkish at 
1920 GMT on 18 April carries a report on rumors that the PKK 
[Workers Party of Kurdistan] is settling in Armenia because the 
Turkish security forces operations succeeded in forcing the PKK 
to pullout of northern Iraq. The footage begins with "32d Day" 
correspondent Mithat Bereket reporting from (Samiram), the 
biggest Kurdish village in Armenia approximately 30 km from the 
Turkish border. The correspondent states "at first glance there 
is no concrete evidence of PKK presence in the village." The 
correspondent concludes his report in (Samiram) by saying that 
the villagers are very sympathetic to the Kurdish cause. 
  The report continues from Yerevan where Bereket attempts to 
procure permission to visit Lachin, "a point of interest because 
it is rumored that PKK camps are being established." The 
correspondent continues by saying "the Nagorno-Karabakh 
representative (Manvel Sarkisyan) claimed there are no PKK camps 
in Lachin." Permission to visit is not granted because Bereket 
is a Turkish citizen therefore "our doubts regarding PKK camps 
in Lachin continue." 
  The report continues with the correspondent interviewing the 
Armenian Vice President Levon Zurabyan [name, title as received] 
in Yerevan who says: "It is regretful that there are claims of 
PKK camps in Armenia. It is out of question that Armenia will 
support such a thing. Our borders are under closely controlled. 
We have not given permission to any person or group to enter 
and establish camps and we are not thinking of granting such a 
permission. We are behaving with great sensitivity regarding 
this issue. Of course, we have a degree of influence on the 
people of Nagorno-Karabakh, but do not forget that they have 
their own will and our influence is not endless." 
  The report continues with Show Television's Mehmet Ali 
Birand 
calling the Turkish Interior Minister Nahit Mentese on the 
telephone and asking whether there are any intelligence reports 
on the PKK establishing itself in Lachin and making use of 
Armenian territories. Mentese answers that the PKK might be 
using those territories since "there are no places they are not 
making use of" adding that the Turkish Government is following 
the issue. 
  The report concludes with the recent security forces 
operations in northern Iraq and Mentese's details on the issue.

<F P=106> [Report by Deric Henderson, PA News] </F>
  [Text] American law enforcement agencies failed to 
intercept a consignment of detonators bound for Ulster 
terrorists because they believed the IRA was only going to use 
them for testing purposes, a television report claims tonight. 
  In fact, after sending them across the Atlantic, the 
Provisionals used the detonators in a bombing campaign in Ulster 
and England, according to the BBC Northern Ireland Spotlight 
programme. 
  The devices, made by a U.S. firm and allegedly bought by a 
Belfast man in Arizona, started turning up three years ago in an 
assortment of bombs. Others were found in unexploded bombs in 
England, Northern Ireland and the Irish Republic. 
  American agents posing as arms dealers and involved in a so- 
called "sting" operation agreed to sell a Stinger surface-to-air 
missile to the man who, it is claimed, also told them of his 
plans to buy 2,900 detonators. 
  Kevin McKinley was later arrested for his part in the 
missile 
sale, but the detonators were sent to Ireland, the report says. 
  Details emerged at a trial in Tucson where four other 
Irishmen and two Americans face charges connected to the sale. 
The case is expected to end soon. 
  According to the report, the U.S. authorities failed to keep 
a tail on McKinley after he unwittingly warned them of his plans 
to buy the detonators. Had they known they were going to be 
used for bombs, he probably would have been followed, one agent 
claimed. 
  One of the defence lawyers at the hearing claimed the law 
enforcement agencies were more interested in a successful 
"sting" involving the missile. 
  Bates Butler said: "Even though they had been told 
detonators 
were involved, they didn't care ... it could have been stopped."

<F P=106> [Press release issued by the UK Department of Transport: </F>
"Major Step Forward in Aviation Security"] 
  [Text] Directions requiring airlines to account for and 
authorise for carriage (known as triple A) of every item of hold 
baggage placed on board an aircraft on international flights 
originating in the United Kingdom have been issued today. 
  Making the announcement during a visit to Manchester 
Airport, 
Lord MacKay of Ardbrecknish, Minister for Aviation said: 
  "Triple A is a major step forward in our aviation security 
programme. The directions will come into force on 1 July this 
year and will give legal effect to a security initiative 
introduced into the National Aviation Security Programme as a 
Recommended Practice in January this year. 
  "For some time, the Government has been seeking an available 
and effective means of identifying and dealing with the `rogue 
bag' that is a bag introduced into the air transport system 
which has no connection with any passenger on a particular 
flight. Triple A is the solution to this problem. 
  "No-one should have any doubts about this government's 
commitment to aviation security. The Department of Transport's 
nine-fold increase in expenditure on and ten-fold increase in 
staff involved in aviation security over the last five years are 
figures that speak for themselves. It is this commitment which 
has propelled the advances in technology which make it possible 
for me to issue today a direction which will result in airline 
passengers travelling from the UK enjoying one of the highest 
level of security in the world. 
  "The work like that done here at Manchester on baggage 
management has helped create the advances in technology which 
enable me to make this announcement today. 
  "Last year, Manchester Airport took the initiative and 
hosted 
successful trials which proved the effectiveness of an automated 
baggage management system developed by Ferranti Electronics. I 
would like to commend the airport for its foresight in seeking 
the introduction of a system that will not only improve the 
service airlines and airports are able to offer air travellers, 
but will also have significant benefits for the security of 
civil aviation in this country. 
  "It is clear that a number of airlines are already meeting 
the requirements of the direction. For others, where large 
investment in equipment may be necessary, there will be an 
agreed and binding phasing-in period. The standard will apply 
to all international flights originating at all airports in the 
United Kingdom and will cover both accompanied and unaccompanied 
hold baggage. The requirements can be met in a number of ways, 
but airlines operating both here and at other UK airports might 
do well to take advantage of Manchester's experience in 
operating an effective automated baggage management system. 
  "In doing so, they will be certain of complying with our new 
security requirements. In addition, they may find that such a 
system will more than pay for itself in commercial terms by 
drastically reducing the amount of misrouted baggage".

<F P=106> [Report by John Deane, PA News] </F>
  [Text] A policeman was killed and two of his colleages are 
seriously ill in hospital today after a suspected mortar attack 
on a mobile patrol in Northern Ireland. 
  Their Land Rover was rocked by a blast as it drove along 
Spencer Road, in the Waterside area of Londonderry, shortly 
before midnight. 
  The RUC [Royal Ulster Constabulary] confirmed that one male 
officer was killed, and two others "very seriously injured" in 
the attack. 
  Early today a spokesperson at the town's Altnagelvin 
Hospital 
said the two injured officers were in "a very serious condition". 
  The blast was heard over a wide area of Londonderry. 
Security forces sealed off the largely commercial road before 
beginning a search operation. 
  An RUC spokesman said the attack was being treated as ther 
work of the IRA. 
  Earlier in the evening, a man was shot and injured at a 
police checkpoint in South Armagh. 
  Police said the man was taken to hospital suffering from a 
leg wound after a number of shots were fired by police at a 
civilian vehicle. Another man was arrested. 
  An investigation was mounted after the incident at Ballsmill 
Road near Silverbridge. 
  The scene is a few miles from Crossmaglen, where a major 
security operation has been mounted in recent days at the start 
of major re-building work at the village security base which has 
been regularly attacked by the IRA.

<F P=106> [Article by Colonel I. Ignatyev] </F>
  [Text] In the early 1980's, the Pentagon began implementing 
a program of more extensive use of outer space for military 
purposes. The motives for these activities are reflected in the 
words of J. Abrahamson, director of the SDI (Strategic Defense 
Initiative) Program: "Space is the first line of defense." 
  The question of gaining superiority in space became 
particularly critical in connection with the launching of a 
program for creating an antiballistic missile [ABM] defense 
system with space-based elements. It was during this period in 
the United States that a jump in appropriations for military 
space was observed (from $6.7 billion in 1982 to $10.6 billion 
in 1984), AFM 1-6 Military Space Doctrine (15 October 1982) and 
AFM 1-1 Basic Aerospace Doctrine (16 March 1984) were issued, 
and the first steps were taken to organize the American space 
forces. 
  Creation of space commands -- first in the branches of the 
U.S. Armed Forces and then a unified command -- entirely 
corresponds to the principles of organizational development of 
the American Army and Navy. Maintenance of military equipment 
and upkeep of personnel are entrusted to the so-called main 
(administrative) commands, and their operational use and combat 
employment are entrusted to the unified (operational) commands. 
The main commands are subordinate to the departments of the 
branches of the armed forces, and the unified commands are 
directly subordinate to the Joint Chiefs of Staff [JCS]. 
  Before creation of the space commands, functions for the 
operation and control of satellites in orbit were performed 
primarily by the U.S. Air Force Systems Command (no longer in 
existence), which was called upon to oversee the development, 
production, and testing of space equipment. On the whole, the 
Air Force's activities in this area, according to American 
experts, were functionally isolated, organizationally not 
thought through, and technologically limited. 
  A similar picture was observed in the departments of the 
U.S. 
Navy and Army, where the space systems being used also were not 
included in the force composition of the armed forces; that is, 
they were not part of operational formations and large units 
subordinate to the JCS through headquarters, command posts, and 
control centers. In addition, bodies of operational management 
did not exist in the branches of the armed forces for such 
systems, and functions of development, operation, and control 
were entrusted to the same commands. As space activities 
intensified and the role of space systems increased, these 
factors increasingly made their presence felt. According to one 
Pentagon representative, "any event in space immediately 
required the intervention of the JCS and Department of Defense." 
  It should be noted that the U.S. Department of Defense 
encountered serious difficulties from the very start in forming 
the space commands. First, a considerable part of the space 
systems is used in the interests of several branches of the 
armed forces and agencies of central subordination. Second, the 
functioning of ground-based deep-space surveillance and nuclear 
missile attack warning systems is closely linked to military 
space activities. Third, attempts to share space systems caused 
rivalry between branches of the armed forces. Finally, the 
proposed activities of space commands inevitably would affect 
the sphere of responsibility of the unified American-Canadian 
North American Aerospace Defense Command [NORAD], which financed 
the deep-space surveillance and warning systems. 
  As a result of repeated reorganizations and resubordinations 
accomplished since 1979, today a definite structure of space 
commands has taken shape in the U.S. Armed Forces. The central 
role was allotted to the Air Force, which participated most in 
the creation and practical use of space systems. (The Air Force 
accounts for 90 percent of the specialists in the field of space 
and 80 percent of the U.S. military space budget). Surveillance 
and warning systems were removed from control of the NORAD 
Command (for all intents and purposes, Canada did not 
participate in accomplishing the corresponding tasks and 
operating the facilities) and transferred to the space commands 
of the branches of the armed forces. The affiliation of the 
space systems was preserved and determined by what branch 
operated the ground-based control and data collection and 
processing centers and was the primary consumer of the 
information received. 
  The U.S. Space Command [USSPACECOM] was created on 
23 September 1985 (headquarters at Peterson AFB, Colorado) as a 
necessary link of operational management between the JCS and the 
space commands of the branches of the armed forces. Initially, 
the space commands of the Air Force and Navy, and later of the 
Army, were operationally subordinate to the Headquarters of the 
USSPACECOM. Today, this is one of nine unified commands of the 
U.S. Armed Forces. The following were defined as its basic 
missions: Development and constant adjustment of the space 
doctrine and methods of conducting combat operations with the 
use of space assets; estimating troop needs for equipment and 
compiling purchase orders for it; developing the tactical and 
technical requirements for advanced systems; operational control 
of forces and assets of subordinate space commands when 
conducting space operations. 
  According to U.S. Air Force regulations, space operations 
mean possible operations calling for the use of outer space for 
military purposes. They are divided into four groups: Active 
operations, control of outer space, support of ground forces, 
and support of space systems. 
  Antiballistic missile defense and also strikes from space 
against ground targets are considered active operations in the 
United States. 
  Control of outer space includes, on the one hand, operations 
to protect the orbital grouping of spacecraft and, on the other, 
countermeasures against enemy spacecraft and ground services 
(ranges). 
  Various types of satellites are to provide support to ground 
forces: Communications, navigation, reconnaissance, 
meteorological, and other satellites. Today, the United States 
has at its disposal only such assets which are not strictly 
weapons and are not capable of hitting targets in space or from 
space. 
  As far as support of space systems is concerned, this 
includes surveillance of outer space, launching satellites and 
controlling them in orbit, identifying and cataloging space 
objects, and also actions associated with maintaining space 
systems in working order. 
  The USSPACECOM commander is simultaneously the commander of 
NORAD and the Air Force Space Command, and a Navy admiral is 
appointed as his deputy. Attempts to divide these positions 
proved unsuccessful, which indicates the difficulties of 
creating balanced structures in the space forces. 
  Actually, the USSPACECOM is a relative concept, since it 
does 
not possess its own forces and assets. Its only real component 
is the headquarters as a body directly subordinate to the JCS. 
In connection with the impossibility of a clear-cut division of 
the functions of NORAD and the USSPACECOM, the headquarters is 
the same for these commands (there are a number of common 
directorates). The recently formed operations center, which has 
24-hour shifts, and a joint intelligence center, whose tasks 
include continuous global assessment of the current space 
situation, operate under the USSPACECOM. 
  Today, the personnel strength of the command headquarters 
exceeds 650 people; 50 percent Air Force, 30 percent Navy, and 
20 percent Army. When creating and accepting into service new 
elements of the ABM defense system and anti-satellite weapons, 
it is planned to make them operationally subordinate to the 
USSPACECOM. 
  The U.S. Air Force Space Command, created on 1 
September 1982 (headquarters at Peterson AFB), became the first 
formation of this sort in the armed forces. In the period that 
has passed, it has repeatedly undergone substantial 
organizational and structural changes which, apparently, are not 
final. 
  Today, the following belong to the command: All American 
nuclear missile attack warning and deep-space surveillance 
systems; the U.S. Air Force space command, control, and 
telemetry complex; the Western (headquarters at Vandenberg AFB, 
California) and Eastern (Patrick AFB, Florida) missile ranges; 
command, control, and data reception centers of a number of 
space systems; a unified NORAD/USSPACECOM command post at 
Cheyenne Mountain, Colorado. On 1 July 1993, the 20th Air Force, 
consisting of six Minuteman and MX ICBM wings, was transferred 
to the command. As experts believe, this will make it possible 
to more effectively use common logistic and technical support 
facilities to service missile equipment (ICBM's and missile 
platforms) and range services, and to simplify training of 
personnel for common military occupational specialties. 
  The sphere of activities of the Air Force Space Command 
includes operating and servicing corresponding equipment, 
personnel acquisition and training, technical equipping of units 
and subunits, and organizing their daily activities and combat 
training. The space commands of the other branches of the armed 
forces performs similar missions. 
  In addition to the 20th Air Force, the main components of 
this command are four space wings and one space group (Figure 
1). The 21st Space Wing includes all American nuclear missile 
attack warning systems and also the NORAD/USSPACECOM command 
post; the 30th and 45th space wings include the Western and 
Eastern missile ranges, respectively; the 50th Space Wing 
includes the unified military space systems command and control 
center and the Air Force space command, control, and telemetry 
complex; and the 73rd Space Group includes the Spacetrack 
deep-space surveillance system. 

<FIG ID=JPRS-UFM-003L-03A>      Figure 1. Structure of U.S. Air Force Space Command </FIG>


  The IMEWS[.sup]1[/] space-based ballistic missile launch 
detection system provides U.S. military-political leadership 
warning about a nuclear missile attack. It includes four-five 
satellites constantly operating in a stationary orbit, ground 
information reception centers at Buckley AFB, (Colorado), 
Narranger (Australia), Kapaun (FRG), six mobile reception 
complexes at Holloman AFB (New Mexico), and also BMEWS, Pave 
Paws (Figure 2 [not reproduced]), and Parks ground-based systems 
(a total of eight radar sites in the continental United States, 
Alaska, Greenland, and Great Britain). With the exception of 
Alaska (the site at Clear), all nuclear missile attack warning 
system sites are equipped with modern powerful radars with 
phased-array antennas capable of detecting ballistic targets at 
ranges up to 5000 km. 
  The deep-space surveillance system (organic assets -- 
Spacetrack system sites, committed assets -- sites of scientific 
research centers and agencies and also U.S. test ranges) 
includes a total of 15 ground-based radar and optical 
(optico-electronic, Figure 3 [not reproduced]) surveillance 
sites. The bulk of them are located in middle latitudes on the 
territory of the United States, Turkey, Italy, South Korea, and 
islands of the Pacific, Indian, and Atlantic Oceans. 
  Deep-space surveillance systems (Air Force and Navy), if 
necessary, are able to support conduct of active operations to 
protect American satellites and to counter space activities of 
other countries. They conduct surveillance of space objects 
(perform 60,000 coordinate measurements daily). The NORAD and 
USSPACECOM command posts have a catalog of approximately 7,000 
space objects, where data of these observations are registered. 
During the latest reorganizations, ground centers of U.S. 
reconnaissance space systems and satellite communications 
intercept sites of other countries located at Misawa Air Base 
(Japan), Griffiss AFB (New York), and Lackland AFB (Texas), and 
also in the areas of Edzell and Feltwell (Great Britain) were 
included as part of the 73rd Space Group. 
  The 50th Space Wing is a large subunit of the Air Force 
Space 
Command. As the command structure developed, the Air Force space 
command, control, and telemetry complex (SCCTC), ground-based 
infrastructures of the main communications (DSCS, NATO-3), 
navigation (NAVSTAR), weather reconnaissance (DMSP), and other 
systems were consolidated into it. It is planned to transfer the 
LANDSAT natural resource reconnaissance satellites and 
corresponding ground equipment to the wing. 
  Through the SCCTC, the Air Force control the majority of 
U.S. 
reconnaissance satellites, experimental spacecraft, and also 
equipment used for working out space components of antiballistic 
missile defense under the SDI Program. Every day 9 sites (on the 
territory of the United States, Great Britain, and Greenland) 
conduct about 600 communications sessions with satellites and 
accomplish continuous control of more than 70 spacecraft in 
orbit. 
  In compressed time periods, literally in several years, 
Falcon AFB was turned into the largest facility, which comprised 
a single whole with the adjacent NORAD and USSPACECOM command 
post, the Air Force Space Command Headquarters, and the Air 
Force Academy in the "space" state of Colorado. This air base 
houses the main center for control of U.S. military space 
systems (total area of 27,000 square km), which is combined with 
the control center of the experimental test complex where the 
SDI Program is accomplished. Here the major satellite 
communications center, the central Air Force SCCTC post, the 
main control station, and leading control station of the NAVSTAR 
navigation system are deployed. 
  Presently, personnel of the 30th and 45th space wings, 
respectively, accomplish operation of all structures of the 
Western and Eastern missile test ranges, servicing of launch 
complexes, and preparation of spacecraft for launch. Operational 
services of the Eastern Range are additionally charged with 
providing security for Space Shuttle launches, and launches of 
ballistic missiles from U.S. and British submarines from 
adjacent water areas of the Atlantic Ocean. Minuteman and MX 
ICBM's as well as target missiles (under the SDI Program) are 
launched from the Western Missile Range to the vicinity of the 
Kwajalein ABM Range (Marshall Islands). 
  The United States mainly uses various models of Atlas, 
Delta, 
Scout, and Titan booster rockets at this stage. According to 
American estimates, up to 40 percent of the military space 
budget is spent on their procurement, launch preparation, and 
launch. However, in connection with the high degree of 
automation at launch complexes of both ranges, no more than 
16,000 military and civilian specialist are permanently employed. 
  The total personnel strength of the Air Force Space Command 
is presently (not counting the 20th Air Force) more than 30,000, 
with up to 14,000 of them civilian specialists. 
  Organization of the U.S. Navy Space Command began 
on 1 September 1983 based on the Navy's existing deep-space 
surveillance system, several space systems, and their ground 
components. Presently, the command, which includes the Navy's 
SPASUR space surveillance system, operates the satellite 
navigation (Transit), communications (FLTSATCOM, LISAT), and SSU 
maritime and ocean theater reconnaissance systems. Its main 
structural components are an aerospace group, a space operations 
support center, and a space reconnaissance and surveillance 
directorate (Figure 4). 

<FIG ID=JPRS-UFM-003L-04A>      Figure 4. Organizational Structure of U.S. Navy Space Command </FIG>


  The SPASUR system consists of nine radar sites (three 
transmitting and six receiving) located in the southern U.S. 
states which create along the 33-degree north latitude parallel 
a solid barrier beam for detecting spacecraft using scattered 
reception of reflected signals (interferometric method). 
Together with Air Force Spacetrack sites, they form the 
integrated SPADATS deep-space surveillance system, which 
accomplishes missions in the interests of the Defense 
Department. The SPASUR system supplies up to 75 percent of the 
information for the already mentioned general catalog at the 
NORAD/USSPACECOM command post. 
  The leadership of the American Navy most actively opposed 
creation of a unified space command, fearing infringement of its 
interests on the part of the Air Force, which repeatedly has 
raised the issue of transferring all space activities under its 
control. As a compromise, a procedure was adopted under which a 
U.S. Navy admiral was appointed NORAD/USSPACECOM deputy 
commander. 
  Today, the personnel strength of the Navy Space Command 
varies between 2,000 and 3,000 people, and its headquarters (100 
people) is at Dahlgren, Virginia. 
  The Army Strategic Defense and Space Command 
(ASDSC) was created in 1992 as a result of a merger of the 
Space Command (formed 7 April 1988) and the Strategic Defense 
Command (1 July 1985), responsible for implementing Army 
projects within the framework of the SDI Program. There were two 
main causes for the difficulties of its formation: The U.S. 
Army's lack of its own space systems and the need to tie various 
tasks into a single complex justifying the creation of such a 
command. 
  Today, the ASDSC performs two basic functions -- 
participation in space activities of the Department of Defense 
and supervising research projects in the field of antiballistic 
missile defense. A number of ground-based control centers and 
sites of the DSCS strategic satellite communications system and 
NAVSTAR satellite radio-navigation communications system, as 
well as the Kwajalein ABM test range (Pacific Ocean) and 
agencies directing scientific research and development in the 
field of ABM defense (Figure 5) belonging to the Army have been 
transferred to the command. 

<FIG ID=JPRS-UFM-003L-05A>      Figure 5. Organizational Structure of U.S. Army Strategic Defense and Space Command </FIG>


  The Army has traditionally participated most actively in 
creating the American ABM defense system. All the major ABM 
program were developed under its leadership: Nike-Zeus, 
Sentinel, Safeguard, and others. Today, within the framework of 
the SDI Program, the Army command authorities organize and 
oversee development of such ground components as radar, 
anti-missile missiles, powerful ground-based lasers, and also 
research and development for creating tactical systems such as 
THAAD, Corps SAM, ERINT anti-missile missiles, and command, 
control, and communications equipment. 
  Prior to the formation of the ASDSC, the personnel strength 
of the Army Space Command was about 450 and that of the 
Strategic Defense Command over 1200. The ASDSC Headquarters 
(about 100 people) was located at Peterson AFB, and the main 
research and development administration bodies in the ABM field 
are located in Arlington, Virginia, and Huntsville, Alabama. 
  On the whole, the U.S. Army Strategic Defense and Space 
Command serves as an example of a sufficiently artificial, 
compromise organizational structure, the appearance of which was 
the result of rivalry between the branches of the armed forces 
and a reluctance to lag behind others. 
  Such are the basic functions, structure, and composition of 
the space commands of the U.S. Armed Forces. The diversity of 
missions associated with space activities, the difficulties of 
classifying equipment and distributing functions, and the 
different degree of participation of the branches of the armed 
forces in space programs in the end prevented the American 
military leadership from creating balanced and equal tables of 
organization and establishment. 
  A statement made in May 1993 by the chairman of a U.S. House 
of Representatives subcommittee for armed forces appropriations, 
D. Murtha, is typical: "It is a strange thing that we annually 
spend $15 billion (U.S. military space budget--I.I.) and no one 
is responsible for this." Another example is observance of a 
schedule of rocket booster launches from U.S. ranges. As 
American experts calculated, from 1990 through 1992, when the 
missile test ranges were already under the jurisdiction of the 
Air Force Space Command, only four percent of the booster rocket 
launches were accomplished on schedule, and some waited several 
months to be launched. To demonstrate the point, we will point 
out that a 24-delay in the launch of a heavy Titan-4 booster 
rocket costs the Defense Department $6.8 million. 
  National security is considered the primary goal of American 
space policy; therefore, the space commands will continue to 
keep their status. "Despite the end of the Cold War," stated 
former Chairman of the JCS C. Powell, "our national security 
will, as before, depend on the effectiveness of space systems." 
For several years, the United States voted against adoption of 
any resolutions in the UN on demilitarization of outer space, 
striving to convince other countries that space was already 
militarized long ago, and in the interests of mankind itself. 
  At one time, creation of space commands meant transferring 
space systems from the sphere of scientific research activities 
to the area of combat employment and including them directly in 
the combat structure of the armed forces. By the year 2000 the 
Clinton Administration plans to reduce the Pentagon's military 
space budget 15 percent. Time will tell how much these good 
intentions are fulfilled.

  [Text] Receiving information about enemy and friendly 
troops is inconceivable without a clear-cut organization of use 
of three basic means of transmitting and distributing data on 
the battlefield -- courier service, landline channels, and radio 
communications. The rapid development of communications 
equipment technology, the increase in troop mobility, and the 
increase in requirements for providing information on a 
real-time basis brings radio communications to the forefront, 
with main importance given to radio frequency service [RFS]. 
However, up to the present it has never been taken into 
consideration when planning combat operations. 
  It was precisely such a situation that arose at the very 
start of Operation Desert Shield, when the transfer of units and 
subunits of the Multinational Forces [MNF] to the area of the 
conflict began without a general frequency plan -- list of 
frequencies, time of their operation, callsigns, and procedure 
for changing them. The lack of a plan was not an obstacle to 
using the radio spectrum, but command and control of weapon 
systems and troops depends on strict radio discipline when the 
density of radio equipment on the battlefield increases. 
  As a rule, the radio frequency spectrum is the property of 
each government, but the government of Saudi Arabia transferred 
the right of its use to the unified Central Command [CENTCOM] of 
the U.S. Armed Forces. At the beginning of the transfer (August 
1990), troops arrived in the areas of combat operations without 
the appropriate equipment and capabilities for recording and 
allocating the spectrum. Several months were needed to develop 
procedures and deploy the necessary equipment to allocate 
operating frequencies among the thousands of radio nets which 
oversaturated the airways over the territories of Saudi Arabia, 
Kuwait, and Iraq. 
  In the initial stage, specialists tried to use frequency 
spectrum management methods worked out during peacetime. They 
were based on the concept of centralized management: Each 
frequency is assigned and registered by the center. In this 
connection, permanent data bases were created which were 
carefully updated and registered as frequencies were allocated. 
However, it proved to be impossible to maintain the data base as 
a result of the constant change of the organization and 
establishment of the arriving troops and their relocations. 
  The concept of centralized management assumes that the 
technical characteristics and geographic coordinates are known 
for each radio and that, for all practical purposes, it is 
stationary or moves very little. Based on this, a calculation is 
made of the range of reception and direction of propagation of 
the radio signal. Next, the static characteristics are 
consolidated into a frequency plan, the purpose of which is 
separation of the radio stations in space and by frequency in 
order to avoid mutual interference. All this is accomplished 
with the use of highly productive computer equipment. 
  Each branch of the armed forces whose subunits and units 
arrived in the theater of war transferred its own radio 
frequency service system. And not a single one was compatible 
with another. Operational-level specialists had virtually no 
experience working on the scale of such a large theater. As a 
rule, they practiced their operations at small exercises (like 
the Bright Star exercises conducted in Egypt). The number of 
requests for use of frequencies literally swept over the 
service. In the initial stage, work came down to accounting for 
and registration of requests relayed to the Electromagnetic 
Compatibility Analysis Center of the U.S. Department of Defense 
(Annapolis, Maryland). But this process, intended for work with 
stationary communications equipment, cannot in any way satisfy 
the needs of hundreds of mobile bodies operating close to one 
another. As a result, the tasks of allocating the frequency 
spectrum were entrusted to the U.S. Air Force Radio Frequency 
Service Center at Buzzard's Point, Washington, D.C. 
  Traditionally, the Air Force, which has a large amount of 
radio equipment, gave preference to the concept of centralized 
use of the radio frequency service. This was because their air 
bases are stationary, and the pilots reluctantly agreed to a 
multiple shift of frequencies and callsigns, which, in their 
opinion, increased risk during combat operations. The Navy 
command authorities took this position for roughly the same 
reasons. However, the dynamics of development of the operation, 
the changing scope of the battlefield, and the huge number of 
radios used in the Army and Marines required a different 
approach. 
  The problems with frequency spectrum allocation began 
immediately after arrival of the first aircraft with subunits of 
the XVIII Airborne Corps. The RFS section of CENTCOM 
Headquarters, which numbered one person, received the first 
request from the XVIII Airborne Corps on 7 August 1990. By 1 
October it still had not been satisfied. Having encountered such 
a situation, corps specialists were forced to choose frequencies 
independently for communications. In the words of one operator, 
life forced them to use unauthorized frequencies. "The command 
is not disturbed about what frequency you are operating on," he 
said. "The main thing is carrying out the combat mission. 
Therefore, I had two frequency lists -- one authorized for use 
by CENTCOM Headquarters and one chosen by us. We carefully use 
both, and there were no complications. If the enemy would have 
been clever, he could have taken advantage of this shortcoming." 
  During operations Desert Shield and Desert Storm, each 
branch 
of the armed forces occupied those frequencies that were best 
suited for carrying out the missions, totally ignoring the 
requirements and state of affairs of their colleagues. Actually, 
there was a total lack of coordination at all echelons -- from 
the level of the CENTCOM commander to the tactical level. 
  CENTCOM Headquarters tried to solve this problem; however, 
the strict centralized radio frequency service oriented on 
peacetime was crushed by the flow of information. The data base 
of the CENTCOM radio frequency service registered radio 
equipment by its location, and frequency allocation accomplished 
from the United States did not at all satisfy the demands 
imposed by a joint operation of such a scale. Specialists of the 
35th Signal Brigade, XVIII Airborne Corps, arbitrarily allocated 
frequencies for microwave relay communications, since they did 
not even have a personal computer for this. A situation 
developed in which units and subunits of the coalition forces, 
using the entire existing frequency band, created constant 
interference for one another, which led to a considerable 
deterioration of the operating parameters of nets and an 
increase in work outages. 
  This situation could not exist very long. Temporary measures 
were taken to correct the situation. CENTCOM Headquarters 
allocated among subunits blocks of the frequency band within 
which they themselves accomplished dispatcher functions. Main 
attention was given to the UHF band (220-404 MHz), the most 
saturated with stations and interference. It was in this band 
that tactical-level communications (satellite and 
"air-to-ground-to-air") are accomplished and data transmission 
and other systems operate. Despite the urgency of resolving this 
matter, it took nearly two weeks to coordinate between the 
bodies of the branches of the armed forces. The greatest 
difficulty arose when examining the 4.4-5.0 GHz band. Powerful 
transmitters of troposcatter communications systems and 
low-power SHF transmitters operated in this band. 
  The lack of a radio frequency service also had a negative 
effect on waging "electronic warfare." The task of compiling a 
combined list of forbidden frequencies (on which jamming is 
forbidden) proved to be virtually impossible. As a result, 
sometimes there were gaps in conducting electronic warfare 
operations. 
  Analyzing the results of combat operations, specialists made 
the following conclusions: 
  1. Radio frequency service operates at all levels of 
command; 
however, frequency management is accomplished in each instance 
by the operator. 
  2. RFS should be decentralized and operate in each echelon 
of 
transferred troops. The more echelons transferred, the greater 
the need for decentralization. 
  3. Officers of the service must possess sufficient skill to 
understand the requirements of units of his echelon. 
  4. Up to 90 percent of the frequency allocations should be 
completed prior to the transfer of troops to a theater of 
military operations, and the remaining 10 percent should be 
completed at the destination, but without additional 
administrative procedures. 
  5. When using different types of equipment in one band in a 
limited geographical area, the frequency band must be allocated 
proportionally in accordance with requirements, for example, for 
air-ground-air communications, tactical satellite 
communications, microwave relay communications, and so forth. 
  6. Allocation of frequency resources must be coordinated 
with 
the priorities of the commander in chief for the theater of 
military operations. 
  7. Management of the frequency spectrum must be accomplished 
in an optimum manner and in such a way as to permit joint use of 
frequencies. 
  8. In planning, it is advisable to proceed from an overall 
plan of actions and predict needs that may arise during the 
course of development of combat operations and when individual 
operations become complicated. 
  9. For accurate calculation of the electromagnetic 
compatibility and mutual interference, it is necessary to have 
available precise data on the technical characteristics of 
equipment and order of troop deployment. 
  Despite the fact that today the majority of transmissions in 
the radio frequency spectrum that are used in the U.S. Armed 
Forces are encoded, the enemy can still use electronic [ELINT] 
and communications intelligence [COMINT] assets to determine 
troop combat formations. The most effective instrument in this 
struggle is the frequency plan. It serves two goals: It is used 
as a reference and as a means of communications security. In the 
latter case, enemy ELINT and COMINT assets are counted by 
arbitrary assignment of callsigns, regular changing of them, and 
also changing of operating frequencies. 
  In recent years, the importance of a frequency plan has 
decreased a means of countering COMINT and ELINT. This is caused 
by the considerable spread of secure telephone communications at 
the tactical level and also radio equipment with a low 
likelihood of intercept; for example, Singars radios with a 
programmable operating frequency. Now the frequency plan is used 
mainly as a reference aid. This was graphically confirmed during 
the course of the operation by U.S. Armed Forces in Grenada. 
Soon after its conclusion, the commanders in chief in the 
theater of military operations set the task of creating a 
unified frequency plan which would include all units and 
subunits under their command. 
  The National Security Agency [NSA] compiled such a frequency 
plan for the main command of U.S. Armed Forces in the Atlantic, 
which was tested in a series of exercises conducted. However, at 
the start of Operation Desert Shield, after arriving in the area 
of the conflict, units and subunits subordinate to this command 
discovered that their frequency plan was not very effective. It 
turned out to be incompatible with frequency allocations of 
other commands of the U.S. Armed Forces and the coalition 
troops, and also with the requirements of the country they were 
in. They had to create a new frequency plan for operations 
Desert Shield and Desert Storm. More than 10 variants were 
developed, taking up about 500,000 pages of text. These 
classified reference books were delivered on military transport 
aircraft to Saudi Arabia, where they were distributed directly 
among users. 
  Initially, a question arose as to what kind of a structure 
the frequency plan should have -- composite to the platoon level 
or just for the higher echelon (with tactical subunits 
authorized to develop their own plans). The first viewpoint was 
adopted, because practically all units subordinate to the 
commander in chief of U.S. Armed Forces in the Atlantic prepared 
their own plans with corresponding data bases, and in the event 
the other solution was adopted, it would have taken considerable 
time to revise them. In addition, the question of allocating 
frequencies for the CENTCOM remained unclear. Thus, the 
composite plan was the only acceptable alternative to quickly 
solve the problem. 
  Development of the plan was accomplished when the pace of 
transferring troops to the zone began to build up. On arrival, 
many units and subunits used the most diverse frequency plans -- 
peacetime for operating at their permanent dispositions and 
wartime for transfer to the European zone. (Before the war, a 
frequency plan intended for use by the U.S. Army in the FRG and 
certain other NATO countries was the only one formally developed 
in the Persian Gulf zone). 
  The structure of the frequency plan is quite sensitive to 
changes in the effective troop strength. Replacements and 
decisions made at the last minute about leaving individual 
subunits forced them to make a radical revision of the variant 
already prepared, and to republish it. 
  Traditionally, frequency plans were compiled on paper in the 
form of pamphlets, which are then disseminated to the units. 
However, in the past decade, a question was raised about the 
creation of electronic equipment for developing and 
disseminating them directly in the localities independently of 
central bodies. The main advantage of such a method is its 
flexibility: The commander of an operational echelon changes the 
structure of his forces himself and updates the frequency plan 
in accordance with it. One year before the start of the Persian 
Gulf conflict, a special commission of the U.S. Joint Chiefs of 
Staff was created to study this matter. After conclusion of 
combat operations and an analysis conducted by the commission, 
it was concluded that before switching to electronic means, it 
is necessary to have for each commander-in-chief and forces 
subordinate to him a plan drawn up on paper for operations in an 
emergency situation. It must ensure deployment of troops within 
three days and their subsequent operations for three months. 
Only later is it planned to compile a frequency plan using 
special electronic equipment. According to the decision of the 
JCS commission, this may be equipment based on a regular 
personal computer developed by the U.S. Army under the special 
program "An Electronic System for Compiling a Frequency Plan on 
the Battlefield." Dissemination of frequency plans among 
consumers will be accomplished using NSA data transmission and 
dissemination networks or magnetic disks.

  [Text] A result of rapid scientific and technical 
progress is the involvement of increasingly new fields of 
scientific knowledge in improving weapons. These fields include 
those which earlier had practically no military application. 
Thus, research in the field of the environment has intensified 
foreign armies recently. 
  An important goal in improving weapons and military 
equipment 
is to make them independent of climate and weather conditions, 
time of day, or time of year. The effectiveness of automated 
target search and identification systems and high-precision 
weapons, which have become widespread, depends on proper 
consideration of the characteristics of the environment and 
increases the importance of this factor for success in 
conducting combat operations. 
  Decreasing the visibility of objects in the primary physical 
fields entails studying the fine, previously insignificant 
mechanisms of their interaction with the environment -- 
characteristics of the vapor and turbulence trail in the 
atmosphere and changes in its chemical and physical properties 
on the flight route of airborne vehicles, characteristics of the 
fine structure of surface wave action of an ocean wave and its 
temperature characteristics, background noise of the ocean and 
its bioluminescence, characteristics of passage of acoustic 
signals in sediment layers of the ocean bed and shelf, and so 
forth. Work in these directions should lead to the creation of 
new, nontraditional systems for detecting low-observable and 
camouflaged objects. 
  Knowing the characteristics of the environment makes it 
possible to create secretive jamming of signal and 
electro-optical intelligence gathering, communications, 
navigation, and weapons guidance equipment that is perceived as 
the effect of natural geophysical factors. 
  Promising directions include the use of artificial or 
natural 
phenomena as elements of military systems. Thus, the property of 
the ionosphere to reflect a radio wave of a certain band has 
found application for organizing long-range HF communications 
and over-the-horizon detection. Nonuniformity of the troposphere 
also plays an important role. The task of using artificially 
created disturbed areas in the ionosphere for military purposes 
is on the agenda. Such areas with an increased concentration of 
electrons could serve as sort of mirrors that can be used to 
increase the range of reconnaissance, communications, and 
electronic warfare. The area of ionosphere excited by an 
electromagnetic field of an HF band on two nearby frequencies 
can be a very effective source of radio waves of a band of 
extremely low frequencies (1-20 Hz) necessary for communicating 
with submerged submarines. Other artificially modified areas of 
the earth's ionosphere and magnetosphere -- for example, 
artificial northern lights -- are also promising for electronic 
warfare. 
  The importance of military applications of astronomy has 
increased again. The U.S. Air Force is studying, on a conceptual 
level, a system of navigation-time support using radio-frequency 
emission of quasars. 
  In 1990, environmental research in the interests of 
optimizing the characteristics and methods of combat employment 
of means of warfare (weapon system environics) was recognized 
for the first time as a "critical military technology" of the 
U.S. Department of Defense. It became one of 20 (later 21) such 
technologies and was given the name "Weapon System Environment." 
Thus, the importance of this research was noted for achieving 
long-term goals of U.S. military-technical policy and its 
ability to radically (three-fold or more) improve the functional 
characteristics of weapons systems. 
  With the adoption of the new "national defense" policy in 
1992 and the new principles of creating weapons and military 
equipment, changes were made to the methodology of structuring 
and evaluating advanced military technologies. The latter began 
to be called "key" technologies. The new list includes 11 such 
technologies, but more capacious ones, since each combines three 
to five "critical technologies." "Weapon System Environment" was 
included on that list without changes, having a high priority 
for all potential areas of scientific and technical 
breakthrough.[.sup]1[/] 
  In connection with the increase in the sensitivity of each 
new generation of sensors, weapon systems and methods of their 
combat employment increasingly depend on accurate knowledge of 
the conditions of the environment (weather, time of year, 
terrain relief). Bringing to light the dependence and potential 
opportunities for more effective use of armament on these 
conditions will help accomplish the task of optimizing the 
specifications and performance characteristics of existing and 
new systems. Elements of the technology include a whole network 
of remote sensors with a wide field of view and high resolution 
and new systems for obtaining information. 
  The technology of taking into account the properties of the 
environment of weapons employment differs from other "key 
technologies" by the fact that, as a rule, it does not require 
development of special equipment. Its inclusion on the list of 
priority military scientific research and development is the 
result of the fact that it is necessary for the selection, 
development, and employment of preferable weapon systems when 
accomplishing such tasks as antisubmarine defense, battlefield 
reconnaissance, communications, and others. 
  The basic directions of development of this technology 
include: Forecasting the condition of the atmosphere, modeling 
ocean conditions, underwater acoustics, environment scenarios, 
and remote sounding. 
  The importance of the environment in employing weapons and 
military equipment should increase for three main reasons: A 
future military conflict will not be long -- success in the 
first battle may be decisive; countering quiet enemy submarines 
and stealth aircraft and missiles requires the most accurate 
information about the environment; low-intensity local conflicts 
increase the demand for information about the environment on a 
real-time basis. 
  Modeling shows that using reliable information about the 
environment will make it possible to increase the probability of 
acoustic detection of submarines by 30-40 percent, the range of 
first detection by 20-80 percent, and the duration of 
maintaining contact with the submarine by 20-40 percent. This 
will be a decisive factor for repelling an attack by low-noise 
enemy submarines and restoring the level of superiority achieved 
by the United States in antisubmarine warfare. 
  Modern high-precision weapons demonstrate an unacceptably 
high level of false actuations during testing in various 
meteorological conditions. Consideration of environmental 
factors already in the weapon designing stage may significantly 
decrease this shortcoming. 
  Electromagnetic disturbances of the ionosphere cause 
disruptions in work and errors in target coordinates determined 
by over-the-horizon radars. They cause disruptions in 
communications (especially HF communications in high latitudes) 
and also decrease the probability of detecting stealth targets 
(especially at night). At the same time, artificial changing of 
the parameters of the ionosphere and its modification (creating 
local areas with an increased degree of ionization) can be used 
to increase the range of communications and over-the-horizon 
detection and position finding, and increase the range of 
signals intelligence and electronic intelligence collection and 
conducting electronic warfare. Disturbances of the ionosphere 
also affect the work of magnetometric instruments for submarine 
search and magnetic sensors for minesweepers. 
  Assigning targets and planning missions, including selecting 
weapon systems and tactics, to a large degree depend on the 
condition of the environment in which the systems will be used. 
Methods of weather forecasting were developed to evaluate target 
signatures, background signatures, and atmospheric effects. The 
information obtained enables a tactical echelon commander to 
select the weapon system and tactics of engaging a target in the 
expected weather conditions. 
  Forecasting the State of the Atmosphere. The 
physical processes occurring in the mesosphere at altitudes of 
500-800 km have generally been studied well enough to begin 
creating forecasting systems designed for supporting tactical 
decisions about the combat employment of weapon systems. 
Experiments on modeling atmospheric processes on the scale of a 
combat operations area confirm the sufficiency of computer 
capacities and numerical methods for obtaining the data 
necessary for developing forecast models. It is planned to 
develop models of the atmosphere on a tactical scale with high 
resolution in order to combine data obtained in an individual 
combat operations area with regional and global data. This will 
provide tactical echelon commanders with forecasts of weather 
conditions on the battlefield for a period of three to 48 hours. 
Highly accurate forecasts of precipitation and visibility 
conditions and propagation of IR-band emissions will be combined 
directly with terrain relief models, which will make it possible 
to compile forecasts of mobility conditions in the interests of 
tactical planning, forecasts of infrared, visual, and 
electro-optical signatures of possible targets, and also the 
condition of the background for optimum selection of weapon 
systems. 
  Modeling of Ocean Conditions and Underwater 
Acoustics. Rapid progress is observed in the development of 
models of ocean structures and circulation of its masses, which, 
however, is significantly complicated by the huge expanses and 
the need to have available means of collecting data about the 
underwater and surface situation. 
  Hydroacoustics comprises the bulk of modeling of ocean 
processes, the purpose of which is the successful creation and 
employment of means of observing the underwater situation, 
combat weapon systems, and countermeasures that are part of 
antisubmarine warfare [ASW] systems. The missions accomplished 
by this technology include increasing the effectiveness of 
detecting, determining the location, and tracking enemy 
submarines possessing high technical characteristics. In doing 
so, main efforts are concentrated on developing systems of 
active sensors, systems designed for use in the Arctic, and 
seismic sensors. Models of acoustic beam dispersion and 
reverberation are the main components of active systems 
associated with hydroacoustics. They are to support both 
multipositional hydroacoustic systems of warship groups and 
low-frequency active acoustic complexes. Determining the 
characteristics of directed acoustic vibrations in the ocean 
with a high resolution is of great importance for the 
functioning of high-precision active and passive hydroacoustic 
systems. New methods of registering data about large expanses 
and dynamic statistics are being used in developing modern 
hydroacoustic systems. 
  Environment Scenarios. Measurements and modeling 
of dynamic electromagnetic and seismoacoustic processes taking 
place on the earth's surface and in the layer of atmosphere 
adjacent to it make it possible to simulate the real situation, 
which is necessary for evaluation of the characteristics of 
prototypes of guided weapon systems and automatic target 
identification. Simulation makes it possible in the development 
stage, based on a small amount of experimental data, to 
formulate additional requirements for weapons systems and 
possible scenarios of their use. 
  Remote Sounding. Today, main efforts in the area 
of remote sounding are concentrated on studying the changes in 
individual parameters of the environment (for example, wind 
velocity and direction, temperature, and humidity) using lidars 
and radars, as well as such passive sensors as infrared devices. 
  Underwater sensors that do not generate a target image make 
it possible to obtain additional information necessary for 
developing and supporting the operations of future weapon 
systems. However, until acoustic technology is successfully 
used, the effect of the environment on propagation of acoustic 
waves and the "noise-to-signal" ratio must be studied. 
  The "key technology" in question relates virtually to all 
aspects of the U.S. Defense Department's investment strategy, 
since all armament and combat operations with its employment 
depend on factors of the environment. It has been noted 
repeatedly that systems designed without taking into account the 
conditions of their employment have demonstrated major 
shortcomings. 
  Today, the following major programs are being implemented 
within the framework of the "Weapon System Environment" 
technology: 
  --supporting studies of acoustic factors of the environment 
in the interests of antisubmarine warfare (obtaining more 
complete operational and design data for close and long-range 
acoustic surveillance systems); 
  --forecasting the acoustic situation (improving acoustic 
tactical and technical characteristics of ASW systems based on 
forecast models of the ocean state); 
  --forecasting the interaction of the atmosphere with the 
ocean (improving weather forecasting at sea by recording data 
about the mutual effect of these means); 
  --developing new shipborne equipment designed to collect and 
disseminate data about the state of the atmosphere and ocean; 
  --developing tactical-level auxiliary weather support 
systems 
(increasing the capabilities of individual weather stations 
thanks to a more complete combination of regional data with data 
coming in from central institutions in accordance with developed 
forecasting models). 
  Navy systems being developed in accordance with these 
programs include a highly sensitive hydroacoustic antenna array 
and an active low-frequency hydroacoustic system for 
antisubmarine warfare. 
  Data about the atmosphere, space, and the earth's surface 
are 
taken into account when creating automatic target identification 
devices and high-precision weapons for the U.S. Army and Air 
Force (appropriations in the amount of about $100 are million 
planned for them in the next few years), and also in 
developments within the framework of the Strategic Defense 
Initiative Organization under plans for deployment of the 
first-phase ABM system. To ensure successful collection of data 
from many sensors and expansion of the capabilities for making 
independent decisions, consideration of environment factors in 
the early stages of designing these devices and optimization and 
study of the results of their testing take on special importance. 
  American specialists are developing a weather station for 
providing tactical echelon commanders forecasts and information 
making it easier to plan combat operations and select the 
appropriate weapon systems. When they enter service, models of 
weather forecasts in the combat operations areas for a period of 
three to 48 hours will be used. They are necessary for taking 
into account weather factors during daily planning of combat 
activities. These stations will operate in various command and 
control echelons and be operated by subunits and meteorology 
specialists from the Air Force. 
  The Defense Department is cooperating closely with other 
U.S. 
government departments in developing this technology. The 
National Agency for Meteorology and Oceanology bears primary 
responsibility for conducting observations and disseminating 
weather reports and weather forecasts in the United States. It 
also finances the program for creating a prototype of a regional 
meteorological system designed for studying environment factors 
in the areas of armed conflicts. Studies of atmospheric and 
oceanic processes are being conducted under the aegis of NASA, 
the Department of Energy, the Environmental Protection Agency, 
the National Science Foundation, and the Department of 
Agriculture (Forest Service). NASA and the National Science 
Foundation organize limited oceanographic research, and the NASA 
program in the area of remote sounding evokes much interest in 
the U.S. Defense Department. 
  Scientific research and development in industry is quite 
limited in nature and is basically concentrated on construction 
and monitoring of polluted environment. It should be noted that 
the technology base of means of monitoring the atmosphere and 
ocean in the United States is basically dependent on federal 
appropriations. For example, investments of industrial firms in 
independent research and development on geophysics are less than 
five percent of the appropriations allotted to the Air Force for 
this purpose. (By comparison, appropriations of firms for 
research and development in the area of electronics exceed 500 
percent of the level of similar appropriations to the Air Force). 
  Agreements concluded by the United States with NATO and 
other 
western countries are normal in environmental research. The 
global nature of the atmosphere and oceans predetermines the 
need for international cooperation. For example, there is an 
agreement with the FRG on interpretation of synthetic aperture 
radar signals reflected from the sea surface. The experience 
gained makes it possible to understand the essence and build a 
model of complex conditions of a tactical situation and its 
dynamics. Today, scientific research and development being 
conducted in other countries is aimed at accomplishing the 
following tasks: Underwater acoustic research, primarily 
associated with collecting bathymetric data; accurate weather 
forecasts for individual regions; effective integration of 
remote sounding data; improved modeling and simulation of the 
dynamics of environmental conditions. 
  The European Center for Medium-Term Weather Forecasts is the 
world's most authoritative institution providing highly reliable 
and accurate weather forecasts for a period of 3 to 5 days. 
However, little-studied phenomena and subtle changes in the 
layers of the atmosphere, which are critically important for 3 
and 48-hour forecasts, particularly over oceans where data 
collection is limited, continue to pose a serious problem even 
for this center. 
  NATO has a large scientific laboratory (La Spezia, Italy) 
which conducts work in the field of oceanography in the 
interests of improving antisubmarine defense. In the research 
that has been conducted, emphasis was placed on antisubmarine 
defense in shallow-water basins, which is of exceptional 
importance for NATO allies of the United States. 
  The U.S. Defense Department has an agreement with Canada on 
exchanging data on atmospheric phenomena. It also cooperates 
with other NATO countries in conducting full-scale testing of 
optico-electronic and infrared sensors in various weather 
conditions. 
  As the role of remote sounding using satellites increases, 
data collection and processing systems will improve and expand. 
India, China, Brazil, and other countries are actively 
developing technologies of various levels in connection with 
this. 
  Several scientific research groups that are part of the NATO 
Military Research Committee (especially groups for optics and 
infrared technology) are forming a potential mechanism for 
sharing the results of fundamental research on problems of 
oceanography, the atmosphere, and meteorology. The program of 
cooperation on technology issues creates conditions for 
accomplishing a number of tasks associated with underwater 
systems and radio wave propagation in the atmosphere. 
  The branches of the U.S. Armed Forces are sharing with other 
friendly countries problems concerning them within the framework 
of NATO. Main emphasis is on oceanography, underwater acoustics, 
the effect of the atmosphere on infrared sensors, and radio wave 
propagation. Programs being carried out by the United States 
jointly with France and Great Britain are aimed at studying 
atmospheric electricity and the electromagnetic effect on flying 
vehicles. 
  Various aspects of base problems of the physics of the 
atmosphere and functioning of sensors are included in an 
exchange agreement signed between the U.S. Air Force and NATO 
and also in a program of cooperation on technology issues.

  [Text] Despite measures aimed at the development of 
military industry and increasing the scale of research and 
development in the defense sector, India depends on the import 
of new technologies necessary for organizing production of 
modern types of weapons and military equipment. Advanced models 
of armament (main battle tank, light combat aircraft, helicopter 
gunship, missile systems) being developed in the country are 
largely based on foreign technologies. Thus, American or 
British-made equipment and assemblies are being chosen for an 
aircraft being created; a German power plant and transmission 
and a number of other systems and assemblies are being chosen 
for a tank being created. 
  Overseas purchases of necessary technologies and materials, 
as well as combat equipment and weapons, are entrusted to the 
Directorate of Supply and Deliveries of the Department of 
Military Production and Deliveries of India's Ministry of 
Defense. 
  The policy of import purchases being implemented by the 
Ministry of Defense today is determined basically by the 
economic feasibility of developing production of one or another 
type of weapon by Indian industry. At the same time, recognizing 
some technology or type of weapon as strategically important 
gives ground for allocating practically any amount for their 
acquisition. 
  Usually, technical committees organize comparative testing 
in 
addition to a preliminary study of models and technologies 
planned to be purchased both in India and abroad. The decision 
to purchase one or another model is made only after expert 
examination or testing. Priority is given to technologies and 
materials used in the missile industry, new variants of weapons 
and military equipment, and spare parts for systems that are in 
service in the Indian forces. The total volume of imports of 
machine building products is distributed in the following manner 
(in percent): 17 for ships and vessels; 16.6 for control and 
measuring equipment; 13 for communications equipment; 12 for 
construction equipment. In addition, it includes aviation 
equipment, computers, boiler equipment, and parts and assemblies 
for motor vehicles. Petroleum, petroleum products, and 
petrochemical goods take up a considerable share in India's 
import balance (15 percent). About $3 billion were spend for 
these purposes in 1990. The percentage of steel and steel 
products delivered to the country is not great (3 percent). 
  Large transactions for the purchase of import products 
exceeding 10 million rupees ($40,000 U.S.) are approved by a 
government body -- the Secretariat for Industrial 
Authorizations. Ministries, other government organizations, and 
private firms have the right to conclude agreements with foreign 
firms for lesser amounts. Industrial enterprises are authorized 
to import without licenses, drawings and technical documentation 
at a cost of up to 2.5 million rupees. More than 2,000 requests 
to purchase technologies abroad were submitted to the 
Secretariat for Authorizations during 1991. In order to attract 
foreign technologies, the government of India exempted from 
licensing joint ventures of 25 branches of industry located in 
backward areas of the country. 
  At the same time, in the last seven years, imports of 
technologies virtually did not affect branches of industry 
associated with the production of military products. Metallurgy, 
electrical machine building, transportation machine building, 
and the services sector accounted for about 70 percent of the 
agreements on cooperation with foreign firms. On the whole, the 
percentage of agreements on technology transfer increased from 
19 percent in 1984 to 27 percent in 1991, and the volume of 
foreign capital investments in the Indian economy increased 
12-fold. 
  The main developers and transferrers of new technologies in 
the country are: The Council for Scientific and Industrial 
Research (includes 39 scientific institutes and laboratories and 
also two scientific associations), six specialized departments 
of the country's central government (science and technology, 
atomic energy, space, electronics, development of the ocean, 
environment, and ecology), organizations of defense research and 
development of the Ministry of Defense, branch scientific 
research centers of other ministries and departments, private 
scientific research centers (the largest belong to the groups 
Tata, Birla, Singhania, Sri Ram), specialized planning and 
design firms, and scientific research and development offices 
and laboratories of industrial enterprises of the state and 
private sector. The state plays the main role in financing all 
scientific research and development work, providing more than 85 
percent of the expenditures for this purpose. 
  The following countries have agreements on the transfer of 
technologies to India or joint ventures with India: the United 
States, Germany, Russia, Switzerland, Great Britain, Japan, 
France, Italy, Belgium, Sweden, the Netherlands, Finland, 
Canada, Denmark, and also Hong Kong. Agreements were concluded 
in 1991 in the amount of about 1.5 billion rupees (1.077 billion 
in 1987). The number of agreements signed with American firms 
has increased constantly: 148 in 1984, 189 in 1986, 217 in 1988, 
and over 200 in 1990. 
  India's import-export policy at the current stage provides 
for 944 positions on a list of products authorized for import 
into the country under an open general license. This import 
practice extends to the software sector and other technical 
documentation in the field of information science. Duties on 
imports of computer programs have decreased 60 percent, but at 
the same time the maximum proportion of loan capital in capital 
investments increased to 80 percent. (This indicator is accepted 
as 60 percent for industry as a whole). For all types of goods, 
there is a widespread practice of pre- and post-shipment 
crediting of exports with a term of 6 months at the rate of 9.5 
percent annually. 
  Today the Indian leadership is encountering considerable 
difficulties in purchasing arms and military technologies abroad 
that have strategic importance. Restrictions of the Coordinating 
Committee (COCOM) for controlling exports of the latest 
technologies from NATO countries and Japan apply to it. These 
countries closely monitor to see that India's military industry 
and army do not receive access to the latest weapon systems. In 
addition, the West continues to be concerned that India does not 
transfer the technologies it has and products produced using 
them to third-party countries, primarily Russia and other CIS 
states. There presently are at least 150 American monitors in 
India monitoring observance of the provisions of the 
Indian-American memorandum on technology transfer (1985). At the 
same time, its leadership has more than once stated its desire 
to accomplish this monitoring independently, since the 
above-mentioned referendum does not contain any articles about 
conducting this type of inspections. 
  Recently, this position by the Americans has led to certain 
difficulties for India and Russia when executing a joint 
transaction for the sale of cryogenic engines for missile 
systems. Indian programs in the area of creating ballistic 
missiles and also nuclear research are in obvious contradiction 
with the aspirations of the leading countries of the West to 
limit the proliferation of missile technologies in the world and 
also to narrow the range of states possessing nuclear weapons. 
At the same time, India advances the argument that its security 
today can be ensured only if it has at its disposal weapons 
which its neighboring states have. 
  India's successful testing of the "Prithvi" missile system 
in 
September 1992 makes it possible to assert that the country is 
already able to produce missile weapons. This event caused 
considerable concern in the West. 
  It is known that Soviet models of weapons and military 
equipment account for 50 to 70 percent of the armament of the 
Indian Army. According to the Indian press, its operation over a 
considerable period has demonstrated sufficient reliability and 
the necessary combat qualities. The simplicity of its servicing 
is also noted, which is also quite important for this country's 
army. Weapons received from the USSR underwent testing during 
combat operations in 1965 and 1971, and during operations 
conducted by Indian armed forces in Sri Lanka. 
  Maintaining the achieved level of military and 
military-technical ties between Russia and India is important 
for both sides. The sphere of their cooperation may be expanded 
in the near future by the introduction of new forms in addition 
to tested forms, new ones taking shape in modern-day Russia.

  [Text] Radical changes in the military-political situation 
in Europe, the result of deep socio-economic reforms in East 
European countries and CIS states, have made adjustments to the 
coalition military doctrine of NATO. The "new strategic concept" 
adopted at a session of the North Atlantic alliance in Rome in 
1991, which actually is the coalition military doctrine, defines 
the basic requirements for the bloc's armed forces, taking into 
account the changed situation in Europe. Its most important 
guideline is revision of the priority directions of NATO 
activities, and the emphasis is being shifted from the military 
to the political area. The bloc leadership's approach to 
defining a security threat has also changed, which is expressed 
in the renunciation of the traditional interpretation of the 
"threat from the East" as the main destabilizing factor. The 
term threat has been replaced by the relatively neutral concept 
of risk. This means primarily the military might of Russia and 
the CIS, as well as the instability of the situation in 
countries of Eastern Europe, crises and conflicts outside the 
European continent, and the danger of the proliferation of 
nuclear weapons. Therefore, one of the bloc's basic functions is 
considered the monitoring of crises, including activities to 
prevent them, which assumes a combination of measures of a 
political and military nature. 
  The NATO leadership has planned by the year 2000 to conduct 
a 
radical reform in the area of organizational development of the 
joint armed forces, which along with their technical 
re-equipment will ensure optimal defense sufficiency for the 
bloc. In doing so, main efforts are directed at creating small 
mobile groupings of forces able to respond adequately to various 
types of threats. 
  The substance of the planned military reform in NATO 
essentially comes down to reducing the numerical and combat 
strength of permanent readiness forces with a simultaneous 
increase in the role of reserve components and improvement of 
the system of mobilization deployment. 
  During the course of the force reorganization, three main 
components of NATO's general-purpose forces are being formed: 
Reaction forces, main defensive forces, and reinforcement 
troops. In the estimate of the bloc's military experts, the 
transition to such a three-component structure will make these 
forces more flexible, which will ensure multiple variations of 
their combat employment -- from autonomous use of limited troop 
groupings in local conflicts to successive involvement of all 
components when there is a threat of large-scale military 
operations being unleashed. 
  The bloc leadership assigns an important role to NATO ground 
forces in accomplishing those military-political and military 
tasks which may arise in the future. This article devotes main 
attention primarily to the development of this branch of the 
armed forces. 
  Reaction forces are viewed as a combat-ready 
component of the NATO Armed Forces intended for priority use in 
the event of crisis situations. Structurally, the reaction 
forces include "immediate reaction forces" [IRF] and "rapid 
deployment forces" [RDF]. 
  The "immediate reaction forces" will be created on the basis 
of NATO's existing mobile forces, which includes eight 
reinforced battalions (two from Germany and one each from 
Belgium, Great Britain, Italy, Canada, the Netherlands, and the 
United States) and one company (from Luxembourg). During a 
threatening period and for the duration of exercises, the 
headquarters of mobile ground forces is brought up to strength, 
and an army aviation group and an engineer company (from the 
United States), an artillery headquarters, an air support and 
reconnaissance center, signals and electronic intelligence 
battalions, logistic battalions, a military police subunit (from 
Great Britain), a communications center (from Germany), and a 
helicopter squadron (from Great Britain and Germany) are 
deployed. Combat and logistic support subunits are attached to 
mobile ground forces battalions. Two German airborne battalions 
are reinforced by an artillery battery and two companies (signal 
and medical). The total numerical strength of mobile ground 
forces is about 10,000. Armament includes 125 guns and mortars 
of various calibers, 198 ATGM's, and 56 antiaircraft weapons. In 
the future, it is planned to transfer to them separate subunits 
from Denmark, Spain, and Norway and thus bring the total 
numerical strength to 14,000-15,000 people and the number of 
battalions to 11. 
  It is believed that employment of the IRF will have two 
aspects: Military-political and military. In the first instance, 
they act as a deterrence factor; the multinational composition 
makes it possible to view their participation in combat 
operations as a joint reflection of an attack on the block 
member countries. The military aspect involves using the IRF as 
an advance guard to support the advance and deployment of the 
"rapid deployment forces" on the threatened axis. The RDF must 
be ready for combat operations in 72 hours. 
  The "rapid deployment forces" will become the basis of the 
reaction forces and will consist of formations of all branches 
of the NATO Armed Forces, which will provide them complete 
independence when organizing and conducting combat operations. 
  The basis of the RDF ground forces is to be a allied army 
corps [AAC], which includes 4-5 divisions. It may include an 
armored division and mechanized division from Great Britain, and 
an air-mobile division and mechanized division of mixed 
composition. The experience of NATO Armed Forces exercises of 
recent years shows that an RDF air-mobile division may include 
one air-mobile brigade each from Belgium, Great Britain, and the 
Netherlands and an airborne brigade from Germany (Exercise 
Certain Shield-91). A mechanized division may include Greek, 
Italian, and Turkish brigade. A fifth division (presumably a 
tank division) is to be transferred from Germany's Bundeswehr. 
The final composition of the AAC has not yet been determined. 
The RDF can be additionally built up by 5-6 divisions from 
European NATO countries. The composition of the assigned forces 
will depend specifically on the situation taking shape and the 
scale of the possible military conflict in the initial stage of 
which it is planned to use the RDF. The readiness period of 
large units and units included in these forces by the start of 
combat employment in the intended areas of operation will be 
7-14 days, depending on the remoteness of the predicted areas of 
probable crisis situations. 
  The following requirements are imposed on large units and 
units of RDF ground forces: 
  --High combat readiness as a most important indicator of 
their capability for rapid assembly, advance (transfer) to 
intended areas of operation, and successful accomplishment of 
combat missions. To do this it is necessary to have a high level 
of manning and training, as well as the conduct of intensive 
training of staffs and troops with the practice of different 
variations of combat employment of the RDF. 
  --High mobility is the main characteristic of the RDF which 
provides the capability for advancing a considerable distance in 
a short time period, rapid operational deployment, and conduct 
of highly mobile combat operations regardless of the terrain 
relief at any time of day and in various climate conditions. 
This will be achieved by introducing into the RDF highly mobile 
large units and units equipped with air-transportable armament, 
providing them sufficiently with air and sea transport, and also 
creating stockpiles of supplies. 
  The main defensive forces (regular and mobilized formations) 
in the new structure will comprise the basis of the NATO Armed 
Forces groupings. They are considered the first operational 
echelon when conducting large-scale military operations. By the 
year 2000 these forces may number 34-36 divisions. 
  In the assessment of NATO experts, decreasing the danger of 
the sudden unleashing of war in Europe and also the formation of 
a buffer zone with the CIS countries and Russia will enable 
command authorities not only to reduce the number of large units 
in the bloc's armed forces but also decrease the level of combat 
readiness and the strength level of divisions and separate 
brigades of the ground forces. 
  The basis of the main defensive forces will be 
multinational allied army corps, which it is planned to 
subordinate to the command authorities of the allied ground 
forces. Deployment of the multinational formations is to be 
accomplished as part of the RDF and the main defensive forces in 
the European Theater of War. In peacetime, the headquarters of 
the multinational large units and formations are to be manned 
with personnel from the armed forces of the countries that are 
participating in creating these units. Large units and units of 
the allied army corps will be subordinate to the national 
commands and may be transferred under the command of allied 
headquarters just for the period of conducting measures of 
operational and combat training, and also in crisis situations. 
  The interest demonstrated in NATO towards multinational 
formations is explained more by political than military 
considerations, which creates a firm basis for preserving the 
permanent presence of foreign troops, including U.S. Armed 
Forces, on the territory of Germany. In this regard, during the 
majority of the fall exercises held in 1992, not only did they 
practice variants of conducting combat operations, but they also 
studied the structures and combat capabilities of the 
multinational large units and formations being formed. Special 
attention was given to organizing coordination both at the 
operational echelon and the tactical level. In particular, 
within the framework of the "Wekkerer Schwabe" command and staff 
exercise of Germany's II Army Corps, the concept of combat 
employment of an army corps of multinational composition was 
studied. It was one of the largest measures of this nature in 
the Central European Theater of Military Operations. In addition 
to German troops, staffs of large units and units of the U.S. 
and French armed forces participated in it. 
  The basic goals of the exercise involved testing and 
updating 
plans for combat employment of large units and units of the army 
corps jointly with allied troops in operations of the initial 
period of a war, practicing the principles of combat use of 
multinational formations and large units, and also questions of 
training staffs and command personnel for conducting offensive 
and defensive combat operations. 
  According to preliminary assessments of the NATO allied 
armed 
forces command authorities, large units of a multinational 
composition will have sufficiently broad combat capabilities. 
Today, the bloc's leadership has begun practical implementation 
of plans for creating multinational AAC's. Already this year two 
AAC's will be formed (two divisions is each--from the U.S. and 
German armies). In all, it is planned to deploy up to six allied 
army corps in the Central European Theater of Military 
Operations. They will include large units and units from the 
ground forces of Belgium, Germany, Denmark, the Netherlands, and 
the United States. However, full implementation of these plans 
for creating AAC's requires a number of organizational-technical 
measures aimed, in particular, at solving problems of 
compatibility of communications systems, overcoming the language 
barrier, and also differences on the level of training staffs 
and troops of the participating countries. 
  Reinforcement forces will include regular and 
mobilized formations in European NATO countries and those being 
transferred from the United States and Canada, which are not 
part of the main defensive forces. They are intended for 
reinforcing the first operational echelon and also for creating 
operational and strategic reserves in a theater of military 
operations and a theater of war as a whole. In the assessment of 
military experts, the reinforcement forces can number 18-20 
divisions. Periods of mobilization and redeployment will be 30 
days or more. 
  Questions of improving the command and control system occupy 
an important place within the framework of the planned 
reorganization of NATO Armed Forces in the immediate future. 
Emphasis is placed on increasing centralization of command and 
control at the operational level primarily by eliminating 
intermediate command and control entities and creating new, 
larger coalition commands and headquarters. In particular, 
commands and headquarters of the Northern and Central army 
groups have been disbanded this year, and a command and 
headquarters of allied ground forces in the Central European 
Theater of Military Operations have been created based on them. 
  NATO's military-technical policy for the next 10-15 years 
calls for creating and improving new models of armament for the 
ground forces and also upgrading existing types of weapons. 
  Fourth-generation tanks having great firepower and improved 
armor protection are scheduled to enter service in the late 
1990's. In addition, building up the defensive and fire 
capabilities and increasing the maneuverability of large units 
of the ground forces will be accomplished by equipping them with 
new models of infantry fighting vehicle, artillery systems, MLRS 
multiple-launch rocket systems, and third-generation ground- and 
helicopter-based antitank guided missile systems with a firing 
range of up to 5 km, which according to their characteristics 
will be considerably more effective than existing ones. 
  On the whole, an analysis of the new concept adopted in NATO 
shows that the bloc's leadership intends to conduct a radical 
reform of the ground component of the NATO Armed Forces. This 
reform, in addition to technical re-equipping of the forces with 
new armament, will ensure the alliance an optimal defense 
sufficiency. The main efforts are directed at creating small and 
highly mobile force groupings capable of reacting adequately to 
different types of threats (risk).

military sciences] 
  [Text] A U.S. armored division is a tactical large unit 
which conducts combat operations as part of an army corps 
usually on the axis of its main thrust. It may operate 
independently on isolated axes. Organizationally, during 
peacetime a U.S. armored division includes the headquarters of 
three brigades, six tank battalions, four motorized infantry 
battalions, an army aviation brigade, division artillery, an 
antiaircraft battalion, and combat and logistic support units 
and subunits. 
  As an air defense installation, an armored division is the 
sum total of small, highly mobile (tanks, armored reconnaissance 
vehicles [ARV's], infantry fighting vehicles [IFV's], armored 
personnel carriers [APC's]), area (command and control 
facilities, communications centers, artillery positions), and 
linear targets (columns of units and subunits on a march). In 
the opinion of American military experts, the main targets of 
concentrated enemy airstrikes against a division will be: 
First-echelon brigades during their advance, commitment to 
battle, and conduct of combat operations; second-echelon 
(reserve) brigades in the concentration area and during 
commitment to battle (repelling an enemy counterattack); 
artillery groupings; command and control facilities; and 
communications centers. 
  Air defense weapons are also considered priority targets of 
airstrikes. Experience of combat operations of multinational 
forces in the Persian Gulf area showed that the targets of 
airstrikes by the anti-Iraq coalition were primarily Iraq's air 
defense forces and assets, and troop and weapons command and 
control facilities. In particular, the echelon for suppression 
of Iraq's air defenses included about one-third of the combat 
aircraft of the multinational forces participating in the 
massive raid. 
  The most important installations on line of communication 
and 
on routes of advance (bridges, tunnels, mountain passes, 
crossings over water obstacles) will also be subjected to enemy 
air attack. In all, in a division's area of responsibility there 
may be 10-20 battalion-type installations, up to 100 
company-type, and about 10 various command and control 
facilities. 
  The number of small targets in an armored division may 
exceed 
900 (see below).

  [Text] The presence of a large number of objects as part of 
an 
armored division requires reliable cover against airstrikes, 
which is the main purpose of air defense. 
  A Chaparral-Vulcan air defense battalion is the standard air 
defense subunit of an armored division, the advantage of which 
is in the combination of antiaircraft artillery and 
surface-to-air missile [SAM] systems. A battalion has a 
headquarters, headquarters battery, four main batteries (two 
Chaparral SAM and two Vulcan self-propelled antiaircraft gun 
batteries). A battery includes a headquarters section, three 
platoons of self-propelled Chaparral SAM's or Vulcan 
self-propelled antiaircraft guns (four squads in each), and a 
platoon of Stinger portable SAM's (12-20 SAM's). A battalion may 
have a total of 24 Chaparral SAM's, 24 Vulcan self-propelled 
antiaircraft guns, and up to 80 Stinger portable SAM's. The 
battalion's headquarters and headquarters battery have a radar 
platoon which has eight FAAR target acquisition radars. 
  Depending on the missions to be accomplished, a division may 
receive as reinforcement an Improved Hawk SAM battalion and 
Vulcan self-propelled antiaircraft gun subunits from the army 
corps air defense brigade. Counting reinforcements, there may be 
a total of 27 Improved Hawk launchers, 24 Chaparral SAM's, 48 
Vulcan self-propelled guns, and up to 80 Stinger portable SAM's 
in the division's area of responsibility. 
  An analysis of the specifications and performance 
characteristics of a division's air defense assets shows that 
all these assets are able to successfully repel enemy airstrikes 
at extremely low, low, and middle altitudes. At the same time, 
in clear weather and during the daylight, organic air defense 
assets may fire at up to 90 airborne targets and up to 18 
targets in instrument weather conditions and at night. 
  A division's air defense is organized based on the decision 
of its commander. The commander of the antiaircraft battalion 
exercises direct supervision of the air defense, acting 
simultaneously as the division's chief of air defense. Together 
with the commanders of attached antiaircraft subunits, he draws 
up recommendations for using air defense assets and reports them 
to the division commander. In making the battle plan, the latter 
determines the missions of each air defense subunit, its place 
in the division battle formation, the maneuver during the course 
of combat, and coordination with the subunits being covered. 
  To conduct combat operations, air defense assets are 
deployed 
into a battle formation which should ensure maximum use of the 
combat capabilities of the antiaircraft systems, reliable cover 
for the most important installations, and mutual fire cover. An 
Improved Hawk battalion is located primarily in the division's 
rear area 15-20 km from the line of contact. Intervals and gaps 
between batteries can reach 20-30 km, which makes it possible to 
accomplish their mutual cover. This battalion is usually tasked 
with increasing cover for the first-echelon brigades and direct 
cover of division command and control facilities, artillery 
position areas, staging areas of the army aviation brigade, and 
the division's most important installations in the rear area. 
During the course of combat operations, battalion subunits 
relocate by echelons in order to ensure continuous cover for the 
division's forward units. A battalion may make two or three 
relocations in a 24-hour period. 
  An organic antiaircraft battalion provides cover for 
first-echelon and second-echelon (reserve) brigades, command and 
control facilities and communications centers of the division 
and brigades, march columns of troops, and important 
installations on the routes of advance. Battalion batteries are 
employed at full strength or by platoon, since the most 
effective use of their fire capabilities is achieved in this 
way. Autonomous operations by individual SAM's, self-propelled 
antiaircraft guns, and portable SAM's are not ruled out. 
  The battle formation of an antiaircraft battalion is 
structured so as to ensure reliable cover of troops from the 
most dangerous axes of operations by enemy air attack weapons. 
To this end, the positions of Chaparral SAM's are located 3-5 km 
apart, and positions of Vulcan self-propelled guns are located 
up to 1 km apart. The battalion's battle formation is usually 
disposed in depth. The fire positions of Vulcan self-propelled 
antiaircraft guns are situated 1.5 km and those of Chaparral 
SAM's are situated 5 km from the line of contact. 
  A Chaparral SAM battery relocates in such a way as to 
provide 
cover for forward battalions, primarily from low and extremely 
low altitudes. Vulcan batteries usually operate jointly with the 
subunits being covered. Subunits armed with Stinger portable 
SAM's are intended for direct cover of troops and operate in the 
battle formations. One or two portable SAM crews are assigned to 
a motorized infantry (tank) company and artillery brigade for 
this. The gaps and intervals between them may be 2-3 km. During 
the course of combat operations, the portable SAM crews relocate 
behind the forward companies and are used according the plans of 
the battalion commanders in accordance with the division's 
general air defense plan. 
  The basic mission of an armored division's air defense in an 
offensive is to cover troops and objects when moving forward, 
deploying, and conducting combat operations. Objects of cover 
include first-echelon brigades conducting combat operations on 
the main axis, the division's second echelon during its 
commitment to battle and deep offensive exploitation, artillery 
at positions, command and control facilities, communications 
centers, and army aviation staging areas. The artillery 
battalion is tasked with covering troops against enemy 
airstrikes primarily from low and extremely low altitudes. 
  Up to two batteries of Vulcan self-propelled guns and one 
Chaparral SAM battery may be attached to a first-echelon brigade 
operating on the main axis. The Vulcan guns may be tasked with 
covering first-echelon subunits of brigades operating in the 
division's first echelon. The Chaparral battery is used for 
covering brigade second echelons and command posts. The 
division's combat operations control center is covered by the 
third battery of Vulcan self-propelled antiaircraft guns, and 
the division's second-echelon brigade is usually covered by one 
of the batteries of the attached Improved Hawk SAM battalion. 
The Vulcan self-propelled guns (lateral spacing between guns not 
more than 1000 meters) operate, as a rule, as part of a platoon. 
Stinger portable SAM crews are located in the battle formations 
of the battalions to be covered. 
  Organizing an armored division's air defense calls for a 
deeper alignment of battle formations of air defense assets, 
assignment of a portion of them for operations as part of cover 
troops being sent out up to 25 km (sometimes more) from the 
forward edge, and also for protecting subunits assigned to 
general security. The main efforts of the division's air defense 
assets are directed at covering the troops defending in the main 
area, reserves, command posts, communications centers, and 
installations in the rear area. In the opinion of military 
experts, the air defense of an armored division in the defense 
should ensure more reliable cover for troops and objects than in 
an offensive. 
  The command authorities of the U.S. Army devote special 
attention to organizing air defense of troops on the march, 
believing that an armored division will be subjected to intense 
pressure from an air enemy when moving up from the depth (from 
waiting or concentration areas). Vulcan self-propelled 
antiaircraft guns are a quite effective means of protecting 
advancing columns. Crews of Stinger portable SAM's are 
positioned at the head of march columns. It is recommended to 
locate Chaparral SAM positions where routes of advance pass, and 
the distances between these positions may be up to 2 km. 
  An Improved Hawk battalion uses as a reconnaissance asset a 
pulsed-radiation radar (AN/MPQ-50) for detecting air targets at 
medium and high altitudes at distances up to 100 km and a 
continuous-wave radar (AN/VPQ-48) for detecting low-flying 
targets at distances up to 60 km. A Chaparral-Vulcan battalion 
has eight radar complexes, each of which includes a FAAR radar 
with an operating range of up to 20 km and an TADDS automated 
data transmission system with a electronic plotting board as a 
terminal device. 
  The air search radars are deployed in the division's area of 
responsibility to provide antiaircraft subunits with data on the 
air enemy. 
  Control of the radars depends on the specific combat 
situation and may be as follows: 
  --Centralized on the scale of an antiaircraft division. In 
this case, the radars are deployed by the platoon commander in 
accordance with instructions of the battalion headquarters. The 
battalion commander controls the radars via radar officers of 
the battalion headquarters. 
  --Decentralized, when the radars are attached to the firing 
batteries controlling them. It is used when communications lines 
do not support centralized control. 
  --Mixed, if some of the radars are attached to the batteries 
and the rest remain under subordination of the battalion 
commander. Stinger portable SAM sections and crews are equipped 
with electronic plotting boards and receive air situation 
information from the closest radars. 
  The division commander exercises overall control of the air 
defense. At the combat operations control center there is an 
airspace monitor group made up of representatives from air 
defense assets and army aviation. It provides air situation 
information to the antiaircraft subunits. A communications and 
coordination group, which is located at the battalion command 
post, is created to organize coordination of the division's 
organic air defense assets with the Improved Hawk battalion. It 
provides warning of a possible enemy air attack, relays 
information about air targets, and determines the procedure for 
repelling an enemy airstrike. 
  Evaluating the experience of armored division operations in 
local wars and at exercises, American military experts have 
concluded that its air defense system is not reliable enough. 
Air defense assets (organic and attached) do not ensure cover of 
all the division's important objects in various types of combat 
and on the march, and a large part of the armament cannot be 
used in instrument weather conditions, as a result of which the 
combat capabilities of the air defense grouping decrease 
sharply. Control of a considerable number of portable SAM's is 
also made difficult, which decreases the effectiveness of their 
combat employment. 
  Therefore, it is planned to improve the air defense systems 
of "heavy" U.S. divisions, particularly armored divisions, by 
replacing the antiaircraft armament with more improved and 
advanced armament, creating a fundamentally new automated 
control system for division air defense that ensures control of 
all air defense weapons in a complex air situation, and 
developing new aerial reconnaissance equipment. As a result of 
replacing the Chaparral SAM with the ADATS system, the impact 
zone will expand from 7 to 8 km in range and from 4 to 5 km in 
altitude, the reaction time will be reduced, and the number of 
SAM's on a launcher will double. 
  American military experts have concluded that in connection 
with the increase in combat capabilities of aviation and 
helicopters, it is necessary to increase substantially the 
effectiveness of air defense of combined-arms large units of the 
Army. To this end, the United States has developed the FAADS 
program, which calls for creating an integrated, fundamentally 
new division air defense system based on advanced SAM's and 
developing a divisional automated air defense control system. 
Such a system, according to the designers, will be able to 
ensure effective cover of troops against enemy airstrikes from 
low and extremely low altitudes in the division's area of 
responsibility. 
  Taking into account the fact that antiaircraft battalions 
today still have obsolete radars that have insufficient 
protection against jamming and target handling capacity, the 
LASR radar is seen as an alternative. 
  This radar makes it possible to automatically detect 
helicopters at a distance of 9-12 km and low-flying aircraft at 
a distance of up to 30 km with a probability of 0.97. It can 
operate autonomously, providing target designations for 
antiaircraft systems (target designations are received at the 
fire control post of the SAM or antiaircraft artillery system 
over the data transmission line), or be connected to the 
division-level automatic air defense control system being 
created. 
  If the LASR radar is used in a local air defense system, 
processing of target data is accomplished on a priority basis, 
and namely those air defense assets are designated which can hit 
the selected target taking into account the positions of fire 
assets on the terrain. The operator can manually select for 
destruction any target he considers the most dangerous. 
  According to the rearmament plan, between 1992 and 1995 the 
forces will receive 112 of the planned LASR radars, which will 
be mounted on the chassis of a 5-ton cross-country vehicle. 
  The new division-level automatic air defense control system 
being developed under the FAADS program will make it possible to 
accomplish command and control and target allocation more 
effectively and will ensure flight safety for friendly aviation 
and coordination with the corps air defense command post. 
  The planned rearmament of antiaircraft units and subunits of 
U.S. tactical air defense, in the opinion of military experts, 
will make it possible to increase considerably the reliability 
of covering large units and also to maintain their combat 
effectiveness at the required level both on the offensive and 
defense.

  [Text] The Avenger surface-to-air missile [SAM] system was 
developed by the American firm Boeing within the framework of 
the FAADS program, which calls for creating advanced forward 
area battlefield air defense systems. 
  The basic requirement imposed on such weapons is to ensure 
reliability of covering first- and second-echelon ground forces 
groupings against airstrikes. The Avenger SAM is designed to hit 
air targets at ranges up to 5.5 km and altitudes up to 3500 
meters. It can be fired from the halt and on the move. The 
system is air-transportable: A C-130 can carry three SAM 
systems, and a C-141 can carry six. 
  The SAM system includes: A launcher with eight Stinger SAM's 
ready for firing; a 12.7-mm machinegun; optical and 
infrared-imaging target detection and tracking devices; a laser 
rangefinder; an IFF; a computer; control and indication 
elements; and communications transceivers. All elements are 
situated on a gyrostabilized platform, which is mounted on the 
chassis of a multipurpose 1.25-ton M988 Hummer cross-country 
vehicle. 
  The Stinger surface-to-air missile (launch weight of about 
10 
kg, length of 1.52 meters, and airframe diameter of 70 mm) has a 
two-stage solid-propellant engine. The first stage is a 
separating booster rocket that fires when the missile passes in 
the launch canister. 
  The second stage of the Stinger SAM is made in the canard 
aerodynamic configuration. The control surfaces and fins are 
folded and unfold after the missile leaves the launch canister. 
  To avoid injury to the operator, the second stage engine 
ignites when the SAM is approximately 9 meters from the 
launcher. The missile's maximum flight speed is 700 m/s. 
Guidance to the target is accomplished with the aid of an 
infrared homing head. Presently, Stingers are equipped with POST 
(Passive Optical Seeker Technique) homing heads that operate in 
the infrared and ultraviolet bands. As is asserted in the 
foreign press, this increases protection against natural 
interference and also in conditions of the enemy using 
countermeasures. The missile has a high-explosive warhead (1 
kg). It is detonated by an impact fuze when the missile meets 
the target or by a self-destruct signal, in the event it is 
fired at a friendly aircraft or if it misses. 
  The operator's cab contains an optical sight, an 
infrared-imaging device, and control, indication, and monitoring 
elements. The FLIR (Forward Looking Infra-Red) thermal imaging 
device ensures detection and tracking of targets at night and in 
poor visibility. 
  The Hummer motor vehicle (4x4) has a top speed of 110 km/hr 
and a range of 500 km. It is able to negotiate 31-degree 
inclines and fords 0.76 meters deep. The most important 
assemblies are protected by armor. 
  The U.S. Army began receiving the Avenger SAM systems in 
1989. A total of about 1200 of these systems are to be purchased 
for a total sum of $2.2 billion. In addition, Boeing is 
conducting negotiations on delivering 40 units to the ground 
forces of the Netherlands. 
  The results of field operation have shown that the Avenger 
SAM system has insufficient effectiveness when firing against 
low-flying and hovering helicopters, as well as against ground 
targets, as a result of interference from ground objects 
affecting the infrared guidance system of the Stinger missiles.

  [Text] The British firm Royal Ordnance has developed and 
tested the ROMANS (Rapid Operational Minefield Attack and 
Neutralization System) lightweight mineclearing linear charge, 
designed for clearing dismounted patrol lanes in antipersonnel 
minefields. In creating it, specialists were guided by the 
following basic criteria: Maximum simplicity of use, minimum 
time for activation, and the capability of one-man use. 
  The basic components of the kit are a gunpowder rocket with 
a 
very simple launching device in the form of a pin; the charge 
itself, which is a reinforced detonating cord 50 meters long 
(has SX2 plastic explosive that is insensitive to penetration by 
a bullet) with a detonating mechanism; a braking device; and the 
container. The latter contains all the kit accessories and 
supplies. The kit, including the container, weighs a total of 
8.9 kg. 
  To clear a lane in a minefield, the charge is placed at the 
edge of the minefield and the rocket motor is ignited, which 
moving over a low trajectory tows the charge to the obstacle. 
After actuation of the braking device, the charge, having 
straightened out, falls to the ground and detonates. The 
mechanical-fuze high-explosive and fragmentation antipersonnel 
mines in the immediate proximity are detonated by the blast 
wave, as a result of which a dismounted patrol lane 0.6 meters 
wide and 60 meters deep is cleared in the obstacle, over which 
it is possible for personnel to move single file. 
  The first variant of the charge, designated Mk1, was 
initiated at the obstacle by an operator using a blasting 
machine. The Mk2 variant was subsequently developed, which is 
equipped with an automatic detonating device that initiates the 
charge after it falls to the ground. 
  Presently, an experimental batch of new charges is 
undergoing 
evaluation testing in the British Army. In particular, they are 
studying the high-explosive properties of several charge 
variants having different explosive charge filling. At the same 
time, they are also being evaluated by American specialists, who 
are determining the effectiveness of the new weapon when used 
against various types and models of antipersonnel mines both 
buried and on the surface, including those laid by remote means. 
During the course of the testing, they are also clarifying the 
possibility of increasing the length of the charge, which would 
make it possible to clear lanes in obstacles of greater depth. 
  The need to equip ground forces units with light linear 
charges is caused by a number of reasons, two of which are the 
main ones: 
  --the ever-increasing danger of subunits executing a 
maneuver 
or taking up a defense encountering minefields that have been 
laid suddenly, which will require crossing in an extremely short 
period of time or abandoning the mined area; 
  --significant expansion of the scale of conducting mine 
warfare in the future, which will not make it possible any time 
to use only combat engineers to cross minefields. 
  That is precisely why it is proposed to entrust some of the 
missions associated with crossing minefields directly to 
combined-arms subunits, for which they are being equipped with 
the appropriate weapons. For infantry, light mineclearing linear 
charges are one such weapon.

  [Text] The first part of this article[.sup]1[/] is 
devoted to space research and development being conducted by 
France for military purposes. Presented below is a survey of 
military space projects of other West European countries and 
NATO. 
<H5>  Great Britain </H5>
  Great Britain has been conducting research in the field of 
military space systems since 1960. It was one of the first to 
successfully deploy a military communications system, launching 
the Skynet-1A satellite into a geostationary orbit in November 
1969. Since it was not economically feasible for Great Britain 
to create its own booster rocket, it directed its efforts toward 
launching satellites using American (Delta) and French (Ariane) 
booster rockets and also the Space Shuttle. 
  The Skynet space communications system is designed to 
support 
communications between Great Britain and states belong to the 
British Commonwealth and with British troops in the Middle and 
Far East, as well as for communications between ships of the 
Royal Navy and with shore bases. 
  Skynet was developed in close cooperation with the U.S. 
Department of Defense. The first satellites were created based 
on the American DSCS space communications system. Skynet-1A was 
put into a geostationary orbit over the Indian Ocean at a point 
of 53 degrees east longitude by an American Delta booster 
rocket. The launch of Skynet-1B was unsuccessful. 
  Skynet-1 had the shape of a cylinder 1.35 meters in 
diameter, 
was 0.8 meters tall, weighed 130 kg, and had a service life of 3 
years. The power sources (eight solar battery panels) had an 
output of 80 watts. The receiving operating band on the 
satellite was 7.976-8.005 GHz, and the transmitting operating 
band was 7.25-7.28 GHz. Signal relay was accomplished over two 
broadband with a bandwidth of 20 MHz (strategic communications) 
and 2 MHz (tactical communications with Navy ships). The traffic 
capacity of the repeaters was 22 duplex telephone communications 
channels. (They could be used in the multiple-station access 
mode with frequency-division multiplexing). The operating modes 
were telephone, telegraph, and secure communications. Signals 
were relayed via the satellite using an onboard horn-type 
antenna with a lens and flat reflector with a variable (by 90 
degrees) direction of its beam. An antenna with circular 
polarization was installed on a stabilized platform and had a 
gain factor of 18.5 dB. Almost all the electronic equipment was 
duplicated and switched by command from the earth. 
  In the second stage of development of the system, the 
British 
firm Marconi Space and the American firm Philco-Ford developed 
two Skynet-2 satellites (primary and back-up). 
  The launch of the Skynet-2A satellite, conducted in January 
1974 with the aid of a Delta booster rocket from the American 
space launch facility at Cape Canaveral, turned out to be 
unsuccessful due to a malfunction of the second stage of the 
booster rocket. 
  In November 1974, Skynet-2B was inserted close to a 
geostationary orbit (about 36,000 km) with an inclination of 2.2 
degrees and an orbital period of 1499 minutes. The satellite's 
reference point in orbit over the Indian Ocean was 48.5 degrees 
east longitude. The satellite had a diameter of 1.9 meters, a 
height of 1.98 meters, a launch weight of 430 kg, and a service 
life of 5 years. Stabilization was accomplished by rotation at a 
speed of 90 rpm. The electronic equipment and antenna system 
were situated on a stabilized platform. Two horn-type 
transceiver antennas were used for communications with ground 
stations. The transceiver equipment was the same as on previous 
satellites, but with improved characteristics. The following 
operating modes were possible: telephone, telegraph, facsimile, 
and data transmission in digital form at a rate of 2400 bps. The 
traffic handling capacity of the repeaters was 280 channels of 
telephone communications or 24 channels of data transmission. 
Multiple-station access with code- (over a wideband channel) and 
frequency-division (over a narrowband channel) multiplexing was 
supported. 
  Total costs for deployment of the Skynet-2 system, including 
the ground complex, reached $50 million. 
  On the whole, the Skynet-2 satellite was close in its basic 
specifications and performance characteristics to the DSCS-2 and 
NATO-3. This made it possible, if necessary, to relay via it 
signals from American ground stations and the NATO armed forces, 
and also to use it for communications between ground stations of 
Great Britain, the United States, and NATO. 
  By 1975, the firm Marconi Space had completed the majority 
of 
research directed at further improvement of the Skynet system 
and development of the Skynet-3 satellite. However, Great 
Britain's Ministry of Defense decided to close down this 
program, preferring to conclude an agreement with the United 
States and NATO on the use of their communications satellites. 
Further development of events showed that the capabilities of 
U.S. and NATO satellites do not satisfy Great Britain's needs. 
Therefore, in 1981, research was resumed under another program 
-- Skynet-4. British Aerospace became the chief contractor, and 
Marconi Space (later renamed Marconi Space Systems or MSS) 
became the subcontractor responsible for the onboard 
communications equipment, including the antenna system. 
  The Skynet-4 satellite (Figure 1 [not reproduced]) had a 
number of advantages compared to previous satellites: The 
capability to provide communications for ships in maritime 
theaters of military operations (including using communications 
between satellites) via communications stations (terminals) 
located primarily in Western Europe; a high degree of protection 
against electromagnetic pulse and jamming. The satellite was 
designed to provide the users services even in the event of a 
malfunction onboard the satellite. 
  Two UHF-band repeaters (primarily for communications with 
submarines), a four-channel SHF-band unit (for communications 
with ground complexes and surface ships), and one EHF-band 
channel (for conducting experiments with advanced communications 
systems at extremely high frequencies) were installed on the 
satellite. The operation of the transmitters was supported by a 
complex of antennas generating various directional patterns 
(circular, and also beams -- wide, narrow, needle-shaped). In 
addition, the satellite was equipped with equipment for 
transmitting command and telemetry data. 
  The reliability of the satellite's functioning increased due 
to stabilization along three axes and also due to the redundancy 
of most of the onboard equipment. However, this required an 
increase in the satellite's weight and an increase in power from 
the power supply. 
  In June 1986, the Skynet-4 satellite was ready for launch on 
the American Space Shuttle. However, the Challenger disaster in 
January 1986 delayed launching of the satellite 32 months, which 
was needed to decide the question of choosing a booster rocket 
and further work on the satellite itself for launch by various 
booster rockets. The first satellite of the new series, 
Skynet-4B, was put into orbit by an Ariane-4 booster rocket, and 
its operational use began on 22 February 1989. The Skynet-4A was 
launched nearly 1 year later in December 1989 from Cape 
Canaveral (USA), and the last satellite in this series, 
Skynet-4C, was launched in August 1990. 
  In the future, it is envisioned to develop two new 
satellites 
virtually the same as those presently in orbit. They are 
scheduled to be launched in 1997 and operate until the year 
2003. By this time it is planned to create a new generation of 
satellites. In February 1992, the government of Great Britain 
announced that it was allocating &pound;10 million for updating 
the 
Skynet-4 of the latest modification; details of the new program 
were not reported. It is quite likely that one of the problems 
which are planned to be resolved will be to ensure coordination 
of the next generation of Skynet satellites with the French 
Syracuse-2 system and NATO communications systems. 
  The basic specifications and performance characteristics of 
the Skynet satellites are given below.

  The Skynet-4 satellite consists of a service module and a 
communications equipment module. It is equipped with an SHF-band 
transceiving antenna and a spiral UHF-band antenna (deploys 
after satellite enters orbit). It main components are made 
primarily from honeycomb aluminum structures covered with 
plastic reinforced with carbon fiber. The communications 
equipment is powered by nickel-cadmium solar batteries. The 
temperature conditions are maintained basically by passive 
devices -- thermal-insulating materials and reflecting mirrors 
(located on the surface of the satellite) facing north to south. 
  The SHF-band communications equipment supports two-way 
communications between surface ships and shore stations. The 
UHF-band unit has two 40-watt repeaters that service one channel 
with a bandwidth of 25 kHz (for communications with submarines). 
An experimental EHF unit has also been installed for conducting 
experiments for creating advanced communications systems. 
  In 1987, British Aerospace received a contract to develop 
and 
manufacture NATO the NATO-4 satellite based on the Skynet-4. 
This is the first time satellites were developed for NATO by 
other than American firms. The technical characteristics of the 
Skynet-4 and its comparatively low cost played the main role in 
making this decision. 
  Commissioning of new satellites has expanded the 
capabilities 
for providing all branches of Great Britain's armed forces with 
communications on the strategic and tactical levels -- from 
major headquarters to individual units, ships, submarines, and 
aircraft. Communications was accomplished via transportable and 
mobile stations, including individual communications equipment 
for personnel, and also terminals on aircraft. This was achieved 
by using two UHF-band channels (space-to-earth) and four 
SHF-band channels for experimental communications. Ten countries 
participated in creating the Skynet-4 satellite. The cost of 
each satellite is &pound;70 million. 
  Control of the satellites in orbit and monitoring of their 
functioning are accomplished from the main center located at 
Oakhanger (Hampshire County). The center is capable of 
controlling several satellites. Its capabilities have been 
expanded recently by modernization of technical equipment. 
  Three types of ground stations have been developed in Great 
Britain for communications via Skynet satellites: fixed, 
transportable, and mobile ground stations. 
  The T-1 and T-2 fixed stations are equipped with antennas 
12.2 and 12.8 meters in diameter, respectively. The radiating 
power of the transmitting equipment is 20 kW. 
  The T-3 and T-4 transportable stations are located in a 
standard containing which can be transported on C-130 Hercules 
aircraft. The antenna is 6.4 meters in diameter, and the 
radiating power of the transmitting equipment is 5 kW. 
  The mobile stations are housed in a fan. There is also a 
version in the form of a module for installation in a transport 
vehicle or aircraft. The antenna diameter is 1.8 meters. All 
equipment fits in one C-130 and can also be transported in parts 
on helicopters. Deployment time for the station is 4 hours. 
  Special T-5 mobile stations are being developed for ships 
and 
aircraft with antennas 1.8 and 1.2 meters in diameter, 
respectively. They are installed on ships on a platform 
stabilized along three axes. Most ships are equipped with 
Type-50 Scot terminals, which support communications in the SHF 
band. Terminals in the SHF-band are being tested for aircraft 
(testing has been successfully completed for helicopters), and 
they are scheduled to be commissioned in the mid-1990's. 
  Terminals with antennas 1.7 meters in diameter and also with 
individual portable terminals are widely used in Great Britain's 
ground forces. 
  Most of the above-named ground stations appeared in the 
first 
phase of deployment of the Skynet space communications system. 
Later developments by Marconi Space include the Scot-1 (182 kg) 
and Scot-2 (680 kg) stations. Each has two parabolic antennas 
1.1 meters in diameter and can be installed on ship masts. By 
the start of operation of the Skynet system, nine ground 
stations were deployed, including fixed stations at Christchurch 
(Great Britain), one each in areas of the Middle and Far East, 
transportable stations on the island of Bahrain (Persian Gulf) 
and the island of Gan (Indian Ocean), and also terminals on 
ships of the Royal Navy. By the beginning of the second phase, a 
total of 17 ground stations were in operation, 8 of which are 
ship stations (Scot stations). 
  Within the framework of the extensive program for the 
development of future military communications systems, Great 
Britain's Ministry of Defense plans to create and launch using 
Ariane booster rockets small LISAT satellites (as an additional 
payload). A contract was concluded with Smith Associates to 
design this system. It is anticipated that advanced technical 
solutions will be implemented in designing the satellites. In 
particular, new materials will be used in the stabilization and 
power supply systems. 
  In the opinion of experts in Great Britain, small satellites 
can serve areas not covered by satellites in geostationary 
orbit. They are designed to accomplish tasks on the tactical 
level and are intended for 50-300 days. The capabilities of 
launching a group of small satellites by one rocket booster were 
demonstrated during the 35th launch of an Ariane, when seven 
satellites were put into orbit. 
  The Zircon Project for creating a space-based electronic 
intelligence-collection system for Great Britain appeared in the 
mid-1980's. The satellite was to have 30-meter umbrella-type 
antennas for conducting reconnaissance over the territory of the 
CIS, Eastern Europe, and the Middle East. The satellite was to 
be placed in a geostationary orbit. Its launch was to be 
accomplished under the guise of a Skynet-4 satellite. In August 
1987, the mass media reported that Great Britain had abandoned 
this project, although about &pound;70 million was spent on 
research and development in 4 years. However, there was no 
official confirmation of this either by the Ministry of Defense 
or the two proposed subcontractors. 
<H5>  Italy </H5>
  Italy ranks among the top in Western Europe in volume of 
work 
in the field of space research. The space equipment being 
created by its specialists are finding increasing application in 
the armed forces. The main efforts are directed at developing 
space systems for communications, geodesy, and navigation, 
interorbital tows for the Space Shuttle and Ariane booster 
rockets, and space-based cabling systems. 
  Space research in Italy was launched back in the early 
1960's 
when the government made the decision to develop and launch four 
satellites for study of the atmosphere jointly with NASA (United 
States). The satellites were put into orbit by an American Scout 
booster rocket. Other than the first, all were launched from the 
Italian launch platform San Marco (commissioned in 1966) in the 
Indian Ocean near the coast of Kenya. This platform became a 
convenient point of launch into equatorial orbits for Italy and 
other countries. 
  Based on this complex, the Italian firm SNIA-BPD is 
developing its own San Marco-1 booster rocket. The four-stage, 
solid-propellant Scout rocket has been chosen as the basis, in 
which existing solid-propellant boosters of the Ariane booster 
rocket and the Italian interorbital tow Iris will be used. Much 
attention is being given to creating interorbital tows. They are 
intended for inserting payloads into a stationary orbit as the 
fourth stage of an Ariane booster rocket and also in combination 
with the Shuttle. 
  Organizationally, Italy's space activities are accomplished 
within the framework of national programs, bilateral and 
multilateral agreements, and also the European Space Research 
Organization. The Italian Space Agency was formed in 1988, and 
in 1990 Italy's Joint Chiefs of Staff approved the Military 
Space Plan for the next 15 years. This plan calls for conducting 
research in the area of national space hardware for military 
use, validating requirements for such systems, creating small 
satellites, assessing the possibilities of developing a booster 
rocket for launching satellites in emergencies, and so forth. 
  Italy participates in programs of the European Space Agency 
(ESA), in particular, in the development of communications 
equipment for Intelsat-4 satellites, components for the Ariane 
booster rockets, and others. Presently, the country does not 
have its own space hardware for military use. It uses the 
NATO-3, DSCS-2, and DSCS-3 satellites to provide communications 
for its armed forces. 
  The national space program for creating the experimental 
communications satellite Italsat for supporting radio-telephone 
communications in the 20-30 GHz band and special types of 
communications and for studying wave propagation in the 40-50 
GHz band is the largest program. The Italsat satellite has six 
broadband channels (110 MHz bandwidth). The transmission speed 
over the communications channels is 147.5 megabits per second. 
Three additional broadband channels with a bandwidth of 40 MHz 
are used for commercial communications and have a transmission 
speed of 24.5 megabits per second. Access to space 
communications for the consumers is accomplished by switching 
the broadband channels. The transceiver antenna will generate 
six beams. It is planned to locate ground stations at more than 
230 regional telephone centers to increase flexibility and speed 
up the introduction of new types of services. A number of 
technical innovations (supporting digital telephone 
communications, using an antenna with a highly directional 
radiation pattern, and so forth) are being used in the system 
being created. The first Italsat satellite was put into orbit in 
1991 by an Ariane-4 booster rocket. 
  Italy is conducting intensive research in the field of space 
communications in the millimeter [EHF] waveband. The satellite 
being developed (2 x 2.2 x 2.6 meters) will be stabilized along 
three axes. The power of the onboard power supply will be 1370 
watts. The onboard repeater will support signal transmission in 
the telephone communications mode and data transmission in 
digital form at a speed of 1 gigabit per second. It provides for 
a mode of multiple-station access with time-division 
multiplexing and switching of signals onboard the satellite. The 
output power of each transmitter is 20 watts. The antenna system 
will include two transceiver antennas, each generating three 
narrow beams 0.5 degrees wide and with a maximum guidance error 
of -0.3 degrees. 
  In recent years, Italy has been expanding cooperation with 
NASA, the European Space Agency, and European and American firms 
under national and international space programs. The Italian 
firm Alenia Spazio is participating in development of the DRS 
satellite (data transmission equipment) and tethered (towed) 
satellite. The DRS is one of the most important ESA programs. 
Its approximate cost is about $1200 billion lira (5.3 billion 
francs). The system will provide integrated communications and 
data transmission in digital form. It will also help implement 
other European space programs for creating a space 
infrastructure which is to be formed by 1997 after launch (from 
1966) of jointly developed satellites. An Italian firm heads a 
group of 18 European industrial enterprises. The DRS system will 
include two satellites in a geostationary orbit. Its main users 
will be the spacecraft Hermes, the Spot-4 and Eureka satellites, 
and others. 
  The firm Selenia is developing the Sikral communications 
satellite and is also participating in other programs. 
  Within the framework of work under the Sikral (began in 
1979, 
Figure 2 [not reproduced]) it is planned to create military 
satellites to provide communications for Italy's armed forces, 
governmental agencies, and civil defense organizations. The 
system (two satellites in orbit and a back-up satellite on 
earth) is to support strategic, tactical, and emergency 
communications with the aid of fixed, transportable, and mobile 
ground stations. The space communications stations on ships, 
aircraft, and ground transport vehicle will be equipped with 
antennas 0.6-2.5 meters in diameter. It is envisioned to use the 
operating frequency of 7-8 GHz for military communications and 
12-14 GHz for communications by civil defense headquarters with 
field subunits. Europe, Africa, and the Atlantic and Indian 
oceans will be in the satellites' zone of visibility. The Sikral 
satellite (1050 kg) is stabilized along three axes. It is being 
developed based on the latest technologies and has protection 
against jamming, secure communications, and compatibility with 
NATO and U.S. (DSCS) systems and also with the Intelsat 
commercial international communications system. Control will be 
accomplished under the overall direction of the Joint Chiefs of 
Staff of Italy's armed forces. The first satellite launch is 
scheduled for 1996.[.sup]2[/] 
  Three ground stations, two fixed and one transportable, have 
already been deployed today on the country's territory for 
communications via these satellites. 
  In addition, Italy is participating in creating the Euronav 
space navigation system for military users as part of a 
consortium of West European firms specially formed for this 
purpose. 
<H5>  Spain </H5>
  Research in the field of space has been conducted in the 
country for a fairly long time. Today, Spain is creating its own 
production base for independent space research and development, 
implementing space projects, and practical use. The firms KASA, 
KRISA, and Sener are participating in the space activities. In 
addition, Spain is cooperating with a number of West European 
firms. 
  The Hispasat system is the first national space 
communications project designed to support communications for 
both civilian and military consumers. It will include three 
satellites (two operating and one back-up) and a ground control 
and monitoring center, as well as communications stations 
(consumers). The contract for this program was signed with the 
firm Ariane back in 1990. 
  The first satellite was launched in late 1992, and the 
second 
one a year and a half later. Both satellites are in a 
geostationary orbit close to one another. 
  Each satellite is equipped with 18 communications repeaters 
developed by the firm Marconi Space Systems. Two repeaters 
support communications for military consumers, three support 
governmental consumers, three support radio and television 
broadcasting, and the rest support commercial telephone 
communications. The operating zone of the satellites encompasses 
the entire territory of Spain, a large part of the Atlantic 
Ocean and South America, and part of North America. 
  Spain has built its own control and monitoring center (near 
Madrid) for controlling satellites. Training of service 
personnel for controlling the Hispasat satellites was 
accomplished by a group from the National Space Center of France 
from Toulouse (July-August 1992). 
<H5>  Germany </H5>
  Germany is one of the leading countries in Europe in volume 
of space program financing. The main efforts of scientists are 
directed at using space for scientific and civilian purposes. 
Private and governmental firms are looking for and finding ways 
of cooperation on space programs both with the United States and 
with European countries. The main research is conducted in the 
field of space communications, observation of the earth's 
surface, microgravitation, x-ray radiation, and so forth. 
  Germany began creating a national space communications 
system 
later than other countries of Europe. The DFS/Kopernikus is such 
a system, designed for supporting telephone communications in 
the 11-14 GHz band and conducting experimental work in the 20-30 
GHz band. Three broadband channels with a bandwidth of 90 MHz 
have been allocated for this. Commercial communications stations 
operate in the multiple-station mode with time-division 
multiplexing with a transmission speed of 60 megabits per 
second. The satellites are equipped with 11 repeaters. The 
operating life of the satellite is 10 years. Ground stations are 
equipped with antennas 3.5-4.5 meters in diameter. 
  On 1 July 1990, Germany used a Delta booster rocket to make 
a 
successful launch of a Rosat satellite weighing 2442 kg into an 
elliptical orbit with an inclination of 53 degrees. The onboard 
equipment supports research for detection of x-ray radiation 
from approximately 100,000 sources. 
  Germany is actively involved in many European space projects 
on a bilateral and multilateral basis. These include the 
projects Columbus, Ariane-5, Hermes, and also several general 
ones for NATO countries. 
<H5>  NATO Military Space Programs </H5>
  Development of a NATO military space communications system 
project began in 1967. It was to use two repeater satellites in 
a geostationary orbit and space communications ground stations 
-- fixed, transportable, shipborne, and mobile. Such a system 
has already been created by the present time. It has been given 
the designation SATCOM. 
  The first phase called for studying the problems of creating 
a NATO space communications system, which would put into 
operation one of the satellites (DSCS-1) launched and two mobile 
ground stations with antennas 4.9 meters in diameter. The ground 
stations were developed by the American firm Philco-Ford. One 
was located in the vicinity of Casto (Belgium) and the other 
near Naples (Italy). 
  In the second phase (1968), the NATO Council concluded a 
contract with Philco-Ford to manufacture two repeater satellites 
for the system. The first of them (NATO-1) was launched in 1970 
into a geostationary orbit at a point over the Atlantic Ocean 
(18 degrees west longitude); the second (NATO-2) was launched in 
1971 also into a geostationary orbit over the Atlantic Ocean (26 
degrees west longitude). 
  The NATO-1 and -2 satellites provided relay of secure 
telephone, telegraph, and phototelegraph transmissions, and also 
data transmission in digital form between headquarters of the 
NATO armed forces. 
  Relay of signals was accomplished over two broadband 
channels 
-- a wideband (20 MHz) and a narrowband (2 MHz) channel, which 
amounted to a total of 300 duplex telephone communications 
channels. The first broadband channel was used for 
communications with fixed ground stations; the second for 
communications with transportable ground stations having small 
antennas. Signals were received at the satellite in the 
7.975-8.025 GHz band and transmitted to the ground in the 
7.25-7.3 GHz band. A horn-type transceiver antenna, with a 
directional pattern of 22 degrees and a gain factor of 17.9 dB, 
served all ground stations. 
  Construction of the latter in the NATO bloc countries began 
simultaneously with the creation of the satellites themselves. 
Initially, the system called for deploying 12 stations with 
antennas 12.2 and 6.4 meters in diameter (traffic handling 
capacity of 12 and 3 telephone channels, respectively), as well 
as several stations on naval flagships. The ground stations were 
deployed during the period 1970-1971 at the following places: 
Oakhanger, Great Britain; Hyde, Belgium; Athens, Greece; 
Lundbakke, Denmark; Piana della Chavica, Italy; Ottawa, Canada; 
Schoonhoven, the Netherlands; Engeman, Norway; Lisbon, Portugal; 
Norfolk, USA; Ankara, Turkey; and Bonn, Germany. Of the NATO 
countries, only France, Luxembourg, and Spain did not plan do 
have such stations on their territory, but the first two 
countries will be able to use this system if necessary, having 
established cable or radio-relay communications with the closest 
ground station of another state. The control center of the NATO 
space communications system is located in the vicinity of 
Brussels, Belgium; the back-up is in Great Britain. 
  Today, 21 fixed stations and two transportable AN/TSC-54 
stations are functioning. 
  Total expenditures for deployment of the NATO space 
communications system in the second phase reached $50 million: 
$20 million for construction of ground stations; $10 million for 
manufacturing each satellite; and $10 million for putting the 
satellites in orbit. The United States assumed 30 percent of the 
total expenditures, and the other NATO countries (except France) 
assumed 70 percent. According to their technical parameters, the 
NATO-1 and -2 satellites could also be used in the Skynet and 
DSCS systems. 
  In the third phase of development of the SATCOM system, the 
task was set to provide communications for the tactical level of 
the NATO Armed Forces. In 1973, a contract was concluded with a 
division of Philco-Ford, in accordance with which it was to 
develop, manufacture, launch, and maintenance of two NATO-3 
satellites, and to prepare a third 1.5 years after launch of the 
first. It proposed using existing technologies and technical 
solutions. The DSCS satellite was taken as the basis (except for 
the antenna system, which was completely reworked). 
  The first NATO-3 satellite was launched in 1976 from Cape 
Canaveral using a Delta booster rocket. It was put into a 
geostationary orbit over the Atlantic Ocean at 18 degrees west 
longitude. The second satellite (NATO-3B) was launched in 1977 
of over the Pacific Ocean; the third (NATO-3C) was launched in 
1978. 
  The NATO-3 satellite had the shape of a cylinder 2.2 meters 
in diameter and 2.23 meters tall. The overall height with the 
antenna system was 3.1 meters. The launch weight was 720 kg (340 
kg in orbit). Its operating life is 7 years. The satellite had 
three horn-type antennas (one receiving and two transmitting) 
operating in the 7.975-8.162 GHz (receive) and 7.250-7.437 GHz 
(transmit) bands and in the multiple-station access mode with 
frequency-division multiplexing. The total traffic handling 
capacity of the onboard repeater when transmitting via the 
antenna with a narrow beam was 870 telephone channels: 550 for 
communications with fixed ground stations, 160 with mobile 
stations, and 160 with shipborne stations. When using an antenna 
with a wide directional pattern, the traffic handling capacity 
was 240 channels: 140 for communications with fixed ground 
stations, 20 with mobile stations, and 80 with shipborne 
stations. 
  The NATO-3 satellite supported relay of secure telephone, 
telegraph, and phototelegraph communications signals. 
Transmission of data in digital form was also possible. The 
total expenditures for creating the third-phase NATO space 
communications system is estimated at $340 million (in 1980 
prices). 
  In January 1991, a Delta booster rocket was used to put the 
fourth-generation NATO-4A satellite (to replace the NATO-3C) 
into orbit from Cape Canaveral. This was the first of two 
military satellites created by British Aerospace and Marconi 
Space Systems based on the Skynet-4 satellite. The program is 
under the direction of the Ministry of Defense of Great Britain. 
The new satellites are being linked to U.S. military 
communications satellites. They have onboard UHF and SHF 
communications equipment and jamming protection. Stabilization 
is along three axes. The next NATO-4B satellite is scheduled to 
be launched in 1993-1994. 
  The ERS space system is the predecessor of a future radar 
reconnaissance satellite system which is being developed on a 
multilateral basis to satisfy requirements of the countries of 
Europe (reconnaissance, monitoring observance of disarmament 
agreements, supporting emergency communications, observing the 
environment, and so forth). 
  The first ERS satellite, launched in July 1991, demonstrated 
capabilities in the area of microwave technology and receiving 
radar images. The platform from the Spot system was used in the 
design of the satellite. The payload included two basic modules: 
An active microwave module (AMI) operating with a 
multifunctional C-band (5.3 GHz) radar and an altitude-measuring 
radar. 
  The AMI module, created by the firm Alcatele Espas (France), 
includes an image recording device and a signal dispersion 
meter. It weighs 385 kg and has a maximum power consumption of 
1300 watts. The resolution of the equipment is 100x100 meters or 
30x30 meters (improvement to 30x10 meters is possible). The main 
transmitter of the AMI contains a travelling-wave amplifier and 
a directional antenna 10x1 meters. The antenna's emitter covers 
an area on earth 100 km wide. 
  The ERS system has a number of shortcomings: The AMI module 
can operate only for 10 minutes to prevent malfunctioning of the 
TWTA frequency amplifier; the view of the earth is limited by 
the number of ground stations receiving the image on a real-time 
basis; there is no image recording equipment onboard the 
satellite and data cannot be transmitted via another satellite; 
the zone of access to the satellite is not optimized, and the 
directional pattern of the antenna is fixed and does not change; 
the process of processing images at the ground stations is 
fairly lengthy. 
  Today, the joint efforts of West European countries are 
concentrated on research associated with creating a new 
generation of military satellites. The military departments of 
Great Britain and France concluded an agreement on developing 
the EUMILSAT European satellite, expenditures for which are 
estimated at $1.2-1.38 billion (not counting the cost of ground 
complex equipment, which each country will acquire 
independently). The FRG, Italy, Spain, and the Netherlands are 
also involved in the work. Four independent national space 
programs are the base for this system: Skynet-4, Syracuse-2, 
Sikral, and Hispasat. This will make it possible to unite the 
efforts of the leading countries of Europe in the area of space 
communications and also stimulate their further work. 
  The European Space Agency is participating in development of 
the Artemis satellite (previously called Sat-2), which is 
scheduled to be launched in 1994. It is planned to install on it 
three experimental platforms with laser communications 
equipment, equipment for communications with low-orbit 
satellites, and L- and S-band communications equipment. The main 
contractor is Alenia Sapiro (Italy). Research is also being 
conducted in the area of creating the small Hermes spacecraft, 
as well as low-orbit satellites, which will be launched from the 
Space Shuttle or with an Ariane-4 booster rocket. 
  The NATO consultative group is working to determine the 
composition of technical means for monitoring observance of the 
agreement on limiting conventional armed forces in Europe. 
According to the preliminary assessment, space systems for 
accomplishing such tasks could be developed under the aegis of 
the West European Union. It is proposed to use as the technical 
basis the beginning created under the Helios and Skynet-4 
programs. In addition, the optical devices of British Aerospace 
may find application, making it possible to receive pictures 
with a resolution of several meters. The microwave instruments 
and other equipment necessary for creating reconnaissance space 
systems already exist. As foreign experts believe, a resolution 
of 5 meters is required to obtain images of aircraft, missile 
launchers, artillery, and other combat systems in the interests 
of monitoring agreements. 
  The ESA is also developing a multipurpose space platform 
making it possible, with the appropriate payload, to accomplish 
up to 10 different tasks. The platform may be stabilized along 
three axes and is to have two multiple-beam antennas. 
  A new working group was formed in January 1992 under the 
scientific and technical consultative body of the NATO Military 
Committee, known as AGARD, to study the capabilities of small 
and medium satellites (460 kg and less) in combat support of 
troops. The specialists of the group devote main attention to 
technical problems, the solution of which is realistic in 10-15 
years. 
  The ESA is working on creating a platform in a polar orbit 
capable of carrying a 1-ton payload with a 4-kW powerplant. 
According to the designers concept, astronauts will be delivered 
to the platform every 1-2 years by the Space Shuttle to service 
it and install new equipment. After the first visit, it is 
planned to increase the payload to two tons and the output of 
the powerplant to 7 kW. Up to 40 percent of the payload may be 
replaced during each flight. The platform may include: An 
antenna for communications with the earth via a repeater 
satellite, a removable propulsion system, heat-regulating 
equipment, solar battery panels, a synthetic-aperture radar 
antenna, a payload unit, a tethering structure, a rectangular 
truss for installing the payload, an assembly compartment, and 
an omnidirectional antenna. It is planned to put the platform 
into a circular geostationary orbit 800-850 km high with an 
inclination of 98.5 degrees. It will descend to an altitude 
accessible by the Space Shuttle for servicing. 
  The laboratory module Columbus is being developed under the 
direction of the ESA for a future space station. The project was 
proposed by the FRG and Italy, who were later joined by France 
and Great Britain. The technical requirements were agreed upon 
by the NASA and ESA directors to ensure the possibility of its 
docking with the American space station. This made it possible 
to enlist the United States in the project, who will partially 
finance the work being performed. The Columbus is nearly 
identical to the American laboratory module, but will have a 
longer service life and capability for free flight. The project 
is estimated at $2.12 billion (development of the station costs 
about $1.4 billion and equipment for it about $0.7 billion). The 
percentage participation of the countries involved is as 
follows: The FRG--38 percent; Italy--25 percent; England and 
France--15 percent each; Denmark--0.5 percent. 
  In addition to the manned module, it is planned to include 
the autonomous space platform Eureka, located in a polar orbit, 
in the Columbus complex. The launch is planned for 1993-1994. 
Subsequently, the manned laboratory module Columbus will serve 
as the basis of an autonomous European space system serviced by 
the recovering spacecraft Hermes. 
  Thus, cooperation between West European countries in the 
area 
of creating and operating military space systems reduces the 
expenditures of individual countries thanks to joint research 
and development, and also saves resources by reducing the number 
of satellites and producing a series of identical satellites. 
The EUMILSATCOM and INMILSAT space systems are considered 
promising. According to West European experts, by the year 
2001-2003 it is possible to put the first truly international 
military satellite into orbit. 
  Work in the area of space surveillance and tracking is also 
of great interest. Whereas experience of cooperation in creating 
and using the Space Data Interpretation Center is expected to be 
successful, one can expect the creation of a multilateral 
European military space surveillance system under the aegis of 
the West European Union. 
  During the next few decades in Europe it is planned to 
develop practical and efficient collective military space 
systems. In this case, one can expect the creation of a European 
Military Space Agency, which will be the result of the 
resolution of organizational questions on military space.

  [Text] Three main periods can be traced in the history of 
creating the Navy of the People's Republic of China [PRC]. They 
are distinguished by an evaluation of the role of the navy in 
the country's armed forces, the orientation of their 
organizational development, and the principles of combat 
employment. These distinctions, associated with the evolution of 
China's military doctrine, were largely the result of those 
changes that occurred in the policy of the Chinese leadership 
both within the country and in the international arena. 
  The first period, from the time the PRC was formed (1 
October 
1949) to the early 1960's, was characterized by the fact that 
with the Soviet Union's help, armed forces were actively formed 
and equipped in the country. Back in 1949, China's 
military-political leadership advanced the task of creating not 
only a powerful army but also a strong navy, capable of 
operating in coastal waters in order to prevent aggression from 
without. The lack of a corresponding economic and 
scientific-technical base, as well as experienced specialists, 
hindered accomplishing this task with its own forces. The Treaty 
on Friendship and Mutual Assistance, concluded in 1950 with the 
Soviet Union, provided a real opportunity for planned creation 
of a navy, both with use of deliveries of naval equipment and 
weapons and by creating, with the help of Soviet specialists, 
its own shipbuilding industry. (In particular, already in the 
1950's, the PRC had six major shipyards in operation, where more 
than 1200 Soviet advisers supported construction of warships and 
small surface craft). Thus, by the end of the first period, the 
foundation of a navy was laid, the nucleus of which was ships 
(up to and including destroyers) and small surface craft 
supplied primarily by the Soviet Union, as well as captured 
ships built in Japan, the United States, and other countries. 
The PRC Navy was able, as a whole, to accomplish the missions of 
protecting the coastline against invasion from the sea. 
  The second period (early 1960's to the late 1970's) in 
foreign policy was characterized by the Chinese leadership's 
departure from the course toward cooperation with socialist 
countries, which ended with the complete breaking of relations 
with them. Based on the new political tenets, the Soviet Union 
and the United States were considered among China's main 
enemies. The main efforts were directed at speeding up the 
development of ground-based nuclear missile forces. The concept 
of "people's war" was predominant in the area of military 
strategy, which considered the popular masses as a decisive 
factor of victory in war. Limiting the Navy's missions during 
this period to defense of the country's coastal areas, the 
Chinese leadership emphasized the extensive development of light 
forces and utilization of the favorable physical and 
geographical conditions for its basing and operational 
deployment. In addition, due to the "continental" nature of the 
military doctrine, it was considered sufficient to have antiship 
missiles installed on shore in order to destroy any maritime 
target. To a considerable extent, the predominance of such views 
was caused by China's limited material and technical 
capabilities. Organizational development of the Navy was 
accomplished on the scientific-technical and production base 
created in the 1950's, and the predominant tendency during that 
period of "relying on one's own forces" impeded the acquisition 
of modern technology abroad. Thus, creation of a large 
small-tonnage fleet for conducting coastal military operations 
and also shore-based missile and artillery units was the result 
of the development of China's Navy. 
  The changes in China's policy course that occurred during 
the 
third period (from the second half of the 1970's to the present) 
resulted in the need to re-examine the basic tenets of the 
country's military doctrine. The most significant work to bring 
its concepts in line with the requirements of modern warfare and 
the country's real capabilities began with the appointment of 
Deng Xiaoping to the post of chairman of the Military Council of 
the Central Committee of the Chinese Communist Party in July 
1981 and a "strategic change in the guiding ideas of 
organizational development of the armed forces."[.sup]1[/] 
  The result of the change in the views toward the role and 
importance of the Navy for safeguarding national interests 
became the abandonment of wide-scale production of obsolete 
military equipment and weapons and concentration (particularly 
during the initial period of reform) of attention on areas not 
requiring large capital investments and immediately producing a 
result. These new directions of the new phase of the Navy's 
development were building ships and creating standardized 
weapons, modernizing ships that are in service by equipping them 
with modern armament and equipment, including that purchased 
abroad, and increasing the combat capabilities of the component 
forces by improving the forms and methods of operational and 
combat training. 
  Today, a comprehensive program is being implemented for 
modernizing the Navy up to the year 2000. One of its priority 
directions, in particular, is development of forces capable of 
operating independently, far from friendly shores. 
  According to western and Chinese press data, today's Navy is 
charged with the following missions: Combating enemy naval 
forces at sea; providing support to ground forces operating on 
maritime axes; supporting an amphibious landing defense in 
cooperation with other branches of the armed forces; protecting 
sea lines of communication; conducting reconnaissance in the 
interests of the Navy; executing amphibious assault landings. 
  Organization of China's Navy. The Navy is an 
independent branch of the country's armed forces and is headed 
by a commander who simultaneously is a deputy minister of 
defense. He is responsible for the status and development of the 
Navy, organizing and conducting operational and combat training 
of staffs, large units, and units, manpower acquisition and 
ideological work with personnel, providing weapons and military 
equipment, and construction and defense of shore installations. 
The organizational structure of the Navy (Figure 1) includes the 
Main Staff, three fleets (Northern, 
Eastern, and Southern), the Sangar River Flotilla, and also the 
Coast Defense Headquarters with its subordinate districts and 
coast defense areas. The fleets include warship task forces, 
naval aviation large units, naval infantry large units, naval 
bases, arsenals, shipyards, educational institutions, and naval 
police.

  Effective Combat and Numerical Strength. According 
to Jane's Fighting Ships (1992-1993), the Navy's effective 
combat strength numbers about 400 ships, 1400 small surface 
craft, 800 aircraft, and 100 helicopters. The table below gives 
the number of warships and small surface craft, their class, and 
basic specifications and performance characteristics. Personnel 
strength is 260,000, with 28,000 in the coast defense troops, 
25,000 in naval aviation, and 6,000 in naval infantry. 
  China's Navy is divided by component forces into submarine, 
surface, and air forces, naval infantry, and coast artillery. 
  Submarine Forces. The PRC ranks third in the world 
in numbers of submarines and is one of five countries possessing 
nuclear-powered submarines with ballistic missiles. The Chines 
leadership considers the submarine fleet to be the advance guard 
of defense from the sea and also an auxiliary means of 
delivering a nuclear missile strike. 
  Construction of diesel-electric submarines at Chinese 
shipyards under Soviet projects 613 and 633 (Whiskey and Romeo 
class, respectively, according to NATO classification) began in 
the mid-1950's. Creation of the series of the first project (21 
submarines) was halted in 1964, while submarines of the second 
project were built until the mid-1980's. According to Western 
press data, a total of 106 Romeo-class submarines were built; 
however, taking into account those sold to other countries, the 
PRC Navy has about 80 of them today. 
  China built its own diesel-electric submarine in the 1970's, 
given the designation Ming; however, it did not begin series 
production until the second half of the 1980's. These submarines 
are similar in characteristics to the Project 633 (Romeo class) 
submarines, have the same armament, and are distinguished by a 
somewhat greater displacement. Presently, the effective combat 
strength includes eight of these submarines, and construction of 
this series continues. 
  Work is also being conducted to create submarines equipped 
with antiship missiles. To this end, one of the Romeo-class 
submarines was modernized (designated Wuhan), on which they 
installed launchers (outside the pressure hull) for Yinji 
antiship missiles (firing range up to 40 km, flight speed M=0.9, 
warhead weight 165 kg, and radar homing head). Despite the 
successful completion of testing back in 1986, series production 
of these submarines was not begun. 
  One of the most important directions of development of the 
Chinese Navy is the construction of nuclear-powered submarines. 
After commissioning two Han-class nuclear-powered submarines in 
the late 1970's, which, experts believe, served as the base for 
working out design solutions and operating principle of nuclear 
reactors in order to create nuclear-powered ballistic-missile 
submarines [SSBN], it was resumed only in the mid-1980's. Today, 
there are five Han-class nuclear-powered submarines in the 
Chinese Navy. The last three submarines, whose length is 8 
meters more than the lead submarine, are armed with Yinji 
antiship missile systems. 
  The development, construction, and commissioning of the 
first 
SSBN, given the name Xia, is considered the greatest achievement 
in Chinese shipbuilding, which marked the creation of a maritime 
component of strategic nuclear forces. It was laid at the 
shipyards in Huludao in 1978 and launched in 1981 (Figure 2 [not 
reproduced]. After extensive testing, concluding with the 
successful launch of a Jiuilang-1 ballistic missile (two-stage, 
solid-propellant, firing range 2700 km, 2-megaton nuclear single 
warhead) from the submerged position, the SSBN was put into 
service in the Navy. Earlier published forecasts about series 
production of Xia-class SSBN's have not been confirmed. 
Nevertheless, western military press reports that the PRC is 
presently developing a new SSBN which will be armed with a 
submarine-launched ballistic missile [SLBM] with a longer range 
than the Jiuilang-1. 
  Surface Forces. This component force of the Navy 
includes destroyers, frigates, minesweepers, amphibious warfare 
ships and landing craft, and also a large number of missile 
boats, torpedo boats, fire-support craft, and patrol craft. 
  Four Anshan-class ships, built in the USSR in the early 
1940's and transferred to China in 1954-1955, became the PRC 
Navy's first destroyers. Later, as a result of modernization, 
two Hayin-2 two-canister antiship missile launchers were 
installed on each of them. Today, ships of this class are in 
reserve.

  The largest surface combatants in the Chinese Navy are 
Liuida-class destroyers. Construction of this series (17 ships) 
was begun in the late 1060's under the Soviet Project 56, 
(Kotlin-class, NATO classification) and continued for more than 
20 years. Most of these ships each have two three-canister 
Hayin-2 antiship missile launchers (firing range 20 km, flight 
speed M=0.9, warhead weight 513 kg, and radar or thermal homing 
head). In 1987, one of them underwent a modernization, during 
which it was equipped with a helicopter pad and hanger. The last 
two ships of the series differ significantly in armament and 
architectonics from those built earlier. Quadruple launchers for 
Yinji mounts antiship missiles and an 8-rail Crotale SAM 
launcher (maximum firing range 13 km, SAM flight speed M=2.4, 
warhead weight 14 km), and instead of 130-mm guns, it has one 
2-gun 100-mm mount. It is possible that other ships of this 
series will undergo this re-equipping. 
  In late 1993, it is planned to commission a new destroyer, 
given the designation Liuihu. The laying of its keel took place 
at the Jiangnan shipyards in 1988, and its launch took place in 
1991. The ship is equipped with gas-turbines, has modern 
armament (four two-canister launchers for Yinji antiship 
missiles, and Crotale SAM's), and can carry two antisubmarine 
warfare [ASW] helicopters. 
  Construction of frigates (patrol escorts) in China began in 
1955 by assembling finished sections and assemblies delivered 
from the USSR. In 1958-1959, the first four Chengdu-class ships 
(Soviet Project 50, Riga-class by NATO designation) were 
commissioned into the Navy. Similar to the Anshan destroyers, in 
the early 1970's they underwent modernization (Hayin-2 antiship 
missile complexes were installed in place of the torpedo tubes). 
The next series of ships of this type (five Jiangnan-class 
ships) were built in the second half of the 1960's based on a 
previous project. Their ASW capabilities were expanded by 
placing two RBU-1200 depth-charge rocket launchers (firing range 
1200 meters, depth-charge warhead 34 kg). 
  The largest series of Jianghu-class ships of this type (27 
ships) has several modifications. Their development was helped 
considerably by the experience gained in creating Jiangnan-class 
frigates and modernizing the Chengdu-class frigates. Ships of 
the first sub-group (lead ship commissioned in 1976) have a 
total displacement of about 1700 tons and are armed with Hayin-2 
antiship missiles (two two-canister launchers), two one- and 
two-gun 100-mm mounts, six (on some four) twin 37-mm gun mounts, 
and two RBU-1200 rocket launchers. Two new modifications of 
Jianghu-class frigates, having a greater displacement (1820 and 
1920 tons) and different armament, appeared in the second half 
of the 1980's. One of the ships was equipped for basing an ASW 
helicopter, in connection with which armament located in the 
stern portion of the ship was dismantled (one antiship missile 
launcher and one 100-mm gun mount). In addition, it was equipped 
with two three-tube 324-mm torpedo tubes, and the foremost 
Chinese-made 100-mm gun mount was replaced with a French 
single-gun mount of the same caliber. Four ships had the two 
two-canister Hayin-2 antiship missile launchers replaced by four 
two-canister Yinji launchers. Several of the Jianghu-class ships 
have been built for the navies of Egypt, Bangladesh, and 
Thailand. 
  Jiangdung-class frigates (two ships), laid earlier than the 
Jianghu-class, were commissioned considerably later in 
connection with equipping them with the Hunxi-61 SAM system, 
which was mastered over a long period of time. These ships do 
not have antiship missile complexes, and their specifications 
and performance characteristics are identical to the 
Jianghu-class ships of the first modification. 
  Surface ships of this type were developed further in the new 
Jiangwei project. According to foreign press reports, three 
ships are to be commissioned already in late 1993. They have a 
somewhat greater displacement, are armed with antiship missile 
and surface-to-air missile systems, and can carry an ASW 
helicopter.

<F P=106> [Article by Pyotr Karapetyan: "Heavy Fighting at Kodori </F>
Canyon In Sixth Day, Abkhaz Detachments Take Control of 
Strategic Points"] 
  [Text] In all the conflicting reports coming out of Tbilisi 
and Sukhumi, one thing is beyond doubt: On March 25, after 
several months of relative peace, the first shots rang out in 
the Kodori canyon in the border region. 
  Blood is being spilled, and people are dying. There are dead 
and wounded among the civilians of the villages of Khucha, 
Kvemo, and Lata, and Ganakhleba has been destroyed almost 
completely. According to official sources, local battles are 
under way in Zugdidi Rayon in Western Georgia. The Abkhazians 
have taken control of the strategically important village of 
Lata. The Georgian authorities are hurriedly evacuating the 
population of Svanetia and villages adjacent to the Kodori 
canyon. 
  Unfortunately, those who predicted a new escalation of the 
Georgian-Abkhazian confrontation in spring have been proved 
correct. It is by no means accidental that the new round of 
fighting began in the Kodori canyon. 
  In terms of its importance to the Abkhazians, it can be 
compared to the Lachinsk corridor in Nagorno-Karabakh. There is 
a "humanitarian path" at Kodori, and helicopters delivering 
cargo from the republics of the North Caucasus to Abkhazia fly 
over the Kodori canyon. Significantly, their flight paths are 
out of range of air defense systems. The Georgians will 
naturally do everything in their power to block that corridor; 
by the same token, it is clear that the Abkhazians will fight 
for it to the last man. The forces that have been committed -- 
artillery, Grad launchers, and helicopter gunships -- attest to 
the seriousness of both sides' intentions. KRASNAYA ZVEZDA has 
learned that the Abkhazians have moved a regiment into the 
Kodori canyon and the adjacent area. The Georgians are opposing 
it with two divisions, not from the regular army but from the 
militarized Mkhedrioni detachments. 
  In this situation, the politicians can only concede that the 
opportunity to activate a peaceful mechanism to settle the 
conflict has been missed. Eduard Shevardnadze has said that 
recent events in Abkhazia make it perfectly clear that the 
Gudauta leadership has nothing but disdain for the peacemaking 
efforts of the UN and Russia. The counterattack on Sukhumi 
didn't end anything either. People there remember the Georgian 
parliament's well-known decision to disband the Abkhazian 
Supreme Soviet, automatically liquidating the Abkhaz delegation 
at the Geneva talks as a legal entity. As a result, the talks 
that had been set up with such difficulty were torpedoed. 
  The sides continue to claim that dialogue is still possible. 
But at the same time, to all appearances, they are preparing for 
a different course of events.
