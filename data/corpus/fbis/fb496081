Karmaza: "The Funeral March Was Accompanied by the Whine of 
Jets"] 
  [Text] Novokuznetsk-Mezhdurechensk--The story of the 
air disaster in Russia's sky is still incomplete: the "black 
boxes" found in the taiga were sent to France for 
analysis... 
  Aircraft have been falling out of the sky and are sure to 
continue doing so. This is taken for granted. What is most 
important is that crashes do not become a habit, a terrible 
tragedy or a natural everyday occurrence. 
  But this is precisely what is happening now to our civil 
aviation, which has been intimidated by everyone. Russia has 
become one of the world leaders in the number of air disasters 
taking place in the shortest period of time: 78 days--this is 
the number of days from the Tu-154 disaster over Irkutsk to the 
latest catastrophe involving the A-310 Airbus over Novokuznetsk. 
At first glance this period of time is unreal, absurd. But a 
fact remains a fact: 78 days and another 75 bodies. The figures 
are almost the same--like ordinary accounting... 
  In many respects this is a strange catastrophe. It is 
unusual, if such an expression is applicable in a tragic 
context. Everything was the wrong way around in it: 99 percent 
of all air crashes take place either during an aircraft's 
takeoff or landing. Something happened here when the aircraft 
was flying at its assigned altitude on autopilot. It had already 
flown over 3,000 kilometers and all systems were operating 
normally, without any deviations, which is confirmed by the 
recorded transmissions between the crew and the ground. 
  The airplane fell very rapidly. At the steepest possible 
angle, which seldom or almost never happens during an air 
accident. It crashed into the side of a mountain, but it 
completely cleared the tops of the trees for some reason. 
According to the first rescuers to arrive at the crash site, it 
appeared as if the Airbus had simply "flopped down" on the 
mountain. 
  All the plane's fragments were found in a relatively small 
area. They were not strewn over a radius of several hundred 
meters as they were in the Irkutsk tragedy in January, for 
example, but gathered together in a very small space. 
  The fact that the pilots did not have time to transmit 
anything to the ground is also strange. Absolutely nothing! The 
crash took place in complete radio silence. We cannot even make 
a rough guess now about what happened on board the Airbus. A 
sudden explosion? A fire? According to the driver of a log truck 
not far away, an engine was on fire and a dense black plume of 
smoke trailed after it. However, specialists investigating the 
crash were skeptical about the driver's story: the witness was 
slightly inebriated at that time. 
  Residents of the settlement of Mayzas, 8 kilometers from the 
crash site, heard a powerful explosion. But to all appearances, 
this was the explosion when the aircraft hit the ground. There 
was a large amount of fuel in the plane's tanks: I would remind 
you that the aircraft was flying to Hong Kong, and there was 
sufficient fuel on board. 
  It has now been established that there were 75 persons--63 
passengers and 12 crew members (three pilots, 8 female flight 
attendants, and one male flight attendant) on the aircraft. 
There were many foreigners--Chinese, Indian, British and French 
passengers--on board. Judging by the effects found by the 
rescuers at the crash site, the passengers were very well-to-do. 
It is sufficient to say that more than $1 million and a large 
number of precious stones and gold ornaments were found on the 
first day of work. 
  To prevent looting, the crash site was immediately cordoned 
off by the OMON [Special Purpose Militia Detachment] and 
soldiers (though for some reason, the soldiers were withdrawn 
but the OMON remained, with full gear and weapons, and were put 
on watches of 12 hours per day). There is a rather impressive 
group of people working at the site now: over 100 members of the 
rescue party, from Mezhdurechensk, Krasnoyarsk, Barnaul, and 
Moscow, and roughly the same number of inducted soldiers. The 
militia and those under their jurisdiction--zeki [prisoners] 
from the local colony--were put to work clearing away the crash 
remains. Representatives of security organs are also working 
there (judging from a conversation with them, a terakt 
[terrorist act] has not been ruled out, but in any case, certain 
details of the accident point to such a turn of events). 
  The crew of an MI-8 helicopter urgently dispatched from 
Novokuznetsk were the first to discover the burning airplane. A 
rescue party from Mezhdurechensk set out for the crash site in 
vehicles equipped for snow travel. According to their accounts, 
it was immediately clear how sad it was that there was no one to 
rescue. The crash site was shrouded in acrid smoke from burning 
plastic, seat materials, and cable. In the specialists' opinion, 
all the passengers died instantaneously. There simply could not 
have been any who survived for a short time after impact in this 
situation. 
  Because of the turn of events, I came to the crash site as 
an 
undertaker. With S. Tarasov, director of the Mezhdurechensk 
"Ritual," we transported all the coffins in the town at that 
time (at first, journalists were very strictly prohibited from 
being at the crash site, though members of the state commission 
took pity on us and authorized us to perform our professional 
duties for a brief period). Incidentally, with regard to respect 
for the remains of the casualties, the catastrophe showed that 
we are still civilized people. We carefully and neatly packed 
the body parts in polyethylene bags, then placed them in the 
coffins to take to the mortuaries in Novokuznetsk. "You do not 
give bodies to the relatives in the bags--there should be at 
least some respect," one of the commission members explained. 
  There was none of the unpleasant haste, even cynicism, which 
existed at the Irkutsk disaster site, when the arms and legs of 
the dead were thrown into polyethylene packages in an effort to 
get the remains to the city a little faster (although there were 
some excesses now, too. It was decided at first to send the 
human remains to a mortuary in nearby Mezhdurechensk and 
mortuary employees were ordered categorically to remove all the 
"extra" bodies from the institution. It reached the point of 
absurdity. As an example, the driver of our hearse-truck was 
compelled to take his dead friend out of the mortuary, wrapped 
in a blanket. There was nothing he could do but lay the body in 
the "KamAZ" [truck] and drive around every bump and rut when 
taking it to his relatives). 
  The first days after the crash the soldiers and rescue crews 
prepared a route to take out the remains of the dead and parts 
of the aircraft, as well as a pad for the helicopters. The 
aircraft had crashed 1.5 kilometers from a road which is 
traveled day and night by lumber trucks. Otherwise it would have 
been much harder to get to the crash site. The sparsely 
populated area is surrounded by volcanic peaks and taiga. 
  As terrible as it sounds, little was left of those killed in 
the Novokuznetsk disaster. The bodies were burned and charred to 
the point that they were unrecognizable. Many of the passengers 
were still strapped in their seats. The rescue party found two 
girls--the only children on this flight. Their father, one of 
the crew members, had decided to take them with him on vacation, 
to show them Hong Kong. 
  The rescue crews had to extract--and still have to 
extract--most of the bodies from a deep layer of snow--winter 
has brought a lot of snow here this year. About 60 bodies were 
found in the first 2 days. Some of them were taken in two 
"KamAZ" trucks to the Novokuznetsk mortuaries (the Airbus pilots 
were taken separately, in a special helicopter). Identification 
of the dead was begun yesterday. Although this will be a very, 
very difficult job. 
  By the end of the second day, two of the three "black boxes" 
on board the aircraft were found and sent right away to Moscow 
for analysis. A special representative of the American General 
Electric firm, which provided the engines for the A-310 Airbus, 
has arrived in Novokuznetsk. However, he responded to all my 
journalist colleagues in the same way: "No comment." And in 
his own way, he was probably right.

<F P=106> [Interview with V. Serov, deputy chief of Track Service for </F>
the Transbaykal Railroad, by V. Pakulin, GUDOK correspondent: 
"The Transsiberian Is in Danger: the Mainline's Engineering 
Structures and Roadbed Are in Urgent Need of Restoration"; 
Chita, date not given] 
  [Text] On 8 October of last year, GUDOK published an 
article by P. Lugovoy, head of the Laboratory of the Tynda Frost 
Station, "Transsib v ozhidanii rekonstruktsii" [The 
Transsiberian Awaits Rebuilding]. With facts and figures in 
hand, he convinced the readers that the Transsiberian mainline 
was seriously ill and needed radical treatment. 
  Four months passed, though, and another article on this 
subject appeared in the newspaper -- "Transsib ne bolen, on 
moguch i zhdet bolshoy raboty" [The Transsib is Not Sick, It Is 
Powerful and Awaits a Great Deal of Work], by G. Teterskiy, 
lecturer at the Irkutsk Transport Engineers Institute. Its 
author states, in particular, that "there is not and cannot be 
any question of the life and death of the supermainline. The 
Transsiberian is healthy, and possesses unused transport 
capacity. It is capable of transporting several times more than 
it does now, and ensuring high-speed movement of `East-West' 
container trains." 
  The problem is a major one. Opinion is divided, and I 
directed the attention of V. Serov, deputy chief of Track 
Service, to this matter. He is the one who well knows the state 
of the engineering structures on the mainline. 
  [Serov] The one-sidedness of the conception of technical 
policy on improving the railroad transport process shows through 
many publications and articles by scientists and directors of 
the MPS [Ministry of Railways] and railroads. Most often it is a 
question of the administrative system for transport, the 
efficiency of the locomotive and railcar operation, optimization 
of operating expenses, the capacity of the permanent way and, 
naturally, train traffic safety. 
  Beyond all these undeniably important problems, however, 
they 
seem to have forgotten the foundation of the railroad: the 
man-made structures and roadbed. Meanwhile, the proportion of 
engineering structures in the fixed capital of the roads 
constitutes from 17 to 29 percent, depending on the geographical 
and other conditions. On the Transbaykal, it is over 26 percent. 
The transport process depends directly on the state of this 
equipment. 
  It is like a truism. Most unfortunately, however, the 
engineering structures and roadbed, as before, are regarded as 
simply part of the track equipment. 
  Suffice to say that, by some strange coincidence, there is 
no 
mention of the engineering structures of the track installations 
in the "Program for Re-Equipment and Modernization of MPS 
Railroads up to the Year 2000." 
  As for the polemics on the pages of GUDOK, I think that Petr 
Nikolayevich Lugovoy probably estimates the situation on the 
Transbaykal as one of the most vulnerable sections of the 
Transsiberian. 
  I remind you that physical wear on man-made structures and 
the roadbed here was over 60 percent, and the level of defects 
and deformations of the engineering structures -- 40 percent. 
Repair of the fixed capital is doubly overdue, but this is not 
all, the number of objects subjected to varying degrees of 
wash-out has reached 892. Of them, 328 must be completely 
rebuilt. According to the reliability indicator, train traffic 
speeds must be restricted to 5 kilometers an hour on 516 
bridges. Another thing: recent calculations of the load capacity 
of the reinforced concrete superstructures showed that 167 of 
them (on half the road) need to have speed restriction 
conditions introduced. This is where our potential failures and 
sites of possible accidents lie. 
  [Pakulin] The figures are impressive, but, after all, 
inspection of the engineering structures has not yet been 
finally completed. What are the possible results of this? 
  [Serov] Next year we will finish the inspection of four more 
track sections. Even today, though, it is clear that the 
predictions are not consoling: the road's engineering structures 
are in critical condition and are deteriorating every day. 
  Rebuilding requires 40-60 "windows," lasting from 6 to 12 
hours, every month. This creates tremendous difficulties for 
traffic organizers. 
  In general, repair of the engineering structures must not be 
regarded as just a whim of the track workers -- it is in the 
interests of the entire road. 
  [Pakulin] What are the scales of rebuilding which should 
increase the reliability of the roads with increased loads? We 
know that engineering structures were designed and built at the 
turn of the century, practically 100 years ago, and were not at 
all calculated for today's heavy trains and speeds.... 
  [Serov] Rebuilding bridges, tunnels, ducts, retaining walls 
and the roadbed on our scale and significance is more difficult 
than the automatic blocking and electrification programs 
mentioned, which we carried out in previous decades. These 
programs, however, swallowed up tremendous funds, pulled away 
from rebuilding, and in some cases, urgent work to maintain 
man-made structures in at least working condition. 
  Built back in tsarist days, they are completely obsolete. We 
must now recognize the priority significance of rebuilding 
bridges, ducts and the roadbed in the next 10-15 years. 
  Noting the serious situation of the industry and the results 
of the inspections, we determined the concept of rebuilding the 
Transbaykal. We must concentrate our main efforts on the Mogocha 
and Skovorodino divisions. The situation is very strained there. 
The Chita division also needs more attention and will be 
completely worked over, as well. 
  The approach to action on the Borzya Division is different. 
Considering the increase in freight turnover with the 
development of foreign economic relations, it is likely that 
accelerated work will have to be done there on some lines, 
sections and facilities which impose a restriction on the 
throughput capacity, and the state of which is simply the limit. 
The special feature of this division is that the Manchurian 
branch line has only one rail. There are studies on second 
tracks, but so far no funds. This problem must be solved, 
however, before the contractors leave. 
  The "maneuvers" here, in my opinion, can be like this: at 
first, in parallel with the rebuilding of existing structures -- 
construction of new engineering structures, and at the second 
stage -- laying the tracks. The Mogocha Division, however, is 
unquestionably in first place with respect to difficulty and 
importance. 
  [Pakulin] Even the general picture of the state of the 
man-made structures and the prospects for rebuilding which you 
have outlined give an idea of what major resources will have to 
be concentrated on the road.... 
  [Serov] We cannot manage this, of course, with our own 
subdivisions. Just imagine, a total of 480 people are engaged in 
the maintenance and repair of the engineering structures on the 
road. This is on the total 3,640 kilometer length of the main 
route. A special team is required for planned-preventive repair. 
  Nor is there any help from the brigades involved in 
maintaining the permanent way -- they got out of routine 
maintenance of the roadbed and other engineering structures. 
Worse than that, in capital repair, the track machine stations 
are intensifying the already serious situation of the bridges 
and the roadbed. Why? Well because they are ignoring the 
planning and technological norms, rules and instructions, and no 
one bears the responsibility for this. 
  [Pakulin] Nevertheless, the rates of repairing the 
structures 
are increasing: in 1992, as compared with 1968, they succeeded 
in increasing the work volume by a factor of six. At the expense 
of what? 
  [Serov] The subdivisions of the Transstroy Corporation 
(former Ministry of Transport Construction), with which we 
continue to cooperate, have contributed to this. Last year, 16 
construction organizations worked on the Transbaykal, and of 
them, 12 had been brought in. 
  [Pakulin] Last year, however, the plan was scarcely 
40-percent fulfilled. Of course, the unsatisfactory financing 
made it impossible for the road to do a great deal of what had 
been outlined. It seemed that the forces concentrated on capital 
repair of the engineering structures were solid. But without 
settling with the contractors for doing the work, and without 
issuing them an advance to acquire material resources, it is 
hard to count on having normal work continue. 
  [Serov] I do not agree with the assertion, that the reason 
for the cut in the rates of rebuilding lies in the road's 
insolvency. I know the situation, and not by hearsay, and I note 
that they had money. It could have been redistributed. But 
priority was given to the permanent way, because of which the 
complex of work on planned preventive repair was considerably 
overfulfilled. The Transbaykal Railroad is now "at the top of 
the list" for the road network with respect to the reliability 
level of the permanent way. 
  I could be happy for my colleagues if the foundation of the 
railroad --the engineering structures -- had not suffered 
because of the shortage of funds. The plants of the construction 
industry, having supplied the bridge structures, broke off 
relations with us because of non-payment. We owed the builders, 
the designers and the scientific institutes 11 billion rubles 
[R], counting loans, fines and indexing. The situation has 
become so exacerbated that some of the subdivisions, recruited 
for the road with such difficulty, are refusing to cooperate 
with us. Having lost the reputation of a solid partner, we may 
be deprived of them, and this will cost us dearly. 
  [Pakulin] What do you see as the way out of the situation 
that has been created? 
  [Serov] First and foremost, in purposeful dividing up of 
funds and changing priorities in favor of engineering 
structures, and on the other hand, the need to reorganize the 
administrative structure of the engineering structures has 
become urgent. This was the topic five years ago at the road's 
technical-economic council. No positive decision was reached at 
that time, though. 
  What do I have in mind? Our capital repair, having exceeded 
all the parameters, grew into rebuilding. The unusual nature of 
the situation lies above all in the fact that to carry it out we 
were forced "under the wheels." This is very difficult: there 
are no analogies in practical work, so far no normative 
documents, technological decisions or experience in organizing 
traffic in this sort of development. We cannot do without a 
change in administrative structure here. 
  Or take our department. There are six specialists in it. 
This 
is enough under normal conditions for our operations. But we not 
only have to form our own ideas (operational, technical, 
construction), we have to embody them: plan the operations work, 
keep track of the planning and financing, coordinate the actions 
of the executors, accept what has been done.... In short, 
perform the functions of the capital construction department. As 
you can see, this situation is far from a standard one. We 
discussed it at a council on complete rebuilding of the 
engineering structures, and came to the conclusion that we could 
not manage without creating a special board of directors, which 
would deal fully with operations and rebuilding. 
  [Pakulin] Nevertheless, without waiting for the board of 
directors to be set up, you are already dealing with the 
rebuilding yourself, and everything involved in it? 
  [Serov] It would, of course, have been stupid, in the 
extraordinary situation which had formed, to wait for a special 
signal for large-scale operations to begin. Procrastination is 
fraught with many unpleasant things, and the main one -- we are 
risking human lives. The opinion that one should wait for a more 
tolerable economic and financial situation, and should amass 
material resources is an erroneous opinion. The road's condition 
no longer requires just therapeutic treatment, it needs surgical 
intervention. 
  As I have been saying, the rebuilding of engineering 
structures and the roadbed -- priority work, let us call it -- 
is estimated at 10-15 years. By the end of this period, the 
second stage of rebuilding -- structures built in the 1930's -- 
will also "be done." We are also faced with fairly large 
expenses: we need new technology, new base settlements and new 
resources. We are already taking this into consideration, and in 
rebuilding one of the tracks, we are doing some preventive work, 
if not complete repair, on the adjacent track. Moreover, the 
situation will in general become catastrophic, if we break off 
at stage one. It would not appear difficult to understand one 
simple thing: by increasing expenditures for capital repair, we 
will many times reduce operating expenses, through increased 
reliability. 
  [Pakulin] Just what will it take to develop work in 
accordance with the complete rebuilding program? 
  [Serov] It will take R55-60 billion a year at today's prices 
in the next decade. But we cannot leave operations, rebuilding 
and all the construction unaccompanied by science. There is 
nothing to dream of unless we develop a construction industry 
based on full-scale work. 
  Furthermore, our subdivisions need re-equipping. The 
mechanization level of our routine maintenance and capital 
repair of engineering structures is not over 20 percent. For 
comparison: routine maintenance of the permanent way is 46.7 
percent mechanized, and capital repair, using PMS [track machine 
station] resources -- 87 percent. An inadmissible disproportion 
has formed in the economy of one service. Unless we equip the 
brigades of bridge workers and roadbed workers (including the 
subdivisions called in) with modern technical devices, we are 
faced with failing to achieve the task. 
  All this also requires expenditures. We calculated that we 
will need R1 trillion in the first ten years. 
  The last thing. There will be no rebuilding "under the 
wheels" unless, in organizing and confirming the train traffic 
schedule in the MPS, the technical condition of the engineering 
structures, the need for "windows" and single-track temporary 
rails, and the need to grant a special "window" day for the most 
labor-intensive repair work are taken into consideration. 
  In general, I feel that rebuilding the engineering 
structures 
and track installations must be given the status of a target 
program on the state level.

<F P=106> [Interview with Yuriy Sergeyevich Kuchiyev, honored captain </F>
of the Arktika, by Dmitriy Struzhentsov: "We Are Quietly Sinking 
to the Bottom: Yuriy Kuchiyev Asserts that There Is No 
Alternative to Russian Nuclear-Powered Icebreakers"; St. 
Petersburg, date not given] 
  [Text] The name of Yuriy Sergeyevich Kuchiyev is well 
known, and not just to polar explorers. In the comparatively 
recent past, almost everyone in the former Union had heard it. 
Kuchiyev was stand-by captain of the firstcomer of the domestic 
nuclear-powered icebreaker fleet, the Lenin. The first cruise in 
navigational history of a surface ship -- the nuclear-powered 
icebreaker Arktika -- in the North Pole area was made under his 
command. 
  Now the honored captain of the Arktika is no longer 
sailing, but works on shore. As before, however, he remains a 
passionate champion and staunch defender of the nuclear-powered 
fleet. And there is something to defend and to defend against. 
  We became acquainted back in the days when the 
beautiful icebreaker Arktika left on its first cruise. Quite a 
few years have passed since then. In all, Yuriy Kuchiyev sailed 
on icebreakers for more than 40 years, including more than 20 
years on ships with nuclear-powered units. 
  [Struzhentsov] How do you feel these days? -- I asked 
Kuchiyev. -- Did the decades spent on nuclear-powered ships, in 
constant proximity to nuclear reactors, have any effect on your 
health? 
  [Kuchiyev] I gave up being a captain on the bridge on the 
insistence of physicians, because of ischemic heart disease. Did 
I receive an overdose of radiation exposure during the years of 
sailing on nuclear-powered ships? No, I did not. I make so bold 
as to state: not one of the crew members of nuclear-powered 
icebreakers has contracted radiation sickness. Moreover, I am 
convinced that the sojourn in the Arctic did them all good. Even 
though the Arctic expanses are subjected to man's destructive 
influence, the ecological situation is still much better there 
than in other areas of Russia. 
  [Struzhentsov] Do you mean that during the entire time of 
your work on nuclear-powered icebreakers, there was no threat of 
radioactive emission, of radiation danger? 
  [Kuchiyev] I affirm: there was not! Localized emergency 
situations did take place, but there were no emergencies 
threatening the environment or human health. The emergency 
safety systems on our nuclear-powered ships are absolutely 
reliable. All the many years of practical work and the highly 
professional operation of the nuclear-powered ships are 
convincing proof. 
  [Struzhentsov] But this is, so to speak, your "own" opinion. 
What about the international estimate of the safety of the 
nuclear-powered icebreaker fleet? 
  [Kuchiyev] All our nuclear-powered icebreakers were built at 
yards in Leningrad and Finland, and took their own route to the 
Arctic Ocean, with a working reactor, through Danish territorial 
waters. The Danes studied the air and water in the area of the 
icebreakers very carefully, and not once did they detect the 
slightest traces of radiation. Our crew watched the Danish 
high-speed launches take samples of the water near the very 
screw propellers of the Arktika, watched helicopters circling 
above us, taking air samples. Later on we learned from the 
Danish press that neither the water nor the air caused any alarm 
among the Danish people. In addition, cruises of nuclear-powered 
icebreakers carrying foreign tourists to the North Pole have now 
become quite popular. Is this not an argument in favor of the 
safety of our nuclear-powered ships? 
  [Struzhentsov] But why, then, don't the United States and 
Canada, let us say, have any nuclear-powered icebreakers? 
  [Kuchiyev] They have no North Sea route. For the time being 
the United States does not need a powerful icebreaker fleet with 
unlimited cruising capacity just for sailing in the Canadian 
archipelago and in Arctic waters. But we simply cannot do 
without it. After all, the North Sea route is the reliable 
transport artery, without which the development and operation of 
the natural riches of the Arctic -- Russia's main economic 
reserve -- would be unthinkable. Normal operation of the North 
Sea route without a modern nuclear-powered icebreaker fleet 
would be impossible! 
  [Struzhentsov] Why is diesel-electric power inferior? 
  [Kuchiyev] First of all, with respect to fuel and water, 
ships of this class do not have sufficient cruising capacity. 
The most unpleasant thing is that they are destructive to the 
Arctic because of their oil spills. It is onerous for the crews 
to operate the diesel-electric mastodons which represent 
yesterday's icebreaker building. There is no alternative in the 
foreseeable future to the powerful nuclear-powered icebreakers 
in the Arctic, and indeed in the freezing seas of Northern 
Russia. It is a pity that many people do not accept this truth. 
We remember an incident which occurred in Magadan, the residents 
of which would not let the newest nuclear-powered LASH ship, 
Sevmorput, with cargo for the Arctic inhabitants, into the port. 
This stems from technical ignorance and, of course, the 
Chernobyl syndrome. As they say, "once burned, twice shy." 
Magadan and other remote ports of the North will not survive 
without modern nuclear-powered ships. 
  [Struzhentsov] You are not denying, though, that accidents 
have happened on nuclear-powered ships? 
  [Kuchiyev] They have. For example, on the Arktika, in the 
first navigation periods, the screws broke. We repaired them 
ourselves at sea. Difficult, divers' work, but fully within 
reach of the crew. This has nothing to do, however, with the 
power unit. With competent servicing, it will not let us down. 
As for what happened at Chernobyl -- this was first and foremost 
the result of scandalous sloppiness, which, thank God, we don't 
yet have in the fleet. Indeed, the safety systems on 
nuclear-powered ships are very sound. You must address nuclear 
power only as "Sir." In the past, our chief scientific director, 
the now late academician, Anatoliy Aleksandrov, staunchly 
defended the prestige and authority of nuclear power. He seemed 
to foresee that any misfortune that happened in nuclear power 
engineering could throw everything back that science and 
practical experience had achieved over many years. That is what 
happened at Chernobyl.... 
  [Struzhentsov] What specifically do you have in mind, in 
paying Academician Aleksandrov such a compliment? 
  [Kuchiyev] Here is a simple example for you. In order for 
the 
politburo to make a decision on the Arktika's cruise to the 
North Pole, an official certificate, signed by the minister of 
the Maritime Fleet and the president of the Academy of Sciences, 
was required. Well, Minister Guzhenko signed this paper, but 
Academician Aleksandrov abstained from signing. He explained 
that he was completely comfortable with the nuclear-powered 
unit, but he was afraid that, as had already happened, the screw 
or propeller shaft would suddenly "fly off," and this could 
spoil the expedition, and then the prestige of the 
nuclear-powered icebreaker would inevitably be damaged. After 
all, our country is not accustomed to looking for reasons: if 
something does not turn out right -- everything is bad. Of 
course, we were all lucky that the cruise, which took place 
after all, went off successfully. The straightforward 
academician was the first to send on board the Arktika a 
telegram with the frank words: "You know that I was against your 
cruise, but now I am proud of you." In actuality, he was much 
happier about the success than others were. After all, Anatoliy 
Petrovich is the person whose learning and efforts created our 
naval and peacetime nuclear-powered fleet. 
  [Struzhentsov] At that time Academician Aleksandrov had 
every 
reason for joy. But how do you think he would feel, if he were 
alive today? 
  [Kuchiyev] It is difficult even to conjecture. Something 
inexplicable is taking place. The nuclear-powered fleet, which 
has proven itself in full measure, and which has a superb base 
in Murmansk, is slowly surrendering position. The icebreaker 
Lenin, with a power complex which has served out its utility, 
but still has excellently preserved interiors, made by the 
Petersburg experts, stands idle in Murmansk. The Arctic seamen 
came forth with a proposal to convert the first nuclear-powered 
icebreaker in the world into a museum, to preserve this amazing 
creation of domestic science and technology for their 
descendants. Anatoliy Sobchak, mayor of St. Petersburg, gave the 
"okay" for perpetual mooring of the nuclear-powered ship on the 
Neva -- the birthplace of the Lenin. Things have come to a 
standstill, however: there are no funds. 
  Repair of the nuclear-powered icebreakers Arktika and Sibir 
is being held up for the same reason. The icebreaker fleet is 
not being replenished. The most modern nuclear-powered 
icebreaker, the Ural, is lying idle at the outfitting dock of 
the Baltic Shipyard. It is over 50-percent finished. It is 
already fitted out with main and auxiliary turbogenerators and a 
propeller unit, and there is a nuclear-powered unit to be 
finished. The icebreaker could go off on a voyage after two 
years of intensive work. All work on finishing construction has 
been suspended, though. The yard's director has sent telegrams 
around to the suppliers on canceling the contracts: the yard has 
no funds to finish work on the icebreaker, and the very 
expensive equipment installed finds itself threatened with ruin. 
  All this is very alarming. The decline of the North Sea 
route 
is beginning. Unless this misfortune is averted, it will be hard 
to count on the regeneration of the Russian economy, since 
unless Arctic Siberia participates in this process, the problem 
cannot be solved. 
  Finally, we have not fulfilled our duty to our ancestors, 
who 
passed down to us the baton of purposeful development of the 
Arctic. After all, the cruises of our nuclear-powered 
icebreakers to the North Pole region were made, not for the sake 
of publicity, but in the name of charting the shortest 
high-latitude routes for transit transport operations between 
the Atlantic and Pacific oceans.

<F P=106> [Article by GOLOS ARMENII correspondent Grizor Apoyan: "What </F>
Has Geydar Aliyev in His Luggage?"] 
  [Text] Moscow--However important the results of the 
negotiations between the leader of Azerbaijan and the leaders of 
the great states, his contacts with neighboring Turkey are in 
the broad historical and geopolitical aspects of particular 
significance, nonetheless. 
  Attempting to disarticulate and analyze in the stream of 
reports from Ankara, Baku, and other information centers, the 
key phrases concerning G. Aliyev's visit to Turkey, one 
succumbs, frankly speaking, to a certain confusion in connection 
with how soon the present president of Azerbaijan, who came to 
power as "Moscow's man" and who was perceived as such overseas 
(we recall the sharply negative reaction of both Turkey and 
Washington to Elchibey's ouster), has gone over to the other 
side, so to speak. 
  "Turkey is the friendly, fraternal country closest to 
Azerbaijan." "We are one people," this statesman, who in his 
speeches on his assumption of office almost never mentioned 
Turkey, increasingly emphasizing the age-old productive ties of 
Azerbaijan and Russia and, in particular, his, Geydar Aliyev's, 
outstanding role in the strengthening and development of these 
relations, now declares. 
  In order, obviously, to compensate for the undesirable 
impression that had arisen in connection with Azerbaijan's 
membership of the CIS and to emphasize the insignificance and 
"innocuousness" of this fact, G. Aliyev declared: 
"Unfortunately, certain forces are in Turkey currently spreading 
various inventions concerning Azerbaijan and its development 
along the path of independence. I, as president of Azerbaijan, 
assure you that no force can deprive our state of independence." 
  Even a certain arrogance and open disregard for the opinion 
and interests of Russia are appearing in Mr. Aliyev's tone. Here 
are some words from his interview with Turkish correspondent 
Adnan Advan. 
  Correspondent: The Friendship [words illegible], and 
Cooperation Treaty includes an article which points out that if 
one party is the victim of aggression, the other will adopt 
measures against the aggressor. What do you think, will this 
evoke a negative response from Russia? 
  G. Aliyev: If we have, indeed, appended our signatures to 
these documents, we must remain true to them. 
  The same approach has been demonstrated in purely economic 
matters affecting Russia's vital interests in the Caucasus 
region. "I have no doubt that an oil pipeline will pass through 
Turkey," G. Aliyev says, as though specially teasing, knowing 
full well that this question cannot leave Moscow indifferent. 
  The impression that Geydar Aliyev has in his old age 
embarked 
upon a dangerous playing with fire is strengthened particularly 
when you read his off-hand statement: "Let them recognize that 
the Caucasus was previously part of a great empire." Although 
this appeal applies to an equal extent to both Turkey and 
Russia, it would seem, it is easy to understand which empire he 
is talking about. 
  In Mr. Aliyev's opinion, the time has now come when we need 
to recall the bygone words of Kemal Ataturk: "The Soviet Union 
is today our friend, neighbor, and ally. We need this 
friendship. But no one can now foresee what will happen 
tomorrow. We could find ourselves broken up like the Ottomans, 
broken up like Austro-Hungary. Nations that are now held 
together by a strong hand could tomorrow be scattered. The world 
balance could change. And Turkey should know what to do in this 
case. This friend of ours is ruling our brothers, to whom we are 
bound by a common language and religion and with whom we are one 
in essence. We must be prepared to take them under our 
protection. Not silently wait for this day but be prepared for 
it." Comment would be superfluous, as they say. 
  On the other hand, G. Aliyev gave the assurance in the 
course 
of his visit to Turkey that the war (in Karabakh) could not go 
on for long. But unless this was the most artless propaganda 
move aimed at attracting potential Turkish investors in the 
economy of Azerbaijan, what kind of resolution of the Karabakh 
conflict, we would like to know, has he in mind here. After all, 
by the time of his visit it had become perfectly obvious that, 
despite the country's drastic militarization, he has not 
succeeded in achieving the promised military victory at the 
fronts--even limited, even symbolic--and the shadow of the new 
(and, perhaps, also the old) Suret Guseynov obviously prevents 
him presenting constructive proposals. Perhaps there is 
something else also. In any event, no fundamentally new features 
in Azerbaijan's quite rigid position have been observed as of 
late at all. It is appropriate to note in this connection, for 
example, that at the recent conference in Moscow, "Interethnic 
Conflicts on the Territory of Russia and Countries of the Near 
Abroad," Mr. Rizayev, ambassador of the Azerbaijan Republic in 
Russia, returning to the sources of the Karabakh conflict, 
reiterated the depressing catalogue of charges, which set the 
teeth on edge, against the notorious Armenian nationalists, the 
notorious Armenian mafia, and the notorious center, not having 
ascertained a single Azerbaijani factor here, so to speak. In 
spite of the actual facts and documents formerly confirmed by 
the Azerbaijani side itself, the ambassador of the Azerbaijan 
Republic maintained that the socioeconomic position of Armenians 
in the Nagorno-Karabakh Autonomous Oblast was higher even than 
in Armenia and Azerbaijan and that the change in the demographic 
situation in Karabakh (and, obviously, in Nakhichevan, where 
there were hardly any Armenians left long before the Karabakh 
events) was explained by the fact that the Armenians are a very 
talented people and that for this reason they yearn for space 
and big cities, where they may realize their outstanding 
capabilities. 
  What is typical here is that the Azerbaijani side never 
offers any versions of a comprehensive solution of the Karabakh 
problem, always constructing its protests entirely on 
accusations and demands for the unconditional liberation of the 
occupied territories. What kind of constructive approach is this? 
  Of course, the speech at some conference even of an official 
with the rank of ambassador of a sovereign state could 
ultimately be considered merely his personal opinion, did this 
viewpoint not correlate right down to trifling details with the 
position of Azerbaijani delegations at negotiations of all 
levels--from exclusively social through the highest political. 
  In this light we have no choice but to think that Azerbaijan 
remains a convinced supporter of a military solution of the 
conflict. This is really very disheartening because very many 
people had connected with the assumption of office in Azerbaijan 
of the quite experienced and politically astute Geydar Aliyev 
the hope that Baku would not need additional senseless 
casualties for it to finally recognize present-day realities. 
But, as we can see, youthful ardor is sometimes manifested even 
in people of a ripe old age. And at the most inappropriate 
moment, as a rule. 
  Familiarizing oneself with the words of G. Aliyev, it is 
hard 
to escape the impression that the elderly figure, who has tried 
out everything in his time, is now simply entertained by the 
mere possibility of playing near the end at "the collapse of 
great empires." Or their reconstruction, which is equally 
dangerous. And, what is most distressing, not for their 
ill-starred architects but for the unfortunate peoples rashly 
entrusting their fate to them.

<F P=106> [Report by A.Ye.: "The Loss Ratio Is One to Eleven"] </F>
  [Text] On 27 March, Prime Minister G. Bagratyan 
signed a decree on organizing and holding in the second quarter 
of 1994 a training session for reserve officers and those liable 
for call-up. This event, as well as the scheduled spring draft, 
was the topic of a conference convoked yesterday by the 
government. 
  The conference chairman, Minister of State Vazgen Sargisyan, 
divided the agenda into two parts. The first was devoted to 
measures on organizing the draft. The greater portion of the 
time was allocated for this topic; the second topic was 
combating desertions. 
  In his introductory remarks, the minister of state noted 
that 
the upcoming draft will take place in much more favorable 
circumstances than the previous one. He enumerated by name the 
heads of local administrations who have completed the plans for 
training sessions. The directness with which he made public the 
names of top rayon officials who failed in the conduct of last 
year's draft was supported by argumentation confirming the 
inadequacy of local authorities. 
  The address of military police chief V. Khorkhoruni dealt 
with the problem of draft dodging. According to him, thanks to 
the work of competent organs, more than 85 percent of deserters 
from the last draft have returned to military units. There are 
reasons to believe that this percentage will increase, and, 
conversely, the figures reflecting the scale of desertions will 
decline. 
  The most significant part of what Minister of Defense Serge 
Sarkisyan said in his address was the figures on the Armenian 
forces' losses over the period since the beginning of October of 
last year. Over this period of time, we lost 690 soldiers. 
During the same time, Azerbaijani forces' casualties amounted to 
8,000 killed, 25,000 wounded, and 1,000 missing in action. 
  Among others who addressed the conference were the Ministry 
of Defense's chief of mobilization department, Arutyunyan, 
Minister of Internal Affairs V. Siradegyan, and Yerevan City 
Council Chairman V. Khachatryan. Prime Minister Grant Bagratyan 
also had the floor. The conference wrap-up was conducted by 
Republic of Armenia's vice president, Gagik Arutyunyan.

<F P=106> [Report by Ashot Aramyan: "Not Subject to Devaluation...: </F>
The First General Meeting of Yerevan Stock Exchange Stockholders 
Held"] 
  [Text] The first general meeting of Yerevan Stock Exchange 
[YeSE] stockholders began its proceedings last Saturday by 
reading out congratulations received on the occasion of this 
event from such powerful Russian commercial structures as the 
First Voucher Fund, Alfa-Kapital, the Moscow Central Stock 
Exchange, MMM-Invest, the Moscow Interbank Foreign Currency 
Exchange, and so on. 
  Next, the YeSE president, Sedrak Sedrakyan, had the floor; 
he 
reminded the stockholders of the difficult history of setting up 
the exchange, its first steps, and outlined its near-term 
prospects. He noted with regret that of the 12 categories of 
activities, for a number of reasons the YeSE currently conducts 
only two. In addition, already for a month and a half the 
exchange has not been conducting open auctions but only 
interbank ones, whose impact on the foreign exchange market is 
not that substantial. The YeSE president noted among positive 
factors the help and understanding the exchange's activities get 
from the government and the republic's Central Bank, as well as 
from foreign embassies. 
  The YeSE ended last year with a loss of only 600 drams, that 
is, as S. Sedrakyan pointed out, "for each share we lost only 15 
dum." Let us note here that one of the important indicators of 
effectiveness of the activities of any AO [joint-stock society] 
is the ratio of expenses to the value of net assets. For 
instance, if it approaches 65-75 percent, a joint-stock society 
is near collapse. The ratio of 45-55 percent indicates that 
things are in reasonably good shape, and 30 percent indicate 
good prospects for the company. Well, this figure with respect 
to AO YeSE is.... 14.48 percent. In short, the creation of one 
of the most important market structures in the republic is 
proceeding with minimal expenditures. 
  Most importantly, over a relatively short period of time, 
the 
exchange's charter capital has been capitalized--now the money 
invested by its depositor-stockholders is not subject to 
devaluation. As to the YeSE dividend policy, unlike commercial 
structures, which immediately pay income to stockholders, it is 
aimed during this initial period at reinvesting the money into 
developing the exchange. The YeSE stock now is valued at 8,200 
drams per share, and there are more than 4,000 of them sold. 
  An interesting dialog took place recently during the YeSE 
president's trip to the United States between him and the head 
of the New York Stock Exchange. Mr. Sedrakyan, relating the 
dramatic start-up time of his offspring, said: "We are counting 
on your help; you no longer remember your past. We are your 
past." To which the head of one of the largest stock exchanges 
in the world remarked: "You are a lucky man, Mr. Sedrakyan. We 
do not know what our tomorrow is, but you do." 
  The YeSE's near-term prospects are indeed enticing. With the 
beginning of voucherization and privatization in Armenia, 3.5 
million vouchers (privatization certificates) will enter the 
republic's securities market. In accordance with the government 
list, another 100 enterprises and organizations are due to be 
converted to joint-stock holding this year, which means as a 
minimum another 100 million shares of stock. Where will it all 
flow if not to the YeSE? 
  The general meeting of stockholders approved the charter of 
the publicly held joint-stock society YeSE (by the way, by the 
year 2000 the AO will become a closely held society, as is the 
practice in the entire world). 
  Then the meeting of the exchange board elected the governing 
body of the YeSE board and reappointed Sedrak Sedrakyan as the 
exchange president.

Construction"] 
  [Text] The press center of the Republic of Armenia 
Government reports that an expanded session of the Republic of 
Armenia Government was convened on 26 March by Armenian Prime 
Minister Grant Bagratyan. Republic of Armenia Minister of 
Economics Armen Yegiazaryan presented the draft resolution on 
state orders. The draft proposes that state orders be fulfilled 
from budget funds through the acquisition and sale of goods. The 
question of provision of essential commodities to the populace 
was presented for consideration. 
  Proceeding from the difficult situation that has taken shape 
in the consumer market, the government directed the Ministry of 
Trade and Aykoop to implement measures for acquiring locally 
produced goods with the aim of selling them subsequently to the 
populace. 
  State orders for capital construction for 1994 were 
confirmed. The volume of these orders comes to 5.3 billion 
drams. In addition, the statutes were confirmed on state orders 
for construction projects by contract. 
  As of 1 April 1994, the government is suspending approved 
payments for the import of gasoline and diesel fuel for 
enterprises, organizations, and individual entrepreneurs. These 
enterprises and entrepreneurs will be liable to tax in 
accordance with existing legislation. Supplemental measures for 
providing support to servicemen who have become disabled and 
their family members were confirmed.

<F P=106> [Unattributed article: "Echo of Batman Explosion Heard on </F>
the Bosphorus"] 
  [Text] The rivalry seen with respect to routes for 
exporting the main wealth of Azerbaijan and Central Asia--oil 
and gas--to the West has acquired new overtones over the past 
two weeks. 
  As we know, the main rivalry that has developed with respect 
to laying the pipeline, which promises huge profits, is between 
Russia and Turkey. Although this issue also affects the 
interests of Armenia, Georgia, and Iran, these countries can 
only indirectly influence the selection of a plan from among 
those available. 
  The Turkish plan envisages the laying of pipeline along the 
routing Kazakhstan-Azerbaijan-Iran-Turkey, following which the 
oil will leave the Mediterranean port of Ceyhan in tankers and 
travel westward. In agreement with this routing on the whole, 
the West has expressed the desire that the pipeline pass through 
Armenia instead of Iran. This would preclude its dependence on 
the unpredictable Iran. 
  The routing proposed in the Moscow plan differs radically 
from the Turkish proposal and entails laying the pipeline from 
Kazakhstan and Azerbaijan across the Northern Caucasus to 
Novorossiysk, where tankers would transport the oil to 
designated delivery points. 
  Whereas Ankara's program seemed preferable to the West over 
the initial period, Russia's increased influence over the past 
year is presently forcing a more serious look at the 
Novorossiysk version. 
  As a counteraction to this version, Ankara is now presenting 
before diplomatic and political circles the issue of review of 
the treaties on use of the Straits, providing justification for 
this by virtue of concern over the ecological state of the 
straits in the Bosphorus and Dardanelles and Sea of Marmara, and 
over the safety of the population of Istanbul situated in the 
path of the oil tankers. 
  Ankara has already been attempting for a long time now to 
effect a review of the Montreux Convention and obtain greater 
control over the Straits. The Turkish arguments have become more 
convincing following the collision of two Cyprian tankers in the 
immediate offshore area of Istanbul, as a result of which 
significant quantities of oil spilled into the sea. Turkish 
firefighters required three days to extinguish the flames, and 
the oil has not yet completely come to the surface. 
  Turkish diplomats are trying to use this pretext in the best 
way to reinforce their demands for a review of the convention 
and for an immediate reduction in the volume of oil transported 
through the Straits. 
  Turkey's Minister of Foreign Affairs H. Cetin has already 
declared that tanker movement through the Straits will be 
reduced. This wholly contradicts the points stipulated in the 
Montreux Convention. Such a position would inflict a strong blow 
to Russia's economic and political interests, and in returning 
to its prior geopolitical space, Moscow can hardly be expected 
to tolerate a disregard for these interests on Turkey's part. 
The latter realizes this full well and, in order to avoid 
leaving Moscow out of the game, has proposed a new 
variant--initially deliver the oil out of Novorossiysk to 
Samsun, and from there to Ceyhan. This routing would allow the 
Turkish side to control the significant section of the pipeline 
that passes through its territory. During the days of the uproar 
over the accident in the Bosphorus, when the Novorossiysk 
version was threatened and chances once again appeared for the 
Baku-Ceyhan routing, explosions resounding in Batman again 
reminded everyone of the Kurdish factor--one of the main 
arguments against the Turkish alternative. This is the fourth 
such instance occurring in the southeastern region of the 
country. The first three took place along the Shrnak segment of 
the Baghdad-Ceyhan pipeline, and the damage they caused did not 
turn out to be very significant only because the pipeline has 
not been operational since the Gulf War. 
  The disruptions in Batman have turned out to be far more 
substantive. According to American sources, the damage comes to 
about $60 million. A very large-scale oil production combine, 
built in 1955, is situated near this little city, with its 
60,000 inhabitants. What occurred in Batman provides a weighty 
argument against exporting oil across Turkish territory. As a 
result, serious factors currently stand in the way of both sets 
of plans. Whereas Turkey may attempt to exert pressure in the 
Straits issue, it cannot ignore the problem with the Kurds. 
  The lack of desire and inability of Turkish leaders to 
resolve the Kurdish problem over the course of decades is once 
again threatening the country's economic progress. At one time 
terrorist acts inflicted an extremely serious blow to the 
development of tourism, which brings in tremendous revenues. But 
the obstacles that stand in the way of the Russian routing are 
surmountable. There need only be renewed discussion of the 
provisions of the Montreux Convention and a decision made. And 
so, following serious rivalry over influence in the Caucasus and 
Central Asia, as a result of which Ankara had to hang its head 
and quit the region, we now await a new and important struggle 
surrounding the question of status of the Straits.

Moscow"] 
  [Text] "I can only officially confirm that an edict on the 
creation of a Republic of Armenia Embassy in Moscow is being 
prepared by the president's staff," correspondent Arman 
Kirakosyan, first deputy minister of foreign affairs, told 
RESPUBLIKA ARMENIA in response to a request for a comment on the 
rumors circulating regarding the appointment of Yuriy Mkrtumyan 
as acting charge d'affaires in the Russian Federation. 
  According to Mr. Kirakosyan, the Republic of Armenia's 
current permanent representation in Moscow does not have a legal 
basis since it does not fall under any of the agreements signed 
between Armenia and Russia. Essentially, it is still a 
"representation of the Council of Ministers of the Armenian SSR 
under the USSR Council of Ministers." Naturally, its status has 
to be changed sooner or later. There are reasons to assume that 
the presidential edicts on the creation of a diplomatic 
representation and appointment of a Republic of Armenia charge 
d'affaires in Russia will be signed in the very near future.

the Nagorno-Karabakh Republic's Shaumyanskiy Rayon and Abkhazia. 
Fifty-seven thousand persons do not have a permanent residence 
permit. However, as V. Movsisyan, head of the state 
administration for refugee affairs, noted at a recent meeting at 
the National Academy of Sciences, although these people do not 
have citizenship or a defined status, they enjoy civil rights 
and freedom; 16,000 persons deported from Sumgait in 1988 have 
received apartments or built their own homes; 28,000 of those 
deported at a later date have a permanent residence permit; and 
35,000 persons have been given land plots and participated in 
land privatization. There are numerous objective difficulties 
inherent in this sphere, which the republic authorities are 
striving to overcome.

two hours. To the question as to whether an increase in the

<F P=106> [Government of the Republic of Armenia Press </F>
Service--ARMENPRESS report: "Egyptian Commercial Center To Be 
Set Up in Yerevan"] 
  [Text] A group of experts from the Republic of Armenia 
Ministry of Light Industry, headed by Minister Rudolf 
Teymurazyan, spent several days in the Arab Republic of Egypt. 
The purpose of the trip was to study the possibility of and 
prospects for Armenian-Egyptian cooperation. The Armenian 
delegation met with Egypt's deputy minister of foreign affairs, 
minister of industry, minister of the economy, and minister of 
foreign trade, chairman of the Egyptian parliament's permanent 
commission for economic and energy issues, members of this 
country's business circles, and bankers. 
  These meetings were in a way a continuation of the agreement 
signed between Armenia and Egypt in 1992. Questions discussed in 
the course of the meetings with Egypt's officials and members of 
business circles went beyond the boundaries of the sphere of 
light industry of both countries (cooperation in banking, trade 
agreements, etc.). 
  In the course of the visit, a protocol was signed with the 
Egyptian Ministry of Industry which elaborates in detail 
economic cooperation between the two countries. In particular, 
the Armenian side undertook an obligation to set up in Yerevan 
an Egyptian commercial center where samples of Egyptian products 
will be displayed. This will provide an opportunity for Armenian 
industrialists, trade organizations, and all businessmen to 
learn about them and discuss on the spot the possibility of 
starting up joint enterprises or simply organizing sales of 
these goods in Armenia. It is envisaged that the center, which 
will be set up with the direct participation of the Republic of 
Armenia Ministry of Light Industry, will begin operations as 
early as May. An agreement was also reached on setting up a 
similar center in Egypt where Armenia will be able to 
demonstrate its products. 
  Also discussed were issues of signing an interbank agreement 
and setting up a direct air link between Yerevan and Cairo. 
  As to the package of issues within the purview of the 
Ministry of Light Industry itself, the first steps have already 
been taken. The question of purchases of cotton in Egypt was 
discussed in detail, and an agreement reached on prices. The 
agreements have not yet been signed for purely technical 
reasons: It has not yet been determined which organization will 
be delivering raw materials from Alexandria to Yerevan. 
  "I hope that this matter will be resolved in the near 
future," said the minister. "We are planning to host a visit of 
Egyptian experts within a month, who will study the capacities 
of our spinning factories. In short, the first steps have been 
made. I am convinced that Armenian-Egyptian cooperation will 
prove mutually beneficial and has great prospects."

  [Text] As the parliament's press center has reported, the 
Republic of Armenia Supreme Council held an expanded meeting of 
the commission on issues of economic development and economic 
independence at which the results of an investigation conducted 
by its working group in the system of the Ministry of Light 
Industry were discussed. 
  In addition to commission members and experts, the working 
group included representatives of the procuracy, tax 
inspectorate, and jurists' union. The working group recorded a 
number of violations in the area of personnel policy, 
fulfillment of the 1993 social-political program, budget 
appropriations, and the use of centralized credits made 
available last year. 
  In the process of discussion it was noted in particular that 
the tasks and measures envisaged by the 1993 social-economic 
program have not been fully accomplished. The amount of credit 
emission for this sector's enterprises has not been used 
properly, and the terms of repayment and interest rates have 
been violated. 
  Having noted the need to further study the problem, the 
commission found it advisable to postpone the conclusions until 
a later date.

<F P=106> [ARMENPRESS report: "They Took Advantage of the Crisis: In </F>
the Republic of Armenia Procuracy"] 
  [Text] Taking advantage of the difficulties that have 
developed in the republic as a result of the economic crisis, a 
number of officials in a position to dispose of material values 
have abused their official position and committed grand theft of 
material values and money. The procuracy organs have 
investigated, brought charges, and handed over to the courts a 
number of criminal cases initiated in connection with 
thefts. 
  For instance, in 1993 the City of Dilizhan Procuracy checked 
the system of bread supply for the population and uncovered 
abuses that existed in this area. Taking advantage of lack of 
control in the bread supply system and accounting lapses, Lianna 
Akopyan, purchaser-shipper of the city trade administration--a 
financially liable person--submitted false trade and 
transportation invoices and forged and altered documents, 
stealing 119,766 units of bread for a total amount of 1,773,722 
rubles [R]. When on leave, L. Akopyan also managed to arrange 
for her son to formally replace her as purchaser-shipper and, 
putting together falsified documents under his signature as 
well, stole another 15,233 units of bread totalling R495,057. 
  L. Akopyan was charged under Part 4 of Article 60 and 
Article 
187 of the Republic of Armenia Criminal Code, and chief 
accountant A. Kazaryan--under Article 184 of the Republic of 
Armenia Criminal Code. In the course of the preliminary 
investigation, damages to the state in the amount of R2,268,779 
have been reimbursed. The City of Dilizhan People's Court 
sentenced L. Akopyan to a prison term, and A. Kazaryan to 
correctional labor. 
<H8>  * * * </H8>
  Using the fact that the Armmolprom Association, in order to 
ensure uninterrupted operation of facilities vitally important 
for the population in the environment of a fuel and energy 
crisis, permitted milk plants to purchase fuel for cash, the 
administration of the Akhuryansk milk plant, for the purpose of 
meeting its own fuel needs, issued from its cash reserves in 
1993 in two separate authorizations R622,462 to Gurgen 
Petrosyan, a person authorized to make purchases of liquid fuel. 
The latter appropriated the money, and in order to create the 
illusion that fuel had been purchased, filled the storage tanks 
with 8,935 liters of water. In addition, he appropriated 1,268 
liters of fuel that belonged to the plant and in order to cover 
the tracks of the crime left open the faucet of the storage 
tank, through which about [number missing] liters of gasoline 
remaining in it spilled out. 
  Petrosyan's criminal actions caused R748,000 in damage to 
the 
state. He was charged under Part 4 of Article 90 of the Republic 
of Armenia Criminal Code. In the course of preliminary 
investigation the damages to the state were completely 
reimbursed. 
<H8>  * * * </H8>
  Ostensibly with the purpose of organizing production and 
processing animal husbandry products, in 1991 Robert Avetisyan 
signed a contract with Artashat sovkhoz on leasing two 
barnyards. It transpired later that this contract provided him 
with a basis for obtaining and appropriating a bank loan. 
  An operating account for R31,000 in short-term credit was 
opened in the Artashat branch of the Republic of Armenia 
Joint-Stock Commercial Bank. The next day R. Avetisyan 
transferred this money to the Savings Bank as designated for G. 
Apikyan and E. Mkhitaryan--ostensibly in payment for cattle 
purchased from them, and received this money and appropriated 
it. In May, R. Avetisyan, under the guise of paying wages, 
received a short-term loan for R19,500 in the Artashat branch of 
Agrobank, and another R42,000 in July, ostensibly to pay for 
cattle purchased. He also appropriated this money. 
  Continuing his criminal activities, by falsifying documents 
over the period 1991-1993, R. Avetisyan received from the state 
in the form of loans and appropriated R992,132. R. Avetisyan was 
charged under Part 4 of Article 90 of the Republic of Armenia 
Criminal Code. 
  The damage to the state has been reimbursed, and R. 
Avetisyan 
has been sentenced to a long prison term by the court collegium 
for criminal matters of the Republic of Armenia Supreme Court. 
<H8>  * * * </H8>
  Charges under Part 4 of Article 90 of Republic of Armenia 
Criminal Code have been brought against Silve Agadzhanyan, 
warehouse director at the Yerevan ethyl alcohol plant. Taking 
advantage of lax plant security with respect to material goods, 
over the period July-September 1993 she stole R751,680 worth of 
acetic acid from material goods entrusted to her. The stolen 
goods were discovered and confiscated. S. Agadzhanyan's case was 
referred to the Republic of Armenia Supreme Court with a 
petition to refer it to the court.

  [Text] Speaking at a regular session of the Azerbaijan 
parliament, Speaker Rasul Guliyev reported that the Azeri 
leadership intends to appeal to Moscow with the request that 
Abdulrakhman Vezirov and Ayaz Mutalibov be handed over to 
competent republic organs. It is known that Vezirov and 
Mutalibov, at one time the top officials of the country, 
presently reside somewhere in Russia and are not advertising 
their specific location. 
  A. Mutalibov, first secretary during the waning days of 
perestroyka, is accused of effecting a state coup. By state coup 
is meant the unsuccessful attempt to return to power following 
his unlawful overthrow by the People's Front. Accusations 
directed towards his predecessor, A. Vezirov, are more serious. 
Vezirov was caught participating in the events of the end of 
January 1990, when hundreds of people perished as Soviet troops 
were brought into Baku.

  [Text] Executive authorities of the city of Baku have 
rejected a request by the parties Yurddash, Boz Gurd, and 
Movement for the Liberation of Karabakh to sanction the conduct 
of a demonstration 26 March in Azadlyg Square. 
  "I feel that the organizers of the demonstration want to 
stir 
up a great hullabaloo around our ban. But you must not forget 
that the situation in the capital is uneasy. People are 
disturbed by a multitude of problems and are on their guard. 
Conducting this demonstration right now could destabilize the 
situation still more"--the city head of executive authority 
stated.

<F P=106> [AzerTAJ report: "Measures for the Socio-Economic </F>
Development of Nakhchevan"] 
  [Text] The Cabinet of Ministers of the Azerbaijan Republic 
has passed the decree "On Urgent Measures for the Resolution of 
Problems in the Socio-Economic Development of the Nakhchevan 
Autonomous Republic." Measures considered in this decree are 
directed toward eliminating the great damage done to the economy 
of the autonomous republic as a result of the blockade of 
Nakhchevan by Armenia and improving the wellbeing of its 
population. 
  In explaining the content of the document at the press 
center 
of the Cabinet of Ministers they said to the AzerTAJ 
correspondent that a number of concrete duties were placed 
before the ministries, chief administrations, state companies 
and concerns to increase aid to Nakhchevan and define the 
timespan in which these will be achieved. 
  In the decree, special attention was given to the 
improvement 
of the energy equipment of the autonomous republic, including 
the intention to conclude a new agreement to buy 200 million 
kilowatt-hours from the Islamic Republic of Iran. There are 
concrete proposals for the construction of hydroelectric 
stations on the Baykhyr, Arpachay and Ordubad rivers, and it has 
been ordered that these be presented to the government. Urgent 
measures will be undertaken to improve the supplies of 
Nakhchevan's petroleum products and gas energy. 
  The opening of the Baku-Nakhchevan and Nakhchevan-Baku bus 
routes will make it possible to start regular passenger service 
to and from the autonomous republic. It is planned to create the 
needed conditions for passengers in border crossing zones. 
  Orders have also been given to improve the organization of 
the sale of food products produced in Nakhchevan and the supply 
of foods to the population of the autonomous republic. The 
delivery of agricultural machinery, manures and seed to the 
autonomous republic must be guaranteed. 
  Measures were defined in the decree to revive the activity 
of 
construction and construction materials industry organizations. 
The construction of brick factories in Babek and Shahbuz Rayons 
must be completed this year. It is planned to build a 
1,000-tonne refrigerated warehouse in the city of Nakhchevan. 
  Concrete orders connected with the improvement of 
communications, transportation, health, and communal services 
and the payment of salaries for the population of the autonomous 
republic have also been given.

<F P=106> [Interview with Leyla Yunusova, chairman of the Azerbaijan </F>
Society for Human Rights and Protection of the Law, by an 
AZADLYG correspondent: "`We Will Defend The Rights Of Everyone, 
No Matter What Their Political Views"] 
  [Text] As has been reported, the founding conference of the 
Society for Human Rights and Protection of the Law in Azerbaijan 
was held. Leyla Yunusova, chairman of the Azerbaijan Independent 
Democrat Party, was elected chairman of the executive committee. 
Our correspondent met with Leyla Yunusova and wanted to pose 
some questions of interest to us. 
  [Correspondent] With what goals was the new organization you 
represent established? 
  [Yunusova] Up to now, there has been no society occupied 
with 
defending the rights of citizens in Azerbaijan -- not during 
Stalinism, voluntarism, or stagnation. 
  We tried to engage ourselves in preservation of the law in 
the first stages of the democratic movement and the 
national-liberation movement. We wanted to establish in the 
initiative center of the APF [Azerbaijan People's Front] an 
organization for the rule of law, and established a relationship 
with the International Society for the Protection of the Rights 
of Man [ISPRM]. At that time, Yusif Semedoghlu, the lawyer Fuad 
Aghayev, Arzu khanym Abdullayeva, the painter Ehmed Rza and 
myself were engaged in this work. After the tragedy of January 
1990, Ferhad Zeynally, Arif Kheyrullayev, Ramiz Rzayev and 
others made an effort to establish the ISPRM once again. In 
August of that year Nadir Mehdiyev founded the Helsinki Group 
for the Protection of Rights. Finally, in August 1992 the 
Azerbaijan National Committee of the Helsinki Citizens' Assembly 
[HCA] was created. At the end of all this, all other groups, 
with the exception of the HCA, ceased activity. As for the HCA, 
its activity consisted of collecting information about our 
prisoners in Armenian captivity. Nevertheless, there were enough 
problems connected with the defense of human rights in 
Azerbaijan and, from this point of view, the establishment of a 
public legal protection structure was necessary. Coming to our 
duties, first, we have to lay the basis for a public 
legal-defense organization which is removed from any kinds of 
political interests. In the future, we hope to turn it into an 
influential, multifaceted structure which preserves close ties 
with the international legal protection movement. Our second 
duty consists of educating the population, especially those 
directly engaged in politics. 
  [Correspondent] You say that the organization will be a 
public organization and will distance itself from political 
influences. But you, yourself, and others in this organization 
are actively involved in politics. 
  [Yunusova] You are right. But every single one of us can 
defend his own political interests through the political 
organizations to which we belong. We have selected these words 
of Voltaire as our slogan in the public legal defense 
organization: "It may be that my views are not in agreement with 
yours, but I am ready to defend to the death the creation of 
conditions for everyone to explain their own views." 
  These are certainly not empty words. 
  Organization members are preparing a list of prisoners. Not 
all of the prisoners are those who are conducting the struggle 
for the establishment of one, independent, democratic Azerbaijan. 
  But, in accordance with the UN's Declaration of Human 
Rights, 
we must defend everyone's rights, and think about the political 
credo of individuals who need our defense. 
  The organization is certainly a young organization, but we 
have presented our documents to the Justice Ministry for 
registration; many people are coming to our organization, and 
this shows how many of our countrymen are turned back from the 
threshold of the structure of the state and need help and 
protection. Unfortunately, for objective reasons we are unable 
to succeed in resolving certain questions. Among our commissions 
are: a commission for freedom of speech, for the legal defense 
of citizens who have lost their jobs due to political beliefs, 
economic freedom, and a commission on science and education. The 
work of the first two commissions I mentioned is quite 
satisfactory. 
  [Correspondent] Could you speak in some detail about the 
work 
of the commission on freedom of speech? 
  [Yunusova] The organization has established ties with a 
number of international legal defense organizations. We 
regularly send information to organizations like the Committee 
for the Defense of Journalists, whose center is in the USA, and 
the Foundation for the Defense of Glasnost of events violating 
the freedom of the press in our republic and on the rights of 
journalists. 
  In November and December an effort was made to make 
political 
censorship official. The Azerbaijan Press did not publish 
opposition newspapers for two days following its subordination 
to the Office of the President. The world reacted immediately to 
this event: the USA State Department signed a declaration and, 
as we know, international legal-defense organizations made 
appeals to the republic leadership. Today, the world has 
changed; now it is impossible to sign international acts on 
human rights and trample on these rights behind an iron curtain. 
  In concrete terms, our commission has prepared a document on 
interference by political censorship in every opposition 
newspaper and a number of independent newspapers. This document, 
which is in the nature of an accounting, has made it possible 
for us to examine the dynamics of strengthening political 
censorship against certain publishers at definite times. 
  On 15 February, we will hold a "roundtable" with the 
participation of chief editors from the opposition press. It 
will be devoted to a discussion of the situation in the 
opposition press in 1994. Naturally, heads of other press organs 
can also take part in this event. 
  In March, it is expected that representatives of two legal 
defense organizations will come to our republic. It is also 
planned that representatives from Helsinki Watch will go to the 
battle zone. As for the goals of the delegations from Amnesty 
International and the Denmark chapter of Helsinki Watch, they 
are to familiarize themselves with issues of human rights of 
freedom of speech here. We have already begun to prepare the 
program for their journey.

<F P=106> [Interview with Eli Me'simov, president of the Association </F>
of Independent Economists, by the AZADLYG Economics Section: 
"`Our Goal Is To Influence The Work Of Correctly Making Economic 
Policy In The Country'"] 
  [Text] 
  [Question] Interest has grown significantly in the activity 
of the Independent Economists' Association which you head in 
connection with interviews about various problems in the 
country's economy you have given the media and prognoses you 
have made. Taking this into consideration, what can you say 
about this organization? 
  [Me'simov] The Independent Economists' Association is a 
public organization. This organization, which began its 
activities as the Independent Economists' Group in 1988, became 
active under its present name after having expanded its ranks 
following the founding conference in April 1992. 
  The basic goal of the association is to unite the efforts of 
scholars, specialists, enterprise workers and businessmen with a 
new economic concept in the name of Azerbaijan's socio-economic 
progress, coordinate their activities and direct them toward one 
goal. The organization unites not only economists, but also 
those of other specialties capable of uniting economics with 
problems in their own sectors under its aegis. In the five years 
the association has been active our specialists have prepared a 
number of scientifically-based concepts and programs 
("Azerbaijan's Concept of Economic Independence," "Program of 
Measures Taken Against the Economic Crisis in Azerbaijan," 
"Program of Azerbaijan's Economic Revival") on privatization, 
agricultural reform, the organization of social processes, 
foreign investment policy and other important economic issues, 
among them many which have been valued quite highly by foreign 
specialists. We have also participated closely in the 
preparation of legislative acts and other state programs and 
documents, and in terms of expertise. The number of association 
members, their variety of expertise and competence, has provided 
much practical advice, proposal preparation and expert opinions, 
and makes it possible to prepare alternative documentation for 
important economic problems, and short-, middle- and long-term 
prognoses. 
  [Question] After having stepped down from your post as first 
deputy Prime Minister and having revived your activity in the 
Independent Economists' Association, what directions will you 
give priority in the work of the Association? 
  [Me'simov] The major priority in the Association's work has 
been defined by the dictates of our disturbance created from the 
tension created in the economic situation of our republic as a 
consequence of the present economic policy of the government. 
Some confusion in the government's economic policy and the 
inconclusiveness and mistakes stemming from this are felt 
clearly. If the government attempts to build economic policy 
with the help of incorrectly evaluated measures, the situation 
in all sectors of the socio-economic life of the country could 
worsen in the next few months. Every organization and economist, 
no matter what the position or function in society, which 
foresees the harm these tendencies could do to our economy, 
standard of living of the population and statehood must 
understand that the responsibility falls on the present extreme 
conditions, and must direct his activities towards getting out 
of the situation which has been created. 
  Whether one emerges from the situation which has been 
created 
at maximum or minimal cost depends primarily on whether economic 
policy is correctly or incorrectly structured. The goal of 
independent economists who are always trying to be objective in 
their views and who made known their constructive relationship 
to the steps taken in the economic sector even when I held high 
positions in government structures was and is unambiguous. Our 
goal is to influence legislation and other state documents of an 
economic character by providing expertise, preparing 
alternatives, making known an objective relationship to steps 
taken by the government in the economic policy sector, and 
avoiding mistakes, as well as influencing the correct 
structuring of economic policy to the extent it depends on us 
and our abilities. In connection with this, members of the 
Association regularly inform the mass media on their views on 
economic policy and related problems. This is a very important 
question because it occurs to a person sitting within the 
government structure that he sees and knows everything, and that 
he is in control. Unfortunately, there are such things that are 
seen better from a distance. 
  The Association of Independent Economists, taking into 
consideration the direct influence of every step taken in the 
economic policy sector on the living standards of the people, 
will provide help and expertise in the preparation of drafts of 
state documents on reforms in an unbiased manner, will not 
intrigue against anyone, and its members will not declare 
beforehand that they will not take a post in the administration.

<F P=106> [TURAN report: "Order Given To State Oil Company To Expedite </F>
Talks With Western Companies"] 
  [Text] The expediting of talks between the State Oil 
Company [SOCAR] and Western oil companies on the question of the 
exploitation of oil reserves in the Caspian Sea has been ordered 
via a directive from H. Eliyev. 
  In the directive the direction of talks between the State 
Oil 
Company of the Azerbaijan Republic and the Consortium of Western 
companies was applauded. Authority was granted SOCAR for the 
preparation and signing of an agreement on the exploitation of 
the "Azeri" and "Chyrag" oil fields. 
  On Friday of last week Eliyev held a closed meeting in which 
the Prime Minister, the SOCAR leadership, and specialists in the 
petroleum industry participated. At the meeting, questions on 
the discussion of a joint project for the exploitation of the 
sea beds were examined. 
  It is known that following preparations done with Western 
oil 
companies in October 1993 talks were broken off. SOCAR made 
known the fact that the "Manafov Plan" did not coincide with 
Azerbaijan's interests. 
  In connection with this, the government issued a decree on 
granting all authority for conducting the talks to SOCAR. 
  At the last meeting, the Company presented a packet of 
proposals for improving the "Manafov Plan." No information was 
given on the details of these proposals. 
  It is hoped that differences in the basic ideas on 
exploitation and capital costs will be established. The 
contractor is trying to gain capital investment quickly; as for 
SOCAR, it is trying to gain the income stemming from the 
realization of the "Manafov Plan." 
  The signing of an agreement by foreign companies on the 
exploitation of the Caspian oil beds "Azeri" and Chyrag" is to 
be extended for three years. 
  In the opinion of experts, there is as much as three 
milliard 
barrels in the oil fields. 
  According to the conditions of the contract, Western 
companies will receive 20 percent, and Azerbaijan 80 percent of 
the income.

<F P=106> [Article by Kh. Ordukhanova: "An Invitation to Dialogue"] </F>
  [Text] A "round table" was held the other day at the 
Internal Affairs Ministry of Azerbaijan, on problems of the 
struggle with drug addiction and the drug business. Today 
BAKINSKIY RABOCHIY invites the readers' attention to the 
statements of its participants. Azerbaijan Internal Affairs 
Minister Vagif Novruzov opened the meeting: 
  In recent times an increase in drug addiction, drug business 
and the crime which thrives on that soil has been observed 
throughout the world. This has to be alarming to the government 
of any country. The UN has drawn up a Worldwide Program of 
Actions for International Cooperation in the Struggle with the 
Illegal Production and Distribution of Narcotic Substances. 
Azerbaijan too has joined in this struggle. But the narcotics 
situation in the republic has become much more complex. 
Specialists affirm that if decisive measures are not taken, 
tomorrow it may be too late. 
  There are a number of reasons for the worsening narcotics 
situation in the republic. These include the increasing 
complexity of the operational situation connected with the start 
of the economic reforms; the decline in the people's standard of 
living; and the opening of the borders, which aids the expansion 
of the scope of the drug business. And the prerequisites exist 
for the development of the drug business in the republic as 
well--practically every region has its own raw-material base, 
and the appropriate climate. The drug business is an adaptable 
one, and the dealers have begun to re-organize their operations 
to make use of such channels, and to adopt methods which they 
did not even dream of two years ago. Azerbaijan is becoming a 
trans-shipment point for the transfer of narcotics from Asia to 
Europe and the other way around. One group was arrested with 
1,387 kg of morphine. They were following the 
Afghanistan-Turkmenistan-Azerbaijan-Georgia-Turkey route and 
were arrested at the Sarpi border post on the Turkish border! At 
present, synthetic drugs are enjoying great "demand." Whereas, 
for example, a gram of hashish is enough for one cigarette, from 
one gram of morphine one can make 100 doses of solution for 
injection. One gram of trimethylphentanil makes one thousand 
doses for injection, and this drug is 5,500 times more powerful 
than morphine. 
  While starting new airlines and developing transport ties 
with foreign countries, which of course is laudable, one should, 
in my view, also develop a clear-cut system for combatting the 
penetration of drug dealers into the republic. I understand that 
the lion's share of the work falls to the MVD [Ministry of 
Internal Affairs] structure, and we are doing our job; 
nevertheless, this path is strewn with many difficulties. 
Suffice it to say that one has to work under extreme conditions, 
and that the employees in the MVD administrations do not have 
the reliable and all-encompassing social and legal protection 
which the current situation demands. 
  Chief of the Administration for Combatting Drug 
Addiction and the Drug Business, Adalyat Ibragimov: 
  The number of detected crimes in the drug business realm has 
noticeably increased. Whereas, for example, in 1992, 1,305 
crimes were registered under Articles 225, 226, 226-1, 226-2, 
226-3, 226-4, 226-5, 226-6 and 227 of the Criminal Code of the 
Azerbaijan Republic, in 1993, 1,755 criminal cases were brought 
under these same articles. Approximately 740 kg of various 
narcotic substances were confiscated from the criminals, as well 
as hundreds of kilograms of raw narcotic plant materials, 
weapons, and R10 million in counterfeit currency. Criminal 
proceedings were instituted against 13 citizens of the IRI 
[Islamic Republic of Iran], and 81 from CIS countries. 
  On 25 November 1993, IRI citizens Farzad Shafi and Mashallah 
Shafi were arrested in Baku as they were attempting to sell 850 
grams of a narcotic substance (Tiryak). 
  On 30 November 1993, other citizens of the IRI were arrested 
in Baku: Dzhafar Garakhanly Safar, who was trying to sell a 
large amount of narcotics (raw opium); and Khalili Gysymlu 
Nursret, Shekh Imampur Veli, Siyavushani Mekhti Ali, and Amir 
Guseyn Khagigat Pilavar Akhmed, who were trying to sell 685 
grams of a narcotic substance (raw opium) for R1,300,000; and so 
on. 
  Just a few days ago we completed an operation for the arrest 
of a native of Fizuli, A. Alyshev, who was in possession of 
nearly a kilogram of raw opium, the black-market price of which 
would amount to R20 million. 
  Last year 3,994 drug addicts were registered, among whom 
were 
268 women and 36 juveniles. We have carried out Operation 
"Hash-Hash-93", during which drug-enforcement agents in 26 
rayons of Azerbaijan instituted criminal proceedings on 41 
counts of growing illegal narcotics-bearing plants. 
  We are now introducing a unified automated system--a "data 
bank"--by means of which we will be able to exchange information 
and operational data about drug dealers, trans-shippers and 
other persons occupied in the drug business. The system permits 
establishing a legal mechanism for the control of joint 
operations, and to prevent the commission of crimes in this 
sphere. We are about to conduct meetings with our Turkish and 
Iranian colleagues, at which we plan to work out a mechanism for 
joint operations. 
  I must note that we meet more frequently with 
representatives 
of our neighboring states than with our colleagues from other 
law-enforcement organs and services. We do not have a single 
coordinating center in the struggle with the "white death." We 
often have to act at our own peril and risk, and do not sense 
the aid of the public. I would think that the conclusions of our 
"round table" will not allow anyone to remain indifferent to the 
inevitable fate of thousands and thousands of citizens of our 
republic. 
  Chief Physician of the Republic Narcological Clinic 
System, Azhif Abdullayev: 
  Drug addiction has not yet reached a threatening level in 
our 
republic, but medicine is already experiencing serious 
difficulties even with the number of patients we already have. 
  It is no secret that drug addiction is a serious and 
dangerous disease, to which a person subjects himself 
voluntarily. But drug addiction is also a crime, for narcotic 
substances are not freely available for sale, and the 
acquisition, use, storage and transmission to other persons 
comprise all the elements of a crime. The very worst thing is 
that the ranks of drug addiction are being filled at the expense 
of our youth. The reasons are many: curiosity, a strong desire 
for acute sensations, and the lack of complete information on 
the consequences of using narcotics. Unfortunately, certain 
young people are under the dangerous misconception that they can 
discontinue their use of drugs at any time, if they want to. But 
from the very first injection of opium or the first drag of 
hashish, a person finds himself in the trap of the "white 
death"--from which it is almost impossible to escape, and 
treatment does not always produce the expected effect. Death at 
a young age (frequently--suicide or purposeful overdose), 
psychiatric disorders, and birth defects in one's offspring--are 
a tragedy for one's relatives and dear ones; these misfortunes 
await everyone who falls to the temptation. Statistics show that 
in his short life, every drug addict draws up to six other 
people into his "circle." The experience of our narcological 
service shows that a drug addict either turns to crime, or 
suffers withdrawal symptoms, or takes an excessive dose. The 
costs of narcotics are continually increasing, and that means 
their use is growing and expanding as well. The drug business is 
a very profitable one, and of the tens of thousands of people 
crossing our borders, some are attracted to the drug business in 
order to improve their own financial situation. 
  We are particularly delinquent in taking preventive 
measures. 
In my opinion, everyone should be involved in prevention, and 
that is why I am delighted to come to today's meeting. I believe 
that propaganda plays a very useful role at any level--in 
elementary school, at the institute, and in the mass information 
media--and that it will bring the appropriate returns. 
  The time has come for physicians, jurists and social 
organizations to take action, such that every person who wants 
to "get high" would realize and understand the consequences of 
his habit, which is ruinous and fatal for both himself and for 
those around him. As a rule, it takes some time from the day he 
takes his first puff or his first needle until the day he 
becomes an addict, and during all this time he is not in a 
vacuum or in isolation. Frequently this takes place in the eyes 
of his parents, teachers or fellow-workers. 
  Hospital treatment of drug addicts is also one of the 
problems facing the republic health care system. I must report 
with bitterness that the republic lacks the materials, medicines 
and modern equipment to diagnose drug addiction. We do not even 
have the diagnostic tools or centers [diagnostikum]. In western 
countries all policemen and narcotics experts have them. With 
their help one can instantly determine the presence of narcotics 
in the body. We also lack a rehabilitation system for those who 
have undergone treatment, and as a result of remission, 
treatment does not make sense. 
  The fact of the matter is, that nearly all organizations 
involved in the prevention of this terrible disease are 
displaying amazing passivity, and are leaving everything to the 
narcotics experts and to officers of the law-enforcement organs. 
But our experience, and the experience of other countries, shows 
that treatment, and social and medical rehabilitation of those 
suffering from drug addiction, can succeed only when all the 
interested organizations take up the cause in a cooperative 
manner and work out a clear-cut system for joint actions. 
  President of the Azerbaijan International Association 
for Combatting Drug Addition and the Drug Business Kyamil 
Mamedov: 
  Our association was established by the republic Ministry of 
Internal Affairs and Ministry of Health; we work in direct 
contact with the Administration for Combatting Drug Addiction 
and the Drug Business. The association was established for 
cooperation in combatting drug addiction and the drug business, 
and for prevention of the crime spawned by drug addition. We are 
striving to do everything possible in order to carry out, 
without delay, a complex program of projects for preventing drug 
addiction, for identifying those suffering from addiction, and 
for their social rehabilitation. Adalyat Ibragimov depicted the 
narcotics situation in the republic, and, as you can see, it is 
quite alarming. The continuing analysis and forecasting of the 
situation which we are conducting with the administration, are 
not providing encouraging results. One thing is 
clear--attempting to combat the "white death" one at a time, and 
trying to prevent it through the efforts of the law enforcement 
organs and Health Ministry alone, is impossible. The combined 
efforts of the state and social organizations are required; and 
our association can, I believe, do a great deal in this plane. 
And here it is not a matter of the amount of confiscated 
narcotic substances or the number of dealers from the narcomafia 
arrested. It is important that every individual case raises an 
alarm both among those invested with power, and among the 
ordinary citizens, summoning them to decisive actions. 
  I have been working in the internal affairs system for 
thirty 
years, starting as a young officer and reaching the post of 
deputy minister of the MVD; I have supervised the criminal 
services and am accustomed to operational actions. When I agreed 
to head the association, I immediately got down to specific 
operations. We have met with the ambassadors of the USA, Great 
Britain, Israel, France, Turkey, Iran and others; and with the 
UN Representative in Azerbaijan, and presented proposals for 
cooperation in accordance with the requirements of the [UN] 
Convention. It is my great pleasure to report that all of them 
readily responded to our proposal, in spite of the short notice, 
and we have already received concrete replies from them. The 
Association has received a letter from T. Young, Great Britain's 
ambassador in Azerbaijan, in which he offered his assistance: he 
has forwarded a package containing documents from state and 
private organizations in Britain occupied with the problems of 
drug addiction. I believe that they can be a great help to us in 
our work. Why re-invent the wheel? For example, in the near 
future, based on the experience of our English colleagues, we 
will be establishing an anonymous "telephone hotline" for 
persons suffering from drug addiction and their relatives. 
Phillip Remler, a representative of the American Embassy, and 
Joseph Shepperd, an officer of the U.S. Drug Enforcement Agency 
[Departament SShA po Narkotikam], visited the Association. We 
reached agreement, that very soon specialists from the agency 
will come to Azerbaijan to conduct a cycle of classes on the 
facilities of the republic police academy, for raising the 
skills of Azerbaijanian policemen engaged in combatting drug 
addiction and the drug business. Incidentally, the 
administration and the association, together with the Azerbaijan 
Police Academy, are even now re-training their cadres. Israel's 
diplomatic mission in Azerbaijan is preparing for the departure 
of a group of republic police, medical and customs officials for 
the purpose of establishing contacts and exchange of work 
experiences. Mr. Eleizer Jotvat, ad interim Israeli Charge 
d'Affairs in Azerbaijan, informed us of this. 
  We have taken part in three international conferences on 
problems of preventing and combatting drug addiction and the 
drug business--in Belarus, Pakistan and Iran. 
  At a session of the EKO [Economic Cooperation Organization] 
Regional Planning Council in Teheran in January of this year, 
along with other questions, our proposal on establishing 
associations such as ours in all of the EKO member states was 
examined. In our view, this is a successful form of association 
for state and social organizations which are not dependent upon 
one another. Our proposal was adopted. It was decided to include 
it in the agenda of the next session of the EKO Committee on 
Combatting Drug Addiction and the Drug Business. 
  In order to attract attention and to ensure the 
participation 
of the state structures and social organizations in the struggle 
with drug addiction and the drug business, we have appealed to 
the heads of the ministries, departments and social 
organizations, on which to a considerable degree the fate of the 
solution of this problem depends. They fully appreciated our 
proposal, and gave their consent to combine efforts within the 
framework of the association. We have received replies from the 
Ministry of Education, the republic customs committee, the 
Academy of Science, the Administration of Caucasian Muslims, the 
Trade-Union Confederation, the Committee on Physical Culture and 
Sport, the Youth League, the Health and Welfare Fund, the 
"Vakinets" Association, the Childrens' Fund, the Sobriety and 
Health Societies, the "Znanie" Society, and the independent 
telecommunication company, BMTI. In their replies, they 
expressed readiness to combine efforts in combatting drug 
addiction, and offered concrete proposals. 
  Azerbaijan Republic Internal Affairs Minister Vagif 
Novruzov: 
  I approve of the idea heard at the round table on the 
necessity for multiplying our efforts in combatting drug 
addiction and the drug business. The time has come to resolve 
this question at the state level, and with the participation of 
social organizations; today we need a systemic approach to 
solution of the problems facing us. 
  Until recently it was thought that we had no problem of drug 
addiction and drug business, and owing to such a comfortable 
"perception," problems piled up, and grew like a snowdrift. And 
incidentally, drug addiction, as a social evil, has greater 
influence than any other factor on the commission of especially 
vicious crimes, undermines the social foundation, and has a 
negative effect on the nation's gene pool. The time has come to 
declare war on this terrible disease, and thereby bring about 
its defeat. 
  The National Assembly of Azerbaijan has adopted a resolution 
on joining the United Nations Convention on Combatting the 
Illegal Circulation of Narcotic Substances and Psychotropic 
Materials of 1988. The leadership has put this resolution into 
action. We are now preparing documents which meet international 
requirements, and we are seeking ways for solving questions on 
carrying out the conditions of the convention and on making use 
of the rights it has conferred on us. 
  One year ago, the republic Cabinet of Ministers adopted a 
national program for combatting drug addiction and the drug 
business. It stipulated a complex of organizational, legal, 
preventive and other measures. Unfortunately, as of this day 
neither a mechanism, nor a system, nor practical implementation 
has been worked out. 
  Suffice it to say that we are still operating on the basis 
of 
many obsolete normative acts. The National Assembly must, in the 
near future, adopt new legislative acts, and re-examine the 
status of the units carrying on the struggle with drug addiction 
and the drug business. The struggle with this evil envisions 
employing a complex of law-enforcement and preventive measures. 
The internal affairs organs, the procuracy, the customs 
committee and the Ministry of National Security are carrying out 
a defensive operation to preclude the shipment of narcotic 
substances into the republic, and the use of the country as a 
trans-shipment point. The other day our Kazakh colleagues sent 
us a draft of an intergovernmental agreement, to be signed by 
the governments of Afghanistan, Iran, Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, 
Tajikistan, Turkey, Turkmenistan, Pakistan and Uzbekistan, 
entitled "On Cooperation in the Struggle with the Unlawful 
Circulation of Narcotic Substances and Psychotropic Materials." 
They have introduced this same propsal for the examination of 
the EKO. I believe that our government will give its consent to 
concluding such an agreement. And we have introduced our own 
proposals to the republic Cabinet of Ministers. Having received 
a reply from them, we have sent our own representatives and 
experts to Kazakhstan, and we are introducing our own proposals 
and amendments; and we are preparing a document for signature at 
a high level. We intend to implement contacts of this sort with 
the countries belonging to EKO and with other countries, in the 
area of combatting drug addiction and the drug business. 
International cooperation in this area is taking place at a high 
level; however, within the republic there are still many 
unresolved problems, one of which is--the creation of a powerful 
material and financial base. 
  One could also wish for better preventive measures. We have 
no hospitals for treatment of drug addicts and no rehabilitation 
points for them; television and the press are avoiding the 
problem, and there is no counter-propaganda in the schools and 
institutes. The International Association is taking the first 
steps in uniting the state and social structures. Enough has 
been said on everything here, and I have only to introduce one 
more proposal. 
  Yes, it is impossible to combat drug addiction and the drug 
business by oneself. And I propose getting together in the near 
future, discussing our common problems, and this time adopting 
urgent measures. I express my gratitude to those ministries, 
departments, and social organizations who have readily agreed to 
combine efforts with us in this noble work, which is so 
necessary for our nation today. Today's conversation is an 
invitation to dialogue, in which not only the organizations of 
which I was speaking can take part, but also all interested 
citizens in the republic. 
  Today's meeting will become a stimulus to solution of our 
problems, and the next one--a lever, and leadership for action.

<F P=106> [Petr Kirillov article: "Through the Looking Glass -- </F>
ARGUMENTY I FAKTY Invents Arguments in Order To Do Battle More 
Successfully With the Facts"] 
  [Text] In the art of propaganda there exists a well-worn 
trick: Namely, to invent certain arguments for the opponent (or 
to change existing arguments beyond all recognition) and then to 
shower bitter, critical blows on these fabricated arguments. As 
a result, the enemy is defeated, the amazed public applauds, and 
as for the truth -- well, nobody will think to rifle through 
boring papers, checking what is written in them against the 
arguments being propagated in the popular press. 
  It is an old trick, but a good one, and it is used very 
frequently. A recent example is the comparative table printed 
in the weekly ARGUMENTY I FAKTY (No. 11, March 1994) entitled 
"The Path of Russia's Economic Development -- How V. 
Chernomyrdin Sees It. And How Ye. Gaydar Sees It," which was 
then commented on by experts A. Illarionov and A. Shapovalyanets 
[See FBIS Report: Central Eurasia -- FBIS-USR-94-029, 24 March 
1994, pp 20-21]. 
  Without undertaking to evaluate the authenticity of the 
viewpoint expounded by the "Russia's Choice" leader on Russia's 
paths of economic development, let us try to analyze how far the 
ARGUMENTY I FAKTY version accords with the position of the 
current government chairman, particularly as in recent months 
Viktor Chernomyrdin has made repeated public statements about it 
and the government's actions are not only in sight of, but under 
close scrutiny from the public and the press. 
  So, what aims, according to the version printed in the 
weekly 
publication, is Viktor Chernomyrdin pursuing? 
  Number one on the list is "halting the slump in production" 
in combination with "the reform of the state-controlled sector 
of the economy." Immediately the interpretation is that, in the 
authors' view, this must mean preferential credit for industry 
and the agricultural sector; large-scale investment by means of 
emissions; concessions to specific enterprises, sectors, and 
regions; state control over economic activity; the expansion of 
licensing, the regulation and level of prices, and so on. In 
other words, an entire complement of nightmares, accompanying 
the advent of "Red directors" and, accordingly, the collapse of 
reform. Clearly, this fossilized stance is in stark contrast to 
curtailing inflation, cutting large-scale benefits, financing 
the budget via "non-inflationary sources," and other exemplary 
measures. 
  But in fact, everything is precisely the other way around. 
Both in the government program, adopted on V. Chernomyrdin's 
initiative last August, and in all the premier's program 
speeches without exception priority was invariably accorded to 
the fight against inflation and the achievement of financial 
stability. The government chairman speaks equally firmly and 
consistently in favor of austere restrictions on the issue of 
money and concessions and of highly specific and purposeful 
support of efficient production units, and against dishing out 
credits. And the government's economic policy has nothing 
whatever to do with expanding the use of such outmoded 
instruments as licensing, or freezing profitability levels and 
prices. The government program also stipulates that the 
creation of an efficient economy is only possible on the basis 
of market mechanisms, and on condition that there is "a 
significant restriction on state intervention in the economy and 
a cut in the share of the state sector." 
  Moreover, these are not just declarations. The measures set 
out in the government program to do away with preferential 
credit, abolish inefficient concessions of an individual nature 
offered to enterprises and regions on taxes and customs duties, 
and cut the range of goods subject to quota and licensing are 
already being implemented. 
  The draft 1994 Federal Budget submitted to the Duma 
stipulates rigid requirements for targeted financing from state 
expenditure on developing the national economy, the size of 
which expenditure is restricted by the rigid frameworks of 
priority federal programs. 
  At the same time, support of such sectors as the 
agro-industrial complex and the coal industry will be guaranteed 
basically via sources of finance not entailing further 
emissions, for which it is planned in the budget to form a 
special support fund. Likewise it is planned to cut drastically 
budget expenditure on paying out subsidies and allowances to 
state enterprises. 
  Why then was it necessary to pass off the dreams of hotheads 
from the federation of commodity producers as the stance, indeed 
as the intentions of the government leader? Actually the 
question is purely rhetorical. It is all patently obvious. 
  However, let us go a little further into the political 
labyrinth whither the authors of ARGUMENTY I FAKTY are 
consigning us. The Russian prime minister's hidden aim is 
declared to be "military and political merger with neighboring 
foreign states." The alternative? It goes without saying -- 
"integration with neighboring foreign states on an economic 
basis." It is true -- for some reason the premier intends to 
implement his "military-political" designs, according to the 
ARGUMENTY I FAKTY version, exclusively by means of "the 
accelerated creation of a ruble zone, continued financial aid to 
close neighbors, and the introduction of a fixed ruble rate." 
  Where this astounding information came from remains a 
mystery. After all, the government's position on a whole range 
of tricky problems regarding Russia's relationships with 
neighboring foreign states has been stated publicly on many 
occasions. Even in the Message from the Russian Federation 
President, the key idea is to combine economic reintegration 
with a deepening of political, including military, cooperation 
among CIS countries. The government was never interested in 
dissolving the Russian economy, or in the amorphous post-Soviet 
economic area. The premier's statement and, in particular, the 
progress of the difficult talks on a whole range of problems in 
Russia's economic relasionships with the CIS countries indicate 
that the priority remains invariably the defense of Russian 
interests. In the draft 1994 budget the extent of financial aid 
to the neighboring countries is being cut significantly and its 
availability regulated. 
  As for the highly complex process of unifying monetary 
systems, there is no mention at all of forcing this difficult 
matter. The government program lays down as a compulsory 
condition of the functioning of the ruble zone the introduction 
of a single currency and the implementation of money-credit and 
budget policy strictly coordinated with Russia. It is possible 
that these terms may not suit some of the partners. But Russia 
can do no other if it wants to avoid emergency financial 
donorship and as a result an inflationary slide. 
  Finally, there is one more "political" (or more precisely, 
"geopolitical") contradiction. According to the version from 
the authors of ARGUMENTY I FAKTY, V. Chernomyrdin's aim is "to 
raise Russia's role as a world power" at a time when Ye. Gaydar 
is pushing merely for "the expansion of contacts with the West 
and the integration of Russia's economy into the world economy." 
  Such a juxtaposition cannot be described as anything but 
imaginary. Russia's status as a world power in no way 
contradicts the "opening up" of its economy or consistent and 
equal integration into the world economy. But its relationship 
with the world (of course, not only with the West) is determined 
by our fatherland's unique Eurasian situation. 
  So this is the "portrait" painted. Admittedly it is no more 
akin to the original than an image churned out by a cheap 
photographer, on which it is difficult to distinguish the eyes 
and the nose and the ears are missing altogether. But this does 
not matter, as the main thing is that it is possible to make 
profound forecasts. For instance, to frighten citizens with the 
prospect of 100-percent inflation a month or a currency rate of 
25-30,000 rubles to the dollar. Why not 50,000 or 60,000? 
After all, these numbers are conjured up by expert A. 
Illarionov from that very same source whence the arguments about 
the government's position derived -- from thin air. 
  Moreover, even our expert's opponent, A. Shapovalyanets, 
commenting on Ye. Gaydar's "alternative" program, also falls 
into the trap of nightmare prophecies. It is typical that both 
commentators, despite different points of departure, conclude 
their predictions almost identically, forecasting social 
explosions on the basis of hyperinflation. But then, you only 
have to invent nightmares to end up frightening yourself with 
them. 
  It is merely a pity for the 6.5 million readers of the 
popular weekly that the authors did not look before leaping. 
The result is confusion, and nothing more.

"Belarus and Turkmenistan Analyze Ukraine's Experience"; boxed 
item is commentary of Economic Policy Department] 
  [Text] Last week the monetary systems of Belarus and 
Turkmenistan underwent significant adjustments with far from 
equal implications for local enterprises and their Russian 
contracting partners. In particular, the decision of the 
Government of Turkmenistan to resume the trading sessions in the 
local currency exchange and to base the official exchange rate 
of the manat on their results created the prerequisites for a 
better mechanism of mutual settlements between Turkmen and 
Russian enterprises. The Belarusian Council of Ministers, on the 
other hand, had an extremely adverse effect on the 
infrastructure of mutual settlements. The republic government 
decided to cover the shortage of currency needed for the 
repayment of "gas" debts to Russia by instituting the compulsory 
sale of all of the export receipts (including those in Russian 
rubles) of Belarusian enterprises directly to the currency 
reserve of the National Bank. This eliminated the need for 
trading sessions in the local currency exchange, but on Thursday 
the decision was amended, although only with respect to joint 
ventures, non-residents of Belarus, and firms which had 
deposited foreign currency in their accounts prior to 14 
March. 
  The history of the national currency markets of the former 
union republics reveals three basic patterns of development, 
which could be termed "Baltic," "Russian," and "Ukrainian." 
According to the first, the official exchange rate of the 
national currency is based on average market indicators and most 
exchanges of currency take place in the interbank market. The 
stability of national currency is achieved primarily by means of 
a stringent monetary policy in this case. The "Russian" pattern 
of development presupposes a strong connection between the 
official exchange rate of the national currency and current 
stock market indicators. The country's main financial agency 
(the central or national bank) can influence the currency market 
with slight adjustments by pursuing a policy of strictly 
scheduled changes in stock exchange quotations. Finally, in the 
"Ukrainian" example, the seeming stability of the official 
exchange rate of national currency is achieved by means of 
flagrant intervention by the national bank or the republic 
leadership in trading sessions (by setting strict limits, for 
example, on the rise in rates in a single session or by stopping 
the session when the rate has reached the necessary level). 
  The events of last week in the currency markets of 
Turkmenistan and Belarus revolved around the "Ukrainian" 
pattern. The Government of Turkmenistan took a discerning view 
of it and decided that the official exchange rate of the manat, 
which had been kept stable for almost half a year while market 
quotations had fallen to less than one-thirtieth of the previous 
rate, could not enhance the prestige of its currency and resumed 
the practice of basing the official exchange rate on the results 
of trading sessions. As a result, the official exchange rates of 
the manat immediately dropped, from 1.99 to 10.00 manats to the 
U.S. dollar and from 600 to 170 rubles to the manat. Although 
there is still a sizable gap between the official exchange rates 
and the actual market rates, the Turkmen leadership's actions 
could have positive implications for local and (and this is much 
more important) Russian financial entities. In particular, the 
gradual convergence of official and market indicators will do 
much to simplify mutual settlements between Russian and Turkmen 
enterprises, which have experienced constant difficulties in 
defining actual rates of exchange, and the repatriation of 
profits. If the Turkmen Government allows local banks to conduct 
settlements through their own correspondent accounts, the local 
market could become extremely appealing to the Russian entities. 
  The Belarusian Council of Ministers, on the other hand, 
became an involuntary apologist for the "Ukrainian" pattern when 
it encountered the need to repay its debts to Russia for 
deliveries of energy resources. It passed decrees to institute 
the compulsory sale of all of the foreign currency receipts of 
local enterprises to the National Bank at the official exchange 
rate. The official exchange rates of the dollar and the Russian 
ruble were set at 10,200 Belarus rubles to the dollar and 6.61 
Belarus rubles to the Russian ruble. It also decided to suspend 
trading sessions in the local currency exchange. At the last 
minute, however, the Bank of Belarus amended the council's 
decision and authorized the sale of foreign currency in the 
exchange by joint ventures, non-residents of Belarus, and 
enterprises which had deposited the foreign currency in their 
accounts prior to 14 March. The Belarusian currency market 
reacted to this "double move" immediately and unequivocally--the 
exchange rate of the dollar was set at 17,950 Belarus rubles to 
the dollar and the rate of the German mark was set at 11,950 
Belarus rubles to the mark on Thursday. In this way, the foreign 
exchange rates of the Belarusian currency fell to half of the 
rate at the beginning of March. The events in Belarus have 
already evoked a response from Russia: By the end of the week 
most of the Russian financial entities specializing in financial 
transfers within the CIS had dramatically reduced the number of 
operations with Belarusian contracting partners and had 
virtually stopped all mutual settlements. 
  In spite of the similarities between the situation in 
Belarus 
and the "Ukrainian" pattern, however, the circumstances in that 
republic could change in the future. In contrast to Ukraine, 
where the crisis of non-payments had stabilized the exchange 
rate of the karbovanets at 25,000-35,000 karbovantsy to the 
dollar virtually without being influenced by the decisions of 
official government structures, the high level of effective 
demand in Belarus provides no hope of quick stabilization. 
Therefore, it probably will be impossible to create even the 
semblance of government decisions influencing conditions in the 
currency market. Besides this, the future of the unified ruble 
zone is still not certain: If the currency systems of Russia and 
Belarus are merged, the Belarusian market could start developing 
according to the Russian pattern instead of the "Ukrainian" one. 
  [Box] 
  The development of the currency markets in the republics of 
the former USSR is influenced by internal and external factors. 
This applies above all to the perturbing effects of Belarusian 
currency regulation, which have been officially justified by 
Minsk's hope of keeping the idea of unification with the Russian 
monetary system afloat, primarily for the purpose of securing 
domestic Russian prices for Belarusian consumers of energy 
resources. The Draconian currency nationalization (the 
100-percent compulsory sale of receipts in rubles and in 
convertible currencies at a clearly unrealistic fixed rate) will 
urge Belarusian businessmen to move beyond republic borders in 
mobilizing resources for settlements with Russia's Gazprom 
Association. According to a statement by Vyacheslav Kebich's 
press secretary on 15 March, Russia is already willing to lower 
its gas prices from 80 to 50 dollars for a thousand cubic meters 
of gas. The same statement included the optimistic comment that 
the package of unification documents would be signed before the 
end of this month. 
  The actual truncation of the currency market in Belarus, 
however, will postpone the decision on another issue of cardinal 
importance in connection with monetary unification--the rates 
for the conversion of the Belarusian clearing rubles and cash 
rubles into Russian rubles. The preferred Russian option (with 
consideration for the actual differences between Belarusian cash 
and non-cash forms of money) is known to be the establishment of 
a single exchange rate, the average of the non-cash market 
exchange rate for the dollar and a cash rate based on a 
coordinated consumer budget. The effective undermining of the 
Belarusian currency market (only currency deposited in the 
accounts of exporters prior to 14 March can be sold freely, and 
this means that the exchange rate in Minsk will be decided by 
the National Bank of Belarus instead of the currency exchange) 
leaves room for currency manipulation, which certainly will not 
be in Russia's interest. There is also a bigger problem. 
Officials in Minsk are reluctant to admit that the unification 
of the monetary systems will be meaningless without a unified 
budget and credit-emission center and, consequently, without the 
surrender of much of Belarus' sovereignty to Moscow.

  [Text] The trend toward a deepening economic crisis, as 
registered by last year's results, remains characteristic of 
most Commonwealth countries at the beginning of the current year 
as well, which may be seen from the dynamics of the main 
economic indicators in January 1994 as compared to January and 
December 1993:

  The volume of production dropped sharply in January of this 
year as compared to the preceding month. Along with the 
across-the-board diminished stock of merchandise, monetary 
emission took place in a number of Commonwealth countries in 
January. In Belarus the money supply increased 5.7-fold as 
compared to January of last year; in Kazakhstan--fivefold; and 
Uzbekistan--17.3-fold. In Russia, 313.5 billion rubles [R] were 
taken out of circulation, and in Tajikistan--R117.7 billion.

  January 1994 is characterized by a further decline of 
industrial production and rising prices for the 
sector's output. The data on the change of the total volume of 
industrial production and enterprises' wholesale prices in the 
Commonwealth states in January 1994 as compared to January 1993 
are shown in the following table (in percents):

  The calculations made by the CIS Statistical Committee show 
that the total volume of industrial production on average in the 
Commonwealth declined by at least 25 percent as compared to 
January of last year, and the average production output, 
adjusted for seasonal factors in production--by 19 percent in 
January as compared to December of last year. 
  The indices of the consumer goods output in the 
Commonwealth states are shown below (January 1994 as % of 
January 1993):

  Production of finished rolled ferrous metal 
declined in January 1994 as compared with the corresponding 
month of last year in Russia by 20 percent and in Kazakhstan by 
24 percent. The output of steel pipe in Russia declined by about 
one-half. 
  There has been a substantial decline as compared to January 
of last year in machine building. The output of 
metal-cutting machine tools declined in Belarus by 41 percent, 
and in Russia and Kazakhstan by 47-48 percent. Russia produced 
62 percent fewer drop-forge machines. Production of automobiles 
in Belarus fell by 60 percent; in Russia, the output of trucks 
fell by 60 percent and of passenger cars by 71 percent. Tractor 
production declined in Kazakhstan and Belarus by 38-39 percent, 
and in Russia by 77 percent. Uzbekistan practically ceased to 
produce them. 
  The lag in the production of chemical products is 
increasing. In January 1994, the output of mineral fertilizer in 
Russia dropped by 26 percent, in Uzbekistan by one-third, 
Belarus by 44 percent, and Kazakhstan by two-thirds. In Russia, 
production of chemical filament and fiber, as well as of 
calcinated soda, declined by 46-47 percent, and that of tires 
declined by 37 percent. Production of synthetic tar and 
plastics, chemical filament and fiber, and tires dropped by half 
in Belarus. 
  In most Commonwealth states there has been a decline in 
production of construction materials. For instance, 
the output of cement declined by one-third in Uzbekistan, by 
40-45 percent in Russia, Kyrgyzstan, and Kazakhstan, and by 57 
percent in Belarus.

  In Russia, the herd of horned cattle decreased over the year 
by 3.3 million head, swine by 3.0 million, and sheep and 
goats--by 7.8 million; in Ukraine--by 835,000, 913,000, and 
395,000 head, respectively. In Uzbekistan the size of the herd 
of sheep and goats dropped by almost 1.5 million head, and in 
Uzbekistan--by 142,000. Herd reductions occurred mainly at 
agricultural enterprises, while their number at the population's 
private plots increased. However, the increased share of herd 
owned by the population has not made up for its decline at 
agricultural enterprises. Changes in the size of the livestock 
herd as of 1 January 1994 as compared to 1 January 1993 at 
agricultural enterprises and those owned by the population 
(including private farms) in individual Commonwealth states are 
characterized by the following data (in percents):

  In all the states, with the exception of Belarus, 
Turkmenistan, and Ukraine, cow productivity declined in January 
of the current year as compared to January 1993. The greatest 
decline occurred in Azerbaijan--by 14 kg (17 percent), 
Kyrgyzstan--by 13 kg (8 percent), and Russia--by 10 kg (by 7 
percent). In Turkmenistan, Belarus, and Ukraine the average 
yield of milk per cow increased over this period by 7 kg (by 4.6 
percent). 
  Over the elapsed month, as compared to January 1993, the 
volume of sales of animal husbandry products to

  In most Commonwealth states as of 1 February 1994, the 
stocks 
of spring grain crops seed (without corn) were higher 
than on this date last year; at the same time, the existing 
stocks do not fully meet the need. In the main potato-growing 
regions of the Commonwealth, the need for this crop's seed, 
although reduced as compared to the past, still is not met by 
available stocks of planting material. The level of stocks of 
spring grain crops and potato seed at agricultural enterprises 
of the Commonwealth states is shown by the following data (in

  The decline in the rate of nominal wages' growth in January 
1994 as compared to the preceding month can be explained by the 
December accumulation of annual and quarterly payments (annual 
bonuses, financial aid, fourth quarter bonuses, length of 
service bonus, and various social allowances). 
  The data on the rate of increases in the population's 
nominal 
income and consumer prices for goods and services (calculated on 
the basis of changes in the cost of family consumer basket) are

<H5>  The Consumer Market </H5>
  Prices for consumer goods continued to rise in 
January in all Commonwealth states. The greatest rises in the 
level of prices in organized trade as compared with December 
1993 were registered in Azerbaijan, Armenia, Belarus, 
Kazakhstan, and Moldova. Changes in retail prices in the 
Commonwealth countries in January are characterized by the 
following data:

  Food prices in the stores of Belarus, Kazakhstan, and 
Azerbaijan went up in January more significantly than those for 
nonfood items: As compared to December 1993 the price index with 
respect to food measured at 151-157 percent, while that for 
nonfood items measured at 129-139 percent. In Russia food prices 
went up by 21 percent, and those for nonfood items--by 13 
percent. At the same time, price increases with respect to 
nonfood items were steeper than those for food in Armenia, where 
the former increased by 88 percent as compared to December of 
last year, and the latter--by 38 percent; in Uzbekistan--by 31 
percent and 23 percent, respectively; and in Moldova--by 49 
percent and 42 percent. 
  Prices for both food and nonfood items increased at 
approximately the same rate in Turkmenistan (by 21 percent and 
23 percent, respectively) and Kyrgyzstan (by 13 percent). 
  Prices for certain items, especially in the food category, 
increased at a significantly higher than average rate. For 
instance, in Kazakhstan, where food prices in January as 
compared to December of last year increased on average by a 
factor of 1.6, meat prices increased by a factor of 1.9, prices 
for butter, margarine, and milk products--by a factor of 2.1 to 
2.5, and eggs--by a factor of 2.9.

  With food prices rising in the stores of all Commonwealth

also went up at city markets. The differential between city 
market prices for foodstuffs and those in retail trade in a

  In practically all Commonwealth countries the physical 
volume of retail turnover continued to decline in 
January, while the total value at the same times increased (as a 
result of price increases). Below are the data on the retail 
turnover of officially registered enterprises in January 1994:

  In Russia, the volume of turnover, including that of 
unregistered trade enterprises, nonorganized import and sales of 
goods by individuals in free trading, amounted in January 1994 
to an estimated R11.5 trillion, which is 8.3 times as much as in 
January 1993 in current prices and 4.4 percent more in 
comparable prices. 
  In most Commonwealth states in January (1 February as 
compared to 1 January), inventories of goods in the retail trade 
network increased, calculated on the basis of one-day turnover 
in January of this year. In Russia as of the beginning of the 
year, the inventories were sufficient for 36 days of trading, 
and as of 1 February--47 days; in Azerbaijan, Belarus, Armenia, 
and Kazakhstan--correspondingly 41-54 days and 59-62 days; in 
Ukraine--43 and 50; in Uzbekistan--63 and 72 days; and in 
Turkmenistan--82 and 93 days. 
  Over the elapsed month as compared to the same period of 
last 
year, the physical volume of for-fee services 
declined in all Commonwealth states, and very significantly, 
even as compared to the already low level in January 1993. Below 
are the data on for-fee services provided by officially 
registered enterprises in the Commonwealth states in January 
1994:

or 12 times as much as last year in current prices, or 42 percent below last 
year's volume in comparable prices. 


  Over the past two years (January 1994 as compared to January 
1992) the physical volume of services rendered to the population 
by officially registered enterprises in this sphere fell almost 
by half in Ukraine, declined almost by a factor of three in 
Russia, fell by about 40 percent in Uzbekistan and Belarus, and 
declined by almost a factor of four in Kyrgyzstan and Moldova. 
  Prices and rates for all categories of for-fee services for 
the population went up in January. As compared to December of 
last year, they increased most in Armenia (by 172.7 percent) and 
Azerbaijan (by 66 percent), and the least in Uzbekistan (by 12 
percent) and Kyrgyzstan (by 16.1 percent). 
  Fees for municipal services went up over the month by 3.9 
percent in Turkmenistan, by 5.6 percent in Kyrgyzstan, and 
4.6-fold in Armenia; passenger transportation rates--by 3.6 
percent in Uzbekistan, by 89.0 percent in Moldova, and 2.7-fold 
in Armenia. The greatest increase of communications services 
rates in January as compared to last year December occurred in 
Azerbaijan (by 216.8 percent) and Armenia (by 181.7 percent), 
and the smallest--in Kazakhstan (by 2.8 percent). Moldova, 
Turkmenistan, and Uzbekistan kept communications services rates 
at last December's level. 
  Fees for attendance of preschool facilities went up in 
Azerbaijan by 668.3 percent, Armenia--by 300 percent, 
Moldova--by 10.2 percent, Turkmenistan--by 15.5 percent, and 
Uzbekistan--by 16.3 percent. 
  The cost of a stay in a sanitarium or resort went up by 80.8 
percent in Belarus, by 61.5 percent in Kazakhstan, by 56.5 
percent in Uzbekistan, and by 13.8 percent in Turkmenistan. 
<H5>  The Labor Market </H5>
  In January, 1.3 million unemployed were registered 
with employment services of the Commonwealth states, which is 
1.5 times as many as during the corresponding period of last 
year. The dynamics of numbers of those looking for a job through 
an employment service and their placement in January are 
characterized by the following data (in thousands persons):

  Of the total number of persons who turned to the employment 
service in search of work, jobs have been found in January 1994: 
in Azerbaijan--for 3.3 percent (5.4 percent in January 1993);

percent); Kyrgyzstan--4.2 percent (9.9 percent); Moldova--2.9 
percent (3.2 percent); Russia--4.1 percent (4.3 percent); 
Tajikistan--0.5 percent (1.8 percent); Uzbekistan--17.8 percent 
(15.7 percent). In Ukraine, jobs were found for 7.5 percent of 
unemployed. 
  The diminished proportional share of persons placed in jobs 
in January 1994 was caused by a decline in requests for workers 
filed with the employment service: For instance, in Belarus, 
Kazakhstan, and Kyrgyzstan their number declined by a factor of 
1.5; in Moldova--by a factor of 1.2; and in Russia--by a factor 
of 1.1 
  The number of those who received the formal status of 
unemployed increased in Azerbaijan 2.9-fold, in 
Armenia--1.7-fold, in Belarus--2.3-fold, Kazakhstan and 
Ukraine--1.2-fold, Kyrgyzstan--1.6-fold, Moldova--1.1-fold, 
Russia--1.4 fold, and Uzbekistan--1.3-fold.

<F P=106> [Article by DELOVOY MIR commentator Vladimir Mekhontsev </F>
under the "A Viewpoint" rubric: "The Baltic 'Train' and Russian 
Interests"] 
  [Text] No matter from which angle we look at the 
Baltic question--historic, economic, military-strategic, or 
geopolitical--one cannot fail to notice the main point: This 
region represents a zone of vitally important interests for 
Russia--as well as some for other CIS states, as a matter of 
fact. Therefore, the three Baltic countries' joining the NATO 
"Partnership for Peace" program could not fail to affect Russia 
to some or other extent. 
  This would all not be so bad had we been dealing with 
ensuring European (and hence world) security within the 
framework of CSCE structures, which already have been 
functioning rather successfully for almost two decades. When, 
however, certain forces promote the North Atlantic Treaty 
Organization, with its well-known military might and quite 
well-defined interests as a guarantor of stability on the 
continent; when the Baltic countries themselves see their 
joining the "Partnership" program as a step in the direction of 
full integration into the NATO structures; when their 
aspirations find their realization in a complete distancing from 
Russia--this may not only have a negative effect on our 
political interests, but may also have an adverse effect on our 
economy. 
  And indeed, large ports on the Baltic Sea, oil terminals, 
transit oil and gas pipelines, huge electrotechnical and 
transport-building production facilities, which in most 
instances were built through the efforts of both Russia and the 
former Union republics, may be placed overnight out of Russia's 
reach by a nod from a NATO "conductor." The evidence that this 
is not entirely contrived are the voices sounding even from the 
State Department of the largest NATO member--the United States. 
This is what the influential WASHINGTON POST recently wrote, 
quoting the revelation of an official of the aforementioned 
organization: "The fight in the economic sphere of Russia will 
be protracted and difficult. We are resolutely against a Russian 
sphere of influence; neither do Russia's neighbors want it." And 
keeping in mind that the Russian leadership has not yet made a 
decision on whether to participate in the "Partnership," it is 
easy to understand why Russia reacted with such keen sensitivity 
to the Baltic countries' joining this program. 
<H5>  Political Euphoria and Real Difficulties </H5>
  Without doubt, for the purpose of realizing their "strategic 
goals," the Baltics states intend widely to use the potential of 
international organizations and alliances. That is why joining 
the "Partnership," seen in this context, did cause a certain 
surge of political euphoria among the leadership and radically 
minded population strata of these countries. Nevertheless, one 
can easily forecast that emotional elation will subside as soon 
as it encounters economic realities. 
  First, participation in the program is a rather costly idea. 
If competent persons in the Baltics do not dare to provide even 
the most approximate figures, one may come up with an estimate 
on the example of Poland, for which its membership in the 
"Partnership for Peace" will cost $22 million annually. But this 
is, so to say, an "external" difficulty. There are also purely 
internal ones. 
  The fact that the three republics of the region were for 
decades a part of the integrated economic system of the former 
Union; that their production ties had been locked onto partners 
in other republics (to a considerable extent in the Russian 
Federation); that their products had been designed for the 
all-Union market--these and other factors are unlikely to allow 
for a sufficiently rapid structural restructuring of industry in 
Lithuania, Latvia, and Estonia in order to redirect it toward 
Western markets. (And this market, actually, is quite crowded to 
allow one to quickly find his "niche" in it.) Lithuania's 
example is indicative in this respect: According to the data of 
the Lithuanian department of statistics, last year Russia was 
the destination for 41 percent of its exports, and provided 75.1 
percent of its imports. For comparison: Exports to the West 
accounted to 25.9 percent, and imports--12.7 percent. It is not 
accidental that the Lithuanian Embassy in Moscow noted that 
"economic relations and trade involve mainly Russia and the 
former republics of the Soviet Union." 
  Another difficulty is the Baltic states' dependence on 
deliveries of fuels and energy from Russia and some CIS 
countries. In an attempt to overcome this "difficulty," the 
Baltic countries undertake various steps and are searching for 
alternative solutions. The most prominent example of this is the 
proposed construction of new export-import oil terminals in 
Lithuanian Butinga and Latvian Liepaja. Besides a purely 
economic factor (considerable financial expenditures on the 
actual construction in Butinga or deepening the navigating 
channel in Liepaja), there are political and ecological factors 
that may play a negative role. 
  The point is that a terminal in Butinga, which will have 
better capabilities than the port of Liepaja to service 
high-tonnage tankers, has the prospect of becoming completely 
Lithuanian in the future and presenting serious competition to 
Liepaja. This must worry the Latvian side, while for Lithuania, 
according to specialists, "the issue of the terminal is the 
issue of the survival of its industry." Environmentalists also 
may take an active stand against the construction of a new 
terminal in Butinga (practically on the border with Latvia), who 
believe--and not without good reason--that in the event of any 
accident at the terminal, the Latvian natural environment will 
sustain serious damage. 
  In short, there are more than enough problems. And anyway, 
it 
is very difficult to foresee all the difficulties arising along 
the thorny road of independence. It is much more important, in 
my opinion, to attempt to understand what Russia will lose in 
the event of such a decisive turn of the Baltics toward NATO and 
what needs to be done in order to.... 
<H5>  ....Ensure the Russian Interests in the Region </H5>
  In the opinion, for instance, of specialists from the 
Russian 
Foreign Economic Relations Scientific Research Institute, 
keeping in mind the difficult financial situation, Russia will 
not be able to build new ports in the near future. In other 
words, we will be forced to seek some sort of compromise to 
ensure for ourselves a gate to the Baltic Sea. 
  There also exist certain concerns in the matter of using oil 
pipelines. Russia already is paying considerable money for each 
tonne of Russian oil being exported through transit pipelines. 
It is easy to imagine how dearly a hypothetical increase in the 
cost of transit will cost Russia. 
  The question of Kaliningrad Oblast--a "Russian enclave" 
surrounded at all sides by "abroad"--may flare up in a way 
painful for Russia. The ink was not dry yet on A. Brazauskas' 
signature under the agreement of Lithuania joining the 
"Partnership" when Lithuanian radicals, led by high-ranking 
members of parliament, began openly to demand seizing 
Kaliningrad Oblast from Russia and creating on its territory a 
new state integrated into the structures of Northern Europe. 
  Of course, to avoid these and many other difficulties in 
relations with the Baltics, we should have thought of Russian 
interests considerably earlier. By now many political statements 
of the Russian leadership are seen, in particular by the press, 
as attempts to board a train that has already left the station. 
There is a certain amount of truth to it. Strictly speaking, 
however, the "train" has just "started off," and Russia still 
can make it there. 
  In order to accomplish this, we probably should, while 
holding a firm political position with respect to vitally 
important interests of Russia in this region, to more actively 
use first and foremost economic levers. I do not mean threats to 
"turn off oil or gas faucets"--for this will only provide a 
short-term benefit but to a large extent deprive us of a 
prospect to develop normal relations between Russia and the 
Baltics. Normal economic relations, however, unrestricted 
development of business and trade not only on a state level but 
also on the level of concrete companies and individual 
producers, will enable us to ensure Russian interests in the 
Baltics. 
  In the opinion of specialists from the Russian Federation 
Ministry of the Economy, the most realistic road is through more 
active involvement of Russia's business circles in the Baltics; 
striking root there by creating joint enterprises, buying blocks 
of stock of large enterprises--in short, using the broadest 
complex of measures with the aim of developing business and 
trade-economic ties with Russia. But this cannot be a one-way 
road. It is necessary to create a system of certain preferences 
for Baltic business as well. In this respect, the signing and 
the soonest possible ratification of already existing 
agreements--for instance, on most-favored trade status--would 
help a great deal. 
  Most importantly, Russia needs a clear, centralized policy 
with respect to its next-door neighbors. People responsible for 
the conduct of foreign policy and entrepreneurs must walk hand 
in hand. This two lines should be brought together not in the 
ministerial sense, but on a much more broad political and 
practical scale.

<F P=106> [Text of the Draft Agreement Between the Russian Federation </F>
Government and the Kyrgyz Republic Government on Regulating the 
Resettlement Process and Protecting Resettlers' Rights] 
  [Text] The Russian Federation Government and the Kyrgyz 
Republic Government, hereinafter called the Signatories, guided 
by the principles contained in the United Nations' fundamental 
documents on human rights, based on the provisions of the Treaty 
on Friendship, Cooperation, and Mutual Aid Between the Russian 
Federation and the Republic of Kyrgyzstan of 10 June 1992, and 
proceeding from the desire to define the procedures and 
conditions for resettling persons as well as the Signatories' 
mutual obligations to provide assistance in resettling to those 
persons, have agreed upon the following: 
<H5>  Article 1 </H5>
  This Agreement applies to persons who are moving from the 
Russian Federation to the Kyrgyz Republic or from the Kyrgyz 
Republic to the Russian Federation. 
  This Agreement applies only once to each resettler. 
  The Signatories consider any coercion of persons to resettle 
intolerable. 
<H5>  Article 2 </H5>
  The terms used in this Agreement have the following 
meanings: 
  a) a "resettler" is a person who voluntarily leaves the 
state 
of his permanent residence and moves to a permanent place of 
residence on the territory of a different state; 
  b) "members of the resettler's family" are the wife (or 
husband), parents, and underage children as well as other 
relatives or disabled dependents who live with the resettler and 
keep a common household with him; 
  c) the "state of exit" is the former state of permanent 
residence; 
  d) the "state of entry" is the new state of permanent 
residence. 
<H5>  Article 3 </H5>
  This Agreement does not apply to the following: 
  a) refugees; 
  b) migrant workers; 
  c) persons convicted of committing a crime who have served 
the time; 
  d) persons whose departure will damage the security of the 
state of exit, until the circumstances preventing the departure 
cease to be in effect; 
  e) persons whose departure has been postponed until they 
fulfill property obligations to state, cooperative, public, or 
other organizations or institutions or private persons; 
  f) persons temporarily on the state's territory in 
connection 
with studies or private or business trips; 
  g) military personnel who are on active military duty and 
members of their families. 
<H5>  Article 4 </H5>
  Permission to resettle is granted to resettlers by the state 
of exit in accordance with international law norms and its own 
laws. 
<H5>  Article 5 </H5>
  On their territories, the Signatories provide protection of 
resettlers and members of their families from any actions in the 
form of violence, threat, or intimidation or other actions based 
on gender, race, nationality, language, religion or beliefs, 
political or other views, ethnic or social origin, or economic, 
property, or family status either on behalf of state officials 
or on behalf of private persons, groups, public associations, or 
other organizations. 
<H5>  Article 6 </H5>
  The Signatories' migration services offer the resettlers and 
their families the following essential information: 
  a) the content of this Agreement; 
  b) their rights and obligations in the state of entry; 
  c) conditions of job placement and the possibility of 
receiving education, vocational training, retraining, and 
vocational guidance, as well as other conditions of residing in 
the state of entry (natural-climatic, housing and domestic, 
sociocultural, and other conditions). 
<H5>  Article 7 </H5>
  Resettlers and members of their families have the following 
rights: 
  a) to take out all personal property which they personally 
own that is declared before they leave the state of exit, with 
consideration of the restrictions applicable to removing 
cultural treasures which the laws of the state of exit recognize 
as national treasures; 
  b) to sell or in some other way dispose of property which 
they personally own and take out of the state of exit or bring 
into the state of entry the monetary capital received following 
the announced procedure in any currency and in an unrestricted 
amount; 
  c) to transfer monetary deposits and assets placed in 
banking 
institutions of the state of exit to banking institutions of the 
state of entry; 
  d) to leave personal property, real estate, monetary 
deposits, and assets belonging to them with the rights of 
ownership on the territory of the state of exit and execute the 
right of possession, use, and disposal. 
  The state of exit assumes the expenditures for transferring 
monetary deposits and assets through banking institutions 
authorized to do so. 
  Personal property and real estate may not be alienated by 
the

<F P=106> [Interview with Vasil Vasylyovych Onopenko, minister of </F>
justice of Ukraine, by Galina Khmilevskaya, KRIMSKAYA SVITLITSYA 
special correspondent; place and date not given: "Which Way Is 
the Crimean Peninsula Drifting"] 
  [Text] On 24 February 1994 the Supreme Council of 
Ukraine passed a decree "On the Status of the Autonomous 
Republic of Crimea in Accordance with Legislation of Ukraine. It 
emphasizes that "the Crimea is an autonomous constituent part of 
Ukraine and therefore is not a bearer of state sovereignty and 
cannot enter into political relations with foreign states." The 
Crimea does not have its own citizenship separate from that of 
Ukraine. It cannot have its own military formations and its own 
monetary system. 
  The Supreme Council of Ukraine proposed that the 
Crimean leadership bring the legislation of the autonomous 
republic into conformity with the legislation of Ukraine. 
  Galina Khmilevskaya, a special correspondent of the 
KRIMSKAYA SVITLITSYA newspaper, met with Vasyl Vasylyovych 
Onopenko, minister of justice of Ukraine, on the eve of an 
examination of the Crimean question in parliament. We present 
the interview with him. 
  [Khmilevskaya] It is being suggested to Crimeans that 
supposedly independent Ukraine, in contrast to the Crimea, does 
not have its own constitution, and that it is therefore living 
according to the old constitution, specifically the Constitution 
of the Ukrainian Soviet Socialist Republic. What is this--a 
propaganda trick? Counting on the people's lack of legal 
information? 
  [Onopenko] I am amazed by such a statement. Ukraine has its 
own constitution--the constitution of an independent, 
democratic, and rule-of-law state. And this, in particular, is 
indicated in paragraph 1 of Article 68 of the Constitution of 
Ukraine and other articles. 
  [Khmilevskaya] Consequently, owing to amendments that were 
made, we have a constitution that is new in content... 
  [Onopenko] Yes, we are living according to the Constitution 
of Ukraine and not according to that of the Ukrainian Soviet 
Socialist Republic, as was the case at one time. Dozens of 
amendments have been made, according to which the Basic Law has 
been brought into conformity with current requirements. 
  It is true that there are some old laws that we are 
compelled 
to use, inasmuch as Ukraine has not prepared and has not turned 
out all of the necessary laws. This is so, but the Constitution 
of Ukraine operates and regulates the basic social processes in 
the state, in particular, Ukraine's administrative-territorial 
system as well... 
  [Khmilevskaya] ...Also establishing the status of the 
Republic of Crimea? 
  [Onopenko] In accordance with the Constitution of Ukraine 
(Article 75 superscript 1), "The Republic of Crimea is a 
constituent part of Ukraine that must operate on the principles 
of administrative autonomy." The legal status of the Republic of 
Crimea is determined not only by this article of the 
Constitution, but also by other laws, in particular, by the Law 
of Ukraine of 29 April 1992 "On the Status of the Autonomous 
Republic of Crimea," and the Law of 30 June 1992 "On Making 
Changes and Additions to the Law of Ukraine 'On the Status of 
the Autonomous Republic of Crimea,'" and also the important Laws 
"On Demarcation of Powers between the Organs of State Authority 
of Ukraine and the Republic of Crimea," etc. 
  [Khmilevskaya] Thus, no matter what we call ourselves: the 
Republic of Crimea, or the island state of Crimea, we will still 
be a constituent part of Ukraine according to its Basic Law? 
  [Onopenko] Based on the Constitution of Ukraine in effect, 
this is precisely the case. 
  [Khmilevskaya] Then why is the "Crimean question" so 
critical? 
  [Onopenko] The fact is that the Crimean parliament has 
adopted many laws that do not agree with the basic laws and the 
Constitution of Ukraine. 
  [Khmilevskaya] Can you name them? 
  [Onopenko] Listing them would take a long time. But some can 
be mentioned. For example, the Constitution of Ukraine affirms 
the position on associations of citizens and political parties. 
This is a constitutional provision. The Constitution of Crimea 
also has such a concept; moreover, a law has been passed "On 
Association of Citizens." If you analyze Article 9 concerning 
the association of citizens, it states that political parties 
with an all-Ukrainian status can be established on the territory 
of Ukraine. In the Crimean Law "On Association of Citizens" it 
is an issue of some other kind of status, specifically--an 
all-Crimean status... So here is your first contradiction. 
  [Khmilevskaya] It is this exact contradiction that blocked 
the path to the Crimean parliament for branches of Ukrainian 
parties operating on Crimean territory and compelled them to 
unite into one (but now Crimean) party--the Ukrainian Civic 
Congress of Crimea [UGKK]. The pro-Ukrainian (ruling) forces 
were drawn into a registration trap, which made it practically 
impossible for members of the Ukrainian Civic Congress of Crimea 
to take part in the elections to the Crimean parliament on party 
lists. The party was registered a week before the end of the 
campaign to collect signatures. No opportunities remained. Here 
is a significant fact for you that indicates in whose favor the 
contradictions of the Crimean laws are arranged and operate. 
Obviously, not in favor of the state-creating forces in Ukraine. 
  [Onopenko] It is a pity, but even the very concept of an 
international political party or an international public 
association are treated absolutely differently in the law of 
Ukraine and the law of Crimea. After all, an international 
political party is a party that has its own cells in some other 
country. 
  We find another contradiction between the legislation of the 
Crimea and Ukraine in the law on property, and even in the 
terminology. In particular, Article 75 of the Constitution of 
the Republic of Crimea recognizes private, collective, 
municipal, state, and other property on the territory of the 
republic. According to the Ukrainian law on property of 7 July 
1992, private property and collective and state forms of 
property exist in Ukraine. That is, there is an incongruity even 
in this. 
  The concept of a judicial system is very dear to me. 
Therefore, in accordance with the Constitution of Ukraine that 
is in force, and in accordance with the laws on the judicial 
system and the law on the status of judges, the Supreme Court 
and the oblast court are elected by the Supreme Council of 
Ukraine. If you look into the Constitution of Crimea you find 
one more contradiction that works to weaken Ukrainian statehood: 
The oblast (now) court of Crimea is elected by the Supreme 
Council of Crimea. This is a very fundamental divergence, 
inasmuch as we cannot talk about a single judicial system on the 
territory of Ukraine, which can lead to very negative 
consequences. 
  [Khmilevskaya] Vasyl Vasylyovych, does it not seem to you 
that after 5 May 1992, when the Constitution of the Republic of 
Ukraine was adopted, and later its operation was suspended, 
nevertheless, all actions of the Crimean parliament were openly 
or in a veiled way directed at separating the Crimea from 
Ukraine and making it independent? 
  [Onopenko] You are touching on a very serious problem. 
Actually, if you analyze some very important acts adopted by the 
Supreme Council of Crimea (in particular, the "Act on 
Proclamation of State Independence of the Republic of Crimea" 
was adopted on 5 May, and later the decree "On the Conduct of an 
all-Crimean Referendum" and certain other acts), they actually 
denoted that the process for the legitimate secession of the 
Crimea from the Ukrainian structure was being started. 
  [Khmilevskaya] At that time, Kiev reacted... 
  [Onopenko] Actually, the recent acts of the Supreme Council 
of the Republic of Crimea associated with the proclamation of 
state independence and the conduct of an all-Crimean referendum 
were declared to be contradictory to the Constitution and laws 
of Ukraine in a decree of the Supreme Council of Ukraine of 13 
May 1992. It was recommended to the Supreme Council of Crimea 
that it revoke the aforementioned acts. Unfortunately, it must 
be said today that the Supreme Council of Crimea in fact ignored 
the decision of the Ukrainian parliament and did not revoke its 
constitutional decisions. 
  [Khmilevskaya] Who in this situation was supposed to stand 
guard over the Ukrainian Constitution? Who was supposed to be 
the supreme observer looking after implementation and observance 
of the law? 
  [Onopenko] The best solution for Ukraine would be the 
establishment of a Constitutional Court whose jurisdiction would 
include the resolution of precisely such problems and questions. 
Unfortunately, there is no Constitutional Court in Ukraine yet. 
  [Khmilevskaya] Who was slow with this? Why did the law on 
the 
Constitutional Court not pass? 
  [Onopenko] You see, it was the Supreme Council that was 
involved in the discussion of the composition of the 
Constitutional Court. Incidentally, the proposed standard for 
the establishment of this court has already been included in the 
current constitution. Therefore, we have a legal basis for the 
creation of a Constitutional Court of Ukraine. 
  [Khmilevskaya] But tell me, who under these conditions is 
supposed to give an evaluation of the decisions of the Supreme 
Council of Crimea? 
  [Onopenko] The Supreme Council of Ukraine was supposed to do 
this (and it actually did do so). Although a mechanism did not 
exist for implementing the decree of the Ukrainian parliament 
about bringing Crimean laws into conformity with Ukrainian laws. 
Therefore, the decree of the Supreme Council of Ukraine of 13 
May 1992 actually remained unfulfilled. 
  [Khmilevskaya] Of course, this situation could not help but 
be exploited by those forces that are in power today... It is no 
secret that five out of six candidates for president ran under 
the slogans "Crimea in Russia!" and "The Ruble Zone, the 
Motherland, Russia!" Although purely economic problems here were 
of no small importance; after all, a crisis has enveloped 
Ukraine, and the impoverishment of the people is growing. 
Nevertheless, separatist aspirations played a definite role. 
  [Onopenko] The situation in Ukraine is really not simple. 
There are extremely complicated questions of an economic, 
social, and political nature. We can only ascertain that the 
people decided precisely in the way that they did decide. 
Therefore, when it is a question of the will of the people and 
the actions of one or another leader, one or another person, 
then I would like to differentiate a little between the will of 
the people and the responsibility of individual officials for 
one or another action. People want to live better. 
Unfortunately, the situation is now such that it is not easy to 
live in general either in the Crimea or in Ukraine. But when it 
is a question of citizens of Ukraine who live in the Crimea, 
individual persons, then we can talk about juridical and, in 
particular, criminal responsibility, if premeditated actions 
take place that are associated with changes in the territory of 
Ukraine or its borders and are aimed at changes in the 
constitutional system and structure of Ukraine. Criminal 
proceedings can be instituted here that are envisioned in 
Article 62 of the Criminal Code of Ukraine. 
  [Khmilevskaya] It is personally insulting to me that in the 
course of two years some leaders uttered these criminal slogans 
at every rally, and one of them even permitted himself to call 
Ukraine "a neighboring state" at meetings of the Crimean 
parliament. And official Kiev observed all of this calmly, so no 
energetic actions were undertaken. Today these leaders can 
defend themselves with the will of the people. The situation, as 
you see, changed. Behind them are the people who gave them their 
votes, who voted for those slogans which are in themselves 
criminal to a certain degree. 
  [Onopenko] You are right in saying that the situation has 
changed, and that the will of the people is present. But there 
is also the will of the people of Ukraine. Constitutional 
principles of an independent Ukraine as a legal democratic state 
exist. Therefore, here, if we are to conduct a policy with 
respect to the Crimea, it is impossible to use only legal 
language from the standpoint of legal norms only. In my opinion, 
Ukraine should have conducted a more subtle and flexible policy 
with respect to the Crimea: economic, political, and social. 
After all, where Ukraine and its state structures did not do 
enough work, this gap was inevitably filled by someone, which 
led to those shortcomings that are present now. 
  As for the responsibility of certain specific persons, 
including criminal responsibility, I would not want to 
concentrate attention on this, inasmuch as the question of one 
or another legal responsibility of each specific person should 
be resolved only in the established order, and only on the basis 
of collected evidence can a court declare a specific person 
guilty of one or another act. 
  [Khmilevskaya] But if there is no such evidence, then it is 
also impossible to institute proceedings against one or another 
person... 
  Dear Vasyl Vasylyovych, I have already said that the heads 
of 
a good half of Crimeans have been zombie-ized or stupefied by 
the idea that the Crimea is "a separate state" (three years of 
psychological information "conditioning" have had their effect). 
This is what people write to me: "When will you finally stop 
conducting an antistate policy in the Crimea." But I stand on 
the official position of Ukraine! 
  [Onopenko] You see, it is necessary to take into account 
what 
is put into these concepts. After all, if it is a question of 
broadening some powers of the Republic of Crimea that are 
established by its legislative, executive, and judicial organs, 
then this phenomenon is normal. But if the question concerns 
additional powers of the Republic of Crimea as an autonomous 
republic in the structure of Ukraine, then these questions 
should be resolved on a legal basis. Therefore, if the Republic 
of Crimea had broader powers for the benefit of the residents of 
Crimea and in their interests, and I do not rule this out, and, 
obviously, it will be necessary to take this path, then this is 
a normal phenomenon. I will say only that everything must occur 
within the scope of existing legislation and, specifically, the 
existing legislation that is in effect in Ukraine. If 
contradictions exist between legislation in effect in the 
Republic of Crimea and the legislation of Ukraine, then it is 
necessary to bring Crimean legislation into conformity with 
Ukrainian laws. 
  [Khmilevskaya] What will be the attitude toward a Crimean 
referendum, if one is held? 
  [Onopenko] I am only the minister of justice of Ukraine, and 
I cannot give any guarantees, let alone predict how specifically 
the state authorities of Ukraine will treat this. This falls in 
the jurisdiction of the Supreme Council of Ukraine. And it must 
react in an appropriate way to specific decisions. 
  But I do know something else. And, unfortunately, I was 
unable to meet with President of Crimea Yuriy Meshkov when I was 
in the Crimea recently to review the work of the institutions 
and organs of justice (we missed each other at the time). I know 
that he is a lawyer, and I also am a lawyer, and therefore I 
hope that Yuriy Aleksandrovich, as a responsible person to whom 
the people entrusted an exceptional amount of authority, and, 
first and foremost, I emphasize, as a lawyer, he will respect 
the law and will be guided by the laws of both Ukraine and the 
Crimea. 
  [Khmilevskaya] Well, as our great countrywoman said in 
difficult moments, "contra spem spero!"--"I am hoping against 
hope!" Thank you for the interview.

<F P=106> [Article by Olha Burda: "Piemonte May Indeed Not Be...Where </F>
They Have Found It"] 
  [Text] Donetsk--In opening the pages of POST-POSTUP 
to a debate occasioned by the article of Mariya Kara 
(POST-POSTUP No. 6, 1994) "Piemonte Appears Not To Be Where They 
Were Looking for It. It Appears That the Fate of the State Will 
Be Decided in These Elections by East Ukrainian Pragmatism," the 
editorial office considers it necessary to comment on the 
articles published. Having read the article of our Donetsk 
correspondent Olha Burda on the electoral prospects of the 
Donbass, which is published below, we did not notice any 
particular differences between the views of journalists from 
Lvov and Donetsk on the situation in the Donbass. Incidentally, 
Mariya Kara wrote her article after a lengthy assignment to 
Donetsk and Lugansk Oblasts. Apparently the debate was brought 
on by the title of Mariya Kara's article, which maintains that 
in these elections the fate of the state will be decided by East 
Ukrainian pragmatism. In putting this judgment at the beginning 
of the article, the editorial office has deliberately proceeded 
to switch that which is desirable for that which is real because 
it still firmly insists that pro-Russian separatism in that 
region may only be overcome by East Ukrainian pragmatism. It may 
be too weak yet, but for now no alternative to it is 
apparent. 
  It might be that from the beautiful "far-away" Halychyna it 
is indeed easier to see the colors with which the steppes of 
Donetsk shine and play. It might also be that precisely due to 
its geographic remoteness it is not quite visible that the 
Donbass is primarily a much more politically aggressive Donetsk 
area over which a new dawn, most likely that of a red color yet 
again, will break at any minute. It appears very much as if this 
region--whose votes brought in Kravchuk for Ukraine and which 
has helped to form the "group of 239"--has not learned anything 
anyway, even from its own mistakes. This means that the Donetsk 
area has a great many prerequisites for arriving at the new 
parliament on the old Red wagon. 
  So, about the prerequisites. During the blissful time of 
stagnation, the Communist Party organization of Donetsk Oblast 
was inferior only to those of Moscow and Leningrad in terms of 
numerical strength. Even without joining the imeni Comrade 
Symonenko Communist Party of Ukraine, the faithful "Leninists" 
have not disappeared. At present they live here and win 
victories here--by numerical strength, involvement, discipline, 
and communist solidarity. Reared by the totalitarian system in 
the spirit of boundless obedience, they will certainly come to 
the elections and give their votes in favor of a system under 
which they had a life and plenty of food and even drink. 
Likewise, we should not ignore the fact that the Donetsk area is 
the "richest" in retirees. While for the most part utterly 
apolitical, they will, after standing in overnight lines for 
their retirement benefits, turn out for the elections, after 
all, in order to pragmatically vote...certainly, not for an idea 
but for the past with the 12 ruble retirement benefits, 
degrading but stable and delivered to their homes by the state. 
  Unlike the young people of Halychyna, who are patriotically 
aware, those in the Donetsk area will simply ignore the next 
election. It is precisely to the apolitical stance and the 
"I-don't-give-a-damn" attitudes of old and young people that an 
oblast referendum which nobody needs apart from Boldyrevs and 
Gurevychs and a handful of state officials is geared--the 
referendum on the need to introduce in the territory of Donetsk 
Oblast and the entire Ukraine the state Russian language along 
with Ukrainian and to have Ukraine sign the CIS Statute as a 
full-fledged rather than associate member, as well as on the 
feasibility of the federal-land arrangement in Ukraine. 
  Now about the candidates. If we turn to preelection 
statistics, it is hard not to notice that out of 562 candidates 
for deputies, 52 are members of the Communist Party of Ukraine 
and 30 are members of the Socialist Party of Ukraine. However, 
this is not yet all, because one can have communist views 
without carrying a party membership card in one's pocket. An 
analysis of the composition of deputies in just one district by 
Valentyna Protsenko, chairman of the regional organization of 
the People's Rukh of Ukraine, testifies to this quite 
convincingly. In addition to two documented communists and one 
socialist, the following are running among 14 of her opponents: 
the former first secretary of the Krasnoarmeysk City Committee 
of the Communist Party, Vasyl Sapunov, a former employee of the 
city committee and rayon committee of the party, Oleksandr 
Denisov, attorney Volodymyr Loban and Prosecutor Leonid 
Zakharov, who defended and improved the socialist system, and 
the former leader of the Youth Communist League of the highest 
rank, Volodymyr Butko, who have been nominated by voters and 
labor collectives. The independent Yuriy Kotov comes out with an 
openly communist program, whereas leaders of the Independent 
Trade Union of Miners engage in propaganda for the former party 
organizer from the imeni Stakhanov Mine, Volodymyr Ivanov, whom 
they themselves not so long ago evicted from his party suites. 
So, the communists are not sitting idly by. Petro Symonenko 
himself, having moved for the preelection period to the rural 
Krasnoarmeyskiy District, is confidently forging the future 
victory. He has a good team of kolkhoz and rural council 
chairmen who intimidate people conditioned in the spirit of 
boundless trust and respect for the bosses with the horrors the 
Rukh people will commit on coming to power. The prospect of a 
sausage shortage and a lack of opportunity to steal even a liter 
of milk from a kolkhoz cow is the most effective. Thus, in the 
future elections the principle that brought Kravchuk to power 
will work (especially in rural areas): "The lower strata follow 
the top echelons," that is, the people will vote for the bosses' 
candidate. 
  Readers of POST-POSTUP know enough about the activities of 
the current and (which is quite possible) future pragmatists 
from the Donbass--acting Prime Minister Yukhym Zvyahilskyy, 
Deputy Prime Minister V. Landik, and Chairman of the State Coal 
Industry Association M. Surhay--in order not to attach to these 
activities particular hopes for the revival of Ukraine. 
Seventy-four candidates representing local councils and 
executive structures and 14 former people's deputies who are 
running yet again and whose chances are good inspire little 
optimism on this score. After all, yet another principle can 
work on which a different segment of the Donbass electorate has 
already elected Kravchuk at one point--"They already have work 
experience" (for now, it is not important what kind of 
experience). The pragmatism of the Donbass rises to its heights 
in the position of the candidate from the Labor Party, Mykola 
Azarov, who, not concealing his sympathy for Zhirinovskiy, 
stated somewhat simply on television that "the LDPR [Liberal 
Democratic Party of Russia] should be judged by its actions 
rather than its words." It would be good if after such "actions" 
someone is still around to judge. 
  There also are pragmatists of a new type, a small group of 
entrepreneurs, on the candidate lists. The proletariat of 
Donetsk is burning with class hatred for some of them, who have 
gone into business for a short time in order to flee "after 
reigning for their own 100 rubles-worth." Another segment, those 
who have gone in whole hog and for a long time to come and can 
see well beyond their own noses, provokes hatred from another 
social stratum and risks being shot, as very recently did 
Valeriy Slyusarev, an entrepreneur from Artem who has invested a 
fortune in his unfortunate countrymen. In Torez, a person was 
shot who was supposed to be the campaign agent of entrepreneur 
Valeriy Nazarov, a candidate for deputy. Although the future 
indeed belongs to new honest pragmatists, such as Oleksandr 
Opryshenko (president of the public joint-stock company 
Medita-Ukrayina), Petro Tsekhmister (director of the Kamyanka 
Shakhtarska private mine), and Stanislav Melnyk (director of the 
RDK Helso), for now they are too few to influence the overall 
picture of elections in the Donbass, even if they are elected. 
  As we try to see the color of the future dawn over the 
steppes of Donetsk, we should know the colors of candidates from 
the GKU [Civic Congress of Ukraine], the Slavic Unity Party, the 
Peasant Party of Ukraine, and the Labor Congress of Ukraine, to 
say nothing about the socialists-communists. The main point is 
not to overestimate, after all, the ability of the Donbass 
electorate to learn from its mistakes, because regular polling 
of the residents of Khartsyzsk by a sociological group (over 
several weeks) has not given grounds for optimism: One-third of 
the voters will give their votes to communists. Consequently, 
"although the people of the Donbass are not Korean, they are 
intimidated by the Rukh people, democrats, and nationalists to 
such a degree that for another 30 years they will not want to 
live like people and will firmly stay on the path of Lenin."

<F P=106> [Article by Mariya Kara, from Dnepropetrovsk and Lvov: "A </F>
Split in `Russian' Ukraine"] 
  [Text] At the opening of the second conference of 
Grynyov and Kuchma's Inter-Regional Reform Bloc (MBR), which 
took place in the unspeakable stagnation-period splendor of the 
old Dnepropetrovsk Political Education Building--quietly 
transformed into a Business Center--two picket lines shivered in 
their wet snow boots. On one stood three old Bolsheviks and two 
old Bolshevik women, in ripped shoes and threadbare clothing. 
Their demands: "Down with the Bourgeoisie, Grynyov, Kuchma and 
Balashov! Long Live the USSR!" Only two out of the five 
inscriptions were in Ukrainian. Across the street stood three 
UNA-UNSO leaders and one person from Rukh. They were equally old 
and wore similarly shabby clothes. They were in full agreement 
with part one of the others' slogans, which concerned the 
bourgeoisie, Grynyov, Kuchma and Balashov, who were here 
additionally described as `kikes'. As to point two, concerning 
the USSR, their point of view was diametrically opposed. The 
sides could not find a compromise and, in the absence of the 
`bourgeoisie' and `kikes', tediously cursed one another. Before 
the picket lines was the band of National Guard, cheerfully 
playing four pieces which included "Higher and Higher," "The 
Slavic Woman's Farewell" and "Red Cranberry Tree". The 
"Cranberry Tree" song was played when Grynyov made his 
appearance, and when Kuchma showed up he was greeted with 
"Aviator's March." O, Ukraine, the red beet country! 
  The MBR Grand Ball brought together more than 1,000 people. 
But the girls manning the tables where delegates from western 
Ukraine were registered seem unemployed; nor were there many 
people around tables assigned to central Ukraine. But those for 
the Left Bank, the South and the Crimea were swarming with 
people. The proceedings began with the throne speech by Leonid 
Kuchma. It was convoluted and long. The speaker announced that 
the process of building a state on national romanticism has been 
a failure and condemned the "manic reform movement." Then he 
developed a profound idea that some forces of darkness stuck a 
wedge between fraternal peoples and "knocked them out of the 
market". Having declared that the USPP-MBR block is as strong as 
ever, he offered a three-point program, consisting of 
stabilization, fundamental restructuring and a geopolitical 
course toward a union with Russia. Then he discussed regions and 
a federal structure. At the end, the speaker reassured the 
audience that "the election is not being left to its own 
devices." Immediately following was Balashov, the leader of the 
city's MBR, the head of the Political Initiative Center and the 
king of Dnepropetrovsk's pedestrian underpasses, which are 
filled with his stores. Getting to the heart of the matter off 
the bat, he declared that the first thing would be to get rid of 
Kravchuk and to elect a responsible president, and it was 
obvious who that would be. At that, both Grynyov and Kuchma 
smiled. After that came the best part. Mr. Balashov spelled out 
the path of reform. It was a very smart path, since it easily 
and quickly threw together everything: free circulation of all 
existing currencies combined with strict controls over the 
export of resources, a federal system combined with centrally 
allocated investment funds. At that point my neighbor, a member 
of the Liberal Democratic Party of Ukraine and a professional 
economist, turned very pale and inquired of no one in 
particular: "Lord, what is this nonsense?" 
  Then there was the usual: one speaker after another chewed 
over the few general ideas. Primarily, these were a federal 
structure, the introduction of Russian as a second state 
language and, of course, an "economic and political union" with 
Russia. They mentioned that union so often that our picket lines 
at the Supreme Council could easily have competed with them. The 
intensity of their wish for a union seemed to match Galicia's 
bitter hatred of it. Another theme was the need to kick out 
Kravchuk and to get in "our" president, with every third speaker 
complaining that the party in power would sabotage the elections 
and then introduce presidential rule. Blessing the podium with 
his presence was a special guest, a people's deputy to the 
Russian Duma, the head of the Budget and Planning Commission, 
who touchingly addressed the meeting as Brothers and immediately 
stated that "it is not the people who have decided to draw 
borders." Judging by the reaction in the audience, the portion 
of the people who gathered there in fact did not like borders. 
  Among other things, speakers proposed to transform the MBR 
into a party. Volodymyr Filenko, the PDVU leader, showed himself 
in the best light by announcing that he was ready to build such 
a party along with everybody else. Well, he is an experienced 
fellow: having built two parties already, the PDVU and the New 
Ukraine, he has not tired of it yet. 
  But the strangest thing was that this glorious bloc of 
reformers said almost nothing about the economy. There were some 
vague statements about the market for land and even more vague 
ones about privatization, but nothing concrete. In Galicia, it 
is our habit to criticize our dear National Democrats for their 
insufficiently developed economic programs. But life can be 
understood only by comparison. I suddenly realized that next to 
the MBR conference, Pynzenchyk, Chernyak, Shandryuk and Zlupko 
together with Pylypchuk, and even our oblast assemblage of Rukh, 
URP and New Wave adherents, are a veritable economic academy. 
The only person who disturbed the calm and quickly became 
distasteful to the high and mighty Grynyov-Kuchma gathering was 
Serbin, the construction minister, who began to introduce overly 
concrete proposals on the economy, infusing a dissonant note 
into the proceedings. He left the podium amidst sarcastic 
silence. 
  At the end of two sittings the situation was sufficiently 
clarified. Mr.Grynyov moved that candidates for deputies sign 
forms declaring that they represented the MBR, which was a type 
of pledge which carried all of the bloc's principles on the 
obverse. There were some arguments about them: apparently, 
disagreement centered on the formulation "demanding a 
federal-regional structure for Ukraine." But everyone wanted 
bilingualism, and immediately. As to the Union, everything went 
smoothly in this area. The same was true about the economy; 
apparently, no one even bothered to read that part. 
  Adventures started only during the press conference. 
Responding to questions, Kuchma ardently defended federalism and 
the regions, but then suddenly declared that he did not like the 
regional economic experiment in the Donetsk-Dniestr region. 
After that, following half an hour of holding forth by Grynyov 
about the market for land and private land ownership, it turned 
out that Kuchma believes that the most promising economic 
structure in agriculture is the kolkhoz. Things got even more 
jolly when Grynyov and Kuchma were asked who of the two of them 
would be president. To this, Volodymyr Borysovych replied that 
they might find a third and split it three ways. In the 
presidium, there was a third man, Balashov, the king of 
pedestrian underpasses, and this suggestion caused much hilarity 
in the audience; it only grew when Balashov, the number one 
specialist in buying and selling issues, began to hold forth 
about the importance of the producer. A healthy journalistic 
laughter greeted Leonid Kuchma's reaction to the question about 
the connection between the MBR an the Civic Congress. To his 
credit, Leonid Danylovych found no appropriate lie but blushed 
and muttered: "Yes." It is always a pleasure to see a real 
person, especially if it is your fellow-Ukrainian, suffering 
from a desperate case of the "little brother" syndrome. 
  Emboldened, we too asked Grynyov whether he understands that 
the MBR's platform starts an open conflict in Ukraine. I hope 
that Volodymyr Borysovych will forgive me, but his response was 
like a hedgehog in the fog: in general, he fears confrontation, 
but sticks a conflict on the outside. 
  It is not difficult to sum up the second MBR conference. A 
force representing western and southern Ukraine, and partially 
the Center and the Trans-Carpathian region, has been formally 
organized and will take the field before 1 December. It 
functions much more elegantly than the crude Bloc-239, and in 
general it is much better packaged. These are no odious Commies 
but very polite gentlemen. They all have education, money and 
image. They are the old economic bosses and other nomenklatura, 
of course, but in the past four years the old first, second and 
even third party secretaries and their entourage have become 
completely acceptable pros, now labeled as pragmatic reformers, 
bankers and entrepreneurs. The dream candidates for the 
Russified East. 
  Perhaps the reader already feels horrified and is getting 
ready for a military confrontation on the banks of the Zbruch. 
But let us not rush, since I have saved the best for last. The 
most interesting thing about the MBR gathering was not who was 
there but who was not. Thus, there was not a single person from 
Markulov's Liberal Party, which has considerable influence in 
Donetsk. There was no one from the Liberal Democratic Party of 
Ukraine, which is very popular around Kharkov. There was 
Retelnish, but as an observer; they summed up the event 
laconically as a "gathering of the political dead." There were 
no regional PDVU organizations from Odessa, Lugansk, western 
Ukraine and many central oblasts. More than a dozen of regional 
civic organizations from the South and East were missing, 
ranging from the Kharkov Professional Union to the Odessa Forum, 
which are very influential in their own oblasts. The 
Constitutional Democrats and many others were absent, as well. 
Dnepropetrovsk's major powers that be, their highnesses the 
directors, were not present. I purposefully go through the 
entire Russian-speaking political spectrum of the East and 
South, without mentioning an Ukrainian-speaking parties, 
centrists or rightists; let us be realistic, they are rather 
weak there. Finally, ABSENT was the uncrowned king of 
Russian-speaking free-market reformers of Ukraine and the god of 
the liberal camp, Volodymyr Lanovoy. 
  Their absence is very telling. It indicates a process that 
has been going on quietly for three years. The Russified East 
has split in two. Some, although continuing to insist on their 
Russian language and even ethnicity, no longer want to joint the 
one indivisible Mother-Russia. The problem is that the dear land 
stinks: it has Zhirinovskiy, chaos and confusion. It also likes 
to pick others' pockets, which nobody likes. So they worry about 
facing a home-grown Karabakh and want no federations or unions. 
At the most, they want a supply of concrete inputs for their 
factories. A stamp in the passport and Ukraine citizenship are 
gradually becoming a reality for them. It is interesting that 
the Russian-speaking intellectual elites have joined this camp. 
  Meanwhile, our dear nomenklatura, true to form, is marching 
toward its coveted Russian shore, which is natural: folks of 
their own kind are there, perhaps turned from red to white, pink 
and even crimson, but their own kind none the less.

<F P=106> [Interview with Vladimir Stanislavovich Novitskyy, Ukrainian </F>
first deputy minister of industry, by Natalya Svichkolap; date 
and place not given: "The Chemical Industry Workers' 
Disorganized Present; They Are Unraveling the `Gordian Knots' of 
Accumulated Problems and Making Plans for Tomorrow and...for the 
Period up to the End of the Century"] 
  [Text] In the heat of ambition and the triumphal 
"funeral service" for the old order, we almost threw another 
baby out with the bath water, confusing the Western economists 
who could not understand why we are so averse to planning. 
Without plans, after all, we cannot make our way through the 
thickets of the market, and regardless of how allergic a certain 
segment of our population might be to the very word "plan," the 
facts are these: No enterprise or industry in the West can even 
consider its future existence without forecasts. In addition, 
there is also short-term, medium-term, and strategic 
planning--for 10-20 years in advance. 
  Today in our country, God himself has commanded us to 
shape up, as the saying goes. Let us take a look at the chemical 
complex, for example. No branch of the national economy can 
develop without the use of modern chemical products. 
Incidentally, for the sake of comparison, their share of the 
total industrial product is 12 percent in Germany and 9 percent 
in the United States, but in our country the figure decreased by 
20 percent in the last four years and now amounts to 5.1 
percent. The present structure of the Ukrainian chemical 
industry as a whole does not meet modern requirements and cannot 
satisfy the country's needs. The reasons are well-known: Just a 
few years ago our chemical complex was part of the union 
complex, with quite intense cooperation by enterprises. Today we 
are disentangling ourselves from this interdependence, but we do 
not have the raw materials for the production of several 
important commodities (we receive 80 percent of them from 
Russia), and we are not producing some of the main basic 
resources--rubber, styrene, aniline, and others. We are also 
feeling the effects of disparate technological goals, the low 
percentage of state-of-the-art technologies and production 
units, the considerable depreciation of fixed assets (up to 60 
percent), and the obsolete technology. 
  That is why structural changes in the chemical complex 
have to be considered now. What will the Ukrainian chemical 
industry look like in the near future? The editors asked 
Ukrainian First Deputy Minister of Industry V.S. Novitskyy to 
answer this question and several others. 
  [Svichkolap] Vladimir Stanislavovich, now that actual events 
are surpassing all expectations, and now that any kind of reform 
can be expected at any time, I think that one of the things we 
have to do is express our appreciation for the courage of the 
people who are deciding the development strategy for the 
chemical complex. Please tell us how this massive task began. 
  [Novitskyy] There is no question that we are living in a 
difficult time, but you will agree that any system has to make 
plans and predictions and evaluate its own performance before it 
can develop. A complex as huge as the chemical industry 
naturally requires the best possible development model and a 
corresponding program of action. We began by analyzing the 
degree to which our industry can meet our country's need for 
chemical products. We learned that we are satisfying some of the 
national economy's requirements--for nitrogen fertilizer, for 
example. On the other hand, we are not producing some extremely 
necessary products. Our analysis indicated gaps in technological 
chains: We have the raw materials and the final products, but 
the semimanufactured products are in other CIS countries. We 
calculated how much of each of these products we need and where 
the gaps in the chains have to be repaired and now we will start 
building the kind of structure that will satisfy all of our 
country's needs. We are certain that the chemical complex will 
recover all foreign currency investments. 
  [Svichkolap] That is a bold prediction in view of today's 
deficit in the balance of exports and imports. 
  [Novitskyy] Yes, but one of our primary objectives is a 
positive balance, and one of the main ways of achieving this 
will entail energy conservation. We are lagging far behind the 
Western countries in this respect. 
  [Svichkolap] There are so many different methods of 
industrial restructuring in world experience, some of which have 
gone so far as to suspend the operations of selected facilities 
and eliminate whole industries. Which method have you chosen? 
  [Novitskyy] Our plans for the development of the chemical 
complex include fundamental strategic guidelines, and we have 
drawn up a program of action on this basis. It stipulates the 
main stages of the process, the cost of carrying out each stage, 
and the deadlines for the completion of the work. This, however, 
does not mean that we will not be making adjustments as time 
goes on. We can expect changes in the economy, in our 
approaches, and in the prices of energy resources and many types 
of raw materials. We can adjust to all of these circumstances. 
  The process of restructuring in the Western countries 
occurred back in the 1960s when there was an abundant supply of 
chemical products. We, on the other hand, are experiencing 
shortages of almost everything. This is why we are taking a 
different approach: Although the whole chemical complex is 
slated for dynamic development, we will make a more intense 
effort in some areas. The operations of whole production units 
could have been halted in those areas, but we do not need this, 
even though we might have some excess capacities for the 
production of ammonia and nitrogen fertilizers today. These are 
among Ukraine's main exports. 
  It is true that the current prices of natural gas virtually 
preclude the profitable, and even lucrative, export of products. 
for this reason, one of our main objectives today is the 
reduction of the energy and material requirements of our 
production units. We drew up a program for this purpose, and it 
is already being implemented. Ammonia production units, for 
example, are being modernized, and this project will do much to 
reduce proportional expenditures of natural gas and other 
resources and thereby lower the overhead costs of production. 
  The program envisages the extraction and processing of four 
to five times as much potassium ore, the development of 
phosphorite deposits, the stabilization of the sulfur output, 
and the development of new lime deposits. For the time being, 
however, Ukraine's need for phosphorus fertilizers can be 
satisfied only with the use of phosphorus raw materials from 
Russia. 
  [Svichkolap] Yes, but for several well-known reasons our 
relations with Russia are regrettably "thorny." We live in a 
dynamic world, however, and if we are having difficulty 
acquiring raw materials from Russia, why not buy them from, for 
instance, the countries of Northwest Africa? 
  [Novitskyy] At this time the shipments of apatite from the 
Kola Peninsula are the most preferable option from the economic 
standpoint. The African phosphorites are inferior in quality and 
are not any cheaper. Even this option has been considered, 
however, and can be employed at any time. 
  Now we have begun producing phosphorus fertilizers. We will 
need around 600,000 tonnes of apatite by the spring sowing 
season to satisfy the needs of agriculture. If our enterprises 
work constantly, without any interruptions, we expect to satisfy 
minimum agricultural requirements. 
  A big conference of the heads of oblast organizations of the 
Ministry of Agriculture and the managers of Ministry of Industry 
enterprises was held a few days ago. We reached an agreement on 
the whole group of issues connected with fertilizer supplies. 
  [Svichkolap] Vladimir Stanislavovich, at the last meeting of 
the Union of Industrialists and Entrepreneurs, the director 
complained that Ukrainian enterprises are selling materials and 
products at prices exceeding world prices within our country and 
at one-third to one-fourth the cost abroad. Does this apply to 
the chemical complex as well? 
  [Novitskyy] I have to admit that I do not know exactly what 
he was talking about. We do have problems of competitiveness 
with some of the products of the chemical industry. In other 
words, our expenditures are sometimes higher than the world 
prices of these products. We are essentially selling carbamide 
and ammonia at a zero profit margin, for example, but only at 
the present exchange rate of the dollar. The official exchange 
rate of the dollar to the karbovanets today is not an accurate 
reflection of their value and is a problem throughout industry. 
The exchange rate is obviously too low for the exporter. Here is 
the situation: It is best for the exporter to have the highest 
possible exchange rate, but the importer who buys raw materials 
would prefer the opposite--a lower exchange rate. We need a 
comprehensive assessment of this situation, and we certainly 
need the regulation of the rate, even if the state has to become 
involved in this. The rate has to change in response to changes 
in the economic and financial situation. Otherwise, we run the 
risk of misalignment. An exchange rate that is too low 
discourages exports, and the consequences can be quite severe: 
We will lose the market. If our products are not there, the 
vacuum will be filled quickly by another supplier, and then it 
will be extremely difficult to break into the market again. This 
calls for a balanced and reasonable approach, so that we do not 
put too much pressure on our own exporters or on the producers 
using imported raw materials. This is done in the stock exchange 
in every other country, but our situation is more complex. That 
is why we cannot get along without government regulation. 
  [Svichkolap] Any plan can be implemented when enterprises 
are 
operating and science is making progress, but our country is in 
a pitiful state. How will it be possible to act on even the best 
intentions when everyone here is insolvent? 
  [Novitskyy] You are right. This is a difficult situation. 
Science has suffered most of all. The cost of maintaining 
project planning and research institutes and design bureaus has 
risen, but the need for scientific and products (however 
paradoxical this might sound) has decreased. There is not enough 
working capital to pay for contracted projects. We are trying to 
find a solution. We set up innovation and economic regulation 
funds. They are being used to finance the scientific and 
technical programs of institutes. These funds are understandably 
inadequate. The institutes are working directly with 
enterprises, but even these possibilities are limited because 
the enterprises are also suffering from a shortage of funds. 
  As far as the general situation in the chemical complex is 
concerned, it was always difficult even in the past. It became 
critical, however, in the first months of this year. The abrupt 
rise in energy prices literally drove the enterprises to their 
knees, and this was followed by a period of sharp cuts in gas 
shipments, when we had to suspend continuous production 
processes. Now they are being started up again. Officials in 
Moscow have agreed to continue shipping gas to us in the same 
quantities as before until 11 April and to make up for 80 
percent of the gas shipments we are not getting from 
Turkmenistan. 
  We are still racking our brains, however, over the two main 
shortages--of working capital and hard currency. The shortage of 
hard currency could be alleviated by increasing exports and 
reducing imports, but the reduction of imports would presuppose 
the production of the same goods in our country or the reduced 
consumption of some imports. This would call for efforts in many 
different areas. As far as working capital is concerned, we have 
calculated that the shortage of working capital at enterprises 
of the Ministry of Industry exceeds 10 trillion karbovantsy. 
Under these conditions, even successful enterprises will be 
bankrupted by the next rise in prices. It is understandable, 
therefore, that the problem of supplementing our working capital 
must be solved on the governmental level, perhaps not in its 
entirety, but at least for 70 percent of the total amount 
required. Otherwise, the shortage of working capital will result 
in the instability of all industry. 
  [Svichkolap] Do you believe that structural changes in the 
chemical complex can make a difference even in this "overheated" 
economy? 
  [Novitskyy] I am certain that Ukraine is not suffering from 
a 
terminal illness. We have enough intelligent minds, working 
hands, undeveloped mineral deposits, and the wish to make our 
country rich. We have the potential to satisfy light industry's 
need for chemical fibers and filaments and to develop the 
aniline dye industry. The program envisages a considerable 
increase in the output of plastic and synthetic resins (steps 
have already been taken to remodel some production units and 
build some new ones). We plan to modernize and augment our 
capacities for the production of household chemicals, the active 
base of medications, and superpure substances for 
radioelectronics. Our plans also assign special priority to the 
environment. 
  In conclusion, I want to say that the work on the program 
will achieve the restructuring of the chemical complex, fill the 
market with new chemical products, secure the steady work of 
enterprises, minimize the dependence of this work on shipments 
of raw materials and semimanufactured products from the CIS 
countries and distant foreign countries, reduce energy 
consumption considerably, and result in a positive export-import 
balance by the year 2000.

<H5>  The Situation </H5>
  Features in the portrait of Pasha--the new migrant 
worker and strikebreaker 
  "I sold myself for rubles"--my casual fellow-traveler 
uttered this phrase on the train with cheerful defiance and 
slyness. The word "myself" here has significance--for Pasha, a 
young miner from Sverdlovsk in Lugansk Oblast, did not bring 
Ukrainian sausage to Russia, but his own hands... Foreign 
workers and migrant workers, just like the problems associated 
with them, have existed for a long time and continue to exist. 
For us, both more or less free movement and the "fresh" state 
borders are a new phenomenon. I was interested in this firsthand 
information. After all, it is not a question of a single 
incident but of a system. 
  Miners from Ukrainian border towns are applying as whole 
crews to work in Russia's mines. No, there are no recruiters 
coming here (in any case, not widely), and they are not spending 
time on persuasion. The ruble is sufficient agitation; that is, 
its real purchasing power in Russia and the appreciable 
difference in the rate of exchange, which in Ukraine makes it 
possible for owners of rubles to feel more like a white person. 
And in the meantime our economy will remain a pathetic 
cripple--we will serve on a level with third world countries as 
a source of cheap manpower. 
  Why cheap? No, it has not yet reached the point of paying 
Ukrainian miners lower rates. The advantage is in something 
else. The more Ukrainian crews there are in Russian mines, the 
more stability there is, according to the employers. Since the 
ruble is worth more for us, less rubles are required: Ukrainian 
crews do not intend to strike, and do not demand wage increases, 
in contrast to their Russian colleagues. The presence of 
strike-breakers (it is called precisely that), naturally, 
assuages the appetites of the locals. But the strike-breakers, 
as is known, are not liked... Pasha agrees with this claim. 
There have been no disputes yet at the mine where he worked. But 
neighboring Ukrainians are beginning to be persecuted a little; 
for example, time after time their clothes are cut up when they 
leave them in the changing room. 
  From the standpoint of civilized state concepts, Pasha and 
his comrades live a strange life at the coal face. Twice a day, 
before the start and at the end of a shift, they cross the state 
border. And, therefore, is it possible, strictly speaking, to 
apply the term "migrant worker" to them? A migrant worker, after 
all, is a temporary or a permanent emigrant. That is, by 
transporting his manpower across the border, he is also 
transporting the problems associated with the establishment of 
an infrastructure that is necessary for his residency, medical 
treatment, cultural relaxation, and education and preschool 
instruction for his children. In our case, Ukraine is being 
transformed into a weekend bedroom area. But the taxes, which 
are obliged to go to maintain and develop the infrastructure, 
remain in Russia. 
  It is a strange life. Not only with regard to these global 
and state problems, which Pasha came to generate without 
realizing it. This is his daily life. After all, a person, no 
matter what level of social consciousness he finds himself, is a 
political subject of his own country. Pasha has no country. In 
no case professing deliberate anti-Ukrainian attitudes, when 
talking about prices or the possibility of buying one or another 
commodity he absolutely sincerely says about Russia "in our 
country," and about Ukraine--"in your country." After all, when 
you calculate it, he spends a large part of his time abroad. 
Pasha could not answer when the next elections will be held in 
Ukraine. In addition, as you know, he has not been deprived of 
his right to vote. Some homebred migrant workers skip voting, 
thereby helping "the party in power" to wreck the elections. But 
some... (For whom will those of them who come to the ballot box 
nevertheless vote?) 
  It also should not be claimed that, in the person of Pasha's 
colleagues, Russia has acquired conscientious supporters with 
some kind of political course of their own. Except... "Everyone 
in our mine is for Zhirinovskiy," Pasha told me, without 
explaining very distinctly precisely why. He considers Yeltsin 
to be a Mason. Pasha does not know just what a "Mason" is, and 
he does not use this term beratingly, but simply thinks it is a 
sign of some kind of force. He has an even more original opinion 
about all the rest of the Russian authorities. Blushing in a 
youthful way, Pasha put it this way: "You understand, they all 
love men more." 
  He reports all these "secrets" with good-natured 
indifference. Neither Yeltsin nor any other Russian powers that 
be prevent Pasha from earning the rubles that are so necessary. 
He heard that starting this year the Russian Government is 
imposing some kind of additional tax on mines that employ 
foreign manpower. (This is quite logical; after all, emigrants 
take jobs from Russian citizens.) Pasha feels the same 
indifference toward the president of his own country--he does 
not want to either support or reelect him. He also does not 
associate his daily problems with him and with possible changes 
in Ukrainian policy: "Kravchuk generally remains silent about 
us." 
  The buses sent by Russian mines go through two customs 
points 
each shift (a deduction is made from the Ukrainian miners' wages 
for this service, but the work is profitable, nonetheless). 
Customs officials are convinced that they are not dealing with 
profiteers or shifty traders: "What do we take with us--a 
miner's lunch box and a washcloth and soap?" Well, and just like 
real proletariat, the main wealth that they take away from our 
country is their manpower. I do not blame their owners for quite 
understandable reasons. On top of all of this, Pasha is earning 
his rubles the hard way. It does not have to be explained to 
anyone who knows the labor of an "underground hostage"--the 
miner. Anyone who has not tried it personally has read 
government condolences to the families of those who perished at 
a mine face, and is familiar with statistics on illnesses. The 
working conditions and level of safety of our native Pasha, 
alas, have nothing good to distinguish them either in Ukraine or 
Russia. 
  The buses roll along. Such is the reality today, and if 
anyone reading this thinks that the whole point is the absence 
of barbed wire on the border, he is mistaken. For seven decades 
attempts were made to cure us of the desire to live like human 
beings with barbed wire and a short leash. If our money becomes 
money, if our mines will become less like graves than the 
Russian ones, and if in the end another dozen urgent "if's" are 
realized that are possible only given radical reformation of the 
economy (and this means that people come to power who are 
capable of this), Pasha will gladly forego the long trip with 
all its attendant consequences: material, civic, and patriotic. 
  There is also something to think about in light of today's 
situation. How to regulate the piratical "semi-export" of our 
manpower? How to arrive at a point where the Russian side does 
not just skim off the cream but also frees something for the 
miserable budget of the miners' settlements where the workers 
live and pay taxes to it? In addition, how to function so that 
Pasha knows that his native state is "concerned" about him? I 
have no answers to these questions--the statesmen should have 
the professional answers. If, of course, not all of them feel 
like absolute favorites in a country under whose flag they like 
to show off at official receptions.

<F P=106> [Interview with Vasiliy Alekseyevich Tsyuroy, first deputy </F>
chief of Vinytsya Oblast State Administration and head of oblast 
department of agriculture and food, by Nikolay Baras; date and 
place not given: "Does a Nation Have a Future When Its Rural 
Communities Are in the Throes of Agony?"] 
  [Text] The answer seems obvious. Can we expect 
Ukraine to have a future without serious changes in its rural 
communities? Can we move ahead in the market reforms and abandon 
these communities to be torn apart by central and local 
bureaucrats and to be destroyed by their own inner conflicts? 
  Some kind of inner framework is still preventing the 
total ruin of the agrarian sector. Is it possible that the 
safety margin has not been depleted? 
  My conversation with Vasiliy Tsyuroy, first deputy 
chief of the Vinytsya Oblast State Administration and head of 
the oblast department of agriculture and food, began with these 
questions. 
  "All of that is true," Vasiliy Alekseyevich said. "Although 
the rural communities are on their last legs, they are still 
pulling the wobbly cart of our economy. No one else is pulling 
it--not the coal miners, the power engineers, or the machine 
builders, who are accustomed to treating even minor problems as 
absolute disasters. The rural communities are pulling the cart, 
and they are doing it in silence, possibly because they are 
aware of their duty and responsibility to the state.... 
  "Do you remember all of the recent cases of the overt and 
covert deception of the rural communities? In response, they 
produced a harvest that broke almost all previous records! The 
farmers in the oblast produced, for example, 2.9 million tonnes 
of grain (the third highest yield in oblast history), more than 
530,000 tonnes of sugar, more sunflowers, vegetables, and fruit 
than in recent years, and much more meat, dairy products, and 
various canned goods. 
  "What did the peasants get in return? Not money, or 
equipment, or fertilizer, or gasoline or diesel fuel. Once 
again, they got nothing. But we are depleting their safety 
margin. When the long-suffering peasants' patience runs out, 
this will break the last cord that is keeping our rickety 
economy afloat." 
  [Baras] Vasiliy Alekseyevich, Vinytsya Oblast has a special 
agrarian status in the republic. People have good reason to call 
it the "great granary" and the "sugar Donbass" of Ukraine. It is 
no secret that the oblast annually produces 14-15 percent of 
Ukraine's sugar, which is an extremely valuable, almost 
strategic product for our state. It accounts for an equally 
substantial share of the whole Ukrainian harvest and the output 
of meat, milk, fruit.... Is this not a strong argument for the 
government, the legislators, and the financiers?... 
  [Tsyuroy] You know, this is one of those cases in which they 
are sawing off the branch on which they are seated. It does not 
take much of a brain to realize that you have to invest money if 
you want to develop production and get a bigger yield, but they 
are telling us that the state is too poor to invest in the rural 
community. At this time, you see, it cannot extend any credit to 
the agrarian sector either, because this would escalate 
inflationary processes. But can it at least pay for the work 
that has already been done? Apparently, it cannot do this either. 
  Then what can the peasant rely on, if the state will not 
keep 
its promises, fulfill its obligations and agreements, or abide 
by its laws? Sugar refineries are now paying kolkhozes and motor 
vehicle enterprises in sugar, but the prices are set in Kiev. 
But why? Why should the Cabinet of Ministers, "Ukrsakhar," 
"Ukrmyaso," and other such bureaucratic superstructures, which 
essentially have not even lifted a finger to give the agrarian 
sector in the oblast a sense of state priorities, have total 
control over the results of peasant labor? Yes, we realize that 
these are state requisitions and that they have to be used to 
pay for petroleum products and other such resources, but who 
said that we have to give them to the state for free? How can 
there be any arguments about priorities when the state has 
treated and is still treating the rural communities so 
unscrupulously?! 
  Tomorrow it will be time to go back into the fields. How 
will 
each peasant feel when he gets to the grain or beet field?! How 
can we explain to the machine operator that the state does not 
give a damn, to put it bluntly, whether or not the equipment is 
ready for the spring season?! I could talk about many things 
that are hindering the development of the agrarian sector and 
the whole oblast economy. They include the high percentage of 
farming products in the structure of the gross agricultural 
product, which requires higher material and labor expenditures. 
They also include the excessive plowing of the land (the ratio 
of plowed fields to all agricultural land is 17 percent above 
the republic average), which leads to erosion and to ecological 
and social problems. They also include the aging of our 
equipment, which is becoming increasingly difficult to replace 
or repair.... All of these things are naturally being discussed 
by the peasants today, and all of them create problems for us, 
but no one is listening to us.... 
  [Baras] Nevertheless, even after political battles have 
caused many statesmen to lose their senses, life in the rural 
community goes on. In fact, it was able to enter a new phase of 
economic and agrarian reform during this difficult time. As far 
as I know, various forms of ownership are being established in 
the oblast, stock and shares are being issued in agricultural 
enterprises, some are being incorporated.... Many people, 
however, are worried about the future of the rural community. 
Will the prevailing form of ownership be collective or private? 
  [Tsyuroy] Judging by all indications, collective farms will 
still be prevalent in the agrarian sector in the next few years. 
This is not a result of the conservative thinking of the farm 
chairmen, who supposedly do not want change. The fact is that 
kolkhozes and sovkhozes, with their infrastructure, 
microclimate, and production and consumer relations, represent 
the whole rural world, and their sudden elimination would be 
impossible and dangerous. 
  People sometimes tell us that we conservative peasants are 
impeding reform. But why would they say that? We now have 677 
kolkhozes, 85 interfarm enterprises, 114 sovkhozes, and 723 
family farms in the oblast. I think the last figure could be 
several times greater if all of the declarative statements of 
legislators in reference to family farms could have been backed 
up by some material content. Even then, however, their 
contribution to the gross agricultural product would be 
negligible. 
  On the other hand, the reform of the agrarian sector 
presupposes not only the development of the family farm, but 
also the conversion of collective farms. The administrators of 
these farms are using several different methods: Some are 
issuing stock in the farms, some are dividing the property and 
the land into shares, and the kolkhoz in Lipovka in 
Tomashpolskiy Rayon, which is headed by Ukrainian People's 
Deputy Nikolay Melnik, has been turned into a corporation. What 
all of these methods have in common is that the peasant has 
become the owner of part of the property and land of the kolkhoz 
and earns dividends for their use and a regular wage for his 
work. Meanwhile, all of the peasants on a single farm are still 
the collective owners of the property, which has allowed them to 
retain their customary way of life. 
  What will happen in the future? If current processes 
continue 
in a non-coercive manner, the private and collective principles 
eventually will converge in the rural community. What I mean is 
that the interests of the peasant owner will be manifested more 
and more clearly on the collective farms, and the wish to unite 
in associations, unions, or firms performing specific services 
for farms on the basis of mutual interest and advantage will 
grow stronger on the family farms. This, incidentally, does not 
exclude the possibility of the coexistence of kolkhozes and 
family farms in their pure form. 
  The processor of agricultural products works hand in hand 
with the producer. On the one hand, the oblast has 1,600 farms 
producing grain, sugar beets, and animal husbandry products, and 
on the other it has a food industry and processing industry 
constituting almost half of the oblast industrial sector. We 
could ask who makes a bigger contribution to the final 
output--the producer or the processor? Specialists have 
calculated that the labor of the rural producer represents from 
70 to 90 percent of the value of the final product, but it is 
usually the processor who comes out ahead in mutual settlements. 
Not by his own design, of course, but through the good graces of 
"Ukrsakhar," "Ukrmyaso," and other such organizations and with 
the blessing of the Cabinet of Ministers and the legislators. In 
other words, the state is still imposing its own rules of play 
and deliberately putting partners in unequal positions. What 
kind of market relations are these? It is just another way of 
fleecing the rural community! 
  [Baras] Yes, the rural community is in the throes of agony, 
along with the rest of our economy, but tomorrow it will be time 
to go back into the fields, and the grain farmer will not give 
up even in the face of futility. Will he really have to use the 
last bit of his strength to prove that Ukraine cannot survive 
without grain? Is there really no other method of keeping the 
rural community alive? 
  [Tsyuroy] Reform. That is the only solution--the development 
of different forms of ownership, competition between them, 
purposeful state investments, the establishment of a balanced 
processing structure, and the institution of genuine market 
relations, and not relations controlled by Kiev--these are the 
means of rural recovery. 
  On the other hand, we can rely on reform, but we also have 
to 
do our part. The peasant has to begin by giving up the 
expectation that the rural community will get equipment, spare 
parts, and petroleum products from central supplies. Otherwise, 
we will have no hope of emerging from this quandary. 
  We are trying not to tempt fate. In the last two years the 
oblast assumed almost all of the responsibility for supplying 
the agrarian sector with spare parts, fertilizer, herbicides, 
and petroleum products. We will continue to do this. Equipment 
is a bigger problem because it has to come from Russia or 
Belarus. We managed to find a solution to this as well, however: 
Several dozen different types of machines and mechanisms, 
including silage harvesters, beet harvesters, and universal 
reels, and different accessories and spare parts will be 
produced here--at oblast enterprises, including those that 
worked for the military establishment of the former union. 
  We have no other alternative at this time.

<F P=106> [Unattributed report: "An Unregulated Market and Unregulated </F>
in Kharkov: Ukraine's First Real-Estate Market Has Been Set Up 
in Kharkov"] 
  [Text] To set up a real-estate market and put it into good 
working order turned out to be not such an easy matter, even 
though Ukraine's exchange structures worked on the plan of 
"attack" for nearly three months. Born in travail like the very 
noisy land auction, the market was attended by only a few 
buyers, and this despite the fact that the commodity being 
offered was fast-moving and even had pretensions to high 
quality. If someone had the desire and--of course--the money, he 
could buy a building here, or a dacha, apartment, or garage in 
various parts of Ukraine and the near abroad. The organizers 
exhibited for sale everything that they could, even their own 
intellect and a material-technical center--offering various 
consulting services, transportation, and electronic equipment. A 
sense of orderliness and respectability, a minimum of risk and 
burdensome paperwork--one could not say that this was a legally 
unregulated market. 
  Nevertheless, it is the latter that potential buyers seem to 
prefer. For a market that was well advertised, three lots 
constitute just a drop in the ocean--not calculated to created 
any changes in the weather. The reason is well known. For a long 
time now well-to-do citizens have been buying up everything that 
they need; they have gotten around the existing laws, and for 
these covert trades they neither want nor need the help of any 
"glittering" advertisement. For all other citizens--whether the 
commodities in question are offered at a wide-open bazaar or a 
civilized market--they are beyond their pocketbooks. The result 
is lamentable. For the first time in half a century offerings 
exceeded demand in the Kharkov real-estate market, and this 
despite the fact that the housing problem remains one of the 
most acute in this city. 
  But we have not yet become accustomed to the paradoxes 
involved here. One of these is the position assumed by the 
Kharkov Procurator's Office, which has continued to "bombard" 
the local Executive Committee with paper-type protests. The 
motif is impressive in its banality. Existing laws do not permit 
land and real estate to be offered on a lease-type basis. 
But--when all is said and done--such a practice is not 
prohibited. This argument is persistently used to cover and 
protect themselves by the local authorities, while proceeding to 
prepare new trading places at the same time. Who will prevail? 
This is not just a rhetorical question, inasmuch as the Kharkov 
Commodity Exchange is not limited by prices, and sheds a glaring 
light on the long-existing opposition between common sense and 
narrowly bureaucratic interests. The old system has already 
taken everything possible from life, but it continues to keep 
the society in a state of deep unconsciousness. The real-estate 
market--like the first land auction--has not lived up to its 
promise of assistance; nevertheless, it has introduced a vital 
stream of hope into a seemingly hopeless situation. From now on 
trades on the KhTB [Kharkov Commodity Exchange] will be 
conducted with at least something to trade.

<F P=106> [Article by Vitaliy Tsigankov: "With Thoughts of the USSR </F>
and Socialism: Republic Residents Prefer Private Property"] 
  [Text] In November-December 1993 the Independent Institute 
for Socioeconomic and Political Research (NISEPI) conducted a 
national poll under the title "Life in Our Times-2" (the first 
poll was conducted by the institute in 1992 and its results are 
also quoted for comparison). In a nationwide sample, 1,148 
persons representing the entire adult population of the republic 
were polled. Six parameters were controlled in conducting the 
survey: gender, age, education, distribution of workers by 
economic sector, residence (rural or urban), and distribution of 
the population by oblast. The maximum statistical error of the 
sample is 5 percent. 
  The survey results show first and foremost that the 
population of Belarus, to put it mildly, is not entirely 
knowledgeable about some socioeconomic notions, sometimes 
selecting something that would be resolutely denied in the reply 
to the next question. The very first question: "Which would you 
choose: a market or a planned economy?" brought rather typical 
replies (by the way, almost identical to those in 1992). A 
market economy was supported by 54 percent, a planned one--by 43 
percent. But replies to another question: "What system is most 
suitable for Belarus?" present a completely different picture. 
"Capitalism"--31.6 percent, "socialism"--40.9 percent, 
"other"--13.7 percent, and 13.8 percent did not answer. Of 
course, the role of propaganda in such reactions is great. While 
even communists advocate a "moderate market," capitalism for 
many remains tantamount to cannibalism. This contradiction 
becomes even more obvious when we look at the answers to the 
question: "In your opinion, which form of ownership is more 
effective in the economic sense?" "Private"--52.8 percent, 
"state"--28 percent, a sensible combination of "state" and 
"private"--11.7 percent. It is a paradox, but among those who 
chose socialism, to the question "Do you consider private 
ownership in land acceptable in Belarus" 72.4 percent answered 
"yes", and 26.6 percent--"no." However, 78.2 percent--and 64.2 
percent in 1992--consider it impermissible for foreigners to own 
land, although the number of those who find it permissible also 
increased from 12.9 percent in 1992 to 20.3 percent in 1993. The 
no opinion share was 1.5 percent, in 1992--23 percent. Those who 
defined their financial situation as average comprised 39.7 
percent, below average--37.7 percent, poverty--17.7 percent, 
above average--3.8 percent, and high-income--0.4 percent. For 
67.6 percent the financial situation has worsened over the past 
two years, for 22.8 percent it has not changed, and for 9.4 
percent it has improved. Therefore it is probably not surprising 
that the number of persons who prefer free social services with 
low quality of service and without choice increased from 28.7 
percent in 1992 to 39 percent in 1993. At the same time, the 
number of those who prefer to have the ability and find it 
necessary to choose for their money social services of a 
suitable quality decreased from 68.8 percent to 59.6 percent. As 
to employment, the degree of insecurity is even greater. Low 
wages at a guaranteed job are preferred by 56.7 percent (49.1 
percent in 1992), while 40.6 percent (48.1 percent in 1992) 
would prefer high pay but with a high degree of risk of losing 
the job. It is amusing to observe the attitude of Belarus 
residents to speculation, which, in my opinion, is another 
paradox. A positive attitude toward speculation was registered 
by 9 percent; 19 percent were neutral; and the rest were 
negative to one extent or another. At the same time, 21 percent 
engage personally in reselling goods, that is, many more than 
those having a negative [as published] attitude to speculation. 
By the way, in answer to the question "Have you had a chance to 
participate in nonstate economic activities?" the figures do not 
differ dramatically from those in 1992, which probably is 
graphic evidence of the level of development of market relations 
in Belarus. For instance, 5.8 percent (3.9 percent in 1992) had 
bought securities; 2.4 percent (2.2 percent) owned a firm or an 
enterprise; 13.2 percent (5.5 percent in 1992) were working for 
hire in the nonstate sector; and 18.6 percent (12.1 percent in 
1992) were engaged in individual labor activities. 
  Finally, a cluster of political questions, the answers to 
which, to put it mildly, surprised many in Belarus. Restoration 
of the USSR is supported by 55.1 percent (47.9 percent in 1992), 
with 22.3 percent against (22 percent in 1992) and 22.3 percent 
with no opinion (29.5 percent in 1992). The creation of the CIS 
was seen as a stage on the former USSR republics' path to 
complete independence by 18.4 percent, as the ruin of a great 
state--by 39.3 percent, as a forced measure that has prevented a 
bloody form of disintegration--18.3 percent, and 23.8 percent 
had no opinion. New elections to the republic Supreme Soviet are 
supported by 68.8 percent. Those in favor of the presidency in 
Belarus comprise 43.3 percent (in 1992 only 28.2 percent). Hence 
a special interest in the rating of political parties, which the 
respondents were asked to indicate in answer to the question 
"Representatives of which political parties and movements in 
Belarus enumerated below will you vote for in the elections?" 
The top-rated party was the Belarusian People's Front (17.9 
percent), followed by two communist organizations--the Party of 
Communists of Belarus (10.5 percent) and the Movement for 
Democracy, Social Progress, and Justice (15.9 percent). Those 
are followed by two "right-wing" democratic parties--the 
Belarusian Peasants Party (10 percent) and the United Democratic 
Party of Belarus (5.4 percent). All in all, in the calculations 
of sociologists who organized the poll, 36 percent of potential 
voters cast their vote for the democratic flank in politics, 26 
percent support communists, and 11 percent--centrists, which is 
probably the greatest paradox of the public mind in Belarus. 
While voting for democratic parties and private property, 
Belarus residents are nevertheless nostalgic for the USSR and 
socialism.

<F P=106> [ARMENPRESS report: "NKR Has Always Shown Good Will"] </F>
  [Text] Commenting on the reports being disseminated in the 
mass media of Azerbaijan concerning 4,000 Azeri prisoners of war 
and hostages and gross violations of international laws 
committed against them by the Armenians, the chairman of the NKR 
[Nagorno-Karabakh Republic] commission for such questions, 
Aleksandr Agasaryan, noted that all of them, especially the 
statement from the chairman of the State Commission of the 
Azerbaijan Republic, Namik Abbasov, concerning experiments 
conducted on Azeri prisoners, were untrue. 
  This can be attested to by delegations from the 
International 
Red Cross organization "Physicians Without Borders," legal 
defenders, and jurists who had free access to all the places 
where the prisoners of war and hostages were kept. They can also 
confirm that all the Azeris who were released were in normal 
psychological and physical condition. Letters from their 
relatives were even delivered to them. 
  Incidentally, as A. Agasaryan noted, previously the NKR 
commission had suggested to its Azeri colleagues that it send 
the aforementioned commission to Karabakh to find out the real 
state of affairs. 
  The Azerbaijan side currently has about 1,000 Armenian 
prisoners of war and hostages who are mainly citizens of Russia, 
Ukraine, Belarus, and other CIS countries who were captured in 
the conflict zone. Many of them are being kept in nonstate 
institutions or are in the hands of private individuals, which 
extremely complicates the process of exchange. At the same time, 
representatives of international organizations accredited by the 
NKR are certainly not always given an opportunity to visit 
Armenian prisoners of war and hostages. 
  But, A. Agasaryan noted, in spite of all kinds of 
difficulties caused by the corresponding structures of the 
neighboring republic, the NKR government has repeatedly shown 
good will and adherence to the principles of coordination and 
compromise in solving problems of this area. This is also shown 
by the unilateral transfer of 69 prisoners of war and hostages 
to the Azerbaijan side.

<F P=106> [Article by press center of the Supreme Council of the </F>
Republic of Armenia: "Official Chronicle"] 
  [Text] The regular session of the Presidium of the Supreme 
Council of the Republic of Armenia was held under the 
chairmanship of the speaker of parliament, Babken Araktsyan. 
They considered drafts of a number of decrees submitted as 
legislative initiatives with the corresponding generalizations 
by chairmen of parliamentary commissions. In particular, the 
Presidium decided to propose for discussion at the regular 
three-day parliamentary session questions on making additions to 
the Supreme Council Decree "On Holidays and Memorial Days of the 
Republic of Armenia" and declaring 7 April to be a nonworking 
day for the celebration of maternity and beauty. 
  Then the Supreme Council Presidium drew up the agenda for 
the 
three-day parliamentary sessions that will take place through 30 
March. It included mainly questions carried over from preceding 
sessions. Additionally, the Presidium considered it expedient to 
place on the agenda the question of the rules for adoption of 
the Constitution of the Republic of Armenia. Having raised the 
question of the legally established elections of two members of 
the board of the Central Bank of the Republic of Armenia, the 
Supreme Council Presidium by a secret vote elected candidates 
from those submitted by the Commission on Financial-Tax and 
Budget Questions of the Supreme Council of the Republic of 
Armenia and approved Vardan Bostandzhyan as a member of the 
board of the Central Bank of the Republic of Armenia. 
  At the session they also discussed the question of the 
studies conducted by the Supreme Council Commission on Questions 
of Economic Independence and Development of the Economy in the 
System of the Ministry of Light Industry of the Republic of 
Armenia. In this connection the chairman of the commission, 
Ruben Torosyan, familiarized the Supreme Council Presidium with 
the conclusions presented by the work group created for the 
purpose of studying complaints directed against parliament and, 
on behalf of the commission, suggested raising for discussion of 
the Supreme Council the draft of the corresponding decree. 
  Clarifications were also presented at the meeting by the 
Minister of Light Industry of the Republic of Armenia Rudolf 
Teymurazyan. After debating this issue and reaching a positive 
evaluation, the Presidium decreed that the question of reviewing 
R. Teymurazyan's appointment to the position of minister of 
light industry of the Republic of Armenia be placed on the 
overall agenda. 
  Then a report on the course of the fulfillment of the 
instructions given by decrees of the Supreme Council to the 
government and permanent commissions of parliament was presented 
by the secretary of the Supreme Council, Varazdat Avoyan. The 
Supreme Council Presidium adopted a decree regarding this issue 
as well. 
  Discussing the question of the report from the government of 
the Republic of Armenia in connection with implementation of the 
program for socioeconomic development of the Republic of Armenia 
in 1993, the Supreme Council Presidium decreed that it be 
suggested to the government of the Republic of Armenia that it 
present the corresponding report to the Supreme Council before 1 
June of this year.

  [Text] A new political party is being set up in Armenia, 
which will represent people engaged in various types of sports. 
  Speaking at the party's founding assembly, Karlan Torosyan, 
an initiative group representative and chairman of the Ararat-73 
society, said: "We have been told for many years that sports is 
outside politics; life, however, proves otherwise. Physical 
culture and sports are represented not only by the healthy and 
the tough, but also by people who possess intellectual 
potential, who can and should actively participate in formation 
of policy and resolution of problems of socioeconomic 
significance, and contribute to raising the athletic authority 
of Armenia." 
  According to a NOYAN TAPAN report, the first congress of the 
party will be convened in a month; it will approve the party's 
charter and program and elect the governing bodies.

<F P=106> [IATs-NOYAN TAPAN report: "Will Armenian Side Respond to </F>
Chinese Initiative?"] 
  [Text] Contacts are currently underway between the Republic 
of Armenia Ministry of Energy and Fuel and representatives of 
the People's Republic of China [PRC] on the matters related to 
development of the power generation industry in Armenia, in 
particular, hydroelectric power generation. Under consideration 
now is the possibility of acquiring power generation equipment 
for small GES's [hydroelectric power stations] (NOYAN-TAPAN 
comment: Small GES's have generating capacity between 100 kw and 
10 MW.) The PRC is the world leader in terms of the number of 
micro- and mini-GES's and has considerable experience in making 
equipment for them. 
  Liu Xueli, first secretary of the PRC Embassy in the 
Republic 
of Armenia in charge of economic issues, said in an interview to 
a NOYAN-TAPAN correspondent that Chinese equipment for small 
GES's is of good quality and inexpensive. The PRC has exported 
it to many countries of the world: Italy, the United States, 
Brazil, Turkey, Thailand, India, and so on. In the initial 
development of its power generation industry, China built in 
parallel large thermal power generation stations and small 
GES's. In the 1960's, when China also experienced a shortfall of 
electric power, the state provided incentives for construction 
of small GES's and small thermal power stations. The Chinese 
government exempted those who built small power stations from 
taxes. Only then did the state concentrate its efforts on 
building high-capacity GES's. In addition to money invested by 
the state itself, international credits are used in construction 
of these objects. Keeping in mind the geographic peculiarities 
of some regions in China--first and foremost in the west and 
south, where there are high mountains and many 
rivers--construction of small GES's is very profitable. "I have 
to point out that analogous geographic conditions exist in 
Armenia. And Armenia's current situation (the blockade and other 
difficulties) draw one's attention to hydroelectric power 
generation. I believe that construction of GES's is necessary in 
order to develop Armenia's energy sector," said Liu Xueli. 
  As it turned out, the Chinese side has already submitted to 
the Republic of Armenia Ministry of Energy and Fuel concrete 
proposals on deliveries of equipment for our small GES's. These 
proposals will be studied by the Armenian side. Will the 
Armenian side respond to the Chinese initiative?

<F P=106> [Article by I.M. under the rubric "Parliament": "`Not So </F>
Hot' Fact and `Pushbutton Hooligans'"] 
  [Text] With a brisk step, the prime minister almost 
boyishly ran up to the rostrum and, once there, as if 
restraining his drive, with deliberate calmness, clearly 
enunciating every figure, began to explain to the audience why 
the government chose the 30-percent tax on profit over the 
20-percent proposed by the deputies. He described in detail the 
mechanics of the so-called zero-sum situation, into which we may 
slide otherwise. He gave examples from the practice of other 
states, including civilized ones. I will not bore the reader 
with details, because I saw that the deputies, too--many either 
found it unnecessary to get into the fine print or were 
incapable of doing so, or perhaps already had made up their 
mind. In any case, they did not heed the prime minister's words 
and did not accommodate the president's requests enunciated in 
his "comments" to the draft laws under discussion: "On Tax on 
Land" and "On Tax on Profit." The situation in the "kitchen" did 
not require great analytical abilities to understand the 
underlying motive that guided both parties. As usual: The 
government protects the interests of the state, and the 
deputies--the interests of the people. In this particular 
case--the business segment. And why not--strangling business 
with such a tax--30 percent--means strangling it to death. The 
"threat" that the danger lies in something else--that under the 
20-percent tax a jump in inflation is inevitable, that every 
taxpayer thinks that the tax is too high, and that we should be 
guided by the interests of the entire state and not just one 
population stratum--did not bring the desired effect. The 
speaker--who, by the way, spoke before the prime minister and 
seemed to have barely restrained himself from spoonfeeding his 
"flock" regarding what is what and what is not in the business 
at hand--namely, in the "president's amendment": nothing is 
outside the law; it is in the interests of each and every 
person; on Tuesday evening, after a meeting, members of the 
cabinet and the presidium, worn out and tired, still found 
enough willpower to stay up and work, arriving at the nonsense 
[as published] of the "30 percent" necessity; and so on, and so 
on--did not produce any effect either. As well as the deputy's 
attempt to explain to the "listeners" that the point is not the 
figures but the substance. Neither did the government correction 
help: that it is not simply the "numbers"--it is precisely the 
substance, because the question under discussion does not stand 
alone but is part of the general development program. In short, 
despite the concentrated firepower, "the enemy was stopped" and 
"we won." Please forgive the seeming frivolity of this phrase. I 
permitted it because during a smoking break a high-ranking 
government official confessed to me with the smile of one who 
had made a discovery: "You see, the Supreme Soviet assumes 
everything that comes out of the cabinet to be evil. If they 
manage to `nix' a proposal, they celebrate victory. For them, 
the important part is to beat us. They just cannot comprehend 
that besides the notorious `counterbalance,' we should all be 
guided by common interests." During the next smoking break, with 
the smile of one who had made a startling discovery, a 
commission head confessed to me that the best the government can 
do is liquidate itself. That everything it proposes "at best 
does not result in the direct and final demise of the state. 
That even seemingly sensible proposals are not thought through 
in detail, are not well argumented, are not accompanied by a 
mechanism for implementation, which leads to even greater chaos." 
  On our way home, one deputy of my acquaintance comforted me 
philosophically: "Everything is normal. Do you really think that 
in civilized countries relations are better between parliament 
and government?" I really do not know, never having had a chance 
to observe closely, but... But it is still different over there: 
There is an adopted constitution, working laws; there is no 
murderous time pressure, which allows them, while heatedly 
debating each amendment, to calmly relish it before permitting 
it to be put to use; the procedure for budget and program 
approval is fine-tuned; and anyway, how can it be that the 
budget is approved and the program is not?! 
  In short, the impression I was left with after these three 
days is depressing. As if all the charge had been spent during 
the battle for the budget and they are now performing, so to 
say, a filler. Since it was announced in the promotion, it has 
to be played. No more than that. Although taxation laws cannot 
be considered insignificant no matter how inwardly relaxed one 
may be. Perhaps the reason for this painful impression was the 
expectation that--well, they must finally get to the most 
important; we have reached the limit; so many laws are waiting 
their turn, and they... I do not know, perhaps, another proverb 
fits here: Do not judge and you will not be judged, and they, 
the deputies, know better what and when, within what timeframe, 
and why secondary--to the uninitiated eye--issues should be 
brought into finer shape, and... The question of the minister of 
light industry, which at least for us--reporters and 
readers--could become a "burning" issue, was also left hanging 
in midair. By the way, this situation is particularly 
depressing. If the "suspect" official is indeed a villain, such 
procrastination around the matter only gives him the opportunity 
to continue his villainy with greater enthusiasm for whatever 
time he has left. If the opposite, and he has simply been 
slandered, most likely he will be paralyzed by the knowledge of 
the stupidity of the whole thing. In any case, delay in 
resolving this matter only aggravates the situation. In the end, 
everything was completely jumbled. It suddenly turned out that 
the quorum had been provided by apparently "dead souls." That 
is, deputies push buttons for their colleagues who are absent. 
Two "pushbutton hooligans" were even identified by name. They 
took the floor. Started a lively argument with a pretense to 
sarcasm. Everybody's spirits rose. The implacable time kept 
ticking. Deputies suddenly jumped from their seats and rushed to 
the exit, disregarding the chairman's attempt to call them to 
order. Somebody said that this kind of behavior enables them to 
avoid putting something to a vote, but... 
  I have no doubt that later some will argue heatedly that 
behind all this are the games of the "top echelons," that the 
destabilized situation of the last few minutes, and not only 
that, was aimed at derailing, or rather, not putting to a vote 
the most interesting issues, and so on, and so on. But, hell! 
One would think that the rules of the game had been learned by 
now--why go through the same hoops every time?! 
  Still, there was one cheerful point in all this--7 April was 
made a holiday by law. Congratulations!

<F P=106> [ARMENPRESS report: "Questions Remain: Session of the State </F>
Commission for Coordination of Armenian-Iranian Relations"] 
  [Text] A session of the State Commission for Coordination 
of Armenian-Iranian Relations was held on 31 March under the 
chairmanship of G. Arutyunyan, vice president of the Republic of 
Armenia. 
  Information on the assistance rendered the work of the 
competent commissions looking into the circumstances of the loss 
on the territory of Nagorno-Karabakh of an Iranian C-130 
military-transport aircraft and the causes of the tragedy by the 
Armenian authorities was heard at the session. 
  Profound regret was expressed in connection with the 
aircraft 
catastrophe and the human casualties, and it was noted that 
Armenia was assisting in every way and would continue to assist 
the investigation of all the circumstances of the loss of the 
aircraft by specialists who had come from Iran and the competent 
commission of the CIS Interstate Aviation Committee. 
  The shipment of the remains of the victims of the tragedy 
from Stepanakert to Yerevan and from there to Tehran has been 
properly organized also. 
  At the same time it was observed at the session that the 
disinformation being spread from time to time by certain foreign 
news media and the biased interpretation of the incident are 
making this accident a subject of political speculation. 
  It was observed also that many questions still await a 
definitive answer. According to the specialists from Iran, the 
C-130 aircraft did not have a "black box." It was ascertained 
also that the aircraft lost pressure 50 minutes after departure 
from Moscow and lost 2,400 meters in altitude, but the crew 
decided not to return to the Moscow airport and continued the 
flight. 
  The investigation confirms that the aircraft did not enter 
Armenia's air space at all and did not make contact with 
Yerevan's air traffic control services, although the latter had 
attempted to establish communication also via a Russian 
aircraft, Flight 954, when Georgia's air traffic control 
reported that the airplane had strayed off course and that 
communications with it had been lost. 
  It is still not clear why the aircraft deviated abruptly 
from 
the flight path on the territory of Georgia and went for quite 
some time deeper onto the territory of Azerbaijan, losing 
altitude appreciably (approximately 4,000 meters). 
  At the same time hope was expressed that the answers to all 
the questions might be obtained after a comprehensive study of 
the incident by specialists and the competent commissions. 
  Emphasizing the vital need for the establishment of 
stability 
and peace in the region, concern was also expressed at the 
session in connection with the fact that Azerbaijan's 
frustration of the peacemaking initiatives for a settlement of 
the Karabakh problem was becoming a cause of the tragedy of the 
sons not only of the Armenian and Azerbaijani but 
also--involuntarily--of the friendly Iranian people. 
  A number of current matters concerning Armenian-Iranian 
economic relations was discussed at the commission session also.

<F P=106> [Artem Yerkanyan report: "Kurds Ready for Compromise"] </F>
  [Text] A news conference organized yesterday by the 
Kurdish Professionals of Armenia Council, the Kurdistan 
Committee, and the newspapers RYATAZA and BOTAN was devoted to 
the events of the current stage of the national liberation 
movement of the Kurdish people and also to the attitude toward 
the Kurdish question of the governments of Turkey and Western 
states. 
  A purpose of the measure was to explain the propositions of 
the appeal of Abdulla Odzhalan, general secretary of the 
Kurdistan Workers Party [RPK], to 35 states, in which the RPK 
leader states once again his readiness to renounce power 
methods. "We would welcome all initiatives aimed at a peaceful 
solution of the Kurdish problem and are prepared to embark on 
their discussion without any conditions whatever," the appeal 
says. It follows from that same document that the RPK does not 
insist on the obligatory dismemberment of Turkey and would 
discuss all proposals of the Turkish leadership concerning 
mutual compromise, including the possibility of a federal 
arrangement of Turkey. 
  The participants in the news conference--Amarike Sardar, 
editor of the newspaper RYATAZA, the poet Karla Mad, and the 
scholar Sharafe Ashir--dwelt in detail on the position of their 
compatriots in Turkey and this state's policy in respect to the 
Kurdish people. The parliamentary elections in Turkey on 27 
March were seen as a fraud. In the eastern provinces, in which 
the Kurds live, the elections were conducted under the pressure 
of a beefed-up contingent of the armed forces. A parliament 
formed under such conditions cannot be legitimate. 
  The anger of Armenia's Kurdish community at the world 
community's reluctance to recognize the seriousness of the 
problem is intensified by the avowedly anti-Kurdish actions 
taken by the governments of certain European countries. The 
leadership of the FRG was subjected to particular criticism. The 
Ministry of Interior of Germany has banned the local Kurdish 
community from celebrating the Novruz national holiday. As a 
sign of protest, two young Kurdish women committed an act of 
self-immolation in the West German city of Mannheim. 
  The questions put by the journalists concerned both the main 
topic of the news conference and the disagreements within the 
Kurdish community connected with the separatist sentiments of 
the Yezidi Kurds.

  [Text] A meeting of the Central Commission for Humanitarian 
Assistance, which was chaired by Armenak Darbinyan, deputy 
chairman of the commission and deputy minister of economic 
affairs of the Republic of Armenia, was held on 30 March. 
  Ishkhan Martirosyan, deputy minister of agriculture, 
reported 
how this sector had disposed of the humanitarian assistance it 
had received last year from overseas and on anticipated 
assistance in 1994. It was noted specifically that 72 tonnes of 
chemically treated sunflower seeds, 1 tonne of which had been 
allocated to Talinskiy Rayon, had been received along Armenia 
Assistance Fund lines. As ascertained, it was these seeds that 
were being sold on the streets of Yerevan, as a result of which 
instances of poisoning were recorded. The commission noted that 
criminal proceedings had already been instituted in this case. 
  It was resolved at the meeting to render assistance in 1994 
to orphaned children and certain strata of society, 
specifically, single retirees, schools and preschools of the 
city of Yerevan, cities of the disaster zone and area schools, 
cultural organizations, members of the staff of certain 
vocational-technical schools of Yerevan, and others. 
  It was also noted at the meeting that there is currently a 
multitude of nongovernment charitable organizations rendering 
humanitarian assistance to various strata of the population of 
the republic. But their work is uncoordinated, and the aid is 
frequently received by the same recipients. In this connection 
the Central Commission for Humanitarian Assistance of the 
Republic of Armenia requests that the nongovernment 
organizations coordinate their operations with the commission.

<F P=106> [Article by unidentified correspondent: "President Signed </F>
Edict on Wage Increase"] 
  [Text] President of the Republic of Armenia Levon 
Ter-Petrosyan signed an edict on 31 March on increasing the 
minimum scale of wages of workers of budgetary institutions, 
pensions, benefits, and stipends. 
  According to the edict, starting on 1 April 1994, the 
minimum 
wage scale in the republic is established at 176 drams, and in 
remote and border population centers, established by the 
government of the republic, 194 drams. The official salaries of 
workers of budgetary institutions that are not paid according to 
the multiplier coefficient with respect to the minimum wage, 
pensions designated in the event of full length of service, and 
the pensions of servicemen are increased by a factor of 1.6. 
  The edict shows a clearly differentiated approach to the 
question of supplementary social support to the low income 
elements of the population. Additional monetary supplements, 
after indexation, were established for workers of budgetary 
institutions who are on a scale of less than 880 drams, for 
pensions with full length of service, and for the pensions of 
servicemen. 
  What is also very important for a substantial part of the 
population is that, given an incomplete length of service, the 
scales of work pensions for age and disability, social pensions 
for old age and disability, and also the pensions of servicemen, 
and the supplementary payments to them, are determined from a 
calculation of the minimum wage with an additional supplement of 
191 drams. 
  Stipends to students of state higher educational 
institutions 
are established at a scale of 296 drams, for graduation 
classes--330 drams, and in the event of outstanding 
progress--370 drams. Starting on 1 April, the stipends for 
graduate students will be 500 drams, and for doctoral 
students--700 drams. 
  Allowances of various kinds for children are being increased 
by a factor of 3 and more. 
  A supplementary payment of 194 drams is established for 
unemployment benefits. 
  The edict of the president of the Republic of Armenia will 
be 
published in full in one of the issues of RESPUBLIKA ARMENIYA in 
the near future.

<F P=106> [Report by the News Department: "Armenian Deserters Will Be </F>
Discussed in Krasnodar"] 
  [Text] As was reported to a RESPUBLIKA ARMENIYA 
correspondent in the press center of the Republic of Armenia, an 
Armenian delegation headed by Deputy Prime Minister Vigen 
Chitechyan, returned to Yerevan from Krasnodar yesterday. The 
purpose of the official visit was to settle trade-economic 
relations and to resolve questions on the renewal of air 
transportation from Krasnodar to Armenia, which was halted two 
months ago after the crash of a cargo plane that was heading for 
Gyumri. Besides other questions discussed by members of the 
delegation with Nikolay Yegorov, the head of the local 
administration, and Viktor Gladskiy, his deputy, problems were 
also touched upon that are associated with the migration of 
citizens of Armenia to Krasnodarskiy Kray. In the course of the 
conversations with the leadership of the kray, the possibility 
of the cooperation of law enforcement organs was discussed, and, 
in particular, the question was broached on the return of 
Armenian citizens located on the territory of Krasnodarskiy Kray 
who were army draft evaders. 
  Three documents were signed as a result of the negotiations: 
"Agreement on the Principles of Trade-Economic Cooperation for 
1994," "Provisional Agreement on the Conveyance of Cargoes by 
Air Transport," and an "Agreement on Cooperation in the 
Cultural- Educational and Scientific Sphere, and in the Sphere 
of Sports and Tourism." 
  The members of the Armenian delegation had a meeting with 
representatives of the Armenian communities of Krasnodarskiy 
Kray.

<F P=106> ["Statement by the Press Service of the President of the </F>
Republic of Azerbaijan"] 
  [Text] In March 1918, organized armed actions by Armenians 
against the Azeri civilian population took place throughout the 
territory of Azerbaijan. These actions, which were organized by 
the leaders of the Bolshevik party, the Dashnaktsutyun Party, 
and other Armenian terrorist organizations, were aimed at the 
physical extermination of Azeris, the destruction of monuments 
of spiritual and material culture of Azerbaijan, and ultimately 
the Armenization of indigenous Azeri territories. 
  Anti-Azeri pogroms and acts of violence and terror were 
perpetrated throughout the territory of Azerbaijan between 1917 
and 1920. However, they became the most cruel during March 1918 
in Baku, Shemakha, Kuba, the villages of Shemakhinskiy, 
Kubinskiy, and Geokchayskiy Uyezds, Karabakh, and some other 
regions of Azerbaijan. In these regions the Armenian barbarians 
brutally wiped out more than 50,000 peaceful Azeris and burned 
down monuments of Azeri ethnic culture, mosques, and state 
offices. 
  The March 1918 events were tragically peculiar in that the 
inhumane ideology of Armenian national-chauvinism blended with 
the criminal practice of terror and genocide of the Azeris and 
ethnic cleansing and Armenization of Azeri lands aimed at 
achieving Armenians' economic and political domination over 
Azerbaijan. It is also characteristic that virtually all strata 
of the Armenian population, which rallied on the basis of the 
pathologically developed idea of hatred for Turkic nations, 
primarily Azeris, took part in these events. 
  The bloody synthesis of the ideology and practice of 
Armenian 
national-chauvinism has been built upon in the current state 
policy of the Republic of Armenia, which has ethnically 
"cleansed" its territory and is waging a large-scale war on 
Azerbaijan; it has occupied about 20 percent of the territory of 
Azerbaijan and forced more than 1 million Azeris to become 
refugees. 
  In conjunction with the above, the Republic of Azerbaijan, 
resolutely denouncing the Armenian policy of secret and open 
genocide of Azeris pursued throughout the 20th century and 
condemning the ideology and practice of Armenian 
national-chauvinism as a crime against the Azeri people, against 
peace and humanity, calls on the nations and parliaments of the 
world and leading international organizations to make a 
qualified assessment of the March 1918 events and to consider 
the issue of moral and legal responsibility of the ethnically 
"clean" Republic of Armenia for the policy of war, terror, and 
genocide pursued with regard to the Azeri people.

<F P=106> [Article by AZERTADZH correspondent: "The GNK and UNOCAL </F>
Present"] 
  [Text] Baku, 1 April--Yesterday a scientific study of the 
megastructure of the Gyuneshli, Azeri, and Chyrag oil fields, 
which was conducted by the GNK [State Oil Company] of Azerbaijan 
together with the American company UNOCAL was presented at the 
GNK of Azerbaijan. 
  As John Ellis Flint, chief geologist of UNOCAL and director 
of the group for the CIS, Near East, Europe, and North Africa, 
stated in a conversation with an AZERTADZH correspondent, 
specialists from the two companies have conducted research to 
build geological models of these oil fields; the practical 
utilization of its results will make it possible to reduce the 
degree of risk in developing the oil fields and, therefore, 
outlays, and to improve the economic effectiveness of oil 
production. 
  At present, specialists of the GNK and UNOCAL are continuing 
joint work on three other projects. In particular, the 
geological and geochemical modelling of the oil and gas-bearing 
basin between the Kura and Yori rivers is underway, which will 
make it possible to improve the effectiveness of exploratory 
efforts.

<F P=106> [Interview with Ajarian Supreme Council Chairman Aslan </F>
Abashidze by SARKARTVELOS RESPUBLIKA Correspondent Gia Chelidze, 
Batumi: "`Where is Aslan?!'": date not given] 
  [Text] Our people are again focusing their attention 
on the result of Georgian Head of State Eduard Shevardnadze's 
recent visit to Turkey, the political documents that were signed 
in Ankara, and the package of economic and cultural cooperation 
agreements designed to foster good-neighborly relations and 
cooperation between our two countries. 
  The Georgian delegation included Ajarian Supreme 
Council Chairman Aslan Abashidze. 
  [Abashidze] I will say from the outset that this first 
official visit marks a new stage in our country's history and 
relations, which will certainly yield solid, practical results. 
  As far as history is concerned.... You yourself know how 
troubled our two countries' relations have been over the 
centuries. There was more darkness than light, but times have 
changed. We are all gratified now about this sharp turnaround in 
our relations, as reflected in the visit to independent Georgia 
by Turkey's present president (who was the Prime Minister then) 
Suleiman Demirel. He was the first to announce out loud, 
"Georgia and Turkey must have not only friendly but brotherly 
relations." 
  This was followed by 50 million dollars' worth of credit for 
Georgia, wheat, humanitarian aid, and so on. Turkey was the 
first to extend a helping hand to us. 
  I will not attempt to describe the wonderful reception our 
head of state got in Turkey; that has already been reported. I 
will try to single out a few highlights. 
  Shevardnadze's great popularity and respect in Turkey was 
something we felt a half hour before we were to land in Ankara, 
when our airplane was met by an honor escort consisting of four 
of the Turkish Air Force's Phantoms escorted to Ankara airport. 
It was an impressive sight. 
  Before that, we, the people and leaders of Ajaria, counted 
it 
a real honor when the head of state's airplane made a major 
change in its route to land in Batumi so the Ajarian delegation 
could join. This fact places a great responsibility on us in the 
future, and we will try to reciprocate. 
  Earlier, again by way of Batumi, a "working group" headed by 
Batoni Zurab Kervalishvili headed to Turkey; in Batumi we looked 
over the programs together, to which we contributed our own 
proposals as well. For example, Batumi was also added to the 
housing plan; it had not been included. Naturally, this carries 
considerable political weight, because our two countries' 
relations begin at the border, in this case from Sarpi and 
Batumi. This is a very important factor. 
  The lavish ceremony that was put on in front of Turkey's 
presidential palace in honor of Batoni Eduard was most 
impressive, a confirmation of the esteem the hosts hold our 
outstanding political leader in. And wasn't it the same in 
Germany, China, and elsewhere? As I watched, I felt a mixture of 
pride and regret, thinking what strange and ungrateful people we 
Georgians are: even today, hardly anybody in the world knows 
about Georgia, but just mention the name of Shevardnadze and... 
everything falls into place. 
  But are we making use of the Shevardnadze factor? Quite the 
contrary: it is as if we are sacrificing Georgia's great 
opportunities today to certain persons' individual and party 
interests. Forgive the awkward comparison, but even a soccer 
team, if it is in trouble, will go to any lengths to buy someone 
who will take charge and help it win. Not us: instead of making 
use of this big factor, we have yet to show him anything but 
pain, distrust, abuse, and ungratefulness. It is sad, but "a 
prophet is without honor in his own country...." If other 
countries had a man like him, they would probably have stood the 
world on its ear by now and made their own country into an Eden 
instead of building state policy on personal sympathies and 
antipathies. 
  Please consider this a lyrical digression. 
  [Chelidze] Your recent statement about supporting the 
Georgian Citizens' Alliance made your position clear once more. 
  [Abashidze] I'm not the kind of man to shout about it every 
day, but I have said more than once: the head of state needs the 
kind of faithful allies who will stand by him in deed rather 
than in words. We ourselves, and the whole population of Ajaria, 
have done everything we could. In our recent interview we 
acquainted readers with the relevant documents, but that's not 
the main thing. The point is how to help the country, how to put 
the economy back on its feet, how to renew the rebuilding 
process. This is what we had in mind two years ago when we 
created the Ajaria Revival Alliance with the slogan "Georgia 
Above All." This new stage of relations with Turkey holds 
promise for Georgia and for Ajaria, which directly borders on 
Turkey. 
  Keep in mind, moreover, that many of our brothers, our close 
relatives, live and work in Turkey. The two days we were in 
Ankara, our whole diaspora practically camped in our hotel. You 
should have seen how delighted they were, how much they wanted 
to help and cooperate with us. 
  One of them was a close relative of mine, my grandfather's 
nephew, General Akhmed Adzhari [name transliterated], a well 
known Turkish military man and industrialist. He now holds a 
high position in Turkey's military-industrial complex, which 
also includes other leading sectors of the economy. He has come 
to Batumi a number of times, and he asked me to introduce him to 
our head of state, which I did in Ankara. This time as well he 
had some interesting projects and proposals for us. 
  We didn't go empty-handed either. We had a number of 
interesting projects with us. We want to build a large milling 
combine, a high-rise complex, and a power plant to supply 
electricity to both sides. We are planning a joint shipbuilding 
project based in Batumi's Shipbuilding Plant, to build 
river-maritime ships. I think this will strengthen and improve 
the quality of Georgia's maritime shipping. 
  During our visit, they asked me to stay in Turkey a few days 
and see with my own eyes the plants which we have agreements 
with firms there to build. Plans call for building and starting 
up joint garment and wood processing enterprises. 
  We will probably know in the first quarter of this year how 
practical the implementation of these agreements is. 
  [Chelidze] For decades we waited for things to be brought to 
us on a platter. Maybe that has made us what we are 
today--inert, apathetic, lacking initiative and so on and so 
forth. 
  [Abashidze] You are right. That's the way it was, but not 
any 
longer. The economic and cultural cooperation package that was 
signed during our official visit to Turkey opens up the way. Now 
it is up to our businessmen and business circles to see how 
skillfully we take advantage of these opportunities for our 
country's sake, how well we prepare new projects and carry them 
out. Hence, every ministry, firm, and organization will have to 
get busy and design projects which will serve our country's as 
well as the departments' interests. 
  Preparing projects is no easy matter, however. It has to be 
preceded by considerable preparation. We need experienced and 
knowledgeable specialists, but, sad to say, we have very few. So 
we will have to import them from other countries, making use of 
our head of state's enormous prestige to do so. No one will 
refuse him, and we can always trust and rely on specialists he 
invites in. 
  I would like to emphasize one thing. In Turkey, both the 
head 
of state and I had opportunities to meet with Turkish 
businessmen. They offered the kinds of projects and proposals to 
us which we are sending our own specialists to other countries 
for. 
  This means that we lack information, we don't know what's 
going on in the civilized world in certain sectors. 
  [Chelidze] When you came home from England and Europe last 
summer, you cancelled several of your decisions. 
  [Abashidze] You just have to do that when you find that a 
contract is disadvantageous. We must admit that we are not yet 
well versed in the details and nuances of the market economy, so 
we have to do everything necessary to train knowledgeable cadres 
as soon as possible. 
  I don't know about other people, but when I talk to foreign 
businessmen now I can't help feeling cautious, because I know 
that a real professional tries to turn negotiations to his own 
advantage. If you are incompetent and don't have up-to-date 
information, well.... 
  Right now, most of our businessmen don't even know how to 
talk to foreigners in order to make the right deal. So we will 
have problems until we have gone through the labyrinth of the 
market economy. 
  [Chelidze] Any trip or official visit, of course, not only 
includes diplomatic meetings but also events that are pleasant 
just to reminisce about later on. 
  [Abashidze] Of course. Let me start with this pleasant 
recollection. During one reception, I found myself between 
Turkish Prime Minister Tansu Ciller and the wife of President 
Demirel. What better chance could a man wish for? For several 
hours I laid out for the Prime Minister all the problems we are 
trying to solve. I talked about future projects and proposals. 
Ms Ciller was so interested that she immediately summoned her 
apparatus's officials and ministries to the banquet table and 
gave them specific instructions, according to which our 
specialists and their Turkish colleagues will collaborate on 
projects and proposals which the prime minister submits to them. 
Ms Ciller also promised to study these projects herself, and she 
will come to Georgia this spring and also visit Ajaria. That is 
her desire. She has very warm feelings for Georgia, as do the 
president and his wife. 
  As for strange episodes, they started when I set my watch on 
Turkish time as we arrived, and was therefore an hour late. 
Batoni Eduard was waiting for me at the Residence. As a result, 
the signing ceremony was delayed. I was horrified. I realized, 
of course, what had happened, but what could I do. That was one. 
For some reason, Batoni Eduard was always looking for me. I kept 
hearing him say, "Where is Aslan, where is Aslan?" 
  I don't know; anyone who knows me knows I have no trouble 
walking or running. But our head of state goes so fast I 
couldn't keep up with him and often fell behind. I noticed how 
fast our head of state walks back in our own country, in 
mountainous Khulo. He sprained his foot there, but I still 
couldn't keep up. I thought to myself, maybe in these carpeted 
halls he'll walk a little slower, but I swear.... 
  "Where is Aslan?", Batoni Eduard would say, and delegation 
members and guards, who sometimes broke the protocol rules 
themselves, would make a path for me so I could catch up. Even 
when I was late or got behind, he always greeted me with a smile. 
  He never said a word of reproach, but I would have preferred 
that, because at such times a smile seems like more of a 
punishment. 
  The visit ended, and we happily left Turkey's hospitable 
land, taking with us the hope and belief that Georgia and Turkey 
really will begin a new stage, a breakthrough, a stage of 
brotherhood which will benefit our peoples and Georgia.

<F P=106> [Interview with Georgian Republic Foreign Affairs Minister </F>
Aleksandre Chikvaidze: "`It Was No Easy Task...'":] 
  [Text] On 3 February, a Georgian delegation headed by 
Foreign Affairs Minister Aleksandre Chikvaidze returned from UN 
Headquarters in the United States. Even though the minister 
immediately joined in the events of Boris Yeltsin's official 
visit, the extreme importance of the issue made this interview 
essential. 
  [Question] Batono [polite form of address for males] 
Minister, what was the specific purpose of the Georgian 
delegation's visit to the United States, and what difficulties 
did you have to overcome to accomplish it? 
  [Chikvaidze] You will recall that on 1 February the mandate 
of the UN observer mission in Abkhazia was running out, and so 
the basic task was to extend it, which would necessitate further 
participation by UN and international institutions, without 
which any implementation of peace-keeping operations would be 
ruled out. 
  [Original text missing or illegible except for phrase 
fragments] ...the Abkhazian side... an attempt to settle 
outsiders, which will make it easier for them to excuse their 
crime by a future referendum. Dismissing the [?agreements] 
reached earlier concerning the repatriation of the refugees, the 
separatists again imposed several preconditions. As a result, 
any practical results from the latest Moscow meeting became 
doubtful. It was essential, therefore, once more to gain the 
international community's recognition of the principle of 
Georgia's territorial integrity and inviolability of its borders 
and, along with raising the question of the safe and 
unconditional repatriaion of the refugees,... ...the results of 
a referendum. 
  [Many of the following lines are illegible except for phrase 
fragments] Immediately on arriving in America we met UN General 
Secretary Butrus Butrus-Ghali, the UN's Political Department 
leaders, members of the Security Council, and member country 
representatives. Our comments were taken into account in jointly 
formulating a draft resolution. 
  Despite international support for Georgia (a "Friends of 
Georgia" group has been formed, consisting of the United States, 
France, Great Britain, Germany, and Russia), all this was no 
easy task. According to the UN's own procedures, it takes at 
least 24 hours to make amendments to resolutions, and within 
that time every representative of the Security Council has to 
contact his country's capital, define its position and receive 
the necessary instructions, after which consultations are held 
and only then can the resolution be adopted. But time was too 
precious... We got the information about the Moscow meeting from 
Tbilisi on the evening of 30 January, but the session of the 
Security Council was scheduled for 31 January, and it was 
necessary to prepare a practically new draft of the resolution 
that had already been agreed on. Victory was won by our 
permanent mission to the UN, and all its members, under the 
leadership of Petre Chkheidze. We worked 24 hours, using 
everything we could--old and new paths and personal contacts. 
Fortunately, we achieved what we wanted and needed. 
  [Question] Batono Aleksandre, what about the resolution 
specifically? 
  [Chikvaidze] I would single out several important items in 
the resolution, in particular the UN observers' mission and 
peace-keeping forces, Georgia's territorial integrity and 
inviolability of its borders, and the refugees. 
  The resolution expands the mandate of the UN observers' 
mission and extends it until 7 March 1994. In addition, the 
number of observers is increased to 88. And, after the third 
round of talks planned for 22 February, the General Secretary, 
on instructions of the Security Council, is to immediately 
present information on the circumstances which necessitate the 
deployment of peace-keeping forces in the conflict zone, along 
with an appropriate, concrete plan. 
  But the picture will be incomplete unless one very important 
reality is taken into account. You know that the Georgian 
delegation, headed by Batoni Jaba Ioseliani, has already had 
successful talks with the Abkhazian side in Geneva on two 
occasions. The fact is that the groundwork has been laid for new 
and qualitatively different principles. Nevertheless, new and, 
for us, undesirable tendencies emerged from the Abkhazian side, 
which, from the standpoint of political logic, could have a 
negative impact on further developments. From this standpoint, 
the UN's resolution is very timely. 
  During our head of state's visit to Paris, Batoni Eduard 
Shevardnadze met with the UN General Secretary, and their 
two-hour talk became the political litmus test which clearly 
brought out the further political tendency of the specific 
situation and, in principle, brought about the passage of the 
UN's resolution at the time we most needed it. This meeting 
played a decisive role in turning events to our advantage. 
  The rest, as they say, was strictly a technicality. It was 
necessary to get the Security Council members effectively to see 
our side of the problem. Fortunately, the expected result was 
not slow in coming. 
  Mr Butrus Butrus-Ghali already has two plans, which have 
been 
examined together with the Friends of Georgia group, with the 
participation of Mr Eduard Bruner [name transliterated], the 
General Secretary's personal representative. 
  The first plan calls for the UN's traditional peace-keeping 
operation--2,500 Blue Helmets under its command will be sent 
first to Gali, in the vicinity of the Enguri and the Psou rivers 
and later to other areas, with a specific mission: to keep the 
two sides separate, to disarm illegal military formations, and, 
mainly, to work out firm guarantees of safety for the 
unconditional repatriation of refugees. The second plan has the 
same tasks in mind, with the difference that peace-keeping 
functions will be carried out by armed forces of the countries 
concerned, while monitoring and control will be provided by the 
UN observers mission, now increased to 200 men. Of course, it is 
impossible to make these two plans a reality at one stroke. 
Activating the peace-keeping forces is a very complex process. 
Preparations for it will take at least six months, a time in 
which a concrete plan will have to be worked out as to which 
country will take part in implementing the peace-keeping 
operations, and in what numbers. Technical questions will have 
to be decided, and there is the finance problem, and the various 
countries' willingness and readiness to activate their troops 
under UN auspices. 
  During our UN meetings, opinions and advice were voiced to 
the effect that the correct thing at first would be to introduce 
Russian troops into the conflict zone on the basis of a 
bilateral agreement. Later on, those troops would be joined by 
troops from other countries. 
  The UN is looking very closely at Russia's participation in 
the peace-keeping forces. Russian representative Mr Vorontsov 
stated directly at a Security Council meeting that it would be 
unacceptable to change borders by means of armed confrontation, 
but as for a possible referendum and its results, there can be 
talk of that only after the refugees are repatriated and the 
original character of the population has been restored. 
  [Question] Batono Minister, that kind of attention on the 
part of the UN is not a new thing to Georgians. There is 
probably no precedent for passing so many resolutions concerning 
one country. Can you say something about the possible practical 
results of this? 
  [Chikvaidze] Looking at things realistically, today's 
political reality, the solution to any question requires a 
political basis, and this resolution does lay that foundation. 
  After the passage of the resolution, preparations for 
bringing in the peace-keeping forces should begin. 
  Emphasis is again placed on Georgia's territorial 
integrity--at a time when the Gudauta gang is planning to hold a 
referendum. 
  It was emphasized that it will be possible to determine 
Abkhazia's political status only if the sovereignty and 
territorial integrity of the Republic of Georgia is respected. 
  For the first time, the resolution has noted and, more 
important, singled out, our most painful problem--the refugees. 
Article 11 and Article 12 recognize every refugee's right to a 
safe return home without any preconditions whatever. The two 
sides must comply with the pledges they have made and a schedule 
of repatriation must be drawn up immediately. The resolution 
denounces the attempts to change the demographic picture, 
including the illegal settling of foreigners since the conflict. 
From the political standpoint, these two articles are a great 
balm to our pain and problems. In short, the mission was 
accomplished. 
  [Question] What was the chronology of events? 
  [Chikvaidze] The Security Council meeting started at 4:30 pm 
on 31 January. Georgia's representative to the UN, Petre 
Chkheidze, spoke. He stated repeatedly that the refugees' 
immediate and unconditional repatriation to their homeland must 
be the cornerstone of any political solution to the conflict, 
while any delay could bring about new tragedies and explosions. 
He was followed by Mr Yuliy Vorontsov, who affirmed guarantees 
of the principle of Georgia's territorial integrity and the 
inviolability of its borders. 
  Great Britain's representative Sir David Henney [name 
transliterated] made an extraordinary statement in which the 
swift and unconditional repatriation of the refugees, and 
cooperation on this matter, was deemed to be a task of top 
priority to resolve the conflict, a touchstone of the 
Abkhazians' good will, and an essential precondition of 
prospects for achieving broad agreement on political problems. 
  The U.S. representative, Ms Madeleine Albright, said: "My 
government will not support and is categorically against any 
half-way measures, for that would mean avoiding our obligations 
toward the refugees." The U.S. representative's statement, which 
is not empty words but represents the American government's 
official position, once more affirms that the international 
community will categorically reject any precedent of border 
revision. The same mood dominated most of the speeches. This 
itself makes it clear that the separatists' aims are doomed from 
the start. 
  Abkhazia's attempt to change the demographic situation was 
denounced by the French and Spanish representatives, Mr 
Jean-Bernard Merimee and Juan Antonio Yanez-Barnuevo. 
  The chairman of the meeting, Czech representative Karel 
Kovanda, denounced the ethnic cleansing launched against the 
Georgians by the Abkhazians, cast doubt on any referendum 
initiated by that side (which constitutes a minority in the 
region), and once again emphasized the supremacy of the 
principle of Georgia's sovereignty and territorial integrity. 
  The resolution was passed unanimously. 
  And so, the world's attitude toward the Abkhazian conflict 
has been affirmed once more, and it ought to make the Gudauta 
gang think. Moreover, the Russian Federation's position is also 
very important; the fact is that the palette of specific 
political realities linked to the Abkhazian problem is being 
filled with new, positive colors, in particular from the 
standpoint of the Russian Federation's attitudes. Incidentally, 
light was shed on many things by Boris Yeltsin's official visit 
to the Republic of Georgia. Most important, it brought out a 
tendency that is very favorable to us: I refer to the unity of 
the two countries' views, both with respect to global issues and 
specifically the Abkhazian conflict. It is obvious to the naked 
eye, nevertheless, that a political settlement and ultimate 
peace will not be an easy process. A great deal depends on 
further events and the talks that have begun in Geneva. The main 
thing is, however, that we are on the right path. The Russian 
Federation's interest in a unified, undivided Georgia is 
becoming increasingly apparent. And so, everything depends on 
our taking the correct political steps.

<F P=106> [Article by Valerian Advadze, the Georgian Republic's </F>
Extraordinary and Plenipotentiary Ambassador to the Russian 
Federation: "To Our `Well-Wishers'"] 
  [Text] For several months, someone in Tbilisi has been 
deliberately spreading rumors that Georgia's embassy in Russia 
is idle; they have practically implanted this notion in the 
minds of people who don't know the real situation. Their 
principle is that a lie that is told fourteen times becomes more 
convincing than a truth that is told once--but they forget that 
the truth is a sharper sword than a lie. 
  The embassy's work has a closed and unseen side which, like 
an iceberg, is much bigger than what is visible. I will not say 
anything about it here; diplomacy does not like to be 
advertised. Its results will speak for themselves. 
  The main object, the embassy's prime task until now, has 
been 
accomplished: two sovereign states--Georgia and Russia--have 
concluded a major agreement and other agreements; we have 
created the juridical base for cooperation on an equal footing. 
This is an historic event in the life of Georgia, and our 
embassy has made its own contribution. 
  Now I will say something about the visible part of the work 
of our embassy and myself as the ambassador. For more clarity, I 
will cite some comparisons: 
  The ambassadors of 166 countries are now accredited in 
Moscow. I can affirm that all of them together in the past 10 
months have not held as many press conferences as Georgia's 
ambassador and embassy have, or given so many interviews to the 
mass media as Georgia's ambassador and embassy officials have. 
All of the 166 ambassadors together have not appeared on Russian 
television as often as Georgia's ambassador has. Those embassies 
have not made as many statements to the media or sent as many 
notes (verbal or written) to Russia's Foreign Affairs Ministry 
as the Georgian embassy has, concerning our country's most 
urgent questions. 
  No other ambassador has done more than Georgia's ambassador 
to contact, negotiate, and talk with Russia's and Moscow's 
leaders about our country's economic, political, military, 
social, and other issues--leaders such as Yeltsin, Chernomyrdin, 
Soskovets, Shokhin, Shakhray, Kozyrev, Grachev, Kolesnikov, 
Gromov, Luzhkov, members of Russia's former Supreme Soviet, and 
other high officials of the Foreign Affairs Ministry. 
  No other ambassadors and embassy diplomats in Moscow have 
had 
so many meetings and talks with the ambassadors of other 
countries (including ambassadors of the Big Seven) and embassy 
diplomats to clarify their countries' position, as have 
Georgia's ambassador and embassy diplomats. 
  That is the truth, and if that isn't diplomatic activity on 
our part, what is? 
  Now let us talk about other aspects. 
  No other embassy does more about its country's economy than 
Georgia's embassy. 
  No other country's embassy and ambassador (including those 
of 
the CIS) has received and entertained so many official, 
business, unofficial, and non-business delegations, businessmen 
and non-businessmen, members of parliament, and lower-ranking 
officials and our own ordinary citizens countrymen (generally 
without prior appointment, people who happen to be in Moscow), 
as Georgia's ambassador and embassy have. 
  All the ambassadors and embassy diplomats of the 166 
countries together have not taken in so many refugees as 
Georgia's embassy has, as many countrymen arriving in Moscow or 
going to other countries via Moscow, as our embassy has, or had 
to cope with as many headaches as our embassy staffers. 
  And that is the truth! 
  After all that, how can anyone with a trace of elementary 
human decency say barefaced that Georgia has no embassy or 
ambassador in Moscow? 
  Now let's look at the conditions under which our embassy and 
its staffers have to work. 
  None of the 166 embassies in Moscow have such poor and 
wretched conditions in material, financial, and technical terms 
as does Georgia's embassy. The embassy has lived on charity all 
year. 
  Georgia's embassy in Moscow is in fact an embassy's embassy 
because of Russia's importance to our country. This is where 
independent Georgia's vital questions are decided. And the 
workload on the embassy's staffers is many times greater than 
that of any of Georgia's embassies in other countries, and it is 
commonly agreed that Moscow holds first place in the world in 
terms of the cost of living. It costs more to live there. 
  Hence, Georgia's embassy in Moscow leads everyone else in 
terms of its importance, its workload, and the cost of living. 
  And yet, our own government has set salary rates for its 
Moscow embassy personnel that are only one-thirteenth--yes, 
that's right--one-thirteenth the rates set for Georgian 
diplomats in any other country. 
  On top of all that, none of all the 166 countries' 
ambassadors and embassy diplomats together have to take as much 
abuse as do Georgia's ambassador and embassy diplomats in 
Moscow, which shows how much our work is "appreciated." 
  That's how we Georgians are! 
  Enough, I think! Indecency has gone on long enough! 
  This is not to give the impression that our embassy in 
Moscow 
is doing ideal work. It has many shortcomings, and Georgia's 
head of state has pointed them out, in a spirit of good will, 
with the desire to correct them. 
  As for our other "friends," however, we advise them to 
follow 
his example and stop abusing the embassy and the ambassador. If 
they really care about the work of Georgia's embassy in Moscow 
(and not about the ambassador's chair), let them help it 
financially and with technical assistance, and if they can't 
then let them kindly refrain from giving us advice (if they have 
the ability). Anyway, it won't work for them, because those on 
whom the fate of the embassy and its personnel depends are not 
going to listen to idle talk, and this is the only happiness in 
our hellish work.

<F P=106> [Interview with National Bank Vice President Merab Kakulia </F>
by Armaz Saneblidze, Donetsk-Tbilisi: "Economic Passions. A 
Triptych for Two Ministers and a Vice President"; date not given] 
  [Text] We began our interview with National Bank Vice 
President Merab Kakulia by talking about an ordinary detail of 
the hullabaloo, so to speak, over the 50,000-ruble 
banknotes. 
<H5>  Even a Priest Will Steal When Hungry </H5>
  [Saneblidze] What is the reality behind it? Is it a form of 
making money with money? 
  [Kakulia] Let me say that the hullabaloo over the 
50,000-ruble banknotes is purely speculative. They are the most 
"mobile banknotes" in Russia, freely accepted by banking 
establishments. The officials of Russia's Central Bank wouldn't 
even dream of taking those notes out of circulation. True, 
counterfeit 50,000-ruble notes have been printed and have been 
found in Russia and other republics where the ruble more or less 
circulates, but that shouldn't have caused such a hullabaloo, 
because it's easy to determine whether a banknote is fake or 
not, for it has many protective mechanisms. For example, just 
look at it in the light; if you see watermarks you can be sure 
it's genuine. The finish on a fake bill is so bad that it takes 
little scrutiny to tell the difference. 
  People won't accept a 50,000-ruble note in Georgia and will 
exchange it only if you let them keep a few thousand as a 
commission, so to speak. Making money with money goes on. 
  We ought to be combatting this in the media, explaining to 
people that a 50,000-ruble note is a fully valid medium of 
payment, that it is in no danger. But because our mass 
consciousness suffers from so much malaise, for various reasons, 
it will be hard to carry out reassurance work like that. We do 
have some experience, however. Remember when the exchange 
offices wouldn't accept dollar bills issued in the 1970s and 
1980s? The absurd notion of the "superdollar"--issued in 
1990--spread. The ridiculous claim was that people in America 
don't like to put those bills in their pocket because they 
contain so much metal; muggers using a special device can easily 
detect that kind of capital, and its owner really is in danger 
of losing it. 
  When this problem surfaced in Georgia, I asked my colleague 
in the U.S. Federal Reserve System (although I was certain it 
was was all made up, an official reply would be useful), and his 
reply was prompt and categorical: all banknotes issued since 
1928 are legal tender. 
  We published this reply and explanation and, believe it or 
not, the problem was partly solved. Probably the same thing 
should be done about the 50,000-ruble notes. 
  [Saneblidze] But there is still a state agency that is 
supposed to regulate currency circulation. It has been slow to 
react to this falsehood, which some organizer must surely be 
behind. Why? 
  [Kakulia] That agency is the National Bank, but keep in mind 
also that for us the 50,000-ruble note is foreign currency, and 
the National Bank doesn't have the means to influence its 
circulation. At best we can talk to Russia's Central Bank and, 
by an exchange transaction, have the bills exchanged for smaller 
denominations. 
  [Saneblidze] Let me put it another way. Some people think 
that the transactions which private exchange offices are 
providing should be taken over by the state. 
  [Kakulia] I don't share that idea. Until the parliament made 
changes to existing legislation and allowed legal and physical 
persons to open currency exchange offices, only authorized banks 
had that right, including state banks. You'll recall that most 
banks were not interested in buying and selling currency; they 
were involved in more "lucrative" business such as refinancing 
credit resources obtained from the National Bank. Banks which 
did engage in currency transactions only bought it, and at low 
rates too. A black market developed in which the currency 
purchase rate that formed was significantly higher than the one 
set by the banks and greatly exceeded the purchase rate. In 
order to correct the currency market it became necessary to set 
up an extensive network of exchange offices. We can say now that 
the currency black market in its traditional sense is no more. 
The buying and selling of currency goes on primarily in the 
exchange offices. But a great many of them can't meet standards, 
although that too is being dealt with in the course of 
reinforcing state order. 
  Still, the exchange offices' role would be greater if the 
coupon really did function as the sole legal tender in Georgia. 
  [Saneblidze] That was my next question--parallel currencies 
and the fate of the coupon. 
  [Kakulia] Let's look this way at the idea of two currencies 
with parallel circulation in our country. There is a generally 
acknowledged law of money circulation--a strong currency will 
drive out a weak one. This is happening before our eyes: the 
ruble (to say nothing of the dollar) is driving out the coupon. 
In every case, then, officially allowing parallel circulation 
will step up the pace of coupon avoidance. Meanwhile, most of 
Georgia's citizens receive their pay in coupons. You can imagine 
what will happen: our people's earnings will lose any economic 
meaning and lead to a social explosion. 
  As for the coupon's fate: is there a way to assure its 
status 
as the sole legal tender? Look, here we are in Ukraine, which is 
also having a hard time. Even the local karbovanets [Ukrainian 
ruble] is not much firmer than our coupon. There was a time when 
our coupon's exchange rate was more solid than that of the 
Ukrainian currency, and yet the karbovanets is still the sole 
legal tender. In all this big country you can hardly find a 
store that does its trade with rubles or dollars. If you have 
foreign currency, say rubles, in your hand, you have to change 
it at an exchange office. I repeat, the karbovanets's exchange 
rate is falling fast, yet currency regulations are not being 
broken--because that carries an appropriate penalty that is 
enforceable by law, and people have a national 
self-consciousness that the karbovanets is a symbol of. 
  I think that with the proper state approach, we can make the 
coupon the sole legal tender in Georgia as well. I'm encouraged 
to think so by the fact the coupon's status in the outlying 
areas is not as shaky as it is in Tbilisi. We have to take 
prompt steps to save the coupon. 
  First of all, we have to institute a legal mechanism of 
liability for violating currency regulations in Georgia. Despite 
repeated demands by the National Bank, we haven't been able to 
get changes made in the laws to impose stiffer penalties for 
engaging in retail trading and services with foreign currency. 
As it is, the control agencies are virtually powerless against 
currency violators. We need to institute harsh penalties and 
fines. 
  Don't get me wrong: I don't think administrative methods are 
the only way to expand the coupon's circulation area. We have to 
try to achieve domestic convertibility of the coupon, for the 
Russian ruble at least, so we can import the resources we need 
so badly and get our factories going again. 
  [Saneblidze] But how do we do that? 
  [Kakulia] We can do it. Remember the Russian troop 
contingent 
in Transcaucasia and the Military Field Bank that serves it? 
That bank can legally bring billions of Russian rubles into 
Georgia. Why not conclude an intergovernmental agreement with 
Russia stipulating that money allocated to Russian servicemen on 
our territory be exchanged for coupons at the ruble's current 
exchange rate? That way the banking system can build a certain 
ruble reserve, which will enable to National Bank to set a more 
or less stable rate for the ruble. 
  Again, domestic convertibility of the coupon could be 
greatly 
fostered by the billions of rubles which legal persons in 
Georgia have hidden in the former Soviet republics. A leading 
role in this illegal activity is played by enterprises in the 
state sector which export their goods to neighboring countries 
and then keep their earnings there. They are, to be sure, 
solving some of their own problems that way, but they aren't 
thinking about how Georgia is to pay for its natural gas, 
electricity, raw materials and supplies! It would be very easy 
to toughen up export controls. We need to improve our licensing 
and customs mechanisms. The banking system is already able, by 
means of corresponding accounts, to obtain the funds it has 
coming to it from foreign and neighboring countries. 
  [Saneblidze] What about the 32-percent tax? 
  [Kakulia] Every country has hard-currency reserves forming 
the basis for stabilizing its monetary system and developing its 
economy. They are formed from hard currency earnings held by the 
country's residents. Thirty-two percent of these earnings are to 
be sold to the state, of which 22 percent goes into the republic 
and local currency funds and 10 percent goes to the National 
Bank to stabilize monetary circulation and the exchange rate. 
It's not actually a tax, because in exchange for the 32 percent 
of earnings, enterprises and organizations receive the coupon 
equivalent at the market exchange rate. 
  [Saneblidze] If Georgia joins the ruble zone, will it 
perhaps 
solve a lot of these problems? 
  [Kakulia] Yes, but do we know what the ruble zone is? The 
Russian side hasn't even figured out yet how to incorporate the 
Belarusian monetary system--and Belarus has much better 
macro-economic indicators than Georgia, or any other former 
Soviet republic except the Baltics. Any talk of the ruble zone 
will require detailed information regarding what conditions the 
ruble-issuing country--Russia--will set. The seven conditions I 
found out about in the press are not very sound, to say the 
least. 
  [Saneblidze] To sum up, what is most needed today? 
  [Kakulia] It's hard to put it in a nutshell, but--we have to 
save the coupon. We can only do it if we can achieve the 
domestic convertibility of foreign currency. This will require 
getting Georgia's export earnings into Georgia's banking system. 
We also need to severely restrict credit emissions and thus 
create the conditions forming a real exchange rate for the 
coupon. Slowing down the coupon's slide will create conditions 
to improve the overall macro-economic situation. 
<H8>  * * * </H8>
  So these are the thoughts of a banking professional. 
Nothing can be done with one stroke, apparently, and being hasty 
is like the floundering of a man in quicksand--the harder you 
struggle, the deeper you sink into the muck. 
  But as you can see, there is hope, and, thank God, it 
is serious hope, not a twisted rope. 
  Meanwhile, sad to say, even a priest will steal when 
hungry.

<F P=106> [Article by Jorma Rotko: "Estonian Government Scuttles Large </F>
Bank by Transferring State Transactions"] 
  [Text] Political disputes show in money market 
arrangements. Estonia's largest bank, Eesti Sotsiaalpank, is 
running into difficulties, since the Estonian Government decided 
to transfer the country's budget funds to other banks. 
  The handling of state funds has resulted in an annual cash 
flow for the bank of more than 5 million kroons, and about a 
third of the bank's approximately 1-billion-kroon balance sheet. 
  "Ruthless political maneuvering," commented Rein Miller, the 
bank's CEO and former Estonian finance minister. Heiki Kranich, 
the current finance minister, denies any political motives, but 
without being too convincing. 
  And from the viewpoint of the ruling right-wing Estonian 
Government, the Sotsiaalpank is a very suspect institution. It 
was founded during Gorbachev's era of perestroyka, by 
transferring functions from the Soviet state bank. 
  When the USSR collapsed, the bank was privatized and was 
changed into a corporation. Its capital stock amounted to 2.1 
million kroons in rubles. State enterprises held 98 percent of 
the shares, which at that time were controlled by Russians. 
  Since then the capital stock has increased to 51 million 
kroons. Although capital holds no national allegiance, experts 
claim that Sotsiaalpank is the financial institution where 
Russian businessmen keep their accounts. 
  And this is not all: Rein Miller and Arno Allman who manage 
the bank, were both solid communists in the past, and, in 
addition, Miller also acted as finance minister in the 
governments of Edgar Savisaar and Tiit Vahin, who are 
archenemies of the current government. 
<H5>  The Bank May Go Under </H5>
  During the last few years, a number of Estonian banks have 
failed. The largest of these was Tarto Kommertspank. 
  Contrary to what seems to be customary in Finland, the 
government does run with its money bags to the rescue of the 
banks. Not even deposits are guaranteed, and, as a general rule, 
when the banks have gone bankrupt, the depositors have lost 
every kroon they saved. This has created a wary attitude in 
Estonia. Many people are hoarding their savings at home, and 
accounts empty quickly if any suspicions are cast on a bank's 
liquidity. 
  Finance Minister Kranich vehemently denies that the 
government's intent is to bankrupt Sotsiaalpank. Not everyone 
believes, however, in the benevolence of the government. Two 
members of the parliament have questioned the government on the 
matter. 
  According to Finance Minister Kranich, the government has 
not 
yet decided on the timetable for the transfer of the state's 
funds to other banks. Originally it was to happen quickly, but 
as the bank demanded more time, the government appears to be 
willing to allow it a transition period of a few months. 
  Sotsiaalpank has proposed that it would be allowed to share 
the management of budget funds with the other banks. This 
request will probably not be granted, as the government decision 
unequivocally stipulates that state funds be transferred to 
other financial institutions. These banks are the government 
owned Pohja-Eesti Pank, Uhispank, and Hansa-Pank. 
<H5>  Where Is the Money Laundered? </H5>
  A lot of criminal money circulates in Estonia, but it moves 
in small lots. There are still no laws preventing money 
laundering, and bank secrecy is on a level equal to Switzerland. 
  Kaupo Pollisinski, head of the information department at the 
Estonian Central Bank, is of the opinion, however, that money 
belonging to major international criminals is not laundered 
through Estonia: 
  "Such money laundering starts from amounts of 10 million 
dollars. The entire Estonian economy is still so small that if 
such an amount were to emerge on the market, it would be noticed 
immediately. Smaller crooks, of course, launder their money, but 
this is not of the same scale as is usually understood by 
international money laundering." 
  Rein Miller, CEO of the Sotsiaalpank, said that the bad news 
has not affected deposits to the bank. 
  During the month of February, when the government's decision 
had already been made public, private individuals deposited a 
total of 7 million kroons in funds in the bank. In the view of 
one expert, this says something about both the bank's owners and 
its customers: Future problems have only been discussed in the 
Estonian language press, and no mention of it has been made in 
Russian newspapers. 
<H5>  Hard Struggle </H5>
  Rein Miller did not want to discuss the issue of the 
nationality of the bank's owners, but he claimed that there was 
no foreign capital invested in the bank. It is impossible to 
verify this information, as in Estonia information about 
business ownership can only be acquired through court orders. 
  Sotsiaalpank has launched a strong counterattack and is 
demanding that the issue of placing budget funds should be 
decided through competition among the banks. The bank has also 
appealed to the International Monetary Fund, which certainly is 
interested in how capital is moved around in Estonia. 
  In CEO Miller's view, the whole issue boils down to the fact 
that Sotsiaalpank is not under the control of the government's 
right-wing faction in the same fashion as the three banks to 
which budget funds are being transferred. 
  Finance Minister Kranich, on the other hand, claims that the 
government does not want to cause problems for the bank: 
  "The government decision has obviously been painful for the 
bank, and the bank management has created such public commotion 
that it could scare away depositors," said Kranich. 
  The first strike by the government was launched as early as 
last summer, when the Social Fund was removed from the 
administration of Sotsiaalpank. Through the fund, 2.1 billion 
kroons was funneled annually. However, the decision was not made 
by the government, but by the Board of Social Welfare and 
Health. 
  Economic circles in Estonia are now watching with interest 
to 
see if the "red bank" will be able to survive the next punch. If 
bankruptcy starts to rear its ugly head, no support from the 
public sector can be expected.

<F P=106> [Article by Elisabeth Nordgren: "Waiting for the Good Old </F>
Days"--introductory paragraphs in boldface as published] 
  [Text] All indications are that a fifth column is 
being built up in the Baltic states. Talks on the withdrawal of 
Russian troops from Estonia and Latvia have come to a 
standstill, and Russian military forces totaling some 5,000 men 
are still in those two countries. 
  The several tens of thousands of retired officers 
living all over the Baltic states are also staying prepared for 
an emergency. 
  In addition, even very young Russian officers are being 
pensioned off at a fast pace just now so that they can stay in 
Estonia and Latvia as civilians. 
  Since unemployment among the Russian residents is also 
high in those countries, discontent is on the rise. 
  Another result of the worsening economic and social 
situation for the Russian population in the Baltic states is 
that over half the Russians here voted for the extremist 
Zhirinovskiy in the last Russian parliamentary elections. Since 
those Zhirinovskiy supporters want the Soviet Union to return in 
one form or another, this also means that the Baltic states 
would be incorporated into that Greater Russia. 
  Today HUFVUDSTADSBLADET is beginning a series of 
articles examining the situation of the Russian population in 
the three Baltic states. The first country we will look at is 
Estonia. 
  The assembly hall at the Russian Officers Club in downtown 
Tallinn was chock-full. Close to 1,000 people, most of them 
elderly and resolute Russians -- pensioners, the unemployed 
young, Russian war veterans, and retired officers -- had 
gathered to discuss their rights, housing problems, and pension 
issues. The galleries were also full. There were no vacant seats 
left for all those pouring in later. Also present on the podium 
was a representative of the Estonian Government. An excited and 
tense mood prevailed in the hall, where there were many 
supporters of Zhirinovskiy. 
  Nikolay Stepanov, a retired officer who is chairman of the 
Officers Club, complained about the intolerable situation of war 
veterans. 
  "We have a hard time not only economically but also 
socially. 
The two military hospitals that used to be here have been turned 
over to the Estonians. And now it is expensive to go to the 
hospital. There is nothing left. And our recreational hotel is 
gone." 
  Stepanov is one of many typical examples of how the former 
Soviet military have ended up in a no-man's-land where they have 
been "forgotten" by the Russian Ministry of Defense, which is 
not paying officers' pensions. But neither is it up to the 
Estonian authorities to take responsibility for those tens of 
thousands of military who represent a foreign power but are 
staying in the country camouflaged as civilians. 
<H5>  Fifth Column in Baltic States </H5>
  It looks as though Russia is using that strategy to create a 
fifth column in the Baltic states, since younger and younger 
officers are being retired and settling in the Baltic states as 
civilians. 
  In fact, it is the retired officers who were stationed in 
the 
Baltic states who feel that they have lost the most as a result 
of the Soviet Union's collapse. 
  But it is not just the Soviet Russian officers who have been 
stripped of their privileges. The officers' wives also feel 
harmed. They have lost their priority status in access to 
housing and in lines at the shops. Tatiana Lasuvkina, an 
officer's wife who was born in Sebastopol, lived at a military 
base in Latvia, and now lives in Estonia, is worried that she 
will lose her apartment. In the Soviet era, officers were always 
given the best apartments in the countries where they were 
stationed. And now they do not want to relinquish those 
apartments to Estonians. In addition, the Soviet Union allowed 
its retired officers to choose the country they wanted to live 
in as pensioners. This made Estonia, with its high standard of 
living compared to the rest of the Soviet Union, one of the 
countries most popular with retirees. 
  Moreover, the fact that over half of the Russian population 
living in Estonia (600,000 people, including the military) voted 
for Zhirinovskiy in Russia's latest elections makes this a good 
breeding ground for the kind of invasion of Estonia that 
Zhirinovskiy supporters are campaigning for. And now things have 
also grown more difficult because the talks between Estonia and 
Russia regarding the withdrawal of Russian troops from Estonia 
have broken down, and Estonia and Latvia are both being 
threatened with economic sanctions if the Russian population's 
situation in both countries does not improve. 
<H5>  Zhirinovskiy: Savior in Time of Need </H5>
  Piotr Mihailovich Rozhok, the leader of Zhirinovskiy's 
supporters in Estonia who is now under indictment for inciting 
rebellion against Estonia, is awaiting trial in Tallinn. Rozhok 
himself says he is working for equality and is not guilty of 
breaking any laws. 
  "I don't understand what I am being tried for. I have never 
been guilty of incitement. But I have always defended the 
Russian population's rights here in Estonia. The most important 
thing for me is that Estonia's inhabitants should be equal." 
  Under Estonian law, Zhirinovskiy's Liberal Democratic Party 
cannot operate in Estonia, but Rozhok maintains that the party's 
principles are spreading through the country. Rozhok is betting 
on Zhirinovskiy because he stood up and defended the Russians' 
rights in Estonia. 
  "Our common principle is defense of the Russians' interests. 
Now, of course, the Russians have been completely humiliated. 
The Russians are being exploited more than any other minority 
here in Estonia. We pay 55 percent in taxes in this country, but 
where does the money go: What is the money used for?" Rozhok 
wonders. 
  Rozhok is 100-percent certain that Zhirinovskiy will be 
Russia's next president after Yeltsin, and he also says that the 
Russian presidential election is going to be held as early as 
this fall. 
  "Those who oppose Yeltsin have already shown their strength. 
And the Russian people will never forgive Gorbachev and Yeltsin 
for what they did to the Soviet Union and Russia." 
  Rozhok also says that the Baltic states will become part of 
Russia because they cannot survive without Russia. 
  "We will appeal to the Estonian people for Estonia's 
connection with Russia," says Rozhok, who threatens an economic 
blockade of Estonia if the country violates human rights. 
<H5>  Zhirinovskiy Supporter -- and Unemployed: `No Equality in </H5>
Estonia' 
  Out in the Tallinn suburb of Mustamae lives the young 
Ilnitskiy family. Andrey Ilnitskiy, the father, is a 
Zhirinovskiy supporter who has been unemployed for a year and a 
half. His wife Irina, who is of Estonian-Russian background, 
works as a kitchen maid at a hospital. Their daughter Olga, 
eight years old, goes to a Russian school, and the youngest 
girl, three-year-old Katia, goes to a day nursery. 
  Andrey Ilnitskiy was born in Estonia but cannot speak 
Estonian. Nor has he bothered to seek Estonian citizenship; 
instead, he keeps his Russian passport. That is his way of 
protesting. 
  "There is no equality in Estonia," says Andrey. "But I still 
want to keep on living here. My friends are here, this is where 
I grew up, and I don't know if things would be any better 
somewhere else." 
<H5>  For Russian-Estonian Understanding </H5>
  Ilnitskiy dreams of an Estonia where the Russian and 
Estonian 
residents can live in mutual understanding. He also feels that 
Russian should have official status as the second national 
language. The Russian population should also be given Estonian 
citizenship automatically, with no language test or waiting time 
required. 
  The Ilnitskiy family's two daughters speak Russian to their 
father and a little Estonian to their mother. But otherwise, the 
family "lives" entirely in Russian and does not read Estonian 
newspapers. Wife Irina grew up using both Russian and Estonian 
(her father is Estonian) and went to the Russian school. Now the 
Estonians do not want to pay for Russian-language schools, Irina 
says. Schools and day nurseries must both be paid for by the 
parents themselves. Nor is Russian-language higher education 
available any longer in Estonia. 
  In the hospital kitchen where Irina works, there are both 
Estonian and Russian employees. Irina points out that there has 
been harmony between Estonians and Russians. But the new chef 
wants to get rid of the Russian employees. 
  Andrey formerly worked as a technician at the Volta plant 
with its 2,000 employees. He was also deputy chairman of the 
union. The Volta plant is typical of the Moscow-run plants from 
the Soviet era that have been taken over by the Estonian state 
and now operate at half their capacity. The result is that many 
Russian workers are now unemployed. 
<H5>  No Job Without Estonian-Language Proficiency </H5>
  "It is really hard to find a job here in Tallinn," says 
Andrey. "And when I go to the employment office, I am 
immediately turned away because I can't speak Estonian. In fact, 
the language issue caused me to miss out on a night watchman's 
job that I had my eye on. Also, my Russian name does not go over 
well." 
  In the meantime, Andrey works at odd jobs, but mainly the 
family lives on what his wife earns. Since there is also no 
unemployment insurance to speak of and food prices and rents 
have gone up, times are hard for the Ilnitskiy family. The 
Ilnitskiys currently pay 500 Estonian kroons (about 200 markkas, 
or nearly half the average monthly wage) in rent, but they have 
left the heating bill unpaid. 
  "Tomorrow is shrouded in mystery, and I don't believe I will 
find a permanent job for a long time. But I try to survive day 
by day." 
  The apolitical Russian Social Foundation has now been 
established by the Russian residents to try to collect funds for 
those in need. Since there is no Russian representative in the 
Estonian parliament, it is difficult for the Russian residents 
to protect their interests, even though there are 27 Russian 
members of the Tallinn City Council. But Andrey is hoping that 
the parliamentary elections a year from now will change things. 
He also believes that Zhirinovskiy will speed up the 
negotiations with Estonia regarding increased assistance for the 
Russian residents. 
  "Unfortunately, Russian-Estonian cooperation has ended, but 
thanks to Zhirinovskiy's Estonian colleague Piotr Razhok 
[spelling variation as published], Zhirinovskiy is well informed 
about what happens here." 
  According to Andrey, the tense situation for Estonia's 
Russian population is what drove the people to vote for 
extremists. 
  "It is not the Russian population, but the Estonian 
Government that is responsible for the fact that we voted for 
Zhirinovskiy and now find ourselves in this situation. But at 
least there are a few Estonian members of the Estonian 
parliament who are trying to do something for the Russian 
population." 
  Certainly Andrey Ilnitskiy does not believe there will be 
another Soviet Union, but what he does believe in is a trade 
alliance between Russia and Estonia that will preserve Estonia's 
sovereignty.

To Leave Government Coalition"] 
  [Text] 
  Estonia's Rural Central Faction (EMKE: Eesti Maa 
Keskerakond) will have to decide--whether to stay in the 
government coalition or join the opposition--within the time 
period between the congress of rural people, and the meeting of 
the faction's general council scheduled for May 28, said Ivar 
Raig, EMKE chairman and member of Riigikogu [Estonia's 
parliament], at a press conference that followed the session of 
the faction's central council yesterday. 
  "Once again, we are getting signals that the interests of 
the 
rural people are being ignored. The latest example of that is 
the fact that the finance ministry has not allocated any money 
to the agricultural ministry for paying social stipends to 
students at agricultural-technical schools," Ivar Raag said. 
  "If the government does not, in the near future, pass 
measures aimed at protecting rural residents and guaranteeing 
them a stable life, EMKE will join the opposition," Ivar Raig 
said. 
  Ivar Raig also said that agriculture minister Jaan Leetsar 
is 
ready to resign, in case the faction joins the opposition. At 
the same time it would be difficult for the faction to recall 
reform minister Liia Hanni who has made a great 
contribution 
to speeding up reform, according to Raig. He also said that the 
faction is trying to find a political reason for recalling the 
agricultural minister only. 
  EMKE also discussed, once again, the possibility of forming 
its own faction in Riigikogu. During the year-end government 
crisis EMKE announced that it will not join the opposition for 
three months. "Soon, there will be no other alternative for 
expressing our political identity than forming our own faction, 
like the liberals did," Raig said. 
  He said though that there was no hurry for forming a 
faction, 
because EMKE will be short one delegate, and that forming a 
faction could not take place until April or May. 
  Raig noted that the rural population is the biggest loser in 
reform politics, and that new ground is being gained for solving 
the differences in the political views of rural factions, which 
fosters hope for a bigger representation for the rural 
population in the new Riigikogu. The central council of the 
faction authorized the board to intensify negotiations with the 
Farmers' Council, the Rural League and the League of Lawful 
Owners regarding the formation of a possible election alliance. 
  EMKE is also seeking substantive reform of the government, 
and wants the Ministry of Agriculture to be changed into the 
Ministry of Rural Economy, which would include specialists 
dealing with the production of Land, Forest and Fishing Offices, 
now reporting to the Ministry of Environment. 
  Reform minister Liia Hanni said that the government 
has 
agreed to the EMKE proposal for carrying out a substantive 
reform of government and its structures, but this has been held 
up by the law for organizing the government. "Right now, 
unnecessary tensions and discussions are being generated that 
can put the government to a test, internally," Hanni said. 
She added that it is necessary to work out a more specific 
structure for ministries and district governments. 
  Hanni mentioned that since the government coalition 
had 
found no common positions on protecting the domestic market and 
on the income policies of agriculture, even at the time the 
coalition agreement was reached, EMKE has found itself at odds 
with the rest of the government coalition. She thinks, however, 
that any juxtaposition of rural residents against their urban 
counterparts should be avoided. 
  About her possible resignation, Hanni said that 
whenever 
the issue of EMKE's joining the opposition comes up, she will 
make up her mind. So far, she has not had to face that issue.

<F P=106> [Article by Toomas Sildam: "Estonia Does Have a State </F>
Border, After All"] 
  [Text] 
  At a press conference held yesterday Tarmo Kouts, 
executive director of the Border Guard Service, said that last 
year 11.3 million persons were checked crossing the borders of 
Estonia, 29,827 of whom were sent back, because they did not 
have a visa or other necessary documents. Between check points, 
2,562 persons were caught--for visa violations or illegal border 
crossings. At the same time, illegal merchandise valued at more 
than 3 million kroons (calculated at state prices) was 
seized. 
  More than 1,300 persons were sent out, who had been here 
illegally. Border guards discovered 640 falsified passports. 
  "Last summer at the port of Tallinn, for example, three 
Kurdish refugees presented such expertly crafted Polish 
passports that they were being used for the third time `around.' 
Or let's recall the story of how some Kurdish refugees showed up 
at the check point at Ikla, equipped with genuine Latvian 
passports showing Azerbaijani as their nationality," said Tarmo 
Kouts, executive director of the Border Guards Service. 
  There are 38 check points (12 a year ago) along Estonia's 
borders, employing 2,446 persons. "Last year, their average 
monthly salary was 871 kroons. Despite the old Estonian saw: Let 
the wages match the work, we are still trying to maintain: The 
work first, and wages later principle, but..." Tarmo Kouts 
mused, recalling a current truism: "A cheap state official is 
the most expensive kind." 
  Last year, however, the government did approve the concept 
of 
border guard, the decree for the Border Guard Service and, since 
February 1 of this year, the new structure of border guard has 
taken effect. But the biggest problems, supposedly, are still 
stemming from gaps in legislation. Thus, Estonia does not have a 
border law ("We hope it will be passed this spring," Tarmo 
Kouts said optimistically), and a border guard law. 
  The legislative vacuum can lead to absurdities, where people 
involved in the illegal transport of Kurdish refugees cannot be 
punished. 
  Thus, on October 25, 1994, a party of Kurdish refugees was 
taken aboard the Vessel Vironia from Pirita to the port of 
Lindigo in Sweden. A criminal suit was filed against the 
sailors, but the Tallinn City Court cleared them of charges, 
because Estonia did not have legally fixed state borders... 
During the night before October 27, 1992, 129 Kurdish refugees 
were taken to the Bornholm island of Denmark aboard vessels Lyly 
and Meotida. Two weeks later a criminal suit was filed, and 
dropped on June 27 last year, again for lack of a "legally fixed 
state border"... On February 2, 1993, the Vessel Revalia took 
108 Kurdish refugees to Helsinki's Suomenlinna. The criminal 
suit was dropped on June 30... 
  The border guards are very optimistic aboutbout the the 
court 
case coming up for March 7. In it, two men are accused of trying 
to take 24 Kurdish refugees from Tallinn to Finland on a vessel 
called Orbiit. 
  Tarmo Kouts believes that: "Border guards will already 
start to benefit from the law on surveillance activity passed 
this week, which will enable us to gather information about 
events happenings in the border region, instead of relying on 
police all the time." 
  About the incident of 66 Kurdish refugees discovered in a 
refrigeration van on board the passenger ferry Estonia last 
Saturday night, we now know that, according to preliminary data, 
16 of these people had left the camp at Harku secretly. The rest 
of them presumably came to Estonia at the beginning or middle of 
last week, and had been hiding somewhere near Tallinn. How they 
crossed the border (both entering and leaving Estonia), will be 
explained by the heads of different government agencies. At any 
rate, yesterday morning there was a meeting dealing with this at 
the Ministry of the Interior that will be continued next Monday.

<F P=106> [Article by Lembit Tepp: "Twice As Many Die Than Are Born in </F>
the Cities"] 
  [Text] 
  One result of the confusion caused by Estonia's 
transition to market economy is the sudden drop in the nation's 
birthrate and an increase in mortality. After 1988, the number 
of births started to decline rapidly. In 1989, compared to 1988, 
768 fewer children were born, in 1990, this number was 2,752, in 
1991 5,740, in 1992 7,071, and in 1993 as many as 9,757 fewer 
children were born. 
  The number of children born in 1993 made up only 61 
percent of the 1988 figure. 
  (This is, however, a preliminary figure and could be revised 
somewhat). At the same time, the number of deaths, compared to 
1988, was up by 1,079 in 1990, by 1,154 in 1991, by 1,554 in 
1992 and by 2,695 in 1993. The difference between the numbers of 
births and deaths, or the natural population growth, has been 
going down steadily after 1988, and became negative since 1991. 
When the nation's total population grew naturally by 6,509 
people in 1988, by 5,762 people in 1989 and by 2,778 people in 
1990, then, in 1991, the population decreased by 385, in 1992 by 
2,116 and in 1993, based on the birth and death registries, by 
5,943 people. 
  A sudden drop in the birth rate occurred at the beginning of 
1993, a significant increase in the number of deaths, compared 
to data for the same months of previous years, occurred during 
the periods from March to April and from June to September of 
1993, and during the last months--November and December, of 1992 
and 1993. When in 1991, the number of deaths registered for the 
months of December exceeded the number of births for the same 
month 1.3 times, and for December of 1992 1.5 times, then, in 
December of 1993, this factor was more than 1.9, and as high as 
2.1 in the cities. In January of 1994, also, the number of 
deaths exceeded the number of births by a factor of 1.7. Locally 
these figures were 2.6 for Narva, 2.2 for Parnu, and more 
than two times for Tallinn and the eastern Virmumaa district. 
Should such a trend continue, or even stabilize, Estonia's 
population will dimish by one half within one generation. 
  The reasons for this phenomenon are not found in the family, 
but in conteporary economic policies, that are causing: 
  an ever-widening gap between the income of most of the 
population and the prices of vital goods, 
  which has an especially painful grip on low-income families, 
unemployed and under-employed persons, and the elderly and 
handicapped. What can a married couple offer to their children 
if the take-home pay of the head of the family goes almost 
entirely for under-heated housing and a market basket limited to 
physiological necessities. But what happens if the spouse has to 
stay home with the child? 
  When, during 1992, the state was trying to prevent the 
situation for these groups from worsening by offsetting the 
rising cost of living through repeated increases in minimum 
wages--on which depend the amounts for child support, 
unemployment and retirement benefits then, since October of 
1992, the minimum wage has been frozen, along with child support 
and unemployment benefits, as well as support payments for the 
handicapped and the elderly. At the same time, prices of food 
items and necessities have been going up steadily. When the cost 
of a market basket to meet the minimal physiological needs of a 
person (which contains 7.6 kg of bread, 1.5 kg of sugar, 9.2 
liters of milk or kefir, 300 gm butter, 600 gm cheese, 2.3 kg 
meat, 600 gm vegetable oil, 15 eggs, 6.1 kg potatoes, 9.2 kg 
vegetables and 1.5 kg fruit a month) was 136 kroons in October 
of 1992, when minimum wage was established at 300 kroons a 
month, then, in December of 1993, it was 252 kroons, or up 1.85 
times. When, in October of 1992, state child support (90 kroons 
a month) could buy 0.66 minimum market basket's worth of food, 
then, in December of 1993, that figure was only 0.36. Up, in 
particular, are the prices for foods containing animal protein 
and vitamins, which are especially important for a growing child. 
  In January of 1994, compared to October of 1992, prices had 
gone up for pork 2.4 times, poultry and beef 2.1 times, beef 
liver 3.5 times, grade I cooking sausage 2.3 times, higher grade 
cooking sausage 2.0 times, higher grade liverwurst 2.5 times, 
blood sausage 2.8 times, cottage cheese more than two times, 
cheese more than 1.8 times, eggs 2.3 times, smoked and canned 
fish more than 1.8 times, canned soups with meat 2.5 times and 
without meat 2.4 times, green peas 1.8 times, bread made out of 
grade I wheat flour 2.9 times, and bread made out of higher 
grade wheat flour 2.3 times, rye bread close to 3 times, barley 
bread 2.3 times, string spaghetti 2.7 times. More conservative 
increases were noted for pasteurized 2.5 percent milk at close 
to 1.5 times, butter and sweet cream 1.1 times, sour cream 1.2 
times, kefir 1.7 times, fresh fish 1.2 times, potatoes 1.1 
times, carrots, 1.2 times, local apples 1.3 times, raisins 1.2 
times, farina 1.4 times, lemonade close to 1.5 times, soft candy 
1.1 to 1.5 times. Prices have dropped for sugar, coffee, 
buckwheat, rice and citrus fruit, which had been particularly 
high for a while. 
  Prices have also gone up on children's clothing, footwear, 
school supplies, medications, and community and other services 
geared to children. Prices for street shoes for children have 
gone up 2.8 times, childrens sneakers 2.9 times, underwear 2.4 
times, childrens' dresses 1.7 times, childrens' cotton socks 1.9 
times, tights, 1.7 times, childrens' sandals 1.5 times, jackets 
1.4 times, notebooks 1.7 times, and school lunches more than 1.4 
times. Prices of medications have gone up 3.1 times, on the 
average. Nursery school fees have gone up 1.5 times, electricity 
1.9 times, warm water 1.3 times, cold water 2.7 times, and 
sewage fees more than 3 times, for which children are charged at 
the same rate as adults. The cost of a three-room dwelling has 
already reached twice the amount of both minimum wage and the 
average pensioners' benefit for a month. Communal fees charged 
on children also exceed the state benefit for child support. 
  Prices of Goods Are Approaching World Market Prices, 
Even for Domestic Production, even though our wages are 15 
to 20 times lower than levels prevailing under world market 
pricing. It would be interesting to know who pockets the 
difference? For a great portion of the population, the 
purchasing power of the kroon has gone down to almost one half, 
but no compensation has been planned, since rescuing a drowning 
person is up to the one drowing. 
  In this situation, young people have chosen to avoid both 
marriage and childbirth, which cuts down on state expenditures 
on child support. Proceeds from the rising prices of items 
consumed by children have helped to meet the state's budget. 
  Since 9,757 fewer children were born in 1993, than there 
were 
in 1988, the state saved 8.8 million kroons on one-time birth 
support, while support payments to mothers also went down by 
42.2 million kroons. And, since after the year of 1989, 25,000 
fewer children were born overall, the state saves at least 27 
million kroons a year on child support. The recent increase in 
child support by 25 kroons for the second child and by 50 kroons 
for each child thereafter, does not save the population from 
economic genocide. Besides, the number of second children born 
is down to half of what it used to be, and the birth of a fourth 
child or beyond a rarity, indeed.

<F P=106> [Article by Urmo Kohv: "Port of Tallinn Developing in All </F>
Directions"] 
  [Text] 
  For the coming year, according to Peeter Palu, 
executive director of the Port of Tallinn [RE Tallinna Sadam], 
there are two major tasks facing the company: To increase the 
handling of goods up to 10 percent, and to secure financing for 
expanding the Port of Muuga. The financial and economic 
indicators for the enterprise show that last year's biggest 
increase occurred in the area of passengers, and that goods in 
transit accounted for the biggest part of the volume. Last 
year's net volume turned out to be 790 million kroons, which 
exceeded the 1992 figure by more than two times. 
  "In addition to passengers, last year's increase in volume 
showed up in practically all categories of goods," Peeter Palu 
said at his meeting with the media. 
  The company's total volume of goods handled in 1993 was 12.5 
million tonnes (a 17 percent increase). The principal business 
of the Port of Tallinn--the republic's export-import and the 
volume of goods in transit (through the Midtown and Muuga ports) 
increased by 29.5 percent the last year. The bulk of commercial 
hauling is made up of goods in transit (79 percent), as most of 
the loading volume is made up of grain (36 percent). Last year's 
biggest increase (200.1 percent) occurred in the area of liquid 
cargo. 
  Palu said there was a significant increase in the handling 
of 
goods at all the ports. The Midtwon port, which had been 
suffering from a gradual erosion of coastal traffic, had a 30 
percent increase in export-import and goods in transit. There 
was also a 25 percent increase at the Muuga port, and a 49 
percent increase at the port of Kopli. "This year, we consider 
it realistic to secure an increase of 8 to 10 percent in the 
area of handling goods," Palu said. 
  Last year, 2,256,000 passengers went through the Port of 
Tallinn (a 68 percent increase), in previous years these figures 
were 1,341,000, 900,000 and 400,000 respectively. 
<H5>  The Midtown Port Will Become a Passenger Port </H5>
  "Our projections call for 5 million passengers in the 
future," said Palu, adding that this figure is expected to be 
reached before the end of the century. "With this in mind, we 
have concentrated our efforts on developing the Midtown port 
facility into a real passenger port." 
  The passenger terminal at the Midtown port is currently 
being 
expanded, which has resulted in a 50 percent increase in the 
available area, so far. The second floor of the two-story 
terminal is going to house offices for the border guard and 
customs services, while the entire first floor will serve as the 
waiting room and check-in. Depending on the departure area of 
the ship, the terminal will be open at two ends. At the moment, 
finishing touches (installation of elevators and escalators, 
etc.) are being added to the terminal, due to be completed by 
May. 
  Last year saw the completion of a digital telephone system 
connecting the ports, using Siemens technology. This year's 
planning calls for further development of the information 
system, and for implementing the radar-based navigational 
project. The latter will be installed not only at Midtown, but 
also at the Muuga and Kopli ports. Palu said that these radars 
can also be used by the border guard. 
<H5>  Midtown port To Be Connected With Old Town </H5>
  Most of the piers at the Midtown port have been repaired and 
paved and, by the end of the year, proper port gates will be 
completed, along with construction on pier 17. Palu said that 
the main objective is connecting the Midtown port with the Old 
Town, and this is why agreements are being sought for 
demolishing all the little-used structures within the port's 
territory. So far, a swimming pool and a workshop have already 
disappeared from view. The admiral's pool building, however, is 
being remodeled into a terminal for smaller ships, where big 
yachts should have access as early as next year. 
  The matter of getting rid of the concrete plant next to the 
town hall, that has been awaiting resolution for 15 years is, 
for the time being, snagged in what seems like an endless court 
battle (the plant, for example, is still part of the 
Gosimushestvo listing as property belonging to Russia, while the 
plant's administrative owner AS Meekam is listed as one of the 
creditors of the now defunct Commercial Bank of Tartu). The 
plant making foundation blocks has incorporated some property 
belonging to the Russian army and, according to Palu "no clean 
moves" have been made there up to this day. 
<H5>  Kuwait Counts on the Business Project of the Muuga Port </H5>
  "Our primary task this year is financing the expansion at 
the 
port of Muuga," Palu said. "We sent Kuwait a business plan in 
December and, according to the reply received, Kuwait's fund is 
counting on the project proposed, and on financing its 
infrastructure, which is close to half the cost of the total 
project. Right now, we are doing profitability studies on the 
infrastructure, according to Kuwait's specifications, which we 
hope to complete within a few months, so that we could give 
specific answers to questions asked by the investors. 
  Financing for expanding the port at Muuga, however, is not 
being discussed with Kuwait only. Negotiations are also under 
way with the European Investment Bank, the World Bank, and other 
international credit institutions. "Financial matters are firm 
only once the money has been received," Palu remarked. 
  Construction is now going on at the Muuga plant for an idea 
long in the making--a warehousing facility for the transit of 
cotton coming from Central Asia. Pier 6, now under construction, 
is intended for handling coal (with help from the port of Kopli, 
efforts will be made to further reduce the mountains of coal 
accumulating on the piers of the Midtown port). Currently, the 
transport of coal through the Midtown port has dropped from 3 
million tonnes to 1.1 million tonnes (partially due to reduced 
coal exports from Russia). A considerable increase, however, has 
lately been noted in the transit volume of metal through the 
Muuga and Midtown ports. 
<H5>  Ten Offers Received For South Port of Paldiski </H5>
  Palu said that, as of today, 10 project proposals have been 
received in the bidding to rent out the South Port of Paldiski. 
Of these proposals, three call for a processed crude oil 
terminal, one for hauling scrap metal, one for metal exports and 
the rest for expediting timber and gravel exports. 
  "Before the port's administrative council can make a 
decision, work will have to be completed on the piers, along 
with depth studies. The primary criteria for evaluating business 
plans will be utilization of local labor, and guaranteeing 
environmental safety," Palu said. 
  Still, building a proper commercial port at Paldiski would 
require big expenditures, since not only the railroad, but also 
the highway and existing structures and communications are in a 
bad shape and need to be replaced. The most valuable part of the 
port is thought to be the 360 meter-long breakwater and the 
favorable natural conditions (Paldiski is one of the two 
completely ice-free ports in Estonia). The water depth of the 
South Port, at the mouth of the bay, is 10 meters, diminishing 
to about 4 meters near the land pier. Palu thinks that further 
deepening may be considered for the future. An operating 
management team for the South Port has been found by the Port of 
Tallinn and, for the time being, the port is engaged in the 
transport of gravel. 
  The 6-meter deep North Port of Paldiski will reportely be 
leased out by the Ministry of Defense but, so far, results of 
the bidding have not been made available yet. The port will be 
leased out for three years, while the leasing party is not 
restricted to operating a military port (access needs to be 
available, however, for defense and border guard vessels). 
<H5>  Development of Small Ports Continues </H5>
  Out of the small ports, planning calls for fixing up the 
Triigi, Orissaare, and Koiguste ports. Last year, Port of 
Tallinn made direct outlays amounting to roughly 53 million 
kroons for the development of small ports. 
  "Port of Tallinn considers it expedient to finish 
construction on the small ports before they are turned over to 
municipal ownership," Palu said. "In small ports that are fixed 
up properly, we do not see competition but rather distribution 
of labor, since the latter complement the work of the big ports." 
  Palu also expressed hope that some organizations making use 
of small ports will emerge in the near future, since the state 
is not behaving reasonably with its ports right now. "The state 
does not yet have an overview of its ports, also the rules of 
the game have not yet been put in place, so as to rule out the 
existence of numerous pirate ports, harmful to the state," Palu 
said.

Must Be Made Smoother"] 
  [Text] 
  Based on data from the economic ministry, the total of 
foreign capital invested in Estonia during 1993 was 906,966,000 
kroons. Is that little or is that a lot? More, in proportion, 
than some of our other Eastern European neighbors who did not 
put their best foot forward, but certainly less than expected. 
To support the effort of bringing foreign investors to Estonia, 
the creation of a Foreign Investment Agency 
[Valisinvesteeringute Agentuur] is currently being 
contemplated that would report administratively to the Ministry 
of Economics. 
  Riho Rasman, counsel to the economic ministry, told 
PaEVALEHT that the agency to be created is planning to 
support investments in two ways. On one hand, an investor 
arriving in the Republic of Estonia knows that the Foreign 
Investment Agency can provide him with information about 
investment opportunities at all times--from general legislation 
up to specific projects. For business partners, he will be 
offered a choice of either state or private enterprises. On the 
other hand, the Foreign Investment Agency should develop into an 
organization that helps Estonian investors go outside the state 
and to consult them. 
  Riho Rasman said that there has been talk of such an agency 
for at least a year-and-a-half now, its formation had also been 
discussed in connection with creating the Privatization Agency. 
The need for a structure that would promote all of Estonia as a 
favorable place to invest has been felt all along. By now, the 
idea is so ripe that both money and the people to bring it about 
have been found. The agency will be starting its operations as 
soon as possible. 
<H5>  Last Year, Most Investments Were Made in Industry </H5>
  This is where foreign entrepreneurs invested roughly 409.5 
million kroons, or 45 percent of the investment total. Of the 
total capital outlay, 26 percent went into wholesale and retail, 
8 percent into insurance and finance, and 7 percent into real 
estate. These were followed by 6 percent for transport and 
communications, 3 percent for agriculture, and 2 percent for 
hotels and restaurants. Foreign investment capital placed in the 
rest of the business sectors last year amounted to 14,886,000 
kroons, which is also roughly 2 percent of the investment total. 
Following the structure of investments by different sectors of 
the economy, one is struck by the growing significance of sales 
activity, which seems to go naturally with the present state of 
Estonia's economy. 
<H5>  Closer Neighbors Have Been More Active </H5>
  Data from the economic ministry shows that most of last 
year's foreign investments--31 percent of the total--came to 
Estonia from Sweden. Next was Finland with 22 percent. It is 
interesting to note that the United States from across the ocean 
came in third with 16 percent, and placing fourth with 6 percent 
was Russia, whose secret invasion of state capital into Estonia 
has been a subject of serious discussions lately. 
  Further down the list of last year's bigger investors in 
Estonia is Germany with 4 percent, Italy with 3 percent, and 
Great Britain with 2 percent. The portion of investments from 
all other countries made up 16 percent of the total. 
<H5>  Why Invest In Estonia? </H5>
  The economic ministry introduces Estonia to foreign 
investors 
as a state with a relatively stable political situation. 
Besides, Estonia could also be presented as a traditional 
industrial country, where a high educational level is coupled 
with European culture. It has also become customary to point out 
Estonia's location on the map, and tell the investors about the 
opportunities afforded by Estonia's favorable position between 
the East and the West. 
  A stable monetary unit, quality work force, low wages, 
permissibility of taking out profits, and the opportunity to own 
land in Estonia, should seem like positive features in the eyes 
of foreign entrepreneurs and financial people. The main features 
of economic policy being carried out by Estonia's current 
government: Restructuring, geared to joining the European Union, 
economic integration of the Baltic states, planned free trade 
agreements with Russia and other CIS states, giving up 
protectionism, accelerating privatization and ownership reform, 
free trade zones (in Paldiski, for example). Securing 
competition in banking, and a balanced state budget should also 
create interest in foreign investors. A different matter is, of 
course, how well we succeed in implementing the professed 
policies. Even the Foreign Investment Agency about to be 
created, cannot offer anybody an Estonia that is better than it 
actually looks.

<F P=106> [Article by Statistics Committee of Republic of Latvia: </F>
"Statistics Committee Releases Data on Foreign Trade"] 
  [Text] In 1993 the foreign trade turnover of the Republic 
of Latvia reached 1,349 million Ls. This foreign trade turnover 
figure is based on information from bills of lading that the 
State Statistics Committee receives from the Customs Bureau. 
This foreign trade figure also includes supplies delivered to 
the Russian armed forces on the territory on Latvia, trade 
transactions conducted on Latvian fishing vessels outside of the 
territory of Latvia, import and export of natural gas and 
electrical power, as well as adjustments to the figures for 
imports of fuels. Additionally, Latvia received about 11,696,000 
Ls of humanitarian aid and sent about 618,000 Ls. 
  It must be noted that in 1993 Latvia's balance of foreign 
trade was negative -- Latvian exports were 52,781 thousand Ls, 
but imports were 52,921 Ls. This is primarily the result of a 
significant reduction in the export of refined petroleum 
products from Latvia. 
  Analysis of the scope of Latvia's product imports 
shows that the most important trading partner for Latvia was 
Russia. Last year Latvia's imports from Russia were 181.9 
million Ls or 28.5% (of total imports). Latvia also had 
significant imports from Germany -- 63.7 million Ls or 
10%, 
Lithuania -- 61.2 million Ls, or 9.6%, Sweden -- 33.8 
million 
Ls, or 5.4%, Finland -- 26.9 million Ls, or 4.2%, 
Belarusia -- 
26.5 million Ls, or 4.1%, Estonia -- 25.2 million Ls or 
3.9%. 
  Review of 1993 Product Exports, broken down by 
country, reveals, that Russia was Latvia's largest export 
partner to which were exported products valued at 200.1 million 
Ls, Netherlands -- 55.1 million Ls or 8.2%, Germany -- 
44.5 
million Ls or 6.6%, Sweden -- 43.8 million Ls or 
6.5%, 
Ukrainia -- 40.1 million Ls or 5.9%,, Belarusia -- 34.4 
million 
Ls or 5.1%. 
  Energy and fuels were the most important export at 
45.3% of 
total imports. In 1993 diesel fuel comprised 12.8% of all 
imports, gasoline -- 8.7%, heavy fuel oil -- 7.8%, 
natural gas 
-- 8.1%, and electrical power -- 3.7%. 
  We must note that 98% of energy and fuel imports 
(including 
corrections to fuel oil data) were imported from republics of 
the former Soviet Union territory (including Estonia and 
Lithuania.) 
  After energy imports the most important categories of 
imports 
are land transportation vehicles (excluding rail) -- 8.9%, 
mechanical equipment --7%, electrical machinery and 
equipment 
-- 2.9%. Transportation vehicles were primarily imported 
from 
Germany -- 27.4% (of total vehicle imports), Russia -- 
20.2%. 
Mechanical equipment was imported from Germany -- 23.5% 
and 
Russia -- 15.8%. Electrical machinery and equipment 
imported 
from Russia -- 23.5% and from Finland -- 14.2%. 
  The structure of Latvia's exports demonstrates that the 
bulk of Latvia's exports are the result of transit trade. For 
example, fuel oil and refined petroleum products exports totaled 
13.9% in 1993, including diesel fuel 8.4% and jet 
fuel 2.1%, 
heavy fuel oil 1.3%. The bulk of this product was shipped 
to 
Netherlands -- 48% and Sweden -- 17.4%. 
  In 1993 this category saw a dramatic reduction as a 
percentage of total exports. By the third quarter of 1993 
petroleum fuels were 6.9% of total exports and by the 
fourth 
quarter this percentage had dropped to only 1.7%. 
  Wood and wood products exports make up a significant share 
of 
Latvian exports -- 8.8%. Other significant exports -- 
wrought 
iron -- 7.7%, autobusses --5.3%, electrical 
machinery and 
equipment -- 4.8%, milk and milk products --3.1%, 
furniture -- 
3.0%; wood and wood products were primarily exported to 
Great 
Britain -- 31.6% of total wood exports, Sweden -- 
21.1%, 
Finland --13.1%; wrought iron exports were structured as 
follows: Thailand -- 23.6%, China -- 13.5%, Poland 
11.1%; 
electrical machinery and equipment -- Russia -- 60.5%; 
milk and 
milk products -- Azerbeijan -- 32.1%, Russia -- 
18.7%, 
Turkmenia -- 16.9%; furniture -- Russia -- 42.9%, 
Germany -- 
19.7%. 
  It is noteworthy that natural gas made up 28.5% of 
all 
imports from Russia but electrical power was 53% of 
imports 
from Estonia. All of the natural gas and electrical power 
exported from Latvia to Russia reflect energy supplied to the 
Russian military forces in Latvia.

  [Text] Latvian wood products exports doubled in 1993 over 
1992 levels. 1994 exports should also increase over 1993 levels. 
This is viewed as quite attainable by State Minister of Forests 
Kazimir Shlakota, which will retain its prior designation as 
Ministry of Forests through 1994, despite the fact that the 
agency is now subordinate to the Ministry of Agriculture. 
  The mix of exports is also improving. The log sell-off craze 
has ended. But there is little to grieve over what has passed. 
If at one time we had not exported unprocessed logs and 
pulpwood, where would the funds have come from to acquire 
equipment for cutting timber and for sawing lumber? Now we can 
cut and sell boards. 
  - Now we are preparing for the next stage. A plywood 
enterprise is already in production in Riga. That yields $600 
per cubic meter. Sawn lumber is about 110-115 dollars per cubic 
meter. In the ramp up period, while local workers learn how to 
prepare and select wood for the plant, local wood will comprise 
only 20% of the production while the balance will be 
imported 
from Germany and Finland. By next year Latvian wood will make up 
50% of production and the following year this will jump 
to 75%. 
  Four firms will begin production in Latvia this year that 
make wood panels for furniture making from wood slats. This will 
create new opportunities for furniture manufacturing. Already 
Latvian furniture makers are working and exporting to the West. 
We must, however, meet local demand for furniture where last 
year over five million worth of furniture was imported into 
Latvia from Germany and Finland, even where our own products are 
superior. A German child's bed costs 320 Ls. One just like it 
that is produced in Latvia costs 120 Ls (and these are exported 
to Germany!). It appears that our people are ready to pay 200 Ls 
for the label Made in Germany. 
  The most important problems -- to clarify available raw 
resources and production capacity, which is now sufficiently 
available that we are running out of resources. That is an 
energy problem, because there is a massive effort to convert 
furnaces to burn wood and wood chips. But will there be wood to 
burn? 
  The second problem -- restart the paper industry. At this 
point only the Ligatne factory is in production. Two 
paper-making machines need to be started in Sloka. Paper carton 
production also needs to be started in Ranka. Russian paper has 
become cheap. Even the expensive Finish paper has become 
advantageous due to its quality. This is why the Latvian 
producer has to drop his price (reprocessing newsprint, reducing 
irrational energy consumption, using production waste for fuel) 
and improve his quality. 
  Changes in Latvia's forestry -- due to the privatization of 
wood processing enterprises and to reallocation of governmental 
functions -- was begun a bit too early by our Ministry, if we 
take into account the overall status of the country. We hoped 
that privatization would be implemented quickly -- in reality, 
in three years virtually nothing has happened in the 
enterprises. At the same time these enterprises have been robbed 
to nothingness. We also expected that the divisions between 
national, local government and private forests would have been 
rapidly and clearly established. 
  It is finally becoming easier. Most importantly, we have let 
energetic people operate in the forests. We established very low 
fees to be paid to the State treasury to permit farmers and 
small enterprises to start felling logs and making money with 
little up-front cost. This, however, was done at the expense of 
forest management -- less money to pay forester wages. 
  Latvians are slow by temperament. This is why for a time it 
seemed that little was happening in this field. Movement began 
in earnest, however, last year when over a thousand private 
sawmills, carpentry shops and furniture factories began 
production. Each gave work to from five to even a hundred 
employees. In a year's time these enterprises got on their feet 
with virtually no financial investment. But the real flowering 
of the wood-processing industry lies ahead. The export of sawn 
lumber has grown six-fold. This has been done by the small, 
rural sawmills. The large mills have little to offer, because 
they have problems with production quality. These are no longer 
the times when we can produce crooked flooring where a cat can 
fall through the cracks! Bit by bit local demand is also picking 
up in construction. 
  At this time our exports are hitting the limits of our 
forest 
resources. There are no more logs in Latvia. We must begin to 
think about importing wood for processing in Latvia. This is now 
beginning. This year wood will be imported from Finland 
(processing is cheaper here) as well as from Lithuania and 
Russia where wood processing firms have not thrived because 
there the State attempted to hold on to the wood processing 
industry. The Estonian wood processing industry was immediately 
converted to the free market, but we attempted to regulate the 
conditions when these became critical and forest products 
workers wages became unacceptable. We then lowered duties and 
tariffs to assure a stable 30-40% profitability. This is 
why 
wood processing is the only industrial sector in Latvia that can 
develop on the basis of its own resources. Farmers at this time 
do not have other comparably secure sources of profits, which 
can also be used for other farming needs. 
  -- But how does this development affect the forest 
itself? Is there a basis for concerns about the rapid cutting of 
our forests? 
  -- I believe that our explanations have helped, because now 
people are less upset. 
  At this time we can process about 6.5 million cubic 
meters of wood per annum. Last year, we processed only 
4.7 million, but 1.8 million cubic meters remained in 
the field. 400,000 cubic meters were not processed by state 
enterprises in their prolonged prebankruptcy condition. At the 
same time, 1.4 million cubic meters were not logged in the 
former kolkhoz forests, which are being converted to private 
ownership, because the conversion is far too slow. There are too 
few specialists who can determine borders and resolve disputes 
among heirs. These disputes are becoming stronger by the day as 
it becomes clear that the forest represents real wealth. 
  The pre-war Forestry Department managed 1,270,000 hectares 
of 
forest. We can hope that we will regain control of 1,200,000 
hectares losing 70,000 to road-building and to private farmers. 
About 1,300,000 hectares should be transferred to private 
ownership and about 100,000 to local governments. 
  What will happen with the State's share? We want to 
straighten the borders, and sell small holdings in turn 
purchasing forest land adjoining larger forests. In any case, I 
do not desire to sell-off the nation's forests. First, until 
1996 forest property in Latvia will be very cheap. This is 
because many owners who have reclaimed their land don't have a 
clear idea what to do with it, and are selling it off. This 
drives down the price. Secondly, the government can gain greater 
value from the forest through careful management instead of 
selling it. Why should you take a hen to market, if you can make 
good money by selling its eggs? (I hope that private owners 
understand this and that by 1996 that the forest selling boom 
comes to an end.) 
  The capabilities of the national forest management system 
are 
demonstrated by the stable growth of exports. (We do not do any 
logging. This is done by private loggers who pay the government 
a stump fee. It is however, possible, in time that we will be 
able to lease a parcel including a brigade of loggers.) Third, 
the national forests must remain as a place where people can 
pick berries and mushrooms and rest. It will become more 
difficult to do this in a private forest. Forest preserves and 
reservations can be formed in the expanse of the national 
forests. 
  -- How have new private owners of forests responded to 
the strict government guidelines for forest management and use 
(which came into force on January 31). It is no secret that many 
of these people have the attitude, "This forest belongs to me 
and I can do with it what I want!" 
  -- Private owners can only use their forest resources if 
they 
have a project that has been developed with the forest developer 
and the State forester. The owner who does not have a project 
must receive written permission from the forester with each use. 
  At this time the reaction of the owners is negative. They 
feel that they will know best what to do. This is why we try to 
explain that this policy serves their own interests. Why should 
you log your birch now if you will barely get 100 Ls? Why not 
wait a decade when you will get 4,000 Ls from each hectare? 
  If you must log now, then the next time when you will be 
able 
to earn 4,000 Ls from your birch will be 50-60 years from now. 
But it is hard to explain to a beggar, who needs those 1000 Ls 
today. 
  A person, who wants to be a real proprietor, must know what 
he can extract from his property. This is why it is important to 
establish a project, a 15 year plan, how to maximize the yield 
from the forest resource. 
  Most new forest owners are people with no experience with 
very poor prior knowledge. It is no accident to see forests 
where the owners have mowed down the trees completely 
-- as if they were in the land of their enemy and not their own. 
And then their is the share that belongs to the heirs reclaiming 
their land who are bent on selling it immediately at all costs, 
because they do not have an idea what to do with it. This is why 
we are pushing the passage of this law to explain to these new 
owners what wealth a real proprietor can get from his forest. 
  This is why I urge those who are repossessing their forests 
to read the specialty magazine Forest Life! At the 
Ogre Forest Technicum, a new organization is being formed called 
the Association of Forest Users which is already operational in 
four regions. This organization has begun training, specialists 
are going to the countryside to give lectures and to provide 
explanations. 
  Forest owners will have to adjust to the fact that forests 
will be managed only by those who have the necessary knowledge. 
If they won't have this knowledge themselves, then they will 
have to hire specialists who have the knowledge. Anybody can buy 
a car who has the money, but only those can drive who have a 
driver's license in their pocket. A forest is a far more 
complicated affair, than driving a car, believe me!

<F P=106> [Article by K. Briviba: "Demographic Situation of Ethnic </F>
Latvians Detailed"] 
  [Text] The Latvian nation experienced a very heavy shock in 
the sixteenth and seventeenth century when war and the Black 
plague ravaged the land. The Kurlandish writer Jekabs Jansevskis 
described this era in his book Mezvidus laudis (People of 
the Forest) as follows: "The bright side of this plague is 
that it quickly eliminates the aristocracy, the monks, the 
church leaders and all of the collectors of tithes and tribute. 
The tragedy is that the plague does not spare our kind of people 
who also die in entire regions." 
  The historian Edgar Dunsdorfs estimates that half of the 
population of Latvia perished at this time. The greatest losses 
were suffered by the Kurzeme and Vidzeme regions with lesser 
losses to the inhabitants of Latgale. 
  Later, in the 18th century, the people of Latvia also lived 
under conditions similarly stressful to the 16th and 17th, but 
at this time they had large families with as many as ten or more 
children. As a result, after the years of ruin Latvia 
experienced an explosive growth in population. For example, at 
the beginning of the 18th century Latvia's population was about 
465,000 but at the end of the century it had already reached 
873,000. Therefor, the population nearly doubled during the 
following 90 years. Information about the ethnic composition of 
the population is shown in Table 1.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 


  E. Dunsdorfs indicates that this figure (873 thousand) does 
not include the Russian army and that the number of Latvians 
includes only those in the territory of Latvia. 
  Table 1 shows that the Latvian comprise a high percentage of 
the total population -- 89.8 percent. This means that the 
immigration from neighboring countries was negligible and that 
the rapid increase of the population resulted from the high 
birth rate and natural population growth. 
  Naturally, 18th century Latvians did not have demographers 
or 
other specialists, who were concerned with and encouraged the 
renewal of the living force of the nation. It is also unlikely 
that at that time that heightened national consciousness would 
have motivated larger families to leave less room for foreigners 
to settle in the homeland of the Latvian people. 
  In our era, when it is known that families with only one 
child, or none, dominate, and that the once strong and healthy 
Latvian nation is dying out in its own country, during a time of 
peace (see Table 3) it is useful to reflect on and learn from 
the objective conditions that stimulated the higher birthrate. 
  First, families and high birthrates received moral support, 
because the manor lords were interested that they had a pool of 
familiar, Latvian workers instead of having to hire unknown 
strangers. For example, the court of the Duke of Kurland issued 
regulations that peasants are to be encouraged to marry and that 
these marriages are to be facilitated in every way possible. 
This regulation also says that mothers of children born out of 
wedlock are to be punished only lightly and that they cannot be 
shamed with punishment meted out by the church. It is also, 
however, stated that older wives of farmers and servants are to 
watch over young girls. Historical data shows that some manors 
ordered bachelors to find brides even in other regions. The 
Russian government of the 18th century showed little interest in 
the inhabitants of Latvia, however, they did issue a decree, 
that the inhabitants cannot be restrained from marriage. 
  Second, at that time families were also supported by 
economic 
means. The historical record shows that manor lords in Vidzeme 
paid premiums to the newly married and their children. Also the 
manors permitted proper families with children to purchase their 
own homes, but gave the most difficult and unpleasant jobs to 
the unwed without children. The difficult conditions of the time 
also motivated the peasants to have more children, because large 
families made it easier to complete the work demanded by the 
manor as well as the tasks for one's own farmstead. 
  Third, we can mention another significant factor 
contributing 
to the high birthrate which is that at that time modern methods 
of birth control were unknown. It is noteworthy that at this 
time that the registered number of abortions significantly 
exceeds the number of live births. As an example, in 1990 there 
were 37,900 births and 45,100 abortions. This condition persists 
to this day. At the same time, we are first in the world with 
our divorce rate, because nearly every other marriage ends up in 
divorce. 
  The next destructive shock that Latvians experienced was the 
first World War. The War, the fleeing of refugees and the fight 
for independence resulted in a loss of more than 700,000 
inhabitants. The psyche of the people, however, was not 
traumatized. By 1935, when the Latvian government began to be 
concerned with the demographic state of the country, Latvia's 
birthrate began to recover. In the inter war period one could 
encounter not a small number of large families (ref. to the 
picture of President Cakste's large family [photo not 
reproduced]) -- among farmers, workers and intellectuals. 
  It must also be noted that at this time that there were few 
abortions and divorces. For example, in 1937 statistics show 
1,300 divorces and 4,100 registered abortions or about one tenth 
the current number of abortions and one eighth the number of 
abortions. 
  Following 20 years of peaceful development terrible 
destruction was wreaked by World War II when Latvia lost more 
than half a million inhabitants. As a result of both world wars 
Latvia lost more than 1.2 million inhabitants as a direct result 
of the wars, through migration of refugees, losses in the fight 
for independence, and deportations. No European smaller country 
has experienced a comparable loss. This left a negative impact 
on the psyche of the nation, but still did not destroy the will 
of the country and following the war the birthrate grew at a 
satisfactory rate which is evidenced by Table 2.

|Inhabitants                                                                |

----------------------------------------------------------------------------- 


  Table 2 shows that births and natural population growth fell 
rapidly in the Postwar period, and that starting in 1991, until 
the current moment, growth has been negative, that is more 
inhabitants are dying than are being born. 
  Latvia's native people are in a particularly critical 
situation, because beginning with 1991 they are on the gloomy 
path of national extinction (see Table 3).

------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 


  Statistical information also shows, that during the past 45 
years that the number of immigrants has exceeded the number of 
emigrants by 470,000. Since the immigrants tend to be younger 
people, then in Riga's public schools in 1992/3 there were 
63,800 students studying in Russian and only 30,900 studying in 
Latvian. In this same period (in the beginning of 1993) there 
were 138 pre-schools for Russian speakers and 60 for Latvian 
speakers. 
  According to information of the State Statistical Committee 
(Table 4), Latvians are an ethnic minority in the largest cities 
of Latvia.

  In this Year of the Family, the association For Country and 
Freedom, the Latvian Militia (strelnieku) Association, the 
Christian Democratic Union, the Latvian Association, and the 
citizens group "Our Land" have agreed, without hesitation, to 
take a stand against the extinction of the Latvian people. To 
halt this process the Latvian People's Self-help Foundation is 
being established to stimulate broad and far reaching measures 
throughout the territory of Latvia. This is a not-for-profit, 
public welfare foundation whose mission is fight for the ethnic 
survival of the Latvian people. First, the Foundation, based on 
experience from prior years, is to provide moral support to 
families and to encourage young people to marry and to establish 
stable families. It is proposed to involve existing social 
welfare and women's organizations, medical workers, and other 
social organizations and representatives of the intelligencia, 
especially of pensioners. It is also proposed to invite 
established religious organizations to participate in this 
important undertaking. The Foundation is expecting to wage an 
unwavering battle against alcoholism, smoking, drug addiction 
and other immoral behavior. 
  Secondly, families, particularly those with more children, 
need material support. In Western countries, as we know, this is 
seen as a social norm. We can only hope that this will also 
happen in our country. The Foundation is also expected to 
provide support to those who are experiencing economic 
difficulties. It is expected that the Foundation will seek 
donations of money, clothes, shoes, and food. 
  Thirdly, artificial birth control, primarily abortions, are 
a 
complex and difficult to solve problems under present 
circumstances, but we expect to work in this direction as well. 
I must mention that in 1991, when the Council of Ministers was 
still in power, that I submitted a proposal to at least 
establish a price limit for abortion operations, to which I 
received only a form letter as a response. 
  During my lectures at the Latvian World Science Congress I 
touched on the abortion problem. Foreign scientists were 
surprised at the large number of abortions. After my lecture we 
discussed this problem with a consensus that without government 
support it will be very difficult to achieve visible results. 
  The Latvian People's Self-help Foundation's primary mission 
is to wage an energetic fight, using all legitimate means, to 
increase the natural growth rate of the population, and to 
provide the family, as the primary institution of society, with 
material support. I invite other social and political 
organizations, as well as individuals, to participate in the 
formation of the Latvian People's Self-help Foundation.

<F P=106> [Article by Olafs Zvejnieks and Maris Kirsons: "Finance </F>
Ministry Anticipates Instituting Cost Cutting Measures"] 
  [Text] The Finance Ministry is anticipating a cost-cutting 
regime since government expenditures exceeded receipts by 8 
million Ls already in January, 1994. 
  Janis Platais, Finance Ministry Secretary for the Budget, 
announced in a press conference that the government will be 
unable to finance investment projects in the winter period which 
will be delayed to a later period. Similarly, steps are being 
taken to limit specific expenditures by government agencies. 
These include the acquisition of equipment and major repairs, if 
there is no extraordinary need at this time. The Budget 
Secretary also indicated that social welfare payments to 
families with children are also under review with the 
expectation that such payments will in the future be limited to 
deprived classes only. 
<H5>  Financial Stability for Local Government </H5>
  J. Platais indicated that the Budget is very tight due to 
the 
social needs and necessary financing required of government 
organizations. The Budget authorizes receipts of 556.7 Ls and 
expenditures of 593.4 million Ls. Each month the Budget must 
receive 46.4 million Ls. The Government views that the work 
payment system will have to be reformed for the so-called force 
structures: police, army, militia and security forces. The 
Government is also reviewing, jointly with the trade unions, the 
potential to increase the minimum wage to 25 or perhaps 28 Ls 
per month. Also under review is the possibility of enabling 
savings made by government agencies against budget 
authorizations to be spent in the following year. 
  Uldis Osis, Finance Minister, announced that the Ministry is 
actively working on legislative proposals in the following 
areas: the Budget, the management of government finances, 
regulation of State and Local government relations to ensure 
necessary financial stability and oversight several years in the 
future. Already starting with this year macroeconomic forecast 
and clearly defined budgetary objectives were taken into account 
to develop the overall contours of the budget for the next 3-4 
years. Uldis Osis characterized this whole process as a "radical 
reform of the budgeting system." 
<H5>  Last Year's Deficit -- 2 Million Ls </H5>
  According to the Finance Ministry information provided by J. 
Platais, the actual budget deficit of about 2 million Ls was 
less than the forecast budget deficit of 30.2 million Ls. It 
will be possible to tell the precise State budget deficit by the 
end of February based upon more precise figures for receipts and 
disbursements. According to the operating information government 
receipts last year were approximately 410,354 Ls and 
disbursements were approximately 412.5 million Ls. 
<H5>  Social Welfare Taxes Were the Largest Category of Receipts </H5>
  The largest category of receipts in the previous year were 
from social welfare taxes -- about 144 million Lats, although 
less was received than earlier forecast. Income taxes also made 
a significant contribution to government receipts accounting for 
about 87 million Ls. The value-added tax was also a significant 
factor. Income tax receipts exceeded the forecast amount by 
11%. Although the budget deficit was reduced from the 
forecast 
level of 30.2 million Ls to about 2 million Ls by reducing 
expenditures from the plan, but also by less internal government 
borrowing and by repayment of loans, and also by the formation 
of the Department of Revenue which has helped to increase tax 
and fee receipts.

<F P=106> [Article under the rubric "Crimes and Punishments" by Juozas </F>
Aras: "Narcobusiness Spreading in a Menacing Fashion"] 
  [Text] A few years ago, I had occasion to drive with 
officials of what was then the militia to "apprehend" a little 
old lady, who, with poppy capsules clutched to her bosom, was 
waiting near the Virsuliskes shopping center for "some man in a 
black overcoat" to show up. After she was taken to the militia 
station, the old woman moaned: "Let me go, I knew Snieckus 
himself: I was in the underground with him..." 
  Later I got to drive through the streets of nighttime 
Vilnius 
in an ambulance transporting a young man crazed by narcotics to 
the hospital, who kept yelling the whole time: "My head! Give me 
back my head!"... 
  It is difficult to say, even using the terminology of that 
other time, to what extent these events represented a "mass 
phenomenon" or, on the other hand, "isolated instances." When 
the staffers of the current Interior Ministry counternarcotics 
section visited their colleagues in Denmark, the Danes noted 
almost in jest: "You don't see the problems until you begin 
working at this." 
  Statistics show that the Danes are correct. 1990 was the 
year 
in which the fewest narcotics-related crimes were committed--in 
that year, a reorganization of the Interior Ministry system was 
taking place, and the police were pulled away from their actual 
duties to meetings and other events. In the following year, a 
special counternarcotics group was established in the criminal 
police, and individual agencies and customhouses began to work 
more consistently. And in 1993, 302 narcotics-related crimes 
were recorded, which represented a 26 percent increase over 
1992. This number, however, is not the limit: to get a true 
picture, we would have to multiply it by 10. 
  The charted curve of these crimes is increasing not only in 
length, but also in breadth, and the geographical area they 
affect is expanding as well. Every third crime recorded in 
Lithuania is committed in Vilnius. However, crimes are committed 
in the other large cities as well--Kaunas, Klaipeda, Panevezys, 
Siauliai, Visaginas, and Druskininkai. Of late, some new trends 
are becoming apparent: narcotics-related crimes are also moving 
into rural districts such as Anyksciai, Kupiskis, Pasvalys. 
Border districts are not spared either. 
  Every tenth organized crime group is involved in 
narcobusiness, and quite a few group members, even some of their 
leaders, "are on the needle." A certain category of criminal is 
starting to appear: the narcotics transport courier. Despite all 
this, narcobusiness can still not claim the same degree of 
organization as prostitution, which has existed here under all 
governments. According to one Interior Ministry official, who 
wished to remain anonymous, narcobusiness is still a new 
phenomenon in Lithuania. A couple of years ago we were afraid 
that we might become the bridge for narcotics between the West 
and the East. It looks like this has not occurred, but the 
situation is changing in menacing fashion. 
  The route through the Balkans is already uncomfortable--the 
war going on there creates supplementary worries for the 
narcotics transporters. This is why it is thought that the new 
route might go through the Baltic countries. The aforementioned 
official characterized the situation in this way: there are no 
concrete facts, but there have already been some signals. For 
the time being, events are concentrated along the border with 
Latvia, Kaliningrad, and Belarus. Narcotics transit Lithuania 
on the "Moscow-Kaliningrad" train. Lithuanian poppies, the 
primary narcotic, are transported not only to Latvia, Estonia, 
Saint Petersburg, and Moscow, but have also already reached 
Sweden. The largest quantity of narcotics encountered last year 
by our criminalists consisted of bags containing 60 kilograms of 
poppy capsules. We are now talking in terms of tens of 
kilograms, even though one kilogram of narcotics is already 
considered to be a large quantity. Cases involving quantities of 
up to 10 grams of narcotics are subject to the provisions of the 
administrative code, with quantities in excess of 10 grams 
falling under the criminal code. 
  A new narcotic appeared in circulation recently, when traces 
were found in one addict's syringe. And incidentally, statistics 
tell us a few things about the addicts themselves. 42 percent 
are 30-49 years of age, 30 percent are 25-29, and 25 percent are 
18-24. 72 percent of addicts do not work anywhere. Keeping in 
mind that this is an expensive amusement, the majority of 
addicts encounters serious difficulties, because a jar of poppy 
capsules costs 25 litas at the market, and the total outlay 
approaches 50 litas when the cost of acquiring the most 
essential supplemental chemicals is included. And that is just 
for one day. So the knowledge of life indicates that narcotics 
are the cause of many a crime (thefts, robberies, even murders), 
and there are now few days without them. 
  To tell the truth, it would be quite strange if the 
situation 
were any different, because one could say that the laws tolerate 
everything: from growing narcotic substances to using them. 
Article 107.2 of the "Administrative Code" provides for a 
penalty of from 50 cents to 1 litas for the planting and growing 
of narcotic substances, and article 44 provides for a penalty of 
up to 1 litas or correctional labor--which is not used by anyone 
as a punishment--for illegal acquisition and possession of small 
quantities of narcotics, or their use. So maybe one politician 
of the not so distant past was correct when he said that only an 
utter fool cannot earn money in these times. 
  Although the time for sowing of poppies and hemp is still 
far 
off, advance contracts are possibly already being made with farm 
inhabitants: I'll give you 8,000 litas now, and you will give me 
a field of 10 ares planted with poppies later. Such fields 
cannot be seen in the summer even when you drive by, because 
they are either hidden by bushes or by grain planted along the 
edges of the plot. There are fields of poppies which are 
specifically guarded. This is not new, but rather an element of 
a classic structure. Unfortunately, the police are powerless, 
because they are not authorized to write up an administrative 
report. Only agricultural workers can do that, but of course 
thus far not a single one of them has done so. 
  We do not believe that such laws are being drawn up 
maliciously. The men in the government lack foresight. People 
are simply living for the day. In this case, however, society's 
view is not correct either. Poppies are certainly more dangerous 
than, let us say, marijuana, because opium-based narcotics are 
used intravenously--and this is a real way in which AIDS is 
spread. 
  For many, poppies are just blossoms. What are we going to do 
when the fruit suddenly appears as well?

<F P=106> [Article by Jukka Knuuti, Ministry of Defense special </F>
advisor: "Is a Russian Attack Possible?"] 
  [Text] The Swede writing under the pseudonym Harry Winter 
has written a scenario on how Russia will occupy the Baltic 
countries" 
  Vladimir Zhirinovskiy's victory in the Russian parliamentary 
elections were greeted in the Baltic newspapers with headlines 
including: "What Was Feared Has Happened." A party with 
significant strength that demands the return of the Baltic area 
to the "empire" is not really desired in the Baltic countries. 
  In Estonia, Latvia, and Lithuania people know all too well 
that among leading circles in Russia there are those for whom it 
is difficult to approve of the independence of the three 
republics. After all, they were a part of Russia since the Great 
Northern War at the beginning of the 1700's with the exception 
of a short period of independence between the World Wars. 
  Indignation and concern were aroused last summer by the 
staff 
exercise carried out by the Russian Northwest Group of Forces, 
the former Baltic Military District, having the theme of a 
renewed occupation of Estonia, Latvia, and Lithuania. This 
provocative exercise is a subplot like the repeatedly alleged 
submarine violations of Swedish territorial waters, in the new 
Swedish book by Harry Winter, Operation Narva, which 
portrays an attempt to seize the Baltic countries back for 
Russia. 
  The secret project is organized behind the back of the 
political leadership by the KGB of the former Soviet Union, now 
the Security Ministry (which Yeltsin ordered reorganized last 
Christmas) and its foreign intelligence wing, which is 
subordinated directly to the president (and whose head, Yevgeniy 
Primakov, warned in November that any decision by NATO to accept 
the countries of East Europe as members would lead to 
countermeasures by Moscow) and the military intelligence 
organization GRU. 
  In the book the provocation bringing Russian armed forces 
back into the Baltic countries is planned through having KGB 
agents disguised as local ultrapatriotic groups undertake 
terrorism against the Russian minority living in those 
countries, which would give the Russian armed forces a reason to 
go to the aid of their countrymen. 
  The Swedes are tied in through the fact that the KGB 
organized a wave of robberies of the weapons depots of the 
Swedish defense forces and the evidence was supposed to point to 
the oppressors of the Russian minority in Estonia and Latvia. 
The weapon thefts were successful, but the conspiracy in the 
Baltic countries failed, and the former KGB and GRU plotters 
were imprisoned. 
<H5>  A Prophecy? </H5>
  Has Winter written a prophecy, the basis for which is found 
not only in Zhirinovskiy's election victory but also in the new 
Russian military doctrine that was approved at the beginning of 
last November? In it the infringement of the legitimate 
interests of citizens of the Russian Federation in other 
countries is regarded as a military danger. At the same time it 
considers it possible to maintain troops outside its borders if 
the interests of the Russian Federation so demand. Harry 
Winter's tale is not necessarily credible, but it is interesting 
in combining a lot of facts with the fiction. 
  The pseudonym Harry Winter, under which the book was 
written, 
is well known in Sweden. The three-part novel Operation 
Garbo telling about an attack on Sweden contemplated by the 
Soviet Union was published in the years 1988-91. The book became 
a best-seller because the person behind the pseudonym was known 
to be very knowledgeable about what was said in the book. Harry 
Winter was said to be a joint pseudonym for retired Colonel Bo 
Hugemark, the journalist Lars Richardson (now an aide to Prime 
Minister Carl Bildt), and a researcher who is now working in the 
Swedish Foreign Ministry, Ingemar Doerfer. Operation 
Narva, however, is primarily Hugemark's handiwork. 
  The popularity of Operation Garbo was increased by 
the fact that the books are to a certain extent romans a clef. 
Several of their characters were modeled more or less in the 
image of actual persons operating in Swedish domestic politics.

<F P=106> [INTERFAX item: "Ukraine's Debts to the CIS Have Exceeded </F>
Three Billion Dollars"] 
  [Text] The general volume of Ukraine's state foreign debt 
to the CIS countries as of March 1994 amounted to 3.426 billion 
dollars [$]. (Including $2.703 billion to Russia, $693 million 
to Turkmeniya, $28 million to Moldavia [Moldova] and $1.3 
million to Kazakhstan.) Aleksey Berezhnoy, chief of the 
department of foreign debt for the Ukrainian Finance Ministry's 
currency-economic administration, reported this. 
  He noted that in 1994, according to an intergovernmental 
agreement, they plan to pay nearly $1.5 billion (including $421 
million to countries of the far abroad, $668 million to Russia 
and $359 million to Turkmeniya) although at the present time 
Ukraine does not have available the hard currency funds in the 
amount which would allow it to service its foreign creditors. 
  Mr. Berezhnoy remarked that this year payment of the debt to 
Russia included the basic debt and interest in accordance with 
an intergovernmental agreement. As regards the debt to 
Turkmeniya, it is a result of the unbalanced import of energy 
sources for Ukraine's enterprises and agriculture. 
  It is expected that by the end of the year the centralized 
hard currency funds, the amount of which today does not exceed 
$1 billion, will increase to $1.3 billion due to profits from 
exports according to state contracts. According to forecasts of 
Ukraine's Ministry of Economics, the general profit from exports 
will amount to $20 billion by the end of the year. However, the 
same amount of expenditures on critical imports is planned (in 
1993 Ukraine was able to ensure receipt of only 20 percent of 
the predicted profits from exports). In the opinion of experts 
from Ukraine's Ministry of Economics, the debt problem can only 
be solved after the resumption of trading in freely convertible 
currency in Ukraine's interbank currency market and the 
liberalization of foreign economic activity. 
  According to Mr. Berezhnoy's information, the republic 
government is currently reviewing a draft Ukrainian-Latvian 
agreement which is also supposed to determine the amount of 
Ukrainain debt to Latvia for 1993.

<F P=106> [Article by V. Todoseychuk: "The New Party Is Centrist"] </F>
  [Text] A press conference of representatives of the leading 
organs of the Democratic Party of Independence of Azerbaijan 
(DPNA) has been held. 
  The DPNA is the 40th political party in Azerbaijan. The 
statute and program of the party were approved earlier, at the 
constituent conference on 26 March, and the Politburo and Ali 
Mejlis (Supreme Assembly) were elected. Gabil Guseynli, Vagif 
Kerimov, and Mubariz Gurbanly are cochairmen of the party. 
  The party ranks number about 10,000; chapters have been 
opened in 61 regions of the republic. 
  During the press conference, representatives of the DPNA 
answered numerous questions put by journalists. In particular, 
it was stated that the party occupies a centrist position and 
advocates holding parliamentary elections, which are a guarantee 
of successful democratic transformations, as soon as possible. 
The views of the DPNA are largely similar to the policy of the 
current leadership of the republic. 
  The main objective of the DPNA is to achieve Azerbaijan's 
real independence. The party proceeds in its operations from the 
principles of its popular character, justice, and democracy. The 
DPNA comes out against the interference of the army in politics; 
it advocates implementation of the positive principles of 
Turkism, Islamism, and national-patriotism. 
  As far as the economic sphere is concerned, a team of 
experts 
is at work within the DPNA. A privatization program has already 
been developed; it has been submitted to the leadership of the 
republic.

<F P=106> [Article by Ernst Isaakovich Chernyy, expert at the </F>
Association of Independent Professionals, chairman of the Union 
of Independent Fishing Industry Representatives, candidate in 
geographical sciences: "Does the Coat of Statehood Fit the 
Regions? On the Danger of Separatism in the Economy"] 
  [Text] The simplest way to confuse any question is to 
introduce the principle of joint responsibility and joint 
administration. If several structures are concurrently 
answerable for the realization of some function, we may say with 
full assurance that confusion and muddle are guaranteed, and 
that in the "gaps" between the joint administration there will 
always be a place for abusers, for corruption and bribery. 
Considering the fact that certain regional administrators assume 
functions which are characteristic only of the state, the danger 
of emergence of a new separatism is quite real, and Article 72 
of the Constitution will present us with many more 
surprises. 
  The decline of the local soviets was characterized by a 
sharp 
increase in their politization and a striving toward so-called 
"sovereignty" to the detriment of their obvious tasks: The 
creation of conditions for normal life of their electors--the 
taxpayers. 
  Many regional administrators even today believe that their 
sovereignty consists of "lowering" state functions to the level 
of the region, which after this appears to them as a reduced 
copy of the state. Then the policy of the region may, in their 
opinion, differ from the policy of the state, and especially the 
economic policy. This constitutes the primary error in some 
cases, and the fine calculation and intent in others. We will 
note that if there is an economic policy of the regions which 
differs from such policy of the state, then, in the normal 
understanding, the state simply does not exist. 
  Regional administrations want first of all to permit and 
distribute, rather than to develop the rules of such 
distribution which are known and understandable to all, and 
under which the subjective decisions of bureaucrats will no 
longer be needed. 
  Kamchatka Governor Biryukov, for example, believes that the 
oblast has not only its own economic policy, but also its own 
foreign economic policy. Attempting to hinder one of the 
enterprises in his oblast in obtaining permission for foreign 
economic activity, the governor writes to the minister of 
foreign economic relations: "The oblast administration 
categorically objects to the request by AO UTRF (the name of the 
enterprise), which runs counter to the foreign economic policy 
of the oblast." Can such a thing be? After all, foreign economic 
policy is an attribute only of state power, and it is reduced 
ultimately to developing principles of foreign economic 
interaction with various countries (preferential, common, 
discriminatory), concluding interstate treaties and agreements, 
and establishing a system of export-import tariffs and duties. 
  Can the regions themselves develop such principles? 
Obviously 
not. Otherwise, that which is prohibited in one region will be 
done through another, and the unified economic space specified 
in the constitution will simply disappear. 
  It is easy to note that the interests of individual regions 
may contradict each other. Here is the simplest example: A 
region which produces bread is interested in its export, while 
bread consuming regions are interested in having the bread 
remain in the country. Foreign economic policy is not the 
mechanical sum of the foreign economic interests of the regions 
and may exist only as an all-state policy, but one which takes 
into consideration the management-economic structure of the 
regions. Therefore, Mr. Biryukov's aspirations to his own 
specific oblast foreign economic policy are, in the very least, 
untenable. 
  They are untenable and contradict the constitution, as well 
as the wishes of the participants of the Khabarovsk Kray 
administration collegium to prohibit the export of food and 
other goods from its territory. Moreover, the law on enterprises 
and entrepreneurial activity is contradicted by the desire of 
the deputy head of administration of Primorskiy Kray to set 
quotas on fishing primarily for those enterprises which "bring 
more benefit" to the kray. And, after all, he, Novikov, as the 
former secretary of the CPSU raykom [rayon committee], knows 
better than others what is best for the kray. 
  Having assumed all-state functions, the regions often make 
decisions which are fraught with grave consequences for several 
generations of their citizens. The reason for this is political 
infantilism and, evidently, serious personal interest. 
  Here is a rather telling example. The governor of Sakhalin 
Oblast, Ye. Krasnoyarov, in his decree No. 284 dated 5 November 
1993, granted the inter-regional joint-stock bank for economic 
cooperation (MABES) "Sakhalin-West", which had sprung up 
unexpectedly, was not known to anyone and not backed by its own 
assets, the status of a bank serving as an agent of the oblast 
administration for (and I quote) "organizing and coordinating 
work associated with the implementation of financing projects 
and programs for the socioeconomic development and 
reconstruction of Sakhalin and the Kurils." In section 3 of the 
decree, Ye. Krasnoyarov generously allocates the bank R100 
million from the oblast budget (let us be frank--Sakhalin 
taxpayers' money) as the initial contribution to the MABES. 
  As an aside, we will note that the firm which Krasnoyarov 
managed before he became governor, "Pilenga-Godo," was one of 
the founders of this bank. Thus, the generosity by oblast 
Governor Ye. Krasnoyarov was of benefit to one of the bank's 
founders--the entrepreneur Ye. Krasnoyarov. It is an interesting 
story in economic independence. But that is not all. One of the 
subsections of section 7 of the decree is addressed to the 
government with a request to allocate preferential credit to the 
bank in the sum of R5 billion for a term of 5 years at a rate of 
20 percent per annum. Have you noted any state interests here? 
Or what about Sakhalin interests? Well, are Gaydar and Fedorov 
not correct when they say that those who are "gratified" by the 
public wealth will drag away the entire budget to preferential 
credits for themselves and their good friends? If someone has 
remembered about inflation now, it would not be bad to 
understand that this is one of its visible components. And there 
are many such smart governors in Russia. Let us proceed ferther, 
since the crowning touch is section 5 of the above-mentioned 
decree. It should be quoted in its entirety, since the "intent" 
of the neophyte of politics and economics has become clear to 
everyone: "5. To allocate to the MABES `Sakhalin-West' as a 
guaranteed security for obtaining foreign currency credit along 
the bank's existing credit line the export goods and raw 
material resources (fish and marine products, timber, oil, 
metals, etc.) which are at the disposal of the oblast 
administration's territorial fund, as well as undeveloped 
mineral deposits (oil, coal, zeolite, facing stone, etc.), uncut 
forest areas and other raw material resources in the oblast in 
accordance with the established procedure." Section 6, which 
provides for the annual allocation of R1 billion and $2.5 
million to the bank from the oblast budget, appears as an 
innocent prank next to this. 
  Up until now, I believed that banks, "trading" in money, 
must 
themselves create their own assets and then give credit to 
interested parties at the appropriate interest rates. After 
Krasnoyarov's decree, I began to doubt this. We may hope that 
the underlying meaning of the governor's decree is 
understandable even to those who are not experienced in politics 
and economics. If a bank, having received many millions in 
foreign credit, "suddenly" finds itself insolvent, then 
everything that is listed in the above-mentioned section 5 will 
become the property of the foreign creditor or will demand 
immediate repayment of the credit from the state budget, i.e., 
at our, the taxpayers', expense. 
  Are there any other questions about Ye. Krasnoyarov? Perhaps 
only for the president's administration. After all, their 
appointments are too "exact." Ye. Krasnoyarov is by no means the 
only one. And so the doubt arises: Will such governors not drag 
the country away piece by piece? Is this not where the most 
refined separatism is formulated, which is indulged by certain 
federal departments, pursuing their own not quite unselfish 
interests? 
  In connection with the tendency to assume someone else's 
functions, we will try to understand what the economic 
sovereignty of regions ultimately consists of. 
  The fact is that we have always lived in a system where, due 
to the actual confiscation of the surplus product and taxes, all 
the funds collected by this method went into the highest level 
budget, and were then distributed by regions on the basis of 
"plan" guidelines. 
  It is necessary to re-create the principle under which each 
region will supply itself with all that is necessary (by 
producing or buying). After all, living in a country, republic 
or oblast, we are in fact living in an entirely specific region. 
It is only here that we need a home, municipal services, roads 
and schools. What good are statements to the effect that we have 
free education if there is no school in a specific village? Can 
Bratsk develop normally if out of the R100 billion in taxes 
collected here it gets only R20 billion? Improvements are 
possible if the very concept of taxes includes the principle of 
their divergence, or payments made by the lower budgets to the 
higher ones. 
  Under such a tax structure, the regions on whose territory 
billions of rubles worth of products are produced will cease to 
be constant humble supplicants. It is obvious that only the rich 
regions are able to support central administrative organs, an 
army and other structures. At the same time, the state expenses 
themselves must be significantly reduced. 
  It seems, however, that the economic sovereignty of regions 
consists only of the right to collect taxes and use them for the 
benefit of the citizens living on their territory. This is 
really a basic necessity, because it is imprudent to collect 
taxes in the regions, to "take" them to Moscow, and then to 
distribute them throughout the regions as budget allocations or 
subsidies. Other economic functions belong either to the state, 
or to the enterprises. The task of the local administrations, 
then, is not to "drag and prohibit," but to create such 
conditions under which the effect from the activity of 
enterprises and citizen taxpayers would be maximal. There is no 
need, and it is simply dangerous, to equate state regalia to the 
uniform of the region. 
  Moscow Mayor Luzhkov once said about himself: I am an 
economic manager! These are the right words. Especially now, 
when most of the managers of the regions are former directors 
who think that the state is simply a large factory or kolkhoz 
[collective farm]. The Gaydars and Fedorovs know what buttons to 
push in order to get the necessary result thousands of 
kilometers away from the "control panel." This is economics. We, 
the "wise" voters, have with our votes helped to remove market 
economists from management of the economy. If we are now 
controlled by the Biryukovs and the Krasnoyarovs, we have no one 
to blame but ourselves.

<F P=106> [Article by journalist Sergey Zhdakayev: "Mine Strikes </F>
Advantageous...to the Government?"] 
  [Text] 
<H5>  We Want To Work, but Not for Free </H5>
  Tula--Eighty shaftmen from the Beltsevskaya mine refused to 
come to the surface. As a sign of protest against detention of 
pay. 
  "This is not a strike," stated trade union leader Sofya 
Sirotina in clarifying the position of the miners. "It is an act 
of protest. We want to work, but not for free. They have not 
paid us since December." 
  Contrary to directives, but in accordance with her trade 
union duties, Sofya Vasilyevna descended to the mine drift with 
the workers and sat five days underground while the management 
tried to find money. 
  "If today they find the money for Beltsevskaya," stated 
Leonid Zavodchikov, general director of the Tulaugol 
association, in predicting the possible development of events, 
"tomorrow the entire basin will 'stand down.' The budget owes us 
38 billion, but the government is not even thinking about 
settling with us." 
  Leonid Vasilyevich's prediction partially came true. When 
the 
December-January pay made its way from the bank to Beltsevskaya, 
the Zapadnaya mine went on strike. Mostovskaya and Progress 
joined in the next day. 
  Responding to the question of what demands were being made 
by 
the miners, V. Terekhov, chairman of the trade union of 
Zapadnaya mine, stated that the demands were not yet formulated 
and a strike committee had not even been organized. The strike 
took place spontaneously. The main demand was wages. But 
rejoinders are already resounding on early presidential 
elections and resignation of the government. 
<H5>  Existence Determines Consciousness </H5>
  In the opinion of L. Popov, chairman of the territorial 
committee of the trade union of Tulaugol association coal 
miners, the degree of readiness for a strike is determined by 
many factors, and the issue of wages does not always play the 
decisive role among them. 
  Vorkuta mine workers can obtain food products only from the 
store. But in the Moscow area, the miners have garden plots, and 
so obtain potatoes, vegetables, often pork. This substantially 
alters views on conducting strikes. "Some are prepared to strike 
today," L. Popov states. "About 30 percent are in this category. 
Others promise: 'We will support you.' Then there are those who 
say: 'We have not yet determined our position.' And still others 
see no sense in any of this. At least now there is something to 
demand. But when we just strike the time away, there is nothing 
to get out of it. The Lipkovskaya mine, for example, has 
consistently avoided strikes all these years." 
  Even within the framework of one collective there is 
divergence of opinion. One example from the plans division of 
the Zapadnaya mine: Underground equipment operator D. Shreyder 
writes up a petition every time--"I request that the 
administration guarantee me work, since I do not wish to 
strike." It turns out that one of Shreyder's division coworkers 
sympathizes with him. Another, on the contrary, supports the 
strikers, believing that necessity has pushed them to this point. 
<H5>  A Tool for Burying Money </H5>
  L. Zavodchikov attests that there are mines in the Tulaugol 
combine that are subsidized to the extent of 98-100 percent by 
the state, i.e., they operate for themselves alone. Hundreds of 
people go underground, hack their way through the seam, ingest 
the dust, and move coal to the surface which then undergoes 
combustion to heat up their own mine shafts. An ideal tool for 
burying the taxpayer's money. 
  Nor are the ordinary mines, those that are "average" 
according to indices, enriching the country. At Zapadnaya, for 
example, 1,246 people are supposed to extract (according to the 
plan) 786 tonnes per day, but they actually extract 270 tonnes. 
In this regard, the production cost of a tonne of coal is around 
40,000 rubles [R], while the selling price is R9,000. For the 
combine in general, over 80 percent of the coal production is 
subsidized by the state. "In fact, we are budget workers," L. 
Zavodchikov admits. 
  In other words, the coal sector is the operator's 
locomotive, 
which collides by inertia with the financial stability of the 
state. In this manner, assertions that mine workers "make their 
living at the expense of the old people" are doubly justified. 
And this is where one sees dramatic theater in the coal 
industry. It is just that in one instance the old people are 
real, and in another--abstract. 
  Paradoxical as it may seem, today strikes conducted by the 
miners are advantageous to the government. The less the miners 
work, the less is the detriment to the budget. And judging from 
all appearances, the government is aware of this. 
<H5>  There Will Be No Easy Decisions </H5>
  The ineffectiveness of strikes will hardly force miners to 
abandon fighting for their rights. "The mood is very bad," 
asserts V. Terekhov, chairman of the trade union of Zapadnaya 
mine workers. "People are prepared to resort to the most extreme 
forms of opposition." 
  And so, the respite the government has received will hardly 
be long. And its choices are not great. 
  The best alternative would be to part from the miners in 
civilized fashion, i.e., close down mines that are especially 
unprofitable, pay compensation, retrain the people, and create 
new job positions. It is this path that is envisaged by the 
state program for readjustment of the coal industry developed by 
the government. 
  This path has only one shortcoming--it is too expensive. 
According to Popov's assessments, shutting down even a small 
mine would require R36 billion. And when you take into account 
the fact that this applies to over half the mines in the 
Tulaugol combine, it then becomes "more advantageous for the 
state not to shut them down, but just let them quietly keep 
operating." 
  Unfortunately, this "inexpensive alternative" also has its 
defects. First of all, it does not solve the problem--it 
postpones resolution. Secondly, it is not really that 
inexpensive. For normal operation of the sector, L. Popov 
believes, you need R11.6 trillion. But the new budget has put up 
R5.6 trillion. 
  The difference between these figures constitutes the main 
topic of dispute today between government leaders, on the one 
hand, and the sector lobbies and trade unions, on the other. 
  In the event the sector lobby is victorious, the black hole 
in the economy into which trillions are being poured will be 
preserved. But if the budget prevails, mines will start being 
shut down. With all the consequences this entails. There is no 
painless resolution here, but there is a choice between 
reassuring and hopeless prospects.

<F P=106> [Volgograd Oblast Statistical Administration report: "The </F>
Oblast Economy in 1993"] 
  [Text] 
<H5>  Finances </H5>
  According to figures from the oblast financial 
administration, in 1993 the consolidated oblast budget posted a 
surplus of R10 billion [rubles]. 
  According to the Central Bank Main Administration, credit 
investment in the oblast at the beginning of the year was R306 
billion and increased by a factor of four in comparison to 1992. 
The loans extended are being used primarily for current needs 
rather than investment purposes. The proportion of long-term 
loans in the overall volume of credit investment was just 9 
percent. 
  In the first 11 months of 1993 enterprises and organizations 
(not including agriculture) posted profits of R463 billion. 
Despite the significant increase in profits (by a factor of six 
as compared to the previous year), there was no real improvement 
in enterprises' financial or commercial operations due to 
persistent inflation. One enterprise in five in the oblast is 
operating at a loss. 
  The financial situation of enterprises and organizations is 
further complicated by the unsettled status of mutual payments. 
Mutual nonpayment has slowed the flow of goods and resulted in 
difficulties obtaining essential raw materials. At the start of 
December 1993 the unpaid debt of enterprises in the key sectors 
of industry, construction, transportation and agriculture to 
suppliers for goods and services was R222 billion, which is 4.2 
times more than the enterprises' available funds. Unpaid debts 
to those enterprises for products shipped by them totalled R290 
billion. 
  The payment crisis is preventing a solution to the problem 
of 
timely payment of wages and other payments. This problem is 
particularly acute in the agricultural sector. 
<H5>  Privatization </H5>
  Over the past year more than 600 enterprises in the oblast 
have been transferred either partially or entirely to private 
ownership; of these, 36 percent were in retail sales and food 
service, 31 percent in industry, 20 percent in customer 
services, and 11 percent in the construction industry. 
  At the start of 1994 a total of 24 vehicular enterprises had 
been privatized, as well as one rail transportation enterprise. 
  Privatization of enterprises in 1993 yielded revenues of 
approximately R4 billion in cash and more than 350,000 
privatization vouchers. 
  Since the start of privatization more than 217,000 
apartments 
have been privatized in the oblast, or one-third of all housing 
slated for privatization. A total of 119,000 apartments were 
privatized in 1993. 
  Agricultural reforms continued. In the past two years 486 
kolkhozes and sovkhozes have re-registered, and of these 375 
were reorganized. A total of 230 companies with limited 
liability, closed-type joint-stock companies and mixed companies 
have been created out of them, as well as 39 agricultural 
cooperatives, 12 farming subsidiaries belonging to industrial 
enterprises, three open-type joint-stock companies, 24 private 
farm associations and 4,214 independent private farms. 
  At the start of 1994 there were 10,614 private farms with a 
total of 886,600 hectares of land. 
<H5>  Price and Rate Indexes </H5>
  Over the past year retail prices and rates for goods and 
services sold to the public increased by an average factor of 11. 
  During the year food items increased in price by an average 
factor of 10. The largest price increases were for bread and 
dairy products (factor of 18), meat products (more than 10), 
eggs (eight) and sugar, pasta and cereals (four to five). 
  During the year prices at city markets increased by an 
average factor of nine, with prices for milk, eggs and 
vegetables rising by factors of 15-24 and prices for meat and 
butter increased by a factor of 10. 
  The cost of a consumer basket of the 19 most important food 
products was 8.7 times more in December 1993 than in December 
1992. 
  Among nonfood items, the greatest price increases for the 
year were for medicines and chemical products (by a factor of 
28), fuels sold to the public (22) and detergents (16). Prices 
for shoes, clothings, fabrics and electrical appliances all 
increased by factors of 7-10. 
  Paid services to the public increased in price by a factor 
of 
21 over the past year. 
  During the year consumer services rose in price by a factor 
of 13, including sewing and repair of sewn items (by a factor of 
22), beauty salon and photographic services (almost 20) and dry 
cleaning and refrigerator repair (14-15). 
  Wholesale prices for manufactured goods were on average 10 
times higher in December 1993 than in December 1992. 
<H5>  The Social Realm </H5>
  According to preliminary figures the oblast population at 
the 
beginning of 1994 was 2,670,000. 
  During 1993 the demographic situation in the oblast remained 
extremely negative. Natural population loss begin in late 1991 
when the mortality rate first exceeded the birth rate. This 
trend, growing markedly stronger, continued through 1993, which 
was even more negative in terms of natural population 
reproduction. There was a further significant decline in the 
birth rate and an increase in the mortality rate. 
  In 1993 a total of 26,000 people were born in the republic, 
and 37,000 died. In comparison with the previous year the number 
of births decreased by almost 3,000, or by 10 percent, while the 
number of deaths increased by 5,000, or by 15 percent. 
  The primary causes of death remained diseases of the 
circulatory system (58 percent of all deaths) and oncological 
illnesses (17 percent). In third place (13 percent) was death by 
unnatural causes. In comparison to 1992 this figure increased by 
25 percent, with accidental alcohol poisoning up by a factor of 
1.8 in 1993 in comparison to the previous year. The number of 
homicides increased by 20 percent during the period, and the 
number of suicides by 22 percent. 
  Natural population decline totalled more than 11,000 and was 
observed in the cities of Volgograd, Volzhskiy, Kamyshin, 
Mikhaylovka, Uryulinsk and Frolovo, as well as in 27 out of 33 
of the oblast's rayons. Only in Bykovskiy, Kamyshinskiy, 
Nikolayevskiy, Pallasovskiy and Staropoltavskiy rayons was there 
a slight natural population increase due to a higher birth rate. 
  Despite the natural population loss the oblast's population 
increased by almost 10,000 in 1993. This was due to a positive 
migration balance, in which the number of people arriving to 
take up permanent resident in the oblast exceeded the number of 
those leaving. 
  In recent years there has been a change in migration flows, 
resulting in a reduction of the outflow of population from rural 
areas observed in the late 1980's. Recently the size of the 
rural population has begun to increase due to migration from 
other regions and moves by the city's urban population. 
  The city of Volgograd's population continued to decline. At 
the start of 1994 the number of resident population, according 
to preliminary data, was approximately one million and declined 
during the previous year by almost 2,000, as migration-based 
growth was unable to compensate for natural population loss. 
<H8>  Employment </H8>
  As of 1 January 1994 a total of 1.2 million people were 
employed. Of these, 30 percent were employed by enterprises 
under private ownership. 
  According to figures from the Committee on Labor and 
Employment, a total of 25,400 people applied for job placement, 
and of that number 21,500 were not currently employed. Of those 
seeking work more than one-third were young people between the 
ages of 16 and 29. Over the past year the employment service 
placed 14,200 people, or 59 percent of applicants. 
  At the beginning of the current year the number of 
unemployed 
persons was 4,100, mainly women. Unemployment benefits were 
being paid to 3,100 unemployed persons. 
  On 1 January of the current year the number of job openings 
at enterprises was up by a factor of 1.3 over January 1993, with 
12 unemployed citizens for every 10 job openings. 
  During the January-December 1993 period 254,700 individuals 
left jobs at enterprises and organizations in the oblast, or 25 
percent of the average number of employees registered, and of 
this number 14,000 were laid off. For 1993 as a whole latent 
(concealed) unemployment was higher than officially reported 
unemployment. In 1993 a total of 128,000 people were sent on 
unpaid leave at management's initiative, and 41,300 people were 
forced to work part-time due to shortages of materials. 
<H8>  Income </H8>
  The public's income in 1993 totalled more than R1 trillion, 
which was 10 times more than in 1992. This yielded an oblast per 
capita monthly average of R32,000 last year. In December this 
figure was R65,000. 
  The average monthly income of one employee in 1993 was 
R53,000, with pay of R58,000 in industry, R49,000 in 
agriculture, R67,000 in transportation and R68,000 in 
construction. 
  In December of last year employees' average monthly income 
was R127,000. The income of persons employed in health care, 
education and culture remained at 25-30 percent below that level. 
<H8>  The Consumer Market in Goods and Services </H8>
  The volume of consumer goods production in actual 1993 
prices 
was R491 billion. 
  The drop in output relative to last year in comparable 
prices 
was 16 percent. 
  Over the past year cotton fabric production decreased by 29 
percent and footwear production by 41 percent due to 
insufficient supplies of raw materials (cotton fiber and 
leather). 
  Light industrial enterprises showed a decline in their 
output 
of knitted and sewn goods (suits, dresses, skirts, shirts and 
hats). The largest decline was in production of children's wear 
(by 24-53 percent). 
  Production of food products decreased by 13 percent in 
comparison to 1992. There was a drop of more than 15 percent in 
production of meat, butter, pasta and margarine. 
  The total 1993 sales volume for goods and services was R676 
billion, 9.2 times higher than the 1992 level (in actual 
prices). However, the unaffordability of ever more expensive 
consumer goods for many segments of the population reduced 
acquisition of those goods. Actual sales volume declined by 26 
percent. 
  Retail sales, including unregulated sales by private 
individuals, totalled R618 billion. 
  The proportion of food products in the retails sales volume 
of officially registered enterprises was 49 percent. In 
comparison to 1992 there were declines in purchases of salt, 
fresh and canned fish, margarine and sausage by 3-12 percent, of 
butter, cheese and eggs by 15-20 percent, of meat, poultry, 
sugar and canned meats by 21-26 percent, of fresh and processed 
vegetables by 30 percent, and of potatoes by 34 percent. In 
comparison to 1992 there was an increase in sales of vegetable 
oil, fruit and confectionery items by 2-12 percent, of tea by 23 
percent, and of herring by 70 percent. 
  The volume of consumer services performed decreased by 20 
percent in comparison to 1992. This decline in consumer service 
volume was attributable to fewer customers as a result of high 
prices, and to shortages of materials. 
<H5>  Physical Production </H5>
<H8>  Industry </H8>
  In comparison with last year industrial output declined by 
19 
percent, calculated in comparable prices. However, the last 
quarter showed slower decline in industrial output. The main 
problems of last year persist in 1994: non-payment, lack of 
funds for development, high lending rates and tax rates, an 
imperfect pricing system and, consequently, disproportion 
between supply and demand. 
  In 1993 there was a drop in the output of a majority of the 
most important types of product. In the fuels industry 
production of oil, including gas concentrate, declined by 7 
percent in comparison to the previous year. A decrease in 
primary petroleum refining caused a drop in production of key 
petroleum products: heating oil and automotive gasoline by 6-9 
percent, and kerosene and lubricant oils by 16-22 percent. 
  Enterprises in the ferrous metals industry saw a decline in 
output. 
  Enterprises in the chemical industry produced a little more 
than half as many pesticides as in 1992, and there was a 10-15 
percent drop in production of tires for agricultural equipment 
and tractors, animal feed proteins and synthetic rubbers. 
  The drop in output of agricultural equipment, computers and 
tractor engines was 55-89 percent; for bearings, tractors and 
self-propelled cranes output was down by 22-32 percent. 
<H8>  Agriculture </H8>
  According to preliminary figures the 1993 volume of 
agricultural production (in comparable 1983 [sic] prices) 
increased for the first time in three years, totalling R2.4 
billion (112 percent of the 1992 level). There was a 24-percent 
increase in total crop production, primarily attributable to a 
large grain crop, as well as an increase in livestock production 
by privately-owned farms. 
  In 1993 private garden plots and privately-owned farms 
accounted for more than one-third of total agricultural output. 
  The livestock situation remains difficult. The number of 
head 
of beef cattle owned by kolkhozes, sovkhozes and collective 
agricultural enterprises declined by 13 percent in the past 
year, milking herds by 9 percent, pigs by 26 percent and sheep 
and goats by 19 percent. Significantly fewer offspring were 
born. In addition, during the year 71,000 head of cattle and 
161,000 pigs died, or more than one-fourth of all offspring, as 
well as 305,000 sheep and goats, or 64 percent of all offspring. 
Livestock productivity was low. 
  As a result of the negative processes occurring in the 
livestock sector production continues to decline. 
<H8>  Capital Construction </H8>
  Last year the amount of investment by enterprises and 
organizations under all forms of ownership totalled R263 
billion, decreasing in comparison to 1992 by 8 percent in 
comparable prices; for production-related construction these 
figures were R169 billion and a decrease of 19 percent. 
  The value of completed fixed capital was R131 billion, of 
which R86 billion was production-related. 
  Of the 37 facilities slated for completion during the year 
only eight were actually completed. 
  During the year the agro-industrial complex utilized 36 
percent less capital investment funding from all sources 
combined than in 1992. 
  There was a decrease by a factor of two in construction 
investments in the processing sectors of the agro-industrial 
complex. 
  There was some improvement with regard to construction of 
facilities in the social realm. During the year the oblast's 
citizens received 9,900 new, well-appointed apartments with a 
total floor space of 645,000 square meters, or 21 percent more 
than in 1992. 
<H5>  Transportation and Communications </H5>
  Freight shipments by common carrier decreased by 24 percent, 
with decreases in shipments by air of 36 percent, by truck -- 34 
percent, by river -- 14 percent, and by rail -- 12 percent. The 
decline in shipping volume was due to a decline in production 
for many types of product. 
  Rising rates for passenger transportation resulted in 
smaller 
numbers of passengers, for a 7-percent decrease. Decreases in 
individual sectors were: air travel -- 32 percent; river travel 
-- 16 percent; and motor vehicle transportation -- 8 percent. 
Passenger travel by rail increased by 8 percent, as that form of 
transportation was relatively inexpensive and available to the 
public in 1993. 
  Despite an 11-fold increase in the revenues received by 
communications enterprises as compared to last year, those 
enterprises performed 30 percent fewer actual services. 
<H5>  Foreign Economic Relations </H5>
  Companies and entrepreneurs from more than 50 countries 
around the world engaged in foreign trade transactions with 
enterprises, organizations and private companies in the oblast. 
  According to preliminary figures the oblast's foreign trade 
volume was $599 million, increasing by a factor of five in 
comparison with 1992. The foreign trade balance was positive. 
  The oblast's exports to contract holders totalled $502 
million, up by a factor of almost seven. Fuel and energy 
resources comprised more than 85 percent of the oblast's 
exports. Approximately four million tonnes of crude oil were 
exported, as well as 516,000 tonnes of petroleum products, 
approximately 15,000 tonnes of unprocessed aluminum, more than 
15 million meters of cotton fabric, 2,500 tonnes of synthetic 
rubber and other products. 
  Imports totalled $97 million and were up by a factor of 2.5 
in comparison with 1992. The bulk of imports consisted of 
machinery and equipment (33 percent), foodstuffs (sugar, tobacco 
products, coffee, etc.), manufactured consumer goods (clothing, 
footwear, televisions and VCRs) and other products.

<F P=106> [POSTFACTUM report: "French Concern Will Engage in </F>
Prospecting and Production of Oil in Russia"] 
  [Text] In April the first group of specialists from the 
French concern Elf Aquitaine will arrive in Volgograd to perform 
work on oil prospecting and production. An agreement on survey 
efforts was reached between the administration of the oblast and 
the concern as early as 1991. However, implementation of the 
project became possible only after the government resolved to 
exempt Elf Aquitaine from customs duties on medical [as 
published] equipment it imports to Russia. Experts estimate that 
there are about 300 million tonnes of oil under the oblast. 
According to the terms of the contract, 60 percent of the oil 
produced will remain in Russia, and 40 percent will become the 
property of the concern.

<F P=106> [Article by Irina Vladykina under the rubric "Elected </F>
Representatives": "Russia's Choice Has Defeated the `Patriots' 
in the Struggle for the Legislative Assembly of Perm Oblast"] 
  [Text] Perm--Some 34.4 percent of the population took part 
in an election of deputies to the legislative assembly of Perm 
Oblast. A single deputy was elected and named in each of 37 out 
of 40 districts. The fact that seven candidates from the 
Russia's Choice bloc were elected, defeating the Patriots of 
Russia bloc which conducted a very vigorous preelection 
propaganda campaign, became something of a sensation. 
  The new public association Region also met with failure: 
Only 
two out of 21 candidates were elected; the renaissance of the 
Kama area--the development and execution of a long-term program 
for socioeconomic renewal of Perm Oblast--was proclaimed to be 
its main objective. 
  If you read attentively the list of 37 elected deputies, you 
will understand that in the course of this election the vote was 
in favor of individual fellow citizens rather than parties: 
Almost all are the supreme officials of administrations, 
enterprises, banks, and hospitals; they are people who are known 
in the oblast. There are many representatives of the local 
executive authorities among them: Vladimir Fil heads the 
administration of Perm, Nikolay Poluyanov--Permyakia; Mikhail 
Bystryantsev is chairman of the Perm Oblast Soviet. More 
deputies than ever, nine, were elected from among bankers and 
entrepreneurs. They include Vladimir Khlebnikov, president of 
the Perm Commodity and Stock Exchange, Yuriy Trutnev, general 
director of the Eks-Limited industrial and financial group, and 
Grigoriy Barshevskiy, president of BiS-Credit Bank. The director 
corps, agrarians, and representatives of humanitarian 
professions--physicians and teachers--are widely represented. 
  The second round of voting will be held in 12 weeks in the 
districts in which elections were not validly held. The amount 
of 2 billion rubles was spent for the elections, three-quarters 
of which was allocated from the federal budget, and the 
remainder--from the local budget.

<F P=106> [Article by Natalya Gorodetskaya: "Kirsan Ilyumzhinov Will </F>
Possibly Have To Remain President: The Deal Involving the Sale 
of Sovereignty Might Remain Unconsummated"] 
  [Text] As SEGODNYA has already reported, a proposal by 
President Kirsan Ilyumzhinov concerning the need to abolish the 
republic Constitution and adopt the "Great Code of the Steppe" 
in its place was considered on 19 March at an extraordinary 
session of the parliament of Kalmykia. At the time, the members 
of parliament heeded the arguments of Mr. Ilyumzhinov, albeit 
with difficulty, and resolved to convene the Constitutional 
Assembly which was supposed to abolish the Constitution of the 
republic. According to the decision made, the organs of local 
self-government, public movements, and political parties of the 
republic were to assign their representatives to the 
Constitutional Assembly by 5 April. 
  Vyacheslav Kostikov, press secretary of the Russian 
Federation president, has made a statement concerning Mr. 
Ilyumzhinov's proposal to abolish the Constitution of the 
republic, adopt the "Great Code of the Steppe" instead, and sign 
the "General Treaty with the Russian Federation." Mr. Kostikov 
welcomed "the striving of the president of Kalmykia to preserve 
the unity of the Russian Federation." However, he indicated that 
the Constitution of the Russian Federation makes it possible to 
change the status of a component of the Russian Federation 
solely by mutual agreement between the Federation and its 
component on the basis of federal constitutional law. Mr. 
Kostikov believes that in calling for the abolition of the 
Constitution of the republic, Kirsan Ilyumzhinov meant precisely 
to change the status of Kalmykia. 
  However, Kirsan Ilyumzhinov did not even conceal his 
intention to give up sovereignty and equate the status of the 
republic with that of an oblast of the Russian Federation. One 
would think that this step by Kirsan Ilyumzhinov was prompted by 
the difficult economic situation of the republic rather than by 
a concern for "the greatness and indivisibility of Russia." 
There is a reason Kalmykia was one of the few republics of 
Russia to demand an increase in import tariffs: Sheep breeding 
and primary processing of wool account for 80 percent of the 
production in the republic. In the words of Viktor Khlystun, 
minister of agriculture of the Russian Federation, "the Kalmyk 
ethnic entity is perishing because of a 60 percent drop in 
production." The expedition of Kirsan Ilyumzhinov to the 
president of Russia in search of interest-free credit following 
his public rejection of subsidies from the Russian Federation 
(which accounted for two-thirds of the budget of the republic) 
clearly indicates that it is impossible for him to keep his 
election promises to live off the republic's own money and 
foreign investment and to make the Kalmyks more affluent than 
their neighbors while paying taxes to the federal budget in full. 
  It appears that, upon assessing the opportunities for 
Kalmykia's survival, the president resolved to trade the 
sovereignty of the republic for Russian subsidies. Besides, on 
the eve of adoption of the federal budget and the beginning of 
carving up grants for the indigent regions, Mr. Ilyumzhinov 
apparently saw fit to deserve forgiveness from Boris Yeltsin for 
having "sat in the White House in October 1993," creating the 
alternative "Federation Council," and demanding that the Supreme 
Soviet of the Russian Federation and the president run 
simultaneously in elections. 
  However, a number of political parties and movements and 
public organizations of the republic which do not wish to lose 
state sovereignty and turn into an oblast of Russia have set up 
a public committee in defense of the Constitution and statehood 
of Kalmykia. Yesterday's appeal of the new committee reads: 
"Until recently, the Republic of Kalmykia was a region with a 
stable political situation and relatively favorable ethnic 
relations. We, the citizens of Kalmykia, along with all citizens 
of the Russian Federation, are sincerely interested in 
preserving and strengthening our great Motherland of Russia. 
However, we do not intend to give up our small Motherland--the 
Republic of Kalmykia--either. Yet, the official statement of the 
president of the republic about the need to abolish the 
Constitution and renounce its citizenship leads not only to 
changing the status of the republic and undermining its 
statehood, but also to encroaching on the Constitution of the 
Russian state." 
  The defenders of Kalmyk statehood maintain that society has 
now split, with the emerging "confrontation increasingly 
acquiring an ethnic coloring." They warn President Kirsan 
Ilyumzhinov of his "responsibility for possible consequences." 
Moreover, says the statement, "this so-called legislative 
initiative of our president may cause a chain reaction in 
complicating the situation in other regions of the Russian 
Federation." 
  Incidentally, representatives of some republics belonging to 
the Russian Federation have already voiced their attitude toward 
the proposal of the president of Kalmykia, calling him a 
"traitor and apostate" who is giving up sovereignty at a time 
when the rest of the republics are demanding as much freedom as 
possible, especially on issues of taxation and budget formation. 
  The issue of adopting the "Great Code of the Steppe" instead 
of the Constitution was discussed yesterday by a congress of the 
nations of Kalmykia.

<F P=106> [Article by Aleksandr Bekker and Lyudmila Moskalenko under </F>
the rubric "Underpinnings": "The MASS Has Proposed a Draft for 
the Revival of Siberia: The Local Authorities Intend To Hold 
Their Positions"] 
  [Text] Novosibirsk--The two years of economic reforms in 
Russia have indicated that the "strategically structured but 
market-ineffective economy of Siberia is being destroyed too 
rapidly by the processes of disintegration"--such is the 
conclusion of the Interregional Association "Siberian Agreement" 
(MASS). The presentation of the draft strategy for the 
development of Siberia was attended by Sergey Shakhray and Yuriy 
Skokov, which, in view of the ambitions of these politicians, is 
very significant. 
  The initial premise of the MASS concept is that, instead of 
evolving in keeping with the laws of the market, the economic, 
military-industrial, and scientific complexes of Siberia were 
formed by the party and state apparatus. Actually, in the 
opinion of the authors of the draft, it was precisely owing to 
the natural and geostrategic resources of the region that the 
Soviet Union became a world power. However, the peculiarity of 
Siberia is such, says the draft, that Gaydar's monetarism does 
not fly there because of the "impossibility of rapid and 
bloodless reintegration of the Siberian regions into the 
national economy." The authors believe that by persisting in 
continuing the present course, the Center will "finish off" the 
economy of the Urals, Siberia, and the Far East, which will 
become the target of claims by pan-Islamists, Chinacentrists, 
and the G-7. A change in the map of the country--such is the 
price, in the opinion of "Siberian Agreement" analysts, Russia 
may pay for reformist extremism. 
  Active interference by the state in the process of 
transformations is needed in order to avoid a catastrophe. Under 
the conditions of the region, the need for a firm steering hand 
is amplified by the fact that it is necessary to maintain the 
viability of the fuel and energy complex and at the same time 
restructure it by accurately adjusting prices; to prevent the 
disintegration of transportation systems and a break with the 
European section of Russia; and to support single-industry 
production in the "off-limits" cities of Siberia which 
originally were not adapted to market competition. The same 
applies to the scientific and educational complex of the region. 
  The developers of the MASS are convinced that Moscow would 
be 
making a fundamental mistake if it failed to take into account 
the peculiarities of Siberians, for whom "the meaning of life 
should be set forth on a noneconomic, geostrategic plane. The 
population of Siberia will be able to endure the forthcoming 
privation only having grasped its global mission. Only after the 
population is rallied around the noneconomic and economic 
concepts of development of Siberia will it become possible to 
offer to it economic studies in the hope that they will not be 
tacitly ignored by the majority." 
  Previously, the regional associations of Russia have, 
without 
further ado, asked for or demanded money from the government, 
emphasizing the idea of republics from time to time. Experts on 
the mentality of Siberians and world trends from "Siberian 
Agreement" were the first to use the trump card of geopolitics: 
"At present, financing comes from Moscow, but the geostrategic 
resources of Siberia are no less significant. It is necessary to 
preserve Siberia--the Achilles heel of Russia--and to deprive 
everyone of an opportunity to make Siberia the location of 
Russia's political fiasco." 
  The MASS concept offers no proof of the necessary 
degradation 
of the region as a result of reforms. The provided statistics of 
the growth of the death rate and fall in the birth rate and the 
proportion of able-bodied population cover the period from 1979 
to 1992 and, one would think, are not directly related to 
monetarism. Under Gorbachev, the energy of regional leaders was 
dispersed in the struggle for material quotas and was restricted 
by the mechanism of coercion by directive, too. At present money 
is the most important issue, and industries and regions fight 
for it. This is precisely why monetarism has been proclaimed to 
be the greatest evil. The concept does not in any way expand on 
this term itself; it appears as the same kind of an ideological 
cliche as imperialism once was. In essence, the MASS offers the 
authorities in the capital city some kind of division of labor 
by way of its draft for the development of Siberia: Moscow will 
retain the geostrategic resources of the region, and the region 
will be assigned, on a permanent basis, various allotments, 
licenses, quotas, and other restrictions on economic and 
commercial activity, the right to build over parcels of land, to 
open production facilities and bank branches, to grant tax 
relief, and so on. 
  Therefore, the same material and financial content appears 
in 
a new packaging. Siberian politicians of the latest crop want to 
lay their hands on territorial resources in order to firmly take 
power and become full-fledged partners of foreign companies and 
national private capital in investment projects. The intentions 
of the real authors of the concept--people who might be wrong 
but who sincerely feel for Siberia--notwithstanding, the draft 
will be used by the local management elite in its own interests. 
  As they haggle with Moscow, the local authorities proclaim 
the creation of an "economic mechanism for the revival of the 
economy of Siberia under the aegis of the 'Siberian Agreement' 
Interregional Association." However, one would think that the 
MASS carries the genetic imprint of the old bureaucratic system, 
being the flesh and blood of administrative socialism. While 
furiously criticizing Moscow on account of Gaydar's monetarism, 
the new elite is ready at the same time to hide out under the 
wing of the Center, fearing the rapid development of private 
capital in Siberia. However, the latter is already strong enough 
to hold its own but for now lacks the potential to solve the 
global problems of the region.

Novosibirsk: "The President's Edict on Energy Does Not Satisfy 
Siberia: Members of MASS Intend To Demand a Review of Prices and 
Tariffs". The article is under the rubric "Regions."] 
  [Text] Approximately 40 heads of administration and 
directors of enterprises in 14 krays and oblasts, all members of 
the "Siberian Agreement" Interregional Association (MASS), met 
in Novosibirsk to review and dicuss Boris Yeltsyn's draft Edict 
"On How Relationships in Ownership of Electrical Energy Should 
be Regulated Between Federal and Territorial Agencies" and the 
mechanism for formulating tariffs on electrical and thermal 
energy. According to participants, the discussion in which 
"opposing points of view were expressed," was very heated. In 
the end, the draft of the presidential edict, prepared by the 
Ministry of Economics of the Russian Federation [RF], was 
declared to be "premature," since it was "put together in 
isolation" from the well-thought-out concept for managing a 
unified electrical energy system "under new economic conditions" 
and "it does not fully consider the problem of relationships 
with regard to ownership, rights, and responsibilities" between 
the Center and the regions. The Coordinating Council decided 
that within two months it would formulate and present to the 
government a proposal from MASS "on reforming the managerial 
system for electrical energy from the viewpoint of protecting 
the interests of the territories." 
  Representatives of MASS called the mechanism for formulating 
tariffs on electrical and thermal energy "incomplete and 
unacceptable." Participants of the Novosibirsk get-together 
believe that "the intensifying crisis caused by nonpayments" is 
but one result of this formulation. For February, 19 percent of 
electrical energy and 8 percent of delivered gas were paid for. 
The overall level of payments has decreased from 63 percent at 
the end of last year to 47 percent in February 1994. Even though 
the main victim of nonpayments was the Thermal and Electrical 
Power Commission (TEK), as the absolute net creditor, the heads 
of Siberian oblasts considered it necessary to fight the crisis 
by decreasing or freezing tariffs on electrical energy, which 
are, on the average, five times lower than worldwide tariffs. 
For this reason it was decided to ask the Council of Ministers 
to review the "Statute on State Regulation of Tariffs for 
Electrical and Thermal Energy in the RF for 1994." The crux of 
the MASS proposals, which are intended to be prepared within a 
month, is that the Inter-Regional "Siberian Agreement" Energy 
Commission--formed on a voluntary basis--will present Moscow 
with "correct" tariffs for industrial and agrarian consumers of 
energy, as well as with regular amounts for "light and heat" to 
be paid by private individual customers. 
  Notwithstanding the seeming unity of the meeting 
participants, to come up with agreed-upon positions in a month 
or two, and even more so, to gain the government's 
understanding, apparently will not be so simple. First, a 
definitive reworking of tariffs on electrical/thermal energy 
will impact on the financial interests of RAO [All-Russia 
Joint-Stock Society], the Russian Unified Electrical Power 
System, and will threaten the summer cycle of repair work on 
stations and electric power lines [LEP]. Mr. Kuzmin, who 
participated in the RAO discussions, stated that freezing 
tariffs on electrical energy is allowable only if "the 
government freezes prices on energy resources and railroad 
tariffs." However, prices of oil and coal were liberated by law, 
and to push prices back, even through the administrative efforts 
of Oleg Soskovets, would not be so simple. At this point it is 
worthwhile to note the position of the Ministry of Fuel and 
Energy, which was publicized in Novosibirsk by Deputy Minister 
Vitaliy Bushuyev: "Either we take the market route and try to 
get prices on energy carriers and agro-industrial production to 
correspond with world prices or we impose central regulation on 
everything. The second alternative spells catastrophe." 
  Of course, there is an intermediate version of cartel 
agreements by industrial branches and enterprises for component 
parts, which brings together regional authorities and a number 
of high officials from the Cabinet of Ministers and, 
specifically, the same Mr. Soskovets. However, the true 
intentions and hopes of representatives of the processing 
industry, we think, boils down to strictly fixing "energy" 
prices, but not paying much attention to the prices charged by 
tens of thousands of suppliers to the TEK. It was not by 
coincidence that at the meeting of the MASS Coordinating 
Council, for all practical purposes no one hardly raised any 
questions about converting debts to promissory notes. On the 
other hand, there was active discussion on the subject of "cheap 
energy resources that are going out of Siberia." 
  Two more conflicts come to light. As is well known, Moscow 
was aiming for the inclusion of a series of hydroelectric 
stations on the Yenisey and Angara Rivers in the RAO, the 
Russian Unified Electrical Power System, while authorities in 
Krasnoyarsk and Irkutsk tried to keep them as property owned by 
the oblast. At one time, this matter was investigated by the 
Constitutional Court, but a final decision was never rendered. 
On the other hand, there is no unanimity within the "Siberian 
Agreement" on this matter either. As a whole, MASS is in favor 
of having a "state within a state" by creating within the 
framework of the Russian unified energy system a Siberian 
wholesale market for power capacity and energy. At the same 
time, however, authorities in Krasnoyarsk and Irkutsk are firm 
in their intentions to supply cheap electrical energy to the 
power-consuming giants of the aluminum industry, while the 
leadership of, say, Novosibirsk would like to take that same 
energy and divert it to plants of the military-industrial 
complex. 
  The scope of the "state system" discussed in Novosibirsk can 
be judged from a phrase spoken by one of the participants: "What 
we need now are not structural or organizational perestroykas, 
but painstaking work to undo the non-payment crisis."

<F P=106> [Article by Sergey Ponomarev, staff correspondent: "Bread </F>
Distributed on Credit, According to Lists"] 
  [Text] Khabarovsk--Almost 90 percent of the population of 
Bikinskiy Rayon have a standard of living below that established 
by the kray administration. Of the 3,618 large families in 
Komsomolsk-na-Amur, 3,115 are in need of immediate material 
assistance. More than 130 enterprises in the kray are standing 
idle and their workers have been forced to take unpaid leave. At 
the same time wages have been held back since September on the 
majority of sovkhozes in the Amur region, and bread is 
distributed on credit in the rural consumers' cooperative 
stores, according to lists.... 
  These facts, heard at the annual meeting of deputy 
administration chiefs of cities and rayons of Khabarovsk Kray 
and leaders of departments and committees for social protection, 
illustrate better than anything else the condition of despair 
that now prevails in the remote areas of Russia. Speaking before 
participants in the conference, the chairman of the kray 
Committee for Social Protection of the Population, Nikolay 
Telyatnikov, noted: "We have taken on a heavy burden with empty 
pockets." 
  Today, in his words, it is easier to name those whose 
existence can be defined as more or less bearable because added 
to the traditional categories of underprivileged--pensioners, 
disabled persons, the chronically ill, workers of the budget 
sphere--in recent months have been those who are officially 
registered and actually unemployed, single mothers, especially 
those living in dormitories and receiving wages that are less 
than what is needed to pay for housing, and also school 
graduates who have been left without work. 
  The only reason social upheaval has not occurred so far, 
thinks the deputy chief of the administration of Bikinskiy 
Rayon, Raisa Kabanchenko, is that the people of the Far East are 
too patient. But very soon, in her opinion, the explosion will 
have to occur both in "the defense sector" and in rural areas as 
well as other places. It is no accident that the kray's 
governor, Viktor Ishayev, in order to provide at least some 
emergency payments to the needy, a couple of days ago issued a 
directive to stop payment instructions for a total of 7 billion 
rubles [R] earmarked for the Pension Fund of Russia, which had 
been filled out by the Khabarovsk division. 
  The first deputy minister of social protection of the 
Russian 
Federation, Boris Dudenkov, participating in the meeting and 
evaluating such actions on the part of the administration as 
"local hooliganism" which could lead to the "collapse of 
Russia," admitted, however, that attempts to get into the 
pension fund are being made not only in the krays and oblasts 
but also at the very highest level. In particular, the Ministry 
of the Economy is now actively working out plans to use this 
money for financing the miners. 
  Those who have survived the social and economic wilderness 
have no hope yet. According to Dudenkov's information, the 
Ministry of Finance has not yet transferred to the Republic Fund 
for Social Support of the Population R28 billion withheld since 
1992. True, thinks one of the leaders of the social ministry 
itself, there must be a different approach to forming these 
funds: Not through direct taxes but with excise taxes on luxury 
items and some of the funds received from privatization. 
  And while the ministry staff is building castles in the air 
and thinking about how to take some money from the rich in order 
to help the most deprived, the Khabarovsk Kray authorities are 
hoping for financial support from the capital. As the deputy 
governor, Irina Strelkova, put it, "It would be wrong to ask for 
a lot but we have indicated the main sore spots in the package 
of documents prepared for the government." 
  This has to do with the so-called targeted allotment of 
funds 
for a sum of about R10 billion. Above all for conducting child 
summer health protection measures and completing the 
reconstruction of a specialized boarding house for people 
suffering from chronic psychological illnesses.

<F P=106> [Article by Sergey Yuryev: "What the Bankers Conferred </F>
About"] 
  [Text] A meeting of the managers of a number of 
Novosibirsk banks was held behind closed doors several days 
ago. 
  This meeting was held at the initiative of the Novosibirsk 
branch of the AKB [joint-stock commercial bank] Vostokinvestbank 
and the Siberian commercial bank Aurum. All aspects of banking 
activity were examined at the conference. The participants were 
compelled to do this, in particular, by the recent decision of 
the government to establish a minimal authorized capital in the 
amount of 2 billion rubles [R], with subsequent quarterly 
adjustments. 
  To date, more than 70 independent banks and branches have 
been operating in our oblast. On the average, their authorized 
capital is about R300 million. The level of work of the banks is 
very different, which can also be judged by the rating that is 
regularly established by the main administration of the Central 
Bank of Russia for Novosibirsk Oblast. Lately, the demands on 
the banks to provide services on an international level are 
becoming more and more persistent. Also, competition is 
increasing. Therefore, the problem of improving the quality of 
banking services is becoming more and more critical, and it is 
unattainable for many without bank mergers. This was also the 
main question that the bankers discussed. 
  Two concepts of future development were proposed at this 
meeting. Boris Dudarev, the chairman of the board of the Aurum 
Bank, proposed an amalgamation under the aegis of Moscow 
organizations. The second concept, proposed by Pavel Mityakin, 
the director of the Novosibirsk branch of the AKB 
Vostokinvestbank, was based on regional interests. But they, in 
the opinion of the leadership of Vostokinvestbank, are closer to 
the eastern regions than to the western regions (the main bank, 
Vostokinvestbank, is in Vladivostok, and it has various ties 
with states of the Asia-Pacific region; it is a member of the 
global international financial telecommunications association, 
and its capital authorization is more than R12 billion). 
  The bankers have not adopted a final resolution yet.

<F P=106> [Viktor Serov report: "Vasiliy Kiselev, Vice Governor of </F>
Novosibirsk Oblast: `We Are Duty Bound To Resolve the 
Nonpayments Problem'"] 
  [Text] Novosibirsk--The decline in production in 
Novosibirsk Oblast in January constituted 35 percent, and this 
rate continued in February. One-fourth of the workers are 
without a job, practically. And these figures characterize not 
only the military-industrial complex, what is more, but also the 
production of consumer goods and food, of which there can be no 
question of a surplus. Enterprise mutual arrears are at the 
two-month output sales level. They have grown one-third and 
constitute almost R200 billion. 
  This means that simple methods of influencing inflation (by 
way of a cutback in the issue of credit, for example) will not 
work. The enterprises are reacting to this with mutual commodity 
credit. There are no payments to the treasury here, no money for 
wages, and so forth. The unpaid wages are today approaching a 
month's arrears. Thus the pressure in the pot is growing. 
  "Unfortunately, at the enlarged session of the government," 
Vasiliy Kiselev said, "I did not see specific mechanisms of a 
resolution of this problem. And unless a solution is found 
within two or three months, the entire Russian financial and 
economic system will explode. 
  "But we have an opportunity for another version of events 
also," the vice governor continued. "I cannot fail to mention 
with satisfaction the actions of the Ministry of Finance. This 
most unitary department is engaging in clearly expressed 
federalist actions. I am sure that as of 1 April the Ministry of 
Finance will introduce to the system of transfer relations of 
the budgets of the territory and the federal budget [sentence as 
published]. This means that there will be the nonspecific, 
unstipulated transfer of funds from one budget to another for 
the purpose of equalization of budget and financial support for 
the territory. 
  After all, it is obvious that the inequality of Russia's 
regions from the federal budget viewpoint could rupture the 
unity of Russia faster than any talk about separatism or 
unitarism. But why, tell me, did per capita expenditure in 
Novosibirsk Oblast in 1993 constitute R96,500, in Omsk Oblast 
R184,000, and in Kemerovo Oblast R294,000? The answer is clearly 
not economic!... So as of the second quarter of the present year 
this approach will, with the emergence of the appropriate 
prescriptive base, be eliminated. And it will not be necessary 
to crawl around offices of the capital and ask for budget 
handouts.

<F P=106> [Article by Viktor Karytko: "Foreign Companies as Engines </F>
for Our Conversion? Are the Japanese Really So Selfless in Their 
Desire To Help Clear the Maritime Region of Radioactive Wastes?"] 
  [Text] The problem of recovering low-level liquid 
radioactive waste (ZhRO) accumulated as a result of repair and 
preventive work on nuclear submarines of the Pacific Ocean Fleet 
up until now, as we know, had only one solution in our country: 
The waste waters were simply poured into the sea. The country 
had no developed technology for purifying these waste waters. 
Last fall, when they were last poured into the Sea of Japan, it 
evoked an extremely negative reaction from the opposite shore. 
The Japanese are also very uneasy about the two tankers filled 
to the brim with liquid radioactive waste in the form of 
radioactive ice which are moored at the dock of the Zvezda 
Plant. Therefore it is no accident that the Japanese have 
expressed their readiness to render assistance in solving this 
problem which, of course, is purely our own, and not only to 
provide us with tankers (which we are refusing) but also to 
allot financial funds for the construction in the kray of a 
plant for disposing of liquid radioactive waste under the 
condition that some of these funds will be transferred to 
Japanese firms so they can place orders there. It would seem 
that this option would be completely acceptable to us. But 
events related to this project which would seem to be free of 
charge for Russia show that this is not so. 
  Representatives of two Japanese firms were in Vladivostok on 
a "prospecting" mission in December. For their government's 
money they wanted to "do a great favor for these unreasonable 
Russians who do not know what to do with their radioactive 
waste".... In the kray administration there was a conference to 
which for some reason nobody thought of inviting scientists from 
the Far Eastern Branch of the Russian Academy of Sciences. 
Nonetheless they were subsequently able to look over the 
Japanese plan and make judgments about it which, briefly, 
consist in the following. 
  In the first place, the technology proposed by the foreign 
firms would require extremely large expenditures of electric 
energy when compared to the output from a thermal electric power 
plant with average capacity.... And this when the region is in a 
deep energy crisis to begin with. If we keep in mind the many 
billions spent to pay for electric energy, for this reason alone 
combining the Japanese project with our "harsh" conditions looks 
problematic to say the least. Second, after the plant is built, 
its subsequent operation will cost the region $300,000-$450,000 
annually (purchasing consumable materials, spare parts, 
conducting repair work, etc.). Finally, in the third place, the 
Japanese specialists, as it turns out, are suggesting 
"purifying" the radioactive waste with the formation...of other 
waste (highly active salt solutions and solid radioactive waste, 
and subsequent disposal of these is not envisioned by the 
Japanese technology). In general, our scientists came to the 
conclusion, substantiated in all respects, that the Japanese 
version for disposing of liquid radioactive waste in the 
Maritime region is unacceptable mainly because of its 
obsolescence and its extremely high cost. 
  As a counterproposal the scientists and specialists of the 
Far Eastern Branch of the Russian Academy of Sciences put forth 
their own alternative plan. It consists in using sorption 
technology, taking advantage of many years of work and the 
latest achievements in this area which happen to be from Far 
Eastern scientists. Its advantage over the Japanese version 
consists in its considerably lower (1,000-fold) proportional 
expenditure of electric energy; the utilization of unique and 
inexpensive materials (multi-composite sorbents produced from 
local raw material--Chuguyevskiy zeolites); the significantly 
lesser capital-intensiveness of production and the independence 
of its operation from deliveries of imported spare parts and 
batching items. 
  The deputy chairman of the Far Eastern Branch of the Russian 
Academy of Sciences, Doctor of Chemical Sciences V. Sergiyenko, 
presented these conclusions in a report sent on 16 December of 
last year to the governor of the kray, Ye. Nazdrantenko. He also 
pointed out in it that the Far Eastern Branch of the Russian 
Academy of Sciences was prepared to take the initiative for 
creating an interdepartmental creative collective which could in 
a short period of time, literally within a month or two, present 
a detailed plan for disposing of low level liquid radioactive 
waste in the Maritime region for technical-economic and 
ecological expert evaluation. At the same time he emphasized the 
insistent need to conduct such an expert evaluation before 
making a decision or signing any documents with Japanese firms. 
The kray administration was asked to allot 5 million rubles [R] 
for conducting the expert appraisal. 
  This report was followed by a note of clarification sent to 
the same address. It discussed the real possibility, within 
three or four months (under the condition that proper financing 
is available), of creating a domestic experimental industrial 
installation based on sorption technology with a capacity for 
"processing" 10-15 tonnes of liquid radioactive wastes a day 
directly at the enterprise where the radioactive waste is 
accumulated. What was the result from these reports? 
  On 6 January the Committee on the Utilization of Nature of 
the Kray Administration held a conference devoted to this 
question at which emphasis was once again placed on the need to 
conduct a comprehensive expert appraisal of all versions of 
disposal of liquid radioactive waste and the development of an 
alternative Russian plan in response to the one proposed by the 
Japanese. But that is all. Money for conducting this expert 
appraisal, not to mention funds for creating an experimental 
industrial installation (about R2 million rubles) was not 
provided on the grounds that the problem of disposing of liquid 
radioactive wastes in the Maritime region was not a kray problem 
but a federal one and so the financing should come from the 
corresponding budget. 
  Still our scientists considered the fact that they live not 
in Moscow but in the Maritime region and, in order to reinforce 
their conclusions with concrete results, at the end of February 
they conducted a series of laboratory experiments on sorption 
technology for purifying real radioactive waste from the Zvezda 
Plant. Their results turned out to be more than promising: After 
purifying liquid radioactive waste in sorption columns, the 
content of artificial radionuclides was significantly lower than 
the natural radioactive background and 10-1,000 times less than 
the norms for maximum permissible concentration. That is, after 
purification this water could be poured directly overboard 
without any ill effects. 
  Is this not an indicator of how well our technology can 
compete with any foreign one? And are our scientists asking too 
much by insisting on a competition of plans so that the Russian, 
Japanese, American, and any other installation will be placed 
side by side and then the results will be compared. This is what 
is done throughout the entire world when putting various plans 
up for bidding, when people indeed want to end up selecting the 
most advanced technology which is the most economically 
effective in all respects. 
  But, as it turned out, this approach does not fit in with 
our 
reality. What kind of competition of plans or bidding can there 
be when for three months the kray bureaucrats will not even 
allow the Vladivostok scientists, the creators of the most 
advanced technology for disposing of liquid radioactive wastes 
in Russia (and, probably, in the world as well--a competition 
would show that), in on the discussion of the problem. Yet, as 
we learned, not so long ago in the presence of the governor but 
in the absence of the scientists and specialists from the Far 
Eastern Branch of the Russian Academy of Sciences, in the kray 
administration there was a conference, as a result of which it 
seems to have been decided to give preference to the technology 
for disposing of liquid radioactive waste proposed by the 
Japanese corporation Marubeni.... 
  Corresponding Member of the Russian Academy of Sciences 
Viktor Glushchenko was extremely candid and, it seems, 
justifiably harsh in his evaluation of this situation. "To me 
and my colleagues who are specialists in this area this whole 
episode seems simply shameful," he said. "Why is the fate of a 
plan placed in the hands of kray bureaucrats? So that later they 
can again, on invitation from the Marubeni firm, travel as 
'experts' (as some have already done) to Japan and bring back 
presents from there, probably for a job well done? Apparently 
the same aspirations motivate the pro-Japanese lobbies in 
Moscow, where they have already created a concern which, from 
all appearances, can more efficiently 'divide up' the $100 
million allotted by the Government of Japan for nuclear 
disarmament in Russia and the problem of disposing of 
radioactive wastes which is related to this. For the money, of 
course, we thank you, but who said that this had to be invested 
only in foreign firms when we have much better domestic 
scientific developments and technologies that are essentially 
already prepared but which require a little money to bring them 
to completion? After all, we are not a Lower Volta [as 
published] and we ourselves are ultimately in a position to 
solve our own problems. I tell you as a scientist," V. 
Glushchenko said in conclusion, "that if our multi-composite 
sorbents are not needed, and they are the basis of the 
technology we propose for disposing of liquid radioactive 
wastes, I will make every effort to make sure that all our 
'know-how' in this area is patented abroad. Apparently nobody in 
Russia needs our developments...." 
  I do not think that Viktor Yuryevich will do exactly 
that--after all he is a Russian man and a resident of the 
Maritime region, but a fact is still a fact: Dozens if not 
hundreds of developments, many of which are up to the world 
level, by Far Eastern scientists remain unused, and financing 
for current research is practically frozen. And putting domestic 
sorption technology to work for disposing of liquid radioactive 
wastes could be a first step in the development in the Maritime 
region of a whole number of science-intensive productions for 
producing industrial and medical sorbents that are in extremely 
short supply in the world and for which, our scientists are 
convinced, there are no analogues yet. By investing a minimum 
today, when the orders for manufacturing equipment can be placed 
with our defense enterprises which are now standing idle, in the 
near future it would be possible to obtain a maximum, and in 
foreign currency. 
  These are the kinds of "selfish" goals pursued by our 
scientists in their desire to clear the kray of radioactive and 
any other kind of pollution without the participation of the 
Japanese "uncle," who is certainly not selfless and who would 
seem to want to build for us a plant for disposing of liquid 
radioactive wastes free of charge using obsolete technology and 
then for a long time receiving "dividends" in the form of income 
from operations. In a word, our conversion in their fashion. 
  Before going abroad to sign the contract with Marubeni (I 
will not mention others) it would be a good idea for our 
bureaucrats to think about this and perhaps learn from their 
neighbors how to look after national interests.

<F P=106> [Article by Shod Muladzhanov: "Codeword: `Power Vacuum;' </F>
Response: `Arbitrariness'"] 
  [Text] The apparat of bodies of authority is swelling 
minute by minute. Almost every day there are reports of an 
administration created, bosses appointed, a department expanded. 
I am afraid that soon Moscow itself will be too small to 
accommodate this gigantic army of do-nothings, bureaucrats 
generating red tape on any question except one--their own 
interests. These particular interests they tend to meticulously. 
And generate one decision after the other, whose main purpose is 
obvious: obtaining money for the budget to pay bureaucratic 
salaries and create the conditions for unofficial 
supplementation of these salaries with large bribes. 
  I apologize in advance to those few persons in ministries 
and 
agencies who do perform work that benefits the state, the 
economy, and society. But there are thousands of others... One 
gets the impression that someone is pursuing the goal of pure 
sabotage: As soon as the situation in the economy and the social 
sphere stabilizes slightly, decrees are adopted and directives 
signed that inevitably lead to an explosion, another round of 
inflation, and create problems for production, commercial 
activities, and the consumer market. I am not inclined to think 
in terms of sabotage, however. I insist on another explanation: 
personal gain. Naturally, the growing budget deficit plants the 
idea among the masses not included in the apparat orbit that it 
is time to reduce bureaucratic agencies. Naturally, the presence 
of numerous holes both in legislation and in approaches to its 
implementation permits functionaries to extort considerable 
money from anyone who wants to survive in the current chaos. 
  As if the first hike in customs duties was not enough--they 
had to hit prices with a whip so hard that they jumped right 
through the roof. As if it was not enough to add a 3 percent 
surcharge to the absolutely contrived and unjustified in our 
conditions value-added tax--beginning in April they decided to 
quietly milk enterprises some more by increasing deductions, 
which in the end go, again, not to pensioners and the disabled 
but into the "fund for salvation of bureaucrats, bankrupts, and 
producers of defective goods," which is what the state budget is 
to a considerable extent today. 
  Arbitrariness awaits us everywhere; it is growing stronger, 
propped up on the shoulders of the power vacuum. The law is not 
a deterrent for those who turn off water and electricity in 
homes, refuse to transport a patient to a hospital, in violation 
of property rights tow automobiles away from the streets and 
take them who knows where on the contrived grounds of illegal 
parking--as if there is any place where they can be parked 
legally. Some are arrested and then receive lengthy apologies; 
others are left alone, despite clear signs of criminal 
activities. This is everyday life. And in the economy, under 
loud proclamations of loyalty to reforms, they strengthen the 
monopolism of the poor excuse for producers who are incapable of 
competing with the Thai cottage industry and African farmers. 
  How long can one try people's patience by playing with 
presidential, government, and parliament decisions that span the 
gigantic amplitude from "hurrah" and "this is the only way" to 
"we apologize" and "we will take a different road now"? We are 
in no danger of getting either a wise tsar or a wise leadership, 
given the current disposition of forces in the top echelons. It 
is time to search for and promote new intelligent people, who 
could replace the current generation of powerless 
powerholders--and not in a decade but in the nearest elections. 
Civil accord is necessary and possible, but not on the basis of 
a compromise between groups of chatterboxes--only on the basis 
of true reforms in the economy and a well-defined approach to 
social problems.

<F P=106> [Article by Viktor Khatuntsev: "Peter, How Do You See Me?"] </F>
  [Text] The first fiber optic communications line in Russia 
has been placed into operation between Moscow and St. 
Petersburg. This marks the beginning of the development of this 
high capacity and reliably protected network, which makes it 
possible to significantly expand information exchange. 
  In order to give a more complete visual representation, the 
first, premiere, communications session was set up between two 
audiences which had gathered in these two cities. Greeting his 
colleague, Anatoliy Sobchak, Moscow Mayor Yuriy luzhkov noted 
that a current market is unthinkable without a well-regulated 
communications infrastructure, particularly since this is 
vitally important for both of the Russian megalopoli. There were 
no distortions in the "live picture" from Petersburg, and the 
mayors agreed that now it is fully possible to hold joint 
planning sessions of the two city administrations. 
  The new digital network owes its existence to the 
cooperation 
of the Makomnet, Metracom and Raskom companies with our railroad 
and metro builders. Installers laid 688 kilometers of cable 
along the Oktyabrskiy Railroad line, without interrupting train 
traffic. 
  "The new communications line will make it possible to 
increase safety and expand the possibility of automation," said 
First Deputy Minister of Railways Oleg Moshenko. "This is a good 
groundwork for building a high-speed Moscow-St. Petersburg line. 
Now we anticipate developing the network to Vladivostok and 
Novorossiysk. And for our rather overloaded metro trains, the 
expansion in the range of communications will make it possible 
to increase the rhythmic movement and effectiveness of 
information." 
  The Moscow mayor's office has already allocated 24 billion 
rubles (R) for building a high-speed line, which has been 
conditionally named the Novonikolayevskiy line. Meanwhile, 
Petersburg builders have demonstrated the model of a new 
electric locomotive which will soon undergo route testing. The 
new route will make it possible to employ millions of people in 
the development of the adjoining territories. Understandably, 
the two capitals will have to act in close cooperation. This 
cooperation has already been quite successfully tested in 
developing this country's suburban electric railway. Thirty-two 
enterprises have been involved in this work, and the assembly of 
trains is in full swing at the plant in Torzhok.

<F P=106> [Interview with Viktor Anatolyevich Maksimov, Moscow City </F>
Duma speaker, conducted by Nikolay Figurovskiy: "Our Homes and 
the City Duma"] 
  [Text] On 12 December of last year Muscovites elected 
a city Duma comprised of 35 deputies. The new representative 
body's speaker is Viktor Maksimov. He is 47 years old and has 
lived in Moscow since 1968. He started out as a neighborhood 
militiaman. He later worked in the USSR and RSFSR ministries of 
internal affairs. He was a Moscow City Soviet deputy. 
  At PRAVDA's request the head of the Duma talks about 
his job. 
  [Figurovskiy] Viktor Anatolyevich, how does the Moscow City 
Duma differ from previous representative bodies? 
  [Maksimov] The City Duma's powers are not based on 
authoritative directives to the executive branch, but rather 
proposals of various options for solving problems. Duma decrees 
are signed by the mayor of Moscow. However, if necessary the 
Duma can override the mayor's "veto." 
  [Figurovskiy] Soon after its election the Moscow City Duma 
was called a "pocket" Duma. Is it in anybody's pocket? 
  [Maksimov] In my opinion, the fact that the government's 
proposal regarding a transition to a new system of payment for 
housing and municipal services was discussed at five sessions 
and sent back for additional work three times indicates that the 
Duma made substantial amendments to the draft before approving 
it, with the objective of increasing Muscovites' level of social 
protection. 
  [Figurovskiy] Nevertheless the rent hike was an unpopular 
measure, to put it mildly. 
  [Maksimov] Yes, it was unpopular. But as long as housing is 
free it will not go to the people who need it, but instead to 
those who are close to those in power. Consider this: of the 
millions of square meters of free municipal housing built in 
Moscow every year people on prefectures' waiting lists get only 
about 20 percent... 
  There is one solution: transition to a market economy. 
Everything should have its price, and everything should be paid 
for. 
  [Figurovskiy] So will the great mass of middle-income 
families have to say goodbye to their dreams of new apartments? 
  [Maksimov] Not everyone will have to acquire housing at the 
market price. Following the example of many countries, we will 
introduce this system: every citizen will have the right, once 
in his or her life, to receive a standard allocation of housing 
of average quality free of charge. But if you want an apartment 
with more space or a better floor plan, then pay for it! 
  The higher payment for housing is a first step in that 
direction, though not a very large one. It will take us roughly 
five years to go all the way. 
  There are 18 square meters of living space for every 
resident 
of Moscow. Yet there are 700,000 people on waiting lists who 
have 8-10 square meters apiece. Another fact: luxury apartment 
buildings have very large auxiliary rooms that have not been 
paid for up until now. Is that fair? 
  [Figurovskiy] How much will housing now cost in Moscow? 
  [Maksimov] The new system will take effect in the second 
quarter. The government proposed introducing it in March, but 
the Duma deputies insisted that the new rates not be introduced 
before the city had a functional housing compensation system. We 
also insisted that rent depend not only on the number of square 
meters in an apartment, but also on the building's category. 
People will have to pay more for square meters that are "extra" 
relative to a social standard. 
  The gist of the new system can be expressed in a few words: 
rates for apartments and municipal services will be indexed in 
accordance with price increases over the past three years. At 
the same time, a number of categories of Moscow citizens will be 
paid housing compensation. 
  In the initial stage of reform a "belated" indexing of rates 
will be carried out. In the second stage, which the government 
plans to begin on 1 July, prices will go up by factors of 
between three and five. True, if the new system has not worked 
out by 1 July the Duma will have an opportunity to halt and 
postpone the start of the second stage. 
  A number of categories of Muscovites will receive housing 
compensation during the first stage. Compensation will be 
provided to citizens within the limits of Duma-approved 
standards for living space and municipal service consumption, 
with consideration for each family's total income. The deputies 
have approved the following housing standards: for citizens 
living alone, 33 square meters; for two-person families, 42 
square meters; and for families with three members or more, 18 
square meters per person. Incidentally, that is more than the 
government of Moscow proposed. 
  The average amount of rent and municipal services (excluding 
electricity, phone and radio hookup) can be calculated by 
multiplying the total size of an apartment by roughly 100. For 
example, if an apartment has 50 square meters of space, then the 
payment for it will be approximately R5,000. But that is only 
for Muscovites who have apartments that do not exceed living 
space standards. Those who have more square meters of space than 
allowed under the standard will also pay more. 
  The size of subsidies is determined according to a simple 
formula: the amount that goes to pay for an apartment should not 
exceed 10 percent of a family's budget. 
  Compensation will be paid in a non-cash form via a savings 
bank, i.e. a citizen will not be able to receive the money 
directly. 
  During the second quarter subsidies will only go to the 
poorest families --approximately 4 percent of Moscow residents. 
Subsequently the number of people receiving subsidies will 
increase.

<F P=106> [Unattributed report: "In the Wake of Scandal: Moscow </F>
Criminal Investigation Without a Chief"] 
  [Text] The Moscow City Duma's Commission on Law and Order 
and Anti-Crime Efforts has met to discuss the resignation of 
Yuriy Fedoseyev, chief of the Moscow Criminal Investigation 
Department. 
  The official reason given for the resignation, which was 
signed by Minister Brin, was retirement on account of age. The 
unofficial and, of course, primary reason was poor relations 
with General Pankratov, head of the capital's Internal Affairs 
Main Administration. That version, the city Duma's press center 
confirmed, was the subject of discussion by the commission 
members, who determined to "get to the bottom of the reasons 
behind this firing." 
  It is true that Fedoseyev has given 11 years "too much" 
service to his country. It is also true that the head of 
Moscow's Criminal Investigation Department is only a colonel -- 
something that does not happen if relations with those higher up 
are good. A general's rank is usually guaranteed. But the dual 
subordination of the Moscow Criminal Investigation Department's 
chief -- directly to the Ministry of Internal Affairs and only 
secondarily to the Moscow Internal Affairs Main Administration 
-- gives him many opportunities to become disliked. 
  There was also an official reason: just prior to Fedoseyev's 
resignation General Pankratov issued new quotas for arrests and 
successful investigations in Moscow, quotas that exceed former 
ones by 50 percent. For example, whereas when it comes to 
arrests made by public safety offices or the highway police it 
is enough to "make an effort," while this mania for percentages, 
which the years of perestroyka and democracy have been enough to 
partially erase from our memory, will hit the Moscow Criminal 
Investigation Department particularly hard. Rumors are 
circulating that Fedoseyev expressed negative opinions of the 
new quotas to the militia leadership. 
  For now the colonel, now in disfavor, has resigned, and no 
one knows whether he will become just another pensioner or file 
a lawsuit. In the latter case the capital can expect another 
carnival of militia/police disguises and ambitions.

<F P=106> [Article by Vladimir Koval: "Criminal Investigation Resigns"] </F>
  [Text] I do not recommend you read the following, because 
it is guaranteed not to make you feel optimistic. I am unhappy 
about it myself but, try as I may, there was just no getting 
around the numbers. 
  Take this one, for example: did you know that there has been 
a 95-percent turnover in the Criminal Investigation Department 
of the Moscow Oblast Internal Affairs Administration in the past 
year? That figure was cited by Mr. V. A. Sidorov, an 
administration employee, at a meeting of the oblast League of 
Retail and Wholesale Entrepreneurs. Mr. Sidorov attempted to 
blame this wholesale departure of professionals on the low pay 
scale. I must object. 
  Firstly, insofar as I am aware, even the lowest pay grade 
for 
a militia employee is higher than average pay in Russia. Things 
are hard for everybody, except for a few. 
  Secondly, financial difficulties are not enough to make a 
true professional consider changing jobs. In my conversations 
with former MVD employees they have cited reasons relating to 
morale, not financial reasons (see: "Honest People on the Night 
Train" in RABOCHAYA TRIBUNA, 20 November 1993). A militia major 
of my acquaintance left criminal investigation out of fear for 
his own life when he learned that an information about an 
operational plan he discussed behind closed doors with his 
bosses reached criminals the very same day. 
  Even someone who is not a professional can understand that a 
95-percent turnover in the criminal investigation staff hampers 
active and effective crimefighting efforts. 
  A poll taken by the Moscow Oblast League of Retail and 
Wholesale Entrepreneurs among its members before this 
information was made public indicated that only 13 percent of 
them expect help from the authorities when they encounter 
criminal structures. 
  The most risky type of business activity was trade 
(indicated 
by 82 percent of those surveyed), with banking in second place 
(77 percent), followed by services (16 percent). Only 5 percent 
of manufacturers are subjected to criminal pressure. That fact 
is easy to explain: no one is making big money in manufacturing 
nowadays -- people who are involved in it are barely making ends 
meet. 
  Virtually all power structures are now affected by 
corruption. According to figures from the same poll, 60 percent 
of entrepreneurs had encountered bribery among public officials, 
and 71 percent said the same of the militia. For the procuracy, 
tax inspectorate and state trade inspectorate the figure was 51 
percent, and for banks -- 47 percent. 
  Once again, these figures come as no surprise -- 
legitimation 
of graft began with Gavriil Popov back at the height of 
"perestroyka," when he stated that a bribe is merely an 
"expression of gratitude to an official for a job well done." On 
the contrary: reported cases of bribery, now a rarity, are used 
by the authorities solely for the purpose of getting rid of 
undesirable political opponents. 
  When they have to protect their interests, more than half of 
the entrepreneurs prefer not to go to the agencies that are 
supposed to protect those interests (76 percent do not believe 
the militia, 79 percent mistrust the former KGB, and 92 percent, 
the office of the public prosecutor); instead they enter into 
illegal contracts with criminal structures. Modern racketeers 
never impose impossible terms, as they are well aware of their 
own interest in keeping a businessman's business profitable. 
Instead one finds the excesses among bureaucrats in the "law 
enforcement" structures, whose appetite becomes more insatiable 
with each passing day. 
  Meanwhile the taxes that should supposedly ensure your 
safety 
and mine continue to rise. Recently the minister of internal 
affairs publicly announced an anti-crime program that he had 
drawn up and submitted to the President. A secret program, I 
should note. That means that if it is adopted there will be no 
accountability requirement in connection with its 
implementation, since you and I do not have a "need to know" 
what it contains. 
  I would like to direct particular attention to the fact that 
the minister has requested R2 billion [rubles] to carry out the 
program, and that the government has already included this 
funding in the budget. According to estimates by independent 
experts, the actual amount, not counting inflation, would 
already exceed that amount by a factor of nine. Considering the 
program's goals and the amount of taxes collected, even R18 
billion is not a lot. That is to say, once again what we have is 
an empty declaration that does not pursue the objective of 
achieving real results in the fight against crime. 
  The conclusion drawn from the figures that our editorial 
staff has available is depressingly simple: your safety and mine 
is in our own hands. Should we band together to protect 
ourselves? Should we move about the streets in groups? Or should 
we think about getting a new government? The choice is ours...

<F P=106> [Interview with Dmitriy Bednyakov, mayor of Nizhniy </F>
Novgorod, by Yuriy Kozlov; place and date not given: "The 
Inverted Triangle of Authority"] 
  [Text] Mayor of Nizhniy Novgorod Dmitriy Bednyakov on 
local self-government, on his dispute with Boris Nemtsov, on the 
situation in GAZ [Gorkiy Automobile Plant], and on the 
socioeconomic policy of the city administration. 
  Dmitriy Bednyakov, 42 years old. A lawyer. Candidate of 
Juridical Sciences. In 1991, the session of deputies of the 
Nizhniy Novgorod City Soviet did not approve his candidacy for 
the post of head of the city administration. He was appointed 
acting head of administration by an edict of President of the 
Russian Federation B. Yeltsin. A year later, in February 1993, 
after an account about his activity, he received the absolute 
support of the deputies of the city soviet (105 votes out of 138 
who voted). 
  [Begin boxed item] 
  From the program of Dmitriy Ivanovich Bednyakov, candidate 
for the post of head of local self-government of the city of 
Nizhniy Novgorod 
  --social support of every Nizhniy Novgorod family, 
especially 
those with many children, and assistance to invalids and to the 
aged; 
  --support of programs for the development of education and 
health services; 
  --fight against crime; 
  --support of Nizhniy Novgorod enterprises and entrepreneurs; 
  --limiting local taxes and allocating tax benefits; 
  --reduction of the bureaucratic apparatus and cuts in 
expenditures on administration. 
  [End boxed item] 
  [Kozlov] Dmitriy Ivanovich, in your opinion, what brought on 
the need for elections of the head of local self-government of 
Nizhniy Novgorod? 
  [Bednyakov] Strange as it may seem, it is most of all 
associated with the adoption of the new Constitution. It 
provides for the rather independent existence of local 
self-government. Article 12 states explicitly that local 
self-government is not part of the system of organs of state 
authority. And this is the main reason for today's and future 
disputes that arise between organs of state authority of 
components of the Federation and local self-government. I would 
express the gist of the dispute in this way: Will there be or 
will there not be local self-government? Today, many governors 
and managers of executive authority of the Federation conduct 
themselves with respect to local self-government in 
approximately the same way that the center conducted itself two 
or three years ago with respect to the components of the 
Federation. Having received authority, they, with passionate 
force, do not want to part with it, although the Constitution 
does proclaim the independence of local self-government. But in 
fact, the governors do not need this independence, and they are 
resisting it as much as they can. They want the heads of local 
administrations to be appointed and not to be elected. 
Unfortunately, the president's administration often shares this 
point of view, although it also does not hinder elections where 
they are already designated. 
  [Kozlov] That is, the issue is not to let local 
self-government break away from organs of state authority of the 
components of the Federation? 
  [Bednyakov] Let us imagine, for example, two pillars: 
legislative authority and executive authority. If vacillations 
began at a high level, they were passed on down these pillars to 
the lowest level, to the rural soviets. Local self-government 
today seems to support the pedestal of both pillars. At the 
level of local self-government, legislative and executive, and I 
think in the near future the judicial functions as well, will 
merge and unite--we will also come to Justices of the Peace. In 
my opinion, the matter stands like this: The "pedestal"--local 
self-government--will get stronger, and stability and order will 
become firmly established. Vacillations at the upper level will 
stop influencing the life of every citizen in the country. 
Today, unfortunately, many managers of the components of the 
Federation do not understand this, and they simply do not want 
to share authority. 
  [Kozlov] Probably, not so much executive as much as 
budgetary 
and financial authority? 
  [Bednyakov] We analyzed the budgetary relations of the city. 
Interesting details were ascertained: In fact, the oblast budget 
was almost always equal to the consolidated budget of the city. 
But in the three last years, a trend in the sharp growth of the 
oblast budget and a reduction in the city budget have been 
noted. We are collecting more than 50 percent of the taxes that 
make up the budget of the oblast. Less than 20 percent remains 
with us. Virtually all financial resources are concentrated at 
the level of components of the Federation, but local 
self-government depends fully on representatives of executive 
authority. It is necessary to go and ask on every occasion. This 
is by no means a Nizhniy Novgorod dispute, but, if you like, an 
all-Russian dispute. 
  [Kozlov] This means not only "to fight or not to fight," but 
also "to be or not to be" for local self-government in Russia? 
  [Bednyakov] In order "to be," it is necessary, first, that 
both the representative organ and the head of local 
self-government absolutely be elected by the people. Second, it 
is necessary to set up an appropriate legislative base. Only in 
such a case will an elected person receive a vote of confidence 
from the people and depend less on who appointed him, even if it 
is the president himself. 
  [Kozlov] Under what circumstances did you become mayor of 
Nizhniy Novgorod? Over the course of two years, what did you 
think was fundamental in your work? And what did you succeed in 
doing? 
  [Bednyakov] I did not plan to become mayor. I collaborated 
as 
an expert and a consultant with the Supreme Soviet for two 
years--in committees on legislation, and on questions of 
legality, economic reforms, and property. I took part in the 
development of laws on privatization, foreign investments, 
enterprises, stock market funds, and many others. I became 
acquainted with Boris Nemtsov there. When the question on his 
appointment as governor was decided, he suggested that I become 
mayor. I refused for a long time, because I was planning to 
engage in science in an earnest way. I had published more than 
40 publications, I was a candidate of juridical sciences and a 
docent, and a monograph appeared in the publication 
YURIDICHESKAYA LITERATURA. I planned in March 1992 to defend my 
doctoral dissertation, but Mr. Governor persuaded me. As of this 
date, we have departed substantially from totalitarian 
economics, and from a totalitarian state. Since we are talking 
about the economy, then it is already mixed in Nizhniy Novgorod, 
and in some sectors--trade and public catering--with a 
predominance of private capital. It is also possible to talk 
about elements of a democratic, civic society. What did we 
succeed in doing? First, to form a city administration team that 
worked on the resolution of city problems "not for the sake of 
personal profit." It was possible to achieve a certain stability 
in the work of the city economy and transport. Nizhniy Novgorod 
has one of the lowest rates of decline in production in Russia. 
Our entrepreneurship is fairly well developed. Finally, we 
succeeded in establishing a rather effectively acting mechanism 
of social protection of the poor. Although we are only at the 
beginning of the road. I do not like such words as the 
"Nizhniy Novgorod experiment," the "training ground," and so 
forth. We have always acted independently and in the interests 
of the residents of our city. But the main result of my 
"mayoralty" is that a definite reserve of stability for the 
future has been established. 
  [Kozlov] Both you and Boris Nemtsov are known in Russia, and 
even beyond its boundaries, as staunch reformers and organizers 
of the famous Nizhniy Novgorod "economic miracle." An article 
appeared in the press recently that indicates that differences 
have arisen between you. What is the gist of these differences? 
Are they associated with the forthcoming elections for mayor in 
Nizhniy Novgorod? 
  [Bednyakov] This is not an easy question for me. We do not 
have any fundamental differences regarding how to reform the 
economy. But it turned out that on the threshold of the 
elections, Governor Boris Nemtsov is not supporting me, but 
another person. I thought for a long time about the reasons for 
this behavior of the governor, and I came to the conclusion that 
there are two reasons. First: I told the governor too often 
about the mistakes he made and is making. Let us put it this 
way--he got sick of this. Although as a physicist, he should 
know that you can only be supported by that which offers 
resistance. It is impossible to lean on anything that does not 
offer resistance. The second reason, apparently, is that I 
consistently defended the interests of the city. Moreover, it is 
not so much a question of the redistribution of power as it is 
very simple things. If I am charged with appropriate functions 
and duties, this means I should receive the necessary amount of 
authorities and resources in order to fulfill them. There are 
laws on the status of judges, on the militia, and on the 
protection of the rights of servicemen. It is written there that 
I am obliged in the course of six months to give an apartment, 
install a telephone, set up their children in kindergartens, and 
so forth. When I say: Give me the money for this, they reply: 
You will get by! And I am left one on one with infuriated 
people.... I will never resign myself to such an understanding 
of authority--on the one hand, to control everything and, on the 
other hand, not to be responsible for anything. We seem to be 
dealing here with an inverted triangle. With its point, that is, 
with a real capability to resolve society's social problems, it 
is aimed downward. At the same time, from the standpoint of 
control and the capability to distribute financial and various 
resources of these sides, it is aimed endlessly upward. There is 
this concept of "city-forming enterprises." Previously, they 
were financed from the budget. Of the allocated resources, 20-30 
percent went for the development of the city infrastructure. All 
of this ended in 1990. According to our calculations, Nizhniy 
Novgorod city enterprises received R900 billion less than was 
due. And, meanwhile, city infrastructures are becoming 
dilapidated. We are not being given any money. People come to us 
because of housing, the roof is leaking, the heating system does 
not work.... The most difficult for me is when I have to refuse. 
I am told: Lie, promise more. I cannot. 
  [Kozlov] In what way does your preelection program differ 
from the program of the other candidate? 
  [Bednyakov] Sociologists claim that 80 percent of a 
preelection campaign should be built on lies and promises. Thus, 
Mr. Krestyaninov--my rival--claims that the problem of 
dilapidated housing can be resolved in two years. There are 
7,000 dilapidated homes in the city. Can this problem really be 
solved in two years? This is how our programs differ. My program 
is a critical analysis of what has been done and a specific 
direction for the city's development in the future. His program 
is hare-brained schemes and promises. I am for a Nizhniy 
Novgorod self-government charter, in which individual rights 
would be strengthened. Krestyaninov is opposed. He wants from 
the beginning to adopt a charter for Nizhniy Novgorod Oblast in 
which city "freedoms" would be limited appreciably and 
subordinated to oblast executive authority. I am for a strong 
city. Then there will also be a strong oblast. He wants to 
reduce the significance of the city. 
  [Kozlov] In your opinion, is the situation at the Gorkiy 
Automobile Plant changing for the better or for the worse? How 
was the dispute resolved between Boris Nemtsov and Vidyayev, 
director of the automobile plant, in which both the president 
and the chairman of the government took part? 
  [Bednyakov] There is a rather severe, and I would say 
unprecedented, directive of the government, signed by 
Chernomyrdin. Nemtsov has two claims against the automobile 
plant. First: He says that there was a blunder in foreign 
investments. So, a new director will come--Pugin--and then.... I 
think this is an illusion. Foreigners will not invest in the 
Russian automobile plant. They do not need competitors. Indeed, 
they are not in much of a hurry with investments in general. The 
second claim is that Vidyayev is managing the plant poorly. 
Pugin will manage better. However, the plant not only has not 
come to a stop, but it is even increasing the volume of 
production. By comparison with 1992, the increase in passenger 
cars totaled 26 percent! The automobile plant is kept under 
strict executive discipline. If you now begin to reform it 
drastically, introduce new methods of management, and so on, it 
could fall apart and come to a halt. But the Gorkiy Automobile 
Plant is the heart of the city and the oblast. I am afraid that, 
with the arrival there of a new person who is not burdened by 
any kind of obligations to the plant collective, the entire 
plant social sphere will be instantly sloughed off on the city 
budget. And this is 30-40 percent of all of the housing! The 
plant now independently maintains its own social infrastructure. 
In the meantime, preparations are under way to collect 
stockholders. Incidentally, the situation with vouchers, which 
the managers of the plant allegedly accumulated for money 
allocated from the budget, is not really that simple. They claim 
that they bought the vouchers for resources earned owing to the 
additional output of passenger cars. The results of the check 
auction have not been canceled. An annual balance will be 
conducted at the end of March, and everything will become clear 
then. 
  [Kozlov] The city charter, in whose development you 
participated directly, will be submitted in a referendum 
simultaneously with the election to mayor. What will the charter 
give to the people of Nizhniy Novgorod? 
  [Bednyakov] The charter is the springboard around which the 
policy of the city authorities will be formed--it is the 
legislative base. The charter describes who can do what, what 
cannot be done by someone, and what rights citizens have. For 
example, it states there: "Citizens have the right to collective 
petitions and appeals. Citizens have the right to attend any 
meetings of the organs of local self-government. Citizens have 
the right to be heard out by any official." This is a charter 
that restricts the arbitrariness of officials and protects the 
rights of ordinary citizens. We want to print it for wide 
circulation, so that it would be in every apartment, and so that 
people not only know, but also would be able to defend their own 
rights. 
  [Kozlov] Dmitriy Ivanovich, in your opinion, what is now 
determining the political and economic situation in the country? 
Which way is Russia moving--toward confrontation or 
stabilization? 
  [Bednyakov] I think that a repetition of the events of 
October of last year is not likely. The people are tired of 
politics and will hardly actively support any one of the 
disputing parties. There are fewer and fewer reasons today for 
upheavals in society. People's expectations are associated not 
so much with the possible actions of the authorities as with 
specific matters--theirs and those close to them. And this is 
the beginning of stabilization. People are beginning to realize 
that their fate is in their own hands and that they are able to 
improve their life. And if life is changing for the better, no 
one needs any upheavals.

<F P=106> [Article by Vladimir Noskov: "Elections '94: A Billion and a </F>
Half Split Three Ways"; commentary by Valentin Loginov] 
  [Text] Ancient and once tranquil Nizhniy Novgorod was quite 
unlike itself in February and March -- all because of the 
mayoral election campaign. 
  At first everything seemed to go "according to plan." The 
other candidates for mayor besides incumbent D. Bednyakov were 
two of the city's well-known individuals, Ye. Krestyaninov and 
O. Maslov. True, the latter dropped out during the registration 
period "due to an insufficient number of voter signatures for 
nomination." 
  However, the two remaining candidates have waged such a 
campaign that the citizens of Nizhniy Novgorod have begun 
following it just like they do events on the shows "Santa 
Barbara" and "Simply Maria." The election campaign gets daily 
coverage on the two local television channels. 
  The two candidates were allies until just recently. Together 
with the governor they discussed and decided all the key issues 
in the life of Nizhniy Novgorod's citizens. But then at some 
point (exactly when remains a mystery to a majority of the 
city's population to this day) their relations went sour. Worse 
yet, B. Nemtsov, abusing his official position and violating his 
own "democratic principles," set out to "dump" Dmitriy 
Bednyakov, his former protege. Now he likes Ye. Krestyaninov 
better. Nor did the governor make any secret of his sympathies. 
Higher-level authorities pointed out to B. Nemtsov that he was 
in violation of legislation when he campaigned in favor of 
Yevgeniy Krestyaninov. Supposedly the governor should remain 
neutral in election campaigns. 
  However, last Friday evening, just two days before the 
election, in a speech broadcast on local television the governor 
gave the people a de facto ultimatum: do not elect 
Krestyaninov, or bad things would happen to the city. That same 
evening Bednyakov stated on a different television channel that 
under pressure from the governor he had been forced to withdraw 
the "city charter" from a referendum which was supposed to take 
place simultaneously with the mayoral election. He also issued 
an invitation to independent observers to oversee the election. 
  The next thing that happened was completely unexpected. At 
around midnight Yevgeniy Krestyaninov showed up at the 
television studio and announced that he was withdrawing his 
candidacy. And under the election statute that could mean only 
one thing: no mayoral election could be held. 
  The next day, on Saturday, people waited to hear local radio 
and television reports announcing that the governor and the two 
candidates had come to some sort of agreement. Yet nothing 
changed. The result is that the election was not held. 
Approximately a billion and a half rubles of budget funds had 
been spent for nothing. And that despite loud talk --broadcast 
around the world -- of "new democratic principles in local 
government..." 
<H5>  Our Commentary </H5>
  Never before have the people of Russia seemed so passive 
with 
regard to their voting rights as in the course of elections to 
local representative bodies that began late last year. Voter 
turnout hit a "record" low at about one-third of eligible 
voters. Yet there were seemingly innumerable okrugs, rayons and 
cities where the numerous candidates for deputies' seats were 
not able to get even 25 percent of voters to turn out on their 
first attempt. As you will recall, that kind of "massive" 
turnout is now sufficient to constitute a legal election. 
  Last Sunday elections were held in approximately 30 regions. 
This does not include areas where a runoff election was 
scheduled. The final results of this latest stage in the 
sluggish campaign, enlivened only by scandalous events of the 
sort that occurred in Nizhniy Novgorod, may become available in 
a day or two or, most likely, at the end of the week. But 
judging by fragmentary preliminary information received from a 
number of regions, the voters were once again none too eager to 
perform their civic duty. For example, nine districts in Nizhniy 
Novgorod will have to hold runoff elections for local Duma 
seats. In Ryazan only one candidate for deputy out of 14 was 
elected, and in Novgorod no Duma election was held at all in one 
out of eight districts. Voter turnout in three Bryansk districts 
ranged from 18.5 to 22.2 percent... Good grief, should we just 
start over? Oh, Moscow, give us a few more billions! 
  From the Russian Federation Central Election Committee and 
structures close to the president there have been complaints 
that local elections are just taking place spontaneously, 
without any sort of "sponsorship" on the part of federal 
authorities. Supposedly if the latter were to "get involved" the 
outcome would be different. It is also supposedly time to 
finally approve a whole series of laws, one of the most 
important of which would pertain to fundamental guarantees of 
citizens' voting rights and... financial support for election 
campaigns. 
  But citizens are sick and tired of these "democracy games" 
in 
which they are supposed to play the role of spectators. A 
majority of citizens see no benefit whatsoever in all these 
expensive elections, referendums, polls, etc., which threaten to 
become endless. Therefore they are in no hurry to get out and 
vote... It would seem that this is clear to everyone by now. 
Unfortunately, everyone has not yet realized who does in fact 
benefit from all THIS. Who is it? Just the bureaucrats and 
administrators who are gathering more and more local power into 
their hands. And perhaps some bureaucrats higher up as well? 
Think about it, voters. Think!

<F P=106> [Article by Rustam Arifdzhanov and Anatoliy Yershov: "Reform </F>
Fair: Nizhegorod Alternatives"] 
  [Text] Nizhniy Novgorod-Moscow--There were always 
things to see in Nizhniy Novgorod. Its own kremlin. The 
spit--the confluence of the waters of the Volga and the Oka. The 
old merchant houses. The fair itself--it was in Nizhniy in the 
past that the all-Russia price of grain and salt and the 
European price of tea were established. There was little 
admiration for Nizhniy in the recent past. A closed city, 
"off-limits." Now the Volga city is not being denied attention 
by business people, despite the stinging prices of the hotels, 
trains, airplanes, and public and private catering outlets--they 
are coming to see the reforms. And the city, knowing what makes 
it attractive, is trying to put itself on display. There is 
already a whole reform fair here--noisy, shrill, 
venturesome--but beneath the clamor and sham gaiety--business is 
getting done, the bargaining proceeds. 
<H5>  Money Purse or Head </H5>
  The economic guide in Nizhniy currently is the round-faced 
man of Vyatka, Vladimir Yefremov, deputy leader of the 
Department of Economics and Forecasting. A student of Aganbegyan 
and a professor who acquired his black gown in the city of 
Springfield, Massachusetts. Only there is no way he could be 
called a "Chicago boy," although he is the coeval of the 
reformers of Gaydar's team. A "Springfield man," rather. 
  The style of all the reforms here is, according to local 
governor Boris Nemtsov, "a mixture of Nizhegorod and 
Anglo-Saxon." Yefremov, who turned down a monthly salary of 
$10,000 in the States and who was summoned here after Yavlinskiy 
to continue the reforms, could not be better suited to this 
style, just as he could not be better suited to today's 
post-Gaydar government policy. 
  This is the generation of 30- to 40-year-old conservatives, 
as we understand it here, which was pushed back by the Moscow 
reformer-liberals, but which is now gaining strength and finding 
its voice to the affable approbatory smiles of the "good old 
types"--from the directors through the prime minister. One of 
their main slogans: We should not be reinventing the wheel. We 
had everything. What we needed to do was fix, but we broke. They 
call themselves marketeers, but commonsensical. 
  The proposition is this: Property in Sweden is still 50 
percent state-owned, and the state manages this property. We had 
this experience of management also. According to Yefremov, you 
can purchase a brochure containing a plan of the state's 
development for the year at a newsstand in any state in America. 
We had an excellent planning system. It was not preserved. Yes, 
it was excessively detailed, but it merely needed enlarging, yet 
we threw out everything. According to the principle: All or 
nothing. 
  Yefremov's principles are shorn of details. Freeze energy 
prices and rail tariffs. Introduce a fixed currency exchange 
rate. "It is impossible to imagine that our economy is 1,700 and 
more times weaker than the American economy" (quotation). The 
distortion of pricing is obvious. And, of course, revise the tax 
system. Not collecting from profits, say, but for land. World 
practice: As soon as the sum total of taxes exceeds 35 percent, 
entrepreneurial activity winds down. With us 4-7 kopeks are left 
for development from R1 of profit in light industry, for example. 
  Inflation is not, of course, to be feared. In Brazil it 
reached an annual 1,800 percent--and was overcome. In Germany 
after the war, 1,300 percent--and it was endured.... 
  Nizhniy Novgorod was in recent times always in some 
opposition to Gaydar's reforms. Yavlinskiy spent six months on 
the building of a capitalism with its own character here, in the 
military-industrial Volga citadel. Yefremov is not as famous as 
the author of the "Nizhegorod EPIlog" program, but he is a 
manifest antimonetarist. "Good old types" are his favorite words. 
  "I could be saying something that is faintly ridiculous 
here, 
but sensible types will understand. Moscow has always been 
Russia's head, Petersburg, its heart. Nizhniy, its pocket, its 
money purse. Why not combine head and purse. Take Yeltsin, ours 
is a popularly elected president, and Chernomyrdin also, a 
sensible type, it would seem, and bring them here to us, to the 
Kremlin. Let them work here. And the servants, the entourage, 
all these bureaucrats mired in intrigues and the devil knows 
what all else, leave them in Moscow. Many states have only 
benefited from a change of capital...." 
  Generally speaking--a fair! 
<H5>  The Algorithm Is Regulated Common Sense </H5>
  Money purse is putting it somewhat strongly, of course. The 
assets of all Nizhegorod's banks do not amount to R40 billion. 
Receipts from small and medium-sized business--R30 billion. Not 
that much. But Nizhegorod's aim is to maintain the social 
protection of the population and average wages at a level 10-15 
percent higher than in the adjacent oblasts. "By uncovering 
local potential." Nizhegorod people love at odd moments to reach 
for their purses, emphasizing that they live in an area of high 
population solvency. There is money to spend. There are, 
accordingly, things to buy. Commodities do not leave but enter 
the region. Neighbors, understandably, complain: "You are 
sucking up everything like a vacuum cleaner." 
  In terms of level of development Nizhegorod Oblast is 
approximately on a par with Ulyanovsk Oblast. Only the 
approaches are different. The Nizhegoroders are constantly 
raising the social plank of protection of the populace--they are 
paying more--from their budget. In terms of price 
liberalization, on the other hand, they are in first place in 
Russia, just about. Merchandise is more expensive. In Ulyanovsk, 
on the other hand, it is subsidized. Prices and wages are lower. 
It is believed in Nizhniy Novgorod that sooner or later the 
Ulyanovsk policy will bring about a landslide and a social 
explosion which will sweep all away there. 
  The Nizhegorod algorithm, once again as they themselves 
claim, is regulated common sense. Russia, they believe, does not 
have enough of this. And the continuity, not the darting here 
and there, and stability of the decisions that are made. 
  ...Two Japanese professors came to Nizhniy. Also to study 
the 
reforms--the level of decisionmaking, competence, and so forth. 
And the Japanese reiterated a truth we ourselves know full well: 
Russians could manage 250 kg in the clean and jerk--as distinct 
from us. But 10 kg each day--this is tedious and difficult. 
  The Nizhegorod reform is undoubtedly Russian in spirit. 
Closer, that is, to a clean and jerk than actual weight-lifting. 
Regulated common sense suggests to Governor Nemtsov that gradual 
work is by its gradualness imperceptible. And here--the fair! 
The merchandise must be colorful. Otherwise, it will not be 
purchased. Moscow must notice and evaluate what is happening in 
Nizhniy, otherwise it will not provide any money. It is with 
them, after all, only the purse that is of local workmanship, 
the money in it comes from Moscow. Or that which is their own, 
but which has to be given to Moscow in the form of taxes, so 
that this, you have to reckon, is "Moscow's" also. 
  In principle, the entire Soviet time Gorkiy Oblast lived on 
money obtained from the center. Enterprises of the 
military-industrial complex comprise the oblast's main 
industrial potential. The sovereign's domain. Even now Governor 
Nemtsov is free from Moscow in his actions only in respect to 
the money that remains in the oblast budget. Fifty percent means 
a half-baked freedom. Less means even less freedom. So it is 
everywhere, for that matter. He could be reconciled to this. 
What is he governor for? To convey to his parts the will of the 
center and to watch to ensure that it is executed and to 
unswervingly execute it himself. But freedom is a sweet-sounding 
word. And he wishes to press the weight.... 
  ...There is a fable in Nizhniy Novgorod to the effect that 
Nemtsov and Yavlinskiy are bosom pals. This is hardly the case. 
A tremendous distance separated the radiophysicist who broke 
into big politics in an antinuclear (against the building of a 
nuclear power station) demonstration movement and the deputy 
chairman of Silayev's Council of Ministers. But Nemtsov, the 
deputy of the Russian Parliament, was striking on account of his 
youth, energy, and talent. In August 1991 he stood alongside 
Yeltsin, and the photo made the rounds of the world's press. 
Alongside the vigorous president, a young man in an unusually 
fashionable long coat. Tall, a curly mop of hair, and a flashing 
smile. A leader out of the ordinary for the Soviet image. In 
that, now absolved, August it was Nemtsov, it is rumored, who 
was sent by the president to negotiate with the Taman Division. 
He did so. The Taman Division did not support the putschists. 
Nemtsov was appointed presidential governor-general in Nizhniy, 
and then became head of the administration. The first session of 
the oblast soviet decreed his glorification as governor. 
  Even in this there was a certain challenge to tradition. But 
common sense suggested to Nemtsov that this was necessary. 
<H5>  The Best Opposition to the Reformers--Our Own Reforms </H5>
  By virtue of his age (he is now 35), love of experimentation 
(the radiophysicist), and ineradicable desire to be in the 
public eye, Nemtsov was made for reforms. But not to execute 
someone else's, to implement his own. He lacked, naturally, 
economic knowledge. Shopfloor experience also. There was no room 
in Gaydar's team. As there was no place in it for another 
reformer--Grigoriy Yavlinskiy, who is very similar to Nemtsov 
not only in mentality ("500 Days"--was this not a clean and 
jerk?) but, take a closer look, even outwardly. The former 
deputy chairman, who had gone unclaimed by Moscow, would go to 
Nizhniy. Unrecognized by that same "Gaydarite"-replenished 
Moscow, Nemtsov invited him to devise a particular Nizhegorod 
model. 
  The model incorporated traits of their characters and the 
qualities of the strata on which the "provincial reformers" 
relied. Dislike of the haughty capital. Dislike of the 
monetarists. Dislike of daily routine.... 
  The fair is a state of mind. 
  Nemtsov, Yavlinskiy, and three local leaders--Krestyaninov, 
chairman of the oblast soviet, Bednyakov, mayor of the city, and 
Kosarikov, chairman of the city soviet--constituted Nizhniy 
Novgorod's "top five." Officially they called themselves the 
Coordinating Council, the people joked: "our Politburo." 
  The Coordinating Council met daily--for a couple of hours in 
the afternoon. The practice of urgent decisions of the governor 
was verified by the theory of specialists of the EPICenter, who 
had moved for the time being to a Nizhegorod country cottage. 
Yavlinskiy's theoretical computations were put into practice. 
  Among the most striking experiments has been the 
privatization of truck transportation. One was immediately 
struck on the oblast's roads--before the introduction of new 
license plates--by the unusually large number of trucks with 
private numbers. Small-scale and medium-sized privatization was 
carried through relatively quickly and successfully. We, a 
native Nizhegoroder and a guest from Moscow, are even today 
struck by the particular "capital" schooling of the local 
waiters and the interiors of the private cafes and restaurants. 
  The turn in the "food pipeline" in the direction of Nizhniy 
Novgorod is one of the main achievements of the local reforms. 
As also the fact that, despite the reduction in jobs at 
industrial enterprises, there is not a strong growth of 
unemployment. People are finding jobs in services and private 
business. 
  And also, of course, foreigners--initially simply the 
curious, then specialists--followed one another to Nizhniy 
Novgorod in the wake of Yavlinskiy--an economist of world 
renown. A newspaper in English, NIZHNIY NOVGOROD TIMES, was even 
started up in the city. There is the demand for it. 
  And it transpired that money for the local reforms could be 
sought not only in Moscow but in the capitals of other, more 
developed states also--the States, Great Britain. The Nizhegorod 
model of privatization of the sovkhozes and kolkhozes took a 
year of work and $2 million. Specialists of the International 
Finance Corporation headed by the American Anthony Doran worked 
without compensation practically, more, "at their own expense." 
We have already expounded the model in IZVESTIYA. The land and 
the assets are divided into shares, which each member of the 
farm receives, the retiree included, and he then puts them up at 
public auctions--land and property. At the last auction, two 
weeks ago, Chernomyrdin, together with all three of his 
deputies, was in attendance. Nemtsov was nervous, but ultimately 
got the result he wanted. The prime minister liked the 
experiment so much that he declared: "Prepare the proposals. We 
will support them." 
  The support will, most likely, appear as follows. The 
Nizhegorod model will form the basis of a national program of 
privatization in the countryside. This is tremendous moral 
satisfaction for the local reformers. The Nizhegorod people will 
receive money for continuation of the experiment--material 
satisfaction. And the money will, naturally, come, what is more, 
from the same bag on which the "agro-industrial complex" has 
already been raised. Some amounts from the trillions extorted by 
Zaveryukha will go to Nizhniy Novgorod. The Volga people may be 
congratulated on a successful trade. Reforms are a commodity 
like anything else: Sold successfully, they bring in money.... 
  Things are more difficult with industry. Collapse. 
Nonpayments crisis. Lack of investments. Nemtsov would look 
ridiculous if, like everyone else, he went to Chernomyrdin and 
pestered with him with his requests: "Give us money, Viktor 
Stepanovich." This is what everyone is doing. Nemtsov the 
reformer is asking for investment tax credit. There is no need 
for money. Permit for some period of time some of the taxes paid 
into federal coffers to remain in the oblast coffers. We already 
have an Industry Support Fund based on local commercial banks 
and local taxes, and the priority sectors of the economy have 
been determined here. Let us give it a try. We are sure that we 
will give industry a lift. Chernomyrdin fell to thinking. It 
seemed to us that the idea pleases him more than it irritates 
him. 
  Nemtsov is going further. The Ministry of Defense has run up 
debts to local enterprises of the military-industrial complex 
and has nothing with which to settle accounts. Let us, then, 
introduce bills of exchange. We have run up debts to the power 
engineers? Let us with the YeES Rossiya stock company introduce 
paper-credit relations. And they are being introduced. Is it not 
under the influence of the Nizhegorod people that Chernomyrdin 
also is talking more and more about the bill of exchange as a 
lifesaver in the sea of the general nonpayments crisis. 
  Nemtsov has quite a complex relationship with the 
industrialists. Initially the "red directors"--the main Russian 
power--greeted the young governor with ironical grins. The 
director of the GAZ, one of the Russian motor kings, said behind 
his back: "A boy, a young man, what does he know, what has he 
seen?" The directors were accustomed to the heavy tread of the 
first secretaries of the Gorkiy Oblast Party Committee. And to 
the fact that no one in the oblast would cross them. And here 
was Nemtsov--a nonclassical "boss".... 
  The dispute between the governor and Boris Vidyayev, the GAZ 
director, long ago went beyond oblast dimensions--the cause of a 
difficult struggle between the former "industrial activists," 
weakened without the "party" prefix, and the new authorities, 
which were becoming established. To the disagreements at the 
personality level--who likes to be called "boy"?--was added 
Vidyayev's management style: I am the No. 1 here, I will decide 
how the formation of a stock company is to proceed, I am the GAZ! 
  IZVESTIYA has already written about the nuances of the 
conflict, the machinations involving the purchase of stock at 
the plant, and the fact that the government has occupied an 
unequivocal position--to vote with the block of government 
shares for Vidyayev's removal. This, most likely, is what will 
happen on 8 April at the shareholders' general meeting. And then 
we can talk about the governor's next psychological victory. A 
lesson for the all-powerful directors. In addition, the local 
military-industrial complex has sensed Nemtsov's support, who is 
single-mindedly punching through for them permission for them to 
deal overseas in spares for the military product they 
manufacture. This will produce money. It will provide support on 
the world market. After all, things are becoming 
ridiculous--spares for our aircraft, say, are being manufactured 
and successfully traded by the French and the Germans. 
  A strong director reckons only with a strong individual. 
Nemtsov has established himself here. Not by indulging Moscow, 
not by toadying to it, but by outplaying it, out-bargaining it, 
as it were. 
  Nizhniy is a merchant city. 
<H5>  Third Capital </H5>
  Of course, Vladimir Yefremov's dreams of Nizhniy Novgorod's 
"capital" future are speculative. This will hardly happen. But 
the appearance of other capitals alongside Moscow and Petersburg 
on the map of Russia is an objective process. Vladivostok, 
Yekaterinburg, and Novosibirsk are increasingly becoming 
independent not by dint of their remoteness from the metropolis. 
Under the conditions of sufficient economic chaos, 
self-reliance, given a sufficiently subtle game with Moscow, is 
the healthiest style of behavior. This is working for Nemtsov 
better than the others. He has not become a hostage of local 
powerful clans and groupings, as in Vladivostok, and has been in 
no hurry to announce a Nizhegorod Republic in the style of the 
Urals people. The Nizhegorod blood of his forefathers has been 
stirred in the "Sochi city boy"--this is where Nemtsov's 
childhood was spent. Just try out-bargaining them. 
  But together with the smarts, the Volga people were always 
characterized by a certain provincial dreaminess. It is this 
that makes it possible to build far-reaching plans and to 
accomplish them with enviable doggedness. One cherished dream is 
the revival of the Nizhegorod Fair. A center of trade and, 
consequently, by no means of just the provinces. 
  The year of 1996 will be the centenary of the celebrated 
All-Russia Nizhegorod Fair. There are the following plans in 
this connection. Modernization of the airport. The organization 
of a high-speed Moscow-Nizhniy rail link. The building of a 
second block of the fair complex. World-class hotels. Permission 
for passage along the Volga of foreign ships. The construction 
of the new Yarmaka [Fair] Metro station. And a good deal more. 
  We spoke with one of Nemtsov's zealots, Vladimir Bessarab, 
director of the Nizhegorodskaya yarmaka Russian stock company, 
with a certain disbelief. But they are already building the 
second block. The main exhibition hall has been resurrected in 
all its splendor. Yarmaka recently won a prestigious prize--the 
Golden Arch--in Spain. And just two years ago Bessarab was 
staying as part of a threesome--with his secretary and 
accountant--in a cramped room of the local Rossiya Hotel. He got 
things going.... 
  An urge to reform is not always to the good, for that 
matter. 
Thus at the time of the general cash crisis it was intended in 
Nizhniy to introduce its own currency--it was christened 
"Yavlinki" at that time. This, fortunately, did not happen. At 
the present spring elections to the local authorities two of 
Nemtsov's closest associates--Krestyaninov and Bednyakov--from 
that "top five" left, not without his influence, to contest for 
the office of mayor. And although they disputed in entirely 
civilized fashion, without sharply worded attacks, the 
competitive struggle swept them onto different sides, all the 
same. Why, to what end? They would have been better together. 
  Nizhegoroders have just not understood the latest 
gubernatorial experiment. The fair style has its costs. It 
allows of noise, publicity excesses, and the theatricalized 
nature of operations. But it is not, after all, a fair for 
fair's sake. A fair for the sake of business. Supposing they 
overdo it--outplay primarily themselves. 
  And one further important point. Nizhniy Novgorod is not a 
proving ground for the development of an all-Union model. Not 
everyone can be authorized to trade in weapons. Not everyone can 
be permitted to retain for himself a large part of federal 
taxes. The experience of rural privatization, which has been 
introduced everywhere, could under different conditions hit the 
farmers hard. Nor in every city is it possible or necessary to 
organize an all-Russia fair. A Nizhniy striving to become the 
third capital is not an example to copy. Each has its own 
character and its own path. This is Nemtsov's and Nizhniy's path. 
  Nonetheless, people are coming to Nizhniy Novgorod from all 
over Russia. And to the named train "Volga"--from Moscow--there 
has been added another--"Yarmaka." But people are not coming for 
the reason that their ancestors hurried here. Not for butter and 
salt, drapery and timber. They are coming to view the reforms. 
And the old days are being revived. Nizhniy Novgorod is 
gradually dictating, as it did formerly with prices, style. 
Independent, but with a backward glance at Moscow. Reformist, 
but with regard to traditions and tenor of life. 
  Anthony Doran's American projects are combined here with the 
understanding of the peasants of the reform village of 
Kovrigino. What is wrong with this as the essence of our life?

<F P=106> [Article by Dmitriy Grafov under the rubric "Privatization": </F>
"Americans Failed To See Capitalism"] 
  [Text] Nizhniy Novgorod was selected as the 
exhibition and demonstration city. This was where foreign 
delegations and teams of journalists were taken to be vividly 
shown the "locomotive of privatization" with all its tenders, 
check auctions for pistons, and investment trading sessions for 
boilers. 
  However, a year later the American nonprofit organization 
Heritage Foundation published the results of its independent 
expert review of the operation of this "locomotive." The authors 
met with a number of entrepreneurs engaging in production and 
commercial operations and familiarized themselves directly with 
the operation of privatized enterprises and shops in the city. 
  The fact that large state enterprises try in every way 
possible to avoid the sale of their shares on the open market in 
the course of privatization was the first discovery the 
Americans made. The enterprises resort to reserving a 
considerable proportion of the stock for the management of the 
enterprise and distributing shares among the workers at symbolic 
prices, as well as transforming the most profitable state 
enterprises into privately held joint-stock companies. 
  A note of surprise can be felt in another observation: Large 
investors are buying state enterprises out of...state credit, 
although in civilized countries, the seed capital for such 
purchases is generated by the investors themselves through 
issuing their stock, before the credit is extended. Moreover, 
Russian officials extend credit in a somewhat suspect manner, 
"without appropriate security," being guided in the process by 
"motives far removed from those of a market economy" (what a 
cultured way to put it!). 
  Following a discourse about a shortage of capital for 
privatization, vouchers were faulted too. So far, this "measure 
has failed to produce real results and was a political rather 
than economic measure" called upon to mitigate social tensions, 
which is what some of us guessed long ago. Of course, a 
profitable and effective enterprise can be sold to its employees 
in the expectation that it will keep working just as smoothly. 
However, as the experience of the Americans indicated, the 
expectation that workers would work better on becoming owners 
has not been confirmed in reality. The management is not capable 
of managing the enterprise effectively, knowing that it may be 
fired at any moment by employees who are unhappy with the high 
requirements imposed on them. 
  The Americans encountered one eye-opener after another: 
Model 
samples of contracts between the management of enterprises and 
the former organ of property management as represented by the 
state or municipality are foisted on enterprises. The system of 
issuing licenses to operate becomes an additional source of 
pressure on privatized enterprises brought to bear by state 
structures. 
  The authors of the analytical review plunged into the thick 
of the entrepreneurial masses, unlike the small groups of 
Western experts who, it is noted with a measure of sarcasm, pay 
sporadic visits to Nizhniy Novgorod, where they spend a few days 
in consultation with representatives of the power structure. 
Glaring facts are stated with alarm: Producers pay value-added 
tax, although the goods may not have been purchased by 
consumers. Retroactive amendments to tax legislation compel the 
payment of taxes on operations which at the moment of their 
performance were not taxed. Any reporting by state officials on 
the disbursement of funds collected for a certain "highway fund" 
is absent. Although everyone to a man pays this strange tax, the 
condition of the roads in Nizhniy Novgorod remains poor. There 
have been no changes in the tax system conducive to 
privatization in Nizhniy Novgorod; on the contrary, a new tax 
for maintenance of the housing stock (1.5 percent) has been 
introduced. The discovery of the last "eye-opener" caused the 
altogether divine horror: The total of all taxes comes to 75-85 
percent, world practice pointing to no more than 35 percent. 
  The fact remains, the authors themselves stress, that 
privatization of state property is proceeding at a high rate, 
but "genuine" results have not been registered so far. Why? 
  I also visited a demonstration check auction together with 
one of the teams of journalists. At a cocktail party given by 
Western consultants I tormented several directors with this 
question--will "their" privatized enterprises operate 
"capitalist-style," i.e., in an effective and competitive 
manner? The captains of industry kept their enigmatic silence 
and smiled politely in response to the naive question. Their 
smiles betrayed the wisdom of life and the knowledge of 
something that was obvious to them but beyond me. The answer to 
this question also remains a mystery to the authors of the 
analytical review, although they did share their thinking on 
this account. 
  First, privatization is not carried out to find additional 
sources for replenishing the budget. Second (the hint is not as 
heavy but likewise understandable), with our type of 
privatization, some officials are getting an opportunity to 
pressure private investors (apparently, the Russian word 
"extortion" is meant), while other officials "who are privy to 
privatization" are getting a chance to "keep their positions in 
the economic sphere." At this point we would like to add that 
the "former" and the "latter" may be one and the same. 
  Third, it turns out that state structures that are burdened 
by debt strive to sell enterprises placed under their control at 
the highest possible prices to--oh horror!--foreigners. In turn, 
the foreigners have to pay not only the state but also directly 
the officials responsible for privatization. 
  Easy credit is necessary for the buyout of small trade, 
public catering, and consumer-service enterprises (oh holy 
simplicity!) instead of the endless discussion by the state 
authorities of the dilemma as to whether leased enterprises (for 
which leasing rights were purchased at auctions, to boot) are to 
be transferred to lessees as their property or not. 
  The authors observed that the model of providing Western 
assistance should be revised. The funds are used mainly to 
enrich the individuals engaging in their distribution; technical 
assistance boils down to organizing seminars abroad for the 
officials of state establishments. In an elegant bow, the 
authors hope that the issues raised in their analytical review 
will generate a discussion. We hope so too.

<F P=106> [Article by Dmitriy Gornostayev: "Test of Strength for </F>
Moscow-Washington Relations Seems To Have Been Conducted at 
Kozyrev-Christopher Meeting, Which Did Not, However, Produce Any 
Sensational News"] 
  [Text] Vladivostok and Moscow--Perhaps the most important 
thing about the Vladivostok meeting of Russian Foreign Minister 
Andrey Kozyrev and U.S. Secretary of State Warren Christopher is 
the very fact that meeting took place. For notwithstanding 
Moscow's and Washington's assertions to the contrary, their 
relations have recently begun to cool somewhat. The talks in the 
Far East were intended above all to give the sides an 
opportunity to explain their positions. 
  Andrey Kozyrev has compared the relationship between Russia 
and the United States to a marriage: "The honeymoon is over." 
And this is indeed the case. But problems that they didn't think 
about before, not even believing they existed, remain and have 
made themselves known. The first one is Russia's special opinion 
on air strikes in Bosnia. The events that followed--Vitaliy 
Churkin's successful talks, Russian Federation Boris Yeltsin's 
appeal, the dispatch of Russian troops to Sarajevo, in short, 
all the factors that proved the Russian policy's effectiveness 
and consequently Russia's diplomatic success--were hardly 
something the Americans liked very much. Then came the series of 
mutual disclosures of Russian and Western intelligence agents 
and ex-President Richard Nixon's conduct in Moscow, conduct that 
offended Yeltsin. In this way, minor frictions accumulated into 
an array of problems that simply had to be discussed. 
  Nevertheless, it is a good thing that the sides have a 
marriage contract--the Moscow Declaration, which the Russian and 
U.S. presidents signed at the conclusion of Bill Clinton's visit 
to Russia. The Russian and American foreign ministers used that 
declaration as the basis for their discussion of the entire 
agenda of Russian-American and international problems. That 
documents sets forth the principle that relations between Russia 
and the United States are to be given the character of a mature 
and equal partnership. And in Vladivostok Andrey Kozyrev 
emphasized the equality of the sides, with no junior or senior 
partners, leaders and led, superpowers and regional countries. 
  Of course, as major countries that in fact play a most 
crucial role in the world arena, the U.S. and the Russian 
Federation do have disagreements that the sides are trying to 
solve in different ways. Nevertheless, as Warren Christopher 
said, "we are bound by partnership." One condition of that 
partnership is constant consultations between the sides, and an 
agreement that such consultations will be held was reached in 
Vladivostok. 
  As an example of that equal partnership, Andrey Kozyrev 
cited 
an agreement reached in Vladivostok that Russian experts will 
take part in efforts to draw up a program on the problem of 
nonproliferation of nuclear weapons and missile technologies and 
on cooperation in the field of technologies, dubbing it a "new 
COCOM." In the first stage, Russian specialists will begin 
producing a draft in conjunction with the Americans, a draft 
that will not be based on anyone's unilateral proposal. 
Christopher, elaborating on that idea, stressed that "for the 
most part we are working together," although "depending on the 
issue, partnership can manifest itself in various forms." 
  True, Christopher gave a somewhat strange answer to a 
NEZAVISIMAYA GAZETA correspondent's question at a press 
conference at the conclusion of the Vladivostok meeting, saying 
that the spy problem had not been discussed at all at the 
meeting. It is strange because, for one thing, before leaving 
for Vladivostok Kozyrev said that "spy passions" will be a focus 
of the talks, along with other glitches, among which he included 
the scandal-ridden Nixon visit. Second, both foreign ministers 
said that Russian-American relations "had been subjected to 
serious tests." One of those tests--at any rate, one visible to 
the naked eye--is the series of disclosures that began with the 
Aldrich Ames affair. 
  The cooling in relations between Moscow and Washington that 
both are dismissing at the official level was manifested 
primarily in the reciprocal disclosures of intelligence agents. 
Christopher and Kozyrev say that resolving this situation lies 
outside their competence. One can agree with this when the issue 
is one of agents' working failures. But when the scandal is blow 
up to all but international proportions, statements by the 
foreign ministers could play a positive role. For the resolution 
of military conflicts cannot be left to the sole competence of 
defense ministers. 
  More serious issues that Kozyrev and Christopher discussed 
had to do with international problems, not bilateral matters. 
Kozyrev briefed his colleague on his recent trip to Tunis and 
Tel-Aviv, telling him that both sides--the PLO and Israel--had 
shown a readiness to continue talks. As for Bosnia, deputy 
foreign ministers Vitaly Churkin and Chuck Redman will continue 
to discuss that problem. Christopher reported that he had asked 
Kozyrev to use his influence with the Serbs to persuade them to 
join the Muslim-Croat federation in Bosnia as a possible way to 
reach a peaceful resolution. 
  The Russian minister said he was fully satisfied with the 
position taken by our American partners on transforming the G-7 
into the G-8. Russia's joining the Seven could take place at the 
next G-7 summit meeting in Naples in July of this year. In 
addition, Kozyrev told Christopher about Russia's special role 
in the ex-Soviet republics, and he said that the secretary of 
state had understood that idea correctly. They also discussed 
the withdrawal of Russian troops from the Baltic countries, 
human rights, the Partnership for Peace program, and a number of 
other problems. 
  As had been expected, the meeting did not produce any 
sensational news. But it had to be held. One gets the feeling 
that the sides got up from the negotiating table breathing a 
sigh of relief: No dispute arose, although that could have 
easily happened, and the sides gave each other vitally needed, 
frank explanations of their positions. In general, until the 
next time disagreements arise--and this will happen at some 
point, for not all of the current disagreements were 
resolved--one can apparently take the view that the Russian-U.S. 
partnership is withstanding its test of strength for now.

"Washington's `Ukrainian Card'"] 
  [Text] The recent American-Ukrainian summit in 
Washington was not marked by the signing of sweeping agreements. 
By reaffirming its commitment to the trilateral Moscow agreement 
on the Ukrainian nuclear weapons, Kiev secured Washington's 
consent to the offer of 700 million dollars in American aid to 
Ukraine and the extension of 400 million dollars in reserve 
credit in the future. From the standpoint of Russian national 
interests, however, it would be wrong to underestimate the 
results of the summit. The latest meeting between B. Clinton and 
L. Kravchuk, just as the Washington visits of the leaders of 
Kazakhstan and Georgia, suggested that the United States is 
competing vigorously with Russia for political and economic 
influence in the post-Soviet zone. 
<H5>  Kiev as a Counterbalance </H5>
  We know that in the first weeks after Clinton arrived in the 
White House, he and his advisers were already making some effort 
to reassess American-Ukrainian relations. Whereas the Bush 
administration had conducted an uncompromising dialogue with 
Ukraine, suggesting that economic and other aid to Kiev be 
dependent on its renunciation of nuclear weapons and development 
of relations with Russia, the Clinton team is employing much 
more flexible tactics. According to the frank admission of U.S. 
Deputy Secretary of State S. Talbott, "we let our Ukrainian 
friends know that we are striving for broader, deeper, more 
meaningful, multidimensional relations with a view to our common 
interests in the spheres of economics, politics, and security." 
  It is precisely in this context that we must view the 
congressional hearings on the state of U.S.-Ukrainian relations 
at the end of June 1993, resulting in the elaboration of the 
five fundamental principles of the Clinton administration's 
"Ukrainian" policy: 
  "1. A country in the center of Europe as large and as rich 
in 
resources as Ukraine should be playing a decisive role in 
security matters in Central and Eastern Europe (CEE); 
  "2. Ukrainian independence and sovereignty are important to 
U.S. national interests; 
  "3. Our relationship with Ukraine will not depend on our 
relations with Russia; 
  "4. In view of its history and geographic location, Ukraine 
has legitimate security concerns; 
  "5. We believe that Ukraine's own interests would be served 
by the fulfillment of its commitments in line with the Lisbon 
Protocol, its ratification of the START I Treaty, and its 
affiliation with the Treaty on the Nonproliferation of Nuclear 
Weapons as a nuclear-free state." 
  It appears that Washington is pursuing several goals at once 
in its more active "Ukrainian" policy. First of all, it wants 
the complete elimination of Ukraine's nuclear arsenal, with the 
whole process under its own close supervision, because the state 
of nuclear security in that former Soviet republic is a matter 
of serious concern. 
  Second, it is striving for the more predictable development 
of the still extremely complex political and economic situation 
in Ukraine, primarily by discouraging the curtailment of reform 
and preventing the country from sliding into chaos and splitting 
into several states, which CIA analysts expect to occur in the 
next two years. "The problem consists less in how successful or 
unsuccessful America's actions are than in the uncertainty of 
Ukraine's own position. It proudly declares its independence, 
but it does not have the necessary experience to cope with 
genuine difficulties," the WASHINGTON POST remarked. 
  Third, from the standpoint of American geostrategic 
interests, an independent Ukraine should serve as a strong 
buffer zone between CEE and Western Europe and Russia. It is no 
coincidence that Washington has had a generally positive 
response to the idea of establishing various types of regional 
bloc structures along the western borders of Russia under U.S. 
and NATO control. Furthermore, Washington's own attempts to form 
groups of states of its own design in the post-Soviet zone have 
been accepted by all of the countries of the East European 
region without exception, including Ukraine. 
  In pursuit of the fourth and final goal, Washington has 
given 
up its earlier temporizing stance on Ukraine and other former 
Soviet republics, particularly Georgia and Kazakhstan, and now 
wants to take the lead in formulating and conducting Western 
policy toward the CIS and to limit Russia's geopolitical 
potential considerably by making the breakup of the USSR 
irreversible and keeping Russia from inheriting great-power 
status. As S. Talbott, the "generator" of American policy on the 
CIS and Baltic countries, categorically announced, "we do not 
agree that Russia has a sphere of influence allowing it to 
behave in certain ways beyond its own borders with adverse 
effects on the independence of these states.... We do not even 
want to accept the implications of the term 'nearby foreign 
countries.'" 
  Therefore, Ukraine is being assigned the role of a 
counterbalance to possible Russian geostrategic and geoeconomic 
ambitions, especially its hope of securing key positions for 
itself in the post-Soviet zone. During the recent 
American-Ukrainian summit, L. Kravchuk publicly agreed with this. 
<H5>  `We Need a Strong Ukraine' </H5>
  Officials in Washington are not concealing the fact that the 
"Ukrainian card" will be played primarily in the sphere of 
military policy, where financial expenditures are not that 
burdensome but are extremely effective. Above all, this 
presupposes the offer of security guarantees to Kiev, with a 
view to its national independence and territorial integrity. As 
evidence of this, Ukraine was the first of the CIS countries to 
be included in NATO's "Partnership for Peace" program. 
  In addition to this, the Clinton administration wants to 
enhance its relations with Kiev with an extensive long-range 
program of economic, scientific, and technical cooperation, with 
a view to the impressive economic potential of Ukraine, which 
accounts for around 20 percent of the GDP of the CIS countries. 
In the opinion of several American politicians, during the 
effort to strengthen Ukraine's economy, America should try to 
lessen Kiev's dependence on Moscow by redirecting the Ukrainian 
economy toward the West. According to Z. Brzezinski, who has 
criticized the Democratic administration several times for 
putting too much emphasis on Moscow and not paying enough 
attention to Kiev, "if we do not want the revival of the Russian 
empire, we need a strong Ukraine." 
  At this time the State Department is working on several 
proposals to broaden economic aid to Ukraine and send a group of 
highly professional experts to that country on the condition 
that it take vigorous steps to decentralize its economy. There 
is no question that the agreement signed at the 
American-Ukrainian summit on the protection of foreign capital 
investments in Ukraine will have a positive effect on the 
development of trade and economic relations between the two 
countries. Besides this, Kiev probably will get the promised 
credits of 1.5 billion dollars from the IMF and the World Bank. 
  In view of the present disastrous state of the economy and 
the mounting separatist feelings in Crimea and several eastern 
oblasts, however, the Ukrainian leadership cannot put too much 
hope in a strong influx of American investments or in the U.S. 
offer to "usher" Ukraine into Western markets even if it does 
conduct a harsh confrontational policy in relations with Russia 
(which Ukrainian public opinion is unlikely to support). 
  Furthermore, Ukraine does not have much chance of joining 
the 
rapidly growing European Union or the "Visegrad Group," for 
which Kiev would be too "unmanageable." In other words, the 
circle is closing, and it may be impossible to escape Moscow. 
<H5>  `The Hand of Moscow' </H5>
  Irrespective of the wishes of the Ukrainian leadership, the 
once prosperous former Soviet republic might have to rely on a 
helping hand (in accordance with market conditions) only from 
Russia in the near future. An economic policy with an 
anti-Russian thrust would be futile and dangerous for Ukraine. 
The roots of industrial cooperation are too deep, and its 
dependence on Russian crude resources, especially gas, is too 
strong. 
  This does not mean, however, that the RF Ministry of Foreign 
Affairs can turn the pursuit of Russia's "Ukrainian" policy over 
to Gazprom, which was so proficient in finding a solution to the 
problem of Ukraine's debts for deliveries of Russian natural gas. 
  The fact is that playing the "Ukrainian" card, just as other 
cards like the "Georgian" and "Kazakhstani" ones, could lead to 
the dramatic reduction of Russia's geostrategic and geoeconomic 
capabilities under some circumstances. It is in Moscow's 
long-term interest to intensify integration processes within the 
CIS, establish a single post-Soviet economic zone, 
unconditionally give up the internationalization of problems 
between Russia and Ukraine (Crimea and the Black Sea Fleet), and 
support the social and economic structures in Ukraine with the 
strongest affiliation with the Russian Federation. Finally, it 
is time to consider more vigorous activity by Russian 
transnational corporations. Russia's investment expansion 
probably will produce perceptible economic advantages and 
strengthen its influence in the nearby foreign countries.

"American Intelligence Prefers NEZAVISIMAYA: The Use of Open 
Information Sources"] 
  [Text] Aside from the so-called human intelligence (Human 
Source Intelligence--HUMINT), which presupposes work with agents 
and proxies, the interrogation of defectors, or the questioning 
of persons who are visiting the country being investigated or 
who have left it, and also together with an analysis of open 
sources (Literature Intelligence--LITINT), intelligence 
information in the American classification is procured with the 
aid of diverse technical facilities of signals intelligence 
(Communications Intelligence--COMINT), reconnaissance by 
electronic means (Electronic Intelligence--ELINT), and space and 
aerial photography reconnaissance (Imagery Intelligence--IMINT). 
  When studying the question of the composition of 
intelligence 
information it is of fundamental importance to evaluate the 
correlation of such information procured from agent sources and 
information obtained with the use of legal possibilities, 
including notification, official contacts with informed persons, 
open-source analysis, and the gathering of information by way of 
personal observation during visits to accessible facilities, 
exhibitions, parades, exercises, and festivals, thanks to 
personal participation in conferences and symposia, and with the 
aid of various technical means of reconnaissance. 
  According to R. Hillenkoetter, director of U.S. central 
intelligence in 1948, "80 percent of intelligence information is 
obtained from such conventional sources as foreign books, 
journals, and S&amp;T reviews, photographs, the data of 
commercial 
analysis, newspapers, and radio broadcasts and also from general 
information obtained from persons who have an idea of affairs 
overseas." 
  Another American specialist in the field of intelligence, W. 
McGovern, observed: "It is very hard to compute mathematically, 
but I am inclined to believe that in the process of the 
preparation of strategic decisions approximately 20 percent of 
the basic information comes from clandestine sources, 
approximately 80 percent, from open, legal sources." 
  This viewpoint accords entirely with the opinion of a number 
of foreign specialists in the field of intelligence expressed at 
the end of the 1970's to the effect that 20-25 percent of the 
information procured by the intelligence community of the United 
States comes from open foreign sources (newspapers, journals, 
radio broadcasts, and so forth), 20-25 percent from the reports 
of employees of official missions of the United States in other 
states, and approximately 5 percent from unofficial sources, and 
technical types of reconnaissance account for the rest. 
  All these estimates are quite a plausible reflection of the 
possibilities afforded in the processing of open sources. An 
undoubted authority in the field of the organization of illegal 
intelligence-information activity, V.I. Ulyanov (Lenin), wrote 
in this connection: "Legal material is particularly 
important.... It would be no exaggeration to say that it is 
still possible on the basis of legal material alone to somehow 
write a professional brochure, on illegal material alone, it is 
impossible. Gathering illegal material... it is impossible also 
acquiring knowledge... which is scattered in a mass in brief 
newspaper reports and in special industrial, medical, land 
association, and other publications." 
  Let us, however, turn to modern examples from the experience 
of the American special services. Despite the fact that we have 
always been considered overseas a closed society, in which the 
free exchange of information is limited, many American 
specialists in the field of intelligence believed that even 
under these conditions "there is a considerable amount of 
information that may be collected from accessible materials." 
  Thus in the Soviet period of our history 11 of our most 
important military journals and newspapers, including KOMMUNIST 
VOORUZHENNYKH SIL, VOYENNO-ISTORICHESKIY ZHURNAL, and VOYENNYY 
VESTNIK, were of the greatest interest to the American military. 
In addition, specialists of American intelligence would make a 
close study of a considerable number of less well-known and more 
specialized periodical publications. 
  American experts always carefully studied the texts of 
official speeches of our country's top officials. An analysis of 
the formal and structural features of these texts made it 
possible to uncover contradictions in the Soviet leadership. 
  The polemic that developed in the CPSU Central Committee 
Politburo in 1969-1974 around the question of the essence of the 
Soviet military doctrine, in which Politburo members Andropov, 
Brezhnev, Grechko, Gromyko, and Kulikov found themselves 
involved, is given as an example. The parties' positions were 
reconstructed by American researchers by way of a content 
analysis of the Soviet leaders' public speeches based on 
material of the newspapers PRAVDA and KRASNAYA ZVEZDA. 
  Similarly, an analysis of the political information 
published 
in the open press of the USSR enabled specialists of the U.S. 
intelligence community to formulate valid forecasts as to who 
would fill the position of general secretary of the CPSU Central 
Committee in the period 1982-1985. 
  As the well-known American Sovietologist P. Steven 
(University of Virginia) observed, the policy of perestroyka 
largely contributed to an improvement in the work of specialists 
on the Soviet Union. "The resolve of the media in the USSR to 
illustrate problems of interest to us, the broadening of 
contacts between scientists of our two countries, and the 
growing readiness of Soviet politicians and officials and also 
representatives of science to freely and candidly discuss many 
questions with colleagues from the United States--all this 
increased considerably the extent and the quality of the 
information available to us. Specifically, we were able, thanks 
to the increased quality of information about Soviet society, to 
evaluate anew the work of former citizens of the USSR and the 
East European countries, on whom we had depended earlier in 
obtaining information at first hand, but whose personal 
partiality was sometimes reflected in the reliability of their 
information." 
  The source base of the report CIA SOV S87-10043 
"Enterprise-Level Computing in the Soviet Economy," which was 
published in 1987, was studied for an analysis of the 
composition and structure of intelligence information pertaining 
to our country. 
  Some 347 open sources, including 295 Soviet (85 percent), 
were used in the course of work on the report. The statistics of 
quotation by newspaper are given below (see chart 1). 

<FIG ID=JPRS-USR-037-67A>      FIGURE </FIG>


  On problems of military policy at the end of the 1980's the 
most important sources of information were the newspapers 
KRASNAYA ZVEZDA, which accounts for 75 percent of all 
references, and PRAVDA (16 percent) (see chart 2). 
  The situation changed noticeably at the start of the 1990's. 
Interest in our open sources (newspapers, particularly) became 
more diversified. Thus in the works of American analysts on 
military-policy topics in 1993 the most quoted Russian 
newspapers were the publications indicated in chart 3. 
  The information on the budget of the U.S. intelligence 
community is sufficiently eloquent also. Spending on 
intelligence has always been classified, but, employing special 
research procedures, an approximate level of this spending of 
$30-32 billion (some American experts put this amount at $34 
billion) may be established. 
  A relatively modest amount of these funds is spent on 
personnel. The funding of procurement activity (mainly with the 
aid of technical means of reconnaissance) accounts for the main 
expenditure (approximately 80 percent). It is significant that 
no more than 3 percent of the intelligence community's budget is 
spent on agent methods of operation. The remaining resources 
(approximately 17 percent) are spent on information and 
analysis, and also on administration, international cooperation, 
personnel training, and other purposes. 
  Determining, as a whole, the dependence of intelligence 
information on the sources of this type or the other (agents, 
technical means of reconnaissance--TSR--or open information 
material) would not seem possible. But the greatest volume of 
intelligence information is compiled, in the opinion of various 
specialists, from open sources and with the aid of TSR, which is 
not mutually contradictory, being an intersecting estimate made 
with approaches differing in terms of their criterion.

<F P=106> [Article by Natalya Kalashnikova: "Negotiations Between </F>
Russia and the IMF: The IMF Has Not Closed the Door"] 
  [Text] Yesterday, the last day of the negotiations 
between the IMF mission headed by executive director Michel 
Camdessus, was the busiest in terms of the number of meetings. 
In the morning Mr. Camdessus went to Tsentrobank to see Viktor 
Gerashchenko: They resumed discussion of the basic provisions of 
the statement from the Russian Government and Central Bank 
concerning economic policy for 1994. The director also visited 
the State Duma, where behind closed doors he discussed with 
speaker Ivan Rybkin the legislative support for the economic 
transformations in Russia. Even yesterday during the day, in the 
judgments of participants in the negotiations, the positions of 
the parties were fairly far from compromise. And it was not 
until near 2200 during the course of discussion that Prime 
Minister Viktor Chernomyrdin and Michel Camdessus seemed to see 
a light at the end of the tunnel. 
  The negotiations continued all day in various Moscow 
offices. 
But fears that differences regarding the conditions for granting 
Moscow the second part of the systemic credit of $1.5 billion 
would not be surmounted remained right up until evening. The 
only hope was for the meeting between Mr. Camdessus and Prime 
Minister Viktor Chernomyrdin, who had returned from Sochi. These 
negotiations began much later than planned. Tied up in traffic 
on the Moscow streets, Camdessus did not arrive at the meeting 
until 2000, and it lasted almost until midnight. Judging from 
preliminary information--not in vain. As KOMMERSANT-DAILY 
learned, the parties managed to remove a number of fundamental 
obstacles and establish in a joint statement the intention of 
the IMF to grant Russia the second part of the credit for a 
systemic transformation in the near future. 
  But the word "impasse" did not leave the lips of the Russian 
participants in the negotiations during all the subsequent days. 
The fact is that the IMF had doubts about the feasibility of the 
draft of the Russian budget for this year and also the 
possibility that the State Duma would approve it in this form. 
It was the 10 percent deficit which, in the opinion of IMF 
experts, might be increased even more after emotional discussion 
in parliament, that became the most disputed issue. The IMF had 
doubts, in particular, about a number of revenue items totalling 
20 trillion rubles [R]. Because of these doubts the Fund even on 
Friday was inclined to put off granting the systemic credit. And 
although IMF experts admitted that Russia had met one of the 
main conditions--reducing inflation (to 16-18 percent per 
month)--Mr. Camdessus again recommended that the Ministry of 
Finance "reduce inflation and streamline production." Such 
admonitions are not new. Nor is Camdessus' statement to the 
effect that the path to raising the standard of living of the 
Russians lies not through preserving the present model of 
production but through its growth. And to do this it is 
necessary to reduce and then stop issuing money to cover the 
budget deficit. Any financial support for an enterprise, in the 
opinion of the IMF chief, should depend on its capabilities of 
making production either produce income or operate with minimum 
losses. 
  Even if we keep in mind that Camdessus was only engaging in 
standard rhetoric, we can still assume that this time the IMF 
was taking a stricter approach to Russia than, for example, it 
did last spring. Then, as we know, the government also submitted 
for the Fund's consideration a program which, in the assessment 
of Russian experts, was not very different from this one but 
(this time in the opinion of experts of the IMF itself) fully 
met the requirements for including Moscow in the program for 
structural transformation. And in July Russia received the first 
half of the credit that is the subject of so many disputes in 
Moscow now. Nor is it out of place to recall the very practice 
of granting this kind of credit. Kazakhstan was the first to 
receive it. Now the republic has already been promised an even 
larger injection--through the standby credit line--and the IMF 
requirements for this credit are even stricter. And it would be 
difficult to assume that the course of the reforms in that same 
Kazakhstan are ahead of the Russian ones. Therefore granting 
credit to Russia would point to the idea of the existence of a 
double standard in the IMF. 
  [First Box, page 3] The basic scenario for economic and 
social development of Russia for 1994 (according to information 
from the Ministry of Economics of Russia): 
  --The budget deficit is projected in the range of 10 percent 
of GNP. The rate of inflation by the end of the year will 
decrease to 7-9 percent per month. The average annual exchange 
rate for the ruble is expected to be about R3,000 for $1. 
  --The decline of industrial production will slow to 10-12 
percent of the 1993 level. The reduction of GNP will be about 8 
percent. 
  --Preferential credit for industry and agriculture will be 
limited. The system for granting tax and customs benefits, 
subsidies, and preferences will be revived. Preferential credit 
will be granted only for carrying out highly effective 
investment and conversion plans on a competitive basis. 
  --It is planned to reform state enterprises, to make changes 
in the practice of privatization, to provide for a selective 
structural-investment policy, and to implement a program for 
reconstruction of inefficient enterprises with the removal 
(bankruptcy) of the least promising ones. 
  --The growth of consumer prices is projected to be within 
the 
range of 4.7-5.2-fold. [end box] 
  [Second Box, page 3] 
<H5>  Commentary </H5>
  From a formal standpoint the initially strict position of 
the 
IMF executive director is quite logical. So-called credit for 
purposes of systemic transportation is granted by the Fund as 
support for countries that are trying to increase the 
effectiveness of their economies according to principles of a 
free market and private property. Historically, this support 
goes back to the times of the postwar partition of the world 
among competing military blocs and the struggle between the 
liberal West and the communist system created in the USSR. 
Therefore international financial organizations are 
traditionally uneasy about the practice whereby national 
governments of recipient countries use methods that recall the 
economic policy of communist parties. In particular, all kinds 
of state support for inefficient productions (especially those 
that are state-owned) which leads to growth of the expenditure 
part of the budget and the lack of a clear anti-inflation policy 
are regarded as a violation of the fundamental principles of the 
activity of the IMF. A key role in evaluating the intentions of 
one government or another is played by the so-called Memorandum 
of Intentions and an analysis of the financial policy of this 
government, based primarily on an analysis of its budget 
practice. In other words the national government must prove to 
the IMF its resolve to undertake market reforms. All this is 
fairly difficult for representatives of Russia at the present 
time. 
  First of all, until the next special memorandum concerning 
economic policy or at least an agreement between the government 
and the Central Bank for the forthcoming year is signed, the 
situation with the Russian budget is unclear to the IMF. During 
the process of preparing its draft, in just one week its revenue 
part increased by almost one-third (from R90 trillion to R120 
trillion). The planned budget deficit is approaching 10 percent 
of GNP, and from statements from the government it is impossible 
to draw the conclusion that its goal is consistent reduction of 
it. The prospects for discussion of the budget in the State Duma 
make Fund specialists suspicious that after this the expenditure 
part will increase even more. 
  Nevertheless it seems that the main problem in the current 
stage of relations between the IMF and the Russian Government is 
not so much what is to be done next as how it is to be done. It 
has always been clear to the Fund leadership and international 
experts that any budget projections, any joint statements in 
Russia are either not fulfilled or are successfully evaded. But 
in the past the Russian Government has always demonstrated its 
desire to "persuade" international financial circles of its firm 
adherence to strict financial economy. And this is what is 
required of it now: Swallowing the "national pride of the great 
Russians," it is necessary to demonstrate this aspiration anew. 
And the IMF will close its eyes again because international 
financiers are most afraid of accusations that it is because of 
their intractability that the West lost Yeltsin.

<F P=106> [Article by Sergey Klyuchenkov and Marat Salimov: "New </F>
Customs Duties Evoke Protest: City Leaders and Importers Decided 
Not To Allow a Price Hike"] 
  [Text] Russian consumers have been given hope of 
keeping prices of imported food products at the existing level 
and importers--of avoiding bankruptcy. The mayors of Moscow and 
St. Petersburg, the chief of the administration of 
Yekaterinburg, and the largest Russian importers have spoken out 
against the introduction of unprecedentedly high import duties 
that violate the existing system for supplying large cities with 
food. Yesterday they appealed to the president and prime 
minister to abolish as "ill-considered and unsubstantiated" the 
government decree concerning the introduction of new customs 
duties on foodstuffs. 
  The mayors of Moscow and St. Petersburg, Yuriy Luzhkov and 
Anatoliy Sobchak, and also the chief of the administration of 
Yekaterinburg, Aleksandr Chernetskiy, in an open letter to the 
president stated that the decision to introduce duties on 
foodstuffs would inevitably lead to a sharp reduction of import 
deliveries of food products and, consequently, to a considerable 
increase in their prices within the country. The leaders of the 
three largest cities of Russia think that the goal set with the 
introduction of customs duties on food shipped into Russia--to 
protect and support the domestic producer of agricultural 
products--will not be achieved and instead of that the food 
market in large cities will decrease to dangerous levels. In the 
opinion of experts, the government, hiding behind the idea of 
the need to protect national producers, is deliberately 
provoking a new wave of inflation that will begin with a sharp 
increase in prices for imported food, and following inevitably 
after that will be higher prices for domestic food products as 
well. Since the level of self-provision of food in Russia has 
not even reached 90 percent, a reduction of imports could place 
the largest Russian cities on the brink of famine. Of course, 
after a certain time interval importers would adapt to the new 
conditions, but this would be done mainly through their 
reorientation toward purchasing low-quality goods from less 
developed countries. In parallel with this, prices of Western 
European goods, which now dominate on the markets of the large 
Russian cities, would increase by no less than one-third. In any 
case the Russian consumers stand to lose. 
  A similar demand--to abolish import duties on 
foodstuffs--was 
submitted to the president and government by the 12 largest 
importers, including the Eksportkhleb Association, the Menatep 
Trading House, the Eksimer, Medeya, and Kontinent joint-stock 
companies, and the Agrointorg VTO [foreign trade association]. 
The traders are also demanding that their import contracts paid 
for before 15 March be exempted from the decree. In this case, 
if the government does not soften its position, large food 
importers, about whose financial might nobody had any doubts 
even a week ago, could end up on the verge of bankruptcy. 
  At the present time the majority of large importers have in 
hand paid contracts for the delivery of goods not only in March, 
but up until the end of April. These contracts have been used as 
a basis for concluding agreements with large buyers. Dissolving 
them will entail payment of immense fines by import firms. Since 
all the traders are working using credit resources, delay in 
paying interest automatically bankrupts them. According to 
available information, in recent days representatives of 
importers have been conducting active negotiations with a number 
of highly placed members of the government in order to achieve a 
softening of the conditions for the introduction of the new 
rates. It is quite possible that at Viktor Chernomyrdin's 
meeting with Boris Yeltsin in Sochi they will also discuss the 
question of changing import conditions. Here, if one takes into 
account the broad reaction evoked by the introduction of duties 
on food, one can quite possibly expect that the president's 
reaction (and, in concert, that of the government) will be 
positive.

<F P=106> [Interview with Sergey Bezverkhiy, head of the RF </F>
Gosstandart [Russian Federation Committee on Standardization, 
Metrology and Certification], conducted by correspondent Yuriy 
Shikhov: "Sergey Bezverkhiy: To Care for the Producer While 
Protecting the Consumer"] 
  [Text] 
  [Begin box material] 
  Sergey Bezverkhiy was born in 1940. He graduated from the 
Vocational-Technical School on Mechanization of Agriculture and 
the Zaporozhskiy Machine Building Institute. He worked at an 
auto test site near Dmitrovo, having travelled the path from 
engineer to general director. Since November 1991, he has served 
as the head of the RF Gosstandart. 
  [End of box] 
  [Correspondent] With what, in your opinion, did the 
Gosstandart of Russia begin? 
  [Bezverkhiy] Officially, it began in November of 1991 after 
the signing of the Edict on the Gosstandart of Russia by Boris 
Yeltsin. However, its roots go back to the Petrine times, when 
by the order of the Russian emperor the fleet was created, arms 
production was developed, the deliveries of flax and other 
products to foreign countries were expanded or, in the words of 
the poet, the "window to Europe was being cut." Under these 
conditions, life itself demanded the issuance of edicts by Peter 
I on establishing standards and requirements for good quality 
products, including export products, so as not to undermine the 
prestige of the Russian Empire. 
  [Correspondent] What do you see as the primary tasks of 
Gosstandart at the current stage? 
  [Bezverkhiy] If we try to express the essence of our 
activity 
in concentrated form, I would say this: To formulate a standards 
base for the implementation of economic reforms being undertaken 
in the country, and to implement a unified state technical 
policy in the field of standardization, metrology and 
certification. At the same time, I will emphasize: Our main goal 
is to help consumers, to protect the population against 
dangerous products, to support the entrepreneur and to create 
favorable conditions for goods producers on the entire territory 
of Russia, stimulating interest in the manufacture of only high 
quality, competitive products. Standards must open the door to 
the world market for producers. The Gosstandart of Russia has 
the capacity for providing specific services to goods producers. 
Among them are: Information on product requirements in Russia as 
well as abroad; Aid in performing certification of products 
under any requirements of standard documents, including 
international; Preparation of practical recommendations on 
improving products not corresponding to current requirements, 
performed by our qualified experts for enterprises, as well as 
aid in formulating quality systems which have been tested in 
world practice. 
  We have to some degree inherited the structure of the USSR 
Gosstandart. However, the conception of the approach has 
principally changed. First of all, this is an orientation toward 
the international standard, a changeover to its direct 
application. At the same time, we have introduced the voluntary 
nature of the standard. Its requirements are mandatory for the 
producer only from the standpoint of safety of man and the 
environment. The standards, as I have already said, are 
international, and therefore if you want to trade only within 
the country and to make products which are not competitive on 
the foreign market, then you will consequently get a low price 
for these products. But if you want to earn currency, then you 
must fulfill the requirements of the international standard, or 
no one will take your goods. 
  [Correspondent] Will the introduction of European standards 
not leave Russia outside the bounds of trade-economic relations 
with the countries of the European Union? 
  [Bezverkhiy] Yes, the European Union is a closed economic 
group which has its own standards. If we want to cooperate with 
it on an equal footing, naturally we must raise the level of our 
standard-technical documents to the international level, and 
guarantee them if possible. Only in this way will we be able to 
establish the necessary trade-economic contacts. Since our 
greatest commodity turnover is with Europe, our producers must 
primarily be aware of the European standards. Our next step is 
to create a federal fund of standards of all types and 
categories, including international (regional) and national 
standards of foreign countries. 
  [Correspondent] Has the restructuring within the Gosstandart 
itself been completed? 
  [Bezverkhiy] For the present day, the legislative base for 
work under conditions of a market economy has generally been 
created. Legislation on consumer rights protection, on 
standardization, on ensuring the unity of measurements, and on 
certification of products and services has been adopted at our 
initiative. Other departments have prepared a number of the laws 
concerning questions of safety and environmental protection 
which have been issued, and which also touch upon questions of 
standardization, certification and metrology. Moreover, we have 
developed a set of sub-legal documents, as for example principle 
documents on certification. Altogether during the past two years 
there have been over 100 standards documents adopted, which 
create the principles, I would say, of a technical constitution 
regulating mutual relations of all economic subjects under 
conditions of a market economy. 
  But this is only the first part. The second is the reform of 
the system of Gosstandart itself. On 12 February 1994, the 
government adopted the decree, "On Organization of Work on 
Standardization, Provision of Unity of Measurement and 
Certification of Products and Services." This government statute 
has exclusively important significance. Basically, it 
organizationally completes the creation of a state system of 
control and supervision over correspondence of products to 
mandatory requirements of state standards and provision of unity 
of measurements in the country. The principle for our committee 
and for the regions has become the government decision which 
states that the local centers of standardization and metrology 
receive the status of territorial organs of the Gosstandart of 
Russia. In essence, within their regions they implement the 
policy of the committee and act as the organ of state executive 
power, and at the same time as a state institution with the 
right to manage certain types of work on a contractual basis 
(noncommercial, nonprofit). 
  It is no secret that the center of gravity for direct 
regulation of questions associated with the vital provision and 
resolution of social problems and the development of market 
economic relations is today ever more tangibly being shifted to 
the regions, and is being placed upon the local organs of 
executive power. This is specifically what determines the need 
for precisely formulating the basic guidelines of Gosstandart 
regional technical policy, so as to be able to maximally aid in 
the socioeconomic development of the regions and to give aid to 
the local administrative organs in this matter. 
  [Correspondent] What legal sanctions are provided for 
violators of the standards and certification regulations? 
  [Bezverkhiy] The law on protection of consumer rights, the 
law on standardization, and the laws on metrology and 
certification provide for rather strict measures of 
action--ranging from economic sanctions (fines) to criminal 
prosecution. While recently the manager of an enterprise which 
manufactured substandard products was fined by the ispolkom 
[executive committee] commission, in a symbolic manner, we might 
say, today such directors are given fines of hundreds and even 
thousands, and the enterprises are fined millions. For example, 
the A/O "Dartlend" was fined more than 60 million rubles (R). 
Unfortunately, the entrepreneur still rarely pays. We appealed 
to the court of arbitration, and they promised to find us 
methods of collecting this money. I spoke with the chairman of 
the RF Supreme Arbitration Court, Veniamin Yakovlev, and he 
support us. We agreed that in the near future we would appeal to 
the government or the Duma for adoption of an appropriate 
legislative statute. 
  [Correspondent] Is there a real mechanism for realization of 
the Law on Consumer Rights? Or is it necessary to rely on public 
control which is implemented by the consumer societies? 
  [Bezverkhiy] I believe that there is. Goods and services for 
which there are safety requirements are prohibited from sale 
without a certificate of compliance. Aside from this law, as I 
have already said, the Law on Certification of Goods and 
Services has been adopted, principle documents in this field 
have been developed, and around 60 orders of certification on 
types of products have been approved. After all, the 
certification of a tape recorder involves one set of regulations 
and standards. The certification of space products has its own 
requirements. The certification of tobacco goods--in general you 
do not know how to approach it, because smoking is harmful. In 
principle, it should be banned, but as long as they smoke, let 
them smoke tobacco, and not its substitute. Well, and so forth. 
  For every group of uniform product, the central organs have 
also approved a certification--a sort of higher level, which 
defines the ideology and policy. There are 21 of them. They have 
also ratified a middle level which, specifically, is the one 
which issues the certificates. There are around 200 of these. I 
would like to stress: This is not only Gosstandart. 
  Half is Gosstandart, and half is other organs of state 
administration and public associations. Around 600 laboratories 
have been accredicted. The essence of certification, the basis 
of consumer rights protection, is the testing of goods by a 
third, independent, party to see that they correspond to the 
standard. 
  We are often accused of monopolism. Well, 7 percent of these 
laboratories are within the Gosstandart system, and 93 percent 
are outside of it. It is important for us that they operate 
according to unified regulations, which correspond to the 
international ones, and that they be independent if possible. We 
do not have a law like they have, for example, in the FRG 
[Federative Republic of Germany]. There they have fines ranging 
from 2,000 to 10,000 marks for dishonest entrepreneurial 
activity. And for violation of testing and falsification or 
omission of negative results--a jail term of up to 3 years. If 
we had such a law, the affiliation of the testing laboratory 
would be unimportant. I hope that we too will come to this. 
  [Correspondent] Tell us, what are your relations with the 
state and social structures? Primarily with the State Committee 
on Anti-Monopoly Policy? 
  [Bezverkhiy] They are normal business relations, although 
sometimes there is some friction and an absence of mutual 
understanding. But this, I believe, is an inevitable thing. For 
example, the representatives of the committee actively help us 
in the local areas. Nine supervisory departments--the 
anti-monopoly committee, the sanitary-epidemiological 
inspection, the Ministry of Health, our committee, the trade 
inspection, the MVD [Ministry of Internal Affairs] and other 
agencies of executive power and departments--have signed a joint 
appeal to the heads of local administration with a request to 
create coordinating councils or commissions in the regions, 
which under the management of one of the deputy heads of 
administration would jointly resolve problems on ensuring the 
rights of consumers to safe and good quality products. Thus, we 
are delegating our powers and authorities to those organizations 
which are better informed in their field. This is how it is done 
throughout the world. However, at the same time we must, we are 
obligated, to remain monopolists in fulfilling our functions as 
the national organ of Russia which formulates the tactics and 
strategy for development of standardization, metrology and 
certification. It is we who ensure the work of the departments 
within the framework of mutually coordinated regulations and 
procedures. We maintain constant contacts with societies for the 
protection of consumer rights. Their representatives are 
present, as a rule, at most of our collegium meetings, speaking 
out with their comments and proposals. We always try to take 
them into consideration. 
  We also invite representatives of the Chamber of Commerce 
and 
the Congress of Exchanges to our collegium meetings. We have 
concluded agreements with them. We have delegated them powers 
and authorities within the framework of the functions which they 
fulfill. 
  [Correspondent] In other countries, the financing of 
standards development is performed primarily by companies 
interested in these standards. How is it in our country? 
  [Bezverkhiy] In Russia, for a number of years standards have 
been developed not by institutes, as was done previously, but by 
technical committees. There the principle of consensus reigns 
supreme. The contractor, manufacturer, consumer, and 
representatives of Gosstandart and societies for the protection 
of consumer rights have the right to participate in them. 
However, none of the commercial merchants has invested a single 
ruble in this endeavor, perhaps because they live by ready-made 
standards which already exist and which may be used free of 
charge. Especially since these standards suit them for the 
present time. However, since the state does not finance such 
technical committees, we have found ourselves in an unenviable 
position. Let me cite an example. The president of a certain 
firm came to me and asked for an international certificate: I 
want to supply oil and oil refining products abroad, he says. He 
has mastered one thing well: Without a certificate, the price on 
his product immediately drops by 30-50 percent. I tell him that 
in principle it is possible to obtain such a certificate. For 
this we have accredited laboratories and developed procedures. 
The trouble is that 35 of our standards on oil and petroleum 
products still do not correspond to the international standards. 
Thus, in order to issue a certificate to the businessman, 
Gosstandart would have to revise our standards, which would 
require around R350 million. Where can we get this money? The 
entrepreneurs do not give it to us. The Minister of Finance also 
does not give it. Imagine how many years we would spend revising 
all 25,000 standards which are in effect today in Russia and the 
CIS countries if the merchants do not get involved in this work? 
  [Correspondent] What is the premium for quality? 
  [Bezverkhiy] In the USA, Japan and a number of other 
industrially developed countries, premiums for quality are very 
popular. They are given the names of outstanding people and, as 
a rule, they are awarded at a very high level, including the 
presidential. A country cannot have unconditional international 
recognition if it has not attained world standards in the 
quality of its goods. You yourselves know: If it is Japanese, 
that means it is good. After all, there is neither oil, nor 
cotton, nor other resources in the Land of the Rising Sun... So 
the Japanese have decided to make product quality the main 
priority in their work. This has become the national task, a 
matter of national prestige for every Japanese. 
  In our country there have also been premiums for achievement 
of high technical-economic product indicators at various times. 
But, unfortunately, they enjoyed neither particular popularity 
nor authority. Well, and recently quality has generally faded 
into the background. However, we will not be able to make our 
ruble convertible if we do not manufacture products which are 
able to compete on the foreign market and which are capable of 
bringing us hard currency. I am convinced that the time is not 
far off when quality will become the national task and national 
prestige in Russia as well. As soon as the political passions 
subside more or less, Gosstandart will submit for the 
president's signature an edict on introducing a Russian premium 
on quality. Its distinguishing peculiarity will be the absence 
of monetary remuneration. It will be awarded each year in the 
name of the president. Goods producers who are laureates of this 
prize will receive tax benefits or the right to free 
advertising. It is true, the very fact of presentation of such a 
prize is already an advertisement. I believe this should 
motivate our producers to fight for this prize. 
  [Correspondent] What is your attitude toward the elimination 
of barriers in international trade? 
  [Bezverkhiy] The press has repeatedly announced Russia's 
intention to join in the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade 
(GATT). If we join in it, then we will be forced to bring all of 
our national standards--and, as I have already mentioned, for 
the present day there are 25,000 of them--into line with 
international practice. 
  As for the former USSR republics, Gosstandart has concluded 
an interstate agreement with them, stating that "we will live 
according to unified standards." An interstate council has been 
created, and not only the CIS countries will participate in its 
work. A representative from Lithuania is always present at its 
meetings. Moreover, bilateral agreements have been signed with 
practically all the former republics, specifically on the mutual 
recognition of the certificate of compliance, so as to exclude 
expensive retesting. If we perform testing of a "KamaAZ" and 
supply it to Belorussia, they will recognize our certificates in 
that country. This also constitutes the elimination of technical 
barriers in trade. 
  In general, I must say, the elimination of barriers is a 
clever thing: In words, everyone is `in favor' of it. Yet in 
fact, the EEC [European Economic Community], as I have already 
noted, is in practice a closed grouping of countries. In 
essence, normal access to this market is closed to any of our 
producers until we join in the EEC and until we harmonize our 
standards with the European ones. We also have our difficulties 
with GATT. Contrivances and tricks are being devised within its 
framework in order to support the industry of the member states 
of this organization and not to allow competitors. 
  Of course, we are interested in removing the technical 
barriers in trade for our goods producers. For this purpose, the 
committee actively works within international organizations on a 
bilateral basis. Treaties have been concluded with England, 
Israel, Japan, and South Korea. I would like to stress that we 
have come to agreement on the mutual recognition of 
certificates. Please, let us perform mutual accreditation of 
testing laboratories. You may control them and perform 
inspection control. However, our relations must be on an equal 
basis. 
  The ideal variant is large international agreements such as 
the Geneva Agreement on Automobile Technology. Its participants 
are practically all the countries of Europe, including Russia. 
Our certificates on automotive technology are recognized in all 
the European countries. If we issue the symbol E-22 to a car, 
then it is recognized as an international certificate in any 
country in Europe and the world. The same is true also in the 
production of firearms and munitions. Here the Brussels 
Convention is in effect, and we are completing arrangements for 
joining in it. 
  You probably know that a treaty on partnership and 
cooperation between Russia and the European Union is to be 
signed in the near future. One of the articles of this treaty, 
prepared with the direct participation of Gosstandart, provides 
for measures directed at increasing the compatibility of systems 
of standardization and metrology and evaluating the level of 
compliance and consumer protection of the agreeing parties. 
Recently we held successful negotiations with our colleagues 
from the European Commission, at which we reviewed in detail the 
systems of mandatory certification. In my opinion, one more 
practical step has been taken in expanding the spheres of trust 
between Russia and Europe.

<F P=106> [KAZTAG report: "To Sharply Accelerate Economic Reform"] </F>
  [Text] President Nursultan Nazarbayev held a 
conference on the issues of speeding up the implementation of 
economic reform in the republic. Among the participants were 
Vice President Erik Asanbayev, deputy prime ministers, state 
advisers and other members of the government, top officials from 
the National Bank and the National Academy of Sciences, and 
high-ranking staff of the president's and the Cabinet of 
Ministers' apparat. 
  In his address at the conference, Nursultan Nazarbayev 
emphasized the urgent need to accelerate the corrections to the 
government's program of action in reforming the economy, as well 
as improving the organization of this work and corresponding 
mechanisms. 
  Since the time of introducing the national currency, the 
heads of state and the government have issued more than 200 
edicts, decrees, and directives of a normative-prescriptive 
nature on the matters of development and intensification of 
economic reform. Thereby a number of serious problems of a 
legislative nature have been resolved, and the normative base 
considerably updated. 
  However, noted the president, a system approach and 
purposefulness are still lacking in the implementation of the 
entire complex of envisaged measures; there is insufficient 
coordination in the activities of ministries and government 
apparat offices in the preparation of normative-prescriptive 
documents and the organization of their implementation in 
practice. There are also disjointed actions between the National 
Bank and the Cabinet of Ministers in conducting a single strict 
financial-credit policy. Nor has the principal task of creating 
within the framework of the government and its structures an 
effective executive mechanism been resolved. 
  As a result, the process--from the moment documents are 
adopted to the point of their practical implementation--is 
stretched out impermissibly long and most normative acts are 
left hanging in midair. Moreover, some of them are consciously 
sabotaged. This is especially typical of those acts that involve 
changes in the administrative structure in industrial sectors. 
Operational decisions and measures adopted by ministries and the 
National Bank often are not correlated with one another or they 
contradict the program line. 
  For the purpose of streamlining this work, as well as 
preparing the Program of Anticrisis Measures and Economic 
Stabilization for 1994-1995, a republic commission was set up by 
the president's decree in January of this year. However, it 
still has not completed the draft of this important document and 
incorporated in it existing alternative proposals, in which 
there also are healthy kernels. Such procrastination is 
unacceptable, and it is not accidental that it causes resentment 
among the economic public and in the mass media. The commission 
should finally determine, urgently and clearly, which parts of 
alternative programs may be used for the benefit of the business 
at hand, and what should be discarded for the lack of 
constructive contents, and make the results public, thus putting 
an end to idle talk. 
  Unenviable fate also befell the latest plan of government 
actions--for the implementation of economic policy in 1944. The 
control functions had been assigned to the Ministry of the 
Economy, which itself is not succeeding in the execution of this 
document. In addition, some ministries, bypassing the Ministry 
of the Economy, petition the government to move the time frame 
for the implementation of one or another part, or revise them. 
This cannot go on any longer, said Nursultan Nazarbayev. 
  In connection with the current situation, he brought up a 
number of cardinal proposals aimed at accelerating development 
of a program to intensify the reform. 
  The main emphasis, in the president's opinion, should be 
placed on increasing authority and dramatically improving the 
activities of executive power structures and state organs of 
administration. The measures necessary for this have been 
outlined; they are to be conducted within several areas. 
  The first is the legal base for the reform. The normative 
base with respect to main economic spheres and direction of the 
reform, created by the president's and government's decisions 
since the introduction of the national currency, should be 
systematically organized and evaluated: in which parts such a 
base is sufficient, and where additional development of 
normative acts is needed. 
  The next area is effective use of aid provided by the world 
community. All channels of financial aid from international 
organizations and foreign countries going through the government 
need to be merged within directions, economic sectors, and the 
republic's social sphere. It is also important to work out the 
main principles and mechanisms of its utilization, including 
program support, state structures and other institutions 
responsible for project implementation, and the use and 
repayment of credits and loans received for such use. 
  Next: development of individual spheres of domestic economic 
policy. In this area it is necessary to fully evaluate the real 
structural transformations that have been accomplished in the 
national economy. Large-scale projects of national significance 
and ones that are ready for implementation need to be selected, 
and the measures of support in corresponding decisions be 
drafted. It is also necessary to define economic spheres and 
sectors that will be developing along the lines of separate 
programs--entrepreneurship, insurance operations, defense and 
other complexes--and set strict deadlines, as well as designate 
those responsible for the preparation of real programs. 
  Among other subjects mentioned were the expedience of 
drafting five-year plans by indicators, beginning with 1995; 
further support for privatization processes and holding 
structures, giving them greater freedom of action; facilitating 
development of consumer goods production; increasing the volume 
of processing of agricultural products; reorganizing the work of 
the state statistics system, which in many respects still 
operates in the old mode; and other current problems. 
  The decisive factor in achieving the goals set is good 
organization of the work of state organs and the entire 
executive apparat. This means that distribution of powers and 
functions between ministries and other government organs must be 
analyzed and revised, and as a result the responsibility for 
implementation of a specific area of economic policy clearly 
assigned to each. It appears that in this respect it will be 
necessary to eliminate the still-existing duplication of effort, 
which will require structural changes with sensible staff 
reductions. 
  Among those who participated in the subsequent exchange of 
opinions were First Deputy Prime Minister Akezhan Kazhegeldin, 
Deputy Prime Minister Zhanybek Karibzhanov, and the State 
Anti-Trust Policy Committee Chairman Petr Svoyikh. Deputy Prime 
Minister Sergey Kulagin reported on the progress of preparation 
for the spring sowing campaign. 
  It has been decided to complete preparation for the program 
for activation of implementation of the economic reform within a 
compressed time frame and to discuss it immediately afterwards. 
The president also intends to consider in the nearest future the 
issues associated with denationalization and privatization, 
adjustments to the program of social protection of the 
population, housing policy, and intensification of suppression 
of crime.

<F P=106> [Two-part interview with Baltabek Kuandykov, deputy minister </F>
of power and fuel resources of the Republic of Kazakhstan and 
president of the state-owned company Kazakhstankaspiyshelf, by 
Khaliolla Baymen, in Almaty; date not given: "We Are Starting in 
the Caspian Not With the Sinking of Wells but With Ecological 
Research"] 
<H5>  [24 Mar p 3] </H5>
  [Text] [Baymen] Baltabek Mukhanovich, the news media have 
reported repeatedly the formation of the state-owned company 
Kazakhstankaspiyshelf and the creation of an international 
consortium to study and develop the Kazakhstani shelf of the 
Caspian. Please describe the significance of this new project 
for Kazakhstan's economy and its immediate prospects. 
  [Kuandykov] Kazakhstan is, as everyone knows, quite rich in 
natural raw material resources, including oil and gas. We have 
for the past several years running produced 26-28 million tonnes 
of oil and 7-8 billion cubic meters of gas annually. But, in 
practice, the bulk of the hydrocarbons is recovered from old oil 
and gas fields, and for this reason the level of this recovery 
has been in a state of stagnation, as it were. And however much 
we would wish it, we cannot observe any movement in the 
direction of an increase, which is so essential for the needs of 
the republic, although the potential raw material reserves are 
quite substantial, which is recognized not only by Kazakhstani 
but also foreign specialists. 
  However, as far as the recently discovered major fields of 
West Kazakhstan at Tengiz and Karashyganak are concerned, they 
are not yet being opened up at full strength because of the 
absence in the republic of the corresponding modern technology 
and the present economic difficulties. Joint ventures with 
foreign firms are being formed on the basis of these raw 
material giants today (more precisely, one already exists at 
Tengiz, and one is being formed at Karashyganak) to accelerate 
the development of these fields and to obtain a palpable overall 
increase in the production of oil and gas in the republic. 
  One of the biggest facilities, which could not only provide 
the republic with an immense influx of hydrocarbons but also 
appreciably influence the progress of the economic reforms of 
the young independent state, is the territory of Kazakhstan's 
sector of the Caspian. 
  As individual results obtained earlier by Russian and 
Azerbaijani geological and geophysical enterprises show and 
which are indicated by general geological premises also, this 
territory has colossal forecast reserves of raw material. 
According to specialists' estimates, there is a high probability 
of the discovery of a deposit far in excess, say, of the unique 
Tengiz field. But it has to be said that until recently 
Kazakhstan has not operated under offshore conditions, 
unfortunately. Today the republic lacks modern equipment and 
trained specialists and the so necessary skills and experience 
of offshore exploration. 
  Following a thorough consideration of this problem, the 
Kazakhstan Government decided to form the Kazakhstankaspiyshelf 
specialized state-owned company, which was entrusted with a 
comprehensive study of the prospects of the territory of the 
Kazakhstani sector of the Caspian and determination of the paths 
for the optimum assimilation of the underwater storehouses. 
  Considering the lack of technology and the experience of 
work 
under offshore conditions, from the first day of our activity we 
began to assimilate the experience of similar territories. The 
North Sea, the China Sea, the Gulf of Mexico, areas of the 
Adriatic, and other similar bodies of water, for example. Then 
we embarked on the creation of a republic concept for the 
assimilation of offshore deposits. The main essence of the 
concept, of course, amounted to the attraction of foreign 
investments since we could not cope with such a scale of 
operations with our own resources. The conditions for attracting 
Western oil companies were prepared, and all our proposals were 
presented to the most important international companies with the 
corresponding experience and unprecedented world authority under 
conditions appropriate to the Caspian. Thanks to the 
organization of lengthy and scrupulous negotiations we rested 
our choice by way of tender on six companies--the Italian Agip 
and British Petroleum, which is acting as one entity in 
conjunction with the Norwegian Statoil company, and also British 
Gas, the American Mobil, the Dutch Shell, and the French Total. 
Then, on 9 June of last year, a preliminary agreement on the 
basic principles of our relations and interaction was signed 
with representatives of the above companies, and a final 
agreement on the creation of an international consortium of the 
oil companies for the realization of a comprehensive program for 
study and development of the Kazakhstani body of the sea was 
signed on 3 December 1993. The said dates were historic for us 
in a way, incidentally, and we hope that they will be the start 
for a new history of the offshore oil and gas industry of 
Kazakhstan. 
  [Baymen] Overseas representatives are calling the 
preliminary 
plan for the geological and geophysical study of and development 
of the deposits one of the biggest in the world. What are the 
reserves of hydrocarbon raw material and what are the particular 
features of the impending efforts? 
  [Kuandykov] According to experts' estimates, the Caspian 
region is, as I have already said, unique, and the plan for 
future development is rightly considered one of the most 
important in the world. Of course, the results will be revealed 
by the time that the drilling and the recovery of the oil and 
gas begin. Such preliminary estimates are conditioned not only 
by the big anticipated reserves of hydrocarbons, but also by the 
particular ecological conditions connected with the expected 
difficult technical conditions of the sinking of deep wells and 
the assimilation of deposits with a particular concentration of 
hydrogen sulfide, high formation pressures, and a number of 
recent engineering solutions. 
  Concerning natural gas reserves: According to the most 
modest 
estimates of both local and Western specialists who have made a 
study of areas of the sea, about 3.5 billion tonnes of oil and 
about 2.5 trillion cubic meters of gas are anticipated in the 
Kazakhstani sector. Very large reserves. I am citing relatively 
modest forecasts so far. There are, of course, bolder 
assumptions also, but these will be shown by exploration. 
  [Baymen] The problem of the environment has become 
increasingly urgent as of late. The Caspian also has been in far 
from the best position in this respect, and many people are 
today, therefore, anxiously asking: Is it possible to guarantee 
a safe and most assiduous method for the recovery of the 
expensive industrial raw material? 
  [Kuandykov] I would like to say that many questions arise in 
connection with the particular ecological conditions because the 
Caspian is a closed body of water and is not the Mediterranean 
or, say, the Gulf of Mexico. Both the water exchange and the 
marine flora and fauna and living organisms differ from other 
seas also. The northern part of the sea was formerly, in 1974, 
declared a protected zone for the preservation of all that there 
is here--the animal and vegetable world--and the surrounding 
environment--the air and water--for future generations. All 
drilling operations, the recovery of mineral resources, large 
nautical transport systems, construction operations at sea, and 
so forth were banned. But life, as they say, does not stand 
still, and our present project is distinguished by the fact 
that, having adopted all world experience of work under 
approximate conditions, we are making of paramount importance 
the resolution of ecological problems. Our future efforts must 
not cause the least damage to the existing natural balance of 
this region. After all, very valuable species of fish have their 
habitat here, as you know: The northern Caspian accounts for 
approximately 90 percent of the world's sturgeon catch and the 
production of black caviar. There are many species of animals 
that have been entered in the Red Book, and this is also a 
migration route for many rare birds. Considering all this, we 
are embedding in the plan of upcoming operations the strictest 
demands, in accordance with the highest international standards. 
  [Baymen] The state of the sea and the land are giving rise 
to 
certain apprehensions even today, when no operations have even 
yet begun. 
  [Kuandykov] The state of the sea today is far from the best, 
unfortunately. The catch level is falling by the year, fish 
stocks are melting away before our eyes, it may be said, and the 
content of harmful elements in the water is increasing 
catastrophically. We have analyses performed by various 
institutes and organizations of the composition of the Volga 
water and the water from the Ural (Zhayk) River. Global changes 
in the composition of the sea water because of technogenic human 
influences, the construction of a multitude of dams on the 
Volga, the use of various chemicals in agriculture, coastal 
operations, and so forth, are occurring even here, evidently. 
All this could not fail to influence the overall state of the 
body of water. 
  In addition, since about 1978 the Caspian has been rising, 
and at the present time the level of the rise is the almost the 
equivalent of more than two meters. This means tremendous 
changes for the sea; the former littoral deposits, agricultural 
land, and communities are being flooded. The catastrophic 
influences of the risen sea waters on the coastal areas, 
particularly in the northern part where the shore is very flat 
and each change in the weather and strong wind are palpably 
reflected in the water level, have been frequent phenomena 
lately. 
  On the whole, therefore, I believe that even were we to 
perform no offshore operations, the state of the Caspian would 
deteriorate by the year. And this process could be quite rapid: 
The overall changes in the composition of the water and the 
general rise in the level of pollution in connection with the 
inundation of new littoral territories and individual riparian 
oil wells are being superimposed on top of one another. 
Everyone, I mean the inhabitants of those regions, knows about 
this, research organizations and our government authorities know 
about this. And if we are today speaking about saving the Aral, 
I would say that the problem of preservation of the Caspian is 
no less serious today. But not in the sense of sitting and doing 
nothing and admitting no one to the sea but taking today even 
some specific action to improve the situation. Unfortunately, it 
has to be affirmed that no particular attention is being paid to 
this with us, nor is there the money. 
  [Baymen] Consequently, we need to take a somewhat broader 
view of the problem and pose the question not only of pollution 
of what is already quite a polluted body of water from the 
upcoming large-scale operations but of measures specified in an 
agreement to improve its present state? 
  [Kuandykov] Yes, this is the task we set ourselves. Our 
actions will be geared to assisting the utmost improvement. How 
might this be achieved? First and foremost, we will employ the 
most modern methods of work. We are planning to build various 
facilities, for the production of young fish--fish 
hatcheries--say, and will participate in cleaning up the 
polluted sectors of the sea, that is, the ecological state of 
the sea will be monitored constantly. And I would like to repeat 
yet again that it is these problems which will be given 
priority. The project itself--which begins with ecological 
research, and the rest of the work will begin only upon the 
completion of this first ecological stage--is confirmation of 
this. If the stage shows that it is possible to work with the 
use of the best world experience, we will do so, if, however, 
the results are negative, the question of the impossibility of 
development will truly arise. 
  Incidentally, our approach in terms of this plan is somewhat 
different from the approaches in other parts of the world: we 
intend, thanks to foreign investments, to initially perform 
research work and not to begin, as some people believe, with the 
immediate sinking of wells, but taking account of all the 
special conditions of the vulnerable region. Upon the completion 
of this work, all the negative consequences being reduced to 
nothing, geological and geophysical research is to begin, 
permitting the study of the geological structure and the 
tectonics of highland allotments, clarification of the available 
forecast reserves, and determination of the most interesting and 
promising zones. Only then can we speak of the allocation on the 
territory to be developed of packages of future drilling 
operations and future production areas. All the participants in 
the international consortium will cooperate on these terms, and 
after the research part has been completed, they will obtain 
packages and the exclusive right to perform production and 
drilling operations to compensate for their outlays invested at 
the initial stage. In the event of the discovery of an oil or 
gas field in their packages, they will compensate their outlays, 
and in the event of failure, that is, nondiscovery, their 
outlays shall not be compensated. 
  All six firms that I have named are among the world's top 
10-20 oil companies. They have their own character, their own 
tremendous experience, and unsurpassed equipment and techniques 
for such operations, and this is why we chose them. The drilling 
operations scheduled for subsequent years will not appreciably 
influence the environment, or this influence should not be that 
perceptible. At the same time, all that is produced in the 
waters of the Caspian and the entire recovery of hydrocarbon raw 
material will afford Kazakhstan big economic benefits. 
<H5>  [25 Mar p 3] </H5>
  [Baymen] The Caspian region is rightly considered oilmen's 
territory; several generations of specialists have grown up over 
many decades, there are whole family dynasties, even, and 
tremendous experience of the working of deposits has been 
accumulated, and there are at the same time virtually no 
operators skilled in offshore development.... 
  [Kuandykov] The training of local personnel is a principal 
section of the agreement. Yes, marine geologists, geophysicists, 
environmental experts, drillers, extractors, and other 
specialists are lacking in Kazakhstan today. We are planning to 
train them with the facilities of the best Western technology. I 
would like to emphasize: to train local personnel, for which the 
future project is essentially being put together. This in itself 
will entail substantial capital investments also. 
  The next important aspect is the provision of local 
enterprises with modern equipment, that is, at our demand 
Western firms are required to equip the local geophysical 
organizations the way they themselves have them equipped. They 
will have to pass on their know-how to Kazakhstani 
organizations. In addition, large sums will be allocated for the 
formation of the social infrastructure and also for the 
infrastructure necessary for performance of the planned 
operations: the installation of depots, machine shops, warehouse 
premises, moorings for the ships, and such facilities as, say, 
desalination units for turning the sea water into drinking water 
and industrial water for the needs of the public and the work of 
the consortium. We intend to build helicopter pads to serve both 
Western and local specialists, and fish hatcheries, and we 
believe that we will be benefiting the development of cities' 
water and sewerage systems. We will also take part in other 
social programs, of which the region is greatly in need. I 
cannot today, unfortunately, give you the figures which are 
contained in the plan, since they are still in the modification 
phase, but it can be said even now that quite large sums for an 
improvement in the condition of the region are contemplated. It 
should be added that it is not only the oil sector that will be 
developed. The republic will require with the performance of the 
offshore work the development of all the attendant sectors, such 
as iron and steel, enterprises for the construction of offshore 
installations, electronics industry, agriculture, medicine, and 
so forth. In a word, the entire gamut of interrelated sectors 
will be developed. 
  [Baymen] This is why the project is considered one of the 
world's biggest, evidently? 
  [Kuandykov] Primarily because, according to estimates of 
certain specialists, and this is what we believe also, tens of 
billions of dollars of investments will be required for the 
development of the deposits in the bed of the Caspian. These 
immense resources will be invested on the territory of 
Kazakhstan. And, naturally, the people who live in the Caspian 
region will receive their corresponding share and will, 
consequently, acquire the possibility of accelerated 
development. We do not intend to reconcile ourselves to the way 
in which we have lived hitherto, when oil has been produced on 
this territory for 80 years, and our people and our fathers are 
still living in huts. We have no desire to organize our work 
like this. New technology, a new social atmosphere, and new 
facilities will come, and we want herewith to raise the culture 
of production and society's living standard. 
  [Baymen] A commonly held opinion is that big oil means big 
politics.... Kazakhstan is becoming a pioneer in the field of 
international contracts and a kind of example for the former 
Union republics. How is this fact being reflected in its 
political image, and are not disagreements arising among Caspian 
states over the division of spheres of influence and 
determination of the water boundaries? What have the recent 
interstate meetings in this connection done in this sense? 
  [Kuandykov] There are various kinds of talk and various 
opinions surrounding the Caspian at this time. For instance, 
there was a conference last fall of representatives of states of 
the former Union in Astrakhan. I took part also. It was the 
first attempt to solve contentious and problematical questions 
concerning the future of the Caspian. Questions pertaining to 
development of the sea's mineral resources, what the division of 
territories would be, what the movement of sea-going ships would 
be, how the fish industry would develop, and so forth, were 
raised. Questions of the environment, specifically, how the 
states, which are now independent, intended to pursue a common 
environmental protection policy, were examined. 
  Without expatiating on all the problems, it may be said that 
on the question of the development of mineral resources a 
positive solution was reached. The parties agreed on the 
principles of the division of the states' economic zones. They 
are in keeping with world standards and world experience (the 
experience of the Black Sea, the North Sea, the Adriatic, and 
other water basins, say). That is, an agreement providing for 
the division of economic zones along the sea bed and the depths 
of the Caspian along the median between opposite shores and 
opposite states was reached. This document has now been prepared 
by the Kazakhstan side and has been sent to all the Caspian 
states. I believe that we will sign such an agreement in the 
near future. This is just one aspect, and negotiations are 
currently under way between fishermen and environmentalists and 
between military personnel where there are military interests. 
  I believe that we will come to an agreement on the Caspian 
with Russia, Azerbaijan, and Turkmenia [Turkmenistan] and will 
try to make joint use of the current production bases and human 
resources for the assimilation of the riches of this region. It 
may be stated candidly that there is no insoluble global problem 
among these states in respect to this territory. 
  [Baymen] And the final question. The republic still has no 
law on oil and, particularly, offshore research, as a 
consequence of which certain difficulties in cooperation with 
our Western partners will, most likely, arise. 
  [Kuandykov] A draft law on oil was prepared long since and 
has been discussed repeatedly in various committees and 
commissions of the republic Supreme Council and in the 
ministries. The draft was prepared by Kazakhstani specialists in 
conjunction with foreign experts. And we believe that it 
corresponds to all international standards. It contains sound 
opportunities for foreign investments in the economy of 
Kazakhstan. Unfortunately, this law was passed on from one 
session to another, and the previous parliament ultimately did 
not have time to adopt it. And it was passed on not because it 
was bad, it is simply that there are certain forces which do not 
welcome it--for far from objective reasons. International expert 
evaluation also took a long time. I hope that we will ultimately 
approve such a law and that it will perform a positive role not 
only for the republic but also for all who wish to work with us.

<F P=106> [Interview with Alex Moskovich, adviser of President N. </F>
Nazarbayev, by Dmitriy Makarov and Andrey Knyazev; place and 
date not given: "Adviser of Leaders"] 
  [Text] Alex Moskovich is an old and good friend of 
our paper, and interviews with him, formerly a member of the 
French Parliament and honorary citizen of Paris, have been 
published in ARGUMENTY I FAKTY repeatedly. Following the lifting 
of the "iron curtain," he has visited Russia often and has lived 
here. He feels the problems of one-sixth of the world as his 
own. But his experience of life and politics as the "confidant" 
and first adviser of the legendary French president de Gaulle 
has gone unclaimed by Russian politicians. In Kazakhstan, on the 
other hand, his experience is considered useful. A. Moskovich is 
now an adviser of President N. Nazarbayev. 
  [ARGUMENTY I FAKTY] You are Nazarbayev's adviser on economic 
and political matters. Does he really listen to you? 
  [Moskovich] We have a tacit understanding, as it were: he 
reads what I write him just about daily and does what he wishes. 
I, regardless of whether it is pleasant for him or not, express 
my opinions. Then we sit down and begin to look into my 
suggestions point by point. Nazarbayev says what he agrees with, 
what he rejects. 
  An ability to listen and hear is very important for a 
statesman. 
  [ARGUMENTY I FAKTY] Nazarbayev is currently being accused of 
serious blunders--the republic's economy is in a difficult 
position, and the situation concerning the Russian-speaking 
population, in North Kazakhstan particularly, is very complex. 
  [Moskovich] First, a law on Russian as the language of 
interethnic communication has been adopted in Kazakhstan. 
Second, Nazarbayev realizes that the republics of the former 
USSR will not on their own climb out of the morass in which they 
have all found themselves. The price of the ruble can only be 
maintained by expanding the production sphere, increasing the 
national product, and seeking to ensure that the state become 
richer. Unless the state becomes richer, its citizens become 
poorer. Everything is interconnected. 
  [ARGUMENTY I FAKTY] Prior to the disintegration of the USSR, 
only four republics--Russia, Turkmenistan, Azerbaijan, and 
Lithuania--seemingly had a surplus balance in interrepublic 
trade. When Russia said: That's enough, brothers, let's live 
each for himself, all republics quickly introduced their own 
currencies. They, consequently, had been preparing for this in 
advance. Hence they knew or anticipated that the disintegration 
would occur.... 
  [Moskovich] They did not so much know as fear that Russia 
would kick them out of the ruble zone. It was fear that prompted 
these decisions. 
  [ARGUMENTY I FAKTY] Sometimes states, like people also, 
probably, need to live apart in order to evaluate their partner 
and ponder and weigh up whether we need one another. 
  [Moskovich] I cannot agree. Strong and powerful countries 
with their own culture, literature, and science--Britain, 
France, Spain, Germany--are uniting, we are parting--this is a 
paradox. If we are speaking of Kazakhstan, however, it was 
impossible for Russia to separate from it. There are a multitude 
of reasons for this. The main ones are the immense resources 
that were invested in the development of Kazakhstan's industry 
by the former Union, the common economic interests, following 
the severance of which Russia and Kazakhstan have found 
themselves in a difficult economic position, and, finally, the 
existence of natural resources, which can only be developed by 
everyone together. An independent republic separately lacks the 
powers for this, unless "uncles" from the West help, and not, 
understandably, for a pair of beautiful eyes. 
  There are other factors also. And it is only the restraint 
and deliberateness of the decisions adopted by Nazarbayev that 
have thus far kept the republic from a rapid fall. Were it to 
fall, however, it would pull Russia with it also--they are that 
closely bound together. 
  [ARGUMENTY I FAKTY] Some political scientists and economists 
are comparing Kazakhstan and China, economically, at least. 
Fundamental economic changes have occurred in the PRC in the 
past 10-15 years, and people have become richer. But there has 
been virtually no increase in democracy. 
  [Moskovich] In my view, the Chinese are right to be doing 
all 
that they can to ensure that each citizen in a country of more 
than 1 billion reach the plank of life of $2,000 a year. Why 
should every Chinese have to get into politics? Do you think 
that in civilized states, which consider themselves democratic, 
any janitor, even if he has the wisdom of Solomon, would be 
admitted to administration of the state? No, an oligarchy rules 
there, and democracy is a myth. I have yet to encounter real 
democracy in a single country. So Kazakhstan could learn some 
things from China in this respect. Why did Russia and 
Kazakhstan, all the former republics of the USSR, which were 
under conditions of postwar devastation identical to France, not 
achieve what France was able to achieve? There was no NEP [New 
Economic Plan]! In the middle and at the end of the 1980's the 
economy was generally on course, but glasnost became license. 
Until everyone understands that everything starts with the 
economy, there will be no "miracle"! Progress means man 
compelling a machine to work, and himself working less. 
Initially, 16 hours a day, then, 9, and then, 6. He has time for 
the theater, the movies, books. 
  [ARGUMENTY I FAKTY] What if people do not know what to do 
with their free time? 
  [Moskovich] If he wants to realize his capabilities, this 
problem does not arise. I became wealthy long ago and need not 
have worked for 30 years now, but I continue to work, even at 
the age of 82. And it is not even a question of money. Money is 
a means for achieving an end, not the end in itself. 
  [ARGUMENTY I FAKTY] For many people it is the end as well. 
In 
Moscow there are many people who stand in line to purchase a 
sable coat, others are forced to run around the stores in search 
of cheap food. 
  [Moskovich] However the economy might develop and however 
huge the size of the middle class, there will always be people 
living below the poverty line. And it will be this way until the 
world achieves over-abundance. Then we may give to everyone 
according to their requirements. And lines at stores for the 
wealthy are excellent proof that there are coming to be more 
prosperous people in the state. And it is important, in 
addition, to be lucky. Both for people and for countries. One 
ancient Russian chronicle said: "Our land is great and abundant, 
but it lacks order." Order needs to be established. Nazarbayev 
will do this, I believe. 
  [ARGUMENTY I FAKTY] Where? In what country? Russia, France, 
Kazakhstan? And, in general, of what state do you feel yourself 
to be a citizen? 
  [Moskovich] When the French inadequately defend the policy 
of 
France, this in itself is abnormal. A true man may love many 
women, but properly only two: his mother and his mistress. His 
mother, whom he forgives everything, and his mistress, whom he 
forgives nothing. So it is that I forgive the Soviet Union, now, 
Russia, everything, and I forgive France nothing. I love Russia 
very much. For me Russia runs from the White Sea to the 
Bosporus. These are the geographical borders which were ordained 
for it... by whom I do not know because I do not believe in God.

<F P=106> [Article by Namoz Normumin, secretary of the ERK DP Council </F>
in Surkhondaryo Oblast: "The Fourth ERK Congress"] 
  [Text] 
<H5>  I. </H5>
  A basic condition for the functioning of political parties 
is 
freedom of speech and the press. These play a basic role in 
linking party administrative organs and party members through 
mass information. Beginning in 1993 the ERK Party was forbidden 
from publishing its own newspaper. The party chairman and other 
members of the leadership operated under pressure and 
persecution. Despite this the ERK Democratic Party was able to 
communicate its own position to the Uzbek people through the 
foreign press, and in this way attempted to preserve the 
connection between the party leadership and party members. 
  The 4th Congress of the ERK Democratic Party took place 
under 
difficult conditions for the party. The appeal to the government 
made at the 16 May 1993 meeting of the party central council 
remained unanswered. This demonstrated once again that no 
compromise is possible between the government and the opposition. 
  It must be said that the difficult conditions for the party 
caused a state of depression among some party members. Their 
lack of will and weakened beliefs caused a deviation from the 
basic principles stated in the party statutes and led them to 
seek a way of uniting with the present government which is 
attempting to maintain the old order. I want to dwell on this 
question in detail: the government, making use of the political 
inconsistency of the likes of Shodi Karimov and Sodiqjon 
Yigitaliyev, is acting to blacken the reputation of the ERK 
party and give it a bad name among the people. The persons 
mentioned above have accused ERK of an unwillingness to 
compromise. Fine, in what way could there be compromise between 
the government and the opposition? Specifically, what are the 
conditions for compromise between the ERK Democratic Party and 
the present government? 
  For a compromise to be reached between the government and 
the 
opposition their codes in the sectors of politics, economics, 
and social issues would be in conformity and the government has 
to consider the opposition code as a variant of its own code. 
This is a normal situation in democratic countries. 
  As for our critics, they are ultimately thinking of 
compromise in a primitive manner and see compromise in the form 
of personal interest. For example, it was suggested by the 
president that Muhammad Solih, chairman of the ERK Democratic 
Party, be given high rank. The entrance of an opposition leader 
into the government -- if it were possible to accommodate the 
code of the opposition -- would make it possible to excuse him. 
On the other hand, it is possible that an opposition leader 
entering the government would be turned into one of today's 
shadow cadres. Muhammad Solih did not accept the "high rank" 
because he does not accept the government's policy of arbitrary 
action and terror. 
  As for Sh. Karimov and S. Yigitaliyev, they have begun to 
follow a path of rapprochement with the government. Undoubtedly, 
their personal interests have caused this. Had Muhammad Solih 
left the party ranks and they themselves became the leaders, 
they would have accepted the "high rank" because, unlike 
Muhammad Solih, they would not have the courage to reject rank 
for belief. The historian Sh. Karimov must have planned entering 
history this way all of a sudden. 
  I have sound reasons for saying this. Events I witnessed 
personally before and after the Congress can prove it.. 
<H5>  II. </H5>
  It was the beginning of September 1993. I was called to the 
office of the chief physician; he said that presidential advisor 
Mavlon Umrzokov was coming to Termez and said he wanted to meet 
with me. I went to the offices of the viloyat administration at 
the appointed time. Professor Sh. Karimov was waiting for me 
here. He said "we came with Mavlon Umrzakov," and stressed the 
word "Umrzakov." We went into a separate room and conversed. Sh. 
Karimov talked about the situation which had manifested itself 
in the party, and began to heap all the party's sins on Muhammad 
Solih. "We have to massage the president and the governors, and 
act on our own policy," said Sh. Karimov. "We have to examine 
this issue at the party congress and reelect the leadership." I 
understood Sh. Karimov's goal but kept my own council. If I had 
protested to him or expressed my ideas openly, it would have 
become known to those in this government and endangered my 
participation in the congress... "The congress will resolve 
everything," I said to Sh. Karimov. Our talk did not last long 
"Mavlon has to hold a meeting," said Karimov. "Let us go and 
join them..." 
  We went outside and ran into one of the viloyat leaders. "We 
can talk about everything with Namoz," said Sh. Karimov. "If God 
wishes, our congress will go well." I was surprised at this talk 
because the date of the congress had still not been announced. 
Above all, what was the connection of the viloyat head with our 
congress? 
  We went with Sh. Karimov to the reception room of the 
viloyat 
governor's office where he had to meet with M. Umrzokov. We sat 
down in the room. Whenever we heard a voice, Sh. Karimov rushed 
outside. He would come back in and say "Mavlon still has not 
arrived." This happened a number of times. Finally, they said 
that M. Umrzokov had arrived. I kept sitting in my place. As for 
Sh. Karimov, he said "I am ready" and hurried to the meeting 
with another person. But he quickly returned and said "They said 
that Mavlon is in a hurry and cannot meet with us." Sh. Karimov 
and M. Umrzokov returned to Tashkent together. The fact that the 
presidential advisor and Sh. Karimov traveled on the same road 
together has symbolic meaning because the roads we select and 
the road the present government selects are completely 
different... 
  I found out later that during Sh. Karimov's "trip" to 
Kashkadaryo the "Erkists" claimed that Samad Murod did not agree 
to his proposal. At this, Sh. Karimov said "if he does not 
agree, we will beat him up." Sh. Karimov kept his word. After 
the Congress Samad Murod was brutally beaten. This is the true 
face of Professor Sh. Karimov! "Professor"-terrorist! This event 
is clear proof that he is working together with the security 
organs to destroy Erk as an opposition party. In this way Sh. 
Karimov also wrote a report to the Ministry of Internal Affairs 
about recognizing ERK member Safar Bekjon, who is now sitting in 
prison, from Ellikkala, and stated this himself at a meeting of 
the Khorazm Viloyat chapter of the ERK DP. 
  Now "professors" like him have organized a new party. We 
have 
no doubt that it is an organization of KGB agents... 
  Before we went to the congress Jovburi Abdulhakimov, first 
deputy governor of the viloyat, summoned me to his office. 
Because this person had only recently been appointed to his 
position we were unacquainted. "The ERK Congress should be held 
soon, do you know anything about it?" he asked. I said I did 
have information about it. J. Abdulhakimov talked a long time 
about the president's policy. Finally, he said: "Now the 
president is God, no one can stand against him...Your leaders 
are insignificant next to him. Thus, my advice to you is to 
think about what you do at the Congress... Recently an ERKist 
professor came to Termez (he meant Sh. Karimov). If you were to 
elect such a man as that to the leadership, it would be 
acceptable." 
  The deputy governor repeatedly ordered me not to stare at 
him 
sullenly or look to the viloyat leaders. Naturally, I could not 
protest strongly to J. Abdulhakimov. Had I done that, I would 
have been imprisoned on the spot and could not have taken part 
in the congress. It is true, however, that I read the letter of 
party leader Muhammad Solih at the congress and bothered the 
deputy governor thusly. 
<H5>  III </H5>
  I do not conceal the fact that, when I went to Tashkent to 
take part in the congress. it was with a feeling of trepidation 
that something would happen there. When Sh. Karimov and S. 
Yigitaliyev had reached an arrangement with the government, I 
know that they had traveled through all the viloyats. As it 
became known later, none of the ERKists went to speak to them. 
Talks I held with Hamidullah Nurmuhammad, secretary of the ERK 
Party's Central Council, Nasrullo Said, secretary of the Bukhara 
viloyat's central council, Samad Murod, secretary of the 
Kashkadaryo viloyat council, and Sulaymon Murod, secretary of 
the Samarkand viloyat council confirmed this. A day before the 
congress a meeting of the party executive committee was held at 
which Central Council secretaries and party viloyat secretaries 
attended. Sh. Karimov and S. Yigitaliyev also took part in the 
committee meeting. We went over the planned organization and 
daily agenda. The Central Council committee decided that Council 
Secretary Otanazar Oripov would open the congress and I would 
read the letter of the party leader. In an article in KHALK SOZI 
S. Yigitaliyev sid: "Despite the sentence passed against 
Otanazar Oripov, he opened the party congress. Is this respect 
for the law?" First, Professor Otanazar Oripov was judged by 
lies. And then, the Central Council committee told him to chair 
the congress meeting. And S. Yigitaliyev voiced no protest over 
this at the committee meeting... 
  The congress was opened at 10 a.m. on 25 September, 1993 at 
the Railroad Workers Palace of Culture in Tashkent. The 
executive committee, mandate commission, and other commissions 
were elected. The daily agenda was confirmed. Central Council 
Secretary and Chairman Professor Otanazar Oripov read 
congratulatory telegrams from leaders of political parties in 
foreign countries and introduced the congress guests to the 
delegates. Among the guests were Kirgizboyev of the presidential 
office and representatives from the Tashkent city governate and 
representatives from political parties and movements as well as 
the well known poet Dadakhon Hasan and Shukhrat Ismatullayev, 
cochairman of the BIRLIK people's movement. Correspondents from 
the republic and foreign press came to cover the congress. 
  The meeting was turned over to me to read the party leader's 
letter. The sociopolitical situation in the republic was briefly 
analyzed in the letter, repressions directed against the 
opposition were criticized, and the fact that the ERK Party will 
not deviate from the road to freedom was reconfirmed. 
  Congress delegates listened to the letter attentively. I 
have 
to say that the letter added spirit to the delegates' spirit and 
strength to their strength. I should add that the discussions 
which began after the letter was read continued in this spirit. 
All viloyat delegates, including S. Yigitaliyev, took part in 
the discussions. The cochairman of the BIRLIK People's Movement 
Shukhrat Ismatullayev spoke. Kirgizboyev, the responsible 
official from the presidential office, gave a report for half an 
hour. This is clear proof that the congress was held in a 
democratic manner. Sh. Karimov's words were repudiated by the 
delegates, and he was driven from the podium by prolonged 
clapping and catcalls because he renounced his party principles 
to the congress, found common language with the government for 
his own personal interests, and had gone down the path of open 
betrayal. 
  After a recess congress delegates discussed questions of 
making changes in the party statutes. S. Yigitaliyev 
participated in this actively. The powers of the party leader 
were abbreviated in the statutes. 
  The last question was reelections to the party Central 
Council. Three party members from every viloyat were elected to 
the Central Council. After this the congress delegates passed on 
to the question of electing the party leader. Muhammad Solih's 
candidacy was endorsed unanimously and welcomed with applause. 
Both Sh. Karimov and S. Yigitaliyev was taken aback by this 
endorsement of Muhammad Solih. When the congress chairman asked: 
"Any against or abstaining?" No one raised their hand. Why did 
party members support Muhammad Solih to this extent? Because he 
is the true leader of Uzbekistan's democrats. When it comes to 
the question of leadership, there are many who want the job, but 
few true leaders. Leaders manifest themselves not through their 
own person, but through the people. The leader does not vote for 
himself, the people vote for him. Sh. Karimov and S. Yigitaliyev 
wanted to be leaders themselves; they came to the ERK congress 
and were thrown into confusion. After this they have tried to 
besmirch Muhammad Solih and the ERK Party. If the ERK Party 
leader did not recognize himself in the leadership, the people 
did and followed him, and no one else. Even before Uzbekistan 
entered its "reconstruction" Muhammad Solih was recognized by 
the people through his poems and articles on the national 
struggle. If he was on Central Committee Ideology Secretary R. 
Abdullayeva's "blacklist" during the time of I. Osmankhojayev, 
and on Central Committee Secretary Anishchev's "blacklist during 
the time of R. Nishanov, so is he now on I. Karimov's 
"blacklist." As Sh. Karimov has written, after Muhammad Solih's 
talent and activities became known he organized ERK. 
  ...The last question at the congress was electing a general 
secretary of the party's Central Council. A number of party 
members put forward their candidacy for the general 
secretaryship. Among them were Otanazar Oripov, Ibrohim Hakkul, 
Shodi Karimov, Sodikjon Yigitaliyev, Samad Murod, and myself. 
Everybody but Samad Murod withdrew their candidacy and he was 
elected general secretary. Why did not Sh. Karimov and S. 
Yigitaliyev put up a fight for the position of general 
secretary? There are a number of reasons for this. First, they 
were burdened by the government with the duty of distancing 
Muhammad Solih from the party leadership. They were unable to do 
this at the congress. Second, had they put up their names for 
the general secretaryship, they only would have received two 
votes; i.e., S. Yigitaliyev would have voted for Sh. Karimov and 
Sh. Karimov would have voted for S. Yigitaliyev. The congress 
delegates are men of high principle and spiritual purity. A vote 
by them for hypocrisy is unthinkable. When we come to Samad 
Murod, who was elected general secretary of the ERK DP, he is 
one of the inspired sons of the nation who has struggle for the 
independence of the fatherland and democracy. Samad Murod was 
put under pressure for his views and imprisoned. After having 
been elected general secretary of the party, they beat him 
mercilessly. Despite this, he continues to fulfill his duties. 
<H5>  IV </H5>
  The last decisions of the congress were ratified. 
  On the day after the end of the congress, I returned to 
Termez. It was Sunday, the 26th of September. Later, there was a 
loud knocking on my door. I opened it, and a policeman stood 
there. "I am Officer Berdiyev," he said. "You are to go with me 
to the court." I said: "I am not going anywhere" and sent the 
policeman on his way. An hour later the chief of police 
accompanied by some of his officers came and took me to the 
viloyat internal affairs offices. Viloyat Chief of Internal 
Affairs Colonel Sharipov and viloyat department chief of the 
National Security Service Bozorov began to ask me questions. I 
refused to answer their questions and demanded to meet with the 
viloyat Governor Jora Noraliyev. The next morning more police 
came and took me to Sharipov's office. I expressed my wish to 
meet face to face with the governor. Viloyat Governor J. 
Horaliyev sent Colonel Sharipov out of his office and we began 
to talk. As we were talking First Deputy Governor Jovburi 
Abdulhakimov came in. He had an angry face and was obviously 
incensed. He did not sit down but came over to me and asked, 
"You confuse me. Who gave you permission to read Muhammad 
Solih's report?" I said to Governor Noraliyev "if this person 
does not change his tone of voice, nothing will come out of our 
talk." The deputy became even angrier: "What are you? You are 
the son of a peasant. Why do you keep silent about what you are 
doing?" Without saying good-bye, I left the governor's office. 
  The next day national security officials paid a visit to the 
Termez offices of the ERK Party and removed all our papers. They 
sealed the door of our offices. A few days later a trusted 
friend who works in the government came to me, sayingthat they 
were opening a criminal case against me and that, if I did not 
leave the viloyat, I was in danger of being thrown in 
prison...On 10 October I left Termez secretly.

<F P=106> [Article by Muhammad Solih: "Critical Views of </F>
Independence"] 
  [Text] On a spring day in 1992 we passed through Lenin 
Square in Toshkent together with the Leningrad poet Viktor 
Sosnora and stopped by the massive statue there. 
  The Russian poet, staring at the statue, suddenly asked: 
"Will we ever see the destruction of spiritual tyranny?" This 
question was not an unexpected one. This is a question familiar 
to all the enslaved peoples in the Soviet empire. 
  Laughing, I gave the answer: "Sure, this statue will be 
destroyed, but when it is destroyed and crashes to the ground 
into thousands of pieces of cast iron and marble, then I will be 
afraid." 
  I could not have imagined that this joke would turn into 
reality before even ten years had past because the Soviet empire 
was perceived as a powerful fortress which no power on earth 
could destroy. 
  To be sure, Gorbachev did not come to the government to 
dismantle the empire, nor did Yeltsin. On the contrary, they 
came to reform this "fortress," to turn it into a modern empire. 
  In fact, as the Russian chauvinists say, not even America 
could bring it down. The force that destroyed it was history, or 
something controlling history, the possessor of an iron law 
outside of man's will. We call this law the will of Allah. 
  I mean to say that today Uzbekistan has attained its 
political independence, and our people are indebted to no one 
for this independence. Independence is only Allah's blessing and 
we are only indebted to Him. 
  Is our people worthy of this blessing? 
  Absolutely. 
  This people survived 135 years in Russia's bondage. Over 
this 
long time, Turkestan sacrificed millions of its youths for 
freedom, and the bravest and most courageous of our people were 
martyrs on the road to freedom. 
  What kind of people were these people? 
  What kind of bravery did these people, who would take a gun 
in their hand or if they could not find a gun would take up a 
club, have to rise up against an empire armed with modern 
weapons? 
  They were brave because they had feelings of faith, 
fatherland, freedom, and normal human pride in their hearts. 
Thus, the empire acted to kill these people's pride and, to a 
certain extent, succeeded. The lack of faith and pride today is 
buried under all the spiritual, political, and economic 
corruption in our life. 
  Let me go on and speak openly. We are now in such a state 
that, if tomorrow a Russian or another government comes along 
and begins to reimpose tyranny, we would not have the will to 
rise up against it. 
  Today our mood is known. Today the government can issue any 
decree it wants and impose tyranny on the people, if it wants, 
and the society will not stand up and say "respected government, 
you have made a mistake!" 
  The present government names the minister it wants, and 
insults him if it wishes, but the minister does not open his 
mouth and defend his honor because he has no faith, no pride. 
  A nation made up of such persons could easily endure the 
tyranny of another nation. 
  The decline of man's will, the lack of honor and faith in 
our 
society -- this is an ugly heritage left over from the Russian 
empire. The time has come to save ourselves from this 
"inheritance." 
  Now our nation must be recognized as a nation the equal of 
that of other nations and must learn to demand from every 
government its own rights appropriate to this. 
  God knows, three years ago I said to President Karimov 
"first 
let us be free of Moscow's tyranny, and then if you demonstrate 
tyranny, we will fight against your tyranny." These words were 
half truth and half a joke. Now the joke is gone but the truth 
remains. 
  In Uzbekistan the communist order did not change and we have 
fought against it from the beginning. 
  We are in the opposition. We are not personal enemies of the 
president. We are enemies of the old order the president is 
defending. We are not demanding the resignation of the 
president, we are demanding the retirement of a transgressor 
order. This order does not look to the future of our Republic, 
but toward the past; it is a barrier to opening up the people's 
potential. Society has sunk deeply into corruption and 
injustice. It has taught the people spiritual humility. 
<H5>  ON UZBEKISTAN'S DOMESTIC POLICY </H5>
  When I criticized this policy, I never intended to say that 
the general problems, which are special to all the old republics 
such as the economic difficulties, are the fault of the present 
government. On the contrary, I am criticizing it for reviving 
the old totalitarian order under the pretext of the problems 
left over from the past. 
  Other republics, despite these problems, are acting with all 
their capability to lay the foundations for their peoples' 
future. 
  If Uzbekistan's order is not changed, the laughable 
"democratic Russia" and "democratic Kyrgyzstan," which is always 
said sarcastically, will achieve economic progress before us. At 
the same time, we are sitting around and protecting our poverty 
with the police. 
  This regime is not changing: either it resigns or the people 
drive it from the government. The people's punishment will be 
meted out when a new government replaces the old. 
  One cannot say that the present government passed to the 
people when the old one disgraced itself. This suffering people 
is reliving the past problems of totalitarianism. 
  For four and a half years now this government has been 
repeating the saying: "you cannot build a new house until the 
old one is demolished." It is quite true. We have grasped this 
piece of wisdom now for four and a half years and hoped that as 
long as there is peace, everything will be fine. But our hopes 
have been dashed: it is known that our government has no 
intention of building a "new house." It intends to repair the 
shack remaining from the Soviet empire, and is unable to do 
this. We have not gone forward, we have gone backwards. 
  This backward movement has not just begun. The movement 
began 
after the entire government in Uzbekistan passed into the hands 
of one person -- after the presidential elections. 
  Up to the elections, the government comported itself as if 
it 
were somewhat liberal, and imbued with the people's ideas. Until 
the election, the government had listened to the opinions of the 
Supreme Assembly and the peoples deputies and its policies 
advanced because of this. People's representatives could express 
their recommendations on the social and political conditions in 
our country, and this situation was very important in the life 
of the government. 
  Had this mood of freedom continued, the Supreme Assembly, 
the 
people's deputies, and the political parties would undoubtedly 
have helped the government overcome the problems which had 
emerged. National unity would have turned into reality. 
  After the new government was elected, it began to view every 
kind of opinion, but its own in a hostile manner. Its first act 
after the elections was bloodshed: students who demonstrated to 
show their dissatisfaction with the increase in the price of 
food on 16 January 1992 were shot. 
  Then, attacks on the opposition parties began. Members of 
ERK, BIRLIK, and religious functionaries were persecuted without 
basis, and cases of imprisonment began to occur. 
  1992 was a bad year for the opposition: BIRLIK was banned, 
the ERK party's money and printing press were confiscated 
illegally. First, five viloyat newspapers of this party, then 
the central ERK newspaper was closed. 
  Although hundreds of complaints came into the Republic 
administration about these arbitrary actions, not one was 
answered because it was the administration itself which was 
doing these arbitrary actions. 
  The life of opposition members who was not imprisoned was 
turned into a living hell. They constantly lived under 
persecution by spies and provocation. 
  In brief, Uzbekistan turned into a country of spies, 
investigators, and prosecutors. 
  At a time when our people are groaning under poverty, the 
government is spending a substantial part of the national budget 
for the material needs of the police and the KGB. 
  Certainly, our state has to have powerful and well equipped 
security organs. The opposition wants this, too. But if this 
equipment is not built on social justice, the people will not 
respected these organs, but curse them. 
  In no city in the world except ours do the police rove in 
bands. One of my foreign friends asked me: "Why are there so 
many police on the street, was there an incident?" I was unable 
to answer, because there was no incident; they were afraid that 
an incident would occur. 
  The police are increasing because those dissatisfied with 
the 
government are increasing. In the same was that persecutions are 
increasing, so are the numbers of people thrown in prison 
increasing. This is not the fault of the police, it is the fault 
of the government which is afraid of its own people. 
  Because of this, the government's control over this 
dissatisfaction serves to increase the dissatisfaction. The 
government, essentially, is afraid of its own shadow. 
<H5>  THE UGLY SCENE IN THE REPUBLIC'S ECONOMIC LIFE </H5>
  Although a law privatizing property has already been passed, 
privatization has not even begun. All of the companies that 
opened two years ago are now closed. The market did not break 
down under the influence of the laws, it was closed down by the 
government. 
  Consumer goods, including food products, are not readily 
available. Foreign trade is not in the hands of the state, but 
has been passed on the relatives of the mighty. The greatest 
part of the income from foreign trade does not find its way into 
the national treasury, but into the pockets of unknown persons. 
  Foreign companies will not move into Uzbekistan because we 
have no unified economic policy and they have no faith in the 
guarantees of the government. 
  The most frightening thing is that the economic mechanism in 
the Republic does not operate; it is crippled by bribery, 
nepotism, and corruption. 
  But the government is inviting foreign capitalists in, 
saying: "Come to us, we have political unanimity, and bring your 
capital!" But how long can one oil a rusted chain with the oil 
of political unanimity? And who will guarantee that this chain 
will not suddenly fall apart? 
  Is political unanimity held together by force secure or is 
it 
dangerous for the people and the government? 
  True unanimity is a unanimity built on the agreement of all 
groups in the society, and only with this kind of political 
unanimity is there a basis for a strong economy. 
  The time of the appropriateness of economic liberalism and 
political authoritarianism has passed. Some of the newly 
independent states cannot achieve economic development through 
the old model, or the model of South Korea or Chile because 
between the 1960s and the 1990s mankind entered into an 
historically unprecedented dynamic that does not fit into the 
old molds. Every political leader and every government must 
understand this historical situation deeply. 
  Today's political repressions have done more damage to 
Uzbekistan than bribery and corruption, because the capital and 
credits which are a life necessity to Uzbekistan are not coming 
in under these circumstances.

  [Text] ON UZBEKISTAN'S CADRE POLICY 
  Uzbekistan has opted for the classic path of a totalitarian 
state in its cadre policy: cadres change their position every 
one or two years. If an official sits in his chair too long, 
this will not turn into power. The government does not believe 
in its officials, and the officials do not believe in the 
government. Officials who have understood the security of their 
profession are compelled to think not of the state, but of their 
own pockets. They solicit bribes and function poorly because 
even if they did their jobs well, their labors would not be 
esteemed. They conceal themselves in meetings so the boss will 
not notice them. In this way they automatically sabotage the 
work, continuity is lost, production speed drops; this, once 
again, reflects the material situation of the people. 
<H5>  ON SOCIAL POLICY </H5>
  This sector is one in which our government takes pride. It 
is 
also true that this sector is one in which our government has 
not worked out a program. The government is not on top of events 
in this sector, it lags behind them. 
  The government does not fear the poverty or the hunger of 
the 
people, it fears their dissatisfaction. Thus, it acts to please 
social groups which are potentially dangerous: students, 
teachers, Russian workers and Russian officials. 
  In Uzbekistan 6 million 770 thousand people are working. Of 
these, some fifty percent are workers in various sectors, 16.3 
percent in industry, and 32 percent, or almost one-third, are in 
agriculture. 
  This 32 percent are our peasants. Although wages of urban 
workers and bureaucrats has risen ten times, that of peasants 
has risen only once. In addition, peasants have not received 
this wage for three or four months. Whatever their social 
guarantees are, they are not demanding them. 
  These people do not know what social justice is: when they 
government speaks about it proudly on television, they do not 
know what pride it is talking about. 
<H5>  ON UZBEKISTAN'S FOREIGN POLICY </H5>
  The minister of foreign affairs has been changed three times 
in the last two years. Has this measure been any good for our 
foreign policy? 
  Let us take the last minister who was removed for example: 
  In may of 1993 the police or the KGB detained an Uzbek woman 
at Tashkent airport and beat her up. This woman had been working 
at the U.S. Embassy. The embassy protested to Uzbekistan's 
government, but this protest received no answer. To top it off, 
Uzbekistan's Ministry of Foreign Affairs issued a statement to 
the press, saying that "responsibility for this occurrence must 
be borne by the embassy itself." 
  This situation made no contribution to either diplomacy or 
policy. 
  In response to this, the American government expelled a 
delegation of Uzbek delegates headed by the chairman of the 
Supreme Council who had been invited to visit the United States 
from the country, Subsequently, Uzbekistan's government, in 
order to ingratiate itself with the United States, replaced the 
foreign minister who had only recently been appointed. In fact, 
both the minister and the miserable person who had beaten up the 
woman had followed the orders of the government. These failures 
in foreign policy were a result of the arbitrary action in 
domestic policy. 
  When Uzbekistan declared its independence, countries of the 
world began to view this country with great interest. Uzbekistan 
has many natural resources, its economic potential is vast, and 
it is an historical and cultural center. 
  Under these historical circumstances, Uzbekistan needs a 
strong foreign policy. We need a strong and independent, 
intelligent, and unified foreign policy. 
  Unfortunately, the government has not, and cannot, follow 
such a policy because it has destroyed its influence in the 
world through anti-democratic actions in its domestic policy. 
  Uzbekistan has embassies in four or five countries of the 
world. Some of the embassies are not able to state their 
relationship to world events. Uzbekistan's government has not 
even stated its own position with regard to the countries of the 
world. 
  Iraq attacked Kuwait. Uzbekistan did not state its view of 
this aggression. The United States bombed Iraq. Uzbekistan did 
not say whose side it was on. Armenian occupied Azerbaijan's 
soil. Uzbekistan did not state its position on this. 
  Half a year ago Uzbekistan's president with a large 
delegation went to Saudi Arabia, stayed in luxury hotels, and 
enjoyed themselves, and...returned with nothing -- an agreement 
which would aid Uzbekistan's economy was not drawn up because 
Uzbekistan has no opinion and no definite policy on Saudi 
Arabia. The government, embittered by the failure of this trip, 
expelled a group of Saudi Arabians who had come to the country. 
As a consequence, relations between the two countries have been 
severed. 
  In May of this year our president traveled to Germany. At a 
request from the Mercedes-Benz company, the German Government 
received I. Karimov. The German press made fun of this 
reception: "If you want to see a dictator, do not go to Latin 
America, come to our own Stuttgart, because Karimov is arriving 
here tomorrow." 
  Recently President Karimov put 32 tons of Uzbekistan's gold 
in a French bank, and, for this, he was received as an official 
guest for the first time in a Western country. But if every 
foreign journey of Karimov costs 32 tons of gold, we will soon 
be out of gold. 
  To sum up, Uzbekistan's foreign policy is the mirror image 
of 
its domestic policy. Our people have a saying: "If your face is 
crooked, do not kiss the mirror. We do not have the right to 
exchange kisses with another country.

<F P=106> [Interview with Anatoliy Chubays, deputy prime minister of </F>
the Government of Russia, by unidentified ARGUMENTY I FAKTY 
correspondent; place and date not given: "Zhirinovskiy's Plot?"] 
  [Text] A few days ago EFIR-DAIDZHEST reported that 
Anatoliy Chubays, deputy prime minister of the Government of 
Russia, speaking on a British television program, said that 
there exists a plot aimed at bringing V. Zhirinovskiy into power 
in our country no later than this coming fall. We asked A. 
Chubays to explain what he meant. 
  [ARGUMENTY I FAKTY] What sources do you have for such 
contentions? 
  [Chubays] The sources of information are quite simple: A 
special trait of figures like Zhirinovskiy is that they cannot 
keep their mouth shut, which lets them down, especially when 
they publish in "their" publications. They get a little "carried 
away" and say things they had not intended to say. 
  I have in my possession the newspaper ZAVTRA, which 
published 
a dialogue between A. Prokhanov and Mr. Zhirinovskiy. In it, 
Zhirinovskiy states: "...and in Russia, in order to wake up the 
Russian nation, it can be awaken by bloodshed." I think this 
statement does not need any comment. 
  Next A. Prokhanov asks V. Zhirinovskiy: "You mean that 
reintegration will occur through the tragedy of these people?" 
(meaning unification of the former USSR republics). V. 
Zhirinovskiy replies: "Through death! The death of millions of 
Tajiks, Georgians, Uzbeks." I want to draw your attention also 
to the title of this material: "I Will Move Into the Kremlin!" 
He also names the time frame--this coming fall. 
  I did not invent all this--I simply reproduced what Vladimir 
Volfovich himself said. 
  It is interesting to see how he reacted to my comments in 
the 
BBC program. This is what REUTER writes. V. Zhirinovskiy is 
asked: "What is your reaction to what A. Chubays said?" He 
replies: "Chubays told the truth. He is absolutely right." Next 
he says that there have been two putsches: "These two putsches 
were without our participation, and that is why they failed. 
With our participation, victory will be ensured. The third time 
will be with our participation." 
  What follows from this? It is obvious that these people 
understand very well that the only way for them to come to power 
is through bloodshed. It is clear that they will attempt to 
provoke this bloodshed. Of course, all our economic 
difficulties, all problems are fertile soil for them, on which 
they have grown in the first place. The worse the economic 
situation, the better it is for them, the more chances that they 
will be able to rock the boat and "move into the Kremlin" in the 
fall. Why in the fall? So far there are no presidential 
elections scheduled for the fall. They are scheduled for 1996. 
If a political figure, a leader of a party, says "I will move 
into the Kremlin in the fall," it means that he is speaking of 
an unconstitutional method of seizing power. All other words: 
"by peaceful means," "people themselves will carry me in," "I 
will be given a ticket to move into the Kremlin"--these are just 
window dressing to cover the plot. 
  That is why I see this situation as so serious. And I treat 
it not as empty bantering but as a slip Zhirinovskiy has made 
regarding plans that are actually being hatched by his 
supporters. And I am convinced that both government bodies and 
public organizations should treat it seriously. The president 
has already said that he will watch carefully over any actions 
violating the law, on the part of both those who have been 
amnestied and those who are in cohort with them. 
  Our actions with respect to setting up the Russia's Choice 
Party are directly linked with this. We do not need a debating 
club that discusses various general political problems--we need 
a well-defined political structure with a staff, cadres, 
communications, and finances, capable of providing resistance to 
provocation. We can only fight this threat by united efforts: of 
the state, which resorts to the enforcement apparatus in the 
event the law is violated, and social forces, for which the road 
of plots is unacceptable. 
  [ARGUMENTY I FAKTY] It is strange to hear a reformer predict 
V. Zhirinovskiy's victory. 
  [Chubays] I never said Zhirinovskiy would win, because I am 
convinced that fascism cannot win in Russia--at least legally. I 
do not believe that Russia will ever give its vote to a fascist 
leader. For me it is also impossible because I am a son of a 
military man who fought the war from 22 June 1941 to 9 May 1945. 
As to the threat of fascism, I spoke of it as long ago as 13 
December 1993.

<F P=106> [Interview with Vladimir Shumeyko, chairman of the </F>
Federation Council of the Federal Assembly of the Russian 
Federation, by unidentified ARGUMENTY I FAKTY correspondent(s); 
place and date not given: "V. Shumeyko: When We Have Stability, 
Wealth Will Follow"] 
  [Text] [ARGUMENTY I FAKTY] Vladimir Filippovich, we hear 
that political chaos is reigning in the country; that we cannot 
live like this anymore. Is it so difficult to find the way to an 
accord? 
  [Shumeyko] Yes, political chaos does indeed exist. Russia is 
currently going through a peak in politician activism while 
voter activism has hit the bottom. Voter activism has dropped in 
both the democratic camp and among the opposition. For instance, 
in St. Petersburg there were 750 candidates for 50 seats in the 
Duma. At that point Sobchak permitted a rally to be held against 
these elections at the request of four parties of communist 
orientation. They wanted to bring out 15,000 people at the 
Palace Square. At the designated time, 22 persons showed up. It 
became clear that people are tired of this all. Politicians have 
completely lost touch with real life. 
  [ARGUMENTY I FAKTY] You have lived through two putsches: one 
inside the "White House" and one outside it. What do you think? 
Will you survive the third? 
  [Shumeyko] I think there will not be a third one. There are 
no preconditions for it today. 
  [ARGUMENTY I FAKTY] On 4 April it is six months since the 
tragic October events. Was it possible to avoid them? 
  [Shumeyko] At the negotiations the evening of Friday, 1 
October, the White House defenders set a condition: to hold 
early presidential elections on 12 December. When the president 
was told about this condition, he said that for the sake of 
national accord he would be willing to run for reelection any 
time. 
  Those in the White House learned about it, and the 
opposition's main trump card was rendered void. This is when the 
events began to escalate instantly. A demonstration moved from 
October Square to the White House and began storming the Comecon 
building. A convoy took off for Ostankino at the same time. 
  We spent the whole night deciding what to do. We could not 
let events spill out further from Moscow across Russia. A civil 
war in an industrially developed state, where any power station, 
chemical enterprise, or defense plant may be blown up is 
suicide. As if we did not have enough with Chernobyl. 
  [ARGUMENTY I FAKTY] But violence eventually had to be 
stopped 
by even greater violence--tanks. 
  [Shumeyko] Our plan was predicated on the assumption that 
Rutskoy is a military man, not a politician. If, in the morning, 
a professional military man sees tanks with guns trained on him, 
he understands perfectly well that they will fire. It is time to 
surrender. But Rutskoy hoped that there would be those who would 
defend him. The people, however, were not jumping under these 
tanks, and did not rise to defend Rutskoy and Khasbulatov. And 
when the besieged were told "Come out with a white flag," 
machine-gun fire came from a White House window. The first shell 
from a tank went to the window from which machine-gun fire was 
coming. After that there was again a pause, designed for the 
reaction of a military man who is given time to change his mind. 
Because if it is war, the shelling will continue until victory. 
  To tell the truth, nobody expected the besieged to start 
military action. The army did not want to start this war. I get 
indignant when people say that Yerin showed himself as a weak 
man and the troops did not shoot. Do you think it is easy to 
make a soldier shoot at his own people? 
  Now I think: Rutskoy is a professional, you cannot take that 
away from him, but he was not in control of the situation in 
there. I am certain of it. Because if parliament defends the 
constitution, but at the same time allows fascists to defend 
itself (remember Barkashov people with swastikas on their 
sleeves), what kind of law, what constitution, what parliament 
are we talking about? The constitution says that even fascist 
propaganda is impermissible. 
  [ARGUMENTY I FAKTY] But, on the other hand, the constitution 
does not say that you can fire at the elected parliament. 
  [Shumeyko] I agree with you unequivocally. But neither does 
the constitution say that you can allow a civil war to happen. 
What I will say may sound cynical: An aircraft went down; 75 
people died. We have lived through this tragedy--what can we do 
about it? There were 120 people who died around the White House. 
Yes, I am sorry for them. But Russia was saved at this price, 
since civil peace was restored. Everything we did, we did right. 
  [ARGUMENTY I FAKTY] And you think that the memory of those 
October days subconsciously prompts all political forces to 
accord? 
  [Shumeyko] Accord is inherent in today's life. Nobody wants 
any more of these battles. Ordinary people understand better 
than politicians that Russia can be turned only once in a 
century, Russia, like a huge ship, has just turned toward 
reforms. And now what; turn back? 
  [ARGUMENTY I FAKTY] Can an accord be reached at the time of 
intensive fight for power? 
  [Shumeyko] It is easier to seize power when everything is 
collapsing. To gain it in a democratic way--through 
elections--naturally, is difficult. But more honorable. Then let 
us first strengthen this authority. The institution of the 
presidency is the youngest in the state. There has always been a 
czar. After the czar, general secretary--the same czar. For the 
first time democratic presidential authority was born in Russia. 
When it gets stronger, then let us go for it in a democratic 
way. But there are many who do not want to strengthen it! 
  [ARGUMENTY I FAKTY] Since you have become a Russian deputy, 
you also have been near the helm of power all the time. It was 
probably not easy to be Khasbulatov's deputy, was it? 
  [Shumeyko] After I was made his deputy, our relations became 
difficult right away. Before the Sixth Congress he told me that 
we will need to speak up and defeat Gaydar's government. I told 
him that I have a different opinion: Gaydar's government does 
what is necessary and possible only in this today's situation. 
Shock therapy is beyond the point. We do not have it; nobody has 
launched any shock therapy. It would not occur to any of us with 
our socialist-economic thinking to suddenly free prices. And 
Gaydar was right in proposing to free prices for everything at 
the same time. But, we did not agree... The main achievement of 
our reforms is that the market got 76 percent saturated at 
prices that are higher than world prices. Now we can develop our 
own producer. At the time, though, the country was on the brink 
of complete collapse and ruin... Now some people say that Gaydar 
is at fault, that Yeltsin is at fault, that they have destroyed 
the entire economy and the state. They saved it. It was the CPSU 
that had been destroying it. 
  [ARGUMENTY I FAKTY] And what about the money that is flowing 
abroad--the money for natural resources, the people's wealth? 
  [Shumeyko] And why do foreign investors not invest money in 
the Russian economy? They will not invest a kopek as long as 
they see that our own people open accounts abroad! And they do 
it because they have no idea how things will develop here. They 
allow for the possibility that the day may come when their money 
will be taken away and everything will return to the way it was. 
  [ARGUMENTY I FAKTY] Why can the government not earn credit 
for such confidence that our people would keep their money here 
and foreign investors would not mind investing in the Russian 
economy? 
  [Shumeyko] You cannot change people overnight. The West 
looks 
at us the same way: Today one thing is happening, tomorrow--a 
different one, and the day after tomorrow--different again. When 
it stabilizes we will invest the money; no stability--even the 
rich compatriots will leave, together with families, and will 
live abroad. People are people; they simply do not believe. 
Since there is no accord in the country, there is no peace, no 
stabilization; so why should one keep his money here? 
  [ARGUMENTY I FAKTY] Your charm gets you out of any 
adversity. 
But even in your life there have been situations when everything 
was against you. You are so smart--how could you get into a jam? 
  [Shumeyko] I have certainly been through some. Especially 
with the Procuracy. I asked then to relieve me temporarily of my 
job so I could sort it out. I have never had a harder time in my 
life. When they brought a document to me and asked: "Is this 
your signature?" I said: "Mine."--"It is not a forgery?"--"No, 
it is my signature. But I have never put my signature on this 
text." The saddest part is that there is a number of documents 
against, for instance, Rutskoy, or myself, which has been made 
in the same place, at the order of the same people. This is the 
most depressing part. Because Rutskoy by himself had never been 
the person he became. We shape ourselves, and others, 
too--depending on how easy they are to shape. And history shapes 
us all. 
  [ARGUMENTY I FAKTY] You are again in the presidium, and now 
before you is not a congress, not the former parliament, but 
essentially a small group of people--the Federation Council. Can 
accord be reached with them? 
  [Shumeyko] Today it is the president who offers accord. And 
if the chief politician believes that Russia is ready for this 
accord, it is already indicative. He could not offer such a 
thing earlier. In the Federation Council we have politicians of 
high rank. Sixty-seven percent of them are people who have real 
authority. This accord is addressed to them today. Even the 
communist "branch" offered its text of accord for the sake of 
Russia. The president understands that there cannot be two or 
three accords. There can only be one. Either it is there or it 
is not. When Chernomyrdin came for the first time to the 
Federation Council, he said that the Japanese, when they were 
pulling out of economic backwardness, worked without a single 
day off, 12 hours a day. And the entire Federation Council 
applauded. It was seen that a watershed has been reached: 
Everybody understood that it was time, that we had to get to 
work. 
  This is precisely that element of accord that showed in the 
emotions. This mood gave away all politicians: We are tired of 
it; let us find accord and begin working. 
  [ARGUMENTY I FAKTY] Former U.S. President Nixon says that 
Zhirinovskiy, with his demagoguery and rudeness, will never 
become president of Russia. Chubays says that Zhirinovskiy 
intends to become president by this fall. In your opinion, does 
he have a chance? 
  [Shumeyko] Zhirinovskiy's style is not clownery--it is the 
theory of populism. Its meaning is that a person must proclaim 
himself in as shocking a way as possible, such as in a play 
staged by a talented director. People forget in a week what he 
said, but remember who said it. Try to recall everything and 
repeat it. You will not be able to. Both Gaydar and Chubays say 
that Zhirinovskiy brought fascism. In reality, Zhirinovskiy is a 
populist, not a fascist. The people who participated in 
elections were mostly pensioners. They could not vote for 
fascists. We do not have any families that have not suffered 
during the war. 
  We are a great nation, and Russia, beginning with Ivan 
Kalita, always developed by expansion. Along the way of 
development, by absorbing peoples, confessions, cultures, it 
became an empire. Communists came and made use of this imperial 
theory. One-sixth of dry land--"the great, powerful Soviet 
Union." We were proud of it. We were all called Russians in the 
West, whether we were Tatars or Jews. And suddenly for the first 
time in its entire 1000-year history Russia has lost part of its 
territory. Russian people who found themselves outside of it 
became "Russian-speaking," a "national minority," or whatever 
else! 
  The nation has experienced a psychological shock. And 
Zhirinovskiy very skillfully used it. 
  [ARGUMENTY I FAKTY] You have spoken actively on the subject 
of a Eurasian Union. Is this a realization of a past mistake? In 
your opinion, is a union possible? 
  [Shumeyko] It is possible, but not today. We began speaking 
of it in order to "test" this idea in the society. Life forces 
us to do it. There are many Russian-speaking people left outside 
of Russia. We propose to CIS countries to introduce dual 
citizenship. But if we can count on it, why do we need to erect 
borders between us and impose customs duties? 
  We need a more rigid organization of what you call the 
Commonwealth. Why not step straight up to world level and create 
out of the CIS a Eurasian Union, a civilized union of countries 
aimed at meeting each others' interests?!

<F P=106> [Meeting of ROSSIYSKIYE VESTI Political Debating Club; date </F>
not given: "Possibility of Accord"] 
  [Text] The latest meeting of the political debating 
club has been held at ROSSIYSKIYE VESTI. Topical problems of 
social development in Russia following the formation of a new 
government and the start of work of the Federal Assembly were 
examined. 
  Yuriy Georgiyevich Aleksandrov, doctor of economic 
sciences, Academician Aleksey Mikhaylovich Yemelyanov, member of 
the State Duma, Aleksey Vasilyevich Kiva, doctor of historical 
sciences and political scientist and current affairs writer, and 
Viktor Leonidovich Sheynis, doctor of economic sciences and 
member of the State Duma, took part in the debate. 
  The meeting of the club was anchored by Leonid 
Petrovich Kravchenko, first deputy chief editor of ROSSIYSKIYE 
VESTI. 
<H5>  Let Us Clarify the Situation </H5>
  L. KRAVCHENKO. Esteemed colleagues! We are today 
holding the latest meeting of our political debating club. On 
the last occasion, as you will recall, we examined the situation 
that had taken shape in Russia following the tragic October 
events, the Federal Assembly elections, and the adoption at the 
referendum of the new Constitution of the Russian Federation. We 
concluded at that time that the polarization of political forces 
in society had intensified. Against the background of the 
intensifying socioeconomic crisis in the country there has been 
a loss of confidence among various strata of society in the 
policy of economic reforms that has been pursued. This was 
reflected also in the election results, when many seats were 
unexpectedly won by representatives of the opposition forces. 
  Unfortunately, the decline in production continues. The rate 
of inflation and the price rises remain high. Threats of mass 
strikes have arisen once more. Certain forces interested in a 
destabilization of the situation are spreading rumors concerning 
a possible coup d'etat and the removal of the president from 
office. What opportunities do there continue to be under these 
conditions for accord and civil peace, for which, incidentally, 
both the president and the State Duma are calling? It is this 
question that I would like to present for discussion. 
  A. KIVA. I will express certain general points, 
which, it seems to me, elucidate more broadly the situation in 
which we find ourselves. 
  First. I believe that the postcommunist 
development of our society is, generally, proceeding in normal 
fashion. The failure of the democrats at the elections was 
entirely logical following two years of difficult reforms. Nor 
does the figure of Zhirinovskiy represent anything out of the 
ordinary, although for Russia extreme nationalism or neofascism 
are unusual, of course. The president has changed in some 
respects. The events of recent months, the October events 
particularly, have made their mark and have turned him in the 
direction of greater consideration and an inclination toward 
compromise and agreements. 
  I would say that the government is different also. It is 
more 
independent, more sure of itself than before. In other words, an 
evolution, an on-going movement, is under way. 
  Second. It seems to me that the democrats already 
have something to lose. For this reason they should be not only 
members of the avant-garde, not only revolutionaries, but also 
custodians. There is a constitution, a democratic constitution. 
A line has been drawn beneath our Soviet past. Forever, I 
believe. And when we hear some facile opinions to the effect 
that we have only chaos, only failures, this is to me simply 
incomprehensible, therefore. 
  Third. I am convinced that the economic reforms 
still require appreciable correction. And if some people have 
yet to recognize that the former system of our financial 
stabilization is not working and that there is a very great 
danger of economic collapse and the disintegration of the social 
sphere, a danger of social explosion, this is distressing. 
  Fourth. I do not doubt that the democrats also are 
at an impasse. Primarily Russia's Choice and its leaders. They 
simply cannot, in my view, recover, simply cannot get their 
bearings in the new situation, cannot understand realities as 
they are. Nor can they accept, in the full meaning of the word, 
the rules of the political game according to the laws of 
democracy. 
  Fifth and finally. An active regrouping of 
political forces is under way in the Duma, in my view. It is 
complete [as published], I believe, but a very strong tilt 
toward the center may be observed. 
  A regrouping of political forces outside of the Duma is 
taking place also, evidently. And the strategic question is 
this: What alternative awaits us in the immediate future--left 
or right? 
  It seems to me that liberalism is departing from the 
political front stage. It will very shortly be departing from 
the economy also. I foresee opening up historically as a 
replacement for liberalism most likely an alternative course to 
that which has been realized in Poland or in Lithuania, that is, 
social democratic. And the state, which in the past took shape 
as a civil society, will be required to endeavor to assume 
social patronage. It should be considered, however, that with us 
people, particularly of the older generation, will accept a 
policy which aims at social protection of the populace. If such 
a policy is implemented, the chances of accord in our society 
will be enhanced. 
<H5>  Between Scylla and Charybdis </H5>
  V. SHEYNIS. The main question concerns the vector 
of Russia's historical development. There is with us a real 
danger of us becoming enmeshed in bloody chaos. I am talking 
about a difficult transitional period, which began several years 
ago and which will hardly end any time soon. And there is no 
more important task currently than averting this bloody chaos, 
lawlessness, and disintegration of the state. It is essential 
for this, of course, to undertake a whole number of positive 
actions. 
  Aleksey Vasilyevich Kiva said that Russia is completing the 
transition to postcommunism. I believe that this is correct, but 
I would posit an even broader historical framework. We are 
completing the transition from historical underdevelopment, 
which is typical decidedly of all countries, other than the 
pioneers--the West European countries--to a developed modern 
society. For some time now I have, what is more, been 
deliberately avoiding such concepts as socialism and capitalism, 
which, in my opinion, are capable more of blurring the heart of 
the matter than elucidating it. And so in attempting to reveal 
the distinctive aspects of Russia's transition I would highlight 
four essential points. 
  First, as distinct from China and as distinct from 
the countries of Latin America and Southeast Asia, we are 
switching not from an undeveloped market to a market economy but 
from an entirely antimarket system, a virtually ideal model of 
the distributive-state economy. 
  Second, as distinct from, say, the East European 
countries, we are having to create from scratch institutions of 
the civil society. It was sufficient to pull down the Berlin 
Wall, it was sufficient to remove the threat of Soviet troops' 
invasion of the East European countries, for all the 
institutions of the civil society, which they had had formerly, 
to grow there instantly. 
  Third, the superpower complex. This is a 
distinction from many other countries. And this complex had 
entirely material outlines also, what is more, namely: a warped 
economy, an economy with a tremendous preponderance of military 
production, an economy with plant-cities, which it is very 
difficult to escape and which we cannot simply up and reform in 
a comparatively short space of time. 
  Fourth. Transition requires political stability. 
This we do not have, unfortunately. There are, generally 
speaking, two basic ways to achieve stability: either the 
decisive victory of one side or the achievement of accord among 
the main antagonistic forces. That is, a social compact--formal 
or informal--but observed by the opposite sides. 
  In the last parliament I took part in the formation of a 
faction which called itself Accord for Progress. And although we 
cannot boast of any appreciable political achievements, I 
believe that the faction and its program, expressed in its name, 
had nothing to be ashamed of. It pursued a policy which, 
perhaps, could not have been realized in that specific situation 
but which sowed good seeds. 
  A particular feature of the situation today is that both 
sides into which society is divided are oriented toward victory. 
But this orientation is increasingly assuming the cover of 
accord. That is, the idea of compromise, the idea of the 
achievement of some degree of accord, is present and is being 
proclaimed. The only trouble is that we write one thing and hold 
on in our minds to something else. Everyone is preparing for the 
main political event in Russia of the latter half of the 1990's, 
namely, the presidential elections. 
  In this connection, one further essential point. In the new 
constitution the role of parliament has, unfortunately, been 
reduced. Structures of the executive headed by the president are 
coming to the fore. What kind of Russia will enter the 21st 
century and whether it can successfully overcome all the dangers 
of the transitional period will depend, therefore, on who is 
elected president at the next elections. 
  Passing between Scylla and Charybdis is a well-known popular 
expression. But the vast majority of those who employ this image 
misinterpret it. They proceed from the fact that the hero of the 
ancient Greek epic poem had an opportunity to somehow slip 
through, avoiding both Scylla and Charybdis. But Odysseus did 
not have this opportunity, and he had to choose the less 
fearsome of the two monsters. And this, truly, is our situation 
today. We are choosing not between good and bad but between bad 
and very bad. 
  YU. ALEKSANDROV. Viktor Leonidovich, I have the 
impression that the preparation of different political forces 
for the struggle for the presidency is under way, as it were, in 
the Duma and that the powerful bloc-forming of the opposition 
forces in order to begin the antipresidential campaign even now 
is taking place simultaneously. Isakov, in particular, has 
declared that the president is the main destabilizing factor at 
the present time. What do you think? 
  V. SHEYNIS. Isakov's speech attracted attention, 
of course. As distinct from many other representatives of the 
implacable opposition, Isakov, who possesses many of the 
"virtues" of this political current, is an educated individual. 
He is not Anpilov. He is a professional. And when he said that 
the constitution affords an opportunity for presidential 
elections via parliament, he understood full well that he was 
telling an untruth. And do you know why? This was simply a trial 
balloon. For the opposition in parliament does not have the 
requisite majority even for raising this matter. The approximate 
correlation of votes is at the most 200 on one side and around 
170 on the other. 
  A. YEMELYANOV. A few words to add to what Viktor 
Leonidovich said. Remember how the speaker of the house was 
elected in the State Duma. The opposition rejoiced when Ivan 
Petrovich Rybkin's candidacy was successful. Now, it seemed, 
they could bar admission to power of anyone from blocs of a 
democratic persuasion: both committee chairmen and their 
deputies. But look what has happened. The leaders of the blocs 
have agreed not to "devour" one another but to share these 
committee chairman and deputy positions proportionally. They 
proposed Mikhail Mityukov as first deputy speaker, yet they 
could have barred him altogether. And, what is most important, 
they agreed to a block vote. This means that they proceeded from 
common sense, from an understanding that a new alignment of 
forces has emerged in parliament. 
<H5>  The Barometer Is Common Sense </H5>
  A. YEMELYANOV. I would like to distinguish several 
aspects of the following nature. See how the recent turnabouts 
in economic policy and the personnel shuffles in the government 
were interpreted, particularly in the news media. They made a 
fuss about the fact that this was essentially a recoil, a return 
to the old ways. It is our former delusions that were, I 
believe, the basis of such opinions. In this case, monopolism of 
the truth. 
  And although we are fighting this and have condemned it in 
theory, it is this that we are encountering even now in the 
interpretation of the reforms. We want in practice to reduce an 
understanding of the essence of the reforms to the way in which 
they were presented and implemented since the start of 1992 by 
Yegor Timurovich Gaydar and his team. But you cannot make 
provision for everything with such profound reformations. 
Mistakes are inevitable, corrections are inevitable, and there 
is nothing to be ashamed of if the reformer himself sees this 
and changes and improves and does not present matters as a 
renunciation of the reforms. 
  And, then, what have we to be ashamed of? We have, after 
all, 
achieved a great deal. Let us recall. Two and a half years ago 
the very words "enterprise" and "private property" were rejected 
in what was then the Union Supreme Soviet by the majority, 
Gorbachev included. And even Sobchak, this is a historical 
paradox, was the first to protest and "ax" the concept of 
ownership of the land. When we deputies proposed this, he said 
that both the Black Sea coast and everything else would then be 
bought up. This is how ideology prevailed over common sense. 
These were the nineties. But now no one any longer disputes, not 
even the most conservative figures protest, private ownership or 
enterprise. This is a breakthrough in ideology, a breakthrough 
in management philosophy. 
  But the problem lies elsewhere. The reforms should not have 
been "spurred." The transition from one society to another, from 
one economic and social system to another, is a process of 
decades. And what did we do? I will give you just one 
characteristic with reference to agriculture. Remember how the 
task that was set was reorganization and the liquidation of all 
unprofitable kolkhozes and sovkhozes by 1 April 1992. In just 
three months. Stalin carried out collectivization this way, but 
the timeframe was somewhat longer even then. 
  It is also bad that the reforms have been implemented 
exclusively in accordance with the from-the-top-down principle. 
Although it is now generally recognized that the interests of 
the individual cannot be disregarded. 
  YU. ALEKSANDROV. Just one comment concerning 
economic policy. There are two extremes here. It seems to me 
that if Gaydar's policy is evaluated in the context of the 
political conditions of that time, these unpopular measures that 
were pursued by Gaydar's team are explained to a large extent 
not so much by theoretical views as by the need to give a boost 
to the reforms, overcoming the very strong political resistance. 
Although, I agree, there were, of course, extremes. But we 
should beware that in the process of present-day corrections we 
not cross over into another system. We know that it is possible 
to build a market economy which proves to be confined, as it 
were, to the sector of inefficient works. How, after all, are 
they supported currently? Only by the redistribution of some 
limited economic resources of society. And we can build an 
economic system that has a sector of inefficient works protected 
against outside competition that supports the sufficiently high 
living standard of those who are associated with it. But we 
would be leaving the bulk of society overboard in these sumps of 
unproductive occupations. 
  A. YEMELYANOV. I know all the reformers, they are 
almost all graduates of our Moscow State University Economics 
Faculty. I admire the talent of Yegor Timurovich and his 
colleagues. But on the practical level they did some foolish 
things. The general scourge of our economy, for example--the 
nonpayments. Tens, hundreds of enterprises are coming to a halt. 
This is a multi-aspectual issue. But I believe that the main 
obstructions concerning these payments are being created at the 
top. The nonpayments are like a clot in a blood vessel. They 
have arisen in one or two places, and the entire organism will 
be paralyzed. 
  I shall explain this by the example of the peasants. They 
collected the grain, gathered in the harvest, but money has not 
been paid the peasants. And this has gone on down the line. 
There is no money, they can no longer purchase trucks and 
combines. The machinery for the manufacture of trucks and 
combines has been halted. All of agricultural machine building 
has been paralyzed. Not to mention fertilizer, we are working 
the land to exhaustion. And Minister Fedorov was adamant: No, we 
will not provide any money. This is a simply a violation of the 
elementary requirements of common sense. 
  YU. ALEKSANDROV. I would like in literally two 
words to dwell on the nonpayments problem. This is an 
extraordinarily complex problem, all the same. Chernomyrdin is 
still holding back money even now. Because there is none. After 
all, the nonpayments problem was born in various ways. Take 
agriculture, say. Yes, of course the harvest needs to be paid 
for. But, Aleksey Mikhaylovich, you will surely recall how the 
idea of the government contract arose, when essentially very 
high prices for grain were promised. I do not know how this 
decision was born politically. But there are, in any case, two 
points here. The first is that the state tied itself by its 
undertaking to pay unduly high prices. And that the agrarians, 
for their part, failed to offer a clear program of the 
reorganization of inefficient farms. 
  A. YEMELYANOV. You are wrong as regards the very 
high prices. They are still artificially low even now. But even 
this is not the point. It is something else that is of 
fundamental importance: If you purchase grain, please be so kind 
as to pay, not drag out the payment for many months, when the 
money "dries up" before one's eyes. And, in addition, the 
present leadership has as a result found itself in a very 
difficult situation. After all, it has to pay off the debt to 
the peasants and, in addition, allocate credit for the spring 
sowing, for the new harvest, which, incidentally, is being done. 
And here we have a surge of inflation. Sins that go back to last 
year are having to be paid for. This is why the need for 
personnel shuffles arose. This is the correct position of both 
the prime minister and the president. 
<H5>  Struggle for Power as an End in Itself </H5>
  L. KRAVCHENKO. Aleksey Mikhaylovich, listening to 
you, I came to think that there was something symbolic in these 
personnel shuffles. Perhaps we are finally coming to the 
conclusion that we can no longer put fate to the test, allowing 
politics undivided sway, allowing politics to rape, if you will 
excuse the expression, economics. It has long been clear that 
priority should be given economics, where everything is dictated 
by common sense and precise business calculation--economics free 
of political predilections. The more the politicians understand 
this truth, there more chances there are that economics will be 
given priority, not the struggle for power. 
  For the sake of salvation of the economy, salvation of the 
country, it is, perhaps, time for all political forces to seek 
accord and to unite their efforts. 
  A. YEMELYANOV. I agree. Continuation of the 
struggle will bring about self-destruction. I would draw, 
conditionally, an analogy with the former Union republics. After 
the 1991 putsch they all wanted full sovereignty. But time has 
elapsed, and many of them have recognized that you cannot 
survive alone. I am afraid to oversimplify this question, but 
there are things in common. There is not one political force 
that is currently capable of getting the better of the others 
independently. A trend toward a certain convergence is probably 
inevitable, therefore. These processes, despite all the 
difficulties, are occurring here in the Duma also. 
  V. SHEYNIS. It would be correct to conclude that 
the struggle for a new course of the reforms has become 
interwoven here with the struggle for power. Struggle for power 
as an end in itself. Particular clans, some of which identify 
with the democrats, others, with their opponents, have taken 
shape, since 1989, at least. And in each case it is not simply 
for one clan but for several that power is a value in itself, 
and which are struggling to establish their control of power and 
property. 
  YU. ALEKSANDROV. I now have the impression that 
the conditions for the achievement of social accord are better. 
At the same time, on the other hand, political forces are, 
truly, grouping in the struggle for peace, primarily for the 
presidency. And quite a wide-ranging bloc of forces opposed to 
Russia's Choice in the struggle against the current president 
and for early elections is possible here, what is more. This 
could inflame the situation. 
  I see a further danger in the fact that the state is 
becoming 
bureaucratized very quickly and that its machinery is growing 
unchecked. And the state is in this sense once again becoming 
divorced from the people and is perched, so to speak, on its own 
machinery, on a bureaucratic foundation. This is perceived very 
strongly in society and is being reflected onto the democrats, 
who are being identified with the state. 
  The growth of nationalism, which is preventing a 
strengthening of accord in society, is very troubling. It is 
encouraging, it is true, that there have already been examples 
of the successful resolution of most complex contradictions, as 
was the case in the elaboration of the treaty with Tatarstan, 
and there is now hope of a start on an improvement of relations 
with Chechnya. 
  A. KIVA. I also share the belief that the efforts 
to achieve civil peace today are far more auspicious than was 
the case earlier. If we recall last year, particularly the 
unyielding antagonism that developed into diarchy, the 
opposition had at that time a hope of revanche. They only needed 
to overthrow President Yeltsin, and they could have expected to 
have turned the ship of state in another direction. This is no 
longer the case. De jure we are living in accordance with a new 
constitution, de facto also, to some extent. The soviets are no 
more, and it came as a surprise to us to find that these soviets 
were not that deeply rooted. And, besides, a certain balance of 
political forces has taken shape. No one has the clear 
advantage. There is no temptation to resort to manifestly power 
solutions. 
<H5>  Evil Disappears With Satiety </H5>
  L. KRAVCHENKO. Do you not think that one of the 
main prerequisites for the achievement of accord and civil peace 
would be the imparting of a socially attractive character to the 
economic reforms. It is said that evil disappears with satiety. 
I do not wish to oversimplify the problem. No one either in the 
present or the past government would have refused to have 
channeled more resources into social programs. But there were no 
reserves. Nonetheless, monetarist projects are inadequately 
oriented toward man and his concerns and needs. After all, the 
more poor and destitute people there are, the broader the social 
base for the opposition and the greater its chances of election 
success. This was clearly understood by the president, I 
believe, when, in his report to parliament, he put more emphasis 
on social policy and subsequently issued an edict geared to 
combating the delays in the payments of wages and pensions. 
Instances of enterprises deliberately having kept money in 
accounts in order to "rotate" it via the banks have already 
become known. The directors are at every step establishing for 
themselves wages of several millions, while the workers get 
50,000-70,000. This multiple discrepancy in pay is sending 
people into a rage. 
  I would like to emphasize, that is, that despite all the 
difficulties there are real opportunities for strengthening the 
social content of the economic reforms. Do you agree with this 
formulation of the issue? 
  A. YEMELYANOV. There is no doubt that any reform 
should one way or another be passed through the prism of man. 
What happened was that we cast aside social regulation, rushed 
recklessly into the market, and began to transfer everything 
absolutely to a commercial basis. Health care and education and 
science and culture.... It is here primarily that an adjustment 
is needed lest we conclusively kill off that which is healthy 
that has developed and in order that we rectify all this 
distortion. Otherwise we democrats will simply lose in the 
future: at both the presidential and parliamentary elections. 
  A. KIVA. I once published an article entitled 
"Postcommunist Syndrome." It said, inter alia, that we have a 
passion for doing everything other than the way it was done 
under the socialist system. Even that which is good that should 
have been preserved--the social sphere, medicine, the health and 
fitness centers, the recreation centers, children's 
establishments--everything has been uprooted. This, 
unfortunately, is a trait of our national character, it is 
Bolshevism of the first water. We rushed over to one side, and 
the pendulum swung to the other. 
  YU. ALEKSANDROV. There are contentious aspects 
here also. What is meant by socially oriented reforms under our 
conditions? Production is declining. Everyone is short of money. 
There is not one sector that is not in need of credit. If we 
halt the landslide in production and if we all start to work 
better--everyone without exception--general prosperity will 
begin to grow also. Meanwhile, I believe that it may rather be a 
question of smoothing over as much as possible the negative 
social consequences of all the structural and other 
reorganizations. 
  L. KRAVCHENKO. I would like to touch on one 
further topic. Society was recently agitated by the amnesty that 
was announced. Many fears have arisen: Khasbulatov, Rutskoy, 
Anpilov, Konstantinov, and Makashov have been set free and they 
will rush into the fray and will want revanche. All kinds of 
inventions have arisen also. The amnesty plays, allegedly, into 
the hands of the president, who does not want any investigation 
of the tragic White House events. And the amnesty was all but a 
result of a compact between the president and the leaders of the 
Duma. This, in any event, is what Gavriil Popov has openly 
hinted at in his speeches. 
  A. KIVA. I have not shared the panic fear that has 
arisen in the democratic community in connection with the 
amnesty. This is an ambiguous event, of course. There are big 
minuses here, but there are pluses also. When the smoke had 
cleared, for example, it was ascertained via opinion polls that 
many of Zhirinovskiy's supporters had gone over to Rutskoy. 
Zhirinovskiy had a 6 percent rating, Rutskoy, 5 percent, 
apparently. There is much that could still change. This does not 
mean that Rutskoy is for the country an acceptable figure as 
president, but every cloud has a silver lining, as they say. 
  And a second point. However paradoxical, this amnesty has, 
perhaps, boosted the aspiration to accord and revealed that not 
all questions were solved in essence on 3-4 October. We need, 
therefore, to be viewing matters in a broader perspective more 
than simply thinking about the losses the amnesty caused. 
  A. YEMELYANOV. If the upsurge of social protest in 
society grows, the amnesty could prove to be to the benefit of 
the united opposition. The leaders of the radicals were 
released, but the question of an assessment of what they did has 
remained unexplained. There have on their part been no words of 
repentance or, at least, regret. True, the State Duma is as yet 
examining certain documents supplementary to the amnesty decree, 
intending smoothing over some of its negative consequences. 
<H5>  Heed the Advice, Democrats! </H5>
  L. KRAVCHENKO. It is evidently time to "round out" 
our discussion. I would like in conclusion to ask whether you 
have suggestions concerning an increase in the chances for a 
strengthening of civil peace and accord. Your personal 
suggestions.... 
  V. SHEYNIS. I have specific advice addressed to 
the democrats: what they should do first and foremost. 
  First. Clearly understand the actual 
possibilities, content, and limits of so-called accord. Do not 
allow yourselves to be carried away by rhetoric. Accord under 
the specific conditions means three things, in my view. First, 
the renunciation of forcible action and unconstitutional 
solutions, whatever the constitution and whatever the attitude 
toward it. 
  Second. Undertake corrections of the economic 
course. 
  Third. Uphold your positions on the criminal and 
civil codes, the election system, the Referendum Act, and so 
forth. 
  Fourth. Firmly defend the foundation of the reform 
course. Corrections are essential, but let us pay tribute to the 
courage of Gaydar and his team, who pushed the ship away from 
the shallows. Got it moving and created a new economic 
situation. We need to understand here the difference between our 
interests, the interests of the people and society, and the 
interests of the new nomenklatura, which today calls itself 
democratic, but which is deciding its own power and property 
interests. It is essential to clearly understand this. 
  And fifth and finally--patiently build up an 
election organization. For parliamentary elections are impending 
at the end of 1995 even, then come presidential elections in 
1996. It will be necessary to prepare a leader and prepare 
organizations. This, in my opinion, is today a most important 
task because the two years will fly by extraordinarily quickly. 
  A. KIVA. I largely agree with Viktor Leonidovich. 
The question of the team of reformers and of ways of continuing 
the reforms is urgent today. The opposition is demanding the 
creation of a coalition government. This is a difficult 
question, but we have a coalition government even now. On the 
other hand, we cannot oversimplify matters to such an extent as 
to conceive of a government with the participation of, say, 
Gennadiy Zyuganov, Vladimir Zhirinovskiy, Gleb Yakunin, and 
Yegor Gaydar. 
  To a considerable extent civil peace and accord are 
guaranteed by the president personally. He is required to do so 
by the constitution. But I would like to hope that both he and 
the government would regularly confer with the people. Seek, if 
you wish, their consent to this step or the other that affects 
society's living standards. Do not disregard public opinion and 
consult with people more often, speaking on television and radio 
and in the press. Explain to them your policy, do not conceal 
difficulties. Lift this depression and lack of confidence in the 
future, when it seems that no light can be seen at the end of 
the tunnel. This might then be repaid a hundredfold.

<F P=106> [Interview with Ioann, metropolitan of St. Petersburg and </F>
Ladoga, by Valentin Chikin, chief editor of SOVETSKAYA ROSSIYA; 
place and date not given: "Let Us Put a Stop to the Discord"] 
  [Text] V. Chikin: Your Grace, I often have to 
address the most diverse audiences--in terms of age, in terms of 
social composition, in terms of political views. In addition, I 
regularly familiarize myself with the extensive readers' 
mailbag. All this enables me to conclude that the role of the 
Russian Orthodox Church in our life is becoming increasingly 
material. This is connected to a large extent, I believe, with 
your efforts for the spiritual, Orthodox-patriotic enlightenment 
of society, the revival of Russian national self-awareness, and 
the preaching of mercy and love, righteousness and piety. 
  In our society today, which is rent by discord, there are 
many forces that would not be averse to portraying the church as 
their political ally. It is sufficient to point to the efforts 
being exerted for this by the present ruling regime. You, Your 
Eminence, despite your clear civic, patriotic position, have 
until recently rejected all suggestions that you link your name 
with any political force whatever. You were always above this. 
But quite recently you responded to our request and blessed the 
initiative of certain politicians, journalists, and cultural 
figures who announced the creation of the broad public movement 
Accord in the Name of Russia. It is the first time that a man of 
the church of so high a rank has "intervened in politics," on 
the side of the "center-left opposition," what is more. What 
prompted you to make this decision? Are you not afraid of 
charges of political intriguing? 
  Metropolitan IOANN: I fear no charges. It is 
important that I keep my conscience clear before the impartial 
Day of Judgment, but the common talk of man does not frighten 
me--it is transient, frivolous, and rash. As far, however, as my 
"intervention in politics" is concerned, things need to be made 
clear here in order to avoid possible misunderstandings. I am, 
as before, free of any party predilections whatever. This goes 
against the grain for many people. The news media have 
repeatedly pronounced me at times a communist, at times a 
nationalist, at times (as soon as they could bring themselves to 
say it!) a fascist even and pogrom instigator, virtually. There 
is nothing surprising in this for the stern words of 
ecclesiastical understanding and paternal arch-pastoral 
denunciation are pleasing to far from everyone in the present 
lacerated Russia. Black-hearted people are endeavoring to evade 
the expository light of Christ's truth and ecclesiastical grace. 
Evil, generally, cannot stand the truth and always attempts to 
debase and calumniate it. But we must not give way to despair. 
The Lord said in Holy Scripture: "Blessed are ye when men shall 
revile you and persecute you and say all manner of evil against 
you falsely, for my sake. Rejoice and be exceeding glad for 
great is your reward in heaven..." (Matthew, 5, 11) 
  I consider it essential to emphasize that I do not 
distinguish between "right" and "left," "liberals" and the 
"supporters of strict authority." I endeavor merely, to the best 
of my abilities, to distinguish well-intentioned people sick at 
heart for the profaned motherland from the ill-intentioned 
destroyers who have reduced my unhappy country and my 
kind-hearted, trustful people to the shame in which they now 
find themselves. While being outside of politics, the church 
cannot, for all that, be outside of society, outside of life, 
pretending not to notice the orgy that has been put on in Rus by 
Christ-haters, corrupters, and Satanists of various stripes. So 
I did not bless the "opposition" as such for I am not a 
politician. But, on the other hand, I joyfully blessed the pious 
intentions of people who appealed to me for support and 
assistance. After they had said to me: "Your Eminence, Russia is 
dying. Bless us, we wish to make every possible effort to halt 
this monstrous process and revive our common fatherland in the 
strength and glory of its past grandeur"--some kind of Russian 
Orthodox archbishop I would have been had I refused this 
blessing. 
  For the first time leaders of an influential political 
grouping appealed directly for benediction and spiritual support 
to the church hierarchy. And this invests all of us with a great 
deal of responsibility. Although I am not so naive as not to 
understand the entire complexity of the current apportionment of 
forces, ascribing to myself some special role. In addition, the 
events of "Black October," when the church was cynically used as 
a screen by political intriguers conducting under the cover of 
the negotiations at the Danilov Monastery preparations for a 
large-scale provocation, taught all of us a thing or two. So it 
needs to be said clearly that the archbishop's blessing is given 
for selfless, sacrificial labor in the name of salvation of the 
dying fatherland, the unification of all healthy forces of 
society, an end to the discord, and for spiritual devotion, not 
political games, backstage machinations, and the struggle for 
office. 
  The main thing today is to find the ground for unification, 
not allow oneself to be pulled into another bloody "showdown," 
and to ensure the evolutionary, predictable development of 
events in the country. I believe this to be the sole possible 
path, which should be taken jointly by everyone: the government 
and parliament and the opposition and the "power party." No one 
should ever be accused indiscriminately, en masse. I am 
convinced that the vast majority of politicians, wherever they 
are--in the structures of the executive, legislature, or 
judiciary--could reach agreement if they could isolate 
themselves from the baneful influence of extremism. 
  V. CHIKIN: This is true, nonetheless, we cannot 
close our eyes to the fact that the politicians, like society as 
a whole, are today considerably disunited. Each has his own view 
of the causes of the present drama, his own prescription of a 
way out of the crisis, his own circle of followers. On the one 
hand this creates favorable soil for compromise for the most 
sober-minded and farsighted are beginning to understand that 
under the current conditions no one can cope with the general 
problem alone and that the alternative to broad patriotic 
unification can only be chaos, an intensification of the 
discord, and an endless succession of "Praetorian" palace coups. 
But, on the other, there is always the temptation to emphasize 
one's own exclusiveness and significance. What, in your view, 
should the unificatory platform be? 
  Metropolitan IOANN: We should be united first and 
foremost by the danger of general perdition, seeing the growth 
of the trends of disintegration of Russia's millennial sovereign 
statehood. We should unite on the basis of our centuries-old 
holy places, moral and civic values, and fidelity to the best 
traditions of Russian history and culture. 
  Unfortunately, certain present extremist reformers, who have 
inherited the worst traits of the terrorist--"Bolshevik"--self- 
awareness, have already cost Russia incredible sacrifices and 
are moving in the direction of the creation in our country, 
which is rapidly becoming destitute, of a power monstrous in its 
cynicism-- corrupt and uncontrolled and concealing behind 
pseudo-democratic rhetoric utter scorn for the laws and a 
single-minded aspiration to dictatorship. Their unchecked, 
heedless, and irresponsible experimenting has brought our 
motherland to the brink of state, economic, political, and 
spiritual catastrophe. 
  But an end must be put to the omnipotence of the petty 
politicians who have ruthlessly crippled Russia beneath the 
demagogic "Reforms at any price" slogan. The death of the 
country must not be the appalling price of the arrogant 
aspirations of a handful of power- lovers. It can be averted 
solely, however, on the path of a responsible and thorough 
search for ways of national reconciliation and the mobilization 
of all healthy social forces prepared in the name of the 
fatherland to rise above their opportunist mercenary interests. 
  The basis of this unification should be a comprehensive and 
integral patriotic ideology designed to revive in society the 
flouted sense of national dignity and cleanse the mass 
consciousness of the legacy of group and class enmity, state and 
religious nihilism, and aspirituality and amorality. The 
undoubted priorities in this sacred cause of the reconstitution 
of Greater Russia as a healthy, conciliary organism, responsible 
component of the international community, and most important 
guarantor of geopolitical balance in the world are the 
restoration of the historical continuity of its development; 
reunification of the artificially disarticulated Russian people 
and the reconstitution of the conciliary trinity of Great 
Russians, White Russians, and Little Russians; and the 
strengthening of all moral-religious foundations, which from age 
to age inspired our valorous forefathers to endeavors for the 
good of the beloved fatherland. 
  In addition, it is vitally necessary today to ascertain and 
support a responsible and authoritative political leader who can 
rally the nation, having harmoniously and constructively united 
the efforts of all who sincerely take to heart the country's 
fate. Only such a leader may be a real guarantor of national 
accord, rein in the growing chaos in the economy and the turmoil 
in politics, emphatically and commandingly introducing to the 
life of society a strict legal framework and having excluded 
violence from the arsenal of political struggle, standing "above 
the fray" in the role of peacemaker and impartial judge, not 
provocateur and instigator. 
  It should be understood, of course, that we are all faced 
with an unprecedented historical choice threatening Russia with 
the chaos of collapse and a slide into the abyss of historical 
nonexistence. We need to recognize the far-reaching complexity 
of the tasks of revival confronting a society rent by discord. 
Grant us, Lord, the patience, courage, and faith necessary on 
this onerous path.... 
  V. CHIKIN: The opposition has been attempting for 
several years now to formulate a patriotic ideological platform 
which would be a foundation for the joint actions of all healthy 
forces and has invariably failed. All this ends in its basic 
ideas ultimately being intercepted and used with ill intent by 
our political opponents. Could you, Your Eminence, indicate if 
only the general features of the ideology of a Russian revival 
capable, in your view, of imparting to all of us the necessary 
creative, unifying impetus which Russia is lacking today? 
  Metropolitan IOANN: Politics is today, 
unfortunately, chiefly a sphere of the operation of human 
passions, a sphere of the clash of ambitions and desires, a 
field of the domination of the love of power, vanity, and pride. 
Politicians are failing to formulate a common "ideology of 
revival" because they approach this matter in exclusively 
opportunist fashion, regarding such ideology as a mechanism of 
the control of society, not as the result of profound, 
conceptualized, and substantiated convictions arrived at through 
much suffering. Everyone wants to have an ideology "for himself" 
and is prepared for any artificial manipulations, provided that 
he stand out from the common herd. I speak of this not in 
condemnation but in sorrow for it is the present discord which 
is the result of this approach. It remains only to wait and hope 
that with God's help common sense ultimately prevails, for all 
that, over personal ambitions. The Accord in the Name of Russia 
affords such a hope. 
  As far, however, as the availability of an ideological 
platform suitable for Russia's revival is concerned, it does, of 
course, exist. And, what is particularly important, there is no 
need for it to be specially devised or artificially designed. It 
is necessary only to avail ourselves of the giant spiritual 
experience which the Russian people have accumulated in the time 
of their sovereign existence. After all, it is perfectly obvious 
today even that the reviving Russian national self-awareness is 
gravitating in all parameters toward the fullest possible 
restoration of the historical continuity interrupted in the 20th 
century by a whole series of devastating military clashes and 
powerful social cataclysms. 
  Despite, however, the catastrophic nature of Russian 
history, 
Russia has thus far ultimately emerged from all upheavals and 
discord even stronger than it was before they started. The 
unique spiritual qualities of the Russian national-religious 
self-awareness has contributed primarily to this course of 
events. 
  For many centuries it has been based on three fundamental 
philosophical archetypes. The first--the archetype of 
sovereignty-- has traditionally appeared in the mass 
consciousness as the ideology of Russian imperialism 
presupposing conviction as to the universal peacemaking role of 
Russian statehood. As distinct from its West European brethren, 
Russian imperialism was never of an aggressive nature, 
militarist even less. Its underlying slogan: "Moscow is the 
third Rome," postulated an understanding of the empire, the 
state, as the optimum state form for the spiritual-- religious 
and cultural--development of society in accordance with the 
moral imperatives of the Christian religion. 
  The sovereign might of the state was not regarded as an end 
in itself here but merely as the means of the protection and 
defense of the traditional values and objects of worship of 
national life. 
  The second archetype of Russian self-awareness--the 
archetype 
of conciliarism--takes the form of an ideology of Russian 
nationalism. And once again, in contrast to aggressive 
European nationalism, this ideology was in Rus always of a 
conservative- protective, peacemaking nature and paternally 
protective in relation to the small peoples living in Russia. 
Its foundation was the unreservedly just assertion that it is 
the Russian people (taken in their triune conciliary fullness 
together with Little Russians and White Russians as a spiritual, 
not only ethnic, community) who are the most important custodian 
of the sovereign consciousness, pillar of Russian statehood, and 
its dependable guard. 
  The third, most important, profound, and ancient, archetype 
of Russian self-awareness is firmly connected with Orthodox 
ecclesiasticism and is formalized philosophically in the 
ideology of Russian religious messianism. Its 
development was the natural result of the ineradicable impact 
made by the Orthodox Church on the entire system of Russian 
being--eternal, family, social, and state. The basis of this 
philosophy is the belief that the highest, providential duty of 
the Russian people-- the "Chosen People"--is the obligation to 
preserve the dogmatic and moral ideals of Christianity and to 
carry them undefiled through all obstacles, misfortunes, and 
disasters. This ideology, just like the first two, is of a 
clearly expressed introverted, that is, nonaggressive, peaceful 
nature. 
  It was these three philosophical archetypes that were 
reduced 
to one in the Russian slogan "Orthodoxy, Autocracy, People," 
which remained the social slogan of Russia right up to the 1917 
revolution. It is they--in updated, modern form--that should be 
made the basis of the new, reviving Russia, which will combine 
within it all that is best that was cultivated by Russian life 
both in ancient times and in the recent past.... 
  V. CHIKIN: But today many of the concepts among 
those about which you have been speaking are being earnestly 
discredited by the news media. Could they consolidate a mass 
consciousness still subject to the powerful influence of 
television rot?! 
  Metropolitan IOANN: First, I do not insist on some 
definite terms: What is important is the essence, not the name. 
Second, a real ideology of Russian revival should be geared to 
the long term. We need to know how to wait because, after all, 
it will take time for our national self-awareness to return to 
its natural forms. Even the branch of a tree weighed down by a 
heavy load does not straighten immediately. One thing can be 
said for sure: The process of Russian revival is today under way 
tumultuously, its direction has been determined, and any 
political force that dares to ignore this is doomed to vanish 
from the Russian front stage in the coming years even. 
  V. CHIKIN: But such a natural process could be 
interrupted at any moment. Does not the dreadful example of the 
October carnage in Moscow confirm this? 
  Metropolitan IOANN: It confirms precisely the 
opposite for, despite the Black October and the forced 
brain-washing before the December elections, their results 
confirmed the powerful national-patriotic shift that has 
occurred in public opinion as of late. I believe, incidentally, 
that the Accord in the Name of Russia initiative is to a 
considerable extent the result of a general burning need for a 
unification of efforts in order to prevent extremists and 
provocateurs availing themselves of the fruit of these 
processes. It is not, after all, a question of which office one 
occupies but of the first outlines of the truly constructive 
interaction of very dissimilar people beginning to emerge. I, in 
any event, will make every effort to ensure that this be the 
case for I see this as an opportunity to contribute the best I 
can to the conciliation of suffering Russia and the achievement 
of the national accord and civil peace so desired by us all.

<F P=106> [Article by V.L.: "Friends in Abuse of the Regime: This Is </F>
How the Communists Themselves Have Defined the Most Important of 
Their Party's Occupations"] 
  [Text] The very phrase "material of a Central Committee 
plenum" evokes bad memories in journalists with pre-perestroyka 
experience. But the 45 seats of the communist faction in the 
Duma and the 400,000 circulation of SOVETSKAYA ROSSIYA compel, 
whether we like it or not, an entirely serious attitude toward 
plenums of the communists. In addition, when the red 
chiefs--Chikin, Zyuganov, and Tuleyev--consolidate, creating a 
new movement with the participation of Govorukhin and Glazyev, 
this also is reason to once again ask: Who are the communists 
today, what are they doing, how does their internal program 
differ from the street slogans? 
  Those who have not forgotten the red banners at the White 
House and Ostankino in October would be pleasantly surprised 
upon reading the material of the recent plenum of the Communist 
Party of the Russian Federation Central Executive Committee. The 
communists advocate conversion, a fight against crime, and a 
national information space. No one is summoning anyone to the 
barricades, on the contrary, the current contradictions may be 
resolved only by the nonviolent path under conditions of civic 
peace. In addition, party leader Gennadiy Zyuganov is calling 
for the "open and honest adoption of the so-called `local 
concerns theory.'" 
  Painting the portrait of his organization, Zyuganov is 
altogether critical in a manner that is not communist. Even 
earlier it might have been suspected that the Communist Party of 
the Russian Federation was mainly a party of retirees, whose 
primary cells it was easiest to create under the auspices of 
district social security departments. The report confirmed this 
impression. "The age and social composition of our primaries do 
not yet correspond to the requirements of the times.... 
Exclusive party groups and restrictive party activities 
frequently become a venue for the like-minded in their narrow 
circle to unburden themselves, abusing the current regime, and 
are essentially a means of psychological release, not 
psychological mobilization. And several levels higher--street 
demonstrations which are also of practically invariable 
composition and are increasingly amounting to the role of 
psychological safety valve as well." 
  Do not be deluded by the "local concerns theory" and the 
"age 
composition of the primaries": Even at the present time the 
Communist Party is preparing--in a coalition, it is true--to 
enter into control of the state. It is obvious that the 
Communist Party of the Russian Federation will, for all that, be 
seeking support not in the district social security departments 
but among the agrarians and miners, having caught very precisely 
the demands of certain strikers for early presidential elections. 
  Mention has been made repeatedly of the political plasticity 
of Gennadiy Zyuganov. In the eyes of some he is a socialist, for 
others, a hard-line Leninist communist. The present report 
identifies Zyuganov's approach to the future presidential 
elections. It is clear to the communists that the present 
president should not take part in them. But it is important and 
not, I believe, out of the question for those who voted for the 
Communist Party of the Russian Federation that Zyuganov would 
not like to see Rutskoy among the candidates either. "After all, 
the amnesty was adopted," Zyuganov argues, "to ensure the most 
painless possibility of the departure of all politicians who 
wittingly or unwittingly dragged the country into chaos and 
fratricide." 
  Nor would the leader of the communists care to have 
Zhirinovskiy as a competitor either. Without naming Vladimir 
Volfovich directly, Zyuganov warned the communists against some 
"social messiah" capable of creating in society "a belief in 
simple and most rapid solutions for all problems." 
  As ensues from the plenum material, the leaders of the 
communists feel more lively and confident in the Duma than in a 
dialogue with their own party. By all accounts, the sole 
solution for political survival is an attempt to create some 
mass movement of the left. It cannot be ruled out that the name 
"communist party" will be buried en route. Otherwise with the 
inevitability of the change of seasons the present communists 
will be quitting the political highway together with the 
generation which they, mainly, represent.

<F P=106> [Unattributed article under the rubric "Topic of Current </F>
Interest": "The Kind of Liberals We Are"] 
  [Text] Yegor Gaydar called the adjustment of 
reforms--which became inevitable in the environment of 
disastrously mounting nonpayments that threatened to bring about 
the collapse of our economy--a "new course." However, Gaydar 
apparently had not surmised yet that the "new course" would also 
signify the bankruptcy of Russian liberalism as the philosophy 
of the reforms that were implemented on his initiative. "The 
Moor has done his work"--liberalism has performed its "fire 
brigade" function, dealing a lethal blow to the command economy 
and opening the floodgates to the elements of the market, and 
something else should take its place. 
<H5>  They Are Fighting `Against' Rather Than `For' </H5>
  The picture of a party buildup which was undoubtedly 
stimulated by the parliamentary elections, or more precisely 
their results, appears to be getting clearer. It is as if 
everybody suddenly understood that it is difficult to win 
elections without parties, without their local structures. 
Unlike what some prominent democrats maintained, referring to 
completely different conditions--those of a stable society with 
a structure of long duration, and of an American rather than 
European type--parties have not at all become a matter of the 
past. The struggle "against" still prevails. 
  However, what is noteworthy here? The fact that parties of a 
democratic hue, whether newly built-up or transforming into some 
kind of new quality, are still more disposed to fight "against" 
rather than "for." Along with other causes, this is the effect 
of the previous stage of the struggle, when the strategy of the 
entire democratic movement was built on the basis of the 
"against" principle--against the omnipotence of the CPSU, 
against real socialism, against "the Red empire," and so on. 
  I am trying to understand the new platform of the Russian 
Movement for Democratic Reforms (RDDR). As is known, it suffered 
an unequivocal defeat in the elections, failing to make it over 
the 5 percent threshold. What conclusion have its leaders drawn? 
Gavriil Popov says: "Indeed, I understood as early as after 
August 1991 and the choice of a new course that voters would 
flee from the fronts of the government, that a backup line 
needed to be built which would stop them from fleeing and draw 
them toward itself.... However...we put this backup line too 
close. People ran past not only us but also Volskiy, Travkin, 
and even the Russian Communist Party--they ran all the way to 
Zhirinovskiy." 
  What does this mean if we decipher it? It means that the 
RDDR 
should have taken up harsh opposition with regard to the ruling 
reformers. At the same time, yet another RDDR leader, Anatoliy 
Sobchak, stressed: The movement should be based on a commonsense 
policy and become a genuinely liberal party. If that is so, what 
is liberalism about? About criticizing the government in a 
parlance approximating that of Zhirinovskiy? In particular, the 
liberalism of the RDDR, as interpreted by Popov, began to merge 
not only with a confrontation with the government but also with 
anti-Westernism (genuine or affected); patriotic and populist 
notes began to be heard in it. 
  Neither the PRES [Party of Russian Unity and Accord] headed 
by Sergey Shakhray nor the "Apple" in which Grigoriy Yavlinskiy 
sets the tone can be called liberal in the strict sense of the 
word, although they undoubtedly include typical liberal 
democrats. However, they have the already mentioned 
preponderance of "against" motives in common with the RDDR. For 
some, it is against the president and the government, for 
others, it is against Russia's Choice. 
  The most powerful democratic bloc, which is currently being 
transformed into the Russia's Choice party headed by Yegor 
Gaydar, is perhaps the most liberal of all blocs and parties: 
putting its stake on owners; market liberalism, and in a sense 
even market romanticism; an ode to the bourgeois (in the 
favorable meaning of the word). The preelection slogans of 
"Liberty," "Property," and "Legality" are typically liberal. 
However, recently the weight of arguments "against" has also 
increased sharply in this quarter. This has happened due to the 
emergence of a new front in the struggle--against the government 
of Viktor Chernomyrdin, present and past colleagues of Yegor 
Timurovich who do not share his views on the progress of reforms. 
<H5>  What Ideals Do We Defend? </H5>
  Liberal democracy Russian-style is, in a way, a thing unto 
itself. Those who view our indigenous liberalism in conjunction 
with, say, Western analogs will certainly end up at an impasse. 
For example, when we now refer to the liberal intelligentsia, 
the liberal opposition, and so on, we frequently mean the 
phenomenon to which Dostoyevskiy referred in his time and which 
is characteristic only of us. The great writer and philosopher 
emphasized this: "Our entire liberal party (the segment of the 
public with a liberal disposition--note by A.K.) has passed the 
endeavor by, without participating in it or touching it; the 
party merely negated and giggled." 
  We have many liberal democrats who are only capable of 
making 
mischief and ridiculing anything and everything as they view the 
events in the country following August 1991 from the sidelines, 
looking down on them, not participating in real politics and the 
affairs of the country in a positive way but merely "negating" 
and "giggling," poisoning everything with pessimism and 
hopelessness and spreading the catastrophic sentiment. We also 
have those who, no sooner had they touched upon the real 
endeavor than they got burned and dropped it, cursing everybody 
and everything. They are liberal maximalists. Since it has not 
gone their way, may the fires of hell consume everything. 
  A version concerning the so-called conspiracy which has 
stirred up our society also indicates that Russian liberalism is 
a special phenomenon. It was clear from the very beginning that 
this was a provocation. But who brought it into the world (let 
us for now ignore the issue of the sponsor), who launched it, 
and who advertised it most extensively? Our liberal democrats 
from the mass media. For some reason, Yegor Yakovlev resolved to 
publish the version in OBSHCHAYA GAZETA, and for some reason, 
Yevgeniy Kiselev considered it feasible to first familiarize 
tens of millions of TV viewers with it through "Itogi" on the 
Independent Television channel, and to subsequently endow the 
idea of a "conspiracy" with a certain credibility in a string of 
other "conspiracies" in yet another edition of "Itogi," using to 
this end Dmitriy Furman and Aleksandr Minkin. 
  This is yet another example of how representatives of the 
liberal intelligentsia, in a rather traditional manner, benefit 
the forces of counterreform and the adversaries of democracy by 
rousing our society and spreading the catastrophic sentiment. We 
ourselves provoke, and fertilize the soil for the appearance of 
Zhirinovskiys, and we ourselves are later overcome by hysteria 
and panic, naturally blaming the authorities for everything. We 
truly do not know what we are doing. 
  Putting it plainly, the rallying ability of liberalism is 
poor. For a long time I failed to understand why the leaders of 
our democracy did not get around to explaining to people what 
kind of society we wanted to build, what our new ideals were, 
and so on. After all, our fellow citizens may be suffering even 
more from uncertainty, lack of confidence in the future, and 
what to them appears to be hopelessness than from economic 
hardship. 
  Later, I understood that raising the issue in this manner is 
in principle unacceptable to them (the liberals), it sickens 
them. Are any additional explanations needed, given that we live 
by the laws of common sense, that the market economy will sort 
everything out, and that the mechanism of a rule-of-law state 
has been set in motion? Either an excessive workload or some 
other cause is preventing the fathers of our liberal democracy 
from recalling that even the most liberal society, for example 
the American, needs slogans and lofty ideals which mobilize and 
rally the citizens. They do not shun patriotism or spit upon the 
state. 
  Since liberalism hardly has a clearly mapped-out positive 
social ideal at all (apart from generalities concerning 
property, legality, and so on), and since it shuns notions such 
as "patriotism" and "statehood," and treats even the notion of 
social justice as cheap social populism, it--liberalism--cannot 
become a foundation for rallying democratic forces. 
  The camp of liberal democrats is doomed to disintegration 
under pressure from real life. We observed this after August 
1991, during the period between 21 September and 3-4 October, 
and on the eve of the elections; we are observing this now. 
There is no theoretical, ethical, or any other foundation on 
which the democratic forces could rally, except for the fear of 
a return of totalitarianism. All appeals to those whom we 
associate with democratic parties, blocs, and so on, not to feud 
or splinter, and instead to rally and unite--they are all a 
waste of time. A common platform should be developed first, or 
at the very least the scope of common interests for the struggle 
"for" rather than "against" should be determined. 
<H5>  Everything in Its Proper Time </H5>
  It would be incorrect to say that Russian liberalism is 
alien 
on our national soil. Liberalism is rooted in Russian 
history--in social thought and movement. It is inseparable from 
the "superfluous people" and "Westernism." Indeed, the dissident 
movement which always considered the Western type of democracy 
and public life in general to be its model certainly was a 
mighty source of liberal ideas. 
  Undoubtedly, the sudden "flare-up of love" for the West, the 
United States in particular, as a response to the hatred 
artificially fueled by Bolsheviks played a role, too. This love 
made its presence known as early as the period of Gorbachev's 
perestroyka. Our naive belief that "the West will help us" 
certainly was a factor. Having renounced confrontation, having 
removed the "iron curtain," having made major, at times 
unilateral concessions to the West, they said, we deserve the 
right to have the West respond in kind--to help us rise from the 
ruins of postcommunism. 
  Still, the response to our communist past was the main 
reason 
for the rise of liberalism in Russia. Since communism was 
rejected, its antipode, liberalism, gained favor (even more so 
given our national inclination to rush from one extreme to the 
other). However, the weakness of Russian liberalism also abides 
here. 
  First, the hopes for Western aid were not justified. Second, 
a transition from communism to democratic forms of existence 
turned out to be an exceptionally difficult endeavor. Besides, 
this transition implemented on the model of a liberal market 
economy favored by the West entailed many unfavorable 
consequences. Third, the principles of liberalism with their 
emphasis on civil rights and freedoms, the freedom of human 
personality in all of its manifestations, began to depreciate 
quite rapidly at the stage of revolutionary transition from one 
social formation to another against the background of the sudden 
impoverishment of many people, the unprecedented rampage of 
crime and, correspondingly, the aggravation of nostalgia for the 
past life in a united state. Fourth, many of our former 
liberals, including dissidents, have turned into proponents of 
authoritarianism. 
  In other words, liberalism somewhat prematurely proclaimed 
itself to have in hand the situation in Russia, which apparently 
is destined first to go through a different historic stage. 
Nonetheless, I believe that the tree of Russian liberalism, 
which, be that as it may, is deeply rooted in Russian society, 
will undoubtedly grow and bear fruit. This will happen, although 
not too soon. 
<H5>  After All, Yeltsin Is Right Rather Than Gaydar </H5>
  In general, a revolutionary transition from one social 
system 
to another is accomplished, as a rule, under conditions of rigid 
authoritarianism or dictatorship. Likewise, a new statehood is 
not at all built on the rubble of an empire on the basis of 
liberalism. 
  This is all the more true because the entire previous system 
of social orientation and spiritual values has been blown away. 
Millions of people have literally become depressed. The 
spiritual void has reached threatening proportions. This is 
precisely the time to create new myths and new social utopias, 
the time for any strong remedy to appear with a view to 
overcoming the state of depression of the nation and creating 
prerequisites for regular social well-being, if not for 
enthusiasm. 
  Nationalism has turned out to be the strongest idea capable 
of playing an integrating role at the initial stage of 
postcommunist development in virtually all former republics of 
the former USSR. To be sure, nationalism is dubious and 
dangerous for Russia in every respect. First, nationalism would 
unavoidably grow into great power chauvinism in this country 
which has multiple ethnic groups, given the underdevelopment of 
the Russian people's ethnic awareness. Second, it would rather 
become a disintegrating factor for Russia itself. Third, Russian 
nationalism, if it were to pick up steam nonetheless in the 
spirit of our ability to be extreme, would inevitably make our 
relations with virtually the entire world hostile and would 
destroy the process of integration within the framework of the 
CIS. 
  The ideas of patriotism, statehood, our spiritual heritage, 
and our best traditions have always been genuine integrators for 
Russia, and are certainly ready to be such at present. It 
appears to me that Boris Yeltsin has grasped or felt deep down 
the need to make the idea of statehood foremost. It was the 
mainstay of not only his message to the Federal Assembly but 
also quite of a number of presentations that followed. 
  It is precisely with the idea of statehood and patriotism, 
among other things, that a path toward social accord must be 
sought. I just do not see another idea. A strong state is a 
guarantee of overcoming the crisis faster, a prerequisite for 
mounting a vigorous struggle against crime. 
  However, it is also the most important condition for the 
exercise of civil rights and liberties. If a person is afraid 
for his life and the lives of his family, if he is afraid to go 
out during the evening hours, and has altogether stopped feeling 
secure, all talk of democracy, freedom, and so on turns into 
irritating demagoguery. 
  When Yegor Gaydar slights the idea of state regulation all 
the more because the most powerful state sector exists and 
speaks scornfully about the "advocates of state," I want to 
repeat the jocular statement all of us know well: "Yegor, you 
are not right." 
  First, the opinion of the people who in the course of the 
elections voiced dissatisfaction with the results of reforms 
cannot be ignored. The real weight of radical democrats in our 
society cannot be ignored, either. Second, as reforms are being 
carried out, we cannot forget about the people. With all the 
talk about "lobbying" and credit "infusions" into the 
agro-industrial complex, the military-industrial complex, and 
the fuel and energy complex, we somehow lose sight of the fact 
that tens of millions of people work in these sectors. We must 
not fail to think about their fate hiding behind generalities 
about the ineffectiveness of the state sector and the 
kolkhoz-sovkhoz system. 
  At times, it seems to me that Gaydar and some of his 
colleagues have just forgotten where they live and work. In the 
country that is called Russia, millions of people have 
frequently agreed to certain death. However, in the name of 
what? Was it for "cash on the barrel?" No! It was in the name of 
an idea, but by far not the one known as the "American idea"--a 
nice house with amenities, a lawn, affluence, personal 
independence, dignity, and so on. 
  The "Russian idea" is a spiritual idea. Frequently (if not 
always) it is steeped in utopianism and the setting of 
unrealizable goals. This is the root of many of our troubles. A 
change of values should take place which, in turn, should be a 
product of a more rational mass conscience, which is what 
happened with other (European) nations in their time. This 
process is already underway thanks to, among others, the "new 
Russians"; however, an entire stretch of social development will 
be needed for it to be completed. Nothing will work on the fly, 
in a cavalier fashion in this instance. Or else new values will 
be rejected and historically progressive reforms will fail, as 
happened in Iran under the shah. 
  We are, after all, a nation of astounding extremes! Just as 
furiously as our grandfathers fought the "hateful" capitalism in 
the name of the unknown, enticing socialism, their grandsons are 
fighting socialism in the name of capitalism, having no real 
knowledge of either one of them. The whole point is that appeals 
to go back to a stern reality which is based on common sense 
cannot be as inspiring as appeals to press ahead and fight for 
an unknown bright future.

<F P=106> [Article by Ye. Petrenko and A. Oslon, compiled on the basis </F>
of an analytical report of the Public Opinion Foundation: "Is 
the Political Situation in Russia Predictable?"; first paragraph 
is introductory paragraph] 
  [Text] The very first appraisals of the results of the 
Russian parliamentary elections announced on the night of Dec., 
13, 1993, on Channel One of the Ostankino TV Center, turned out 
to be shocking. All the forecasts of the election returns 
completely contradicted the real results of the voting. 
Therefore today, on the eve of the local elections (the 
presidential elections are not far off either), sociologists 
prefer simply to abstain from any forecasts, and newspapers -- 
from publishing any. And nevertheless: What has happened? What 
is happening? What may happen? 
<H5>  Error One: Victims of Self-Hypnosis </H5>
  Let us recall just a few attempts by newspapers and 
sociological centers to outstrip one another in predicting the 
outcome of the elections. 
  Komsomolskaya Pravda of Nov. 13, on the basis of a 
survey conducted among 40 prominent personalities in Russia, 
assured us: "No 'dark horses' are expected to emerge on Russian 
political scene. The pack of political leaders is the same: 
Yeltsin, Gaidar, Chernomyrdin, Yavlinsky..." 
  Almost simultaneously two newspapers -- Segodnya 
of Nov. 30 and MK of Dec. 1 -- published their 
conclusions on the composition of the State Duma on the basis of 
the opinion polls carried out by the All-Russia Center for 
Public Opinion and Market Research (VCIOM for short). In both 
publications the Liberal Democratic Party of Russia (LDPR) was 
left out of the picture. The measurements of public opinion by 
different centers, irrespective of their methods and 
technologies, did not vary much from one another. At the 
earliest stage of the election campaign Zhirinovsky and the LDPR 
were mentioned only at the tail of rating lists headed by 
Russia's Choice and Gaidar. 
  True, the first warning appeared already on Nov. 3 in 
Nezavisimaya Gazeta: simultaneously with a growth in 
the President and the government's rating the majority of the 
population wants a return to the situation as it existed before 
1985... Almost simultaneously -- on Oct. 30 -- the poll carried 
out among Russia's urban population by the Public Opinion 
Foundation put on record a reduction by nearly one-third (from 
19 to 13 percent) in the share of those voting for Russia's 
Choice with the simultaneous growth (also by one-third -- from 
13 to 19 percent) in the number of those who refused to go to 
the polls. 
  But at the same time, reports continued to be published 
featuring the results of street polls by VCIOM, according to 
which the popularity of Russia's Choice continued to grow. And 
Komsomolskaya Pravda reported on Nov. 13: Yegor 
Gaidar placed first in the list of top ten leaders, Yeltsin was 
the runner-up, and "Zhirinovsky was far behind somewhere in the 
middle of the remaining names on the list." 
  In the second half of November, on the eve of the TV 
election 
campaign, the fall in the popularity of Russia's Choice was 
already showing up in the results of street polls by the Center 
for the Study and Forecasting of Social Processes 
(Izvestia, Nov. 25), in VCIOM's polls on Moscow 
streets (MN, Dec. 5) and the polls conducted in 
Moscow over the phone by the Institute of Sociology and 
Parliamentarianism (the news program of TV's Channel One, Nov. 
25, 21:00 hrs). 
  But practically no one paid attention to this hardly 
pronounced, barely visible trend at that time. For all intents 
and purposes, researchers and journalists, hypnotized by 
"absolute" figures, did not admit that public opinion could 
change at such a rapid pace. Thus a person, who has never seen a 
storm in a desert, does not guess what the first gentle breeze 
may signal. 
  The same Center for the Study and Forecasting of Social 
Processes predicted in Izvestia on Nov. 25: "Russia's 
Choice... may count on 30 percent of the votes (compared with 34 
percent in mid-October and 32 percent at the beginning of the 
month)... communists may hope for 6 percent... as much as V. 
Zhirinovsky's party... The main struggle for leadership is 
unfolding between RC and Yavlinsky's bloc..." 
  We know of cases when voters, who did not manage to decide 
whom to cast their ballot for, reacted to these kind of 
forecasts in a fully definite manner: as a "joke" they voted for 
Zhirinovsky in the belief that it is this party that had no 
chance to win and that one vote would not change the picture. 
Nobody knows how many voters were guided by such considerations 
on election day. 
<H5>  Error Two: Ban on the Central Electoral Commission: Whom </H5>
Sociologists Were Lobbying For 
  Incidentally, Rossiiskya Gazeta warned in its 
December issues that Zhirinovsky's party was scoring points in 
the regions when it reported figures from Yekaterinburg: "In the 
past two weeks the number of the LDPR's sympathizers had 
increased more than fivefold." With a reference to the findings 
of the Sociograph Institute, Trud wrote about the 
same: "There is a deep gap between the sentiments of the 
inhabitants of the capitals... and those of the inhabitants of 
small towns and rural settlements. The position of the Russian 
provinces will largely determine the outcome of the voting... 
The assertions about the pro-governmental bloc's unconditional 
victory do not look convincing." And on Dec. 11 L. Sedov (VCIOM) 
in the newspaper Segodnya went even farther: "...The 
LDPR's second place may come as a surprise... This party seems 
to have revealed an ability for a powerful finish..." 
  As it has become clear today, some sociological service had 
to take just one step to grasp the scope and speed of this 
spurt. But time was already running out. Ten days before the 
elections (at the very height of events) the ban on publishing 
the results of opinion polls came into force. Notably, L. 
Sedov's forecast about "the LDPR's powerful finish" appeared 
already in defiance of this ban (on Dec. 4 similar data were 
also obtained by the Public Opinion Foundation, but publications 
were discontinued beginning with Dec. 2). 
  The people did not know even what sociologists were 
beginning 
to predict. 
  At this very time sociologist Vsevolod Vilchek called upon 
his colleagues to keep silent: "If my colleagues did not rush to 
the air today with yet another batch of sensations, but demanded 
of the powers that be that they adopt emergency measures to 
protect spectators-electors against demagoguery, including the 
publication of uncontrollable sociological findings... 
Sociological lobbying is already a banality; there are already 
signs of something new: ordered sociological killings, at any 
rate -- assassination attempts... The best thing we can do is 
temporarily halt the publication of findings by any of the 
sociological services." 
  But if sociologists did lobby anyone, then by no means was 
it 
Zhirinovsky. The ban imposed by the Central Electoral Commission 
provoked the publication of obsolete findings and premature 
conclusions. 
<H5>  Error Three: Effect of TV Advertising: Whom the Central </H5>
Electoral Commission Helped 
  Many newspaper pages have been devoted to the election 
advertising campaign on TV, specifically, about the absence of 
dialogues between political leaders both with each other and 
with journalists, which would hinder the effectiveness of the 
most populist promises. It will be recalled that it is the 
Central Electoral Commission that chose a procedure which 
permitted solely the "monologue" forms of broadcasting. 
  The results of the Public Opinion Foundation's polls were 
used to calculate the index showing how successful each party 
was in its advertising campaign. The index was calculated daily 
on the basis of replies to two questions: "Whom will you vote 
for at the elections?" and "Which bloc do you think about the 
most?" Point "1" was awarded if the respondent remembered the 
bloc he was going to vote for, "2" if he remembered the bloc he 
was not going to vote for, "1" if he did not remember the 
opposing bloc, and "2" if he did not remember "his own." 
  Let us cite the average scores for all respondents who 
watched the TV campaign ads of certain blocs and parties:

period 


<H5>  Error Four: Underestimating the Role of the Provinces </H5>
  One of the key conclusions to be drawn by sociologists 
themselves after what has happened is this: in such forecasts it 
is impossible to rely on large cities (where it is easier to 
conduct opinion polls). You may judge the degree of the error 
stemming therefrom by the extent that the electors' preferences 
differed in large cities and small towns, settlements and 
villages: 


----------------------------------------------------------------------------- 
|                  |Russia            |Large Cities      |Small Cities      | 
----------------------------------------------------------------------------- 
|LDPR              |23                |21                |26                |

----------------------------------------------------------------------------- 


<H5>  Error Five: The People Did Not Keep Silent, but Neither Did </H5>
They Tell the Whole Truth 
  There is one more distorting factor: after the sufficiently 
rigid actions in relation to the opposition by far not everyone 
was sincere in answering the blunt questions of the polls on how 
they would vote. According to the results of one of our research 
studies (on Dec. 25), from 12-14 percent (voters favoring the 
Yavlinsky-Boldyrev-Lukin bloc and Russia's Choice) to 18-37 
percent (those in favor of the LDPR and the Agrarian Party 
respectively) either doubted this sincerity or denied it in 
general. 
<H5>  Error Six: Those Who Climb Fast Fall Quickly </H5>
  Having talked about how the real picture was being 
distorted, 
let us ask this question: how did this distorting, for its part, 
influence public opinion? Who stood to lose by this? 
  Let us cite the breakdown of replies to the question: 
"Knowing the preliminary results of the voting, what party or 
bloc would you have voted for today?" 
  For the sake of clarity the electoral associations are 
grouped in four categories -- the Right (Russia's choice, Party 
of Russian Unity &amp; Accord, Russian Democratic Reforms 
Movement); 
the Center (Yavlinsky-Boldyrev-Lukin bloc, Civic Union, Russia's 
Future -- New Names, Democratic Party); the Opposition 
(Communist Party, Liberal Democratic Party, Agrarian Party) and 
the "special interest" groups -- Women of Russia, Kedr, Dignity 
and Mercy): 


----------------------------------------------------------------------------- 
|Right             |Center            |Opposition        |Special Interest  | 
|                  |                  |                  |Groups            | 
----------------------------------------------------------------------------- 
|Before elections                                                           | 
----------------------------------------------------------------------------- 
|21                |12                |19                |5                 | 
----------------------------------------------------------------------------- 
|During the voting                                                          | 
----------------------------------------------------------------------------- 
|19                |13                |27                |6                 | 
----------------------------------------------------------------------------- 
|After elections (knowing the result)                                       | 
----------------------------------------------------------------------------- 
|24                |13                |27                |5                 | 
----------------------------------------------------------------------------- 


  It should be noted that the 5 percent of the votes lost by 
the progovernmental bloc Russia's Choice solely owing to society 
being ignorant of what was going on was one-fifth of the entire 
number of votes which it could have polled.

<F P=106> [Interview with Colonel Stanislav Terekhov by Nadezhda </F>
Garifullina; place and date not given: "We Were Sentenced to 
Death"] 
  [Text] A good deal has already been written and much 
is known about the October tragedy, but still there are quite a 
few blank spots. In particular, what actually happened on the 
evening of 24 September next to the staff headquarters of the 
CIS United Armed Forces? The only person who could shed light on 
this is Colonel Stanislav Terekhov. But at that time he had been 
arrested and was out of the game. But there were many versions 
floating about: from accusations of terrorism--in the democratic 
press--and provocations--alas, in certain patriotic 
publications--to suggestions that he was captured when he left 
the House of Soviets to see his family. In a word, everything is 
covered by a shroud of mystery. Therefore when I went to see 
Terekhov in his home the first thing I asked him to do was 
clarify the incident on Leningrad Avenue. 
  [Terekhov] Then I shall begin "from the beginning." On 21 
September at 2000, as soon as the coup d'etat had taken place, 
quite different mechanisms from the ones that had been operating 
theretofore were put in play. We understood quite well that the 
presidential side should not wait until the House of Soviets had 
been worn down by the blockade to such an extent that it would 
have been possible to starve them out as the Tatars once 
captured Russian fortresses. The blockade in the center of 
Moscow could not last forever. 
  On 23 September several sources informed me that under the 
leadership of Korzhakov and other figures who have armed state 
structures, a "surprise" was being prepared for the opening of 
the special Congress of People's Deputies. By that evening the 
probability of a "surprise" was very great. It was necessary to 
make a decision. I spoke with several of our leaders in the 
Supreme Soviet: We must not remain passive because if we are we 
will be swatted like flies. 
  X hour was approaching, there was no time left to verify and 
verify again. The Congress was just about to open and then the 
mechanism of provocation would go to work. I was faced with a 
choice: Either hope for the best and not do anything, or.... 
  [Garifullina] And you decided to act? 
  [Terekhov] I understood that in order to extricate ourselves 
from the situation imposed on us with the fewest losses I had to 
take responsibility for myself. I will not call this 
self-sacrifice, but believe me I knew where I was going. 
Speaking in military language, I decided to divert the enemy's 
attention by conducting a secondary maneuver. 
  [Garifullina] In other words, you went to the staff 
headquarters of the CIS United Armed Forces. But why did you 
have to do this? 
  [Terekhov] Indeed, everyone was confused: Why? But if we 
were 
to take something it should be the staff headquarters--it is a 
kilometer away from the House of Soviets. And the CIS staff 
headquarters was absolutely abandoned, there were no weapons, 
and no communications...of course, if you look at it seriously 
it is insignificant, but it would do for a diversionary 
maneuver.... 
  The action I undertook made it possible--I am not speaking 
about after-effects now--to introduce confusion into enemy 
ranks. They are not about to storm the House of Soviets if there 
is some kind of trouble in their rear, and they know nothing. In 
brief, when they cannot understand the intention, the enemy 
usually becomes stupid and begins to rush about. And, as a rule, 
they postpone their basic operation. The maneuver succeeded; the 
diversion of attention was significant, you know that. And at 
that time I was shut off from all sources of information. But 
you knew the reaction both from the other side and from the 
leaders of the Supreme Soviet: They either pretended not to know 
or really did not guess the true meaning of what was happening. 
And those who wanted to clear themselves simply placed the 
responsibility on me. 
  [Garifullina] And what role did Anpilov play in these 
events? 
  [Terekhov] I want to say this right away and put a stop to 
all the rumors that have been circulating since that evening: He 
is not a provocateur, not a spy, and not a secret agent. Viktor 
Anpilov as a public leader and the chief of his party has done 
his job to the best of his abilities and opportunities. That is 
a statement of fact. And the insinuations that are being spread 
around him are on the conscience of those who did this. 
  [Garifullina] Stanislav Nikolayevich, on that evening 
Anpilov 
called for people to come to the headquarters of the CIS United 
Armed Forces to help you. This is why passions have flared up 
concerning him. Tell us, did you have a conversation with him 
before your departure for Leningrad Avenue? 
  [Terekhov] The conversation occurred somewhere around 15 or 
20 minutes before nine, about five minutes before I departed for 
Leningrad Avenue. Incidentally, I did not inform him or the 
others of the details; I told them briefly in two words: I am 
going there, I am going to stir up a ruckus there, and you make 
sure that the forces are drawn there...it was necessary to 
convince the people, otherwise they simply would not have gone 
there...the 150 or so men who arrived at the staff headquarters 
made the operation a success. Those who did not want this began 
to raise a ruckus around me and Anpilov. They said that this 
action did much harm. Excuse me, but if what should have 
happened on that evening in front of the House of Soviets had 
actually happened, if we had not frustrated their plans, then 
you would have had something to say about the actions of 
Terekhov and Anpilov and those who were with us. 
  [Garifullina] Tell me, did you actually take the place over? 
  [Terekhov] We did not have to. I was blocking the 
checkpoint, 
where the soldiers were, in the first place, in order to prevent 
people from getting into the staff headquarters. While I was 
blocking it some pistols were taken from the soldiers. I was 
blamed for this. But, please, why would I want to steal pistols 
when I had an automatic and my people, the ones that were 
providing the protection, were armed? They had nothing left to 
do but look for formal indications of the commission of a crime. 
First: resisting the militia. But, on the contrary, I wanted to 
save the militia. And the person who fired at the militiaman did 
that as a special case, I want to emphasize that. My order from 
the very beginning was--do not shoot! 
  [Garifullina] Did you give the commands over a loudspeaker? 
  [Terekhov] No, it was night on a deserted street and you 
could hear well, even witnesses have confirmed this. And 
suddenly, during the course of the operation, in spite of my 
command, a shot rang out...I was forced to remain there and make 
sure nobody was wounded. Not a single bullet was fired at the 
staff headquarters and not a single person went in there. 
Therefore what kind of seizure could there be? In front of the 
House of Soviets people were told to divert and shift the 
attention of the opposing side. 
  [Garifullina] I want to clarify one more detail pertaining 
to 
Anpilov. Did you ask him to announce this operation at the rally? 
  [Terekhov] Yes, yes! 
  [Garifullina] Why am I asking you this? Viktor Ivanovich 
told 
me: "I promised Stanislav and I kept my word. If I had it to do 
over again I would not have done it that way." 
  [Terekhov] He did what I told him to do. And I said that the 
officers were conducting an operation on Leningrad Avenue and 
they had to be supported. They went there and supported them, 
and there would have been no casualties were it not for the 
shooting that we did not start. And the bullet that hit the 
elderly woman was fired after I had left in the crossfire 
between the militia and someone else who appeared later. And 
again the real murderer was not found! We were accused of theft, 
bearing arms, resistance, and mass disorder, but nobody was 
accused of murder. It is strange that the person who fired the 
weapon was not found, just like the one who ran down Tolokneyev 
on 1 May. 
  [Garifullina] Under what circumstances were you arrested? 
  [Terekhov] My arm was injured, the upper half of my shoulder 
was paralyzed. Incidentally, I gave the command to leave weapons 
on Khodynskoye Field, and I threw my automatic down there too 
because I knew that if they saw me with an automatic within a 
hundred meters they would shoot as though they were in the 
middle of crossfire. Then when they were taking me around to all 
the militia divisions and command headquarters they were 
continuously, every five minutes, poking me with the muzzle of 
their gun and saying: We are going to shoot you now. And I was 
already helpless, in handcuffs. 
  [Garifullina] What was the most difficult thing for you 
after 
your arrest? 
  [Terekhov] A person can stand anything--beating, insults, 
when they have you against the wall, on the floor, or wherever 
they wish. After a certain amount of time the wounds heal, the 
pain passes, and the organism restores itself. There are 
nonphysical aspects-- betrayal, an extremely vulgar, brutish 
attitude toward an officer-- this is the sort of thing that is 
not forgotten. 
  After my arrest I was sent to the military command post. I 
spent almost a day there. The next day the military investigator 
from the military procuracy of the Moscow Military District 
arrived--he was the chief of the investigation division, Colonel 
Morin. I emphasize that he was a representative of the 
procuracy! Incidentally he came with a representative of the 
Main Military Procuracy. They came with a platoon of 
special-purpose militiamen and representatives of the Ministry 
of Internal Affairs and took me to the 109th Division. That I 
will never forget!... They wanted to break my morale; they 
probably thought that all it would take would be one stressful 
blow and they could wind me around their finger. At 0300 in the 
morning they were working me over with cross interrogation, 
constantly bringing in militiamen from the division, who were 
half drunk to boot. Chance helped to get me out of there alive. 
I told them: I will testify only through my wife, after she 
calls a lawyer. And I also told them directly if anything 
happens to me that you have thought up, things will go badly for 
you as well. I no longer had anything to lose. But they stopped 
the physical torture. But they continuously threatened to shoot 
me if I tried to escape...they brought me to the point where the 
doctor insisted on immediate hospitalization. But the 
investigator had received a categorical instruction--in no case 
send him to the hospital. The vehicle with the special purpose 
militia detachment was constantly at my side. They would take me 
in the vehicle--there were five automatic riflemen with me, in 
front--a car and behind--a bus. They took me to the doctor--also 
surrounded by automatic riflemen, and I was in handcuffs, I 
could barely stand on my feet, I could barely move...and that is 
the way it was until they put me in the detention cell.... 
  [Garifullina] Were you surprised that the army participated 
in those events and on the side of the ones committing the coup 
d'etat? 
  [Terekhov] That, of course, is the most difficult and bitter 
question. It is difficult to accuse the entire army, although I 
am not now inclined to defend the military. On the contrary! 
Most of the officers in this conflict proved themselves to be 
helpless and indifferent individuals. I do not want to 
generalize, I am speaking only about those who looked on 
apathetically at what was happening in the House of 
Soviets...they all waited, quieted down, and continued as if 
there were nothing for them to do. If the Supreme Soviet had won 
they all would have shouted for joy, fired into the air, 
saluted, and rushed back to their jobs. This is how morally 
degraded our power structures are! I think we will have to work 
very long and hard to make the sense of duty and honor 
correspond to the ranks, shoulder boards, and positions.... 
Maybe it is not right to accuse those who were in the military 
units. If the order had been clear and if they had done 
preparatory work, what we could have hoped for! But they tell 
us: You are the Union of Officers. Yes, we, the Union of 
Officers, sent all of our forces there. But in the final 
analysis we are a public organization, we do not train terrorist 
groups, and we are not a state structure with weapons, vehicles, 
and everything else. We express the position of a certain part 
of the population. But there are people who, because of their 
service duty, respond--the vice president, the chairman of the 
Supreme Soviet, the power ministries.... 
  But to reproach the officers we have left...our 
officers--regardless of whether they were full time or 
reserve--went and stayed until the end, they were the last to 
leave, and all this was under gunfire. 
  [Garifullina] But why did we still suffer a defeat? 
  [Terekhov] You have touched upon what is really the most 
painful and bitter subject. Believe me, in jail during those 
sleepless nights I was tortured by the question of why all this 
happened. And I will tell you frankly that this is the lesson I 
learned. The high leaders, placed in an extreme situation, 
should have thought everything through ahead of time and made 
wise decisions...their passivity, their inactivity, and even 
lack of talent with respect to many issues--I do not want to go 
into this now--contributed to the defeat. I attended meetings of 
the high leaders with the participation of Rutskoy, Makashov, 
and Achalov, who were supposed to organize a powerful 
resistance, which was the main thing at the time. The tasks were 
set but as though for God himself: There was no mechanism for 
specific people to carry out the orders. Even at that time I 
understood that we were hostages. I circulated in the high 
spheres and at the same time I had sources of information in the 
lower structures. We found ourselves surrounded by flags and 
sooner or later the shooting had to begin. And it began.... 
  [Garifullina] The president is preparing a memorandum 
concerning accord. There are also other forces that are calling 
for us to reach out to one another--this is from the opposition. 
How do you feel about these proposals? 
  [Terekhov] In principle it is natural to speak about accord 
and civil peace. We too are in favor of this. The form in which 
it is expressed and by whom are another matter. I personally do 
not intend to sign any agreements with people who are criminals 
and want to make me one. Second, and I want to emphasize this 
especially: Some people want their hands untied so that they can 
continue their shameless behavior, their unlawful and illegal 
activity to plunder the country. And they will "push" for this, 
tying the hands and feet of those who sign it. But let them sign 
their own paper and swear that they will never again fire 
weapons at the people, they will never again bring a tank out 
into the square, let them admit to their own people that they 
committed a crime and are prepared to take responsibility for 
this under the law or at least agree to early elections. And 
indicate this in a memorandum and then I will sign it.... 
  [Garifullina] What are your immediate plans? 
  [Terekhov] On 18 April we held the all-Union congress of the 
Union of Officers. Our telephone number is 257-01-68. Our 
purpose is to evaluate the situation, draw lessons from the 
October tragedy, and map out the future. We want to determine 
what is left of us in this stage, which forces we have 
preserved. As a public organization we are acting independently, 
we were not, and now we certainly will not be and do not want to 
be considered a military detachment of the CPSU, the Communist 
Party of the Russian Federation, or any other, say, monarchist 
or national party. The Union of Officers is strengthening its 
roots, its foundations as military statesmen. 
  At the same time I have understood for a long time that it 
is 
not enough to conduct active political work within the framework 
of the Union of Officers. We need a new independent political 
structure. But we want to preserve the basic principles on which 
the Union of Officers was built: These are statehood, great 
power status, patriotism, honor, and dignity. These are the 
precise goals a great-power party proclaims. 
  [Garifullina] Stanislav Nikolayevich, you spent a total of 
157 days in Lefortovo and, without exaggeration, you looked 
death in the face. This is true. Tell us, were you always 
optimistic or did you despair and have a sense of hopelessness? 
  [Terekhov] Sometimes I had the feeling there was no way out. 
I knew that I was threatened with more than one sentence. They 
hit me with four charges, and two of them were serious, 
including especially dangerous state crimes--15 years apiece. Of 
all the people in jail nobody had more charges filed against 
them than I did: four of them! I understood that they would want 
to put me in jail, and that even if I beat my head against the 
wall I would not get out of there. And I was seized by 
hopelessness.... 
  But I had confidence in the fact that this could not go on 
forever. In any case, these people would not live forever. 
  [Garifullina] Did your family have a hard time without you? 
  [Terekhov] If I believed in anyone to the very end it was my 
wife and family. I was simply moved by their moral 
steadfastness. Larisa and I have three daughters: The eldest is 
17, she is finishing school, and she intends to enter a legal 
institute; the middle one is nine, and the youngest is a sixth 
grader. I received this apartment through my job but on 23 
September I was discharged from the army; they quickly 
documented this with an order after the fact both from the 
minister and the academy. They apparently thought that after a 
person has been in jail he will not worry about violations with 
his discharge. Now, naturally, I will be reinstated, and again 
through the court. So, about my family. Larisa Aleksandrovna is 
a great person. Not every woman is capable of going through what 
she has been through. I have brought out in her capabilities 
which even I did not suspect she had. 
  [Garifullina] Who do you consider to be your teachers? 
  [Terekhov] I have had many teachers; I consider them to be 
the people who have gone through the school of life. I served in 
Nerchinsk, where they exiled the Decembrists, in Chita, 
Ulan-Ude, Krasnyy Chekoy, Sakhalin, and several places that are 
not even on the map...there my teachers were the commanders with 
whom I served. In recent years my teachers on the political 
plane have been those who have been caught up in the overall 
struggle. Some of them have strong points which I do not have. I 
learn from them. From Zhirinovskiy I learned one thing; everyone 
is learning from him now, incidentally. From Zyuganov--another 
thing, from Baburin--a third thing, from Sterligov--a fourth 
thing...these political figures have created themselves. How did 
they do it? What is keeping them from becoming nationwide 
leaders? In this sense I have no idol or guiding star. 
  In prison I had a chance to think about everything 
unhurriedly, to sum up the past and think about the future if 
such a possibility were to present itself. Fortunately, it did 
present itself. I am back with my comrades again and life and 
the struggle continue....

<F P=106> [Article by Galina Odinokova: "Who Will Fight the Mafia. MVD </F>
Workers Are Confident That Only Professionals Can"] 
  [Text] The Analytical Center for Socioeconomic Policy under 
the Administration of the President of Russia, headed by Petr 
Filippov, has prepared and submitted to Boris Yeltsin a document 
titled: "Organized Crime and the Prospect of Nationalists Taking 
Over Power in Russia." A number of the media have published it. 
In the opinion of the Center, the growth of organized crime, 
which has infiltrated organs of the MVD [Ministry of Internal 
Affairs] and local executive authority, jeopardizes Russia's 
economic and political development. Professionals from law 
enforcement organs are not indifferent to this information 
either, but they have their own attitude toward the conclusions 
of the analysts. Today we offer the reader an opportunity to 
become familiar with two of these opinions. 
  Vladimir Rushaylo--chief of the regional Administration for 
Fighting Organized Crime (RUOP) of the Moscow GUVD [City 
Internal Affairs Administration], militia colonel: 
  "As a practical worker responsible for the situation in 
Moscow, first of all I have doubts about many of the figures and 
generalizations presented in the document. For example, the 
thesis that `70-80 percent of privatized enterprises and 
commercial banks are forced to pay extortion money.' It would be 
stupid to deny it--such things exist, but to say that the 
absolute majority of enterprises are under the heel of criminal 
groupings is irresponsible at best. We know that this kind of 
information used to be disseminated by the criminal groupings 
themselves so that potential victims would reconcile themselves 
to paying them off without making a fuss. 
  "Incidentally, the criminals are also interested in 
disseminating the information that `all the militia is corrupt, 
there is no one to place our hopes in.' This is a kind of 
shocking-paralyzing statement for the victim: To resist, to 
defend your independence--is pointless, the power of the mafia 
is boundless, it is better to pay the money. From the same 
category comes the assertion that gangster formations everywhere 
have informers in organs of the militia, and state automotive 
inspection. I think that here too they have been laying it on 
too thick. There are informers, of course, but only a few. We 
regularly `round them up.' During the past year the Moscow RUOP 
has discovered 29 militia workers who have committed various 
kinds of official crimes. We do not deny this, just as we do not 
intend to tolerate traitors, and we will fight fiercely against 
them. 
  "The analysts advised the president to put together new 
formations consisting of people who have never before served 
either in the militia or in the Ministry of Security. And they 
suggest using in operations for suppressing organized crime 
workers temporarily assigned from other cities. As a practical 
worker I can say that for Moscow, for example, this method is 
not very acceptable. Operationally, the capital is such a 
complicated city that even native Muscovites usually adapt fully 
to the normal professional standard only after three to five 
years of working under the conditions of the capital. What about 
when it comes to work in the militia? 
  "The document's authors are under the impression that almost 
all the activity of subdivisions for fighting organized crime 
can be reduced basically to conducting raids and rounding up 
criminals, which affects only the small fry. But how is it then 
that in Moscow alone recently we have managed to bring criminal 
charges against seven thieves operating within the law? The 
professionals understand that the leaders of criminal groupings 
are unmasked only as a result of in-depth operational 
developments and penetration into the criminal environment. 
  "But if it did come down to raids, police lines, 
inspections, 
and ambushes, these too are absolutely necessary in daily 
militia work. Here is a summary of the results of one of the 
recent Moscow operations: 225 crimes uncovered, more than 30 
units of firearms and 53 bladed weapons confiscated, 49 stolen 
motor vehicles found. In one day! 
  "There are suggestions that simply need work. Take just the 
idea of granting law enforcement organs the right to preventive 
detention for up to three months without charging individuals 
who are suspected of organized crime. In Tatarstan, for example, 
they introduced such a rule, the territory was purged of 
gangsters, and...they immediately moved to Moscow. Such 
decisions must be made at the state and not the regional level. 
  "Subdivisions created relatively recently for fighting 
organized crime are quite capable of fighting it today, but this 
requires well-considered legal instruments as well. And the 
dissemination in the press of documents like the note from the 
Analytical Center does more to advertise organized crime than 
help fight against it. It is necessary to begin with a serious 
reformation of the investigatory apparatus, with the 
introduction of an alternative form of investigation in keeping 
with the article of the Criminal Code of the Russian Federation 
entitled `Gangsterism,' whereby the courts, when examining such 
cases with clear indications of gangsterism but without the 
necessary proof, will return the materials for further 
investigation. And when the people arrested have been caught 
red-handed--the question of the convictions should be decided in 
the shortest possible periods of time, without reducing 
liability or punitive measures." 
  Azaliya Dolgova--president of the International 
Criminological Association, doctor of jurisprudence, professor: 
  "From the standpoint of the problem raised in the materials 
of the Analytical Center, there is nothing basically new. Except 
for one thing: In the subdivisions that will be fighting 
organized crime there should not be...workers of the MVD or the 
former Ministry of Security. Where did this kind of disrespect 
for organizations on the leading edge of crime-fighting come 
from? If there are complaints--they should be concretized. Each 
case should be investigated legally--and only after this 
procedure should those who have been penalized be prohibited 
from working in the new subdivisions. 
  "Look at the position in which law enforcement organs have 
been placed today. The criminals are becoming more brazen with 
each passing day, they are arming themselves, and they are 
strengthening their ties with corrupt bureaucrats of the higher 
echelons of power. And no legal base has been created for 
fighting against them. So in the absence of legal instruments 
the workers have had to use force that is sometimes unjustified. 
We are coming closer to a real danger of punishment of criminals 
on the spot. Those who are objecting to the adoption of the 
appropriate laws today are also provoking this. 
  "Another question for the analysts: Where do they intend to 
gather up these professionals? Invite them from the West? Or 
call in scholars from academic institutions who provide 
theoretical knowledge for practical workers? We are now engaged 
in a persistent war against crime and the enemy is taking the 
offensive. And instead of introducing fresh professional forces, 
even after achieving success they want to begin to settle scores 
with everyone left in the trenches--the authors of the document 
are proposing: `All for the state!' What is the enemy doing 
during this time? Naturally, he is continuing to attack. And 
what are the `people in the trenches' doing? Of course, they are 
starting to philosophize: Is it worth the struggle? 
  "The idea itself of creating special services, of course, is 
productive. It is worth considering from all angles. But it 
cannot be embodied without resolving the key problems of the 
organization of the fight against crime as a whole. Without 
reforming criminal procedure and operational investigatory 
activity. 
  "We must not arbitrarily change units in a system--this will 
necessarily warp other of its elements. As a result of serious 
work, the analysts have come to extremely sore spots in society. 
But instead of turning to professionals they simply deny them 
the right to work. And our esteemed workers from the Analytical 
Center have forgotten about many essential elements without 
which a persistent struggle is simply impossible, or else they 
have considered them to be of less importance. For example, the 
fact that our legislators have not yet adopted a law on 
corruption in combination with a law on organized crime--new 
deputies of the State Duma are even lobbying for this unified 
mechanism for fighting the mafia." 
  From the dossier of the Main Administration for Combating 
Organized Crime of the Ministry of Internal Affairs of the 
Russian Federation--the results of 1993: 
  "Promising signs of stabilization of the dynamic of the 
growth of crime have appeared. In spite of predictions of 
certain specialists, in 1993 this indicator rose by only 1.4 
percent, while in 1992 the dynamic growth amounted to 26 
percent. A significant decline in the dynamic was brought about 
by the initiative of internal affairs organs. The number of 
organized crime groupings disclosed increased by 30.8 percent 
(5,681 groups, including 87 of a gangster inclination). They 
have confiscated 11,737 units of firearms from the criminals, 
which is 2.6 times more than during the preceding year. They 
have confiscated nine times more bladed weapons. RUOP 
subdivisions have confiscated 4.4 tonnes of narcotics. Twice as 
many corrupt bureaucrats have been taken to court. While in 1992 
throughout Russia only nine cases were reported under the 
article of the Criminal Code `Gangsterism,' last year there were 
44 of these cases. Convictions were handed down against 20 
thieves operating within the law, and there are now 62 of these 
thieves in prison." 
  We share the bewilderment of representatives of law 
enforcement organs regarding the evaluation of professionals. 
Indeed, it is unfitting to run roughshod over specialists who 
have accumulated experience in fighting organized crime. But you 
cannot get away from the facts: In terms of the number of 
murders per capita we are almost ahead of everyone else on the 
planet. When will we be delivered from fear? The government 
today is discussing a nationwide crime fighting program that is 
unprecedented in history. But if we do not feel its results 
tomorrow, we will have a right to draw a tragic conclusion: The 
mafia is immortal, and there is no one who can fight it. It is 
getting late...Listen: Tomorrow!

<F P=106> [Article by A. Zharinov: "From the Nonparty Bloc?"] </F>
  [Text] All elections, whatever you say about them, have 
their own birthmarks. For example, an obligatory and unfailing 
attribute of past elections was the slogan concerning the 
indestructibility of the "bloc of communist and nonparty 
candidates." Anything else at that time was inconceivable for 
the party and people were united. 
  Today this slogan seems inappropriate and illogical. In 
actual fact, the Russian people here are united, and there are 
several dozen parties, each of which is endeavoring to "merge" 
with them and express their interests. If the formation of 
parties continues to be so dynamic, there is a fear that the 
people will not be enough to go round. 
  The people themselves, it has to be assumed, are beginning 
to 
understand that the parties standing in line to defend their 
interests at times represent no one and nothing. And have 
sometimes been created merely in order to "state," "protest," 
and "demonstrate." 
  We are persuaded that this is the case by the preliminary 
results of the elections to the oblast soviet of deputies. At 
least 10 political organizations, blocs, and movements have 
loudly stated their aspiration to fight for deputies' seats. The 
oblast organizations of Democratic Russia, the Free Russia 
People's Party, the Economic Freedom Party, the Russian 
Communist Workers Party, the Working Novosibirsk and Fatherland 
movements, and the Unity Association have actively begun to 
introduce their candidates. 
  The electorate remembers their periodic appearances on 
television and radio and in local publications. SOVETSKAYA SIBIR 
ran a serious of publications devoted to election associations. 
  Let us leave in the background for the time being the 
original lack of coordination (the amendments to the Election 
Statutes, revision of the district boundaries), which 
undoubtedly contributed to the false start. Let us take a closer 
look at the problem. 
  Of the deputies elected, only three represent political 
parties and movements. From the Communist Party of Russia, 
Viktor Kuznetsov, secretary of the oblast party committee, and 
Vladimir Karlov, director of Vocational-Technical School 16 
(both ran in Berdsk), and from Russia's Choice, Nikolay 
Krasnikov, chief of the administration of the Koltsovo community. 
  However strange, well-known and respected people, skillful 
politicians, are among those who have withdrawn. Account was 
taken of the candidates' political past and an ability to think 
in a manner out of the ordinary and present one's position 
interestingly. And of the subjective, psychological factor, of 
course. 
  Nonetheless, the ability to organize the campaigning was, I 
believe, determining in the election. It was frequently 
undertaken in talentless manner, with the old methodological 
baggage. The cliche that the Russian Communist Workers Party 
defends the interests of the working people and supports a 
change of political and economic course was bandied about, for 
example. And the party members evidently believed that this said 
it all. The people would be aroused and would head for the 
polls. They did not. For almost the same slogans had emanated 
from other political forces. 
  The philosophy of campaigning self-sufficiency (we are for 
the people!) proved unproductive in the general chorus of 
people's defenders. Having had a surfeit of slogans concerning 
protection unrealized with each new election, the people 
preferred to ignore them and to vote, at best, for those whom 
they know best, not showing their affection for any party. 
  Nor was the tried-and-tested, reserve campaigning echelon: 
the arrival in Novosibirsk of political leaders of Russia V. 
Anpilov, V. Lipitskiy, and I. Malyarov, any help. The electorate 
greeted them warmly, but many people simply failed to show up at 
the polls. 
  The program of the oblast organization of the Communist 
Party 
of the Russian Federation would seem to be the most 
constructive, balanced, and specific of the election material. 
It does not summon to the "far blue yonder" but offers a 
resolution of socioeconomic problems at the oblast level. And 
this, I believe, was appreciated by the electorate of Berdsk, 
which cast its votes for the communists. 
  Social psychologists say that a candidate who organizes his 
campaign not on real, constructive matters but on withering 
criticism of his opponents fails, as a rule. This was evident to 
some extent. One likable party candidate from Tsentralnyy Rayon 
so fulminated in his election speeches against the communists as 
to introduce into his vocabulary the terms "communist Vendee," 
"red faces," and so forth. In a word, the voter knew where 
everything stood with this politician. And rejected him. 
  One further campaign method: the flashed-message effect. As 
many people believe, in November V. Zhirinovskiy's multiple 
television meetings made him not only a star of the screen but 
of the electorate also. The method was employed actively by 
local candidates also. The pithy phrase broadcast daily on the 
radio: "Konstantin Zheleznov is a man of action! He is your 
candidate!" is still implanted in the minds of many 
Novosibirskers. The politician candidates did not dare take such 
a step. In order to be, if not elected, at least, known. 
  Granting SOVETSKAYA SIBIR an interview, Kirill Volobuyev, 
leader of the local Liberal Democrats, complained at the 
discrimination in relation to political parties: We were forced 
to collect signatures for the candidates. 
  "People should be nominated for the oblast soviet by party, 
by slate!" 
  As it transpired, the party could today barely "cover" 
several electoral districts with its candidates. None was 
elected to the oblast soviet. From the viewpoint of party 
representation and the apportionment of political forces this is 
not, as they say, to the benefit of democracy. But how can the 
electorate's interests be represented in the soviet if it is as 
yet denying this representation?

<F P=106> [Article by Liana Minasyan: "Elections Which Were Threatened </F>
Were Held After All; 28,000 Georgians Elected 5 Deputies, While 
35,500 Ossetians Elected 36"] 
  [Text] Last Sunday's elections to the state nykhas, the 
supreme organ of South Ossetia, were perceived with enthusiasm 
by the population. By noontime, half of the voters had already 
voted, and the primary result was achieved. By the time the 
polls closed, 80 percent of the voters had visited them. 
  According to the official information supplied by 
Tsentrizbirkom [Central Electoral Committee] Chairman Boris 
Chochiyev, 41 electoral districts had been created. However, 
elections were held in only 36 of them, with the rest falling in 
Georgian villages. The question posed by one of the members of 
the CSCE [Council for Security and Cooperation in Europe] 
mission who was in Tskhinvali at the time of the elections--why 
were 28,000 members of the Georgian population given only 5 
seats in parliament, while 35,500 Ossetian voters got to elect 
36 deputies--remained unanswered. Thus, unlike the parliament of 
Abkhaziya, which had been exploded by the quota principle of 
representation, the elections to the South Ossetian nykhas 
demonstrated once again that Tskhinvali ignores Tbilisi, and the 
local Georgian population ignores the local Tskhinvali 
authorities. 
  Nevertheless, many, including the commander of the Russian 
peacekeeping forces in South Ossetia, Nikolay Pavlov, even the 
day before the elections had serious doubts that the elections 
would take place without any excesses. Three days earlier, a 
hostage was taken in the Georgian village of Nuli, and a group 
demanded a ransom of 50 million rubles (R) for him. Certain 
circumstances surrounding this incident force us to believe that 
this was not an ordinary criminal action. After a thorough 
investigation, official Tskhinvali authorities never were able 
to determine who took the hostage. The R50 million were 
prepared. However, the members of the CSCE mission, together 
with the Russian peacekeepers, never did meet the middleman for 
transfer of the money. 
  Meanwhile, the Georgians responded to this by seizing eight 
people (the six women and two children were freed after 
negotiations). The Georgian population blocked the roads in all 
directions leading to Tskhinvali. The peacekeepers were 
seriously concerned that if the situation could not be diffused, 
there would be a chain reaction of mutual violence. 
  The incident really did give reason for mutual suspicions. 
The Tskhinvali authorities accused the Georgian authorities of 
wanting to undermine the elections. The commander of the 
Georgian battalion of peacekeeping forces, Nodar Tatarishvili, 
expressed the supposition that this was the work of Ossetian 
radicals who had decided to heat up anti-Georgian sentiments 
before the election. 
  However, be that as it may, no hostages have been taken here 
for over a year now. Moreover, the sum of the ransom, contrary 
to accepted practice, was extremely high (usually they demand 
from R1 to R3 million, depending on the "status" of the 
hostage). And although General Pavlov was full of decisiveness 
to oppose the bandits, the situation has not yet been fully 
resolved. 
  Nevertheless, the elections were held, even though they had 
an entertaining topic: There were 151 candidates running for 36 
seats. A large part of the candidates were party nominees--12 
parties, associations and unions entered into the struggle, and 
the most active among them was the Communist Party. The 
opposition became concerned when it discovered that many 
independent deputies, who in the former Supreme Soviet did not 
comprise the majority, turned out to be unable to withstand the 
promises to "bring back" the Soviet Union. Also playing a role 
was the fact that the leaders of the former Supreme Soviet, 
Torez Kulumbekov and Alan Chochiyev, had long ago left South 
Ossetia. This overshadowed the farewell with the former Supreme 
Soviet and had an effect on the reputation of the remaining 
deputies. And although the current chairman of the Supreme 
Soviet, Lyudvig Chibirov, believes that "the line of the former 
parliament will not be subject to revision, despite the fact 
that, according to the estimates, the make-up of the deputies 
will change by 60 percent," many believe that not only will the 
state nykhas be more "moderate," including in regard to Georgia, 
but that it will be simply an unprofessional and pliable organ. 
The absence of any active policy and self-sufficient organ of 
administration has already brought South Ossetia to the brink of 
catastrophe. Chairman Chibirov himself has not yet been elected 
to the new parliament but, like most of the deputies running in 
the city districts, has remained for the second round. His 
rival, the minister of foreign relations of South Ossetia, 
represents the Republic Party for People's Unity of Ossetia--a 
party representing the higher segment of power structures. 
  The members of the CSCE mission, who are trying to renew 
contacts between Tskhinvali and Tbilisi, believe that Chibirov 
is a perceptive man. However, sensing the acuteness of the 
moment, he himself is in no hurry publicly to break down the 
"wall of China" which, in his words, has arisen between Georgia 
and Ossetia over the last five years. Chibirov announced that 
"if the parliament of Georgia has repealed the Supreme Soviet of 
Abkhazia, we too will not escape this same verdict. But this is 
of no consequence for us. South Ossetia has its own 
constitution, on the basis of which we held the elections, 
placing a legal foundation under our republic."

<F P=106> [Article by Irina Vladykina: "One Hundred Sixty Candidates </F>
for the Sverdlovsk Oblast Duma Named--Election Campaign Begins 
in the Local Mass Media"] 
  [Text] One hundred sixty candidates for deputy to the 
Sverdlovsk Oblast Duma have obtained their credentials. In the 
oblast administration, where a meeting took place between 
candidates for deputy and head of administration Aleksey 
Strakhov and members of the government, it was learned that of 
32 public associations declaring their intention to begin the 
election campaign, six have dropped out. 
  Some 227 candidates submitted applications during the course 
of the preelection period, indicating the high activity level of 
social and political forces in Sverdlovsk Oblast. According to 
preliminary estimates of the oblast electoral commission, oblast 
residents will receive a ballot 10 April containing the names of 
at least 30 candidates for deputy to the oblast Duma. A great 
deal of attention is therefore devoted to the interaction 
between candidates and the mass media. Lots were drawn on 
Sverdlovsk television, where candidates were afforded free air 
time for their presentations, and also in OBLASTNAYA GAZETA, the 
official organ of the Sverdlovsk Oblast administration, where 
space will be allocated for the publication of free campaign 
materials. Candidates are being afforded the full use of seven 
issues of this publication, beginning 25 March. 
  Among the registered candidates for deputy to the oblast 
Duma 
are 44 businessmen, 33 political figures nominated by parties, 
five trade union functionaries, four workers, and four 
unemployed individuals. The work of nominating and registering 
candidates is not complete. The oblast electoral commission is 
presently investigating complaints and petitions, of which quite 
a number have been received.

<F P=106> [Article by Oleg Tatarchenkov under the "Election Passions" </F>
rubric: "Circular Track Races"] 
  [Text] In Yaroslav Oblast, the "successful seizure of 
representative power by the executive has taken place." Such was 
the characterization given the elections to the oblast Duma and 
the city municipal committees by V. Varukhin, representative of 
the president of the Russian Federation in the oblast. And in 
fact, of the 17 elected deputies in the oblast, six are heads of 
city administration, and another three are bureaucrats. However, 
this victory can be counted a Pyrrhic one. Only 33 percent of 
the oblast residents who had the right to vote participated in 
the elections. In most of the districts, the elections were 
declared invalid by the oblast electoral commission. That is to 
the oblast Duma. Things are not any better with the municipal 
committees: In two of the oblast's large cities--in Rybinsk and 
Rostov--elections did not take place at all, and in Yaroslavl, 
only partially. 
  The main reason for this "victory" is the absolute 
apoliticism of the voters. And the people of Yaroslavl, in turn, 
reserve the right to mock the points of the candidates' election 
platforms and the means of their presentation. Thus, one of the 
directors of a Yaroslavl enterprise permitted vodka to be sold 
on the territory of the plant during the election campaign. The 
vodka was wrapped in a sheet with the director's election 
program on it. Another candidate, when presenting his program on 
local television, was asked how he planned to implement it; he 
replied: "I know some sly tricks that will help me out." The 
contender preferred not to go into the details of what these 
"tricks" might be. A third, in order to get the youth vote, 
promised to organize "sex buses," where young men and women 
could meet without the danger of being caught by their parents. 
Against the background of these "sly tricks" and "sex buses," 
bureaucrats and directors of major enterprises looked quite a 
bit more attractive: They really could do something more 
serious. True, most of them did not believe that this "something 
more serious" would make their life easier, and they "voted with 
their feet," virtually ignoring the elections. 
  In the districts where all of the contenders were rejected, 
runoff elections will be held on 24 April. And the oblast 
electoral commission set a condition: All candidates, the new 
and the previous ones, must again collect the necessary number 
of signatures. So this is the second track, which is in danger 
of turning into an exclusive one.

<F P=106> [Interview with Yaroslavl Oblast Governor Anatoliy Lisitsyn </F>
by KOMSOMOLSKAYA PRAVDA correspondent Dmitriy Sevryukov; place 
and date not given: "The Province Is Moving... Where?"] 
  [Text] Residents of Yaroslavl, Rybinsk, or Uglich say with 
a certain pride that they no longer live in an oblast but in a 
province, although official confirmation of the title of the 
region is being delayed, as usual. This upsets Yaroslavl 
residents because the seemingly innocent word "oblast" reminds 
them of the oblast party committee and its permanent First 
[secretary], nicknamed by the populace "tsar Fedor." The current 
Yaroslavl leader, however--Governor Lisitsyn--is respectfully 
called Anatoliy Ivanovich even in the most remote kolkhoz. 
During the December elections to the Federation Council, voters 
in the province not only cast the absolute majority of votes for 
the governor but also, unlike other Russian regions, did not 
fall for the temptation to play into the hands of Zhirinovskiy's 
party. 
  [Sevryukov] Anatoliy Ivanovich, are you not afraid that 
authoritative figures on a local level, given the weakening of 
the center, will wittingly or unwittingly contribute to Russia's 
repeating the fate of the Union: disintegration into individual 
principalities, rural districts, provinces... 
  [Lisitsyn] I am against the "parade of sovereignties" 
started 
by my colleagues from Sverdlovsk Oblast. And when he proposed 
himself for the post of speaker of the Federation Council, I 
spoke sharply against it. In the current explosive political 
situation it is enough to set a precedent, and a chain reaction 
will start... To allow fragmentation of the Russian state--in no 
matter what form--means to nullify history. 
  [Sevryukov] The economic crisis in each region has its own 
local flavor. Everybody in Yaroslavl remembers the February 
rebellion of "red directors," who were threatening an 
interregional strike... 
  [Lisitsyn] It did not reach this point. And the "rebellion" 
had been provoked to a large extent not by industrialists but 
trade unions, who constantly destabilize the situation. We were 
able to reach an agreement, though, and identified the 
principles and positions on which we must immediately support 
enterprises: reduce road tax and property tax. 
  We also defined a long-term economic development policy. On 
this we worked together with Ye. Gaydar's institute. We prepared 
37 promising programs, some of which may qualify both for 
federal investment and investment on the part of international 
mortgage banks. We plan to present this unique Yaroslavl-Gaydar 
program to a broad circle of businessmen and economists in 
Moscow from 24 to 28 May, during the Yaroslavl Oblast week in 
the capital. 
  I recently visited Nemtsov in Nizhniy Novgorod. We compared 
our provinces' indicators of agricultural production and 
discovered that Yaroslavl Oblast has experienced a smaller 
decline in the livestock herd and has a higher milk yield and 
higher average wages. As to agriculture specifically, the entire 
secret is that since 1992 we have been directing half of our 
budget money into that sphere. 
  [Sevryukov] Anatoliy Ivanovich, in a recent interview to 
KOMSOMOLSKAYA PRAVDA Sergey Shakhray remarked that what is 
happening in society today is a battle between three elites: 
Moscow, regional, and sectoral. Do you agree with such a formula? 
  [Lisitsyn] This fight is not only perceptible--it is coming 
to the forefront of domestic political life. If you take federal 
organs of administration and local organs, the problem is that 
the experience accumulated in the regions is being ignored by 
our government. The government is attempting to implement on his 
own a mechanism of economic reform without analyzing regional 
experience. All attempts from the grass roots level to have our 
experience finally put to use have been fruitless. I am 
particularly bitter about this, since I am a member of the board 
of the Governors Union, whose task is to propagate the regions' 
experience. 
  [Sevryukov] Yaroslavl Oblast was among the first to hold 
elections to the oblast duma and local organs of representative 
power. There have been accusations, however, that the elections 
were undemocratic, since heads of administrations participated 
in them, which violates the principle of separation of power... 
  [Lisitsyn] First, I have to tell you that these elections 
were held in an extremely difficult political situation. 
Strictly speaking, there were attempts to derail them. And the 
key opposition figure, sad to say, was the president's 
representative in Yaroslavl Oblast. When the election campaign 
was already in full swing, and after we had already spent about 
2 billion rubles on it, he suddenly proposed to move the 
elections to the fall. And later urged the population not to 
turn out for elections altogether, not to vote. 
  Nevertheless, the oblast duma has been elected and is now 
functioning. It is a group of competent people, professionals. 
And the fact that almost half the duma deputies are members of 
the executive branch does not indicate in any way that the 
elections were undemocratic. 
  [Sevryukov] You have been governor for two and a half years 
now. Has the pilgrimage to power given you the sense of 
satisfaction over what has been accomplished? 
  [Lisitsyn] Complete satisfaction--no. Especially now with 
the 
departure--again--of Gaydar, whose economic concept was the 
foundation of our region's development. 
  A point of legitimate pride for the governor's team is 
probably the stability of the socioeconomic situation and secure 
civil peace. I think that to a large extent credit for this goes 
to the Civic Consensus Union, created under the governor two 
years ago; it includes representatives of all--without 
exception--parties and movements. Each month they all gather 
together--essentially, political opponents: Russia's Choice, the 
communists, the national-patriots... With all our disagreements, 
we have learned to come to agreement, because it is in the 
interests of the people.

<F P=106> [Interview with M.Sh. Shaymiyev, president of the Republic </F>
of Tatarstan, by Aleksandr Sabov, LITERATURNAYA GAZETA special 
correspondent, Kazan-Moscow; date not given: "Did the Treaty 
Reconcile the Two Constitutions?] 
  [Text] 
  [Begin boxed item] We will remind the reader of the stages 
of 
the three-year discussion between Russia and Tatarstan. 
  1990, August. Declaration of the Supreme Soviet of Tatarstan 
on the state sovereignty of the republic was enunciated. It was 
Tatarstan that opened the "parade of sovereignties" in Russia. 
  1992, March. Referendum: Mass support of the sovereignty of 
the republic; moreover, not only by the Tatar but also by the 
Russian-speaking population. 
  1992, November. On the basis of the results of the 
referendum, a new constitution of the republic was adopted 
proclaiming it a "sovereign state and a subject of international 
law associated with the Russian Federation." 
  1993, December. As a result of the massive failure of voters 
to participate, the elections in Tatarstan to the Federal 
Assembly of Russia, in essence, were not held. The position of 
the republic: New elections will be conducted only after the 
signing of a special treaty between the Republic of Tatarstan 
and the Russian Federation. 
  1994, 15 February. The leaders of the Russian Federation and 
the Republic of Tatarstan signed the treaty "On the Demarcation 
of Powers and Subjects of Jurisdiction between the Organs of 
State Authority of the Russian Federation and the Republic of 
Tatarstan." 
  1994, 13 March. Repeat elections were held with a rather 
high 
activeness of the population. Tatarstan took two seats on the 
Federation Council and all five seats in the State Duma of 
Russia. 
  [end boxed item] 
  [Sabov] In my opinion, here, in Tatarstan, after three years 
of peripeteia, which Russia followed with anxiety, a certain 
very important precedent was set for regulating relations 
between the Federation and its components. In the treaty between 
the Russian Federation and the Republic of Tatarstan, unlike 
your constitution, the words on Tatarstan as "a sovereign state" 
and "a subject of international law" are excluded, and the 
concept of a Tatarstan that is "associated" is replaced by the 
concept of a Tatarstan that is "united" with Russia. Tell me, 
Mintimer Sharipovich, what do you see as the advantage of 
joining the Federation in this way. Why did you not agree, like 
Bashkortostan or Yakutia (Sakha), to sign the Federative Treaty 
with the special supplements to it? 
  [Shaymiyev] Well, first, you are right in saying that our 
relations with Russia remained uncertain for a long time, more 
than three years. Not only were those who watched from the side 
anxious, but there was also anxiety here among the residents of 
the republic. It was intensified by the feeling of general 
instability in Russia which, after the collapse of the Union, is 
itself experiencing a time of troubles in its own history. We 
were accused of separatism and violation of the integrity of 
Russia. The so-called "central" mass media printed many articles 
that were not objective, frequently confusing the demands of the 
radical nationalistic movements of Tatarstan with the positions 
of the official leadership of the republic. But, after all, they 
never coincided. For example, as president, despite all the 
pressure brought to bear on me, not once in any form did I 
demand "independence" for Tatarstan. Overall, I always remained 
calm, knowing that sooner or later Russia would understand and 
appreciate our position. 
  It was three years ago, while adopting the Declaration on 
the 
Sovereignty of Tatarstan--imagine, this was in the time of the 
Union, when hopes still existed for the success of the 
Novo-Ogarevo process!--that we declared that as soon as we build 
a rule-of-law society, relations between the republic and the 
Federation should be built on a treaty basis and mutual 
delegation of powers. At the time of the conduct of the 
referendum on the official status of the republic, our Supreme 
Soviet once again made a distinct clarification: Tatarstan is 
not for violation of the integrity of the Russian Federation, 
but is seeking a path of reasonable coordination of its 
interests with all-Russian interests. 
  After the signing of the treaty on 15 February, I tirelessly 
emphasized the principles of our joining the Federation in my 
preelection campaign: a treaty basis, demarcation and delegation 
of powers, and no violation of Russia's integrity. Our position 
was consistent, because we defended the mutual conditionality of 
these three principles from the very beginning. 
  [Sabov] Nevertheless, in the final stage, the matter ended 
in 
a compromise for you as well? After all, a number of provisions 
of your constitution do not coincide with the provisions of the 
treaty. 
  [Shaymiyev] Well, what can be done without a compromise? As 
president, I cannot violate the Constitution of Tatarstan, under 
which we are now living for the second year. Yes. The 
constitution and the treaty differ in many articles. But we came 
to an agreement in principle with B.N. Yeltsin--and this is 
reflected in the treaty itself--that it, the treaty, prevails 
over both constitutions--of the Republic of Tatarstan and of the 
Russian Federation. If you wish, this is a document of the 
coordination of two constitutions: Where they do not coincide, 
both sides are guided by the provisions of the treaty. So, this 
is a mutual compromise. Therefore, Russia itself does not raise 
the fact that Tatarstan, say, must amend its Basic Law, just as 
we in turn proceed from the fact that within the scope of 
delegated powers Tatarstan can get along with the Russian 
Constitution. But if we took the path or were forced to take the 
path of revising the provisions of our constitution, then we 
simply could not arrive at an agreement. 
  I must say frankly: The new Russian Constitution is 
basically 
decorative-federative. Even a majority of Russian political 
scientists talk about this openly, and those who do not say it, 
confirm it with their silence. In fact, this is the constitution 
of a unitary state and, therefore, we did not agree to recognize 
its action on our territory. But it has been adopted and has 
become a reality. So the signing of the treaty, which has been 
ascribed predominant meaning, is a fact of enormous political 
significance for Russia as well: After this it in fact stops 
being a unitary state. 
  [Sabov] But, after all, according to your logic, this is no 
more than an exception: Tatarstan is only one of the 21 
republics in the system of the Russian Federation... 
  [Shaymiyev] In this case, it is the first step toward the 
renewal of the democratic Federation of Russia. By the fact of 
signing the treaty, it stopped being a unitary state not only 
with respect to Tatarstan but, no less important, also with 
respect to itself. 
  [Sabov] But with respect to other regions? 
  [Shaymiyev] It is still unitary. But so that an empire of 
lesser dimensions did not arise in place of the USSR, a 
precedent was important for this: to disrupt the unitary 
thinking that was already elevated to the constitutional level. 
Incidentally, a long ago time we proposed at the Council of 
Heads of Republics: Let us voluntarily unite and create a strong 
federation. This would remove the tension and suspicion in the 
relations of Russia with its previous autonomies that took on 
the status of republics. But the fear intruded: What if after 
the collapse of the Union the very same fate befell Russia as 
well... As soon as we did not succeed in starting the collective 
treaty process, we had no choice left: We came to an agreement 
with Russia by ourselves. 
  [Sabov] Well, fine, the treaty prevails over the two 
constitutions... But out of 21 republics, it seems, seven have 
declared the supremacy of their own laws over all-Russian laws. 
Is this really not a path toward disintegration? 
  [Shaymiyev] Yes. But this danger can be avoided, if the 
republics conclude treaties with the Federation. For example, in 
our case the concept of the supremacy of laws was transformed 
entirely. In those powers that we delegated to the exclusive or 
joint jurisdiction of the Federation, the supremacy of the 
Russian Constitution is unconditionally recognized. But where 
the treaty grants exclusive powers to Tatarstan, the principle 
of the supremacy of its Basic Law is just as firm. 
  If the Federative Treaty became a part of the federal 
constitution, which the regions tried to achieve at one time, 
then possibly the powers could be more or less accurately 
demarcated and delegated--from the localities to the center, and 
vice versa. Incidentally, the first draft of the constitution 
was drawn up in precisely this spirit. But then it was thrown 
out! But the Federative Treaty simply was not included in the 
new, final text of the constitution, which made it a document of 
an unclear juridical nature. Its weakness is that it does not 
provide a mechanism for the implementation of powers. In 
contrast to our treaty, which we accompanied with 12 
agreements--on questions of defense, ecology, higher education, 
etc. We now know precisely which questions are "ours" and which 
are "not ours." 
  [Sabov] To end the subject of the Federation: How do you see 
the problem of krays and oblasts in Russia joining it? 
  [Shaymiyev] I think that the signing of the Federative 
Treaty 
with krays and oblasts was a mistake in principle. Russia itself 
should have come out as one state, as a component of the 
Federation that united all of its administrative entities. The 
priority then is something else entirely: the economic equality 
of the republics, on the one hand, and of the krays and oblasts 
on the other. 
  [Sabov] It is written in your treaty with Russia: Tatarstan 
is sovereign on the question of establishing its own state 
institutions and structures of authority. But, in contrast to a 
majority of the regions of Russia, you have not yet removed the 
so-called soviet authority. 
  [Shaymiyev] The entire path we have traveled in three years: 
the Declaration on State Sovereignty, the constitution, and the 
program of economic reform in the republic--all this was done 
with the very close participation of the Supreme Soviet, which 
was elected at the time under a one-party system. As the head of 
the executive authority, I can say that we did not have any 
confrontation with the legislative authority, and there is none. 
Of course, problems arose, but they were resolved with the 
assistance of conciliatory commissions, or the deputies 
themselves demanded the intervention of the president. 
  [Sabov] But, after all, life has changed! New parties have 
emerged, and they are demanding their own place in political 
life... 
  [Shaymiyev] True. However, should this be done by means of 
the dispersal of the old organs of representative authority, and 
is it not better to prepare a planned and painless transition to 
a multiparty political system? We are preparing for such 
elections. For this, it is necessary first of all to adopt a new 
election law. Three variants of it have already been proposed, 
but not one has passed yet. All that remains is to come to an 
agreement on the principles of this reform. 
  [Sabov] And when does the term of power of the Supreme 
Soviet 
expire? 
  [Shaymiyev] In March next year. Thus, we still have almost a 
year to go. We will hold new elections at the end of 1994 or 
beginning of 1995. On a multiparty basis, of course. 
  [Sabov] In this connection, Mintimer Sharipovich, a question 
about the opposition: Alas, it is reprints from its articles in 
the Russian press that have so damaged Tatarstan's reputation in 
public opinion. What today is the real weight of the 
national-radical opposition in the republic, and will it in the 
future be able to become a destabilizing factor in relations 
between Tatarstan and Russia? 
  [Shaymiyev] We have more than one opposition. There are two: 
the Tatar national-radicals, and, as they call themselves, the 
"Russian Federalists." Both of them stand on extreme positions. 
From the very beginning, the Federalists were up in arms against 
our sovereignty: We do not need any kind of "Tatarstan state," 
and it is not necessary to renew the Federation. That is, in 
fact, they are for a unitary Russia. The national-radicals are 
at the other extreme: the complete independence of Tatarstan, no 
kind of federation with Russia, Russia is simply "a neighboring 
state." They met the fact of the signing of the treaty with 
hostility: They declared a boycott of the elections, they began 
to collect signatures for the recall of the president as a 
"traitor of Tatarstan," etc. But here is what is indicative: 
Today, at the expiration of three years of political 
transformations in Tatarstan, there is less public support for 
them than there was at the beginning! Their extremist slogans 
lost their attraction. Pardon me if I refer to myself without 
false modesty: On 13 March in the elections to the Federation 
Council of Russia I received 204,000 more votes than I did three 
years ago, when I was elected president of Tatarstan. 
  The centrist niche is occupied--it is occupied by the policy 
of the president and other official organs of the republic. This 
makes it that much more difficult for extremists from one or 
another kray to position themselves. Shaymiyev or no Shaymiyev, 
it is not a matter of personalities: Only a person with firm 
centrist positions can be the president of Tatarstan. 
  [Sabov] By virtue of the multiethnic composition of the 
population? 
  [Shaymiyev] Unquestionably. After all, our Tatar and Russian 
population is practically half-and-half, and each third family 
is mixed. 
  [Sabov] Nevertheless, the opposition is raising the question 
of the establishment of a monoethnic Tatarstan? 
  [Shaymiyev] It used to. But it has already dropped this 
slogan. Tatarstan's self-isolation, against the background of 
difficulties, most of all in the economy, would add new 
incredible difficulties for us. Why complicate people's life? 
For the sake of someone's political ambitions? Permit me to 
express in confidence: The example of the treaty that was 
concluded by Tatarstan and Russia will also find an echo beyond 
the borders of our Federation. You will recall that Gamsakhurdia 
came to power after receiving almost 99 percent of the votes. It 
seemed: How easy it is to resolve questions in a mononational 
state! However, it is easy to get ill with nationalism, but it 
is far more difficult to recover from it, as we see from the 
example of Georgia and Moldova. To work in a multinational 
environment is more difficult, but during the years of my 
presidency I have understood that multinationalism is a great 
blessing. And you begin to especially appreciate this blessing 
in such difficult times as ours, when the very social 
foundations are changing. It is not accidental that the concept 
of the "people of Tatarstan" is present in our constitution, and 
not the "nation of Tatarstan." And two state languages. After 
all, why did such discord occur in Moldova? Because of the 
temptation to impose one state language on a multinational 
population. 
  [Sabov] Is the Russian-speaking population of Tatarstan 
excepted from the difficulties it is experiencing in the former 
republics of Central Asia, the Caucasus, and the aforementioned 
Moldova? 
  [Shaymiyev] A question for your question: Have you seen 
refugees from Tatarstan anywhere in Russia or in the CIS 
countries? On the other hand, more and more are coming to us. Of 
course, 75 percent of them are Tatars who have left their place 
of residence, but the rest are basically Russian. Nevertheless, 
even here a certain tension has been felt in the relations of 
the two communities. This came both from the intrigues of 
radicals and from the continuous displays on television of the 
hot spots in the CIS... Therefore, even on the purely human 
plane, the fact of the signing of the treaty with Russia is very 
important: It finally dispelled the anxiety of Russians over 
their position in Tatarstan. 
  [Sabov] My fellow-traveler on a train, a young doctor, a 
Tatar, admitted: "The establishment of the Tatar language as the 
only official language would be a tragedy for me." Here is an 
absolutely unexpected aspect of the problem: Tatar youth and a 
Tatar intelligentsia who are not fluent in their own language! 
  [Shaymiyev] Yes, two languages are recognized here as 
official, but the Tatar language now needs help. After all, 
office work and training are conducted in Russian, not to 
mention the fact that everyone speaks Russian. It was a pleasant 
surprise for me to learn that many Russian families sent their 
children to groups we opened up for the study of the Tatar 
language. 
  [Sabov] Is it true, as was written by Russian newspapers, 
that demands were heard at the World Congress of Tatars for the 
creation of a national parliament (a little majlis) as a kind of 
parallel government of a "Great Tatarstan?" 
  [Shaymiyev] This did not happen! We viewed the World 
Congress 
of Tatars from the very beginning as a measure that was not 
political but strictly cultural. There are about 7 million 
Tatars in the CIS countries, and less than 2 million in 
Tatarstan. There are large Tatar communities in the United 
States, Australia, Finland... Like every dispersed people, we 
are also endeavoring to "find" each other, so that we may 
preserve our culture, language, and ethnos together. Even the 
opposition in the course of this congress did not dare to put 
forth the idea of a "World Government of Tatars." I especially 
thanked the Russian population, the Russian part of our people, 
for the fact that I did not see even a shadow of dissatisfaction 
on their faces when we conducted this congress here in 
Tatarstan. After all, there could have been a different 
reaction: They assembled Tatars, it is said, from the whole 
world, expect oppression... But when the authorities do not play 
to the gallery and do not tell lies, then the people understand 
everything. Of course, here in Kazan the opposition created its 
own little majlis. But this is an illegitimate organ, not 
elected by anyone, and according to its own official 
registration it is an ordinary public organization. Moreover, 
believe me, with insignificant influence. 
  [Sabov] But what as a result does the treaty promise in 
Tatarstan's economic plan which, incidentally, is constantly 
called a debtor of the central budget? Have you rejected your 
tax obligations to the Federation? 
  [Shaymiyev] Well, no, everything is being done in a 
different 
way. Henceforth, we will collect republic taxes ourselves, and 
we will submit that share to the federal budget that is 
necessary for the implementation of powers transferred there. Or 
for the conduct of joint federal programs; for example, the 
building of a bridge across the Kama. After all, the 
transportation of all Russia will move across this bridge, not 
only ours. 
  You asked about our new economic advantages. Here is an 
example. Russia is now tormented with nonpayments. Everyone 
says: It is necessary to establish a system of bill of exchange 
settlements immediately. They say this, but do not do it! As a 
result, thousands of enterprises in Russia have stopped work. Of 
course, nonpayments are hitting the economy of Tatarstan hard 
also, when it is a matter of foreign accounts. But we have 
resolved this problem inside the republic: We have a bill of 
exchange in circulation whose guarantor is the government. Here 
is a specific advantage of the economic independence of the 
republic. 
  Another example: specifically directed social protection of 
the poor. A summary is laid on my desk every day on the 
correlation of minimum expenditures and incomes of the 
population. For example, according to the status on 1 February, 
the subsistence minimum in Tatarstan was 29,000 rubles [R]. But 
the minimum level of wages for Russia was R14,700. As a result, 
almost a third of the population of the country ended up below 
the poverty line. But is this really fair--to pay people half of 
the subsistence minimum? The Supreme Soviet of Tatarstan 
increased the minimum income per person to R30,000, which is the 
law for our commodity producers. As a result, I make so bold as 
to hope that not one person in Tatarstan is living below the 
poverty line. 
  Go into a store: Products are cheaper here than in Russia. 
We 
have not dissolved our kolkhozes, as an edict of the Russian 
president at one time demanded of us. We did not cut the number 
of cattle. For the second year we have an increase in the 
production of agricultural products. We stopped, as before, 
saluting the federal authorities. We resolve questions that, 
according to the treaty, remained in our jurisdiction in a way 
that we find reasonable under our conditions. This does not 
mean, for example, that we are for the perpetuation of 
kolkhozes. We prefer another policy: That is, kolkhozes should 
help put farmers on their feet. 
  Or the question of the fight against crime. It has taken on 
such scope everywhere that it is no longer possible to fight it 
without emergency measures. And we have undertaken such 
measures. We passed a resolution to detain suspects not for 
three days, as is allowed by federal legislation, but for 30 
days. The solving of crimes has increased sharply. I can tell 
you that they are now coming here from Moscow "to study the 
experiment" in keeping crime in check...[end Shaymiyev] 
  While bidding farewell, M.Sh, Shaymiyev said: 
  "But you know, I have a guest tomorrow: President of Crimea 
Yuriy Meshkov is flying in." 
  The purpose of the visit, it seems, is clear. Is there not a 
need there also, in Ukraine, for a breach in the wall that 
divides the "center" and the "outlying districts?"
