<F P=106> [Article by Tatyana Korneyeva under the rubric "Situation": </F>
"Building a House Is Not a Big Deal--or Is It?"] 
  [Text] Many participants in a republic-wide 
conference of builders, which was held last Friday by Tatarstan 
Republic Prime Minister M. Sabirov, termed the current condition 
of the construction complex of the republic critical. 
<H5>  Awash in Debt </H5>
  In 1933, only seven facilities were commissioned out of the 
30 that had been slated to be commissioned. The capacity that 
would have made it possible to increase the output of foodstuffs 
and construction materials failed to be commissioned; we did not 
succeed in increasing the commissioning of residential buildings 
and facilities for social, cultural, and consumer services, 
despite increasing the proportion of funds invested in that 
sphere. 
  Last year, buildings with an area of 1.275 million square 
meters were built, which comes to 88 percent of the 1992 level. 
  The main failures in the commissioning of housing occurred 
in 
Naberezhnye Chelny. Out of 148,000 square meters promised by the 
mayoralty of Naberezhnye Chelny, the city checked in with only 
32,400 meters. A projection of the KamAZ Joint-Stock Company did 
not come true. The main customer for housing in the city failed 
to commission a single square meter. The problem in Naberezhnye 
Chelny lies in a genuine energy crisis which has developed 
there. The shortfall in heat generation comes to 37 percent. 
This prevents not only the hooking up of new consumers of heat 
but even the normal operation of the existing housing stock. 
However, work at the complex of the central boiler plant, which 
is slated for commissioning, proceeds at a slow pace. 
  The output of the construction materials industry continues 
to decline. Last year, the decline came to 18.6 percent compared 
to 1992. Difficulties in the placement of products in 
conjunction with reductions in the volume of construction are 
one of the reasons. 
  Tatarstan Republic Prime Minister Mukhammat Sabirov, who 
made 
a report at the conference, referred to the high rate of 
inflation, a cutback in budget expenditures, and the striving of 
many managers in the construction complex to manage in the old 
way and maintain the strength of the work force through, among 
other things, "eating away" at the fixed assets as the causes 
responsible for the slump in investment activities. 
  The crisis of nonpayments by customers, which is growing 
worse, is a most serious problem. As of 1 January 1994, the 
indebtedness of customers came to R185.1 billion, out of which 
about one-half was defaulted debt. The rate of growth of 
nonpayments and the proportion of defaulted debt in construction 
were the highest in the national economy. 
  Just as in construction, the nonpayment crisis has become 
aggravated in the construction materials industry. As of the 
beginning of 1994, the indebtedness of buyers for goods, work, 
and services came to R19.2 billion, and the debt to 
suppliers--to R18.9 billion (of which the debt in default 
accounted for 45 percent). 
  In response to numerous questions from participants in the 
conference concerning prospects for the elimination of the debt, 
M. Sabirov promised to pay all debts of the Republic of 
Tatarstan Cabinet of Ministers UKS [Capital Construction 
Administration] by the beginning of April. However, he did not 
support the notion of introducing mutual-offset arrangements, 
citing the extreme technical difficulty and, correspondingly, 
ineffectiveness of this procedure. 
  The main task, said the speaker, is to modify the mechanism 
for attracting and using financial resources. In the current 
year, priority support will be granted to the sectors which must 
ensure the stabilization and steadiness of functioning of the 
economy of the republic. We must be prepared for the scope of 
financing out of budgetary funds to diminish. Investment out of 
the funds of enterprises will not increase, either. It has been 
proposed to use the funds of commercial banks and foreign 
investment in order to stabilize the volume of capital 
investment. 
<H5>  Are `Projects in Progress' Forever? </H5>
  M. Sabirov called the growth of "projects in progress" a 
heavy burden on the economy of the republic. As of the beginning 
of 1994, roughly R1.3 trillion in prices in effect were "tied 
up" in such facilities. The prime minister stressed that there 
is only one way out of this situation: to commission, whatever 
it takes, the facilities under construction at which work is 
highly advanced and whose operation can generate profits 
quickly. Some of the "projects in progress" can be sold to 
domestic and foreign entrepreneurs on a competitive basis. 
However, developers are not interested in such sales because the 
lion's share of proceeds frequently does not end up in their 
wallets but rather, for example, in the privatization fund of 
the republic. This was the case with the sale of a concert hall 
in 1993, when the administration of Kazan received only 30 
percent of the cost of the facility. 
  Enterprises and organizations are in no hurry to put up 
"projects in progress" for auctions because of, among other 
things, the rapidly growing prices of real estate. In turn, 
potential buyers are restrained because of the absence of 
property rights to the parcels of land under the facilities 
purchased. Apparently, it is necessary to develop and introduce 
a package of regulatory documents which will stimulate the 
commissioning of facilities, impede the growth of the volume of 
construction in progress, and invigorate the market for 
construction products. In conjunction with this, the proposal 
was aired at the conference to lay a tax on idle property at all 
facilities whose construction is in progress. 
  The State Property Committee of Tatarstan is now preparing a 
draft decree on measures to reduce the number of facilities at 
which construction is in progress. As was stated, the decree 
will envision devices to influence enterprises and their 
managers. 
  All of this may be commendable, but it is worthwhile to 
recall that in the USSR, they were fighting "projects in 
progress" in capital construction with all their might over the 
last 30-40 years; meanwhile, their volume increased year after 
year.... 
<H5>  Housing Policy </H5>
  The bold and quite controversial idea that it is precisely 
housing construction that can restore the health of the 
republic's economy as a whole within a short period of time was 
stated at the conference. To this end, a special-purpose 
program, "Housing," is being developed in the Republic of 
Tatarstan; single-family housing construction should become one 
of its main areas. 
  Well, those wishing to build their own housing are indeed 
numerous here. However, as M. Sabirov noted, given its current 
cost, the population of the republic is unable to build 
single-family dwellings without support from the state. Such 
support is envisioned; it will be expressed in the allocation 
and sale of parcels of land, easy loans (interest-free and 
low-interest), tax relief, and the introduction of mortgage 
financing. It is expected that a family of average affluence 
will be able to buy out housing built on credit, on the pledge 
of real estate, within 25-30 years. M. Sabirov stated that easy 
loans for those wishing to build housing will be issued very 
shortly. 
  However, it is important in principle that the right of 
low-income citizens to improve their housing conditions in 
keeping with waiting lists will continue to exist at the same 
time. The only question is with what funds such housing will be 
built and, correspondingly, to what extent. The introduction of 
preferences for investors is envisioned, in view of the fact 
that we cannot manage without attracting off-budget funds into 
housing construction. The preferences include the transfer of 
residential buildings to be remodeled to entrepreneurs on the 
terms of 100-percent financing, with the subsequent transfer to 
them of up to 30 percent of the total space as their property; 
the sale of dilapidated and unoccupied housing stock to 
entrepreneurs and the use of up to 30 percent of the space at 
their discretion; the construction of housing and allocation of 
parcels of land through tenders. 
  The "Housing Initiative" corporation which has been 
established in the republic is developing a program for 
attracting off-budget entities and mortgage investment systems 
to housing construction and to the upgrading of the dilapidated 
housing stock. The first Joint-Stock Mortgage Bank in the 
republic is already being created (founded by the Tatsotsbank, 
the "Housing Initiative" corporation, and the 
Kazzhilgrazhdanstroy PSO [Production and Construction 
Association]). This bank will extend long-term credit for the 
construction of civil and industrial facilities on the pledge of 
real estate. "Housing Initiative" proposes to build commercial 
housing, sell it at auctions, and reinvest the proceeds into new 
construction. 
  The switchover to low-rise buildings is one of the 
directions 
of the new housing policy. This will it make it possible to use 
cheaper local materials more extensively and to use less 
expensive small-size construction equipment. It is necessary to 
change the output mix of some facilities at prefabricated 
concrete plants and other industrial enterprises in the 
construction sector which are geared toward medium- and low-rise 
[as in the original] housing construction. 
  As a result, the tenor of the conference turned out to be 
approximately like this: Everything is bad, but we cannot just 
lay down and die. We must work and look for a way out. Well, the 
ability of builders to "take the blows" of fate is commonly 
known. It is a pity that with every passing year it is becoming 
increasingly difficult to answer what was once a humorous 
question: Is it a big deal to build a house?

<F P=106> [Article by Aleksandr Protsenko under the "Changing of the </F>
Cadres" rubric: "The Governors Have Dumped Their Curator"] 
  [Text] Having familiarized himself with Boris 
Yeltsin's edict on the reorganization of the territorial affairs 
department of the president's administration, the head of this 
department, Nikolay Medvedev, took to his hospital bed. That is, 
already the department's former head.... 
  The reorganization of the department had long been in the 
works, and that with the active leadership participation of 
Medvedev himself. However, at the last moment, an additional 
point appeared in the presidential edict approving the 
structural and compositional changes to be made, directing 
Sergey Filatov to engage in a search for a candidate to the post 
of UDT [territorial affairs department] head. Department 
officials were completely bewildered, for everyone knew that 
Medvedev was the protege of that same Filatov. 
  Nikolay Pavlovich appeared in the president's administration 
soon after the arrival there of Sergey Aleksandrovich, who even 
during his work in parliament had had his eye on the energetic 
and efficient chairman of the Soviet of Nationalities commission 
on national-state structure and inter-nation relations. Filatov 
was bothered neither by Medvedev's "classical" 
cosmopolitan-party past nor by the fact that Medvedev had never 
had the reputation of a "convinced Yeltsinite," but had in 
parliament begun with cooperation with the Communists for 
Democracy faction and had finished as a member of the Left 
Center--Cooperation faction. 
  Medvedev's promotion to the post of deputy head of the 
president's administration responsible for work with the 
territories was actively opposed by the leaders of Democratic 
Russia, who accused the promoted one of "insufficient 
democratism in his convictions" and of besmirching connections 
with the oppositionists. Nikolay Medvedev, for example, spoke 
out actively against the democratic Mordovian [Mordvinian] 
President Guslyannikov. Some even assert that Medvedev voted for 
the impeachment of Boris Yeltsin. 
  Nevertheless, the appointment of Nikolay Pavlovich took 
place--in spite of, or perhaps thanks to, his aloofness, as it 
were, from the "president's team": Such a person, evidently, 
would have an easier time finding a common language with the 
heads of local administrations, far from all of whom were 
"Yeltsin's people." 
  It soon became clear, however, that it was precisely with 
the 
regions that Medvedev could not find a common language. Almost 
from the very beginning of his work, complaints rained down from 
the localities on the administrative-command management style of 
the new deputy head of the presidential administration. 
Evidently, it was that same "cosmopolitan-party past" of 
Medvedev's, to which Filatov did not pay attention, that made 
itself felt. Nikolay Pavlovich often tried to build his 
relations with the governors of the krays and oblasts of Russia 
on a "departmental" or "directive" basis. Medvedev became 
particularly active during the days of the September-October 
opposition, sending out "to the localities" threatening 
directives that warned about the "personal responsibility" of 
people whose support was necessary to the president, but whom 
Medvedev almost set against Yeltsin with his harshness and 
peremptoriness. 
  Even less satisfied with Medvedev were the president's 
representatives in the republics, krays, and oblasts. In the 
words of several of them, the territorial affairs department 
tried in every way to turn the representatives of the president 
into "state informants," but at the slightest conflict with the 
governors refused the president's representatives support. 
  All of this, apparently, served as a reason for Nikolay 
Medvedev's current dismissal from the post that he held. 
Although this dismissal also has its own logic: People of a 
"command style" were in demand in the administration during the 
period of tight territorial management, whereas now in the 
relations with the governors' corps, a little more sugar and a 
little less vinegar is needed--the times are not the same. 
  A successor to Nikolay Medvedev has not yet been found. But 
apparat life in the president's administration is not standing 
still: According to the latest information, by directive of 
Sergey Filatov, a new section is being created within the 
territorial affairs department, as whose head has been appointed 
Doku Zavgayev--former first secretary of the Checheno-Ingushetia 
Oblast Party Committee of the CPSU, who was divested of power by 
Khasbulatov for his support of the August putsch. A cadre, as 
they say, of proven worth.

<F P=106> [Article by Nikolay Maryanin: "The Federal </F>
Counterintelligence Service Will Defend the Homeland of the 
Leader"] 
  [Text] The territorial organs of counterintelligence do not 
mean to copy the structure of the Federal Service, but will have 
their own tasks depending on the regional problems. 
  This was reported in the local press by General Major 
Vladimir Shilimov, who was appointed, by edict of the president, 
head of the FSK [Federal Counterintelligence Service] department 
dealing with Ulyanovsk Oblast. Among the facilities evoking the 
sustained interest of the Western special services, he named the 
atom reactor scientific research institute in Dimitrovgrad; the 
Ulyanovsk engineering plant, where antiaircraft and missile 
complexes superior to the best foreign analogues are produced; 
the joint-stock company Aviastar, with its Ruslans and Tu-204's; 
and also the 104th airborne division, which was redeployed in 
Ulyanovsk last year and which is subject to NATO inspection. The 
Ulyanovsk security officers are also concerned about the 
appearance at several classified military units of Western 
religious preachers. 
  The head of local counterintelligence cited interesting 
facts 
from the life of the department. For example, last year several 
Western firms undertook an attempt to compromise the Ruslan 
airplane on the international market, but these efforts were 
thwarted by the Ulyanovsk security officers. And the imeni 
Volodarskiy machine-building plant intended to deliver to 
Armenia a line for the production of live cartridges. This 
illegal deal was also averted by local counterintelligence 
officers.

<F P=106> [Interview with Andrei Vavilov, first deputy minister of </F>
finace of the Russian Federation, by MOSCOW NEWS analyst 
Lyudmila Telen: "Russia Reaches Understanding with Creditors"] 
  [Text] The questions put by MOSCOW NEWS analyst Lyudmila 
Telen are answered by Andrei Vavilov, first deputy minister of 
finance of the Russian Federation, who participated in the 
latest negotiations with the IMF and members of the Paris Club. 
  Not long ago most experts agreed with the sad forecast that 
with the resignation of Yegor Gaydar and Boris Fyodorov the 
hopes for a tough financial policy had collapsed for good. But 
quite unexpectedly the draft budget for 1994, submitted by the 
Finance Ministry and backed by the premier, refuted these 
forecasts. Moreover, after the visit of Michel Camdessus, the 
International Monetary Fund will most likely agree to provide 
Russia with the second part of the promised credits, and the 
Paris Club will refrain from tough sanctions. 
  [Telen] You have been in the post of deputy finaance 
minister 
for three years now and these are not your first talks with the 
IMF. But this time they were particularly complicated. It was 
unclear till the last moment whether the IMF would agree to 
grant the second part of credits or would refrain from it. Isn't 
our partners' hesitation connected, above all, with the 
resignation of Gaydar and Fyodorov from the government? 
  [Vavilov] I think that the main reason for the IMF's 
cautiousness lies in something else. The thing is that until now 
we have only promised to achieve certain economic goals -- a low 
inflation level, an acceptable budget deficit, and so on. But 
for a number of objective and subjective reasons not all the 
promises were fulfilled. Therefore, it became much more 
complicated to hold negotiations with the IMF representatives. 
Nevertheless, I am sure that the main credit -- credit of 
confidence -- we have not exhausted at all. This is evidenced by 
the fact that after the negotiations the IMF and the Paris Club 
have eased their positions. 
  [Telen] Isn't it because the Russian side managed to scare 
off the West with threats such as: If you don't give money, 
social unrest will break out in Russia and who knows what 
consequences that would hold for Europe. 
  [Vavilov] We tried to use other arguments -- purely 
economic. 
It was important to convince our partners that the Russian 
government intends to maintain a tough financial policy. This 
year we have chosen a fundamentally new form of cooperation with 
the representatives of the IMF. Before, we presented to them the 
draft budget,then they evaluated how closely it corresponded to 
the aims of financial stabilization and only after that 
suggested that we make corrections which they deemed necessary. 
The program coordinated with the IMF, never before corresponded 
to the approved budget. Now consultations with the IMF proceeded 
simultaneously with the work on the draft budget, and it became 
possible to avoid differences. 
  [Telen] How did the negotiations with the Paris Club 
proceed? 
  [Vavilov] First of all, it must be pointed out that a number 
of meetings with its representatives were of an unofficial 
(although decisive in many respects) character. Certain people 
expected a scandal to break out on our visit to Paris. It was 
believed that the stand of the Paris Club would prove to be 
irreconilable: no deferments, the closure of credit lines, 
tougher conditions on payments for 1994. But there was no 
scandal. On the contrary, an understanding was reached to the 
effect that the agreements for this year on the payment 
conditions would be brought as close as possible to last year's 
agreements. This will make it possible to considerably simplify 
and speed up the procedure of coordination. The four-month 
deferment remains in force, and the credit lines won't be 
blocked. And there were no particularly heated arguments. True, 
from the start we told our creditors the following: "We can 
fulfil our commitments on payments to the Paris Cloub, but the 
amount of these payments will be determined after the end of 
negotiations with the IMF. But if the IMF does not approve our 
proposals, we will nevertheless start carrying out our program 
of financial stabilization." 
  [Telen] If the Paris Club had not cooperated, would this 
have 
dealt a blow to the Russian economy? 
  [Vavilov] First of all, as to our reputation, we would look 
like debtors incapable of fulfilling their commitments. To count 
after this on an influx of investments in our economy would be 
impossible. 
  [Telen] From what you said it follows that Russia is not 
only 
capable of carrying out the tough financial policy, but also 
convinced the West of the firmness of its intentions. Who in the 
present government, in the absence of Boris Fyodorov, can say 
"No" to the sectoral lobbyists? 
  [Vavilov] The government and, in the first place, the prime 
minister. For the time being the cabinet of ministers has not 
yielded to the pressure of the agrarians and the military. It 
may be recalled that the draft budget has limited the deficit to 
62.4 trillion rubles, the expected inflation level by December 
is 7 percent. 
  [Telen] Did the Finance Ministry manage to reach an 
agreement 
with the Central Bank? 
  [Vavilov] I think it did. the time of political battles 
between the financiers has passed. Today the Central Bank 
insists on a rather tough policy. 
  [Telen] But, perhaps the IMF understates our parliament. As 
is known, the Duma is just going to discuss the budget. Are you 
sure that the credit and monetary policy, worked out by the 
Finance Ministry, won't be called into question? 
  [Vavilov] At any rate, many MPs have already expressed their 
opinion on the score. Chairman of the State Duma Ivan Rybkin, 
Chairman of the Budget Committee Mikhail Zadornov, Chairman of 
the Committee for Economic Reform Sergei Glazyev are convinced 
that the Duma won't agree to increase budget outlays. Buy Yegor 
Gaydar and Boris Fyodorov doubt it.

<F P=106> [Article by Academician Leonid Abalkin, director of the </F>
Institute of Economics of the Russian Academy of Sciences, under 
the rubric "Position": "Far-Fetched Dilemma: Solutions to 
Problems Are Found Outside of Its Framework"] 
  [Text] 
<H5>  The Trap </H5>
  The search for ways out of the most profound crisis in which 
our country has found itself is proceeding within the framework 
of a certain set of views, widespread notions, and stereotypes. 
At present, the following dilemma which has been offered to our 
society (and grasped by it) is the foremost among them: Either 
we support production and employment, unavoidably slipping into 
the quagmire of destructive hyperinflation, or rein in inflation 
at the price of a further decline in production, the emergence 
of mass unemployment, and impoverishment of the population. 
  Interminable and unproductive debate has begun about which 
is 
better and which is worse. Even respectable politicians, 
bankers, scientists, and journalists have fallen into this trap. 
This topic has turned out to be particularly attractive for 
amateurs since it allows them to engage in discussing the most 
complex socioeconomic problems on a kind of equal footing. 
  Actually, the dilemma mentioned is far-fetched. In this 
instance, references to the fact that this situation is 
described in many "standard" macroeconomics textbooks do not 
help. They do not help because an analysis of the mutual linkage 
between production, investment, and employment, on one hand, and 
the rate of inflation, on the other hand, which is outlined in 
these textbooks always amounts to an utterly theoretical pattern 
or abstract model. The conclusions drawn in the process have 
value only within the framework of rigid restrictions: the 
existence of so-called perfect competition, the absence of 
monopolies of any kind, complete liberalization of prices, 
absolute noninterference by the state in economic processes. 
  This methodological technique might be quite useful for the 
purposes of instruction in the basics of macroeconomics; 
however, it is unacceptable for working out a real economic 
policy. Life is always more complex than bookish models, and if 
it were not so, life would be simply boring. 
  Poor knowledge of the economic reality of Russia, the 
leading 
trends and driving forces of scientific-technical progress, 
structural shifts in production, and sociocultural factors of 
economic growth are the primary reasons for many poorly 
thought-out decisions which have brought on the current crisis 
in the country. Attaching hopes to bookish wisdom gives rise to 
a claim of one's recommendations being universal. Unfortunately, 
we have to admit that the level and complexity of Russian 
problems have turned out to be greater by an order of magnitude 
than the professional potential and competence of a majority of 
Western experts and advisers. No reasonable solution to our 
problems exists within the framework of the aforementioned 
dilemma. In both cases, the finale is the same--universal 
destruction and chaos. The way out is to break free from the 
trap and develop and carry out a well-conceived, realistic, and 
effective program of action. 
  It is important in principle to find and activate 
noninflationary factors for stimulating investment, production, 
and employment which would amount to the practical refutation of 
the dilemma in question and, at the same time, prove it to be 
far-fetched. 
  Here is one more introductory remark. Miracles do not happen 
in real life. As the saying goes, one cannot go to bed in an 
economy that is badly sick and wake up to a completely healthy 
economy in the morning. Anticrisis programs should always take 
into account the time factor, be guided by strategic thinking, 
and be designed to be at least two to three moves ahead rather 
than just one. Individual actions, for example, infusions of 
financing to eliminate "bottlenecks," may entail unfavorable 
consequences in the short term (growth of the budget deficit), 
but in the very near future may result in perceptibly curing the 
economy and replenishing the state treasury. On the contrary, 
instantaneous advantages produced, for example, by an increase 
in the tax rate will in a very short time result in an 
unavoidable fall in budget revenues and bring about a further 
deterioration of the financial situation. 
  Incidentally, statesmanlike wisdom is found in the ability 
to 
subordinate tactical decisions to strategic objectives, to steer 
the course of events instead of responding to them, and to 
engage in fire prevention rather than firefighting. 
<H5>  Inflation </H5>
  In monetarist concepts, inflation is viewed as an isolated 
phenomenon, separate from its linkage to the structure of 
production, the existing system of economic mutual relations, 
and processes occurring at the microlevel. Growth of money 
supply in circulation is considered to be the only cause of 
inflation, and therefore containment of this supply is 
considered to be the only way to fight it. All means are good to 
this end: depreciation of the deposits of the population, late 
payment of wages, cutting budgetary appropriations for social 
and other programs, sky-high interest rates on credit, and so on. 
  All objections by opponents are rejected out of hand by 
referring to the same dilemma: Inflation cannot be stopped 
without the contraction of investment, cutbacks in production, 
mass unemployment, and reductions in the incomes of the 
population. 
  However, as has already been said, this is a far-fetched 
dilemma. Under our conditions, the nature and causes of 
inflation are much more complex, and so are the methods for 
reining it in. Along with monetary demand--an important factor, 
but not the only one and at present not even the dominant 
one--causes such as the growth of costs, the high level of 
monopolization in the economy, disruption of the existing system 
of economic relations with consumers being rigidly tied to their 
suppliers for considerations of technology, and the 
criminalization of economic relations are at work in this 
instance. Thus, some specialists estimate that no liberalization 
has actually occurred in the trade sector: The distribution of 
merchandise resources and price setting are controlled by the 
criminal structures more firmly than was the case in the time of 
the administrative-command system. 
  It is not consequences but rather causes that should be 
fought. Inflation will not be overcome, even by way of primitive 
price "freezes," without these causes being eliminated; it might 
merely be driven deeper (which is largely the cause for the 
nonpayments crisis that has broken out). 
  Many scenarios for solving the problems exist outside the 
framework of the monetarist dilemma. One such scenario was 
proposed in a joint report of the RAN [Russian Academy of 
Sciences] Division of Economics and the Reform Foundation. Its 
objectives were to normalize all aspects of the process of 
reproduction, set fixed prices for a limited assortment of raw 
material resources and railway tariffs for a period of time, 
perfect financial policy (including tax policy), and use a 
reconciliation procedure for regulating the ratio of prices to 
wages. 
  Such efforts should be made in several stages. According to 
calculations of the RAN Institute of National Economic 
Projections made with the use of relevant models, the rate of 
inflation can be reduced to 8-10 percent a month as early as the 
first stage, and at the second stage, as a result of taking the 
entire complex of measures, to 3-5 percent per month. The 
discrepancy in these numbers which has been the subject of much 
debate recently is not due to the subjective aspect of the 
approach but to the completeness and sequence of implementation 
of the program of inflation control measures. 
  To my mind, the fundamental difference (and advantage) of 
this program is found in the fact that it can be carried out 
without a fall in production and investment activity. In other 
words, the program is called upon to overcome the stereotype 
according to which a further recession is considered to be the 
unavoidable payment for reining in inflation. 
  As we revisit the issue of restricting demand and, 
primarily, 
reducing budget appropriations, we must stress that we have 
reached the critical threshold in this area. It will no longer 
suffice to say that we would have to cut through living flesh. 
To cross this threshold would mean to experience all the horrors 
and consequences of an economic catastrophe. 
  Perhaps there is only one item in which reductions are 
possible and feasible; it is expenditures for maintaining the 
immensely swollen government apparatus. This is not at all about 
resource savings which may turn out to be not all that 
significant in and of themselves. Something else is more 
important. According to the well-known Parkinson's law, the 
growing apparatus generates work for itself, complicates the 
decisionmaking procedure, boosts red tape and bureaucratic 
practices many times over, and spawns corruption (especially 
under our conditions). Cutbacks and streamlining in the 
government apparatus produce a tremendous economic effect by 
developing initiative and enterprise in all elements of the 
economy. 
  There has been much talk about subsidies for agriculture, 
too, which "ruin the budget and merely spur on inflation." 
Indeed, it is well known that any reasonable idea may be 
perverted, and that in incapable hands all means are used to 
hinder rather than further the end. 
  A contract system is the most reasonable and 
noninflationary--which is particularly important--way to support 
the rural areas and saturate the consumer market. It ensures the 
delivery of resources to federal and regional stocks on the 
basis of compliance with price parities, guarantees the recovery 
of appropriations for the acquisition of agricultural machinery, 
fuel, and mineral fertilizer, provides stable "rules of the 
game," and builds the confidence of the rural population in the 
government. 
  It is easy to imagine what awaits us in the fall if such 
confidence is not restored. The peasants simply will not sell 
grain to the state. It will be impossible to put the squeeze on 
them by any hard or soft financing measures: On a 
self-sufficient farm, the peasant will feed himself with meat 
and milk, potatoes and vegetables. Meanwhile, there is no leeway 
associated with import purchases of grain and foodstuffs. A 
situation greatly reminiscent of the year 1927 may emerge. 
<H5>  Investment </H5>
  Of course, we cannot count on a sharp increase in 
investment, 
given the tremendous decline in the gross domestic product (by 
about 40 percent of the precrisis level). Nonetheless, it is 
quite realistic to enliven investment activities very shortly 
and augment the influx of capital investment into the national 
economy. This may be done on a noninflationary basis. 
  First of all, we should add selective (customized) support 
for priority spheres and production facilities to the quite 
stringent financial and credit policy. This is about 
concentrating the limited investment resources on pursuits in 
which they are capable of relieving social tensions and, most 
importantly, producing significant results quickly. The 
so-called multiplier effect works in this instance: Relatively 
small resources produce results that exceed the initial 
investment many times over. For example, resources are 
concentrated on housing construction (out of the funds of the 
population and enterprises, the federal and local budgets, and 
easy credit). This immediately boosts the demand for cement and 
bricks, products of wood processing, the output of glass and 
sheet iron. Their production expands (after all, the capacity is 
idle!), and the demand for the products of companion industries 
appears. 
  To select appropriate priorities and concentrate resources 
for them--this is what the real state regulation of the economy 
and the conduct of an active structural policy are all about. 
This maneuver would be implemented within the framework of 
existing financial resources, without resorting to the 
additional emission of currency or increasing the burden on the 
budget. 
  Perhaps the largest, stable, and, once again, 
noninflationary 
source of investment is associated with privatization (provided 
that we forget about its voucher mode as we would a nightmare). 
The Russian state, the components of the Federation, and 
municipal structures have quite expensive property. They would 
resolve to relinquish some of their property to others--at its 
real price. As a result of the effected operation, they would 
have the same resources, which we would call "capital," but in 
monetary rather than tangible form. They would be able to 
allocate these resources at their discretion for the 
construction of health-maintenance centers or maternity wards, 
schools or university laboratories, housing construction, and 
telephone installation in the settlement. 
  Once again, it is important to stress that investment funds 
would be obtained on a noninflationary basis; they would not 
require emission or budget subsidies. Only a reasonable 
redistribution of resources would occur which would ensure the 
mutual reconciliation of the processes of privatization, 
structural changes, and a pickup in investment activities. 
  The solution appears to be surprisingly simple and 
immediately evident--provided of course that we give up the 
extremely ideological desire to deprive the state of its 
economic might and influence (at any price). In this instance, 
it is very important to avoid the transient urge to blow away 
and send down the drain capital assets created by the labors of 
several generations. 
  Creating conditions that make it possible to shift the 
interests of both the economic agents and the population from 
current expenditures to long-term investments also is one of key 
issues in creating a favorable investment climate in our 
country. In particular, this presupposes the protection of 
amortization allowances against possible depreciation, tax 
exemption for profits earmarked for investment, and the creation 
of specialized investment accounts and banks. 
  It is quite important to divert a proportion of the monetary 
income of the population from current spending to savings, and 
not in the form of the increment of cash balances but in forms 
that make it possible to use savings for investment purposes. In 
this matter, restoration of confidence in the banking system is 
a key issue. This is not easy to achieve following the serious 
mistakes that were allowed to occur. However, it is extremely 
naive to count on success without the restoration of such 
confidence. 
  Special-purpose savings for the construction of housing, 
certainly with reliable state guarantees, could be very 
promising. The need for housing is exceptionally high; 
meanwhile, the commissioning of residential buildings (in 
millions of square meters) dropped from 62.6 in 1985 and 61.7 in 
1990 to 41.8 in 1993 (in 1992 it was 41.5 million square meters). 
  Diverting the demand to housing could reduce pressure on the 
consumer market, reduce shortages in certain commodity groups, 
and thus become an important inflation-control factor. 
  In a word, a number of serious proposals exist which make it 
possible, contrary to popular stereotypes, to combine 
inflation-control measures with support for production and 
stimuli for investment activities. 
<H5>  Nonpayments </H5>
  The course of economic policy which was monetarist in nature 
and was lopsidedly geared toward restricting monetary demand in 
every way possible brought about a profound distortion of the 
entire system of financial relations. The liberalization of 
prices accompanied by the actual freezing of the working capital 
of enterprises deprived the latter of an opportunity to make 
timely payments for products purchased. No improvement in the 
system of settlements, which is important in its own right, can 
improve the situation. 
  Therefore, profound and completely antimarket disproportions 
have developed in the economy both between the ratios of prices 
and the working capital of enterprises, and between capital 
benefits and the current stream of material and financial 
resources. The following data testify to this eloquently. The 
fixed assets of all sectors of the national economy and all 
forms of ownership came, after their reappraisal as of 1 July 
1992, to 41.3 trillion rubles [R]. The gross domestic product 
(in current prices) came to R162.3 trillion in 1993. The 
national wealth which has been accumulated over decades ended up 
coming to one-quarter of the yearly product! 
  However, this is not yet all. Prices for goods and services 
keep growing, whereas the price of fixed capital is strictly 
fixed and held under the strictest administrative control. Not 
one enterprise (whatever its form of ownership) is entitled to 
reappraise the cost of its fixed assets. This is regarded as an 
understatement of profits and tax evasion. The movement of goods 
and services, on one hand, and the movement of fixed capital, on 
the other hand, ended up severed. Enterprises are deprived of 
the opportunity to maintain even direct reproduction. These are 
the in-depth roots of the nonpayments crisis! 
  To a considerable degree, nonpayments were also provoked by 
the direct actions of the government, more precisely, the 
Ministry of Finance. As of the end of 1993, the volume of 
past-due accounts receivable came to R18 trillion, of which the 
debt of the budget to the agrarian sector, enterprises of the 
defense complex, and establishments financed from the budget 
accounted for R7.8 trillion. At times, altogether paradoxical 
situations emerge: The Ministry of Finance does not pay for the 
products of the Southern Urals Gold Combine. Could it be that 
the ministry does not need them, or that there is no demand for 
them? 
  Once again, we have to say that it is impossible to rectify 
the situation overnight. Painstaking efforts will be needed to 
restore the distorted financial system, eliminate existing 
disproportions, and fine-tune an effective settlement mechanism. 
<H5>  Employment </H5>
  Finally, about the last point of the dilemma in 
question--the 
allegedly inevitable growth of unemployment as the price for 
reining in inflation. In this matter, the already mentioned 
arguments prevail without a serious generalization of world 
experience and an analysis of Russian reality. "Experts" usually 
refer to the Phillips curve. 
  However, before moving on directly to the problems of 
employment, we would like to dwell on related and equally acute 
issues. An analysis by scientists from the RAN Institute of 
Economics indicates that the purely numerical data on the growth 
of unemployment conceal more profound and alarming trends. At 
issue are loss of occupational prestige, the mass 
disqualification of labor, and an abrupt decline in incentives 
to master knowledge and skills. The impact of such tendencies 
over any length of time poses the unavoidable threat of the 
destruction of not only the economic but also the labor 
potential of the country. Meanwhile, it is precisely the labor 
potential of the country that should, in the long run, become a 
guarantee of the real success of economic reform--an improvement 
in the standard and quality of living of Russian citizens. 
  At present, discourse to the effect that if people want to 
work and know how, unemployment is not a threat to them sounds 
hypocritical. Appeals to ethics in the course of discussing the 
problems of unemployment are generally quite dubious. Under our 
conditions, they are just politically irresponsible. After all, 
presently the most gifted and talented workers, engineers, 
designers, and scientists, those who are just priceless, who not 
only know how but want to work, are left without jobs as a 
result of the cataclysmic crisis and the stoppage of 
enterprises. An economic model which is not in a position to use 
the richest labor potential, in a way the "gold reserve" of the 
nation, is flawed in its very foundation. It is a shame for the 
country and for ourselves. 
  Let us move on to employment issues proper. The already 
described measures aimed at stimulating production and 
investment activities are capable of substantially boosting 
demand for labor, and then without using inflationary factors. 
We should add to this the potential of cooperatives and various 
forms of self-employment of the population, including the 
establishment of small enterprises at which the owner and the 
employee are frequently one and the same (a tailor, car 
repairman, manufacturer of craft products, and so on). 
  As a rule, the creation of new jobs in this sphere does not 
require significant investment of any consequence. At the same 
time, an opportunity will appear to add considerable amounts of 
goods and services on the consumer market which is, in terms of 
its character, an inflation-controlling step. 
  What is needed from the government and municipal organs? It 
is not additional money and subsidies but merely 
cooperation--the simplification of procedures for opening such 
enterprises, tax exemptions for them (if the newly formed cells 
of self-employment did not emerge, the unemployed would be 
paying no taxes!), the provision of vacant premises for them, 
and so on. 
  The experience of organizing so-called "public works" which 
are well known in the practice of the world and have proven 
themselves in the implementation of anticrisis programs needs to 
be analyzed in particular. 
  In summation, we would like to discuss opportunities for 
supporting low-income strata of the population without 
increasing the budget deficit or amplifying the inflationary 
spiral. 
  As is known, in recent years the population has been 
markedly 
stratified in terms of income level. The incomes of the most 
affluent 10 percent exceeded the incomes of the least affluent 
10 percent by a factor of 4.5 in 1991. In 1992 this ratio came 
to as much 7.5-8, and in 1993, as much as 11. When this ratio 
exceeds 10:1, a society enters a stage conducive to the 
development of acute social conflicts. 
  So, if a progressive tax on the incomes of the most affluent 
is established at the rate of, say, 10 percent of their income 
(which would hardly be too burdensome), this will make it 
possible to increase the incomes of the least affluent by a 
factor of two! This will not require the printing of a single 
additional ruble. How to perform such an operation is an issue 
of political will and professional technique. 
  At the same time, creating conditions for the people to be 
able to work and make money is the main way to fight poverty 
rather than increasing the number of wards of the state. This 
can only be done if socioeconomic policy is aimed at 
resuscitating production, at shaping a new type of economic 
behavior with the plank of self-support for individuals and 
families. 
  Therefore, the dilemma in question does not stand up to 
criticism on any of its elements. The time has come to learn the 
lessons of the bitter experience of recent years, to change the 
strategic planks of economic policy, and to reject the 
stereotypes and dogmas that form its foundation.

<F P=106> [Article by Dmitriy Belyayev, chief of the production </F>
analysis and forecasting branch of the Russian Federation 
Government's Economic Situation Center: "On Clearing Accounts 
and Nonpayments in Industry"] 
  [Text] The system crisis, which our economy is undergoing, 
is more and more acquiring the features of a financial crisis, 
one of whose characteristic manifestations is the overdue debt 
(nonpayments) of major economic agents. 
  The braking of the economic ties that have taken shape, the 
obsolete technical and technological base, the exhaustion of 
natural resources, and other circumstances -- very important as 
they are -- are now retreating to second place after mutual 
nonpayments based on their impact on the decline in industrial 
production, business activity, hidden and obvious unemployment, 
delays in paying wages, and, as a consequence, the increase of 
social tension in society. 
  The mutual indebtedness of economic agents in a market 
economy is a normal phenomenon caused by the expansion of credit 
and monetary relationships and one that insures the 
uninterrupted operation of the economic mechanism; however, the 
failure of economic agents to fulfill the financial obligations 
assumed by them automatically leads to their bankruptcy. 
  Under our conditions with the absence of an effective 
bankruptcy mechanism, the overdue indebtedness of the main 
economic agents has acquired a mass nature. Whereas the total 
creditor indebtedness of industrial, construction, transport, 
and agricultural enterprises and organizations was 48 trillion 
rubles at the end of 1993, overdue liabilities were 17 trillion 
rubles, that is, more than 35 percent. Correspondingly, the 
incurred debt on 1 January 1994 was equal to 47 trillion rubles, 
including an overdue indebtedness of 18 trillion rubles, i.e., 
more than 38 percent. 
  Of the total amount of overdue creditor and incurred 
liabilities, 77 and 79 percent, respectively, fall to industry's 
share. 
  Of all the incurred and creditor indebtedness items, 
"Indebtedness of Buyers" and "Indebtedness to Suppliers," which 
compose approximately 70 percent of the incurred and creditor 
indebtedness, respectively, have paramount importance for 
industrial production. 
  Late payment for products received leads not only to a 
worsening of the enterprises' financial condition but also 
disrupts the production process and, in a number of cases, leads 
to its stoppage. Moreover, these types of obligations are 
transmitted from one enterprise to another over the existing 
cooperation ties, causing a chain reaction of nonpayments. The 
state itself is aggravating the situation that has taken shape 
by delaying payments to enterprises for the products produced in 
accordance with its orders. 
  The overdue indebtedness of industrial enterprises to their 
suppliers is less than the indebtedness of buyers to these 
enterprises by more than 3 trillion rubles. 
  In other words, industry is emerging to a certain degree as 
a 
creditor for the other branches of the national economy and the 
budget. Almost all industrial branches, except for non-ferrous 
metallurgy and the flour, cereal and animal feed industries, 
have a positive balance in their mutual debts but the 
nonpayments of electrical energy buyers exceed this branch's 
debt to suppliers by more than twofold. 
  The branch structure of overdue indebtedness in industry is 
described by the following data (without considering debts for 
deliveries within the framework of intergovernmental agreements).

suppliers form the largest percentage in the debts of all 
industry -- 27 percent. In this regard, the percentage of the 
branch's overdue indebtedness in the overall indebtedness of 
industry significantly exceeds its percentage in the total 
production volume, that is, the burden of mutual nonpayments is 
felt most sharply in the fuel industry. 
  The amount of overdue debt -- both that of buyers and that 
to 
suppliers -- in industry during 1993 fell somewhat considering 
inflation. Thus, the total overdue debt to suppliers increased 
eightfold and prices grew 9-10-fold during this period. 
  However, the nonpayment burden did not become lighter 
because 
of this since the decline in production continued and, 
correspondingly, the potential capabilities of the enterprises 
to fulfill their financial obligations narrowed. 
  An analysis of the dynamics of industrial production volume 
and of the overdue indebtedness growth during 1993 shows that 
the intensiveness (burden) of mutual nonpayments in industrial 
enterprises grew. 
  Thus, according to the center's calculations, the ratio of 
quarterly increases in overdue liabilities to production volume 
increased more than twofold during the year.

  It is characteristic that the ratio of the quarterly 
increases in the overdue indebtedness to industrial production 
volumes grew in almost all branches of industry and that the 
largest growth was noted in the wood, woodworking, wood-pulp, 
and paper industry; ferrous metallurgy; the power industry; and 
the fuel industry. 
  It is in these branches and also in the chemical and 
petrochemical industry that the "burden" of mutual indebtedness 
is the highest. 
  The worsening of the enterprises' financial condition owing 
to the increase in the burden of mutual nonpayments is also 
confirmed by an analysis of the enterprises' ability to pay. 
  According to the results of the first half of the year, the 
monetary assets, which enterprises had available, exceeded 
overdue indebtedness to the suppliers 1.24-fold but these assets 
covered the mentioned indebtedness by only 57.4 percent by the 
end of the year. 
  Whereas within the structure of all industry, the power 
industry, fuel industry, machine building and metal working, and 
the glass, china and pottery industry had an excess of monetary 
assets over the overdue indebtedness to suppliers at the end of 
the first half of 1993, the debts significantly exceeded all 
existing enterprise financial assets by the end of last year in 
all branches of industry. This is described by the following 
data:

first nine months of 1993. 


  The enterprises of ferrous metallurgy, the chemical and 
petrochemical industry, the construction materials industry, and 
the flour, cereal and animal fodder industry are in a critical 
condition based on their ability to pay. 
  It is typical that the low ability of industrial enterprises 
to pay is frequently accompanied by a high or super-high 
production profitability in a number of branches. 
  Thus, production profitability in ferrous metallurgy was 64 
percent and 45-48 percent in the chemical and petrochemical 
industry, non-ferrous metallurgy, and machine building and metal 
working. 
  The liberalization of prices led to substantial pressure on 
the effective demand for products of a production and technical 
nature and consumer goods. Enterprises tried to compensate for 
the reduction in the sales volume of products and the amounts of 
earned monetary assets, which followed this, not by reducing 
costs and increasing the quality of products but by an 
additional increase in prices. As a result, the market is 
narrowing even more, the demand for products is decreasing, 
their sales and receipts are again falling, and the way out is 
seen to be a new price increase. 
  The high degree of monopolization in our domestic industry 
is 
exerting a definite influence on the level of prices. 
  The Russian Federation's Government has outlined a series of 
measures to solve the nonpayments problem, in particular, 
repaying federal budget debts for 1993, legalizing overdue 
indebtedness by promissory notes, checking on the condition of 
inefficient production facilities, increasing the responsibility 
of banks for timely settlement, launching a mechanism for 
sanctions and the carrying out of bankruptcies, and other 
measures. 
  Only the integrated use of these measures and the very 
active 
participation of regional management structures, commercial 
banks and enterprises themselves based on agreements with 
subcontractors and the consumers of their products will permit 
the problem of mutual nonpayments to be solved. 
  The implementation of the listed measures will not suffer 
delays: During January 1994 alone, the total overdue creditor 
indebtedness in the national economy increased another 3 
trillion rubles. The overdue incurred debt increased just as 
much. 
  Solving the nonpayments problem will contribute to ending 
the 
crisis phase and stopping the production decline. 
  At the same time, one cannot permit the elimination of 
enterprises producing vitally necessary products, whose closing 
would inflict harm on the country's defense and economic 
security. However, the state must also consider the interests of 
the creditors when solving this question and, possibly, itself 
assuming the repayment of these enterprises' debts.

<F P=106> [Article by Marat Salimov, under the rubric "Reforming the </F>
Banking System": "Bankers and Entrepreneurs Have Agreed To 
Maintain the Status Quo"] 
  [Text] The Central Bank of Russia is opposing 
significant changes in the established banking system. This was 
shown by the meeting of representatives of commercial banks, 
trading companies, and the Central Bank of Russia, held 
yesterday at the Russian Chamber of Trade and Industry and 
devoted to discussion of proposed banking legislation. At this 
meeting the Central Bank came out against the formation of a 
federal reserve system. It is notable that the representatives 
of the commercial banks did not insist on any substantial change 
in banking law either. 
  Yesterday's meeting of representative of state and 
commercial 
structures was organized to discuss legislative proposals to 
amend and supplement the Law "On the Central Bank of the RSFSR 
(Bank of Russia)" and the Law "On Banks and Banking in the 
RSFSR," which are planned to be put on the agenda in parliament 
in the near future. Konstantin Lubenchenko, head of the legal 
department of the Central Bank, spoke at the meeting. He stated 
that the proposed bill on the Central Bank is an attempt to 
increase the degree of the bank's independence of the 
government, which will make it possible to implement financial 
and emissions policy more effectively. An innovation in the bill 
is the point on forming a consulting council at the Central 
Bank, consisting of representatives of leading banks and banking 
associations, national economic specialists, specialists from 
financial bodies, and scholars. In Lubenchenko's opinion, the 
activities of this council will enable the Central Bank 
management to reach decisions efficiently on the most important 
matters touching the interests of all agents of the financial 
system without exception. 
  In all, Lubenchenko's talk showed that the Central Bank has 
no interest at all in significant change in the Russian banking 
system. It is noteworthy that Lubenchenko touched especially on 
the issue of the prospects of establishing a federal reserve 
system in Russia on the model of the one that exists in the 
United States. In the opinion of the Central Bank 
representative, which from all appearances coincides with the 
opinion of the bank management, "At the present time there is no 
need to copy the American plan, nor do conditions for it exist." 
Furthermore, he said, in the States the Federal Reserve System 
is in fact being subjected to harsh criticism and is blamed for 
the collapse of national monetary policy. A similar opinion was 
expressed on this matter on the same day at a Central Bank 
briefing (see the article on this same page). 
  It is noteworthy that neither this position nor the proposed 
bills aroused any particular condemnation from those present. It 
is true that representatives of the commercial banks stated that 
it would be wise for the bills to stipulate specifically what 
constitutes banking activity as compared to other types of 
entrepreneurial activity. At present, in their opinion, these 
specifics are not being taken into account, and the authorities 
have an opportunity to receive unobstructed information which 
bank clients do not have an interest in divulging. Furthermore, 
it was suggested that the legal basis of registration be put in 
more concrete terms and that the sphere of activity of bank 
associations and councils be defined more specifically. But not 
one representative of the commercial banks spoke in favor of a 
fundamental reform of the banking system, for example for 
conversion of their own bank into a federal reserve bank. 
<H5>  Primary Tasks of the Bank of Russia (From the Draft </H5>
Law) 

  -  Ensuring the stability of the Russian Federation 
monetary unit and increasing its purchasing power; 
  -  Organizing 
and supporting the uninterrupted functioning of the payment 
mechanism in the national economy; 
  -  Development of the Russian 
Federation's credit and banking system by all possible 
means; 
  -  Conducting currency regulation and monitoring in 
conformity with Russian Federation law. 
<H5>  Documents Necessary for Foreign Legal Persons To Receive a </H5>
Banking License (From the Draft Law): 

  -  a decision of the 
foreign founder on its participation in founding a bank in 
Russia or opening a branch; 
  -  a document that confirms the status 
of the founder and its published balances for the last 3 
years; 
  -  the written consent of the monitoring agency of the 
founder's country of residence to its participation in forming a 
bank in Russia or opening a branch.

<F P=106> [Interview with Vladimir Igorevich Rachuk, president of the </F>
Chara-Holding Corporation, conducted by unnamed interviewer; 
place and date not given] 
  [Text] It would seem that there is no longer any 
financial niche for the appearance of a new bank. But even so 
almost every day we hear of the birth of new financial centers. 
But some die almost before their advertisements appear, while 
others survive and put pressure on competitors. Chara is 
evidence of that. People prefer to endure the wait in order to 
put their money in this particular bank. And this is the third 
year like that. What is going on? Is it merely high interest 
rates on deposits? 
  The president of the Chara-Holding Corporation, 
Vladimir Rachuk, answers these and other questions. 
  [Interviewer] So are you people here at Chara altruists? You 
are not interested in profits, you give depositors more than 
other banks. What is your interest in doing that? 
  [Rachuk] High interest rates on personal deposits is Chara's 
fundamental position. Despite the fact that interest payments 
eat up a large part of profits. But generally we are against 
excessive profits. And not only because they are disadvantageous 
because of high taxes. To periphrase Suvorov, let me say: profit 
is nothing, but circulation is fine. 
  From the start the idea of the bank was built on that: 
reaching the maximum turnover with minimum profitability, only 
that which is vitally necessary to the bank. On the one hand, 
this allows us to develop quickly, and on the other, to attract 
depositors with truly advantageous conditions for placing their 
savings. 
  But there is really no other way today; what sense is there 
in cutting off the branch you are sitting on. Besides, a large 
part of the capital used to pay interest is immediately returned 
to us in the form of new deposits. So it is simply beneficial 
for the bank to pamper the client and allow him to get rich. 
  However, promising high interest rates by no means solves 
everything. Intelligent depositors try to reach the golden 
medium, excellent profits and the absolute reliability of 
capital placement. Orienting ourselves precisely to this 
category, from the very start we took it as our rule to "Do it 
well or don't do it at all." 
  [Interviewer] But in order to create a system which will 
work 
well from the start, serious preliminary preparations are 
needed. Organizational, financial, cadre, and psychological 
preparations. 
  [Rachuk] Yes, although we started later than others, we were 
able to rely on the experience of the first wave of banks, 
became familiar with practices in organizing banking abroad, and 
did serious marketing work. 
  This allowed us to define our "niche" more precisely. 
Inasmuch as there was still a very strong prejudice against 
banks created by private persons, the goal was set of creating a 
bank which enjoyed special trust, even if at first it was only 
among a small group of persons, you know, a "bank for our own 
people," in which credit policy could possibly be conducted 
without special risk. 
  Those who knew us were the first to come to us. And since 
before then we had already actively and quite successfully done 
business in the spheres of hotel services and real estate and a 
number of other spheres, many people knew about us. Add personal 
acquaintances and the acquaintances of our acquaintances. 
  We were initially located in a small apartment and the 
director's office was in a tiny kitchen. The entire bank, so to 
speak, operated as an insurance company before receiving a 
license. But that did not frighten people away; on the contrary 
it somehow even made us closer to our clients. We dealt with 
them not across an official counter, but rather seated at a desk. 
  Many film and theater figures, journalists, and famous 
doctors were the first to come to us. The point is that my 
father, the professor of film studies, Igor Rachuk, gave half 
his life to cinematography, and I hope that it was precisely the 
kind memory of him that brought us hundreds of people whose 
names would do honor to any bank where they were customers. 
  Today the bank has grown and become transformed in many 
respects. But we will always be grateful to our "veterans," who 
essentially created the bank along with us. And I hope later 
clients do not condemn us for showing special attention to the 
bank's pioneers. 
  [Interviewer] You talk as if Chara already had decades of 
tranquil activity with no conflict behind it. But you are only 2 
years old and most likely everything was not smooth. 
  [Rachuk] Do you remember the Pavlov banknote exchange? That 
was when we first passed the test for our depositors and within 
24 hours before the deadline were already beginning to issue 
them money in the form of the new notes. 
  The second test befell us along with the entire country in 
the days of the October events. Political instability is deadly 
for banking and institutions like it. It creates artificially 
excited demands for cash deposits and provokes unreturned 
credits. This time everything was moving in exactly that 
direction. The simplest and most painless thing would have been 
to take advantage of the formal cause and suspend operations, 
since as we were located in the very heart of Moscow, on Tver, 
we naturally fell under the rules of the state of emergency. 
  But we did not resort to that. A plan for emergency 
conditions conceived in advance was promptly put into effect. 
All financial operations were suspended, with the exception of 
service to private persons. So that, God forbid, work did not 
stop for a minute because of a shortage of cash, which would 
have immediately created panic. In advance we had prepared a 
reserve of liquid securities to be put into circulation. 
  The psychological preparation of personnel helped a great 
deal. Employees were calm and confident and worked quickly and 
carefully, like stewardesses in a plane which has gone into a 
tailspin. And this is hard to believe, but the situation changed 
diametrically; people who just a few hours earlier were only 
thinking of how to pull out their money, instead deposited their 
last money, convinced that it would be safer here than at home. 
  I was especially pleased that this happened in my absence. I 
was on vacation and I could influence events only by telephone. 
  [Interviewer] Let us assume that at that time you managed to 
master the situation and get rid of tension by showing a high 
class of professionalism. Such banking techniques are familiar 
from the well-known novel by Arthur Haley, "The Moneychangers." 
But what if your plan had not worked and a large majority of 
your depositors had all the same demanded their money? Would 
that have been a disaster for you? 
  [Rachuk] On the day that Roosevelt died, in New York the 
huge 
simultaneous load on the city's phone system broke it down: too 
many people wanted to share the sad news with one another. Don't 
believe a banker who maintains that he has never had a nightmare 
about this situation. Every person must work and watch for that. 
Especially in our time and in our country. 
  Nonetheless, I do not doubt that any bank which plays an 
honest game will fulfill its obligations. It is a different 
matter altogether that many, especially beginning bankers, do so 
at the price of their own ruin. 
  Each bank decides how to insure itself against this 
occurrence in its own way. We would like to believe we have 
insured ourselves with special flexibility. The Chara-Holding 
Corporation envisions corporate responsibility for the 
promissory notes of each of the companies which are members of 
it. First of all this applies to the Chara Bank, which is the 
core of the holding company. Our potential allows us to use the 
reserve system as a basis for financial resources, in amounts 
which more than cover all obligations to depositors. 
  There are purely tactical techniques. For example, the 
problem of a harmonious combination of long-term, medium-term, 
and short-term credits must constantly be a focus of attention. 
The point is that from the standpoint of elementary logic, in 
order to ensure that loan capital is returned, it must always be 
"at hand," hence, long-term investments must be avoided. That is 
on the one hand. On the other, to tie the bank to short-term 
credits means to deliberately renounce the bank's development 
and realization of large-scale constructive programs which the 
state and society have the right to count on. The art of 
banking, it seems to me, certainly consists of the ability to 
find and maintain this fragile point of balance. 
  I assure you with all responsibility that the Chara Bank is 
ready at any time to meet all of its responsibilities. Although 
it will naturally have to sacrifice something. 
  [Interviewer] Do you mean to say that you have more tangible 
securities than money? 
  [Rachuk] Exactly. Above all real estate. In the center of 
Moscow alone we own five large installations. Selling them in an 
emergency means losing a great deal, of course. To be frank, it 
would be devilishly painful to realize that what we have begun 
will be completed by others. I hope it will not reach that point. 
  I want to believe that we have earned our depositors' trust. 
And if more difficult moments come, they will help us survive 
and through ill-considered actions will not begin destroying the 
mechanism that works in depositors' own interests. 
  [Interviewer] Vladimir Igorevich, all this is remarkable. 
But 
money must be put to work. Only then can it reproduce itself. 
There are legends surrounding Chara. People even say that the 
bank subsidizes the narcotics trade. Otherwise, where would such 
high interest rates on deposits come from? 
  [Rachuk] Well, that is of course complete nonsense. We 
respect ourselves and our clients too much to get involved in 
questionable operations. Our money is put to work in real 
estate, since, as I already said, even before the bank's 
creation we had accumulated experience in realtor activity. The 
quick rate of turnover of capital invested in this business is 
attractive. And its efficiency. The growth rate and the money, 
and in dollars too, for major real estate are such that our 
monthly obligations on loan resources invested in it are covered 
with interest. 
  The second general direction is securities. Everyone who is 
close to financial spheres recognizes the need to develop a 
secondary securities market. Unfortunately, this is somewhat 
blocked by legislation restricting the circulation of securities 
made out to the bearer. Despite this, we decided to be actively 
involved in this activity. Properly, well-thought-out work with 
securities during periods of sudden changes in the exchange rate 
of the dollar allows one to obtain profits of up to 1,500-2,000 
(!) percent annually. This is no longer the fruit of theoretical 
research but practice. The fairly complicated financial 
mechanisms which we created and in which the obligations of the 
Ministry of Finance, bank stock, promissory notes, "AVVA" stock, 
and other securities are linked in a single chain make it 
possible to obtain such high profits. 
  Also helpful is the fact that the Chara-Holding Corporation, 
the most important but only 1 of the 10 components of the Chara 
Bank, is a multispecialization firm and the primary enterprise 
organizes work to distribute financial capital with the greatest 
efficiency during any particular period of time. In other words, 
this helps us be in constant readiness to enter any civilized 
market with adequate financial resources. 
  [Interviewer] Real estate, that is understandable. But 
securities; today they are valuable and tomorrow not. All this 
is somehow risky. We are accustomed to expecting stability, 
reliability, and permanence from a bank. 
  [Rachuk] I understand your remark. So recently we have 
vigorously "invested" in enterprises such as GAZ [Gas] and the 
St. Petersburg optical-mechanical association LOMO. And while we 
began with buy-and-sell operations, now we are attempting to get 
hold of a sufficient block of stock to raise work efficiency at 
these large enterprises of Russia. 
  I am tired of hearing about the losses produced at 
high-tech, 
high-precision production facilities. I do not doubt that a boss 
who is vitally interested in the result will be able to organize 
things. There were and are wonderful specialists and engineers 
in Russia. Especially in St. Petersburg with its great 
traditions. But people must be paid decently. And to do this a 
system of material incentive must be created, a system like 
those which operate in developed countries. Like Japan. Yes, as 
has been repeated to us before, this is a sweatshop system. But 
personally I am confident and ready to state to the entire world 
that the greatest human invention is not the wheel, but the idea 
of exploitation. A person must exploit himself and make others 
work efficiently. That is precisely what moves civilization. 
Without exploitation even wheels would not have appeared. 
  Of course, investment capital will be needed. For example, 
70 
percent of the machine tools at LOMO must be replaced. Major 
customers will help accomplish this. They have already been 
found in the United States. I think that people interested in 
the large-scale program for night vision devices will also be 
found. 
  [Interviewer] What do you think of the Central Bank's recent 
decree on increasing bank charter capital to 2 billion rubles? 
  [Rachuk] We are already becoming accustomed to surprises 
which the state throws at us all of a sudden, in this case the 
state represented by the Central Bank. And we are learning to 
protect ourselves and our depositors from all types of surprises. 
  Speaking specifically of this Central Bank decision, it 
seems 
justified for Moscow. The rank of the capital banks commits them 
to a particular status. There is potential for this: According 
to certain information, up to 80 percent of the financial 
operations are carried out in our city. 
  As for the periphery and cities which do not lie at the 
crossroads of financial arteries, such a requirement is nonsense. 
  [Interviewer] Vladimir Igorevich! It seems that you and I 
have discussed everything except one problem: Is a depositor 
something abstract to you or really a living person? 
  [Rachuk] To me a depositor is an absolutely real individual: 
a person who has entrusted his money to us. Perhaps his last 
money, his only hope. I have also learned what drinking tea 
without sugar means. For a bank, when the number of depositors 
runs into the tens of thousands, unfortunately, more and more 
they become "all the same." Barriers of 
organizational-structural links have grown up between the 
"original clients" and our "ordinary clients." We have become 
separated. And it is very difficult to survive such a thing 
emotionally. This is by no means nostalgia for the office in the 
kitchen where we could talk confidentially with our depositors; 
for the bank as we envision it, the feedback mechanism is a 
vitally important condition. We and our clients are a single 
unit and we have a single breathing rhythm. 
  But can a banking institution conceived of as a "bank for 
its 
own people" remain like that at all in the new age and weight 
category? It seems it can, if you seek the solution of this 
problem on a different plane. 
  In our opinion, the Board of Trustees which we are creating 
under the Board of Directors of the Chara-Holding Corporation 
will help the bank keep its finger on the pulse of the entire 
mass of depositors. Depositors' interests will be represented 
there by people whose competent opinion, I am sure, will help 
better organize work with clients and raise the quality of 
service by bringing it closer to the requirements of European 
standards. 
  Determining the priority directions of charitable and 
sponsorship activity will be an important task of the Board of 
Trustees. Our business is to earn money, but how to "put it to 
work" for the good of our great but tormented country is a 
problem that must be resolved all together with God's help! 
  [Interviewer] In conclusion, what do you have to say about 
the raid by the tax police on the Chara Bank, which was made 
public in the mass information media in recent days? 
  [Rachuk] As for the raid on the bank's premises under the 
guise of searching for documents of an altogether different 
organization, we will of course take all legal steps to protect 
our honor and dignity. Whatever political or economic goals were 
being pursued by this raid on precisely the bank, I emphasize, 
rather than on the Chara enterprise, which is being formally 
audited and is located on the adjacent street, and which we knew 
of in advance, incidentally, our depositors will in no way 
suffer. I am speaking of this with complete confidence, since 
all the Chara Bank's activity is based on precise compliance 
with the laws.

<F P=106> [Interview with V. Gribov, president of Germes-Tsentr Bank, </F>
by T. Piskareva: "Bank's Silence Turns to Gold"] 
  [Text] A few days ago, on one of the television programs 
for "businesspeople," this spirited idea was heard: since 
commercial banks (almost all) operate at the expense of state 
credits, then all their profit ought to be taken away from them. 
The idea is spirited but just: after all, as many people are 
aware, all our most powerful, soundest commercial banks have 
hatched from state structures. The Moscow joint-stock bank [AB] 
Germes-Tsentr, is insured against that kind of "milking." Its 
president, Vladimir Gribov, allows that the bank could be 
nationalized or expropriated, and there could even be an attempt 
to rob it. "Just don't accuse us of getting rich off of state 
funds." Germes-Tsentr AB has never seen a single state kopek. It 
simply has no need of any. All its considerable capital comes 
from its shareholders, 99 percent of whom are "physical 
persons": ordinary citizens of Russia and the countries of the 
CIS. 
  [PRAVDA] Vladimir Grigoryevich, you will agree that you are 
at the head of a rather strange banking formation: what is a 
commercial bank and a people's bank at one and the same time. 
  [Gribov] Computer analysis of the data on our shareholders 
draws a "face" for the bank that is better than any 
advertisement--as of our last general meeting, we counted nearly 
75,000 shareholders. No single commercial bank in Russia has 
anything like it. Three-fourths of Germes-Tsentr's shareholders 
hold just 10 shares apiece. 
  [PRAVDA] Virtually all last year we heard nothing about the 
bank. Did you stand aloof that way intentionally? 
  [Gribov] The shareholders quite fairly have begun to 
criticize the bank for this. Naturally, all this time we have 
been working actively. And we have earned accordingly. The 
results of last year are these: we started the year with a 
balance of 5 billion, 26 million rubles [R] and ended with a 
balance of over R34 billion. The bank's profit for this period 
increased accordingly from R334 million to nearly R5 billion. 
  That is, we have grown significantly, and all on a shortage 
of financial fodder. After all, Germes-Tsentr Bank was founded 
less than two years ago, when the credit-financial market in 
Russia was actually separated out. The bank's capital stock at 
the time came to all of R25 million. According to the effective 
legislation, it was formed wholly out of the funds of its 
founders. But the founders increased the capital stock from 
their own deposits to R100 million. 
  To this day, the capital stock, which comes to R1 billion 
and 
$500,000, comes entirely from the shareholders. 
  [PRAVDA] Every bank has its own borrowers. Who do you extend 
credit to? 
  [Gribov] Last year the bank extended to its clients loans 
worth R50 billion. Of these, we gave R22 billion to the Germes 
concern, and R26 billion went for loans to other banks. 
  Germes-Tsentr is addressing itself to extending serious 
financing and credit to Russian fuel and energy programs. We 
intend to expand our work especially with individual depositors. 
  [PRAVDA] How might one formulate the principle of growth for 
the banking structure more precisely? Even the ordinary 
depositor, let alone the "commercial" one, senses that the bank 
is growing according to highly complex laws. 
  [Gribov] Germes-Tsentr is the heart of an entire system of 
banks that has to be looked on as a whole. For its part, Germes 
possesses an entire complex of independently operating banks: 
Tyumen-Germes, Germes-Volga, and Germes-Don, each of which has a 
network of branches and offices in various regions of Russia. In 
essence, this reflects the basic "Germes" principle: that 
exclusiveness, isolatedness, and drawing forces only toward 
yourself spell ruin. A bank's exclusiveness within the framework 
of a "head" office is highly undesirable. This is why, despite 
the enormous expense, Germes-Tsentr is proceeding to create new 
branches. In the near future, apparently, offices will be 
created in St. Petersburg, Kazan, and Yekaterinburg. 
  [PRAVDA] Money in Russia moves so slowly and listlessly now 
that it must not be easy to be "the heart of a system of banks." 
  [Gribov] Yes, this is a major disaster--the nonclearing of 
payments. Do you remember, during the last days of his 
premiership, Gaydar brought Moscow's leading bankers together to 
think over together the problem of the transaction system? They 
entrusted this to the Central Bank [TsB], but the task was 
simply too much for the TsB. A year ago, we put our payments for 
oil supplied, say, to Belarus or Ukraine through the TsB, but 
since the beginning of last June we haven't run a single payment 
to the countries of the CIS through the TsB. I am convinced that 
the commercial banks could solve the payments problem themselves. 
  [PRAVDA] Or clearing centers like the Ekspress system? 
  [Gribov] Naturally. Those who have come to us have had 
pretty 
good results. The Germes-Tsentr MAB [no expansion provided] 
became the initiator in the creation of the Ekspress system, 
which 12 Russian banks and the major commercial banks of the CIS 
countries have joined. Transactions do not go smoothly enough 
with all countries, but there are no problems on payments with 
Ukraine, Belarus, Moldova, or Kazakhstan. All transactions with 
them go through without TsB participation. 
  [PRAVDA] Vladimir Grigoryevich, Germes-Tsentr has taken its 
payments to shareholders (after the revaluation of shares) up to 
nearly 800-percent interest. A very appealing rate of interest, 
but does it safeguard shareholders against the grandiose, 
Russia-wide confusion, against the economic incoherence? 
  [Gribov] I'm a banker. And I will talk about what is closer 
and more understandable to me as a professional. I am very 
disturbed that Russia's banks are for all practical purposes not 
making investments. If investments are not made in the country's 
industry, it will reach an impasse. Look at the annual report of 
any commercial bank. So little is being invested in production 
you could cry. I'm ashamed for the banks. And alarmed for Russia. 
  Yes, the banks would be happy to make investments, but they 
cannot risk the money--other people's money, notice, this is 
after all the shareholders' money--so improbably. They don't 
have the right to sacrifice other people's interests or their 
own banking interests either. 
  I would simply remind you that today's discount rate is 210 
percent, and loans are probably no longer made at less than 213 
percent. In nature there does not exist a plan that can pay off, 
given that crazy loan rate. In essence, the discount rate has 
began to generate price increases and inflation. The income that 
the RF [Russian Federation] TsB and the Russian budget have 
bears an inflationary character. 
  It is time to make long-term loans for capital investment. 
Otherwise, we are never going to be able to straighten out our 
distorted economy. 
<H8>  * * * </H8>
  We are not wasting time--we are moving forward. The youngest 
check investment fund in Russia--Germes-Preobrazhenka--plans to 
pay its shareholders one of the highest dividends! 
  The fund's board of directors is recommending to the general 
meeting of shareholders: 
  --approval of dividends, based on the results of work in 
1993, in the amount of 300-percent interest calculated from the 
date of registration of the second issue prospectus; 
  --capitalizing the shareholder income with second-issue 
shares of the Germes concern AO (joint-stock company), 
substituting at shareholders' request with payment in monetary 
form. 
  The meeting will be held on 4 May 1994, at 11 o'clock, at 
19a 
Kuusinen Street (Polezhayevskaya Metro), Moscow. Shareholder 
registration begins at 10 o'clock. 
  Hurry! 
  Shares are still being sold! 
  Addresses of fund stores: 22 B. Polyanka Street, telephone 
238-80-55 (Polyanka Metro), and 24 Komsomolskiy Prospect,

<F P=106> [Interview with Ivan Petrovich Korovkin, president of </F>
Izdat-Bank, by Yelena Levina; place and date not given: "Keeping 
Manuscripts in the Bank!"] 
  [Text] There were many banks in Russia prior to the 
revolution: land banks, banks for the gentry, industrial banks, 
trade banks... We have enough banks today too. But a bank for 
the publishing sector is a unique phenomenon. The major 
publishers of the past--Sytin, Sveshnikov--relied on their 
private capital. And indeed, Izdat-Bank is the one and only 
financial institution of publishers today in the world. Why do 
they have a bank? With this question we began our conversation 
with Ivan Petrovich Korovkin, president of Izdat-Bank. 
  [Korovkin] The entire old system of banking services 
collapsed in five years, and the mass media confronted the 
problem: With what do we go to the market? Usually people go 
there with their intelligence and a ruble in their pocket. But 
where is the poor publisher to obtain money? So the concept was 
born of establishing a sector bank. The founders were the 
Russian State Committee on the Press, Ukraine State Committee 
for Publications, Republic of Belarus Ministry of Information, 
MOSKOVSKAYA PRAVDA publishing house, and others. They attempted 
to take into account the specific interests of the sector, 
developed a mechanism for supporting publication programs, 
created conditions for protecting the interests of investors, 
and gradually the editorial offices of 400 newspapers and 
magazines began opening up current accounts with us. 
  [Levina] What about the banks that used to hold their money? 
  [Korovkin] Some 114 banks were just about all at once 
deprived of steady clients--this does not come easy. We are 
trying to justify such a decision on the part of editorial 
offices and provide high-quality service. According to data from 
the Reyting agency, our bank is in the top 100 of Russia's 
largest banks. The annual balance-sheet turnover of Izdat-Bank 
is just short of half a trillion rubles. But this is not the 
main service we provide. Our assistance has enabled publishers 
to safeguard themselves from landslide devastation and 
bankruptcy. We have made conscientious outlays, and if a choice 
was presented whether to aid "our own" or "others," preference 
was shown to those connected with printing and publishing. They 
were afforded credits on preferential terms. We do not receive 
payment for opening current and settlement accounts. The 
interest rate for deposits in our bank is 300-310 percent. A 
client has the right to withdraw a portion of his investment at 
any time. 
  [Levina] It is said about banks that they are the 
circulatory 
system of the economy. Our economy is gravely ill. Are the banks 
not at least somewhat to blame for this? 
  [Korovkin] Banks constitute the only genuine market element 
of our economy. And for some reason it is they the state is 
ruining, choking them with taxes, leaving them no funds for 
investments. And this is one reason for the current wave of bank 
collapses. A second reason is reciprocal nonpayments. Banks are 
bearing tremendous losses due to untimely return of extended 
credits--they themselves are turning into debtors. The 
delinquent indebtedness of Izdat-Bank has increased 5.7-fold as 
of 1 January 1994, although the bank is replete with 
professionals who used to work in the Ministry of Finance, USSR 
Gosbank [State Bank]... 
  [Levina] Sometimes it seems that all our bankers and other 
prominent individuals in the business world--they all originate 
in the ministries... 
  [Korovkin] A misplaced irony. The system of bank formation 
we 
have in Russia is just now being established. We are sending 
young and willing specialists for instruction and on-the-job 
training in the United States, Austria, and Japan. 
  [Levina] Forgive me, but what is the benefit to us 
journalists by virtue of the fact that there is an Izdat-Bank in 
Russia? 
  [Korovkin] We opened up accounts for the families of 
journalists who died in Moscow during the events of 3 and 4 
October--accounts of one million rubles per family. Through 
financing we have supported the international book fair. We 
allocated funds for publication of the Russian-French magazine 
VIS-A-VIS. Until the Fund for Financial Support for Needy and 
Novice Authors is established, writers and journalists need not 
be ashamed to turn to us for assistance. Right now we are 
materially supporting the Russian classicist Leonid Leonov, who 
is 95 years old. He continues to work. He is writing a 
philosophical novel and is in critical need of funds. 
  [Levina] To the best of our knowledge, you yourself are now 
in need of money? 
  [Korovkin] I would not put it so strongly. We assumed 
responsibility for the accounting operations regarding budget 
financing of newspapers and magazines. We tried to establish 
control over the use of these funds and get an effective 
arrangement for knocking these funds loose from the Ministry of 
Finance. And then--we encountered opposition from officials of 
the Operations Directorate of the Russian Central Bank. They 
have been doing everything possible to impede the transfer of 
budget funds to the legal disposal of the sector bank. 
Intervention by the Ministry of Finance, the government, and 
even the president himself--have failed to produce a positive 
result. The Central Bank usurped the right to dispose of your 
money and ours. And this is R70 billion. Will we get this money? 
  [Levina] And after you--will we journalists get any money? 
And after us--will our readers get their newspapers and 
magazines? At the end of this rhetorical question let us not put 
a period, but an ellipsis...

<F P=106> [Article by Ivan Zhagel, IZVESTIYA correspondent: "The </F>
Association of Russian Banks Protests Against the Central Bank's 
Decision"] 
  [Text] As before the decision of the Central Bank to 
introduce a minimum rate of up to 2 billion rubles for the 
charter capital of banks being newly registered, beginning 1 
March, with its subsequent increase up to a rate equivalent to 5 
million ecu (at the present exchange rate--up to R10 billion), 
remains the most acute problem in the Russian banking 
sphere. 
  After a long silence the Association of Russian Banks has 
expressed its attitude toward this problem. A few days ago it 
sent a letter to the State Duma in which it essentially demands 
the repeal or the suspension of the operation of the pertinent 
Central Bank directive. 
  In the opinion of the association's board of management, 
although the need to increase the internal resources of the 
banks under conditions of rapid inflation is obvious, "this 
process should be gradual, taking into account the actual 
resources of the banks and the needs of the economy." Under the 
present specific conditions the raising of a charter capital of 
R2 billion is a task beyond one's strength. There are simply no 
such resources in the majority of oblasts, krays and cities. In 
this connection new banks will not be created in the next few 
years and part of those already in operation will be closed down. 
  And this given the fact that 27 oblasts and republics now 
have less than 10 banks each. Because of this each banking 
institution serves several rayons. For example, in Novgorod 
Oblast, which is made up of 22 rayons, there are only three 
banks and eight branches and in the 40 rayons of Kirov 
Oblast--seven banks and 17 branches. Naturally, in this case 
there can be no question of any competition in the banking 
sphere or of any quality of banking service. 
  As to the question of a further increase of charter capital, 
it also appears moot to the Association of Russian Banks. The 
fact is that there are now in Russia only 28 banks with a 
declared charter fund of more than R5 billion. And even for them 
bringing internal capital up to R10-12 billion is a rather 
complicated task.

<F P=106> [Article by Igor Karpenko, IZVESTIYA correspondent: "A Law </F>
for the Stock-Holder; the Economic Reforms and Millions of 
Citizens Await it"] 
  [Text] Up to this point there is no law on 
joint-stock companies in Russia. And every entrepreneur now 
operates under the threat of the court and penalties based on 
the legislation presently in force. First Deputy Chairman of the 
State Committee on the Administration of State Property Petr 
Mostovoy, one of the leading authors and elaborators of the law 
on joint-stock companies, has recounted to IZVESTIYA how the 
government intends to resolve these problems. 
  "The obvious criminalization of Russian business," says Petr 
Mostovoy, "is in many respects related to the major deficiencies 
in the legislation now currently in force. Precisely that is why 
many entrepreneurs and simply adventurists calmly make deals 
knowing beforehand that they will not be able to fulfill their 
conditions and that it is difficult to make them answer for this 
according to the law. On the other hand, the victims also well 
know that it is simpler for them to conduct an `investigation' 
with the use of a fire-arm than legal proceedings." 
  It is no secret that today we protect the rights of all 
participants in the economic turnover poorly. 
  During the years of Soviet power our Civil Code underwent 
such changes that today it is absolutely inadequate for economic 
and legal reality and many situations have proven to be 
practically altogether without regulation. The question of the 
legislative regulation of the activity of joint-stock companies 
is especially critical. The draft of a law on joint-stock 
companies has been prepared for a long time already and its 
elaboration has been delayed somewhat precisely because it has 
been necessary to coordinate its basic norms, formulations, and 
terminology with the draft of the Civil Code. Moreover, the 
authors of the draft legislation, well understanding its 
enormous importance for the activity of joint-stock companies, 
have refrained from the temptation to introduce its basic 
provisions by presidential edict. Without the approval of so 
important a legal document by the parliament it would be more 
complicated to insist on the need for and the obligatory nature 
of its use for all joint-stock companies. 
  Both the law on joint-stock companies and, in addition, 
draft 
bills on trading partnerships, state enterprises, non-commercial 
organizations, cooperatives and some others will be introduced 
together with the Civil Code for the consideration of the 
Federal Assembly. 
  These acts are vitally necessary. The fact is that even the 
legal sphere of the activity of state enterprises, which 
constitute so significant a share of economy, leaves much to be 
desired. Thus, the institution of "complete economic authority" 
as the legal basis for the activity of state enterprises has 
long since outlived itself. In the draft bill it is planned to 
transform state enterprises in two directions. Basically, they 
will be transformed also into joint-stock companies with a 
varying share of the property remaining with the state and even 
with a 100-percent share of state capital. 
  This is not simply a change of sign in P. Mostovoy's 
opinion. 
State enterprises as juridical bodies are thereby transferred 
into the category of active participants on the basis of the 
right of ownership. The possibility is created, incidentally, of 
recovering their debts with the use of a penalty on the property 
of such an enterprise. There also are many other positive 
features. The preconditions emerge for attracting non-state 
funds and investments into such joint-stock enterprises. 
  Another alternative for state enterprises is their 
conversion 
into "public (kazennyy)" enterprises, i.e., operating not on the 
basis of the right of ownership and economic authority, but on 
the basis of operational control. The state is the proprietor of 
such enterprises, similar in status to institutions. Today the 
first precedents have already been created. Such enterprises as 
a port administration, enterprises for air traffic control and 
the use of air space, a basin administration on rivers and a 
further entire series of structures have been converted to the 
status of institutions, but with definite opportunities in the 
sphere of economic activity. 
  What are the defects of our previous legislation? In the 
first place, norms ensuring the protection of the rights of the 
stock-holders are almost completely absent in this legislation. 
Norms which protect the minority of stock-holders from decisions 
taken by the majority to the detriment of their interests are 
lacking. In particular, those provisions which are common for 
world practice according to which stock-holders who possess if 
only ten percent of the shares have a right to convene a 
stock-holders meeting, to schedule an audit of the activity of a 
joint-stock company, to require a valuation of the shares 
belonging to them at a fair market price in the case of the 
reorganization or liquidation of the company, etc., etc. Such 
norms are present in the privatization legislation but they are 
absent in the general legislation for the country and for 
enterprises created outside the privatization process. 
  For example, the activity of closed type joint-stock 
companies is very poorly regulated. This is a sphere of purely 
entrepreneurial initiative. With us such companies cannot be 
created with the participation of state capital, only with the 
participation of foreign investors. So, regulation of their 
activity falls outside the sphere of privatization legislation. 
  The entire practice of the activity of these joint-stock 
companies shows that a stock-holder there is especially 
unprotected. Right up to the fact that the possibility of the 
compulsory confiscation of shares from certain stock-holders 
based on a decision of the general meeting is provided for in 
the founding documents of such joint-stock companies, which is 
complete nonsense. If any one of the members of such a company 
wishes to sell his shares, then he is obliged to sell them 
either to the company or to his favorite stock-holder at a price 
which is known to be unobjective. And there are no norms 
whatever protecting the stock-holder. 
  The majority of the norms which protect creditors are also 
absent in today's legislation. In particular the norms related 
to the obligations which ought to result if a joint-stock 
company undergoes reorganization, is liquidated, or the charter 
capital of the joint-stock company is decreased. Such mutual 
relations of a joint-stock company with a creditor are not 
regulated in Russia. And the only alternative remaining to 
creditors is to initiate bankruptcy proceedings. 
  As a matter of fact, Petr Mostovoy thinks, bankruptcy is not 
at all obligatory in the majority of real situations. If the 
appropriate norms were in effect in the general legislation, one 
should be able to regulate these disputes by other less painful 
methods. The courts before which applications concerning the 
bringing of a bankruptcy action come up don't know what to do 
with them, they haven't the practice, and there isn't an 
adequate normative base. The appropriate provisions have already 
been established in the draft bill on joint-stock companies. 
  Questions related to the issuance of shares and their 
distribution are regulated in greater detail in it. It is well 
known that joint-stock companies issued additional shares in 
order to obtain funds to cover debts, that dividends were paid 
to stock-holders through funds received from an issuance, and 
that these funds were used for regulating mutual relations with 
third parties, which is not to be tolerated. 
  What more new is there in the draft law on joint-stock 
companies? For example, norms regulating reorganization 
procedure: additions, mergers, divisions, separations. In 
today's legislation there are norms which concern only the 
merger of companies and they are present in one single 
document--in the provisional statute on holding companies. These 
norms have been treated in greater detail in the draft bill and 
have been extended to all types of reorganization. 
  Questions related to the rights of the possessors of 
privileged shares have also been entered in greater detail. In 
particular the range of situations when they acquire the right 
to vote at a general meeting of the stock-holders has been 
defined: if the joint-stock company does not fulfill its 
obligations with respect to them, does not pay dividends over a 
period of two years, etc. They retain such a voting right as 
long as the company does not settle with them completely. 
  If in the next few months the Federal Assembly will consider 
and adopt the Civil Code together with the law on the 
joint-stock company and the draft bills regulating the juridical 
relations of all the remaining participants in economic 
turnover, then, in Petr Mostovoy's opinion, Russia will secure a 
serious legislative base for the market economy and the sphere 
in which the state today is compelled to exercise its regulating 
functions will be drastically limited.

<F P=106> [Interview with A. Volgin, Chairman of the Moscow Public </F>
Committee for Stockholders' Rights, by reporter L. Lidrianov: 
"The Thorny Path of the Native Investor"] 
  [Text] It is no secret to anyone that man is the basis for 
all economic, social and political relations. In V. Dal's 
dictionary we read, "Man -- the individual, highest of earth's 
creatures, gifted with reason, free will and speech: a) carnal 
man -- hardly distinguished from the animal, in him the fitting 
spirit is hidden; b) natural man -- recognizes only the material 
and civil law, does not meditate on eternity, falls to 
temptation; c) spiritual man -- in good and truth because of his 
faith, his goal is eternity, conscience is his law and he 
withstands temptation. These levels of man can be achieved by 
man through his will." From the aforementioned an axiom can be 
formulated easily: The better man is, the better will he arrange 
life. The logical conclusion to what has been said is the 
following formula: we live badly because we ourselves are bad. 
However, the difficulty has to do not with this simple 
conclusion (even though this too is not easy) but with 
understanding what is good and what is bad. 
  A. Volgin, Chairman of the Moscow Public Committee for 
Stockholders' Rights, discusses today's everyday problems and 
the role of relations between people in the sphere of stock 
turnover with our reporter, L. Lidrianov. 
  [Volgin] As director of Adamant Financial Corporation and 
manager of two investment funds -- Derzhava and Radonezh, I, as 
no one else, experience the rigors and adversities of the 
Russian investor on a daily basis. In my opinion, most problems 
are related to serious violations of the rights of stockholders, 
which can be protected only through joint efforts. 
  I was able to organize a group of like-minded individuals 
from among representatives of investment funds, associations of 
privatized and private enterprises, associations of 
non-government pension funds and other organizations, and to 
unify them in a Public Committee for Stockholders' Rights. All 
of these people work professionally in the stock market, which 
is very important. We feel that such public intellectual 
centers, allowing everyone to move forward together in the area 
of improving laws and court practices, and increasing the 
knowledge of the population, should exist throughout the 
country. At the present time an enormous number of people are 
participating in the stock market (60 million stockholders and 
thousands of companies, enterprises, banks and investment 
funds). In practical terms it is possible to help each one only 
if an environment is created for honest business. Only by 
functioning in such an environment can we guarantee that the 
rights of the individual will be protected. 
  It is on this basis that we established the basic directions 
for our operations. 
  First, we wish to improve the legal system, and not only 
laws 
but normative acts as well. In this matter we wish to be 
completely professional, discussing not only the concept of the 
laws, but every letter and comma, and what impact they will have 
on the rights of particular participants in the stock market. 
After all, many things that may not appear to be very 
significant to public opinion actually seriously affect the 
rights of stockholders. Recently the Duma discussed in all 
earnestness the idea of increasing the tax rate from 0.3 to 3.0 
percent for stock operations. In patching the holes of an 
ever-expanding budget, we are often prepared to grasp at any 
means that turn up. Yet this measure may have enormous economic 
consequences. It will temporarily shut down the stockmarket and 
create hindrances on the path of moving capital from ineffective 
to effective spheres of the economy. All of this will result in 
a violation of the most important rights of the stockholder -- 
the right to sell his stock. I must say that in general, a tax 
on stock operations is unique. In Japan it was introduced only 
to combat the artificial stockmarket boom. But even under our 
conditions, in which the market is not at all developed and is 
characterized by a low liquidity, the purpose of introducing 
this tax is completely incomprehensible. This is only one 
example of how a question which does not appear to be directly 
related to the rights of stockholders in reality may affect them 
quite seriously. We are ready to participate professionally in 
discussing all such questions and in promoting the most 
important, in our opinion, point of view -- that of the man who 
has invested his money. 
  The second direction that is very important to us is 
education -- increasing the level of awareness of the 
population. It is difficult to defend a person if he has 
invested his money in some sort of doubtful enterprise. Despite 
the fact that they have been deceived thousands of times, our 
people continue to repeat previous mistakes with some sort of 
improbable stubbornness. For example, how many times have we 
talked about that notorious MMM? Articles have even appeared in 
the paper about it. Have you seen what is written on their 
stock? "The MMM closed joint stock company is the owner of ten 
stocks of the MMM open joint stock company." There is a seal and 
two signatures. There is no other information, no last names, 
and no registry number. What relationship a purchaser of this 
stock has to the MMM closed joint stock company is completely 
incomprehensible. But it is quite evident that if the rights of 
these people are violated not a single court will even examine 
the documents. Thus we have a flagrant example of man's 
stupidity, for which we cannot be responsible, of course. In my 
opinion the government also should not be responsible, otherwise 
we will never teach the people. After all, if you play 
"Lotto-million," you do not demand a return of your money if 
your ticket does not win. On the stockmarket, everyone wants to 
achieve the fabulous profits, but no one wishes to be 
responsible for decisions that have not been clearly thought 
out. The stockmarket is always risky, and one must think clearly 
before trusting anyone with one's money. 
  It is in the area of educating the Russian investor that the 
committee has been most active up until now. Over 100 
publications have been published and there have been radio and 
television spots devoted to explaining the basic principles of 
using the stockmarket. For example, we have explained many times 
that money should not be invested in a stock company if there is 
no knowledge of who manages it. Has anyone seen the manager of 
the Neft-Almaz-Invest firm, or members of its administrative 
council, or its chairman? Have they been on television, in the 
newspapers, at meetings of stockholders? After all, if the 
public does not know a single last name, if the representatives 
of a particular company are afraid to look people in the eye, 
one simply should not do business with such a company. Yet our 
people cannot seem to understand this, and "swallow" any 
advertisement. This is why the Committee for Stockholders' 
Rights will continue to steadfastly devote itself to educating 
people in this area while at the same time depending on the 
press, since a well-coordinated campaign on the part of the mass 
media could undoubtedly play a large positive role here. 
  The third important direction we will follow involves the 
collection and analysis of precedents for solving particular 
problems. Again, via the mass media we are prepared to discuss 
instances in which the rights of stockholders have been violated 
and how it was possible to successfully defend these rights. 
This has a very great effect on violators, who naturally would 
prefer to remain unknown. Of interest is a recent case involving 
Novomoskovsk's Novomoskovskbytkhim Joint Stock Company, which 
has among its stockholders the well-known American company, 
Proctor and Gamble, as well as Russian investors such as 
Alfa-Kapital and Derzhava investment funds. Thus, the American 
investor, with 15 percent of the stock and without having 
invested a single dollar as of yet, proposed to the joint stock 
company that it be given the right to veto any decisions that 
are made, even if they are passed by a majority of stockholders. 
Nowhere in the world, including in the U.S., do such practices 
exist. It is incomprehensible why in our market this company 
suddenly decided to attempt this innovation. With immediate 
action on our part we were able to block passage of such a rash 
decision which would have unequivocally violated the rights of 
native investors. 
  The next direction in the activities of the Public Committee 
for Stockholders' Rights is related to providing information 
services to large investors. In particular, we plan to establish 
ratings of regions based on investment attractiveness. We will 
use indicators such as the number of violations of stockholders' 
rights and the presence of a normative base in the region to 
defend such rights. Unfortunately, we now must often struggle 
with local authorities who indulge in protectionism with regard 
to homebred investment companies to the detriment of investors 
"from the outside." Moreover, we plan to become involved in 
making up lists of enterprises, all of the documents of which 
(charter, issuance prospectus) correspond completely to the 
existing laws on the rights of stockholders. 
  [Lidrianov] Doesn't Minfin [Ministry of Finance] carry out 
such work? 
  [Volgin] I do not know of any instance in which the finance 
ministry has demanded that changes be made in the charter of a 
particular joint stock company based on new laws, as required by 
the new State Privatization Program. Thus we will mention those 
joint stock companies that voluntarily alter their documentation 
to fully correspond to the requirements of the law. I think that 
with time this kind of approval by the Committee for 
Stockholders' Rights will be essential for both investors and 
joint stock companies. 
  [Lidrianov] You stated that the government should not become 
involved if the investor allowed himself to be deceived. Yet the 
recent incident involving Tekhnicheskiy Progress Joint Stock 
Company showed that government functionaries think differently. 
  [Volgin] This is a classic example of a government decision 
to compensate investors for losses based strictly on political 
gains. Moreover, the way this was done was fraught with many 
mistakes, which actually amounted to encouragement of the 
foolhardiness demonstrated by many people. From the very 
beginning of operations by Tekhnicheskiy Progress Joint Stock 
Company, we, then simply as directors of an investment fund, 
warned that fraud was clearly obvious. Compensating everything 
and everyone meant creating prerequisites for having such cases 
reoccur and for encouraging new fraud. 
  [Lidrianov] Have any lawsuits been initiated? 
  [Volgin] A lawsuit will begin now. But that is not the 
problem. These people and the money are no longer in the 
country. The fact is that this development of events was 
apparent 4 months before their disappearance. During this time, 
negotiations were carried out and possibilities for avoiding 
scandal were examined. As a result, there was a scandal anyway, 
and many more people suffered. I am afraid that the same thing 
can happen with some investment funds. After all, we know of no 
case of thorough revisions in the operations of any investment 
fund despite the fact that some of them should have interested 
competent organs long ago. 
  [Lidrianov] What advice could you give today to those 
stockholders who cannot obtain any information from their joint 
stock company because they simply cannot find it? 
  [Volgin] Here it is very complicated to give advice because 
no real instruments for proceeding exist. They can turn to the 
tax inspectorate or tax police. But in my opinion these two 
organizations are still very passive. If someone has promised a 
500-percent annual return this means that the budget should 
receive at least 250 percent, and for this reason a tax 
inspector's interest in this company should be aroused. But as 
of now this is not happening. In any case, right now I know of 
no case in which an advertising campaign has been halted because 
of the action of the tax police. 
  I could suggest turning to the office of the public 
prosecutor. It is also obligated to make sure that laws are 
adhered to, but as of now it does not note the majority of cases 
even though many violations have already been discovered in this 
sphere. 
  Of course in our country it is not only the rights of 
stockholders that are violated. But the rank and file find it 
more difficult to understand this sphere, and for this reason a 
particular level of professionalism is required of those who 
protect the rights of investors. 
  [Lidrianov] Thank you, Andrei Aleksandrovich, for the 
interesting discussion. It will clearly bring a great response 
from our readers. In conclusion I would like to turn to all 
those who, for the sake of their own advantage, have forgotten 
the moral principles that are the foundation of any flourishing 
society. What kind of society are you helping to build by 
deceiving your people? After all, you are a member of that 
society!

<F P=106> [Interview with Yuriy Petrov, head of the Russian Investment </F>
Corporation, by Aleksandr Yakushev, NEZAVISIMAYA GAZETA 
correspondent; date and place not given: "Yuriy Petrov is Ready 
to Work with Investment Resources; the State Share of Privatized 
Enterprises Comes Within his Disposal"] 
  [Text] 
  [Yakushev] The State Investment Corporation which you head 
is 
a year old. What are the results? 
  [Petrov] A year is not too great a period to build up a 
serious organization. We have obtained the money to create the 
charter fund with great delay and the total amount of the funds 
we have received comes to about 10 percent of that envisaged by 
the Russian Federation President's decree about forming the 
corporation. That is why, based on the actual amounts which we 
managed to nevertheless obtain with great difficulty, we did not 
set ourselves the goal of investing it in projects right away 
since we understood perfectly well that their implementation 
would not have been able to have had any substantial influence 
on the structual reorganization of the economy. That is why the 
main attention and efforts were concentrated on the working out 
of economic and legal mechanisms ensuring an inflow of domestic 
and foreign investments into the economy of Russia. Strictly 
speaking, precisely this goal was pursued also in the creation 
of the corporation. 
  [Yakushev] What sort of mechanism do you have in mind? 
  [Petrov] The question is one of creating an integral system 
capable of mobilizing and optimizing financial flows and of 
achieving the concentration of resources in the most important 
directions, of ensuring effective control and, what is the main 
thing, of protecting investments from risks. Probably not 
everybody knows, but based on the degree of political risk for 
the investor, Russia occupies 50th, and based on the degree of 
economic risk, 53rd place among 54 countries of the world. 
  We have done all the necessary work to inspire the 
confidence 
of foreign investors that their capital is protected. Literally 
a few days ago the Russian Investment Insurance Company 
(Rossiyskaya kompaniya po strakhovaniyu investitsiy) was 
registered abroad. Its assets have also been invested abroad. 
The goal of the company is to secure the insuring of the foreign 
investments from political risks (war, expropriation, currency 
inconvertibility, the alienation of property rights, etc.). As 
yet the company's charter capital is relatively small and is 
capable of ensuring the protection of investments in the amount 
of US $350-400 million. And this is no longer a little. 
Moreover, the organization of insurance will give rise to an 
"avalanche" effect and the example will indicate also Russia's 
concrete steps in creating real guarantees for Western 
investors. The most important world insurance companies have 
already expressed a readiness to associate themselves with our 
insurance fund. 
  We propose to insure the commercial risks of investors 
through our insurance company currently being established in the 
territory of Russia. 
  [Yakushev] What could you say about the structure of your 
organization and its associates? 
  [Petrov] From the very beginning we set a goal of taking on 
only the strictly necessary number of associates. That is why 
the entire central staff of the corporation numbers a little 
more than 40 persons. Most of them are highly skilled 
specialists. 
  Besides the central staff a number of subsidiary khozraschet 
enterprises, such as Gosinkor-trast, Gosinkor Torgovyy Dom, and 
Gosinkor Lotereya have been established. The regional 
representatives of the corporation are beginning to work more 
actively. We have been the founders of such financial structures 
as the inter-bank investment association Invest-kredit and the 
Entrepreneurship Development Bank. Gosinkor will become a 
powerful financial holding company in the future. 
  Expert appraisal and project financing groups have gradually 
been formed in the corporation. Work in training personnel for 
Russian institutions related to the investment process is 
expanding. About 2,000 projects have been certified and the data 
base is steadily being enlarged. The Partners of Russia 
investment fund has been created jointly with the OPIC (an 
American foreign private investment corporation). Moreover, we 
have paid in $5 million and issued insurance for $20 million. 
The total amount of the fund will come to about $100 million, 
which will permit the attraction of almost $1 billion in 
investments into the Russian economy. This is already quite 
decent. We are participating in the creation of several more 
such funds. 
  All these are the components of a single mechanism, without 
which one cannot efficiently carry on the investment process. 
  [Yakushev] Why wasn't the edict of the president of the 
Russian Federation about alloting you the necessary monetary 
funds carried out? 
  [Petrov] Because in the previous government there were 
people 
for whom a presidential edict was not a guide to action. Of 
course, one should also take the difficulties which the 
country's economy has faced into account. However, I think that 
the government's leaders should have looked ahead. There's no 
need to talk about this now. The main thing is that the 
corporation is standing firmly on its feet and the battles have 
only hardened us. 
  [Yakushev] Do you have an investment policy concept? 
  [Petrov] Yes, we have such a concept. In the very near 
future 
we intend to give a report on it to a meeting of the Commission 
on Day-to-Day Problems of the Government of Russia (Kommissiya 
po operativnym voprosam pravitelstva Rossii) which Vice Premier 
Oleg Soskovets heads. We expect that, taking into account the 
structures which have been formed and the experience that has 
been accumulated, we will be able to become a serious partner, 
or, more precisely, a mechanism of the government in conducting 
investment policy and improving the legislative base of the 
investment process. 
  It is my profound conviction that Gosinkor should become the 
mechanism for converting from a centralized administrative 
investment system to a market system relying on fundamentally 
new sources and utilizing the methods of the investment banks of 
the West, which have also provided the financial basis for the 
prosperity of the capitalistic economy. 
  Analysis of the investment readiness of our plants has 
revealed a paradoxical result--not a single facility is ready 
for correct and sound investment. From force of habit all state 
a need for money "from Moscow," and not one ponders over actual 
repayment and even survival. To give them money today is to 
simply mechanically continue free financing and to 
irretrieviably waste the latest budget funds on potential 
bankruptcy. That is why we set ourselves the goal not to delay 
the tragic outcome at the price of the latest money but to 
create a mechanism and conditions which will not tolerate, 
first, the continuation of cost-based financing, and, secondly, 
will really help an enterprise to switch over to the rules of 
market investment, to adapt itself and to survive under modern 
conditions. The fact is that there are not enough budget funds 
and even the market theory of investing regards centralized 
resources only as a component of the investment flow where the 
basic accent should be put on traditional sources--the funds of 
the population and of enterprises, pension, insurance and other 
funds, and foreign investors. 
  [Yakushev] What goals are you setting yourselves for next 
year? 
  [Petrov] Much depends on what resources will be given over 
to 
the State Investment Corporation for the fulfillment of its 
charter tasks. In the present case I mean the financial 
resources and property intended for filling up the corporation's 
charter fund, centralized capital investments, as well as the 
state shares of the stocks of privatized enterprises which, on 
the basis of agreements already achieved with the Russian 
Federation State Committee on the Administration of State 
Property and the Federal Property Fund, will be transferred to 
us in trust management or for sale at investment auctions. 
  On the whole the mechanism created by the corporation and 
the 
experience accumulated permits one in the shortest time possible 
to expand the attraction of investments along a broad front 
through insurance activity and to more efficiently manage 
centralized capital investments, having ensured their maximum 
use and a high return. 
  The creation of an investment-tender center, where, after 
the 
appropriate preparation, blocks of shares of privatized 
enterprises will be offered, will be an important direction. The 
stage of the practical implementation of an entire series of 
investment projects with the participation of both the 
corporation's internal capital funds and domestic and foreign 
capital will begin in the current year.

<F P=106> [Article by Dmitriy Matsnev, candidate of economic sciences, </F>
Institute of Economic Forecasting of the Russian Academy of 
Sciences: "Sovereignty of the Russian Regions: Political Myth or 
Economic Fact?"] 
  [Text] 
<H5>  Evaluation of Economic Independence </H5>
  The ominous symptoms of Russian collapse appeared about 1 
year ago, in early 1993. The problem of making the Russian 
regions sovereign did not arise out of nowhere; during the 
radical transformations being carried on in the country an 
objective trend toward weaker inter-regional links appeared. 
They were caused by the general, critical worsening in 
manageability of the country's economy, the drop in production, 
the liberalization of foreign economic activity, the increase in 
rates for transportation services, and the universal development 
of "barter economy." 
  The economic space of Russia is formed from significantly 
different regions which are distinguished by level of economic 
development, sectorial specialization, and natural-climatic 
conditions. At the same time these regions are strongly 
dependent on one another. For one, they are closely interlinked 
by deeply specialized high-tech production. For two, for a large 
majority of the regions the output produced in them can only 
find users in the domestic Russian market. During the prolonged 
period of joint development a certain social division of labor 
among regions and sectorial specialization of regions within the 
framework of a single Russian economic complex took shape. This 
led to the situation where a large share of the output in each 
region is being produced for these partners or received from 
them. In the late 1980s this proportion was at a level of 
roughly 23-30 percent, that is, from a quarter to a third of the 
output was produced for other regions and consumed as the result 
of import it from them. A further disruption of links among 
regions will inevitably intensify the drop in production, which 
in turn will inevitably lead to growth in social tension. 
  Science has the essential tool for modeling economic 
processes, which makes it possible to forecast deformation, 
weakening, and even the disintegration of links among the 
Russian regions and to assess the impact of changes in these 
links on local economies. A cycle of these modeling calculations 
for 11 consolidated Russian economic regions was made at INP RAN 
[Institute of National Economic Forecasting of the Russian 
Academy of Sciences]. The calculations showed that the decrease 
in domestic final product of a region is directly proportional 
to the degree of weakening of its external links. For each 
region the coefficient of this proportionality shows the 
magnitude of change in its final product (in percentage) for a 
one percent change in external links, that is, it shows how 
dependent the region is on its external links. If this 
coefficient is zero, the region is completely independent of 
external links. This means that its regional reproduction 
process is capable of being carried out on an autonomous, 
isolated, autarkic basis. If the coefficient of dependence of 
the region's economy on external links is equal to one, the 
region is completely dependent on external links and if they 
were fully broken the region would not be able to carry on the 
reproduction process. This fits regions with the most open 
economic systems. 
  As a result of the modeling calculations the following 
values 
were obtained for the coefficients of dependence of the 
economies of the Russian regions on their external links:

  A kind of "experimental" confirmation of our theoretical 
calculations is the fact that it is precisely in the most 
"independent" of the Russian regions, the Urals, where the 
Republic of Bashkortostan, which declared its sovereignty as 
early as 1990, and the Ural and South Ural Republics, which in 
July 1993 tried to emerge on the basis of Yekaterinburg and 
Chelyabinsk Oblasts of the Russian Federation respectively, are 
located. 
  The oil and gas workers and miners of the West Siberian 
region, who are next after the Ural Region in level of economic 
"independence," conduct themselves quite independently. The 
Republic of Tatarstan, the main constituent part of the Volga 
Region, acts with great confidence in dealings with Russian 
federal authorities--this is the third-ranked among the Russian 
regions in level of economic "independence." 
  So the less the economy of a region depends on external 
links, the higher the level of objective preconditions for its 
economic sovereignty. And vice versa. 
  What paths can the Russian regions take, and what awaits 
them 
if these preconditions become reality? 
<H5>  Possible Strategies </H5>
  Modeling the behavior of the Russian regions according to 
the 
strategies of their possible behavior produced the following 
results (see Table No 1 below).

  It can be seen from the table that realization of the 
strategy of autarky would have disastrous consequences for any 
of the Russian regions, and therefore none of them will take up 
this path on their own, of their own free will so to speak. At 
the same time, the weakening of links among regions makes the 
strategy of regional free trade objectively possible, above all 
for the Ural, West Siberian, and Volga regions. In the 
transition to this strategy they even experience a certain 
increase in internal final product, mainly from sale of the 
output of their oil and gas industry at world prices. For all 
the other regions the strategy of regional free trade appears to 
be a definite lesser evil than the strategy of autarky because 
the decline in their economies within the framework of one of 
the strategies will be fundamentally less than in the other.

  But not all of these regions will be able to carry out the 
strategy of regional free trade in reality. This is tied, first 
of all, to the correspondence between output exported from the 
Russian regions and the requirements of the world market, that 
is, with its competitiveness under world price conditions. For 
the Northern Region, where export of output from the timber 
industry and ferrous metallurgy predominates, and for the Far 
Eastern and East Siberian regions (export of output from timber 
industry and nonferrous metallurgy) these requirements and 
conditions are feasible in principle. Consideration must also be 
given to the traditional export orientations of the sectors 
themselves in these regions. The machine building output that 
dominates in the export of the Central, Volga-Vyatka, and 
Northwestern regions will hardly be able to become competitive 
under world market conditions in the near future. This also 
applies to the machine building, light, and food industry of the 
North Caucasian and Central Chernozem Regions. Therefore, five 
regions (Central, North Caucasian, Volga-Vyatka, Northwestern, 
and Central Chernozem) will lose the possibility of supplying 
themselves on an equivalent basis with energy media, 
construction materials (or raw materials to process them), and 
output from timber and wood processing industry from the other 
six Russian regions which, within a strategy of free trade, 
would be oriented primarily to the world market. For this reason 
the five old industrial regions of Russia will be doomed, 
against their will, to a strategy of regional autarky. As a 
result, within the unified Russian national economic complex two 
alternative strategies of behavior will begin to be realized by 
its constituent parts, which is shown in Table 1 by means of 
arrows pointing in the appropriate direction. This will 
inevitably lead to further weakening of links among the Russian 
regions. 
<H5>  Evaluation of the Consequences </H5>
  The consequences of realizing both strategies for the 
Russian 
regions will be extremely negative. The disastrous decline in 
production has already been discussed. However, the strategy of 
regional free trade will also be accompanied by extremely 
negative consequences for a number of regions. As the result of 
its implementation, agriculture and light and food industry, 
unable to withstand competition with the corresponding products 
in the world market, will cease to exist in the Ural and West 
Siberian regions. In the West Siberian region they will lose, in 
addition to these, the ferrous and nonferrous metallurgy, 
machine building, timber, wood processing, and building 
materials industries. In the Volga region light and food 
industry will be forced out of existence. 
  The table shows how this factor has caused a sharp decrease 
in the volume of aggregate product in these three regions. 
Because of the deep decrease in the level of integration in 
economic development in these three regions the coefficient of 
dependence of their economies on external links is rising 
sharply and will be equal to one, that is, they will become 
economic systems that are absolutely dependent on world economic 
links. This will mean a complete loss of their economic 
sovereignty because they will become resource appendages of the 
world market. At the same time, owing to the significant 
decrease in production volumes because of the elimination of 
whole groups of sectors in the West Siberian, Ural, and Volga 
regions, an equally significant rise in unemployment is 
inevitable--from 27 to roughly 60 percent of the total number of 
persons employed in material production there. This will 
inexorably lead to such an intensification of social tension in 
these regions that the slight economic advantage from 
realization of the strategy of regional free trade will be far 
outweighed by the social costs, above all the loss of social 
stability. 
  The consequences of a transition to the strategy of free 
trade will be entirely different for the Northern, East 
Siberian, and Far Eastern regions. In the first two regions the 
decline in material production will not exceed two percent. The 
Far Eastern region is somewhat of an exception; the decline in 
production there will be at the level of 11 percent (mainly 
because of a decrease in production volume in the food industry, 
construction, and agriculture). By contemporary measures such a 
decline is not disastrous, so one need not fear a tangible 
increase in unemployment in these three regions as a result of 
their transition to the regional free trade strategy. 
Realization of this strategy also will not have a significant 
impact on the level of these regions' economic dependence on 
external links. For all three regions this coefficient will 
decrease slightly: from 0.69 to 0.66 for the Northern Region, 
from 0.71 to 0.61 for the Far Eastern Region, and from 0.74 to 
0.72 for the East Siberian Region. 
  At the same time realization of the strategy of regional 
free 
trade will make it possible, using the opportunities of the 
world market, to sharply improve supply of food and light 
industry products to the population of these three regions and 
supply of fuel, metal, chemicals, and machinery and equipment to 
their production sectors. The situation with consumer goods will 
be especially critical. The proportion of import in consumption 
of light industry products in the Far Eastern and Northern 
regions exceeds 65 percent. The proportion of import in 
consumption of food industry output in the East Siberian Region 
is roughly 37 percent. These regions significantly exceed all 
other Russian regions for these indicators; in other words, they 
are too dependent on deliveries of food and light industry 
products (mainly from the Russian Central Zone and South). But 
forecasts made by the INP RAN of the development of these 
sectors show that light industry production for Russia as a 
whole will decrease by one-half in 1995 compared to 1990, while 
food industry production will decrease by more than one-third. 
Under these conditions it is hard to talk about normal supply of 
essential products to inhabitants of the Northern Region, who 
mostly live in extreme natural conditions. 
  It is even harder to solve the problem of supplying light 
and 
food industry output to inhabitants of the East Siberian and Far 
Eastern regions. The great remoteness of these regions, given 
liberalization of prices for energy media and the corresponding 
sharp increase in transportation charges, will inevitably create 
an economic barrier that hinders the economic links of the Far 
Eastern and East Siberian regions with the rest of Russia. 
Therefore one need have no doubt that realization by the Far 
Eastern, East Siberian, and Northern regions of an "open door" 
policy with the world community within the framework of the 
strategy of regional free trade will get the necessary support 
from a large majority of their populations. 
  Social stability in these regions may be a promising 
guarantee that they will receive essential investment from the 
world market. This will make it possible to solve one more of 
the most critical problems of the Far Eastern, East Siberian, 
and Northern regions. Their sectorial specialization is oriented 
to the extraction and primary processing of natural resources 
under harsh natural-climatic conditions. Throughout the world 
this kind of production has extremely high capital-output ratio 
and capital investment intensity. According to INP RAN 
forecasts, however, by 1995 the volume of capital investment in 
the Russian economy may decrease by more than one-half compared 
to 1990. This will inevitably force the Far Eastern, East 
Siberian, and Northern regions, before anyone else, to start 
looking for the vitally necessary investment in the world 
market, and this investment will be offered only on condition of 
a transition to the strategy of regional free trade. 
  The analysis permits us to conclude that the objective 
preconditions for economic sovereignty are minimal for five 
Russian regions in the Central Zone and South of European 
Russia--the Northwestern, Central, Volga-Vyatka, Central 
Chernozem, and North Caucasian regions. These regions have the 
greatest interest in preserving the integrity of the Russian 
economic space, because otherwise they are doomed to the 
strategy of regional autarky with its disastrous economic and 
social consequences. 
  The Ural, West Siberian, and Volga regions, who receive some 
economic benefit from possible realization of the strategy of 
regional free trade, have the objective preconditions for 
economic, and therefore also political, sovereignty. But 
vigorous implementation of a policy of achieving sovereignty 
will have negative social consequences in these regions. These 
regions will therefore be characterized by a "smoldering 
sovereignty" that is ready to flare up in "bright flames" every 
time there is a general deterioration of the socioeconomic 
situation in the country, because against this background the 
costs of the policy of achieving sovereignty will not be so 
notable, while the economic benefit will be particularly 
tangible. 
  Given preservation of the current situation in Russia, 
realization of the strategy of regional free trade, that is 
following a policy of economic sovereignty as a minimum, will, 
in our opinion, be the only possible way for the Northern, East 
Siberian, and especially the Far Eastern regions to survive. 
They have all the essential preconditions--economic, social, and 
geographic--to implement this strategy. This means that it will 
not be held up by political considerations. 
<H5>  The Path to Concord and Unity </H5>
  How can the disintegration of Russia be avoided? In looking 
for a way out of the situation that has developed we should 
consider first the real, historically established 
characteristics of the Russian economy. 
  The objective economic foundation of the equality of the 
different regions within Russia is interdependence and mutual 
complementarity in the framework of a unified reproduction 
process that is weakly linked with the world market. It 
presupposes equality of political and economic rights, 
conditions, and accountability of the different Russian regions 
within the framework of a single country. But the market to 
which the reforms being carried out in Russia is oriented never 
does anything but intensify the territorial differentiation of 
economic, and accordingly also political, space; in principle it 
cannot ensure political and economic "equality among subjects 
who are different." Therefore the political equality of subjects 
of the Federation which is proclaimed in the new Russian 
Constitution, not reinforced by economic equality among the 
regions, will in fact be illusory, and therefore federalism in 
Russia will be unstable and ineffective. 
  To overcome the contradiction between good political 
intentions and objective economic reality we must forego the 
orthodox principles of market fundamentalism, base ourselves on 
an understanding of the actual characteristics of Russian 
economic space, and prevent the transformation of the profound, 
historically established differences among the Russian regions 
into insoluble political conflicts among the corresponding 
subjects of the Russian Federation. While creating the necessary 
conditions for democratization of the political and economic 
life of Russia its economic system must differ in that the state 
should play a fundamentally greater economic role. In the 
specific situation of contemporary Russian reality this can be 
realized under the conception of inter-regional 
institutionalism. It presumes that state regulation of Russia's 
economic space in the interests of all Russian society is not 
limited to just budget-finance and credit aspects, but actively 
employs the methods of planned regulation. It is used to 
implement equal strategic roles for economically different but 
politically equal, in decision-making under the Constitution, 
subjects of the Federation in shaping, jointly with federal 
organs of state power, a unified system of basic socioeconomic 
goals of agreed-upon development of Russia's unified economic 
space in the interests of all its regions and establishing 
national economic, intersectorial, and inter-regional 
proportions in the Russian economy appropriate to these goals. 
Within the framework of this federal strategy the state 
institutions of the subjects of the Federation must work jointly 
to perform the coordinating function of ensuring purposeful 
agreement on direct contract links between suppliers and 
consumers of output in the different regions. The appearance of 
independently cooperating subjects of the Federation who are 
managing collectively in the Russian economic space, and bear 
mutual accountability for the results of their economic 
activity, and their coordinated joint activity toward planned 
regulation of the Russian economy make it possible to ensure 
equal rights, equal conditions, and equal accountability to 
enterprises located in significantly different Russian regions. 
In this way federal-regional planned regulation in the interests 
of the entire society is a means of realizing the principle of 
"equality among equals" not only in relation to the regions, but 
also in relation to all Russian enterprises. 
  With the functioning of such a system of economic activity 
the heterogeneity of the Russian economic space and the 
interdependence and mutual complementarity of its regions become 
crucial, objective preconditions for the integrity of Russia and 
create conditions for the political equality of the economically 
different subjects of the Federation. The country's political 
system, built on the foundation of such an economic system, will 
ensure a stable state arrangement for the new Russia and 
guarantee the unity of its economic space.

<F P=106> [Article by Mikhail Leontyev: "Intermediate Vice Premier"] </F>
  [Text] Aleksandr Shokhin's appointment to the post of vice 
premier can hardly introduce significant changes in the model, 
according to which the present unique Russian Government is 
being formed. Most likely, it can be regarded as an intermediate 
step in the correction of the balance of power inside the 
governing assembly of sectorial lobbyists. 
  Mr. Shokhin has recently spoken a great deal about 
transforming the Ministry of Economics into the "headquarters of 
reforms." However, his appointment to the vacant post of chief 
head of former reform is unlikely. It is not difficult to note 
that, as a result of changes in the political situation, 
Aleksandr Shokhin, one of the leaders of the temporary 
opposition election bloc PRES [Partiya Rossiyskogo Yedinstva i 
Soglasiya--Party of Russian Unity and Accord], has become one of 
the most persistent translators of the ideas of "selective 
structural policy" through moderate emission pumping. At the 
same time, Mr. Shokhin uses formulations of the type of 
"stagnation trap," in which he himself, according to experts' 
opinion, in no way can believe. 
  Perhaps Mr. Shokhin has already demonstrated that it is 
impossible to judge his present views by his past views and 
actions. However, the miraculous transformation of a 
"monetarist" into a banal "trapper" is not a sufficient basis 
for holding a key post in the government. 
  The point is that the existing balance of forces between 
representatives of sectorial lobbies was disrupted quite 
unexpectedly for participants in the high assembly. It was 
assumed that the premier quite efficiently lobbied for the fuel 
and energy complex, Mr. Soskovets not without the help of the 
Ministry of Defense lobbied for industry, and Comrade Zaveryukha 
extorted financing for his eternally hungry agrarians. And 
everyone was more or less satisfied. 
  The unforeseen happened. Serious people, in response to the 
"vile" monetarist reform, have fostered a system of nonpayments, 
which proceeds from the fact that in Russia everything, except 
goods, is for sale. Mild demand restrictions concentrated on the 
budget are the basis for such a system, which makes it possible 
"to unload" unsalable goods; speaking in Russian, to scorn 
effective demand if the budget pays for everything. 
  However, it turned out that not for everything. Quite 
unexpectedly Viktor Chernomyrdin, having broken away somewhat 
from the lobbyist team, began to exert pressure from above on 
the desired "mild restrictions." Problems not envisaged by 
participants arose inside the government. On the other hand, 
industrial lobbyists formally gained unique positions in Russian 
upper circles: the Ministry of Defense got hold of talented 
Andrey Kokoshin, chairman of the Duma Committee on Economic 
Reform, Sergey Glazyev was and remains an ardent advocate of 
goal-oriented financing for scientific research and experimental 
design work (it is clear to anyone where this work is performed 
in our country), and, in the end, metallurgist Oleg Soskovets, 
the only first vice premier, expanded his potential lobbyist 
interests to the scale of the domestic industry as a whole, 
including the military-industrial complex, which considers 
itself infringed upon. This was manifested in Mr. Soskovets' 
latest attack on the positions of the fuel and energy complex. 
Since agrarians do not need a special additional support owing 
to the parasitic way of life characteristic of them and the 
premier himself tries to distance himself as far as possible 
from the fuel and energy complex that gave rise to him, it would 
be natural to restore the balance in the government through the 
appointment, to counterbalance Soskovets, of a person from the 
fuel and energy complex, which, taking into consideration the 
nature of the government and the real role of the fuel and 
energy complex in the Russian economy, is more than natural. Mr. 
Shokhin in no way is suitable for this role, because no one 
needs a second Soskovets in the government. Even Mr. Soskovets 
himself. 
  Most likely, however, for tactical considerations the 
premier 
is not yet ready to take this natural step, fearing accusations 
of corporative engagement. Therefore, obviously, with Aleksandr 
Shokhin's appointment an intermediate action was carried out. 
With regard to the personality of the reappointed vice-premier 
himself, Mr. Shokhin has recently uttered very good words about 
Russia and the foreign policy it needs and very bad words about 
his former colleagues, Messrs. Gaydar and Fedorov. Aleksandr 
Nikolayevich's excessive zeal in flinging mud at his former 
partner indicates that Mr. Shokhin is a vulnerable and, in his 
own way, a decent person. Sensing the extreme awkwardness of the 
situation, he tries to erect, first of all, for himself some 
structures, which enable him to consider himself such a person. 
The concentration in the ministry entrusted to him of people 
from the Gaydar team, whom Mr. Shokhin cannot permit himself not 
to shelter, confirms this. It only remains to add that a reverse 
transformation of a "trapper" into a normal person during the 
next turn of the wind is extremely difficult. This is already an 
irreversible process, like the loss of professional virginity.

<F P=106> [Article by Anatoliy Grukalenko: "I Am Chasing After a </F>
Locomotive, Chained to it by Handcuffs"; foreword by Eduard 
Mokhorov, correspondent of RABOCHAYA TRIBUNA, Bryansk] 
  [Text] Almost 7 years ago our newspaper (at that time 
SOTSIALISTICHESKAYA INDUSTRIYA) published "Notes of a 
Businessman." Anatoliy Nikolayevich Grukalenko, a young 
entrepreneur, was their author. At that time (1987) the concept 
of "private initiative" was almost abusive. Grukalenko's frank 
account of some secrets of the Uyut Cooperative's commercial 
activity produced a shock in society. 
  Fellow-citizens brought up in the spirit of their times saw 
in the activity of the beginner cooperative owner an 
encroachment on the economic and moral principles of socialism 
and an insult to public morality. Grukalenko, I want to remind 
readers of this, bought at the state price a large batch of 
sports shirts, which were lying on the counter, improved the 
unmarketable goods, putting a striking design on them, and very 
quickly, without any trouble, sold all the items on the kolkhoz 
market--at a price triple that of the state. 
  Anatoliy Nikolayevich received a verdict from enraged 
readers: He is a speculator and a swindler. One high-ranking 
party official was outraged more than others. True, by the irony 
of fate this custodian of principles subsequently became an 
exchange dealer. 
  After "Notes of a Businessman" A. Grukalenko appeared in the 
pages of RABOCHAYA TRIBUNA more than once. I read his notes and 
involuntarily compare many of his plans, thoughts, and hopes of 
those days with today. How naive all of us were in the sacred 
belief in the force of private initiative during those first 
years of Gorbachev's perestroyka! And how many honest, noble 
impulses were buried during the subsequent era of cynical 
political mongering, money-grubbing, and large-scale shock 
therapy. 
  Having made money on sports shirts, the cooperative owner 
gave the entire profit, down to the last kopeck, for charitable 
purposes. Grukalenko conducted the experiment with sports shirts 
by no means for the sake of personal gain, but only in order to 
force the local sewing factory, which, according to the plan, 
produced on a large-scale goods that no one needed, to operate 
differently. 
  I confess that today "Notes of a Businessman" evoke in me 
sometimes nostalgic feelings about the lost illusions and 
sometimes also a smile. I recall the enthusiasm with which he 
dealt with the problem of the processing of dumped industrial 
waste. He established a semiprimitive enterprise and engaged in 
the manufacture of jewelry and all sorts of other trinkets. He 
promised readers of RABOCHAYA TRIBUNA: "In a few years we will 
fill counters with goods that are not even available in the 
West." 
  A very self-confident young man--you and I would say today. 
In fact, in 1987 the beginner entrepreneur boldly undertook many 
risky projects--he believed in his star. He did not want to know 
anything about Marxist initial capital accumulation. One day in 
the morning he came out to the street. He saw under his feet a 
kopeck dropped by someone. He picked it up and it dawned upon 
him: "Here is my capital. I will go to the bank, open my 
personal account, and this kopeck will be my first deposit. You 
are laughing? Never mind, in 2 or 3 years this kopeck will grow 
into millions. I will have my own business and will open my own 
factories and stores. I will become a rich man." 
  I carefully followed our debutant entrepreneur. Yes, 
according to many external criteria, Anatoliy Nikolayevich 
turned out to be a successful businessman. He tested himself in 
many fields. He was one of the first to become a broker on the 
commodity-stock exchange. Then he was co-founder of almost the 
first provincial private bank in the country. Together with 
other enthusiasts he established the All-Russian Union of 
Cooperative Owners and then the Congress of Business Circles and 
the Union of Entrepreneurs. He founded a network of small 
enterprises. He participated in the establishment of the 
Niva-Kapital Check Investment Fund. 
  The kopeck once found on the street grew into rubles and 
turned into quite a sizable initial capital. Then there was 
privatization--breath-taking opportunities for an enterprising 
person. Grukalenko decided not to miss his chance. Having 
overtaken his competitors, he leased a barbershop with the right 
of a subsequent buyout. He acquired rights to a bakery. He 
leased a store temporarily and opened his own office. Finally, 
he got the opportunity to become the owner of a large restaurant. 
  But today, not without a sigh, Grukalenko says: "Then people 
not only listened to our opinion, but also took it into 
consideration." 
  An entire era lies between "then" and "today." Russia got to 
know inflation and economic ruin. Millions of people were left 
out in the cold and lost their secure future, their savings, and 
sometimes even their homeland. 
  It seems, however, that the universal impoverishment has not 
affected our hero. He looks at the future boldly and confidently 
and his accumulations, being constantly in motion according to 
the well-known formula "commodity-money-commodity," are not 
devalued in the abyss of inflation, but, conversely, increase. 
According to all criteria, Grukalenko is precisely the person on 
whom reformer Gaydar counted and whom he cherished in words. 
Yes, incidentally, Anatoliy Nikolayevich established the 
Foundation for Support for Reforms and the President in his 
native Bryansk approximately 1 year ago. 
  We have not seen each other for a long time. Not only our 
paths, but also our views of many things in this life, have 
parted. Therefore, I was somewhat surprised when Grukalenko 
himself telephoned me a few days ago. 
  "I would like to tell you a little about my life," he said 
straight to the point. 
  We met. In my opinion, his story will be interesting to 
readers of RABOCHAYA TRIBUNA. I think that it will also be of 
interest to politicians who failed, but understood nothing. 
<H8>  * * * </H8>
  In 1992, when privatization began, I decided to invest my 
savings in a barbershop and a bakery. Having paid a sizable sum, 
I acquired the right to lease these facilities. The starting 
price of the bakery was 23,000 rubles. However, it cost me 
100-fold more, because there were many competitors at the 
auction. And so, I bought a scale, a counter, shelves, and a 
signboard for 2.2 million rubles. The store itself did not 
become my property, but the right to trade there was sold to me. 
  Then an opportunity arose to acquire a restaurant not on a 
leasing basis, but for my ownership. This cost me more than 3 
million rubles. 
  A restaurant is a large enterprise. We service about 2,000 
children with school lunches. There are also ordinary guests. 
However, in order that this public catering establishment may 
bring not only losses, but also income, I decided to open an 
evening coffee house there. 
  It seemed to me that, having finally become a real estate 
owner, I would acquire complete independence and would have an 
interesting and profitable business. I recall that in 1987 Artem 
Tarasov hurled a popular phrase, which the entire country 
repeated after him: "Our Soviet system has come to the point 
where I, as a cooperative owner, cannot be dismissed from my job 
even by the country's president." 
  I can confirm: According to the law, neither President 
Yeltsin nor the local governor can deprive me of the rights of 
an owner. Everything seems to be clear as far as the president 
is concerned. However, there are forces, which are not even 
under his control. 
  Alas, I did not become an independent owner with full 
rights, 
as this was assumed at one time. As soon as a well-to-do person 
acquires an enterprise for ownership, he himself immediately 
becomes the object of solicitations and often of persecution on 
the part of a large, well-organized, greedy corporation of 
officials. At all times this mob of inspecting, controlling, and 
supervising officials lived rather well and fed on facilities 
under state ownership. It became so intertwined with these 
facilities and got so accustomed to considering them almost its 
own personal profitable property that even under privatization 
conditions it did not intend to part with the unwritten rights 
and privileges. 
  Before me my restaurant functioned in very good order for 
more than 20 years, but only after it became private property, 
suddenly, it was discovered that as a facility it operated with 
gross deviations from existing rules. Almost on the first day I 
was told that, according to instructions of the 
sanitary-epidemiological inspectorate, fire safety, and tax and 
other services and according to decisions and instructions of 
municipal authorities, this public catering enterprise must be 
closed immediately. It turned out that partitions, windows, 
walls, and doors were not built properly. Electric wiring was 
not good enough and the roof was not made from the right 
material. 
  I, the owner, was very quickly convinced that an official 
from any department (there are a dozen such departments) at any 
moment and for any reason could issue an order to close my 
enterprise and even to alienate it as an object of ownership. I, 
as an owner and employer, could not even appeal the decision of 
a certain official in court. And if I tried to seek the truth, 
next time even more devastating, new fines would be imposed on 
me. 
  The sanitary epidemiologist's assistant makes a decision to 
close the restaurant. This lady acts according to the 
instruction. Previously, when the enterprise belonged to the 
state, for some reason she did not pay attention to this 
instruction. And it was of interest to no one that during the 
stoppage of the enterprise closed owing to an official's 
arbitrary rule the owner incurred huge financial losses on the 
maintenance of the building and on municipal and other services. 
Having no income, he paid wages and taxes. 
  Following the first wave of inspectors the tax service pays 
a 
visit. It checks the activity of the enterprise during the 
previous year, when the restaurant was still municipal property. 
The previous director and accountant have long been dismissed 
and the new administration and owner are just beginning to get 
to the heart of the matter. However, no one is worried about 
this. In reports of more than 1 year's standing the official 
detects a mistake in the writing off of transport costs and 
immediately a fine of 600,000 rubles is imposed on me. I try to 
explain that I have nothing to do with the activity of the 
previous administration, because 1 year ago I was not the owner 
of this property. The inspector goes into indescribable 
raptures: "Ah, it turns out that you are a private enterprise. 
Then, in addition to the fine, you will have to pay another 
200,000." 
  After several days a new commission came and discovered that 
not long before privatization restaurant workers received a 
bonus of 3,000 rubles each, but deductions into the pension fund 
were not made from this sum. A fine of half a million rubles was 
imposed on me, the owner. After a few days I was invited to the 
rayon administrative commission. I went with the hope: They will 
understand and will revoke the unjust decision. However, they 
summoned me and the restaurant director for a totally different 
purpose. Both of us were handed fine notices on account of the 
same sanitary state. I and the director were fined the 
equivalent of 20 salaries, that is, 290,000 each. "But I have 
already been fined half a million," I tried to explain myself. 
In response I heard: "The oblast authority fined you, but the 
rayon budget must also be replenished." 
  In the first 2 months alone the restaurant brought me fines 
amounting to 3 million. Not to mention the fact that I bought a 
hopelessly unprofitable facility and realized that at first I 
would have to invest a great deal of money in this production 
unit with the income obtained from other enterprises. I planned 
to make major repairs and to renovate equipment and the 
interior. But the excessive, at times openly fiscal, fines 
wrecked all plans. 
  I realize that both the rayon and the city budget are 
supported by these very fines and without these proceeds there 
will be nothing with which to pay wages and bonuses to the 
officials themselves. In Russia their apparatus is growing to 
the size of a malignant tumor. Previously, deductions from the 
profit of plants and factories were the sources of replenishment 
of the budget. Today, however, state and privatized enterprises 
curtail production. Consequently, the private entrepreneur can 
be the source of replenishment of the budget. And so, they begin 
to rob our brother blind. 
  Our ruin is of absolutely no interest to anyone. My accounts 
are in the records. For the second month I cannot pay wages to 
my workers. However, this, too, is of no interest to officials. 
  In addition to the army of supervising bureaucrats, we are 
being overpowered by municipal service enterprises, as well as 
all kinds of firms and offices, without the knowledge of which 
the entrepreneur does not dare to take a step. These are 
monopolists setting enslaving prices of services, which at times 
the real estate owner, possibly, did not suspect before. For 
example, one enterprise for the entire city has the right to 
service cash registers and to issue a certificate concerning 
their installation. This sphere of activity is a gold mine. If a 
bakery does not have a cash register, the first tax inspector 
will impose a fine of 3 million on the owner. Taking advantage 
of the opportunity, monopolists inflate prices of cash registers 
to 600,000 rubles. Another several hundreds of thousands must be 
paid for a certificate for the installation of a register. They 
will not even come to make the installation for you, but you 
will have to pay in full for the certificate. Whereas previously 
my barbershop brought at least some income, now it must work for 
half a year for the cash register alone. 
  Of course, monopolists live in grand style at our expense. 
Their workers receive bigger salaries than those of ministers 
and almost every month make "business trips" to foreign health 
resorts. But I, in order to make both ends meet, am beginning to 
reduce work places and to lower people's wages. In my restaurant 
people earn only from 16,000 to 37,000. Moreover, my personal 
income, despite the fact that I work 14 to 18 hours daily, have 
no days off, and have not had a leave since 1987, hardly totals 
00,000 [as published] rubles. If we are to believe official 
statistics, this is much less than the average wages throughout 
Russia. 
  At one time, having embarked on private entrepreneurship, I 
set for myself the goal of becoming a proprietor, an owner 
independent of the state and society. Was it realized? Formally, 
the goal, seemingly has been reached, but, in fact, I do not 
feel that I am an owner or a free person. 
  Seemingly, privatization has been carried out in our 
country. 
Seemingly, private enterprise has finally appeared. In our 
country, however, the official bureaucratic state apparatus, not 
people from the "middle" class, who with their labor and 
enterprise have accumulated and saved up some capital, has 
become the true, real proprietor and owner of everything that is 
called real estate. As a rule, officials' actions are not 
subject to an appeal in court. 
  Not only the state budget is being replenished at the 
expense 
of such business people like I. We might as well admit, everyone 
wants to live and officials go away from inspections by no means 
with empty bags. This is customary. From the experience of many 
entrepreneurs, my acquaintances, I know: There are many forms of 
hidden extortion. Everything seems like some ritual sanctified 
by the traditions of Russian hospitality. Victims do not protest 
requisitions. They are even grateful to those that take them. 
However, the takers themselves, in order that they may not be 
suspected of self-interest, having taken, drunk, eaten, and 
carried them away, are not ashamed to write a negative report 
and to exact a fine: The pike is in the sea in order to keep the 
crucian awake. 
  The law reads that the entrepreneur himself is responsible 
for his activity and, consequently, has the right to 
independently establish the procedure and conditions of work at 
his enterprise. However, here, too, I, as the owner, am tied 
hand and foot by instructions, orders, and the official's 
personal benevolence and mood. 
  In order to open an evening coffee house in my restaurant, I 
wasted a month on all kinds of formal agreements. As it turned 
out, officials have the right to impose their terms on me: How I 
should work, what staff I should have, and in what I can and 
cannot trade. All the rules of the game, including the recording 
and reporting procedure, change almost every week. 
  Next, let us take the commitment to lessees, which 
guarantees 
the right to buy out an enterprise within 1 year. A year passed, 
but instructions about the buyout procedure did not arrive. In 
the meantime rents rose significantly. Entrepreneurs, not 
through their fault, cannot become owners of leased enterprises. 
It is advantageous for officials to maltreat us. We, nominal 
owners, are in permanent bondage to them. 
  Nor did the party nomenklatura, which during these stormy 
years displayed a surprising capacity for mimicry, lose its 
positions. As soon as the party lost its power, they appeared at 
the exchange. When the exchange ceased to be a source of income, 
everyone moved to banks, to the tax police, to the pension fund, 
and to other soft jobs. 
  I look back at past years. I did not take a single kopeck 
from the state, but conscientiously replenished the treasury, 
paying taxes. I have created about 50 work places and each of my 
workers supports a pensioner. Moreover, together we support more 
than one highly paid official, who pokes fun at us. 
  However, I am tired of fighting a system, which has quickly 
established itself on the wreckage of the old society, has 
already managed to utterly ruin the people, and now is also 
getting to me. There is one prospect before me: I will reduce 
work places and am already beginning to curtail business. At any 
moment I can be declared bankrupt and everything that I have 
acquired can be taken away from me. 
  Will other stronger and more prosperous people replace me? 
Yes, there are such people. I know that these people are not 
burdened by my concerns about how to make ends meet. Those that 
take away abroad tons and cubic meters of the riches of Russian 
land do not know my problems. Perhaps they are Russia's true 
masters?

<F P=106> [Article by Nikolay Podlipskiy: "The Spring Sowing Is </F>
Beginning in the White House"] 
  [Text] The allocation of money to Russian agriculture 
has always been a political question and not an economic one. 
However, as the results of the Commission for Operational 
Management meeting held yesterday testify, the poor coordination 
of the work of the appropriate departments is leading to even 
those decisions, whose adoption served as an occasion for 
government resignations, not being implemented. 
  The government's examination of questions concerning 
preparations for the spring sowing is just as traditional and 
inevitable as the greeting of the new year. The ritual during 
the examination of these questions has not changed for years -- 
the representatives of the agrarians complain about the acute 
shortage of fuel (this year, almost twofold less than last year 
has been prepared), tractors (62,000 fewer), seeds, and -- what 
is the main thing -- money. In accordance with the government's 
decree adopted in January for financing Russian agriculture, 
approximately 5 trillion rubles should be allotted for the 
spring sowing. However, only about 800 billion rubles had been 
provided by 1 March. In connection with this, the meeting 
participants recalled last year with great warmth. Then, the 
majority of fuel and mineral fertilizer deliveries were carried 
out without any mandatory prepayments by order of the prime 
minister (as a result of this, the agrarians still owe mineral 
fertilizer producers 100 billion rubles). Nevertheless, in the 
words of Vice Premier Aleksandr Zaveryukh, it is possible that 
the second part of the money -- almost 1.3 trillion rubles -- 
will begin to arrive in the accounts of the agrarians this week. 
Moreover, he expects the repayment of the debts of agroproduct 
consumers to amount to 2 trillion rubles; true, the hopes among 
the agrarians for its repayment are rather weak -- probably 
because they themselves are not noted for strict financial 
discipline: Of the credits supplied last year, they returned 
only 25 percent (another 60 percent, or 1.5 trillion rubles of 
credits, was postponed to this year). 
  Yesterday, the members of the commission did not confine 
themselves only to "seasonal work": One can view the discussion 
of the Federal Energy Commission question as an element in the 
strategic planning of the government's activity. Traditionally, 
this is a weak spot in Viktor Chernomyrdin's Cabinet. Not only 
the fact that Russian industrialists consider the existing 
tariffs (the main subject of the Federal Energy Commission's 
activity) extremely high but also the fact that the 
inter-relationship mechanism between the Federal Economic 
Commission and the producers of electrical energy can be a model 
for developing a mechanism to regulate the activity of natural 
and state monopolies, in general, explain the economic 
significance of this question. In this connection, the 
discussion about the commission's personnel composition 
(Aleksandr Shokhin was appointed chairman) and functions, which 
was begun by Yuriy Shafranik, minister of fuel and energy, but 
immediately suppressed by the presiding Oleg Soskovets, is 
extremely symptomatic. Oleg Soskovets' desire to reduce the 
influence of the Ministry of Fuel and Energy on the decisions 
adopted by a state (and not public, as now) commission is 
completely justified -- otherwise, the present situation in the 
pricing of electrical energy, where the interests of the power 
workers and not those of the industrialists have paramount 
importance, could be reproduced even with the new statute for 
the commission. Moreover, Shokhin, who is more loyal to the 
first vice-premier, along with developing a concept for 
controlling energy prices, "will not forget" the question of 
favorable rates for individual enterprises in metallurgy and 
transport. 
  The third question on the agenda of yesterday's meeting was 
increasing the volume of export quotas for 1994. For more 
details about this, see the article on this same page.

<F P=106> [Article by P. Shcherbakov: "The Sowing Is Approaching and </F>
the Reorganizers Again Have an Itch"] 
  [Text] Why do politicians and reformers of different 
stripes prefer to perplex the peasants and disrupt their 
fortunes exactly in the spring and, without fail, before the 
sowing? You will recall that both collectivization and the 
reforming of the kolkhozes and sovkhozes in 1992 were quite 
suited to those times. Seemingly, counting on the fact that the 
land would remain a strong umbilical cord, the peasant would go 
to the field just the same, summoned by a primordial instinct 
during the passionate springtime no matter what happened. 
Politics and the reformers' capers are not for him at this time. 
The analytical center of the Russian Federation president's 
administration recently prepared a memorandum on the final 
elimination of kolkhozes, sovkhozes and even newly established 
joint-stock companies before the start of the spring sowing. The 
memorandum was sent to all Russia's regions and, one must say, 
caused much commotion. 
  In response to this memorandum and also the campaign of lies 
and slander unleashed by the mass information media in regards 
to the Russian peasantry, which is being accused of almost all 
the economic misfortunes, the Agrarian Party of Russia faction 
in the State Duma issued a statement on 15 February. This 
document provides a well-grounded rebuff, in particular, to the 
leaders of the Russia's Choice union who think that the peasants 
are receiving excessive financial infusions from the state. In 
their opinion, it is this that is causing the present inflation. 
  However, let us nevertheless examine just how generously the 
state is helping the village. As is known, the Russian 
Federation Government's decree, which was adopted 23 February 
concerning the economic conditions for the functioning of the 
agroindustrial complex during 1994, allocates 5 trillion rubles 
during the first half of the year; during January-March, that 
is, during the spring sowing -- only 1.3 trillion rubles. 
Meanwhile, specialists have calculated that rural commodity 
producers should spend 1.2 trillion rubles for fuel, lubricants 
and mineral fertilizer alone prior to the sowing. This leaves 
only 100 billion for everything else. However, 24 percent of the 
tractors, 27 percent of the plows and 28 percent of the sowing 
machines have still not been repaired. Moreover, in the words of 
V. Shcherbak, the Russian Federation's first deputy minister for 
agriculture and food, even if all the equipment manages to be 
put into the drive, the present pool of machinery will not cope 
with the sowing. 
  This means new equipment is required. It is standing ready 
in 
factory yards. You see, however, one must pay for it. No one 
gives the peasant anything on credit, you know. They only permit 
themselves to take from him and not pay for the products. For 
example, the state still owes the rural commodity producers 600 
billion rubles for the grain delivered in the fall. Let us point 
out that no one is planning to adjust the fall calculation for 
inflation. Meanwhile, prices grew threefold-fourfold during this 
time. Incidentally, credits are being issued to the village at 
213 percent interest according to that same government decree. 
Thus, who is subsidizing whom: the state -- the village, or the 
village -- the state? We call your attention to the fact that 
March is already ending and a considerable portion of the 
allocated sums has not gotten to the village. 
  Last week, a meeting of the Russian Federation Government's 
Commission for Operational Matters was held under the 
chairmanship of O. Soskovets, first deputy of the government, 
during which urgent measures to prepare for and carry out the 
spring sowing were discussed. During it, Vice-Premier A. 
Zaveryukh said right out that a portion of the monetary and 
preferential credits allocated to the village are walking about 
Moscow, replenishing the super-incomes of commercial banks and 
that the Russian Federation's Ministry of Finance "cannot" catch 
anyone. 
  Incidentally, the presentations of the directors of the 
ministries, departments and enterprises and of the bankers cited 
quite a few cases of irresponsibility and clear procrastination. 
However, none of them mentioned the specific names of guilty 
persons or hinted at where they could be found. O. Soskovets, 
who presided, repeatedly interrupted the speakers with a demand 
to personify the criticism; however, everyone with surprising 
stubbornness recouped themselves using nameless "cases." 
  When closing the meeting, O. Soskovets completely rejected 
the prepared draft of the decree and demanded that it be 
completely done over again within two days, clearly formulating 
an effective plan of action for all ministries and departments 
connected with the sowing and that control over the document's 
implementation, especially the part on personal responsibility 
for allocating the credits as designated and on time, be 
toughened.

<F P=106> [Article by Andrey Sizov: "Agriculture Can Only Rely Upon </F>
The Weather"] 
  [Text] By order of FINANSOVYYE IZVESTIYA [Financial News], 
Andrey Sizov analyzes the production of industrial products for 
agriculture. 
  In 1993 there was an acceleration in the rate of reduction 
in 
the production of industrial products for agriculture. This 
applied to the production of mineral fertilizer and plant 
protection agents as well as to a majority of the various types 
of agricultural equipment. Moreover, the decline in these 
branches has continued since the middle of the 1980's (see Table 
1).

  Agricultural machine building: a crisis of the monopolists. 
Since autumn of last year, the production of agricultural 
equipment has declined rapidly, mainly as a result of a sharp 
decrease in demand. Many farms, as a result of untimely state 
payments for products delivered, have been forced to decline 
purchases of new agricultural machines. In particular, this has 
had an effect on enterprises which occupy a monopolistic 
position in agricultural machine building and which produce 
expensive and low quality products. Thus, in December and 
January the production of flax harvesting combines was halted 
completely at the Bezhetskselmash Plant, Russia's only producer 
of these machines. In December of last year, not one 
potato-harvesting combine was produced by the Ryazan Combine 
Plant, the only producer of such machines. Rostselmash and the 
Kirov Plant are tolerating an increasing number of stoppages in 
their operations. As a result, only 14 grain combines and 2,116 
tractors were produced in January of this year, compared to 
2,500 and 9,300 respectively in January 1993. 
  Russia is commencing its spring field operations with the 
smallest pool of agricultural machines and the lowest level of 
agricultural equipment readiness since 1986. Notwithstanding the 
sharp decline in the production and sale of agricultural 
equipment, the number of repaired grain combines and tractors 
fell last year by 40-41 percent and potato-harvesting combines 
-- by almost two thirds, since the production of spare parts is 
also declining rapidly. As a result, there has been an increase 
in the rate at which the pool of agricultural machines is 
declining in size. Overall, during the period from 1986 to 1993, 
the tractor pool decreased by 185,000 units, or by 13 percent, 
and that for grain combines -- by 145,000 (by 29 percent). 
Moreover, according to data supplied by Roskomstat, by early 
February one out of every four tractors and trucks and one third 
of the plows, sowing machines and cultivators were in a state of 
disrepair, compared to 15-20 percent on this same date at the 
beginning of the 1990's. 
  Mineral fertilizer: the acquisition of mineral 
fertilizer in agriculture is still declining more rapidly than 
its production. This is associated with the continuing and 
relatively high level of nitrogen and potassium fertilizer 
exports over the past two years. As a result, the deliveries to 
and accordingly the consumption by farms of mineral fertilizer 
are declining more rapidly than its production. According to 
preliminary data, from 1991 to 1993 the consumption of mineral 
fertilizer per hectare of arable land declined by a factor of 
2.5 (see Table 2).

*In a 
calculation 
for 100% 
nutrients 


  The decline in mineral fertilizer consumption is combined 
with reductions in applications of organic fertilizer (a decline 
of 15 percent in 1993) and lime-containing materials (down 18 
percent). This is lower by a factor of almost 2.5 than the 
consumption level called for in the state all-round program for 
improving soil fertility in Russia, as adopted in late 1992. 
  The significance for agricultural production in 1994: a 
reduction in the areas under crops and possibly a further 
reduction in cropping power. It is clear that under the 
conditions imposed by an increasing shortage of logistical 
resources this spring, it may not be possible to compensate for 
the undersowing of winter crops, which amounted to 20 percent, 
including winter wheat -- 12 percent. Moreover, the increasing 
shortage of agricultural machines and their low level of 
readiness for field work, combined with a considerable 
deterioration in farm support in the form of fuel and 
lubricating materials, will obviously produce a situation in 
which the areas set aside for spring crops will also decline 
compared to last year. 
  The hope that the reduction in crop areas may be partially 
compensated by an increase in cropping power is extremely 
unreal. The rapid reduction in mineral and organic fertilizer 
consumption will lead to a decline in soil fertility. In point 
of fact, agricultural production in recent years has been 
carried out to the detriment of the land's natural potential and 
in the absence of land restoration. Agricultural production is 
becoming more vulnerable to changing weather conditions and more 
unstable and difficult to forecast.

<F P=106> [Article by A. Postnikov, corresponding member of </F>
Rosselkhozakademiya and A. Kondratenko, chief specialist of 
Glavkhimzashchita, Minselkhozprod of Russia: "Tactics in the Use 
of Fertilizer"] 
  [Text] Snow in Yevdokiya (14 March) -- for a fine harvest. 
National signs undergo the test of time and, as a rule, are 
justified. Truly, the March snow adds moisture to the ground and 
ensures that the plants have moisture during the first months of 
growth. It is unfortunate that full use will not be made of this 
gift of nature: a nutrient shortage in the soil over a periof of 
three years has defined the existence of the crops for six 
months. 
  The situation could be saved by mineral fertilizer, but the 
amount accumulated for the spring field work is less by a factor 
of eight than that which the farms had during the so-called 
stagnant years. In late February, the government of Russia 
allocated special purpose credits and 30-percent subsidies for 
the acquisition of mineral fertilizer and yet it is doubtful if 
this will save the situation. 
  Therefore, special importance is being attached to managing 
our fertilizer resources in an efficient manner so as to realize 
a maximum return from them. The undersowing of winter crops, 
unfertilized fallow fields and late fall plowed fields and a 
large volume of spring plowing work -- all of these factors 
demand the introduction of corrections into the plans for 
fertilizer use in 1994. 
  Winter grain crops. Since autumn, many farms have 
not had an opportunity to enrich the fields with nutrients. Even 
farms in Krasnodar Kray sowed more than one half of their winter 
crops without fertilizer. The moisture supplies in the 1-meter 
layer of soil are higher than normal in practically all areas 
and this will ensure normal plant development during the first 
two months of growth. But even the small supplies of nitrogen 
have been washed out of the surface soil by the autumn rainfall 
and will be unavailable for plant nourishment in the early 
spring. 
  According to data supplied by the agrochemical service, the 
winter grain crops in practically all areas are in need of a 
nitrogen fertilizer top dressing. The planning and research 
centers of the agrochemical service, at the request of the farms 
and private farmers, are conducting plant diagnoses and the 
plant protection stations -- phyto-sanitary inspections of the 
crops and issuing recommendations for the use of fertilizer and 
pesticides. 
  Weak winter crops, and there are many of them in the 
southern 
regions, should be given a top dressing using higher dosages of 
nitrogen -- 45-60 kilograms per hectare. This will intensify the 
tillering and increase the plant stand density. On the left bank 
of the Volga, where a summer droght is possible, the nitrogen 
dosages should ideally be reduced to 20 kilograms per hectare. 
  Intensive crops require a root dressing using nitrogen and 
complex fertilizers, with application to the ground being 
carried out using grain drills. The tilling of mature soil 
should be carried out along the drill rows. In the process, the 
plow itself will find the inter-row spacing -- the top dressing 
is combined with loosening of the soil. 
  We recommend the extensive use of tank mixtures of 
fertilizers, pesticides and plant growth regulators. In addition 
to making it possible to utilize aviation and ground equipment 
more effectively, this will also lower expenditures for toxic 
chemicals per unit of area so treated. In the absence of 
fungicides for preventing fungus diseases, solutions of 
potassium chloride and ZhKU can also be used in the tank 
mixtures. This simple agrotechnical method will also make it 
possible to strengthen the straw and to reduce lodging to a 
certain degree. 
  A high probability of lodging in winter wheat and rye is 
forecast for the central chernozem region, Ulyanovsk and 
Orenburg oblasts and for Tataria and Bashkiria. The rayon 
associations of "Selkhozshimiya" must find supplies of campozan 
and tura. According to our data, they are available in various 
areas. 
  Last year, a top dressing was applied to practically all of 
the winter crops in the Tatarstan and Mariy El republics, in 
Krasnodar Kray and in Belgorod, Ulyanovsk, Ryazan, Tversk and a 
number of other oblasts. Despite equal opportunities, less than 
one half of the crops in Rostov, Samara, Penza and Nizhegorod 
oblasts were given a top dressing and this can only be explained 
by the unsatisfactory work performed by specialists attached to 
the agronomic and agrochemical service. 
  Field work in southern Russia is being carried out at a 
maximum tempo. More than one half of the crops in the Kuban 
region have already been given a top dressing. The first 
aircraft have appeared above the fields in the central chernozem 
and central Volga regions. More than 600 aircraft have been 
prepared for applying top dressings. However, agreements for 
carrying out aviation chemical work have been concluded for only 
two million hectares, or one fourth of the requirement. 
  The Belgorod "Selkhozkhimiya" Association, for example, 
reached an agreement with supplier plants for a shipment of 
ammonium nitrate with no pre-payment for proper storage. As a 
result, the oblast's farms were fully supplied with nitrogen for 
applying a top dressing to their winter grains and perennial 
grasses. The possibility exists in many regions of exchanging 
agricultural products for fertilizer and pesticides. 
  Certainly, given the present price for grain, fertilizer and 
aviation chemical work, only an increase in yield can compensate 
for the expenses incurred. But it can be stated with confidence 
that each ruble invested in a top dressing produces a return of 
two rubles' worth of additional product. 
  Spring crops. A great amount of attention should 
be devoted to the start-up fertilizer used in drill rows during 
sowing. This method can produce a maximum effect with minimal 
expenditures. In the case of spring plowing, and the volumes of 
such work have increased considerably, the plants will 
experience a shortage of nitrogen in the spring, especially when 
a large amount of culmiferous residue is added to the soil. Thus 
it is best to add all round fertilizer together with the seed -- 
each granule containing nitrogen and phosphorus. A mandatory 
agrotechnical rule prevails for the Volga region, the southern 
Ural area and Siberia -- drill row fertilization, with 
phosphorus, of spring wheat plantings on fallow fields. 
Phosphorus fertilizer helps the plants to take root better and, 
by accelerating growth, enables them to withstand the effects of 
drought conditions. 
  In the spring, an attempt should be made to avoid extensive 
fertilizer applications with light tilling, since such placement 
leads to vigorous weed growth, with no materials being available 
to deal with them. The weeds become strong competitors against 
cultivated plants for the utilization of moisture and nutrients. 
  This year the local fertilizing of row crops should be 
combined with top dressings during the growing season. This 
method can be used very well with loosening of the soil and with 
combating weeds. Last year, one out of every four hectares of 
sugar beets in Voronezh, Tambov and Penza oblasts was not 
fertilized. At that time, the beets in the mentioned regions did 
not enjoy a "sweet" life and thus it should come as no surprise 
to learn that their productivity declined by 30 percent compared 
to the average annual figure for the 1986-1990 period. 
  Fertilization in behalf of sunflowers should be discussed 
separately. It is difficult to exaggerate the importance of this 
crop in solving the food problem. Why then is it viewed as a 
stepchild? As a rule, it is consigned to last place in a crop 
rotation plan and thus there can be no discussion regarding the 
residual effect of nutrients. Last year, 15 kilograms of 
fertilizer were applied per hectare of sunflower planting in 
Tambov Oblast, 10 kilograms in Penza and Samara and five 
kilograms per hectare in Orenburg Oblast. Generally speaking, 
such fertilization was overlooked in Saratov Oblast. And here 
they obtained 4.5 quintals of oil-bearing seed per hectare, or 
two times less than the average amount for Russia. 
  Farmyard manure and compost remain the principal fertilizers 
for potatoes and vegetables. Last year, throughout Russia on the 
whole, organic fertilizer was applied to less than one half of 
the potato-growing area and only to one out of every six 
hectares of vegetable crop. Farms in Tula, Voronezh, Volgograd, 
Kurgan, Novosibirsk and Amur oblasts were unable to procure 
enough farmyard manure for this purpose. Certainly, if a potato 
and vegetable yield of 80-100 quintals or less per hectare is 
considered normal, then it is possible to manage with the soil's 
natural fertility. 
  This year, the best periods for transporting organic 
fertilizer for winter crop purposes have already elapsed. Owing 
to an absence of requests from the farms, the mechanized 
detachments of "Selkhozkhimiya" were forced to release machine 
operators on unpaid vacation time or the latter had to seek work 
on the side, including in neighboring oblasts. Over a period of 
two months, two times less organic fertilizer was delivered to 
the fields than during the same period for last year. Thus we 
recommend the use of farmyard manure for vegetables and potatoes 
and also in farm crop rotation plans. Applications of low 
dosages of fresh unprepared farmyard manure in field crop 
rotation plans must also be eliminated and it must not be 
removed from manure piles by bulldozers and toothless drag 
harrows, since this leads to strong contamination of the crops, 
lodging and irregular ripening and also to an excessive 
accumulation of nitrates in the products. 
  The fertilization of irrigated crops is deserving of special 
attention. Indeed, all irrigation expenses are justified only 
when guaranteed high yields are obtained from these lands, 
regardless of weather conditions. There are approximately 
400,000 hectares of irrigated land in Saratov Oblast, the 
fertilization of which requires 80,000-90,000 tonnes of mineral 
fertilizer in active agent. Meanwhile, the farmers in Saratov 
Oblast received only 15,000 tonnes last year for all of their 
land -- both irrigated and non-irrigated. It comes as no 
surprise to learn that the productivity of an irrigated hectare 
turned out to be three times lower than the figure planned. Nor 
is the situation any better in Volgograd, Penza and Omsk 
oblasts, in the Altay Kray or in the republics of Dagestan and 
Kalmykia.

<F P=106> [Interview with Ivan Kivelidi, leader of the Party of Free </F>
Labor, by Yelena Dikun, OBSHCHAYA GAZETA columnist; date and 
place not given: "The `Cook's Children' are Setting Their Own 
Table"] 
  [Text] Recently a number of well-known businessmen 
who do not shun politics have decided to set up a "Russian 
Business Roundtable." Kivelidi's Party of Free Labor, Volskiy's 
Russian Union of Industrialists and Entrepreneurs, Zatulin's 
"Entrepreneurs for a New Russia" Association, and Borovoy's 
Party of Economic Freedom have sat down at the new "table." It 
is planned to hold a founding congress in May, for participation 
in which already more than 5,000 applications have been handed 
in. OBSHCHAYA GAZETA columnist Yelena Dikun has met with 
"Roundtable" initiator Ivan Kivelidi. 
  [Dikun] The "organization bureau" of your new association is 
made up of people who until recently did not especially regard 
each other with favor. What suddenly made you forget about 
differences? 
  [Kivelidi] At one time we all began together, then already 
each one tried to completely subordinate the matter to himself, 
to his own ambitions. I don't think that in the future we will 
succeed in completely ridding ourselves of this, but 
nevertheless now we understand we won't achieve anything one by 
one. All the entrepreneurial associations failed at the 
elections. Only individual entrepreneurs by reason of majority 
districts or those who, like Zatulin, "leaned against" some 
party got through. This was an instructive lesson for us. The 
political consciousness of the entrepreneurs finally has 
attained an understanding of the need to unite. The 
entrepreneurs, as Konstantin Zatulin puts it, don't move in 
formation since this presupposes an alignment in order of size 
and clarifications of who is higher, who is greater, who is 
richer but, nevertheless, we are not a crowd. And in a position 
to jointly insist on common interests. 
  The economy cannot develop further along the path on which 
it 
is now going--socialist or post-communist. The government is 
forced to take a new formation into account. If it does not 
intend to do this, then our critical mass already permits us to 
resort to acts of civil disobedience. For example, the strike of 
the commercial banks on the day of the funeral of the chairman 
of Agroprombank, Likhachev, killed "on order," passed seemingly 
imperceptibly; however, it caused extreme agitation in the 
government. If later they will treat us like "the cook's 
children," we are ready to repeat the strike, moreover no longer 
for a single day. Given the present non-payments crisis, this 
will bring the situation to a critical point in which the 
entrepreneurs themselves are not interested. However, if the 
authorities don't take us into account, then we have a right not 
to take them into account. 
  [Dikun] Usually businessmen loosen their purse-strings for 
marginally utilitarian policy, for the creation of a lobbying 
system. 
  [Kivelidi] We don't hide that the "Russian Business 
Roundtable" is a suprapolitical lobbying structure. 
Suprapolitical in the sense that each should rise above his own 
personal and political preferences in order to lobby for common 
interests. Lobbying is flourishing today in our country all the 
same, but it is the lobbying of narrow oligarchic groupings, 
which I would call by the simple Russian word "blat" [pull, 
protection, influence]. 
  For example, today the government elicits $1.5 billion from 
the International Monetary Fund by begging while every oil- and 
gas-producing enterprise has unrestricted money in foreign 
accounts significantly exceeding this amount. This is not 
entrepreneurial money but state money; however, for some reason 
it doesn't return home. Why? It's no secret that the prime 
minister openly protects the oil and gas industry and that most 
favored nation treatment has been created for it. Although it is 
not a budgetary sector it does not belong to the 
poverty-stricken; on the contrary, it yields great profit. 
  [Dikun] Ought one understand you that there won't be a place 
for representatives of the oil and gas complex at the "Russian 
Business Roundtable"? In general, according to what criteria do 
you accept into your company? 
  [Kivelidi] We are open for all public and political 
organizations expressing the interests of entrepreneurship. As 
regards the big oil and gas "magnates," consulations with them 
are now underway. In particular with representatives of the 
Russian fuel and energy complex and of Minatommash [Ministry of 
Atomic Machine Building]. Moreover, we didn't initiate this 
process. The Federation of Commodity Producers, which Yuriy 
Skokov heads, has expressed a desire to affiliate with us. 
  [Dikun] Don't you fear that such a powerful leader as Skokov 
is using you in the interests of his own political career? 
  [Kivelidi] I know Yuriy Vladimirovich as a clever and tough 
politician who, in my view, has quite good prospects. However, 
there are enough strong personalities at our "table" so that 
Skokov will be one of them. Incidentally, after we began 
consultations with Skokov, I, for my part, have felt a certain 
estrangement on the part of the government. This can be taken as 
evidence of the fact that Yuriy Vladimirovich is a truly serious 
person. 
  [Dikun] Ivan Kharlampiyevich, you are chairman of the 
Council 
for the Development of Entrepreneurship under the Russian 
Federation Council of Ministers. It's clear that you have great 
ties in the government. Do they help you to deal with business? 
  [Kivelidi] Today the Entrepreneurship Council is an orphan. 
If previously, when Vladimir Shumeyko supervised and helped it, 
we gathered, worked, and succeeded in doing many minor things, 
for example, in protecting specific entrepreneurs from the 
arbitrariness of local authorities, now the impression is 
developing that no one needs this Council. Besides, it is naive 
to set one's hopes on some kind of favor from "the upper crust." 
I'll cite only one example of such "favor." Before the elections 
the president promised to allot 25 billion rubles to the Fund 
for the support of entrepreneurship. This is a drop in the 
ocean. However, in fact they scraped up only R8 billion with 
difficulty. But even that, as a result of secret manipulations, 
ended up in the Antimonopoly committee for some reason. From 
there it got into a bank by a closed tender which offered it to 
enterprises at a commercial interest rate. 
  The government accuses the entrepreneurs of not developing 
industry but at the same time itself does everything possible to 
impede it. I am more inclined to production. We produce rather 
many different products, for example, television sets. However, 
we have been forced to reduce amounts and here and there to 
generally curtail production because of a tax policy which 
simply smothers us in its embraces. 
  If one is to be honest, we have already become tired of 
feeling the economic models written by theoreticians on our 
backs. As we have already determined, they undergo changes 
already in the course of being written. In my view practical 
activity can yield greater results. The proposals of people of 
business precisely also constitute part of the "Entry into 
Power" plan drawn up by the "Roundtable." 
  [Dikun] Does this plan include a demand for the immediate 
replacement of the government and the accession of entrepreneurs 
to key posts in the executive power? 
  [Kivelidi] In speaking of accession to power, we mean the 
transformation of the state mechanism and the complete rejection 
of the monopolistic-totalitarian system which is alive as 
before. The usual change of government while retaining the 
existing order doesn't suit us. That is why I have regarded the 
departure of Yegor Gaydar and Boris Fedorov from the cabinet of 
ministers without any especial sorrow. They had only role 
functions; they hardly could change anything fundamentally. 
  In its present role (ipostas) it suits the government to 
remain the largest owner and entrepreneur and to regulate 
relations between the remaining entrepreneurs on the basis of 
the laws which it itself promulgates. It turns out that one 
businessman, in the person of the state, gives directions to 
other businessmen on how to conduct themselves. Moreover, not 
with respect to it--it is separate--but among each other. This 
is illegitimate in my view. 
  We no longer want to convince these people since they can't 
imagine another state. It is easier to simply accede to power 
and to change everything. The question, of course, is not one of 
a coup but of gradual entry, for example, into such a temporary 
organ that the State Duma is. For this, certain businessmen will 
have to forgo their own vital concerns.

<F P=106> [Interview with Lyudmila Stepanovna Vartazarova, chairman of </F>
the Socialist Workers' Party, and A. Tikhonov, general director 
of the Interural Joint Stock Company and chairman of the 
Consolidation Party, by Nataliya Kuzina: "Is the Director Now 
Lord to the Worker? Or What Is He?"] 
  [Text] Call them whatever you wish -- managers, owners, 
enterprise directors -- but Russia already has representatives 
of both capital and hired labor. Many are irritated by this. 
Some are already calling for expropriation. It is just those who 
are willing to built social partnerships that remain fairly few 
in number. 
  We propose at least dialogue as a start, with participants 
expressing the interests of these new classes. Thus, we have L. 
Vartazarova, chairman of the Socialist Workers' Party, and A. 
Tikhonov, general director of the Interural Joint Stock Company 
and chairman of the Consolidation Party. 
  [Kuzina] More and more often people are demanding not 
corrections of government policy but change. And the question 
that everyone has avoided keeps coming up nonetheless: Was it 
possible for us, without socialist traditions, to force our way 
into the market? 
  L. Vartazarova: 
  "We should not force our way anywhere at all. But changes 
were necessary. We cannot deny that in recent years much that is 
positive has appeared. Thus, enterprising, active people have 
had the opportunity to realize their capabilities more fully. 
Government divestment and the appearance of enterprises with 
various forms of ownership -- the country needs all of this. But 
current privatization rules and tax and credit policies have 
provided prospects for development only for speculation capital, 
and the redistribution of property is taking place to the 
advantage of a new nomenclature. 
  "The Socialist Workers' Party supports market reform, 
economic effectiveness and social justice. Today we can and must 
find a synthesis of socialist and liberal values. 
  "If liberal values such as freedom and democracy were to be 
combined with justice, solidarity and equal opportunity, a 
completely new alloy would be produced which would not be 
characterized by traditional socialist and capitalist concepts. 
This is the foundation that will enable us to move toward a new 
model of civilization." 
  [Kuzina] Unfortunately, we cannot retrieve opportunities 
that 
we have let pass. We are at the frightening stage of initial 
accumulation of capital. Is there a place here for theory? 
  L. Vartazarova: 
  "The question is really this: I am looking for justification 
for doing nothing or I am looking for opportunities to do 
something. If politicians think about the people they will 
search for opportunities to realize this synthesis." 
  A. Tikhonov: 
  "There will be no positive changes in reform here as long as 
one strata of people is involved. After all, it is not the basic 
mass of the population that has become the experimental field. 
Entrepreneurs are removed from influencing the economy in the 
same way. We have something to propose for the country's normal 
development. 
  "I emphasize the word normal because we cannot ignore the 
interests of ordinary people. As a practician, I know very well 
that we could have avoided the barbaric capitalism of the first 
years. All forms of property could have been activated. The 
positive qualities of socialism, that collective feeling, could 
have been relied on for support." 
  [Kuzina] Why do you speak of the feeling of the collective? 
After all, we are facing the problem of creating a market 
psychology. 
  A. Tikhonov: 
  "Our reformers decided how this was to be done: turn people 
out onto the street and then all market mechanisms would 
immediately become operational. They would not. In the West one 
could actually fire some of the workers, thereby tightening up 
the enterprise, and it would begin to function better. But we 
lived under socialism. 
  "Or, for example, previously I also thought that money could 
solve all problems. One must add money and like a machine the 
NTR [Scientific Technical Revolution] would be activated 
immediately. And what happened...In my enterprise I have the 
opportunity to sharply increase wages if people demonstrate 
initiative. But they do not. New people come in. The result is 
the same. 
  "This is difficult to discuss. But this is the essence of 
the 
tragedy -- we come from a socialist society in which initiative 
was punishable. Our other problem is that we like extremes. No 
matter how our money experts masquerade as Westerns, our real 
national character is to cut the raw wound and to keep cutting 
to the end. And now we really have the forcible detachment of a 
significant portion of the people from market reform. The 
alternative would have been the path that Lyudmila Stepanovna 
speaks of -- creating a moderate program and, supporting each 
other, moving forward in measured steps. You would find that the 
psychology would then also change gradually." 
  [Kuzina] Lyudmila Stepanovna, are there tendencies that 
alarm 
you in the behavior of our entrepreneurs? 
  L. Vartazarova: 
  "Yes, there are. For example, directors allocate millions 
for 
their salaries. They also `dump' responsibility for `social 
services' on municipalities. As a result there are no vacation 
tickets for workers, no summer camps for schoolchildren and no 
nursery schools. However, I must say that in many cases 
enterprises are forced to act this way because of our 
government's radical tax policy. 
  "Enterprises do not have adequate assets to support 
production, let alone to maintain the social sphere. 
Fortunately, until recently directors and entrepreneurs managed 
as they could so as not to put people out onto the street. After 
all, most of them were raised in the `old school' of having 
responsibility for people. But what will happen next? 
  "Right now I am more concerned about the tendencies in 
government policies. With all the talk about coming unemployment 
why are no preparations being made? Where are the new jobs? 
Where is the system of retraining and requalification?" 
  [Kuzina] An interesting situation is developing: the 
socialist understands the problems of the entrepreneur and 
criticizes the government. What should the worker, who one day 
may be thrown out onto the street, do? 
  L. Vartazarova: 
  "He must learn to defend his rights. Previously, in a 
socialist state this was not required. In addition, the plant 
director was under strict controls. Today the gap between the 
labor collective and the corps of directors keeps growing. If a 
mass stoppage of enterprises begins it will result in a social 
explosion. Its first `victims' will probably be the directors of 
these enterprises as well as the owners of commercial bureaus. 
The latter have naturally been the `enemy' for a long time. 
  "Trade unions also have no real experience in protecting the 
interests of workers since during the entire Soviet period their 
main task was to distribute social benefits. Workers themselves 
must immediately learn the entire arsenal of methods to protect 
their own rights. Right now people are more badly off each year 
and they cannot seem to organize themselves and combine their 
efforts. While people are unorganized they are easily 
manipulated. There is one solution - to unify along social 
groups, according to professional interests. Representatives of 
labor collectives and trade unions must sit down at the 
negotiating table with entrepreneurs and directors. They must 
develop joint demands and present them to the government." 
  A. Tikhonov: 
  "Incidentally, the party of which I am head is not called 
the 
`consolidation' party without reason. Its membership includes 
both entrepreneurs and workers. No one interferes with the other 
because the main idea of the party is to consider the interests 
of all levels of society." 
  [Kuzina] "To consider the interests" -- this is not at all 
an 
altruistic concept. It will demand some financial sacrifices 
from you as a property owner. 
  A. Tikhonov: 
  "Your question reminds me of a historical example. We all 
know that Morozov and Mamoyatov helped the revolution and after 
its victory were left emptyhanded. Gorkiy explained to them that 
that is the people's truth. 
  "Personally I would not like a repetition of this. But the 
main problem is not who must sacrifice how much, but the precise 
delimitation of who does what, who is responsible for what, what 
he is paid and what he pays others. Laws determine all of this. 
It is the duty of the citizen to carry them out. 
  "As for entrepreneurs, despite taxes and the complexities of 
production the majority of directors of private and state 
enterprises are not abandoning the problem of the workers. They 
sympathize with workers completely." 
  L. Vartazarova: 
  "It seems to me that the further success of relations 
between 
workers and entrepreneurs will depend on adhering to tradition. 
Russia followed the philosophy of indifference to profits. 
Property was always looked upon as a privilege. The entrepreneur 
had to pay society for this privilege by showing concern for the 
poor." 
  [Kuzina] No matter how you look at it, the entrepreneur will 
have to open his purse strings. But there is another path, along 
which an attempt is made to "tame" the main spokesmen for the 
interests of workers. Incidentally, the idea that we need 
"leftist" leaders was clearly heard immediately after the events 
of 3-4 October. 
  A. Tikhonov: 
  "Personally, I do not share such ideas. But let us examine 
them in principle...Our society is `leftist' as a whole. It is 
no accident that many communists were elected to the state duma. 
But besides them there are many leftists in parliament. For 
example, there is a large contingent of independent deputies. I 
studied their composition. They are also basically `leftists'. 
  "So it will not be possible to `tame' everyone. And why do 
this; if they are leftists this is not so bad. I am familiar 
with the program of the Socialist Workers' Party. It is not 
opposed to a multi-level economy with various forms of property. 
If the government shifts slightly to the left I am sure that the 
entrepreneur will not be strangled. 
  "At the same time I know very well what communists are and 
what they are capable of if they are organized. But the extreme 
`right' is also capable of extremes. This is why we do not need 
extremes. Society is multifaceted. Let everything exist. But we 
need a `center' as a civilized solution to the country's crisis. 
A. Volskiy and A. Vladislavlev worked very hard on this. Despite 
political competition, they were always centrists and expressed 
moderate and reasonable views." 
  [Kuzina] The voting block that elected these people did not 
accumulate the necessary number of votes. Incidentally, your 
party and the party that is represented by Lyudmila Stepanovna 
also did not win in the elections. Don't you think that the time 
for compromise is running out? And that a pre-revolutionary 
situation is developing in the country? 
  A. Tikhonov: 
  "The failures of centrist forces in the elections resulted 
from organizational problems to a large degree. Of course, it is 
necessary to take them into consideration and to analyze them. 
But this does not mean that centrists do not have a future. I 
also do not agree that there is a pre-revolutionary condition in 
the country. The reverse is probably more true - one senses that 
the population is tired of all conflict. The people have a great 
need for harmony. This is what they expect from politicians." 
  L. Vartazarova: 
  "Whether there is revolution or not, right now many experts 
feel that in April a social explosion is possible. It is our 
common task not to allow this to happen. Right now, when the 
country is disintegrating, I do not at all care who sits next to 
me at the negotiating table - the entrepreneur or the Marxist. 
We must all make haste. It is not the time to look for the ways 
in which we differ. National harmony is not rhetoric. It is a 
condition for the survival of Russia as a country."

<F P=106> [Interview with Russian Federation Minister of Labor </F>
Gennadiy Melikyan by Galina Valyuzhenich; place and date not 
given: "It Is Better To Pay Salaries In... Teapots: Back Pay 
Owed in Russia Amounts To More Than 2.1 Trillion Rubles"] 
  [Text] Imagine this situation: On payday you do not 
get your pay. (Imagined?) And the next month, too. And another 
month. (Difficult?) One-third of Russia's population, however, 
do not have to strain their imaginations. For them, this is 
certainly not a hypothetical situation. 
  Interesting: What would Russian Federation Minister of 
Labor Gennadiy Melikyan do if he found himself in this 
situation? So we asked him this question. 
  [Melikyan] It all depends where I would be working. If at an 
enterprise, first and foremost I would try to put pressure on 
its administration. All state enterprises are now independent. 
  Each employee signs a labor contract with the 
administration, 
which specifies the terms of paying wages. So please take it 
first to your own bosses. Of course, the situation is different 
everywhere, but it does frequently happen that wages are not 
paid, while enterprises have foreign currency accounts or own 
shares of large banks. Sell them and pay your employees. They 
are crying that there is no money, and the next thing you see is 
the directors getting themselves foreign-made cars and even... 
aircraft. Which means that some do have money. But the 
management is sitting on it, trying to "make it grow." Such a 
situation may be seen not only at industrial state enterprises. 
Directors of science institutes or institutions of higher 
learning frequently behave this way. They rent out a building, 
for instance, putting the profit in a foreign currency account, 
while instructors go without pay for months. 
  The easiest (and most lucrative) way is to direct the wrath 
of discontented people toward the government. Although, of 
course, its fault cannot be denied, either. Wages are not being 
paid (or are partially paid) at almost 40,000 enterprises. Which 
means that some mechanisms of the economic system are not 
working. 
  [Valyuzhenich] Gennadiy Georgiyevich, labor remuneration is 
guaranteed by labor laws, which so far have not been repealed. 
Why is nobody held responsible for violation of the law? While 
holding back pay for two or three months, does it not occur to 
anyone, for instance, to index it in keeping with price rises? 
  [Melikyan] There is no law that says that back pay should be 
indexed. For not paying wages on time, however, the managers of 
some enterprises may be held responsible and even face court 
action for administrative violations. We still have trouble 
accepting that the court is an opportunity to resolve the 
problem in a civilized way. For many people it is only a 
complex, tiresome, and torturous procedure. It is so much easier 
to put pressure on the government, put out pickets, organize a 
strike... To tell you the truth, I even tried once to talk trade 
unions into initiating one such case. Offered our experienced 
lawyers. But we are too passive, friends, too passive. 
  [Valyuzhenich] Does it mean that those in the 
budget-financed 
sector, whose salaries are guaranteed by law by the state, have 
a right to file a court suit against it? 
  [Melikyan] This is exactly the way it should be in a 
law-based state. If I as a minister would be left without pay 
for three months, this is probably what I would do. If the state 
is at fault, it should be held responsible. 
  [Valyuzhenich] And who would in such a case be a respondent 
in court? Perhaps Gennadiy Melikyan, the minister of labor? 
  [Melikyan] I think that this is the administrative 
responsibility of those who are in charge of the budget. Our 
ministry not only is not in charge of the budget--it does not 
have any ability to influence the way it is formed. All 
important decisions are discussed and made by only a small group 
of people close to the prime minister and the president. 
  [Valyuzhenich] Are you not afraid that after this interview 
is published the courts will be flooded with claims? 
  [Melikyan] No. We would be happy to set at least one 
precedent. By the way, this would help us discover the 
shortcomings in the legislation. 
  Still, we are trying to somehow correct the situation with 
respect to wages now. But let us see first why they are actually 
not being paid. Today the main obstacle is that there is no 
money in enterprises' accounts. And the money is not there for a 
variety of reasons. Some simply do not earn it, they are idle. 
Others are not being paid for products already shipped. 
  Add to this the system of clearing. If some money does come 
into an enterprise's account, it is automatically disbursed to 
cover priority compulsory payments: taxes, contributions to 
nonbudget funds (pension), and to their main suppliers--for 
instance, the power generation sector. By the way, this clearing 
system pushed some enterprises managers into paying wages in... 
teapots, saucepans, irons, etc. If they sell these products, the 
money received will immediately go to pay taxes, but you cannot 
tax a teapot. 
  We submitted a proposal to "lock" in enterprise accounts a 
certain amount of money that must be used to pay wages. We have 
reached a compromise with the Ministry of Finance: Up to 50 
percent of money that should go into federal taxes may (and 
should!) remain at the enterprise to pay wages. This decision 
has already been made. 
  [Valyuzhenich] On 1 March the minimum wage and the 
first-category rate of the budget pay scale were supposed to be 
increased. It is already the beginning of April, but there is no 
change in salary. 
  [Melikyan] Our proposal to raise salaries was not supported. 
So the minimum wage today is still 14,620 rubles [R]. There is 
no money in the budget. 
  [Valyuzhenich] Few care that there is no money in the 
budget, 
People have to live on something. It is as if the state 
deliberately is pushing a person to steal, drink, degrade. How 
can one live on a R14,000 or even R30,000 salary today if the 
subsistence minimum already exceeded R60,000 in March? 
  [Melikyan] Well, first, nobody lives on R14,000 in the first 
place. Only about 0.4 percent of the population get the minimum 
wage. 
  [Valyuzhenich] Are those 0.4 percent not people, too? 
  [Melikyan] But as a rule they have more than one job or also 
get a pension. So in reality they have more than that. In 
February, as a result of paying out back wages for January, 
increased supplements to pensions, and a lower rate of 
inflation, 16.7 percent of the population found themselves below 
the subsistence minimum; overall over the entire last year 30-35 
percent (about 50 million) were below the poverty level. 
  Generally, I have to say that statistics on our income are 
very flawed. How do you count, for instance, the income of the 
immense number of people who are standing everywhere selling 
cigarettes, vodka, clothes... I am not saying that we live well 
now. But in reality it is indeed better than in some figures of 
statistical reports. 
  [Valyuzhenich] But this capacity for survival on the part of 
the people--which, by the way, requires a lot of effort and 
time--does not relieve the state of responsibility for 
fulfilling its direct obligations to the population. 
  [Melikyan] Of course not. Now, for instance, we have serious 
income differentiation. The top 20 percent of the high-income 
population account for 42 percent of all income, and the bottom 
20 percent--only 7 percent. In order to find the money to go, 
for instance, into the impoverished budget sphere, we proposed 
to introduce restrictions on the growth of the payroll fund at 
those enterprises where wages are very high. This proposal has 
not even been considered yet. A decision was made recently, 
however, to bring in line the pay of directors of state 
enterprises and joint-stock companies where the controlling 
share of stock is owned by the state. 
  Right now they practically set their own salaries. Quite 
often -- as high as they wish. Their earnings sometimes reach 
R10 million or more. That is why we proposed to make their pay 
commensurate with enterprise size and most importantly, 
operational indicators--first and foremost net profit. 
  [Valyuzhenich] Still--will wages be indexed or not? 
  [Melikyan] They will. This is definite. It is only a 
question 
of timing and rate. Right now everybody is trying to exert 
maximum pressure... 
  [Valyuzhenich] This brings to mind the analogy of a 
tug-of-war. But if the rope breaks, someone inevitably falls 
down.

<F P=106> [Interview with Aleksandr Sergeyev, chairman of the </F>
Independent Trade Union of Miners of Russia, by A. Zhukovskaya; 
place and date not given: "Strike: What the Miners Want"] 
  [Text] Aleksandr Sergeyev is the chairman of the 
Independent Trade Union of Miners of Russia, which was founded 
at the second congress of miners in 1991. He was born on 5 
August 1960 in the city of Mezhdurechensk in Kemerovo Oblast. He 
graduated from the institute, worked in mines as a mine foreman 
and a mechanic. He has been in the workers movement and a member 
of the strike committee of the city since 1989. He was an 
organizer and member of practically all strikes. He is married 
and has two children. He rents an apartment in Moscow. 
  [Zhukovskaya] Aleksandr Andreyevich, why are you striking? 
Do 
you want to hang the losses of your mines on us, the taxpayers? 
  [Sergeyev] First, we are coming out against closing mines 
without job placement for the workers that are released. 
Further, we are trying to fight for a structural restructuring 
of industry and its entry into the market. The third item of our 
demands: To achieve the establishment of safe work conditions. 
It is not known to this day how the state subsidy is being used 
and, in general, the resources of enterprises, and what 
contracts and how many were concluded. Without verification and 
control, any subsidies will vanish, as in 1992--36 billion 
rubles [R] and last year--R1.5 trillion. 
  When we tried to come to the administration of the 
enterprises with an inspection--we were not given access to 
documents, and we were assured that this was a commercial 
secret. On our insistence a comprehensive check was made at the 
Polysayevskaya mine in the city of Novokuznetsk, and we found 
outrageous facts of poor economic management and criminal 
proceedings were instituted against the directors. 
  [Zhukovskaya] Thus, perhaps, instead of strikes, clarify 
relations with the administration in the localities, and then 
some of the problems will be resolved. 
  [Sergeyev] Everything is not that simple. We have been 
trying 
to remove the directors of the Severnaya mine for one and a half 
years. And at the Central mine in Chelyabinsk, where an 
explosion occurred and people died, the director prospers, while 
saying: There is no money to pay wages. 
  [Zhukovskaya] But how do they explain to the miners that 
there is no money? After all, everyone knows about the subsidies. 
  [Sergeyev] They say that they have not arrived from the 
government yet. Only now, once again at our insistence, have the 
presidential structures started to get involved in verification 
of the transmission of state support. Along the chain of the 
Ministry of Finance, the Rosugol association... 
  [Zhukovskaya] But the court? After all, you can dislodge the 
money through the court. 
  [Sergeyev] What kind of court? In Norilsk, our organization 
brought a suit against the general director of the mine and 
metallurgical combine three times. But Judge Sokolovskaya denied 
our case, arguing that "the economic condition of the country 
does not permit observation of the law." 
  [Zhukovskaya] Of course, strikes are an extreme step. What 
have they brought you? 
  [Sergeyev] At our insistence, the government established an 
interdepartmental commission for resolution of socioeconomic 
problems of the coal-mining regions. We have pinned a lot of 
hope on this. It was headed at that time by Gaydar, but with his 
departure, it is now two months and the commission has not met 
even once--it seems no problems exist. What is more, attempts 
are being made now to change the situation concerning this 
commission. But, after all, it could conduct an analysis, and it 
could decide where and how much money is needed in the first 
instance, and in the second...

<F P=106> [Report by Maksim Igorev: "Pot Suppliers: Of All Means of </F>
Transportation, the Most Important For Us Is the Subway"] 
  [Text] Moscow militia officers yesterday completed 
another operation in interdicting illegal drug trafficking. As a 
result of this operation more than 20 kg of drugs and raw 
materials for their manufacture were confiscated from 
criminals. 
  As a KOMMERSANT correspondent was told at the Moscow GUVD 
[City Administration of Internal Affairs], the greatest 
consignment of narcotic raw materials was confiscated in the 
lobby of the Kiyevskaya subway station by the Fedchik 
brothers--officers of the UVD's 3rd Department for Subway 
Security. They detained Ukrainian citizen Igor Belov; during the 
subsequent search, 13 kg of poppy straw was found in his 
possession and confiscated. At the same time, at the 
Komsomolskaya subway station operatives detained Rostov Oblast 
resident Igor Roshchin, on whom they found--and confiscated--500 
g of marijuana. In addition, 30 g of poppy straw, four liters of 
pervitin, and a sawn-off shotgun were found in the possession of 
watchmen at an industrial warehouse on Dorozhnaya Street. 
  According to militia data, suppliers of drugs and materials 
for their manufacture have changed their tactics lately. They 
now do not go directly to Moscow from contiguous states on 
long-distance trains but instead disembark in oblast centers 
such as Kaluga or Tula. From there they usually hitch a car ride 
to the capital. Nevertheless, since the beginning of the year 
militia personnel have confiscated about 200 kg of poppy straw 
at Kievskiy Railroad Station alone. According to operatives, the 
size of the average supplier's consignment of poppy straw these 
days is 60-70 kg.

<F P=106> [Article by Vyacheslav Polyakov, general director of the </F>
Federal Communications Directorate: "Is the Post Office to Blame 
for High Subscription Prices?] 
  [Text] Despite accusations of monopolism leveled at 
the Ministry of Communications, no one wants to take over 
delivery of periodical publications. 
  The times are long gone when the price of any newspaper did 
not exceed two or three kopeks, and the cost of its delivery 
simply did not exist. Today, because of the high cost, many 
people simply cannot afford to subscribe to a newspaper or 
journal. But even if you have become a subscriber, this still 
does not mean that you will receive the publication to which you 
have subscribed on a regular basis and in a timely manner. There 
are many reasons for this, but, as always, the most to blame in 
this case is the post office, which is the last stop along the 
newspaper's route to the reader. Today, everyone hurls angry 
accusations at the post office! And above all--the publishers 
themselves. It has gotten to the point where the editors of the 
newspapers TRUD and IZVESTIYA have filed a claim with the 
Judicial Chamber on Informational Disputes under the Russian 
Federation president, accusing the Federal Postal Communications 
Directorate of monopolism, of unjustified increases in rates for 
the delivery of printed matter, and even of infringing upon the 
rights of citizens to receive printed information. 
  I would like to make an attempt to determine calmly, without 
excess emotion, the degree to which the accusations leveled 
against the postal communications directorate are justified. A 
letter signed by Minister of Communications Vladimir Bulgak 
regarding this matter was sent to the Judicial Chamber on 
Informational Disputes, explaining both the essence of the 
question and the position of the ministry. 
  No one can deny the fact that the rates on delivery of 
printed matter are high. Unfortunately, this is an objective 
reality. Before, in the pre-reform times, the expenditures for 
delivery of printed matter were compensated from the profit 
received from other highly profitable services provided by the 
postal and electrical communications. Today we have no such 
possibility of re-distributing income. The new economic 
conditions in which we live, the market mechanism, have made it 
necessary to introduce rates on services for the distribution of 
periodical publications in accordance with the expenditures. The 
cost of delivery today reaches more than 50 percent of the total 
subscription cost of the publication. At first glance this may 
seem too much, but even these funds do not compensate all the 
expenditures. The expenditures for the transit and delivery of 
printed publications are constantly increasing, while the income 
received for the 8 months prior to the start of the subscription 
campaign is becoming just as quickly devalued. As a result, the 
postal service has incurred a loss in the sum of over 62 billion 
rubles [R] for 1993. 
  We are being accused of monopolism. Yet this is the very 
thing which we would gladly refuse. The Federal Communications 
Directorate supports any initiative for creating alternative 
services. In many foreign countries the distribution of 
periodical publications is handled by the publishers, which have 
their own distribution network. The postal service performs 
individual operations by contract with the editorial offices. We 
might add that today the Russian postal service is already not a 
monopolist in taking subscriptions, processing orders and 
expediting. Alternative services for the distribution of printed 
matter have been created and are in operation at the AO 
[joint-stock company] "AiF," "Izvestiya," "Rospechat" and 
others. A monopoly is retained only on one type of service--the 
delivery of printed publications. Because of its 
unprofitability, no one wants to engage in this and bear the 
losses. We have repeatedly made proposals to the editorial 
offices and publishing houses regarding the creation of their 
own delivery services, but they are in no hurry to do so. It is 
too expensive and unprofitable. Due to the low profitability (in 
1993 on the whole for the postal service it comprised only 2 
percent), we do not have the funds to develop this subsector. 
The network of postal institutions is getting smaller. In the 
last year there have become 1,000 fewer of them. The number of 
trains carrying mail is decreasing, in connection with which 202 
routes of postal cars have been cancelled. How can we speak of 
quality of servicing under these conditions? 
  The efficiency of printed matter delivery could be 
facilitated by a network of decentralized printing of central 
newspapers. However, due to their own economic difficulties, the 
editorial offices have begun to reduce the number of printing 
points. The problems of the transporters, polygraphers, and 
editorial offices are quite understandable and explicable. 
However, all the accusations of increasing the delivery times 
are being addressed only to the postal workers. The efforts of 
the postal institutions to distribute printed matter remain 
unnoticed. However, despite all the difficulties today, 70 
percent of the circulation of the central newspapers is 
nevertheless delivered to the subscribers on the day of issue. 
The subscription circulation of periodical publications for the 
first half of 1994 comprised 103.5 percent of the circulation 
for the second half of 1993. The number of titles of newspapers 
and journals distributed by the postal service continues to grow 
(from 1901 publications in 1993 to 2113 in 1994). I repeat, our 
efforts may seem inadequate to some, but we cannot forget that 
as long as the postal service endures losses from its activity, 
it is difficult to expect better results. 
  The existing system of state subsidies does not extend to 
all 
types of services, but only to the delivery of regular and 
registered correspondence and to the mailing and delivery of 
money orders and parcels. We have been categorically refused 
subsidies for the delivery of printed matter--the most 
unprofitable service. The Minfin [Ministry of Finance] 
explanation states that the expenditures for delivery of 
periodical publications must be determined on the basis of 
predictive calculations, taking into consideration the possible 
changes in prices on consumed products, and must be reimbursed 
by the publication subscribers. 
  Prices on subscription publications must, of course, be 
affordable to the main body of the readers, but this is a 
problem not only of the post office. All interested parties must 
strive toward this. The results of recent subscription campaigns 
indicate that the Federal Postal Communications Directorate, 
together with the editorial offices and publishing houses, has 
been able to stabilize subscriptions. However, the reduction of 
subscription prices may only be achieved in two ways. First--a 
state subsidy of editorial offices, publishing houses and 
distributors must be implemented. However, this would mean 
admitting our own helplessness without engaging the market 
mechanism. The second, and in my opinion the most optimal means, 
is the formation of a system of tax benefits for the entire 
complex associated with the publication and distribution of 
periodicals. Then we will not have to give away funds in the 
form of taxes with one hand, and to accept subsidies with the 
other. The repeal of the value-added tax on printed matter and 
of the taxes on property of enterprises associated with the 
printing of periodical publications and their distribution would 
make it possible to reduce subscription prices by almost 30 
percent and to increase the subscription circulations 
accordingly. The Ministry of Communications has repeatedly 
presented such proposals for discussion by the government, but 
unfortunately they have not been supported. We will hope that 
reason will prevail. After all, nothing will be accomplished by 
mutual accusations and justifications.

"Khabarovsk Postal Workers on Attack Against Newspapers . . . 
with a Half Hitch"] 
  [Text] Khabarovsk--We are already used to it. Every time he 
is about to start a subscription, the ordinary person, who 
cannot imagine life without newspapers and magazines, freezes in 
anxious expectation: what price surprise will the next 
subscription drive bring him? 
  For example, in Khabarovsk, to get the central papers, which 
come out five times a week, they were asking 13,260 rubles [R]. 
So that ROSSIYSKIYE VESTI, based on the catalog price, would 
cost the subscriber more than R25,000--exactly five times more 
than he paid in the first half-year. The head of the press sales 
department at the Khabarovsk postal service administration, 
Tatyana Aristova, and the head of the planning department, Nina 
Vartseva, graciously presented all their calculations. This is 
how it works. To the "catalog" cost of the subscription, the 
postal workers add on 8 percent, plus the cost of one copy, 
multiplied by the number of times the newspaper comes out. But 
what norms are all these percentages based on? According to 
their assertion, these are the expenses for organizing the 
subscription itself, plus the cost of receiving, processing, and 
delivering the newspapers. 
  Those living in Khabarovsk are actually lucky. What if they 
were in Nikolayevsk-na-Amure, or Okhotsk, or somewhere else in 
the northern rayon of Priamurye? There, the Khabarovsk price for 
the delivery of their own country's newspaper would seem 
completely laughable. In the north of Khabarovsk Kray, postal 
rates for daily delivery of the central paper stun any 
imagination--R46,000! Don't forget to add to this the "catalog" 
cost of the publication as well. 
  May the Khabarovsk postal workers forgive me, but I 
personally am of the opinion that they are going to great 
lengths to rid themselves completely of the burden that the 
newspapers are. Speaking to this is the organization of 
subscriptions for the periodic press and its delivery, when all 
imaginable and unimaginable expenses are passed on to the 
Priamurye residents. 
  There is a completely different attitude in neighboring 
Primorskiy Kray toward the lawful right of each person to 
receive information. If in Khabarovsk each rayon's postal 
service is doing its best to astonish the individual with its 
own price for newspaper delivery, then here a single price has 
been established--the same in Vladivostok as in the distant 
settlement of Luchegorsk. Moreover, to the more mass and popular 
publications, the cost of delivery is reduced by half over the 
normal cost. This system has been in effect here for over two 
years. And before starting the subscription drive for the second 
half of the year, postal workers came out with one more 
initiative, announcing for their partners a subscription, 
despite their relatively moderate price, on credit. 
  "We do not want to lose subscribers," the head of the 
Primorye postal service, Antonina Astanayev, told me. "Believe 
me, postal workers have absolutely nothing to gain if the 
newspapers go under." 
  Similar examples have absolutely no effect on the Khabarovsk 
postal workers. It is useless to cite the February resolution of 
the Russian president's judicial chamber on information disputes 
about how several territorial subdivisions of the postal 
service, occupying a monopoly position, have been willfully and 
uncontrollably establishing prices for newspaper delivery that 
significantly exceed the "catalog" cost of the publications. In 
reply to this, the head of the Khabarovsk postal service, Otto 
Grib, told a journalist from a local newspaper that the legal 
chamber's decision is lying on his desk, too, but it is nothing 
but a piece of paper which does not obligate him in any way.

Information Space' Going Through One Gate?"] 
  [Text] Let's begin with the statistics. About 120 million 
Russians live in Russia, and about 30 million citizens belong to 
other nationalities. Of these 30 million, slightly fewer than a 
third--nearly 9 million--comprise immigrants from the former 
union republics of the USSR. In other words, of every dozen 
Russians, one is connected in some way with those lands now 
known as the near abroad. He is connected by bad memories 
sometimes, unfortunately. But basically the number cited--one in 
a dozen--is made up, understandably, not of Russian immigrants 
but of Ukrainians, Belarusians, Kazakhs, Armenians, Azeris, 
Moldovans, Georgians, Uzbeks, Lithuanians, Latvians, Estonians, 
Kyrgyz, Turkmen, and Tajiks. This somewhat unusual order of 
listing is by decreasing number of representatives of these 
peoples within the borders of Russian territory. The largest 
group living in Russia are the Ukrainians--4.4 million. The 
fewest of all are the Turkmen--about 40,000. Major diasporas 
include the Belarusians, 1.2 million, the Kazakhs, 0.64 million, 
the Armenians, 0.5 million, and the Azeris, 0.34 million. There 
are a little over 100,000 Georgians and Moldovans each. The 
majority of the peoples of the former union republics are 
represented in Russia by the same number of citizens as the 
population of a major city might comprise. 
  Does the Russian state remember that these people too have 
national feelings and interests? These people do not make up 
republics or autonomies, as do other nationalities residing in 
Russia, nor are they demanding this. Thus it is even more 
pointless to ignore their demands. Above all for information. 
Nationality-group societies and confessional organizations might 
concern themselves at least somewhat with the cultural, 
religious, and educational requirements and needs of their 
fellow tribesmen, but it is beyond the powers of such 
organizations to arrange for issuing periodicals, to say nothing 
of radio and television. The old information connections have 
been completely disrupted. It used to be in Moscow a person 
could easily subscribe to or purchase republic newspapers and 
magazines, radio and television broadcast programs produced in 
the union republics, and all kinds of festivals, TV bridges, and 
so forth, were organized. Of course, in all this there was, 
often even overwhelmingly, a degree of falsity, mere show, 
deceptive and self-serving propaganda, which is in fact why the 
"single information space" collapsed. But in starting to talk 
now about reestablishing it, it is clearly useful to account 
clearly for the reality that has formed in its stead. 
  The heirs of the union's former so-called Central TV and 
Radio--the Russian federal TV-radio companies--have reoriented 
themselves wholly toward Russia, and only Russia. Even if some 
of the content in the broadcasts were especially calculated for 
our neighbors and they felt like seeing or hearing something, 
neither side would have the money to make that happen. According 
to world practice, it is the receiving country that pays for the 
technical provision and the right to transmit broadcasts from 
another state. Here we have it the other way around. The 
director for international communications of the VGTRK 
[All-Russian State Television and Radio Broadcasting Company], 
Sergey Yerofeyev, informed the RIA [Russian Information Agency] 
that, except for Belarus, Turkmenistan, and a few other 
countries of the CIS, which undertook the expense themselves 
(and only for the transmission), the other states of the near 
abroad have informed the company that they cannot pay to 
disseminate Russian TV and radio programs. Nor are the Russian 
TV and radio companies themselves in a position to do this any 
longer; they don't have the money to run them to their own 
country. The picture with the periodic press is analogous. 
  Let us turn our attention to this, however. The 
above-mentioned announcement by VGTRK's director for 
international communications stresses that the company is still 
trying to pay for transmission beyond the borders of Russia, 
since it is concerned about the interests of the 20 million 
Russians in the near abroad, for whom television and radio are 
the "sole channel for direct and vital contact with Russia," and 
since "it would be a tragedy if the last connecting thread were 
to break off." This is so, undoubtedly, and the appropriate 
efforts must be redoubled, although in no instance can one count 
merely on the enthusiasm of the television companies, which 
without the support of the president and the government are 
simply powerless to do anything. I still wonder, though: Why 
does the director for international communications, 
while worrying about his fellow countrymen abroad, not even 
mention the 9 million other fellow countrymen of his who are 
living in Russia but are linked by blood to her neighbors? Why 
does he say nothing about that every twelfth Russian who in the 
correspondence page indicated that he was a Ukrainian, or a 
Turkmen, or an Armenian, or a Moldovan, or an Estonian. . . . 
Least of all do I wish to reproach S. Yerofeyev personally. This 
is just the old habit of thinking about information connections 
as primarily one-sided. 
  Inside the Soviet empire, Russia (or more precisely, Moscow) 
was the center, sending out "necessary" information to an entire 
one-sixth of the world, but hardly ever receiving it. The "back 
connection" scarcely enjoyed equal rights. Now the "situation" 
has changed, but the psychology has not. To some frankly, but to 
the majority subconsciously, the "single information space" 
means the Russian space, which just creates additional grounds 
to reproach us for imperial ambitions. In Moscow it is much 
easier to buy a newspaper from the United States or Japan, or 
pick up a broadcast from London or Paris, than to read, watch, 
or hear information from Kiev or Tallinn, Tbilisi or Bishkek. 
  Usually you can still pick up radio from the nearer 
capitals, 
but the Trans-Caucasus and Central Asia are virtually 
inaccessible to radio listeners, and there's not even a dream of 
TV broadcasts from them. 
  Is something being undertaken to change the situation? 
  The Mir TV-radio company has been created. It was conceived 
as CIS-wide, but its technical and creative possibilities do not 
allow it to proceed, understandably, in any way comparable with 
the former union Central TV and Radio. For the most part it 
broadcasts "from Russia with love"; analogous broadcasting into 
Russia is nil. 
  Last December, at a meeting in Ashkhabad between CIS heads 
of 
state, a decision was passed to create a weekly entitled "The 
CIS: A Common Market." This February, representatives of the 
Commonwealth countries' economic departments signed founding 
documents on the publication of this newspaper. They were 
supposed to club together to finance and distribute it in all 
the shareholder states. Everything seemed decided. But there 
still isn't a "single common CIS publication"! As was reported 
at RF [Russian Federation] Roskompechat [Russian Committee for 
the Press], it isn't even registered, inasmuch as Roskompechat 
has temporarily halted registration. An unimportant but eloquent 
detail: once again, everything is being decided (or not decided) 
in Moscow. 
  What does the situation look like "from the other side," 
from 
the countries of the near abroad? How do immigrants from there 
who are living in Russia learn about events going on there? 
<H5>  Vadim Dolganov, press-attache, Ukrainian Embassy, Moscow: </H5>
  Two newspapers are published in Russia for Ukrainians. The 
Association of Ukrainians in Moscow and Russia puts out 
UKRAINSKIY VYBOR, and the Slavutich society puts out UKRAINSKIY 
KURYER. The former comes out more or less regularly, something 
you cannot say about the latter, unfortunately. There are many 
problems with their publication, which are extremely difficult 
to resolve, primarily due to a shortage of money. For this 
reason, the Promin radio station has ceased to broadcast to 
Russia. I want to emphasize that it is merely a matter of money, 
and any attempts to drag politics in here have no foundation 
whatsoever. Information links must be restored as quickly as 
possible because there are so many misunderstandings on these 
grounds, and as a result the mass media, instead of aiding 
mutual understanding, often hinder it. Our ambassador, Vladimir 
Kryzhanovskiy, recently met with the editors-in-chief of the 
Russian newspapers. All of them supported his proposal that 
within the CIS, at the level of prime minister, an agreement is 
necessary on mutual obligations to facilitate the exchange of 
information in every way possible. So far that information is 
often not objective. We frequently write about one another the 
way we used to write about America: Oh, they're lynching Negroes 
there, and in Chicago it's nothing but gangsters. It was 
reported, for example, that in Sevastopol all the schools were 
switching to Ukrainian. But that's not true! The press is 
supposed to reduce, not compress the tension. The Intersputnik 
system is not being utilized now. Broadcasts to Ukraine could go 
over that, and from there at least to the regions of Russia 
where Ukrainians live in large numbers--Tyumen, the Far East, 
Moscow, and St. Petersburg. 
<H5>  Anatoliy Goreglyad, press-attache, Embassy of the Republic </H5>
of Belarus: 
  As far as I know, there are still no newspapers or magazines 
in the Belarusian language in Russia. The Batkovshchina society 
came out as the initiator for such a publication, and it is 
registered with Roskompechat, but it has not yet started to come 
out. Even we in the embassy get newspapers from Minsk with great 
difficulty, and only through Internal Affairs Ministry channels. 
The picture is the same with Russian newspapers in Belarus. 
These problems cannot be solved until the issue of Belarus's 
entry into the ruble zone is decided. 
<H5>  Regina Minaylova, cultural advisor, Embassy of the Republic </H5>
of Belarus: 
  Belarusians come to the embassy asking to read our ZVEZDA or 
our NARODNAYA GAZETA. The Batkovshchina Society is organizing a 
subscription in Minsk for Muscovite Belarusians, but the 
shipping is terribly expensive. There is no retransmission of 
broadcasts from Belarusian radio in Russia (nor is there of the 
radio of the other former union republics--Ed.), and it can be 
very hard to pick up Minsk. As far as I know, soon after the 
election of Mecheslav Grib as chairman of the Supreme Council of 
Belarus, President Yeltsin suggested to him that the single 
cultural space be revived within the CIS and a corresponding 
agreement and committee be set up to deal with issues of 
culture, science, education, and information. This is absolutely 
essential! 
<H5>  David Demetrashvili, press-attache, Georgian Embassy: </H5>
  It's hard to say how many Georgians there are in Russia now. 
After all, a large number of refugees have been added! In Moscow 
and St. Petersburg, GRUZIYA: SOBYTIYA, LYUDI in Russian, is 
being distributed. Two issues have come out. There is nothing in 
Georgian. After all, though, Russians need to know the truth 
about Georgia, too! In their reports on Georgia, unfortunately, 
the Russian media often commit blunders. 
<H5>  Nikolay Martyanov, head of the Foreign Economic Activity </H5>
Department, Roskompechat: 
  The assistance program for ethnic Russians in the near 
abroad 
provides for duty-free shipment of publications for them, 
duty-free supply of printing equipment, and paper for printing 
newspapers, magazines, and books in Russian there. The same 
needs to be done to help put out publications intended for 
representatives of other ethnic groups residing in Russia. This 
could be done on a reciprocal basis. 
<H5>  Lavrentiy Mikhaylov, head, International Cooperation </H5>
Administration, Roskompechat: 
  The restoration of contacts and the conclusion of bilateral 
and multilateral agreements on information exchange inside the 
CIS and with other countries of the former USSR is a matter of 
great importance for Roskompechat. At the suggestion of the 
Belarusian side (we had wanted to make the same one, but they 
beat us to it), a meeting is planned for representatives of the 
press and of the appropriate government departments of the 
countries of the CIS to discuss the exchange of publications and 
mutual assistance and cooperation in the sphere of the press and 
information. The meeting is proposed for May. 
<H8>  * * * </H8>
  Unfortunately, we were unable to find anything out about 
similar plans in the area of TV and radio, since on the Russian 
side there is simply no one working on that as yet. The Federal 
Television and Radio Broadcasting Service, which was formed by 
presidential edict, has yet to be created as a practically 
functioning organ. 
  Let us sum up. Everyone we were able to talk with is in 
favor 
of a single information space. The Russia's economic situation, 
however, and especially that of its poorer neighbors, allows no 
hope that in the near future we will even be able to approach 
the scale this space enjoyed formerly. Efforts at the state 
level are scattered and weak and do not go much beyond good 
intentions. For all intents and purposes, there is no 
information market across the former Union. The absence of a 
full-blooded, healthy exchange of information is becoming a 
major reason behind many conflicts and tensions. Russians abroad 
may still be at least partially informed about affairs in their 
homeland, but non-Russians in Russia are virtually not at all 
about events at home. The circulations of the two Ukrainian and 
one Georgian newspapers mentioned do not cover even a hundredth 
of their potential readers, and there is no information at all 
about publications for representatives of other nationalities in 
Russia. 
  And finally. A request not to reproach the author for the 
weakness of the constructive part. Many suggestions could be 
made, and some have already been heard in conversations. 
Everyone speaks with enthusiasm on "what is to be done." But 
nothing is done. The main thing is that all gazes are once again 
turned toward Russia, whereas the Russians themselves, while 
treating outside initiative quite jealously, are manifesting 
their own initiative meagerly. As well as one-sidedly, 
concerning themselves only about Russians abroad. As David 
Demetrashvili correctly noted, the idea of creating a network of 
information media for non-Russians in Russia is topical and very 
necessary. If, I might add, the game goes through the same gates 
as before, the creation of a new information space, where all 
"players" are on an equal footing, will not even be able to get 
started.

<F P=106> [Article by Nikita Vaynonen: "The Soap Is from the Wrong </F>
Opera, But the Broom Is Valuable"] 
  [Text] What will become of our TV? Will it remain in the 
form the viewer is used to, or will it ultimately come under the 
power of commerce and bad taste? Is the state prepared to 
continue in the future to pay for its maintenance, or will these 
payments gradually decrease to zero over the next couple of 
years? Do we need state TV at all, or should it become 
exclusively private? 
  Questions, questions, questions...they are being discussed 
at 
many levels, from the communal kitchen to the parliament. And 
with all the diversity of opinions the disputing parties, as a 
rule, agree on two points: The spiritual health of the nation 
depends largely on television, and television itself is 
seriously ill. 
  In the most general form the condition of our TV screen 
reflects the condition of the economy, culture, 
statehood--society as a whole, with all the pains of the 
transition period when the old structures are rotting and 
collapsing and the new ones are being born into torment and 
filth. Perhaps the only difference with TV is that it is more on 
view for the country than anything else: What is beyond the 
mirror (excuse me, beyond the screen) directly affects the 
"picture," what television workers call the result of their 
labor--everything we see on the screen. 
  A good deal has been said about the corruption that has been 
eating away at state TV, including by the leading masters of 
state television itself. We shall not repeat this. But if the 
discussion were only about who is putting the most money in his 
pocket, the subject of corruption in TV would hardly be worth a 
separate discussion. The more so since television journalists, 
like the rank-and-file television workers in our country in 
general, have never been paid as much for their labor as their 
intellectual property is actually worth. So is it such a great 
sin for them to be paid more now, actually in keeping with their 
labor and their talent? 
  The problem (or blame) lies not with large amounts of money, 
and frequently not even with the means of obtaining it, which, 
as a rule, you cannot figure out. It is impossible to judge what 
is legal here and what is not as long as there is no law on 
television. Is it legal, for example, to split up the 
advertising service of that same Ostankino when the 
business--and the money!--is handled not by a helpless single 
owner but by a multitude of real owners of individual programs? 
The desire to earn money in and of itself can only be laudable. 
The blame (and the problem!) of those who are earning it lies in 
that labor and talent have nothing to do with earning money 
anywhere. Mr. Sheldon Markoff, our guest from American 
television circles, recently noted in the company of his Russian 
colleagues: 
  "I have devoted half my life to television and let me assure 
you that our federal television broadcasting company defends 
only the interests of the public, the audience, and by no means 
those of the state and the broadcasters. Our license to 
broadcast is something like an oath of fidelity to the 
television viewers. It would be better for you to come and see 
for yourself than to see the monstrous American television 
product which I see in your country every day." 
  And there you have it! Only the Third World has the good 
fortune to tirelessly watch a stern-looking man tastefully 
lighting a cigarette against an exotic mountain Indian 
background. Americans would simply not understand it if somebody 
tried to prove to them that Lucky Strike is real America. It 
seems that under Kennedy the first machine for computer 
translation from one language to another was tested in the 
United States. They asked the president to suggest some phrase 
in English and assured him that he would immediately hear how it 
would sound in Russian. "All right," said the president, "here 
is a phrase for you: The spirit is strong but the flesh is 
weak." The machine grunted and spit out: "Vodka keeps well, but 
the meat has spoiled." It must be that the creators of the 
machine had automatically put into it ideas about Russians that 
are typical of the "mentality" of the average American: Where 
there is Russia there is vodka. And regarding meat, it was a 
real prophecy. Our own rots, but on the screen there is 
"Knorr".... 
  Advertising tobacco and alcohol on television is prohibited 
in our country by the law on protection of the health of Russian 
citizens. But neither the law nor the corresponding order from 
Ostankino chief A. Yakovlev is being obeyed. The money is more 
valuable! 
  But what is more valuable than money? It is thought that 
inducement is. And the main national "inducement" is that the 
new Constitution guarantees to citizens (Article 44): "Everyone 
has the right to...access to cultural values." If one keeps in 
mind that the lion's share of these values are concentrated in 
the two Russian capitals and several other large cities, it 
becomes clear that the right to access to them can actually be 
provided only with the help of television. But sociologists 
attest that never before has the percentage of programs that are 
called serious been as low as it is today. Air time has been 
clogged with a flow of "soap operas," simple-minded competitions 
and quiz shows, and concerts of pop and rock music. It would be 
all right if it were good "soap," but our television bureaucrats 
have given preference to low-grade Latin American "operas." And 
the main place among the game shows and competitions has been 
taken by those in which the viewers' imagination is struck not 
by the creative devices of their authors but by the amounts of 
the prizes. It is no wonder that on one of these programs, 
instead of toys on the Christmas tree there were $100 bills. 
There is no need to even talk about the tasteless and noisy 
television concerts: The lyrical songs of Soviet composers which 
we criticized mercilessly in the past for the banality of the 
text and music seem like true treasures by comparison. 
  World experience shows that TV inevitably becomes a vehicle 
for mass culture. But some examples of it are better and some 
are worse. On our television, preference is given to the worst. 
The reason is simple: We select whatever is cheaper and can 
produce a rapid and the largest possible gain. Here, as distinct 
from food products, the food of the screen does not undergo even 
a selective expert evaluation. The only guarantee against a 
poor-quality product, both foreign and domestic, are the taste 
and honor of the television journalists themselves. But these 
remarkable qualities are always being subjected to a great deal 
of pressure. The main concern is how to survive. 
  With a 40-fold increase in the cost of television programs, 
the cost of services of the Ministry of Communications, which 
puts out the signal, has increased 100-fold. According to the 
testimony of such authorities as the general director of VGTRK 
[All-Russian State Television and Radio Broadcasting Company], 
A. Lysenko, and the chief of the fund for protection of 
glasnost, A. Simonov, today it is more advantageous to use 
foreign land transmitters and communications satellites than to 
apply for the services of the corresponding domestic 
departments. And there is no hope that these services will 
become any less expensive in the foreseeable future. The price 
of a kilowatt-hour, for example, is still less than the world 
price, and when they become equal (and this is apparently 
inevitable), it is difficult even to imagine how much the energy 
workers will be asking from the communications workers, and the 
latter--from the television workers. Radio broadcasting, 
naturally, is in a similar position. In the budget not only did 
they not account for this inevitable growth of prices but even 
the costs at the current rates were to be financed only 
partially (according to information from the deputy minister of 
finance, I. Molchanov, subsidies are being cut by half, and in 
the draft budget submitted to the Duma there is even less 
money). In the upper echelons of the television business they 
are quite seriously talking about cutting broadcasting by a 
factor of two, three, or even four. According to the prediction 
of Anatoliy Lysenko, then "Russian television viewers would be 
able to see only films from video rental stores slightly diluted 
with news excerpts." 
  Unfortunately, searches for a way out of the impasse for a 
long time have amounted exclusively for searches for someone to 
blame. In turn and altogether they have been the energy workers 
who are raising prices, the communications workers who are 
threatening to strike, the government which is not providing 
money and is breaking its firmest promises to provide at least 
some...of course, it is absurd when one state structure, in this 
case, communications, gets something from another one that is 
equally a part of the state by striking. That is like the story 
where the right arm says: I will not cut hay until the left one 
gives me a scythe, and the left one answers: I will not give it 
up until you put a sleeve on me, and the right one says: I will 
not put it on until...and so forth. It is pointless to look for 
a scapegoat. And even if after digging you manage to find 
unjustified rate increases in some stage, this will not save us. 
Everyone involved in the problem, regardless of whether they 
have economic or political views, seems to agree on a simple 
idea: The state is incapable of carrying such an immense monster 
as the present state television and radio. The state is unable 
not only to feed this monster, but even to provide the minimum 
necessary control of this structure. 
  Today state broadcasting includes 93 television and radio 
companies (three federal, one in Moscow, and 89 regional ones). 
In terms of the volume of broadcasting and the audience reached, 
it is still the predominant one. But in terms of potential 
energy, both human and material, state TV is clearly falling 
behind independent TV. There are already 321 private companies 
in operation, and this is not counting the cable studios that 
are sprouting up like mushrooms. On the Ostankino channel, which 
is still the most powerful, 80 percent of the programs are made 
by independent producer services (ViD, NTV, Eksperiment, ATV, 
etc.) and only 20 percent are made by state television employees 
and journalists, of whom, according to estimates of experts, 
there are clearly too many. (Here, true, it is necessary to make 
a significant reservation: The word "independent" which is used 
to designate nonstate companies is, to put it mildly, 
imprecise--they are even very dependent on their supporters, 
frequently more so than state companies are on the state, which, 
as Aleksandr Yakovlev correctly noted in an interview on Radio 
Liberty, no longer interferes in the work of television 
journalists.) 
  But destatization of television and radio is only one of the 
paths to economic support for broadcasting. Moreover, it 
involves costs. At a recent meeting of the television community 
in the House of the Journalist where this problem was discussed, 
one of the representatives of the regional companies told how 
the creation of a joint-stock company out of the broadcasting 
center was proceeding in his city. He asked not to give his name 
because "I have to live there." The lion's share of the stocks 
went to the local administration of the State Committee for 
Administration of State Property and also local communications 
workers--who are now in charge of the center. All the 
journalists could do was scrape together enough to buy thousands 
of vouchers, which gave them the right to...3 percent of the 
stocks. 
  This kind of "privatization" of air time can lead to only 
one 
thing: The monopoly of the center will be replaced by a much 
more destructive and selfish monopoly of local authorities. 
  The situation was exacerbated especially after the Ministry 
of the Press was transformed into the Russian Committee on the 
Press and the Federal Television and Radio Service was created: 
Licensing of air time, which for better or worse was still 
handled by the corresponding administration of the Ministry of 
the Press and Information, was actually terminated. It is not 
included in the functions of the state committee, and the 
federal television and radio service was created only de jure. 
Moreover, its specific authority was not prescribed in the 
presidential edict on its creation. It must be concretized in 
the Statute on the Radio and Television Service, a draft of 
which was recently made known to the journalistic community. 
Information on the "parents" of the draft is going about, but, 
judging from its content, the "parents" have little in common 
with the authors of the president's edict: The draft interprets 
the federal service as an institution in charge of domestic air 
time even more strictly than the former Soviet State Committee 
for Television and Radio. 
  The colleagues who gathered a couple of days ago in the 
House 
of the Journalist (and they were representatives of state and 
private television and radio companies, journalistic legal 
protection organizations, the Union of Journalists of Russia, 
and the judicial chamber for information disputes) think that 
the state (or, more precisely, social-legal) television and 
radio broadcasting is necessary--it can consist of one or at 
most two channels which exist at the expense of the budget or by 
direct payment made in some form by the viewers and listeners 
themselves and therefore do not depend on commercial interests. 
In order for nonstate broadcasting to develop on a healthy basis 
it is necessary, first, to destatize television and radio 
companies, and especially broadcasting centers, and this should 
be done in such a way that the people actually in charge of air 
time are the professional journalists themselves, who know how 
to work in the interests of the audience and not broadcasting 
bureaucrats; second--as soon as possible it is necessary to have 
a law on television and radio broadcasting which would place the 
commercial, political, and other aspects of TV work on a firm 
legal foundation. 
  But until there is a law, the Federal Television and Radio 
Service should be assigned strictly limited functions, and in no 
case should it be made into a supervisor of air time. Its work 
is to carry out licensing and to check as strictly as possible 
on the observance of its conditions (so that poison is not 
advertised, there is not too much porn, stolen goods are not 
circulated, etc.), for which it should have a data base of 
license holders and the quality of their work. A new broom 
should sweep things clean. But no censorship! No "ministry of 
truth"! Only the law! As for money, society will be able to pay 
for its own public television if it becomes the kind the 
cultural, civilized majority of the nation want to see.

<F P=106> [Article by the Control Directorate of the Administration of </F>
the President of the Russian Federation: "Information on the 
Results of the Audit of the Financial-Economic Activity of the 
Ostankino Russian State Television and Radio Company"] 
  [Text] [begin boxed item] 
<H5>  Scandals: Where Are the Remains of the Ostankino Billions? </H5>
  The provocation regarding the "version" of the state coup 
had 
barely died down when a new stage in the search for enemies 
could be heard. 
  A quite reputable publication--NOVAYA YEZHEDNEVNAYA 
GAZETA--on whose editorial board there do not seem to be any 
provocateurs but with which such respectable politicians as M. 
Gorbachev and G. Yavlinskiy are affiliated, published 
information on 30 March concerning the results of an audit of 
the financial-economic activity of the Ostankino television and 
radio company conducted by the Control Directorate of the 
Administration of the President of the Russian Federation. 
  It would seem that the publication of this kind of document 
should only be welcomed. However, this publication turned out to 
be very peculiar. After making a number of removals from the 
text of the document and accompanying its principal propositions 
with caustic comments directed at the auditors themselves, as 
well as at those "close to the president," NOVAYA YEZHEDNEVNAYA 
GAZETA accused the Control Directorate of performing some kind 
of "sociopolitical order." 
  The sense of the accusation is extremely simple. According 
to 
this logic, people are divided into strangers and friends. The 
first are members of the nomenklatura and partocrats (V. Bragin, 
Yu. Bandura)--they should be the subjects of the most thorough 
attention and investigation. The second, the freedom-loving 
democrats (Ye. Yakovlev, I. Malashenko, A. Maslyanov, and A. 
Razbash, VID and INTERVID members), are untouchable. Any 
investigation of their financial-economic activity is assessed 
as subversive sociopolitical activity by the enemies of reform 
and perestroyka. Briefly, do not touch ours! 
  This dual morality on the part of the NOVAYA YEZHEDNEVNAYA 
GAZETA publishers becomes obvious when you familiarize yourself 
with the original source in its full text, which we suggest that 
you do today. 
  The document we are publishing was sent by the Control 
Directorate of the Administration of the President to A.N. 
Yakovlev, chairman of the Russian State Television and Radio 
Company, "for examination and adoption of appropriate measures" 
and, judging by everything, it was not intended for the press by 
the auditors. In this connection, the question arises for NOVAYA 
YEZNEDNEVNAYA GAZETA: 
  What place does your publication hold in the "rating of 
lies?" [end boxed item] 
<H8>  * * * </H8>
  In accordance with instructions, a Control Directorate 
Commission, with the enlistment of specialists of the Ministry 
of Finance of Russia, the State Committee of Taxation of Russia, 
the State Committee for Management of State Property of Russia, 
the MVD [Ministry of Internal Affairs]] of Russia, and the DNP 
[Russian Federation Department of Tax Police], conducted an 
audit of the financial-economic activity of the Russian State 
Television and Radio Company (RGTRK) Ostankino in 
January-February of this year. 
  In 1993 the Ministry of Finance of Russia financed the 
expenditures of the RGTRK Ostankino from the republic budget of 
the Russian Federation in the sum of 103.7 billion rubles [R], 
of which R82.8 billion, or 80 percent, constituted payment for 
services of the Ministry of Communications of Russia, and R20.9 
billion was expended on its own needs. At the outset of 1994 the 
company's indebtedness to state enterprises that ensure the 
dissemination and broadcasting of radio and television programs 
was R50.3 billion, and to the Television Technical Center 
(TTTs), R1.8 billion. It should be noted that the present 
indebtedness to enterprises of the Ministry of Communications 
led to severe social tension of these enterprises in labor 
collectives and created hotbeds of strikes in many regions of 
the country. 
  At the same time, despite the difficult financial situation, 
the leadership of the company and the general economic board of 
directors did not undertake the necessary measures to eliminate 
deficiencies in the expenditure of budgetary resources, and also 
to increase the efficiency of commercial activities. A number of 
shortcomings noted in the materials of the audit by the KRU 
[Control-Auditing Directorate] of the Ministry of Finance of 
Russia for 1992 have not been eliminated to the present time. 
  Budgetary resources continue to be used for purposes other 
than those designated. Of the resources allocated in 1993 
specifically designated for payment for technical means of 
communication, R2.4 billion was directed at financing the 
services of the TTTs, the production of films of the Ekran 
association, and also maintenance of buildings and other 
administrative expenditures. 
  As a result of the lack of proper control on the part of the 
leadership of the RGTRK Ostankino (former chairman V.I. Bragin), 
individual television studios during the past year illegally 
allowed an increase in the volume of broadcasting established 
for them, which was financed from the republic budget of the 
Russian Federation. The Information Television Agency, the 
Musical and Entertainment Programs Studio, and the National 
Creative Arts Studio exceeded their broadcast time limit. As a 
whole, the company groundlessly spent budgetary allocations in 
the sum of R3.3 billion on an above-plan volume of broadcasting 
of original programs. To this day, the company has not fulfilled 
paragraph seven of the Edict of the President of the Russian 
Federation of 18 December 1993 No. 2206 "On Urgent Measures of 
Support of State Television and Radio Broadcasting" in the part 
on submitting proposals to the Government of the Russian 
Federation in a month's time on possible reductions in the 
volume of television and radiobroadcasting. 
  The question of payment of costs associated with 
broadcasting 
programs of the first television channel, the first radio 
program, and the Mayak programs to the CIS countries and the 
near abroad has not been resolved, and all expenditures to this 
day are being paid from the Russian Federation budget. They 
amounted to R18.5 billion in 1993. Moreover, at the outset of 
this year there is an indebtedness in the sum of R10 billion. 
  The RGTRK Ostankino is engaged in commercial activity in an 
extremely ineffective way, and in a number of cases it is even 
conducting it to the detriment of its own interests. Advertising 
in television and radio broadcasting, which is one of the main 
sources of commercial income of the company, is arranged in a 
practically uncontrolled way. It was only in May 1993 that the 
main advertising-commercial directorate was established. 
However, up to the present time the work associated with 
advertising is conducted by different structural subdivisions 
independently. The absence of a unified system of accounting and 
control does not allow the availability of reliable data on the 
resources the company receives from advertising activity. Cases 
of advertising time established by contracts being exceeded by 
the television company VID, the producer firm Master TV, and 
other studios were revealed. 
  In 1993 cases were allowed in which budgetary allocations 
were allotted to subdivisions without taking into account 
resources that they received from commercial activity. Thus, the 
board of directors of television programs was allocated R38 
million at a time when the expenditures of the studio were fully 
covered thanks to income received from advertising activity. 
Just as heedlessly, R21 million were allocated to Radio 
Podmoskovye. A selective audit conducted in five studios 
established cases of nonpayment for placed advertising as far 
back as 1992 for a total sum of R45 million. In 1993 the 
indebtedness amounted to R441 million. 
  It was only in December 1993 that the leadership of the 
company signed orders in which an attempt was made at 
systematization, accounting, and regulation of advertising 
activity, a statute was approved on the broadcasting advertising 
activity of the RGTRK Ostankino and the minimum calculation for 
advertising, and periods were established for effective rates. 
  In 1993 the yield from commercial activity totaled R11.2 
billion, although, according to an expert estimate of the 
Sociological Center, just for showing advertising RGTRK 
Ostankino should have received a profit of no less than R60 
billion. This estimate is corroborated by the results of an 
audit of activity associated with the purchase of licenses for 
the right to show television serials by way of allocation 
instead of advertising time. 
  As was shown by the terms of a contract concluded on 16 
February 1993 by I.E. Malashenko, acting chairman of the 
company, with the advertising agency (RA) Premyer SV, in 
cooperation for the purchase from the WORLD VISION Company of 
the rights to show the television serial "Twin Peaks" and the 
organization of its showing on the RGTRK Ostankino channel, 
RGTRK Ostankino would have been able to receive R1.3 billion. In 
the contract, without the appropriate economic calculations, 
this agency was granted 120 minutes of advertising time in all 
30 episodes of the film, which according to the most minimal 
calculations amounts to about R596 million, while the total cost 
of renting the film is R159 million. What is more, the RA 
Premyer SV was given exclusive right of selection and placement 
of advertising in time belonging to the company (180 minutes) 
with estimated discounts of 30 percent, as a result of which the 
agency envisions additional income in the sum of R273 million. 
In 1993, in the course of the implementation of the contract, at 
the fault of the RA Premyer SV, 27 minutes of the company's 
advertising time was not used, in connection with which it did 
not receive a sum of R205 million. However, for shifting the 
dates of the showing of the television serial in the period of 
the preelection campaign, the Premyer SV advertising agency 
suddenly demanded an additional 69 minutes of advertising time, 
which could bring it income on the order of R393 million. 
Despite the fact that this violation was the result of "force 
majeure" circumstances and was associated with the necessity to 
implement Edict of the President of the Russian Federation of 29 
October 1993 No. 1792, the company unconditionally satisfied the 
claims of the agency. In addition, it paid for the services of 
the Ministry of Communications of Russia in the amount of R57 
million for actually used advertising time. 
  The contracts of 7 October 1993 were signed on these very 
conditions on behalf of the company by V.V. Lazutkin, the deputy 
chairman, with the same RA Premyer SV for showing the television 
serials "Don Ogast," "Streets of San Francisco," and "Wild 
Rose," 225 episodes all told. 
  Only four television serials out of more than 100 films 
acquired by the Cinema Program Studio in 1993 were involved in 
the audit, and the loss to the company will total more than 
R12.3 billion, which basically goes into the income of the RA 
Premyer SV. 
  With the connivance of the leadership of the RGTRK 
Ostankino, 
the activity of the commercial enterprises that were established 
by subdivisions of the company was allowed to drift. According 
to the status at the beginning of 1994, the founders did not 
have data available on the number of enterprises and the sums of 
payments submitted to their charter fund. Incomes from the 
activity of the commercial structures are not coming to the 
company. 
  During the audit of the RGTRK Ostankino, an examination was 
made of the television company VID, the Intervid corporation, 
the Television Technical Center, the enterprises Vzglyad, 
Telechannel 2X2, TV Service, Cooperation, and a number of others 
that are directly associated with television and radio 
broadcasting and that cooperate with the company. 
  It has been established that individual enterprises are 
indebted to the company for the payment of services, and cases 
of nonpayment of taxes were also disclosed. In accordance with 
legislation in force, they were charged with additional payments 
to the budget for a total sum of R1.1 billion. 
  The question of the conduct of editing-publishing activity 
in 
the issuance of a television and radio press product has not 
been decided. A dispute of the leadership of the company and the 
editorial offices of the newspaper SEM DNEY, and the journals 
KRUGOZOR, KOLOBOK, and TELERADIOEFIR that are part of its 
structure, has been going on for practically all of 1993 with 
the joint-stock company RTV-press. 
  Court examination of the complaint of V.I. Bragin, former 
chairman of RGTRK Ostankino, continued for almost a year. In 
addition, the Higher Court of Arbitration handed down several 
judicial decisions. At the present time the statement on filing 
a protest was recalled from the court by A.N. Yakovlev, acting 
chairman of the company. The dispute has remained unsettled, 
although the State Committee for Management of State Property of 
Russia illegally adopted a directive of 31 December 1992 
No.1313-r on the creation of RTV-press in the form of a 
joint-stock company of the open type with the right of 
subsequent increase of the authorized capital by means of 
additional issuances of stock. The State Committee for the 
Management of State Property of Russia, not being a founder of 
the newspaper SEM DNEY, and the journals KOLOBOK, KRUGOZOR and 
TELERADIOEFIR, did not have the right to be in charge of them, 
and also to establish, as envisioned by Directive of the 
Government of the Russian Federation of 2 December 1993 No. 
2171, an enterprise of a mixed form of property. The collectives 
of the editorial offices of the indicated publications, awaiting 
a final decision, were idle; however, about R110 million of 
budget resources were expended on their maintenance. 
  The printing equipment of the Berthold firm, costing about 
DM2 million, was bought in January 1992 for resources allocated 
by the Ministry of Finance of Russia at the request of Ye.V. 
Yakovlev (former chairman of the company), allegedly to reequip 
the television apparatus, was transferred to the TOO [limited 
responsibility company] RT-press, and afterwards--to the 
joint-stock company RTV-press. From the moment of acquisition, 
this equipment has been on the balance sheet of the company, and 
the sum of deductions for depreciation totaled R28 million for 
1993 alone. 
  Contractual discipline is at an extremely low level. During 
1992-1993 no procedure was established in the company for 
concluding contracts, and no record of them was maintained. In 
the past year the main personnel directorate of the company 
disclosed 115 unregistered contracts; however, it was not until 
August 1993 that an order was published on the introduction of a 
single register of legal documents. Frequently, contracts in 
behalf of the company are signed by managers of its structural 
subdivisions who do not have the appropriate authority; 
contracts are often drawn up without juridical study, they do 
not contain conditions that regulate the responsibility of the 
parties and the effective dates, they do not establish the 
procedure for their cancellation, and they frequently are of a 
declaratory nature. 
  Up to the present time, the RGTRK Ostankino has not 
concluded 
a contract between the company and its main partner--the 
Television Technical Center. The main editorial board of the 
musical broadcasting studio Radio-1 frequently concluded 
commercial transactions without their written formulation. On 5 
July of last year A.L. Razbash, former director of the creative 
arts association Eksperiment, now the deputy chairman of the 
company, concluded a contract on behalf of the RGTRK Ostankino 
with the television company VID for the production of the 
Capital-Show television program "Field of Miracles" in 1993, 
without having the power of attorney to do so. According to the 
status on 1 February of this year, the television company VID 
has an indebtedness to the company of R52 million, and another 
R70 million had to be exacted in the form of fines for delayed 
payments. This program continues to be shown despite the absence 
of a contract and unpaid debts. 
  It has been established that some contracts not only do not 
protect the economic interests of the company but are simply not 
profitable for it. Thus, on 7 October 1993 the children and 
youth programs studio of the RGTRK Ostankino concluded a 
contract with INMAK, a joint-stock company of the closed type, 
and the Association of Assistance to the Development of 
Children's Television (limited company), for the showing of 
advertising subjects of the joint-stock company INMAK. At the 
same time, the transfer of monetary resources is supposed to be 
made, according to this contract, to the current account of the 
association, which is not part of the company's structure. 
  A contract concluded on 12 July 1993 between the RGTRK 
Ostankino (former deputy chairman Yu.N. Bandura) and the firm 
Jeronimo LTD concerning cooperation in the purchase of rights to 
show film products of Western Europe and the United States, and 
also the organization of their showing on company channels, 
envisions the payment of income from advertising during the 
showing of films to the current accounts of foreign firms. 
  In accordance with a "Supplement to a Gentleman's Agreement" 
drawn up on 24 July 1993 by Yu.N. Bandura, former deputy 
chairman of the RGTRK Ostankino, and Mr. I. Amors, president of 
the enterprise Ostankino Development, 100 minutes of advertising 
time will be transferred from this enterprise to the company at 
a price of $3,000. Thus, the enterprise sold the company a 
"commodity" that it did not own officially. Nevertheless, on the 
instructions of the former leadership of the RGTRK Ostankino 
(V.I. Bragin and Yu.N. Bandura), in October 1993 the company 
transferred $300,000 to the account of this enterprise. 
  In 1993 the RGTRK Ostankino (former chairman V.I. Bragin) 
concluded a contract with the TOO Kamaka on the rerecording by 
the firm of television materials with the subsequent sale of the 
right of showing them by commercial television companies. In the 
period from July to December of 1993, the TOO Kamaka transferred 
to the company 360 cassettes with 432 programs from which 382 
were taken from the State Television and Radio Fund. The firm 
received R25 million for this work; i.e., resources were spent 
on the rerecording of programs already available in the state 
fund. To the present time, the company is not receiving income 
from this contract. 
  The RGTRK Ostankino also does not have any kind of profits 
from a transaction concluded back in 1992 with the American 
corporation U.S.S.U. Arts Group, which was granted the exclusive 
right to the use of recordings of productions of classical music 
stored in the archives of the State Television and Radio Fund. 
  On 16 January 1994, the "Aleksandr-Show," or "30 Years Ago" 
program, went on the air. Of the R67 million that were spent on 
the creation of this program, R40 million were allocated to the 
enterprise AMiK by the leadership of the company at the request 
of A.L. Razbash, who was at that time director of the 
Eksperiment association. The letter reported that the program 
will represent a story about television's past and present, but 
not the traditional anniversary celebration, and, in addition, 
there would be no commercials. But in reality, almost eight 
minutes of advertising time was set into the program. Even with 
a minimum estimate of the cost of one minute of advertising 
amounting to $12,000, this firm should receive an income of 
$96,000. But the company incurred only the expenses, inasmuch 
as, according to the contract concluded with the AMiK firm in 
1993 on behalf of the RGTRK Ostankino by I.M. Podzigun, who was 
then the deputy director of the Eksperiment creative arts 
association, no stipulation on advertising time for the company 
was made. 
  The reorganization of the Russian television system and the 
emergence in this connection of several state and independent 
television companies entailed serious problems that required 
their resolution on a legislative basis. Thus, the television 
companies entered into a competitive battle between themselves 
for an expansion of the viewing audience, often not taking the 
interests of the viewers into account. For example, the first 
channel of RGTRK Ostankino traditionally shows the main part of 
"Novosti" at 2100, and the All-Russian State Television and 
Radio Company on the second channel starts to show the next of 
the "Santa Barbara" series, or the rubric "Detective on 
Mondays." But during the Olympic Games in France in 1992 these 
companies transmitted the opening and the closing of the games 
simultaneously. 
  The fact that the election blocs were in an unequal position 
during the preelection campaign can also be tied to the 
reorganization of state television. Thus, the blocs Civic Union 
in Behalf of the Stabilization of Justice and Progress, the 
Liberal-Democratic Party of Russia, and the Civic Club used more 
than 70 minutes of air time each, paying for these services in a 
timely way. At the same time, the Party of Russian Unity and 
Accord and the Democratic Party of Russia blocs and others have 
not yet been able to make payment even for the 14 and 24 minutes 
respectively of air time granted them. 
  Up to the present time, a founders' contract has not been 
concluded between the Government of the Russian Federation and 
the RGTRK Ostankino that should regulate the mutual relations 
between the founder and the company, which is envisioned by the 
statute on the Russian State Television and Radio Company 
Ostankino approved by Edict of the President of the Russian 
Federation 2 April 1992 No. 421 "On Guarantees of Information 
Stabilization in the Activity of the Russian State Television 
and Radio Company Ostankino." The lack of a unified concept in 
the sphere of state television and radiobroadcasting has led to 
the direction of activity of the company being basically 
determined by the position of its leadership, but often also by 
the broadcasting studios themselves. 
  The former leadership of the RGTRK Ostankino mainly paid 
attention in its activity to structural changes, without taking 
the necessary measures to reduce losses from the republic 
budget. Thus, analysis of the orders adopted in 1993, when V.I. 
Bragin was chairman of the company, showed that about 90 percent 
of them constituted orders on changing the structure and 
personnel lists of the subdivisions. Continuous changes led 
mainly to superfluous numbers. Thus, in the television studios 
in 1993, given a reduction in the volume of broadcasting in 
comparison with 1991 of almost one-third, personnel were cut by 
only 17 percent. In addition, the company not only reduced the 
volume of broadcasting but also lost program quality. 
  With the establishment of the RGTRK Ostankino, by Edict of 
the President of the Russian Federation of 27 December 1991 No. 
331 "On the Television and Radio Company Ostankino," all 
associations, enterprises, and organizations that were 
liquidated by the All-Union State Television and Radio 
Broadcasting Company located on the territory of the Russian 
Federation were included in its structure. In the last two 
years, with the participation of the former leaders, the company 
has been deprived of practically all its buildings, equipment, 
and other property, but the main thing is the Television 
Technical Center. As a result of the reorganization conducted, 
the balance sheet of the RGTRK Ostankino now has only half of 
the production area in building 25 on Pyatnitskaya Street. 
Because of lack of premises the company was forced to rent an 
area in the Television Technical Center in building 12 on 
Koroleva Street. 
  For the purpose of eliminating the noted deficiencies, it is 
advisable to send the auditing materials to the leadership of 
the RGTRK Ostankino for the adoption of measures.

<F P=106> [Article by Georgiy Ovcharenko: "`Telepaths' at Ostankino </F>
Television and Radio Company Accused Irina Mishina of `Negative 
Vibes' and Removed Her From Broadcasts. Jurists See This 
Escapade As Arbitrariness and a Violation of Human Rights"] 
  [Text] Fragile, with huge green eyes--truly a 
"creature of air," as newspaper reporters nicknamed her--she 
asked for the third time: "If a television anchor disappears, it 
means somebody wants it, does it not?" 
  The history of her excommunication from live 
broadcasting is so incomprehensible, paradoxical, simply stupid, 
and mean that it all looks like the theater of absurd. 
  For the uninitiated, I will recount the chronicle of 
the scandal. 
  On 4 October of last year Irina Mishina, an ITA [Independent 
Television Agency] commentator and "Novosti" program anchor, was 
hit on the head by a truncheon brandished by a man in field 
fatigues: Either he did not recognize the "creature of air" or 
he was so stoned from the blood spilled the day before that he 
was no longer aware who he was hitting. Despite the pain, Irina 
covered the cuts with makeup and the next day broadcast live, 
anchoring the "Novosti" as precisely and professionally as usual. 
  The trauma turned out to be more serious than the journalist 
had suspected, however. A week later she fainted in the middle 
of the street. Only on 8 December did doctors permit her to 
resume work. Returning to Ostankino, however, she learned that 
during her illness ITA Director Boris Nepomnyashchiy and 
Editor-in-Chief Oleg Tochilin had decided to remove her from 
direct broadcasting and the anchor job at "Novosti." At first 
she did not believe it, especially considering that the decree 
(which, by the way, nobody has seen to this day) was not made 
available to her. She attempted to explain. Nepomnyashchiy told 
Irina in the presence of witnesses that she allegedly exuded a 
"bad aura and negative vibes, which negatively affect her work." 
The director also blamed Mishina for a large number of newspaper 
materials about her: She was making herself a "star," he said. 
  That the accusations are laughable is obvious. Can someone 
please tell me according to what parameters and instruments does 
Nepomnyashchiy determine the aura of his subordinates? And what 
this has to do with the work of a television commentator 
altogether? 
  Meanwhile, according to Ostankino's sociological services, 
Mishina, with her "bad aura" and "negative vibes," even after 
not doing live broadcasts for four months, securely maintains 
her rating among the best anchors of information and political 
programs. I personally saw the results of the poll in which 
television viewers rated Irina fourth, placing her ahead of A. 
Lyubimov, A. Politkovskiy, S. Medvedev, and other popular names 
in television. "When Irina Mishina is on the air, it is like the 
sun comes out in the apartment," a cable from one of her viewers 
read. Such is the aura of this anchor removed from live 
broadcasts. 
  But perhaps the "creature of air" has indeed been struck by 
"star syndrome" and her colleagues refuse to work with her? Why 
then are they, of all people, calling the newspaper and asking 
that Irina be protected from bureaucratic arbitrariness? 
  No, no matter how you look at it, there are loose ends in 
the 
statements of the high-ranking amateur telepaths from ITA. But 
there has to be a real reason why Mishina has been 
excommunicated, does there not? Together with her, I attempted 
to validate several of my own versions. 
  The first: political motives. As long ago as 23 September, 
out of the blue, MOSKOVSKIY KOMSOMOLETS called Mishina an 
"anti-Yeltsin commentator" and predicted that she would soon 
part with television viewers. 
  "Nonsense!" Irina rejected this version outright. "I have no 
political preferences. A journalist can have only one 
conviction: the truth, and only the truth." 
  This, by the way, was confirmed by the weekly SOBESEDNIK, 
which said this about Mishina: "She is not a flaming democrat 
but certainly not a conservative. She takes a 
middle-of-the-road, calm position that is shared by the majority 
of the population." But perhaps this is precisely the position 
that is not to the liking of the ITA leadership? 
  Second version: an unsociable, quarrelsome personality. 
  "Translated from Greek, Irina means peace. This is the way I 
am in real life," says Mishina. Then, after a pause, she 
confesses: "When it comes to work, however, I have rather strict 
criteria, and when I see unprofessional work I do not keep my 
mouth shut." 
  That, of course, is true. The crisis Ostankino television is 
going through is painful for Irina. In her opinion, Ostankino is 
currently taking a back seat to NTV [Independent Television] and 
the Russian Television Channel; the quality of the "Novosti" 
program has also declined. She is not keeping her opinion 
secret: In summer last year she published an article on this 
topic in SEGODNYA under the eloquent title "News Inside Out." 
Her opinion was shared by many television viewers: While in the 
fall the "Novosti" rating was 70 percent, by spring it had 
plunged to 23 percent. What boss would tolerate a subordinate 
whose public criticism may cost him his job?! 
  In the conversation with Irina, however, another version 
came 
out, which seems most convincing to me. ITA director Boris 
Nepomnyashchiy once suggested three stories for "Novosti" which 
were a poor disguise for hidden advertising. In her habitual 
manner, Mishina told the director her opinion on the subject 
after the broadcast. Moreover, she gave an interview to 
MEGAPOLIS-EKSPRESS. This probably was the beginning of her 
troubles with the ITA leadership. 
  [Ovcharenko] Irina, have you tried to see Aleksandr 
Nikolayevich Yakovlev, who is acting chairman of the Ostankino 
television company? 
  [Mishina] Of course. I wrote a memorandum to him, but he has 
not found the time to see me. 
  [Ovcharenko] Do you go to work? 
  [Mishina] I do. I have not been fired--only removed from 
live 
broadcasts. I do voice-over commentary; a few days ago, for the 
first time in the last two months, I was assigned to film a 
story for Consumer Rights Protection Day. [end Mishina] 
  An interesting detail: This story was first assigned to a 
20-year-old student-intern who, unlike the commentator Mishina, 
has a permanent desk and a telephone. The student's name is 
Konstantin Tochilin. As the reader may already have guessed, he 
is the son of the editor in chief. Vladimir, B.V. 
Nepomnyashchiy's son, has also found a home at ITA. 
  [Ovcharenko] Were you insulted by this assignment? 
  [Mishina] What do you think? I miss the work, though, and I 
will do the story. Probably no worse than Kostya would have. 
  [Ovcharenko] You now have a lot of free time. How do you 
spend it? 
  [Mishina] I work. Conceive new programs. One is practically 
ready. It could be a program unique for our television. Together 
with Andrey Plakhov, the producer of "Before and After 
Midnight," we thought it through down to the smallest detail. 
There is a team that sees only me as the anchor of this program. 
But nobody listens to us; nobody needs my know-how. You see, I 
wanted to see Yakovlev not to cry on his shoulder but to offer 
him an innovation. After all, he did give Politkovskiy and 
Lyubimov a chance, did he not?! Me, however, he did not want to 
talk to. A pity!... [end Mishina] 
  She is indeed a "creature of air." But not because she 
weighs 
48 kg and resembles the Snow Maiden in appearance. No, it does 
not look as if she would "melt" in the hottest situation. Irina 
has been an independent being since childhood; she has always 
earned her own living, and she is considered a strong 
personality. N. Tarayan's material in the weekly TV-REVIEW, 
which stated that Mishina had attempted to commit suicide, is 
slander, according to Irina. She is a "creature of air" because 
live broadcasting is not a narcotic for her--it is the air 
without which she cannot live. So she carries in her purse a 
sizable notebook which is already bursting with ideas and 
proposals nobody wants. 
  It is an absurd situation. Irina is loved and supported by 
television viewers; she wants to, and can, do highly 
professional work; but she is not even given a chance to present 
her side. After recovering from her illness, she spent three 
hours waiting in Oleg Tochilin's reception room for the sake of 
a three-minute conversation which resulted in nothing. Perhaps 
the court may change the ITA leadership's position? 
  No, Mishina herself was not appealing for court justice. 
Tatyana Kofanova, director of the De-JureK company, found her 
after reading the press materials and literally pushed Irina 
into signing a contract on protection of her rights and dignity. 
This is how the court complaint "in the interests of citizen 
Irina Anatolyevna Mishina" on the "unwarranted actions of 
officials" came about. In Kofanova's opinion, everything that is 
happening to Irina is pure arbitrariness, a violation of labor 
laws and human rights. But is it worth elevating the conflict 
all the way to the court? 
  I pose this question to you, Aleksandr Nikolayevich. You are 
known as a man of truly democratic convictions. Perhaps it would 
make sense to first listen to the person? After all, Irina is 
longing to work, not complain... 
<H8>  * * * </H8>
  P.S. By the way, Aleksandr Nikolayevich, you may also 
invite Tatyana Vedeneva to come over at the same time. Yes, she 
left Ostankino of her own volition. But only after an action had 
been initiated to move her to a position as editor-consultant 
without the right to work on live broadcasts. In essence, she 
was forced to leave, as was Irina Mishina. Also because of a 
"bad aura?"

<F P=106> [Article by Gennadiy Shilin: "The Nonpayments Crisis. Nerves </F>
of Energy Sector Workers Like Taut Wires"] 
  [Text] "Close to critical" is what the president of 
the RAO [Russian Joint-Stock Company] YeES Rossii, Anatoliy 
Dyakov, called the condition of the Russian energy sector last 
Saturday when speaking at a conference of directors of regional 
energy systems and representatives of industrial enterprises. 
Also attending the conference were officials from the Ministry 
of Finance and the Ministry of Economics of the Russian 
Federation. 
  The nonpayments crisis, which by 19 March 1993 had exceeded 
4.5 trillion rubles [R], the decline in the volumes of repair 
and construction work because of the lack of financing, which is 
unprecedented in the history of the branch, the catastrophic 
reduction of fuel reserves, and the chronic interruptions in 
their deliveries because of those same nonpayments have led to a 
situation where, as the RAO president stated, "Unless extreme 
measures are taken within five months at most, a cataclysmic 
destruction of Russia's electric energy sector will begin." 
  These and other problems touched upon during the course of 
the conference are not new--the press and television have 
devoted enough attention to them recently. There have been 
serious attempts to figure out the real state of affairs and, 
unfortunately, there has also been a desire on the part of 
certain politicians and journalists to present energy sector 
workers in the eyes of the republic as being almost to blame for 
the crisis that has gripped the country's economy. And in this 
context the conference in the Ministry of Fuel and Energy had an 
extraordinary task. Perhaps it could be considered to be the 
first serious attempt on the part of professionals of diverse 
but interconnected branches of our economy to find not the 
"extreme" but a way out of a difficult situation. 
  "Of course the energy sector is profitable, as is the entire 
fuel and energy complex of which it is a part," stated Fuel and 
Energy Minister Yuriy Shafranik. "After all, 62 percent of the 
revenue side of the state budget is provided by the fuel and 
energy complex. The crisis of the energy sector is a result of 
the overall decline of production. But there are a number of 
circumstances that exacerbate the situation that has developed." 
  Among the main ones the minister mentioned the problem of 
nonpayments and the absence of a strict approach on the part of 
the Ministry of Finance and the Ministry of Economics toward 
industrial consumers of electric energy who violate financial 
discipline, the poorly developed system of rates, the tax 
policy, which so far does nothing to encourage production, and 
the imperfect legislative base regulating processes in the 
branch. 
  "We are working hard on these problems," said Deputy Finance 
Minister of Russia Aleksandr Samusef in his speech. "In order to 
solve the nonpayments problem it is extremely necessary even in 
the near future to work out a mechanism whereby the enterprises 
will receive money for the products they release. To do this we 
must expand their rights and capabilities of collecting debts." 
  As we know, during the years of perestroyka and the 
"post-perestroyka period" there was no shortage of attempts to 
"cure" the Russian economy through the implementation of various 
"programs," "concepts," and "models." The electric energy sector 
got its share as well. The press, and particularly RABOCHAYA 
TRIBUNA, has already written about the fact that the Ministry of 
Finance distributed to the local regions a document which 
originated from within it (as a draft edict from the president 
of Russia), according to which it was planned to redistribute a 
block of shares of the recently created joint-stock company YeES 
Rossii. In essence they were planning an illegal revision of a 
joint-stock company that had already been created, directly in 
violation the edicts of the president of the Russian Federation 
Nos. 923 and 1334 on the creation of joint-stock companies, 
which would lead to fragmentation of the country's unique 
consolidated energy complex into small regional systems. 
  "Why does everything have to be divided up?" asked General 
Director of the Dalenergo Joint-Stock Company Yuriy Basharov in 
his speech. "We do not need fragments today, let us complete the 
work on the mechanism we have been creating for two years." One 
can question the acceptability of various viewpoints--of the 
Ministry of Finance or of the energy sector workers--but one 
cannot but agree with the reply of the Minister Yuriy Shafranik 
regarding the proposals of the Ministry of Finance: 
  "When the position of the Ministry of Finance is clear to 
itself but incomprehensible to thousands of practical 
specialists--this is dangerous, and it is worth thinking about. 
The effectiveness of the energy sector comes not from the 
creation of joint-stock companies but from other mechanisms. 
  "During the long years of existence and continuous operation 
of the branch, all of us, including energy sector workers 
themselves, have failed to think about such categories as 
energy-intensiveness of industrial production or the proportion 
of electric energy in the price of the final product; problems 
of economizing on energy basically amounted to sanctimonious 
appeals: `When you are through working--turn off your knife 
switch' or `When leaving, turn off the lights.' 
  "Why, for example, do we use 400 kilowatt-hours of electric 
energy to produce a tonne of ammonia while in the West this 
takes 30-80? 
  "Why is the proportion of electric energy in the price of a 
tonne of aluminum only 15 percent here, but the branch is blamed 
for the sharp increase in prices of metal and, ultimately, for 
the loss of the positions of Russian producers of aluminum in 
the world market?" 
  "Energy sector workers are prepared to work and carry out 
their task under the condition that their primary immediate 
problems are solved," emphasized Anatoliy Dyakov, president of 
the RAO YeES Rossii, in his final statement. "This is necessary 
for Russia. The internal reserves of the energy sector are 
exhausted. Today we must, not in words but in deeds, document 
and carry out priority development of the electric energy 
sector."

<F P=106> [Article by Vladimir Chernyshev, RABOCHAYA TRIBUNA economic </F>
observer: "Timely Topics. GAZ Will Not Raise Its Hand"] 
  [Text] The serious passions seething in Nizhniy 
Novgorod regarding the change in the procedure for privatization 
of the GAZ Automotive Plant could possibly open up new chapters 
in the Russian transition to the market. The collective has 
protested the "anti-plant" decision of the State Committee for 
Administration of State Property of the Russian Federation--to 
give the state a controlling 20-percent block of shares while 
the plant workers have to be satisfied with 15 percent. 
  Yuriy Kulemin, chairman of the trade union committee, 
explains the position of the workers: 
  "We were simply deceived, because, according to the 
previously approved privatization plan, the state structures 
were to have owned only one out of 10 shares. Therefore before 
the adoption of the unfortunate decision, 120,000 of our 
engineers, specialists, and workers were quite satisfied with 
the role of being in charge with the right to a decisive vote. 
Now all of them intend to defend their constitutional right to 
manage their own property. As a first step we have appealed to 
the court." 
  It is clear that GAZ has become a desired object of 
privatization for many structures that intend to divide the 
single giant into parts. Now 430 modern Volgas come from the 
conveyor each day instead of 280. Last year alone the production 
of motor vehicles increased by 27,000. They are increasing the 
output of diesel trucks, children's bicycles, washing machines, 
and other industrial products and they have filled orders for 
various kinds of military equipment. They have received 319 
billion rubles [R] in net profit, which remains at the disposal 
at the enterprise, of which R189 billion has been invested in 
further development of production and the social sphere. 
Including about R60 billion which has been assimilated in the 
form of capital investments in modernization and reconstruction 
of production and preparation for series production of the 
high-class diesel 1.5-tonne GAZ-3302. 
  The automotive plant workers intend to transform their 
"automotive state" into a joint-stock company in the form of a 
powerful transnational corporation called GAZ which functions 
aggressively on domestic and foreign automotive markets. And the 
structure of the joint-stock portfolio, which balances the 
interests of the state and the producers, has given evidence to 
the birth of almost the first financial-industrial group in 
Russia. Effective the middle of 1994 on its basis in Nizhniy 
Novgorod there should arise a seat of stability and confident 
economic growth. After all, automotive construction means dozens 
of industrial enterprises, trade, transportation, service, 
banks, VUZ's [higher educational institutions], science, and 
many other things all bound together into a single unit. 
  The main guarantee of the feasibility of such plans, let us 
recall, was that the association could retain the controlling 
block of shares. But frequent examples of "seizure," whereby 
maneuvers with the transfer of blocks of securities from state 
into private hands have led to a loss of independence by large 
Russian enterprises, have forced the automotive plant workers to 
take defensive measures. 
  The Nizhniy Novgorod automotive giant organized a brilliant 
and instantaneous financial operation through its subsidiary 
firm GAZinvest. It organized the purchase of vouchers with money 
from the privatization fund for workers and pensioners, and the 
checks were turned over the GAZinvest. Waiting until, in keeping 
with Russian laws, the state put up 50 percent of the plant's 
shares for sale through auction, GAZinvest participated in the 
auction in keeping with the interests of the workers of the 
collective and the board of directors functioned smoothly as 
well. 
  Numerous partners from Moscow, St. Petersburg, and some of 
the other largest industrial centers of Russia helped the 
automotive plant to hold out. Now it would be impossible to sell 
out the flourishing plant no matter what happens. And this is 
where it all began. 
  The first round of artillery fire was directed at the plant 
by the State Committee for the Administration of State Property, 
which issued its January decision to establish a controlling 
20-percent share for the state. The governor of Nizhniy Novgorod 
Oblast, Boris Nemtsov, sent the government of the Russian 
Federation a letter concerning violations of existing 
legislation when conducting the check auction for sale of shares 
in the GAZ Joint-Stock Company. As a result there appeared a 
directive from the government to declare the check auction for 
the sale of shares in the GAZ Joint-Stock Company null and void. 
  Additionally, the government directive ordered all 
stockholders to "raise their hands" when voting for removal of 
the general director of the GAZ Joint-Stock Company, Boris 
Vidyayev, from the position he held. As is customary in such 
cases, the procuracy was given the corresponding instructions. 
In brief, thunder clouds hung over the automotive plant at the 
end of March. 
  It was almost impossible to get a call through to Vidyayev 
himself. He was busy with the production: conference calls, 
planning sessions, business meetings, visits to the 
shops...finally the general director picked up the receiver. He 
commented briefly on the situation: 
  "The accusations that were made are contrived and 
irresponsible. Any unprejudiced audit or legal investigation 
will confirm the legality of our actions, which were aimed at 
preventing the plant from being bought up by unwanted masters. 
The workers simply will not stand for such a turn of events. 
They are the ones who are now the owners of the joint-stock 
capital, which makes it possible for all of us to look 
confidently to the future with the hope of the rebirth of 
Russia." 
  Boris Vidyayev says that he anticipated such a turn of 
events 
and accusations of personal financial transgressions. Because he 
will have to take the first blow personally. In the bookkeeping 
office, in his words, everything is crystal clear and he himself 
is blameless before his workers and Russia. But his enemies have 
still decided to find criminal activity elsewhere. The plant, 
they say, has spent money on acquiring vouchers while the 
enterprise was late with its payments to the budget. Well, so 
what? If the deferment was permitted, it was permitted. The 
money went into the budget, but money likes to circulate. We 
must judge not those for whom the ruble is working, but those 
for whom it is a dead weight. 
  So far the Ministry of Industry of the Russian Federation 
has 
refused to comment on the situation, referring to the need to 
fulfill government directives. One of the workers, who asked 
that his name be withheld, said there were no charges against 
the current leadership of the Nizhniy Novgorod automotive plant 
and added that in Russia today enterprising and resourceful 
directors should be rewarded and not punished. Otherwise, there 
will be no rebirth. 
  In all probability subsequent events will take the most 
unexpected turn for all parties. Only the State Committee for 
Administration of State Property and the Nizhniy Novgorod 
governor's office have had their say in this story. Then the 
story went into the press with one-sided criminal overtones. 
Until the judicial investigation is over, the workers have 
sensibly decided not to raise an unnecessary fuss and to return 
to the shops. 
  I think they share the initial goals of privatization: To 
help the reborn Russia and not to destroy production that is 
already prospering and not to divide it into juicy morsels to be 
swallowed up by the sharks of international business. 
  So far nobody has heard the true voice of the collective of 
120,000, the real owners. According to existing evidence the 
permanent body of workers and engineers intend to defend firmly 
and without compromise their right to be truly and not just 
apparently in charge. So far this is the only positive result of 
privatization and, possibly, new chapters in its history. When 
it is the working people who are interested in the preservation, 
growth, and flourishing of their property. 
<H8>  * * * </H8>
  P.S. After this article was already prepared for the 
press we received the following report. On 25 March the High 
Arbitration Court of the Russian Federation adopted an 
affirmative decision regarding the complaint of the GAZ 
Joint-Stock Company: "On declaring the directive of the State 
Committee for Administration of State Property of the Russian 
Federation of 19 January 1994, No. 121-R, to be not in keeping 
with legislation and violating the rights and interests of the 
GAZ Joint-Stock Company which are protected by law." 
  As they say, the factories--to the workers, the 
land--to the peasants, and the law--to the people. On this we 
stand.

<F P=106> [Article by the organizing committee for preparing for and </F>
conducting 1 May measures: "The 1 May Holiday Will Always Remain 
with You"] 
  [Text] The FITUR [Federation of Independent Trade 
Unions of Russia] appeals to trade union organizations and 
workers of the country. 
  1 May is approaching--a day of workers' solidarity and 
protection of the rights of workers. 
  We are celebrating it in a difficult period in the life of 
the country. The broad masses of people are concerned about the 
unstable socioeconomic and political situation, the cataclysmic 
decline of production, and the growing unemployment. Voices of 
protest against the impoverishment of immense segments of the 
population and the grossest violations of the constitutional 
rights of people related to failure to pay wages for many 
months, the curtailment of social programs, and the outbreak of 
crime--these voices are becoming ever louder. 
  The president, the parliament, the government, and various 
sociopolitical forces are calling for Russia to achieve 
universal civil accord as the main condition for the country's 
emergence from the deep economic and social crisis, in the name 
of stable movement toward a better life for us. 
  Trade unions of the FITUR support the idea of civil peace as 
the only way of avoiding a national catastrophe. We are 
convinced that the real path to this accord is an immediate and 
effective solution to the most critical social problems. 
  Based on the growing mass demands of the workers, we 
consider 
it necessary to adopt emergency measures which should provide 
for: 
  --an end to the decline of production through changing 
the tax policy, supporting the domestic entrepreneur, and 
solving problems of mutual nonpayments; 
  --a guarantee of full and prompt payment of wages with 
indexation according to the indebtedness; 
  --the adoption of a state employment program that 
prevents the threat of mass unemployment; 
  --security for citizens on a firm legislative basis. 
  We call for the trade union organizations, labor 
collectives, and all workers to support these demands. 
  Through active participation in the 1 May measures we 
will demonstrate the unity and solidarity of working people in 
their fight for their rights!

<F P=106> [Article by Viktor Ukolov: "What Miners Tried To Get in the </F>
Capital"] 
  [Text] 
<H5>  Voices From the Picket Line </H5>
  At the Krasnopreskenskaya Metro Station passengers going out 
to the street were met with a rhythmical, incomprehensible, 
alarming clatter. It came from the White House, which was 
picketed by miners who came from all over Russia. The government 
is now located there. 
  The building was painted. Traces of shelling are no longer 
visible. However, all of it is surrounded by a solid fence made 
from reinforced concrete slabs. Only a passage was left at 
Pavlik Morozov Square. The crowd stood there. Robust fellows 
continuously banged their helmets against the iron enclosure. 
The following poster was above others: "President, Miners Will 
Not Die in Silence!" 
  This is for sure. In the morning, when the masters of the 
White House walked and drove to work, they were met with such an 
angry whistle that their nerves were strained. Some people will 
say: You cannot do this. And they will be right. However, these 
sloggers, whom the government does not pay for their work and 
about whose safety in faces it is not concerned--if you are 
disabled, this is your personal problem--are much more right. 
They give it an evaluation the way they know how. To put it 
mildly, a negative evaluation. 
  General words are always just words. But every picketing 
miner has his own trouble, everyone separately is being 
strangled by the noose of the lack of money. As an example, 
several statements recorded into a dictaphone. 
  Mikhail Tarasevich, heading man at the Severnaya Mine 
(Vorkuta): 
  "Since December I have not brought any pay home. I am 
ashamed 
to be dependent on my wife for support. A loaf of bread already 
costs 670 rubles, 1 kg of meat (in fact, bones), 4,000, and a 
container of milk, 720. We skimp on everything. But my son, 
Zhenka, is 6 years old. What about him? In the kindergarten 
something still comes his way. However, the kindergarten is 
being closed--three have already been shut down. They say that 
there is nothing with which to feed the children. In our 
kindergarten, teachers, as a sign of protest, went on a hunger 
strike. A good price for reforms? 
  "And what is going on at the mine? Not a single sinking or 
mining machine was bought last year. Hence the frequency of 
accidents. Not long ago, again, someone's hand was torn off. 
Statistics know: Two lives, two deaths per 1 million tonnes of 
coal." 
  Vladimir Lyagostin, head man at the Dubrovskaya Mine 
(Tulaugol): 
  "I brought with me as proof a receipt from the accounts 
office (payroll). The state personally owes me 335,000 rubles. 
Imagine what the amount is for the entire mine and for all 
enterprises! It is no accident that many are idle. But then, 
where will the country get something for normal life? 
  "We are still working, although the mine is in a state of 
emergency. We have no timber or props. I have not received 
working clothes for 2 years. A lunch underground--this is your 
problem. I put a piece of lard in my bag--as far as bread is 
concerned, you can do without it. 
  "Recently, I sent my son, Nikolay, off to the army. He will 
be fed there. But I feel sorry for my parents, who are old 
people--they live in poverty. People no longer have any faith in 
the government." 
  Pavel Sidorov, link leader at the stoping face of the 
Chertinskaya Mine (Belovo): 
  "I have no idea how to feed my family. Money is now lent 
only 
at interest. I feel as though I am sinking deeper and deeper 
into the mud. 
  "I am also depressed by the fact that warehouses are 
overflowing with coal. Doesn't anyone need it? No, the reason is 
that railroad workers ask exorbitant rates for transportation. 
  "Recently, our colleague Viktor Vlasov was injured at 
work--he hurt his head badly. He has no money for medication!" 
  Vasiliy Lupin, head man at the Zapadnaya Kapitalnaya 
Mine (Rostovugol): 
  "Today there is one government and tomorrow, another. 
However, all of them now give preference to rogues and to 
commercial structures, not to those that are in faces. Not to 
those that lay down their lives there so that Russia does not 
freeze because of them. People in the White House should finally 
realize: They should work for us, not we for them! 
  "What we have come to! In the face there is no timber, no 
nuts, and no bolts. Earned money is not paid. I expected to buy 
a refrigerator with my 13th wages, but this is how I was 
cheated: The paycheck was stopped, but prices were doubled. I 
was left looking like a fool." 
  The Russian Committee of the Independent Trade Union of Coal 
Miners generalized miners' demands and presented them to the 
government. There is nothing supernatural in them: to pay off 
budget debts to the sector without delay, as well as to help to 
exact debts from consumer enterprises. Moreover, they must see 
the prospects at least for a year ahead. 
  The third point: Miners wanted to meet with President B.N. 
Yeltsin and head of the government V.S. Chernomyrdin. 
<H5>  And From the High Rostrum </H5>
  The meeting, although not with the former persons, was held 
in a high-rise in Novyy Arbat, in Rosugol. Deputy Premier 
Aleksandr Shokhin and Labor Minister Gennadiy Melinyan came to 
miners. Of course, Yuriy Malyshev, general director of Rosugol, 
was also there. 
  A. Shokhin informed them about the decision adopted by the 
government; first of all, about money. 
  Plans are made to finance the sector during the first half a 
year in the amount of 3.4 trillion rubles; in April, 300 billion 
rubles every week. 
  Furthermore, an interdepartmental commission is being 
established for a permanent contact of the government with 
miners. Its first task is to propose a program for the sector's 
development, including improvement of unpromising mines and 
pits. All labor collectives must clearly visualize their 
tomorrow. Finally, the government promises to adopt documents 
providing for more significant measures of support for the fuel 
and energy complex. 
  Aleksandr Nikolayevich maintained that this package of 
measures was intended for the sector's serious stabilization. 
However, this was not enough for miners. They demanded 
guarantees that tomorrow they would not be left again at the 
mercy of fate. They have already been deceived so many times! 
  "Guarantees are needed?" A. Shokhin asked again. "I am 
making 
a firm promise: If the government breaks the promises it made, I 
will resign!" 
  And what, did the audience freeze? Did it burst into 
applause 
or humbly fall silent? Nothing of the sort! Who cares today 
about someone's resignation? Will this improve our lives? 
  That is why miners began to chant: 
  "Yeltsin! Yeltsin!" 
  A break was announced. Seemingly, the ministers went to 
telephone Boris Nikolayevich. They left.... for good. 
  An hour later leaders of the Russian Coal Trade Union 
appeared at the table. They announced: Yeltsin promised to meet 
with miners in May. They proposed that the terms of truce with 
the government be accepted temporarily, but, if it violates 
them, that an all-Russian miners' strike be started immediately. 
They demonstrated their strength--workers' solidarity--very 
convincingly. 
<H5>  Incidentally </H5>
  The picketing of the White House by emissaries of labor 
collectives of the nuclear industry began yesterday.

<F P=106> [Interview with Vsevolod Generalov, first deputy chairman of </F>
the RF Committee on Metallurgy, by Viktor Andriyanov, 
correspondent of RABOCHAYA TRIBUNA; place and date not given: 
"Hot Conversion in a Hot Shop"] 
  [Text] We introduce the person we interviewed. 
  Vsevolod Aleksandrovich Generalov began his labor 
activity as a worker at the lead-zinc combine in 
Ust-Kamenogorsk. He graduated from the Metallurgical Faculty of 
the Kazakh Polytechnical Institute. He was an operator, a 
smelter, a furnace attendant, a foreman, a senior foreman, and a 
shop chief. In the hot shop he was molded not only as a 
production manager, but also as a scientist. Vsevolod 
Aleksandrovich headed the Scientific Research Institute of 
Nonferrous Metallurgy and was elected general director of the 
Tsvetnaya Metallurgiya Scientific Production Association. He is 
candidate of technical sciences. 
  In the evening, on the eve of our meeting, I saw in the 
first 
television program the frames of an old newsreel: the 
construction of Magnitka's first blast furnaces. Against their 
background the affectedly cheerful voice of a huckster was 
selling Magnitka's shares. 
  I devoted several years of my life to this city near the 
Ural 
River and to the celebrated metallurgical combine. The 
out-of-town editorial staff of KOMSOMOLSKAYA PRAVDA worked there 
during the construction of the "2500" cold-rolling mill. We 
published MALAYA KOMSOMOLKA. A cast plaque on a pedestal--Shop 
imeni KOMSOMOLSKAYA PRAVDA--is in memory of our work. 
  Viktor Filippovich Tomchuk, one of Magnitka's first 
volunteers, often dropped in on us, the out-of-town editorial 
staff. He was building the railroad to the future combine, then 
worked in its shops, and at the end of the 1960's, when we 
became acquainted, he spent every leave at Magnitogorsk's new 
construction sites. He "took part in unpaid mass work," as 
Tomchuk liked to say. With what shares can he be paid for all 
those unselfish years? And carpenter Isayev, who, according to 
his proud testimony, went through all Magnitka's mills? And 
thousands of their contemporaries--founders of the most powerful 
metallurgical combine in the world? 
  Will the same that has occurred with Uralmash, with the 
Gorkiy Motor Vehicle Plant, and with the industry's other 
giants, which are now being pulled apart, not happen with 
Magnitka? 
  "Magnitka," Vsevolod Aleksandrovich, having heard my tirade, 
said patiently, "is one of the few enterprises, part of the 
shares of which, in accordance with the government decision, 
remains under federal ownership." 
  [Andriyanov] What part? 
  [Generalov] A total of 22.3 percent. In other joint-stock 
companies--in the sector 75 percent of the enterprises have 
already been transformed into joint-stock companies--no blocks 
of shares remain under federal ownership. 
  After a closed subscription is conducted among members of 
labor collectives, where 56 percent of the shares are bought 
out, the remaining 44 are sold on the securities market, 
including 29 percent of the shares, at voucher auctions. 
  The value of enterprises was determined at the prices of 1 
July 1992, incidentally, like the nominal value of the voucher. 
Therefore, I share your alarm: In practice, enterprise funds are 
being distributed through voucher auctions. In many cases what 
workers and engineers acquire is much less than the share that 
falls to the buyers-up of vouchers. 
  [Andriyanov] It happens that vouchers are brought in bags. 
  [Generalov] They are not always bought up by those that 
participate in voucher auctions. Therefore, fights, and by no 
means of local significance, often are going on there. And, 
seemingly, quite unexpectedly the control block of shares of key 
enterprises passes to strange hands. How many criminal incidents 
with directors and other workers of enterprises, if their 
positions did not coincide with the interests of new owners, 
have already occurred! 
  Foreign firms often participate in voucher auctions through 
figure-heads. They do this not always in order to invest funds 
in production development. Interest in the elimination of a 
competitor on Russian and world markets is not ruled out. 
  [Andriyanov] In order to solve problems of reconstruction 
and 
development, many of the sector's enterprises need state support. 
  [Generalov] Now, according to the new privatization program, 
from 25.5 to 51 percent of the shares of enterprises in a number 
of sectors can remain under federal ownership for 3 years. 
Unfortunately, plants of the metallurgical complex did not get 
on this list. 
  Enterprises acutely need the block of shares, which would 
remain under federal ownership, during the establishment of 
financial-industrial groups and holding companies. In this case 
shares are the tool for the combination of the interests of 
enterprises and realization of joint investment programs. Later 
the sale of shares of such associations is possible at 
investment, not voucher, auctions, the winners of which will 
invest real funds in the development of enterprises. 
  [Andriyanov] Information on protests by metallurgists in 
connection with the transfer of part of the shares of nonferrous 
metallurgical plants to the Roseltrans Company has appeared in 
the press. What is the essence of the conflict? 
  [Generalov] In a number of metallurgical enterprises, in 
accordance with the directive of the State Committee on the 
Administration of State Property, it was proposed that the block 
of shares temporarily remaining under federal ownership be 
transferred to the Roseltrans Joint-Stock Company, which was 
being established. What is Roseltrans? 
  Let me try to figure it out. This is a company, which 
intends 
to produce electric locomotives. However, what does the 
Norilskiy Nikel Concern have to do with it? Or the Krasnoyarsk 
Aluminum Plant? Or the Kolchugino Plant for the Processing of 
Nonferrous Metal? Or the Gayskiy Ore-Dressing Combine, which 
received an instruction to transfer part of the shares to the 
authorized capital of Roseltrans. This combine mines ore and 
produces concentrates for nonferrous metallurgical enterprises. 
It would be logical to establish an association of enterprises 
connected through technological cooperation. 
  [Andriyanov] Why holding companies and financial-industrial 
groups are being established slowly in the sector? 
  [Generalov] This is not quite so. Plans for the 
establishment 
of a number of financial-industrial groups and holding companies 
in metallurgy have now been prepared. A holding company, ALKUR, 
was established on the basis of joint-stock companies of the 
aluminum industry in Sverdlovsk Oblast. The formation of large 
companies envisages the participation of consumers of metal 
products. A pilot project for the establishment of 
financial-industrial groups in the aluminum industry is being 
prepared. 
  In metallurgy the establishment of financial-industrial 
groups and holding companies is more necessary than in other 
sectors. First, in order to maintain intrasectorial 
technological cooperation ties from ore mining to the output of 
finished metal products. Second, the consolidation of material 
and financial resources will provide opportunities for the 
modernization of production and for a better utilization of 
production capacities. 
  However, existing, including antimonopoly, legislation 
limits 
these opportunities. 
  [Andriyanov] Vsevolod Aleksandrovich, precisely in what? 
  [Generalov] People say that monopoly is arising. However, 
all 
over the world large corporations operate in metallurgy--in 
ferrous metallurgy and in aluminum, copper-nickel, and other 
subsectors. The concept of "natural" monopoly, to which 
metallurgy pertains, exists there. This is due to the attachment 
to ore bases and to the specific technological features of 
production. The establishment of large conglomerates and 
corporations, sometimes with the participation of the state, 
makes it possible to efficiently utilize natural resources, to 
successfully compete on the foreign market, and to establish a 
strong frame for the national economy. 
  Our competitors abroad are increasing production and 
capturing markets, while Russian metallurgy has reduced the 
production volume by 40 percent. Not only the drop in demand, 
but also the rupture of economic ties, has had an effect. The 
situation cannot be worse. 
  [Andriyanov] Russia has already fallen back to fourth place 
in the world in steel production. 
  [Generalov] Russia's proportion in world steel output in 
1993 
dropped from 9.3 to 8.0 percent. Japan holds first place--99.6 
million tonnes. China has moved up into second place--88.7 
million. Then there is the United States--87 million. 
  [Andriyanov] However, your metallurgy has begun to lag not 
today? 
  [Generalov] Of course. For many years it developed 
extensively. Capital investments were allocated mainly for an 
increase in production volumes. Obsolete and worn out equipment 
remained there. For years the coefficient of fixed capital 
replacement was 0.9 to 1.2. This is lower than the technically 
and economically substantiated level by a factor of 3 to 4. Now 
more than 60 percent of the steel and one-half of the rolled 
metal products are produced on antiquated equipment. 
  [Andriyanov] Where are we going? 
  [Generalov] Without urgent measures for the retooling of 
metallurgy, protection of the domestic market, and regulation of 
the rise in prices of energy resources and transport Russian 
metallurgy will cease to exist. 
  [Andriyanov] However, we are advised to buy metal, like 
grain, abroad. They say that this will be cheaper. 
  [Generalov] This is totally unjustified economically, not to 
mention the fact that national security cannot be guaranteed 
without its metallurgy. For example, in order to import 10 
million tonnes of rolled steel products, 3.5 to 4.0 billion 
dollars will be needed. On the domestic market the same quantity 
of rolled metal products can be bought for 600 to 700 million 
dollars. 
  U.S. experience is also significant. About 20 years ago 
America made an attempt to orient itself toward the import of 
metal products, abandoning large financial investments in the 
modernization of its own metallurgy. However, even with its vast 
export opportunities the United States was forced to return to 
the revival of its own metallurgy on the latest technical basis. 
It engages in it very successfully. Steel output in the United 
States, having dropped from 103.8 million tonnes in 1980 to 67.8 
million tonnes in 1985, began to grow again. 
  [Andriyanov] As is well known, the Government of the Russian 
Federation adopted the Federal Program for the Retooling and 
Development of Russia's Metallurgy designed until the year 2000. 
RABOCHAYA TRIBUNA discussed it in detail. 
  [Generalov] We are grateful for this to the newspaper. There 
is no modern state without metal. The consumption of finished 
rolled metal products and steel pipes is sharply declining in 
Russia. At the same time, metal products, which ensure the 
vitality of the state economy, remain unclaimed. They include 
transport metal, rails, and wheels (a 30-percent reduction in 
consumption), pipes for gas lines and wells (30 percent), 
bearing steel (40 percent), and cables (20 percent). The 
consumption of nonferrous metals is being reduced. 
  [Andriyanov] As far as I know, in our country the per-capita 
consumption of aluminum is one-tenth of that in the United 
States. At the same time, we are reducing aluminum production by 
500,000 tonnes in 1994. How to understand this? 
  [Generalov] We are being forced out from the foreign market, 
which we have barely entered. They say that, as a result of the 
increase in the export of aluminum from Russia in recent years, 
its price has dropped sharply. However, this is only part of the 
truth. Aluminum production has increased in a number of 
countries and the "credit" for the decline in the prices of this 
metal is joint. 
  [Andriyanov] Discriminatory practice with respect to Russian 
producers continues on the world market. Nevertheless, 
metallurgists have been able to increase the export of foreign 
metals. 
  [Generalov] The export of ferrous metals has doubled, 
totaling 3.5 to 4 billion dollars. One-half went to Asian 
countries, 33.9, to Western Europe, and 4.9 percent, to America. 
The share of finished products has increased in the export 
structure. 
  The export of nonferrous metals has declined, totaling 2 
billion dollars, that is, half a billion less than in 1992. The 
reduction was due to the rise in prices of energy resources and 
fuel in the second half of 1993. In the fourth quarter the 
Government of Russia revised export duties, which made it 
possible to partially restore the efficiency of the export of 
metal products. 
  On the whole, however, only 10 to 15 percent of the domestic 
metal products can compete on the world market. And so, there is 
no end of the work to be done here.

<F P=106> [Igor Andreyev article: "If Terrorists Capture an AES, </F>
There Will Be No One To Liberate It"] 
  [Text] The collegium of the Federal Counterintelligence 
Service [FCS] (which, we would remind you, was set up last 
December to replace the abolished Ministry of Security) devoted 
its first session specifically to the security of Russia's 
strategic installations. Among other things the problem of 
nuclear electric power stations [AES's] was vociferously 
discussed in some alarm since the FCS thinks that they may fall 
prey to criminal, terrorist encroachments. 
  In the opinion of Colonel Leonid Semenov, a leading FCS 
expert and head of a Strategic Installations Directorate 
section, the first symptoms of trouble with crime at AES's 
appeared in the eighties. As was said at the time, "offices" 
received letters from personnel at the Kursk and Novovoronezh 
AES's and some AES's on Ukrainian territory. For all their 
differences, the messages boiled down to one thing: If you 
don't solve my problems (housing, and so on), I will not spare 
myself, I will blow an AES to kingdom come. Inspection of the 
"complaints," Semenov said, showed that the writers were 
suffering from psychological disorders. 
  The FCS believes that, since the early nineties, the 
socioeconomic preconditions for attacks on AES's have been 
compounded by political ones. According to the latest figures, 
which have not however been confirmed by documentation, 
extremists from the Ararat Valley made threats against the 
Armenian AES, while the most rabid separatists in Chechnya seem 
to have threatened the Balakovo and Kursk AES's. The Lubyanka 
believes that both groups saw the AES's as a potential means of 
putting political pressure on the Union and Russian authorities. 
  In Col. Semenov's view, there is an equal danger from 
arbitrary actions by AES personnel trying to get the government 
to resolve various social problems. Like, for instance, the 
hunger strike and picket of the Kursk AES this March by staffers 
protesting nonpayment of wages since December. In the opinion 
of counterintelligence personnel, extremists may exploit such 
situations, as well as the power generation operatives' just 
discontent, and events may quite possibly end up seriously out 
of control. 
  Although every AES has an FCS subunit working there, whose 
duty is to know everything and promptly gather information about 
likely attacks on AES security, legal norms no longer make 
provision for rigorous scrutiny of job applicants. Surprisingly 
enough, candidates for jobs as nuclear power generation 
personnel do not take a mental fitness test and are not vetted, 
as is the case throughout the civilized world, for reliability 
-- at least in human, civic terms. The once tightly sealed 
30-km zone around AES's has long been open to all comers. Today 
anyone, including criminals, can come and register or even live 
here without a stamp in their passport. There are no legal 
grounds for refusing people work at an AES, nor are there 
grounds for getting rid of extremists working at a power unit's 
control panel. The Law on Atomic Energy, the draft of which, 
according to Leonid Semenov, enshrines "cadre" norms, is one of 
those that legislators have failed to adopt since 1987. 
  So, imagine the worst case scenario: The reasonable 
organizers lose control of some quite peaceful demonstrations at 
an AES, and determined people, ready for anything, fishing in 
troubled waters, become the masters of the situation. Or some 
outside terrorists take crack AES staff hostage, keep them in 
their sights to get through the guards, and dictate terms to the 
government: Immediate sovereignty for the Verkhnevzdyblenskaya 
[imaginary name, akin to Ruritania] Republic]. 
  Earlier, even a couple of months ago, the country had the 
now-notorious "Vympel" to cope with that eventuality, whose 
superfighters were used at AES's since 1987. Each of them knew 
all the AES's like their own home and during exercises got 
through the seemingly impenetrable utilities' layouts to reach 
the power unit, a feat that amazed even AES specialists. Thanks 
to the exercises, incidentally, the AES guard system was 
perfected; they are guarded by Internal Troops and this system 
has been tightened up year after year. 
  "Vympel" no longer exists now -- it has been transferred to 
the MVD [Ministry of Internal Affairs] and effectively 
devastated. The FCS is hoping to re-create something similar, 
but these unique skills take years to cultivate and who can say 
that the crack detachment's combat experience and knowledge will 
not be needed today or tomorrow? 
  I got the feeling from my talk with Col. Semenov that the 
problem is not just one of a fighting force, capable of 
combating "nuclear" terrorism. For good or ill, no one in the 
past doubted the special services' right (and qualifications) to 
play the prime role in an emergency. That is, the forces 
assembled by various departments in a "hot spot" to counter a 
serious danger always had a natural, universally recognized 
hierarchy to guarantee unified command of an operation. No one 
muscled in, everyone knew their place, their rights, and duties. 
Regrettably, last December's action against the terrorists 
spilling dollars over Dagestan showed that there was no sign of 
the former unified command, since the presidential edict winding 
up the Russian Ministry of Security erupted precisely 21 
December. 
  My interlocutor in the FCS once again sees the Law on Atomic 
Energy, which has thus far not been adopted, as the solution to 
this power struggle. According to him, this law clearly sets 
out the rights and duties of each of the departments that 
oversees nuclear power generation. There has not yet been a 
tragedy, there is time, but the price of delay may be far more 
terrible than Chernobyl, which, as you know, blew up without any 
malicious intent on the part of those who caused the catastrophe.

<F P=106> [Interview with Valentin Dyuryagin, president of the </F>
joint-stock company Federal Chamber of Gold Trading 
Transactions, by DELOVOY MIR correspondent Vladimir Kalinkovich; 
place and date not given: "Supplied With Gold--A Pleasant 
Surprise From the Brokers"] 
  [Text] 
  [Kalinkovich] Valentin Viktorovich, what is the point of the 
work you have done to create a futures market for gold? To what 
extent is all of this topical for the current Russian economy? 
  [Dyuryagin] In cooperation with the republic timber 
exchange, 
we decided to establish and properly adjust an instrument for 
the gold futures market and titles of ownership for gold. 
Insofar as futures trading in freely convertible currency is 
developing fairly successfully in Russia at present, in 
particular for the American dollar and German mark, we concluded 
that the time has come to provide the opportunity for those who 
so aspire, to accomplish the preparatory work for possible 
liberalization of gold trading in accordance with the 
president's decree on creation of the precious metals exchange 
and formation of the gold market. The creation of such a futures 
market seems entirely realistic to us, insofar as gold is a 
commodity even more liquid than freely convertible currency. As 
we know, the state is not yet regulating the free circulation of 
gold in the country. Therefore, trading session participants 
have decided to provisionally consider as gold "gold 
certificates" of the Ministry of Finance and their shares issued 
by certain banks. 
  [Kalinkovich] What structures are participating in the 
futures trading? 
  [Dyuryagin] Today 36 participants have joined together in 
the 
futures market for gold. These are mainly insurance and 
financial companies and banks. In the present stage, we see our 
main objective as developing the technology of exchange futures 
trading in gold. It is important here to have a certain 
technological base, and in the event the Council of Ministers 
adopts a resolution on creation of a "gold exchange," we will be 
prepared to conduct full-fledged futures trading based on 
accumulated experience. This is our strategic objective. As far 
as today is concerned, market participants have the opportunity 
to gather together twice a week in the exchange building and 
carry on futures trading. This is purely an exchange game in 
which all the participants have the opportunity to derive profit 
from short-term price fluctuations. I would particularly like to 
emphasize that the entire operation is built on pure enthusiasm 
insofar as there is no ready market, you understand, and we all 
have a sense today of being pioneers in this endeavor. 
  [Kalinkovich] How do your brokers feel? 
  [Dyuryagin] The fact that brokers working in the exchange 
would so accurately divine the dynamics of price changes with 
respect to futures right from the initial sessions, I will state 
candidly, was a pleasant surprise to me. Their assessments 
coincide virtually entirely with the conclusions of their 
colleagues on the New York exchange. And today, now that a month 
of operation has gone by, I find it pleasant to realize that we 
are acting in unison with people who have far greater 
experience. Despite the fact that there has been no shortage of 
forecasters in Russia in recent times announcing the imminent 
and rapid rise in price of gold to $410-450 per troy ounce, the 
predictions of our brokers turned out to be the most 
accurate--in actuality the price fluctuated between $380-390 per 
troy ounce, which coincided virtually entirely with the dynamics 
of world prices for gold. Incidentally, the recent drop in 
prices at many world exchanges was accurately divined by the 
brokers at our exchange. And the price has dropped here as well 
over this time. 
  [Kalinkovich] So the fact is--all 30 or more trading session 
participants do not lose? They only win? 
  [Dyuryagin] Naturally, winning and losing are two sides of 
the same coin. But here is where the chief meaning behind the 
exchange game lies. I will note that the banks that participate 
in our trading sessions do not play with the assets of their 
clients, but rather with their own money.

<F P=106> [Article by Georgiy Volarovich, professor and honorary </F>
mineral prospector, and Aleksandr Kurskiy, candidate of chemical 
sciences: "We Have Found Gold Somewhere Here"] 
  [Text] "We have found gold somewhere here, a lot of 
gold--loads of it!" There are few television viewers who have 
not seen the advertisement accompanying this cheery jingle. All 
the same, does Russia have a lot of gold? 
  One of the myths disseminated in recent years is the 
fabulous 
reserve of gold which can come to the aid of Russia's economy 
during this period of crisis. But it turns out that the 
country's gold reserve, which had been accumulated for a 
century, was squandered by the end of "the Gorbachev period." It 
amounted to no more than 140 metric tons by August 1991. At the 
same time, 8,200 tons of gold were stored in the vaults of Fort 
Knox in the United States, and the total gold assets of the 
world's banks had reached 35,000 metric tons. Belgium and the 
Netherlands alone threw about 1,000 metric tons of gold into the 
world market in 1991, which led to a drop in the world price to 
$324 per ounce (31.1 grams) from $446 in 1987. 
  At the turn of this century, when intellectual politicians 
such as Sergey Yulyevich Vitte [Witte] and Petr Arkadyevich 
Stolypin held the position of minister of finance and prime 
minister, gold mining was especially encouraged by the granting 
of various state privileges. In 1914, 64 metric tons of gold, or 
one-tenth of the world's production of this metal, were 
extracted. Russia's gold reserve was more than 1,500 metric tons. 
  The bolsheviks understood the strategic role of the gold 
reserve as well as the tsarist ministers, and after the civil 
war they began intensive restoration of the state geological 
service and the gold industry. By 1928, the country had 
extracted 36 metric tons of gold. In order to speed up 
restoration of the state gold reserve, precious metals were 
confiscated from private individuals through the system of 
Torgsin [All-Union Association for Trade With Foreigners] 
stores, brilliantly portrayed by Mikhail Bulgakov in the novel 
"The Master and Margarita." By 1953, the gold reserve in the 
USSR had reached 2,050 metric tons. If it is taken into account 
that 2,100 metric tons were extracted from 1928 to 1953 and that 
the United States demanded 1,500 metric tons of gold to pay for 
Lend-Lease during World War II, we can see how effective the 
state system of precious metal accumulation was over these years. 
  Khrushchev deprived the gold industry of its previous 
privileges and began squandering the gold reserve, and this was 
completed under Gorbachev. Nevertheless, the powerful gold 
industry in the USSR increased the amount of gold extracted 
right up to 1990; it totaled an average 160 metric tons annually 
from 1955 to 1965, 250 metric tons per year from 1965 to 1975, 
and 273 metric tons per year from 1975 to 1990. Only South 
Africa extracted more gold--about 600 metric tons per year. The 
expenditures to establish and develop the mineral-raw material 
base for all types of minerals, including gold, during this 
period accounted for a stable 1.2 to 1.4 percent of national 
income, but the economic effectiveness of geological operations 
was highest among the primary sectors of the national economy. 
Investment programs over the past decades were oriented mainly 
toward development of the mineral-raw material base in settled 
regions with a more moderate climate on the USSR's southern 
perimeter. The huge amount of funds confiscated in Russia were 
invested in the construction of mining combines and development 
of territories which are sovereign today. 
  Russia turned out to be in a critical situation with respect 
to a number of minerals after the collapse of the USSR. Russian 
industry's requirements for manganese, chromium, antimony, 
titanium, mercury, and lead are being met almost entirely by 
deliveries from former union republics, which costs Russia $2 
billion per year. In gold production Russia holds just fifth 
place in the world today (158 metric tons in 1993). It extracts 
four times less gold per capita than Uzbekistan. Attempts are 
being made to increase the state gold reserve. It increased to 
308 metric tons in 1993. However, the lack of a consistent state 
mineral-raw material policy does not make it possible to count 
on even reaching the gold reserve level of 1913 quickly.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 


  Let us return to the United States' experience. Since 1929 
it 
has had a federal mineral-raw material policy aimed at the 
country's self-sufficiency in strategic raw material. The "Law 
on a national policy and research and development in the field 
of materials and mineral raw material" passed by the U.S. 
Congress in 1980 states: "...the United States should always 
pursue a policy aimed at providing for a sufficient supply of 
the materials needed to maintain national security, the public 
welfare, and the level of industrial production..." Since 1981, 
at the initiative of the United States, Canada, and the FRG, an 
international program has been implemented jointly with South 
Africa, Australia, and Great Britain to keep a record of the 
strategic types of mineral raw material and ensure its 
accessibility. The United States' gold reserve has reached its 
maximum amount since World War II--25,000 tons. After the war De 
Gaulle took decisive steps to increase France's gold reserve. 
All countries, especially Canada, Japan, Taiwan, China, India, 
abd Saudi Arabia, want to add to their gold reserve. Over the 
past 5 years, the United States, Australia, Canada, and China 
have doubled their gold production. It is a different situation 
in the territory of the former Soviet Union. 
  Unlike the United States, unified national mineral-raw 
material programs were not developed or implemented during the 
USSR's existence. Development of the country's mineral-raw 
material base was not linked with the task of building up 
strategic and mobilization resources. 
  The 2 years which the Law "On Mineral Resources," adopted by 
the VS RF [Russian Federation Supreme Soviet] in February 1992, 
has been in effect have shown that the federal mineral-raw 
material interests are practically unprotected by this 
legislation. The Supreme Soviet adopted and put into effect a 
statute on the procedure for paid, licensed use of mineral 
deposits long before the federal mineral-raw material priorities 
were defined. 
  The numerous auctions and competitions for the right to 
develop mineral deposits have not led to the establishment of 
one mining enterprise. The mass issuance of licenses for 
geological study of gold-bearing areas has taken vast regions, 
where practically no geological exploration work is being 
conducted, out of the jurisdiction of state regulation in a 
number of parts of the Russian Federation. 
  The lack of a federal mineral-raw material policy has led to 
disorganization of the geological sector. Its financing from the 
budget in 1993 amounted to just 17 percent of the 1990 level. 
Employment in the sector has declined by half and is continuing 
to decline. As a result, not one new deposit of metallic 
minerals has been found in Russia since 1992, and the increase 
in the gold reserve does not cover its production. This is 
leading to depletion of the mineral-raw material base--the 
principal source of resources for the Russian economy. 
  The situation is especially critical because many gold mines 
have reserves for just 6 or 7 years. At the same time, a number 
of the large gold deposits in Russia that were prospected before 
continue to be unused. These deposits include Sukhoy Log in 
Irkutsk Oblast, Nezhdaninskoye in Yakutia, Mayskoye in Chukotka, 
and Olimpiadskoye in Krasnoyarsk Kray. However, the funds needed 
to develop them are so substantial that this is practically 
impossible without foreign investments today. 
  The raw material base of Russian gold, the mining of which 
accounts for about 70 percent of Russia's total production, is 
in an even worse situation. In most of the leading regions 
(Magadan Oblast, Yakutia) which provide most of the placer gold, 
there are reserves available for just 3 to 5 years. The 
situation is somewhat better in the Amur and Transbaykal regions 
and Buryatia, but the average gold content in these regions is 
very low--just 0.16 to 0.17 grams per cubic meter, and 
production in these areas cannot compensate for the loss in the 
northeastern regions. 
  New regions with gold-bearing potential such as the Polar 
Urals, Timan, Karelia, Taymyr, Anabar, and Olenek have not been 
studied adequately. The gold content of the sands and gravel 
which are being excavated in thousands of quarries in many parts 
of the Russian platform has not been studied at all. 
  So the country's geologists have the urgent task of 
searching 
for deposits of gold, not to mention the other minerals. 
Considerable attention should be devoted to the Federal 
Geological Service without delay. 
  The specific nature of the geological sector and the 
objective gap in time between the stages of searching for 
deposits and the actual opportunity to begin working the 
minerals found have to be given particular emphasis. Any 
forecasts about Russia emerging from the depression after 1995 
are not worth the paper they are written on unless the extent of 
the degradation of the mineral resources base is taken into 
account. So that Russia's gold can reinforce the country's 
economic might, the policy on mineral resources has to be 
changed and made the state's business today.

<F P=106> [Article by Mikhail Kharitonenkov: "Gold Fever in Russia: A </F>
Boom in Illegal Production of Precious Metals and Stones Has 
Begun in the Country"] 
  [Text] The occupation of currency trader is going through a 
period of rapid growth in Russia. The reforms begun in the 
country (or what are reputed to be reforms) have not deprived 
this occupation of its criminal touch by any means. Rather, just 
the opposite is true. 
  According to data of the Economic Crimes Main Administration 
(GUEP) of the Russian Federation Ministry of Internal Affairs, 
the stratification of society by income level and the 
concentration of large sums in the hands of a relatively small 
number of entrepreneurs have led to a sharp increase in the 
demand for gold, silver, diamonds, and foreign currency. The 
vacuum formed in this market was filled first by representatives 
of the criminal world, which is perfectly natural. One of the 
specialists in this problem--GUEP staffer Aleksandr 
Alekseyev--believes we can now speak about the existence in 
Russia of a real industry in the illegal extraction, processing, 
and sale of gold and diamonds. Criminals are actively organizing 
ties with officials in the state apparatus and foreign 
colleagues and developing channels for the "export" of Russian 
valuables. 
  A situation, especially a criminal situation, can be 
evaluated only conditionally by statistics, but the figures on 
currency crime for 1993 look really impressive. According to the 
GUEP data, nearly 6,000 crimes of this type were discovered last 
year; during the course of their investigation, more than 250 
kilograms of gold, nearly 50 kilograms of platinum, over 1.8 
metric tons of silver, precious stones totaling 1,877 carats, 
and so forth were confiscated--altogether more than 13 billion 
rubles [R] (in last year's prices)! It should be noted at the 
same time that, according to the same statistics, the illegal 
currency business, like the drug business, is one of the most 
profitable forms of crime, and according to the most optimistic 
estimates, a very small proportion of the "commodity" in illegal 
turnover is being confiscated by the authorities. 
  According to the GUEP data citd by Aleksandr Alekseyev, the 
backbone of Russia's illegal currency business is made up of 
well-organized groups from republics in the Caucasus united by 
family clans. Each one of them closely monitors the gold mining 
regions of the country, and they are mainly the ones, in the 
specialists' opinion, who are practically paralyzing normal 
development of the entire currency market. While previously the 
currency traders were considered the intellectual elite of the 
criminal world and stood apart in it, openly criminal methods 
have taken root in their activities, such as armed raids on 
placer mines, attempts to work deposits, and so forth. The GUEP 
experts believe that a sizable "contribution" to this has been 
made by the sluggishness of the Russian Federation Committee on 
Precious Metals and Precious Stones [Roskomdragmet], in which 
the system for protecting valuables has been practically 
unchanged over the past 10 years. The technologies and equipment 
being used in the mining and processing of gold and natural 
diamonds is extremely obsolete, and, as a result, the precious 
raw material often turns out to be easily accessible. With the 
introduction of new, more improved capacities, the rates of gold 
consumption are not being reviewed in a timely manner, to put it 
mildly--one more source for the thieves. There are frequent 
cases in which persons who have not been checked out are allowed 
in the Roskomdragmet itself, where work associated with the 
extraction and processing of gold is conducted. In February 
1994, during a check by the gold acceptance office for the 
"Chikaya" Placer Mine of the "Zabaykalzoloto" Association, 
nearly 30 kilograms of gold to be turned over to the state were 
discovered to have been concealed by employees. 
  In Alekseyev's words, the expected economic gain was not 
achieved and the right to extract precious metals and precious 
stones granted to all juridical persons and citizens of Russia 
by the government decision in January 1992 was not materialized. 
But then, it had already become a widespread excuse for the 
"laundering" of illegally obtained valuables by criminal groups 
and one more source of enrichment. In 1993, as an example, 578 
licenses were issued to physical persons in the country's 15 
gold mining regions, and they turned in 167 kilograms of the 
metal--a ridiculous figure, in the specialists' opinion. In 
Magadan Oblast, the official productivity of one prospector 
averaged just a little over 250 grams of gold. 
  According to the GUEP data, the principal channel for taking 
out the stolen gold and diamonds continues to be air 
transportation. But the methods of shipping it has changed 
somewhat in recent years, taking the situation into account. 
While previously the couriers preferred to conceal the precious 
stones on themselves or in their clothing, as a rule, now they 
take them out mainly in their baggage (because of the higher 
volume of flights) or they avoid inspection altogether with the 
help of corrupt airport employees. 
  It is worth noting that politics has been mixed up in the 
illegal currency business lately. The experts believe that part 
of the precious stones being stolen in Russia through corrupt 
contacts in the Caucasus, the Baltic, and Central Asia are being 
used to support and finance extremist nationalist movements. 
  Analysis of all these processes, according to Aleksandr 
Alekseyev, has led GUEP experts to the conclusion that the gold 
mining industry may become one of the principal levers in the 
near future in the struggle against criminal associations for 
their sphere of influence. At the same time, this sector of 
industry itself will be subjected to even greater widespread 
pressure from their side. According to GUEP estimates, crime in 
the currency field may increase by several times as much. But 
there are a few grounds for optimism with respect to control 
over the situation by this service, Alekseyev believes. On one 
hand, the sector's breakup into separate and independent 
enterprises (including the mines and pits) is continuing. As a 
consequence, the centralized system for protecting the valuables 
being extracted has collapsed. On the other hand, the 
legislation which regulates currency operations, the transfer of 
precious stones, and so forth continues to be extremely watered 
down and abstract. Article 88 of the Russian Federation UK 
[Criminal Code] does not contain a clear-cut description of what 
constitutes "an illegal currency operation." According to the 
law "On Currency Regulation and Currency Control," establishment 
of the procedure for a transaction with precious metals and the 
like was put in the hands of the government, the Central Bank, 
the Ministry of Finance, and customs, but these questions have 
not been resolved to date. The numerous norms which exist are in 
open contradiction with each other. As an example, the illegal 
purchase, sale, and extraction of gold is considered a crime 
now, but its storage and transportation is not considered a 
crime. It is foolish, but this is how the law is. Of course, the 
criminals are aware of this and take advantage of it. It is 
interesting that the confusion reigning in this field, according 
to Aleksandr Alekseyev, has attracted the interest of Western 
businessmen. According to the GUEP, many industrial trading 
firms, mainly in the United States, South Africa, and Israel, 
consider the present currency situation in Russia to be very 
favorable for their activity. Negotiations on collaboration and 
the formation of various SP [joint ventures] to extract and 
process gold, diamonds, and so forth, are now being conducted by 
dozens of firms, and in most cases the Russian side does not 
turn out to be in the most advantageous position. But Russian 
commercial structures' interest in precious metals and stones is 
high as well. But it has a somewhat different tinge--according 
to certain data, businessmen are preparing and pushing through a 
legal basis to circumvent the state monopoly on trade in 
precious metals and stones.

<F P=106> [Article by Aleksandr Ivanovich Im, Moscow representative of </F>
the "Tuymaada Diamond" Joint-Stock Company: "The `Tuymaada 
Diamond' AK [Joint-Stock Company]: A Pioneer in the Russian 
Diamond Market"] 
  [Text] It is still too soon to assess the 
significance of the appearance in the Russian diamond industry 
of a large new center of the diamond-cutting industry in the 
Republic of Sakha (Yakutia). The production of brilliants here 
has not yet emerged from the formative stage. But it is 
important that it is being developed under market conditions, 
paving the way toward development of a Russian diamond market 
and actively contributing to an upswing in the economy of the 
Republic of Sakha (Yakutia). The "Tuymaada Diamond" Joint-Stock 
Company has assumed the principal burden of resolving the 
problems associated with the establishment of cutting 
plants. 
  Aleksandr Ivanovich Im, the company's Moscow 
representative, tells us about the company's activity and its 
problems and prospects. His work is typical of specialists in 
this new sector in the republic's national economy who have come 
from other fields of activity and are enthusiastic supporters of 
diamond industry development. Aleksandr Ivanovich was born in 
the village of Suntar in the Yakut ASSR in 1957. In 1984, he 
graduated from the mechanical design faculty of the MVTU [Moscow 
Higher Technical School] imeni Bauman, after which he worked for 
9 years at the Central Aerohydrodynamics Institute (TsAGI) imeni 
N. Ye. Zhukovskiy. Because of economic circumstances he was 
discharged in 1993 and became an adviser to the torgpred [trade 
representative] of the Republic of Sakha (Yakutia). He has 
worked in the "Tuymaada Diamond" AK since September 1993. 
  "What does the name of the company mean?" Familiarity with 
it 
usually begins with a question such as this. Tuymaada is the 
name of the valley where Yakutsk, the capital of the Republic of 
Sakha (Yakutia), is situated. This is where our company, which 
marks its 3d aniversary on 20 March 1994, is located. We can say 
with every right today that its establishment marked the 
formation of a new center of the Russian diamond-cutting 
industry, as well as a new diamond-processing sector in the 
republic's national economy. 
  The organization of such a company by a group of young 
persons with initiative was effectively supported by our 
government in the spring of 1991. And this is understandable, 
because the republic received the right to dispose of 100 
percent of the technical diamonds extracted in it and 20 percent 
of the jewelry-quality diamonds. 
  The company was initially formed as partly a state 
enterprise 
in order to realize the state program for development of the 
diamond-processing industry of the Republic of Sakha (Yakutia). 
"Tuymaada Diamond" is an open-type joint-stock company. The 
charter capital of the company has grown from 10 million rubles 
[R] to R1.8371 billion. Altogether, 49,898 shares of stock have 
been issued; 31.63 percent of them belong to the Republic of 
Sakha (Yakutia), 22.53 percent belong to the gosimushchestvo 
[State Property] Management Fund, 5.45 percent belong to the 
Fund for Public Social Support, and 3.65 percent belong to the 
Labor and Employment Committee. 
  The largest stockholders, with representatives on the board 
of directors, include companies such as the "Almazy Rossii 
Sakha" AK (14.85 percent of the shares), the "Zoloto Yakutii" 
APK (6.8 percent), The Altay "Kristall" Production Association 
(5.74 percent), the "Aldanzoloto" AO [Joint-Stock Comapny] (5.21 
percent), and the "Sakhainvest" Checking Investment Fund (1.67 
percent). Altogether, these stockholders hold 34.27 percent of 
the shares. And finally, 34.1 percent of the shares are held by 
other stockholders, each of whom owns less than 1 percent of the 
company stock. 
  As we see, the "Tuymaada Diamond" AK functions with 
participation not only by Yakut enterprises, but other Russian 
enterprises as well. I also emphasize that although diamond 
processing is an export-oriented sector and entry into the world 
market is in the company's plans, it is now operating in the 
Russian domestic market and selling its output to CIS countries 
as well. 
  Successful operation of diamond-cutting plants depends not 
only on a reliable source of good uncut diamonds, but 
experienced, skilled personnel. Their skill is developed over 
the years and is passed on from generation to generation. For 
this reason, the training of workers and specialists has been a 
fundamental labor problem for us. We have managed to resolve 
it--young people have been sent to learn at Russian and 
Ukrainian enterprises and foreign enterprises. We have also 
invited specialists from other localities. The first diamond was 
cut in 1992, and this first of our own brilliants, which we 
obtained in the village of Suntar, was of quite high quality and 
created a real wave of enthusiasm, reinforced confidence in the 
practicality of our plans, and prompted the rayon 
administrations to provide us with assistance in every possible 
way. The local administrations made their contribution to our 
company in the form of stone buildings that were available, 
which speeded up the process of establishing the plants 
considerably. 
  Altogether, 16 diamond-cutting plants are to be built in the 
1993-1995 period in accordance with the state program. Six 
plants--40 percent--have already been put into operation, and 
all the rest are scheduled to be commissioned from April to 
August this year. That is, the program will be fulfilled ahead 
of schedule. The Suntar, Yakutsk, Churapchinskiy, 
Verkhnevilyuyskiy, Berdigestyakhskiy, and Namskiy 
diamond-cutting plants are now in operation. They are all 
provided with the most advanced Russian and foreign equipment. 
Equipment valued at R1.6 billion has been delivered and 
installed. Two enterprises have also been built to turn out 
diamond powders and tools and to produce items made of uncut 
gemstones. Transport and commercial firms have been formed. A 
controlling block of stock in the "Eyge" Bank has been obtained. 
So an entire range of structures has been established to ensure 
the stability of our diamond-processing sector. The company's 
plans include the establishment of jewelry enterprises which 
make extensive use of our product in their work. 
  The result of our 3 years of work has been the formation of 
a 
system of joint-stock companies [AO], joint ventures, and the 
joint-stock companies [AK] associated with them. The "Amma 
Diamond," "Lena Diamond," "Sargy Diamond," "Mayya Diamond," 
"Vostok Diamond," "Ensieli Diamond," and "Kebeey Diamond" 
joint-stock companies and the "Sakha Japan Diamond," "Amma 
Padani Diamonds," "Kuoliti Diamonds," "Ensieli Diam," and 
"Tuymaada Raykhbard Diamond Ltd" joint ventures are engaged in 
diamond cutting. The "Kyundyu Tass" Joint-Stock Company is 
producing items made of gemstones and the "Sakha Diamond" 
Joint-Stock Company is turning out diamond powders and tools. 
  In looking back at what has been achieved, we see the 
creation of prestigious modern work places in the republic as 
one of the important results. Nearly 900 persons are working in 
the company structures, including over 170 engineers and 
technicians and more than 700 workers, of whom 463 are cutters. 
Another 165 persons are in training. We are especially proud of 
this result, inasmuch as our cutting plants have been dispersed 
in agricultural uluses [settlements], which not only helps to 
resolve the problem of employment for the rural population, but 
has a beneficial effect on the entire local economy. There is a 
real possibility of shifting the uluses from republic budget 
subsidies to funds which they have earned themselves. But after 
all, according to the statistics, all the uluses depend on the 
subsidies for 95 percent of their support, which inevitably 
reinforces parasitical attitudes and social apathy. But now 
attractive types of employment have been developed for the 
residents. In addition, the funds going to the republic budget 
from the production and sale of brilliants make it possible to 
improve the financing of many public health, education, and 
cultural facilities. 
  But while the social importance of the diamond-processing 
industry in the Republic of Sakha is quite apparent, the 
economic effectiveness is questionable at times. How 
economically feasible is the construction of cutting enterprises 
in remote, frosty Siberia, and in the villages as well? Will 
they be profitable? Yes, they will be. And our economic 
calculations have already been confirmed by experience. So what 
is increasing the expenditures? The lack of roads and long 
distances are leading to increased transportation expenses. The 
freezing weather increases the expenses for heat and 
electricity. And northern residents must be paid much more for 
their work than the residents of Russia's central regions. 
  All the same, the value of diamonds is so high that the 
expenditures for transportation, heat and electricity, and wages 
have a relatively small effect on the value of brilliants. On 
average, 85 percent of the value of a brilliant is in the value 
of the uncut diamond, and nearly 10 percent of the value is in 
the wages. The other expenses for manufacturing and sales, 
leasing of premises, heat and electricity, and transportation 
account for no more than 5 percent of the value. And while all 
these expenses under the conditions in our republic are three 
times higher when compared with the West, for example, the value 
of a brilliant with the wages paid there is increased by only 5 
to 10 percent. But this makes it possible with good work 
organization, modern equipment, and the cutters' high skill to 
count on the competitiveness of Yakut brilliants not only in the 
Russian domestic market, but the world market as well. For 
example, our wages cannot be compared with wages in the West at 
present, and in addition, we do not pay the high rent that they 
must pay, which enables us even now to speak about the lower 
production cost of our product. 
  Of course, the industrial processing of diamonds should be 
in 
complete conformity with the standards recognized by the world 
cutting centers and should take rapidly changing market 
conditions into account. And while all these years the 
specialists of the "Tuymaada Diamond" AK lived continuously in 
an investment routine and were preoccupied by the problems of 
financial resources and construction, we have now come really 
close to a new stage in our development, when the quality of the 
brilliants and their conformity to market demands are assuming 
decisive importance. 
  World experience shows that a cutter approaches the peak of 
his skill in 5 years, spasmodically raising labor productivity: 
three to five times as much each year for the first 3 years, and 
two to three times as much in the last time period. Today the 
production cost of cutting brilliants in the republic's cutting 
plants is very high because of low productivity. But this 
situation will gradually change, gross output will increase, and 
expenses will begin declining. And our task is to react in a 
timely manner to the change in "style" in the cut diamond 
business and requirements of the jewelry industry. 
  The fact that our plants have 30 to 50 cutters, as a rule, 
and are not giants by any means helps us in coping with this 
problem; they can be restructured and improve their technology 
easily. We are guided in our development by the achievements and 
traditions of the Russian diamond-cutting school, whose 
authority is quite reliable. All the same, the classical 
"Russian-cut" brilliants from the traditionally high-grade uncut 
diamonds in the world markets are being squeezed by brilliants 
which may have a less complex but very diversified cut. Two of 
the six cutting plants already in operation are using the same 
technology which is used at other Russian plants, but four of 
them are using a different technology--Belgian, Japanese, or 
Israeli. In addition, the company includes joint ventures with 
Japanese, Belgian, and Israeli firms, which facilitates the 
assimilation of new organizational and technological principles 
in the work. The new technologies are also attactive because 
they increase the output of a finished product from uncut 
diamonds and reduce the cost of brilliants. 
  And returning again to achievements in the 3 years of 
development at the "Tuymaada Diamond" AK, I would like to stress 
the following conclusion of fundaamental importance: our company 
has been practically a pioneer in the world cut diamond market. 
  A Russian domestic market for cut diamonds, with all the 
structures needed for this, still remains to be developed. 
Joint-stock companies for processing diamonds in the Republic of 
Sakha (Yakutia) were practically the first to take this path by 
selling brilliants to jewelry plants, firms, repair shops, 
commercial banks, and individual citizens. Other Russian cutting 
plants left after the collapse of the USSR with which we were 
actively collaborating inherited a cumbersome production 
facility without developed commercial structures and a rigid 
framework of technical conditions. On the other hand, these 
plants have SPTU [presumably: agricultural vocational-technical 
schools] with established traditions in training specialists and 
developed machine building. I think that although we have 
different tasks and we are in various stages of development, we 
have more common interests than differences. 
  In selling brilliants, we are establishing a market for them 
in Russia at a time when the quality of brilliants as a fine 
investment commodity has begun to appreciate considerably under 
the conditions of high inflation. In the world market, the value 
of cut diamonds increases by an average 300 percent over a 
10-year period. So brilliants are a commodity which yields an 
average profit on investment of 30 percent annually, and often 
even more, since the price for brilliants is highly individual 
and depends on numerous parameters. A brilliant is always a 
brilliant. The merits of a brilliant need not be advertised and 
its profitability need not be demonstrated. A brilliant that is 
purchased requires practically no special care from its owner, 
and it just rises in price. Especially as the level of prices 
for brilliants in the domestic market has turned out to be 
unexpectedly productive--in wholesale batches it is higher than 
prices in the world market. This makes it possible for the 
"Tuymaada Diamond" AK to allow a discount of up to 10 percent 
from the prices of wholesale batches in sales to its 
stockholders. Moreover, we guarantee that we will buy back the 
brilliants if stockholders are in urgent need of funds. 
  Can you become a stockholder in our company? Yes, you can. 
We 
are beginning the sixth stock issue and we are counting on 
investments. In previous years only about 5 percent of the 
company's shares were distributed in the Russian market as a 
whole, but 95 percent were distributed within the republic. Now 
the "Tuymaada Diamond" AK intends to increase the sale of stock 
shares in the Russian national market. They are in good demand, 
and the price in the Moscow stock exchanges is 9 to 13 times 
their nominal value. The next emission will reflect the results 
of reassessment of the fixed capital, and each ruble of the 
stock's value will be reinforced by real physical assets. We are 
confident that this stock issue will be bought up quickly by 
those who are able to assess the commercial attractiveness of 
stock shares from the diamond business. 
  In entering the market environment, we became aware of the 
practically complete lack of needed information in the country 
on the prices for uncut diamonds and brilliants in the world 
markets in one region or another. There are not enough studies 
and forecasts of market conditions. The instability of export 
duties is a big obstacle. We would also like parliament and the 
government to expedite establishment of the necessary legal and 
normative basis for normal operation of the diamond-processing 
industry under market conditions.

<F P=106> [Interview with Valeriy Shelkovnikov, chairman of </F>
"Rosaeronavigatsiya" [Russian State Commission for Airspace Use 
and Air Traffic Control], by V. Karpiy: "We Are Prepared for an 
Open Dialogue"] 
  [Text] I am certain it is not necessary to introduce 
V. Shelkovnikov, the chairman of the Commission for Air Traffic 
Control [ATC], to most of our readers, because his name has 
appeared very often in the pages of VOZDUSHNYY TRANSPORT 
throughout the newspaper's history. Some will remember him as 
the chief of the TsUVD [Air Traffic Control Central 
Administration], as the chief of the GlavUVD MGA [ATC chief of 
the Ministry of Civil Aviation], or as the president of the 
International Aviation Safety Fund. Friends will recall that, 
aside from the 27 years he has worked in the ATC Service, there 
were years spent in polar aviation, in the Nothern Civil 
Aviation Administration, and in supervising the group testing 
the first automated system--"Start." Generally speaking, he has 
served in all the positions, right up to chief of a zone center, 
and then the Main Center... And now he is in air traffic control 
once again. And this is how we began our interview. 
  [Karpiy] Valeriy Georgiyevich, 4 years ago you left the 
civil 
aviation ATC Service which you headed for more than 6 years, and 
then suddenly 6 months ago you returned. What compelled you to 
make such an important decision in both cases? 
  [Shelkovnikov] There were several reasons why I left the 
position as head of such a large service as ATC, but I will tell 
you about the principal one. In 1989, when it had already become 
completely clear that the coming years would bring very big 
changes to the country's civil aviation, I realized that I had 
no right to take part in this process without knowledge of the 
principles and standards of the world aviation community, from 
which we had been very carefully sealed off for a long time. 
Especially taking thousands of people with me... Then the idea 
developed of forming an independent public organization--the 
Aviation Safety Fund of the USSR, which has now become 
international. I was named its president, and in my 5 years of 
work there I went through an excellent "academy" of civil 
aviation, where I learned a great deal. For that reason, I began 
looking at a number of things which one would think were obvious 
through entirely different eyes. 
  But I returned to the ATC Service in June 1993. Frankly 
speaking, this return was also very unexpected for me. The fact 
is that when I worked in the FAB [Aviation Safety Fund] I had 
occasion to work with controllers and meet with the heads of 
services as before. It is still a mystery to me why they decided 
to ask the prime minister to appoint me as president [sic] of 
"Gosaeronavigatsiya." 
  [Karpiy] How did you feel when you learned of this request? 
  [Shelkovnikov] If I had known where I was going, I would 
have 
been a little more conceited person, and I probably would have 
considered this very flattering. But...it is clear that each of 
us has to bear his own cross. 
  [Karpiy] You said that you knew where you were going. Six 
months had passed since then. Didn't you have to modify your 
views on the state of affairs in the ATC Service and the 
processes which were and are under way in it? 
  [Shelkovnikov] Practically none. Extremely complex 
processes, 
which are painful at times, are under way in our service and in 
civil aviation as a whole. I realize that they are unavoidable. 
Previously, all aviation operations were under the Ministry of 
Civil Aviation. Today, in line with the government's concept of 
air transport development, which I consider correct, airports 
are detached, airlines are being formed, and the ATC Service is 
defining its place in this process. But because it was built up 
and developed as a unified organism for decades, it is not so 
simple to divide it into parts, and painlessly as well. 
  [Karpiy] And the ATC Service, I think, is affected more than 
others. The things that it is being blamed for, including the 
charge that it is almost paralyzing air traffic... 
  [Shelkovnikov] The wage rates and fees? All the expenditures 
on air traffic control will make up 6.8 percent of civil 
aviation's overall expenditures in 1994. Is this a big or a 
small amount? But who has tried to understand whether this is a 
great organization, whether it has been maintained and is being 
modernized in good time? I do not think many will answer with 
knowledge of the matter. 
  [Karpiy] But tell us... 
  [Shelkovnikov] Today, the coordination and planning of 
airspace use and air traffic control in the Russian Federation 
is being handled by centers of the Unified ATC System and ATC 
departmental organs. So Russia's YeS UVD [Unified ATC System] 
has 142 centers; one of them is the main center, eight are zonal 
centers, 70 are regional centers, and 63 are auxiliary air route 
centers. 
  We are responsible for flight safety on every one of the 
239,903 kilometers of airways in Russia. As of 1 June last year, 
more than 2,500 pieces of basic electronic equipment, more than 
17,000 units of communications equipment, and so forth were 
being operated in our services. Impressive?! 
  And all this should function without interruption, smoothly, 
and absolutely reliably, for if something happens, a crew in 
flight will be deaf and blind. But after all, our service has 
very expensive equipment which requires heightened attention by 
many thousands of persons with the highest qualifications. 
  Multiply what I have told you by the confusion in the 
economy, the inflation, the nonpayments, the severe price 
increases for every part, assembly, and unit, for what we need 
to keep mobilized, trained, disciplined, and highly intelligent 
people in the service when there is almost an "individual hunt" 
for each one of them by commercial structures and while you are 
faced with something which very remotely resembles a budget 
which would keep the service "afloat." 
  And besides all this, there are the lives of millions of 
persons for whom the controllers bear responsibility. So you be 
the judge--whether 6.8 percent is a large or a small amount. And 
I have only raised the edge of the curtain we work behind. Add 
here the support for especially important flights, use of the 
airspace by the VVS [Air Forces], Naval Aviation, specialized 
aviation, general aviation, and departmental airplanes and 
helicopters. 
  [Karpiy] The ruble and the dollar are considered to be of 
primary importance today. You mentioned the "hunt" for aviation 
specialists by commercial structures, where the earnings are 
higher and the work is a little easier. Have you received offers 
from the commercial interests as well? 
  [Shelkovnikov] Yes, they have made offers. But inasmuch as I 
am here, I do not think it necessary to explain what I chose. 
Moreover, after returning, I was both glad and proud of my 
comrades--a great many first-class specialists and managers of 
services had remained on the job and did not change their work, 
which they had chosen as a career. Although they have had to 
stand the siege and are still besieged from various sides, 
including from their own families at times. And this is under 
conditions in which it is becoming harder and harder to work. 
  [Karpiy] Why? Didn't you list all the factors--inflation, 
nonpayments? 
  [Shelkovnikov] No, not all of them. The main problem is the 
equipment we are using, which has been worn out by a factor of 
42 percent on average. And this means that it is deteriorating 
more and more each day and requires more and more attention and 
expenditures of labor and finances. Unless this process is 
brought under control, 82 percent of the equipment will be worn 
out in 5 years. We cannot permit this--after all, we bear the 
responsibility not only for our fellow countrymen and our 
airways--foreign airlines are also flying here. And since they 
bear responsibility for our fellow citizens when they fly in 
foreign airspace, we are just as responsible, under 
international laws, to ensure safe passage by foreign aircraft 
over our territory. 
  But how do we do this when there is equipment somewhere in 
the North which was sent by the Americans under Lend-Lease 
during World War II? If all the automated airway ATC systems 
date from the periods of their development--1971 to 1980? I 
could continue this list for an extended period, but it is clear 
that this problem cannot be solved without major capital 
investments. And without this, the principal task cannot be 
performed--the reason why the ATC Service was formed--provision 
for flight safety. Unfortunately, this is the opinion that 
exists in the country: "These are your problems, so you resolve 
them." 
  This an extremely incorrect approach. During my work in the 
FAB I had occasion to study this matter thoroughly in various 
other states, and only where the society--the people--consider 
it to be their direct responsibility to provide for flight 
safety is it equal to the occasion. After all, it is not for 
nothing that one of the first truths in the "ICAO [International 
Civil Aviation Organization] Aviation Accident Prevention 
Manual" states: 
  "If in your opinion the cost of safety is too high, it means 
you know what an aviation accident is." 
  The world aviation community and all civilized peoples are 
contributing immeasurably more to flight safety than we are. 
Sooner or later there will be a critical change in the public 
consciousness here, but we must not pay for this change in 
blood. But we are paying, you know--the latest tragedy in 
Irkutsk is an example of that. 
  [Karpiy] But you are aware of the country's budget 
situation, 
and how many holes there are in it. 
  [Shelkovnikov] And that is the reason we are looking, 
looking, and looking to see where we can save the airlines' 
money. 
  Straightening the routes. What is this? It is saving fuel 
and 
the service life of aircraft. Jointly with the Genshtab [General 
Staff], we are planning to save 5 billion rubles per year in 
this operation alone. This is an unlimited field for activity, 
and we have asked the airlines to send their suggestions. 
Altogether, 15 have responded. 
  But after all, pilots all over the world are flying where it 
is not prohibited, unlike here, where we fly only where it is 
has been authorized. 
  I am certain if we succeed in making the best possible use 
of 
airspace, we will eliminate the fuel crisis in aviation. 
  One more example: at present only 5.8 percent of Russia's 
airspace, a very small amount, is open for international 
flights. The route from Europe to Asia is over Russia, and the 
more airways we open, the more profit we will receive from air 
navigation fees. Foreign airlines are waiting for these routes, 
they are prepared to pay us and prepared to invest money in the 
ground equipment for these airways--if only the length of time 
their aircraft spend in the air is reduced. But in carrying out 
this work we are running into dozens of obstacles and we have to 
prove the obvious truths to many departments. 
  [Karpiy] But does the opposite happen? 
  [Shelkovnikov] It happens, but not often. Valeriy 
Mikhaylovich Zubov, a doctor of economic sciences and head of 
administration for Krasnoyarsak Kray, asked us to "open" 
airspace equivalent in area to five Frances over the kray's 
territory. We fulfilled his request, and a government decree was 
issued on 10 November 1993 "opening" 28 sections of 
international airways over Krasnoyarsk. He stated in addition: 
"I realize that the controllers have no money..." and he is 
undertaking the organization...of a joint-stock company whose 
responsibility would be to equip the airways and train people. 
This person understands that if aviation is the only 
transportation for most of the people in the kray, who should be 
concerned about aviation if not the local authorities?! 
  [Karpiy] Valeriy Georgiyevich, you cited quite a few 
problems 
whose importance is indisputable. All the same, aren't there 
sore points which require priority attention from you personally? 
  [Shelkovnikov] The Moscow AUVD [Automated ATC] Center. Some 
15 years have passed since it was put into operation. The roof 
has not been maintained here, the displays have begun breaking 
down... But after all, the Moscow Zone is one of the most 
saturated in the world. We are now concentrating our efforts 
here to rectify the situation. 
  We have a big problem with the Rostov "Strela" system. This 
is in the south of Russia, the exit to the Black Sea. It has 
been 12 years since it was built and it has completely exhausted 
its service life. But how can we close this zone, where aviation 
is being rapidly developed now? Stavropol, Anapa, Sochi, 
Krasnodar, Rostov-on-Don, and Mineralnyye Vody have become 
international airports and "Strela" is the "step" to them. We 
are looking for the means to get out of this very difficult 
impasse. 
  Kaliningrad. One of the independent states has undertaken 
the 
control of air traffic in space belonging to Russia without its 
consent here. This took place 2 years ago, and now the situation 
must be rectified and this area must be modernized. 
  There is no end of work in the Far North and the Far Eastern 
region. 
  [Karpiy] Where you had to limit traffic density, which 
resulted in a heated response everywhere? 
  [Shelkovnikov] Yes. This followed a near miss by two Boeing 
747's on opposite headings in the Khabarovsk Zone. One of them 
belonged to the Japanese All Nippon Airline, and the other to 
British Airways. They moved apart in direct proximity to each 
other. According to the scientists' conclusion, the risk of a 
collision was three times greater than what is acceptable. 
Tragedy was avoided only because collision avoidance equipment 
was available on both aircraft. The crew of the British Airways 
aircraft received the command "To the right and up," and the 
Japanese aircraft received the command "To the right and down." 
A stressful situation for the crews and passengers were 
injured... 
  The causes? Our first impression was that a person, the 
controller, was at fault. When we investigated more thoroughly, 
we realized that we were not looking for the guilty person 
there. Organizational flaws--this is what nearly led to a 
disaster. The cutback in personnel and the absence of an 
operator put an excessive load on the controller. He did not 
receive the command from Tokyo and did not expect the two 
aircraft to be heading toward each other. There was no radar 
control or relay transmitter. Economizing on the means needed to 
provide for normal communications--these are the main 
"culprits." It is good that the commission included 
psychologists, who demonstrated that a person was physically not 
in a position to resolve the situation. Well, there were quite a 
few claims made against the Far Eastern Region management, of 
course. 
  This time, they managed... 
  [Karpiy] But what if they hadn't? You will forgive this 
cruel 
question. 
  [Shelkovnikov] There would have been three national 
tragedies--in Russia, in Britain, and in Japan, since dozens of 
people would have perished. 
  And if we add to this that the British Airways aircraft was 
insured for $1.2 billion and the Japanese aircraft was insured 
for $1 billion, who would have paid this money? Russia has no 
insurance for the risk of collision, while Singapore, New 
Zealand, and Great Britain have such insurance coverage even 
when an ATC system much more reliable than ours is available. 
  [Karpiy] So we must be insured... 
  [Shelkovnikov] We also need amounts much higher than in 
those 
countries I mentioned. The worse the system, the greater the 
risk of collision, and hence the higher the insurance rates. It 
is a vicious circle. 
  [Karpiy] And you caught it from our press... 
  [Shelkovnikov] At the scientists' recommendation, we chose 
the lesser of two evils before completing modernization of these 
sections, that is, before March: we have limited the density of 
air traffic. Incidentally, we are not the first to take such a 
step; this is a normal practice throughout the world. The lives 
of innocent persons cannot be risked under any conditions. Even 
if we have to incur financial losses. 
  [Karpiy] As far as I know, you sent a commission to 
Khabarovsk which was almost equivalent in composition and powers 
to those that the government assigns for catastrophes. 
  [Shelkovnikov] During my 3 years with the Aviation Safety 
Fund, I managed to size up the conceptual approaches to disaster 
prevention which exist in the world. They are very simple. 
  The first truth is that the persons at the top must concern 
themselves with safety and not delegate this part of the work to 
anyone. No matter whether it is the president of a country, the 
head of an administration, the president of an airline, the 
commander of a crew... Because safety is a most sacred thing. 
  The second truth. If there has been some violation in one 
field of human activity or another, we should thank God that a 
disaster did not occur. And the incident should be investigated 
as if there had been a catastrophe. 
  There has been a dangerous convergence of aircraft... It can 
be "farmed out" to local aviation authorities. Will they 
investigate it objectively? Will they have enough resources, 
knowledge, and experience? I don't know. 
  But if there had been a disaster, a government commission 
and 
hundreds of people would have been involved. So thank God there 
was no disaster, and do everything possible right here, with the 
fresh tracks, to find all the causes which nearly led to a 
disaster and exert every effort to ensure that there is no 
recurrence on a larger scale. And psychologists must be on the 
commission. Often only a specialist in the area of human 
psychology is in a position to determine why a controller, a 
pilot, or an engineer acted in one way or another. 
  It is not difficult for an administrator. He quickly finds 
the guilty party and states: You have violated such and such a 
paragraph, such and such a point..." And that is all. But where 
is the guarantee that someone else, perhaps even more 
experienced, will not make the same mistake?! The aviation world 
has abandoned searches for a guilty party--there are numerous 
other services for this. The aviation world looks for the 
reasons for errors and ways of preventing them. And it is 
putting a large amount of funds into this work. Because there is 
nothing minor in aviation, and what is at first glance a most 
insignificant near miss may result in an avalanche of events 
leading to a catastrophe. 
  Do you remember what went on here quite recently, just 10 or 
12 years ago? 
  [Karpiy] When even the term "flight safety" was not used and 
they spoke about "the quality of flights?" 
  [Shelkovnikov] Absolutely correct. If there were a disaster, 
you know, they quickly looked for the guilty parties and issued 
an order on two or three pages, as a rule, even with a "secret" 
classification--and that was all! 
  And here we have come to the third truth. Throughout the 
world, when there has been an accident and the cause has been 
found, a very powerful propaganda machine is put into action. We 
read in the ICAO document: a highly effective means of 
preventing aviation accidents (AP) is the publication of 
information bulletins on the cirucmstances and causes of 
accidents and incidents and a graphic illustration of the events. 
  If a pilot has learned from the mistakes of others and the 
incidents in which they were involved, there would be less... 
  Until we reach the point where I can purchase a book on a 
catastrophe at any kiosk (in the United States, for example) and 
carefully study at home everything related to it and what led to 
it, we will incur losses. Our specialists have nothing to study. 
There are no aviation newspapers or magazines for the general 
reader as well as the specialist. In America you can buy and 
inquire about the huge volumes published by the Bureau of 
Accident Investigation. And there you will find information 
about what took place, and why and where it took place, as well 
as recommendations on how to avoid a tragedy. And the airlines 
buy these materials, they study them, and they learn from 
others' mistakes. 
  There is propaganda for you! But here? As far as I am aware, 
your only newspaper in the world's largest aviation 
power--VOZDUSHNYY TRANSPORT--is barely remaining "afloat." 
  [Karpiy] If not worse... 
  [Shelkovnikov] So what kind of preventive measures and 
propaganda on aviation accident prevention can we speak about if 
we have no means of influencing the minds, the feelings, and the 
conscience of a person who works in a very complex field such as 
civil aviation?! There are many questions. 
  [Karpiy] Yes, you are right, there are many questions. I 
would like to learn your point of view in more detail on a 
critical problem such as air navigation fees; on participation 
in accident investigation by associations of controllers, 
pilots, and other public professional organizations; on your 
attitude with respect to controllers' strikes; with respect to 
the disintegration of the former union's unified airspace; and 
about the prestige of the controllers' profession. Moreover, I 
am certain that not only we journalists, but your allies and 
opponents, are prepared to take part in a discussion of these 
and other problems related to the activity of 
"Rosaeronavigatsiya." 
  [Shelkovnikov] We are prepared for an open dialogue with 
everyone for whom aviation and everything associated with it has 
become their life's work. 
  [Karpiy] Thank you for the interview.

<F P=106> [Interview with Aleksey Isaykin, executive director of the </F>
Volga-Dnepr Airline, by VOZDUSHNYY TRANSPORT correspondent 
Valeriy Ageyev: "The Volga-Dnepr Airline Is Extending its 
Boundaries"] 
  [Text] We have informed our readers time and again 
about the activities of the Russian "Volga-Dnepr" Air Freight 
Company, which today is the country's largest air carrier. In 
its 3 years of existence, the company has demonstrated its 
ability not only to survive under difficult economic conditions, 
but to substantially extend the boundaries of its activity. The 
company's results in 1992, when it increased the volume shipped 
from 12.3 million metric ton-kilometers in 1991 to 94.2 metric 
ton-kilometers, attest to its success. The airline's activity is 
also respected because it was one of the first in Russia to 
export not only raw material, but competitive high-tech 
transport services in the international market. 
  VOZDUSHNYY TRANSPORT correspondent Valeriy Ageyev asked 
Aleksey Isaykin, the executive director of "Volga-Dnepr," to 
answer a few of the questions asked most often by the 
newspaper's readers. 
  [Ageyev] Aleksey Ivanovich, has your company made any unique 
shipments lately? 
  [Isaykin] Yes, not long ago one of the airline's An-124-100 
"Ruslan" aircraft delivered a single load of 130 metric tons to 
the Australian city of Perth--a 20-meter unit for repairing the 
footing of offshore drilling rigs. Our pilots spent 28 hours in 
the air, bypassing airports in Istanbul, Madras, and Singapore. 
  The transportation of 232 metric tons of stage equipment for 
the Michael Jackson world tour, as well as the 120 metric tons 
of concert equipment for Madonna's tour through Latin 
America--these were operations that were not so much unique as 
they were noisy. 
  [Ageyev] But the unique trips are certainly not the only 
aspect of your activity. 
  [Isaykin] You are right. Our company is not limited to 
unique 
flights. On 18 November, we delivered 6 metric tons of 
humanitarian cargo from the United States to Ulyanovsk. These 
were medicines and medical equipment donated by parishioners of 
St. Luke's Church in Oklahoma City to the Ulyanovsk Oblast 
hospital. Together with the humanitarian cargo, we carried oil 
drilling equipment to Russia from the United States. 
  [Ageyev] "Volga-Dnepr" has developed the reputation of a 
reliable partner in the world market today. What have you 
accomplished in the field of international cooperation? 
  [Isaykin] Our relationships with foreign partners are not 
limited just to the contracts to carry cargo. A delegation from 
Oklahoma State University was in Ulyanovsk in October 1993. 
Bobby Henn [as transliterated], a professor of international 
marketing, and the regional manager of the Air Express 
International airline conducted business seminars for 8 days for 
"Volga-Dnepr" employees. The subject of the seminars dealt with 
an analysis of the situation in the world market for air freight 
service, the study of management strategy for entering the world 
market, the problems of managing an international air freight 
airline, and familiarization with the specific nature of the 
market for air freight service and its industrial base. 
  At the conclusion of the American specialists' visit, an 
agreement was reached on training for our company's employees at 
Oklahoma State University. 
  [Ageyev] What kind of new transportation services can 
"Volga-Dnepr" provide today? 
  [Isaykin] We want to extend our activity in other directions 
as well. In addition to carrying large-sized and extra-heavy 
loads, "Volga-Dnepr" can offer a new form of service. We are 
prepared to provide for the reception of foreign delegations and 
the organization of business meetings and visits in the Yak-40 
aircraft. The economy and business class cabins have been 
furnished with upholstered furniture, which is convenient both 
for business negotiations and a quiet rest. Our Yak-40 also has 
the equipment needed to organize the passengers' meals. 
  [Ageyev] Does "Volga-Dnepr" have any objectives for the very 
near future? 
  [Isaykin] Unquestionably. First of all, the airline's 
short-term goal is to become Russia's number one air freight 
company. And our long-term goal is to become one of the world's 
leading air freight companies. 
  In order to achieve these objectives, we have worked out a 
definite strategy, which includes improvement in the management 
of the company and its material and technical base and creation 
of a favorable image for the company both in our country and 
abroad, as well as superior knowledge of the world market's 
requirements for air freight service, and meeting them in a 
timely manner at the level of world standards. We are continuing 
to form our team of professionals who are prepared to work in 
other countries and we are developing an advanced system to 
provide information support. 
  We are also trying to maintain good relations with our 
partners. In many respects, we are obligated to the "Aviastar" 
AO [Joint-Stock Company]--the Ulyanovsk Aviation Industrial 
Complex, our main stockholder--for our successful activity. The 
"Aviastar" AO builds the An-124-100 "Ruslan" aircraft, which 
forms the basis of our fleet. Incidentally, there are six 
"Ruslans" in it at present. In addition, because of cooperation 
such as this we do not need spare parts for any aircraft 
equipment. 
  It seems to me that by having such support and a finely 
tuned 
operating mechanism, "Volga-Dnepr" is capable of reaching the 
goal it has set: to become Russia's leading air freight company 
and one of the leaders in air freight service in the world 
market.

<F P=106> [Interview with Yuriy Sergeyevich Kuchiyev, honored captain </F>
of the Arktika, by Dmitriy Struzhentsov: "We Are Quietly Sinking 
to the Bottom: Yuriy Kuchiyev Asserts that There Is No 
Alternative to Russian Nuclear-Powered Icebreakers"; St. 
Petersburg, date not given] 
  [Text] The name of Yuriy Sergeyevich Kuchiyev is well 
known, and not just to polar explorers. In the comparatively 
recent past, almost everyone in the former Union had heard it. 
Kuchiyev was stand-by captain of the firstcomer of the domestic 
nuclear-powered icebreaker fleet, the Lenin. The first cruise in 
navigational history of a surface ship -- the nuclear-powered 
icebreaker Arktika -- in the North Pole area was made under his 
command. 
  Now the honored captain of the Arktika is no longer 
sailing, but works on shore. As before, however, he remains a 
passionate champion and staunch defender of the nuclear-powered 
fleet. And there is something to defend and to defend against. 
  We became acquainted back in the days when the 
beautiful icebreaker Arktika left on its first cruise. Quite a 
few years have passed since then. In all, Yuriy Kuchiyev sailed 
on icebreakers for more than 40 years, including more than 20 
years on ships with nuclear-powered units. 
  [Struzhentsov] How do you feel these days? -- I asked 
Kuchiyev. -- Did the decades spent on nuclear-powered ships, in 
constant proximity to nuclear reactors, have any effect on your 
health? 
  [Kuchiyev] I gave up being a captain on the bridge on the 
insistence of physicians, because of ischemic heart disease. Did 
I receive an overdose of radiation exposure during the years of 
sailing on nuclear-powered ships? No, I did not. I make so bold 
as to state: not one of the crew members of nuclear-powered 
icebreakers has contracted radiation sickness. Moreover, I am 
convinced that the sojourn in the Arctic did them all good. Even 
though the Arctic expanses are subjected to man's destructive 
influence, the ecological situation is still much better there 
than in other areas of Russia. 
  [Struzhentsov] Do you mean that during the entire time of 
your work on nuclear-powered icebreakers, there was no threat of 
radioactive emission, of radiation danger? 
  [Kuchiyev] I affirm: there was not! Localized emergency 
situations did take place, but there were no emergencies 
threatening the environment or human health. The emergency 
safety systems on our nuclear-powered ships are absolutely 
reliable. All the many years of practical work and the highly 
professional operation of the nuclear-powered ships are 
convincing proof. 
  [Struzhentsov] But this is, so to speak, your "own" opinion. 
What about the international estimate of the safety of the 
nuclear-powered icebreaker fleet? 
  [Kuchiyev] All our nuclear-powered icebreakers were built at 
yards in Leningrad and Finland, and took their own route to the 
Arctic Ocean, with a working reactor, through Danish territorial 
waters. The Danes studied the air and water in the area of the 
icebreakers very carefully, and not once did they detect the 
slightest traces of radiation. Our crew watched the Danish 
high-speed launches take samples of the water near the very 
screw propellers of the Arktika, watched helicopters circling 
above us, taking air samples. Later on we learned from the 
Danish press that neither the water nor the air caused any alarm 
among the Danish people. In addition, cruises of nuclear-powered 
icebreakers carrying foreign tourists to the North Pole have now 
become quite popular. Is this not an argument in favor of the 
safety of our nuclear-powered ships? 
  [Struzhentsov] But why, then, don't the United States and 
Canada, let us say, have any nuclear-powered icebreakers? 
  [Kuchiyev] They have no North Sea route. For the time being 
the United States does not need a powerful icebreaker fleet with 
unlimited cruising capacity just for sailing in the Canadian 
archipelago and in Arctic waters. But we simply cannot do 
without it. After all, the North Sea route is the reliable 
transport artery, without which the development and operation of 
the natural riches of the Arctic -- Russia's main economic 
reserve -- would be unthinkable. Normal operation of the North 
Sea route without a modern nuclear-powered icebreaker fleet 
would be impossible! 
  [Struzhentsov] Why is diesel-electric power inferior? 
  [Kuchiyev] First of all, with respect to fuel and water, 
ships of this class do not have sufficient cruising capacity. 
The most unpleasant thing is that they are destructive to the 
Arctic because of their oil spills. It is onerous for the crews 
to operate the diesel-electric mastodons which represent 
yesterday's icebreaker building. There is no alternative in the 
foreseeable future to the powerful nuclear-powered icebreakers 
in the Arctic, and indeed in the freezing seas of Northern 
Russia. It is a pity that many people do not accept this truth. 
We remember an incident which occurred in Magadan, the residents 
of which would not let the newest nuclear-powered LASH ship, 
Sevmorput, with cargo for the Arctic inhabitants, into the port. 
This stems from technical ignorance and, of course, the 
Chernobyl syndrome. As they say, "once burned, twice shy." 
Magadan and other remote ports of the North will not survive 
without modern nuclear-powered ships. 
  [Struzhentsov] You are not denying, though, that accidents 
have happened on nuclear-powered ships? 
  [Kuchiyev] They have. For example, on the Arktika, in the 
first navigation periods, the screws broke. We repaired them 
ourselves at sea. Difficult, divers' work, but fully within 
reach of the crew. This has nothing to do, however, with the 
power unit. With competent servicing, it will not let us down. 
As for what happened at Chernobyl -- this was first and foremost 
the result of scandalous sloppiness, which, thank God, we don't 
yet have in the fleet. Indeed, the safety systems on 
nuclear-powered ships are very sound. You must address nuclear 
power only as "Sir." In the past, our chief scientific director, 
the now late academician, Anatoliy Aleksandrov, staunchly 
defended the prestige and authority of nuclear power. He seemed 
to foresee that any misfortune that happened in nuclear power 
engineering could throw everything back that science and 
practical experience had achieved over many years. That is what 
happened at Chernobyl.... 
  [Struzhentsov] What specifically do you have in mind, in 
paying Academician Aleksandrov such a compliment? 
  [Kuchiyev] Here is a simple example for you. In order for 
the 
politburo to make a decision on the Arktika's cruise to the 
North Pole, an official certificate, signed by the minister of 
the Maritime Fleet and the president of the Academy of Sciences, 
was required. Well, Minister Guzhenko signed this paper, but 
Academician Aleksandrov abstained from signing. He explained 
that he was completely comfortable with the nuclear-powered 
unit, but he was afraid that, as had already happened, the screw 
or propeller shaft would suddenly "fly off," and this could 
spoil the expedition, and then the prestige of the 
nuclear-powered icebreaker would inevitably be damaged. After 
all, our country is not accustomed to looking for reasons: if 
something does not turn out right -- everything is bad. Of 
course, we were all lucky that the cruise, which took place 
after all, went off successfully. The straightforward 
academician was the first to send on board the Arktika a 
telegram with the frank words: "You know that I was against your 
cruise, but now I am proud of you." In actuality, he was much 
happier about the success than others were. After all, Anatoliy 
Petrovich is the person whose learning and efforts created our 
naval and peacetime nuclear-powered fleet. 
  [Struzhentsov] At that time Academician Aleksandrov had 
every 
reason for joy. But how do you think he would feel, if he were 
alive today? 
  [Kuchiyev] It is difficult even to conjecture. Something 
inexplicable is taking place. The nuclear-powered fleet, which 
has proven itself in full measure, and which has a superb base 
in Murmansk, is slowly surrendering position. The icebreaker 
Lenin, with a power complex which has served out its utility, 
but still has excellently preserved interiors, made by the 
Petersburg experts, stands idle in Murmansk. The Arctic seamen 
came forth with a proposal to convert the first nuclear-powered 
icebreaker in the world into a museum, to preserve this amazing 
creation of domestic science and technology for their 
descendants. Anatoliy Sobchak, mayor of St. Petersburg, gave the 
"okay" for perpetual mooring of the nuclear-powered ship on the 
Neva -- the birthplace of the Lenin. Things have come to a 
standstill, however: there are no funds. 
  Repair of the nuclear-powered icebreakers Arktika and Sibir 
is being held up for the same reason. The icebreaker fleet is 
not being replenished. The most modern nuclear-powered 
icebreaker, the Ural, is lying idle at the outfitting dock of 
the Baltic Shipyard. It is over 50-percent finished. It is 
already fitted out with main and auxiliary turbogenerators and a 
propeller unit, and there is a nuclear-powered unit to be 
finished. The icebreaker could go off on a voyage after two 
years of intensive work. All work on finishing construction has 
been suspended, though. The yard's director has sent telegrams 
around to the suppliers on canceling the contracts: the yard has 
no funds to finish work on the icebreaker, and the very 
expensive equipment installed finds itself threatened with ruin. 
  All this is very alarming. The decline of the North Sea 
route 
is beginning. Unless this misfortune is averted, it will be hard 
to count on the regeneration of the Russian economy, since 
unless Arctic Siberia participates in this process, the problem 
cannot be solved. 
  Finally, we have not fulfilled our duty to our ancestors, 
who 
passed down to us the baton of purposeful development of the 
Arctic. After all, the cruises of our nuclear-powered 
icebreakers to the North Pole region were made, not for the sake 
of publicity, but in the name of charting the shortest 
high-latitude routes for transit transport operations between 
the Atlantic and Pacific oceans.

<F P=106> [Interview with Nikolay Kirillovich Maksyut, director of the </F>
Volgograd Shipyard, by Valentina Nikiforova: "Kings and Beggars"] 
  [Text] Nikolay Kirillovich Maksyut readily agreed to 
chat, even though it is not easy for the director of the large 
enterprise to find a spare hour. The director of the Volgograd 
Shipyard is worried about his collective, and is seeking 
like-minded people throughout the USSR (not once did he call it 
the "former"), in order to save the people from below, in an 
enterprising way, to save the state from ... the state. 
  "You know what a terrible sign it is: this year we 
accepted no young specialists into production!" he noted. 
  [Nikiforova] So what is it, is this a managerial mutiny? 
  [Maksyut] Indeed, what nerves one must have to endure 
something like this?! In the three years of reform, the yard has 
lost 3,500 people. And what kind of people! Skillful hands. 
Production is being cut back. Whereas in 1990 we produced 20 
units, last year we turned over 3! The government is not 
granting long-term loans, and short-term ones are no support for 
serious production. 
  [Nikiforova] How is the enterprise getting by? 
  [Maksyut] It's a good thing that they need a fleet abroad, 
we 
are surviving by means of real currency. Last year we concluded 
a contract to build ten dry cargo ships, we are turning over 
four this year, and the rest over the next two years. Note this: 
we are selling to foreign firms. The Germans and the Dutch need 
ships, but Russia, it turns out, does not need them. 
  [Nikiforova] The yard has become a joint-stock company. In 
the logical course of events, shipbuilding should get financial 
replenishment. 
  [Maksyut] At first we too believed this. We took the second 
variant of privatization, and bought up 51 percent of the shares 
through the privatization fund. Because of the fact that Chubays 
had to buy 80 percent of the shares for vouchers alone, though, 
we got very little. 
  [Nikiforova] It turns out that ownership brings only 
trouble. 
What is the workers' attitude toward this? 
  [Maksyut] They are not in a very good mood. The average wage 
is 71,000 rubles [R]. By general agreement, we decided not to 
pay dividends so far -- nothing to pay them with. True, we found 
the "thirteenth-month wage," we are subsidizing half the cost of 
dinners in the dining hall. The exorbitant rise in prices is 
forcing people to get themselves out of the mess, it is pushing 
them to crime: it is a paradox, but people, owners of the 
enterprise, have begun to steal more. From themselves! Laziness 
is increasing. You have a top specialist getting 4-5-fold less 
than, for example, an operator at a thermal power station. 
Unless the government makes a sensible decision, the yard's 
reserves are enough for two to three months. We, the members of 
the rayon council of directors, warned the authorities of this. 
They answered us: "Do not dramatize!" After all, though, the 
people can go out on the streets without any notice. The 
directors are restraining this today. But tomorrow? 
  [Nikiforova] Are there political forces -- parties, 
movements 
-- which would help the people to understand the situation? 
Perhaps the trade unions will support the workers? 
  [Maksyut] Serious work must be done at the enterprises right 
now -- to help rescue production and to preserve the work 
places. But who will do it? The communist party knows how to do 
this, but, unfortunately, it has removed itself from the working 
people. The trade unions? Yes, perhaps. But they, in my opinion, 
are the same everywhere -- they seek agreements rather with the 
government than with the working people. Unless the trade 
unions, together with the government, come out against 
industry's landslide in the near future, there will soon no 
longer be any need for them. 
  [Nikiforova] All the same, what is the way out? 
  [Maksyut] Let us ask the people. 
<H8>  * * * </H8>
  I did ask them. At one of the shops, the way out was 
designated in few precise words: re-election of the president 
and a change of government. "I used to live like a king on R132 
pension, but now I live like a beggar on R80,000," concluded a 
worker at the very large shipyard.

<F P=106> [Article by P.K. Shtepenko and M.A. Katser, VElNII AO: "A </F>
New Designator System for Mainline Electric Locomotives"] 
  [Text] By order of the minister of Railways, No 22Ts, 
of 15 May 1984, a digital system for designation of rolling 
stock was introduced for computer processing of information on 
its operation. Today it is functioning along with the accepted 
designation of the series. An article by V.A. Rakov (see ETT 
[ELECTRICHESKAYA I TEPLOVOZNAYA TYAGA] No 3, 1985), told how the 
existing system was formed. It did not, however, reflect the 
shortcomings of the designations of mainline electric 
locomotives. Suggestions for a new system were brought into the 
published article in the form of a discussion. 
  We know that in 1932, in memory of V.I. Lenin, series of 
electric locomotives began to be designated by the two letters 
"VL." The first domestic mainline electric locomotive was given 
the designation VL19-01, where the number 19 designated the 
pressure of the wheelpair axle on the rails in tonnes, and 01 -- 
the ordinal number. 
  An analogous procedure was extended to the following series 
as well: VL22, VL22M. In the future, locomotives began to be 
designated N8, NO, N60, N80, where the letter "N" attested that 
the machines were manufactured at the Novocherkassk Electric 
Locomotive Building Plant. The remaining figures and letters 
designated: "eight-axle direct current," "single-phase," 
"six-axle single-phase," "eight-axle single-phase." Electric 
locomotives built at the Tbilisi Electric Locomotive Building 
Plant had in their name the letter "T," for example T8 -- 
eight-axle direct current electric locomotive. 
  In 1963, at the demand of the MPS [Ministry of Railways], 
the 
letter designations of electric locomotives manufactured earlier 
were replaced by "VL." Moreover, it was ordered that direct 
current locomotives be designated by numbers up to 39, and 
alternating current -- from 40 up. Electric locomotives of the 
last few years had the designations VL10, VL11, VL15, VL41, 
VL62, VL65, VL84, VL85 and VL86. The existing system, therefore, 
has no real meaning, except for the type of current. 
  In reality, direct current electric locomotives VL10 and 
VL11 
are eight-axle, and VL15 -- 12-axle, i.e., there is no 
information on the difference in the number of axles. The 
situation is the same with direct current locomotives, where the 
numbers 6 and 8 formerly designated "six-axle" and "eight-axle." 
After the output of 12-axle electric locomotives VL85 and VL86, 
this meaning too was lost. 
  Specialists of the VElNII AO [All-Union Electric Locomotive 
Building Scientific Research Institute Joint Stock Company] 
developed and have proposed for discussion a new system of 
designating mainline electric locomotives. It is notable for its 
simplicity and bears a meaningful load: the type of current and 
service, the number of axles, the distinguishing features of the 
design of the tractive motors and the form of modernization. The 
symbols of the new system are presented in the table.

                                                            12             twelve-axle    1, 2, 3...     form of 
                                                                                                         modernization 


  It uses the necessary and sufficient number of symbols, 
making it possible to use the designations with the aid of a 
computer. The system of designating mainline electric 
locomotives takes into consideration the current level of 
structural execution of locomotives and the prospects for 
further development of electric locomotive building. 
  We will give a few examples of the designations: S12 -- 
freight, 12-axle direct current electric locomotive with 
commutator traction motors; P8 -- freight, eight-axle direct 
current locomotive with commutator traction motors; SP6A -- 
passenger, six-axle alternating current electric locomotives 
with asynchronous traction motors; D8 --freight, eight-axle 
dual-feed locomotives with commutator traction motors. 
  When necessary, there can be a letter designating the 
manufacturing plant before the designation of the electric 
locomotive series, as for example, "N" -- Novocherkassk.

<F P=106> [Interview with Deputy Minister of Railways K. Salatov by </F>
GUDOK correspondent Viktor Peremyshlev: "Maximum Convenience and 
Service for the Passenger"] 
  [Text] Passenger transportation is continuously in 
the ministry's field of vision. Three times as many collegium 
sessions were devoted to it last year alone. Specific measures 
were outlined, and the railroads were given instructions on 
improving the organization and quality of passenger services at 
terminals and on trains. A special government decree on suburban 
services was issued at the initiative of the MPS [Ministry of 
Railways]. However, it was noted at the last collegium meeting 
(December 1993) that the gain expected from the measures 
outlined was not received. Our correspondent talks with Deputy 
Minister K. Salatov today about the problems facing the 
passenger transportation complex and the steps that need to be 
taken to improve its work. 
  [Peremyshlev] Kim Khamitovich, it has been about 3 months 
since you began studying passenger service problems, and after 
these 100 days, it is assumed that a report will be made to the 
public on what you have managed to accomplish. Can we expect 
somthing such as this from you at the forthcoming collegium at 
the beginning of April? 
  [Salatov] This period--100 days--is not long enough to be 
able to introduce radical changes in the work of this complex. 
Without repeating what has been approved in the collegium 
meetings, I will note one feature: their decisions were 
predominantly oriented toward the passengers' interests in many 
respects. But look at what is taking place on the trains, in the 
terminals, in our entire area of service. The attitude toward 
passengers has been callous, and it remains that way. But after 
all, if a person pays more for a fare than he did before, he 
should receive more in the form of attention, services, and 
simply a respectful attitude. 
  [Peremyshlev] Frankly speaking, I did not expect that our 
conversation would begin in precisely this way. Although not 
everything is simple here. The same crudeness by the 
conductor--this is not only a display of bad behavior, but a 
result of the poor condition of the rolling stock and economic 
disorders. Today, as an example, a dishonest conductor "has" 
much more than an honest one--for carrying extra baggage, 
"stowaways," and other "services." 
  [Salatov] Well, every family has its black sheep. But a 
conductor's wage is not bad at all--an average of 200,000 
rubles, besides the out-of-town assignment and other payments. 
Add to this the stability of his social position based on the 
wage agreement. And it is becoming apparent that the problem is 
not with his economic status, and not even in the peculiarities 
of his character, although there is reason to think there has 
been poor personnel selection. 
  Look at the flight attendant on an airplane. She radiates 
kindness and respect. The flight attendant undergoes testing and 
takes a special training course. They follow roughly the same 
procedure on American railroads, by the way. If we tested for 
occupational suitability and studied personnel selection... I am 
certain that the human factor comes into action before the 
economic factor or any other factor. We have become accustomed 
to boorishness, I believe. But after all, we are standing on the 
threshold of competition for transport services. There are huge 
"Icaruses" today at the Kursk and the Kazan terminals. And their 
invitations guarantee that they will take passengers quickly and 
comfortably to Ryazan and other cities. And the buses are 
crowded as well. 
  We are talking about financial losses in the billions. But 
some trains are half-empty today. The railroads do not want to 
cut back the amount of traffic. Then they should look for an 
opportunity to fill up the railcars! We cannot make up for 
financial losses by rate indexing alone. We have to respect the 
laws of economics: the relative expenditures can only be reduced 
by an increase in transport volume. So we have to fight for the 
passenger. By giving him more comfort. So this year we have set 
the target of 70 company trains. 
  [Peremyshlev] We have 52 now. 
  [Salatov] Yes. Nearly 200 consists. The company trains 
differ 
sharply from the normal trains. They are filled, even though a 
ticket on them is 1.5 times more expensive. You automatically 
begin thinking about what the passenger needs. He needs comfort, 
convenience, and good service. 
  We cannot make 100 percent of the trains company trains, of 
course. And this is not necessary, either: we have a 
responsibility to keep trains less expensive. But we have to 
raise the level of normal trains up to the level of company 
trains. 
  [Peremyshlev] Should I interpret your words to mean that 
service is the most important element which can raise passenger 
transportation to a new level? 
  [Salatov] Absolutely correct. Creating conditions for the 
passenger which suit him completely. I think this is the key to 
success. 
  [Peremyshlev] I would like to ask a more specific question: 
if we find fine people who put their heart into their work, put 
them in a dilapidated railcar where the heating does not work, 
the boiler is broken, on a train that is always late, won't this 
brutalize even the most good-natured person under such 
conditions? And he will have to hear a great deal that is 
unpleasant from the passengers as well. 
  [Salatov] A complaint we received recently spoke of just 
such 
a situation. In February, we took 184 children on vacation from 
a special school in Moscow. The railcars had no belts on the 
generators, and hence there was no light. They are not heated. 
There was no tea or anything. I asked the railroad that made up 
the train: how could such a thing happen? This is irresponsible! 
Of those who prepared these three railcars and those who gave 
the order to connect them up. And of the conductors as well. 
  Irresponsibility and carelessness--this is the problem of 
problems today. A sanitary inspector forbids the railcars from 
being used, but there is a slipshod individual who does not 
respond to his reprimands and puts a railcar in the train 
anyway. And such actions cannot be justified by our poverty or 
any shortages--we are more irresponsible than we are poor. 
  Our attention to the traveler should begin at the cashier's 
window in the terminal. But why is there no advertisement: "Dear 
passengers! To ensure your safety, we cannot carry more than 36 
kilograms of baggage. Turn the rest over to the baggage car." 
No, the ministry order on this is read over the terminal radio, 
at best. 
  [Peremyshlev] So good decisions are being made, but they are 
not being carried out. One of the reasons you cited was 
carelessness. What else? 
  [Salatov] You are right, it would be too obvious if 
everything were explained by this. Passenger problems require 
constant and continuous attention. But at times we lose sight of 
them. This inattentiveness stems from the inertia in our 
thinking: when there was a huge volume of freight being carried, 
the passenger runs were given credit at their own expense and 
attention was given to them in accordance with the residual 
principle, so to speak. Today, when the freight runs have 
declined, we should turn our attention to passenger services. 
But the dispatchers still give first attention to the freight 
trains. Just as before, they are encouraged to let the freight 
runs pass through first of all. 
  The last collegium meeting approved a new schedule in which 
priority is given to passenger trains. So the mental 
reorientation is under way, all the same. 
  [Peremyshlev] You said that decisions were made at the 
collegium meetings on services for passengers, based mainly on 
their interests. I had occasion to attend practically all the 
meetings mentioned, but in the documents presented at them I did 
not see any results of the sociological study of the phenomenon 
which is called passenger flow in official language. The 
migration by people, passengers' preferences, the social status 
of the average passenger--a million questions arise. But where 
are the answers? Didn't you reach that point? 
  [Salatov] I cannot agree that we did not reach this point. 
Obviously, the residual principle is being discussed here as 
well. There are no services on the railroads which have really 
devoted study to marketing. Ask the commander of the appropriate 
service how the passenger flow is studied, and you will hear: it 
increases or decreases. But they will not say why. They do not 
know. 
  A department for this has been formed in the Passenger Main 
Administration. But I personally do not see the amount of work I 
am describing. In any event, they are not conducting any surveys 
or studying... 
  [Peremyshlev] Have they postponed it for the future? 
  [Salatov] We are putting off too much until the future. As 
an 
example, the railcar problem... In order to provide good service 
for the passenger, as you noted, a properly equipped railcar is 
needed. 
  But what can we give the passenger when there aren't enough 
railcars even for the company trains, which should meet the 
sectorial standard for a "firm." 
  Deliveries from Germany are being cut back under the slogan 
of the need to develop domestic passenger railcar manufacturing. 
At the same time, it is planned to allocate funds from the 
budget to purchase the Tver railcars for exactly one-third of 
the target given to the plant. We are trying to help the Tver 
workers to obtain materials for production, but they also need 
money to survive. Railroads will continue to be the predominant 
form of transportation in the future in Russia. And this must be 
considered the principal social task for railroad workers. And 
the organs which are obliged to bear this in mind should not 
tell us: "These are your problems!" 
  The priorities should not simply be declared, but provided 
for financially. But for the present... The rates are monitored 
by the state and regulated by it. They do not provide for the 
sums to obtain railcars. This would require the cost of a fare 
to be substantially increased, which is simply impossible under 
current conditions. 
  But how do we provide for quality in passenger services when 
they are unprofitable and there are no subsidies? It is becoming 
more and more difficult for us every day to keep our form of 
transportation the most accessible and widely used. 
  In addition to the rolling stock, there are the tracks, the 
technical structures, the terminals... Our comrades stopped at 
the terminal in Washington at one time and could not understand 
whether it was a terminal or a concert hall: there were exhibits 
and concerts on the upper floors... You published a good series 
on the terminals in Moscow. We have to look throughout Russia 
for what is good and bad and provide the passenger with the 
maximum amount of service which he needs. I repeat--we must 
fight for the passenger! 
  [Peremyshlev] Kim Khamitovich, are you a realist? 
  [Salatov] Both a realist and an optimist. 
  [Peremyshlev] So much of what has been mentioned today will 
be done? 
  [Salatov] A great deal has already been done today. And 
without large capital investments. We have to develop what we 
have. We have good reserves to carry out the collegium 
decisions. We have to set ourselves the task of fulfilling them 
to the maximum extent possible. This is the key to success. 
  We have many ideas. We have to work. I am confident that the 
forthcoming collegium meeting will take place with this attitude 
as well. Passenger services are a major aspect of our work. And 
we all must apply ourselves to it with responsibility.

<F P=106> [Article by B. Shokhin, deputy general director of the </F>
Moscow Municipal State Industrial Railroad Transport Enterprise, 
chief inspector for Traffic Safety: "Without Accident or Injury: 
Work at the Moscow Promzheldortrans Enterprise"] 
  [Text] A year ago, on 30 March, GUDOK published an 
appeal from the collective of the Moscow State Promzheldortrans 
Enterprise to the railroad workers and to all workers, calling 
for transport work to be performed in 1993 without wrecks, 
accidents or injuries. 
  The year passed, and it was revealed that 
Promzheldortrans did not take the words as just idle talk: 
during the past year and the first quarter of this one, it did 
not permit a single wreck nor production injury. 
  How did they succeed in achieving these results? We 
asked B. Shokhin, deputy general director of the Moscow 
Municipal State Industrial Railroad Transport Enterprise, chief 
inspector for Traffic Safety, to tell us. 
  Our proposal may have seemed adventurous to some people, but 
all our production subdivisions took it very seriously and 
responsibly. We have been working toward this goal for several 
years, realizing that you can't eliminate defects by waving a 
magic wand, you need solid organizational and technological 
running time. Therefore we first prepared a bridgehead from 
which we could assume the offensive. 
  For example, we were the first on the railroad network to 
introduce a system of accident-free work: "Foresight is a pledge 
of safety." Having become familiar with this, the specialists 
most likely would not find any innovations for themselves which 
would not be known to our colleagues from other enterprises and 
roads. It is my firm conviction that this is not required. One 
thing is necessary when working with rolling stock: impeccable 
adherence to the rules for technical operation and instructions 
and orders, for the slightest deviation from them is fraught 
with peril -- and commanders of all ranks must establish rigid 
monitoring of the entire technological chain. 
  At selector conferences, when the question of traffic safety 
would come up, we most often heard complaints that the rails 
were extremely worn (especially on the enterprise track spurs, 
where we have to do our main amount of work), that railcars 
needing repair are in operation everywhere, and that 
loading-unloading mechanisms often get out of order, and indeed, 
are often of an obsolete design. All this is true. For some 
reason, though, in discussing the problems of safety, 
increasingly fewer people have paid attention to the human 
factor. When an accident happens, then as a rule, we find out: 
It was not the equipment that let us down, but the person 
controlling it. 
  Therefore, having begun to introduce an accident-free 
system, 
we waged a most decisive battle against those who violated work 
discipline. A drunken person is dangerous at any production 
facility, but especially at a transport facility: after all, in 
this case, he risks not only his own life, but also the lives of 
other people. We must remember what tremendous material damage 
an accident on the railroad incurs. It is not by chance that 
medical monitoring is compulsory for locomotive crews and 
yardmasters before they go on for their shift. We decided among 
ourselves at the enterprise to make this more severe: we perform 
it not only before a team goes to work, but after the shift. A 
foreman who conceals a violation of discipline or lets an 
engineer (yardmaster) go to work when he is drunk will be fired 
from the enterprise, rather than the violator. Even before, we 
were forced to apply these strict sanctions. They proved to be 
effective -- we have not encountered drunkenness at the work 
place for three years now. We were forced to let go the ones who 
could not take themselves in hand, but those who were inclined 
to go on drinking bouts, but valued their work at our enterprise 
had to combat the unhealthy habit for themselves. 
  Having got rid of our drunks, we are strictly adhering to 
our 
rules -- not to accept for work people who have been dismissed 
from other enterprises for the same reason. Every quarter, I 
personally take to the road administration lists of engineers 
who have been deprived of the right to drive locomotives for 
some specific reason. We send these lists to all the 
subdivisions: not a single violator who has been fired from the 
railroad will find any sympathy from our staff members. To this 
kind of person we state: Before you take on the control of 
equipment, you will learn to control yourself. 
  In introducing the accident-free work system, we certified 
all the workers and regularly conduct recertification. This is a 
very serious examination for everyone. Let us say, an engineer 
and a yardmaster should have an impeccable knowledge not only of 
the rules of technical operation and safety, but of all the 
special features of the sections which they handle. We handle, 
as you know, the enterprises of the capital. The line within the 
city limits has an abundance of curves, grades and upgrades. An 
engineer who does shunting work should, of course, as they say, 
know with his eyes closed where the downgrade or ascending grade 
begins and be particularly attentive at sections with small 
radius curves. As should, by the way, yardmasters. An engineer 
is categorically forbidden to put a locomotive into motion until 
he is certain (visually or by radio) where the yardmaster is at 
the given moment. 
  We have also resorted to a number of additional measures. 
Considering the present technical condition of the track and the 
rolling stock, we have restricted speeds in order to eliminate 
damage. For example, when a locomotive approaches a consist, the 
norm-set speed should not exceed 5 kilometers an hour, but we 
have restricted it to 1.5 kilometers an hour, and when a consist 
is fed under a trestle or when it is removed after loading or 
unloading, from 15 to 3 kilometers an hour. With movement along 
a curve with a radius of less than 120 meters, we have reduced 
it from 15 to 5 kilometers a hour. 
  One often hears today that, with the transition to new 
economic relations, the need for monitoring adherence to 
discipline and the rules of safety has disappeared. People 
interested in the end result of work, on which their wages 
depend, will of themselves, without prodding, perform their 
duties conscientiously. They will not tolerate being alongside 
those who violate discipline or are sloppy workers. It is 
possible that when the market economy, moreover a civilized one, 
not the one that we have, becomes firmly established, it will be 
this way. For the time being, though, monitoring is necessary. 
  Incidentally, it exists, and much more strictly than in our 
country, in the highly developed capitalist states. We also 
attribute paramount importance to monitoring functions. All the 
divisions, enterprises and sections have been assigned a command 
staff. Nor have we given up holding the "Safety and Labor Safety 
Practice Days." In preparing for them, we organize surprise 
checks, and moreover, on both the day and night shifts. I 
emphasize the word, surprise. 
  It is no secret that we most often have occasion to 
encounter 
violations on paydays. With the approval of the work 
collectives, we issue wages once a month (formerly, as at most 
enterprises, we paid them twice a month). On those days we step 
up the monitoring at all the subdivisions. 
  There is one more innovation which we are striving to comply 
with without delay. Our production commanders are obliged to 
check the working ability of all their subordinates every 
one-and-half hours in the course of a work shift. How to get to 
the work places, whether to call a subordinate to their offices 
by radio or through public safety inspectors -- that is for them 
to decide. The main thing is to put in place a covering force to 
avert violations of labor safety practices, and thus 
sub-standard work or an accident. Incidentally, with a staff of 
800 people, over 250 of them are public traffic safety 
inspectors. 
  The introduction of an accident-free work system also made 
us 
correct the regulations on material incentive. The criteria for 
a favorable evaluation of the work of each brigade are the 
absence of sub-standard work, injury, outbreak of fire and 
damage to rolling stock, and after that, labor productivity and 
the profit obtained. 
  None of what I have said means that the problems of 
introducing new equipment, advanced technology and the technical 
state of transport developments have, as it were, been pushed 
into the background. In this respect we have been lucky, since 
the leading transport institutes are located in Moscow, and we 
have the opportunity of being the first to test their scientific 
developments and put them into operation. 
  In conclusion, I wish to say that the accident-free work 
system that we introduced will prove itself as effective only 
when the entire set of measures is applied, from organizational 
to technological. The experience that we have accumulated shows 
that, even in the present difficult economic situation, one can 
work without accidents and injuries, or at least reduce them to 
a minimum. We have called upon and still call upon all railroad 
workers to do this.

<F P=106> [Article by Shamiram Agabekyan: "Armenia on the Threshold of </F>
Voucherization. Prime Minister Bagratyan Predicts Our Fate"] 
  [Text] As has already been reported, participating in the 
discussions in the office of the Ramkavar-Azatakan of Armenia 
Party were not only representatives of sociopolitical 
organizations, members of parliament, and specialists, but also 
Prime Minister of the Republic of Armenia Grant Bagratyan. 
  As for the political forces represented in the discussion, 
all of them were, to put it mildly, extremely skeptical both of 
the reforms and of their authors and supporters. This is 
apparently why the discussion amounted to only conceptual 
criticism. Thus in the view of the Agrarian-Democratic Party, 
the economic transformations are lacking an ideological concept, 
they do not have a social base, and they do not go beyond 
solving purely technical problems (Mels Mkrtchyan). And the 
Constitutional Law Union thinks that the theory of Jeffrey 
Sachs, a professor at Harvard University in the United States, 
is being deliberately transplanted to Armenian soil. But our 
shock therapy is also being carried out with local 
peculiarities: Instead of obedience to the law on property, we 
have a proliferation of clans usurping spheres of the economy. 
Instead of the idea of forming a national bourgeoisie proclaimed 
by the government, we have primitive polarization of society. 
  In the view of the representative of the Ramkavar-Azatakan 
of 
Armenia Party, Gagik Galstyan, it is wrong to speak of the 
establishment of a market economy in Armenia because a 
transition to private property does not mean the establishment 
of the market. Different principles are required: In particular, 
competition and the corresponding pricing system, which we do 
not have, but still there has been a dispersion of resources, 
leakage of capital and cadres... 
  Leonid Akonyan, representative of the Communist Party of 
Armenia, thought that for some reason the organizers and 
implementers of the reform equate destatization with 
privatization, while reforming the economy of the former GDR in 
Germany lasted for 10 years, and hundreds of billions of marks 
were allotted for these purposes. Such speedy and random 
privatization, in L. Akonyan's view, is merely a repetition of 
[word illegible] experience of voucher reforms, and that is all. 
  While advising acceleration of privatization as a whole, 
quite a few critical remarks were directed against the 
government by a member of the Union of Merchants, Manuk 
Gasparyan. I think there will be an opportunity to return to his 
speech in one of the next few issues of GOLOS ARMENII, but now I 
shall discuss the speech of Prime Minister of the Republic of 
Armenia Grant Bagratyan--helmsman of the Armenian version of the 
reforms and a passionate champion of them. 
  Grant Bagratyan, while recognizing that dozens of mistakes 
have been made during the process of reforming the economy, 
still sees the overall trend as positive. The prime minister did 
not deny the possibility of mistakes in the future because this 
is not a repeated process but one-time actions, and actions that 
affect the interests of the socium, which break down its 
customary way of life. The government perceives this as a 
natural pattern. 
  Whether slowly or quickly, privatization will take 
place--the 
government sees as its main task making sure that this process 
is controllable. For a random and uncontrolled outcome caused by 
too much haste specifically in industry will lead to the 
appearance of a mass deprivatization war. With such a turn of 
events not only Armenia but any other state would fail to hold 
up on the financial or social, or moral, or political plane. 
  Incidentally, this could be avoided if the labor collectives 
were certain that the changes that were made corresponded 
completely to the spirit and letter of the law. Well, what about 
the law itself? In Bagratyan's view, the legal vacuum is broad. 
To this day we have not defined what property is and what 
property is considered to be. To this day we have no law on 
citizenship, on deposits, on bankruptcy, we have not determined 
the status of public and private joint-stock companies, we have 
not decided the fate of productions operating at a loss. With 
the reality being like this, property will be distributed and 
rights will be granted without determining responsibilities. 
  As the prime minister stated, privatization is not an end in 
itself but the creation of a field for effective activity. And 
the elimination of state property is the only means. As 
corroboration for what he said he gave this example: When the 
government was analyzing budget incomes and expenditures it 
became clear that each year 1,700,000 tonnes of garbage are 
taken from the capital alone. And only 10 percent of the cost is 
paid from local funds and the rest comes from the budget. But 
this quantity of garbage does not physically exist. 
  The prime minister was referring to the fact that the 
parliament absolutely does not take into account these 
government services--maneuvering and balancing with state 
property under conditions of free prices. So during the 
discussion of the budget, with whose professional level Grant 
Bagratyan was extremely dissatisfied, they did not even raise 
the question of how, for example, the construction of a building 
is financed or how the cost of the shipment of that same garbage 
is determined. 
  As the prime minister said, when creating a state it is 
necessary on the move to turn over the layers of a whole epoch. 
A pedantic, bureaucratized government could reject the process 
of privatization altogether, claiming, if nothing else, that it 
does not know to whom it should distribute the certificates. 
Incidentally, there are many "buts" of this kind. 
  Even with successful privatization of 80 percent of the 
enterprises, the distribution of the limited centralized 
resources will be extremely problematic because of the lack of a 
mechanism for this. Take just electric energy and water. On the 
one hand it is necessary to proceed from the effectiveness of 
the output. But we must not cast privatized enterprises to the 
caprice of fate. Just because, say, Armelektromash is privatized 
this does not mean that its problems are automatically solved, 
and at least the supply of metal must be regulated at the state 
level, that is, through the efforts of the government. 
  With all this, measures are also being taken to render 
assistance to privatized enterprises. Thus a club of 
entrepreneurs is being created and it will have the opportunity 
to meet regularly with the government in order to solve problems 
jointly. 
  Grant Bagratyan included purely organizational problems in 
another group of measures. Within two or three weeks the 
republic will receive all kinds of vouchers. At the same time 
the tax and customs services are being technically re-equipped, 
which, in particular, will help to avoid negative occurrences in 
the customs system. It will also be necessary to revise the 
structure for administration of the economy. 
  In general and on the whole the prime minister considers it 
realistic to begin the privatization of small facilities in May 
and enterprises in June, and also to complete some of the unpaid 
privatization by the beginning of September. 
  The prime minister did not deny that there have been and 
will 
continue to be omissions here because it is not at all easy to 
draw up a list of 15,000 facilities. But he assures us that the 
plan that has been chosen, the alternatives, and also the laws 
that have been adopted will create better conditions in Armenia 
than are found in Russia. In April of last year the "Armenian" 
version was discussed in the Hague with the participation of the 
World Bank, and it gained approval. This has to do with 
privatization of enterprises under the conditions of the 
notorious 20 percent. This has to do also with the fact that the 
"Armenian" version to a certain degree precludes the sad Russian 
experience when, for example, the president of a joint-stock 
company, deciding to earn $2 million, sends the company's funds 
abroad. 
  The unpreparedness of the corps of directors causes the 
prime 
minister to have misgivings. Nor do we have the corresponding 
socium, which would bring pressure to bear on the leaders of the 
joint-stock companies, forcing them to function effectively. In 
the prime minister's view, no ideology, even the very best, can 
provide for development of minds--this takes time. And he is 
afraid that this time will also provide more occasion for 
criticism, and it cannot be ruled out that there will be 
political blackmail of the government as well. 
  But Grant Bagratyan, following Chubays' example, intends to 
say nothing since he is confident that he is carrying out a 
mission of historic significance and he must not stray from the 
path, for under conditions of free prices the state sector of 
the economy can be controlled only by political methods which, 
as he stated, will be manifested in one way or another. 
  And difficulties are inevitable when establishing a market: 
Some enterprises will stay afloat and others will not. Even 
today it is possible to tell which productions and organizations 
will "stay afloat" and which will not, because from many signs 
it is already obvious who has behaved how under the conditions 
of free prices and the transition to the market. The Institute 
of Physics provides an extremely clear example. Having found a 
practical application for its accelerator, the institute 
received an order for $2 million. Other institutes have shown 
that they have been marking time all these years and merely 
reproducing outdated developments. Of course they are doomed. 
  There is the fear that everything will be attributed to 
privatization. Moreover, against this background it is possible 
that there will be a large wave of antiprivatization, for 
everything that today is concealed from people's eyes by the 
so-called state status will come to the surface. Then it will be 
possible to see who is good and who is bad, who is able to work 
and who is not, who is stealing, who is trading, and who is 
speculating. 
  There is also the danger of the appearance of the so-called 
"Vietnam syndrome." After the end of a military confrontation 
several tens of thousands of people may make claims against the 
society: We were in the trenches and you were dividing up the 
property. We must keep an eye out for a solution to this problem 
as well. And not only on the ideological but also on the 
material plane. In any case the property owner must be prepared 
for a year or two or more to compensate, to pay for the costs of 
those who are in the mountains today, who have been wounded, who 
have become disabled... 
  The problem of the diaspora is not the least of the prime 
minister's concerns. It should not have its property rights 
encroached upon, and division into "akhtsarov" and natives must 
not be allowed. But the diaspora will have to make its way 
through moral and psychological discrimination and overcome a 
multitude of other obstacles. 
  In other words society is faced with a harsh but necessary 
transformation through which it must pass. And the more 
quickly--the less painfully. This is why with the distribution 
of vouchers the government will insist parliament allow them to 
be bought and sold, for from now on it will be simply dangerous 
to adopt half-way decisions. 
  Incidentally, with the establishment of the market, in the 
view of the prime minister, political passions will abate. And 
civil accord will be established because the new economic force 
will require stability, laws, and concrete actions. 
  Privatization will also have a favorable effect on the 
formation of the financial market and the stabilization of the 
exchange rate of the dram because a new, convertible commodity 
will be put into circulation: the property of productions--be it 
territory, machine tools, equipment... 
  Being in the best initial positions for privatization and 
having the best production potential, the republic, in 
Bagratyan's view, will soon establish itself in the region as 
completely successful. But under the condition that the natural 
course of economic transformations will not be hampered by 
powerful artificial factors in the form of escalation of the 
confrontation with Azerbaijan, etc. 
  ...Oh, those buts! Were it not for all/of them, and not 
only in the form/of external factors,/the future would look 
bright ahead, would it not?/ Alas, against the background of the 
current reality it is possible at least/to say: Oh, it is hard 
to believe!...

<F P=106> [AzerTadzh Report: "How Will We Earn and Spend Foreign </F>
Currency"] 
  [Text] The Ministry of Economics of Azerbaijan has for the 
first time prepared and submitted for the consideration of the 
Cabinet of Ministers a prognosis of the republic's foreign trade 
turnover and also a draft of the country's foreign exchange 
balance sheet for 1994. 
  As an AzerTadzh correspondent was told by the chief of the 
consolidated department of general economic and structural 
policy of the Ministry of Economics, Oktay Akhverdiyev, the 
overall volume of foreign trade turnover this year, according to 
the prognosis, should be $727 million, which is $297 million 
more than last year. Revenues from exporting goods and services, 
whose volume will reach $395 million, will increase by $160 
million mainly because of the elimination of barter 
transactions. As before, the greatest share of it will be made 
up of petroleum products (almost 40 percent) and cotton (28 
percent). 
  Iran and Turkey are still the largest exporters of 
Azerbaijan's products. It is from these countries that most of 
the goods that can safely be called "food" are exported. 
Practically all the funds allotted for it, and they amount to 
approximately $300 million, will go to purchase food products: 
55 percent of the imports will be grain, flour, and raw material 
for manufactured concentrated feeds, 33 percent--meat and 
butter, and the rest--children's food, dairy products, and other 
products. At the same time it should be noted that it was 
possible to plan on this volume of imports as a result of 
special-purpose credit from the European Council, Turkey, and 
China, the overall sum of which will be $161 million. 
  The volume of foreign trade turnover is taken into account 
in 
the draft of the foreign exchange balance sheet. The revenue 
part of it, according to the draft, will be $700 million and 
will be formed from foreign exchange revenues from export 
operations ($301 million), foreign credit ($161 million), and 
also conversion of currencies of CIS countries, customs duties 
and fees, and other sources. 
  The republic will spend less foreign exchange--about $670 
million, $410 million of which will be used for the needs of the 
national economy, including the aforementioned food imports, and 
also the purchase of medications, wheelchairs for disabled 
persons, and Ikarus passenger buses for Baku, and for solving 
problems of the railroad and the food and other branches of 
industry. Some of the foreign exchange funds are to be used for 
servicing Azerbaijan's foreign debt. 
  But still, in the words of O. Akhverdiyev, the foreign 
exchange balance sheet was drawn up taking into account the 
economic situation in the republic and its maximum capabilities, 
but not the real needs of the national economy, which amount to 
approximately $1 billion.

  [Text] About 500,000 people were subjected to repressive 
measures in Azerbaijan from 1920 through 1956, reported the 
chairman on the commission for investigating the affairs of 
victims of political repressions under the Fund for Culture of 
Azerbaijan, Murtuz Sadykhly. And 94 percent of the victims of 
repression by the Stalinist regime during the period of 
1933-1938 were individuals of Azeri nationality, although only 
70 percent of the residents of the republic at that time were 
Azeris. Practically none of the Armenians, who made up 11 
percent of the population of Azerbaijan at the time, suffered, 
not counting several families of "transgressing" Chekists: 
because 80 percent of the workers of the republic's penal organs 
were Armenians.

<F P=106> [Unattributed article: "Under the Aegis of the UN"] </F>
  [Text] Today we are presenting to the readers excerpts from 
the Aide-Memoire of the Interdepartmental UN Mission in 
Azerbaijan. 
  Our newspaper has already reported on the trip to New York 
by 
the UN representative in Azerbaijan, Dr. Mahmud el-Said. As a 
result of the negotiations that took place during the high-level 
meetings at the UN headquarters, a decision was made to send a 
special mission to Azerbaijan consisting of representatives of 
various departments, commissariats, commissions, and councils of 
the UN. 
  On the whole the presence of the mission in Azerbaijan can 
be 
considered to be a very important event. According to 
preliminary information, agreement has already basically been 
reached with the donor countries. 
  We asked Mr. Mahmud el-Said to comment on the results of the 
mission's work. 
  "The fact that the mission is coming here is the result of 
our close cooperation with the headquarters in New York and 
Geneva. The resolution previously adopted by the Security 
Council concerning the need to render humanitarian aid to 
Azerbaijan was of great significance. I am very glad that our 
efforts were not in vain. And the arrival of such a 
representative mission is a very significant result. This is the 
first time for many departments and commissions to send 
representatives to us. I am confident that from now on 
humanitarian aid to Azerbaijan will be increased considerably 
and, the main thing, it will become more diverse and targeted, 
responding to the republic's essential needs." 
<H5>  From the Aide-Memoire of the Interdepartmental UN Commission </H5>
in Azerbaijan for Preparing the Appeal to the World Community 
  The UN interdepartmental commission visited Azerbaijan 
during 
6-12 March 1994 to determine the humanitarian needs of the 
refugees who were forced to resettle and other of the more 
vulnerable segments of the population during the period from 1 
April through 31 December 1994. The information gathered by the 
mission will be used when preparing the interdepartmental UN 
appeal for Azerbaijan, which will be submitted for mobilization 
of funds by donor countries in April 1994. 
  The mission was headed by the UN Department on Humanitarian 
Issues (OGV). It consisted of representatives from UNESCO, 
UNICEF, the UN Volunteer Program (PDO), the World Food Program 
(VPP), United Nations Office of the High Commissioner for 
Refugees (UNHCR), the Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO), 
the World Health Organization (WHO), and International 
Organization for Migration (IOM). The mission was greeted and 
accompanied by the UN representative in the Azerbaijan Republic. 
The mission was given support from local representatives of the 
aforementioned organizations and also from the representative of 
the UN PR [expansion not indicated]. The mission would like to 
express its special gratitude to His Excellency Mr. President, 
the speaker of parliament, the deputy prime minister for 
humanitarian issues, the ministers and members of the 
government, and also the authorities of Imishli, Bardy, and 
Svatly, who rendered able assistance to the mission. 
  The mission conducted a survey of the number of refugees who 
were forced to resettle and the vulnerable groups of the country 
and evaluated these people's needs for targeted emergency aid. 
  The mission was informed by the government that the number 
of 
refugees in the republic comes to 250,000 (the majority from 
Armenia) and the number of people from within the country who 
were forced to resettle is 658,000. The latter were saved by 
fleeing from Nagorno Karabakh and regions of conflict in the 
western part of Azerbaijan. Of the 908,000 refugees, 
approximately 60,000 are living in tent camps that have been 
built and are well kept up and are currently controlled by the 
Red Crescent Societies of Iran and Turkey and the International 
Islamic Humanitarian Organization. Some of the rest have moved 
in with families, and others, the majority, are living in public 
buildings and facilities located all over the country. 
  The World Food Program (VPP) will provide the resettlers and 
the most needy refugees with additional food products, above all 
those who are living in public institutions. 
  In order to render aid in material and technical preparation 
for deliveries of humanitarian aid to the region the VPP has 
founded the Caucasian Organizational Consultative Department 
(KOKO). The main spheres of aid that were earmarked include 
increasing the handling capacity of the railroads and ports 
during circulation and transportation of humanitarian cargo. 
  The Office of the High UN Commissioner for Refugees will 
continue to satisfy the needs of most groups of refugees and 
those who have been forced to resettle. The Office of the High 
Commission will supply household goods through deliveries of 
nonfoodstuffs such as blankets, plastic sheets, soap, kitchen 
items, clothing, and footwear.

industry, again in March oil workers managed to maintain 
relative stability in their work and successfully fulfill the 
month's assignment and also that for the entire first quarter of 
the year. 
  According to figures obtained from the State Petroleum 
Company, in March 810,000 tonnes were extracted, and for the 
entire quarter--2,339,000 tonnes of oil. This was 4,000 tonnes 
more than was envisioned by this year's assignment but 217,000 
tonnes less than last year, the decline of product amounting to 
8.3 percent. There was also an 11.2-percent reduction in gas 
extraction as compared to the analogous period of last year.

<F P=106> [Interview with Georgian Academy of Sciences Vice President </F>
Iver Prangishvili by Tamaz Ebanoidze: "It Seems an Academician's 
Lot Is Not Easy...": place and date not given] 
  [Text] That day, they made SAKARTVELOS RESPUBLIKA's 
special correspondent "cool his heels" before meeting with 
Batoni Iver. But don't think I'm complaining: I realize the Vice 
President of the Georgian Academy of Sciences is extremely busy, 
he's only in Tbilisi for a month and there are all kinds of 
people waiting to see him. Anyway, I did not sit idle while 
waiting: the Vice President's assistant made me a copy of the 
main points of the paper which Iver Prangishvili had given that 
day before a meeting of the Presidium of the Georgian Academy of 
Sciences--"A Conception-Program to `Save' the Republic of 
Georgia." I read it eagerly. 
  Iver Prangishvili is the director of the Russian Academy of 
Sciences Institute of Problems of Control, the chief designer of 
AES [nuclear power plant] automation systems for Russia 
(formerly the Soviet Union and, in fact, the CEMA [Council for 
Economic Mutual Aid] countries), a professor and department head 
in Moscow's Physics Engineering Institute, the President of the 
Society of Georgians Living in Russia, the President of the 
Georgian Engineering Academy, the Honorary President of the 
Georgian Reformers Union, and a member of numerous international 
academies and associations. 
  I will try to give SAKARTVELOS RESPUBLIKA's vast readership 
a 
closer acquaintance with Batoni Iver and show the man and 
personality behind the resume. I confess I got this vital 
information from the people closest to him (his wife, his 
assistant and coworkers). 
  Academician Iver Prangishvili is 63 years old, married to 
Tsiala Gugunishvili (an energy engineer); his son Archil is a 
doctor of technical sciences (incidentally, this young man was 
recently handed his doctor's degree--the first ever Georgian 
one--by Head of State Shevardnadze himself); and, so far, one 
grandson, a year old, who bears the same name, bless his heart. 
  "He is kind and good-hearted, always trying to make you feel 
good; he never acts superior. When we are in Moscow, he's at the 
Institute from 9 in the morning until 10 at night, and after he 
comes home he works until nearly three o'clock in the morning. 
Even on weekends he doesn't stop for a minute [as we can see, an 
academician's lot is not easy--T.E.]; he loves to read fiction, 
he's musical--he loves Chopin and Schubert. He's a loving 
grandfather, and everybody loves him" (his wife). 
  "He is kind and good-natured, he has a rare gift for 
sympathy, and he knows art very well. Every time he goes to 
Moscow he leaves me a thank-you card for our work together" (his 
assistant). 
  "He is energetic and industrious and thinks on a vast scale. 
In Moscow, even on the highest echelons, he is able to use his 
fame and authority to help Georgians of various ranks working in 
science, economics, or politics, who come to Moscow. It's 
amazing how many kinds of `Georgian' concerns he can deal with 
during a two-week sojourn in Moscow. He is very humble, and not 
just for show" (close associates). 
  When it comes to humility and simplicity, I would like to 
say 
that several times I had to push him a little--surely forgivable 
in a journalist--to get him to talk about himself. 
  [Ebanoidze] Batono Iver, you gave a paper today to the 
Presidium of the Academy of Sciences, the significance of which 
is clear from the title--"A Conception-Program to `Save' the 
Economy of the Republic of Georgia." I've looked at its main 
points. We keep hearing the word "save" these days, and we have 
all kinds of saviors. How do you envision the country's 
salvation? 
  [Prangishvili] The Conception-Program to "save" the people 
from hunger and cold and stabilize the economy was prepared late 
last summer by an initiative group from the Georgian Academy of 
Sciences, the Georgian Engineering Academy, and the Reformers 
Union. It was submitted in September to the Head of State, who 
made use of several of the main points in a speech to Parliament. 
  The Conception-Program discusses problems that need to be 
solved immediately. These include basic supplies of essential 
resources, in particular food, fuel, and energy for the 
population and the economy. It presents proposals for urgent 
measures in the most basic sectors--industry, agroindustry, fuel 
and energy, and transportation. 
  In order to realize practical implementation of the economic 
reforms called for in the Conception-Program, the following 
conditions are necessary: 
  1. Put a stop to the tense crime situation and mafia 
organizations by instituting a state of emergency (mafiosi, also 
criminal organizations and individuals, do not like reforms and 
discipline); 
  2. Rather than a parliamentary republic, we need a republic 
with a strong head of state or president. 
  3. Institute strong discipline to rally the people and 
restore trust in the government (if the leaders can overcome the 
grave crime situation and correct it in short order, they will 
regain the people's trust); 
  4. Get rid of hyperinflation in the very first stage of 
reforms; we know that reforms are impossible in a time of 
hyperinflation. In general, it is most expedient to carry out 
reforms in sequence--first economic reforms (food!), then 
spiritual (freedom of speech and information), and finally 
political (parliament, a multi-party system, broad democracy). 
  In continuing the transition period, we need to reject the 
"shock therapy" model which calls for a swift transition to the 
market economy. It is too painful and will only work with 
massive foreign investment. For the transition period we need to 
create a mixed, multi-sector model which will ensure a 
relatively mild, gradual, and painless transition to the market 
economy. 
  In announcing a modified transition period, we have to form 
three provisional sectors of the economy. 
  The purpose of the first sector, the one that "saves," is to 
create the minimum amount of goods necessary for the estimated 
5.5-million population's needs (1,500 kilocalories per capita). 
These goods need to be produced and distributed on a ration card 
basis, with strict state control, so that everyone gets his 
share of bread, milk, cheese, and other products providing a 
total of 1,500 kilocalories (below that amount, irreversible 
physiological impairment from hunger sets in). 
  The "save" sector must produce the essential foodstuffs 
providing the necessary calories (5.5 million times 1,500) at 
prices affordable to pensioners, and also meet people's 
transportation, fuel, and other minimal consumer needs. During 
the first stage, this sector must turn out 50 percent of total 
goods output. 
  The second sector should be the regulated market sector. Out 
of 300 to 400 product items, the state regulates the prices of 
19 or 20 of the basic prime necessities, not by directive but by 
economic methods (favorable credits, tax breaks, and so on). 
During the first stage this sector will produce about 25 percent 
of total production output. 
  The third sector will be the free market sector; its role, 
importance, and share will gradually increase along with 
economic reforms. Prices in it are free, regulated by supply and 
demand, without state intervention. In the first period, the 
free market's share of the economy will be set at 20 to 25 
percent. This is the most efficient sector, because it makes 
maximum use of people's personal initiative and interest. 
  Alongside these three basic sectors there is also the 
"shadow" economy, which, in terms of its nature and effect, is 
quite different from shadow economies abroad. In other 
countries, the shadow economy is chiefly mixed up with 
narcotics, pornography, fraud, and tax evasion; in our country, 
the shadow economy chiefly involves the theft and sale of state 
and public property and mass speculation in gasoline, bread, 
flour, and other goods. 
  The transition period covers three to six years; at the end, 
we will convert to the market economy and the state "salvation" 
sector will no longer be necessary. 
  [Ebanoidze] Specific points in your paper deal with the 
vital 
importance of the fuel and energy, agroindustrial, and 
communications complexes. 
  [Prangishvili] Let's start with fuel and energy. The only 
way 
to "salvation" here is to institute a state of emergency in 
power consumption. We have worked out a three-stage 
conception-program of energy development. The first stage runs 
through 1995, the second runs through the year 2000, and the 
third runs through 2005. We have worked out a mathematical model 
and run a computer simulation to find a scientifically 
substantiated optimal variant of energy development. 
  During the first stage (1994-1995), an additional 6 billion 
kwh of electricity must be generated, for which, in particular, 
a tenth and eleventh power unit will have to go on line in the 
Tbilisi GRES [state regional power plant], and existing GESes 
[hydropower plants] will have to be renovated to boost their 
generating capacity and reduce losses. During the second stage 
(1995-2000), we will need an additional 6 billion kwh, for which 
a base-load 600-megawatt TES [thermal power plant] will have to 
be built near Kutaisi and which will run on local Tkibuli coal. 
A number of small and medium-sized GESes will have to be built. 
  For the agroindustrial complex, the Conception-Program 
provides a balance of minimally essential supply and demand of 
basic food items for the current year. The grain requirement 
this year in terms of physiological norms equals 2 million 
tonnes. Of this amount, the republic can produce 0.6 million 
tonnes; hence, we will have to buy 1.4 million tonnes abroad. We 
have calculated the necessary amounts of meat and meat products, 
milk and dairy products, sugar, potatoes, and vegetable oil and 
the amounts of money involved. 
  In order to alleviate the meat problem, the program 
recommends enlisting U.S. aid to build 40 modern hog farms in 
Georgia with the capacity to produce 100 million tonnes of meat 
annually. Plans call for keeping half the meat, the bones, and 
all of the hides in the republic; the United States will take 
the other half of the meat and sell it in third countries to pay 
the costs. The program proposes that orchard and garden products 
be used to meet the needs of Tbilisi and Rustavi. 
  Let's see what innovations there are in the communications 
complex. Let me say generally that Georgia's communications 
network will be changed totally; Georgia is going to have a 
modern communications system. 
  One innovation will be a 2000-number cellular radio 
communications network. The project will be done by a U.S. firm; 
it will be implemented in May of this year, using World Bank 
credits. 
  With the help of the Siemens Company, a new 200,000-number 
digital telephone exchange will be built in Tbilisi to replace 
the old 100,000-number exchange, half of which no longer work 
anyway. 
  Also to be built in Tbilisi is a joint Georgian-Turkish 
optical cable plant. Some of the product will remain in Georgia, 
while the rest will be sold abroad. 
  A new local and long-distance digital telephone exchange 
will 
be built in Kutaisi and Batumi, accommodating 30,000 numbers. 
  Austria's Teletra Company is going to build two stations for 
modern satellite communications. There are other innovations as 
well. 
  [Ebanoidze] The "salvation" program calls for using the 
results of scientific-technical research done in Georgia and the 
adoption of new, modern technologies. 
  [Prangishvili] Clearly, rapid adoption of 
scientific-technical advances will play a big role in saving the 
republic's economy. Therefore, the new technologies, methods, 
and advances developed by our scientists are broadly recommended 
for a variety of economic sectors. The list of items I will tell 
you about now is really impressive: 
  The adoption of new, energy-saving technologies; the 
production and use of new medical treatments; the use of 
non-toxic biostimulants to boost grain yields; the establishment 
of bamboo plantations and the adoption of a new technology to 
make our own paper from it; the production of new medicines, 
vitamins, and extracts using local raw materials; the 
preparation of a liquid suspension (mixture) of coal for 
efficient use; and others. 
  Let us focus in more detail on a few items. 
  In the sphere of energy-saving technologies, the 
pulse-delivery principle in electrical and gas installations 
(instead of constant delivery) yields a 30-percent savings. We 
can use it in kitchen ranges, electric and gas stoves, and 
boiler facilities to excellent economic and ecological effect. 
This new principle is already being adopted in the republic's 
enterprises. We have also received orders from other countries. 
  The non-toxic biostimulants which our researchers have 
developed make it possible to double yields of corn, wheat, soy, 
beans, sugar beets, onions, coriander, and other vegetables 
using practically no fertilizer, thus producing ecologically 
clean, toxic-free products. Large-scale (100-hectare) 
experiments in Lanchkhuti Rayon have been very encouraging and 
ought to be extended to other territories. 
  A third example--producing a coal suspension to use for 
fuel--reduces coal consumption by several dozen percent and 
enhances the ecology (pulverized coal mixed with water is used 
as fuel). [end of Prangishvili's answer] 
  The Institute of Problems of Control in the Russian Academy 
of Sciences is a world class research center. Iver Prangishvili 
has been connected with it for many years: he was the head of a 
laboratory from 1964, deputy director for science from 1970, and 
he was elected director in 1986. Let's look at that word 
"elected": if a 2,000-man collective in Moscow prefers a 
Georgian over two Russians to serve as their leader, you have to 
think that this man must greatly surpass them in terms of 
personality and business qualities. Iver Prangishvili is now in 
his ninth year as Institute director; among his numerous duties 
is that of carrying out vital missions for that vast country: 
for example, working out a conception for managing the overall 
development and improvement of Russia's economy, dealing with 
problems of reform and administration in Russia, and drawing up 
appropriate recommendations. 
  Since it was established, the Institute has turned out over 
100 qualified Georgian specialists, including two other 
academicians--Vakhtang Chichinadze and Mindia Salukvadze. Iver 
Prangishvili has supervised the training of over 50 candidates 
and doctors. Of the Georgians working with him now, doctors of 
science Avtandil Anuashvili, Vladimer Zhorzhikashvili, and 
Aleksandre Shubladze are heads of laboratories; five are senior 
science associates, one is a doctoral candidate, and several are 
graduate students. 
  [Ebanoidze] Batono Iver, as you know, we Georgians often 
lose 
our sense of moderation--with all our numerous political 
parties, universities, commercial schools, newspapers, generals, 
banks, and travel agencies in one little country.... Now 
consider all the academies: the Academy of Sciences, the Academy 
of Agricultural Sciences, the Academy of Engineering (not to 
mention colleges such as the Academy of Painting), the Military 
Academy.... I've heard, as well, that a Medical Academy and an 
Academy of the Humanities are looming on the horizon.... And 
later, maybe, an Academy of Literature and Academy of Art.... 
Right now, though, will you tell us about the Academy of 
Engineering, which you are the President of. Does it justify its 
existence? 
  [Prangishvili] I envisioned the Academy of Engineering as a 
bridge between fundamental science and production. To put it 
figuratively, fundamental science ends with formulas, new 
principles and methods, which then need to be calculated, 
developed, designed, and put into production. The Academy of 
Engineering includes several engineering centers which foster 
the revival of production and the development and adoption of 
new technologies. From this standpoint, the Academy of 
Engineering is already playing a positive role. 
  [Ebanoidze] Now, as the President of the Society of 
Georgians 
Living in Russia, would you please tell us what it does. 
  [Prangishvili] The Society has 95,000 members. Its purpose 
is 
to help Georgia and the Georgian people. We try to make Russia 
better acquainted with Georgian culture, Georgian traditions, 
our various accomplishments. The Society and its members put on 
benefit concerts and other cultural and educational events. The 
Society's financial base comes from members' contributions. We 
have helped around 10,000 Georgian refugees in Russia with 
lodging, jobs, travel back and forth, costing 50 million rubles. 
We have spent millions of rubles to make and distribute Georgian 
musical records. Our funds were also used to publish two or 
three editions of the newspaper DEMOKRATICHESKAYA ABKHAZIYA in 
Moscow, to provide the Russian people with correct information 
about what was going on in Abkhazia. We have organized and 
financed several television broadcasts about events in Georgia. 
I should tell you that our budget is over 100 million rubles. 
  [Ebanoidze] Batono Iver, could you tell us a little about 
your own personal scientific interests, perhaps singling out 
some of your more significant recent works? 
  [Prangishvili] Generally, I'm working on problems of control 
[words illegible]. They include scientifically substantiated 
control of enterprises, organizations, and sectors, the control 
and optimization of technological processes of complex systems 
and facilities. 
  Recently, my colleague Doctor of Sciences Avtandil 
Anuashvili 
and I discovered a new principle of visibility, and on its basis 
we developed the world's first computer system to visualize 
"invisible" phenomena and objects. Our discovery makes it 
possible to see objects and phenomena which radio and optical 
locators can't pick up and the human eye can't usually see (for 
example, the ultraspectrum and the infraspectrum). We have 
developed a system and device--sensory transformers which, if 
the human eye is equipped with such electronic-optical sensors, 
it can see objects and phenomena that are invisible today and, 
if it exists, "parallel life" as well. There are some other 
really nice and interesting things, but we can talk about them 
another time. [end of Prangishvili answer] 
  My last meeting with the Vice President was on 21 January. 
The next day he headed for Moscow, and from there, on 24 
January, to Tashkent. On 25-26 January, the capital of 
Uzbekistan was hosting a conference of members of the 
International Congress of Industrialists and Businessmen, 
participated in by a Georgian delegation headed by Iver 
Prangishvili. The conference discussed measures to quickly 
restore economic ties among enterprises of the former republics 
of the USSR and establish new, mutually beneficial relations. 
  Just before Batoni Iver was to fly to Moscow again, I wished 
him continued fruitful activities "outside of Georgia"--fruitful 
for Georgia and in general.

<F P=106> [Republic of Georgia Prime Minister Otar Patsatsia's report </F>
at an expanded meeting of the Republic of Georgia Cabinet of 
Ministers on 9 February 1994: "The Country's Future Depends on 
the Implementation of Reforms and Revival of the Economy"] 
  [Text] At today's meeting the specific issue to be 
discussed is the draft indicator plan for 1994-1995 and the 
revised edition of the anti-crisis program of macroeconomic 
stabilization and systematic changes. In my report I will 
discuss the most important economic results of last year and the 
most pressing problems requiring immediate solutions. 
  Last year, important measures were carried out in the 
republic with regard to reforms and normalizing life, reflected 
primarily in the preparation of the necessary legal-normative 
base. The republic's leadership has substantially overcome the 
country's lengthy state of isolation, and good prospects are in 
store for foreign economic cooperation with the industrially 
developed countries and various international organizations. 
Joining the CIS and concluding the broad treaty with Russia have 
created an environment favorable to the republic's economic 
development, and so forth. 
  Nevertheless, owing to familiar political and 
social-economic 
internal and external factors we have not yet succeeded in 
activating mechanisms to stabilize the economy, or in overcoming 
the energy crisis. The result is that a substantial portion of 
our economic potential is cut off from economic circulation, and 
the crisis has become systematic and structural. This is 
reflected in the fact that the macroeconomic indicators of 1993 
are only about half those of 1992. In particular, the republic's 
domestic product last year dropped by 46 percent, and national 
income dropped by 54 percent, falling to the 1964-1965 level. 
Social labor productivity has declined to the level of almost 30 
years ago. Further development of the economy is gravely 
threatened by the fact that investment in the republic's 
production sphere has virtually halted. Only 10 percent of the 
total domestic product was spent on accumulation in 1993. The 
level of fixed assets put to work by centralized capital 
investment stands at only 6.6 percent of the comparable 1992 
figure. The return on capital in the republic's economy declined 
by 45 percent, while the ratio of material costs grew by 30 
percent. 
  The unemployment problem has gradually overwhelmed 
us, and under conditions of inflation and limited consumer 
resources living standards for most of the population are 
extremely low, and in some strata the problem of hunger is a 
reality. 
  A variety of substantial problems have accumulated in the 
development of sectors of the material sphere. As a result of 
economic and non-economic, domestic and outside destabilizing 
factors, a substantial portion of the republic's economic 
potential came to be cut off from economic circulation in 1993 
and stood idle for months; naturally, this induced a further 
decline in the volume of production in every sector and complex 
of material production. 
  The situation that has taken shape in the agrarian 
sector is especially grave. The livestock and poultry 
population and productivity have declined, and indicators of 
supplies of crop and livestock products to meet the needs of the 
state and production have dropped. I will cite some figures: in 
1993, 6.8 times less grain, seven times less potatoes, almost 
three times less vegetables, and 13.8 times less fruit were 
delivered to the state than the previous year. The three-year 
program to bring the agroindustrial complex out of its crisis, 
which was approved by a special decree of the Cabinet of 
Ministers, called for the procurement of 300,000 tonnes of 
top-quality tea leaf, 365,000 tonnes of grapes, 360,000 tonnes 
of fruit, 10,000 tonnes of tobacco, and 180,000 tonnes of citrus 
in 1993. All that the state got, however, was 132,000 tonnes of 
tea leaf (44 percent of the target), 71,000 tonnes of grapes (20 
percent), 10,000 tonnes of fruit (2.7 percent), 36,000 tonnes of 
citrus (20 percent), and 600 tonnes of tobacco (6 percent). A 
substantial portion of these products were sold in circumvention 
of the state, through private agencies. Indicators of the 
procurement of other agricultural products also declined. A 
number of rayons simply do not acknowledge the necessity of 
delivering agricultural products to meet state needs. Last year, 
for example, practically all of the livestock products produced 
in the agricultural enterprises of Akhalkalaki, Ninotsminda, 
Dedoplistskaro, Signakhi, and Tsalka rayons were marketed in 
circumvention of the state. 
  The very grave critical situation in the agrarian sector is 
due to many factors. Most notable is the unstable 
social-political situation which has left its mark on all 
results of economic activity and prompted tendencies of 
squandering and looting state property and basically improper 
implementation of the first stage of agrarian reform and 
processes of destatization and privatization of state property, 
and so on. 
  The main thing, however, is that the measures taken by the 
Agriculture and Food Ministry have not been sufficient to 
stabilize the sector. Moreover, the Ministry proved unprepared 
to cope with the difficulties and problems generated by land 
privatization, the disarray in the centralized supply system of 
material and technical resources, and the reorganization of 
agricultural enterprises. In the state agricultural enterprises 
that do remain in the countryside there is practically no 
economic mechanism at work, irrigation and drainage systems have 
been looted and wrecked, the technical base is in a shambles 
(most of the vehicles and tractors have been stolen or ruined), 
and no concrete obligation or responsibility for delivering 
products to the state exists, as the greater portion of loans 
taken out by most of the enterprises have regularly been written 
off to the account of domestic state debts or else deferred for 
three to five years. 
  The Ministry has also been passive with regard to forming 
market structures in the countryside, organizing enterprises 
based on different forms of ownership (private, cooperative, 
joint-stock, leasing, and so on), providing the necessary 
material-technical resources to develop agroservices, and 
adopting a state reciprocal contract system with producers of 
goods. 
  The tendency of production volume to go down also 
continued in the republic's industry. Preliminary figures 
indicate that the decline, compared with the previous year, 
stood at 25 to 26 percent and equalled the 1963 level. In this 
period, there was a substantial decline in amounts of fuel and 
products of industry, metallurgy, machine building, and light, 
food, and timber and woodworking industries. 
  The republic's economy has been negatively impacted by 
lagging energy industry development and energy supplies. In 
1993, the republic generated 9.8 billion kwh of electricity, 
which was 84 percent of the previous year's figure and 91 
percent of the total amount consumed. A portion of the demand 
was met by importing electricity from neighboring power systems. 
The oil production target was met by only 68 percent, and 
prospecting targets were met by only 69 percent. Instead of 
500,000 tonnes of coal last year, only 82,000 tonnes were mined; 
of that figure, only 21,000 tonnes were marketable grade. 
  Keep in mind that energy is the sector which determines the 
operation of the whole economy, in particular the material 
sphere. Hence, that sector needs to be boosted as the basis for 
invigorating the economy. A governmental commission has been 
created to draw up an energy program and put it into operation 
in the shortest possible time. For our part, we must immediately 
make preparations to achieve a fundamental breakthrough this 
year in providing the economy with energy resources. This year 
we need to generate at least 13 to 14 billion kwh. To this end, 
we have to make more effective use of hydroresources. We need to 
rebuild and technically renovate hydrostructures. 
  In the coming years, and this year, we need to substantially 
boost coal production and perfect primary coal processing 
technologies. We need to carry out measures to stabilize oil 
production with the aim of producing 180,000 to 200,000 tonnes 
of oil per year. We need to expand the search for oil and gas. 
  Another thing: we need to start preparing today for the 
coming season, to ensure energy supplies. We will have to lay in 
stocks of at least 300,000 tonnes of fuel oil before autumn and 
put the energy infrastructure in order. This must be the prime 
concern of every ministry, department, association, and 
enterprise. 
  The republic's economic development is gravely burdened by 
the unsatisfactory performance of the basic sectors of industry 
enterprises of the light and food industries. Last year, in 
particular, the production of food industry products declined by 
almost 40 percent, and production output in light industry 
declined by 2.5 times. The 1993 production figures were: 20,000 
tonnes of packaged tea (27 percent of the target), 5.6 million 
decaliters of wine (36 percent), 6 million bottles of champagne 
(40 percent), 30 million bottles of mineral water (25 percent), 
and only 50 million standard cans of fruit and vegetables (17 
percent). And, as you know, these are goods that are not only 
essential to meet the needs of our population but also principal 
items of export and, consequently, essential in order to bring 
in imports. Hence, special attention needs to be focused on 
these sectors in the future. 
  You have to agree that our transportation systems are a 
complete shambles, and, unfortunately, this is equally true of 
all forms of transportation. The situation on the railroads 
is especially grave. As railroad officials have said so many 
times, it is going to take tens of billions of Russian rubles to 
restore the normal operations of the republic's railroads. In 
such circumstances it would be well for us to think about 
creating a fund to rebuild and develop Georgia's railroads with 
the help of European, Asian, and other interested countries. 
  Construction has almost halted in the republic owing to 
lack of resources. Amounts of capital investment last year 
were only 1.5 percent of the 1993 figure [as printed]; and the 
funds that were spent were not all that wisely used. Funds, 
which were skimpy anyway, have been wasted and are not being 
used to complete scheduled projects and make them operational. 
One direct result of that is that not one important industrial 
project was delivered ready for operation last year--yet many 
were supposed to have gone operational two or three years 
before. Capacity start-up indicators in sectors of the social 
sphere are extremely skimpy (105,000 square meters of 
residential living space, schools for 2,730 pupils, and 
hospitals with 138 beds). 
  Unfortunately, these gaps are partly due to subjective 
factors which need to be dealt with immediately. In particular, 
it is essential to deal with the capital construction plan and 
necessary financing by the beginning of this year [as printed], 
draw up a number of normative and legislative acts, strengthen 
reporting and accounting procedures, and so on. 
  The economic crisis has been especially hard on 
people's standard of living. Along with objective causes, 
the grave situation in this sphere is also due to the inflexible 
efforts of sectors in the social sphere. This is true 
specifically of the trade system. In particular, the state trade 
system and the consumer cooperatives have failed to provide the 
population with even minimum guaranteed supplies of prime 
necessities and essential goods, and their efforts are confined 
to the organization of a couple of normed items of food and 
bread. Hence, the population is basically left to the mercy of 
the private sector and the kolkhoz market. In these 
circumstances, the private sector totally dictates prices on the 
consumer market. 
  In order to at least partly alleviate the situation, it is 
necessary to provide for the marketing of food and other prime 
essentials by the quota/norm method. 
  The health care system is in a state of emergency. 
The republic's population is virtually without emergency medical 
aid, which is just about criminal and needs to be corrected 
immediately. This needs more attention on the part of the 
Saknavtobproduktebi [Georgian Oil Products] Company's 
leadership, and emergency medical services should be the first 
to be provided with necessary amounts of fuel. 
  There are many other painful problems in this sphere. The 
population does not have the means to buy medicine at commercial 
prices. The cost of patient services has gone sky-high. To some 
extent this is why the number of patients in medical 
establishments has gone done recently and death rates have risen 
accordingly. The Health Ministry must study this problem 
immediately and report to us as soon as possible about the facts 
and the measures taken. 
  The question of the network of tuition-charging schools 
also needs to be looked at; the system is virtually out of 
balance with the need for specialists, the necessary 
material-technical base, and the number of professors and 
teachers required. Today this problem involves only material 
costs; in the near future it could bring about significant 
social difficulties. 
  In short, what is virtually an emergency economic 
situation has taken shape in the republic, and it will require 
immediate implementation of the appropriate measures. What this 
requires, in particular, is some well coordinated and, most 
important, effective and systematic steps taking account in 
advance of their social-economic consequences, overcoming 
elements of mounting chaos, and improving the quality of the 
regulation and directed management of the economy. Our 
experience--and the experience of others besides--shows that a 
purely monetary policy, despite its great importance, is not 
sufficient to achieve stability and solve the crisis under 
conditions in which market structures and relations on the 
micro-level are extremely underdeveloped. Hence, the Cabinet of 
Ministers believes the prime task is to connect financial 
stabilization measures organically to the revival of production, 
to measures of restoration, measures to achieve comprehensive 
improvement of the structural and management system and develop 
market structures. 
  Foremost among urgent measures under today's 
conditions, nevertheless, are problems of stabilizing and 
imposing order on the monetary credit and financial sphere; 
unless these are dealt with in a systematic way, it will be 
impossible to create the necessary conditions for reviving the 
economy. 
  The focus of comprehensive measures to get out of the 
republic's financial crisis must be on solving the money 
question. In order to comprehensively work out and implement the 
most acceptable form of the several possible solutions to this 
problem at this stage, it is advisable to create a governmental 
commission made up of officials of the National Bank, ministries 
and departments of finance and economics, scientists, and, if 
possible, foreign experts. It is also advisable to create a 
special, nongovernmental commission to work on the same problems. 
  The commissions will have to work out comprehensively 
substantiated and specified projects on money questions; we will 
have to map out the path to take: how long the coupon should 
remain in circulation, and how we can strengthen it during that 
period, when it will be advisable and possible to introduce our 
own currency and what prerequisites are needed for it, how we 
can create these essential conditions, whether direct entry into 
"ruble space" is inevitable (using the ruble), whether it is 
possible to join the currency union, and so on. We need to keep 
in mind, moreover, that money does not mean cash alone. Most of 
our enterprises today are isolated because we do not have 
account settlement abroad. This situation will be fatal if it 
continues. Hence, the commissions must urgently deal with this 
question. But even that does not exhaust the problem. We need 
simultaneously to work on balancing the republic's balance of 
payments and questions of foreign debt. Preliminary calculations 
are needed, otherwise any long-term stabilization of our 
currency is out of the question. At this stage we cannot afford 
to repeat the mistakes we made earlier, even though they were 
inevitable at the time. 
  From this standpoint, we cannot afford to slacken our 
efforts 
with the International Monetary Fund, the World Bank, the 
Euro-Association, and other international bodies. Our efforts 
along these lines must be corrected immediately. 
  The grave monetary-credit and financial situation in our 
republic, which is already bad enough, is made even worse by the 
existence of large amounts of overdue debts in a number of 
economic links. In the Sakgazi [Georgian Gas] Department system, 
for example, the total accounts receivable has reached the 
astronomical figure of 1.4 trillion coupons; in the Sakenergo 
[Georgian Energy] system it is 400 billion coupons, and in 
Navtobproduktebi it is 162 billion coupons. The Rustavi 
Metallurgy Plant owes Sakgazi 145 billion, Tbilisi GRES [State 
Regional Power Plant] owes it 580 billion, the Tbilisi Central 
Power Plant owes it 21 billion coupons, and so on. 
Navtobproduktebi's delinquent customers also include the Port of 
Poti (almost seven billion), the Railroad Department and its 
offices (19 billion), the Defense Ministry (six billion 
coupons), and so on. 
  The question of people's overdue bills for gas and 
electricity requires special discussion. Sakgazi's accounts 
receivable add up to 379 billion coupons, while Sakenergo's add 
up to 200 billion coupons. The total amount of the population's 
overdue bills is growing constantly. Under such conditions we 
probably ought to think about whether it might be best for the 
state to take over these bills. 
  Though somewhat late, officials of the National Bank have 
submitted proposals on mutual offsetting of accounts receivable, 
which we will discuss and approve at a meeting soon. The 
National Bank will have to exercise strict control over the 
implementation of decisions. 
  At this point I want to discuss an organizational aspect of 
the problem. In the current economic emergency, it is 
advisable, for purposes of implementing a unified state economic 
policy, to discuss whether to make the National Bank subordinate 
both to the Parliament and to the Cabinet of Ministers. 
Resolving this question will make cooperation more directed and 
efficient and will improve coordination of the activities of the 
economically-oriented ministries and the banking system. 
  Under conditions of the general economic and financial 
crisis, prices continued to rise intensively last year. 
According to preliminary expert estimates, consumer prices from 
January to December 1993 (including the kolkhoz markets and 
commercial outlets) rose by almost 90 times--that is, the 
average monthly rate of inflation was 45 percent; this is 
substantially higher than the previous year's figures. 
  In most cases today, retail prices are equal to and 
sometimes 
higher than average prices in Russia (on meat, sugar, vegetable 
oil, cigarettes, fish, and other items). This fact, in view of 
the fact that average wages in the republic lag far behind those 
in Russia, poses the danger that our already-skimpy domestic 
market will go empty. This makes it even more mandatory to bring 
wages, pensions, and so on into line. It is essential, however, 
first to resolve the question of currency stabilization, because 
it simply makes no sense to raise wages in today's coupons. 
  The Economics Ministry has pledged to submit to the Cabinet 
of Ministers in the next few days its own proposals on urgent 
measures to strengthen the manageability of price-formation 
processes and anti-inflation policies. These proposals must 
necessarily call for effective measures to strengthen and 
improve the price offices in the ministries and departments, 
enterprises, associations, and commercial outfits. Owing to a 
one-sided and false interpretation of the market economy, 
unfortunately, these central links of the economic service, in 
some ministries and departments, have not become stronger but 
actually weaker; in some cases this is reflected by their 
complete abolition. This is why, in some economic links, there 
have been cases of distortion and improper setting of prime 
costs, profits, excise and value-added taxes, and other elements 
of prices. 
  In our opinion, officials of the Economics Ministry have 
properly addressed the necessity of strengthening the 
price-formation service within the Ministry itself. Perhaps we 
also ought to think about the possibility of creating a 
scientific-research and information center in this sphere. What 
is needed above all, however, is to make more effective use of 
the actual resources we already have. We need to put the price 
control mechanism fully into action, to be implemented by the 
price inspectorate service. We must put up insurmountable 
barriers to arbitrary price-setting that is devoid of any 
objective grounds in circumvention of the Economics Ministry on 
the cost of goods and services that are vitally essential to the 
public. 
  Under today's conditions, it is especially important to 
solve problems of supplying the republic with resources, 
providing the resources necessary to meet the state's needs, and 
to unconditionally enforce government decisions on export and 
import quotas and licensing. 
  Last year these targets were not met by the Ministry of 
Industry, the Agriculture and Food Industry Ministry, and the 
Defense Ministry (with regard to the production of agricultural 
and food industry goods), and this prevented fulfillment of 
trade and economic agreements on the governmental level. 
  According to 11-month figures from the Ministry of Trade and 
Material Supply, the following deliveries were made to countries 
with which we had inter-governmental agreements in 1993 
(Ukraine, Kazakhstan, Azerbaijan, Armenia, Kyrghyzstan, 
Turkmenia, and Moldova): only 13.3 percent of agreed-upon 
deliveries of rolled ferrous metal, 57.5 percent of the steel 
pipe, 5.8 percent of the coal, 8.2 percent of nonferrous alloys, 
15.1 percent of the lithopone, 20.6 percent of the lathes, 54.3 
percent of the tower cranes, 7 percent of the trucks, 17.7 
percent of the welding units, 10 percent of the mineral water, 6 
percent of the wine, 1.8 percent of wine products, 34.7 percent 
of the tea, and so on. In general, no deliveries were made of 
farm product processing equipment, trailers, tractors, gas 
ranges, galvanic batteries, cotton fabrics, champagne, cognac 
alcohol, and others. Contracts in 1993 called for deliveries of 
604.77 million dollars' worth of goods; in actuality, deliveries 
totalled only 100.26 million dollars' worth--16.6 percent. 
  Separate mention must be made of our failure to meet state 
obligations for the delivery of goods to Turkmenia in 1993, 
which is of crucial importance to the republic's supply of gas. 
Instead of goods worth 138.82 million dollars, only 46.65 
million dollars' worth of goods were delivered to 
Turkmenia--33.6 percent of the commitment. Delivery commitments 
to the various countries through 11 months of last year were 
fulfilled as follows: 21.2 percent with Azerbaijan, 1.5 percent 
with Moldova, 1.9 percent with Armenia, 3.5 percent with 
Ukraine, 19.7 percent with Kazakhstan, and 8.5 percent with 
Kyrghyzstan. Accordingly, resource imports into the republic 
have been very small; we have large debts; state reserves have 
not been replenished; and we are getting the reputation of an 
unreliable partner. 
  We will probably be forced to forbid enterprises and 
organizations, regardless of their form of ownership, to ship 
products outside the republic until they fulfill product 
delivery quotas to meet the needs of the state. On our 
instructions, the Economics Ministry has drawn up and submitted 
proposals on new delivery quotas for the most important types of 
industrial and agricultural goods to meet the state's needs; we 
will examine and approve them in a few days. Our position in 
this matter will be most firm and resolute. We will see to it 
that all enterprises, whether state-owned or private, which have 
commitments to deliver goods to meet the needs of the state, 
will unconditionally fulfill them in full. 
  We will carry out similar measures with respect to the 
regions. The prime task and matter of honor for every economic 
link and territorial unit must be to unconditionally meet target 
quotas. Every official--whether village- or republic-level--must 
have a sense of personal responsibility, otherwise any economic 
success is out of the question. 
  The country's level of foreign economic activity has 
declined badly in recent years. Our trade balance deficit 
with foreign countries stands at 10 percent of the republic's 
total domestic product; this is the highest figure in the past 
five years. 
  The disintegration of the former USSR's economic space and 
the breakdown in the mechanisms of clearing relations among the 
former republics, have greatly weakened our country's 
foreign-economic positions. Rising prices on imported goods have 
greatly outstripped the growth of prices on exported goods; 
naturally, this has made our country's negative balance of 
payments even worse than it was. 
  Georgia's joining the CIS and concluding trade and economic 
agreements with the Russian Federation have somewhat brightened 
the prospects of overcoming the crisis in the sphere of foreign 
economic relations. We are hoping to restore our traditional 
economic ties. Our main task, however, remains that of raising 
the integrated character of our country's economy and making 
maximum effective use of our potential for self-sufficiency. 
  One of our urgent tasks, as I see it, is to create a 
mechanism to protect our national economic space against 
undesirable outside factors; the mechanism must encompass an 
improved customs system, efforts to combat the removal of 
capital, the prevention of damage inflicted by economic 
expansionism, and so on. 
  Reform efforts, however afflicted with obstacles and 
shortcomings, are being carried out despite the republic's grave 
economic and crime situation. Our legal base was enlarged 
and perfected in 1993; a number of fundamentally important laws 
and legislative acts were passed. The first steps toward 
privatization were taken starting in March 1993. By the end of 
the year, 762 outfits had been privatized; over 42 percent of 
the state's housing stock was transferred to citizens' private 
ownership free of charge. Still, sad to say, these transactions 
were accompanied by the looting of state property and "hidden 
privatization," fostered in part by the fact that government 
structures have not been able to control the reins of the 
management, protection, and use of state property. Not only 
that, even the most rudimentary record-keeping is not yet in 
place in the state sector. Many state enterprises, including 
those which produce vital strategic goods for the republic, have 
been totally plundered. We have detected cases of the sale of 
facilities at artificially reduced prices. We need a better 
system for selecting objects to be privatized, assessing their 
fixed assets, forming commissions, and carrying out other 
methodological and organizational measures. All of the above, 
however, fosters the theft and squandering of state property and 
gross violations of principles of social justice in the 
privatization process. The Property Management Ministry needs to 
deal with these matters in a more principled manner. 
  As soon as possible we need to compile a list of the 
enterprises and organizations which must, at the present stage 
of reforms, remain state property; we need to work out 
appropriate and precise procedures for their protection, 
management, and operation. 
  Owing to objective and subjective factors, agrarian reform 
has not been systematic and consistent. It has been drifting at 
random; property is being wasted and stolen. The reorganization 
of agricultural enterprises is basically just a formality. To 
this day, the republic still has over 1,200 kolkhozes and 
sovkhozes--yet their conversion to organizational forms 
characteristic of market structures was supposed to be completed 
back in 1992. This has generated much misunderstanding and 
depersonalization of the land, so that lands remain 
uncultivated. Some of the farms are loss-making, and their 
existence in traditional forms cannot guarantee profitable 
operation. It is essential, then, to immediately, 
before the end of spring farm work, to examine and decide the 
question of the organizational form of those enterprises. The 
country's agrarian sector needs to have new kinds of farm 
management such as individual farms, agricultural partnerships, 
cooperatives, and so on. 
  There are numerous shortcomings in this first stage of land 
reform, due chiefly to the fact that the necessary juridical 
base does not exist, lands are being usurped and occupied, norms 
of land area to be conveyed are being violated, household 
categories are being confused, boundary disputes are breaking 
out between villages, and other negative phenomena are taking 
place. Large areas of tea plantations, vineyards, and orchards 
have been misappropriated. In Ozurgeti Rayon, for example, 55 
percent of the total area of tea plantations has been privatized 
in this way. 
  In Telavi Rayon, all the area allotted to unique varieties 
of 
grapes on the experimental nursery farm in Shalauri was parceled 
out to the population, who uprooted and chopped down 
phyloxera-resistant parent and root stocks. 
  People appropriated land areas of the Galavani Experimental 
Farm in Mtskheta Rayon, and experimental work stopped as a 
result. An eight-year-old industrial walnut orchard was chopped 
down. 
  Lands of the Skra Orchard Experimental Station in Gori Rayon 
were parceled out without authorization. People commandeered 
experimental plots and selective breeding orchards of many 
years' standing, and chopped down and uprooted high-yield 
plantings. 
  On the Dzalisi Seed Breeding Farm in Mtskheta Rayon, land 
areas allotted for the production of elite seeds were illegally 
given away. A similar situation prevails in Gardabani Rayon's 
Martkopa Experimental Station. 
  Considering the situation today, it is essential to 
carry out structural reform of the agrarian sector, which 
will bring about a change in the quantitative proportions of the 
layout of agricultural crops and sectors. In particular, we need 
to speed up the development of sectors which are of vital 
importance to the job of supplying the population with food. It 
is necessary to transform the food complex in accordance with 
the structural reform of the agrarian sector, in order gradually 
to liberate the country from food imports. 
  Because of the vital importance of anti-monopoly policies in 
state regulation of the economy, work continued last year on 
creating the necessary legislative base. A number of Cabinet of 
Ministers decrees were prepared and passed. Now it is essential 
to take effective, practical steps along these lines, otherwise 
it will be impossible to adopt free market mechanisms. 
  As we can see, today's historic stage of Georgia's 
statehood reconstruction is going on under very difficult and 
complex conditions. Our country's future will depend wholly on 
how soon and how thoroughly we can revive the economy and 
transform its structures and orientation in accordance with 
today's requirements. 
  During today's meeting we will hear the Economics Ministry's 
reports about overcoming the country's crisis, the stabilization 
program, and the indicator plan of the republic's 
social-economic development for 1994-1995. These will map out 
the most important strategic directions of the country's 
social-economic development, the parameters of development of 
particular sectors of the economy, and the specific system of 
economic policy measures necessary to accomplish this. 
  Our task is to undertake practical measures to implement our 
programs, plans, and decisions. This year must be decisive with 
respect to putting the country's economy on the path toward 
market principles. But this process must be carried out in a 
directed and integrated manner in accordance with our country's 
economic and political situation. In the future we must not 
allow the kind of situation in which we adopt forms of classical 
market relations in one sphere of economic life yet allow 
complete stagnation in other spheres. I repeat: the country's 
economic transition to market relations must be conceived of in 
entirety, as a package, and we must direct it within the 
framework of market relations without impairing those relations. 
  The effort to activate the system of state regulation 
of the economy necessarily requires precise coordination and 
subordination of the work of all the republic's ministries and 
departments--in particular, ministries and departments of 
economic profile, as well as focus on the key links in matters 
of economic policy and reforms. In this regard, we need to 
think about the necessity of enhancing the role of the Economics 
Ministry in the overall system of state administrative bodies, 
for that ministry must serve as the state's coordinating body in 
matters of economic policy. It must be constantly on top of the 
situation in every sphere of economic reform and economic life. 
It must provide top echelons of state administration with 
constant, well-substantiated proposals concerning ways to ensure 
that particular sectors of the economy are working at full 
capacity, measures to ensure the profitability of sectors and 
enterprises, the establishment of new economic and production 
ties, ways to change the profile of enterprises under the new 
conditions, measures to shut down, abolish, merge, or reorganize 
existing unprofitable enterprises, and so on. The Economics 
Ministry will have to provide us with well-argued proposals on 
how to strengthen the economic services in individual sectors 
and spheres of the national economy, individual enterprises and 
associations, state and non-state structures, autonomous 
republics, cities and rayons, and see to it that these are 
monitored and implemented in practice. 
  Unfortunately, the Economics Ministry today cannot give 
exhaustive answers to these and numerous other urgent questions. 
  It seems to us that the role and functions of the Economics 
Ministry, as the main administrative body for state regulation 
of the economy, ought to grow and be filled with new content in 
the process of forming market relations. We must think about 
formulating and enacting the necessary mechanisms for 
implementing this role and these functions. 
  Comprehensive realization of the principles of the 
market economy requires the efficient functioning of 
republic-level and local statistical and record-keeping 
services. Let me say frankly that unless this is done, I believe 
it is impossible to successfully build an independent state. We 
have not yet managed to obtain statistical information from 
state enterprises, let alone the private sector. According 
to official Sotsekonominpormi [Social Economic Information 
Committee] reports, only 45 percent of all industrial 
enterprises supplied the Committee with information reflecting 
the results of production activity in 1993; 732 enterprises 
failed to submit reports of the year's results. 
  It is no exaggeration to say that in the private sector, 
there is no such thing as statistical reporting. The state does 
not know who is producing what and how much, who is shipping 
what, to where, and how much, who is importing what and how 
much. Complete anarchy and chaos reign in this regard. This 
cannot go on any longer. Sotsekonominpormi officials, and the 
Committee as a whole, must be more efficient and flexible to 
detect and completely cover statistical records on all our 
economic activities. 
  The Cabinet of Ministers is now again raising the 
question of the necessity of making Sotsekonominpormi be 
subordinate to it. Unless the quality and timeliness of the 
information are improved, I don't think it is possible to make 
correct economic decisions, much less implement them in a timely 
manner. 
  We are aware that today's meeting is being participated in 
by 
officials of the councils of ministers of the autonomous 
republics and local administrative bodies of cities and rayons, 
and so we deem it essential to raise another important question. 
It has to do with regional problems. Our task is to 
achieve political stability and economic development in the 
regions in order to provide public order and economic 
development on a republic-wide scale. 
  In the process of economic reforms we must take full account 
of local characteristics and potential; we must make rational 
use of the regions' natural, financial, and human resources and 
industrial potential; we must put these resources into economic 
circulation and promote the development of local 
entrepreneurship, in particular the kind that creates wealth, 
also small and medium-sized businesses. One of the most pressing 
items on the agenda is the matter of optimally harmonizing 
territorial and statewide interests and coordinating them 
effectively. 
  In order to accomplish these goals it will be necessary 
to make a thorough analysis and assessment of the economic 
situation and the state of production and the consumer market in 
each region, and to map out specific ways to get out of the 
crisis. We all know that state administration has virtually 
broken down in many regions, that crime and economic chaos have 
devastated their economy and made economic reforms slow or 
practically impossible. 
  Local administrative bodies need to take measures to 
normalize the economic and social situation in the regions, 
while the central state authorities, in particular the 
appropriate structures of the government, must be much more 
exacting toward the management and economic regulation of the 
regions in order to implement economic reforms properly and 
restore and reactivate economic services. 
  It is essential to make a scientific study, preliminary 
determination, and substantiation of the strategic directions of 
the regions' social and economic development, draw up 
appropriate programs, and strengthen territorial aspects of 
indicator planning. We have to admit that the rich experience 
and scientific potential which the republic has in this regard 
are not being properly utilized right now. 
  The Economics Ministry will have to take steps to restore 
the 
economic services in the regions, draw up indicator plans for 
each region, and strengthen relevant scientific-practical 
research. We are ready to discuss and, as far as possible and to 
the extent it is advisable, to decide on proposals that have 
been submitted to the Cabinet of Ministers for this purpose, 
including the proposal to create scientific-research centers 
concerning economic and social problems based in regional 
departments of the Economics Institute. 
  As we can see, numerous economic and social problems 
have built up in the country. It will take the dedicated effort 
of every economic link to solve them. Every ministry and 
department will have to step up their efforts along these lines. 
In this regard I want to make special mention of the importance 
of our entrepreneurs and private structures. I am aware of how 
the role of this sphere is growing both in terms of overall 
production volume and in terms of meeting the population's need 
for goods and services. I ask the representatives of that sphere 
to make a bigger contribution toward solving the tasks of 
statehood. Don't be angry if I say that there are still too many 
cases where the republic's interests are of hardly any concern 
to certain outfits and businessmen. We will have to overcome 
that mentality and those tendencies; we will have to band 
together in the effort to restore the economy to health and 
solve social problems, in order to provide guarantees to 
overcome the crisis and further enhance the economy.

<F P=106> [Interview with Industry Minister Vladimer Kereselidze by </F>
Armaz Saneblidze, Donetsk-Kiev-Tbilisi: "Economic Passions. A 
Triptych for Two Ministers and a Vice President"; date not given] 
  [Text] Of course you remember the words in the 
subtitle below, from Genesis, when Adam and Eve realized they 
were naked. 
  The race of Adam lives on this "cursed ground" because 
of him (3:17) and must "eat bread in the sweat of his face until 
he returns into the ground" (3:19). 
  We toil for our sustenance all our lives in this era of 
night herdsmen and ministers. 
  And we seek a way out by making aprons appropriate to 
the times, to cover our nakedness. 
  Even today. But on a grander scale. 
  We talked to Georgia's Industry Minister Vladimer 
Kereselidze on specific subjects of practical value, for we've 
had it up to here with the tea, citrus, Borzhomi water and the 
strong, healthy economy promised at rallies. 
<H5>  "And They Sewed Fig Leaves Together, and Made Themselves </H5>
Aprons" 
  [Saneblidze] My first question, Batono Vladimer, is about 
the 
32 percent your enterprises are not paying to the state. Why are 
they hiding it? 
  [Kereselidze] You mean the funds our enterprises have in 
Russia. They add up to a lot, but we can't get them--that is, we 
can't bring them back to Georgia, so the money circulates in 
Russia. 
  I personally am against any deviation; the law is the law, 
and I try to obey it. The republic budget should be getting its 
due. 
  [Saneblidze] You are aware that practical executives have 
their own practical arguments as to why they aren't bringing the 
money into Georgia. 
  [Kereselidze] If they don't put the money to work there, in 
Russia, Georgia's enterprises will just shut down. You know the 
banking and credit system has broken down and transfers between 
countries have been stopped. And, nobody wants our coupons. The 
only chance our factories have now is to circulate the money in 
Russia, for example, to use it to buy the materials and supplies 
the enterprises need. Is that a crime? I think not. But, again, 
we have to obey every lawful requirement. 
  [Saneblidze] Neither sinful nor sinless.... Specifically, 
how 
much does this action by enterprise executives help Georgia's 
economy--or does it? 
  [Kereselidze] Of course not. The situation has to be 
corrected, but that is often beyond the powers of enterprise 
executives. 
  Let's be specific. 
  I mentioned that money circulation between the independent 
countries has been stopped. Here we are in Ukraine, and one of 
my main tasks is to bring it about that the Ukrainians' debts go 
to work in their own country. For example, Tbilisi's 
Elektroapparat and Kutaisi's Automotive Plant have money here 
that they got from selling their products, yet we can't transfer 
it from Kiev to Donetsk Oblast--Makeyevka--in order to obtain 
goods in exchange from that city's enterprises, because 
Ukrainian law forbids it. 
  The intergovernmental agreement we signed should change this 
status quo. That's the goal of me and our delegation. 
  [Saneblidze] I almost hate to ask, but do you think 
Georgia's 
joining the ruble zone is the way to solve the problems of money 
circulation between countries and, hence, industry's problems? 
  [Kereselidze] Of course, if they'll have us! 
  [Saneblidze] Why? 
  [Kereselidze] First, because rubles are rubles and coupons 
are coupons, whether Georgian or Ukrainian coupons. Both 
countries are suffering from hyperinflation, so naturally they 
aren't interested in our coupons, nor we in theirs. If a unified 
zone is created--call it the ruble zone--the problems that today 
are unsolvable for the above reasons will be solved. 
  [Saneblidze] Finance experts (and others besides) think that 
the only way to strengthen Georgia's finances is to revive our 
economy, specifically industry. What are the prospects? 
  [Kereselidze] Economists and finance experts have their own 
ideas on that. I'm not the kind of man who has a ready answer to 
everything. I'll just tell you what industry's contribution to 
the revival of Georgia's economy will be, in the Ministry's 
framework. 
  The Industry Ministry was formed by combining the Light 
Industry Ministry, the Timber and Woodworking Ministry, Local 
Industry Ministry, and plants formerly under Soviet 
jurisdiction. That accounts for its large share: the Ministry 
complex accounts for 50 to 55 percent of Georgia's production 
output. That shows the role it plays in our economy. 
  A lot has been said about the causes of our woes, by your 
newspaper in particular. The main thing, however, is that the 
vital ties our industry used to have with Ukraine, Russia, and 
other former Soviet republics were broken. These ties have to be 
restored. That is the purpose of all our trips to these 
countries. 
  I've already mentioned the other necessity and need not 
repeat it. 
  These things will create the economic climate to help put 
industry back to work. 
  Another thing: unless the problem of natural gas supplies 
and 
electricity is solved, industry cannot function, and the ties we 
are trying to restore cannot operate. In addition, our 
enterprises have been operating at 20-percent capacity until 
now, but in the near future we will wish we had even that. We 
hope that the tremendous efforts we have made along these lines 
will yield results. Last December we concluded an agreement with 
two major committees in Russia; one of them oversees the 
machine-building sectors and eight ministries, while the other 
oversees the military-industrial complex. We have signed an 
intergovernmental agreement with the latter. Questions of 
licensing, quota-setting, and customs duties between Georgia and 
Russia have been completely settled in our sector. 
  Let no one think that the Ministry's leadership is sitting 
idle and waiting to join the ruble zone. 
  I have met with officials of Russia's chemical and 
metallurgical complexes, and documents have been prepared to 
conclude the appropriate agreement. 
  This means we will be bringing in the raw materials, 
components, and supplies our enterprises need; for some 
enterprises these make up 90-95 percent, for others it is less. 
  If, in addition, we restore banking transactions, industry 
will go to work. 
  [Saneblidze] But some specialists doubt that our industry 
can 
start operating, arguing that the plants' and factories' 
equipment has been looted and cadres have departed. 
  [Kereselidze] That's partly true. Policies in recent years 
have caused a certain alienation between the Ministry and, for 
example, plants formerly under Soviet jurisdiction, which have 
gone virtually uncontrolled. For this and other reasons, there 
have been cases of unwise privatization, specialists have quit, 
and equipment, sad to say, has been looted. I had occasion to 
discuss that in an article in your newspaper. But I also want to 
say that executives, engineering-technical personnel, and 
workers are itching to go to work. 
  If we can systematize all this there is no danger of not 
being able to revive our enterprises. 
  And industry will certainly go back to work. 
  [Saneblidze] When? 
  [Kereselidze] Tomorrow! Day after tomorrow!--but only if the 
above conditions are met and, in addition, we get offers from 
the privatized enterprises to work together, requests for the 
Ministry to continue partnership with them. I am certain that 
privatization will yield the desired results when the state 
treats the privatized enterprises with the same consideration as 
those still in the state sector, because ultimately every 
enterprise has to work for the market, and closely with each 
other as well. There are, for example, the Amirani, Kolkheti, 
and Bakhtrioni factories and many others, making up a unified 
link with a different form of ownership. 
  [Saneblidze] About bank credits and your Ministry: do you 
need loans from the state? 
  [Kereselidze] Of course we do, but debts have to be paid 
back. If an enterprise doesn't work, how can it get out of debt? 
Georgia got 60 million dollars in credit from Turkey, and all 
the Industry Ministry got was about 2.5 million, which is 
definitely not in accord with the share our complex occupies in 
the country's economy. 
  Another thing: Western credits ought to be spent boldly on 
conversion, choosing options that are economically sound and 
profitable, so we can invest to create a base producing consumer 
goods, sell the products, and thus pay our debts. What's wrong 
with that? 
  [Saneblidze] Problems keep mounting, and our readers need to 
hear an encouraging word and some specifics. 
  [Kereselidze] Let me assure your paper's readers and the 
public that the Industry Ministry and its whole complex have the 
ability to accomplish the tasks they face. 
  A program has been worked out for 1994, with all the 
enterprises participating, and plans have been mapped. Our 
prognosis calls for a twofold (or more) increase in production 
output; our Ministry has approved its privatization program; we 
have worked out an investment program for the Ministry's 
enterprises and published it in English to attract foreign 
capital to Georgian industry. We are working intensively to 
attract foreign partners, and Australian, German, and American 
specialists are working on specific tasks in this effort. It 
involves, for example, the Mining-Enrichment Combine, the 
Rustavi Chemical Fiber Plant, the Gori Cotton Mill, and others. 
  All of these programs will go into action and will, of 
course, produce results. But until then we have to accomplish 
the prime tasks mentioned above. 
  I think everything is going to go the way the Georgian 
government's strategic plan calls for, and we must not try to do 
everything at once, nor yet too little either. 
<H8>  * * * </H8>
  Debts, debts! Nearly everybody in the country is in 
debt to Sakgazi [the Gas Department], to the tune of a trillion 
coupons. 
  For this reason, Sakgazi can't pay a kopek to the 
countries over whose territories the gas we get from 
Turkmenistan flows; it can't pay the transit fee. 
  Where are we going to get the 40 million dollars it 
will take? 
  A piece of late news: Last Saturday, Sakgazi official 
Davit Eliashvili came back from Turkmenistan and said, We're 
beaten. 
  Because we are so far behind, on 1 February 
Turkmenistan would no longer supply us with gas and.... But 
let's not say what would have happened then, because our guys 
wheedled them into postponing it until 1 April. 
  And that day will come. Last year's 200 million dollars 
will have this year's amount added to it (already 25 million in 
January). Hence, industry has to go to work, there's no other 
way. 
  The great physicist Albert Einstein once said, What 
mankind needs most now is a chair to sit down on and think. 
  Well, because of "meteorological conditions" we've had 
to sit for two days in the Donetsk Airport's waiting room. We've 
said what's on our mind. The three participants in our triptych 
have had their say and left us with their thoughts. 
  To all this let me add one thing. From 1945 to 1950 
Japan took vigorous measures to dismantle its centralized 
economy and convert to the market economy. This big turnaround 
took place in two stages. 
  In the first stage they gave priority to administrative 
measures of regulation, affecting price formation, finances, 
credit, allocation of resources, and wages and salaries. Along 
with filling the markets they carried out stern measures to 
restore financial health and curb inflation. 
  In the second stage they created the conditions 
necessary to develop competition, get rid of price controls, 
liquidate subsidies and budget deficits, and introduce a single 
exchange rate for the yen. And what they ended up with was 
today's remarkable Japanese economy. 
  Many people in our country reject this kind of phased 
development--after all, we are tougher, we'll just get to work 
and get around any economic obstacle. 
  But before we start boasting like hillbillies, let's 
sit down on that chair and think. 
  The Donetsk Airport is as quiet as Georgia's economy. The 
white airplane is shrouded motionless in the fog and time stands 
still. 
  A crow is perched incongruously among the skittishly 
arranged 
lines of the garden's black branches and reacts to nothing. 
  The crow is 299 years old. 
  "You're not afraid of anything, are you?" (Galaktion Tabidze 
[a poet]).

<F P=106> [Interview with Murtaz Zankaliani, Minister of Trade and </F>
Supply, by Armaz Saneblidze, Donetsk-Tbilisi: "Economic 
Passions. A Triptych of Two Ministers and One Vice President": 
date not given] 
  [Text] Nothing original about it--a banal situation 
expressed in a banal way: the Kiev airport was socked in by fog. 
An hour after taking off, our big bird was forced to land in 
Donetsk. 
  All the city airports in Ukraine closed down on 11 
January, and the Georgian government delegation was stuck 
between Tbilisi and Kiev. 
  We had all kinds of time. Immersed in the murk, nobody 
was in any hurry, owing to the "meteorological conditions," and 
it therefore became possible to talk about economic problems 
with three professionals, very frankly, on a subject that was 
very popular and not very dangerous. 
  "Was it a mistake for Georgia to introduce the coupon, 
and if so why? 
  The answer to this question began the interview with 
Murtaz Zankaliani, the minister of trade and supply. 
<H5>  The First Raiment </H5>
  [Zankaliani] The trouble with our economists (I'm an 
economist so I'm speaking mainly of myself) is that we are wise 
after the fact. None among us in Georgia could have predicted 
it. It is after we come to the abyss that we find we've chosen 
the wrong path. That was the case with the coupon. I voiced my 
own skepticism toward it in Parliament. But that's not the main 
thing. The main thing is that after we introduced the coupon we 
had no other choice. We had no other currency, and of course we 
couldn't leave people without pay. 
  [Saneblidze] Were there previous mistakes that brought us to 
this predicament? 
  [Zankaliani] Our mistake was that we should have stayed in 
the inflated ruble zone until we were kicked out. We should have 
had the coupon and the lari [the proposed Georgian national 
currency unit] ready the way many republics of the former USSR 
had their own currency. We were too hasty, rejecting the Russian 
ruble prematurely, although by October 1992 no more rubles were 
coming in from Russia, and all of our government's attempts to 
get rubles were futile. The reason was that in August 1992, in 
Bishkek, where the question of whether to remain in the ruble 
zone was being decided, we did not have a clearly formed 
position, although Russia's representatives easily read between 
the lines and knew that we would be the first to quit the ruble 
zone. That's why they cut us off from the ruble supply source. 
We had in effect quit the zone too quickly. In March and April 
1993 we had no Russian money at all, so we had to introduce the 
coupon whether we liked it or not. 
  [Saneblidze] The political background? Didn't it influence 
that decision? 
  [Zankaliani] Anti-Russian sentiment, of course, was one of 
the main reasons. We realized later that that categorical 
stance, which I criticized at the time, was wrong. We had been 
integrated in the Soviet economy for 70 years; for 200 years we 
have not run our own country as we saw fit, with our own 
resources. Any minister in that period, for example, working 
according to Soviet instructions, was virtually a robot. And not 
just ministers, either. Things were like that on all levels, in 
every sector. We should have learned to run our country first, 
we needed a kind of adaptation period. But we tried to do 
everything at once. There is probably not a man in Georgia who 
thinks that Georgia does not need absolute political 
independence, but economic independence cannot be achieved just 
by revolution and breaking up the old order. Georgia was so much 
integrated into the former unified Soviet economic complex--raw 
materials, supplies, components, energy, standards (an electric 
locomotive assembled in Tbilisi could only be operated, for 
example, within the former USSR), and, finally, the marketing 
system--that breaking up the ties without having something new 
to replace them was tantamount to cutting vital arteries. 
Experience has once more confirmed this sad truth. 
  Economic independence requires gradual preparation; being 
hasty is like building a house from the roof down. That's what 
we tried. 
  [Saneblidze] There was probably a political motive behind 
this? 
  [Zankaliani] Of course, but I'm sure that the politicians 
who 
were so vehemently opposed to these ties and relations have now 
realized the error of this position. 
  [Saneblidze] Let's return to the coupon as an attribute of 
our economic independence.... 
  [Zankaliani] The coupon did work for a few months. The 
biggest plus was that it was accepted by the market and the 
peasant. For the domestic market, for the closed-cycle economy 
(from the producer to the consumer within the borders of 
Georgia), the coupon seemed to be adequate. But that economy is 
extremely small. We have to import energy, raw materials, and 
supplies from outside, you know. When our supplies ran out and 
we had to bring in more, the coupon couldn't do it. Neither 
agriculture nor the peasant could work. Worse, the peasant 
couldn't even bring his crops to the city to sell. The situation 
required Russian currency or some other foreign currency. 
Inflation skyrocketed. In a few months, the coupon-to-ruble 
ratio rose from 1 to 10 to 1 to 100. The coupon became worthless. 
  [Saneblidze] What do you think of circulating the coupon and 
the ruble on an equal basis within the republic? 
  [Zankaliani] I'm a little ambivalent. We have got together 
several times with Vice Premier Amiran Kadagishvili to discuss 
the problem. Two positions have emerged. The first is to permit 
parallel currencies--rubles, dollars, francs and others--along 
with the Georgian coupon (or lari). The second is to seek ways 
and means of keeping the coupon as the sole medium of payment. I 
have not yet formed an opinion, although I do lean toward the 
parallel idea, because, like it or not, we have to import 
supplies and raw materials which the coupon cannot buy. 
  Our governmental delegation intends to conclude agreements 
with various countries on trade and economic cooperation. A 
special place in this package is held by clearing relations. If 
Ukraine agrees to such a relation* (*Footnote: Readers of 
SAKARTVELOS RESPUBLIKA know that the Ukrainian government, in an 
agreement concluded with the Georgian Cabinet of Ministers on 12 
December, made a sole exception for our country and decided to 
engage in cashless settlements--commodity clearing--for Georgia 
alone.)--Russia, Azerbaijan, Kazakhstan, and others have 
already made that decision--it will strengthen the coupon to 
some extent. But the ties we are arranging on the inter-state 
level are still too small, because basically everything goes on 
in the non-state sector, on the level of direct relations, and 
making parallel currencies official will constitute 
acknowledgment of the actual situation. 
  Officially, the coupon is the sole medium of payment. This 
decision is not backed up by any law or normative act, so the 
state cannot punish violators. 
  What shall we do? 
  Let us legalize the existing situation, but... a portion of 
Georgia's population, you know, is classified as socially 
unprotected. For a certain period, at least, the country won't 
be able to pay wages and pensions to these people with Russian 
currency, even in part. For that reason, I'm a little afraid of 
my own proposal to introduce parallel currencies. 
  But if the agreements we get on these trips of ours enable 
us 
to give absolute guarantees to Georgia's socially unprotected 
population that we will accept their coupons for bread, sugar, 
shortening, salt, matches, and so on, also rent and utilities, 
if we accept only coupons on public transportation--if we 
protect their vital interests in this way--then we can introduce 
parallel currencies. 
  This will not be as frightening as some think. In many 
countries, including Ukraine, the coupon is the national 
currency, the sole medium of payment. In parallel fashion, there 
are two-way currency exchange offices, and nobody makes a fuss 
over it. We distort things: Hey, take your coupon and try to 
exchange it for a ruble and see what you get. 
  That's another reason parallel currencies are needed. 
  [Saneblidze] What about doing away with the mafia's ability 
to make money with money? 
  [Zankaliani] Yes, their ability to make money from money is 
a 
distortion of the classical formula of money-commodity-money 
(without which even the classical banking country cannot exist). 
We will never get a market economy that way. Sorry to say, 
Georgia does not yet have any real major businessmen and major 
entrepreneurs. No one has even opened a tiny shop to produce 
combs. A real businessman would generate so much capital in his 
business that he would have 10 to 15 percent profit at the end 
of the year. What is happening in our country is abnormal. There 
are those who think that buying butter cheaply in Moscow and 
selling it dear in Tbilisi is real business.... 
  [Saneblidze] How do you see the problem of the parallel 
currency proposal and our entry into the ruble zone? 
  [Zankaliani] I know that some countries (Belarus, 
Tajikistan) 
are headed that way. But I also know that Russia's economists 
are definitely not in favor of that idea. Specialists in Moscow 
assured me that if Belarus returns to the ruble zone it will 
require printing up an additional trillion rubles, which will 
spark a 10-percent rise in the Russian currency's inflation. 
  Even if we were to try very hard to get back into the 
Russian 
ruble zone, they wouldn't accept us, and rightly so. 
  Nevertheless, entering the ruble zone is not ruled out. It 
depends on what the West actually does to support us--if there 
is an increase in aid, financial injections and investments, if 
the situation in the country calms down, and if our economy 
revives according to the program whose foundation we are laying 
with these visits, a different situation may take shape. But if 
none of this happens, the situation will get so much worse that 
we will have to beg Russia on our knees to take us into the 
ruble zone. 
  As a Georgian and a citizen of my country, I don't want that 
to happen, because when another country's currency is in your 
country, that country calls the shots. 
  We need to take the roundabout route. But I greatly fear 
that 
we will end up having to join the ruble zone. 
  [Saneblidze] So reviving our economy, making it work, is one 
way to establish a national currency. Do I understand you 
correctly? 
  [Zankaliani] Yes. A Georgian currency needs Georgian 
commodities. The Japanese, who have no real natural resources, 
have put their wit to work. We are poor too, we have counted it 
up and all our efforts can't even meet one-fifth of our needs. 
In such a situation, the state, the government will have to 
manage a certain portion--perhaps 30 percent--of our resources 
in the transition stage; the other 70 percent can be allocated 
by the market economy. 
  Well, now we are organizing that management in the Cabinet 
of 
Ministers. We will put the clearing method into action, export 
what we have and import what we need. Our ministry and the 
services which we have created will be the catalysts of coupon 
sales. This will reinforce the coupon. 
  [Saneblidze] You said in one interview that other countries 
in our position have introduced their own national currency or a 
substitute for it and, to stabilize it, received 60 million 
dollars in credit from the World Currency Fund. How about us? 
  [Zankaliani] They have treated us badly. They gave 60 
million 
dollars to Kyrghyzstan so that country could introduce its own 
som. For us they couldn't even spare 60 dollars. I know that the 
National Bank and the Finance Minister are working on these 
problems, and maybe something will work out, especially 
considering that we have been given the status of a developing 
country. We have to work on that. 
  An interesting detail: just 20 million dollars would be 
enough to retrieve the mass of coupons that have been issued to 
the public; that's how high the coupon's inflation is. If we do 
that, maybe it will enhance wages paid in coupons. We really do 
need to make coupons the sole medium of payment in Georgia. We 
have to work on that too. 
  [Saneblidze] That is the only solution. Now, another 
problem--the managed 30 percent of our resources, the rest for 
economic reform. How can these two extremes--centralization and 
reform--coexist? 
  [Zankaliani] The non-state sector is the only way to develop 
the country, its future. But the state must make the effort to 
support it. In France, for example, the state sector makes up 53 
percent (meaning the form of ownership). The decision has to be 
made whether this store or that enterprise belongs to a company, 
a joint-stock company, or the state. And whoever owns it has to 
run it. 
  If we do not provide the people with social protection, they 
won't allow us to build a market economy. Hence, the economy 
cannot exist without state regulation. 
  Anyone today who is thinking of amassing money and living in 
Georgia is making a big mistake. If you have money, put it to 
work, use it to create jobs. 
  Businessmen and entrepreneurs need to give careful thought 
to 
these matters. 
  It is entrepreneurs of the Saradzhishvili type who will save 
Georgia. 
  In conclusion, it should not be hard, going by world 
experience, for these seemingly mutually exclusive 
forces--structures operating by the principles of centralized, 
state management and those of the market economy--to coexist. 
  Generally, however, discussions of these problems, for some 
reason, go by the closed-circle principle: bankers sit by 
themselves, entrepreneurs sit by themselves, and supply 
specialists sit by themselves. We need to look for integrated 
approaches. 
  [Saneblidze] I'll take that advice, and I want to ask your 
opinion about the 32 percent, which remains an unresolved 
problem in the argument between the banks and the entrepreneurs. 
Why can't they agree? 
  [Zankaliani] That is called currency/foreign exchange 
earnings. A country which converts to its own currency passes a 
law that business concerns, and so forth, which have foreign 
currency coming into their accounts have to give the state a 
certain percentage by exchanging it for the local currency. That 
law was passed last April, but to this day not a single ruble 
has come in. Quite apart from private firms, even our state 
enterprises are leaving the money they earned from product sales 
in Russia. That money is circulating there and benefitting 
Russia's economy. That's one of the reasons for our misery. If 
we could regain this money by way of expert appraisal, it would 
add up to about 40 billion rubles, or 5 to 10 million dollars. 
  There are ways to correct the situation, and we ought to do 
so.

<F P=106> [Agrarian Party of Georgia Press Center announcement and </F>
Charter] 
  [Text] On 19 January of this year, a combined congress of 
the All-Georgian Farmers' Union, the Georgian Peasants' Party, 
the Georgian Farmers' Association, the Georgian Landowners' 
Union, and the Georgian Farmers' Party was held. 
  The congress discussed the very strained political, 
economic, 
and social situation in Georgia and ways to solve the crisis. 
  In order to revive the agrarian sector and bring the country 
out of its crisis, the congress decided it is necessary to 
create a powerful, unified party, namely the Agrarian Party, to 
unite all the forces and supporters working in the agrarian 
sector in order to provide for the material wellbeing of the 
republic's working people. 
  The congress founded the Agrarian Party incorporating the 
above-mentioned social-political organizations. 
  As chairman of the Agrarian Party of the Republic of Georgia 
the congress unanimously elected Doctor of Agricultural Sciences 
Roin Liparteliani, a member of the collegium of the Parliament 
of the Republic of Georgia and chairman of the Agrarian 
Commission. 
  As deputy chairmen the congress elected Bidzina Meladze, 
Badri Tsertsvadze, Niko Gelashvili, Anzor Uchaneishvili, Davit 
Sabashvili, Raul Babunashvili, Nodar Kokhreidze, Bondo Papidze, 
Robizon Kaladze, Rezo Esadze, Anzor Charkseliani, Otar Tsomaia, 
Shalva Kekelia, Vazha Iakobidze, Giorgi Tsitlanadze, and Nodar 
Mindiashvili. 
  The congress elected Zaur Charkseliani to serve as the 
party's General Secretary and Pasionaria Gedzhadze as executive 
secretary.

<F P=106> [Article by Radmir Kilmatov: "Oleg Soskovets Will Be Working </F>
on Competition Policy"] 
  [Text] The Council of Ministers has supported the 
State Committee for Antimonopoly Policy and the Support of New 
Economic Structures. A decision signed by the prime minister 
approving the State Program of Demonopolization of the Economy 
and the Development of Competition on Russia's Markets was put 
on the official distribution list yesterday. 
  The program had been formally approved back on 9 December 
last year. A significant part here had been played by the 
president of Russia, who in November had signed an edict 
strengthening the organizational base of the Antimonoply 
Committee. And the cabinet, which has in fact complied with the 
edict, has once again demonstrated that it is not independent in 
the formation of its economic policy. 
  The main direction of the new program is the creation of a 
new antimonopoly legal base. Last week Leonid Bochin, chairman 
of the committee, declared that some of the provisions of the 
Competition and the Limitation of Activity on the Commodity 
Markets Act were today out of date. The first prescriptive 
enactment that will be presented by the Antimonopoly Committee 
for consideration by the government within the framework of the 
program will be the Natural Monopolies bill. Specialists are 
drawing up the legal base for a broadening of the committee's 
sphere of competence--regulation of the activity of the banks 
and control of the securities market could be transferred to its 
jurisdiction. 
  In addition, the committee is currently drawing up documents 
that are not formally within its jurisdiction: a bill on 
advertising (which regulates the sanctions on organizations 
conducting increased-risk transactions with the citizens' 
deposits) and on commodity exchanges. In Leonid Bochin's 
opinion, granting them privileges is impermissible since the 
exchanges have not justified the commitments they assumed and, 
"with the departure of the superprofits," have virtually 
disbanded of their own accord. It is becoming obvious that the 
committee, which affords no reason for it to be suspected of 
lobbying activity, will be used by the government as a lightning 
rod when projects evoking the harshest criticism are being 
pushed through. 
  Coordination of the actions of the ministries and 
departments 
in realization of this program has been entrusted to the 
Interdepartmental Commission for Competition Policy, which is 
headed by First Deputy Prime Minister Oleg Soskovets. The nature 
of the work of the first deputy prime minister is reason to 
suppose that the range of projects proposed by the committee and 
accepted for execution will be extremely limited. The 
touchstone, according to the information of KOMMERSANT, will be 
discussion of the actions of the Russian oil companies, which, 
in Leonid Bochin's opinion, "have shared out the domestic market 
and eliminated competitive struggle." The committee is proposing 
that the government examine this question from the standpoint of 
legislation. 
  It is possible that the realization of the provisions of 
this 
program will breathe new life into the competition of Russia's 
manufacturers, which is fading before our eyes. But even a 
cursory analysis of the program leads to the conclusion 
concerning its exclusively abstract nature. Yet the deep roots 
of Russian monopolism require not so much narrow-departmental 
antitrust programs as a reform of the entire structure of the 
Russian economy and also the operational actions of the 
appropriate power departments. Without this, Russian business 
will not sense an improvement in its environment, and the 
competitive space, in whose formation it has an interest, will 
not be created. 
  [begin box] 
<H5>  Priorities of the State Program of Demonopolization of the </H5>
Economy and the Development of Competition in 1994-1995 
  --Creation of a legal base of federal regulation of the 
subjects of natural and state monopoly 
  --Demonopolization of the trade, construction, and highway 
and transport complexes and communications, measures to break 
down associations into smaller units, and the regulation of 
mergers and the concentration of capital on a legislative basis 
  --State control of the progress of privatization to prevent 
the creation of new monopoly structures 
  --Removal of the legal, administrative, and financial 
barriers to commodities, services, and capital on the Russian 
market and the lowering of them for the new economic structures 
  --Regulation of direct budget appropriations and privileges 
and other methods of the creation of unequal conditions of 
management. [end box]

<F P=106> [Article by O. Kharlamenko, head of the Mariopol PZU (Green </F>
Party of Ukraine) Club, and L. Olshevskyy, member of the ZELENYY 
SVIT UEA (Ukrainian Ecodefencinform Agency): "Why Are There So 
Few Happy Families in Mariopol?"] 
  [Text] During the first quarter of last year 800 marriages 
were registered in Mariopol, whereas 764 divorces were 
registered during this same period. According to data from a 
sociological poll conducted by a civic organization here, the 
principal reason for such "family" instability is the 
infertility and impotence of this city's human population. These 
factors have reached 60 percent and 33 percent respectively. 
  However, even if a family in Mariopol has a "real man," that 
does not necessarily mean that such a family will add a third or 
fourth member. The rate of stillbirths and infant mortality 
before the age of one year during the period 1989-1991 varied 
between 45 percent and 50 percent. Thanks to modern-day 
medicine, this indicator declined to 26 percent in 1992. But 
this was specifically due to ultrasonic diagnostics and the 
interruption of pregnancy in cases where anomalies were 
discovered. And this was already after nature itself had made a 
choice: From 1989 through 1992 the number of miscarriages 
increased from 24 to 32 per 100 pregnancies. 
  Nor can those families in which an infant has arrived always 
be called happy. Of each 1000 children, 22 are born with birth 
defects (for the sake of comparison, in Simferopol this 
indicator stands at 8). 
  At a time when the birth rate is declining, the mortality 
rate is rising: During the first quarter of 1993 it increased by 
25 percent in comparison with this same period in 1992. But what 
do births and deaths have in common? The connecting link here is 
a cancer-treatment facility which was built for 90 beds but 
which now has 220. 
  This situation is dreadful, but it can be explained. This 
city with its 540,000 inhabitants provides 35 percent of 
Ukraine's steel and 30 percent of Ukraine's sheet metal. 
Mariopol also produces 90 percent of all kinds of septic tanks, 
as well as equipment for metallurgical and ore-enriching 
complexes. It carries out contracts for the Ministry of Medium 
Machine Building, and--in addition--has a plant producing 
medical equipment, as well as very large construction 
enterprises. The Mariopol seaport is the biggest on the shores 
of the Sea of Azov. Its annual goods turnover amounts to 12 
million tonnes. Plying the world's oceans are at least 100 ships 
of the Azov Shipping Company, which are registered in the Port 
of Mariopol. 
  And all these entities are gasping and spewing out terrible 
poisons. Two steel-smelting plants and one coal-tar chemical 
plant have become particularly old and obsolete. This complex, 
which still bears the name of Illich, is regarded as the most 
modern and up-to-date in Ukraine. Among its production 
facilities, which extend around the city's outskirts, is an 
open-hearth shop with three furnaces having a capacity of 900 
tonnes each and three others having a capacity of 650 tonnes 
each. It has these furnaces, but they lack any equipment for 
combatting the contaminants from them. During the last 30 years 
unsafe wastes discharged by these plants have accumulated in 
enormous quantities in bodies of water which are unsuitable for 
this purpose. Solid wastes alone, which include 75 percent iron 
compounds, 1 percent manganese compounds, and 1.2 percent zinc 
compounds, have accumulated to the extent of more than a million 
tonnes. People say that during the Soviet Union period the 
Japanese wanted to acquire all of these materials wholesale, but 
the Soviet government refused--saying that not a single gram of 
strategic raw material should be turned over to a potential 
enemy. And the adulterated wastes have been abandoned at two 
dump sites, from which sufuric acid has already been leaking for 
many years now. 
  That which the people of Mariopol drink can hardly be termed 
"water." The small Northern Donets River, which constitutes the 
principal source of water here, is dreadfully polluted, and the 
purification station is not operating in accordance with the 
normative requirements. Its operators have been compelled to add 
more chlorine than provided for by the norms, but that still 
does not help the situation much because waste waters are 
seeping into the system. 
  At one time Mariopol was a health-resort area. But nowadays 
the beaches are closed down every year. Salmonela bacteria have 
been found near the waste-water discharge collectors on the 
beaches, and cholera bacteria have been found in the Kalchyk 
Stream, which winds its way through the city. 
  It is not an easy matter to track down all these bad things, 
all the more so in that there are only five inspectors on the 
staff of the Ministry for Environmental Protection's local 
administration. Efforts to reinforce them should not be impeded. 
It would also be a good idea to outfit them with up-to-date 
monitoring equipment. Only when a correct diagnosis has been 
made and effective monitoring controls set up will we be able to 
actually proceed to carry out plans providing for the 
development of alternative industrial sectors, the optimization 
and modernization of metallurgical enterprises, as well as 
putting new purification capacities into operation.

<F P=106> [Interview by Vasyl Tarchynets with Viktor Pynzenyk; date </F>
and place not given: "Myths and Reality"] 
  [Text] 
  [Tarchynets] Mr. Pynzenyk, everyone knows that you are 
concerned for the economy, but some of the many people with whom 
I have spoken, including military financial officials, are 
nonetheless completely convinced that you are more a theoretical 
economist than a practical one... 
  [Pynzenyk] Speaking frankly, these sorts of attacks have 
always been made against me in Parliament. But no matter how 
strange it is, the directors who once did not understand and did 
not have any concept, support me today, for example in the 
question of free conversion. At first, some leaders decided in 
this way to remove hard currency. Life showed that it did not. 
Then it began to be removed, when their director-colleagues in 
the government introduced a fixed rate, against which I, a 
"theoretical economist," spoke. 
  Perhaps it will again seem to some that I theorize too much. 
Today when it is said to me that the army is on hunger rations, 
I can easily show that it is not a problem of the army but a 
problem of the budget policy in general. If, let us say, the 
budget is made up of income from production, then first of all 
it has to turn to where there is no production. There is also no 
formation of income. Thus, it has to go to science, education, 
culture, art, public health, and defense, and to support the 
poor. But if we give this money from the budget back to 
production, and then what is left to the army, we will always be 
in a pitiable situation. So it turns out that it is not only a 
problem of the army but of the state's budget policy in general. 
There is significantly less deducted for the army in the budget 
for this year, than some budget loans to certain commercial and 
government structures, which do not have to take part in the 
distribution of the budget. 
  [Tarchynets] It would be desirable to know why this is 
happening. 
  [Pynzenyk] I think this is a misunderstanding. The basic 
incompetence of people, who "grew up" in the old system, when 
the government took care of everything. Production above all. 
When it took everything and did everything. And it wishes to 
continue doing this for the future. I do not say that it is 
necessary to give the army as much as it wants. But there must 
not be a situation in which officers and soldiers are not paid 
their wages for December and January, and in which our army, in 
a fundamental way, cannot realize its military preparedness. We 
are not so poor that these structures, this system, cannot be 
financed. It is enough, let us say, to remove from the budget 
just one section which is not needed there--and we will have 
funds for the army and for other budget areas. 
  [Tarchynets] It is understood that the army does not live 
only on wages. Its vital activity and combat readiness is a 
complex matter. So plans for military preparedness should also 
be well supported. Our Armed Forces have to have modern arms. 
  [Pynzenyk] Today, we will not reach the level at which we 
once had a military-industrial complex. But 40 percent of the 
economy of Ukraine was connected with the military-industrial 
complex! Now certain defense enterprises are being converted. 
But it is not entirely a good thing, when, for example, a plant 
which made powerful rockets begins to produce saucepans... 
  [Tarchynets] Recently, an effective phrase by Shaposhnikov, 
the former Minister of Defense of the former Soviet Union, 
spread in the Russian press, that soon Ukraine's aviation will 
become a great winged museum on the ground... 
  [Pynzenyk] In fact, we proposed some ways to resolve this 
problem. For example, today we have many aircraft that are 
"grounded." We do not even need them. There were buyers for 
them. It was necessary to sell them and buy some other arms, 
which we lack for the military preparedness of our army. 
Everyone trades in arms. Ordinarily, the trade is made following 
international norms. 
  There are several structures where it is necessary not to 
begrudge pennies. It is necessary not to begrudge paying customs 
officials, energy structures, and tax inspectorates, because 
they are the support for normal economic restructuring. If we 
begrudge paying a customs official, he will look for illegal 
earnings or, more precisely, bribes. Whoever begrudges paying 
his own army is nourishing a foreign army. 
  [Tarchynets] I agree with you. And now I am expressing, 
perhaps, the wishes of the wide circle of future voters. All are 
interested in learning about the basic directions of your 
economic program. What do you, as an experienced professional 
and parliamentarian, wish to do, and are able to do, to improve 
the life of the people? 
  [Pynzenyk] Our state can become unique. I believe that 
Ukraine could begin its rebirth from the point that people could 
begin to live better. This would be different from the other 
states which came out of the crisis. For example, Poland began 
reforms right away, and things got worse. For us, things got 
worse without reforms. Thus, the first serious steps could 
provide the first improvements. These steps require a month or 
two. I will explain how this can be achieved. 
  Today in Ukraine, a very major shadow redistribution of 
incomes is taking place. The incomes of the majority remain in 
the hands of a very small group of people. All this is not the 
result of reforms, but the reverse--of blocking them, basically 
thanks to the insane putting of huge additional sums of money 
into circulation. 
  Let us look at this real life example. Let us say that I 
wish 
to earn something today. This is very easy and, unfortunately, 
legal. I buy televisions for one billion, using a loan. Over a 
year, prices rise 60 times. In a year, I sell them for 60 
billion. People buy them for 60 billion. And I return to the 
loaning agency one billion plus six billion in interest. The 
difference, 53 billion, goes into the pockets of individuals. 
  It is very easy to stop this. One decision is made: the bank 
of Ukraine stops issuing money. Cash becomes cheaper only as a 
result of inflation. And when speculative processes in the 
intermediary area disappear, people will stop saying that it is, 
in general, necessary. There will not be insane profits. The 
problem of the depreciation of people's savings will also 
disappear. So that when I put cash in the bank, I will have to 
pay for this no less than what results from inflation. And I 
will not think about where to hide money since it will be more 
expensive tomorrow. I know that if I deposit it, in a month I 
will be able to buy more, not less. And the main thing is that 
the terrible shadow redistributions of incomes will stop. 
  Another direction: if today the commercial sector is quickly 
transferred to private property, our people will only win. Why? 
I will explain. An item is bought, it stays in stock. And prices 
grow constantly. A question arises: who gets the differences in 
the prices (between what it was acquired for, and the current 
ones)? If this were my store, I would sell for the normal price. 
But the store is not mine, and I bought some liquor a year ago 
somewhere for 200 coupons, and today it costs 60,000, then who 
gets the difference? I get it! How? Someone comes in and offers 
me a bribe: sell it, he says, for the price at which you bought 
it. And on paper it really cost me 200 coupons... The one who 
gave me the bribe gets the second difference. Here the remedies 
are the same: speedy privatization. 
  What would I do for privatization? I would put vouchers into 
people's hands. Today, a voucher is valued at approximately 25 
million karbovantsy. Average families, which are made up of four 
to five people, could get 100 to 150 million karbovantsy. One 
will want to buy a share in a store, a second, a share in a 
plant, a third, to open his own business, a fourth to obtain 
land or an apartment. Whoever needs the money can sell the 
vouchers. This is not small change, and now it is necessary to 
begin a mass scale, almost a powerful privatization. 
  I would also change in a major way the sphere of 
export-import policy. When someone says that it is necessary to 
save the state from being looted, then as a rule, it concerns 
the defense of official, even personal interests, but not state 
ones. The state is wealthy when it sells something. No one gives 
us oil, or gas, or wood. The problem is not one of where to buy: 
in Russia or in America... It is necessary to earn. But for this 
it is necessary to "produce" something to export. And of course, 
at the present rate for the karbovanets, which is artificially 
set by the national bank, export becomes unprofitable. A fixed 
rate could be introduced, but a so called over devaluated one. 
For example, 50,000 karbovantsy to the dollar. I would stop the 
printing of new money. We would have a new situation, which we 
still have never had. First, export would become very 
profitable. Second, we would have a stable rate, with which we 
could exchange, sell, or buy dollars or Russian rubles. There is 
one more point: then people would begin to flee from dollars. 
Why flee? If I save 100 dollars today, I will earn 10 percent 
annually. In a year, I will have 110 dollars. But if I sell 100 
dollars and save the coupons, then I will earn 10 percent per 
month for the coupons. In a year I will buy more dollars than 
under the first variant. We have over 10 billion "greenbacks" in 
hand. They can become an internal source for investment in the 
Ukrainian economy. 
  [Tarchynets] We have, it seems, come to an interesting 
problem. Please tell us whether the programs or proposals which 
you have made in the government and Parliament have found 
support, and whether you yourself agree with what was proposed 
to you and us? And finally, what led to your own decision to 
quit? 
  [Pynzenyk] The paradox lies in the fact that we often have 
made good decisions, but forgotten them the next day. The 
classic example is our budget. It has to be by law. And no one 
dares to go against it. But on the next day, someone somehow 
refines it, in fact, not Parliament. Who takes a delicate morsel 
for himself, first of all? The "bison" who have access to 
decision making on the budget. And you, and the army, are left 
out. For example, something is not indexed for you. So if we 
confirm the budget, then a sum (and no more) can go into the 
economy. Since otherwise the budget areas are left without funds. 
  The problem of reforms is not that we do not know what to 
do. 
The real problem is that we do not have a harsh political will. 
Democracy is good when there is knowledge. And just the reverse, 
when there is no knowledge, there cannot be talk about 
democracy. Democracy also is suitable only for making decisions. 
After this, there comes the dictatorship of performance and 
harsh control over the performances. I think that a person who 
does not perform a task has not justified society's faith, has 
played a trick on it, and must be immediately forced from his 
position. 
  Why did I leave the government? Of course, I could have done 
this much earlier. I knew that working in it would not give me 
authority. But I thought: as long as I can force through even 
one good decision, or hinder even one bad one, I do not have the 
right to leave the governmnet. It was painful to be stopped on 
the street by people upset by prices. Today, true, the situation 
is a little different. A great many people in Kiev that I do not 
know greet me... 
  This is one of the decisions, concerning prices for 
agricultural production, taken behind my back. My signature is 
not on this document. And it, the decision, very much got 
inflation going, and harmed people, especially the poorest ones. 
But the main thing is that it did not help the countryside. Just 
the opposite; it pushed it again to its knees. The people who 
made this decision did not understand anything. This was one of 
the reasons I quit. 
  A second one. Let us say that few people know, that for 
three 
months I fought in the government against the currency rate 
established at that time. I thought that while I was a member of 
the "team," I did not have the right to take this outside the 
cabinet; I have to fight for changes. And when I did not manage 
to stop or change the decision, I thought that from then on, I 
did not have the right to remain in the government. And in fact, 
if you now ask any director of an enterprise--a state one, a 
private one, or ask a banker: what did the most harm to the 
Ukrainian economy? They will tell you this very decision--the 
introduction of the fixed rate. When the previous decision was 
in effect, which we had agreed on in the government, from April 
to September of last year, the flow of dollars, marks, and 
Russian rubles into Ukraine increased ten times. The collapse 
came after the September decision, after the introduction of the 
fixed rate for Ukrainain currency. 
  [Tarchynets] And what happened with the Ukrainian voucher, 
about which so much was said, but we still do not have it? 
  [Pynzenyk] I just spoke about this. We do not have a voucher 
as such, we have an open account. But this is very awkward, 
since people do not know about this account. Only 600,000 people 
have used it to this point. It is necessary to put vouchers into 
people's hands. 
  I want to talk about one more thing. We are now working on 
the privatization of an auto plant in Zaporizhzhya. Some of the 
stock will be sold for these Ukrainian vouchers, and it will be 
possible to acquire them. It is only necessary to watch for the 
announcements in the press. A Canadian firm has agreed to 
prepare the vouchers themselves, for 800,000 dollars. I think 
that this is not such a large sum when we are needlessly wasting 
millions of dollars. It is necessary to do this more quickly, 
and let people decide the fate of their own certificates. 
  [Tarchynets] We were promised long ago that the hryvnya 
would 
be introduced. The rumor was spread that therefore money will 
not be given... 
  [Pynzenyk] This is not a method of struggle but a method of 
making people bitter. Steps cannot be taken which cause the 
people's distrust. So it goes! Wages are figured for people, but 
they are in general not paid. I think that such things are 
impermissible; this is not connected with putting extra money 
into circulation; you just decrease the quantity of non-cash 
money and issue coupons. 
  I would not reform money today, since we have a national 
currency. And when I look at the programs of certain deputies, 
this is the impression: either I do not understand anything, or 
they, perhaps, do not understand a thing. We have our own 
national unit of money. And if I had at some point to work with 
the "team," I would want to show the many "economists," 
especially in Kiev, that the coupon will be "firm" and will 
"stand..." And then we will simply seize it. Since it is awkward 
to use a whole heap of paper. Then, let us say, instead of 
10,000 coupons we will give people one hryvnya. But we will give 
them to everyone. And I would continue the open currency reform, 
and would not hide it. We have no reasons to confiscate money. 
Some have the illusion that it will be confiscated from rich 
people. This is more than an illusion, because none of the rich 
have money in coupons. They have it in property or in dollars. 
But if one wishes to rob invalids, and poor people, the question 
comes up: what are we robbing them for?! We have 13 trillion 
karbovantsy in the hands of the population. If this is divided 
among 52 million people, this would just be 240,000 karbovantsy 
each. 
  The problem is not in the name of the money. The policy 
concerning it must be different. I have one very unusual coupon. 
On it is written "dollar..." But it did not become stronger 
because of this. It will become stronger when money is in a very 
large deficit. And this will happen when, first of all, the 
printers are stopped... 
  [Tarchynets] I do not know what the truth is in this, but I 
have somehow been told, that in the time of huge inflation for 
our neighbors (in Poland) wages were paid either daily, or 
weekly... And they somehow knew what to do, and were saved. 
  [Pynzenyk] It is not thanks to this that they knew what to 
do. Our people also are adapting themselves. I know some who are 
getting rather small wages, but at the beginning of every month 
buy five dollars for themselves, for example. So in dollars the 
money does not depreciate. But this is dangerous, abnormal, 
since when there are inflationary expectations, people flee from 
money. It is necessary for people not to adapt themselves to 
conditions of inflation; it is necessary to fight with 
inflation. Our inflation is unique. I will try to explain. Some 
think, that in our case it is linked with a lack of goods... 
Nothing of the kind! Our production (outside of consumer 
goods)has fallen by 25 percent over two years. This means that 
for this reason prices could increase by 40 percent, but they 
have reason over a year by six thousand times. What is the 
reason for this? The printers have not stopped. An insane amount 
of money is in circulation. More precisely, this basically 
concerns not ready money, but non-cash emission. But if there 
are no more goods, this additional money will only overflow into 
prices. The question could come up: "You say it is good... Why 
did you not do this?" 
  And remember how many decisions have been made in session 
about the emission of trillions? In fact, the national bank, 
without a decision by the government, in March made an emission 
of almost a trillion, which then undermined the stabilization of 
prices which had begun. We already had a stable rate, and in 
relation to the ruble that rate of the coupon even increased. 
Inflation itself is one of the reasons for the flight of 
currency out of the country. 
  Imagine a situation: I am exporting, and dollars remain in 
the West. But I cannot begin production. I can "pressure," 
especially, let us say, if I am still a deputy: let us have an 
emission. Needs for raw supplies and resources cover the 
reckoning of credit for me... This must not be. If there are no 
emissions, then either I will return the dollars here, or a 
plant goes bankrupt, and then an investigation begins. Documents 
are checked, and it appears that production was sabotaged, and 
the dollars are not returned. Articles of the Criminal Codex 
might be applied. In fact, criminal responsibility has been 
introduced for concealing currency outside the country (two to 
five years in prison).

<F P=106> [Interview with Prime Minister Yefym Zvyahilskyy of Ukraine </F>
by Lidiya Timofeyeva; time and place not given: "The Prime 
Minister Believes in Success"] 
  [Text] To tell the 
truth, it took some waiting to get an opportunity to talk with 
Yefym Zvyahilskyy, the twentieth prime minister of Ukraine since 
1918. First, he was held up by business in his native Donetsk, 
where he is again running for the office of deputy to parliament 
and was reporting to his voters; then, contrary to etiquette, 
his meeting with the American ambassador ran much longer than 
expected because of a deep interest on both sides, then Russian 
television questioned him meticulously regarding the future of 
Ukraine... 
  He is 61 years old. Heavy-set and deliberate of movement. 
His 
gaze is intent and penetrating, instantly appraising his 
colocutor and the situation. In contrast, his answers are 
unhurried and well thought-out. His somewhat colorless voice 
comes alive when he "gets going" as his interest is engaged. A 
typical "workaholic," for whom work and pleasure are one. He 
comes in at eight in the moring and leaves at ten or eleven at 
night. He spends all of Saturday and part of Sunday at work as 
well. He likes to win and respects results. He is conservative 
in his views: he has no use for revolutions and prefers a 
peaceful, evolutionary development, retaining all the positive 
things that were already achieved before he came to power. 
  You could call him "lucky" in summarizing his life, or you 
could describe him as a otrudyagap [not further identified], who 
achieved success through hard work and an unquestionable talent 
for leadership. At his age, he is no longer tempted by a career; 
he simply wants to help Ukraine in this difficult time with his 
experience and knowledge. 
  He is mining engineer by profession. He has passed through 
all the stages of the miner's hard life: from mining foreman to 
mine director. His "last love" was the Zasyadko Mine in Donetsk. 
Under him, this mine, which had always lagged behind, was 
transformed. The plan was one thing, but the fact is that not 
only was he able help the mine attain all the achievement 
banners, but, more important, he made people's lives a little 
happier. Under him, housing construction, which had been at a 
standstill, started up: they began with self-financing, building 
two-story houses, and now they are erecting 15-story buildings, 
with improved plans and with apartments measuring 60 square 
meters of floor space. The health resort he built in Sudak on 
the Black Sea consists exclusively of first-class accomodations 
with bathrooms and kitchens. "As far as I am concerned, 
everybody is equal: be they ministers or cleaning women. I do 
not divide people into black and white..." Thanks to him, the 
mine bought itself a state farm in the old days. Zvyahilskyy 
managed to arrange a meeting with Shcherbytskyy, and the latter 
put his magical "I approve" on the director's request for 
permission to buy the farm. And so the miners had meat, milk, 
and butter in large quantities and at production cost. 
  In the 13 years that he served as director, he won the trust 
not only of the mine employees, but also of the residents of 
Donetsk itself. For a full year, he headed the Donetsk city 
council and executive committee, and then on 11 June 1993, he 
was appointed first deputy prime minister by a presidential 
decree. Since 22 September, following the departure of Kuchma, 
he has served as acting prime minister and simultaneously first 
deputy prime minister of Ukraine. Although the president is 
currently the official head of government, having taken on the 
additional burden of the duties of two deputy prime ministers -- 
responsible for the economy and for the fuel and energy complex 
-- Zvyahilskyy in fact heads the reorganized Cabinet of 
Ministers. It is no mere chance that the first question we asked 
him was: 
  [Timofeyeva] In your opinion, what is the economic situation 
in the country, and what has the government succeeded in doing 
and what has it failed to do so far? 
  [Zvyahilskyy] The situation in the country remains 
complicated, but there are some signs of stabilization of the 
economy. We have been able to curb hyperinflation a little: 
compared to December, when it was running very high, it fell by 
a factor of 4.5 in January-February. We have stabilized the 
exchange rate of the Ukrainian coupon -- it has virtually 
remained unchanged since January. The prices of food products 
are holding and not rising. And in some oblasts, for example, in 
Donetsk, the price of butter has fallen by 7,000 coupons. The 
prices of sugar and alcoholic beverages are also dropping... 
  We now have new forms of clearing operations with the 
different sectors of the economy. We are not opening new credit 
lines for the farms; instead, we are giving them credits in the 
form of goods in exchange for future finished production in 
1994: fertilizers, spare parts for machinery... And when they 
bring in the harvest, they will give the state their production 
at equivalent prices. This will also help stabilize the economy 
and prevent funds from being squandered. 
  [Timofeyeva] What priority tasks have you set yourself for 
the coming year? 
  [Zvyahilskyy] The principal task is to solve the problem of 
clearing operations among enterprises and farms on a nonemission 
basis. 
  [Timofeyeva] You are accused of pursuing an extremely rigid 
line, which makes one to wonder if you are not perhaps returning 
to the earlier command-economy methods of managing the economy. 
What is your response to this charge? 
  [Zvyahilskyy] Market relations are regulated everywhere. Go 
back to history, look at the United States, Germany, and other 
countries. Strict regulation was the only thing that enabled 
them to overcome their crises. And, generally speaking, why 
should the state renounce functions that are part of its 
responsibilities? Why should exports and imports flow 
uncontrolled? We had total liberalization of prices in Ukraine 
for two years. And now we are seeing the lamentable results of 
this policy. Why should a person be able to come to the exchange 
and buy a million dollars without anyone knowing whether he has 
returned this million to Ukraine or moved it abroad? We have now 
proposed something else -- a tender committee instead of an 
exchange (the operations of the exchange have been suspended for 
the time being). But now I know that if five million dollars are 
bought to pay Russia for gas, tomorrow this money will be on its 
way, and the day after tomorrow we will have the gas we paid 
for. We also have to control the price of energy supplies. Three 
or four months ago, dealers held back oil products and kept them 
standing while they waited for a large issue of money to be 
injected into the market (they are no longer satisfied with a 
price of 12-13 million; they are waiting for it to reach 15 
million...) Why should they be allowed to control the economy by 
speculation? That is not what a market is all about. To begin 
with, it is our state enterprises, the State Oil and Gas 
Committee and Ukrahroservis, that should be buying the oil. We 
follow the weekly reports from the Mediterranean area plats [not 
further identified]. We calculate, watch, compare this with our 
own currency exchange rate, and determine that the price of oil 
products in Ukraine should be 150 dollars and not 240 or 250, as 
some would like. We have set a fixed rate of exchange for 
petrodollars for the priority branches of industry and we 
maintain it. You see, ultimately petrodollars enter into the 
price of flour, bread, milk, meat... This being the case, why is 
that what we are doing is viewed as wrong? Who can explain this 
to me? Yes, reforms are under way, including in agriculture. Is 
privatization not reform? And holding down prices on food 
products -- is this not reform? 
  [Timofeyeva] How do you understand the term "Ukrainization 
of 
the economy," which is used from time to time to scare the 
Russian government? 
  [Zvyahilskyy] That is Gaydar's idea. He is the one who 
believes that it is not necessary to regulate the economy and 
that reforms will happen of their own accord. Fortunately for 
Russia, the proportion of its exports is still higher than its 
imports and that every year it receives a certain sum of hard 
currency, which it can infuse into the economy and thus curb 
inflation. But what will happen when there are no more exports?.. 
  The inordinately high nonpayment amounts are strangling both 
Russia and Ukraine. But your prices have begun to climb, while 
ours have stabilized. Why? Because we regulate the exchange rate 
of our currency. I do not interfere in the production process 
and tell a plant director that he must not make engines but must 
make meat grinders instead... No. Technology, production, raw 
materials -- these are all up to the one organizing production. 
My only requirement is that there be a demand for your product. 
It must be exportable and competitive. If you produce for the 
warehouse and then demand that the government give you money 
because you cannot sell your products, what purpose does this 
kind of production serve? Let these producers either switch to 
making something else or declare bankruptcy. Towards this end, 
we need to work out a program to protect the unemployed. 
  Take our banks as an example. They were completely 
unregulated. When the tax inspectorate came, it was shocked at 
the number of abuses it found. What makes a banker more valuable 
than an academician, allowing him to pay himself a salary of 150 
million? Why does a miner, who works underground in extremely 
difficult and dangerous conditions, earn a maximum salary of 
four million coupons? We decided that the maximum salary should 
be six million. Anything above six million and you pay a 
progressive tax up to 90 percent. And what does raising bank 
interest rates from 250 to 400-500 percent mean? It means higher 
prices, which fall as a heavy burden on the shoulders of the 
people. And so now if a banker hikes up rates, we will collect a 
higher percentage from him. That is the point of state 
regulation -- to prevent businessmen from artificially elevating 
the prices of essential goods and products. 
  [Timofeyeva] We have heard talk behind the scenes here that 
Ukraine is planning to join the CIS not as an associate member 
but as a full-fledged partner in this union. Is this true? 
  [Zvyahilskyy] Yes, and we are planning to consider this 
matter very carefully at a meeting of the Cabinet of Ministers 
in the very near future. 
  [Timofeyeva] How do you think your proposal will be met? 
Will 
you not be accused of betraying the interests of Ukraine? What 
effect will this have on the fate of your government? 
  [Zvyahilskyy] Sensible people who wish Ukraine well, who are 
distressed by the state of their country's economy, will 
understand. As to the attitude of others -- on their conscience 
be it... 
  [Timofeyeva] What has made you decide to run again for 
parliament? Is this a reflection of your precarious position in 
the government, or is this a determination on your part to 
combine the duties of a deputy with those of a prime minister? 
  [Zvyahilskyy] Let me answer you as follows. I was elected 
deputy four years ago as a candidate of the labor collective of 
the Zasyadko Mine in the Kiev district of the city of Donetsk, 
where there are 103,000 voters. I recently held eleven meetings 
with members of this constituency. At just one meeting -- 
attended exclusively by pensioners and veterans of the Great 
Patriotic War -- nearly 1,000 people showed up. I talked with 
people at the mines, who had just come off their shifts. In 
short, with people who are accustomed to speak the truth to your 
face. And at no time did I hear an insulting tone or a 
provocative remark. People talked of the hardships that surround 
them, made suggestions, expressed criticism, but with concern 
rather than agitation. This is normal. In the four years that I 
served, I fulfilled virtually all the mandates of those who 
elected me, even though these were rather large. It gave me 
moral satisfaction to have been able to help people. But all 
these mandates still need to be carried through to completion 
and followed to ensure that they are fulfilled. Thus, if I did 
not run again from the same district and from the same labor 
collective that put forward my candidacy, my conscience would 
bother me that I had failed to perform my duty. This is the main 
reason. 
  Then, too, if I am to represent the interests of the people, 
I need to be a people's deputy, so that I can deal on an equal 
footing with other deputies, who otherwise could say to me at 
any moment: we have been elected by the people, and who are you? 
  [Timofeyeva] What tasks do the coming elections have to 
solve? Who needs them to begin with -- the government, the 
deputies, or the people? 
  [Zvyahilskyy] This was the will of the people in all the 
regions, both east and west. And the will of the people must be 
obeyed. As a matter of fact, I supported this at the session of 
the Supreme Council and voted for it. This idea was supported by 
the miners and metallurgists. Ending the crisis in the economy 
requires that something be sacrificed. So let us sacrifice 
ourselves. 
  [Timofeyeva] Does this mean that these elections will bring 
a 
new government, new people onto the scene: will the parliament 
not have to confirm it? 
  [Zvyahilskyy] This can happen. Although I think that 
frequent 
changes of government will hardly help to stabilize the 
situation.

<F P=106> [Unattributed article, under the rubric "Business": "The </F>
Ukrainian Gas Corporation Introduces Tight Controls on Gas 
Consumption"] 
  [Text] Taras Freyuk, deputy chairman of the Ukrainian Gas 
Corporation UKRHAZ, has announced that tighter controls on gas 
consumption will soon be introduced at all 80,000 enterprises 
served by the corporation. In addition, 100,000 household gas 
meters will be installed this year in Ukraine. 
  In the opinion of experts from the State Oil and Gas 
Committee of Ukraine, these measures will serve as the first 
step towards introducing a normal economy drive and precise 
controls on gas consumption in the country. This will also make 
it possible to determine accurately what each enterprise owes. 
It should be noted that this innovation by UKRHAZ is not an 
excessive measure: last year, because of a lack of tight 
controls by the gas corporation, the State Oil and Gas Committee 
was forced to write off approximately three billion cubic meters 
of gas as technical losses. 
  In light of the above, UKRHAZ has decided to begin 
implementing the state program for producing household gas 
meters at Ukrainian enterprises this year. This program was 
developed jointly with the Ministry of Machine-Building of 
Ukraine in accordance with the government decree of 19 April 
1993 "On Measures To Reduce the Consumption of Fuel and Energy 
Resources." 
  Ukraine needs a minimum of some three million gas meters, 
while the number required in the household sector is more than 9 
million meters, lus an additional 100,000 more each year for 
farms furnished with gas. In light of these figures, UKRHAZ was 
the initiator of the Cabinet of Ministers decree (3 April 1993) 
that charged the Ministry of Machine-Building with setting up 
the series production of individual gas meters beginning in the 
second half of 1992. In accordance with the plan worked out by 
the Ministry of Machine-Building, the gas meters will be 
produced by six enterprises in Ukraine: the OKTAVA and 
KYYIVPRYLAD production associations (both in Kiev), the 
PROMPRYLAD Producation Association (Ivano-Frankivsk), the 
Zhulyany Machine-Building Plant (Kiev Oblast), the ARKSI Concern 
in Boyarka, and the joint venture formed by the MUKACHEVPRYLAD 
leased enterprise and the Slovak PREMAGAZ enterprise 
(Zakarpattya Oblast). The volumes of the planned series 
production of gas meters are indicated in the table [table not 
reproduced]. 
  UKRHAZ acquired several types of meters abroad, and these 
will also be installed in Ukraine. The cost of these meters has 
so far not been announced. According to Ivan Kolesnyk, the 
deputy chairman of UKRHAZ, 120 meters of the RL-20 type have 
already been tested in nine Western Ukrainian oblasts. This type 
of meter is designed primarily for use in small municipal and 
everyday services enterprises and farms. The advantage of these 
meters is that all their component parts can be produced from 
materials that are manufactured in Ukraine. 
  A portion of the meters has already been produced by the 
OKTAVA Production Association. However, this association ran 
into difficulties at the end of 1992 because of a lack of 
component parts. We should note that in 1991, OKTAVA was granted 
the licensed equipment of the French firm SHLUMBERGER INDUSTRY 
valued at $3 million dollars. In order to set up normal 
production, OKTAVA also needed funds for mechanical assembling 
and for the training of Ukrainian specialists. Following 
negotiations between UKRHAZ and representatives of the French 
firm, agreement was reached that the OKTAVA Production 
Association would compensate the outlays of its foreign partners 
with finished products and certain components. As indicated 
above, OKTAVA has already completed the first batch of meters. 
By the end of 1994, production is to reach 50,000 units for the 
year. The enterprise's total annual projected output is 150,000 
meters. 
  Incidentally, experts feel that Ukraine has rather good 
technologies for manufacturing the diaphragms required in the 
production of household gas meters -- precisely what OKTAVA 
lacked. This technology has already been developed by the Kiev 
branch of the Scientific-Research Institute of Polymer Fibers 
and one other plant. 
  According to UKRHAZ estimates, Ukraine's enterprises will 
not 
supply the required initial volume of household meters until 
1997. An incentives system is currently being developed to boost 
the installation of meters by Ukraine's population. A household 
gas meter is expected to cost $25. This price was set taking 
into account the recommendations of a group of experts from the 
World Bank. 
  UKRHAZ experts believe that given the world rates for the 
price of gas ($55-$80 per 1,000 cubic meters of gas), gas 
consumers will be interested in obtaining meters in the shortest 
possible time, inasmuch as today's rates are based on the 
average conventional per capita consumption of gas (1,000 cubic 
meters) -- a figure that is virtually conventional. The fact is 
that gas meter owners are already paying only 45 karbovantsi for 
one cubic meter of gas, rather than the 90 karbovantsi paid by 
the rest of the population of Ukraine.

<F P=106> [Unattributed article, under the rubric "Business": "The </F>
Cabinet of Ministers of Ukraine Has Again Liberalized Investment 
Conditions. But For How Long?"] 
  [Text] As we know, a few years ago, Ukraine's legislative 
base for investment was the most liberal in the whole CIS. But 
investors did not have the opportunity to rejoice for long: a 
series of government decrees and directives virtually nullified 
the laws passed by the Supreme Council, as a result of which the 
investment climate in Ukraine became intolerable. It seems that 
the government has now realized that investments are a necessary 
thing. Thus, there was recent approval for the "State Program To 
Encourage Foreign Investment in Ukraine," which so far has 
produced no impressive results, even though it came into force 
on 1 March 1994. Specialists believe that the program will begin 
to function in a real way after 1 April -- that is, when the 
benefits to investors that the program provides come into force. 
  Thus, as of 1 April of this year, foreign investors will 
enjoy the following benefits: 
  1. Accelerated rates of depreciation on machiney and 
equipment. 
  2. Exemption from profits tax for a period that will depend 
on the size of the foreign investment: for investments up to and 
including $500,000 --one year; for investments above $500,000 
and up to and including $5 million -- two years; for investments 
above $5 million and up to and including $50 million -- three 
years; for investments above $50 million --five years. 
  3. Tax credits on preferential terms on taxes that are 
subject to payment during the first three years of operation of 
enterprises with foreign investments. 
  4. A refund of 50% of the import duties paid on 
producer 
goods brought in from abroad and 100% of the duty paid on 
imported parts, accessories, and machine units for joint 
projects upon submission of evidence that these were used by an 
enterprise with foreign investment in its own production. This 
benefit is in effect for five years from the moment that the 
International Cooperation and Investment Agency approves the 
foreign investment project. 
  5. Credits on preferential terms granted by authorized banks 
from a special budget fund created for this purpose on the basis 
of a credit agreement, which must also be approved by the 
International Cooperation and Investment Agency and the Ministry 
of Finance of Ukraine. 
  6. Insurance for investment risks from a special budget fund 
for insurance guarantees. 
  Observers believe that even with the existence of such 
benefits, there will be no flood of investments into Ukraine. No 
investor is going to bring his millions to Ukraine only to read 
in the newspaper some time later that these benefits have been 
abolished because of a decision to implement measures to 
stabilize the Ukrainian karbovanets or some other such 
eventuality. The government of Ukraine has already earned the 
reputation of being the most inscrutable government in Europe. 
For that reason, such guarantees can only be given by the 
president, and he has not yet said how long these benefits will 
remain irrevocable.

<F P=106> [Article by V. Landyk, vice premier of Ukraine: "The Market </F>
Is Where the Goods Are"] 
  [Text] Valentyn Landyk, 45, a native of Donetsk 
Oblast, graduate of the Kramatorsk Industrial Institute. He then 
served in the army in the Leningrad Military District. Later he 
worked at the Artemovo Pobeda Truda Machine-Building Plant 
(mining machinery). He also advanced from line to shop foreman 
and became secretary of the party committee. In 1985 he was 
invited to Donetsk to "revive" the food industry 
machine-building plant there. He accomplished that, then he 
revived the Donbass Refrigeration Plant and became the general 
director of Elektrobytmash Association of the USSR Ministry of 
the Defense Industry. He created the Nord joint-stock company. 
Since June 1993 he has been vice premier of the government of 
Ukraine. 
<H5>  On the Work of the Government </H5>
  In October I presented my plan for resolution of the crisis 
to the Cabinet in which the principal emphasis was made on 
regional self-administration, i.e. on the transfer of full 
authority to oblasts. The proposals were approved by the 
president. It was agreed to differentiate four oblasts (as kind 
of "special self-administered regions") on an experimental 
basis--the Donetsk, Zaporozhye, Lugansk, and Dnepropetrovsk 
oblasts. Even though it took a lot of work, it was possible to 
compile a list of enterprises--priority consumers of energy in 
the most important branches, for the purpose of regulating the 
consumption and conservation of energy resources. Today there 
are 70 such enterprises in Ukraine. The structural 
reorganization of the economy is actually starting with them. 
For instance, we have already reviewed the traditional approach 
to the requirements for aluminum. Formerly aluminum ingots from 
Russia were rolled involving great expenditures on 
transportation and energy, whereas in the future we will produce 
finished aluminum sheets and foil on our own using Italian 
technology. For decades we were creating a powerful chemical 
industry and still received half-a-billion rubles annually for 
the purchase of pesticides. Today the chemists have been 
assigned the task of creating the independent output of these 
products. 
  We are not straining in an attempt to bring the economy up 
to 
the level of the former Union. The essence lies in something 
else--a movement away from the scale and the framework of the 
former Union economy. Whatever can be and should be produced 
with lower expenditures in Ukraine, must be produced. Products 
that are not among the priorities or which do not lend 
themselves to independent production must be purchased--in 
Russia, in Kazakhstan, in Uzbekistan, in the West, that is it. 
  Work in priority directions in the economy is supported, and 
this is highly important, by the law on investments, an 
inalienable part of which is a list of subjects deserving 
primary governmental attention. That law will work regardless of 
whether the current Council of Ministers and I, as the vice 
premier, continue functioning. We initiated a systemic approach 
to issues of economic reform. 
  On relations with Russia. 
  I have never been one of those favoring a break in ties with 
Russia. Even before entering the Cabinet I always said (and the 
press loved to quote this) that I never shrugged off Russia and 
do not advise anyone else to do that either. I am prepared to 
repeat that once again for those who do not understand it: to us 
Russia is a market for Ukrainian goods (and, probably the other 
way around as well). A failure to comprehend this on both sides 
leads to mutual losses. In Moscow they undoubtedly are feeling 
that on the food market. By the way, we also intend to defend 
ourselves against intervention in our food supply by means of 
customs tariffs: a bottle of American Smirnov vodka used to cost 
40,000 coupons and will now cost 600,000 coupons. 
  I personally had occasion to participate directly in the 
elaboration of the treaty on cooperation among independent 
states in a package which included 35 other agreements. In the 
end we shall join a customs union and a payments union. I can 
say right now with full confidence that Ukraine will sign on 16 
April not as an associate member, but as a CIS member. The mood 
of the president himself convinces me of that as well. 
<H5>  On Privatization </H5>
  For the president that is of the utmost importance. 
President 
Kravchuk, by the way, intends to evaluate our work according to 
the level of privatization. In 1995 it is planned to privatize 
20,000 out of 24,000 small enterprises along with 8,000 out of 
40,000 medium and large enterprises. The course of the 
administration toward liberalization and privatization will be 
unalterable. 
  I am personally closely familiar with work on privatization 
because I have worked through all the stages of issuing stock 
myself. At Donetsk, as their long-time director, I guided large 
enterprises for the production of Nord refrigerators through 
those stages. At the plant with a work force of around 19,000 
there is no state property, only collective property. I own five 
percent of Nord. It is true, I do not feel that yet, but my 
children, I hope, will benefit from this. 
  Every week we hold conferences with directors on 
privatization. Just as in Russia, of course, we are advised by 
the World Monetary Fund, the International Financial 
Corporation, the EBRR [European Bank for Reconstruction and 
Development], as well as by other Western institutions. However, 
I would not draw any parallels with the Russian 
Goskomimushchestvo [State Committee for the Administration of 
State Property]. 
<H5>  On a Purposeful Policy </H5>
  A drop in gasoline prices in Ukraine came as a surprise for 
many. To the administration, however, that constituted proof of 
the correctness of the course designed to restrain spontaneous 
elements of the market. The stock exchange was eliminated, and a 
fixed karbovanets exchange rate was introduced while the 
"freedoms" of brokers and middlemen were restricted. We placed 
them under very rigid control. If you want to import--do it 
through the committee on petroleum and gas and sell with its 
permission. A highly important role was played by avoidance of a 
monetary emission during the December - February period, which, 
according to the sellers of gasoline, was to have been followed 
by a price explosion. In anticipation of that event fuel owners 
painstakingly created a shortage of it. But... In that situation 
it was specifically the market which nevertheless compelled them 
to lower prices. 
  If one is to be quite frank, there is no real market in 
Ukraine and Russia. That is there is no goods market, but there 
is a money market. The commodity market is yet to be created. 
  It is also necessary to alter the psychology of the producer 
and the seller. The drive and, what is most important, the wish 
to receive not a five or ten percent profit, but profit three 
and even five times higher, are amazing. It gets to the point 
where the goods and finished products are allowed to rot, while 
at the same time the government is solicited for subsidies and 
foreign currency. In such cases I recommend: move, go abroad, if 
you cannot do so, trade in Ukraine, but... lower the prices. I 
believe that in the very near future this will happen with 
prices for meat which is available here in adequate quantities. 
<H5>  On Stabilization </H5>
  We stabilized the situation somewhat in the Ukrainian 
economy. Not a single emission ruble has been released from 
December until today and accounts with Russia for petroleum and 
gas are finally being settled. Up to that time there were 
discussions, tears, and begging--there were no payments. Today 
the payments are coming. A new decree is being prepared 
concerning currency regulation for the purpose of eventually 
shifting to a single exchange rate. The order of mandatory sale 
of foreign currency proceeds of enterprises will be changed. 
  Strictly speaking we did not "close down" the stock market. 
Today it simply operates with the Committee for Clearing 
Operations (or the tender committee), which sells currency only 
for whatever is needed in Ukraine, on the basis of special 
purpose programs. 
  There are not problems either with the Ministry of Finance 
or 
the National Bank. My viewpoint is as follows: the chief 
bookkeeper must not command the plant. In other words the bank 
must be subordinated to the president. 
  There was some talk about our hryvnya. Technically we are 
prepared to print it. I cannot name a date yet, but I will say, 
that it will be a week from Thursday.

<F P=106> [Interview with Vladimir Demyanov, vice premier; place and </F>
date not given: "There Is No Famine, Nor Is It Anticipated"] 
  [Text] The vice premier handling agricultural 
affairs, Vladimir Demyanov, recently celebrated his 50th 
birthday. Jokingly he said that working for the government he 
feels himself much wiser. His hair became grayer and he lost 
some weight. No matter, he will set things right and promises to 
create ten years of progress. He was born in Khmelnitsk Oblast, 
to a peasant family. After school and a technikum he worked for 
three years at the Twice Hero of Socialist Labor Grigoryy 
Tkachuk Farm, and learned from that experience. He graduated 
from the Kharkov Veterinary Institute and served in the army. 
Then in Zaporozhye he started accumulating years of independent 
economic activity: chief veterinarian, kolkhoz deputy chairman, 
and chairman. Later, party schooling as first secretary of the 
rayon committee for many years. He was invited by Pelsha to 
Moscow, for work at the KPK [Committee of Party Control]. He 
refused. People pointed their fingers at him saying that only an 
abnormal person would turn down an apartment in Moscow. 
Subsequently he was elected chairman of the Zaporozhye Oblast 
Executive Committee. Without connections, without bribes, using 
only his own head and through his determination he managed in 
one of the largest industrial oblasts of Ukraine. Later he 
worked for a year as representative of the president. In October 
1992 he became vice premier. He speaks of that time as follows: 
"I was really a lucky man! I had just arrived when there were 
two years of drought and I was told to buy five million tonnes 
of grain wherever I want, including in America. I went there and 
was told: the Union has been destroyed--you must resolve the 
problems on your own. My wife told me: don't complain, our time 
will come and, indeed, our situation slowly started to improve." 
  [Question] Vladimir Vasilyevich, is it true that prices for 
agricultural products in Ukraine, by contrast with those for 
others, have gone up over the past months by just one percent? 
How did you manage that under conditions of such a tremendous 
rise in the cost of living? 
  [Answer] We stopped trading on the stock market, regulated 
the money rate. By the way, the same course is now being 
followed by the government of Belarus as well. Our economy was, 
of course, seriously undermined by fuel prices, which led to a 
rise in prices for all agricultural products. Through the 
regulation of procurement prices, however, we managed to 
accomplish something. We calculated procurement prices for grain 
of the new harvest in the following manner: we divided 1,290,000 
coupons by the new exchange rate of 12.6 and obtained 90 
dollars. That is the world price for grain. 
  We use the same rate in settling accounts for fuel and 
fertilizers. That served to calm down the peasants somewhat, 
convinced them that there would be no sharp rise in prices for 
industrial products and that it is possible to work without 
worrying. 
  [Question] What are the results of the last agricultural 
year? What was it possible to attain with state price regulation? 
  [Answer] Liberalization of prices, just as their regulation, 
equally leads to a decline in production. Under our conditions, 
however, the latter proved to be beneficial. We managed to 
convince the peasant that his labor is not wasted and he reaped 
a grain harvest eight million tonnes greater than in 1992. At 
the same time, we are now recording only cleaned high-grade 
grain. 
  The distribution of land helped. At present 5.6 million 
hectares of arable land are privately owned. Cereal crops in the 
public sector shrunk by a million hectares. That is all right. 
We did not purchase grain on the side like other foodstuffs . 
Moreover the private sector yielded 40 percent of all 
agricultural products in gross terms, diminishing the load on 
kolkhozes and sovkhozes. 
  For the first time we gathered the entire sugar beet harvest 
in just one month whereas previously that operation took three 
months. This was done despite the fact that there was a shortage 
of fuel. Despite the overall decrease in cattle stock over the 
past two years, we managed to increase it by 200,000 head. Take 
a look for yourself: all 30 trains departing Kiev are filled 
with foodstuffs. 
  In the newspapers, however, one reads that if the Ukrainian 
does not starve to death in the morning, he will certainly be 
doing so in the evening. 
  [Question] Do you feel any product intervention by western 
suppliers, particularly with regard to sugar as well as liquor 
and spirits? 
  [Answer] I just read in IZVESTIYA that the Russian 
government 
raised customs duties on imported products by 15 - 20 percent 
and that this is prompting a price explosion. We are also doing 
this and will continue doing so in order to protect our 
producer, even though his products today are more expensive than 
the imported ones. At the same time, however, we are trying to 
support the monopoly on sale and purchase of agricultural 
products within the state. A package of legislative documents 
has been worked out allowing the peasant to sell his harvest in 
any way profitable to him. Our trade has been semi-privatized, 
and the director of a meat combine today does not stay in his 
office but searches for the best partner for himself in the 
countryside. 
  The Barnaul meeting of representatives of CIS countries is 
coming up on the protection of agricultural products from 
foreign commodity intervention, and I want to discuss that issue 
once more with V. Zaveryukha, vice premier of Russia. We must 
know how to protect ourselves. No one is waiting for us on the 
western market, all the markets there have already been divided 
up. 
  [Question] You have probably heard about the war taking 
place 
between Moscow and Moscow Oblast in the area of food 
procurement. The mayor of Moscow uses foreign currency credit to 
purchase cheaper, but perhaps lower quality products abroad, 
while farms in the oblast are compelled to ship their products 
either to Siberia or the Far East or bury them in the ground. 
  [Answer] God protect us from the conduct of such a policy. 
Our butter, meat, and sausage are of better quality than the 
foreign products and why should we undermine the roots of our 
public and private sectors. We now created a state procurement 
order which is 10 percent of the previous one. The remainder 
will be planned by them on their own. But this is due to our 
poverty. Agriculture is subsidized, mentored, and regulated 
throughout the world. In the former GDR only 30 percent of the 
collective farms disintegrated. The remaining 70 percent are 
alive and thriving. Their production is much cheaper than that 
of farmers in the former FRG. 
  Wheat is sold to the American farmer for 120 dollars and 
bought for 245. The government at present has no money. What is 
the solution? We are liberalizing prices. But that is better 
than cheating the peasants by telling them that we will pay and 
then giving them nothing in return. 
  We are not aspiring toward a revolution in agriculture but 
are proceeding along the evolutionary path, with caution, so as 
not to destroy its basis. In the future, if we provide our 
worker with agricultural equipment of the highest quality, along 
with means to protect the harvest and are able to subsidize our 
kolkhoz members and farmers, like the Americans, then life will 
be much better. 
  [Question] What tasks are you planning on resolving in the 
new agricultural year? 
  [Answer] In the last two years we have had to alter the 
mechanism of mutual economic relations between the state and the 
farms every month. It would be so desirable to create a 
situation where visiting the peasants one would be told: finally 
the government did not cheat us. This year we invested 20 
trillion karbovantsy in the state procurement order for grain, 
sugar beets, potatoes, and sunflower seeds alone. The remainder 
will be placed under complete control of the producers of the 
goods themselves. Nevertheless the problem remains. I see the 
struggle among various forces taking place both in Russia and in 
our own case. The most "fearsome" individual is the one who 
insists on the fulfillment of his obligations. Last year I did 
everything possible in order to purchase all the grain from the 
villages, that, of course, increased prices, but we do have 
grain, it did not rot in pits. This year the bankers have got us 
by the throat. We, however, have established the following 
course--we purchase currency in the bidding committee, dollars 
at the state price, purchase oil, fuel, and fertilizers and 
supply them to the farms, converting everything to world prices. 
In the fall they will return products to us at the same world 
price. This is a non-monetary form of commodity turnover. But 
that is a solution only for today. 
  Probably for the first time we are confronted by the 
full-blown problem of not where to buy, but how to buy from the 
capitalists and to whom we should sell our products. 
  The most important matter today is to finance the 30 percent 
of the products that the agricultural sector will provide for 
us. This is an extremely difficult problem but it cannot be 
avoided.

<F P=106> [Article by Melnychuk: "I Am Friendly With This Government"] </F>
  [Text] Melnychuk is a remarkable individual in many 
regards. He is dynamic, sociable, plain spoken, and immediately 
grasps the essence of a problem. It is possible to say about him 
that he is "everywhere." He is a member of the Standing 
Commission of the Supreme Council of Ukraine on Economic Reform, 
secretary of the Parliamentary Commission of Ukraine on 
Privatization Issues, and counselor acting as prime minister for 
social affairs. 
  This exceptional forty-year-old man graduated from a 
construction technical school, served in the army, studied with 
distinction at the Economic University, then did post-graduate 
work and defended a candidate's dissertation on the problem of 
the interaction of center and region with rational utilization 
of manpower. Working at the Labor Institute, he taught at the 
polytechnic institute, served as chief economist of the 
Machine-Building Plant and a deputy chairman of a commercial 
bank. In 1990 he was elected chairman of the Zhitomir City 
Council. After two years of work there he resigned because of, 
in his opinion, the artificiality of the institution of the 
"representative of the president." 
  He has always regarded collaboration with the 
government as his duty. Zvyagylskyy took note of him and asked 
for assistance. Melnychuk is one of the authors of the 
anticrisis program of the government. 
  Two basic methods exist for the reform of the economy of 
Ukraine: one is linked with the recent past, when the government 
lacked a clear goal and a concrete and effective program; the 
second method is based on the elaboration of a well thought-out 
strategy and the existence of a team prepared to carry it out. 
  That which is called in Russia as the first method, or 
"Ukrainization of the economy," found its full embodiment in the 
activity of Kuchma's government because of the total absence of 
a comprehensive approach to the resolution of fundamental 
economic problems. As an outcome macroeconomic results followed: 
in the social sphere--prices became twice as high as wages; in 
the financial sphere--emission increased by a factor of 17, 
while the Ukrainian karbovanets - U.S. dollar exchange rate 
dropped by a factor of 36. Why did that occur? Probably because 
problems of currency regulation were being resolved incorrectly. 
As a result the difference between the two currencies is the 
volume of the capital exported abroad. 
  In addition to that the former government of Leonid Kuchma, 
which had vast powers, with one of its decrees prohibited the 
export of products outside of Ukraine that are cultivated by 
peasants on their personal plots. This brought considerable 
losses to border farms which always sold their products to the 
neighbors. By the way, anti-Ukrainian moods of the Crimeans 
constitute their response to such thoughtless economic measures. 
After all, huge excise taxes were also established on the export 
of wine and champaign. 
  At present the second method is making its presence felt 
with 
great difficulty. Everything necessary exists in Ukraine in 
order to fulfill the strategic program worked out by a group of 
specialists and adopted for use. With regard to the per capita 
output of agricultural products Ukraine is in the top ten in the 
world. Its production potential is great. There are two reasons, 
however, hindering its development. 
  The former is connected with the old production structure 
because of which Ukraine is putting out the most energy, 
material, and petroleum-intensive products. Thus it turns out 
that the more it produces the more it owes. If the structure is 
not radically redesigned we will be unable to achieve anything 
of substance. 
  What is the solution? Development of profitable branches and 
profitable production in all branches, particularly the 
agro-industrial complex, machine-building, light industry, 
merchandizing, and material-technical supply. 
  It is likewise necessary to overcome one of the big 
misconceptions to the effect that Ukraine requires a vast amount 
of fuel and that it does not have any. With regard to the known 
fuel reserves we are in a first-place position in Europe. Today 
Ukraine is already satisfying two-thirds of its own petroleum 
needs, while one third is supplied by Russia and Turkmenia. But 
we are utilizing it in a highly irrational manner. As a result 
we consume as much petroleum as Japan, while our gross national 
product is more than ten times lower. We do not need such 
expenditures. 
  We must eliminate the crisis of nonpayment. All enterprises 
and farms are deeply in debt to each other. What is to be done? 
The matter must be resolved without an emission through a 
lowering of prices and an increase in funds that have to remain 
with the enterprises and the value-added tax should also be 
eliminated. 
  The next problem is associated with currency regulation and 
regulation of the Ukrainian karbovanets exchange rate. The 
government managed to lower inflation by controlling that 
process. In 1993 the average monthly inflation rate amounted to 
50 percent, and in January 1994 it was 19 percent, whereas in 
February it was down to 12 percent. The Interbank Currency 
Market artificially raised the exchange rate of the karbovanets 
by a factor of two to three. At present the government itself is 
setting it with consideration of the balance of payments and 
other factors. A similar policy is being implemented today in 
Austria, Sweden, and Poland. It has been used by the U.S.A., 
France, and Japan in times of crisis. 
  The government of Ukraine should continue further 
development 
of the privatization it started. Today 25 percent of industrial 
production is accounted for by the non-governmental sector which 
is functioning in a highly effective manner. 
  Integration with other CIS countries is a major problem. It 
is quite clear the strong can integrate but the weak will "be 
for hire." In order to restore links with them at a new level 
Ukraine will have to resolve the entire complex of tasks which I 
mentioned. But, as it is said, the road will be successfully 
negotiated by the one who forges ahead.

<F P=106> [Article by Pavel Yevdokimov: "Expect the Hryvnya To Come in </F>
on Thursday"] 
  [Text] In trading on the Interbank Currency Exchange 
in Moscow, the exchange rate of the ruble is slowly but surely 
approaching the 2,000 [rubles to the dollar] mark. According to 
available information, trading sessions will be suspended after 
the exchange rate goes beyond this mark. 
  Will this really happen? After all, as "people in the know" 
are telling us, Ukraine has merely replicated in a grotesque 
form the actions Russia took to stabilize the monetary and 
credit system. The Russian leadership has had time to assess all 
the drawbacks and advantages of this measure by turning to 
Ukrainian experience. However, we must say that the liberal 
press of Moscow has done everything in order to portray the 
policy of the Zvyahilskyy cabinet in the most negative light. 
  The Moscow press wrote on this account: "The memorable 
abolition of the rate of the karbovanets set on the exchange has 
ultimately robbed it of the attributes of a banknote." 
  On the eve of the election campaign, the issue of 
feasibility 
or unfeasibility of the regulated exchange rate was once again 
up for discussion, turning into a heavyweight argument in the 
battle for deputy seats. They embarked upon accusing the 
government of an administrative approach and encroachment on the 
principles of a market economy. However, the trouble was that 
contrary to gloomy predictions, the exchange rate of the 
karbovanets stabilized, becoming the main argument in the 
election battle. 
  Let us quote some numbers. On 31 December 1993, one dollar 
fetched 27,000 karbovantsy; a month later, this ratio did not 
change. By the end of the month, the exchange rate of the dollar 
went up somewhat and came to 30,200 karbovantsy. 
  The average monthly rate of inflation also testifies to the 
condition of the Ukrainian economy. Beginning at 50 percent last 
year, the Zvyahilskyy government succeeded in bringing it down 
to 19 percent in January and 12 percent in February. 
  This is how all of this has influenced common consumers. The 
cost of the minimum "basket" consisting of 22 consumer goods 
which are the most essential for living changed in the following 
manner: 4 January--412,000 karbovantsy, 3 February--426,000 
karbovantsy, and 3 March--432,000 karbovantsy. 
  It would be proper to recall how the current government 
started out. The conventional belief is that Kuchma resigned in 
the fall of last year. However, in essence only the formal act 
of surrendering the attributes of power occurred at that time. 
The introduction of a fixed exchange rate of the karbovanets in 
August amounted to the real resignation (do not confuse this 
with the suspension of trading sessions on the currency 
exchange). As a result of the action taken, the government 
acknowledged the bankruptcy of the policy it had pursued, and at 
the same time lost Mr. Pynzenyk, who considered it impossible to 
remain faithful to the ideals of economic romanticism in the 
midst of "Red directors" and other supporters of state 
regulation. 
  The decision of the Cabinet of Ministers and the National 
Bank to introduce a fixed exchange rate of the Ukrainian 
national currency brought about its record leap. From 5,970 
karbovantsy, the exchange rate plummeted to 19,050 karbovantsy 
to the ruble [as published], and the cost of the noncash ruble 
rose to 15 karbovantsy at the time. 
  Yet another sad record is associated with the activities of 
the Kuchma government: Ukraine came to rank second in the world 
in terms of inflation rate, overtaking such countries as Zaire 
and Somalia (Serbia ranks first). 
  In 1993 the emission of currency went up by a factor of 17, 
whereas the exchange rate of the karbovanets against the dollar 
fell by a factor of 36. How can this be? The answer is simple: 
The difference represents the volume of capital exported from 
Ukraine. This is what ill-conceived actions in the area of 
currency regulation and foreign economic activities have brought 
about. However, the statistics given do not reflect the whole 
picture because they fail to account of such a phenomenon as 
dollar inflation in Ukraine. Last year the exchange rate of the 
dollar fell by a factor of 2.77. If we put this indicator 
together with the index of a decline in the karbovanets, it will 
turn out that purchasing power of the national currency in real 
terms fell by a factor of approximately 47. 
  We should add that during 1992 and 1993 the National Bank 
extended large emission credit to the Kuchma-Pynzenyk government 
in order to subsidize industry, transportation, and agriculture. 
A considerable proportion of these subsidies were used to 
produce export products. In the process, exporters who sold 
products for freely convertible currencies drew additional 
income due to the decline in the exchange rate of the 
karbovanets and state subsidies, as well as due to exemption 
from payment of value-added and excise taxes. 
  It is not at all surprising that the fixed exchange rate 
failed to produce the desired result, but instead greatly 
discredited the very idea of state regulation in the area of 
monetary circulation in the eyes of the public. It would appear 
that most countries of the world, such as Austria, Sweden, 
Hungary, Finland, Poland, and others, which can hardly be 
suspected of being "nonmarket," use regulated exchange rates as 
the main instrument for financial stabilization. Both America 
and Japan have gone through this. 
  However, it is precisely the point that for Prime Minister 
Kuchma this was a forced measure, an act of desperation not 
bolstered by other undertakings. The absence of a comprehensive 
approach to solving economic problems was the main flaw in the 
activities of that Cabinet of Ministers. 
  Prime Minister Ye.L. Zvyahilskyy took office with this kind 
of inheritance. First off, the government embarked on currency 
regulation which was expert and justifiable under the current 
conditions; it is one of the most significant ways to achieve 
macroeconomic stabilization and a reduction in the rate of 
inflation. It was suggested that the interbank currency exchange 
take a "pause" because its operation facilitated the buildup of 
the inflationary spiral. 
  The government proceeded to take this measure, which was 
unpopular in banking circles because the exchange rate of the 
karbovanets against the dollar and the Russian ruble that was 
artificially understated on the exchange was not in line with 
the ratio of the real purchasing power of these currencies, 
since there were extremely few real transactions to sell 
currency. This had to do with the fact that transactions 
concluded came at best to just 5 percent of the entire currency 
turnover of the country. 
  Experts estimate that the exchange rates of the dollar and 
the Russian ruble were overstated by no less than a factor of 
2.5, which did tremendous damage to the economy of Ukraine. 
Therefore, a tender committee allocating currency for targeted 
uses in the interests of the entire economy of the country 
appeared instead of a monopolized group acting on the exchange 
in keeping with a preliminary agreement. A restructuring program 
appeared, which reduced the risk of the use of financial funds 
proceeding from the arbitrary motives of "comrades in the 
leadership." Two more reasons may be named among those that 
influenced the relative stabilization of the karbovanets: first, 
restrictions on intermediary surcharges, which resulted in a 
veritable economic war between the government and traders in 
"black gold," and, second, the containment of monetary emission. 
  However, the seriousness of the intentions of the 
Zvyahilskyy 
government and the deliberation of the steps taken by it can be 
verified soon. Russia has banned the use of foreign currency in 
settlements for transactions. This is when the test of strength 
for the karbovanets will be administered. 
  As far as the hryvnya is concerned.... Recently, I happened 
to ask Deputy Prime Minister Landik about its fate. His response 
was: "I promise you that this will be done on a Thursday. I 
cannot say precisely when, but definitely on a Thursday."

<F P=106> [Report from press conference held by Petro Miroshnykov, </F>
president of Inko Bank and member of the Bank Council of the 
Cabinet of Ministers of Ukraine, by Larysa Ostrolutska: "To Play 
a Role Inko Does Not Need To Create a Bankers' Party"] 
  [Text] Petro Miroshnykov, the president of the board 
of directors of the Inko Joint-Stock Bank (he is also the 
president of the Kiev Bank Union and a member of the Bank 
Council of the Cabinet of Ministers of Ukraine), held a press 
conference a few days before the election. Regardless of whether 
the timing of this press conference was dictated by some complex 
strategy or the result of pure chance, this dividing line 
between two political time zones (one would like to believe that 
there will be a change of direction in Ukraine) was truly an 
interesting moment in which to hear the opinion of someone who 
has crossed this boundary ahead of others. Especially as the 
advertised subject of the press conference was "Ukrainian Banks: 
The Basis of Economic Reform." 
  Here is Petro Miroshnykov: 
  First, about Inko Bank itself. Even though Western 
experts concluded that last year was the most difficult year for 
commercial banks since they have been in existence in Ukraine, 
Inko had a successful year. It has a balance of 2,249.5 billion 
karbovantsi and a profit amounting to 212 billion karbovantsi, 
or 17.8% of the profits earned by other commercial banks 
(this 
does not take into account the performance of the "big five" -- 
the former special state banks, three of which, Prominvestbank, 
Ahroprombank, and Ukrsotsbank, have also been designated as 
commercial banks). Inko has 66 branches (two outside Ukraine -- 
in Belarus and Armenia) and correspondent accounts in more than 
100 countries. And if, as the experts predict, only the 
strongest and most secure banks will survive this year, Inko is 
unquestionably among those in this group. 
  On the general economic situation. The principal 
cause of the deep systemic crisis is the power crisis. Until 
political guideposts are put in place and questions of ownership 
are defined, the present difficulties in the economy will 
continue. It is pointless to make predictions until we see who 
will be forming the government. One thing is clear: the reform 
process is now irreversible, and it is only a question of how 
effective these reforms will be. 
  On foreign investment. We have a sufficiently 
modern law on protecting foreign investments, but no foreign 
investments. Contrary to the government's belief that foreigners 
are practically lining up to invest their money. This is not the 
case. Nor will it be the case until political stability is 
achieved and there are political guarantees. Once things get 
going, investments will be virtually impossible without banks. 
These investments will be channeled through the banks, and they 
will be guaranteed and serviced by the banks. The fact that few 
banks can perform these functions is another matter. This is 
especially true of the entire pleiade of the so-called small 
banks and of the overwhelming majority of medium-sized banks, 
which are not up to the job. 
  Inko, other commercial banks, and the National Bank of 
Ukraine [NBU]. The Kiev Bank Union has had two 
consultations with V. Yushchenko, the head of the NBU, at which 
joint measures were outlined. To be sure, the NBU has other 
problems at the moment: monetary circulation, emission, 
switching to a national currency -- these things take up all of 
the NBU's time and effort, but we remain in contact with the 
NBU. If you recall, there was that ridiculous telegram from the 
NBU and the Ministry of Finance instructing enterprises to 
switch their accounts to their place of registry. This telegram 
was later "edited," and the Bank Union played a role in this. Of 
course, there are some conflicts in our relationship. But the 
Kiev Bank Council tries to solve them in a constructive manner. 
  Lobbying on behalf of banks. Some 212 commercial 
banks have been created in Ukraine. And three of them -- the 
former state banks Prominvestbank, Ahroprobank, and Ukrsotsbank 
-- control 87 percent of the bank market. Ukraine is alone in 
leaving this deformity of the banking system in place. In 
Russia, these banks were broken up into regional banks. 
Prominvestbank currently controls 60 percent of the bank market. 
We are all hostage to this bank, including the government, but 
it seems that the government does not understand this very well. 
  Consequently, it is unrealistic to talk about lobbying on 
behalf of banks at this time. We need to create a system of 
laws, and they should all be "written" by the same people so 
that they reflect a single ideology and not be in conflict with 
one another, as is the case today. We need to review existing 
laws and pass approximately another... 400 laws. 
  Emission. Last year, commercial banks were forced 
to issue credits for the sugar plan at the ridiculously low 
annual rate of 50 percent. We thought that such methods were 
being used as a last resort. But we were wrong. The same thing 
is happening this year. The principal issuer of preferential 
credits will be the Ahroprombank. I believe that in the end this 
bank will get the money from the government, which will take it 
from the National Bank. And the National Bank, in turn, will 
print the money. Because there is no such money in circulation. 
It does not even exist in kind. I see no other way out at this 
time. Yet, last year we recommended that the government buy only 
as much of the harvest as it needs for its programs. For the 
remainder of the yield there are exchanges. Those who know 
prerevolutionary history, know that the price of sugar was 
always set by the Kiev Sugar Exchange. 
  On the payments crisis, balances in the red, and forged 
money. A payments crisis has been raging in Ukraine for 
three months. According to some estimates, the sum in arrears is 
higher than the amount of money in circulation in the country. 
The banks, too, were affected by this crisis. In addition, the 
NBU has devised a grim penalty for those who have wound up in 
the red and is piling up fines upon fines. As a result of such 
"healing" measures, 11 banks have gone bankrupt. In three weeks, 
Inko lost 43 billion karbovantsi. The specialized banks --the 
same "big five" -- made no outside payments through most of 
December, confining themselves to circulating paper internally. 
Now the banks have gotten out of the red because emission is 
under way. We see this by our clients. 
  We were able to cope with forged bank remittances in short 
order because the National Bank was efficient in switching the 
commercial banks to electronic payments. Inko received its 
portion of forged remittances, but not directly -- we got them 
from Prominvestbank, which accepted them. 
  Are the banks pushing up inflation? Yes, but not 
the purely commercial banks. The specialized banks are doing 
this by disbursing cheap money and financing unprofitable 
enterprises. Obviously, they are not doing so of their own 
accord. The new commercial banks act as a counterbalance to 
them. But the forces are not equal. The Crimea and 
Inko. Inko's development policy in the Crimea is going to 
be cautious, although we plan to open two branches there. I 
regard the proposal to include the Crimea into the ruble zone as 
unrealistic: accounts can be settled in any currency, but there 
must be a single monetary unit in clearing operations. If there 
are two monetary units in circulation, one of them will simply 
leave this territory, as has happened before in the world. 
Implementing this proposal in spite of this fact will bring 
Crimea one step closer to secession from Ukraine. 
  Whom does he want to see in parliament? People 
with similar views, among whom he counts Hrynyov, Lanovyy, 
Filenko, and others. In full compliance with the election law, 
Inko did not finance anyone, Miroshnykov was not put forward as 
a candidate, and he has no intention of creating a bankers' 
party. He is satisfied to head the Bank Union. But a candidate 
does not live by money alone; he also need analyses, studies, 
expert opinions. 
  Yet (we remind you that this press conference was held 
before 
the election -- ed.) Miroshnykov does not share the optimism of 
some politicians and believes that there will be no second 
round, because... the election will be invalid. When this report 
is published, each of our readers will be able to judge this 
banker's prognosis for himself.

<F P=106> [Interview with Anatoliy Holubchenko, by N. Sorochynskyy; </F>
place and date not given: "If We Continue Living As We Are Now, 
We Will Not Survive Even for A Year"] 
  [Text] As long as I can remember we have always spoken 
about the equality of village and city. But that slogan, just as 
another one, equally popular in bygone times: overtake and 
surpass America, remained merely a slogan. We never overtook 
America and the city and village is a misalliance just as 
before. That difference has become particularly perceptible 
today when all the painful sides of our life showed up as if on 
a piece of litmus paper. The village appears to be particularly 
unequal compared to the city at the present time. Even though, 
to be truthful, the latter is also experiencing difficult times. 
  Enough about facts, however. As they say, whoever does not 
want to work is seeking a reason, whereas those who want work 
seek a possibility. Many economists in Ukraine and abroad formed 
an opinion of Anatoliy Holubchenko, the minister of industry, as 
a politician and a member of the government who is looking for 
ways to resolve the crisis in a branch that recently made-up 38 
percent of the total industrial potential of the former USSR and 
currently finds itself in a very difficult position. At the same 
time the level of development of industry in many ways 
determines how fast and how successfully our agriculture can get 
up off its knees, how it will occupy an equal place next to 
industry and gradually, step by step, transform Ukraine into a 
powerful agroindustrial European nation. 
  Today's conversation of journalist Nikolay Sorochynskyy with 
Anatoliy Holubchenko deals with the possibilities of an equal 
partnership between the village and the city, agriculture and 
industry. 
  [Sorochynskyy] Anatoliy Konstantinovich, no matter how much 
we talk about price parity, one thing is indisputable: today's 
prices for industrial products are much higher than those for 
agricultural products. How is it possible to achieve the desired 
parity? 
  [Holubchenko] Speaking about parity, according to data of 
the 
Agroindustrial Bank, in 1993 prices for agricultural products 
rose by a factor of 36, while material resources utilized in the 
production of those goods increased by a factor of 92. That is, 
prices for agricultural products lagged behind by a factor of 
2.5. That is felt in everything and a logical conclusion comes 
to mind: presently it is necessary to take steps in order to 
bring prices for agricultural products and for material 
resources into correspondence. If we have firmly decided that it 
is necessary to preserve prices for agricultural products, we 
must also firmly decide that they must be subsidized. For 
example, if a kilogram of meat costs 10 dollars on the world 
market, meat should cost the equivalent in our case as well. But 
it turns out that our meat combines receive meat at 15,000 
karbovantsy per kilogram while at the exchange rate of 12,600 
karbovantsy to the dollar, meat should cost 126,000 karbovantsy. 
The same applies to milk, bread, etc. In the world there are 
certain proportions in the exchange of goods. In essence, those 
proportions determine the monetary equivalent. In our case, 
however, the proportions have been violated and definitely not 
in favor of the village. 
  That is why it is now so difficult for the kolkhozes: there 
is nothing to spend on mineral fertilizers, construction has 
been practically halted, and many facilities in the social 
sphere are in a decrepit condition. People are not going to 
visit the club I saw, for example, in Mikhaylovka of Chernigov 
Rayon in Zaporozhye, where the temperature indoors is lower than 
out on the street. I believe that the policy of the state with 
regard to the countryside is simply unfair. 
  [Sorochynskyy] What is your attitude toward kolkhozes as a 
form of collective management in the countryside? 
  [Holubchenko] As indicated by data 80 percent of the people 
today favor the collective form of management--kolkhozes and 
sovkhozes. But it is necessary to understand something else as 
well: private farming should not be rejected. We must combine 
all forms. Each one of them shall find its place and will 
survive. To change something unequivocally today is unrealistic 
and should never be done. Therefore it is necessary to build a 
basis on something that the people are accustomed to and what 
they want, while for innovations it is important to create 
conditions for normal existence, while supporting legislation 
not with words alone but through action. 
  [Sorochynskyy] The industrial branch has always been closely 
linked with agriculture: plants produced equipment for the 
countryside, along with mineral fertilizers, chemical pesticides 
and herbicides, etc. These are difficult times, however, not 
just for agriculture but for industry as well. Where do orders 
for the countryside stand in industrial plans? 
  [Holubchenko] For as long as I have worked in industry in 
executive positions--from deputy foreman to minister, we have 
always flagged agriculture. That flag was always red. At all 
times. Meaning that it had to be prioritized. Regardless of the 
level of production, 100 percent fulfillment of orders for the 
village. 
  I feel that way especially strongly today. After all, 
branches of the Ministry of Industry are inseparably linked with 
the village. For instance, metal is needed for the production of 
machines which we provide and we also know precisely that such 
metal is needed specifically for agricultural machinery. Its 
shape and amount for each machine is indicated for every plant. 
We also produce all rubber parts for agricultural machinery. All 
types of fertilizers are made by us as well. We conduct joint 
consultations with agricultural workers along with monthly 
conferences on the fulfillment of orders coming from the 
countryside at the Ministry of Industry: for tires, fertilizers, 
and herbicides. In other words with regard to everything that 
must today be delivered for the countryside, and we deliver it. 
In March, for instance, the branch headed by me produced planned 
mineral fertilizers on schedule worth some 500 billion 
karbovantsy. At the end of March fulfillment of the April 
assignment was started. 
  I believe that the countryside must receive priority 
attention and, as in former times, perhaps to someone's dislike, 
red flagged. That is, orders for agriculture must be filled with 
any level of production that exists. It is necessary not to 
reject what was good before even if it was in a system which 
does not appeal to all right now in part because of the priority 
of the countryside. 
  [Sorochynskyy] The harvest is now under way. It is for good 
reason that the people say you will reap what you sow. You have 
just returned from the agricultural regions of Zaporozhye. What 
are your predictions? Will Ukraine have bread this year? Are we 
threatened by famine? 
  [Holubchenko] I met many grain growers, cattle farmers, 
heads 
of sovkhozes, and deputies of rural soviets and must say that 
with all of the complications they are facing, with the problems 
and their standard of living, the attitude they have toward 
labor and the way in which they understand that they are feeding 
all of the people--we will have no famine. That is 
unquestionable. These people, I would say, perform feats every 
day. But they do not elevate this to the level of a feat. They 
understand the work that must be done as normal daily tasks. 
They arise at four in the morning and race to milk the cows, 
then return home in order to milk their own cows and feed the 
livestock. Then they hasten back to work. They are also training 
their children to handle this work. 
  [Sorochynskyy] Anatoliy Konstantinovich, I know that you 
yourself also come from a labor dynasty. 
  [Holubchenko] Yes, I come from a dynasty of metallurgists. 
In 
his younger years my father worked as steel-maker's apprentice 
in an open-hearth shop of the Mariupol Metallurgical Combine, 
and after the war he worked as a brigade leader in a 
rolling-mill department until he retired on pension. Except for 
one brother who is a doctor, two of my sisters and another 
brother have also worked and are now working at industrial 
enterprises. I myself began work as an apprentice roller in a 
rolling-mill department of the Mariupol Metallurgical Combine. I 
am particularly proud of the fact that our dynasty continues: my 
eldest son is graduating from the Zaporozhye Industrial 
Institute, while my daughter-in-law works at Zaporozhstal. It is 
good when your children select the occupation of the father. 
That means you did not make a mistake in selecting a correct 
path. 
  It would be better if the efforts of those who are 
constantly 
attempting to frighten us with the prospects of famine could be 
directed at something else: creation of improved working 
conditions in the countryside, achievement of an upturn in 
industry, the resolution of domestic and external problems of 
the country, and at making certain that we finally stop 
complaining about all kinds of difficulties and start working. 
  [Sorochynskyy] The question of Ukraine joining the economic 
union of CIS countries with the rights of a full and not an 
associate member, has come up once again. It was a topic of 
discussion at the latest session of the Cabinet of Ministers as 
well. What are your views regarding the economic union? 
  [Holubchenko] We will come to that anyway. We are not ready 
yet, but we will be. A majority in east Ukraine favors full 
membership in the economic union of CIS countries. In west 
Ukraine, however, there are other opinions. It would be good to 
find a golden center such as a sensible compromise in that 
sphere. 
  We have no other way out. CIS countries are our principal 
markets. Another 10 - 15 years will be required at the very 
least for structural reorganization and integration. But if we 
continue living as we are now we will not survive even for a 
year. It is already clear where we are headed. 
  It is necessary to simply understand the objective realities 
and not depict wishes as actuality as this will result in a 
fiasco in addition to harming others. 
  Therefore the question as to whether to join the economic 
union must be studied intelligently. No one, however, will be 
able to simply walk away from that problem. No matter what kind 
of parliament and government there are, and no matter how much 
we elevate this issue--higher of lower, we will still have to 
resolve that question.

<F P=106> [Article by Nikolay Mokrishchev under the rubric "The Near </F>
Abroad: Ukraine": "Our Own Gas Is Under Our Noses"] 
  [Text] Ukraine is suffocating without natural gas. The 
country itself extracts 15-17 billion cubic meters. But it needs 
four times that. And the pressure in the gas lines from the near 
abroad is falling. Prices for blue fuel are already higher than 
world prices and continue to rise. 
  But that is only half the problem. It will become really bad 
when the Orenburg, Turkmen, and even the Siberian deposits dry 
up. And not for Ukraine alone. Such a prospect is not so far 
off. International experts predict that with the present level 
of consumption, there may be only 10-12 years of natural gas 
reserves left at best. And what then? 
  In our country, in such cases we begin feverishly looking 
for 
ways to solve the problem which has supposedly come about 
unexpectedly. This time, it is true, nontraditional sources of 
hydrocarbon raw materials and means of extracting them were 
recalled in good time. Beginning in 1988, three international 
scientific symposiums were held in St. Petersburg and Donetsk 
and were devoted to the topical problem which already disturbs 
not only scientists but most people who are a long ways from 
science. 
  The most promising substitute for traditional natural gas is 
coal gas. The very same methane which from time immemorial has 
been the enemy and killer of miners when there are sudden 
blow-outs and explosions. But it could become their best friend 
and put unprofitable and dangerous mines on their feet. 
  "Reserves of methane in coal mines are such that Ukraine 
could completely satisfy its gas needs for about 12 years," said 
the chief of the laboratory of mining geology and comprehensive 
development of the interior under the Ukrglavgeologiya 
[Ukrainian Geology Administration] Association at Donetsk 
Technical University, Anatoliy Brizhanev. "And as a backup, 
there is enough of it to last a very long time." 
  So the Donbass is not only a coal deposit but the largest 
coal gas deposit. The most promising regions are the 
Donetsk-Makeyevka, Chistyakovo-Snezhnoye, Krasnodon, and 
Almaznaya-Maryevka regions. The mines with the most methane and 
the most densely populated territories and hundreds of large 
industrial enterprises which need enormous amounts of gas are 
located here. But it is extracted from mine degasification 
systems in very small quantities for heating administrative and 
residential areas. We are not even close to industrial or 
commercial extraction. 
  But a start has been made, although it is a modest one. At 
the Torez Mine Administration, the building of one of the mines, 
two residential buildings, and a greenhouse have been heated 
with their own gas for many years. And not from the 
degasification systems, but from mine layers worked through 
vertical shafts. 
  The Donetsk Mine imeni Zasyadko has experience in fueling 
motor vehicles with coal gas. 
  Experiments on preliminary degasification of layers from the 
surface have been conducted for more than 25 years at other 
Donetsk and Makeyevka mines under the "patronage" of the Moscow 
Mining Institute. 
  Alas, even now in the face of a gas crisis, the extraction 
of 
methane remains on the same symbolic level in our country. But 
"they," the United States, Canada, and other Western countries, 
have taken advantage of our Soviet ideas and in record short 
time developed industrial extraction of gas from coal beds. 
  In the United States, for example, 40 universities and firms 
began working in 1987 to carry out a generously subsidized state 
program. They most likely assumed a "capitalist obligation," and 
in 1991 fortunate California had already obtained 5 billion 
cubic meters of gas from the San Juan coal deposit alone. In 
light of that, the extraction of coal from beds that have first 
been degassed from the surface increases by one and 
one-half-fold and the prime cost of extraction is reduced by 30 
percent. The brainstorm related to the underground deposits 
continues. There are already 84 universities and firms working 
on the coal gas program. By the year 2000, it will reach 60 
billion cubic meters of gas. Enough for the whole of Ukraine. 
  I have in front of me an advertising prospectus. It presents 
the process of extracting methane in plain, intelligible 
language. 
  "In principle everything is very simple," Anatoliy 
Mikhaylovich continues, "a shaft well is drilled and water is 
pumped into it with compressed air under a pressure of hundreds 
of atmospheres. The bed is hydraulically fractured. Cracks form. 
The cracks must be kept open for the methane to drain along 
them. But gas does not pass through water. And if the water is 
pumped out, the mine pressure will close the cracks. Water, 
then, must be replaced with a material which will `eep' the bed 
fractured and at the same time let through all the gas." 
  That is the point where many years of domestic research 
stopped. Water is replaced by a solidifying foam. It must 
solidify at an exact time and place and in addition increase the 
release of the methane. That is the crux of the entire 
technology. There are no chemicals for this foam. Nor is there 
any high technological sophistication. The slightest mistake and 
the crack may "close off." 
  But we must get started! In the far abroad this was done 
long 
before a shortage of natural gas appeared in order to meet it 
with all weapons ready. In Ukraine the shortage appeared soon 
after independence was proclaimed. And even in other republics 
it was more or less clearly hinted. Even in gas-producing 
republics. And deliveries of gas from the countries of the Near 
East are unlikely to save the situation. 
  Back in 1991, specialists of a number of firms of the United 
States and Canada suggested creating joint ventures to extract 
gas in the Donbass on a commercial basis, under the condition 
that payment for expenditures was in metal and coal. But at that 
time there was no legislative basis for allocating parcels of 
land for drilling wells, and none has appeared yet. Nor has the 
appropriate infrastructure been built on the surface. So the 
initiative of the Western firms vanished in an instant. 
  And isn't it absurd that we are crying about the lack of 
what 
we ourselves have in abundance? Instead of rescuing Ukraine from 
the trouble, Donbass methane continues to kill and cripple 
people. And Kuzbass and Karaganda methane too, any methane which 
hides menacingly in the depths of the earth and is ready at any 
time to explode with indomitable force. 
  Is it at great depth? Are special equipment and enormous 
capital investments needed? That means efforts in Moscow, and in 
the Donbass, and in Kazakhstan, and in the Urals must be 
combined; the half-forgotten "Talmuds" of research on the 
problem of extracting coal gas must be gotten out and the work 
pulled ahead. It will not be an amorphous but a concrete 
scientific-technical alliance. For the sake of that, everyone 
should focus themselves and put in great effort and capital and 
the military-industrial complex enterprises with their mighty 
human, scientific, and technical potential should be involved. 
People say that some things are already being produced in 
Azerbaijan, and in Russia and Ukraine. In short, we cannot do 
without a serious interstate program. But we would have more 
than enough capital to realize the program in Ukraine, for 
example, but it continues to be squandered and stolen and escape 
abroad.

<F P=106> [Interview with Leonid Zheleznyak, Ukrainian Railway </F>
Director General, by Valentina Pysanska: "Full Steam 
Ahead--Toward an Accident"] 
  [Text] From HOLOS UKRAYINY Files 
  First Deputy Transport Minister, Ukrainian Railway 
Director General Leonid Zheleznyak is 52 years old. He was born 
in the Zhitomir region. He graduated from the Dnepropetrovsk 
rail transport institute with a diploma in railway process 
management. His career choice was not an accident, but followed 
a family tradition. 
  After graduating from the institute, he was sent to 
work as a dispatcher-on-duty at the Darnitsa station. The young 
specialist's professional skills and initiative did not go 
unnoticed. He rose to become a station chief, the head of the 
Kiev branch of the South-Western Railroad, deputy railway 
director and, when the State Rail Transport Administration was 
established, he became its first vice-president. 
  There is probably no other sector which reflects the 
economic crisis more quickly or fully than transport, especially 
rail transport. It is a barometer which very precisely measures 
the level of well-being and economic welfare in society. 
  Ukrainian Railway Director General Leonid Zheleznyak 
took part in a press conference held by Ukraine Transport 
Minister Orest Klymnush. He called the existing situation in 
rail transport catastrophic. 
  A HOLOS UKRAYINY correspondent asked Ukrainian Railways 
Director General Leonid Zheleznyak to explain how and why a 
sector once considered very stable found itself in a 
catastrophic situation, and, most important, what we are to 
expect in the near term as well as in a more distant future. 
  [Pysanska] Leonid Leonidovych, without idealizing the work 
of 
rail transport under socialism, it will probably be correct to 
say that initially there were none of the current problems. What 
is their cause? 
  [Zheleznyak] The transport system of the former Soviet Union 
functioned well because the economy did. I do not want to call 
it nostalgia, but as a specialist in railway management I never 
had to worry where I would get hard currency to purchase 
imported engines, spare parts and equipment, all of which was 
distributed centrally. 
  It may have been a bad thing. But regardless of whether it 
was good or bad, Ukraine received each year heat-powered and 
electric engines, locomotives and railroad cars worth 75 million 
hard currency rubles. My job was to distribute them properly in 
order to prevent breakdowns in the transport system. Remember 
the kind of trains that used to run to Moscow, Simferopol, 
Odessa and Lvov? 
  Of course, none of it happened by itself: there were 
difficulties and 17-hour work days, but all that work produced 
tangible results. 
  Today we work no less, but we are facing a catastrophic 
reduction in transport volumes. They have fallen by half from 
last year because there has been a decline in industry. 
  Here are some examples. At the Lvov transit terminal, which 
functions as a bridge between Eastern and Western Europe, we 
used to handle up to 1,000 cars of imported goods per day. 
Today, there are barely 200 cars of such goods. We had to close 
transit yards and cut experienced personnel. 
  Having left the Union and divided property--justly or 
not--the state made a fatal error: it broke up economic links 
which had been built over several decades. It was the beginning 
of a breakdown of a well-functioning transport system. 
  [Pysanska] But everything that belonged to us--six railroads 
and all the factories--remained our property. 
  [Zheleznyak] We quit the ruble zone without signing an 
inter-state banking agreement. This is why we have been unable 
to settle accounts with other countries. We have the factories, 
but demand for their output has gone down; output levels are 
declining by as much as 25 percent per year, and nobody buys 
freight cars any more (with the exception of tanker cars). 
Demand is falling even for the once-desirable output of the 
giant heat-powered engine builder, the Lugansk plant, because 
neither we nor other railroads have much to transport. 
Production has effectively been suspended. Yet, 30,000 highly 
skilled professionals used to work there. 
  This is why tens of thousands of freight cars run empty--and 
not only here in Ukraine: there is nothing to transport in them. 
The number of cars which need repairs is growing. But this is 
only the beginning. The tragedy will come later, when industry 
finally begins to recover while transport will continue to 
decline, for this is a special feature of this sector. As a 
result, output will not get where it is needed. 
  This is why we are currently trying to explain to the 
government of Ukraine, and our colleagues in other CIS states 
are trying to explain to their own governments, that if efforts 
are not made to stabilize rail transports now, then later, to 
remedy the situation, hundreds of billions of dollars will be 
required. 
  [Pysanska] What funds are being invested in rail transport 
today? 
  [Zheleznyak] You may not believe it: none. This has been the 
case for the past three years. We have not been maintaining 
equipment and this tactic is leading to disaster. We no longer 
properly repair tracks while stock constantly moves over them. 
One out of every six kilometers of track is in an unacceptable 
condition. Last year alone, we repaired 700 kilometers of track 
less than we had planned. Today, 35 million wooden ties should 
be replaced, but even one tenth cannot be done, since there is a 
shortage of timber. Nor can we purchase them, since ties cost 
$17 each. 
  [Pysanska] But could this situation not have been foreseen? 
As a specialist, we could have warned them, used arguments, 
persuaded, etc. 
  [Zheleznyak] But did anybody ask, did anybody listen? In our 
country, politicians manage the economy, and results turn out 
accordingly. Ukrainian Railway and transport ministry managers 
constantly inform the Cabinet of Ministers, the Supreme Council 
and the president, explaining that this kind of management will 
result in a breakdown of rail transport, which is already 
starting to happen. Today, no one can say that specialists did 
not report this fully. We are convinced that regardless of 
political changes economic links must not be destroyed. We 
carried out the decision by heads of states who had signed an 
agreement to divide freight cars. Accordingly, we won our 18.4 
percent share of the total, but as I have already said tens of 
thousands of them stand idle. 
  [Pysanska] How will it turn out? 
  [Zheleznyak] If we continue to work with current prices and 
tariffs, as well as under the existing system for setting them, 
which we have not yet been able to master, we are headed for an 
economic famine and will not be able to provide for our needs 
for oil products and electric power. The economy will 
effectively come to a halt. 
  Even though we do not support the policy of constant tariff 
increases, the other path, that of direct subsidies from the 
budget, has already been tried. We have proposed many times to 
set a profitability level for rail transport, which is how it is 
done elsewhere in the civilized world. This is where we see a 
solution. Because raising prices for freight transport quickly 
translates into higher costs of goods. Today, railways are 
losing K30 billion a day from their commercial activities. 
  [Pysanska] One often hears proposals to charge near-abroad 
countries when they transport their freight on Ukrainian 
railways. 
  [Zheleznyak] This is amateurish talk. No one and nowhere 
ever 
transports freight free of charge. We charge them in accordance 
with international rules and agreements. 
  [Pysanska] What is your opinion about customs controls on 
long-distance trains? 
  [Zheleznyak] I have no opinion about this shameful practice. 
Not even taking into account the humiliations which poor 
passengers are subjected to, it has also caused a worsening of 
service. It used to take 11 hours 50 minutes to get to Moscow, 
but now it takes 15 hours 30 minutes. What gauge to use to 
measure lost time, and who is to compensate passengers for it? 
  If our state has set up borders, let them be. But let us 
look 
at the civilized world. When traveling from one European country 
to another by train, the passenger gives his passport to the 
conductor at the start of the trip and gets it back at the end. 
Nobody unceremoniously breaks into his compartment in the middle 
of the night armed with a submachine gun, wakes up his kids and 
shakes out bags to make sure that an enemy would not get through. 
  There, among capitalists, if you buy something and want to 
transport it out of the country, at the border you can be 
reimbursed 12 percent of the purchase price for shipping it at 
your own expense, and they will thank you for it. We, on the 
other hand, are afraid that something would be exported. The 
government is trying to compensate for its inability to develop 
a pricing policy and manage the economy by humiliating 
passengers. 
  Every once in a while I get an order from a presidential 
representative demanding to stop a train for three hours to 
allow for a thorough search of passengers. As a character in a 
popular film says, I am embarrassed for the state and ashamed 
for the nation. 
  [Pysanska] What would you propose to do? 
  [Zheleznyak] Are you talking about the sector? It cannot be 
analyzed apart from the economy. We have submitted to the state 
a program to prevent a catastrophe that is awaiting us. We have 
a program, but no money. 
  What am I doing to change the situation? Everything in my 
power. I raise issues and do not fear to talk about unpleasant 
or unacceptable things. I am not even afraid to work in a sector 
which is moving full-speed toward an abyss--because I doubt that 
anyone could do more. 
  [Pysanska] You and other people who have worked--and worked 
well--on the railroad all your lives; are you not ashamed to 
feel helpless? 
  [Zheleznyak] I am ashamed that having destroyed a finely 
tuned transport system, one that used to function reliably, we 
not only did not create a better one but created nothing at all.

<F P=106> [Article by O. Pronina: "What Saburov Is Saying and Meshkov </F>
Is Writing"] 
  [Text] Rumors to the effect that the price of bread has 
doubled in Crimea is unfortunately not an April Fool's Day joke. 
Vice Premier Yevgeniy Saburov was forced to start his practical 
activities with that highly unpopular step--elimination of 
subsidies for most popular bakery products. He is categorically 
opposed to artificial restraints on prices for bread at any 
cost, which is what was practiced here, since he believes that 
this threatens the bread industry with complete stoppage and 
society with a social explosion. 
  "I am for sensible prices which make it possible to heal the 
sick economy," Ye. Saburov stressed at his first press 
conference. "We should not drive the disease inward. People must 
overcome their fear of reforms, unpopular measures and harsh but 
necessary steps." 
  In order to soften the April-first blow, in accordance with 
a 
decision of the government, individual payments for purchase of 
bread have been increased, primarily for families with many 
children and for low-income citizens, by 26,000 karbovantsy a 
month. According to data available for March there were 350,000 
such people in Crimea. That figure will probably go up in April. 
  As readers of PRAVDA UKRAINY probably know, more than 100 
industrial enterprises in the republic found themselves being 
threatened with closure and the dismissal of workers on a mass 
scale. The council of the union of entrepreneurs advised the 
Supreme Council of Crimea of that and demanded immediate 
convocation of an extraordinary session to adopt its own law on 
taxation and prevent such a compulsory measure which will bring 
concealed unemployment into the open forcing the budget of the 
republic into unavoidable bankruptcy. As commonly known 110,000 
persons, every seventh Crimean engaged in production, supported 
a lockout. 
  This blow as well will apparently have to be sustained by 
the 
government of Yevgeniy Saburov until a new Supreme Council is 
elected since the current one, completing its last few days, in 
accordance with the declaration of its chairman, has no 
intention of accepting the terms of the ultimatum. 
  In reply to the question as to what mechanism the government 
has, after all, for resolving the economic problems, Yevgeniy 
Saburov stated that an entire package of presidential decrees on 
tax policy, currency regulation, banking, and foreign economic 
ties is purportedly being readied, which will make it possible 
to halt the drop in production. According to the vice premier 
all of them are coordinated in general terms with the leadership 
of Ukraine and are not contrary to its interests. 
  By the way, the hope that the prime minister would bring a 
team of reformers with him did not materialize. Very few of 
those willing to exchange Moscow for Simferopol could be found. 
Saburov will therefore have to rely mainly on local cadres. 
  The content of a message sent by President of Crimea Yuriy 
Meshkov to the President of Ukraine Leonid Kravchuk pertaining 
to the shutdown of one of the lines supplying the peninsula with 
electric power and a cutback in the supply via two other lines, 
became known in journalistic circles. 
  The Ministry of Energy of Ukraine, it states, is demanding 
payment of the debt for delivery of electric power which amounts 
to 300 billion karbovantsy (eight million U.S. dollars) a third 
of which is the debt of the Ministry of Defense of Ukraine. This 
circumstance should be taken into primary account in resolving 
the question concerning delivery of electric energy. 
  The message also notes that in connection with this 
sanatoriums and resorts as well as establishments of the 
Ministry of Defense of Ukraine are being crippled, and the 
broadcast of UT-1 and UT-2 television programs will become 
impossible. 
  "Further developments in this complex situation depend on 
your practical actions," the president of Crimea underscores in 
his letter to the president of Ukraine.

<F P=106> [Interview with Ukrainian Economy Minister Roman Shpek by </F>
UKRINFORM correspondent Oleksiy Trotsenko; place and date not 
given: "Roman Shpek: `Economic Situation in Ukraine Is Complex 
and Dangerous, But Not Hopeless'" -- questions published in 
boldface] 
  [Text] 
  [Trotsenko] Roman Vasylovych, what should be done, in your 
opinion, to lead Ukraine out of the current complex situation? 
  [Shpek] Primarily, in my opinion, we should pay special 
attention to the owner. History has shown that a state is an 
inefficient owner. Thus, we should make all possible efforts to 
change the structure of ownership. 
  The issue of structural reconstruction of our economy is 
also 
very acute, as well as the change of forms of property: 
Enterprises, which are no longer needed for Ukraine in the 
present and in the future, should take their choice. No, this 
does not mean that they must be categorically closed. New 
owners, new people with their own capital will come, and they 
will be able to inspire them with new life and change their 
profile. Great hopes are set here on foreign investments, and 
everything must be done to create the possibility for the best 
conditions for such investors. 
  [Trotsenko] However, this requires social and political 
stability. 
  [Shpek] Undoubtedly. It is necessary to form a new 
parliament and government, which would have vast powers. I am 
not sure, however, that we will be able to improve our economic 
situation befor the first six months of this year. 
  We have to be more thoughtful while developing the future 
model of our economy. Here is one example: The coke-oven 
industry is currently not paying the coal industry, and miners 
are not paying power industry workers. What is the solution? 
In my opinion, we can unite them in an association. The 
Economy Ministry has already elaborated documents according to 
which we can establish financial- industrial groups. We should 
unite enterprises of the coal industry, thermal electric power 
plants, metallurgical plants, and machine-building plants that 
produce equipment for these branches, so that they do not 
increase prices for one another, but are led by common 
interests. Otherwise, we will not achieve anything. 
  We must be trusted abroad. Today, we are not, and this 
relates to Ukraine which owns a great portion of the world's 
blacklands. At the same time, the average milk yield per cow 
last year was 2,100 liters. How can butter and other diary 
products be cheaper today? Obviously, our production costs are 
higher than usual, and the results are well known. 
  Briefly, there are a great many problems. On the one hand, 
we will be unable to resist a flood of foreign goods, because 
our technologies are too poor; on the other hand, competition 
cannot exist without the liberalization of external economic 
relations, and without competition, our products will never 
enter world markets. It should be kept in mind, however, that 
the United States, Japan, and other developed Western countries 
also protect their producers. Today, we have to find out how to 
liberalize prices, improve the quality of our products, and 
reduce production costs. Prices will then be lower, more 
moderate. 
  [Trotsenko] Our trade deficit with Russia and other CIS 
countries is alarming. Can you see any ways to overcome it? 
What, in your opinion, should be done to achieve a trade 
surplus, or at least reach the zero mark? 
  [Shpek] It is true that we have a trade deficit with Russia. 
We should remember, however, that Ukraine was extracting 14.5 
tonnes of oil in the 1970's [as published]. Later, there was 
Tyumen with larger deposits, and Ukraine could buy oil and gas 
cheaper. Now, I emphasize, this has changed, since the Tyumen 
oil producers have increased their prices to the world level. 
Estimating that in Ukraine the yield of gas products in oil 
refining amounts to 57-58 percent, and in the West to 80 
percent, it is not hard to guess that we lose one out of every 
five tonnes of oil we purchase. The inefficiency of our 
economy, the inefficiency of our petrochemical enterprises, and 
intensive use of power have led to a situation when the demand 
for oil and gas does not decrease as sharply as production. 
Energy should be conserved considerably. We therefore 
submitted legislation on energy conservation to the Supreme 
Council, but it was not adopted. 
  As everybody knows, we are always compared with France, in 
terms of territory, population, and economic potential. But in 
France the use of power is five times lower than in Ukraine. 
This allows France to compete at world markets. We are still 
not able to do so. Here is another example: A Kharkiv plant has 
recently begun production of tractor engines. This tractor is 
20 kg heavier than other countries' models. Thus, more energy 
is used for smelting, and other processes also consume higher 
expenditures. Can we sell this tractor on international 
markets, where Western companies offer their better and 
environment friendlier products? Neither Bulgaria, nor 
Mongolia, nor Poland, nor the Czech Republic, nor Angola would 
buy such equipment. Moreover, there will be no demand for it in 
our country either. 
  We must be seriously engaged in the development of modern 
technologies and Ukraine's participation in conversion programs. 
This should be done wisely however. There are demands that the 
Pivdenmash company produce trolley buses. Everybody understands 
that we need such products. But, Pivdenmash is one of the best 
space industry plants. Perhaps it is useful to continue such 
production, since there is a great demand for space equipment 
all over the world. Therefore, during our recent visit to the 
United States, we discussed this issue with our American 
colleagues. It was fortunate that the issue was included in the 
agreement we signed there. The point is that Ukraine wants to, 
and will, participate in international space programs. We can 
earn hard currency on our intellectual potential. 
  We must constantly increase exports if we want our trade 
balance to reach the zero mark. I recall that the late Yustyn 
Todorovych Lychuk, a hero of socialist work, had the following 
slogan in his office: "Economy is rich not thanks to many 
purchases, but wise expenditures." We also should think about 
wise expenditures, because we cannot live on credit forever. 
  [Trotsenko] Why does a state, which produces great amounts 
of raw materials, on whose territory a third of the world's 
blacklands is located, and which has well-developed metallurgy, 
machine- building industry, and a great scientific-technical 
potential, have a foreign trade deficit? 
  [Shpek] I will reply in brief: Because of its low economic 
efficiency. You understand, even when we sell our products at 
world prices, they sometimes do not compensate our costs. 
Almost the entire agricultural production has losses, meaning 
that costs exceed profits. The same situation exists in the 
chemical industry. One must remember that not the producer and 
consumer, but the dealer and customer determine economic policy 
in a market economy. 
  [Trotsenko] Currently, there are many discussions concerning 
Ukraine's joining the CIS economic union. What will our state 
profit, by taking such a step? 
  [Shpek] A union means equality. I support equality, but if 
we join the economic union, and we obtain prices for oil and gas 
eight times higher than Russian consumers do, what kind of a 
union is that? We were discussing free trade with Russia. 
Russia, however, came forward with an amendment according to 
which free trade does not apply to oil, gas, lumber, and 
nonferrous metals. What kind of free trade is this? If it is 
supposed to be free, let it be free. If it is supposed to be a 
union, let it be a union. But, it is unfair to use one name and 
another structure.... I am against such unions. This is simply 
injustice and discrimination. 
  [Trotsenko] After World War II, many countries stood up on 
their feet thanks to foreign assistance. Huge investments were 
pumped into their economies, their industries received new 
technologies. No country has ever entered world markets 
unaided. Can we do that? 
  [Shpek] Of course, Ukraine cannot do that unassisted. To 
implement reforms, to introduce structural reconstruction, and 
to revive our enterprises we primarily need money and time. It 
is extremely hard for us to earn money now. We therefore have 
to attract foreign investors and producers. 
  It should be kept in mind that no country in the world can 
exist without loans. We should adequately participate in the 
world's distribution of labor. We can receive substantial funds 
from foreign partners for our reforms and the development of a 
strong, independent, and united Ukrainian state. If someone 
thinks that he will be given money, simultaneously restoring the 
socialist, administrative, command, and planning economy, his 
hopes are vain, and he must abandon them. We are obliged to 
develop our country in friendship and cooperation with all our 
neighbors.

<F P=106> [Article by Oleh Dorozhovets: "Kozyrev Is Poking His Nose </F>
Into Various Places"] 
  [Text] Russia's powerful foreign-policy surge in 1994 
has left the Americans at sixes and sevens. America simply does 
not know what damage it would be easier to reconcile itself 
with: either to rid itself of such an essentially pacified 
Russia or to abandon certain of its own strategic spheres of 
influence. 
  The United States is constantly following the policy of 
share, share, and share. I am amazed at its patience, but I 
understand it very well indeed. As a narcotic, as a ruinous 
passion, Russia captivated American statesmen. It has become the 
most expensive wild animal ever tamed, and--therefore--to 
deprive it of breakfast or--Heaven forbid--to beat it would be 
equivalent almost to a courtship. But this is only the emotional 
side of the matter. The pragmatic analysts in the White House 
understand other things too: A dextrous and capable Russia 
constitutes the backbone of United States foreign policy, and if 
the backbone is broken, the entire organism would be paralyzed. 
  However, this is also understood by the pragmatic analysts 
in 
the Kremlin. And, therefore, taking advantage of its own seeming 
value, Russia is endeavoring to gradually return into its own 
hands the world which it lost. Russia knows how to frighten the 
Clinton administration. The latter can be frightened by the 
dictatorial policy of the Zhirinovskiy people. Moscow has used 
this fright in order to obtain the right to keep troops in 
Moldova and the Baltic states, despite the attitude toward this 
on the part of the governments in those places. It has likewise 
been allowed to conduct "peacekeeping" operations on the 
territory of the CIS, as well as to protect and defend the 
Russian-speaking population abroad. 
  The Clinton administration can also be frightened by a 
change 
of allies. A possible rapprochement between Russia and Great 
Britain, for example, and the distancing of the latter from the 
United States was very clearly demonstrated by Yeltsin in 
February. For three whole days he did not answer Clinton's 
telephone calls, citing illness as an excuse, and after this he 
spent two days with John Major, who was visiting Moscow. All 
this occurred against the background of the exacerbation of the 
British-American "special" relationship following a sharp 
anti-Clinton campaign in the English media and after Washington 
granted an entrance visa to Gerry Adams, the leader of the 
anti-government, Northern Ireland Sinn Fein Party. 
  A third fright is that of a renewal of global confrontation 
and a slide toward World War III. Nothing global can happen 
without Russia. This thesis of the Russian Federation's minister 
of foreign affairs, Kozyrev, has already been espoused in two 
unexpected initiatives by Moscow--the introduction of Russian 
troops in Sarajevo and Russia's attempt to allocate to itself 
the role of peacemaker in the Palestinian-Israeli conflict. 
  But in the latter case Russia seems to have gotten itself 
into a sticky wicket. The United States could reconcile itself 
with Russia's action in the Balkans, but not in the Middle East. 
The Russia idea of holding a second round of the 
Palestinian-Israeli conference in Madrid was rejected both in 
Washington and in Tel Aviv, even though it was passionately 
supported by Yasir Arafat. Let's recall that the first round, 
which was co-chaired by the United States and the USSR, ended 
without any positive results in 1991. The apotheosis of the 
Russian turn to the East had to be Andrey Kozyrev's secret visit 
to Tunisia and Israel. Its secrecy could not be maintained, nor 
could his statement concerning Russia's desire to send its own 
military observers to this region. It was not without reason 
that Israel warned about the activities of Russian intelligence 
in Syria and other Arab states. 
  Another two directions in which Russia has been conducting a 
diplomatic offensive since the beginning of this year are Inner 
and Central Asia and Inner and Central Europe. Its pushing 
through into the former is attested to by the visit of Andrey 
Kozyrev's deputy, Anatoliy Adamishin, to Tehran, during the 
course of which a discussion took place concerning the 
possibility of Iran exerting an influence on fundamentalist 
terrorist groups which are blocking the road to peace in 
Palestine. Also discussed here was a common policy with regard 
to the Asian republics of the former USSR. Additional testimony 
was the appeal by the chairman of Tajikistan's Supreme Council, 
Rakhmanov, to the UN that the Russian troops in his state should 
be granted the status of "sky-blue helmets." 
  As to the Central European sphere, Russia likewise achieved 
an incontestible success--something which is called the 
"Partnership for Peace." Together with political methods, use 
was also made here of an age-old Russian insuperable 
weapon--energy resources. The drastic March reduction in the 
norms of gas deliveries to almost all the European ex-Soviet 
republics. The January attempt to cut off access to oil in the 
Czech Republic and Poland. The plans for building a 
Yamburg-Belarus-Poland-Western Europe Gas Pipeline. 
Participation by Russian shareholders in Estonian, Belarusian, 
Ukrainian, and Hungarian energy-transport and petrochemical 
enterprises. The energy war may become a geopolitical occupation. 
  All these movements and shifts in Moscow's renovated foreign 
policy have recently encountered a broader and more favorable 
response in Britain. This is obviously connected with the 
following two factors. On the one hand, London has always 
expected from Washington restraints placed on Germany and a less 
reflex-type attitude toward Japan. But Clinton--on the 
contrary--has adopted for himself the goal of restricting Tokyo, 
while unleashing Bonn. On the other hand, at the end of February 
Azerbaijan's President Aliyev signed an agreement in London 
providing for the Apsheron Oilfield to be developed by a certain 
consortium of eight British and American companies headed up by 
British Petroleum. At almost the same time the Russian 
Federation government prohibited the export of oil by the 
principal competitor of these companies--the Russian firm known 
as Lukoil. This is sharply different from last year's Russian 
stance, as a result of which a contract between Azerbaijan and 
Great Britain was almost broken off. 
  In addition to everything else, Russia's efforts cast doubts 
upon Clinton's promise to Kravchuk (made during the latter's 
American tour) to the effect that the United States would become 
the guarantor of Ukraine's security and integrity. But, of 
course, the White House does have the power to play a certain 
role here. It is certainly true that Ukraine is viewed in Russia 
as a kind of traditional patrimony--a role similar to that 
played by Israel to the United States. Russia's meddling in the 
Middle East could engender a responding effort at an 
intervention by America in the post-Soviet space. Russia's 
"rollback" from the Arab region could also evoke a corresponding 
American response in Ukraine or in the Baltic region. It is 
entirely possible that such a "reciprocal clarification" could 
be Russia's actual purpose in making its unrealistic and 
precipitous foreign-policy initiatives. This is called a 
tactical preventive strike. But this is not an offensive but 
instead a defensive tactic. Its principal goal is not to snatch 
something belonging to somebody else, but rather to safeguard 
something of one's own. Unfortunately, Moscow regards Ukraine as 
"its own," just as it does--in the final analysis--all of 
Eastern Europe and Central Asia.

<F P=106> [Article by Vladyslav Omelchenko, political analyst: "The </F>
Americans Promise to Give, but Hold on Tight"] 
  [Text] 11 March After returning from an official 
visit to Washington, Leonid Kravchuk met with Ukrainian and 
foreign reporters. He informed representatives of the mass media 
of the results of his negotiations with U.S. President Bill 
Clinton. 
  In Washington, they signed a joint declaration on 
strengthening friendship and partnership between Ukraine and the 
U.S., as well as a convention to eliminate double taxation and a 
number of other important documents. Our president declared that 
they will open new, broad opportunities for business partnership 
and cooperation. It is very important for the young country that 
during the negotiations Bill Clinton affirmed American support 
for independence, sovereignty and territorial integrity of 
Ukraine. 
  Yet, euphoria from declarations and mutual congratulations 
appears to be on the wane. A sober assessment of the package of 
agreements from the point of view of Ukraine's interests comes 
to the fore, especially of those among them which concern 
security, economic stabilization and market reform. This was 
confirmed by the presidential press conference, which attracted 
a record number of correspondents. 
  Leonid Kravchuk had to make use of all of his political and 
diplomatic talents to come up with answers to a flood of 
questions from journalists. 
  As expected, at the center of attention was concrete 
financial assistance from the U.S. The Ukrainian president 
returned from his visit with a suitcase full of assurances and 
promises. The Americans once again showed that they appreciate 
concessions. Once the tripartite declaration had been signed in 
Moscow, the promised $300 million assistance for disarmament, as 
though by magic, instantly doubled. It became $700 million. One 
half of that sum will be earmarked for nuclear disarmament, 
while the other half for the implementation of market reform. 
  Today, this sum means nothing, of course. It is only a drop 
in a bucket. 
  Moreover, will these promised funds be forthcoming? The 
Americans, as before, managed to give away their cake and to 
hold on to it at the same time. They put many conditions on 
their $700 million. Ukraine must first firmly embark on the path 
to reform, which has become quite problematic given political 
instability and renewed activity by pro-communist forces. 
Another condition is that the money will be disbursed if nuclear 
weapons are removed from the territory of Ukraine. On this 
issue, it appears that there will be no impediments. Leonid 
Kravchuk and his team gradually surrender positions on defense 
under pressure from Moscow and Washington. Today, our northern 
neighbor is effectively in sole possession of the Black Sea 
fleet and is trying to turn Sevastopol into a Russian city. 
  It is hard to comprehend why a great European power would 
surrender unilaterally its nuclear weapons, which give it solid 
protection, in exchange for nothing but sweet promises. Perhaps 
we really do not need those thousands of warheads. A protective 
barrier could have been provided by one or two dozen rockets. 
Naturally, a space-travelling nation could have found funds for 
their upkeep as well as first-class specialists to take care of 
rocket launching facilities. Incidentally, if it possessed 
nuclear weapons Ukraine would not need to maintain a large 
standing army which is currently bleeding our budget white. 
  There is another amazing thing: why are nuclear weapons 
being 
removed from Ukraine in such haste? President Kravchuk proudly 
informed journalists that the first train transporting 60 
warhead already crossed our border. 
  "Has a single train transporting nuclear fuel for our 
nuclear 
power plants crossed the border from Russia, as provided for by 
the tripartite declaration?" asked one correspondent. 
  "Not yet," replied the president. This, according to him, 
requires more time. 
  It is a pity that Leonid Kravchuk has already forgotten how 
he rushed to transfer tactical weapons to Russia, and has looked 
for promised compensation ever since. 
  These political games are being played at a time when 
Russian 
nationalists are playing their Crimea card and carry out a rabid 
anti-Ukrainian campaign, and when Russia declared that it will 
stop supplying natural gas to Ukraine. 
  Slyly and easily, the two super powers, having joined 
forces, 
effectively put us on our knees and now dictate the rules of the 
game. 
  From President Kravchuk's responses, I could not figure out 
by what physical mechanism American assistance be transferred to 
Ukraine. There is concern that it could flow into the pockets of 
organized criminal structures. Indeed, a large portion of 
humanitarian aid has disappeared. For instance, there are 
growing rumors that a large portion of the money promised by 
Clinton will be used to buy soy beans from the U.S. Leonid 
Kravchuk dismissed this as gossip. 
  In its previous issue, UKRAYINSKA HAZETA asked Mr. Miller, 
the U.S. ambassador to Ukraine, to explain to our readers the 
system and timing for the transfer of the promised dollars to 
Ukraine. For two years, the U.S. has been promising us financial 
assistance. But, in reality, it turns out as in a Ukrainian folk 
saying: "The lord promised me a warm coat, but his word is 
warmer."

<F P=106> [Letter sent by staffers of the Ukrainian Embassy in the FRG </F>
to Ukrainian Foreign Minister A.M. Zlenko: "We Are Not To Be 
Frightened by a Paternalistic Attitude"] 
  [Text] From the editors: A copy of the letter which 
staffers of the Ukrainian Embassy in the FRG sent to the 
Ukrainian Ministry of Foreign Affairs has been sent to MOLOD 
UKRAYINY. We are printing it here below with some minor 
abridgements. 
  Dear Anatoliy Maksymovych! 
  As staffers of the Ukrainian Embassy in the FRG, we turn to 
you in connection with the situation which has 
evolved--unfortunately--at this embassy. Each of us has worked 
in the embassy for various periods of time, but all of us have 
reached one and the same conclusion: Work at this embassy does 
not measure up to the demands of our times; genuine 
opportunities for organizing assistance to Ukraine are not being 
taken advantage of and--in many instances--are being blocked. 
Our state is thereby caused political, economic, and moral 
damage or harm. 
  All this is taking place through the lack of knowledge or 
desire on the part of Ambassador I.M. Piskovyy to organize the 
embassy's work in the proper way. It is also caused by his 
consciously creating an unhealthy moral and psychological 
climate within the collective, as well as by his ignoring 
presidential edicts and orders issued by the Ukrainian Ministry 
of Foreign Affairs. 
  To this very day the collective has been working under 
absolutely abnormal conditions, remaining under constant 
surveillance by the special services involved. At the same time 
repairs on the building acquired by the embassy are being 
unjustifiably delayed and are being done in an inappropriate 
manner. 
  With regard to the ambassador himself, there is a lack of 
the 
proper political ideas or any desire to protect and defend 
Ukraine's interests at the higher levels of the German 
government and state. He also lacks an aggressive quality and 
initiative in political work. This was attested to, for example, 
by his reaction to the resolution by the RF [Russian Federation] 
Supreme Soviet on Sevastopol. The tragic subject of the famine 
in Ukraine during the years 1932-1933 was not utilized in any 
way for attracting the attention of political and civic circles 
in the FRG to Ukraine, even though there were all sorts of 
opportunities to do this. The ambassador also openly shuns 
contacts with the Ukrainian community in the FRG. And the 
representatives of that community have already begun manifesting 
a dissatisfaction with such an attitude on his part. 
  The "tempestuous" economic activity under the ambassador's 
direct guidance boils down to mending connections with small 
firms or creating very favorable conditions for those German 
firms in which he has a personal interest. A blatant example of 
this is the "Stalmann" Concern. The ambassador himself actively 
intervened in this matter and insistently demanded that K. 
Stalmann be appointed an honorary Ukrainian consul. 
  At this same time the embassy failed to provide any 
initiative for preparing or carrying out any large-scale 
economic project, either in the field of finance or that of 
production. 
  Moreover, we have in our possession here genuine documents 
attesting that the ambassador intentionally undermined or 
unjustifiably delayed the examination of matters which were--and 
are--of extreme economic as well as political importance for 
Ukraine. What we are talking about in particular here is the 
delivery to Ukraine under very favorable conditions of a 
considerable quantity of oil with a deferment of payment for 
several years. Also involved is a matter of utilizing 
progressive technologies in machine building, etc.--a matter 
which could be used as a weighty argument in our relations with 
Russia. 
  Nor can we neglect to mention such items as the following. 
By 
the ambassador's efforts to have the staffers of the Ukrainian 
Embassy insured by the German "Gothauer" Insurance Company, they 
were introduced to Mr. Yu. Kvitsinskiy (a citizen of Russia). 
During the Soviet period these people openly regarded Ukraine 
with scorn and a lack of respect. For four months the 
Kvitsinskiy family received medical benefits amounting to almost 
50,000 German marks. The insurance company has accused the 
Ukrainian Embassy of forgery and is demanding that we pay back 
the above-mentioned sum, warning that--otherwise--the insurance 
policy will be cancelled. 
  We persistently endeavored (and on more than one occasion) 
to 
call upon the ambassador to organize the work in the proper 
manner, sincerely believing in his decency and honor. Several 
meetings of the collective took place. But in response to all of 
us (each one in a separate interview) the ambassador began to 
threaten to send us home to Ukraine officially. 
  We are not to be frightened by a paternalistic 
attitude! 
  In response to Ambassador I.M. Piskovyy, we are citizens of 
Ukraine, and it was to protect and defend its interests that we 
were sent to work in the FRG by the Ukrainian Ministry of 
Foreign Affairs. And no matter what the circumstances, we will 
not--like certain "Ukrainian" diplomats in Berlin--appeal to the 
German authorities. Here too, unfortunately, the ambassador 
played a disgraceful role, forcing one of the embassy staffers 
to sign an illegal document--contrary to instructions from the 
Ministry of Foreign Affairs. 
  Our collective wants to work and is capable of doing so. For 
this purpose each of us has professional knowledge and skills, 
competence, a certain amount of experience, and a wide circle of 
ties in the country where we are stationed. But the main thing 
is that we have the desire to honestly and honorable perform our 
civic and service duties. 
  The restricted scope of the present letter does not accord 
us 
the possibility of elucidating the entire picture. However, we 
can no longer put up with scorn and abuse of our state nor moral 
torments and maltreatment. We are not serfs, and we do not work 
for Mr. Piskovyy, but rather for our own state. Piskovyy is not 
yet the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, and certainly not Ukraine. 
  If--in response to our criticism here--the ambassador 
attempts to deprive us of the right to perform our duties, as he 
threatened to do at our recent meetings, and to organize 
groundles charges against us one at a time, we will return all 
together. And this will be done not only by those persons who 
have signed the present letter. 
  Germany is too important a factor for Ukraine's foreign 
policy to leave our diplomacy with it in such a state of 
disarray. 
  We would request that you, dear and esteemed Anatoliy 
Maksymovych, thoroughly examine the situation which has evolved 
and take the proper measures. 
  We sincerely trust you. 
  Respectfully yours, 
  [Signed] V. Ohryzko, counsellor of the Ukrainian Embassy in 
the FRG

<F P=106> [Speech by Belarusian Prime Minister Vyacheslaw Kebich to </F>
the Defense Ministry officers staff on 25 March; place not 
given: "We Should Maintain the Armed Forces"] 
  [Excerpts] [passage omitted] What does the current economic 
situation look like? It is extremely dangerous. Let us look at 
it objectively. The picture is ambiguous. It cannot be painted 
in only one color; for example, black or white, or, moreover, 
pink. 
  For one thing, the drop in production is continuing, 
furthermore, over the last few months, this problem has sharply 
exacerbated. For another thing, market supply and demand 
mechanisms are gradually beginning to work. Before, for 
example, workers at the Motor Vehicle or Television Set 
Factories would have never thought that someone would not buy 
their products. Everything that was produced by them was 
centrally distributed. Currently, a key question is: Will our 
television sets, motor vehicles, tractors, or other goods be 
bought? 
  The first signs of competition are appearing. The movement 
toward the market has begun, though with mighty efforts and in 
low gear. However, this is not the sort of a market which we 
are longing to set up and which has made people of many states 
wealthy. Currently, with us, economic freedom correlates with 
the economic irresponsibility of many businesses in their 
relations with partners, consumers, and the state. 
  However, this is also caused by the lack of reliable legal 
protection for our citizens and enterprises. Over the decades, 
our economy, its costs, technologies, wages, and profits have 
been formulated according to mechanisms other than those of the 
world economy. Production was oriented toward relatively cheap 
fuel and raw materials, at considerably lower transportation 
costs. It is impossible to immediately integrate into the 
global price system, which has a fundamentally different 
structure. 
  What issue is the most acute today? Prices for energy 
resources. The point is that nearly our entire economy is based 
on energy- intensive technologies. The gap between domestic and 
world prices for oil was as big as nowhere else. The cost of 
oil stood at 7 percent the world price. Currently, those 
proportions have abruptly altered. Up to 60 percent of prices 
for energy resources approach world levels, which makes our 
goods noncompetitive. [passage omitted] 
  Our position is as follows: 
  1. To keep the budget deficit at last year's level; 
  2. To considerably cut and gradually rescind grants and 
subsidies to producers, and direct them toward consumers; 
  3. To increase state financial aid to the population. These 
financial subsidies should be granted only to people who are in 
sore need of them; 
  4. To minimize the issuing of bank credits on favorable 
terms; to foresee the allocation of budget means to lower 
interest rates for granting credits to priority branches and 
businesses; 
  5. To reject administrative methods when setting up a state 
currency fund; to use a single exchange rate for state needs and 
rescind the tax on currency revenues; 
  6. To introduce payments in some institutions of the social 
sector; 
  7. To reduce the number of enterprises which receive state 
subsidies. A producer who is unable to organize effective 
production without being financially supported by the state 
should either restructure his production or close down, 
according to the Law on Bankruptcy. 
  These main directions of the government's activities were 
adopted by the Supreme Soviet and we are doing everything 
possible to implement them. [passage omitted] 
  To resolve cadre issues, the Cabinet of Ministers adopted a 
resolution to set up a military academy. All of us understand 
its importance. Costs for training the senior military staff 
will be decreased by five times. However, it turned out that 
not all the opportunities for attracting military researchers 
and setting up the academy's scientific potential -- as stemming 
from the Republic's opportunities -- were sorted out. 
  In my opinion, it is worth recalling that we have two 
excellent military colleges to train officers, as well as a 
Suvorov secondary military school. It is necessary to use their 
capabilities to train foreign citizens, raise the issue of more 
extensive student exchanges. This could lower the cost of 
training even further. 
  Enough time has passed in which to create the Armed Forces. 
Their restructuring will have to be finished by 1 January 1995. 
It is high time to raise the issue of an officer's honor and 
dignity, the fulfilling of the military oath. 
  We consider it to be a serious failure of the Defense 
Ministry that a number of officers are ready to leave their 
fatherland after they have taken their oath of loyalty. Their 
patriotism proved false. They are ready to leave the fatherland 
and lose their citizenship for a better salary abroad. Is this 
not a training problem, a result of our faulty staff policy? 
This serious failure, which led to the dismissal of a range of 
first class officers for the sake of preserving those who were 
considered to be our future and did not live up to our 
expectations. 
  The government realizes these dangerous processes and 
understands their destructive impact on the Armed Forces. The 
issue of maintaining the staff is likely to be a key one in 
keeping the Army up to snuff. To improve their living 
standards, the government is going to adopt a resolution to 
substitute their food rations with monetary compensations and to 
later increase them. We are looking for opportunities to 
increase the basic allowances for military ranks in May-June. 
  Given the current economic situation, we cannot provide for 
the introduction of contract service in our Armed Forces. This 
demands that a radical staff reduction and severe expenditure 
increases be introduced; and that 100 percent of all servicemen 
-- from a private to a general -- receive housing facilities. 
At the moment, this problem is one of the most acute and 
difficult to resolve. 
  The government is concerned by the fact that some 15,000 
servicemen have no housing. Of these soldiers, one in every 
three has been transferred to the reserves. Those servicemen, 
who were transferred to the reserves and listed as requiring 
better housing conditions after 1 July 1992, have no right to 
state housing. However, their allowances and pensions do not 
allow them to engage in building their own houses or apartments. 
  Therefore, we take all measures to build houses and 
apartments for servicemen, including those in the reserves, at 
state expense. In the immediate future, these issues will be 
discussed at the Presidium of the Cabinet of Ministers. During 
negotiations with the United States, we agreed that $10 million 
out of the $25 million which the United States will provide to 
aid the conversion of our defense industry will be spent on 
building housing for servicemen, and $5 million -- for the 
retraining of officers in the reserves. 
  It is a well-known fact that under a market system, the Army 
should be completely financed by the state. The ideas of some 
primitive politicians that the Army could be maintained at the 
expense of some commercial structures are not only 
self-deceiving but, in some sense, directed at demoralizing and 
undermining the defense capabilities of the Armed Forces. 
  A complicated economic situation engenders a desire to 
immediately upgrade the economy at the expense of the defense 
system, and this must absolutely be ruled out. At the same 
time, the inaction of the Defense Ministry on issues related to 
the rational use of existing housing facilities is also 
inadmissible. For years, in big cities, empty buildings have not 
been used and nobody leases them. Many agreements have been 
signed with Russia, Ukraine, and other republics, however, they 
are being introduced very slowly. This is another extreme 
situation connected with the sluggishness and misunderstanding 
of time which demands that active measures and perseverance be 
used. 
  More and more new issues arise in both the economic and 
military areas. Their resolution is impossible without 
cooperating closely with other states, first and foremost, with 
Russia. I will give you two examples. Belarusian enterprises 
can produce only 3 percent of our required armaments and 
hardware. Belarusian repair enterprises can handle only 2 
percent of armaments and hardware out of 4,000 types which our 
Army utilizes. 
  You know that the government is consistently working in the 
direction of setting up a close economic union, in particular, 
the financial and monetary union, with Russia. Similar work is 
being conducted in the military sector. We are sure about its 
positive results and that they will serve as a good basis for 
the implementation of the planned military building. But we do 
not exaggerate the results of this unification and do not relax 
while waiting for it to happen. 
  As head of the Belarusian Government, I declare that the 
government is undertaking, and will continue to undertake 
various measures aimed at maintaining the Armed Forces. The 
Defense Ministry will no longer ask other ministries and 
departments for means to maintain the Army. 
  The entire process of military building and Army 
restructuring will be based on "state orders" to ensure the 
provision of the Army with hardware and armaments. According to 
the Armed Forces' demands, the state buys equipment, which 
cannot be produced in Belarus, abroad. We hold out hope that 
cooperation in the military sphere will be of importance, as 
well. 
  To implement these programs to reform the Armed Forces, 
resolving the social issues of the officers corps, the military 
budget will shortly be indexed. 
  However, the Defense Ministry should also learn how to earn 
money. The work of the Commercial Department should be 
upgraded. [passage omitted] 
  We all are unanimous: We must maintain the Armed Forces! 
Our defense should be reliable and stable. Esteemed Officers, 
you play the key part in this process. Your dignity and the 
state analysis are the basis for our defense capability and the 
stability of the state, lawfulness, and discipline in the troops.

<F P=106> [Article by ZVYAZDA correspondent: "An Avalanche of </F>
Credit.... Some Results of the Republic's Economic Performance 
in January and Possible Consequences" 
  [Text] First of all, the overall results in the first month 
indicate that the economic decline is becoming even more 
threatening. Compared to January of last year the national 
income declined by 31 percent, industrial output declined by 
almost 20 percent, and production stood at only 43.8 percent of 
the January 1991 level. The State Committee for Statistics 
reported that in January practically no work was done by the 
Mogilev Elevator Plant, the Minsk Bearing Plant, the Vitebsk 
Kirov Machine Building Plant, the Kobrin Instrument Plant, the 
Minsk Computer Equipment Association, the Grodno Azot 
Association, and many other enterprises. 
  High prices on goods resulted in difficulties with sales, 
and 
overstocking. Rising prices resulted from increased costs of 
production, in particular the higher cost of fuel and energy. 
The State Committee for Statistics reported data on the rising 
earnings and costs of production of the goods sold in the past 
year. These figures are as follows: while overall earnings for 
the year rose by 11 times (also, incidentally, primarily because 
of the price factor), costs rose by 13 times. This reflects a 
drop in profitability and labor effectiveness. Despite greater 
efforts than before, we are getting less output. 
  The remedy is clear--either reduce costs or convert to the 
production of more profitable goods or, better yet, do both 
simultaneously. Our state, however, with its social form of 
property ownership and consequently vague forms of 
responsibility, is hardly capable of either. A typical example: 
despite the extreme energy-intensiveness and sky-high costs of 
energy, energy consumption relative to the national income last 
year dropped only slightly--compared to 1992, the national 
income and energy consumption stood at 90 and 89.1 percent, 
respectively. 
  Let's look again at January's indicators. A total of 30.6 
percent fewer consumer goods were produced than in January of 
last year. Trade turnover (in comparable prices) stood at only 
49 percent (consumer demand dropped by more than half!). The 
State Committee for Statistics explains it this way: the drop in 
sales of goods in the domestic market resulted from the decline 
in their production, rising prices, and a drop in the 
population's real income. Obviously, however, the latter two 
factors taken together were by far the most important. In recent 
months, prices have risen much faster than income. In December, 
prices rose at twice the rate, and in January by almost four 
times. Specifically, people's money income in January rose by 11 
percent while prices rose by 40.7 percent. 
  What can we expect next? Obviously, the economic 
situation--and with it people's standard of living--will get 
worse. In February we have witnessed the government's attempts 
to halt rising prices and, consequently, inflation (recall the 
well known decision about bakery operations). Nevertheless, we 
can expect an even higher price rise in the next few months. 
This will result, in particular, from the recent credit infusion 
of more than a trillion into the agrocomplex and the 
government's plans to throw an additional trillion into it 
(note, incidentally, the proposed approach to the distribution 
of the additional trillion--it is to be proportional to the area 
of agricultural lands which the farms have...). Already, as a 
result, credits to the agrocomplex alone will almost equal all 
the credits to the whole national economy for all of last year 
(the remainder of the loans as of 1 January came to 2.3 trillion 
rubles). 
  Meanwhile, the situation has become much worse with 
circulating capital in trade and industrial enterprises, which, 
as we know, are also in need of credit.... The credit mass is 
turning into an avalanche, there is more and more money and 
fewer and fewer goods and commodities. According to some 
economists, inflation may reach as high as 80 percent in next 
few months. This is very likely. Hence, we are still going to be 
paying very high prices for today's "cheap" bread.

<F P=106> [Article by Ivan Baranowski: "We'll Just Map Out the Right </F>
Course and Everything Will Go Fine.... Some Results of the 
Economy's Performance for Two Months"] 
  [Text] According to the State Committee for Statistics, the 
republic's economic situation has worsened. In January and 
February, compared with the same period last year, the national 
income dropped by 33 percent. The volume of industrial output 
stood at 63.5 percent. Mutual indebtedness rose sharply, and 
large stocks of unsold goods accumulated. In many enterprises, 
indebtedness for shipped goods and stocks exceed monthly and 
even two-month volumes of production. As of 1 January, the 
volume of finished goods stood at 30.7 percent of all goods 
produced in December; as of 1 March, that figure was 47.2 
percent of the total in February. As of 1 March, enterprises 
were overstocked in the amount of 2.114 billion rubles. 
  The assembly line producing goods "for the warehouse" is 
busier than ever. At the Belshyna Combine, remainders of 
finished goods at the beginning of this month amounted to 76.3 
percent of the total February volume (almost everything they 
produced went to the warehouse); in the Minskbudmateryyaly 
Association such goods exceeded that volume by 22.3 percent; in 
Palimir the figure was 1.9 percent. 
  A total of 1,642 enterprises and organizations--21.3 percent 
of the total number--started 1994 with losses. In January, total 
losses stood at 268.9 billion rubles. Industry's profitability 
was 12 percent in January (versus 22 percent in January of last 
year). In February, 21 enterprises did not operate at all, and 
many only worked part time. 
  In the two months, the production of consumer goods stood at 
70.3 percent, with food accounting for 69.4 percent. Hence, 
their availability to the trade declined. Supplies of meat and 
meat products in January and February stood at only 49 percent 
of last year's level (supplies to inter-state stocks increased 
to 131 percent). 
  Retail trade turnover declined by 52 percent in January and 
February. The State Committee for Statistics explains that the 
drop in sales of goods in the domestic market is due to 
declining production of them, to rising prices, and to the 
further decline in people's real income. 
  The level of real income (income minus obligatory payments 
and contributions, taking account of consumer price index 
adjustments) in February was 73 percent of last December's 
level, which in turn was much lower than the previous year. 
  According to data of the State Committee for Statistics, the 
consumer price index for February was 118.7 percent of 
January's; compared to December, prices on goods and services 
rose by 1.7 times. 
  The State Committee for Statistics believes that the main 
reason for the higher rates of inflation in recent months is the 
rising cost of energy and the increased exchange rate of the 
Russian ruble in the Inter-Bank Currency Exchange. At the same 
time, the State Committee for Statistics draws the following 
categorical conclusion: "The disarray in the financial and 
credit system is also due to the unjustified setting of the 
exchange rate of the Belarusian ruble compared to the Russian, 
which is many times greater than the actual purchasing power of 
the Belarusian and Russian rubles" (?!). The Committee says that 
it and Russia's State Committee for Statistics ran the 
calculation "using a methodology that is most like the one used 
in the international comparisons of the UN." What was the 
outcome? "On the basis of a comparison of the cost of a standard 
array of 97 basic food and nonfood items in the prices of each 
of the two countries, a parity of purchasing power was 
determined; in September it stood at 1.16 Belarusian rubles 
(whereas the currency exchange rate in September was 1.5); in 
October it was 1.4 (from 1.5 to 3.0); in November it was 1.72 
(6.10 to 4.15); in December, 2.22 (4.15-4.51); in January--2.63 
(4.51-4.00); and in February--2.85 (3.95-6.19)." 
  In other words, the exchange rate is to blame.... All we 
have 
to do is set the "correct" course and everything will go fine.... 
  It's too bad the market exchange rate, which promptly reacts 
to daily realities--and market laws in general as well--is not 
susceptible to the methods of the State Committee for Statistics 
(by the way, wasn't it the introduction of these methods that 
launched the attempt to close the currency exchange?). It's too 
bad that the exchange rate is set not by calculations but by the 
urgent, momentary, pressing need for Russian rubles 
(incidentally, this momentariness has become constant), that it 
is influenced by enormous unsecured credit emissions which also 
encourage production "for the warehouse," the extremely negative 
balance of payments (the indebtedness of the republic's 
enterprises to enterprises in other countries as of 1 February 
exceeded 487.9 billion rubles. The greatest share of the total 
indebtedness--88.9 percent--was owed to Russian enterprises). 
Isn't it the reverse? Isn't the current exchange rate a product 
of our economic reality? Although actually, it isn't even a 
matter of whether the exchange rate is low or high--it's a 
matter of its stability, and of course it would be a good idea 
to influence that as actively as possible.

<F P=106> [Interview with General Lebed, commander of the 14th Army, </F>
by special correspondent Arkadiy Khantsevich; date not given: 
"`I Am an Unsuitable Candidate for Whipping-Boy'"] 
  [Text] Tiraspol-Moscow--He is honored among the 
troops with the respectful "Papa" (this at the age of 43). 
Moldovan nationalists have christened him "occupier" and 
"imperialist." Super-patriots in Moscow and Tiraspol abuse him 
with the words "Judas" and "traitor." 
  What career has not been predicted for him as of 
late--from defense minister of Russia through banishment to a 
remote military district. Aleksandr Rutskoy offered Lebed the 
chance to become a minister in October 1993--and he received the 
sole possible response: "You can go and... yourself." More than 
just the former vice president have experienced the brusque 
manners of the commander of the 14th Army. The inordinate 
sharpness of Lebed's opinions go against the grain with many of 
his present superiors also--the Ministry of Defense even 
attempted to ban the general's contacts with the press and the 
public. But subduing or intimidating him is not, apparently, 
that easy.... 
  [Khantsevich] Aleksandr Ivanovich, is what has been written 
about you the truth or an invention ? 
  [Lebed] A conventional biography. I am native of 
Novocherkassk, the capital of the Don Host. I graduated from 
school there in 1967, I worked there also for two years--a 
grinder and loader. This whole time I was trying--three 
times--to enroll in flying school. I was not accepted--because 
of a bad nasopharynx. It was operated on, but I was ultimately 
still deemed unfit for flying service.... 
  [Khantsevich] And what about the nose, if it is no secret? 
  [Lebed] I took a blow. In 1969 I enrolled at the Ryazan 
Airborne School and graduated from it in 1973. At the decision 
of the school's council I was retained for service there. I was 
commander of a platoon for three years, and from 1976 through 
1981, commander of a company of officer candidates. 
  In 1981 I left for Afghanistan as commander of a battalion. 
Then, the academy: enrolled in 1982, graduated in 1985. 
  [Khantsevich] Aside from the school and Afghanistan, what do 
you remember most of this period of service? 
  [Lebed] As a division commander, I was repeatedly 
"carousing" 
around flash points. In the fall of 1988, Sumgait, 
winter-spring, Baku. April-May of 1989, Tbilisi. The "jacket 
potatoes" campaign of sorry renown--this was 1990, September. 
Before this, in January-February, I was, true, in Baku once 
again. And everywhere I was involved in defending people and 
preventing them grabbing one another by the throat. 
  [Khantsevich] Not only the addresses but also the situations 
in each of these "flash points" were, understandably, different. 
Do such conflicts have anything in common? 
  [Lebed] I will say merely what I felt each time as a 
soldier. 
Wherever I went, not once did I receive an order in writing. Not 
once! The telephone would ring, as a rule: Let's go to 
such-and-such a place, boys, it's not good there, sort it 
out.... You pull the fighters apart, and as soon as the carnage 
ends, a crowd of prosecutors piles onto you: Why did you do 
this, not this? Not one investigator could answer this simple 
question for me. A soldier is standing there, guarding an object 
that has been entrusted to him. A passerby spits in the 
soldier's face. Is this assault and battery or not? And if so, 
what should the soldier do: shoot the passerby, spit at him in 
return, hit him? If so, with what: his fist, his boot, the butt 
of his rifle? For I have to instruct a subordinate when I put 
him at his post in an extreme situation. The soldier is, in 
ancien-regime language, a sovereign individual, he is not here 
on a visit. Civilians may sort things out between themselves--at 
the level of presidents, politicians, what have you. But leave 
the soldier alone, he is an official person, his mother is 
waiting for him at home.... 
  It was a very troubled time in this respect, telephone law 
raged everywhere. Each time our former president, the 
incomparable Gorbachev, was "astonished." Thus three divisions 
were flown to Tbilisi, three divisional commanders, I recall, 
came together--eight regiments for the three--a whole armada. 
You can imagine what work this involved: getting people away 
from all the airfields, loading the helicopters with equipment, 
transferring, unloading, deploying, putting the city under 
protection.... And then this astonishment is expressed at the 
top: How did they actually come to be there, did the devil put 
them there? They all pretend to be simpletons.... 
  And how did they devour Rodionov, commander of the district? 
He was a most intelligent person, an elite general, we do not 
have many like him in the army. And he was subsequently 
"appointed" the culprit, and they wrote that he was a murderer. 
  All this made an extremely negative mark on our minds. You 
feel yourself to be in some way inferior, as we would put it, 
perhaps. As though you are in service of the state and you have 
power to hand, but you are like a butterfly beneath a net--it is 
about to be slipped over you. 
  [Khantsevich] Aleksandr Ivanovich, continuing the subject of 
inventions.... Various things are being said, for example, about 
your relations with the present minister of defense.... 
  [Lebed] I do not know who is saying what, but it has been 
the 
case that we have in our service careers been closely linked our 
whole lives. Were, that is. Senior Sergeant Lebed was under 
Lieutenant Grachev deputy platoon commander. Then Lieutenant 
Lebed was a platoon commander in a company under Senior 
Lieutenant Grachev. Subsequently we went our separate ways--we 
met up in Afghanistan. Lieutenant Colonel Grachev, deputy 
regimental commander, Captain Lebed, battalion commander. We met 
up in the airborne forces once again. So we spent a lot of our 
service life together. 
  [Khantsevich] One further myth--concerning the start of your 
service in the Dniester region. That you came here incognito, 
with papers made out for Colonel Gusev.... 
  [Lebed] This was the case. My assignment included the 
mission 
of securing the evacuation of the servicemen's families. And the 
document was issued for this special assignment. 
  [Khantsevich] So you came here with one mission, and then 
the 
order to take over the army came? 
  [Lebed] Yes, when I looked into the situation, I realized 
that there could be no question of any evacuation and that the 
armed conflict could be and had to be stopped. 
  [Khantsevich] At that stage you found a common language with 
the local leaders. During the combat operations, upon their 
conclusion particularly, you were frequently seen together. And 
then a sudden parting of the ways.... 
  [Lebed] Practically immediately. I will first show you a 
document. 
  I arrived here on 23 June 1992. I became commander on 28 
June. On 14 July I received a petition from Senior Justice 
Counselor Luchik, prosecutor of the Dniester Moldavian Republic, 
for the apprehension of Reserve Lieutenant Colonel Kostenko. 
This commander of the Dniester Guard 2d Battalion in Bendery, of 
sorry renown, was, indeed, a real villain: schizophrenic, 
alcoholic, drug addict. This is what it says: 
  Reserve Lieutenant Colonel Kostenko, as commander of 
the PMR [Dniester Moldavian Republic] Guard 2d Battalion, 
embarked on the path of serious crimes. As of this time he has 
unlawfully deprived of life more than 20 persons from the ranks 
of peaceful inhabitants, PMR guardsmen, and police officers of 
the Republic of Moldova. Kostenko carried out the executions of 
the said persons in a state of alcoholic intoxication, as a 
rule, without any verification, on suspicion or personal dislike 
alone. In connection with Kostenko's criminal activity criminal 
proceedings had been instituted in respect to the latter by the 
PMR Procuracy on 9 April, and a warrant for his arrest had been 
issued on 24 April. But Kostenko was not opportunely arrested. 
Considering the above and also the fact that, remaining at 
liberty, Kostenko could frustrate the negotiating process 
between the PMR and Moldova, I would ask that you assist in 
detaining Kostenko and placing him in a cell of the PMR Military 
Headquarters. For your information: Kostenko is resourceful and 
dangerous, is constantly surrounded by beefed-up security, 
enjoys certain support among the activists of Bendery, and could 
provoke a massacre in Tiraspol itself." 
  I was already aware of Kostenko's gangsterism by that time. 
At first I believed that this was no concern of mine: Those who 
have engendered a criminal, they should be the ones to slay him. 
But petitioners came from Bendery in streams--help us, defend 
us, save us.... It talks about his 20 victims here, but in 
actual fact he killed no fewer than 100. 
  Having received this petition, therefore, I prepared an 
operation and put it into effect on 17 July. A special airborne 
battalion and an armored company assigned to it surrounded the 
2d Battalion and completely disarmed it, without losses on 
either side. Disarmed it handsomely. You need also, after all, 
to know how to deliver ultimatums. When a 125-mm gun 100 meters 
away is staring you in the face, there is nowhere to hide--a 
shell from such a distance will turn the bravest into a heap of 
pitiable rags hanging from the bushes. 
  In a word, the battalion was disarmed. But Kostenko himself 
had been removed from his former whereabouts. He had been 
spirited away, as we learned subsequently, by people from his 
personal guard and the security service of PMR President 
Smirnov. And then they finished him off. And they stuck it on me. 
  Why did they bump off Kostenko? He knew too much. Aside from 
the killings, he had, in addition, been involved in robbery on a 
very large scale. It is sufficient to say that he stopped a 
KamAZ echelon, which was en route from the Western Group of 
Forces via Tiraspol, unloaded it, and sold off the motor 
vehicles. Mass arms dealings, a monopoly on food in hungry 
Bendery--all this was controlled by Kostenko. And it is not hard 
to guess why he was disposed of without trial or investigation. 
  So the disagreements with the local leaders began 
immediately. And what you have seen has been simple diplomatic 
courtesy. We meet even now and smile at one another. Not all 
that sincerely, it is true. 
  [Khantsevich] That is, the conflict has switched to the 
phase 
of open confrontation. Has it? 
  [Lebed] But on each occasion the initiative does not come 
from me. There is a mass of examples. An edict of President 
Smirnov recently declared the entire air space over the Dniester 
region property of the PMR. The sole proprietor is the Aviation 
Administration, and within its jurisdiction are the 
transportation of passengers and freight, services, and, note, 
"all airfields." But there is just one here, and this is 
military, Russian at that, what is more. 
  Further, an edict of that same president of the PMR 
"inserted" amendments to the status of servicemen of the Russian 
Army on the territory of the Dniester region. Thus in the event 
of an agreement being reached on the withdrawal of the 14th Army 
and also in the event of the disbandment of the units, all the 
equipment and munitions, as, equally, the rest of the property, 
shall be declared the property of the PMR. All this is aimed, 
perhaps, only at the utmost exacerbation of relations with 
Russia. Only people who are not planning on staying here could 
behave this way, it being to their advantage to make a mess of 
things and slip away on the quiet, seeing as there is somewhere 
to go to.... 
  [Khantsevich] Have there been any actions taken against you 
personally? 
  [Lebed] Leaflets have been posted in Tiraspol with the 
following content: "Alarm! Alert! Lebed, funded by Borovoy 
(Moscow) and Manukyan (Tiraspol), is preparing bloody terror on 
the land of the Dniester region. His purpose is the seizure of 
power, destruction of the armed forces of the PMR, and surrender 
of the republic to Romania. People of the Dniester region, be 
vigilant! Lebed is the Judas of the Dniester region!" This 
lunacy has been circulated in Tiraspol, but entirely opposite 
information is being tossed Moscow newspapers of a particular 
persuasion: "According to information received by the 
newspaper, there has been a very serious change in the situation 
in the Dniester region. Leaflets calling for the ouster of 
President Smirnov have been posted throughout Tiraspol. As our 
informant observed, this has been done on the directions of 
General Lebed. 
  Part of the army has been put on a state of alert, and 
the servicemen are being confined to barracks in body 
armor." 
  The very environment of the activity of a number of local 
leaders has accustomed them to being unable to live without 
provocations. Some of them are conclusively entangled in corrupt 
business. No way out, political, at least, is in sight. The 
international isolation of the Dniester region has not eased 
but, on the contrary, has intensified as of late. Plus the 
economic impasse. You are carrying local money? It is a charm, 
not money. They take a regular postage stamp and stick it on an 
old Soviet note, and all this is passed off as a brilliant 
invention of thinking humanity. 
  So that when everything is going badly, when a mass of 
malcontents appears, all vile, unprofessional politicians start 
to operate according to the stereotype--they switch tracks. The 
search for an enemy--foreign, internal--gets under way. If the 
foreign enemy does not work, let's have an internal one. It was 
decided for some reason or other that I would be a suitable 
candidate for an enemy. But I am no candidate for whipping-boy. 
All this is short-sighted, and is being done quite clumsily, 
what is more. 
  Then stage two--the organization of an armed 
conflict--begins. For war, as we know, writes off everything. 
  A special situation was introduced in the Dniester region on 
18 January. For what reason--no one can articulately explain. 
Initially in connection, allegedly, with the elections in 
Moldova--an exacerbation of the situation is possible, they 
said, provocations cannot be ruled out.... But the elections 
were held long since, and in organized fashion, what is more, 
without conflicts. Politically sober-minded people have come to 
power in Kishinev [Chisinau], a dialogue with them is possible. 
But the special situation was ultimately extended for a month, 
then for another.... 
  [Khantsevich] Nonetheless, as long as Russian troops remain 
in the Dniester region, it may be hoped that things will not 
reach the point of a new armed clash. But there is information 
that a decision on the conversion of the 14th Army into a 
military base of Russia has already been adopted.... 
  [Lebed] All this is much ado about nothing. The president of 
Russia was in Georgia. There is nowhere currently for the very 
sovereign Georgians to go, and they have found themselves 
completely penned in. And so the following agreement was signed: 
through the end of 1995, a transitional period, and as of 1 
January 1996 there will be on the territory of Georgia three 
Russian bases--army, naval, and air. And by analogy political 
dreamers began to ponder what might happen in the Dniester 
region. A base, for certain. And the commotion begins again. 
There is no such decision. 
  [Khantsevich] What, then, do you yourself see as the fate of 
the 14th? 
  [Lebed] Were I asked whether it were normal for the army of 
one state to be on the territory of another, I would answer: No, 
it is not. Should it be withdrawn? Undoubtedly. But when--this 
is another matter. When the political and economic conditions 
for its withdrawal have been created. 
  By political I mean the imparting of an international-legal 
base to the relations of the left and right banks of the 
Dniester. Some people must be serious guarantors that there will 
be no more war here. Meanwhile, whether some people like it or 
not, a certain military-political balance has taken shape here, 
albeit somewhat spontaneously. People would simply not let the 
army leave. 
  Economic conditions. Thanks to Mr. Shevardnadze, quite 
enough 
forces have been withdrawn to Russia. Withdrawn thus: officers, 
into barracks, barns, and henhouses; tanks, into the open fields. 
  Only when we have built some things there: apartments, in 
full measure, barracks, 50 percent at least, then, with the 
appropriate political background, the army might get under way. 
There is no technical problem--planning an echelon and 
transferring it. Although there is one "but" also: munitions. 
They can neither be dumped nor eliminated in situ--there is too 
much of them. So they have to be withdrawn in small special 
quantities. How would Ukraine view this, would it be happy at 
such dangerous freight crossing its territory? What would it ask 
for this? If we exclude weekends and holidays from the days on 
which they are withdrawn, I would not even attempt to say how 
long it would take. Several years, in short. 
  And when the Moldovan side continues to insist on the 
withdrawal of the 14th Army before 1 July 1994, this is not even 
funny. It is personal ambition pure and simple. 
  If the Germans, say, want the troops to leave their 
territory, they render us the utmost help and assistance. 
Moldova, on the other hand, has yet to provide one ruble to help 
the Russian military relocate and fend for itself and has only 
presented ultimatums. 
  [Khantsevich] Aleksandr Ivanovich, great interest was 
aroused 
in military circles, as among the public at large, for that 
matter, by the book entitled "The Performance Was Called a 
Putsch," in which you described the events of August 1991. Now, 
as far as I know, you are working on yet another book. You are 
not yet, it would seem, of an age to be sitting down to write 
your memoirs. What has prompted an active general to take up the 
pen? 
  [Lebed] There is, in fact, one book. What you read about the 
putsch was merely a chapter from the future "Notes of an Army 
Commander," a provisional title, it is true. 
  This book is not so much one of reminiscences as a 
conversation with the reader. I myself have been attempting to 
understand what kind of country ours is--great and at the same 
time unfortunate. When will we start to respect ourselves, when 
will we bring into line the colossal territory with its enormous 
wealth and the living standard of the 150 millions persons 
inhabiting it? 
  And if just some of the people who read this booklet ask 
themselves such questions, I will consider it not to have been 
written in vain.

<F P=106> [Article by Siegfried Thielbeer: "Estonia as Bridge to </F>
Russia. Between Dispute Over Principles and Pragmatism"] 
  [Text] Tallinn, Mar--While in Moscow one can occasionally 
hear threats in regard to the alleged suppression of the Russian 
minority in Estonia--there is even talk of a bloodbath, 
apartheid, and deportation--and in Tallinn Russia is accused 
time and again because of the delays in troop withdrawal and 
alleged imperial intentions, the situation in the country itself 
is absolutely quiet. Neither are the human rights of the 
Russians disregarded--only the right to vote in parliamentary 
elections is witheld from noncitizens--nor are there 
"deportations." Estonians and Russians get along well in their 
daily contacts, even if most Estonians in the depth of their 
heart would really like the "occupation Russians" out of their 
country and the Russians fear precisely this. But there is a 
gaping difference between heart and mind, and the Estonians, 
too, know that they cannot drive the Russians across the border. 
They see the humanitarian problems. And for the Russians it is 
much more important to take part in the Estonian economic 
miracle and to earn kroons than to flirt with the "ruble zone," 
even if they are annoyed about the demand to apply for residence 
permits. 
  In the daily contacts, even when there are occasional 
provocations, the tone of voice is recitative in the Nordic 
manner. The Russians, too, have become more "Nordic" in the 
meantime. The striving to live together in harmony is 
unmistakable. In Estonia, just like in Latvia, there have never 
been serious incidents between the nationalities. Even the 
grumbling in the lines has stopped, because one no longer has to 
stand in line: The atmosphere in the shops has become relaxed 
and friendly, as in the West. The Estonian Government, too, 
especially Prime Minister Laar, refers to the fact that the 
situation in the country is quiet and that unfortunately a 
completely false impression is created by the saber-rattling in 
Moscow. There are continuous assurances to the effect that there 
really are no difficulties with the Russian minority. Once the 
Russian troop withdrawal is complete, so goes the argument, then 
even the last old Stalinists in Estonia, who up to now regarded 
Estonian independence as a temporary episode, will realize that 
they must obey Estonian laws. Up to now, they say, the old 
Russian leaders have done a disservice to their own cause, for 
example by thundering against the language requirement for 
Estonian citizenship, instead of learning the language. Once the 
occupation army is out of the country and the sovereignty of 
Estonia is restored, they say, it will be possible to be more 
generous toward the Russian minority. 
  Behind the dispute over principles--Estonia wants Moscow to 
admit that it occupied Estonia in 1940--and the Russian threats 
to protect the Russians with "sanctions" if necessary, there is 
concealed a network of pragmatic cooperation, including between 
the nations and the economic actors. In the negotiations about 
technical details of the troop withdrawal, say about the removal 
of the stocks of mines and ammunitions, as well as the nuclear 
reactors of the Paldiski submarine base, the experts are finding 
agreeable solutions. Estonia suspects that the Russian military 
pensioners could form a fifth column. But the pension transfers 
to the barely 11,000 former officers from the Russian Ministry 
of Defense are cleared smoothly through Estonian banks. During 
the past year, Russia has reduced the number of its troops to 
approximately 2,000 officers and noncommissioned officers, 
because wages and food provisioning suddenly had to be paid for 
in kroons. In the Estonian Ministry of Defense and in the high 
command, Estonian former colonels of the Soviet Army are 
performing their service in civilian clothes because, in 
Estonian uniform, they would lose their Moscow pension. 
  In spite of the far-reaching reorientation to Western 
markets, the foreign trade between Estonia and Russia is again 
increasing, especially through agricultural exports into the 
region of St. Petersburg. Tallinn, so Estonian Foreign Minister 
Luik emphasizes, is the second most important port of 
transshipment for Western humanitarian transports to Russia. And 
without the in part highly-skilled Russian workers in the 
industrial plants, many of whom at one time belonged to the 
Soviet armament industry, the economic upswing of the country 
could not be attained, as people in the Estonian Ministry of 
Economics, in the Estonian Government in general, and among most 
of the parties, know. In terms of investments of foreign firms 
in Estonia, Russia--after Sweden, Finland, and America--is still 
before Germany in fourth place. What is the point of the Russian 
threat of sanctions, in the meantime taken back by Prime 
Minister Chernomyrdin in Helsinki, if Estonia receives its oil 
no longer from Russia, but through private and international 
enterprises such as Neste and Statoil? Whether Neste or Statoil 
fill their tankers with Russian or Norwegian oil depends, above 
all, on the prices. Only with respect to natural gas supplies is 
Estonia dependent to the extent of 100 percent on Russian 
shipments. The Russian Gazprom gas concern, however, long ago 
for a great deal of money bought 30 percent of the shares of 
Eesti Gaas [Estonian Gas]. For Gazprom--where Chernomyrdin once 
was a director--the sales against Estonian currency at world 
market prices is important. 
  Estonia, so says Foreign Minister Luik, could be a bridge 
between East and West--not politically, as once Finland under 
Kekkonen wanted to be, but economically. Many Estonian firms, he 
pointed out, have close contacts with Russian firms. Through the 
"Russian" firms with Russian workers and managers, he suggested, 
splendid contact with the economy of Russia could be established 
from Estonia. The traffic system and information infrastructure, 
he added, are rather well-developed. 
  If the Russian leaders today complain about the fact that 
the 
Baltic states do not thank Russia and Yeltsin for granting them 
independence, he suggested, this is rather their problem with 
their own past. To the contrary, the Russians actually should be 
grateful to the Balts. For through their aspiration for 
independence and democracy, he said, they contributed to the 
breaking up of the Soviet system and the democratization of 
Russia. The Russians, too, could learn from the Estonian 
economic miracle through shock therapy, said Prime Minister 
Laar. According to him, Russia's problem is not that it was 
subjected to too much shock therapy, but that it received too 
little of it. Foreign Minister Luik said that Russia, in which 
politics no longer determines the economy, also has an interest 
in a strong, independent Estonia. As a satellite, he suggested, 
Estonia is economically worthless for Russia. It is valuable, by 
contrast, he said, as a partner, if it has a stable currency, 
and a stable democracy and is economically prosperous.

on Voluntary Return of Illegally Acquired or Kept Firearms, 
Ammunition, or Explosives," citizens of the Republic of 
Lithuania, who have reached 25 years of age, have the right to

devices. 
<H5>  Issuing of Permits for Acquiring, Keeping, and Carrying </H5>
Firearms for Self-Defense and Their Ammunition 
  5. Permits to acquire, keep, and carry pistols (revolvers) 
and their ammunition are not issued to persons:

committed with the careless use of firearms or gas arms, 
ammunition, or explosives, who are on probation, and who are 
undergoing punishments other than imprisonment;

illegal acquisition and possession of drugs, violations of 
hunting or fishing rules, violations of rules of acquiring, 
keeping, carrying, and using firearms and ammunition, 
encroachment of public order and the established government 
system, and other planned administrative breaches of law, the

instrument or direct object of administrative violations; 
  5.3. Who are incapable, as well as those who abuse 
alcohol, use drugs or toxic substances, are mental patients,

ministries. The revenues are assessed and used as special 
nonbudget finances. 
<H5>  Acquisition and Keeping of Firearms and Ammunition </H5>

the buyer. 
  26. Every three years, persons possessing firearms for 
self-defense must have them tested at zones (Vilnius, Kaunas, 
Klaipeda, Siauliai, Panevezys, Alytus, Marijampole, Utena, 
Telsiai, Taurage) according to their place of residence. 
  27. Persons pay for firearm tests to the Interior Ministry 
in accordance with its fees. The revenues are assessed and used 
as special nonbudget finances. 
<H5>  Extension and Annulment of Permits for Keeping and Carrying </H5>
Firearms

repeated training test. 
  29. The Public Police Administration at the Interior

commissions. 
<H5>  Sale of Firearms and Ammunition </H5>
  32. The Lithuanian Arms Fund store can sell only

unloaded (cartridges not inserted in chambers). Firearms must 
also be carried: 
  38.1. Under the clothes; 
  38.2. In a place not visible to other people. 
  39. Firearms and ammunition can be used: 
  39.1. To defend oneself, other persons, property, the 
inviolability of one's place of residence, other rights, the 
interests of society and the state against the actual or 
imminent threat, if that does not exceed the limits of necessary 
defense; 
  39.2. To avoid the loss of firearms;

<F P=106> [Article in two installments by Elisabeth Nordgren: </F>
"Discontent Spreading In Latvia"] 
<H5>  [11 Mar p 3] </H5>
  [Text] It is almost time to leave. Zina stands out in the 
bitter cold inspecting the vanload of furniture. Since 1985 Mrs. 
Antonina Kuznetsova and her husband, an officer, have lived on 
the Adazi Russian military base near Riga. She has worked here 
as a typist at a military office, but now she and her family 
must leave. Mrs. Kuznetsova looks sorrowful. She does not know 
what awaits her in Rostov, where her family is moving. 
  Mrs. Kuznetsov's family is one of almost 3,000 officers' 
families that must eventually leave Latvia. But, for now, 
negotiations over the withdrawal of Russian troops from Latvia 
have broken down. 
  At present, however, individual families are moving. People 
still seem to be living in most apartment buildings on the Adazi 
base. Curtains hang in the windows, rugs and mattresses hang on 
frames for dusting, out in yards where children play in the 
snow. A gray striped cat slinks out into the cold and a 
half-completed apartment building stands empty up on the hill. 
<H5>  Empty Barracks Area </H5>
  The barracks area itself is also empty, except for the 
battalion commander, Lieutenant Colonel Anatoliy Kvartsov, and 
just under 100 officers and soldiers (of a force of 2,500 men) 
who still live in the housing area. But the barracks have been 
emptied of their soldiers. The cots stand in neat rows. Even the 
bed of the "unknown soldier" up on a platform has been made. 
  As recently as December 1992 the base was teeming with life, 
the tramping of boots, and the sound of target practice. Then 
people started moving away. 
  Adazi base, 18 kilometers north or Riga, was used as a 
training site for sergeants who, after a half year of training, 
went on to various posts in the Baltics. 
  Lt. Col. Kvartsov believes that eventually he, too, will 
leave, but he does not yet know when. He received his military 
training at a military academy in the northern Caucasus. He will 
soon be homeless when he moves to Russia and his wife, who 
worked as a bookkeeper on the base, will be unemployed. 
  The commander does not know what will happen to all the 
housing in the area. 
  "Everything here is owned by the Russian Army, but the local 
authorities will probably take over the buildings." 
  There are still a total of 10,000 active-duty soldiers in 
Latvia (of 120,000 during the Soviet period). If we add to this 
number an additional 200,000 (the figures vary depending on the 
source; the Army's press officer indicates 60,000) pensioned 
officers, disabled veterans of the Great Patriotic War, and 
those who spent time in concentration camps, we are talking 
about a significant military potential. 
  Here they have the same problems as in Estonia. The various 
categories of pensioner's housing rights are in jeopardy, 
pensions paid from the Russian Defense Ministry's fund are 
nonexistent, social rights are limited (free health care has 
been abolished) and Russia is demanding that Latvia pay 
considerable sums to support the Russian military. Moreover, war 
veterans are paid their pensions in accordance with Latvian law, 
and the amount is not great--only 21 lati (approximately 210 
markkas). And since the rent alone amounts to 20 lati, there is 
not much left over for food. The idea is for Latvia to 
contribute a housing subsidy of 50 percent. In addition, the 
press officer said that Russia could not pay war veterans of 
foreign powers. This is in conflict with the Latvian position, 
so the stage is set for conflict in this area. It is not 
surprising that a large portion of retired military personnel 
voted for Zhirinovskiy. 
<H5>  Beggars in Riga </H5>
  Over half the Russian population of Latvia, which is half 
the 
population of the country (2.7 million inhabitants) also voted 
for Zhirinovskiy. Moreover, since the law on citizenship, in 
which conditions are far stricter than in Estonia, has not yet 
been approved, a large portion of the Latvian population is, in 
a sense, outside society. One-fourth of the Russian population 
has become Latvian citizens, however, as they have been living 
in the country since the 1940's. 
  However, the lack of citizenship for the majority has led to 
increasing frustration, which can even be seen on the streets of 
Riga. Despite elegant new boutiques, despite stylish 
restaurants, the mood is dismal and gloomy. Armed civil guards 
are seen here and there. The banks are guarded. There are 
beggars and homeless people outside the railway station in Riga, 
where angry old Russian women stand and sell cigarettes. These 
old women, former factory workers and now poor pensioners, are 
angry at both the Kremlin and the leaders in Riga. 
  "I worked and slaved for 40 years in a factory and this is 
the thanks I get," said Olga. 
  "I get a pension of 25 lati and my rent is 18 lati. What am 
I 
supposed to live on? There are nothing but bandits in the 
government. They should be thrown out like the Russian pigs. The 
leaders live well, but no one thinks about us ordinary people. 
My daughter, who is a student, is unemployed, so I am just 
forced to stand here and sell things. The profits are nothing to 
write home about, about one lati (10 markkas) a day. Then the 
police show up and take our cigarettes." 
  Another old woman said she supported her son by selling 
cigarettes. Her pension is also small. And it is difficult to 
sell the cigarettes. She believes that Moscow is solely 
responsible for her predicament. It is a shame that the Soviet 
Union broke up, according to the old woman, who previously made 
a living in fishing. 
  Eight-year-old Jani sits by the stairs leading down to the 
subway. He is shaking with cold. He holds a piece of paper that 
says in Russian that his mother is his sole provider. She is 
unemployed and has four children. The family has nothing to eat. 
<H5>  "Help Us" </H5>
  Zhirinovskiy supporters in Riga complain about worsening 
conditions in schools, a shortage of Russian books and Russian 
libraries, and an unwillingness on the part of Latvian 
authorities to provide courses in Latvian for those who want to 
apply for citizenship. They point out that the economic 
situation is strained for everyone in Latvia, but that it is 
extremely difficult for unemployed Russians to find work. They 
also point out that the lack of citizenship for the Russian 
populace and for other minorities makes it difficult to 
demonstrate that their human rights are being violated in this 
country. Many Russians would be willing to leave the country if 
only they had somewhere to go. 
  They also point out that half the industry in Latvia has 
been 
shut down. Factories with Russian workers are generally closed. 
Zhirinovskiy supporters are also highly critical of Yeltsin, who 
has ignored the exiled Russians in Latvia. The level of 
education among Russians in Latvia is falling, since higher 
education is offered only in Latvian. These Zhirinovskiy 
supporters also believe that the Baltic nations will join the 
CIS countries, even if they support an independent Latvia. 
  It is a fact that the standard of living has dropped, that 
unemployment has risen, and that dissatisfaction has spread. And 
the Latvians are becoming more and more concerned over a fifth 
column and a Russian attack of some kind, while the country's 
leadership is feverishly working for more economy and other 
contacts with the West. 
<H5>  Concern Over Greater Russian Influence in the Baltics </H5>
  Guntis Ulmanis, the Latvian president, indicates that the 
demobilization of Russian troops has become a serious problem. 
  "Since Russia does not seem to be willing to withdraw its 
troops from the Baltic, the Russian leaders clearly intend to 
maintain their influence here. Since it is also impossible to 
predict what will happen in Russian politics, the situation is 
troubling." 
  The Russians who were involved in the coup attempt and were 
recently released in Moscow have the potential to develop a 
strong leadership, according to Ulmanis. The question is what 
they will decide to do. 
  Nevertheless, Ulmanis looks to the future of Latvia with 
confidence. 
  "Life has become better and quieter here. There is plenty of 
food and other necessities. Privatization is under way and 
industry is being activated. And we are continually developing 
our security structure." 
  At the same time, Ulmanis is hoping for more moral support 
from Finland which, because of its experience with a complicated 
past, can understand Latvia's vulnerable situation. More 
business ties are also desired. 
  Ulmanis does not see unemployment as a serious problem in 
Latvia. It is relatively low at present, he said. However, he 
wants to shut down the large factories previously run by Moscow. 
The citizenship law should be enacted later this spring, which 
should ease the situation for the Russian-speaking population.

  [Text] In Lithuania, 4 March is St. Kasimir's Day. St. 
Kasimir is the patron saint of Catholic Lithuania. In Vilnius, 
his day is celebrated with song and dance, a warming glass of 
punch in the snow slush, and brisk sales at the markets on the 
narrow streets of the old town. The most popular Kasimir item is 
made of dried grass with various types of flowers dipped in 
coloring and tied into a long, narrow, and brightly colored 
bouquet. 
  The people look happy and open and the mood is relaxed. The 
cozy cafes are filled with parents and numerous small children 
who happily drink their juice. And people gather in the many old 
churches to hear organ music and choirs. 
<H5>  More Contact With the West </H5>
  On the surface, at least, things seem to be going well in 
Lithuania, although the standard of living has dropped here as 
it has in the other Baltic states. This, by the way, is a trend 
in most of the postcommunist nations. 
  But there are few unemployed, only one percent, even though 
some large plants do not operate every day, according to Justaf 
Paletskis, President Brazauskas' foreign policy advisor. And, of 
course, this leads to social and psychological problem for those 
who are affected by unemployment. Nor is the crime rate as high 
as it is in the other two Baltic states, Paletskis points out. 
  Thus, under the leadership of former communist leader and 
current President Algirdas Brazauskas, Lithuania is stabilizing 
both economically and politically, it is establishing good 
relations with neighboring Poland, Russia, and Belorussia and, 
most important, it is increasing cooperation with the other 
Baltic nations and with the Nordic countries. A NATO membership 
is also on its wish list. 
  The last Russian troops left Lithuania in August 1993. Since 
the democratic law on citizenship was approved, all minorities 
were able to seek citizenship immediately, which 85 percent of 
them did. As a result, minority conflicts in Lithuania (just 
over 9 percent Russians, 10 percent Poles, and various other 
minority groups out of a population of 3.7 million) are minimal 
compared with Estonia and Latvia. 
  The majority of the Russian-speaking population are loyal 
Lithuanian citizens, Paletskis pointed out. 
<H5>  New Rich Doing Well </H5>
  One person who is happy with her life in Lithuania is 
31-year-old Daiva who is trained as a hairdresser. She was out 
on the town, shopping with her four-year-old son Martin. She is 
one of the country's new rich. She lives in her parents' private 
home and has a small vegetable garden. To be sure, she is 
unemployed at present, but she can afford to be a homemaker and 
take care of her child because her husband earns well. He 
purchases goods in Sweden and sells them at home in Lithuania. 
  "Everything is fine. There are plenty of goods in the shops. 
Our standard of living has gone up despite everything, although 
rent is high and goods are expensive," Daiva said. 
  Industrious Daiva also does some extra work at times. Her 
husband buys meat and other small items and Daiva sells them at 
the market place. 
  There are no conflicts between Russians and Lithuanians 
according to Daiva, who has several Russian friends. 
<H5>  Subversive Activities </H5>
  Despite everything, Zhirinovskiy supporters and other 
Russian 
groups are not particularly happy with their lives in Lithuania. 
But these dissidents, about 3,000 people, form a tiny minority. 
  Among them is Valentin Mesheryakov, a member of the Russian 
Communist Party. He has lived in Lithuania since 1953, is 
married to a Lithuanian woman, speaks the country's language, 
supported Lithuanian independence, but has not received 
Lithuanian citizenship. Why? 
  "I would have received citizenship if I had signed a paper 
that demands loyalty to the Lithuanian state. Since I have 
always considered myself a democratic person, I thought this 
requirement was undemocratic. There is a strange political game 
going on. The other day I was summoned by the public prosecutor 
and accused of subversive activity. That was because I am 
chairman of Rossiya. 
  This organization of Russian citizens exists in all the 
Baltic states, along with other associations that safeguard the 
interests of the Slavic people. It is these organizations, with 
their ties to Moscow, that are building a fifth column in 
Lithuania. 
  Mesheryakov continued: 
  "My home and the homes of my friends have been ransacked, 
too. We try to obey the laws of Lithuania, but we do not let 
Lithuanians into our territory. It is the job of Russia's 
prosecutor to handle may case, not that of the Lithuanian 
prosecutor. I demand freedom for Rossiya to operate here in 
Lithuania. According to Lithuanian law, only Lithuanian citizens 
have the right to establish organizations. But I will cite 
paragraph 23, according to which foreigners have the same rights 
as Lithuanian citizens." 
  "Our organization is apolitical, although I personally am a 
communist. But anyone from fascists to communists can join 
Rossiya. Russia is my country, and it is there I am asking for 
help." 
  Several of Mesheryakov's communist friends are in jail, 
accused of weapons possession and active opposition to Sajudis, 
the Lithuanian popular front that paved the way for Lithuanian 
independence. 
  Translator Tatyana Bogoshilskaya, born in Vilnius, was also 
interrogated after the coup leaders in Moscow were released, 
since she is in charge of a Russian cultural organization that 
is also considered to be disloyal toward Lithuania. 
<H5>  Where Is Brotherhood? </H5>
  At a meeting in the Teachers' Building, where members of 
some 
20 Russian organizations in Vilnius met, an elderly woman broke 
into tears. She had been without work for a long time and did 
not have Lithuanian citizenship. Her husband had left her and 
gone to Ukraine. 
  "We are hungry. What kind of freedom is this? Where is the 
brotherhood and equality? The rich ones leave and we have to 
stay here. Whey doesn't Russia find my husband? Here most 
Russians are unemployed and accused of being "red-brown." The 
criminal government in Moscow owes us a lot." 
  A younger woman who had worked for the Soviet Army has no 
citizenship at all and not even a valid passport. Now it seems 
she will have to wait 10 years to become a Lithuanian citizen. 
Another woman, who worked for the KGB in Vilnius, also 
complained because she had not received Lithuanian citizenship, 
but she is prepared to leave for Moscow at any time. 
  Nina Ivanova also cried bitterly. Her son, Valeriy Ivanov 
has 
been in prison in Vilnius for the past two years. He stands 
accused of helping start the blood bath in Vilnius in January 
1991 in which 14 innocent people were killed. Every day she 
visits her son in prison, where he awaits his trial. She is also 
concerned for her grandson who was left on his own in Moscow 
where his mother died. 
  "My son is innocent. He will be acquitted. It was Antonas 
Terliatskas of Free Lithuania who started the violence here in 
Vilnius. Who will take care of my grandson? I have worked here 
for 45 years. Now I am old. Who will bury me when my time comes? 
I am all alone. 
<H5>  A Victim of the Empire Has His Chance To Help </H5>
  Jack of all trades Vytautas Cinauskas, geologist, historian, 
poet, was among the Baltic people who were oppressed by Soviet 
power. He was deported for 15 years. 
  Even as a young man in 1941 he was sent with his mother and 
his 11-year-old brother to a prison camp far away in deepest 
Siberia on the River Lena, the coldest part of Russia, and he 
was not allowed to return until 1956. Toward the end, he was 
ordered to work on a geological research project. 
  His mother died of hunger almost immediately in the prison 
camp. The years passed and Cinauskas mannaged to flee, but was 
soon caught again in 1948. After his release, it took more years 
before Cinauskas was rehabilitated and allowed to begin studying 
and get a job. 
  In the prison camp, Cinauskas met Finns and Karelians from 
the Russian side. He was also sent down into the mines, where he 
had to work for eight years. 
  "Only a sense of humor could get you through prison camp and 
forced labor. It was also difficult to live here in Vilnius 
after I returned home. People did not want to accept me. I could 
not find work, since I had no official place of domicile." 
  Now Cinauskas has full-time employment as the head of a 
foundation for deportees who want to return home. There are 
still thousands of Lithuanians who were deported by the former 
Soviet empire during the forties. They and their children need 
help to return to their homeland. 
  The foundation was established in 1992 and it has received 
donations from exiled Lithuanians as far away as Brazil. The 
telephone rings in one of Cinauskas' offices at the headquarters 
of the Cultural Foundation in downtown Vilnius. One wall is 
covered with pictures of partisans and other deportees. A map 
shows the areas to which Lithuanians were forcibly moved. 
  Cinauskas is also gathering material for a book on genocide 
in Lithuania, including the deportation of Lithuanians and life 
in the prison camps. 
  As early as 1940, during the Sovietization of Lithuania, 
21,000 Lithuanians who were undesirable to the regime were 
deported to Siberia. The next wave of deportations came after 
the war, when several hundred thousand Balts were forcibly moved.

  For the Commonwealth as a whole, in February production of 
industrial output remained at the level of January of this year, 
while prices of producer enterprises rose by 18 percent during 
this period.

  Production of the most important types of food industry 
output declined. In January-February 1994, industrial production 
of meat in Russia, Kazakhstan, and Belarus was 26-28 percent 
less than in the same period of 1993; in Azerbaijan, 
Turkmenistan, and Moldova--41-46 percent less; and in 
Kyrgyzstan--it declined by half. Production of whole milk 
products dropped by 17-18 percent in Russia and Kazakhstan; by 
21 percent in Azerbaijan; by 38 percent in Moldova; and by half 
in Kyrgyzstan. As compared with January-February 1993, 
production of flour declined by 17 percent in Russia; by 20-22 
percent in Moldova and Belarus; and by 38 percent in Azerbaijan; 
while production of groats declined by 16-19 percent in Belarus 
and Kazakhstan and by 34 percent in Russia. 
  Production of the basic types of light industry output 
declined in most countries. The following table shows data on 
the changes in their production in January-February 1994 as 
compared to January-February 1993 (in percentages):

  Production of most types of complex household equipment 
declined significantly. Thus, production of washing machines 
declined by 18 percent in Belarus, by 39 percent in Moldova, and 
by 42 percent in Russia; production of radios declined to 
two-thirds its previous level in Belarus and by 53 percent in 
Russia; production of televisions declined by 13 percent in 
Belarus, by 17 percent in Russia, and by 24 percent in Moldova; 
and production of tape recorders--by 30 percent in Kazakhstan 
and by 51-58 percent in Belarus, Russia, and Kyrgyzstan. 
  In January-February 1994, electricity production declined by 
11 percent in Kazakhstan and by 14 percent in Belarus. 
  The following data characterize extraction of the basic 
types 
of fuel in certain states of the Commonwealth in 
January-February 1994:

  Production of the basic products of oil refining declined. 
As 
compared with January-February 1993, production of gasoline 
declined by 12 percent in Russia, production of diesel fuel--by 
17 percent, and production of heating oil--by 10 percent; the 
corresponding figures for Belarus were 20 percent, 24 percent, 
and 30 percent; and for Uzbekistan--31 percent, 12 percent, and 
31 percent. 
  As compared with the same period last year, production of 
finished rolled metal products in January-February 1994 declined 
by 22 percent in Russia and by 36 percent in Kazakhstan. 
Production of steel pipe in Russia declined to roughly one-half 
its previous level. 
  In machine building, production of some of the most 
important 
types of output declined significantly as compared to the 
January-February 1993 level. In the last 2 months, production of 
metal-cutting machine tools declined by 46 percent in Belarus 
and by half in Russia. In Russia 71 percent fewer pieces of 
forge-press equipment were produced than in January-February 
1993. Production of motor vehicles declined by 56 percent in 
Belarus; while in Russia production of trucks fell to one-third 
its previous level and production of passenger cars fell by 41 
percent. Production of tractors declined by 45 percent in 
Belarus, to one-quarter its previous level in Kazakhstan, and by 
81 percent in Russia. Their production ceased almost completely 
in Uzbekistan. 
  The lag in production of chemical output continues. 
Production of mineral fertilizers in January-February 1994 
declined by 29 percent in Russia, to two-thirds its previous 
level in Uzbekistan, by 36 percent in Belarus, and to one-third 
its previous level in Kazakhstan. In Russia, production of 
chemical fibers and threads and soda ash declined by 49-53 
percent and production of tires declined by 41 percent. In 
Belarus, production of synthetic resin and plastic and chemical 
fibers and threads declined by half or more and production of 
tires declined by 30 percent. 
  Production of building materials declined in most 
Commonwealth states. Thus, production of cement declined to 
roughly two-thirds its previous level in Russia and Kyrgyzstan 
and by 55-57 percent in Belarus and Kazakhstan.

"Ukraine: Three Scenarios on the Eve of Elections Neither One of 
Which Augurs Well for Russia"] 
  [Text] The independence of Ukraine constituted a 
challenge to Moscow, a challenge not so much to Russian national 
interests, as to the wisdom and intellectual capacity of the new 
ruling elite of the Russian Federation. After the disintegration 
of the USSR Moscow chose to play up to Ukrainian leadership, 
which is tactically interested in intensifying tensions between 
the two new independent states. Problems with the Black Sea 
Fleet, Crimea, and ownership of nuclear weapons deployed on 
Ukrainian territory grew practically out of nothing. Problems, 
in our opinion, of a tactical nature and undoubtedly of 
secondary importance by comparison with the principal task. 
  Russian strategic interests consist not of depriving 
Kiev of the right to own nuclear weapons located on Ukrainian 
territory or of taking possession of the Black Sea Fleet. The 
principal foreign policy task of Moscow consists of establishing 
relations based on partnership, friendship, and alliance with 
its Slavic neighbor. In that light problems of such apparent 
urgency today concerning the fleet, nuclear weapons, and Crimea 
are undoubtedly diminished. 
  The forthcoming parliamentary and then the June presidential 
elections in Ukraine theoretically create the possibility for a 
partial replacement of the ruling elite and a warming in 
Russo-Ukrainian relations. At the same time Moscow is presently 
confronting a crisis which was not even thought of by Russian 
presidential and government analysts at the end of 1991: the 
principal threats to the security of Russia emanate from 
Ukraine. They are mainly of a social character and cannot be 
avoided through diplomatic maneuvering or intergovernmental 
agreements. 
  The threats we are speaking of certainly do not stem from 
the 
hostility of Ukrainians toward "Moskali" nor are they of a 
military nature. The real problem for Moscow consists not of the 
number of nuclear missiles located on Ukrainian territory, but 
of the fact that the situation in Ukraine is gradually becoming 
more aggravated. The government has lost control of the economy. 
National currency was devaluated. There has been a significant 
rise in social unrest, particularly in the eastern and southern 
regions of the country. The possibility arises of the coming to 
power in Kiev of a "strong individual," with whom the central 
bureaucracy can hope to restore control over the country. 
  The social base of the regime is practically non-existent. 
That caused a certain slackening of the recently highly acute 
struggle between the executive and legislative powers. 
Nevertheless a truce between the president and parliament in the 
next several months, is practically impossible, even with 
consideration of the forthcoming parliamentary elections, which 
lessens the chances of the central authorities to achieve a 
certain restoration of control over the situation within the 
country. 
  Economic disintegration sharply diminished the significance 
of central power in its dialogue-contest with the regions. A 
number of oblasts are clearly gravitating toward separation from 
central authority. That process cannot be halted given the 
current conditions even with the declaration of a state of 
emergency. Discipline and combat readiness of the Ukrainian army 
are at a low level and personnel are demoralized. 
  The situation in Ukraine in effect precludes the possibility 
for a substantive improvement during 1994. The ruling elite has 
indicated that it is incapable of effectively managing the 
government. The social position of the population deteriorated 
so much that the use of shock therapy methods is impossible. It 
is most likely that after the elections at the end of March 
parliament shall preserve its current ambivalent character and 
probably will be unable to carry out an effective reorganization 
of the state and economic system. 
  The following scenarios are most likely in 1994 in the 
development of Ukraine. 
  Civil war and social disturbances. That scenario is based on 
the assumption that living standards of the population and the 
social situation will continue deteriorating on the whole 
leading to the occurrence of social unrest in individual regions 
of the country. It is possible that the initial clashes actually 
will be provoked by the actions of extremist nationalist 
organizations of a paramilitary type. Recent measures by 
Ukrainian authorities to limit their activities proved 
ineffective. 
  It is most probable that the centers of the disturbances 
will 
be local while flare-ups of social protest themselves will be 
episodic. At the same time the possibility exists that political 
forces will be found in the country which will lead the social 
disturbances. The latter will thereby gain an opportunity to 
extend beyond the local framework, particularly if they are 
"fed" with provocations by the extremist organizations. At 
present the sole political force in Ukraine, which, at any rate 
theoretically, could lead social demonstrations, consists of 
local structures of the communist ilk. The competition in this 
scenario is actually between Ukrainian nationalists of the 
extremist type and the communists. 
  The principal danger for Russia in the immediate future in 
this case will, in part, be posed by: 
  A massive influx of refugees into the border regions and 
their subsequent dispersal throughout the territory of the 
Russian Federation depending on familial and other ties of the 
refugees; 
  The possibility of a sharp weakening in the control 
exercised 
by authorities over nuclear weapons located on the territory of 
Ukraine; 
  Highly problematic prospects for an effective dialogue 
between the current Russian authorities and the opposing forces; 
  An extremely high probability of participation of Russian 
volunteers and representatives of Russia communist and 
nationalist organizations in armed clashes or in a civil war in 
Ukraine and inevitability of a resulting Russian involvement in 
the Ukrainian crisis; 
  Possibility of the spreading of armed conflicts and 
political 
and social disturbances to Russian territory; 
  An illegal influx of weapons into Russian territory from 
Ukraine; 
  A sharp rise in the possibility of ecological catastrophes 
in 
Ukraine; 
  Practically total liquidation of communication with Europe 
through the territory of Ukraine, impossibility of utilizing gas 
pipelines, oil pipelines, and ports located on the territory of 
Ukraine. 
  It is quite evident that political and financial losses for 
Russia in this scenario exceed the boundaries of the permissible. 
  The break-up of Ukraine into several parts. The given 
scenario proceeds from the assumption that the social, economic, 
and political crisis in Ukraine will lead to a change in the 
relative equilibrium of forces between central authorities and 
the regional elite in favor of the latter. In this case the 
local political elite will favor disintegration of the country 
in order to halt the break-up of the state even if at the 
regional level. The given variant presupposes a relatively 
peaceful break-up of Ukraine. The initial opposition will be 
between regional authorities and the center, and subsequently it 
will divide the semi-independent state formations themselves. 
  Some Kiev analysts believe that there is a very strong 
possibility that in the next few months a Donetsk-Krivorozhsk 
republic will be created in the eastern part of the country. In 
the face of the insularity of the east and south (Crimea) 
similar measures may be initiated by Galichina especially since 
representatives of specifically that region were the initiators 
of separatist tendencies in present-day Ukraine. After 
differentiation of these three regions the process of a further 
break-up of the republic will become inevitable. The next stage 
will consist of a gradual rise in tension between the given 
state formations, a rise which will be restrained only by 
territorial demarcations. 
  The immediate principal danger to Russia in a peaceful 
break-up of Ukraine will consist, in part, of the following: 
  Impossibility of predicting the situation with nuclear 
weapons in Ukraine, impossibility of ensuring total control over 
nuclear weapons by the new authorities, a need for difficult 
and, in certain cases, almost completely fruitless dialogue with 
new "owners" of nuclear weapons; 
  Significant increase in difficulties connected with trade 
contacts between Russia and Europe through the territory of 
Ukraine; 
  Certain growth in the possibility of ecological catastrophes 
in Ukraine; 
  A gradual rise in the volume of drugs smuggled from Ukraine; 
  Semilegal and illegal export of Ukrainian weapons, including 
the newest models, to regions of conflict located within the 
boundaries of the post-Soviet space. 
  It is highly probable, however, that the break-up of Ukraine 
will become possible as a result of social disturbances or civil 
war. The winning regional elite in that case will be identifying 
itself with the liberators of the population from consequences 
of terrorism and military actions. The appearance of 
dictatorships and partialdictatorships, including those of a 
pro-communist type, is highly likely. Principal political 
opposition in Ukraine in that case will again take place between 
regional regimes. In this case the danger to Russia will on the 
whole corresponding to that which characterizes the scenario 
involving civil war and social disturbances. 
  The political damage to Russia in the short term caused by 
realization of the scenario involving break-up of Ukraine under 
certain circumstances may prove to be within the realm of the 
permissible. At the same time the direct and indirect financial 
damage, in part as a result of the interruption in the 
continuous export of gas to Western Europe, will apparently be 
excessively high. 
  The progressive degradation of state and society in Ukraine. 
That scenario, in my opinion, is the most likely of the three 
listed. It is based on the assumption that the current crisis in 
the country will not lead to social cataclysms, but the regional 
elite will find themselves insufficiently strong in order to 
assume full responsibility for the political and economic space 
partly controlled by it at the present time. The gradual 
break-up of political, economic, and social ties in the country 
will continue, the transportation system and the informational 
space will be subjected to further disintegration, the migration 
of the population to relatively developed neighboring countries 
and especially to Russia will acquire a massive character, and 
there will be a gradual rise in the possibility of a 
dictatorship of the nationalist or communist type coming to 
power. 
  The scenario with gradual degradation of the state and 
society in Ukraine poses, in part, the following dangers for 
Russia: 
  Gradual increase in the migration of able-bodied population 
to Russia, and, as a consequence, the aggravation of a number of 
well- known social problems here, particularly unemployment; 
  A sharp increase in smuggling in Russia, particularly of 
narcotics; Decomposition of the Ukrainian army will create the 
probability of the sale of Ukrainian weapons to Russian criminal 
elements and extremist political organizations, as well as 
illegal sale of Ukrainian armament, including, possibly that of 
the newest type, in "hot spots" of the post-Soviet space; 
  Impossibility of conducting an effective dialogue with 
Ukrainian authorities, as well as loss of their significance by 
a number of previous agreements due to the inability of the 
Ukrainian side to fulfill them; 
  A rise in the possibility of ecological catastrophes in 
Ukraine; 
  A weakening of control by central authorities of nuclear 
weapons deployed on the territory of Ukraine. 
  The political losses of Russia in the short range in case 
this scenario comes about, at first glance, appear to be 
indirect rather than direct. 
  The financial damage on the whole will apparently be 
tolerable, although there is a stable prospect of its sharp 
increase in 1995. The social consequences of a mass-scale labor 
migration and smuggling will possibly become the main negative 
consequence for Russia resulting from the gradual degradation of 
the state and society in Ukraine in 1994. 
  In principle all three scenarios indicate that for the 
immediate future Russia is a hostage to the situation in 
Ukraine. In one way or another Russian citizens will feel, if 
only by the state of their pocketbook, the dimensions of the 
socioeconomic crisis in the neighboring independent state. 
Forthcoming parliamentary elections in Ukraine therefore acquire 
special significance for the population of not only Ukraine but 
of Russia as well. Appearance of prospects for a resolution of 
the crisis requires the preliminary replacement of a significant 
part of the ruling elite. It is quite clear that renovation of 
the legislative corps is only part of what is required. A change 
in the composition of executive power is possible only after the 
presidential elections. Regardless of the decision made by 
Ukrainian voters on 27 March 1994, the appearance of that most 
long awaited prospect for something better is objectively 
postponed at least until the end of June.

<F P=106> [Article by Bohdan Horyn: "We Fear a Russia Armed with a UN </F>
Mandate"] 
  [Text] On 21-23 February, a NATO-sponsored seminar 
titled "Theory and Practice of Peacekeeping" was held in London. 
A member of the Russian delegation Aleksandr Piskunov delivered 
a paper "On Russia's Peacekeeping Activity on the Territory of 
the Former Soviet Union." The head of the Ukrainian delegation, 
Ukraine people's deputy and deputy chairman of the Ukraine 
Supreme Council Commission on Foreign Affairs Bohdan Horyn took 
part in the discussion and, upon his return to Kiev, provided 
for the UKRAYINSKA HAZETA an analysis of this complex issue. 
  Russia's position on its right to conduct peacekeeping 
operations on the territory of independent states which emerged 
after the breakup of the Soviet Union is an international 
problem meriting an especially close attention of the 
international community. The idea that Russia should be given a 
UN mandate for peacekeeping missions in Moldova, Georgia, 
Tajikistan and other CIS states is not only actively discussed 
in the Russian press but is increasingly voiced by Russian 
Federation (RF) Foreign Minister A.Kozyrev as well as 
representatives of its new legislative corps. 
  This is why peacekeeping activities that take place far 
beyond RF borders require broad and comprehensive discussion and 
analysis from the point of view of their compliance to 
international legal norms. First of all, the meaning that Russia 
attaches to terms "peacekeeping forces" and "peacekeeping 
activities" should be scrutinized, to see to what extent it 
confirms to the interpretation and experience developed in this 
area by the UN. 
  It should be kept in mind that at the time of the Soviet 
empire, to which Russia considers itself a successor, a practice 
existed whereby a completely different meaning and substance 
were attached to commonly used words, concepts and terms, as a 
result of which, although widely known the world over, they 
acquired their own peculiar connotations and even became their 
exact opposites. 
  As is well-known, the former Soviet Union did not need to 
import champagne from France but produced instead its own 
version of the famous beverage, under the absurd label of Soviet 
Champagne. The fact that for three centuries the Champagne 
region of France has been the place of origin of champagne, or 
that it is made from special types of grapes that grow only in 
that region, did not matter Soviet specialists in either 
semantics or wine making. 
  Nor did the Soviet Union consider it necessary to hold to 
the 
meaning which the international community, based on many 
centuries of experience, attaches into the concept of democracy, 
as a result of which under the Soviet regime the term "Soviet 
democracy" came into being, meaning in practice the exact 
opposite of democracy, i.e., an anti-democratic, totalitarian 
regime. 
  Today Russia, considering itself the successor of the Soviet 
empire, has borrowed much of that negative experience in its 
theory and practice. Its current domestic and foreign policy 
also gives cause for concern, especially if we were to decipher 
such peculiar terms as "Russian democracy" and "Russia's 
peacekeeping mission in CIS states." Let me briefly analyze some 
of the actions of Russian troops outside RF borders. 
  Proof of Russia's peculiar interpretation of its 
peacekeeping 
role comes from events in Tajikistan, where Russian troops took 
part in a civil war, protecting a regime that was faithful to 
Russia. Recently, Russia has been calling the border between 
Tajikistan and Afghanistan its own border. According to 
statements from influential politicians in Russia, the basis for 
this bold claim is the fact that Russian troops are protecting 
ethnic Russians in Tajikistan. Statistics show that due to the 
unstable situation in the region there are fewer and fewer 
ethnic Russians there, but this does not mean that Russia will 
stop calling the Tajik border its own. Most likely, another 
version will be invented: the need for protection against Muslim 
fundamentalism or something similar--to justify the occupational 
regime and Russian presence in that country. 
  After the publication of many documents, it is no longer a 
secret that the puppet Dniestr Republic was created with the 
direct participation of Russian troops. The commander of the 
so-called peacekeeping 14th Army, Russian citizen General Lebed, 
despite being on the pay of Russia, ran for and won a seat in 
the Supreme Soviet of the Dniestr Republic. It is an 
unprecedented event in world experience. 
  A similar mission by Russian troops in Georgia ended, 
according to Georgia's leader E.Shevardnadze, with the 
occupation of Abkhazia. "Georgia suffered a defeat in a war 
against an unequal foe, in a war which, according to a minister 
of one superpower, had been started to safeguard strategic 
interests of that country in Georgia," said Eduard Shevardnadze 
at a press conference for Georgian and foreign journalists, 
meaning strategic interests of Russia. 
  The above-mentioned facts make us wary of Russia's 
peacekeeping missions. An analysis of the actions by Russian 
forces beyond RF borders makes it clear that Russian leaders 
attach a meaning to the concept of "Russia's peacekeeping 
mission in CIS states" that has nothing in common with the 
peacekeeping activity of troops under the aegis of the UN. It is 
very important that this reality of Russia's foreign policy 
attract the attention of the world opinion, especially now, when 
Russia is actively seeking a UN mandate to carry out 
peacekeeping operations in countries which emerged after the 
breakup of the USSR. 
  Information appearing in newspapers that in July of this 
year 
the first-ever joint tactical training exercises by peacekeeping 
forces of the US and Russia will take place in Orenburg oblast 
give cause for alarm. The goal of providing security for 
independent states would be much better served if two or three 
independent groups of experts were formed under the aegis of the 
UN, the Conference on Security and Cooperation in Europe and 
NATO to study and report on the aims and consequences of 
Russia's so-called peacekeeping activity on the territory of 
independent states. The collected material and expert 
conclusions could become a weighty rebuttal to attempts by 
Russia to get for some of its military units the mandate of UN 
peacekeeping forces, which, as seen from daily experience, would 
be used for conducting dubious operations. 
  We believe that putting an end to activities that contravene 
international norms can be done only with the help of an 
independent international fact finding mission, by discussing 
its conclusions in the UN Security Council. Russia's neighbors 
need mutually beneficial economic cooperation and not 
contingents of "peace-loving Russian troops." Those peace-loving 
troops should be based on their own, Russian territory. Other 
nations will decide for themselves whom to call and with whom to 
be friends on an equal footing. So far, in early March, Russia 
refused to supply gas to Ukraine. This is an example of its 
peace-loving policy.

<F P=106> [Article by Marat Salimov under the rubric "Russian-Latvian </F>
Business Ties": "Entrepreneurs Are Ahead of Politicians"] 
  [Text] At the meeting of entrepreneurs of Russia and 
Latvia held yesterday at the Congress Center of the Chamber of 
Commerce and Industry, representatives of business circles from 
the two countries reached an understanding on strengthening 
bilateral ties. The businessmen's initiatives may create a 
favorable climate for normalizing Russian-Latvian political 
relations. 
  One gets the feeling after every meeting of Russia's 
entrepreneurs with their colleagues from the republics of the 
former USSR that the system of interstate relations created is 
not focused on developing entrepreneurial activity among 
countries. Yesterday's event organized by the efforts of the 
chambers of commerce and industry of Russia and Latvia was no 
exception either. Nonetheless, the meeting fulfilled its 
priority task, which, judging from the heightened interest shown 
toward the event by the Russian government, was expanding 
unofficial channels of economic cooperation. 
  At this time the main obstacle in the way of expanding 
trade-economic cooperation between Russia and Latvia is the lack 
not only of a free trade system (Russia has concluded such 
agreements with all the CIS countries), but also of most favored 
nation status. As a result, double export-import customs duties 
are imposed on goods crossing the border. Conditions of Latvian 
export became especially difficult after the Russian government 
authorized new import customs tariff rates. But Latvia 
instituted favored nation status for Russia unilaterally. 
  In the opinion of both Russian and Latvian businessmen, at 
this time cooperation in the financial sphere is most promising. 
Russian bankers believe that Latvia is the only country on the 
territory of the former USSR where the economy drives politics. 
In Latvia favorable conditions have been created to conduct 
banking transactions. This is confirmed by the fact that with a 
population of less than 3 million people on the republic's 
territory, more than 250 commercial banks are in operation and 
the confidentiality of deposits and free transfer of capital 
abroad are ensured. Starting in 1994, foreign banks are allowed 
to open branches in Latvia; they must register at the Bank of 
Latvia to do this. On the whole, there are no legislative 
restrictions on transactions of nonresidents in Latvia's 
financial sphere. In the opinion of Russian financial experts, 
as a result of a liberal currency policy, Latvia is acquiring 
the pronounced features of a financial "offshore" zone, which 
makes its commercial banks attractive for placing hard currency 
deposits and carrying out transfers of hard currency to third 
countries. 
  Russian-Latvian trade relations are based on importing raw 
materials from Russia, above all for them to be re-exported 
later, and exporting to Russia finished output which is produced 
on the basis of Russian components. The formation of this trade 
structure is the result of the constantly rising rate of the lat 
in relation to the dollar, which even with high customs duties 
makes re-export more profitable as compared to the export of 
Latvian goods. It is very likely that this is precisely what 
keeps the Russian authorities from establishing liberal trade 
conditions with Latvia. 
  But businessmen believe all the same that the economic 
relations of the two countries can be moved ahead. That is 
feasible in the area of joint operation of oil and gas industry 
installations which are on Latvia's territory. The development 
of cooperation in this area will not only provide direct 
financial benefits to the two countries, but will also make a 
contribution to solving the pressing problem of creating new 
jobs for the Russian-speaking population.

<F P=106> [Article by Tatyana Khomych, correspondent: "Does the MBR </F>
Have the Goal of Producing a President?"] 
  [Text] It is believable that yet another party will appear 
shortly in Ukraine. It will have a centrist leaning and adopt a 
course aimed at reviving Ukraine by way of energy and economic 
reforms. There would be nothing out of the ordinary in this 
information if it were not for the following detail: The 
founders of the new party are convinced that is specifically 
themselves would will bring the new president of Ukraine to 
power. 
  Such a sensational declaration was made a few days ago in 
Dnipropetrovsk by the coordinator of the MBR [Inter-Regional 
Bloc for Reforms] for Dnipropetrovsk Oblast--Gennadiy Balashov. 
He heads up the well-known businessmen's organization--the 
Center for Political Initiative--which was quite recently formed 
in this city and which is one of the regional groups supporting 
the Kuchma-Hrynyov tandem. Balashov also organized the Second 
Conference of te MBR, which likewise took place in 
Dnipropetrovsk. It was called an All-Ukrainian Conference, 
although there was serious geographic absenteeism among the 
delegates. But it is no secret among politicians nowadays that 
the MBR relies--first and foremost--on the southeastern region 
of our state, counting in its plans on support from the 
Russian-speaking population, as well as on the industrial and 
financial structure of the industrial region. A glaring example 
of the merging of certain interests of these presently dominant 
forces in the domestic politics of our state today was, indeed, 
the joining of the MBR--in the capacity of co-chairman of 
Ex-Premier Leonid Kuchma. At the presently time he is president 
of the Ukrainian Union of Industrialists and Entrepreneurs. 
  Despite the fact that Leonid Kuchma himself is not on the 
ballot for the new parliament from the Dnipropetrovsk region, 
these days he and Volodymyr Hrynyov are working quite hard to 
polish up his political image in this region. Speaking at the 
conference, both leaders made program statements with regard to 
future tactics and strategy. They spoke as candidates for the 
office of deputy and expressed the attitudes which prevail among 
the so-called reformers. "So-called" because nowadays it is hard 
to find anybody in Ukraine who would be against reforms; even 
certain points of the extreme right and the extreme left meet in 
unison. The principal thing which differentiates the MBR and its 
leaders from this modish political tendency common to everybody 
is certainly the desire to depict themselves as future reformers 
and unwavering centrists, along with their old tendency--now in 
different forms--toward an "economic union." Moreover, in 
Dnipropetrovsk the leaders of this bloc repeated their 
besmirched thesis that Ukraine is now maintaining a course 
headed for "self-isolation" and confrontation with the CIS 
[Commonwealth of Independent States], and that--of course--as 
soon as the MBR had sufficient strength in the new parliament, 
it would put a stop to this course. 
  The "reformers" themselves predict that they will win from 
20 
to 30 percent of the seats in the new Supreme Council as a 
result of the March elections. In their opinion, this will be 
enough to create a competent and effective parliamentary 
faction, which can influence the political balance of forces and 
thereby also the course of the state as a whole. However, such 
strivings do not exhaust the entire spectrum of political 
demands being made by the ambitious MBR leaders. It is foreseen 
that both leaders--provided that the pre-term presidential 
elections scheduled for June really do take place--will 
participate in them very actively. The only questions remaining 
then is which of them will prevail over the other; which of them 
will garner the most votes and influence among their partisans 
and functionaries; whether the bloc will split and the tandem 
cease to exist. 
  The answer to this last question will obviously be furnished 
at the Third Conference of the MBR, which is planned to be held 
in April. Perhaps it is there that they will decide to become a 
party rather than a block. But, as of today, the MBR leaders 
want to patch up their political squabbles for the sake of a 
certain togetherness. All the more so in that the platform 
combines the ideas of both men to a great extent: Both Kuchma 
and Hrynyov advocate giving the green light to the Russian 
language, a federative land system, and a "union" for Ukraine, 
as a country which--obviously--cannot exist independently. 
  Considerably less was spoken about in Dnipropetrovsk 
concerning everything else, including the most urgent economic 
reforms for Ukraine. This has given cause to local analysts to 
place a great many question marks after the assertions made by 
the MBR leaders to the effect that they know a solution to the 
economic crisis. Some of them, in this connection, thought that 
both of these leaders had a chance to show themselves on the 
field of a state being rebuilt. But they left no trace of 
blooming roses. Can this likewise be anticipated if one of them 
becomes president?

<F P=106> [Articles by Aleksandr Pilat and Vitaliy Portnikov under the </F>
heading: "The Crimea Train Has Left?: The Inhabitants of the 
Autonomy Have Supported Their President Once Again"] 
  [Text] Following the elections to the Supreme Council of 
Crimea and the poll of residents on the peninsula, Yuriy 
Meshkov's slogan "Reunification of Crimea and Russia Is My 
Goal," thanks to which he in fact won, is acquiring increasingly 
real outlines. But, as Viktor Alsufyev, chairman of the Central 
Election Commission of Crimea, declared at a news conference on 
28 March, elections were not held in five of the 66 districts 
because there was a turnout of less than half of the electorate. 
Repeat elections will be held in these districts. In 10 
districts the deputies have already been elected, and they all 
represent the Russia bloc (it was this bloc, we would recall, 
that brought Yuriy Meshkov to power). It is mainly candidates of 
the Russia bloc that have gone on to the second round scheduled 
for 10 April, and it is they that have realistic changes of 
victory. 
  The Russia bloc is leading in the vote by party slate also. 
The Kurultay of the Crimean Tatar People was the winner in the 
Crimean Tatar multiple-seat national district: According to 
preliminary figures, it has won 13 of the 14 seats in the 
Supreme Council of Crimea. One seat, evidently, will be gained 
by the opponent of the Kurultay--the Crimean Tatar National 
Movement, which, incidentally, supports the Russia bloc. 
Deputies for four single-seat national districts--Armenian, 
Greek, Bulgarian, and German--were elected also. 
  Observers note that the most radical deputies in respect to 
Russia: Anatoliy Los, chairman of the Crimea Russian Society, 
and Aleksandr Kruglov, chairman of the Russian Party of 
Sevastopol and currently a deputy of the Supreme Council of 
Crimea and the Sevastopol City Council, did not make it to the 
second round. Sergey Shuvaynikov, chairman of the Russian Party 
of Crimea, and Viktor Mezha, chairman of the People's Party of 
Crimea, which is a member of the Russia bloc, made it through to 
the second round from a Simferopol district. It is assumed that 
Mezha has the best chance of being elected. 
  As observers believe, representatives of the Russia bloc 
will 
obtain in the future parliament no fewer than two-thirds of the 
seats, which is entirely sufficient for the adoption of any 
constitutional decision. And if the representatives of the 
Kurultay in parliament boycott the adoption of this decision or 
the other, this will have no legal consequences. 
  The Central Election Commission, which was appointed by the 
president of the Republic of Crimea, is tallying the results of 
the poll of inhabitants of the peninsula. As Sergey Nikulin, 
aide to the president of the Republic of Crimea, said in 
conversation with our NEZAVISIMAYA GAZETA correspondent, "the 
poll was conducted under referendum conditions" (we would recall 
that questions concerning treaty relations of Crimea and 
Ukraine, dual citizenship, and on an edict of the president of 
Crimea having legislative force were asked in the poll). Sergey 
Nikulin informed our NEZAVISIMAYA GAZETA correspondent that, 
according to preliminary figures, more than 60 percent of the 
electorate had taken part in the poll, as in the elections. "No 
fewer than 80 percent of those who took part in the ballot, 
possibly more, responded 'for' to all three questions." The 
figures for Simferopol are already final: 84 percent responded 
affirmatively to the first question, 87.8 percent to the second, 
and 83.6 percent to the third. 
  And although the poll is not legally binding, observers are 
convinced that at the first session of the new Supreme Council 
of Crimea the deputies will recognize it as a referendum with 
all the ensuing consequences. It is hard to say as yet what Kiev 
would do in such a case. Much will depend on the new parliament 
of Ukraine. 
  On 28 March a news conference for Crimean, Ukrainian, and 
foreign journalists was conducted by the leaders of the Crimean 
Tatar National Movement Organization, which supports the 
Kurultay of the Crimean Tatar People, the Ukrainian Citizens 
Congress of Crimea, the Crimea organization of the Ukrainian 
Republican Party, and the Crimea With Ukraine Committee. It 
spoke of the illegality of the poll of inhabitants of the 
peninsula, which, according to the organizers of the news 
conference, was boycotted by the majority of Crimean Tatars and 
Ukrainians. A joint statement was read out to the journalists, 
which said: "The greatest urgency is attached at this worrying 
time to the cooperation of the Crimean Tatar and pro-Ukraine 
organizations. The Ukrainian organizations will be even more 
scrupulous in their defense of the rights and interests of the 
Crimean Tatars via their central offices in Kiev and via their 
deputies in the Supreme Council of Ukraine. The Crimean Tatar 
National Movement Organization will support the Ukrainian 
organizations on questions of the preservation of the 
territorial integrity of Ukraine and the affirmation of 
Ukrainian statehood on the territory of Crimea." 
  As already reported, Konstantin Zatulin, chairman of the 
State Duma of the Russian Federation CIS Committee, and Sergey 
Stankevich, member of the State Duma of the Russian Federation 
International Affairs Committee, are in Crimea as election 
observers. They are both part of the leadership of the Party of 
Russian Unity and Accord. In the evening of 28 March Zatulin and 
Stankevich declared that "Ukraine and Crimea are confronted with 
the need for a reform of power. The political elite of Ukraine 
is not wholly prepared for the challenge of the times, not 
wholly prepared for federalism." Stankevich declared that 
"resolution of the problem of the Black Sea Fleet is a matter of 
the next three months." 
  Konstantin Zatulin and Sergey Stankevich met with Yuriy 
Meshkov, president of the Republic of Crimea, Viktor Semenov, 
chairman of the Sevastopol City Council, Mustafa Dzhemilev, 
chairman of the Majlis of the Crimean Tatar People, and his 
deputy, Refat Chubarov, who was elected, incidentally, deputy of 
the Supreme Council of Crimea for the Crimean Tatar single-seat 
national district. 
  [Signed] Aleksandr Pilat 
  There is nothing sensational about the results of the 
Crimean 
poll, come to that: It would have been odd had the inhabitants 
of the peninsula, who had quite recently elected Yuriy Meshkov 
their president, suddenly denied his first major initiative 
their trust. The question now is exclusively one of how the 
Crimean leadership wishes to dispose of the results of this 
poll--especially since it will now have at its disposal a 
controlled parliament, in which representatives of Meshkov's 
Russia bloc constitute the majority. On the eve of the second 
round of parliamentary elections in Ukraine and, particularly, 
before what are now entirely possible presidential elections, 
Leonid Kravchuk has found himself faced with a new insoluble 
problem. 
  The tactics chosen in respect to the Crimean aspirations 
were 
fool-proof, seemingly: They were based on the cooperation of two 
bureaucratic teams. One of them, Kiev's, gave its Simferopol 
counterpart carte-blanche, demanding in exchange merely 
nondisruption of the territorial status quo. Thus in the place 
of Crimea Oblast appeared the Republic of Crimea, in the place 
of the oblast soviet, the Supreme Council, and provincial 
politicians began to call themselves ministers, speakers, 
presidents.... Nikolay Bagrov's fiasco confounded this 
protracted tightrope flirting. President Meshkov has obtained a 
fortunate opportunity to avail himself of the attributive 
achievements of his predecessor to acquire real power. Kiev, 
which is endeavoring to preserve the status quo, can hardly opt 
for some successful version of relations with the peninsula. But 
the development of events around Crimea could prove undesirable 
for Moscow also: It is, for all that, a question of a peninsula, 
not an island, and if Yuriy Meshkov suddenly conceives a desire 
to play his role through to the end and become a Simferopol 
Vladislav Ardzinba, a dangerous new conflict would then unfold 
not in the Caucasus but on Russia's European borders.

<F P=106> ["Exclusive" report No. 13 (63) of 31 March: Interview with </F>
Crimean Deputy Prime Minister Yevgeniy Saburov by Yuriy Shein, 
date and place not given] 
  [Text] "THE CRIMEA CONFRONTS RATHER SERIOUS PROBLEMS BUT 
THERE IS NO CRIMEAN PROBLEM AS SUCH," SAYS VICE PREMIER YEVGENIY 
SABUROV 
  A 48-year old prominent Russian economist YEVGENIY SABUROV 
who heads the governmental Information and Social Technologies 
Center was invited by the President of the Republic of Crimea 
Yuriy Meshkov to take the post of the government's vice premier. 
(As it is known, according to the Crimean Constitution, the 
president heads the Cabinet). Saburov, who was born in the 
Crimean city of Yalta, accepted the invitation and 
parliamentarians confirmed him on this post at the last session 
of the republic's Supreme Soviet. Our Interfax correspondent 
Yuriy Shein speaks with Yevgeniy Saburov who has recently 
visited the peninsular [as received] about the Crimea's 
problems, prospects of its development, and mutual relations 
between Kiev and Moscow. 
  [Shein] What are your impressions concerning the visit to 
the 
Crimea? 
  [Saburov] In the course of my trip I had to closely 
associate 
with the Crimean President Yuriy Meshkov and to see what he has 
been done, to analyze the measures proposed to the republic by 
different experts including representatives of the previous 
composition of Crimea's Cabinet of Ministers and by different 
commercial structures, governmental departments, and by 
initiative groups and parties. 
  A total of 16 programs have been put forward for 
consideration. As a matter of fact, the greater part of these 
programs lacks technological aspects, they have no logical 
conclusion and are of a purely conceptual nature though they 
present a certain interest. The proposed programs suffer from 
one major shortage -- it is impossible to fulfil them. These 
are not programs but just good intentions and concepts which 
have not been calculated from the economic point of view. 
However, one can consider them and "improve" them to the level 
of draft decrees. The Moscow experts, and, in particular, 
experts from the Moscow State University, have done at least one 
fourth of this work. 
  [Shein] What economic problems enjoyed priority during your 
trip? 
  [Saburov] First of all, it was necessary to make it clear 
what role plays Crimea's Cabinet of Ministers and what is the 
situation with the management in the economy. [sentence as 
received] The republic's previous leadership was not ready for 
democracy; nobody has ever thought that the existing power 
bodies can loose [as received] during the presidential 
elections. The reaction of certain circles in Simferopol with 
respect to Meshkov's victory was just a hysterical one. As a 
result of Meshkov's unexpected victory they have entirely 
withdrawn despite the need to organize the spring sowing 
campaign, to get ready for the summer vacation period, and 
presence of numerous everyday problems because this period is 
the decisive one for the rest of the year. 
  Consequently, due to the offense, because the people have 
voted not in such a way as the previous leaders would have 
preferred, they were ready to leave the Crimeans literally in 
hunger and in cold. This is the supreme level of political 
tactlessness. However, this line of behavior is peculiar only 
to the representatives of the supreme echelons of power. 
  The people from the next link of the management chain 
remained absolutely calm regarding the results of the elections. 
In general, they did not demonstrate their political likings 
but honestly fulfilled their duties. Though there were some 
exceptions, it, for example, concerns Crimea's Agriculture 
Minister Yegudin. [as received] He reported both in Kiev and 
Simferopol that the situation with fertilizers on the peninsular 
is rather good. However, it appeared that the situation in this 
field is just catastrophic. It seems that by his statements 
Yegudin wanted to discredit Crimea's new government. I'd like 
to repeat that, as a rule, the sabotage was peculiar only to the 
supreme echelons of power. 
  [Shein] However, these people still hoped to continue their 
work in the new composition of the government, didn't they 
  [Saburov] It was quite clear that they would not enter the 
new Cabinet -- some of them were incompetent, some of them were 
"stained" because the level of corruption in the Crimean 
Government was rather high. It's interesting to note that there 
were attempts "to fail" Meshkov even after these elections; the 
statement stating that Meshkov would stay at power only for four 
months which was voiced by the Ukrainian Ambassador to Russia 
V.Kryzhanovskiy [name as received] testifies to this fact. An 
artificially created shortage of bread and other goods in Crimea 
would probably be one of the reasons of his dismissal. However, 
I think that these actions have not been planned beforehand, the 
question primarily concerns a spontaneous hysterical reaction. 
  [Shein] What is the reaction with respect to Meshkov's 
victory in the regions? 
  [Saburov] I have visited Kerch, Bakhchisaray, the Simferopol 
region, the peninsular's southern coast and met with leaders of 
several farms and enterprises. I must say that they demonstrate 
a positive reaction with respect to the recent events. If 
earlier under the pressure of the official propaganda the 
majority of the leaders of this level perceived Meshkov as an 
extremist then now, when they saw his concrete moves and actions 
(I believe that one of them is my invitation to the post in the 
Crimean government), they have radically changed their opinion. 
It became clear that the question concerns a normal life, 
raising of the people's well-being, and, first of all, the need 
to abolish several Ukrainian decrees regarding the economic 
activity in the Crimea. As a result, Meshkov's rating started 
to grow. 
  The world practice demonstrates that the popularity of a new 
president falls immediately after his elections, it is a natural 
phenomenon. We watch quite an adverse situation in the Crimea 
-- Meshkov's rating has grown even in the circles which looked 
at him with some fear. It is very important because this knocks 
out the ground from under those who thought that the president 
would quickly "fail," that he came to power thanks to populist 
slogans. Now the people understand that Meshkov is a serious 
politician who demonstrates a well balanced approach to 
different problems and they agree to work with him. That's why 
there is a kind of perplexity among his opponents now. 
  [Shein] What is the position of the Crimean Tatars? 
  [Saburov] This is a serious problem. Kiev persuaded the 
Crimean Tatars that Yuriy Meshkov is a Russian nationalist who 
would not take them into account. A great part of the Tatars 
gave their backing to him, however, these were inactive layers 
of the population who are not interested in political activity. 
These people are not noticeable on the public arena. 
  For their part, the most politicized layers of the Tatars 
counted on Kiev. Now it is clear that Crimea's new leadership 
has no anti- Tatar moods and understands the tragedy of these 
people (in 1994 all Crimean Tatars were deported to Siberia and 
Middle Asia -- Interfax). Meshkov managed to persuade the 
Tatars in his deep interest in peace and stability on the 
peninsular and his sympathy towards them. Of course, there is 
still no special kindness but there is no sharp confrontation 
either. 
  However, after the Tatars' attitude towards the new Crimean 
leadership started to improve it seems that certain political 
circles outside the Crimea started to demonstrate that they do 
not need stability and peace on the peninsular. Of course, if 
the Crimean-Tatar people happily live in the Crimea then there 
will be no need in noisy TV shows, loud statements, and stormy 
meetings in the defense of the "oppressed" Crimean Tatars, that 
is those factors thanks to which the functionaries try to earn 
their political capital. Russia must seriously think over this 
question -- Kiev has allocated material aid to this deported 
people and where is Moscow? 
  [Shein] What is your opinion concerning the relations 
between Simferopol and Kiev? 
  [Saburov] The situation is not quite clear. Kiev has not 
demonstrated any objections regarding my candidacy. In 
accordance with the developed scheme I signed a statement with a 
request to grant the Ukrainian citizenship to me; the major 
obstacle was removed by this move. However, there is still no 
answer to my request. I believe that leaders in Kiev, both the 
present ones and those who will come to power, must be 
interested in the Crimea's well-being and in its relations with 
the Russian Federation. 
  The existing discrimination of the Crimea cannot last for 
ever, the politicians must understand this. The will of the 
people is an exclusively serious thing. Objectively, the 
appointment of a professional economist to the high post in this 
important for Ukraine region is a positive factor. 
  However, there are certain circles in Kiev who stake on the 
Crimean problem during the pre-election campaign. These people 
deem it important to declare about their Ukrainian patriotism, 
that's why they artificially aggravate the situation on the 
peninsular. They do not occupy high posts but they represent 
rather a garish group interested in stirring different kinds of 
conflicts. I hope that the Ukrainian president has enough 
wisdom not to go after these "functionaries." There are no such 
functionaries in the Crimea. It maintains a provincial calm 
atmosphere and is concerned over the solution of social issues. 
  [Shein] What can you say about the industrial sector of the 
republic? 
  [Saburov] The presence of a great number of highly skilled 
workers is peculiar for the Crimea. In my opinion, there is no 
such a region from this point of view on the whole territory of 
the former Soviet Union, including the Baltic states. Who can 
boast about this in Russia? The Crimea produces tankers for the 
countries of the Western Europe. Where in the former USSR the 
production of the electronic industry can compete with the 
western one? The goods produced in Simferopol can find a good 
market. 
  The predatory Ukrainian laws present the main misfortune. 
According to them, we are to pay 50 percent of the currency 
earnings to the state on an extremely low rate, not in 
accordance with the exchange one. For example, Kiev, say, 
offers 9000 Ukrainian coupons for one dollar and its real price 
is 36,000 coupons. It is unprofitable for enterprises to work 
for export under this situation. It is necessary to remove 
these obstacles and to create a normal currency exchange. The 
question concerns enterprises of a European level. 
  As far as Crimea's agriculture is concerned, it has nothing 
in common with the ruined Russian collective and state farms. 
These are like large factories on the land built on analogy 
with the conveyer industry as, for example, the wine producing 
factories where there is no farms, this stage is left in the 
past. Here the production is organized in accordance with the 
modern technology and science, it's the XXth century. 
  In order to privatize these factories without destroying the 
established system it is necessary to handle them in such a way 
as the Russian industrial giants -- it is necessary to trade 
them but not to dismember. Directors of these enterprises are 
well educated people having high intellectual needs. 
  Unfortunately, all of them are in a difficult economic 
situation due to the system of mutual payments between Kiev and 
Moscow, existence of customs offices, levying of customs 
tariffs, etc. One should take into consideration that the 
Crimea's economy is oriented towards the Russian Federation but 
not Ukraine. Russia, especially the Russian North, has been 
also the major consumer of the Crimean products. The ports on 
the peninsular have been built given this factor. 
  The break in its relations with Russia places the Crimea on 
the brink of survival. That's why the demand to restore these 
relations are not of a nationalist overtone on the part of the 
Crimeans but a natural strive to restore the previous contacts. 
The republic has been deprived of the market, it is a real 
strangling of this region. 
  [Shein] The Crimea possessed the best resorts in the USSR... 
  [Saburov] Now the Crimean budget is arranged in such a way 
that the recreation branch with its sanatoriums and rest houses 
represents a stone on the republic's neck as it brings no 
profits but necessitates appropriations. This is caused by the 
existing taxation system and distribution of the expenditures 
and revenues part of the Crimean budget. It is necessary to 
create a real bank system, to let foreign banks, primarily the 
Russian ones, to the Crimea. Let the Turkish, Swiss, and other 
banks act in the Crimea, God bless them. Currently Russian 
banks actually cannot function in the Crimea, they are being 
choked, and the Crimean ones are rather weak yet. 
  [Shein] What is your opinion about Sevastopol? 
  [Saburov] Sevastopol is a city with highly professional 
branches of industry which has much in common with Kerch and 
Simferopol. The greatest naval base which must contribute 
something into the Crimea's budget is situated here. I believe 
that a good trade and passenger port can also be created here. 
  There are rather many minor political intrigues of 
provincial 
scale around the Crimea. Several politicians would like to 
withdraw Sevastopol from the composition of the Republic of 
Crimea. These people do not look into the far future they 
cannot think strategically and imagine whereto this course can 
lead. I think that this issue can be removed by means of a 
rational explanation of the situation to the citizens. That's 
why, I think that the situation in Sevastopol is very difficult. 
  At the same time I'd like to stress that the policy of a 
forcible Ukrainization of the Crimea and stirring of 
anti-Russian moods on the peninsular is very dangerous. The 
Crimea is a Russian-speaking region. However, the republican 
radio stations broadcast their programs in the Ukrainian 
language. It has only several minutes a day to broadcast in the 
Russian language. This irritates the population greatly. The 
TV programs from Moscow are also broadcast not to the full 
extent. There is no popular TV channel NTV at all. One can 
permanently listen to songs in the Ukrainian language and see 
Ukrainian dances. I am not against them but one should observe 
certain boundaries. The people are irritated. 
  [Shein] Do you acknowledge the Crimea's joining Russia? 
  [Saburov] I do not think that one should raise the issue on 
the Crimea's withdrawal from Ukraine. There exists a Ukrainian 
law on delegation of authorities between the Crimea and Ukraine. 
I cannot say that this is a masterpiece of the juridical 
thought, it is compiled extremely illiterately, one article 
contradicts to another one. Nevertheless, this decree grants a 
substantial independence to the Republic of Crimea and we intend 
to use this opportunity. It will be beneficial for Kiev, 
Simferopol, and Moscow. 
  If there are no artificial obstacles and politically 
shortsighted moves on the part of Kiev then the Crimea will be 
able to play the role of a bridge between Ukraine, Russia, and 
other countries of the former Union, it will become a kind of an 
account center, something like a free bank republic or something 
like this. It is technically feasible under the presence of 
good will on the part of all parties. 
  I'd like to note that against the background of the growing 
offensive of anti-democratic forces in several republics of the 
former USSR, the Crimea remains a democratic region. Everything 
what happens here is done in accordance with the will of the 
people. That's why we are extremely surprised by the behavior of 
several countries which deem themselves strongholds of democracy 
especially when they oppose the will of the Republic of Crimea's 
citizens. I'd like to ask these people to seriously treat the 
situation and understand that Simferopol makes an interesting 
attempt from the international point of view, it is going to 
create a normal democratic market economy after the insane 
failures of various experimentators. 
  [Shein] What do you await from Russia? 
  [Saburov] First of all, we must reach an agreement with 
Moscow to restore the economic ties. According to available 
information, Russian enterprises are interested in the Crimea's 
production and in the development of further contacts. As I 
have already said, the proposed programs of economic reforms in 
the Crimea appeared to be non-technological ones but there are 
highly qualified experts in Moscow who can render their 
assistance. 
  I am very thankful to Leonid Kuchma (Ukraine's former 
premier 
-- Interfax) for a very interesting phrase which concerns the 
entire situation in this region. When certain circles in Kiev 
started to declare "Why should we invite someone from the 
outside, are there no people among us?" minding my invitation to 
the Crimean government, Kuchma said: "Why we can invite advisers 
from Canada and the United States who do not know our situation 
and we cannot invite a native Crimean?" 
  I do not want to boast but there are highly professional 
people in Russia who understand our situation, who could work 
here and not go in for politics. However, I'd like to repeat 
once more that economic and intellectual contacts with the 
Russians are extremely important and one should not forget that 
in the moral plan Moscow is in a great debt in the face of the 
Crimean Tatars. 
  [Shein] What relations do you intend to maintain with the 
present Russian government? 
  [Saburov] I believe that the relations will be businesslike 
ones and, of course, not such as now. Naturally, they would 
depend upon the post occupied by this or that person. For 
example, one acts as the Crimea's representative and another one 
as the representative of Moscow, etc. I think that private 
relations and the knowledge of who is who would positively 
affect our relations. There is no need to get acquainted because 
everybody knows each other. 
  [Shein] Can we speak about the personal composition of the 
government now? 
  [Saburov] The new government will be formed in the near 
term. 
I want to invite several intelligent professionals from Moscow. 
There are many people wishing to come to the Crimea to work, but 
I do not think that all of them fit this work. We need those 
who really fit this sphere but it is rather difficult to 
persuade them to leave Moscow and to live in the Crimea. This 
work in not just for one or two days. Many people offer their 
services as consultants. I am not quite satisfied with this 
either, we can use Moscow's consultations. In Simferopol we 
need those who are able to really rule. They will face rather 
high demands and the selection will be tough as well. 
  I hope to find support in the apparatus which already exists 
in the Crimea. As I said earlier, it is quite workable. 
However, it is impossible to establish contacts with several 
people from the supreme echelon. One cannot lean on them as 
they can let down at any moment. 
  According to the Constitution, one cannot appoint the 
government in the Crimea, in contrast to Russia, as it is the 
prerogative of the Supreme Soviet. That's why its too early to 
speak about the composition of the Cabinet, I shall just select 
people and the parliament will pass a corresponding decision. 
  [Shein] How do you work with Meshkov? 
  [Saburov] We interact with Yuriy Meshkov rather well. In 
general, he granted freedom to me, a kind of "a cart blanche" in 
several spheres. Everything what concerns the economy is in the 
sphere of my competence and he, what is natural, solves the 
political issues. However, it is difficult to draw a precise 
line here. 
  I think that the Crimea faces different, rather serious, 
problems but there is no problem of the Crimea as such. It has 
been invented, it is just a card in the play of politicians who 
do not live in the Crimea. 
  On the whole, the atmosphere is splendid there, I like the 
Crimea during the winter-spring season very much. One should go 
and rest there, quietness and calm reign there. 
  [Shein] And now my final question. You have recently 
visited Great Britain and France. With whom have you negotiated 
there? 
  [Saburov] We planned this trip long ago and I went there as 
the Director of the governmental Information and Social 
Technologies Center. However, it is quite clear that after my 
appointment to the post of the Crimea's vice premier the tasks 
of this trip have changed. As a result, I managed to hold 
several meetings which were not scheduled beforehand. In 
accordance with the mutual consent of the parties we did not 
hold any official contacts on the state level. I think that 
there is no need to force this process. 
  The conversations with representatives of business circles 
of 
Great Britain and France who are interested in their presence in 
the Crimea were very interesting. I shall not speak about 
concrete projects, the future will tell... It is important that 
we have already reached several agreements. I even had an 
impression that there is something more appealing in the Crimea 
for the western businessmen than in Russia though this 
comparison is tactless -- the scales are quite different. 
  I am especially thankful to Mr Lionel Stolarue who has done 
much to introduce me into the world of the French business. 
Earlier I knew him thanks to his splendid economic works, now I 
am quite sure that this prominent scientist and state 
functionary is an excellent man in the supreme notion of this 
word. He is sincerely "ill" with the Crimea's problems. I 
congratulate Ukrainian President Leonid Kravchuk with such an 
adviser and wish him to more often listen to the recommendations 
of Mr Stolarue. 
  In general, I'd like to underline that the Republic of 
Crimea 
intends to widely use the law on independent foreign economic 
activity granted to it in accordance with Ukraine's law. The 
guarantee of our survival lies in our openness. 
  When this interview was ready for publication we learned 
that 
on Monday, March 28, Yevgeniy Saburov flew to Simferopol to his 
new place of work.
